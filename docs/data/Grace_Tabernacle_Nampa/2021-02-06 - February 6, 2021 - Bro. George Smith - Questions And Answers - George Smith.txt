evening saints happy to have each one of you here tonight um i just want to say a quick word uh there has been a quite a response for questions and um i saw brother george today going through studying looking in his bible going through these notes and i just want to put this out to you tonight if your question does not get brought up tonight there is probably more questions then we have time so i just encourage each one if your question uh is is not spoke of tonight and you desire an answer uh we will we will give those get those answers for you so just kind of a little warning that brother george has quite quite a list a quite a pile of of of questions to answer tonight and so having said that i just want to give full liberty to brother george just to come what god has laid upon his heart and um would you did you have another song work it we're good liberty we've got liberty okay okay i kind of misunderstood i didn't tell i looked down on the list and i see another song on there listen yeah well anyway let's just give plenty of time to brother george let's just welcome him this evening uh amen um i have i just want to just say this quick note i have had the privilege and i do consider it that i i'm not very good at lifting men up and putting them on pedestals it never works right but i have uh been overseas with brother george i have uh seen his approach to the people uh and um you know he has given me this compliment and i want to give it back to him what you see is what you get amen and and i think that's quite special myself i say that as a compliment so you know we don't have another brother george out here and another brother george here it's the same man morning noon and night seven days a week all 12 months of the year so let's just open our hearts and and just lift him up this evening in the name of the lord amen thank you brother paul there's only one brother paul also so we're thankful but i'm glad that he has invited me back after two and a half years and i i was kind of waiting to get see if the house got finished you know but i just got tired of waiting so it's good to be here and we're um we're going to get right into these questions we've already sung we've prayed and uh lovely music i'm glad it's under control not like some places i've been and but i've had a few well a few hours because i got here when friday friday night you know so we had yesterday or today today saturday see when you're having fun all that good pie it's just time flies but um we're glad to be here and i don't have all the answers but we'll see if the answers are in the word now some are scriptural questions and some are so we should say nosy questions but it's okay to laugh in church this is it's better than the alternative so let's see here where where did you and sister rebecca first meet well uh the testimony is online you can see it anytime you please but we met in tucson arizona and uh i was already living there and because my mother was born there and anyway ended up there finishing up high school and then all of a sudden this family moves to town from far away and you know it's obvious when somebody comes in here that's not from here right well they had this southern indiana accent and um so yeah it was pretty much i thought it was love at first sight i had to convince her but you know she's not here to defend herself did you feel you had to pray about her being the right one or did you know as soon as you met her well that's a tricky question honey that was over 60 years ago and uh i wasn't taught to really pray about those things i just saw the most beautiful woman you know it was like paul you know but i was a baptist you know and they were in a different church and so there was some prayer um it seems holiness is rarely preached anymore and i will assume this person isn't from this church or they haven't been paying attention do you feel it should be preached as according to god's word and the message of the hour the answer is yes should be okay now these aren't in any particular order like you said yours might get left out but we're going to try please explain the wave sheath well the wave sheath was something they had in the old testament this was the first it was the example and of course there's a whole lot more to this if you ask this question to brother david we might be here till 11 30. so there's a reason they use me because they know i'm leaving monday is the wave chief in this last day the bride since she is him uh i would consider the wave chief to be william branham's ministry he was the example of what we're supposed to be and uh that's all in the message which brings us to another point has anybody not seen this book raise your hand okay this is called the resume of the seven church ages this is chapter 10 out of this book here and if you can't get it out of the deacons tell them you want it and i'll send you some more but this is the seven church ages it's in readable fashion and every home should have at least one copy and a lot of these things are covered in there what kind of relationship did you have with brother branham well let's just say i was very careful because here's a man that could see through you and was i going to pull a fast one i don't think so uh i didn't know who it was i'd never knew this name before you know they moved arizona and lived a block from my house and um so before i could get close to the girl i had to meet the man you know and so in our first encounter we're just two guys talking i'm there to ask permission to get to know her better he's checking me out because that's his firstborn and kind of protective you know um but i later realized that what he was doing he was scanning the hard drive you know down there all the way and so yeah i was very careful since the two seeds are so close now this is referring to matthew 24 24 do you think brother branham knew it would be within the message itself yes i believe he knew that where else is it going to come from it's got to be very close something almost deceives the very elect which means it'll deceive everything that's not elect let's see here how often do we as a christian have to pay our tithes is it monthly or every time we get paid well good question the fact is you should pay your tithes as soon as possible because this is borrowed money that 10 is not yours to start with so god is trusting you with a hundred dollars but only 90 90 of it's yours now i was standing there one day in the yard when this man drove up from california to arizona and he came for one purpose that's to pay brother branham his tithes and he said and i've already added the 20 and over half of you don't know that's bible but this man had been keeping his titles waiting for whatever time to pay it and the scripture says if you keep your tithes and don't pay it right away then you add 20 percent bible and so uh he'd already added that in brother brown accepted it blessed him and he went on now there's another tithe story that is worth mentioning uh well two actually brother brahm told me himself he said now george tithing is one thing i know works so there's no question there's a man he's gone now but there was a man in east texas his name was r.g letourneau and everybody over 50 probably knows that name he was a manufacturer of earth moving equipment this was before caterpillar and during the second world war seventy percent of all the earth moving equipment used in the war came from his factory and he had a very christian attitude about things he started paying 10 percent they started to start paying 20 percent and eventually he was paying 90 percent to the mission field and living on 10 percent it does work the scripture says try me see if i can see if you can help out do me you know so yeah tithing is very important um let's see here what is the difference of being a prophet and having the gift of prophecy well prophets are born prophets now in the case of brother branham and probably all the others but that's the one we can focus on uh even though he was born a prophet it didn't really amount to much until he was fully surrendered there's nothing magic about it you have to there's parts you've got to put into it whereas a gift of prophecy is something you know you can god gives those sovereignly and a person is prayed for just like a gift of singing or whatever uh if you're you know aiming in that direction then it starts manifesting the ministry blesses you and it works and there's a lot more that can be said about these things and we'll leave these with brother paul so he can expound on him uh why was rebecca a prophetess even though she was a woman well good question now this is deborah okay i think this is a probably a child who wrote this that's good why was deborah a prophetess even though she was a woman well you can go read in judges chapter 4 and chapter 5. it was god's design see we don't argue well god why did you do this we'd like for the sun to come up in the north tomorrow it's not going to happen but there's people that kind of have that mentality you know so whatever god says it works but chapter four and five of judges has the answer for you uh why did israelites make war if the commandments told them not to kill also chapter four and five of judges see israel just like america was blessed and they're blessed and they're blessed then they forgot where the blessings come from and they started into idolatry and then god sends the enemies go down and punish them they go down there slaughter a few people other times god says the israelites go kill all those people over there it's just the way god ordained things to be and we don't question but god has ways of doing things that we don't know just yes lord thy will be done okay did mary did joseph and mary have children besides jesus yes open your bibles mark 13 um where we at here matthew 13 i'm sorry and verse 55 where the bible says see here matthew 13 55 is not this the carpenter's son it's not his mother called mary and his brethren james joseph simon judas and his sisters ah so there was a big family yeah jesus was the firstborn and the others was our lord jesus baptized in the name of jesus according to acts 2 38 i don't think so acts 2 38 wasn't written yet or how was he baptized by john the baptist well if you read in uh uh let's see where's it at john chapter one let's go there real quick john chapter one and uh verse 28. we have the account of when jesus came to the water now remember these two were second cousins because mary and elizabeth were cousins so these are second cousins and we don't know how close they were during their childhood but in math in john 1 28 these things were done in bethlehem beyond jordan where john was baptizing the next day john sees jesus coming unto him and said behold the lamb of god which taketh away to the sin of the world this is he of whom i have already told you after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me and i knew him not but that he should be made manifest to israel therefore i am come baptizing with water in other words he was the forerunner and john bear record saying i saw the spirit descending him from heaven like a dove and a boat upon him and i knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptizes with the holy ghost so john is there baptizing doing his you know ministry and jesus comes to him now they had a little bit of discussions in another chapter oh john says you know i'm oh it's you i saw the dove i should be baptized of you no you're going to baptize me because that's what it should be the sacrifice had to be washed before it was offered so i don't know what formula john the baptist used it was in acts 2 38 okay so get that clear please tell us how brother braham told you you had received the holy ghost well that's also on the uh internet but it was real simple i was in beaumont texas way down on the coast in a small church about this size and it was just three brothers me and brother perry and brother richard blair were but just kneeling in a bench praying now brother brahm knew i was there he was in arizona a thousand miles away and he had told brother perry the week before it looks like this kid's gonna be my son-in-law take him home pray for the holy ghost why didn't brother bran just put his hand on me you know with it well that wasn't god's program okay so i go off and i'm over there and that morning because i don't know why i'm there they didn't tell me why i was going i thought i was on vacation you know i was just a kid 18 years old and so that morning brother blair had come over to brother perry's house to use his phone to call brother branham in arizona but when he called brother branham was already out of the house so they said we'll take your name and we'll have him call you when he comes back okay so these two are sitting by the phone waiting for it to ring all day and i'm over in my room reading the bible so i thought well two brothers maybe we'll just pray together so we come over and we're praying and so while we're praying um i remember very well that you know with my eyes closed it was like kind of like today or some days when it's kind of a cloudy sky there's there's breaks in the clouds you know sun shining through these like shafts of light and um and so then right away the phone rang so brother perry goes to answer his phone and uh it's brother branham and he was calling for for the other brother and so he says but first let me talk to george okay so i go and read him he says now look george i want to be the first to congratulate you on receiving the baptism of the holy ghost oh so that's what that was all about so he was identifying what had happened you know because he knew i was kind of hard-headed you know like some other people we know and so he uh he identified it so all these years later it's not so much that he identified but that it actually happened and it's got bigger every day so that's the way that was simple as that some people have different kind of sensations you know the are pentecostal friends because somebody backed their spoken tongues well then everybody well i've seen all kinds of people speak in tongues they had no more holy ghost than nothing so that's one of the evidences but it's not a pattern that everybody has to follow you know okay let's see what we've got here um what is serpent seed okay good question uh genesis 3 verse 14 is right here genesis 3 14 and 15 and the lord god said unto the serpent because thou has done this so for all of you that think that first of all a serpent here is not a snake serpent was an upright being that could reason could talk to because you've already talked to him over here in the other part of the chapter now god's talking to him now serpent because you did this you're cursed of all the cattle very beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and thus shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and i will put enmity in other words kind of like a hatred between you and the woman and between thy seed so there's the serpent's seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shall bruise his heel so that is where the serpent's seed is brother brahm didn't make it up it's in the bible from way back you see and uh you can read the whole story in chapter three to see what he did and so forth um and there's another question about this little later was cain hybrid because he was a cross between serpent and human yeah he was a hybrid definitely how was jesus all man and all god well he was the only person that ever was he was born of woman without sex mystery he was a kinsmen redeemer had to be you know a blood relative of ours um at lazarus tomb he was very human when he cried because his friend had died but he was very god when he said lazarus come forth and he walked out so he was also tempted in all ways like us and he could have had a wife and children but he didn't so yeah he was all man he was all god says here uh quote follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that you may prophesy first corinthians 14 1. in the context of this verse what gifts should we desire well everybody's cut out different now you that have more than two children you know that they're all different got the same kind of blood um but each one has to pray and seek the mind of the lord for your individual life and when you know that god has revealed when god is doing something for you then you go with that you see and uh psalm 46 10 says be still i'm god i know all the details there are no surprises for me i got it all under control so you just look to god for the answer and he will show you what you should do everybody can't stand up here with a microphone everybody can't play the piano but you have a position in the body to make it work right it's like these nice cars will get outside the rubber tire is one thing but the steering wheel is different the computer is different all these little pieces make it go you know so god will direct and uh show you what you should be what you should desire why does it matter what a person's name means well if it didn't matter why doesn't anybody call their little girl sapphira you know any little boys called ananias no although there's several in the bible some one was a real good one there was a case in venezuela which i used to go to a lot but hadn't been there in about five years but i got down there and they were having some kind of a youth camp and this one girl comes up and she said brother swords i need prayer what's the matter well you know my mother doesn't treat me right and she had all kinds of problems you know and so i said well what is your name anyway they all know me and i don't know who they are and she said well my name is bethsaida aha strike one in the scriptures jesus went to every little town and village praying and healing the sick and so forth but there was three villages that just didn't believe there's just a bunch of hardheads you know one was bethsaida one's quartz him and one was capernaum where he spent a lot of time so i think it's in matthew 26 i think where he cursed them because you didn't believe cursed be now time went on like nothing's happening 60 years later comes the earthquake and destroys capernaum a bunch of rocks today since 1900 1909 along in there israel's been back and they've been rebuilding everything's been rebuilt there's a there's life everywhere except those three places they know the bible says it believe it so back to the point so i said well what's your other name well my other name is esther well starting right now you are esther you're no more bethsaida but you know they saw this name in the bible that looks pretty good not considering what it meant the meaning behind it and what it represented and so her life started changing you know she got a boyfriend and things worked out okay so be careful what you call your children it makes a big difference we don't call them ricky and elvis and all these crazy names you know because we have a history you know um i know a man he's gone now but uh he was a pastor in venezuela and his name was adolf well you know he lived with it and swallowed hard but um he was in the barber chair one day and there was a rabbi getting trimmed up a little bit so he thought here's my big chance you know they keep records of all these names and so he starts talking with him and he uh you know actually about the name adolf the guy said well it's not in our books we don't wouldn't have nothing to do with the name adolf he said yeah my dad was a big fan of his and that's why he named me and so forth so you know he uh but the interesting thing was after this man been preaching the message for 32 years he was a good friend of mine we we could share shoes and everything you know and um and he was a good preacher but when he got to talking to this rabbi um they got to you know talking they're both preachers you know both with no word and so it all starts telling him yeah you know god sent a prophet wait a minute wait a minute prophets are only for the jews and that turned him right there and he went off eventually got killed just on this man's word after preaching the message for 32 years but we don't blame that on his name but just the fact that uh he didn't have a real revelation apparently you know he could have called one of us and maybe helped a little bit no okay so yeah names mean things um what else you got here why was the meaning of each child from jacob's wives and concubines important well it was god ordained i don't know i wasn't there but they are important quote take heed that you despise not one of these little ones for i say unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven matthew 18 10. what does it mean by their angels well every child from the minutes born has a guardian angel we all have a guardian angel and that's what that means there's an angel that watches after us and that's that's why when you try to make a left turn out of where it only says right turn have we all done it you feel a bit well that's the guardian angel telling you straighten up uh all kinds of situations yeah how did sin come back after the flood well i'm sure there's some real good theologians here but i'm i'm believing it came through one of the wives of you know the daughters-in-law is it considered divorce if an engagement is broken well that depends there's different cases brother bram never dealt with it from the pulpit he said i'll see you in the back room and he discerned the case there are cases where it's admitted and cases where it's not when does friendship become courtship you want to answer that brother paul it's when you want to be closer to her friend is somebody okay see you later but you want you know all you people that have been in love you know that don't you what determines the laws and scriptures we follow from old testament and the ones we don't well some of these things were for the jews only you see and some were carried over into grace i know there's a big argument in some of the people because they well that was old testament we don't have to pay tithes okay go ahead see how your life works out uh we needed a profit to point these things out straighten it up for us and uh that's where the you know the tithing comes in also brother branham addresses the high the higher levels of modesty in the message like don't cut your hair but that doesn't keep some people from you know trimming it and it just keeps coming up and up or not wearing makeup that didn't stop a lot of people but those things are easily understood what about the more gray areas of clothing for boys and girls well if you've got the holy ghost that directs things you know um god made you the way you are whether you're you know seven years old or 95 god made you the way you are but satan is filling the stores so you got to use some sense and some holy ghost to buy what is appropriate but it's amazing at this late date to realize that some people don't know what's appropriate so if you have a problem i'll come back and we'll go shopping but anything that you put on that attracts the eyeballs of the other people you got a problem you know boy or girl over there where i live they call it skinny jeans watch out you're taking people to hell when you dress like that what kind of standard did brother branham expect of his wife and children well he expected holiness and something that's appropriate and he would tell them go back and get dressed you know something that would reflect jesus christ because he you're the only bible some people see i mean you work in the barbershop right all kinds of people come through you're the only bible they're going to read a lot of them and so that's everything everywhere we go we're the only bible you know uh i think i told you on this year before that um francis of assists which the catholic church says is one of theirs but he was a gospel preacher he said preach always that's during all your waking moments you know preach always use words when necessary how does that work well just the way you act the way we acted at the restaurant this morning where just the way you live should preach the gospel but see we're all so smart and we got a cell phone blah blah blah blah blah just zip it let your life live the gospel how does anointing move through music well if you know anything about music it should be obvious now we have a little book on music now the library seems to be in disarray downstairs but if you need a book on music the pastor's wife has one she might let you use for a couple days where rebecca did a very extensive uh research on music in 1991 and we've since put it in a little booklet by itself but it's through the beat you know it's a and then you know you have a piano that's great a couple of guitars we don't we don't need a set of drums because there's only one in a million drummers that know how to play it nicely you know um which happens to be the next question what was brother rem's opinion on drums well pretty much zero never had him don't need them you know was adam created with his theophany in him did something happen to it when he had to leave eden did jesus receive his theophany when he received the holy spirit do we well that's one of those questions that we'll see about later because it's very involved and i don't know quote and the lord god said unto the serpent because you have done this thou hast are cursed above all cattle above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and does shalt thou eat all the days of thy life genesis 3 14. so the question how is it that the cattle and the beasts of the field were cursed it doesn't say that it just says you because what you did you're going to be worse than everything okay so it doesn't say that they're cursed okay the wedding at cana in john two one through five okay let's look at that for a minute it's one of my favorite stories here in john chapter 2 verse 1 through 5 this story was only written in the book of john okay because the four writers were standing in different positions looking at this story looking at jesus life and ministry and they wrote a little differently um it was only written the book of john who types the bride okay thank you for getting into types here it seems like jesus answers her his mother directly and yet look at how she goes right along and tells the servants uh to do you know whatever he says okay so we don't need to get into meanings and what it might have been and what it could have been um but um let's look at chapter where we're at chapter 2 1-12 in the third day there was a marriage in canaan of galilee okay have you ever thought of why it was the third day that is the favorite day for people to get married the third day which is tuesday sunday monday tuesday and they got married on the third day because back in the book of genesis when um you know you know the creation on the first day that's good second day that's good on the third day it's good twice so they chose tuesday's favorite day to get married yeah it's all got a meaning okay so they're having this wedding and the mother of jesus was there and both jesus was called and his disciples to the marriage so they're all invited and when they when they wanted wine the mother of jesus said unto them oh they have no wine and jesus said unto her woman what have i to do with thee mine hours not come in others we don't have a lot of communication right here on this his mother said unto him his mother said unto the servants whatever he says you do it and there was six big water jugs okay these are big big jugs of water uh stone pots and um uh had to do with the purifying and so forth okay so uh containing two or three firth kins apiece that's 150 quarts now those could be you know you can figure it out for yourself but they're big big deals jesus said to them fill the water problems with water okay we'll do that and they filled them to the brim and he didn't pray over it he just said now take out some and give it to the governor the main guy at the feast and they did when the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine and knew not whence it was or where it came from but the servants drew the water they knew then the governor of the feast called the bridegroom and he said hey every man at the beginning of the of the wedding brings forth the good wine and then when you know they're well drunk then he gives out the cheap stuff but you waited until now to give out the good stuff this was the beginning of miracles jesus did it cain regality and manifested both his glory and his disciples believed on him so the whole thing was the turning of the water into wine okay now there's no need to get in here and try to make more of it than it is just read the story and believe it okay so john represents the bride and all these oh fine but we do have the privilege of you know bringing out things from between the lines it's got to be in harmony with what's on the line it can be something you know way out no it's got to be in line with what's there now in um in context of this one time brother branham was serving communion at the tabernacle in jeffersonville and one of the members had a neighbor that was church christ so he was always telling hey you need to come come church with me well so finally one evening the church of christ man said okay i'll go with you tonight well it happened to be communion night okay and at the tabernacle they've always taken the first sunday night of each month okay and so there's closed communion which is just us and then there's open communion which is whoever if they're a believer so they you know say you're a believer so they line up here and so their neighbor and the church christ man which his name was uh i don't know what his name was the believer was named mr hill of the hill so anyway they're standing there and they saw brother neville say to brother branham we're out of wine what should we do brother men didn't get nervous and you know go to the store and buy something he said we'll just pray so he's holding the tray and the new guy he keeps one eye open you know something going on here well the scripture says watch and pray you know so i mean i want to be legal so he um so he watches as brother branham prays simple prayer and he said the little cups filled with wine from nothing over here it was from the water you know but over here with brother bran it was from nothing so he didn't go back to church christ he okay this is for me i'm gonna stay but um no when you read these things in the scripture and like tomorrow lord willing we'll we'll continue with our study in the book of acts of course we could start chapter one because most of we forgot where we were anyway but uh uh we're just you know bringing out the flavor of what's here we don't have to go and imagine and try to mash things together well it's not important god will reveal what you need when you need it okay so that is the extent no no more that's all we have for tonight and um if you aren't happy with the answers well i was here two and a half years ago so uh he might finish the house in the next couple years i'll come back but in the meantime hey brother paul's you know he can straighten out these things anytime he wants uh we're just trying to give you the best of our understanding and from the scripture and be sure and get yourself one of the new churches books it's readable and um lord willing will be here tomorrow so brother paul do you have some things you want to add it's always a privilege to come by here you know it's always interesting as we look into the things of scripture we look into the message uh as we we look at that there is always something that will will you might say reach out to us something that catches our attention and i think about how brother branham kind of presented that to us and you know these things that we would say questions sometimes if i could say this in the correct fashion we would be speaking in a sense of more of a curiosity because these things do not pertain to salvation it's not as though having an answer to that determines whether or not you're going to make the rapture and but yet we as humans and some being you might say more curious than others we tend to you know look at something and the more we look at it the the more we feel like we have to have an answer but the prophet of god said you know if you have a question and and you don't have an answer for it uh he didn't say go obsess over this he didn't say you know uh throw everything else on on the back burner until this is answered the prophet of god actually taught us to put that up on the shelf and just ask the lord lord in your time if you desire open this to me and i can speak on my own behalf that many times when we have placed things on the shelf uh there was a little something and i won't go into it but there was a little something that uh you know was a little sharp question mark i i kept wondering lord why would this be like it is uh brothers uh sisters it had to have been a half a five to six years and i'm sitting in a service uh some meetings that we had went to and i'm i'm hearing the guest minister preaching and he basically is like i don't even know why i'm addressing this and then he proceeded to answer my five or six year old question and when he did and i look back in the scripture perfect sense it just come together so we we just trust you know as it is no man has the answers to the things of god when brother branham come and he opened the word to us my brothers and sisters that was a supernatural god knowing that you in a time in a season in a certain place of your life circumstance would need an answer and and it was all stored up in the word of god but it's stored up in such a way the prophet also says that it's hidden what is clearly before you is actually hidden so the the fact that we can look in the word of god and see these deeper things of the word uh and recognize them is a gift a blessing from god and so i say that to encourage you that if you have a question you don't have an answer for it just hold that up before the lord and say lord if thy will be done if it's a a matter of salvation you can be assured that god is going to answer that but if it's a matter of how does this type fit to this type you might have an answer for that or you might go your whole life but if it's not a matter of salvation then it's really not something to obsess over but we just trust the lord as this scripture says we trust and obey amen and so we have to just come and and try not to make too much i think sometimes as ministers we we can um sometimes maybe type things that because we're believers we have a background we can say okay that that kind of goes together but sometimes i wonder if we're not just creating our own type and we want to be careful about that right that we we don't get outside of the boundaries of the word of god or the message of the hour we stick with what you might say is the known gospel which as brother jason would come and lead us in a few songs the boundaries of the known gospel saints not talking about stomping revelation but the boundaries of the known gospel is sufficient to get you and i in a rapture we don't have to go wandering out in the north 40 we don't have to go climb off in some canyon somewhere to discover something great within the message that will shock us all into some reality it's right here god's promised it he gave it to us and it is fulfilling in our day it is coming to pass right before our eyes and oftentimes we struggle to recognize it's coming to pass because you yourself are fulfilling the prophecy and sometimes it's hard to see ourself in the prophecy as it is unfolding but as this word is promised that in this hour it would produce a bride you see you are fulfilling the prophecy for this hour day by day i always have misquoted that quote of saint what was his name francis of assists but my brother and sister i firmly believe that amen let us live our life let it be a testimony in conversation with brother george he made a reference i i don't know if he was actually at the store at the moment i was talking to him or something but he says these roses they're selling outside of this store they don't have to do anything but be a rose they will bloom because they were meant to the life is in them no one has to tell them rose you bloom it's in them saints let's let this gospel life that's been placed inside of us come forth and bloom because it is already in us we don't have to go find it we just have to yield to the holy ghost let the leadership of the lord lead us into the deeper promises of god what it will take to get you and i in the rapture my brother and sister we've quoted this many times the prophet of god said it's already in you isn't that wonderful we can just let go and let god have his wonderful way brother jason would you lead us in a song or two oh i got it why don't we stand [Music] i always forget that brother george is short and sweet [Laughter] well i guess you can't break him up that's brother george i enjoyed that this evening thank you amen for taking the time let's sing at number
