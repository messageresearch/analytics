[30:04] marching as good
[30:08] with the cross of jesus
[30:13] going on before
[30:20] amen
[30:28] i'm talking about the anointing on the
[30:30] bride in this day
[30:32] is to go forward amen not to stop not
[30:36] turn around not wait for something else
[30:39] he says that the word has already been
[30:43] revealed and we need to move forward
[30:46] in the word amen in that beautiful
[30:49] hallelujah just love that
[30:51] thinking about that amen hallelujah well
[30:54] i just want to speak to you once again
[30:56] on the preparations of the inner man
[30:58] amen we know that the outer man will
[31:00] conform to what the inner man
[31:03] believes right the scripture says from
[31:05] the abundance
[31:06] of the heart the mouth speaks amen the
[31:09] word also
[31:10] tells us that we speak
[31:13] and our flesh obeys amen so
[31:17] our flesh actually is in a very unique
[31:20] position because
[31:21] it is subject to the moving of the
[31:23] spirit and
[31:24] the scripture tells us that the tongue
[31:28] amen is hard to tame and part of that
[31:31] taming my brother and sister
[31:33] isn't vile words it's negative
[31:37] words we have to tame this
[31:40] tongue from our negative
[31:43] speech amen hallelujah
[31:47] well i'd just like to speak to you
[31:49] tonight on complete surrender
[31:51] complete trust amen you see
[31:54] to come to the place that you can have
[31:58] complete trust i'm talking about
[32:02] complete trust
[32:03] not just trust complete trust
[32:08] you have to have a complete surrender
[32:11] because if there's one
[32:13] bit of doubt one bit of fear and we're
[32:16] talking
[32:16] about a a mustard seed a grain of a
[32:19] mustard seed kind of faith
[32:21] now my brother and sister let's let's
[32:24] we'll this sunday we'll go into some
[32:26] some comparisons but
[32:28] if it takes a mustard seed grain of
[32:31] faith
[32:32] to deliver you and i through the word
[32:36] then how little bit of fear it must be
[32:41] that hinders that
[32:44] it's not a whole boatload of fear
[32:47] it only takes a little fear
[32:51] and we're not talking about fear such as
[32:53] we're standing in the jungle and there's
[32:55] a giant lion
[32:57] i'm not even dealing with that kind of
[32:58] fear even though it is relevant
[33:01] i'm talking about that deep underlying
[33:04] question mark that satan would
[33:05] try to put into your life that you would
[33:09] come to a place that you would say well
[33:12] is this right or not
[33:16] you know that's what happens every time
[33:17] you get around a negative spirit
[33:20] it leaves behind its own seeds and they
[33:23] try and sprout
[33:25] hallelujah we need a little spiritual
[33:27] roundup
[33:28] amen hallelujah let's stand and
[33:32] let's read out of luke the fifth chapter
[33:34] verses one through six
[33:36] uh i just prayed tonight that you would
[33:38] just be encouraged a little bit as
[33:40] i was reading my bible uh actually
[33:44] oh i don't know i i have my notes was in
[33:46] my phone but
[33:47] it's been quite a few days uh in the
[33:50] past maybe
[33:51] a week or more that i come across this
[33:54] scripture
[33:55] and uh it struck me so much and i
[33:57] thought lord
[33:58] i just i want to just share this i want
[34:01] it to be an encouragement
[34:03] uh that we could just come to a place
[34:06] that we could
[34:07] latch on to this amen so let's just look
[34:10] at this
[34:11] luke 5 and 1 and it came to pass that as
[34:15] the people pressed upon him
[34:18] to hear the word of god he stood by the
[34:21] lake
[34:22] of genocide and saw two ships standing
[34:25] on the lake but the fishermen were gone
[34:27] out of them
[34:28] and were washing their nets and he
[34:31] entered into one of the ships which was
[34:33] simon's
[34:34] and prayed him that he would thrust out
[34:36] a little from the land
[34:38] and he sat down and taught the people
[34:41] out of the ship
[34:43] now when he had left speaking he said
[34:46] unto simon
[34:48] launch out into the deep and let down
[34:50] your nets
[34:51] for a drought now my brother and sister
[34:54] that's
[34:55] not just a couple fish for the market
[34:58] amen hallelujah
[35:02] now i think all of us would just settle
[35:04] for just a little blessing from god but
[35:06] do you realize he gave to us every
[35:10] redemptive blessing in this book
[35:13] amen do we realize my brother and sister
[35:16] that's a drought
[35:18] that's not just a little portion that
[35:19] god might bless me here and might bless
[35:21] me there and
[35:22] it might be months or weeks or even days
[35:25] before he blesses me again
[35:27] but that's drawing up such a blessing
[35:31] of almighty god that would sustain you
[35:35] and i
[35:35] through every challenge that we face
[35:39] people say well i've got friends that
[35:41] come to this where they said well
[35:42] i've just served and i thought the lord
[35:44] was coming and i thought this was
[35:46] happening and i thought this and i'm
[35:47] just
[35:47] i'm just weary and i'm tired and they
[35:50] quit
[35:52] but god has given us the blessing
[35:55] of substance
[35:59] to keep us every day not just
[36:03] not just you know we look and somebody
[36:05] mentioned the other day well well you
[36:07] know it's been all these years since a
[36:08] prophet left the scene
[36:10] my brother and sister the prophet is not
[36:12] our calendar
[36:15] this is our calendar
[36:18] amen god won't be one moment too early
[36:21] he won't be one moment
[36:23] too late he's an on-time god
[36:26] amen so you know i understand where
[36:29] people are coming from and so don't
[36:31] think that i'm speaking critically of
[36:32] them
[36:33] but brother branham is not our calendar
[36:37] amen hallelujah where was i
[36:44] when he left speaking he said unto simon
[36:46] launch out to the deep and let down your
[36:48] nets for a drought
[36:49] and simon answered answering said unto
[36:53] him
[36:55] master we have toiled all the night
[36:59] and have taken nothing
[37:03] i think there's quite a bit more in
[37:04] those few words right there saints
[37:08] i think somehow for time it got
[37:09] abbreviated
[37:13] we have toiled all night and have taken
[37:15] nothing oh
[37:17] this is the part that made my heart just
[37:19] cry out
[37:22] nevertheless in spite of
[37:26] every excuse everything
[37:29] nevertheless at thy word
[37:32] i will let down the net and when they
[37:35] had
[37:36] this done they enclosed a great
[37:38] multitude of fishes
[37:40] and their net break heavenly father we
[37:43] just ask you
[37:44] this evening come and speak to us lord
[37:47] father we just feel so inadequate to
[37:50] express
[37:50] the things lord our heart the joy that
[37:53] has
[37:54] been placed there and lord we thank you
[37:57] and so inadequate to say thank you lord
[38:00] but in the best of our ability we say
[38:02] thank you lord for your word
[38:05] come and speak to us tonight i pray for
[38:07] every need father
[38:09] those out on the road lord just be with
[38:11] them
[38:12] lead them guide them father strengthen
[38:14] each one i pray in the name of jesus
[38:16] christ
[38:17] amen you may be seated
[38:25] amazing even though i've read this
[38:27] scripture many times this week
[38:30] it's just never fails to stir me saints
[38:33] just to realize that god knowing
[38:37] our human nature so much better than we
[38:40] even know ourselves and that he could
[38:43] come and
[38:45] according to his desire according to his
[38:47] will
[38:48] do the work in our life a life-changing
[38:52] work
[38:52] amen now as we'll look at this
[38:55] we'll see that the people pressed upon
[38:57] him and we'll touch upon this in a few
[39:00] quotes here in just a few minutes
[39:02] that the people pressed upon him my
[39:04] brother's sister that was no
[39:05] casual time in fact the prophet of god
[39:08] says he would have liked to have been in
[39:10] that service
[39:11] amen no casual time as a people pressing
[39:14] why
[39:14] not to just look at him not just to hear
[39:17] the words of his speech
[39:18] but to hear the scripture says the word
[39:21] of god
[39:22] there was a hunger and a thirst in them
[39:24] to hear the word of god and
[39:26] isn't this beautiful because they were
[39:28] hearing the word from the word
[39:30] himself amen and so not a half-hearted
[39:33] approach to coming
[39:35] but a full desire so much so that our
[39:38] lord jesus
[39:39] needs a little space you know we all
[39:41] need a little space and
[39:43] so there he is is he sees the ships and
[39:45] in another place in my studies you know
[39:47] brother branham says
[39:49] that he believed that jesus knew that it
[39:51] was simon
[39:52] he knew who was there he knew whose ship
[39:54] it was and of course
[39:56] we see him call out his name and so you
[39:58] see
[39:59] the fishermen are gone out of the ships
[40:01] and and they've had a night of
[40:04] soaking their nets not catching anything
[40:06] but
[40:07] you see that they're not slothful men
[40:09] and so actually in the cause
[40:11] if you look at this of washing the nets
[40:14] it is not just simply because they're
[40:16] washing them in the very same water
[40:18] that uh they were fishing in so you say
[40:21] well what would washing it do
[40:23] but actually for a fisherman the cause
[40:25] of washing the nets
[40:26] is to remove all of the debris any moss
[40:29] any sticks or anything like that and as
[40:32] they do
[40:33] that they are going through their nets
[40:35] making sure there is no
[40:36] tears they're making sure there is
[40:38] nothing that will fail them at another
[40:41] time afraid
[40:42] deal we've had this a privilege in south
[40:44] america
[40:46] to uh you know being a nation as they
[40:49] are
[40:49] uh with a very close connection to the
[40:51] ocean we've had the privilege of
[40:53] watching
[40:54] watching uh uh many a man going through
[40:56] his
[40:57] nets and working together to spread them
[40:59] out and
[41:00] uh you know patching them up sewing them
[41:03] back together
[41:04] and so you look at this while they were
[41:07] uh
[41:07] totally uh um we use that term in
[41:10] natural life skunk they had no fish to
[41:12] show for it
[41:13] they were still diligent and knew that
[41:15] someday or some time that they would be
[41:17] a need for their nets to be in perfect
[41:20] condition
[41:21] and jesus he gets into the ship and and
[41:24] it was simon ship and he asked him hey
[41:26] look
[41:26] would you just put me out there just a
[41:28] little bit now there are several
[41:30] references where brother branham talks
[41:32] about
[41:32] simon and them looking and saying oh oh
[41:34] there's that
[41:35] healer there's that one they're talking
[41:37] about let's listen to what he's got to
[41:40] say
[41:40] and so we realized that even for simon
[41:43] peter
[41:44] and and the others there was a more of a
[41:46] connection than you might look at on the
[41:49] surface
[41:50] you see they themselves had a hunger
[41:52] they themselves had a thirst for
[41:54] something
[41:55] they needed a touch from the master amen
[41:58] and so
[41:59] he he sets down in the ship and he
[42:02] teaches the people
[42:04] out of the ship and you talk about uh
[42:06] you know how we get so
[42:07] habitual about the way traditional about
[42:10] the way church must be
[42:12] but what if jesus come and said you know
[42:13] what i want you to go over here on the
[42:15] shores and
[42:16] i'm going to set in a boat and you're
[42:18] going to sit on the seashore
[42:19] and we're going to have church would
[42:21] that be too
[42:22] unusual for us i i would pray that it
[42:25] wouldn't be that our traditions and
[42:27] ideas of church
[42:28] and worship wouldn't hold us amen but he
[42:31] sat down and he taught the people
[42:33] amen once again i just have to say this
[42:36] kind of taking from what the prophet of
[42:37] god said
[42:38] that would have been one service that
[42:40] would have been awesome
[42:42] to have been in amen and so
[42:45] when he was done speaking when he was
[42:46] left speaking
[42:48] he says unto simon launch out into the
[42:51] deep and let down your nets for a draw
[42:54] now as we were singing this song here i
[42:56] had to open my notes and
[42:57] and type in the word royal amen because
[43:00] it was there as part of the lyrics
[43:02] of the chorus of the song but he simon
[43:05] answered and said unto him
[43:06] yeah good man good minister good friend
[43:09] good neighbor
[43:16] he was actually from an anointing
[43:19] speaking something maybe much deeper
[43:22] than he even
[43:23] realized it might have has been a sign
[43:26] of his respect for him
[43:28] but little did he know that truly he was
[43:30] speaking
[43:31] to the royal master amen
[43:35] amen the word master in a condensed
[43:38] definition
[43:38] is one of authority or dominance and he
[43:41] says unto him master
[43:46] we have toiled all night
[43:49] and have taken nothing
[43:52] colon space of time
[43:57] i wonder have you ever caught yourself
[44:00] stepping into the excuse mode
[44:05] here's simon oh i believe this was an
[44:08] anointing of god
[44:09] he's fixing to tell him all the reasons
[44:12] why
[44:13] not and something catches him
[44:17] and he then has to stop and there's the
[44:20] pause as you might say
[44:22] from from the punctuation i want to
[44:24] emphasize that
[44:25] he starts to go into the reason why god
[44:28] cannot answer this prayer why this
[44:31] cannot happen why this must not take
[44:34] place
[44:35] he started to step into that mode just
[44:37] like you and i
[44:39] but he caught himself and i pray god
[44:42] catch us lord
[44:43] anoint us to catch ourselves to not step
[44:46] into the mode
[44:47] of the reason why not but to step up
[44:51] and as he was speaking there i believe
[44:54] something caught a holst of him
[44:56] because this word had to come to pass
[45:00] amen something caught him and and he's
[45:02] there
[45:03] nevertheless look at that saints he
[45:07] he's got the rebuttal of what this is
[45:10] and then he stops and says but
[45:12] nevertheless
[45:13] at thy word not what this man thinks or
[45:18] that man thinks or what my little
[45:19] hummingbird fish finder says
[45:21] all of that went away that didn't matter
[45:24] i believe if we'd had modern technology
[45:26] we could have put a boat in the water
[45:28] with a fish finder and we could have
[45:30] drove back and forth there and said
[45:32] simon
[45:33] you're right there's no fish here
[45:40] now if we'd have that technology or
[45:42] they'd have that technology they said
[45:43] look jesus they won't do any good
[45:47] it will do no good to drop our nets in
[45:49] this water because we have just proven
[45:52] but you see that's what he was saying we
[45:54] fished all night
[45:56] we've already went over these waters
[45:59] we've been back and forth
[46:00] we've prayed for this and we prayed for
[46:02] that and we asked for this and we
[46:04] claimed
[46:05] that but nothing happened
[46:08] so it must not be going to happen oh but
[46:12] nevertheless
[46:14] lord you ask us amen you ask us to have
[46:18] faith
[46:19] lord give us nevertheless what my
[46:21] emotion says
[46:23] nevertheless what the neighbor says or
[46:25] the man down the road says
[46:27] or someone halfway across the country
[46:29] says
[46:30] i don't care what they got to say what
[46:32] did god say about
[46:34] it amen and when god says go forward
[46:38] with courage
[46:39] go forward with courage if you don't
[46:41] feel courage
[46:42] stop and say lord let me be just like
[46:44] simon nevertheless lord i'll go forward
[46:46] with courage
[46:48] amen hallelujah i got excited saints
[46:52] when this struck my heart
[46:54] amen i was like yes lord how many times
[46:57] has
[46:57] paul went into the excuse mode
[47:01] lord i can't i can't lord
[47:04] i'm not called to this i'm not capable
[47:07] of this
[47:08] oh lord what about this why not someone
[47:10] else
[47:12] had a brother one time that's been back
[47:14] a few years but he
[47:15] he come through here if i spoke his name
[47:17] you'd all say oh we love him
[47:19] so we'll leave him out conversation
[47:22] and he asked me a question he says
[47:24] brother paul why don't you have more
[47:25] confidence
[47:29] well brother let me start he goes that
[47:31] isn't what i ask you
[47:33] i didn't ask you for your excuses i ask
[47:36] you why you don't
[47:39] and to me the excuse of why i didn't and
[47:42] why i didn't were
[47:43] so directly connected i felt like i had
[47:45] to give the excuse to show the reason
[47:47] why not
[47:50] are you with me amen come on saints i
[47:54] think we all can
[47:55] say amen to this
[47:58] our position and our excuse are so
[48:01] intertwined that we believe
[48:04] somehow they must go together
[48:10] and then the brother said brother paul
[48:11] he said
[48:13] i'm not saying this to lift me up but
[48:14] it's just something that's part of
[48:16] he goes brother paul he said i've
[48:19] listened to your preaching
[48:23] why would you doubt it
[48:26] well let me give you no
[48:32] you see how it comes i'm using this i'm
[48:34] throwing myself under the bus tonight
[48:38] because we have become so intertwined
[48:40] with our reasons
[48:45] when god didn't ask for our reasons
[48:48] he asked us
[48:51] to trust and obey
[48:55] oh my
[49:00] i love this nevertheless i got these
[49:02] reasons but
[49:04] that must have been a good anointing
[49:07] nevertheless
[49:09] thy word now if you were a pessimist you
[49:12] would say well what he just did is he
[49:14] just passed whether this works or not
[49:16] back to jesus
[49:18] did you catch that and some of you
[49:21] thought that's bad
[49:22] but did you know it's actually good
[49:25] because when we stand here and we would
[49:27] say well i
[49:28] i'm a christian i have to do this and
[49:30] then when you fail
[49:32] satan comes right in and says see you're
[49:33] not really a christian or else that
[49:35] wouldn't have failed but you see my
[49:36] brother and sister what god's teaching
[49:38] us is
[49:39] that his word cannot fail his word will
[49:41] not fail
[49:42] and as long as we are trying to catch
[49:44] the fish
[49:48] god wants us to just say nevertheless
[49:50] satan
[49:52] nevertheless satan now i'm going to cast
[49:55] my net
[49:56] into the well of god's word and whatever
[49:59] the lord wants me to catch whatever
[50:01] revelation whatever thoughts
[50:03] whatever anointing that god wants me to
[50:05] have when i draw my neck forward it will
[50:08] have exactly in my neck what god wants
[50:10] it to be amen so you don't have to now
[50:13] come
[50:13] see this is why predestination is much
[50:15] deeper topic than we ever give it credit
[50:17] for
[50:18] because we don't have to make this
[50:19] happen we have to trust the one who
[50:21] already made it happen
[50:23] and when we can surrender to him
[50:26] completely and just say lord
[50:27] i'm done i can't do this no longer but i
[50:30] am going to surrender i'm not
[50:32] surrendering to laodicea
[50:34] see a lot of difference in our
[50:35] surrendering we surrender to laodicea
[50:37] we'll end up looking like laodicea
[50:39] living like louisiana and be judged by
[50:42] laodicea
[50:43] but when we come to the place that we
[50:45] say lord i
[50:46] surrender to you your will be done lord
[50:49] and then you come and faith and trust
[50:52] start to rise up
[50:53] and we get up in the morning and say you
[50:55] know what lord the wheels might fall off
[50:57] the wagon
[50:57] but it won't matter lord you ordained
[51:00] this day
[51:01] and i'm walking in you hallelujah
[51:04] oh because my brother and sister the
[51:06] word of god shows us quite
[51:08] clearly we cannot walk in the flesh and
[51:10] be in the spirit
[51:11] at the same time we're going to make a
[51:14] decision or who
[51:15] we're listening to hallelujah
[51:18] now look i love this in this uh several
[51:20] quotes here tonight and i better rev it
[51:22] up and go because uh
[51:23] i keep shrinking the plate just like i
[51:25] told brother alex
[51:27] i keep springing the plate but the poor
[51:28] paper i gave to him for the service
[51:30] tonight was clear full
[51:32] amen the patriarch abraham and when god
[51:36] now he's talking about abraham but look
[51:38] where he's i'm i'm cherry-picking this
[51:41] you know i had somebody criticize me
[51:42] well you just go and pull a quote out
[51:44] somewhere
[51:45] well my brother and sister if we go on
[51:46] all night all week all whatever
[51:48] i'll read the whole sermon to you to let
[51:50] the one point that i'm trying to make
[51:53] hallelujah we're not here trying to
[51:56] cherry-pick something i hope you know my
[51:58] heart
[51:59] we're not cherry-picking we're not
[52:00] trying to say well the only quote in the
[52:02] whole sermon that says what i want
[52:05] is this one so we'll no it's just we
[52:08] don't really have enough time
[52:10] amen tie all this together lord
[52:14] when god who
[52:18] when god expects who
[52:21] to do a special thing
[52:25] hallelujah lord sign me up special
[52:28] mission
[52:29] behind enemy lines which means right in
[52:32] my
[52:33] community writing my job right whatever
[52:36] right because we're in satan's eden that
[52:38] means you're working behind enemy lines
[52:40] hallelujah he demands a complete
[52:43] separation from
[52:46] why doesn't this say sin
[52:58] come on saints that's right you know me
[53:03] we're not here to make an excuse for our
[53:06] mistakes
[53:08] but do you realize that god through the
[53:10] blood will
[53:11] overlook your mistakes when you repent
[53:13] of them
[53:15] but if you can't get over doubt
[53:20] there's nothing he can do for you
[53:27] he demands a complete separation from
[53:29] any doubt you've got to come to
[53:30] full obedience to obey what he says
[53:34] god kind of ask you pretty please right
[53:39] would you please no the prophet of god
[53:43] said he demands it
[53:45] a demand is very strong it has force
[53:49] and many cases consequence behind it
[53:53] you can't do it no other way and now he
[53:55] always sets an example
[53:56] and that was his example of a complete
[53:59] separation from all of his family
[54:00] talking about abraham now
[54:02] all his kindreds and so forth to walk a
[54:04] life separated to god
[54:06] amen so would god ask any more or less
[54:09] you see if god didn't ask
[54:11] us to walk alive separated to him he'd
[54:13] have to go back and apologize to abraham
[54:17] amen because he asked more of abraham
[54:20] than he asked of us so that means we get
[54:22] a pass
[54:23] doesn't work that way see so we got to
[54:25] have this separated life
[54:26] but look at this my brother and sister
[54:28] it's coming now
[54:30] here when god expects you to do a
[54:32] special thing
[54:33] now look this is just paul's opinion i
[54:34] want to just lay it out that way so
[54:36] nobody goes scrambling looking through
[54:37] the message
[54:38] trying to figure out where i got this
[54:39] idea it just popped in my head
[54:42] but i was called to do a very special
[54:45] thing it started out with a simple
[54:49] request
[54:50] i want you to walk through laodicea
[54:57] amen
[55:00] and i want you to go stomp on every
[55:03] spirit and i want you to just be so
[55:04] perfect that nobody can ever find fall
[55:06] with you
[55:09] no he asked us to walk through laodicea
[55:12] and he said i'll be with you i will lead
[55:15] you
[55:16] and i will guide you you know sometimes
[55:19] the guide doesn't always walk
[55:21] right with you sometimes the guides up
[55:23] on top
[55:24] of the peak or pinnacle saying you're on
[55:27] the right trail keep coming
[55:32] like he's on the other end of the valley
[55:34] of the shadow
[55:35] and you're on this end and he just keep
[55:38] coming
[55:39] you're on the right path
[55:43] lead you guide you said i would never
[55:46] forsake you
[55:47] that would be like the guide happened in
[55:49] colorado quite a few years ago where the
[55:51] man
[55:52] i think the customers were just too much
[55:54] for him and he abandoned him in the
[55:55] woods
[55:58] didn't do his guide service any good
[56:01] his license away he was done as a guy
[56:04] but basically he started talking you
[56:06] know told them what kind of people they
[56:07] were and they said well you know what
[56:09] uh you should have took a different
[56:10] route so god's not going to take us out
[56:13] in the wilderness and abandon said i'll
[56:16] lead you i'll guide you i'll never
[56:18] forsake you
[56:19] i'll be with you wow this is some kind
[56:22] of guide
[56:24] i'll even
[56:27] you guys ever see brother donnie's wolf
[56:29] and sheep deal
[56:31] yeah you know he's talking about how
[56:33] that the wolf in sheep's clothing
[56:35] brother donny you know he's he's almost
[56:37] almost actor quality on some of this
[56:39] i won't do it justice but he's talking
[56:41] about how they're there and the old wolf
[56:43] he gets a hold of that thing
[56:44] he drags it in there and he's like
[57:23] i don't do it justice but the wolf
[57:27] and the sheep's clothing that's not our
[57:30] lord jesus right
[57:31] his spirit is you know what i'm gonna
[57:34] come i'm gonna do a little unzipping
[57:36] i'm gonna do a little unzipping on you
[57:38] but what it is is because i'm
[57:41] climbing inside of you it's no wolf
[57:44] coming
[57:44] into sheep's clothing it's god himself
[57:47] as the prophet of god said god himself
[57:50] in you hallelujah i'm just if i if you
[57:52] don't mind tonight he just comes and he
[57:54] just kind of unzips that right there
[57:57] and says you know what young person you
[57:59] may be just a little girl a little boy
[58:01] but i want to be inside of you i want to
[58:03] just unzip that
[58:04] in the right time in the right season
[58:06] you just open up your heart
[58:08] and your soul to me and i'll just step
[58:10] right inside of you
[58:11] and i'll zip that up so tight but i'm
[58:13] going to seal that zipper
[58:16] nothing else can get in there i've got
[58:19] that spot
[58:20] hallelujah amen you see
[58:24] how beautiful it is my brother and
[58:25] sister and that god
[58:27] is going to come and use you and i for a
[58:30] special thing
[58:31] going on in that special thing walk
[58:33] through laodicea we're going to walk
[58:35] right through laodicea i don't need to
[58:36] go through every little detail even
[58:38] though they're rumbling through
[58:39] my mind my brother and sister one of
[58:40] those special things he called you to
[58:42] is not necessarily just the struggle
[58:44] against the lust of the flesh and the
[58:46] pride of life and all of this garbage
[58:48] here
[58:48] he's called us to a rapture all of this
[58:51] is just what we have to face
[58:52] as he's called us and put us in a
[58:54] rapture and then we look at the book of
[58:56] revelation
[58:57] it so clearly shows that he has called
[58:59] you you're the people of the book
[59:01] amen you're those of the book amen and
[59:04] he's called you to that position
[59:06] and all of this is just the fluff and
[59:09] the struggle that goes with it but the
[59:11] real calling
[59:12] is when you look and you see your name
[59:13] in the book and you can say praise the
[59:15] lord
[59:16] before there was a world he called me
[59:19] and put me here
[59:20] oh i'll tell you what that's where you
[59:22] never get weary in the journey
[59:24] i'm talking about never fall down never
[59:26] give up it's because there's a
[59:27] revelation
[59:28] that's been placed down in your soul
[59:30] that i am in
[59:32] that book amen in fact the lamb's book
[59:36] is a book about me hallelujah some
[59:39] people
[59:39] think that's kind of conceited but my
[59:42] brother and sister it's the truth
[59:43] this is the revelation of jesus christ
[59:47] amen the seventh seal was a revelation
[59:50] of the plan
[59:51] of redemption and so god said what i'm
[59:53] gonna do it's not gonna be for everyone
[59:55] not everybody can understand this not
[59:57] everybody can see this they can read the
[59:59] words they can hear the word
[1:00:01] but they won't spark to life because
[1:00:04] this
[1:00:04] is the revelation i'm giving to you so
[1:00:07] that you
[1:00:08] will know in the darkest of times in the
[1:00:11] valley of the shadow
[1:00:12] that you are a son or daughter of god
[1:00:15] and that holds you up and you have
[1:00:17] strength
[1:00:18] and you say well thank the lord thank
[1:00:20] the lord i i just know it is and what do
[1:00:22] you do you press forward
[1:00:24] hallelujah no going back no laying down
[1:00:26] on the job
[1:00:27] amen my hired man today it was kind of
[1:00:29] funny we're working on a piece of
[1:00:31] equipment
[1:00:32] i'm trying to hold this piece in place
[1:00:34] and there was a deal on the work
[1:00:36] on a step bench outside that we had next
[1:00:38] to this chopper
[1:00:40] and i'm trying to hold this in place and
[1:00:41] i'm trying to reach this deal and i'm
[1:00:43] stretching as far as i can i can't reach
[1:00:45] it
[1:00:45] and so the hired man he comes up he goes
[1:00:47] hey paul he said you remind me of my
[1:00:49] grandson
[1:00:50] and i said really and he goes yeah he
[1:00:52] said i was just at my daughter's house
[1:00:54] this weekend
[1:00:55] and she said whatever his little
[1:00:58] nickname was
[1:00:59] go take out the trash and the little boy
[1:01:02] laid down on the floor
[1:01:03] he said he said i said i saw this he
[1:01:06] said
[1:01:06] mama said you take the trash and the
[1:01:08] little boy laid down on the floor
[1:01:10] and said mama i can't reach it
[1:01:19] come on saints the promise of god
[1:01:23] is not out there the promise of god is
[1:01:26] where
[1:01:28] right here amen don't be laying down i
[1:01:32] can't reach it i can't reach it
[1:01:34] amen i will be with you even in you
[1:01:39] hallelujah amen i laughed till i cried
[1:01:43] hallelujah i thought man that boy is
[1:01:46] smart i never thought of that when i was
[1:01:48] a kid
[1:01:49] of course if i laid down on the floor
[1:01:50] when i was a kid my dad would have come
[1:01:52] right up there with a leather
[1:01:53] belt and just help me reach it
[1:01:57] amen now in the sermon at thy word
[1:02:01] now my brother and sister i thought this
[1:02:03] is so interesting
[1:02:04] that we find this connection right here
[1:02:07] uh brother brown's preaching on this
[1:02:09] topic but
[1:02:10] just the title at thy word amen
[1:02:14] but it's always a happy delight to be
[1:02:16] among god's children
[1:02:17] and i say amen to that and i believe
[1:02:20] that right in this city and right in
[1:02:21] this audience tonight
[1:02:23] there's god's elected children are
[1:02:24] sitting here
[1:02:26] and i have the privilege of being with
[1:02:27] them you know that makes me feel awfully
[1:02:30] good to know that i've just sat with
[1:02:31] sons and daughters of god i say amen to
[1:02:33] that
[1:02:34] and now to the text for just a few
[1:02:36] moments
[1:02:37] i won't keep you just a little bit the
[1:02:40] scripture reading is about jesus they
[1:02:42] said
[1:02:42] they pressed upon him to hear the word
[1:02:45] of god
[1:02:46] my that shows they was hungry
[1:02:50] doesn't it you can't interest
[1:02:53] people for food until they get
[1:02:56] hungry but when they get hungry
[1:03:01] then they can really talk about food
[1:03:05] hallelujah and that's the way it is
[1:03:09] if they don't if you're not interested
[1:03:10] in god you can't talk god
[1:03:12] to people but whenever they get to
[1:03:15] hungering and thirsting after
[1:03:17] righteousness god said
[1:03:18] they shall be filled
[1:03:22] now my brother and sister do you realize
[1:03:23] the word shall there removes
[1:03:25] all negative connotation there is
[1:03:28] no room for potential
[1:03:31] failure
[1:03:35] but first there has to be a hunger and
[1:03:36] thirst you have to really want it
[1:03:41] now saints i put myself on the pew right
[1:03:43] now so no one will think i'm being harsh
[1:03:46] but as a minister you can often see the
[1:03:49] hunger level
[1:03:50] of those you are speaking to it is
[1:03:54] though
[1:03:55] there is a neon sign
[1:03:59] this might scare some of you i hope you
[1:04:01] don't i keep coming to church please
[1:04:03] keep coming to church but i'm telling
[1:04:06] you the truth
[1:04:10] there's a sign sometimes i believe
[1:04:13] honestly if god wanted it done we could
[1:04:15] just speak what you were thinking about
[1:04:18] we could speak of your situation it's
[1:04:21] that real
[1:04:26] let our hunger sign
[1:04:30] come on let our hunger sign be the only
[1:04:34] thing the preacher
[1:04:35] can ever discern
[1:04:38] we have the ability saints i'm not
[1:04:40] speaking down here not speaking negative
[1:04:42] we have the ability to just stop
[1:04:44] and say lord i lay aside every issue
[1:04:48] of today amen
[1:04:52] i'm coming to church because i'm hungry
[1:04:57] and i want to be fit
[1:05:01] to get all emotional about it oh you
[1:05:03] know i really didn't get nothing out of
[1:05:05] church because
[1:05:05] before church i was praying lord you
[1:05:08] know
[1:05:09] give me something in church today and i
[1:05:10] i didn't get
[1:05:13] i didn't get excited so i just
[1:05:17] i just sat through church because this
[1:05:20] must not be my service tonight
[1:05:23] put all that aside put all that aside
[1:05:26] stop at the door back there and say lord
[1:05:30] please erase erase this broken thing
[1:05:33] erase this erase that erase this erase
[1:05:36] that from my thinking
[1:05:39] lord because i'm coming here we've all
[1:05:42] done that
[1:05:44] get invited to someone's house
[1:05:47] come to our house at seven you're used
[1:05:49] to eating at five
[1:05:51] you ate five cheese sticks
[1:05:54] four of them nice tasty
[1:05:58] cookie things that are in the package
[1:06:01] and a few other things and then you go
[1:06:04] and
[1:06:05] you sit down a sister nadia's table
[1:06:08] and you pick at the food
[1:06:12] you know what you told sister nadia
[1:06:19] with a neon sign
[1:06:22] i'm just talking natural right there
[1:06:25] you see my excuse was is if they hadn't
[1:06:29] invited us so late
[1:06:33] i would have been hungry when i got
[1:06:34] there
[1:06:39] as my sister in christ sister nadia i
[1:06:42] love you
[1:06:44] why just a few days ago i was telling
[1:06:46] her that i was going to buy her a
[1:06:47] stepladder so she could climb into a
[1:06:49] pickup
[1:06:52] you know you got to love your friends
[1:06:54] when they will put up with you
[1:06:56] you just have to you just have to but
[1:06:59] you see
[1:07:01] erase that it was sister jerry's table
[1:07:03] no
[1:07:04] but look saints see what what do you
[1:07:06] tell somebody what do you tell a sister
[1:07:08] when
[1:07:08] they've invited you and they've cooked
[1:07:10] the meal and they put hours into this
[1:07:11] and they've made the dessert and
[1:07:13] just pick at it a little bit what do we
[1:07:15] tell god when we come to the house of
[1:07:17] god
[1:07:21] but when they get hungry they can really
[1:07:23] talk about the word
[1:07:26] that's the way it is if they don't if
[1:07:27] you're not interested in god you can't
[1:07:29] talk god
[1:07:30] to the to people but whenever they get
[1:07:32] to hungering and thirsting after
[1:07:33] righteousness god said
[1:07:35] they shall be filled but first there has
[1:07:37] to be a hunger and thirst
[1:07:40] you have to really want it uh
[1:07:43] pardon me my gaff on on i'm trying to
[1:07:45] break that habit of
[1:07:47] of picking on people close to me
[1:07:50] amen but you got to love how the lord
[1:07:54] sets this stage right
[1:07:56] now i i didn't realize i wrote this in
[1:07:58] my notes right here
[1:08:00] i don't have the quote or whatever but
[1:08:01] brother brown says that he's sure that
[1:08:03] jesus knew
[1:08:04] what men or them men were there hungry
[1:08:07] people
[1:08:09] called out people they don't even know
[1:08:10] they're called out in that congregation
[1:08:12] they're pressing
[1:08:13] they're pressing they're pressing
[1:08:14] they're pressing because they want to
[1:08:16] hear the word
[1:08:17] now the prophet of god i don't remember
[1:08:19] i'm just a little brain dead right at
[1:08:20] the moment forgive me
[1:08:21] but you know my brother and sister i
[1:08:23] think it's right here in one of these
[1:08:24] quotes but the prophet of god is talking
[1:08:25] about they didn't come to see him
[1:08:27] they didn't even come to hear his
[1:08:28] theology
[1:08:32] yeah well you know what hungry people
[1:08:34] called out people
[1:08:35] i don't think it's too strange the fact
[1:08:37] that god comes to those who are hungry
[1:08:38] and thirsty amen i think it's just a
[1:08:41] simple
[1:08:42] simple uh understanding of of how god's
[1:08:45] word is
[1:08:46] uh this soul cry of these greeks the
[1:08:49] greeks seek wisdom and jews seek
[1:08:51] signs and paul said we preach christ
[1:08:53] crucified and the greeks has always
[1:08:55] wanted wisdom but these greeks come up
[1:08:57] and perhaps were proselytes the jewish
[1:08:59] religion
[1:09:00] came up to jerusalem to worship at the
[1:09:02] pentecostal feast
[1:09:03] and then while they were up there they
[1:09:05] had heard of the great fame of this one
[1:09:07] jesus of nazareth
[1:09:08] his fame had scattered everywhere many
[1:09:11] disbelieved him
[1:09:13] thousands disbelieved him
[1:09:16] i want you to think about this we live
[1:09:18] in a day
[1:09:19] that almost every single day some form
[1:09:22] of news comes
[1:09:24] about someone you're acquainted with has
[1:09:26] walked away
[1:09:30] and people say well i i i got to
[1:09:33] listening to my
[1:09:34] cousin and my cousin said
[1:09:37] and then i got discouraged so i just
[1:09:39] quit
[1:09:41] and then i went down this is a true
[1:09:43] story saints i'm not making this up and
[1:09:45] then i went down you know and
[1:09:47] and got my hair cut and permed and got
[1:09:50] my nails done because it doesn't matter
[1:09:52] anymore
[1:09:56] okay no problem i won't even make light
[1:09:59] of that
[1:10:01] they're being honest
[1:10:04] they're being honest there's something
[1:10:06] incredible
[1:10:07] about honesty many disbelieved him
[1:10:12] thousands disbelieved him and we knew
[1:10:14] some of them
[1:10:16] but thousands believed him and it was
[1:10:19] mostly among the common people who heard
[1:10:21] him and believed him
[1:10:22] those who were of the other type they
[1:10:24] did not have
[1:10:26] him because they were satisfied with
[1:10:29] their religion
[1:10:31] now i'm telling you if you are hungry
[1:10:34] and you sit down at a table
[1:10:36] i'll tell you and i'm not trying to
[1:10:37] throw any by the bus but i'm just going
[1:10:39] to speak straight these are the
[1:10:40] inspirations that come
[1:10:42] my wife the other night she made
[1:10:44] spaghetti and i come in
[1:10:46] kind of late really late
[1:10:49] and she said well here i still have
[1:10:51] supper for you
[1:10:52] she goes um there's a few regular
[1:10:55] noodles left and there's
[1:10:56] zucchini noodles which do you want
[1:11:02] of course i said zucchini noodles
[1:11:04] because i love zucchini
[1:11:07] in your car
[1:11:12] but you see she was just trying to feed
[1:11:14] me what was best for me
[1:11:17] and so when i sit down at the table i
[1:11:19] look and there's a little dab of real
[1:11:21] noodles and a lot of zucchini noodles
[1:11:24] and i was hungry
[1:11:32] and i ate it so fast i didn't realize
[1:11:34] there was a difference between the
[1:11:35] noodles
[1:11:36] and the zucchini if i had
[1:11:39] not been hungry it might have been a
[1:11:43] different story
[1:11:46] look we've had it right here in this
[1:11:48] church where people want to complain
[1:11:51] sundays you preach too long we want
[1:11:54] every service to be 45 minutes
[1:11:58] we've heard enough word just remind us
[1:12:01] i had quote after quote but i didn't
[1:12:03] want to be negative and i'm not being
[1:12:05] negative now
[1:12:06] but saints i'm telling you
[1:12:09] i'm a big eater i'm a big eater
[1:12:14] hallelujah i used to be naturally a big
[1:12:16] eater
[1:12:19] but i'm a big eater you preached me for
[1:12:22] 45 minutes it better be in a zip file
[1:12:24] that keeps opening up long after i've
[1:12:26] went home
[1:12:29] i'm not interested in just some little
[1:12:31] thing some little blip or some little
[1:12:33] whatever
[1:12:33] i'm sorry saints it's too close to the
[1:12:35] end of the race
[1:12:37] to settle for just a little nibble
[1:12:40] amen hallelujah i remember one time i
[1:12:43] just have to tell you the story we were
[1:12:44] eating at some folks home
[1:12:46] house and there they were a little more
[1:12:47] well off than they were by about five
[1:12:49] thousand times more
[1:12:50] but anyway uh we're there and and
[1:12:52] they're gonna serve us you know they
[1:12:54] said oh we're gonna have some steak and
[1:12:56] we're gonna have some things and a
[1:12:58] little shrimp and i'm like
[1:12:59] this is good so they come out and served
[1:13:02] like one shrimp on every one of our
[1:13:03] plates
[1:13:05] and then my steak i thought this has got
[1:13:07] to be just a scrap that they trimmed off
[1:13:09] of this thing where's the real steak
[1:13:11] coming
[1:13:13] but it wasn't and then we had salad
[1:13:16] which i thought was in reverse because
[1:13:17] you always feed
[1:13:18] salad to your guests so they won't eat
[1:13:19] as much as everything else
[1:13:23] and a little dinky salad and then they
[1:13:25] had some cheesecake
[1:13:27] and i looked at that and i went and it
[1:13:30] was gone
[1:13:34] now i'm not saying that brother wasn't a
[1:13:36] man but that wasn't a man's meal
[1:13:41] a real man eats a real
[1:13:44] amount of food hallelujah
[1:13:47] we don't look at it the beauty of it
[1:13:51] is nice sister jerry won't even remember
[1:13:54] this occasion but later she said that
[1:13:56] was such beautiful food i wanted to take
[1:13:58] a picture but it might offend them so i
[1:14:00] didn't
[1:14:01] well i wish you would have so i could
[1:14:02] have held it up and said see this was
[1:14:04] called a meal
[1:14:07] and saints getting up and reading a
[1:14:08] quote and telling you all gonna make a
[1:14:11] rapture
[1:14:12] singing a few songs and leaving is not a
[1:14:15] meal
[1:14:16] it's not a meal mature christians have
[1:14:19] moved
[1:14:20] from the milk to the meat
[1:14:24] and not where the little dish is it said
[1:14:26] where the carcass and i'm sorry to tell
[1:14:28] you
[1:14:28] it was one whole carcass for me
[1:14:32] you claim whatever you need for you
[1:14:34] right it's right there in your grass you
[1:14:36] can train
[1:14:37] a little trimming or you can go for a
[1:14:39] carcass i want a carcass
[1:14:41] hallelujah amen
[1:14:45] but thousands believed him and it was
[1:14:48] mostly among common people
[1:14:50] blah blah blah let me catch where i'm at
[1:14:51] amen they did not have much time for him
[1:14:53] because they were satisfied with their
[1:14:54] religion
[1:14:55] and they had now i want to make emphasis
[1:14:57] this because coming on this sunday we're
[1:14:59] going to dive into something
[1:15:00] uh that's going to be a kind of direct
[1:15:02] and and whatnot
[1:15:04] and have the religion
[1:15:07] tied right in the middle of it that
[1:15:09] father's been taught certain things and
[1:15:10] there and they
[1:15:11] had their traditions handed down now
[1:15:14] look saints
[1:15:15] i wanna i might not make it through
[1:15:17] tonight that's fine
[1:15:20] if you find yourself moving into a
[1:15:23] tradition in grace tabernacle shake
[1:15:26] yourself
[1:15:28] shake yourself we're not here
[1:15:31] for whatever reason god chosen and
[1:15:33] sometimes it's just beyond my
[1:15:34] comprehension
[1:15:35] i'm a pastor of a church but you see
[1:15:39] this man right here is not
[1:15:42] here to impose tradition we must do
[1:15:45] this this is the only way we do it
[1:15:50] what we need to everyone be lifting our
[1:15:52] hearts our spirit will be crying out
[1:15:54] holy spirit lead
[1:15:55] us lord lead us i want you to lead me
[1:15:59] and guide me to
[1:16:00] all truth lord don't no church don't let
[1:16:03] no ideology don't let nothing hinder me
[1:16:06] because my brother and sister tradition
[1:16:08] is taking a foothold
[1:16:10] in our belief amen
[1:16:15] you can't be led oh yes i'm kind of
[1:16:18] putting
[1:16:18] a couple quotes together but i believe
[1:16:20] they have a continuity you can't be led
[1:16:22] of the spirit
[1:16:23] and be bound to tradition it's an
[1:16:26] impossibility won't happen
[1:16:29] will not happen amen their traditions
[1:16:32] handed down something new no matter how
[1:16:34] phenomenal it was well
[1:16:36] he tried to tell him it was in
[1:16:37] scriptures that he was to come
[1:16:39] oh well well they if he was to be the
[1:16:41] person the priest would know something
[1:16:43] about it
[1:16:44] therefore they wasn't interested
[1:16:48] see that's what's happening in the world
[1:16:49] my brother and sister
[1:16:51] amen i had someone here recently asked
[1:16:53] me why we needed to take
[1:16:55] everything back to the word
[1:17:01] flabbergasts you you don't even know how
[1:17:02] to answer a question like that
[1:17:04] statement question however it is don't
[1:17:07] even know how to answer that
[1:17:08] when the prophet go home tonight if you
[1:17:10] have time tomorrow whatever
[1:17:12] type it into go online if you don't have
[1:17:15] the the
[1:17:16] program in your own computer go online
[1:17:18] and write to voice of god
[1:17:19] use theirs type in there about how many
[1:17:22] times brother brown says take it back to
[1:17:23] the bible take it back to the word the
[1:17:25] words are absolute the bibles are
[1:17:26] absolute
[1:17:27] look how many times he says that and
[1:17:29] then someone who's a believer of the
[1:17:31] message
[1:17:32] comes and says why do we need to take it
[1:17:33] back to the word brother branham's
[1:17:35] vindicated
[1:17:37] it ain't got nothing to do with brother
[1:17:38] branham i need to be eating the word
[1:17:42] amen so when i take it back to the word
[1:17:44] saints i go back to the word hope you
[1:17:46] can see the symbolic side of this
[1:17:47] when i go back to the word i come back
[1:17:50] to the word
[1:17:51] if i'm looking to prove something i've
[1:17:53] got the wrong spirit the wrong attitude
[1:17:55] but if i go back to the word and i start
[1:17:57] reading the word let's just read the
[1:17:59] word on baptism oh i start reading the
[1:18:01] word
[1:18:01] oh okay okay okay
[1:18:05] oh let's talk about what it is there was
[1:18:08] a there was a certain ministry went
[1:18:10] some time back started kind of preaching
[1:18:12] for a while until it got they kind of
[1:18:13] got squished on it
[1:18:14] but they were preaching that we were
[1:18:16] once angels
[1:18:20] well i went back to my bible and i just
[1:18:22] simply couldn't find where i was
[1:18:24] once an angel
[1:18:29] that's why we go back to our bible it
[1:18:31] ain't got nothing to do with whether
[1:18:32] brethren being a prophet or not
[1:18:35] this is me reading the word feeding on
[1:18:37] the word and then the word comes
[1:18:39] and everything i need at the moment is
[1:18:41] in that word
[1:18:42] and then it comes and strengthens me
[1:18:45] amen
[1:18:46] hallelujah go ahead eat the pedal off
[1:18:49] the bicycle if you need to
[1:18:52] amen hallelujah
[1:18:55] hopefully i'm not being too pushy
[1:18:56] tonight are we okay saints
[1:18:59] amen i just think there comes a time we
[1:19:01] have to just kind of be a little direct
[1:19:02] about some of these things
[1:19:05] because if we don't well after a while
[1:19:08] we don't stand for something we'll fall
[1:19:10] for anything and everything
[1:19:12] amen
[1:19:17] but these greeks when they heard faith
[1:19:19] cometh by hearing hearing of the word of
[1:19:20] god
[1:19:21] they come seeking jesus and i believe
[1:19:24] has been the
[1:19:25] heart's cry of every man and every woman
[1:19:27] who's ever heard anything
[1:19:29] about jesus christ has had that same
[1:19:31] thing
[1:19:32] sir we would see jesus they didn't want
[1:19:35] to learn his theology
[1:19:41] amen think about it saints a lot of
[1:19:43] theology preached
[1:19:46] we're not here for theology i'm here for
[1:19:48] a life-changing event
[1:19:50] i'm here for the power of the word to
[1:19:52] come into my life
[1:19:53] to come into your life to shed
[1:19:56] everything that could possibly hinder us
[1:19:58] amen oh i tell you what nobody likes the
[1:20:00] sound of a weed eater in church
[1:20:03] but we need that we need these things
[1:20:06] cut away
[1:20:06] we need it pruned we need to cut back
[1:20:09] amen
[1:20:11] sir we'd see jesus they didn't want to
[1:20:12] learn his theology they didn't care
[1:20:14] nothing about his teachings
[1:20:16] they didn't care about whether he what
[1:20:18] kind of clothes he wore
[1:20:19] they were only interested in one thing
[1:20:21] that they wanted
[1:20:23] to see jesus that's the main thing
[1:20:26] and that's the cry of today
[1:20:30] see lest we would interpret what brother
[1:20:31] branham's saying there
[1:20:33] incorrectly he's encouraging you not to
[1:20:36] worry about theology
[1:20:38] he's encouraging you not to look at
[1:20:41] teaching
[1:20:43] think about this why would he do that
[1:20:47] because he's already made the promise to
[1:20:49] lead you and guide you
[1:20:51] into all truth amen
[1:20:55] so i don't know if we'll get to it or
[1:20:56] not but a few quotes about when you're
[1:20:58] walking in the things of the lord you
[1:21:00] don't know no danger you don't know no
[1:21:01] fear
[1:21:02] amen god's already made the promise to
[1:21:04] you to lead you to guide you
[1:21:06] amen that's why we don't walk as timid
[1:21:08] christians
[1:21:10] amen hallelujah
[1:21:16] so in the message faith and it's
[1:21:20] actually retitled kind of african trip
[1:21:22] report brother brown talks about that
[1:21:24] trip a lot in the in the sermon
[1:21:26] this is a word i will leave with you
[1:21:28] look at those fishermen we're back to
[1:21:30] our original topic
[1:21:32] just a moment look at them toiled all
[1:21:34] night
[1:21:35] through the lake they were fishermen
[1:21:37] they knowed the change of the moon
[1:21:39] they know the time of the waters they
[1:21:42] had seemed
[1:21:43] seined all night commercial fishermen
[1:21:47] and taken nothing what a discouraging
[1:21:50] time
[1:21:52] gone out and washing their nets sitting
[1:21:54] down on the bank
[1:21:56] let's drama just a minute i love this
[1:21:59] see this is my justification for laying
[1:22:01] on the floor
[1:22:05] let's drama just a minute look coming
[1:22:08] under
[1:22:08] i see a young man in his thirties coming
[1:22:11] walking down the bank
[1:22:12] i'm i imagine he looked a lot older
[1:22:15] because he said his ministry was so
[1:22:16] strenuous on him
[1:22:18] come walking down the bank two or three
[1:22:19] men walking with him and
[1:22:21] i can look away back up on the hill
[1:22:23] along there at the fishermen
[1:22:26] scenes along that they say there is that
[1:22:29] prophet of galilee
[1:22:30] let's go down and see what he will say
[1:22:32] they gathered up to the bank and
[1:22:35] i look lay setting on a log up there and
[1:22:38] there's simon and them
[1:22:39] washing their nets discouraged they
[1:22:41] pressed upon him
[1:22:42] to hear the word of god
[1:22:46] and he said can i use your moment just
[1:22:48] your boat just a moment
[1:22:50] he jumped got in the boat and they
[1:22:52] pushed out a little bit
[1:22:54] then after he got through speaking he
[1:22:55] said come here simon you all
[1:22:58] look at these words saints
[1:23:03] come here simon and you all god never
[1:23:07] borrows
[1:23:07] nothing from you unless he pays you for
[1:23:10] it
[1:23:12] think about it if god asks
[1:23:16] something of you let's not get carnal
[1:23:20] run off with this but if god asks
[1:23:23] something of you he has something
[1:23:27] he's going to give to you
[1:23:30] god never never never leave you lacking
[1:23:34] for the presence from the presence
[1:23:38] of the holy ghost in your life never
[1:23:41] leave you lacking unless you think
[1:23:43] not going to bars and singing karaoke is
[1:23:45] a loss
[1:23:50] if you think dancing is a loss then
[1:23:53] you're going to think god took something
[1:23:54] from you
[1:23:56] but once delivered from that my brother
[1:23:58] and sister
[1:24:00] once delivered to that a true holy ghost
[1:24:03] deliverance
[1:24:04] you will look at that and thank god that
[1:24:06] it's left
[1:24:08] never consider it as loss
[1:24:11] amen i love this this strikes my heart
[1:24:13] right here god will never
[1:24:15] take anything never borrow any nothing
[1:24:17] from you unless he pays you for
[1:24:21] is that right he said come here now
[1:24:22] thrust out in the deep and let down to
[1:24:24] take the whole drought of fish
[1:24:26] simon said now lord we've seen through
[1:24:28] these waters all night we haven't taken
[1:24:30] a fish we caught nothing
[1:24:32] we know we know
[1:24:36] we're fishermen we know this sea we were
[1:24:39] raised here
[1:24:40] see here is why i made the statements i
[1:24:42] did earlier
[1:24:44] about how you come to a point and you
[1:24:46] speak up
[1:24:48] negative this is why i can't
[1:24:51] this is why i can't find joy in my life
[1:24:53] this is why i can't find deliverance
[1:24:54] this is why i can't do this that's why i
[1:24:56] can't step out in faith this is what
[1:25:00] because i was raised in a family that
[1:25:02] had no faith
[1:25:03] it's a reason i can have faith
[1:25:06] i was raised in a family it was this way
[1:25:08] that's why i got a temper
[1:25:10] that's why i got a buzz saw i'm irish
[1:25:12] and my daddy and my grandpa and my great
[1:25:15] grandpa and it just goes right on back
[1:25:16] we're all just like this
[1:25:19] okay nevertheless
[1:25:26] we're fishermen we know this sea we're
[1:25:28] raised here our fathers was raised here
[1:25:30] as we take
[1:25:30] we've taken nothing from it there's just
[1:25:32] no fish in that water
[1:25:35] oh my but nevertheless that thy word i
[1:25:39] will let down the net
[1:25:41] there you are and when he let the net
[1:25:44] down
[1:25:44] it finally fell down begin to pull and
[1:25:47] tug when he pulled the fish as you begin
[1:25:48] to feel them flopping
[1:25:51] look at these few lines some of you
[1:25:52] always cheat i just know you do you've
[1:25:54] outread me
[1:25:57] it's all right i i hope no one ever
[1:25:59] takes that serious i'm just
[1:26:01] where'd they come from how did they get
[1:26:05] there
[1:26:06] if there was no fish in the water taking
[1:26:09] god
[1:26:10] at his word will bring fish in the water
[1:26:14] i believe that saints i tell you i could
[1:26:18] just tonight just bore you to details of
[1:26:20] things in our
[1:26:22] life that have looked like they was no
[1:26:24] way it could change
[1:26:26] and god come on the scene amen and i'm
[1:26:30] i'm talking in some carnal things you
[1:26:32] know business type things and
[1:26:34] i'm also talking in the natural in
[1:26:36] healing
[1:26:37] and it just seems impossible and god
[1:26:39] comes on the scene
[1:26:41] amen and tell me you just
[1:26:44] take god at his word he'll bring the
[1:26:47] fish
[1:26:48] i want to ask you tonight what's your
[1:26:49] fish what is your fish
[1:26:52] i'm not even going to pretend that i
[1:26:54] would even look deep enough to know what
[1:26:56] your fish is
[1:26:57] but if you need a fish tonight amen you
[1:27:01] take god at his word
[1:27:02] he'll put that fish in your neck
[1:27:04] hallelujah
[1:27:06] amen now i hope you guys don't mind
[1:27:10] this is not a quote by brother branham
[1:27:13] some people get all shook up had a
[1:27:16] message believer tell me that
[1:27:18] these people that are quoting spurgeon
[1:27:19] and tozer and whatnot are backslid
[1:27:23] so if you all feel that way then i'll
[1:27:25] stand right here and tell you
[1:27:26] backslid but i believe what this guy
[1:27:27] wrote and he wrote this a long
[1:27:30] long long long time ago
[1:27:34] happy is a man who possesses a bible
[1:27:37] happier still is he who reads it
[1:27:41] happiest of all is he who reads it
[1:27:44] and obeys it yeah i think that was
[1:27:47] worthy of quoting
[1:27:49] amen hallelujah my
[1:27:52] oh my well
[1:27:56] do we stop or do we go sister emmy will
[1:27:59] you come
[1:28:02] just one quote but there's a lot of
[1:28:04] narrative goes with this one quote
[1:28:10] oh well we only live once
[1:28:16] but there is something about it when you
[1:28:17] really you are really determined
[1:28:19] god is revealing himself you're
[1:28:21] determined to see christ
[1:28:23] there is no danger before you you don't
[1:28:26] even pay any attention
[1:28:31] the doctor says you're going to die you
[1:28:33] don't even notice it
[1:28:34] when you are pressing you know there is
[1:28:37] something there
[1:28:39] something down in your heart burning
[1:28:40] faith in this god
[1:28:42] blank spot on the tape three months this
[1:28:45] talking
[1:28:46] about queen of the south she's coming
[1:28:49] she's got a goal she's going to find
[1:28:51] something
[1:28:52] there's something in her heart i like
[1:28:54] how brother branham brings this
[1:28:57] something down in her heart burning
[1:28:58] faith in this god
[1:29:00] three months to travel over sahara
[1:29:02] desert not in an air-conditioned
[1:29:04] cadillac
[1:29:05] no no she took three months across the
[1:29:07] sahara desert
[1:29:08] maybe traveling by night reading the
[1:29:10] scrolls near oasis in daytime
[1:29:12] until she arrived now no wonder jesus
[1:29:14] said she'll stand on the last days and
[1:29:16] condemn this generation
[1:29:17] for some of them won't walk across the
[1:29:19] street
[1:29:22] wow i mean the word of god says that
[1:29:24] she'll raise up in that day
[1:29:27] and judge that's not even a message
[1:29:30] thing saints
[1:29:32] that's a bible thing talking to a guy
[1:29:34] the other day said oh i really love
[1:29:36] these god things and then contradicted
[1:29:38] god in this
[1:29:39] thing and i thought no you can't have a
[1:29:41] god thing you were lucky enough to find
[1:29:42] this and that and buy it cheap
[1:29:45] and you say that's a god thing and then
[1:29:46] you turn around the word of god and
[1:29:48] throw it in the ditch no you can't have
[1:29:50] both
[1:29:52] you can't have both saints oh no wonder
[1:29:55] jesus said she'll stand the last days
[1:29:56] and condemn this generation
[1:30:00] and a greater than solomon is here the
[1:30:02] holy spirit himself see
[1:30:03] no wonder she'll rise in the last days
[1:30:05] and condemn the generation now watch
[1:30:07] she finally arrived she didn't come like
[1:30:10] many people
[1:30:11] some people come to a strange meeting
[1:30:13] she come and took her camels and went
[1:30:14] out in the courtyard and put up her
[1:30:16] tents
[1:30:16] she's going to stay there until she was
[1:30:19] convinced
[1:30:21] hallelujah didn't get up run away at the
[1:30:23] first words that
[1:30:24] shook her up the first thing she didn't
[1:30:26] like she stayed there until she was
[1:30:28] convinced
[1:30:29] another place in the message brother
[1:30:30] brown said she was going to stay there
[1:30:31] until she was convinced
[1:30:33] either it was right or it was wrong
[1:30:35] hallelujah
[1:30:37] you know you can't fault anybody for
[1:30:38] saying i just can't see this
[1:30:41] right you fold them don't judge them
[1:30:44] that they can't see it because
[1:30:45] you should stop pray for them that's
[1:30:48] right the prophet of god said you should
[1:30:50] pray for them
[1:30:51] amen have empathy or sympathy for them
[1:30:54] pray for them but you ought to be
[1:30:56] thanking god that your eyes see
[1:30:59] and your ears here amen because my
[1:31:02] brother and sister
[1:31:03] a complete total
