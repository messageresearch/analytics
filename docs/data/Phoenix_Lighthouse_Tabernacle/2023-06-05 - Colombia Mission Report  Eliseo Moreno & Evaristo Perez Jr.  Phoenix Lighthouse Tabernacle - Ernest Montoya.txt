branded but there's one thing I do for getting those things which are behind and Reaching Forward onto those things which are before press towards the mark for the price of the High Calling of God in Jesus in Christ Jesus you may take your seeds Brothers as you all know um the last week I think so uh um we visit our brothers who are over there and this time Brothers I think that because my brother didn't go with me [Music] I had to speak on Wednesday and also on Thursday so um and so my nerves were going crazy but thanks to God the work was done [Music] [Music] to put all things aside and focus on one thing sometimes many times problems come what the Lord wants us to understand I believe that it happens to many of us but the most important thing of all please [Music] [Music] the youth is something I wanted to prepare them there was an activity of great importance but this activity wasn't going to happen until Saturday but I wanted to prepare them for that activity and so what I did is we place ourselves in a circle and we started talking one with another things such as how we are and other stuff I mentioned to them one thing I told them on Saturday we'll be taking we'll be doing an activity and what I want you to do is within yourself I said I don't know what you're going through what's something that you've been struggling with for one reason or another you haven't been able to overcome that is and thereafter singing and doing other activities I left I left them with that is the picture showing we had a men's meeting uh [Laughter] I didn't feel so much that he but I was able to see here foreign [Laughter] but thank God it was it informed my lot to speak [Music] I believe I believe was the one who spoke and afterwards our pastor spoke truly there was a jubilee is God manifests himself in a very great way is what they came looking for and he did a prayer and God did the work we wanted to start with the activity is the um [Music] I wanted to let them Let it Loose a bit [Music] if you continue with the presentation there's a picture of where some of the young people are playing a game and what happened here is we had plans to do it outside what happened is it started raining [Music] in our pasture parade and the rain went away is since we were already inside the sanctuary we did an activity you have to stack up a tower the youth was really excited is the competition competing one against another yes so it was very beautiful to see that then came to what we went there for um what I asked them to do is a piece of paper with a lead pencil or a pen is there was more youth that I spoke on last time and Don says so I told them once again he says I want everybody who's in the sanctuary says look for a corner with your arm length away is the Delta Persona from another person is the reason is that I want you to see what the other person is going to write down within yourself um I don't want you to just think like oh maybe I don't have such a good friendship with so and so no no no I want you to go deeper than that I want you within yourself look for that which for you have cried for night after night yeah and you have asked foreign and you feel like there's no solution I want you to write that down on the paper this is if you could feel what I felt in that sanctuary it was very impactful this was after everyone finished what they were writing down um uh for them I asked the brother to start a fire is because we're going to go outside we're going to make marshmallows or s'mores outside that's not what we're going to do with the fire um so I asked everybody does everybody have their piece of paper um [Music] and this one [Music] and we attached a piece of paper that explained and the youth were very thankful um you can go to the next one um here's a video foreign as they put it in the fire from this moment on you were going to be different and so then we all went outside is one by one yeah we started to throw in their paper in the fire yeah and brother if you could see their face there were some that were crying and there were some people that couldn't conceal their emotions way s the youth were extremely blessed as we finished I spoke a little bit and I told them this uh NSA from now on is this which you place in the fire it will no longer be something that will affect you from now on aura is it now the devil will come back to tell you this and that see yes he will don't bother me anymore and so we started to pray after praying uh there was one young man the young man was kind of scratching his head a bit um to cry or laugh or get mad [Music] brother are you all right he tells me brother I can't believe it what happened brother he says I can't believe that that was it says all of this year that I've been struggling with this yes he says and that's all I had to do okay yes brother but what is it that happens wants to make us wants to make he wants to make us think that it's something that's really difficult to in order to overcome that is they have to stop doing this that and the other and by the time you stop doing all those things then it's going to be impossible in our mind but why is [Music] the devil wants to keep us in that square because he knows once we leave there yeah so we understand who we are you will no longer have control of us thank you brother yeah God has blessed you this evening and after that Brothers on Sunday after the service um we got together once again with the with the youth please continue [Music] El Faroe Department [Music] saludos I believe this one's also a video [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] what's an event in your life that made an impact in your life foreign we already answered all the questions well what about you so I had to speak a little bit they asked me the questions that I initially asked them I answered them is please continue with the next line next one please [Music] foreign [Music] I believe one of them is a video [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Applause] [Music] [Music] it was extremely large pizza it was about a pizza box and it was a mountain [Music] if they could please testify about anything they experienced or anything they saw on Saturday it was truly great truly God is doing something he and there's a thankfulness in me a Thanksgiving in me that God has given us that opportunity to be part of that so um I want to give the glory the honor and glory to our Lord Jesus Christ [Music] what God will do in the time to come um God bless you [Applause] thank you foreign foreign it's already been several times and we've been over there when I believe that when I get there and I see the brothers I see them and they're so familiar foreign it's much greater than the natural that's why we identify ourselves with the brothers uh Houston we flew from here to Houston the Houston from Houston it's some hours we do almost a day to get there director as soon as people ask why don't you get a direct flight it says when you know how to do things and I'm not saying it because I say because of my past the teaching that he has where we come from we come from an Apostolic teaching and that is what we're standing on that's right you can say well yeah that's what they told brother he went beyond the curtain of time with what our Apostle said brother that sounds like heresy that is the word of God there's a condescendence then you can stand firm on what you believe and you know that what's been taught to you that is the truth there was a witness that's all the Miracles none of us were here there maybe none of us but there was people of confidence he says they were loyal that they were instructed because people have been loyally appreciate anybody but we're trusting in that which we have believed so we're right almost arriving would you want to go change because we have to go to church it was a youth service good thing it was foreign Torres the next day we went to another city you say brother how far is it it's about an hour for me it always feels like two hours I don't know why they say an hour the pastor from there is like just like we point to our Apostles a man who was Faithfully in foreign know what kind of man he is when you're on vacation you're relaxing maybe you change your way of being or your attitude it stands firm each time he doesn't go fall back not even an inch and he's an example to me so if I can go and support him being by his side for me it's I'm proud to do that also went as well developed a friendship with him along the years I have seen him pray for people in Miracles there was a brother who was he was twitching in pain we were in the cemetery and his wife arrived she was desperate my husband can't take the pin anymore he has a pain in his kids the brother was crying because I know what it feels like I've had that pace it's an unsupportable place it was a very simple prayer but God healed him in the instance we have the best and the young people are here don't be surprised that your pastor calls you to be ready so you know that there's other young people who are also fighting they want to get to know they want to know what is it that you do you want to know what's the secret you have to be Overcomers because the simple Act of sitting here the young people there's so much temptation is that each one of you maybe you're not able to see it once you get older you can see it clearly because the world the simple act that you're sitting here that means that we've gotten to know over time and I exchanged it with a brother and I put it in honor of the brothers but his name is Orlando yes and I really appreciate him and I've had quite the friendships foreign Hermano Hermano When you pray for people foreign and he didn't say anything he just left Amigos one of my one of my friends came they said he says welcome to the club because when you do something for God the enemy is not going to stay still that's what we think each one of you for your prayers everything anything you might need is a living God you have to go out to be able to see God in action that's what God wants in each one of you I know you already studied and that doubt begins to leave finish a in the message he that is in you remember that the topic was testifying what is within you this is foreign is a difference and that's what's called Fool's Gold this is it's not even worth as much as the rock that it's in this is It's called iron pirate it's Pirates it's the same as gold it looks like it shines and I think the scientists claim that the waters and the leaking acids and things never got there quite enough to harden it and bring it into place to make it gold I'm going to repeat it once again just the scientists claim that the waters Los Angeles and the leaking acids it causes and things never got there quite enough but okay because there's places where you give people things well it's nice but I wanted another color you know what I refer I'm referring to that when someone is grateful from the heart then you feel very comfortable yes it's exactly what a brother called spoke on this morning they weren't able to withstand enough pressure they were they weren't able to stand enough trials and it only shines so it shines better this is to take out what's within you must be pressure after pressure after tribulation foreign asking for you to remove the trials don't take them away just gave us the strength to be able to overcome them if there's a person here tonight they're struggling or going through trials may they not be disappointed they know that with that pressure they will bring out what's within them we're just waiting for that is there is nothing but Jewels because they bring out what's within them thank you Father gracias thank you for everything amen [Music] [Applause] and yours mind that you yeah [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
