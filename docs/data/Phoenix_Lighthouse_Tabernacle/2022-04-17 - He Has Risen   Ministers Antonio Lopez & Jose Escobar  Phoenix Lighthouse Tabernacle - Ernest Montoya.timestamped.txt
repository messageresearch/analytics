[29:18] [Music]
[29:38] hello
[29:48] [Music]
[30:07] in
[30:08] [Music]
[30:31] it's a pleasure to be here in the house
[30:32] of the lord
[30:47] 11 25.
[30:59] let's take advantage of the time and
[31:02] thank god for this opportunity
[31:06] and our pastor
[31:11] and every single one of you
[31:14] for being here in the house of the lord
[31:26] and it reads
[31:29] jesus said unto her i am the
[31:32] resurrection
[31:33] and the life
[31:34] he that believeth in me
[31:36] though he were dead yet
[31:39] he shall live
[31:41] jesus
[31:48] and whosoever liveth
[31:50] and believeth in me shall never die
[31:53] believe it
[31:58] me
[32:29] and resurrecting lord
[32:33] father if there's anything that's
[32:35] hindering us this evening
[32:55] so we can have a good fellowship in thy
[32:57] word
[33:01] in the name of our lord jesus christ
[33:05] amen amen you may be seated brother
[33:07] puento mastos
[33:13] we have a special subject we're going to
[33:16] be speaking
[33:20] the title of the subject is he has risen
[33:32] we're going to speak a little bit of
[33:35] the lord jesus christ
[33:42] so as you see here
[33:46] when
[33:47] jesus before before he resurrected
[33:50] jesus
[34:00] god revealed to him what he had to do
[34:04] is
[34:32] and he wanted to do his father's will
[34:36] amen amen
[34:39] so it's it's the same thing with us
[34:42] when we're
[34:43] right
[34:44] here in this in this earth
[34:53] have eternal life with the lord jesus
[34:54] christ
[34:57] we have to go through what the lord
[34:59] jesus christ went through as well
[35:04] everybody has different things they have
[35:06] to take away from their lives
[35:11] and
[35:12] it's typical to take those things away
[35:15] from yourself
[35:18] nobody's going to do it for you
[35:21] god is not going to do it for you
[35:24] you have to make that decision
[35:27] so
[35:28] whenever you pray to god
[35:31] ask for strength
[35:33] don't ask for him to remove what needs
[35:35] to be done
[35:39] amen
[35:44] uh
[35:45] when the lord went through the
[35:46] crucifixion
[35:49] as we know crucifixion is execution of a
[35:51] person
[35:56] a persona
[36:02] and the lord jesus christ
[36:04] went to calvary voluntarily yes
[36:09] even though
[36:10] some of his servants wanted to fight for
[36:11] him
[36:14] like peter come on pedro he didn't want
[36:16] to let those soldiers get him
[36:22] that way
[36:51] we have to believe that sacrifice was
[36:52] for us
[36:55] the lord jesus christ for every single
[36:57] one of us
[37:00] the only way it becomes active in our
[37:02] lives
[37:04] it's for us to believe it and apply it
[37:09] amen amen
[37:11] and uh i was uh hearing a message of
[37:14] brother branham
[37:17] it was titled go tell my disciples
[37:21] and he was talking a little bit of jesus
[37:23] christ
[37:26] about how he was a man
[37:28] but as well was it was god
[37:31] can you read leslie
[37:34] as brother tom was saying was just
[37:36] saying
[37:38] tom
[37:39] today was the day
[37:41] that he proved
[37:45] what it was
[37:47] anyone could die quote
[38:01] he looked like god
[38:14] he proved on easter morning
[38:41] and so this
[38:43] so this is
[38:55] and i was seen as he was explaining that
[38:59] he was more than a man
[39:03] i saw the story of lazarus
[39:06] and how
[39:08] um how mary was there
[39:10] martha and mary were there marta
[39:13] and they were waiting for jesus to
[39:15] arrive to the scene
[39:20] man amen but
[39:22] they were expecting him at a certain
[39:24] time
[39:27] and
[39:28] the lord didn't arrive at that time
[39:32] sooner or later
[39:35] the lord came to the scene
[39:38] and
[39:39] martha marta
[39:47] [Music]
[39:54] by the time the lord got there it was
[39:57] about four days
[40:01] so
[40:02] she tells the lord
[40:04] lord
[40:05] it's already it's already been four days
[40:07] since last year it passed away
[40:21] he still went to lazarus
[40:46] and
[40:47] so he felt the pain
[40:50] he felt that pain of losing a person
[40:55] felt frail at that time
[40:58] he was crying
[41:00] his tears coming down his cheeks
[41:13] even though everybody was thought the
[41:15] everything was over
[41:25] when the doctors say you don't have an
[41:26] opportunity anymore
[41:30] that's when the lord
[41:31] starts to warm up man is
[41:46] many times
[42:01] we want to think about the smartest way
[42:02] of solving it
[42:06] and it might be a small problem
[42:09] but we should not lean on our own
[42:11] understanding
[42:15] and we should just go to god first
[42:19] amen amen
[42:23] so
[42:24] martha's there is marta
[42:28] and jesus is is with lazarus jesus
[42:32] and he's jesus tell us
[42:35] lazarus come forward
[42:39] and
[42:40] last
[42:41] resort
[42:47] that
[42:48] doesn't matter how
[42:51] how last minute we think it is
[43:09] and i lost my job already
[43:12] and now you you want to pray for me now
[43:16] what are you going to do now
[43:18] but that's when god comes into the scene
[43:22] doesn't matter what has happened no
[43:24] important
[43:38] amen
[43:40] and
[43:42] saying uh
[43:44] god is the same yesterday today and
[43:46] forever
[43:48] so he's not gonna change what he did
[43:51] back then today
[44:06] don't change jesus
[44:08] amen amen
[44:11] so what are we doing this evening
[44:15] we're here at church that's great
[44:18] worshiping his name
[44:35] no
[44:36] it's not because it's sunday
[44:38] but because he's our lord and savior
[44:43] that's
[44:44] he's everything to us
[44:47] jesus promised to everybody jesus
[44:51] whoever believes in him
[44:54] shall never die
[44:56] amen amen so i invite you this evening
[44:59] brothers
[45:01] to open up your heart to them
[45:05] to give them all your problems
[45:09] stop worrying about your problems
[45:12] and let him take care of it
[45:17] you just worry about serving him
[45:21] make sure he's the first thing in your
[45:23] life
[45:25] and the rest he's going to do
[45:28] amen amen god bless you brother
[45:41] it's a pleasure to be here this evening
[45:44] i really love sitting down and listening
[45:46] to when our brother speaks
[45:50] here
[45:51] so i'd love to hear in your perspective
[45:56] especially when it's one of our fellow
[45:57] youth specialists
[46:26] he
[46:40] when lazarus
[47:07] no one ever understands how i feel
[47:11] please remember
[47:13] jesus knows exactly how you feel
[47:16] because he went through it
[47:18] when he was a man
[47:20] and so meditating or thinking about
[47:22] eastern
[47:24] i was thinking about this subject
[47:25] throughout the week
[47:28] and i was thinking about why it's so
[47:29] important
[47:31] so i came i came down to this
[47:34] and i started thinking
[47:35] this act
[47:48] that's the reason why we're all here
[47:50] tonight
[48:10] he's talking about he's preaching on a
[48:11] sunday morning
[48:13] or he's preaching on a uh sorry an
[48:16] easter morning
[48:34] who came to redeem
[48:36] the whole human race
[48:39] i think about everything we've been
[48:40] learning just throughout the years
[48:45] like right now we're still focusing on
[48:46] the whole plan of redemption
[48:50] when we talk about reconciliation
[48:54] the basis of all those things
[48:56] is us recognizing what was done for us
[49:28] so rich
[49:57] no thinking he was a man
[50:00] how much pain he was going through at
[50:01] the moment
[50:04] when he was being whipped
[50:06] when they put that that crown of thorns
[50:08] on his head
[50:10] then when they
[50:22] they spit on him
[50:24] all this towards the person who was here
[50:26] to save them
[50:28] i could just think about how much that
[50:30] must have hurt him
[50:33] as a man
[50:35] how much he must have hurt him
[50:37] how much he must have hurt his father he
[50:40] was willing to give up his son
[50:44] me and you
[50:47] and as i was reading a message
[50:49] it's titled living
[50:51] dying buried rising coming
[51:02] and then he says like once he once
[51:04] brother branham was talking to a
[51:05] scientist
[51:17] he says there's only one way that it
[51:18] could have happened
[51:22] he says it was not because the roman
[51:23] spear that he died
[51:29] neither was it the loss of blood
[51:32] says that what that showed
[51:46] he says there was still that shows that
[51:48] there was still blood in his body
[51:52] so that's not what he died from
[51:54] he said he didn't die from the nails
[51:56] that drove in his hands
[51:59] or the thorny crown they placed on his
[52:01] head
[52:57] he says they gambled for his clothes
[53:03] and we read the scripture
[53:05] he says that they were all gathered
[53:06] round
[53:09] i can imagine
[53:11] it's i take this oh
[53:13] oh who wants this quincy who wants it
[53:16] who wants to get it everybody raise
[53:17] their hand i want it i want it
[53:19] why not cause it was something great
[53:21] because they were making fun of him
[53:24] in that pain that he must have gone
[53:25] through
[53:50] he says that jesus was the greatest
[53:51] representation of love that ever hit the
[53:53] earth
[54:07] i'm sorry he says no man could ever love
[54:09] like him
[54:12] and oh no man was ever hated like him
[54:16] no no one that's that's a lot to say
[54:19] we look at history
[54:21] we see a lot of people who we think are
[54:23] evil
[54:26] and we say everybody has to hate them
[54:30] well they were a terrible person
[54:32] but here brother says
[54:34] that no one had ever been hated like he
[54:36] was
[55:04] when he was when he he's saying when he
[55:06] in his last breath
[55:09] on the cross in la cruz just with the
[55:11] vulgar mocking
[55:13] orlando
[55:16] of those that stood by
[55:18] the door
[55:32] not what they do
[55:35] even then yeah
[55:37] even being whipped uncles
[55:39] being tortured
[55:41] he still prayed for us
[55:46] he still forgave
[56:13] he was capable of loving his enemies
[56:39] but you still would not have such a
[56:41] painful death like the one he had
[56:45] that's how painful it was for him
[56:49] in what of it
[56:51] well here we are this morning
[56:53] i'm sorry this night
[56:55] because he died for each one of us
[56:58] not just my sins no no no no no no no no
[56:59] no specifically
[57:02] all of your sins
[57:04] maybe you have co-workers
[57:06] he died for their sins as well
[57:09] fellow fellow students
[57:53] new hats or new clothes
[57:57] he says that that's all right this is
[57:59] he says it's a symbol of something new
[58:02] he said god did something new
[58:05] says which is all right
[58:13] or hunting easter rabbits or bunny eggs
[58:15] or little white chickens or some other
[58:17] stuff
[58:20] well
[58:46] as a successful day
[59:02] and he made us participants
[59:04] of that redemption
[59:06] of that reconciliation reconciliation
[59:08] like i said last time
[59:10] up here
[59:12] he's restoring that fellowship
[59:15] to fellowship with us
[59:27] and something that i like that he kept
[59:28] mentioning in this message brother
[59:29] branham
[59:33] he says he i like the way he puts it
[59:36] you know he says living he loved me
[59:39] dying he saved me
[59:41] said buried
[59:43] he carried my sins far away
[59:47] he says all rising
[59:50] he justified freely forever
[59:53] someday he's coming
[59:56] oh glorious day glorioso so one day he's
[59:58] coming isn't that is that not what we
[1:00:00] believe
[1:00:02] is that why we're here
[1:00:04] and that's why this is important
[1:00:07] this right here is our foundation
[1:00:10] this is what like brother branham said
[1:00:11] it makes our religion real
[1:00:29] i was thinking of a video that has been
[1:00:30] shown to me several times
[1:00:34] i think our brother showed it to us
[1:00:35] maybe it was a valentine's day
[1:00:40] and maybe he maybe on another occasion
[1:00:41] as well
[1:00:43] you know and just just give you the
[1:00:45] quick version
[1:00:47] maybe you've seen it as well
[1:00:49] it's the one of a man
[1:00:52] who works on a railroad
[1:01:04] [Music]
[1:01:08] the bridge comes down
[1:01:14] cross when it's time for it to cross
[1:01:20] there was people having a party
[1:01:22] there's
[1:01:50] it goes onto the tracks where the train
[1:01:52] is supposed to come
[1:01:55] and the man has this has to make a
[1:01:57] decision
[1:01:59] he says if if i don't bring the train
[1:02:01] the tracks down
[1:02:04] well the train train's going to crash
[1:02:07] and everybody on the train is going to
[1:02:08] die
[1:02:11] but
[1:02:12] his son will be his son will be well
[1:02:14] because his son had been on the tracks
[1:02:17] or he can bring the track down
[1:02:21] ultimately killing his son
[1:02:25] but everybody on that train will live
[1:02:27] in itself was a type of what the lord
[1:02:29] jesus christ did for us
[1:02:32] because in the video
