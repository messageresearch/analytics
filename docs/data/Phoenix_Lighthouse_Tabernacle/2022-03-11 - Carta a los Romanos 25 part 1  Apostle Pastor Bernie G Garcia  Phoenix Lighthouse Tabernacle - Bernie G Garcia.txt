TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so so [Music] so [Music] then we're going to be going to genesis 2 15. gloria for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glories which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of god genesis 2 15. [Music] and the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it let us pray now father we thank you for your word say welcome [Music] will be missed [Music] there the doubters will be missing all together all the skeptics will be absent on that day amen there will be no ground there will be more [Music] oh [Music] i [Music] hold on [Music] [Music] i'd like to present to you two families that are visiting us one first is brother vern his wife from the state of colorado would you stand brother you and your wife would you both stand so the people will know who you are welcoming our inner myth brother thank you brother charlotte to be ministering tonight he speaks in english and interpretation will be to spanish next i'd like to ask all of those that are visiting [Applause] we're going to be studying on the letter to the romans is [Music] we're on the subtitle of the topic of the manifestation of the sons of god how many of you want to be manifested as children of god say amen we have seen how it was a man was placed as lord man lost his place [Music] now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden we know that this is the conversation that the serpent and the woman had a life for all of us to consider and god blessed them and and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth so with this i can see that god placed them as lords over the earth let's start studying this morning before we're going to consider what we have before us a circle you might be able to frame it i know i see that the serpent deceived eve that was where god's rulership was that was god's headquarters uh but we don't know what it says it says there and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fall of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth we know that very well that both men as well as women were both and we see that the serpent was a standard dominion or subjection to the we see that the bible tells us that man forfeited everything and he turned it over to satan's hands i can come to the conclusion he could have caused for the woman to die but also the serpent would have been annihilated exterminated remember he was a ruler lord over the serpent whatever adam of course when the man saw exactly what condition his wife was found herself in he chose he was not deceived to redeem his wife because foreign the serpent was never cast out the serpent stayed right in there where god's ruling place was but the man and the woman they were thrown out when hello back into the circle if you understand say amen remember the subject is the manifestation of the sons of god seems like i'm off the subject but i'm still on the subject of vienna i can see that the trail of the serpent comes all the way back from the garden of eden where god's throne was that's the trail of the serpent on the earth in order to follow in the front the first road was where duo was in heaven [Music] in jesus christ [Music] foreign in his sacrifice judas so the first room was in heaven and after that man had been thrown out of god's circle influence throne in the third round we rejoice because of that but remember that's a sphere of influence for all eternity so we can see a little item some small details so we can see clearly what god has done for us the more i see it because god has made us the best that there is on the earth and one of them in particular is the masterpiece [Music] is [Music] one of the things is that masterpiece came through four stages and he faces abraham the patriarch as a father of faith there is a first foundation then next he places the patriarch isaac then the third foundation he places a man truly did very many evil things but it was god's grace covering jacob 37 verse 3. jacob's name was changed to what no i couldn't hear you now israel loved joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colors how many sons does jacob or israel have that had twelve because when did he have him into these different colors they all contain the colors of the rainbow it was completely cloud covered with this close of many colors mind just imagine your mind many colors covering covering joseph then keeping that in mind open up your bibles to the book of judges 30 of chapter 5 of judges verse 30 of chapter 5 of judges have they not sped have they not divided the prey to every man a damsel or two to sisera the prey of diverse colors a prayer diverse colors of needlework of diverse colors of needlework on both sides mean for the necks of them that take the spoil in the bible says the bible says of diverse colors a needlework on both sides meet for the next of them that take a spoil in other words for the head or the leader the clothing of diverse colors is both for the head oh capitan or for the the head man israel will dress joseph with the code of many colors he loved him and he placed him as a head the head man over the rest of his brothers and his brothers because his father has placed him as the head or the head man and people say well how can he represent jesus christ samuel uh samuel is right before kings and chronicles first a second samuel excuse me second samuel chapter 13. completely here speaking about what amnon he dishonors his sister and here it says how that absalon amnon's brother comes and avenges his sister tamar would have been violated by his brother her brother me proposed my purpose this morning is not to speak about them but just to emphasize a little something here second and she had a virgin she excuse me she had a garment of diverse colors upon her for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins this code of colors that the daughters the virgin daughters of kings wore adama when they would see a lady walking with a dress of many colors they knew right away one thing first of all that she was a virgin and secondly that her father was a king now she was a virgin daughter of a king and then after that i'm not dishonored verse um and tamar put ashes on her head and rent her garment of diverse colors that was on her and laid her hand on her head and went on crying given a sign that she was had been dishonored she ripped up her guard and she put ashes on her head place her hands on her head and she goes on sorry and crying and lamenting because she had been dishonored she was no longer a virgin she had been dishonored let me tell you i know we are the head that the brother woman of the world just keep your bible open to there to chapter five within and without because there is no one that will open the block and if the book is not open then you can't see what's on the inside what the seven seals have cannot be seen god that there could be resurrection from the dead the redemption of our bodies the resurrection from the dead let's look there's now let's look at revelations chapter 10. are you ready and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and the rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire going to show you this sketch now you're going to tell me if that's what the bible says and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven where did the angel come down from from heaven is that right the angel was mighty and he came down from from heaven in other words in english separated you know is an ark and [Applause] manifested [Music] what did these seven seals do you know the mysterious they opened up the mysteries they did something else very tremendous yes and that is that they they let loose seven colors this is or the in his father's old age and he dressed with many colors the seals were open when the ancient of days appeared you know how the prophet types the human beings how about right at the midday that a person is right in the height of his life then when the sun starts what [Music] you
