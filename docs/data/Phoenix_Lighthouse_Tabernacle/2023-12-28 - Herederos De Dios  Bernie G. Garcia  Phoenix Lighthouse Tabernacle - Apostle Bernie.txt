TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] the [Music] all [Music] [Applause] [Music] n [Music] the [Music] all [Applause] [Music] [Music] d [Music] [Music] the [Music] oh [Music] h [Music] [Applause] a [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] a [Music] oh [Music] a [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] a [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] n [Music] [Applause] [Music] I [Music] [Music] I greet each and every one of you in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ tonight we're happy that you have all been able to come tonight we've come here to receive from God and I also believe just like we've come here expecting God will give us that which what we need let us all [Music] stand we're going to be reading Romans 8 verses 16 and [Music] 17 the spirit itself Bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then hirs HS of God and join HS with Christ that just pray father we thank you for the revelation of the [Music] word because we possess all things that's what your word tells us and your children believe that they say Amen to the word the only thing that can make us realize that is that Revelation which you have given us in this day Lord for what you're going to do tonight what you have already done and will do tomorrow in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen tonight I want to entitle the talk HS of God [Music] now before I start I'd like to say that something tremendous wonderful and beautiful is in the air stirring we've heard a lot of the message and we've actually we've already talked about the day that when we will be with the Lord and I believe that that day is drawing close and so happens that so many things are going on around us this makes us think and meditate on God's word and the more we meditate the more we realize who we are we are God's [Music] Hees when we inherit something there's different things that you inherit you might take possession of property for example someone's an owner of a home or territory real estate they write out a will a testament and it says I leave my property to my son or whoever it may be then when that person dies the one that was left those things can take possession of that territory or the real estate and when we see here that we are Hees we can take possession of property there's something else that a person can inherit that's a position of leadership we know that God is the leader the king but if he has made us heirs not only does he give us possession of property but he also gives us a position of leadership and this actually covers a lot of ground because this day that we're living in we have to recognize our position and our [Music] place we are the leaders of this world that we're living in if we recognize that we are heirs another thing that a person can inherit is rank title or office like we said just a moment ago that Jesus is the king and if you have a king then you have a if you have a kingdom then you have a king and one who's reigning and his son is considered as Ace when the king leaves or dies and the son takes his place position rank as king so I see that if we are God's HS we're not just princes but also Kings when we go and see the scripture [Music] there when they brought the Lord Jesus that young boy that was sick so happens here that this man was kneeling down to the Lord Jesus Christ saying Lord have mercy on my son for he is a lunatic and sore Vex for of times he fth Into the Fire and off into the water and I brought him to thy disciples and they could not cure him the scripture says that the Lord Jesus rebuked the devil and DEP parted out of him and the child was cured from that very says in the that the disciples came to Jesus apart and said why could we not cast him out and Jesus said unto him because of your unbelief Jesus answer and said to him because of your unbelief for verily I say unto you if you have faith as a grain of a mustard seed he shall say unto this mountain remove hands to To Yonder place and it shall move and nothing shall be impossible unto you how be it this kind goth not out but by prayer and fasting the Lord Jesus gives us certain Keys Clues I see that the the disciples pray for the young boy that was a lunatic he was demon possessed when this demon took a hold of him it would even throw him in the fire sometimes in water trying to drown him then this man seeing that his son was tormented he brought him to the disciples the disciples prayed for him but couldn't cast The Devil out so this man we see he was not at peace with this he wasn't satisfied with that brought him to the king of King Lord of lords the rabbi the master and when he brought him before the Lord Jesus he knelt down and he said Lord have compassion on me for my son is sick when the Lord heard this he rebuked the devil he he ordered the devil out him out I'm sure the the disciples sure felt bad kind of embarrassed I'm sure they wish the Earth could have swallowed them up open up swallow them because they had prayed for the child and he had not been healed they asked H why was it that it didn't come out when we prayed because of your unbelief said the Lord but then he says but this kind shall not come out except by prayer and fasting other verse he's saying to them that there's certain kind of devils that will not come out unless you are praying and fasting when the Lord Jesus left he sat down at the right hand of of the Majesty of father says the scripture says even a deacon by name of Philip he was no longer he's not an apostle he was just a deacon he went to Samaria is because God had given them an inheritance the Lord Jesus had G give him Authority and told him how to be able to take dominion over devils and with this inheritance and fath Philip went to Samaria the scripture say that when Philip would pray for the people the demons would leave screaming why because they had received an inheritance now we are God's Hees that the Bible says and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils that's an inheritance when we talk about inheritance we refering sometimes think just property but inheritance is also position of leadership title and office and I we can also have to have a title rank office because if we are arresting against powers in the air they're not going to powers are not going to obey just any Mickey Mouse guy they're only going to be the one that have a title rank office one has been an heir of God one that recognizes his position and his place that recognizes that there was someone that paid the price you and I did not pay the price the only begotten Son of God paid the price and we're God's HS let's open up our scriptures to see a little bit to what purpose did the Lord Jesus Christ come for I believe that in this day in the day that we're living in I believe the the most precious time that mankind has ever lived and the more that day gets closer the one we're going to leave when we're going to leave this earth the word opens up more and more I've always said and believed that brother bram's Ministry produced twins you believe the same thing but in my viewpoint that I have of these twins I look at the messages that brother Bon brought and I put them into two categories one that inheritance that God left us and the other category is when the prophet would go into the deep things of the message if you hear the tapes all the way through 57 1960 especially 57 58 and 59 when the prophet was traveling throughout different places he preached a message and that one message that he preached was that he preached a living God and and in all his campaigns and services almost he always exced normally the discernment towards the end he hardly practiced discernment once in a while he practiced it exercise it but not in the way that he used to do it in the beginning and many people heard brother Bram in this during this time and they believed brother Bram and they went out throughout all the world World preaching the gospel and to say like this they conquered all the whole world thousands of thousands of people accepted the gospel when these people over conquered the world they weren't taking the doctrine but they were taking a certain that of Jesus Christ being the same yesterday today and forever and that we are God's HS if you like to understand me better osbor like these men like or Roberts and these men were men were inspired by the ministry of brother brand to go and take the gospel and in just one campaign that they would have 120 blind people would receive their sign but someone might say but they didn't accept the message I believe different I believe they accepted the message that brother Bron brought because the message brother Brandon brought has two divisions to two categories part and one of the things is that they exercise by faith the things that God had promised for his people and and they just rooted in there in that and they really have exalted themselves and right now they form that charismatic group but there was another group and that's us and those of us as us that believe the doctrines of this messenger but we actually have doubted the other part we have not believed the other part of brother br's Ministry when our master and Rabbi would stand up and he take power over evil spirits and demons we have stood up and said only brother B could do that when the Bible says that we are of God and join HS with Jesus Christ so there's a there's a portion of brother Mage that we must hearen we must say Amen we must believe it we must exercise it practice it's got a key this demon generation will not come out this be PR has to be a people that are dedicated people that are consecrated people that are surrendered to God a Ministry that are praying and fast just exactly like the Lord Jesus told the disciples this kind will not come out except by prayer and fasting first John 38 I'll tell you the truth I believe if a church does not have signs Miracles and wers they do not completely believe in the the Gans have that in their life their Ministry and their Church and we have only believed a portion a part of the m and what it has produced nothing but a bunch of starch but intellectual actually they don't believe every word that has come out of God's mouth if I want someone's there you're not going to stay without what belongs to me I'm going to grab it out of your hands because and what's ours we have to grab it because it's ours because we are HS first John 38 whosoever is commits sin is the devil now sin is unbelief he that believes not God's promises because the devil has overcome him isn't that right because he that commits sin is the devil for the devil sins from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil let's repeat it along [Music] together so the devil then has works is that right everything that the devil did all the works that the devil has the Son of God appeared to destroy them break them and throw them out is that right now let's look at Hebrew HEBs 2 and verse 14 these are scriptures that we have already read and I'd like to say something to you I know that the majority of us know it by memory but one thing is to know it by memory and the other thing is to understand it to see it believe it and we must repeat it until it's a revelation 24 for as much then as the children are partakers of Flesh and Blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil can you imagine that the devil had a power and that power was of death and he's God has already destroyed that power we as God's children cannot die once again I believe that we as God's children cannot die how many of you believe that you cannot die would you raise your hand notice we have trust that even if they bury us and they cover us completely cover us with dirt and yet we say we're going to rise again but then when there's someone sick amongst us we say well maybe God will heal him maybe God won't do we believe then that we're going to raise rise again what is is easier for you to raise be healed of a sickness or to rais from the dead it's believing in the word believing that we're HS believe that he destroyed the one that had the power why does someone get sick have you ever thought on that why does the sickness come to someone a chronic illness to kill him that's the works of the devil but the Son of God came to destroy the works of the devil if we could just repeat this until it goes down to the heart those works that the devil came to do that was to put sicknesses on the people when the Bible says that if we be God's statute and if we follow God's word the sicknesses and the pl that the worldes will not come n to God's people is that right that's God's word and if the sickness of Duke approach we've been given an inheritance we've been given a position of leadership and if we have a position of leadership we must tell the devil to get away and get away from our brother and say who are you I'm a leader are you leaders if you're an heir then you are a leader let's look at another scripture Colossians [Music] 13 who has delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son we were in darkness without hope without God and the power of darkness really had you in his his clutches we were slaves we were prisoners we were subjects we were puppets of the devil he did with us like he wanted to he did whatever he felt like doing with us but then there was something there was a sacrifice a blood was shed someone paid the price the only begotten Son of God paid the price then he translated us from that Kingdom into another kingdom is that right let us see AP Revelation 1 n and 10 I John who also am your brother and companion in Tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was in the aisle that is called patmas for the word of God and for the test testimony of Jesus Christ I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet this uh John was in a deserted kind of a desolate Island he had been exiled to that place because he had been compiling the sacred books that a sudden God came took him out of the island brought him all the way to the Lord's day he was no longer on the island is that right then when he saw oh he could see a preview of what was coming for God's people Bible say he started screaming yelling and just having a great Jubilee seeing when he was seeing those things that was coming for us for those that were going to be living in that golden age when those were going to be living during the time of the restoration of all things when those who going to be here that would hear the voice of the seventh Ang when there would be those here on the earth when there would be a resurrection from among the dead when there would be people here living when the Rapture would take place when he could see those that would be part of the Bride that would be there in the wedding supper of the Lamb he just saw a preview when he was translated or carried forward and we in our day we were in darkness we were in the Cs of the devil but then a message came and took us out of there and brought us into the kingdom of his beloved Son then we saw God's leader for this time and he told us this is yours just like Joshua and Caleb did they went to the promised land and they brought back some of the grapes but there in kadish bar the Judgment see the people did not want to accept that but Joshua and Caleb did accept it they brought back the evidence from that land and all of us have believed and say Amen to all of this and Jesus Christ Our Joshua he was buried he returned and when he presented himself to the disciples they said it can't be Jesus it's a ghost but he said look I'm bringing back the evidence touch my body give me something to eat this is the evidence that I have overcome the that I have power over everything there was the evidence when the disciples saw this they went to the upper room until the their evidence came that same Holy Ghost the great Joshua came to live in them when they went out to see the people that were demon possessed they had the evidence that Jesus Christ lives and Reigns even Peter said I don't have a silver gold I'm just broke I don't have any my check I don't have nothing to buy but one thing I do have the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I have the evidence he lives and reigns forever then they bound that Jesus they tied them they bound them but then a prophet came and he says I'm bringing the evidence that Jesus Christ Liv that Jesus Christ and he's given the authority to his church to his bride his people do you accept that Ephesians 1 verse three first of all Revelation 4 verse one after this I looked and behold the door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up here and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter in other words I believe that there's a message coming and tells us come up hither and live a higher life than the denominational people are living come up hither and live a higher life than the world is living come up here where do we go up to how do we go up I believe I believe the God when he first of all when heend comes first down with a shout and the shout says come up hi come up Elevate take your place sit down where where am I going to sit down he that overcome I will let him sit down with me in my Throne as I also overc came and sat down with my father in his throne come up hither Ephesians 13 blessed be the God and Father of of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ in other words he said come up here I'm going to bless you with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ sit down you have the authority and the judge sat down the books were open if you notice Dan Daniel chapter 7 said the Ancient of Days sat down we know he had a white wig on we know a cloud came down actually a cloud was formed when Seven Angels Came Down a message was given the seals were open come up hither sit down because the judge has already sat down he has the authority no noce my brother we we are the Believers of the message of the last hour but I'm sure that the majority of us if someone was demon possessed we knew that they were demon possessed we wouldn't get close to that demon possessed person the blood of Jesus Christ the blood of Jesus Christ the blood of Jesus Christ we have the power if we're sitting in Heavenly places if we heard have heard a mess of a come up here you're an my you have received what belong to God what was in God the property he took the title D he gave it to the seventh angel and he said here's the plan this is yours claim what's yours that's what we must do let's claim what's don't let the devil take it away from us but claim everything that belongs to us we arees how many of you arees just mark down the scripture so we can save time brother B talks about the Jehovah's seven compound names of redemption and we believe that Jesus Paid the price of Redemption how many of you believe that do you really believe that brother says the seven compound names cannot be separated one from another that they're always tied together so if Jehovah Jehovah the Old Testament was made flesh he went to Calvary he paid the price on Calvary then these seven things are in Jehovah they are because he paid the price Ezekiel 4845 he says there that he is Jehovah sh in other words the Lord is present just like the Lord Jesus Christ says Lord I Am With You Always even to the end of the world doesn't matter he said what problem what problem you might have how dark the thing may look the Lord Jesus is there he's there you must believe that you must believe he is there do you believe that why then a lot of people say well the Lord left me why does the scripture then say though I am with you always even until the end of the world when it's really dark it's really pitched black and heavy seems like there's nothing for us God is right by our side because he is always present judges 623 and 24 Shalom he is Jehovah Shalom the Lord are peace the Lord is peace no one the Lord Jesus said my peace I give unto you notice how that sometimes our house looks instead of being a a human being's home looks like a house for cats and dogs you ever notic that I don't believe there's a home that this doesn't happen someone that might say d is a liar the Lord Jesus tells us that when Once once in his home everything was all troubled in the prophet's home his wife was all nervous troubl and he took her he started praying with her claiming peace and Tranquility for her because Jehovah isace so if we have been redeemed and if Jesus Paid the price there should be peace in sometimes there's no peace because we don't claim what is ours it's our inheritance there must be peace shom there should be peace and if it is we should call Jehovah so you are you are peace come God and bring bring peace to my heart bring peace to my family bring peace to my home he'll do it he paid the price and peace belongs to us it's ours my brother we don't have to be fighting like enemies like cats and dogs we bite each other and some we consume but Redemption has already been paid for we should have the faith and claim if we fight a lot with our wife let's claim peace say here sit down honey let's make make things let's make up and live like brothers peace is ours not fight no Wars not dissensions Schism or he is Jehovah Shalom Psalms 231 that's Jehovah that is the Lord is my shepherd you remember the Lord Jesus said I am the Good Shepherd you know how we sing this little song says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want you remember that little chorus sometimes we feel so desolate abandoned but we don't have a pastor and even if we do have a pastor seems like we don't have a pastor I'm by myself with no because he's looking at a flesh body he's not looking at that Jehovah that died on the cross he is our and he never forsakes us he is our pastor he is always doesn't matter what you might need he is your shepher he'll give you what you need and he's right there now when Jesus died he gave you the right for Jehovah to be your Shepherd look there are people in this message that have stopped following the message there people in denomination that stopped serving the lord because the shepherd Pastor Shepherd did something wrong and they said well it's better for me to go but they understood that they are HS and they have a right to that Shepherd to Jehovah because the the sacrifice Redemption has already been given for us whatever you might need from the pastor Jehovah will give it to you because Jesus Paid the he is your shepher and you shall not want Genesis 22 14 Jehovah Gyra the Lord shall provide for himself a sacrifice isn't that tremendous I remember that at one time there's a family uh brother and family was praying because they didn't have any food and they were praying saying Lord we're without food give us some food and the neighbors they heard the prayer they went to the grocery store and bought some bags of groceries and put it there by the door when they open the door they said look what God gave us and the neighbors were just laughing he said don't you know that they don't know that we gave them the food it wasn't God but God has a lot of ways of providing that which what we need sometimes we need something and we don't receive it because we don't claim it sometimes we're looking for a home someone wants a better home let's say they pay $300 or $400 for just nothing but a beat down check and they said well I want a better house but I don't want to pay so much money Lord give me a for me not to be able to spend so much claim it it's yours you're an air I'm sure that God will give you a better home but you have to be you have to claim it remember he paid the price Abraham was up there on the mountain he had walked a three days journey out there like in the jungle to say it that way climbed up the mountain he barely got to the top he was up there in a very remote Mountain he says he said they're so high that you couldn't see any sheep up there because there the Ferocious animal the wild animals would eat the Sheep but there one of two Abraham even would Abraham would have either killed his son or what God would have to give him a ram way up at the top of the mountain and Abraham said I'm going up I'm going up with my son and my son and I will both come down because Jehovah God will provide a ram for me God gave it to him didn't he AR we children of abrah then Jesus Christ pay the price of redemption doesn't matter how black they look we grab on to the horn horns of the Altar and we claim what's our listen to me God is O to give us what we need Jehovah Exodus 1715 this the Lord our Banner the Lord our captain isn't that tremendous we're we're not an army without captain he is our captain when we canot find a way out we have to cry and say Jehovah raise up your banner so we can know where where to go so I can see the North Star I find myself lost I don't know how to get out of here I don't have a guide but you are Jehovah you're Jehovah my B you're Jehovah my Captain take me out here safely God will take you out safely because he already paid the it belongs to us Jeremiah [Music] 236 or that is the Lord our righteousness isn't that tremendous they come to see us and they say who are you you barely accepted the message yesterday you were a Baptist and a bad one at that you were this or that an evil woman with a ill Fame woman you were a drunk or a drug addict you don't even deserve to live but Jehovah our righteousness not me not my righteousness it's Jehovah's righteous he paid the price my brother we're righteous we're Justified he is our righteousness it's part of what he redeemed when God sees us he doesn't see us as we are he sees our righteousness our sees our righteousness he sees Jehovah the blood of Jesus Christ he say the Redemption that was paid for at the cross then he says he's Justified he's Justified and and the prayer of a righteous man ath much the seven Jehovah Rafa Exodus [Music] 1526 I am Jehovah your healer the Lord heals or Jehovah heals he heals headaches he heals a cold flu he heals TB diabetes he heals diabetes cancer he heals cancer you'll forgive me I see it so clearly I see you the way you're looking at me say brother what are you preaching I believe this is what we need because watch many of us we're so worried we want to be eligible for Access if my family get sick or my children what am I going to do if they receive would receive the Revelation Jehovah Rafa I am Jehovah your healer another words I am your doctor access ACC I'm your Access program amen is that right brother forgive me the something call welfare they call Jehovah says I am your Weare is it what Jehovah [Music] says but we don't believe it because we don't preach it you start preaching and people say well what are you teaching me I want to hear great Revelation what more Revelation that's just something small what do you have whatever you want a lot of people say I don't like to bother brother Bernie because he's too busy well that's showing me teaching me something I don't bother Jehovah because I just have a headache just I'll take an aspirin why should I tell God take away this headache the other day today I went with brother ju about two three four hours ago he said he had a real strong strong pain here and I said that pain has to go now believe me I'm going to finish now I'm a fanatic but there's something that has happened in these last days I believe that people do not believe God and we have to start believing God I told that pain has to go the pain I order you for you to go and he said the devil said did you see a vision did you dream a dream do you have thus sayith the Lord I said yes I do I said sloot yes I do have th sayth the Lord he told me let me see when I said an angel came and told me like this these promises are for God's people Bram and the angel's name is William Mariam brandham he said he said did you hear that from God did yes I heard it directly from God's mouth there's a tape listen to it but we want for a vision to come if I see a vision then I'll say rise up I believe with all my heart that brother will gra home to God's word he'll come out of their alive God won't heal them because it's God's promise I am Jehovah Jehovah your healer but you have to grab on the prophet says you have to take it out of his clutches I used to say like this if it's God's will he's going to heal that's wrong it is God's will for him to heal for to heal listen it is God's will for it's not God's will for us to be sick now if God take someone that's something else but we must have faith you take a child and grab take it by the hand and the child will walk right with you you take a child and you tell don't be afraid of the lion I'm going to go into the cage with that animal you take the by hand and he'll walk into that cage with you because he's a baby there's a Simplicity about him if we would just be like children and gra a hold of Jehovah oh You're My Healer I'm stand on the promises and walk with him and walk with him but you know what happens what you s the other one reaps you're going to die you're going to die now oh you're you're SI time to go God punishing you that's showing a a seed of if he can't stand because that's unbel Jehovah is our healer but there's something else we the God's disciples we are God's disciples by this all men know that you are my disciples when you have love one for another is that right we should grab a hold of that Faith arm and say Jehovah Lord Brother is sick you're our healer found their cause there's a hidden sin in my life reveal it Lord because if he doesn't heal because we don't believe or because there's a hidden sin in is that right we should confess our sins then God will hear our prayer you get real quiet don't wa get real quiet I'm not going to stop yet I am going to finish my message and then we going to stay out there talking out here for an hour open up your Bible once again surely he will bear our griefs he already bore them are you sure then why don't we believe that we should if he already already bore our cancer the one that canc his Jesus thousand years ago on the cross and carried our sorrows you see how it says there our sorrows there's different kinds of Sorrows sometimes sometimes you have a headache sometimes a stomach ache sometimes legs hurt sometimes a heartache especially if one of our children sticks her tongue out of us or yells at us our heart just breaks we get a heart but he bore he carried our and God comes and heals you if you will ask him because he already did it he already carried our sorrow doesn't matter what it is verse five but he was wounded for our transgressions but the chastisement of our peace the CH of Peace was upon him and with his scribes we are healed notice we are joint joints with Jesus of christs of God Christ paid the price he suffered the whipping they placed upon him a crown of They Crucified him he paid the price so
