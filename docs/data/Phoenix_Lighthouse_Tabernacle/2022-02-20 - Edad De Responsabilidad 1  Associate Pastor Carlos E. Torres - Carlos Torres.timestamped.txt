[29:53] amen amen amen and amen
[29:59] before anything else we're going to go
[30:01] directly into this
[30:04] while we're standing
[30:18] [Music]
[30:23] if you want to write them down
[30:28] hebrews 9 11.
[30:32] reach the following
[30:49] but christ being come
[30:51] and high priest of good things to come
[30:54] by a greater and more perfect tabernacle
[30:56] not immediately hands that is to say not
[30:59] of this building
[31:00] you know sangre de machos cabrillo
[31:12] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[31:14] by his own blood he entered once into
[31:16] the holy place having obtained eternal
[31:19] redemption for us
[31:33] for the blood of bulls and goats and the
[31:35] ashes of the
[31:36] heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctified
[31:39] to the purifying of the flesh
[31:44] and
[31:54] how much more shall the blood of christ
[31:56] whom through the eternal spirit
[31:58] offered himself without spot to god
[32:00] virtual conscience from death works to
[32:03] serve the living god
[32:04] amen amen
[32:08] bless everyone you may be seated
[32:11] in la casa del signora
[32:25] it's good to sing songs until the lord
[32:31] and to come together our praise
[32:34] together
[32:37] so they can bring the sacrifice of
[32:39] praise together
[33:01] bless everyone once again the brothers
[33:03] that are watching through the internet
[33:05] colorado
[33:48] our pastor already told us the complete
[33:50] plan of redemption
[34:02] of bringing this title this
[34:18] it's a
[34:18] secret repetition
[34:20] you're going to repeat the same thing
[34:24] not necessarily
[34:27] but it all gets to a certain point
[34:30] to be able to understand
[34:45] or say one thing it's not enough for us
[34:50] or to read the the devil has known that
[34:52] secretary sanchez
[34:56] and he has bombarded our minds one and
[34:59] another with so many other things
[35:03] because he has understood what the
[35:04] secret of repetition is
[35:08] we as christians
[35:11] instead of getting advantage of this
[35:23] [Music]
[35:28] the whole planet of redemption
[35:32] it covers a lot uh
[35:35] we've heard
[35:38] our pastor
[35:39] for a long time
[35:46] [Music]
[36:29] [Music]
[36:39] around this time we shouldn't know what
[36:41] the scripture says without even
[36:45] read many times from this pulpit
[37:06] we can't separate the ministry of the
[37:08] ministry of the end time revelations
[37:12] this is something very important that we
[37:14] should understand
[37:16] that in this time
[37:17] prophet god sent the prophet madum
[37:20] professor
[37:25] [Music]
[37:32] but by every word that proceeded out of
[37:34] a man of the
[37:48] of knowledge is the awakening of your
[37:50] conscience
[37:53] when you come to the message
[37:58] there's an awakening to see who who we
[38:01] really are
[38:05] and when we wake up is when we open up
[38:07] the scene in revelations
[38:10] in the days of the boys
[38:14] when he shall begin to sound let me tell
[38:53] it shall make the belly bitter but it
[38:54] shall be
[38:56] in thy mouth sweet as honey
[39:04] [Music]
[39:11] this is where the problem is
[39:54] our job is to
[40:08] he knew that his name was written
[40:12] but how did john know that his name was
[40:15] when he eats up the book
[40:20] so when he ate up the book what does it
[40:21] mean to eat
[40:37] i asked someone the other day what is it
[40:38] it's
[40:39] what does it mean to eat up the little
[40:41] book
[40:45] it could mean this it couldn't mean that
[40:47] but i'm not really sure
[40:49] because someone's you know
[40:51] i told him we've mentioned mentioned
[40:53] this so many times
[40:55] racist we've preached so many times
[41:00] we should understand that this is
[41:01] important
[41:15] [Music]
[41:18] la puerta
[41:32] [Music]
[41:47] and the ones that are here
[41:50] that wasn't here during that period
[41:54] the door of grace opens up
[41:57] but they have to walk
[42:14] l
[42:28] is
[42:52] [Music]
[42:54] there's mental sickness taking control
[42:57] of the people
[43:01] because the struggle now is a spiritual
[43:04] spirituality
[43:06] the struggle comes to your mind
[43:09] it comes to your mind
[43:23] knowing that we're in the la russia
[43:24] churches
[43:37] so that we can escape
[43:50] in one way or another
[44:49] god speaks to a loudest church in
[44:51] revelations
[44:55] i know that works neither are you hot or
[44:57] cold
[45:00] you've said i've gotten rich
[45:13] miserable poor blind and naked and don't
[45:16] know
[46:12] you
[46:31] [Music]
[46:42] the problem comes in
[46:44] we want to hide it
[46:47] we're not gonna face this we're gonna
[46:48] put it aside
[46:52] if we have that attitude then we're
[46:53] wretched
[46:54] lisa
[47:07] we see this age that we live in the the
[47:09] age of pressing a button
[47:16] the push button and yet people have less
[47:18] time to pray than they ever did have
[47:22] hey
[47:26] oh in this modern times they used to sit
[47:28] all night and listen to a sermon
[47:34] and we and now we just can't do it
[47:39] we haven't got time to do it
[47:41] [Music]
[47:44] it's just in our head
[47:49] we think we haven't have time
[47:53] [Music]
[48:30] the prophet tells us that this age is
[48:32] wretched
[48:39] [Music]
[48:46] the opportunity
[49:14] rejecting god's grace
[49:18] the devil won't get you away from the
[49:20] church
[49:21] [Music]
[49:23] he's going to let you sit here but not
[49:24] go forward
[49:26] the grace is
[49:37] [Music]
[49:42] this
[49:45] it takes us to a scripture in matthew 7
[49:47] 24.
[49:50] description
[50:10] is
[50:17] therefore whosoever hear this saying
[50:19] saying of mine and do with them i like
[50:22] them i liken him and to a wise man which
[50:25] built his house upon iraq
[50:34] and rain descended the floods came the
[50:35] winds blew and beat upon the house and
[50:37] it fell not for it was founded upon iraq
[50:49] and everyone that hear this sayings of
[50:52] mine and do with them not shall be
[50:54] likened unto a foolish man which built
[50:56] his cells upon the sand
[51:06] and rain descended the floods came and
[51:07] the winds blew and beat upon the house
[51:09] and it fell and the great was the fall
[51:12] of it
[51:15] is speaking of laura the condition
[51:17] the condition of the eggs
[51:20] how
[51:24] and he brings up the scripture here
[51:27] and he tells us
[51:32] this age has built upon quicksand
[51:48] then we see that the wise man
[51:51] he built this house upon a rock
[51:56] but the foolish built upon the sand
[51:58] possible
[52:01] and the image that probably comes to our
[52:03] mind is this image here
[52:06] there's a rock there on the highest and
[52:08] he's built his house
[52:14] but in reality there's not the image
[52:16] that we're trying to project
[52:27] was speaking to people that knew his
[52:28] customs
[52:58] that's what it seems like
[53:01] this is this is lucas
[53:03] looks 646 tells us
[53:10] why
[53:11] call me lord lord and do not the things
[53:13] which i say
[53:15] jesus
[53:17] when jesus spoke in this parable
[53:21] yeah he just preached the sermon on the
[53:23] mountain
[53:26] he began to bring
[53:48] and he tells him straight off what are
[53:50] you going to do what i just had just
[53:52] preached
[53:59] whosoever commits to me and heareth my
[54:01] saying and do with them i will show you
[54:04] to whom he is like
[54:07] he that comes to me
[54:16] he comes and eats up the book
[54:19] he makes them he does
[54:22] better in that belly
[54:34] i must forgive one i don't want to
[54:35] forgive
[54:50] he is like a man which built in a house
[54:54] and dig it deep and laid the foundation
[54:56] on a rock
[54:59] and when the flats arose
[55:03] the stream
[55:33] controller and when he found the rocket
[55:35] fundamentals there he plays this
[55:38] fundamental
[55:39] foundation it began to build
[55:45] so we have two builders now unused
[56:01] no important questions doesn't matter
[56:03] who you are no important
[56:05] doesn't matter how old are you
[56:07] familiar no matter what family
[56:10] the storm is
[56:28] a time
[57:03] [Music]
[57:16] [Music]
[57:47] a few years ago i was in
[57:49] new york and new york with the birth
[58:07] and how it would look
[58:10] and we got to there to the buildings
[58:14] the surprise was that he had completely
[58:16] almost finished it
[58:19] but it was just
[58:20] just left there
[58:23] no one um occupied it
[58:28] i asked the man who which i was with
[58:32] what's the problem que pasa what's wrong
[58:59] that he forgot to dig deep enough to
[59:02] search for the foundation
[59:06] she was so worried how the building was
[59:08] going to look like
[59:11] what the building was going to have
[59:12] inside
[59:15] fundamental correctness he
[59:29] for him to come to our heart
[59:35] and we want him to come but we don't
[59:36] have a foundation
[59:39] and of the holy spirit
[1:00:06] [Music]
[1:00:17] allow me to say this with respects to
[1:00:19] the lord jesus
[1:00:24] it doesn't matter how regular you go to
[1:00:26] church
[1:00:36] unless you've taken the time today
[1:00:40] to that foundation of jesus christ
[1:00:44] and place your hopes on that solid rock
[1:00:49] those beautiful buildings
[1:00:52] everything else
[1:00:54] that's all that's all right that's fine
[1:00:56] but all this will crumble
[1:01:04] the eternal rock which is jesus christ
[1:01:08] now the prophet turns the corner here
[1:01:10] and he says
[1:01:14] and we are starting off for god
[1:01:17] fundamental
[1:01:18] don't build upon any false foundation
[1:01:35] what happened with this evil
[1:02:04] he based
[1:02:25] [Music]
[1:02:51] [Music]
[1:02:59] we're making the wrong decisions
[1:03:02] right
[1:03:07] this is a key it says here
[1:03:11] discipline
[1:03:13] discipline
[1:04:50] here is your heart
[1:04:58] the one that built it found it foolishly
[1:05:00] stayed on the surface only
[1:05:03] in the deepest part of his home
[1:05:20] foreign
[1:05:25] our life is ventilated by different
[1:05:27] emotions that we have
[1:05:30] hate comes into our life
[1:05:33] anger comes into our life
[1:05:58] [Music]
[1:06:03] significant fundamental it means that
[1:06:05] there's no foundation fundamentals
[1:06:07] falsehood your foundation is false oh
[1:06:09] you obviously persona oh i hate that
[1:06:11] person
[1:06:12] you all knew i'm his father so i can't
[1:06:14] take care of you i hate my parents i've
[1:06:16] heard people
[1:06:30] honor them and respect
[1:06:42] that's not taking responsibility
[1:07:13] enough attention to you not the
[1:07:14] complaint
[1:07:17] that's why you wanted
[1:07:19] to pull that's what you wanted to talk
[1:07:20] about
[1:07:21] those three things
[1:07:26] until
[1:07:40] but as
[1:07:54] when you find a child doing something
[1:07:56] wrong
[1:08:00] full of chocolate oh it's all it wasn't
[1:08:01] me it was my brother
[1:08:02] my brother

[1:08:40] anytime we blame our traumas and
[1:08:42] complexes
[1:08:44] there are things that happen in life
[1:08:47] traumas happen
[1:08:50] we do understand
[1:09:03] it's a personal decision
[1:09:09] [Music]

[1:09:19] katrina hurricanes
[1:09:22] that happened so long ago
[1:09:26] it was katrina's a hurricane that ruined
[1:09:28] my life
[1:09:31] trying to blame something that it's you
[1:09:33] can't control when a person said excuse
[1:09:36] us when a person begins to make excuses
[1:09:39] because they know with them themselves
[1:09:44] that he could have changed the situation
[1:10:33] [Music]
