[Applause] oh [Music] [Applause] so [Music] [Music] when [Music] i [Music] m is [Music] my father isn't able to be here he's out of town what is our pastor and brother carlos carlos and before anything i want to thank the pastor for this opportunity is and as you're standing i'd like to uh do a quick prayer real quick if you'd be so kind of very happy to close your eyes we thank you for another day of life here today we're glad everyone here made it safe and that you help every person standing here today go home with something today i also want to ask the prayer for my father for our lord and savior jesus christ amen amen before anything i just want to read a quick scripture so if you can open your bibles to second corinthians but so reach like this yes you live wherefore come out from among them and be separate save the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you apart and i will be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty and i've been teaching i've been helping my uncle teach sunday school recently and i was speaking on mother's day and as i was speaking he wanted to say one thing and he said to our students that not everyone has a mother you know and he pointed to one class specifically specifically and it was the five to seven year olds de cinco and that's when i realized it could be the same situation with a father that's jesus christ amen this is and thankfully he's giving me a mother and a father today along with my grandpa and my grandma you know because they're just like my parents too okay and i love each and every one of them and you know but we're not perfect amen you know god created us to be human and one specific one we've been covering specifically was that anger is one letter short from danger as a kid i would get angry real easily i would get into arguments with people whether it was my parents padres my friends amigos my family my family and um one of the things was i would argue with my dad sometimes and i would it would be mainly because i didn't want to do something you know for example i i would never want to go to my martial arts school for example you know he was doing it for me for me and i didn't get that for the longest time however today i have a better understanding of what he was doing and you know without them uh i didn't go just for you know self-defense or nothing no no no no defense appropriate i would go you know they also taught us important lessons and without what i was taught there is and i was 16 at the time and anger got the best of me and so the first thing is i snapped at my mom i don't know why no that's just how i was feeling that dude and in those types of situations my dad knew how to take control instead of yelling at me invest in gritar or sending me to my room or something he would talk to me hell may have loved me and that always helped yes but for some reason today was different after him saying that he wanted to help me kill me i told him i didn't need him right now is how my dad's father is father would never let him talk to him the way i did and then i realized something my dad's father passed away when he was 16. and that's how that was right there he says all he had was his mom growing up with his brothers and sisters and it was a total of nine kids you know as a parent i've heard that having one or two kids is hard enough and so um there was this one time before it was actually father's day and it was a couple years ago yes um so i remember i had just gotten home and we wanted to go see our other side of the family and i went with my dad and he he said he wanted to say hi to everyone and as we were in the car he said he wanted to tell my grandma happy father's day he wanted to tell his mom happy father's day and i was confused at the time i was like i don't understand you know she's your mom didn't mother's day just pass the pasta and he's like yeah he needs to see but i didn't have my dad the whole time when we moved here to phoenix he said phoenix my mom was the only person i had my so i never thought about it that way and i'm just thankful that i had both my parents and for those of you don't know who my grandpa was and my dad would always tell me stories about him and how he always got to hear him speak about god and i'm lucky that he was able to share what he learned with me and one thing that stays with me pray and there was one point in my life where i was just confused and i didn't know what's going on as i grew older i didn't know what was going on i didn't know what was next amen and brother branham says the worst thing the devil can put upon you and i was just scared at the time so what i did was just look at you as i was working i just got down on my knees and i started praying and i knew that would help yo and i just trusted what my dad said in your confidence and so that's what i did but the devil was in my head i kept doubting and brother branham says to never doubt yeah and so i started asking myself all these questions like why me okay why why would god choose to help me porque and that was that god is the same yesterday today and forever and i'm just glad i remember that from learning it from my dad from church in iglesia from him taking me to church you know i remember as a kid i would never want to go to church i didn't i didn't i didn't want to i was just a kid at the time i thought why can't i just stay home like any other kid and one thing my dad told me and i'd be like yo this yeah why i just didn't understand either you know you wanted to know not india but he would tell me that his dad would tell him i'm thankful for him to always bring me to church [Music] i can't wait to see you once you get back i just hope you have a good trip overall god bless [Applause] god bless you all this morning before anything else i just want to say happy father's day and i want to thank my pastor for letting us speak and share his pulpit and this time i'm glad that they gave me more time to prepare like i've been telling everyone the last time they let me speak they gave me an hour before the service and this is my first time speaking for father's day and i hope that i do well so please forgive me if i say anything correct correcto anyways i want to spend the time i have talking about our fathers um according to the word a father should be a man who will govern the house who will protect his family a man who will instruct his children to prepare them against the evils of the world i say should because not again not everyone has a father and and unfortunately not every father is like this but my father is a very good example of this my father is the most hard-working person i've ever met not only is he humble and right standing with god but he is he is as wise as he is clever um and sometimes he tries to share that uh wisdom that knowledge with me is [Music] as a teenager i understand the want to rebel and like his advice is just only there to bring us down and just to remind you of your mistakes or that he thinks that we're going to make a lot more mistakes in the future but that's simply not true our fathers just don't want us to suffer like they have suffered honestly i never knew the hardships my father just so that our family could have a better life for those of you who don't know my father repairs air conditioners for a living area which he spends most of his days and in the hot sun or in an attic and not to joke about it but in the heat in arizona is so bad that you could probably use it to cook uh anyways one day i went to a work firm and i was complaining as usual thank you um and i asked my dad do you love your job and he told me well of course i can do this and never get tired of it then i asked did you always wanted to become a repairman it is and then i asked what happened um he told me that's not that's not what god had intended for me uh oh sorry i can't read my own handwriting um he said i'm glad god didn't give me what i wanted he says for it wasn't he said if god made me wealthy not only would i have no heart you know but my children would suffer for it my dad was happy to sacrifice his desire so that his children can have a life with christ and all i'm trying to say is that i love my father even though that i don't show it yeah this is no one seeing you and i i'm sorry um and and i'm proud to be called this son is [Applause] god bless you uh first of all i would like to thank our pastor dr ernest montoya for giving me the privilege to speak behind this pulpit i know it's not an easy thing to do and i know that um having the trust for someone to be back here is a big thing to give so i really appreciate him for that secondly i'd like to give my respect to all the fathers out there today happy father's day i know that it's um it's a great task to have and i know sometimes it can be thankless [Music] our brother carlos and our brother montoya sort of a father figure to us all helping us when we all need them other great men i know that my father has given me the privilege to be introduced to hombres um because i've gotten to know truly great man because um because of this religion and the thing and the gifts um and so going into that i want to go into um a scripture that i have doesn't necessarily the father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice and he that begeth a wise child shall have joy i really like this scripture because it showed that um a father that raises a good child a father that raises a righteous one will always [Music] and i really like that because i think that while it shows the side where you have to be a good son i think that it also reflects that um for for you to have a good son you have to be a good father and today the reason why i'm speaking is because i'm here to talk about the greatest man and father i've ever known in my life and that i believe has ever walked on earth so i want to say that those those of us with fathers we're truly blessed and we don't understand what we have until it's taken from us [Music] having a father is one of the greatest blessings you can ever have i know that my father truly practices what he preaches and while all humans make mistakes when i witness my father do something he's always done it perfectly i've never seen my father's faults and i've never seen his sins before nunca visto los pecados and i think that's really important because obviously as a human we all are as a human we all make mistakes but there's certain mistakes that that can be controlled who can see them obviously there's certain mistakes you can't avoid or when i um or when i made fun of my dad because he missed a turn signal when he's the one that lectures me about being such a good i've never seen my father angry to the point where i'm afraid of him i've never seen him complain about a bad day i've never seen him complain about the traffic as a matter of fact i've never been ashamed of who my father is i truly admire my father because of the things he's done and the great things that he's built he's built a great family and the fact that he did it so good no matter what others may think on a on one side he supported all six of his children and made sure that none of them ever lacked in life which many think is simple but it's truly a blessing we all take for granted and on the other side he's made us all feel very loved and cared for and he's given us all the love and attention that we need um i really admire my father my father was not born the man he is he was made and it was through the toughest trials and tribulations that i've ever heard come from a man my father and his brothers did not have easy lies as he's told me and his his story is truly one of greatness is because through all the troubles that he's had he's never forsaken god and i truly like the stories that he tells me because they all have a lesson whether whether he might not be trying to tell a lesson or he's telling me a story just for fun um like how he told me he spent money playing arcade games when he didn't have much money at all and he told me this really funny story one time and um it made me really happy because it showed that when he was my age she was a little bit like me when so i asked him one time and he told me that if he could be anything right now he would be he'd want to be a cook a uh building pancakes doesn't pay as much as you build houses haciendo pancakes so he told me that when he was my age he used to work as a cook at a certain job and he would work the night shift and at that night shift he there was um security guards in that building and uh while while they were working they were open but since it was not many people would come by at all so um since it was night time he'd do food prep while um while it was night time and sometimes it would take a while to cook and stuff like that and he would lay out food on the grill to cook or in a pot when so he'd ask some security guys like hey when the food is done cooking can you wake me up this is and they were all pretty cool they would say yes and take care of it and stuff [Music] but one security guard was like what are you doing like it's your job so one day while uh while he was cooking and he was cool with the security guards they asked if he could make them some sandwiches and he was like yeah like you're my homie like i'll make a sandwich so um while he was making them he finished making them up sandwiches and he was like hey i'm going to make some for you guys but not for that one guy he said he and he would call one of them and he would say i want you to take your sandwich and i want you to call one at a time to come get the sandwich until we get to that guy so they went one at a time getting their sandwiches getting their sandwiches until that one guy didn't get anything and uh he went up to my dad and he was like so where's where's my sandwich sandwich it was like sandwich i didn't make you a sandwich sandwich you cannot taste some sandwich and uh i think i think that was really nice because it showed that my dad was was a human yes sometimes i think my dad is a robot the way he doesn't talk at all sometimes for father's day i know that he loves steaks that that expensive steak is so uh since since i just got that paycheck i was like hey dad you want me to take you out to longhorn steakhouse [Music] [Music] that's crazy like what can i do to get this guy to show some kind of emotion see what he wants and uh and i i i really do want him to show some emotions sometimes especially when i get awards at school and stuff like that and i show him and sometimes i want something more than a muy bien gordon solo un muy bien and so so coming from that um does we need a little i've always wanted to be like my dad and he's told me about his youth and all his stories have meaning it was um things that things that i could relate to him about i wanted to be the type of man that my father was a useful man i didn't want to be like well if we have hamburger buns and hamburger bread we're all good on food guys so um i recently took a job and i do this stuff because i want to be like my father and uh so i know for a fact that some people might consider it foolish because my mother has always told me how hard my father works i'd do anything to be the kind of man that my father is truly truly a man in a different caliber yes amanda that all men should strive to be like that i want to strive to be like i do this also that i can honor in some way everything that he's done for me and i really could not thank him enough for that no matter what my demeanor my behavior might say i never intend to leave the gift that god gave me [Music] and a loving mother and a house that worships god is the greatest honor that i think that i think my dad will always be proud of okay my me no matter what i am um i'll be who i am with god at my side because truly what would we be without god i thank god for my father every day and for the kind of man he is because he's a good man and i truly believe that the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord and my father is a man that people have come to pray around for help he is he's a soft-spoken man of many trades and talents and uh although we strive to be like my father so i just want to say that you should never forget that um a father a parent is the best gift you you can ever have father and especially me and my little brother my dad and sometimes i take that for granted um i try to work as much as i can just so i can have some semblance of what my dad has done for us to be in the place we are right now it'll never be anything compared to what my father has done for me and my family he deserves a son who reflects that i think i'll always try to do my best so that i can be someone he's proud of me the way i look at my dad and say that's my dad that's one of the greatest men on earth i want to be a son and a child who can whom my father can say that's my son and he's one of the greatest sons on earth and with that i just want to say god bless you all happy father's day tall fathers and families and let's celebrate what our fathers have done for us not today but every day god [Applause] it is an honor for me to stand before you this beautiful resurrection sunday morning and i'd like to thank my pastor for this opportunity that he's given me to speak about my father so me my father i see him as a great man and although times were not always the best of times for us in our family but i believe it was all with a purpose in god's plan i could say that everything that we went through it all it was each had a step for each and every single one of us and today i would just like to speak about a little testimony of my first experience with the lord through the circumstances of my father and i believe that if it wasn't never for where the condition that my father was in i would have never had my first experience and i love my father with all of my heart so when i say these things i don't say these things as something bad and it was at the time where my father was about to get out of prison and while he was in there i believe with all of my heart that he was a changed man the same man that went in was not the same one that came out because even while he was in there he was showing me great faith that i've never seen before when he was in there when we'd go to visit him on the sunday's torts the last few months that he was about to get out on saturdays when we'd go we'd see him and he'd always point to a little corner right outside the prison and he says on this day at this hour you're going to come and you're going to come pick me up right there and for me i i had doubt in my heart come on it's like really you heard what the lawyers and what the judge said and they said that you're going back to mexico and for me that was but i heard my father every saturday the last few months he'd always say the same thing and i'd hear him and i'd hear him and i just and i just couldn't believe it because because me growing up in the u.s you learn about what power the judge has gone you see the last the the words that they say they have the power to sentence somebody so i knew that what the judge says was final final and that no matter what happened or what could happen he was they told they told him that you're going back to mexico so for me that was such a there was a burden in my heart because i had doubt and i didn't know what to believe as much as i wanted to believe that my father was going to come out here in the uk in the and then my mom went to the lawyers to to see what if and she went to the one that she had before and she and the lawyer told her the exact same thing he said there's nothing don't waste your money on me there's nothing i can do in me because he's going to go back to mexico and my mother told the lawyer that what my father was saying what he's saying he's going to come out here and then the lawyer says you go and you tell him what i said and if he doesn't believe believe you tell him to call me and i'll tell them myself and my mother tells me she can't remember if she told my father what the lawyer said because my mom saw the faith that my father had and she didn't want to disrupt it and so but to me thinking about it now that i can look back on it i don't think if my mother would my mother would have told her what the lawyer said sh it would have not disrupted my father because as i said i believe that my father was a changed man in that prison and i've heard brother bernie and i've heard brother branham say the same thing hermano bernier that once the doctors give up on you once the judges and the lawyers lost when everybody in the world is against you that's the perfect time for god to work so i believe it wouldn't have disrupted him but to me i still couldn't unders at that time i didn't understand and around that time was on march it was when tabernacle had their camp at pine rock in pine rock and i've always heard about camp it's like if you have a need if you have a if there's something in your heart go to camp and my mother asked me if i wanted to go and i said yes i want to go. and this is probably one of the first times i in my life that i can remember that i went to a camper i went to a service wanting something from the lord so i put my faith in in god to see what he could do of this and i remember going to camp friday service came recording i just remember that leaving camp i just felt like the burden that was in my heart it got lifted and then we'd go again the next saturday to go visit my father and he'd be saying the exact same thing but this time i didn't see it in the eyes of of what the world or what the lawyers of what the judge had said and come doing nothing play and all i heard from the voice that came from the from the phone is like like it's time come pick me up exactly where i told you to know that no matter what i go through in my life or whatever whatever happens with our family the same faith that his the same faith that he had the exact same faith that i can have and to see that example to see someone that i can that i see every day that the world was against but he put his faith in something greater than the world and i believe that even though we struggled for so many years i'm grateful for each and every single one of those years because if it wasn't for those years i don't think i'd be able to stand before you today to not have my father for an important part of my life a and that was just for each and every one of us in our family gonna get stronger to build that character that god loves you i remember one of my uncles while my father was in prison he asked me do you love your father and without a second going by i said yes i love my father and he was surprised because that was that was a quick answer and he asked me why i said well because he's my dad i have to love him and now that i think now that i can look back on it and i can look now i can say that while my dad was in the prison god showed him grace mercy and love and forgiveness so if god showed if god forgave my father and showed him love that means i have to forgive him and i have to love my father so to me my dad is this is a great man everything that happened to us i don't hold it against them because i wouldn't be here today without it just like all of you fathers and my pastor that are great example for your sons that we can see that are in their position where they need to be okay because i believe if i were to just sit down on one of the benches i've learned so much about him more than more now than any time um he's trying to teach me something so if i said anything that he may not like i'll just wait for that phone call later i just wanted to say to all the dads here happy father's day felicia del padre and to my dad that's watching me online on internet i just want to say that i love you i've always loved you and i will continue loving [Applause] if you want to stand for a moment so you can rest paradise jose also rests for a little bit and specifically happy father's day to my father i'm very proud to be his son you may take your seat once again god bless you guys happy to be here stay felicia very happy to have heard from everyone felicia de calabuno you are my nephew nathan and listen my brother-in-law and nathan as well yeah you know it's a great man it's always been had a good head yes you know very blessed to have been married into this family almost as blessed as brenda has been to varian to mine a pillar as well in this church and happy father to our brothers and my family i have my brother albert happy father's day to him we're very fortunate to have brother trinity foreign he really only speaks about things that he lives he he spoke a time in nacogdoches texas texas about the secrets of daily living and in these details it's it's a it becomes so great in just the way that he speaks that one would speak to their wife or the one that once would speak to the kids when they get home he said a thing when we were there in texas you never want to forget your anniversary all right just forget it once it must be that day one another and of course that he's not saying to forget it but he spoke a lot on on little details you know and he talks about how when he started in this message he wanted to share with his coworkers he didn't know what books to take so he asked our brother paul garcia paul garcia jr and he told him we'll just leave them the message and then they'll see something and then they'll want to come to church just leave them alive and you know and when reflecting on this father's day i was listening to a message of perseverance it's difficult to find a lot on father's day so i looked for a message that was preached on this day on june 19th this is [Music] of different characters in the bible the of a sister that comes from california to hear him speak leonard california you know they weren't going to do a prayer that day but she found a way she found a way to be with brother branham she had a tumor and then she was able to get prayed for really quickly and he says he talks about brother manana brother bannon speaks it was a brother that he called manana yes because he was so slow and she you know he had to have been persevering they told my father not so long ago you know oh he he had cancer but he was still working there like oh in the same manner when he had a small stroke and he in the same way you know it was difficult time for all of us but we were able to make it through but foreign and you know um just uh and what was this said last week spoke on uh [Music] brother bernie garcia iii bernie garcia and i had to speak to him about a few things and we just started talking about about our families and my and he told me that recently he brother bernie on the third sentence he was having a conversation with his father brother bernie jr things started to get a lot better when brother trini was saved that's what he was saying about about my father because he dedicated his life to the people and he was always there willing to help yes [Music] and i'm very grateful but i have that as my father and i wanted to share that with you [Music] and your name [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] that also includes the grandparents and the great grandparents that's the best that i can wish each father including me including myself even though nathan isn't here but i i want to say happy father's day not to just those who are here foreign [Music] ricardo [Music] and then a father's prayer prayers dear god make me the kind of man my son thinks i am i gave but here as our but if we have enough to buy them a gift that's good but if you don't have enough to buy them a little gift just tell your father that you love them that's it i was already the father of two sons or two children when i told my father that i loved them a bit ashamed of our parents or
