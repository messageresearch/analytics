[18:20] we're going to continue on the subject
[18:21] that we've been having that's the
[18:23] manifestation of the sons of god
[18:31] this is the seventh message that deals
[18:32] with the manifestation of the sons of
[18:34] god
[18:39] title to the tape is a letter to the
[18:41] romans number 27.
[18:49] for me it's been a study of a lot of
[18:51] benefit
[18:53] buenos
[19:06] as i review the message of scripture i
[19:08] seem like i had never heard it before
[19:12] this just keeps me stimulated
[19:18] there are certain things that are just
[19:20] tying together completely especially
[19:28] not trusting god that he gives us the
[19:30] complete revelation of the day that
[19:31] we're living in
[19:34] revelation
[19:36] because if he does give us a revelation
[19:38] of the day that we're living in no nos
[19:42] we won't be idle
[19:43] uh
[19:51] we see that this is a time period when
[19:53] the sons of god are to be manifested
[19:59] we know that manifested means to declare
[20:01] to manifest a show esta is
[20:08] this is the age when the children of god
[20:10] god's sons will be made known who they
[20:18] are see that even from the fall back
[20:21] there in the garden of eden all creation
[20:23] has been waiting for this day
[20:27] when that backsliding took place during
[20:29] the garden of eden
[21:00] is the only
[21:15] hearing them preach
[21:17] hamas
[21:20] but they'll never be able to take you to
[21:22] the spot
[21:27] where you can recognize the day that
[21:28] we're
[22:10] that's
[22:37] i'm going to continue on this message of
[22:38] manifestation of the sons of god
[22:44] and there's a few items i want to read
[22:45] to you from the message
[22:48] and to be able to read you these little
[22:50] items
[23:24] and as we've talked about the message
[23:25] that which has been brought to us by the
[23:27] messenger of the age
[23:34] we have talked and said that the wheat
[23:36] plant has four major stages to it
[23:42] the first part once the seed versus
[23:44] foreign
[24:15] the second part is the castle
[24:19] the third part is a shock
[24:24] and the fourth part is the seed
[24:29] you that are a believer if you believe
[24:44] it has four parts
[24:48] first part
[24:53] he says
[25:17] now in english the first part
[25:20] second part tassel
[25:22] second part third part the shark and the
[25:25] fourth part green the seed the grain
[25:27] okay
[25:28] whatever the math once again
[25:31] without any help number one
[25:35] second part
[25:36] third part
[25:38] fourth part
[25:40] drain
[26:13] how many stages of parts of the wheat
[26:15] plant i've showed you how many are you
[26:17] going to answer okay
[26:20] okay thank you
[26:36] that's how god raises up the individual
[26:42] he also goes to four parts
[26:48] to be able to get to where he has to get
[26:50] the premier party
[27:53] that's it in english i want to be sure
[27:54] that everyone understands me
[27:59] god brings the individual
[28:02] in four steps the same as
[28:04] a wheat plant
[28:07] now the first part is justification
[28:09] sanctification is the second part then
[28:11] you're born a child of god then you're
[28:13] placed or adapted or sealed
[28:17] so let's say together a brother and he
[28:19] will say the first second third fourth
[28:20] and then you say right after him i want
[28:22] to be sure he stays
[28:24] with us
[28:25] so justification justification
[28:28] sanctification sanctification
[28:30] born a son born
[28:33] placed played
[28:34] adopted adopted or sealed
[28:41] we've all heard that haven't we
[28:46] so how many parts does the wheat plant
[28:48] have
[28:55] so how many stages does a christian go
[28:56] through it's four
[28:59] movies
[29:06] we find likewise
[29:38] they they won't be able to follow me
[29:42] just put me the pyramid there that's in
[29:44] my head
[29:45] and wrap down
[29:47] seven steps up
[29:49] and then with a with a headstone on top
[30:04] here we are in 1985. the
[30:20] third
[31:17] uh
[31:21] if you count
[31:25] emphasis number one
[31:29] number two in
[32:28] is the capstone
[32:30] that's number four
[32:34] the original seed
[32:38] if you believe that say yeah
[32:39] no notice are you
[33:08] they were carriers
[34:18] because when jesus was
[34:46] that was buried
[35:01] bloom
[35:02] and it's all its height
[35:05] but then the second age came in
[35:07] it started decreasing that by the third
[35:09] age
[35:11] died
[35:13] and it was buried
[35:42] is
[36:02] finally
[36:07] excommunicated
[36:09] you look at the mammoth grain
[36:38] is
[37:03] let's go back again
[37:34] you
[38:00] i want you to understand just one little
[38:01] thing
[38:29] 16 verse 20.
[38:47] verily verily i say unto you that ye
[38:49] shall weep and lament but the world
[38:51] shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful
[38:54] but your sorrow shall be turned into joy
[38:58] the
[39:08] a woman when she is in travail has
[39:10] sorrow because her hour has come but as
[39:12] soon as she is delivered of the child
[39:14] she remembers her sorrow no more the
[39:17] anguish for joy that a man is born into
[39:19] the world
[39:26] well the third
[39:40] but rather in
[40:02] fulfillment finish of everything would
[40:03] be taking place
[40:08] now the latest century began 1906.
[40:13] the messenger came to rebuke the bliss
[40:18] was born in 1909

[51:47] he that hasn't let him hear what the
[51:48] spirit says into the churches
[51:59] remember later on i gave you some calls
[52:00] to prove that
[54:07] is
[54:35] a little bit
