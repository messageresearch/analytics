Celestial we thank you for another day of life and we thank you for letting us be in your house today we ask that you help the speakers that they do and say the right things that they may take something with them from our lessons I asked all these things I'm in uh while you're still standing can you please open your Bibles uh we'll be reading First Corinthians chapter 10 13. once you have it please indicate it by saying amen it reads hello uh no tape no temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man God is faithful and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability but with the Temptation he will also provide a way of Escape that you may be able to endure it is uh you may take your seats uh before I begin in this case I I want to thank God and my pastor for giving us this opportunity to speak before you okay and normally I would say I'm a bit nervous but gladly with more experience I'm a little bit less experience um and being given the chance to speak to you I want to share a question a question that I've heard and asked myself and I I doubt I'm the only one in this room who's hadn't heard this question before the question is why is it that during our times of hardship when we ask God for help foreign sorry when I asked this question um my my fellow classmates from the Sunday School couldn't answer it but the teacher was able to help me and she told me you know why he's silent um because God is Not only a Creator but he is a teacher maestro we are his students and he is our teacher yeah I'm going to be a bit honest when I heard that I was still a bit confused and then she continued with this a teacher remains silent silencio when the students are doing a test examine God stays silent silencio he doesn't say or do anything because he already gave you what you need okay he gave you everything you could possibly need to overcome the time and when God is handing out tasks he won't give you something that you can't handle just like how a teacher doesn't begin the class with the with the test is you don't take a class in the in the first day they automatically give you a testament no that's not how it works the teacher gives it after you've taken the class after you've studied the material is a teacher doesn't pass out a test to his students until they feel confident that their students can succeed is so if God is the teacher Maestro then what is the devil well the devil's the actual test is remember the test that we've been giveness is a test for Redemption and Redemption is knowing every trick the devil has El Diablo or in other words Redemption is withstanding the devil is and when you're giving it when you give been given a testament you see like a bunch of multiple choice and have you ever wondered uh why are there more answers and questions it's because it to trick you yes and like a testament the devil will question to confuse you so that you picked the wrong answer is correct and the reason why it's because the devil doesn't actually have any power like when you've been given a test does this piece of paper have power over here does it tell you where to go where to sleep no no if you wanted to you could just crumple it up and throw it away so if it has no power over you over me then why do people why do kids and students because they believe it has power over them okay and that's how the devil gets his power yes he gets it because we give it to him when we listen to his lies we allow him to control part of our lives and I promise you this if you give him an inch he'll go for a mile now here's something that some people don't know many people fear the test or fear the devil Diablo but in truth it's the devil who fears you know why else would you think he would be attacking you okay he doesn't attack the week he's he attacks you because he's afraid he's afraid of what you might become remember you are a child of God and if you have the faith you can tame the Seas and you the mountains and he attacks because he doesn't want that to happen but little does he know that those questions those tests is uh uh are actually making us stronger and returning to my first question why God stays silence is because he knows the best way to teach someone is to have that person do it themselves uh if we constantly have someone giving us the answers then we never hope to learn anything this is it's like that kid who has Google's everything on his phone it's like oh I know everything they say no you know but once you take away that phone where am I don't destroy so if you ever wondered if you're not hearing anything from God and that means you're probably still taking the test yeah and like a test you have a timeline and speaking of time limits so I'll pass it along to my brother and God bless you and thank you thank you God bless you it's good to be in the house of the Lord once again before anything I'd like to thank my pastor for this opportunity foreign it feels a bit weird being up here again yeah I just got back from out of town I just got back yesterday evening and because the day right before I left I got a message on my phone and it was the list of who was speaking nice thing my name is not getting out of this one this is your yes I reckon now um but God has a reason for everything and um I know the importance of being obediente and I just want to thank the Lord Jesus Christ for keeping my family and I safe and bringing us home safely and so we're going to start um well I want to talk more on Redemption and well we know that Redemption is the action of saving is and we as humans and we were found guilty of sin we must um guilty found guilty of sin see thank you and um you know that's how we were born you know that's how uh it was from the very beginning for us we were born in San Francisco and so but then we have Jesus Jesus who paid the full price at Calvary okay the perfect sacrifice so then we ask ourselves and when we hear the message you know there are a lot of things we learn right then at the same time it seems like we have so much left to learn and um I say that because at times it gets confusing and see man has tried to save himself but it doesn't work that way um execution see the prophet said by grace are you saved through faith and that's the only thing that can save you yes God's grace um by definition is the unearned or unmerited kindness is that um and forgiveness of God so there's not no other just like it right and yet no one else could compare to God's grace you know sometimes we think we're the only ones that have the right to hear this message but he's a god of allos and he cares for each and every one of us you know brother Bernie said God deals with all Races um and we know that the gospel means the good news and with God there is no exception of a personas when he sees us he sees us all on the same level but with the love God has he wants to test us challenge us like my brother was saying we're going to go through tests he's going to use these trials to make us stronger and putting us closer to him closer to the light because when the gospel is in our grass he looks to see what we do with it and you know there have been many things in our path but we can overcome because he's with us no matter what we can overcome these old habits you know the ones that hold us back the problem is to us it's like nature you know brother Branham said you could get a pig you know wash them up clean them up but sooner or later he'll return to that regress because of his nature but we have to learn to accept see there's no way to tell someone to pray so many times you know patches when you're putting on a clothes but the difference here is the clothes is all right so we all have to say we're all guilty there's no such thing because the nature we were born so we have to accept Jesus Christ because he was the son of God and the gospel is and the Apostle Paul says I want you to know that God is a spirit and this is God's gospel yes the same guy left his place to live on this earth when he was born he was born with a purpose God said then and there is if a person accepts me if a person comes to me as soon as he receives and when it's performed the person there who accepts me is their savior Salvador is declared innocent innocente and I was listening to this message uh brother Bernie was speaking and he said that that was the time when he would reach a maturity and the decision with full awareness he would go to Calvary calvario be taken to the cross and right then and there is so the sap of the tree would come out because Jesus is the tree of life and them also being a tree that was the Bible titles um a human being as a tree that the person is a tree we have to stay before the Shadows of the Cross because when Jesus went to Calvary he brought his cross when something casts the shadow you know it shows there's light is and the light of the Gospel evangelo was displaying a shadow of the Cross um and when a person can receive the Revelation Revelation and accept the gospel of God now picture this is the step is still not being poured upon him the shadow is drawing him to that cross and the Apostle Paul says when we accept Jesus Jesus we are justified by faith but the life of the tree is not in us yet because we have to stay in that Shadows the time comes when the cross no longer cast The Shadow because the shadow is there for us to receive shelter and until the Revelation comes down from God um I'm sorry yeah until the Revelation comes down from God is he he want he went to the Cross to surrender his life on our behalfarte but the only way we can be a Church of the Living God is for the life of that tree is to return to every tree in the church so we as trees are are drawn by the cross and we could be justified by faith but you'll never reach Perfection unless that shadow goes away become one with that tree yes and so once we become one the life of that tree returns to that worshiper you know it's it's not a dry lifeless tree it's not under the shadow anymore and [Music] but the only thing is we have to learn to get to that point because we live a Christian Life Christiana but it's not an easy one you know tests will come in our way okay you know many things stand in our way which of course and we never know what to expect from the future so it could sometimes bring fear to us and you know that's the worst thing the devil could put upon us this is you know when we go through a test it's hard to go through it is if there's just fear holding us down Orlando you know it could be caused by both physical and emotional scenarios emotional you know and either or I would always find a way to like sneak up on YouTube you know but the one thing that's always helped me is to counterfeit it's um with confidence you know that's something I've always told my students with confidence basically what that means is you know we can't go on worrying about what will happen you know foreign I want to read a quick scripture and it's going to be Isaiah 41 10. yes it reads like this fear fear thou not for I am with d be not dismayed for I am thy God I will straighten thee yeah I will help thee hey I will uphold thee with the hand with the right hand of my righteousness is you know the Bible speaks the truth and I believe that with all my heart will always be with us give us the strength when we need to yeah like my brother said God won't give us something we can't handle no matter what you're dealing with you know if you don't know like the right direction to look to know correct because he's the same God okay yesterday today and forever [Applause] God bless you Brothers can you hear me no yeah you hear me see okay God bless you Brothers it's a pleasure to be here with you this morning I think my passion for this opportunity and all of you who made the effort because reward you for that amen amen simplicity you can talk about everything that we learn about in life we can make it so simple but at the same time we can talk about the same subject with just bigger words that are saying the same thing but maybe it sounds a bit different so what I want to say with that this is sometimes we could talk about mysteries about things in the Bible that maybe we don't have full understanding of but in the end there's some questions I have here he is gathered with some people at work that they are very intelligent in what they do he he always says and sometimes they talk about nature the laws of nature of gravity why they're here as they always Point towards science that it's a product of a mind foreign amen Brothers DNA is so many genetic codes that is not in its place it's a very big problem how is it possible that every court is in its perfect place out of nowhere that was created by a mind the mind of the Lord Jesus Christ uh Almar or if I went to the ocean or the sea is and I write a name down in the sand no no no foreign [Music] [Music] come on I'm asking you as a baseball player what do you know about yourself maybe when he understands I was going to say well I have two arms think of those Spears I have two feet I have to grab the me in one way I have to throw the ball with another hand Anton says in that way in which she explains it is that's something how we can explain as Christians who we are um is understanding me amen where Body Spirit and soul and so the body has five channels it is which are the five senses in those five senses reasoning how you resolve problems and I say that because when I heard it is reasoning is of why I did what I did in ton says it's more like kindness a minerals amen in the soul is the nature of your spirit says that the soul and the spirit are binded we can't talk about one without talking about the other yes the deepest part of a man we know that our soul is so precious foreign [Music] and sometimes they even fight why are they allowing what are they allowing in their mind is they're taking care of something based on their emotions or their feelings taking care of our soul is by being around the things of God amen amen it's going to church it's having that Fellowship it's praying to the Lord Jesus Christ that is feeding our soul because if we do none of that is the only way we can feed our soul then in what condition is our soul going to be in one way or another it has to be fed and Thorn says then we talk about a seed is it could represent a Christian we all know that a seed has to be planted it has to be buried in the dirt so I can process its nature I think that if we are a seed and we're planted in the soil or in the earth inside there's no longer any light maybe we would be scared would be alone so for a moment we would be confused then come the sun rays Amen brother again are you falling and the seed says that it hurts he doesn't like this is and it begins to produce its own fruit and it is not always in darkness now when you get past the trial is when you come out to the light you can see where you came from you can see the process and you can understand amen Brothers and then when we understand brothers and when God gives us more revelation he is and as we look at certain points in our lives Altos in high points and we look at our high points [Music] that we always would like to be there we like to be closest to God as possible who wants to be the best version of themselves that version is not I can do it all that version is in discipline it has parameters that parameter is like a circle discipline is the same way you know that you have to do something you can't go too far off because you have to stay within those parameters that is discipline it is a Nago ESO I don't do that I don't drink this no full moon I don't smoke I don't hang around with these people because of your discipline is you're focused on a reward you know that one of these days or Jesus Christ is going to return Yes and that's why we wake up each morning thanking the Lord Jesus Christ is that everything we're going through is worth it you're placing those parameters you're just no longer hanging around with those people that are doing you bad yet there are things that are going to take us with the Lord Jesus Christ there are things that we don't do you can play Stan Brothers will be praying Brothers if you have a need foreign [Music] it's always at our side and it's something that we could never put value on because you are eternal [Music] [Music] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen [Music] thank you [Music]
