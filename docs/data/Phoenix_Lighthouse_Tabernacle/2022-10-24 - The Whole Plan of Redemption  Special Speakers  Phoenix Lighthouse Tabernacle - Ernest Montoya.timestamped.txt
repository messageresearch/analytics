[43:18] foreign
[43:44] I was telling my brother I'm happy for
[43:46] him
[43:47] I know people who have to work outside
[43:51] it's going to get slightly easier for
[43:53] them now
[43:56] I'm happy to be here in front of you
[43:59] this morning
[44:00] it's quite the privilege
[44:03] I'd like to thank our pastor for the
[44:05] trust he puts in me
[44:09] right now he currently finds himself in
[44:11] Peru
[44:12] and I was able to watch some of the
[44:14] services
[44:16] and it's good to see that they're
[44:18] getting blessed over there yes
[44:22] in your scriptures
[44:25] we're going to be doing the base
[44:27] scripture which is in Hebrews 9 11.
[44:35] it indicated it was an amen once you
[44:37] have it
[44:41] reached us
[44:44] Christ being come and high priest of
[44:46] good things to come by greater and more
[44:48] perfect Tabernacle not made with hands
[44:50] that is to say not of this building
[44:57] foreign
[45:06] caps but by his own blood he entered in
[45:08] once into the holy Place having obtained
[45:11] Eternal Redemption for us
[45:14] is
[45:23] the blood of bulls and goats in the
[45:25] ashes of in heifer sprinkling the
[45:27] unclean Sanctified to the purifying of
[45:29] the flesh
[45:38] de la carne how much more shall the
[45:41] blood of Christ who through the eternal
[45:43] spirit offered himself without spot to
[45:45] God Purge your conscience from dead
[45:46] Works to serve the Living God
[45:50] is
[46:03] your heavenly father
[46:06] we thank you for the chance you give us
[46:08] to be here once again
[46:12] it's a beautiful morning Lord
[46:14] and I think we're all thankful to be
[46:16] here this morning
[46:19] I pray for those who are here Lord
[46:22] and those who are watching us
[46:26] you give them all the portion they need
[46:30] will you be with me
[46:33] the rest of my brothers will be speaking
[46:36] may you also be with our interpreter
[46:38] because we do this all for your honor
[46:41] and Glory
[46:44] Jesus Christ
[46:47] amen amen me take your seats
[46:52] so we read that scripture
[46:55] Hebrews 9 11.
[46:57] you know and I think by now it's a
[46:59] scripture that many maybe most of us
[47:01] know by memory
[47:04] you could probably just recite it
[47:06] without having to read it
[47:08] but it's good that we read it over over
[47:10] and over
[47:12] I think the key lies there in repetition
[47:16] repetition is the more we repeat
[47:19] the more we practice
[47:23] makes perfect
[47:26] and ideally we want to be perfect
[47:30] why do we want to be perfect
[47:32] because we want to be like Christ
[47:35] in Christ himself is
[47:38] Perfecto he had to be perfect
[47:43] because he died for our sins
[47:46] in order for that sacrifice foreign
[47:59] how many are happy this morning for that
[48:01] sacrifice
[48:03] I'm thankful for that great blessing
[48:05] that he died for my sins on that cross
[48:09] touching on the script teaching on on
[48:11] Redemption
[48:13] it's just still a topic we're covering
[48:18] and this the message I was listening to
[48:21] is
[48:22] a job from 1955
[48:30] and I really enjoyed it
[48:33] but it's so good I could I could never
[48:35] do it justice I could never say the
[48:38] stuff he said
[48:43] but I have just a few quotes here that I
[48:45] liked from the message
[48:48] and here are the first one I have is did
[48:51] you know exemption was even before the
[48:54] planet Redemption was laid out before
[48:55] the world was ever formed
[49:03] he says think of that he said God
[49:06] foreseeing and making a way of
[49:08] redemption before he even made the world
[49:18] and I think that right there is great
[49:21] that's a topic that many of the youth
[49:23] have come up have have touched on
[49:27] even before the world was formed
[49:31] there was already a plan laid out
[49:33] yesterday that's because God being
[49:35] all-knowing
[49:37] he knew what was going to happen
[49:43] but even then he already laid out a plan
[49:46] for us
[49:48] and that's something I really appreciate
[49:51] and it goes on
[49:53] for the Bible plainly says that Christ
[49:55] was predestinated
[49:59] or ordained
[50:02] and was the Lamb of God
[50:05] slain before the foundation of the world
[50:09] that's right I see yes way before the
[50:12] world was made
[50:14] God had a Plan of Redemption yesterday
[50:20] it's not just for myself but for
[50:22] yourself
[50:23] is that he knew there was something I
[50:26] was listening to our pastor speak over
[50:27] there in Peru
[50:31] he was here we had our strength
[50:36] we had our weaknesses
[50:39] but he didn't focus on our weaknesses
[50:43] and I'm so thankful for that
[50:46] because we have a perfect sacrifice
[50:56] he says that God doesn't look at us
[51:00] he has to look at the sacrament foreign
[52:01] something I got to do brother Branham
[52:05] says no you don't have to do one thing I
[52:09] said
[52:11] it's by Grace you're saved
[52:15] see see not nothing that you do there
[52:18] isn't one thing you could do that would
[52:20] amount to anything
[52:28] the plants already made redemptions
[52:31] already paid for the only thing you have
[52:33] to do is accept it
[52:37] so that sounds really simple
[52:40] that's what we have to do
[52:42] we know about it and we have to accept
[52:45] it you know and some of this thoughts
[52:48] started
[52:50] I was up here interpreting for our
[52:52] brothers when they were up here uh or a
[52:54] couple of young brothers
[52:57] and maybe my brother will agree here
[53:01] when you're an interpreter I feel an
[53:04] advantage you have
[53:07] you have to everything they say you have
[53:10] to process it as well
[53:14] so you feel like you maybe get a little
[53:16] bit of a better understanding than if
[53:18] you were sitting down on the benches
[53:23] and uh one thing everything all my
[53:25] brothers said impacted me
[53:30] one thing that our brother Antonio has
[53:32] said
[53:34] he mentioned a quote from I believe it
[53:36] was questions and answers on the seals
[53:42] and I'm paraphrasing here this is
[53:45] but he he talked about how God didn't
[53:48] present himself to certain people
[53:50] because
[53:53] they weren't even redeemable
[54:00] and so in other words if he presented
[54:03] himself to you
[54:05] it's because you're redeemable
[54:07] and that when he said that impacted me
[54:12] and I immediately started thinking of a
[54:14] lot of people
[54:16] so I think maybe there's people I know
[54:19] who are currently not in church he says
[54:22] maybe they've gone away from church
[54:26] but they know about it and it's been
[54:30] presented to them
[54:31] therefore and Don says they're
[54:33] redeemable yes I feel that I should give
[54:36] you some comfort
[54:38] maybe it's your brother or it's a
[54:40] sibling or something
[54:42] they too are redeemable
[54:44] and what what does redeemable mean
[54:47] you're able to be recovered or safe from
[54:50] false or bad aspects
[54:56] a synonym for that
[54:59] is being restorable yes
[55:03] and restorable is you're capable of
[55:05] being restored or brought to a former
[55:07] conditions
[55:13] and that's what we want to restore that
[55:15] condition or restore that fellowship
[55:17] with our Lord and savior
[55:21] so if you're here this morning
[55:24] you know you're redeemable
[55:26] this isn't by coincidence no it's
[55:28] coincidence that you know about this
[55:30] message
[55:31] and God's presents himself to you in
[55:33] your life
[55:36] and to wrap up another quote from the
[55:38] same message
[55:41] this one I like I like the way brother
[55:44] bam says
[55:46] so he says you he's talking about God
[55:49] you know we as humans no we we know the
[55:53] importance of a plan
[55:55] is
[55:56] a plan a financial plan
[55:59] financiero or maybe it's a career plan
[56:03] or it's an education plan
[56:05] it's something that requires you to
[56:07] maybe sit down and think about it
[56:26] he had it in his great heart how he
[56:29] would bring this all about
[56:34] and then if he foreknew the church
[56:36] foreknew Christ for another plan and set
[56:39] it all in order
[56:40] foreign
[57:07] God's working all things together for
[57:10] those for the good to those that love
[57:12] him
[57:13] foreign
[57:47] [Applause]
[57:52] a little bit bigger ones God bless you
[57:55] brother
[57:57] we greet you in the name of our Lord
[57:59] Jesus Christ
[58:03] when I continue with the subject
[58:06] first I'd like to thank my pastor yeah
[58:10] the Lord Jesus Christ for this
[58:12] opportunity
[58:18] my brothers in Iowa our brothers
[58:23] in South America
[58:25] God bless you brethren
[58:28] come on
[58:31] what's up brother
[58:34] then soon Redemption is
[58:38] as we've been learning
[58:41] crucial something crucial importante
[58:45] something important is necessary it's
[58:47] necessary we will to be able to live
[58:51] is uh is
[58:54] it's a little of everything brother
[58:57] but more than one thing
[59:00] because Redemption
[59:04] it is happiness is the lord it's pain
[59:09] trials
[59:11] is really Eterna it's eternal life
[59:15] as I told you a little bit of everything
[59:18] is
[59:20] crucification the crucifixion
[59:24] die into this world is
[59:28] necessary in the Plan of Redemption
[59:33] everything begins with a thought
[59:54] hear the mind
[59:57] as I was studying he
[1:00:00] uh
[1:00:02] I know this message of brother Branham
[1:00:05] title communion is
[1:00:12] he begins to describe what the Lord
[1:00:15] Jesus Christ is going through at
[1:00:16] Gethsemane
[1:00:18] he begins
[1:00:25] from the cruel testing Anton says
[1:00:28] then he will not spare you
[1:00:31] or I from the cruel testing Jesus
[1:00:37] and Jesus was here confronting the
[1:00:39] greatest test he had ever had
[1:00:45] just before him
[1:00:49] with our once in final all-sufficient
[1:00:51] test must come
[1:00:57] the burdens of the entire world laid
[1:01:00] upon his blessed shoulder
[1:01:05] there was no one in all Heavens on earth
[1:01:08] that could ever stood it but him
[1:01:16] and to know that all of the sins of past
[1:01:19] sins and present sins and future sins
[1:01:22] rested upon this decision
[1:01:30] and it was one of the most greatest
[1:01:32] victories that Christ ever won or proved
[1:01:36] his great messiahship
[1:01:41] as when he said to God
[1:01:48] not my will
[1:01:50] now my will be done they will be done
[1:02:00] tormentors
[1:02:03] that was the greatest Victory he had
[1:02:06] ever won all the Demons of Torment was
[1:02:09] around to tempt him and try him
[1:02:13] the Lord Jesus Christ at everything in
[1:02:15] him that was that he needed
[1:02:18] and it's the same with us today
[1:02:21] everything we need
[1:02:24] we have God's word we have it brother
[1:02:31] when I begin to see him
[1:02:37] so I see something physical so I can
[1:02:39] better understand it
[1:02:40] something that I like to do
[1:02:44] I like to go to the mountains
[1:02:46] have a little exercise
[1:02:50] inside and I began to think
[1:02:53] foreign
[1:02:59] and they gave me everything that is
[1:03:01] necessary backpack
[1:03:05] water everything I would need
[1:03:10] even they bring a guide
[1:03:14] so you can make a way for me
[1:03:17] and climb the mountain
[1:03:20] in Julio
[1:03:25] and the temperature be 120 degrees here
[1:03:27] in Arizona
[1:03:30] about 1pm
[1:03:33] s
[1:03:37] but if we don't follow the guide
[1:03:41] if we don't use the equipment we've been
[1:03:43] given
[1:03:44] mucho we're going to struggle very much
[1:03:47] we could even die
[1:03:52] physically or spiritually
[1:03:56] and we all go through our Gethsemane
[1:04:00] we're all going to go through a moment
[1:04:02] in our lives
[1:04:05] there's so much Darkness
[1:04:08] we can't even find the answer
[1:04:13] many times
[1:04:18] as I told you he's giving us everything
[1:04:20] we need
[1:04:23] to overcome this trial and many more is
[1:04:55] our souls amen amen
[1:04:59] e
[1:05:00] Elementary
[1:05:05] in the same message
[1:05:07] and then he makes it personal yeah
[1:05:14] then The Temper came to me is
[1:05:21] that one time in all my life is
[1:05:41] there you are that's the reward for
[1:05:43] trying to serve him
[1:05:54] you mean that he'll take the young 22
[1:05:57] year old mother and lay her Yonder as a
[1:05:59] corpse in the morgue he said yes
[1:06:03] and then we'll take the precious baby
[1:06:05] your own flesh and blood
[1:06:08] and slam your prayer right in your face
[1:06:14] and then you mean to say that you will
[1:06:17] that you will serve him
[1:06:20] but this is going to happen to all of us
[1:06:24] we feel stronger than ever since
[1:06:31] we think we're doing the best we can in
[1:06:33] serving the lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:36] a trial will come to our lives okay
[1:06:56] he's treating you this way
[1:06:59] foreign
[1:07:28] foreign
[1:08:29] there's nothing you need to do but uh
[1:08:32] to be better
[1:08:35] you're already perfect for Kentucky
[1:08:38] because the sacrifice is perfect
[1:08:41] I'm trying to impress God
[1:08:45] just believe in his word
[1:08:48] and continue on this precious Journey
[1:08:51] God bless you brother attention thanks
[1:08:54] for your attention we thank you
[1:08:57] [Applause]
[1:09:09] Hermanos
[1:09:11] good to be here with you
[1:09:13] I appreciate my brother
[1:09:16] appreciate my brother of course our
[1:09:19] pastor Pastor the opportunity to be here
[1:09:22] with you
[1:09:23] just to share a little bit
[1:09:28] you know
[1:09:30] when going into the Plan of Redemption
[1:09:33] as we've been doing for the past couple
[1:09:35] of months
[1:09:37] there's an endless amount of things that
[1:09:40] we can speak
[1:09:42] especially uh when we talk about how
[1:09:45] it's impacted us
[1:09:49] how this helped us
[1:09:51] we just want to share it back with you
[1:09:54] so there's there's like I said there's
[1:09:57] an endless amount of things that we
[1:09:58] could share
[1:10:01] I've had the the privilege this month is
[1:10:06] we have about a between three to six
[1:10:10] students sometimes on Sundays and then
[1:10:12] the class uh 12 to 13.
[1:10:16] it ranges from week to week it is
[1:10:29] we've been talking a little bit about
[1:10:31] the Book of Matthew yes
[1:10:33] specifically in the first couple
[1:10:35] chapters
[1:10:36] so we just we want to go around the
[1:10:39] subject of baptism
[1:10:45] I was uh before having knowing that we
[1:10:49] were going to be here
[1:10:50] I had agreed with the students
[1:10:54] today was going to be a day where I I
[1:10:56] had some some money
[1:10:59] if they answered questions they were
[1:11:01] going to get money
[1:11:04] and that comes that inspiration comes
[1:11:07] from from our brother
[1:11:16] and I said that we need a little bit of
[1:11:19] extra motivation
[1:11:20] motivation just to be able to pay
[1:11:23] attention
[1:11:24] so I'm just following
[1:11:28] the Footsteps in front of me
[1:11:32] trying to do the best that we can
[1:11:35] it's really a privilege to be there with
[1:11:38] them
[1:11:39] we have some interesting students
[1:11:42] our brother
[1:11:45] our brother
[1:11:50] or another brother
[1:11:52] of course our sister Jasmine they're all
[1:11:56] very different
[1:11:57] they all there are some old times I'll
[1:12:00] be paying attention
[1:12:02] and sometimes they're just talking yeah
[1:12:05] advantage of such a small classes
[1:12:09] can sit there with them
[1:12:10] and so what we've been talking about I'm
[1:12:14] going to turn to it now
[1:12:16] Matthew 16 24.
[1:12:19] and I'll I'll read it uh quickly
[1:12:22] and so Matthew 16 24.
[1:12:25] then Jesus said unto his disciples If
[1:12:29] any man will come after me let him deny
[1:12:31] himself
[1:12:32] take up his cross and follow me
[1:12:44] or whosoever will save his life shall
[1:12:47] lose it and for whosoever will lose his
[1:12:49] life for my sake shall find it okay
[1:13:02] or what is a man profited if he shall
[1:13:05] gain the whole world and lose his own
[1:13:07] soul or what shall a man give in
[1:13:10] exchange for his soul
[1:13:20] that's all we're going to read we began
[1:13:24] reading Matthews one two three and four
[1:13:26] come on
[1:13:29] and you know with the first was just the
[1:13:32] the generations
[1:13:34] and we go on to this beginning and then
[1:13:39] we go on to where the Lord was baptized
[1:13:43] and so we focus on this scripture
[1:13:47] specifically in verse 24.
[1:13:51] Jesus says unto his disciples
[1:13:54] you know he's talking to his disciples
[1:13:57] he's giving him the idea of what it is
[1:14:00] that we have to do
[1:14:03] if any man will come after me
[1:14:07] let him deny himself
[1:14:22] it's not an easy thing to deny yourself
[1:14:26] you know to uh
[1:14:28] to your desires you know your privileges
[1:14:32] and what it is that you want to do
[1:14:35] deny yourself
[1:14:38] it's it's not easy no it's fussy and
[1:14:41] then the next thing
[1:14:43] pick up your cross
[1:14:45] you know when we look at that
[1:14:47] what's he saying with that
[1:14:50] and he's saying our responsibility
[1:14:54] whatever God has given us
[1:14:56] will there be at our job here at church
[1:15:03] your cross take up your cross
[1:15:06] your responsibility responsibility and
[1:15:09] then the last one
[1:15:11] the most difficult most difficulties
[1:15:14] follow me and it's not easy to do these
[1:15:17] things
[1:15:18] but it's it's what a plan that he has
[1:15:21] for us
[1:15:22] and he's telling his disciples his
[1:15:26] followers and he's selling it to us
[1:15:29] deny yourself
[1:15:31] pick up your own crosses not the cross
[1:15:35] is my brother at the cross of my father
[1:15:38] I don't know my sister whoever
[1:15:43] your responsibility not only you know
[1:15:46] what that is
[1:15:47] and then to follow him and then he
[1:15:51] continues
[1:15:52] whoever will save his life foreign
[1:16:28] that's what he's telling us to do
[1:16:30] it's I understand it's a lot easier said
[1:16:35] we have examples
[1:16:37] and we can lean on to move forward
[1:16:42] you know this scripture gives us a
[1:16:44] promise
[1:16:47] we're able to dedicate Our Lives
[1:16:50] educate Our Lives over to the Lord
[1:16:53] that there's a reward waiting for it
[1:16:56] whoever will lose his life for my sake
[1:17:00] shall find it he's promising he's giving
[1:17:03] us a promise if we're able to deny
[1:17:07] ourselves
[1:17:08] pick up our cross
[1:17:12] he's giving us a simple reward for that
[1:17:16] and you know this morning
[1:17:18] wherever you're at
[1:17:21] wherever I'm at struggling with my own
[1:17:24] things

[1:18:06] you know and looking as at small
[1:18:09] victories
[1:18:10] you know sometimes just just arriving
[1:18:13] here
[1:18:14] so it's just coming to church it's not
[1:18:17] you might think it's just coming to
[1:18:19] church
[1:18:21] I've been coming my whole life
[1:18:24] so for some people it's a victory
[1:18:38] you just maybe don't even think about it
[1:18:40] for some people that's a victory
[1:18:44] or to sing along
[1:18:47] applaud your hands sometimes it's a
[1:18:50] victory
