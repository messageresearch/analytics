[12:32] [Music]
[12:44] so
[12:48] [Music]
[12:59] [Music]
[13:35] god bless you all
[13:37] it's a pleasure to be here in the house
[13:38] of the lord
[13:41] i know that
[13:42] especially on sundays like this yes
[13:44] especially
[13:45] it's a little bit more difficult than
[13:47] usual to get up sometimes
[13:52] but it's always that little effort that
[13:53] goes a long way
[13:56] so uh before we get into anything i'd
[13:58] like to pray and skip
[14:25] that you can use us to
[14:27] to
[14:28] give the word to your people lord
[14:33] we thank you for that privilege lord
[14:36] and if any any anybody needs something
[14:38] from you
[14:40] or from this service or the este
[14:42] may
[14:53] amen amen
[14:55] all right so um just to start us off um
[14:59] i'd like to go into the
[15:01] the scripture that we've been going into
[15:03] for the past couple of
[15:05] sundays
[15:10] hebrews
[15:13] and i'll give you guys a little bit of
[15:14] time to get there
[15:23] all right so um hebrews 9 11.
[15:27] [Music]
[15:28] but christ being come and high priest of
[15:30] good things to come by a greater and
[15:32] more perfect tabernacle not made with
[15:35] hands that is to say not of this
[15:37] building
[15:38] but estonia
[15:47] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[15:50] but by his own blood he entered into
[15:52] once into the holy place
[15:54] having obtained eternal redemption for
[15:56] us
[16:06] for if the blood of bulls and goats and
[16:08] the ashes of in heifer sprinkling the
[16:10] unclean sanctify to the purifying of the
[16:13] flesh
[16:20] scientifically how much more shall the
[16:23] blood of christ who through the eternal
[16:24] spirit offered himself without spot to
[16:27] god purge your conscience conscience
[16:30] from dead works to serve the living god
[16:32] cuanto mas la sangre de cristo el cual
[16:34] mediantel espiritu
[16:46] all right um so like we've been going
[16:48] over the plan of redemption
[16:51] so we want to go into that
[16:54] what is the plan of redemption or to be
[16:56] redeemed
[17:00] so we all know the base what it means to
[17:02] be redeemed
[17:06] we talk about it every sunday
[17:09] that god died on the cross for us so
[17:11] that we may be redeemed
[17:16] and so i want to talk about that
[17:19] he the way that he died was one of the
[17:22] worst ways a person can die
[17:26] that was the man that was supposed to
[17:28] save the entire earth
[17:37] so the real main definition of
[17:39] redemption
[17:42] using it in the real world
[17:48] so that's what jesus christ did when he
[17:50] died on the cross for us
[17:54] so you have to think about that for a
[17:56] second
[17:58] that he died to clear a death for every
[18:00] single person that walked on earth
[18:06] and that and that ever will walk on
[18:08] earth
[18:10] that's a lot of sin to get rid of it's
[18:12] also it
[18:13] [Music]
[18:16] that's how perfect jesus christ was it
[18:18] is
[18:20] christopher and i know for a fact as we
[18:22] all do
[18:23] that jesus
[18:24] that jesus christ did not die for
[18:25] nothing jesus no
[18:28] he died for our sins to make us redeemed
[18:30] by his blood
[18:34] so that we would be spotless in the eyes
[18:36] of god
[18:39] now our so i'd like to go into a quote
[18:41] our brother branham says
[18:44] god's plan of redemption through the
[18:46] offering of the blood
[18:52] of the lord jesus
[18:54] christ once and for all
[18:57] to cleanse the guilty unworthy sinner
[19:00] alpecador in indigno and to bring him
[19:04] into reconciliation with god
[19:08] and to restore him back to the garden of
[19:10] eden
[19:12] with his wife and loved ones
[19:16] never to die no more but
[19:18] never to be sick
[19:21] never to have heartache
[19:36] for a lot of the brothers here um that
[19:39] work because i know a lot of the
[19:40] brothers here do work physical jobs
[19:46] there's not many of us that sit behind a
[19:47] desk
[19:51] and i know there's nothing wrong with
[19:52] that you know
[19:54] but i know that it's just i know that
[19:56] it's just hard to be outside especially
[19:57] when it's in the sun and things like
[19:59] that
[20:03] um i know that especially when days like
[20:06] that happen it's it's uh it's always
[20:09] relaxing to be able to go home and relax
[20:15] because um like we all know the human
[20:17] body is flawed
[20:31] so i think that just being able to go
[20:33] out and enjoy life
[20:36] to live the way that we were meant to
[20:38] live
[20:40] is one of the greatest rewards that we
[20:41] could ever have
[20:44] so um
[20:46] so
[20:47] it's much harder to
[20:49] to to close to that's like that's how
[20:52] you claim it
[20:54] you can't just pretend to be someone
[20:57] you're not
[21:00] you can't be a bad person
[21:03] but in reality that's who we all are
[21:07] because we're sinners
[21:09] um because to to go to heaven
[21:14] and an
[21:15] in in por simplical de maciado we just
[21:18] have to be good god-fearing people
[21:23] but being a good person isn't just
[21:24] something that happens on its own
[21:29] and there's not a lot of that in this
[21:30] world anymore
[21:33] especially um with the way that sin is
[21:36] right now
[21:38] sin isn't something that's uh that's
[21:41] thrown out something that's seen as
[21:42] wrong
[22:02] you're just you're a little different
[22:03] because you won't do things that other
[22:04] people will do
[22:09] you're kind of set apart from them no
[22:12] and it and it's hard because it's not
[22:14] suffering on the outside
[22:17] it's suffering mentally knowing that
[22:19] you're not like the people around you
[22:23] that you don't fit in
[22:38] be i'mma be punished for this later
[22:40] god's gonna get me for this
[22:45] because when you when you're sinning
[22:46] what are you what are you doing
[22:50] usually out in public with your friends
[23:06] uh sinning isn't that horrible thing
[23:08] that we make it out to be
[23:12] sin is a beautiful thing
[23:14] it's fun and it's enjoyable yes um
[23:18] we sin because it makes us feel good
[23:22] but what's that temporary fake happiness
[23:25] to being with god eternal in glory
[23:33] so uh
[23:34] it's especially hard for some of us
[23:36] especially
[23:38] especially those that are in school
[23:41] because you're just a little bit
[23:42] different than anyone
[23:45] and uh and don't get it wrong it's not
[23:47] like
[23:48] we're not it's not like some disney
[23:50] movie
[23:52] disney right they don't grab you and
[23:53] like throw you against throw you against
[23:55] the locker like so what a loser
[24:00] nobody does that nadia says
[24:03] and uh but you're just you're just weird
[24:05] for not doing certain things
[24:08] but uh you need to realize that out
[24:10] there there's always someone to hang out
[24:11] with but
[24:14] and it's not some uh like a consolation
[24:17] prize
[24:20] you can hang out with people that are
[24:21] genuinely fun and so it's nice to be
[24:24] around them
[24:29] so uh before i go into this i just want
[24:31] to tell everyone
[24:34] it's what i did isn't fun and i don't
[24:36] want to be a bad influence to anybody
[24:42] so i want to tell you guys a little
[24:43] story
[24:45] so this was during quarantine so
[24:46] obviously it was a little hard being
[24:48] locked up in the house all the time
[24:54] and uh so me and my friends have a group
[24:56] chat together like a lot of people do
[24:57] you have
[25:09] and my mom knows i used to go out almost
[25:11] every single day to go out skating with
[25:12] them
[25:21] and uh so uh one day one of my friends
[25:25] was miss amigos uh he had a little laser
[25:28] antenna
[25:29] and it was a really really like strong
[25:31] laser you know
[25:33] uh
[25:34] like it was it was like in the movies
[25:35] where it was those lasers from the gun
[25:37] that you could see perfectly
[25:41] so a bunch of sophomores having that
[25:43] right there is a first red flag
[25:48] so we were just hanging around the field
[25:50] with that thing
[25:53] and my friend he's pretty dumb
[25:56] so he's like i'm shining at that car
[25:58] right there he's this is the opponent
[26:01] and i wasn't i wasn't going to be like
[26:02] the the the big i wasn't going to be the
[26:04] big uh like the whoop you know
[26:14] so we kept doing it to a bunch of cars
[26:16] just
[26:18] and when you think about it
[26:20] it's only funny because you're with
[26:21] people no matter
[26:32] so um
[26:33] so that's not the whole story so
[26:42] so there's a roundabout like right here
[26:45] and then there was a field in between it
[26:46] yeah
[26:48] and then it's halted like it's breaks
[27:03] our school that i used to go to as a
[27:06] middle school kid was right next to
[27:08] there
[27:12] so i was like i used to go there's no
[27:13] problem with me and my friends hopping
[27:14] we all used to go there
[27:18] so then we just started waiting there
[27:20] and the guy left obviously because he
[27:21] couldn't really get to us
[27:26] so we were just chilling at the field
[27:27] doing some more dumb stuff just just
[27:30] making dumb jokes
[27:33] and uh we would get scared and laugh
[27:35] because cars would come into the
[27:36] roundabout
[27:39] kind of looks like a tahoe
[27:41] tahoe the the cars that police drive
[27:44] was
[27:45] like that's not a cop though we were
[27:46] just shining a laser at a car
[27:50] and uh so uh
[27:52] so then we we were just sitting there
[27:54] just looking at the car
[27:57] and then so since it was night time
[28:17] and and so at that point me and my
[28:19] friends saw that in this field and we
[28:20] were just there like deer in headlights
[28:25] so so we had to run away as fast as we
[28:28] could
[28:31] so um
[28:32] so uh being generous here i must say i'm
[28:34] like 5 10.
[28:40] and i'm not the lightest person in the
[28:42] world
[28:46] so i can tell you that
[28:48] the way i jot i jumped a six foot fence
[28:54] ps in less than like two seconds
[29:07] and uh so then someone yelled out i was
[29:09] so mad
[29:18] so so we all split up and everything
[29:21] was different and then we all met up at
[29:23] my house
[29:29] so um obviously right that's not what i
[29:31] mean when i say have fun with people you
[29:33] know
[29:37] like at the very most like ding dong
[29:39] ditch a house but don't don't get the
[29:41] police on you guys
[29:47] because uh my parents were so mad when
[29:50] they found out
[29:52] pasta
[29:55] but then at the same time
[29:58] i've gone out with my friends to the
[29:59] mall or the movies
[30:03] and it's it's just as fun as being with
[30:05] anyone else yes
[30:20] you hang out with good people what do
[30:22] you think you're going to get out of it
[30:26] good habits
[30:28] so when you do that you can you you can
[30:30] learn to become a better person by
[30:32] hanging out with better people
[30:46] you can always add that extra sentence
[30:48] to your prayer
[30:50] [Music]
[30:52] you can make god your friend
[30:55] right you could thank him for that
[30:57] yellow light that you barely made
[31:02] maria
[31:03] and my mom's going to get mad but i make
[31:05] that prayer often
[31:10] so
[31:12] talk to him and make him your go-to
[31:16] and most of all he must what i'm trying
[31:19] to make out of all this
[31:21] is make the most out of the redemption
[31:24] god gave you escape
[31:27] right god didn't die for us
[31:30] so that we could walk around like robots
[31:34] spewing out bible scriptures
[31:36] and trying to convert everything that we
[31:38] touch
[31:40] right we honor his death by worshiping
[31:42] him
[31:44] by
[31:52] we worship him not just at church but by
[31:55] living good lives
[32:02] right and it's so easy you know yes we
[32:04] fussy like it's not it's not that hard
[32:06] to to to be a to live that good life
[32:11] and i know a lot of kids my age
[32:15] like we grew up listening to those songs
[32:20] and that's all you have to do
[32:22] and um
[32:24] so i think that telling the truth is a
[32:26] big thing
[32:28] but that is
[32:29] right because especially with the phone
[32:30] and everything especially
[32:33] it's so easy to lie it's so easy to
[32:34] spread alive
[32:39] and i want to talk about a story um that
[32:41] uh that happened to my dad one time
[32:45] so one time he went to the bank
[32:49] and he went to cash in a check
[32:53] and i think i don't know if it was a
[32:54] small job because it was like a check of
[32:55] a couple hundred dollars
[33:00] and so uh so i don't even know how this
[33:02] happens but the bank gave him extra
[33:04] money
[33:07] right i wish that would happen to me
[33:11] right but my so so my dad was obviously
[33:13] when you get a nice amount of money you
[33:15] like to count and it makes you feel kind
[33:16] of nice
[33:20] so my dad was counting and saw they had
[33:22] a couple extra a couple extra hundreds
[33:28] and he returned it
[33:30] right my dad's a really honest guy
[33:35] and when you don't think about the
[33:37] external
[33:39] external you think about the internal
[33:42] internal doing this did benefit my dad
[33:44] yeah
[33:46] because he left that tiny situation
[33:50] with
[33:52] and i think that the integrity of a
[33:54] person is one of the most important
[33:56] things that you can have in your life
[34:01] right so you honor god who said
[34:18] and don't defile your temple you know um
[34:26] um that god gave you because it's the
[34:28] only one we get it died on the cross for
[34:30] us
[34:32] no
[34:46] god loves us and he shows it to us every
[34:48] day
[34:51] you don't notice it because you don't
[34:52] think about it
[34:55] right ask yourself what's stopping you
[34:56] from being that car accident in the news
[35:05] what's stopping your house from being
[35:07] that smoke you see in the distance okay
[35:12] right always thank god and be humble
[35:17] because god coming down was the most
[35:18] humble thing he could ever do
[35:24] because he didn't just humble himself
[35:27] he stooped down to our level
[35:42] and so our prophet said this
[35:45] uh there's the picture of true
[35:47] redemption
[35:51] how he came down worthy
[35:55] robbed himself
[36:08] and took upon him not the nature of
[36:10] angels
[36:13] not the nature of god
[36:15] but the nature of man
[36:18] he became a man for us
[36:22] and we'll always remember what he did
[36:23] for us
[36:39] to i'm asking myself this too but
[36:42] ask yourself
[36:44] do i act in a way that shows i truly
[36:46] appreciate being redeemed
[36:52] that's all god bless you and uh thank
[36:54] you for letting me speak to you
[36:57] [Applause]
[37:02] god bless you all
[37:04] i greet you all in the name of the lord
[37:05] jesus christ
[37:09] um
[37:10] i'd like to uh
[37:12] speak on uh on the same same topic today
[37:15] uh a great plan of redemption
[37:19] um
[37:20] i'm very first and foremost i'd like to
[37:22] thank my pastor for this opportunity he
[37:24] gave me premier leagues
[37:27] um
[37:28] i'm usually again as i've said i'm
[37:30] usually hiding behind the drum set but
[37:32] uh
[37:43] so i think it's it's good that i get
[37:44] more face time you know that way i uh
[37:46] shake the
[37:48] levers a little more question
[37:55] but uh nonetheless i'm very grateful to
[37:57] be here this morning very fortunate very
[37:58] lucky very blessed
[38:02] um you don't have to turn your
[38:04] scriptures with me but i just like to
[38:06] read a little scripture here i have
[38:11] one
[38:12] it will be found in job it's in hope
[38:14] chapter 19
[38:16] it's a
[38:26] for i know that my redeemer liveth
[38:29] and that he shall stand at the latter
[38:31] day upon the earth
[38:38] and though after my skin warms destroy
[38:41] this body
[38:42] yet in my flesh shall i see god is
[38:50] so
[38:51] first and foremost i just wanted to
[38:53] speak a little bit on on redemption
[38:55] itself and and and what it means
[39:00] but i mean i'm sure everybody here knows
[39:02] what it means by now
[39:07] from a simple google search uh
[39:09] i came up with two different definitions
[39:11] for redemption
[39:16] so the first one i found it gave me a
[39:19] pretty straightforward one i think to
[39:20] what we're talking about
[39:26] so i have here
[39:27] the action of saving
[39:30] or being saved from sin
[39:32] error or evil
[39:39] and the second one being
[39:41] the action of regaining
[39:43] or gaining possession of something
[39:46] in exchange for payment or clearing of a
[39:49] debt
[39:50] recuperator
[39:54] or soda
[40:05] he was up there because we we at that
[40:09] point had lost their salvation we were
[40:11] doomed
[40:16] we were
[40:18] destined to go to a place where
[40:21] we would we would suffer
[40:36] and in doing so he he
[40:38] he made sure that that we we
[40:41] we had a future
[40:44] and while he was up there he saw all of
[40:46] us here
[40:50] he saw you sitting in that same spot you
[40:52] are now yo yo
[40:55] you saw me speaking here today
[40:59] and he thought that was worth dying for
[41:01] yeah so el el crio queso vallo murir
[41:08] so redemption itself
[41:11] is brother branham says it's one of the
[41:13] oldest things in the bible
[41:17] being that it's in the oldest book in
[41:18] the bible
[41:22] um
[41:24] he says uh it even predates the the plan
[41:27] of redemption
[41:30] because the his this whole entire thing
[41:33] is just one big
[41:36] big play that we're all we all have our
[41:38] own little roles
[41:43] we're all filling uh it could be
[41:46] the simplest of things it could be
[41:50] the person that holds the door at the
[41:51] end of the service
[41:55] could be the person that's at the door
[41:56] at the beginning of the service
[42:00] but we all have a small
[42:02] or large role to play
[42:06] so sometimes i i think
[42:10] i think to myself uh
[42:12] you know why why why do we why do we
[42:18] why do we why do we put ourselves in the
[42:21] situations where sometimes we shouldn't
[42:23] be at all
[42:28] but i found that it was just it was it
[42:31] was the human and it's we we are after
[42:33] all a flawed species
[42:40] yet perfect in the eyes of god
[42:44] you know christ
[42:46] brother branham says christ was
[42:48] predestined predestinated he says
[42:55] and he was the lamb of god
[43:07] way before
[43:08] the world was made way before the world
[43:10] was made god already had this plan of
[43:12] redemption
[43:17] we all we i'm sure we all believe that
[43:19] god puts
[43:20] puts things together for for those that
[43:22] that truly love him
[43:37] although sometimes we may fall and
[43:39] stumble yeah he says
[43:42] and it's
[43:43] most you know nine times nine out of ten
[43:45] times it's it's our own fault
[43:50] we
[43:53] we just have to position our place in
[43:54] christ
[43:58] find our position in christ and and all
[44:00] of that will fade away like a shadow
[44:02] position
[44:04] foreign
[44:11] so so why why did why do we why do you
[44:14] think god puts puts us in the trials he
[44:16] puts it sometimes
[44:20] because i know that sometimes i every
[44:22] day i'm struggling with something it's
[44:24] it's constant nonsense
[44:28] i it gets the point where i think
[44:30] there's there might be something wrong
[44:32] with me i don't know it's
[44:35] it's i'm very
[44:37] i'm a very clumsy person so you're not
[44:39] persona
[44:41] so i
[44:42] i don't know i find the most simplest
[44:44] and dumbest ways to hurt myself
[44:53] so i
[44:54] i could be from from where i park my car
[44:56] outside of my job site
[45:01] from the little walk trip to there to
[45:02] the front door i probably tripped maybe
[45:05] twice
[45:10] and i
[45:11] so
[45:13] so i just i wonder why why why do
[45:15] sometimes and a christian walk why do we
[45:18] fall so constantly
[45:23] why does god let some things
[45:27] happen to us on purpose
[45:29] permitted
[45:32] well
[45:34] brother branham tells of a story
[45:38] i'm sure we've all heard it before
[45:41] of the good shepherd
[45:44] he says a missionary from palestine
[45:48] palestine
[45:49] told him that he once saw a shepherd
[45:52] walking down the road with a lamb in his
[45:54] arms
[46:04] he said the lamb had a splint on its on
[46:06] one of its legs
[46:11] and so the missionary asks the man
[46:15] why
[46:16] why is why does he have a splint on his
[46:19] leg
[46:22] and the the good shepherd simply
[46:24] explained
[46:26] that out of his whole herd this certain
[46:29] lamp was the one that would simply not
[46:31] seem to follow him
[46:37] he would you know go off and do his own
[46:39] thing and act like he was his own
[46:41] shepherd
[46:45] and so the the good shepherd being a
[46:48] good shepherd
[46:51] he grabbed the lamb
[46:54] and broke its leg
[46:56] and and so
[46:58] i mean to someone on the outside that
[47:00] doesn't really understand the story it
[47:01] could seem like he just broke the leg to
[47:03] be mean and then
[47:05] you know
[47:25] when he once he he gives it a little bit
[47:27] of special treatment
[47:30] and and and loves it a little more
[47:34] when that when that sheep when that lamb
[47:37] is all healed up
[47:40] it's going to it's going to follow the
[47:42] shepherd without a second thought
[47:49] and so i think that our pain sometimes
[47:54] makes us a lot stronger
[47:57] it builds up
[47:58] an armor around us
[48:02] an armor of faith
[48:04] armadura
[48:06] something that every time we fall and
[48:08] and hurt ourselves it's easier for us to
[48:10] get back up
[48:16] to trust him even more
[48:18] so that the next time we fall
[48:22] it's just like a dust off and we keep
[48:24] walking
[48:26] no matter what
[48:28] because that's what that's what this
[48:30] whole life is
[48:32] it's a big long road
[48:35] and at the end we can just make out the
[48:37] destination
[48:42] but every time we fall the road gets a
[48:44] little bit longer
[48:47] but we just have to get back up and keep
[48:49] going
[48:53] um
[48:55] brother branham says
[48:59] he says that the devil is kind of like a
[49:01] pawn broker
[49:05] he uh
[49:06] evil evil that man puts us puts us in
[49:08] there and and just
[49:11] won't let us out you know
[49:13] we didn't let us out until christ paid
[49:15] that great debt.
[49:19] so christ redeemed us
[49:22] and bought us out of that pawn shop
[49:27] the government had said that by sunrise
[49:30] all the slaves would be free
[49:35] so all of the slaves
[49:38] the the younger ones the ones
[49:42] they would either climb the highest tree
[49:44] they could find
[49:47] the top the highest hill
[49:51] just so that they could get a glimpse of
[49:53] that rising sun
[49:56] and as soon as they got a peek of it
[49:59] as soon as one of those sun rays hit
[50:02] their face
[50:05] they ran to their people and and just
[50:07] screamed i'm free i'm free korean
[50:09] consequential
[50:26] but for now we just got to keep keep uh
[50:28] keep fighting
[50:30] keep fighting the good fight
[50:33] because otherwise where else is there to
[50:35] go
[50:38] um many times which asbestos
[50:41] i feel like
[50:46] well i speak personally but many times i
[50:48] can feel like we just say
[50:51] like i i just i i don't
[50:54] like i don't do enough come on
[50:57] like i'm i like i can't do enough to
[51:00] please god okay
[51:05] but
[51:06] it just
[51:12] [Music]
[51:33] we'll make it there before we know it
[51:41] all right
[51:46] god is good brothers am i right this is
[51:49] a man correcto
[52:00] so just remember brothers
[52:19] [Applause]
[52:43] each and every one of us you know and
[52:48] i appreciate you all for being here
[52:51] i appreciate my brothers in the order
[52:56] brother joe
[53:12] here
[53:14] as we said it's uh
[53:16] it can be taken as a victory that you're
[53:18] here today
[53:22] and it might not seem so horrible
[53:25] but for for some
[53:33] [Music]
[53:40] we've been given the the subject of the
[53:41] plan of redemption
[53:44] and i appreciate my brothers for their
[53:46] efforts
[53:49] you know it's a a day of victory
[53:52] it's a day it's known as a day that we
[53:54] that the enemy has been defeated
[53:57] [Music]
[53:59] and that's what i want to focus on
[54:02] in god's plan of redemption
[54:06] it's for us to accept him
[54:21] is
[54:51] different brethren
[54:53] and it's preached in sierra vista
[54:55] arizona
[54:57] arizona not too far from here
[55:01] south of tucson
[55:03] in a small house
[55:17] he talks about two things
[55:20] he talks about a victory day
[55:24] that he entitles
[55:27] and then he talks about d-day
[55:30] and in describing these two indescribed
[55:34] he talks about the world wars
[55:37] specifically in world war ii
[55:43] it's known as the day they went into
[55:44] battle
[55:46] and
[56:00] anguish
[56:14] and he breaks down these two
[56:18] and it's impossible to cover everything
[56:21] it's impossible
[56:22] it's impossible to do it just as the way
[56:24] that brother branham brought it yes
[56:27] i highly recommend that you take the
[56:28] time
[56:30] and listen to it yes
[56:32] and the way that brother branham is just
[56:33] speaking to a few people
[56:35] [Music]
[56:37] and if you didn't know that
[56:39] it's as if you were speaking to
[56:40] thousands
[56:42] it took the same sincerity towards these
[56:44] people
[56:47] the same love to these people
[56:56] we have to have each one
[56:58] we have to have one
[57:01] and brother branham in this message
[57:04] he has a lot of examples that he uses
[57:07] and he takes a lot of examples from the
[57:08] old testament
[57:18] on the day where he was taking the
[57:20] people of israel out okay
[57:23] you know the people that had been
[57:25] enslaved
[57:26] had been enslaved
[57:29] they had been in slavery
[57:31] he was taking these people out
[57:34] towards the promised land
[57:36] moses had been sent as the deliverer
[58:20] you just saw 10 miracles
[58:24] and and then you're doubting yes
[58:27] you just saw all this happen
[58:30] it says just stay where you are you must
[58:32] say it's just trust in god
[58:36] and i want to read into something that
[58:38] brother branham says so you can hear how
[58:40] he says
[58:44] in the same message
[58:46] says what a courage that ought to be for
[58:48] the sick person
[58:52] what a courage that ought to be for the
[58:54] backslider okay
[58:57] turn yourself around and start back
[59:01] stay in the line of duty
[59:04] it's god's business to open up the red
[59:06] seas
[59:09] it's god's business
[59:11] you just speak and move forward
[59:14] that's all you have to do is
[59:30] is who obeyed the voice of their prophet
[59:35] and when they spoke and went forward
[59:38] and moses said
[59:40] haven't you seen 10 miracles already
[59:44] and
[59:59] smart ladder
[1:00:00] and they walked across on dry land
[1:00:07] described it as a v day for them
[1:00:11] what they had to go through
[1:01:04] and then because everyone was so worried
[1:01:06] about everything else maybe that's how
[1:01:07] it is today
[1:01:36] it comes to people like that
[1:01:39] but it's our part
[1:01:42] to do our role
[1:01:45] with all the things that come at me
[1:01:48] but if i just know
[1:02:29] but it's our part to just focus on our
[1:02:32] role foreign
[1:02:47] i had the opportunity
[1:02:48] to go to a few different job locations
[1:02:52] i had to go visit a few things
[1:02:56] and so i met i met with a member
[1:02:58] of the arizona department of
[1:03:00] transportation
[1:03:19] he was speaking with other people and i
[1:03:21] was just in the back
[1:03:24] he says oh i can't come tomorrow which
[1:03:25] is wednesday
[1:03:28] because
[1:03:41] he goes he so this man would go to bible
[1:03:43] studies
[1:03:46] and so that that caught my attention but
[1:03:48] we didn't say anything more on it
[1:03:52] and then later on
[1:03:56] the seat switched up
[1:03:59] and i was able to sit next to him
[1:04:02] and so uh we were just talking there
[1:04:05] talking about um our backgrounds
[1:04:08] where we're from
[1:04:10] where we live
[1:04:39] i'm like oh okay that's a that's nice
[1:04:43] and then he told me
[1:04:45] have you do you know about this
[1:04:49] have you accepted the lord as your
[1:04:50] savior
[1:04:52] come to salvador and i
[1:05:07] but he seemed a little surprised
[1:05:09] i had never met him
[1:05:12] maybe it's just something he doesn't run
[1:05:14] into but
[1:05:17] him asking me
[1:05:20] it caught my attention attention that
[1:05:23] just the simplest question
[1:05:27] just to try to see if he could help me
[1:05:31] or maybe lean me towards the right way
[1:05:48] just that small role that maybe god had
[1:05:49] put
[1:05:50] has put in his plate
[1:05:54] you know it's one that we can have
[1:05:56] in the tiniest roles
[1:05:59] to be a lighthouse
[1:06:01] as we are here today
[1:06:04] and to finish off
[1:06:06] let me have something that brother
[1:06:07] branham here has
[1:06:10] he says now remember
[1:06:13] god has counted you worthy when you have
[1:06:15] a test
[1:06:32] know that it is that you need to have a
[1:06:33] d day
[1:06:37] to have a day of victory
[1:06:40] and that's the message that brother
[1:06:42] tries to bring yes
[1:07:05] have i accepted the lord jesus christ is
[1:07:07] my savior
[1:07:10] salvador that simple question that was
[1:07:11] asked
[1:07:24] god
[1:07:26] [Applause]
[1:07:34] is
[1:07:50] i want you to stand up for a minute
[1:07:53] you know everybody's celebrating
[1:07:55] celebrando uh what we call tomorrow
[1:07:59] as labor day
[1:08:01] the labor day
[1:08:04] we're celebrating
[1:08:06] our victory
[1:08:09] the so-called labor day
[1:08:13] labor day
[1:08:17] take your seats
[1:08:19] we gotta honor then
[1:08:21] recognize the labor
[1:08:31] in america in america we know it as
[1:08:34] as labor day
[1:08:37] where we uh just stay home relax
[1:08:42] but we failed to understand
[1:08:46] somebody
[1:08:49] accomplished
[1:08:50] iso
[1:09:32] all his accomplishments
[1:09:46] you
[1:09:50] [Applause]
[1:09:57] [Applause]
[1:10:00] rest your mind
[1:10:09] i start listening to these three young
[1:10:12] men
[1:10:14] i'm extremely proud of them
[1:10:19] i didn't tell them what to preach
[1:10:22] but what i wrote down in my notes
[1:10:25] on each person
[1:10:29] it all boils down to one thing
[1:10:32] are we worthy of the gospel of jesus
[1:10:35] christ
[1:10:38] i need to present to you
[1:10:41] jesus christ
[1:10:48] [Applause]
[1:10:53] [Applause]
[1:11:09] if you talk about william branham that's
[1:11:12] fine
[1:11:13] but you're wrong
[1:11:16] you have no business
[1:11:18] trying to share this gospel
[1:11:25] where they don't even at least know the
[1:11:27] gospels
[1:11:29] with a big revelation
[1:11:32] killing people
[1:11:34] you're killing
[1:11:36] individuals
[1:12:07] we understand
[1:12:09] god sent malachi 4-5
[1:12:15] to help us
[1:12:18] not to destroy the very cross no destroy
[1:12:22] la cruz that we worship
[1:12:24] ramos why am i saying all this
[1:12:26] stuff saying that two of you listen you
[1:12:28] are trying to bring people to christ
[1:12:33] and they don't know nothing about him
[1:12:38] it's time
[1:12:40] that we go back
[1:12:42] it's time
[1:12:44] that we start listening
[1:12:46] to not only the message
[1:13:02] for victory
[1:13:31] a victory
[1:13:33] it's time yes
[1:13:35] we wake up
[1:13:38] i don't have time to play church
[1:13:41] this is real
[1:13:42] time is ending
[1:14:11] that i come up and i pray
[1:14:26] years and years ago
[1:14:28] and he only had me listed for five years
[1:14:35] that's god
[1:14:37] i can't argue with him
[1:14:40] he will vindicate
[1:14:42] what he called you foreign
[1:14:45] and many of you
[1:14:47] all suffering
[1:14:50] so that we could suffer
[1:14:55] can you say it man
[1:14:57] i shall suffer
[1:14:58] who wants the suffering
[1:15:00] forgot to put my hand up
[1:15:02] away he suffered
[1:15:04] a suffering
[1:15:06] because he said it to us
