[12:59] [Music]
[13:09] [Music]
[13:20] um
[13:28] [Music]
[14:02] i baptize you i baptize in the name of
[14:05] the lord jesus christ
[14:07] for the remission
[14:09] of your sins
[15:24] and i might try
[15:52] you are no longer responsible
[16:46] i believe that sin will be broke up when
[16:50] it's confessed
[16:52] under the basis of the blood of jesus
[16:54] christ
[16:56] it's just like dropping
[16:58] a drop of black ink in a bunch of clorox
[17:02] bleach
[17:03] it just breaks it into the chemicals and
[17:06] sends it plum back to where it come from
[17:09] and that's the way the blood of jesus
[17:11] christ does
[17:13] then that sets a man across the chasm
[17:15] again as a son
[17:41] this is where judgment comes from
[19:21] is
[19:34] verse 12.
[20:02] [Music]
[20:05] and i saw the dead small and great stand
[20:08] before god
[20:09] and the books were opened and another
[20:12] book was open which is the book of life
[20:15] and the dead were just out of those
[20:17] things which were written in the books
[20:20] according to their work
[20:23] i'm going to ask you a couple of
[20:24] questions
[20:29] being that each one of you
[20:31] has a book
[20:36] with us brother's going to put there in
[20:37] english
[20:42] of david
[20:59] the book of david
[21:13] the type of person that says all this is
[21:15] from my neighbor
[21:18] that applies to the deacon the minister
[21:22] and there's the other people
[21:23] type of person
[21:27] he says who told the preacher what i had
[21:28] done
[21:31] isn't that true
[21:34] and then there's the third group
[21:39] just to find me
[21:56] foreign
[22:04] a lot of people would like that the book
[22:06] would be written with pencils so we can
[22:07] erase it and make changes but it's
[22:09] written with ink
[22:24] and if he speaks
[22:38] was already
[22:46] all we have to do is apply that message
[22:48] to our hearts
[22:50] this yeti it says like this
[23:05] i believe that sin will be broke up when
[23:08] it's confessed upon the basis of the
[23:10] blood of jesus christ
[23:28] it's just like dropping a drop of black
[23:32] ink
[23:33] in a bunch of clorox
[23:46] because everything that we're doing is
[23:48] being written
[24:00] is
[24:15] foreign
[24:28] of the blood
[25:27] we say that that is a public confession
[25:32] and the people hear it
[25:35] but they forget that
[25:39] there has to be
[25:41] confession
[25:45] otherwise there is no yo
[25:47] i believe
[25:51] when sin is confessed
[26:02] upon the basis of the blood of jesus
[26:04] christ
[26:06] let us say for example
[26:20] one day i accepted jesus christ
[26:25] i was baptized in christian baptism
[26:29] and i am not ashamed
[26:32] to say god forgave me
[26:40] [Applause]
[26:49] i believe you can say the same thing
[27:19] the other day i saw the quarter from
[27:21] campo
[27:32] i asked him for a quarter
[27:50] [Music]
[28:00] i'm going
[28:11] forgive me lord
[28:30] and then go to god
[28:36] then if so then it is the sin is
[28:38] remitted
[28:41] totally
[29:11] and she went to the psychiatrist and to
[29:13] the doctors and nobody could cure her
[29:17] the reason was she had never confessed
[29:19] herself
[29:21] she was afraid that her husband would
[29:23] divorce her
[29:38] that's
[30:20] it is
[30:58] he's a liar
[31:27] [Music]
[31:29] computer
[32:03] 1710
[32:40] foreign
[32:50] put your name upon it
[33:31] i lived many years in sin until i found
[33:34] the lord
[33:35] please brother branham i have sinned
[33:37] again and i'm not worthy to come before
[33:39] you in this holy place
[33:41] please tell me if i can be restored holy
[33:44] again please help me brother branham i
[33:46] have a devil in me help me will you lay
[33:49] your hands upon me and restore
[35:17] you have not sinned here's the answer
[35:20] you have not sinned my friend so far in
[35:22] god but what you can be restored
[35:25] if you had sinned so far that you could
[35:27] not be restored you'd never want to be
[35:30] restored see
[35:32] but as long as there is something
[35:34] dealing with your heart you're still in
[35:37] line
[35:40] if there is something in your heart
[35:42] i still
[35:56] of the leak is guilty of the whole
[35:59] so you can understand
[36:01] that
[36:02] a little white lie
[36:04] little white one
[36:07] or adultery
[36:09] that's goodbye
[36:10] you're guilty of the whole thing
[36:14] you say just a little tiny little line
[36:18] you're just as guilty
[36:23] homicide
[36:39] is guilty of the hole
[36:45] i have seen many times
[36:52] every day every one of us do things that
[36:54] we don't want to do
[37:05] you don't want to be that way or you
[37:06] wouldn't ask this question
[37:14] that itself is the proof that god is
[37:16] still dealing with you possibly
[37:31] probably satan telling you that you
[37:32] can't be restored he's a lion certainly
[37:36] he is
[37:38] that's why the
[37:39] wound is
[37:43] he does not want you to confess
[37:47] he doesn't want you to go to the
[37:48] fountain of the blood
[37:51] we want you to stay there with that
[37:52] infection
[37:56] and here's a liar
[37:58] but you feel something in your heart
[38:30] continuing reading
[38:45] reading the question now will you lay
[38:46] hands upon me and free from that
[38:57] but
[38:58] not
[39:27] there are certain people that wait for
[39:28] the band will say the word so they can
[39:30] be free
[39:31] so they can be perfect
[39:34] you already have the perfect
[39:35] interpretation of the words
[39:54] if you have the opportunity
[40:50] but he stayed on the ground because he
[40:51] thought he was still okay
[40:55] forgive me that's where we are no no no
[40:57] no
[40:59] we don't call ourselves john's but we're
[41:01] a bunch of giants
[41:02] they were they're tied
[41:18] you
[42:00] accepted
[42:05] but that still wouldn't set you free
[42:07] until you accept
[42:09] what he done for you
[42:13] that's just me saying
[42:39] [Music]
[43:10] is
[43:24] says
[44:09] that's where you get freedom and
[44:11] justification when you're willing to say
[44:13] i'm sin i'm wrong that's what you said
[45:02] many
[45:16] he will be lifted
[45:58] just rise up on this lifeline of faith
