[50:00] this is a great event
[50:03] you know we just uh about two weeks ago
[50:07] I had the privilege of going to San Luis
[50:10] I was able to go with our associate
[50:13] pastor pastors
[50:16] and our brothers
[50:19] it's always the privilege to travel with
[50:21] them
[50:22] you know this time it was a little bit
[50:24] different
[50:26] no I'm used to maybe uh when I go when
[50:29] the Warriors
[50:31] not getting up as early
[50:33] because I don't have to I was at my
[50:36] parents house right
[50:38] everybody meets there

[50:50] brush my teeth get ready very fast
[50:54] and my brother was gonna drive
[51:51] and
[51:54] it was because of this
[52:02] because of how much I was looking
[52:04] forward to it
[52:06] and something that I had been asking for
[52:08] yeah and asking foreign it happened
[52:12] there in a simple spot
[52:14] it was just it's something because of
[52:17] the Great Expectations
[52:22] because I did my part I was looking
[52:26] forward to it you're talking about it
[52:29] and it was it was a privilege to listen
[52:33] to the message
[52:36] the day I died and that's what our
[52:39] brother Javier spoken you know and I'm
[52:41] not gonna get it too much into that
[52:43] I just want you to know that the peoples
[52:47] love you they want to shake your hands
[52:52] you know they're they're praying for you
[52:57] pray for the people in San Luis
[53:00] San Luis you know and uh it's uh like I
[53:04] said it was just something that I had a
[53:06] great expectation
[53:10] you know um and this morning I would
[53:12] like to if you would stand for a moment
[53:15] to return to our base scripture in
[53:17] Hebrews 9.
[53:21] you might be thinking you know you
[53:23] already spoke quite a bit
[53:26] and just get into this or he already
[53:28] talked a lot
[53:32] but that comes towards my time too even
[53:34] though we're just starting for the
[53:35] scripture
[53:38] Hebrews chapter 9 verse 11 is
[53:42] but Christ being come and a high priest
[53:45] of good things to come by a greater and
[53:47] more perfect Tabernacle not made with
[53:49] hands that is to say out of this
[53:51] building
[54:00] or neither by the blood of goats and
[54:03] calves but by his own blood he entered
[54:05] into in once in once into the holy Place
[54:09] having obtained Eternal Redemption for
[54:10] us is
[54:24] the 13th for if the blood of bulls and
[54:26] of goats and the ashes of a heifer
[54:28] sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to
[54:30] the purifying of the
[54:34] fleshos is
[54:43] how much more shall the blood of Christ
[54:45] who through the eternal spirit offered
[54:47] himself without spot to God Purge your
[54:50] conscience
[54:50] from dead Works to serve the Living God
[54:54] foreign
[56:02] you know where
[56:04] it's the Lord he presents to Moses
[56:10] speaking on what Aaron his brother
[56:13] should do
[56:16] the high priest
[56:18] so that's that's um what's reading being
[56:21] read here in Hebrews
[56:23] in chapter nine it's referring back
[56:27] Leviticus 16. and then you can read it
[56:32] on your own
[56:33] oh what's happening
[56:37] it was the whole process
[56:39] that's why when we read it it's in uh in
[56:43] 14 in verse 14. Hebrews chapter nine
[56:48] how much more
[56:52] the blood of Christ
[56:54] right so because it's saying if you know
[56:57] if the if the blood of bulls and goats
[56:59] how
[57:04] much more the blood of Christ
[57:06] so he's again he's referring to
[57:08] Leviticus
[57:12] for his for his sins
[57:16] he would take a bull
[57:19] um
[57:24] and he he would one was for his sins
[57:28] and his household
[57:31] and then the other was a sacrifice
[57:37] and then
[57:52] you know he would put on the garments
[57:55] and then he would he would uh take two
[57:58] goats
[57:59] and he would take the ram El carnero and
[58:03] then the process would start I'm not
[58:04] going to get into too much details
[58:06] right where he would he would kill
[58:08] London
[58:10] he would he would he would kill the
[58:13] excuse me the bull
[58:15] and then he would offer the sacrifice of
[58:18] the ram
[58:21] that was for him his atonement
[58:27] and for his household and then for this
[58:30] two two goats
[58:32] he would say and he would be for the
[58:36] sins of the people yeah
[58:41] so the one that would take the blame
[58:44] exactly the one that would take the
[58:46] blame
[58:47] and so that this was the process you
[58:51] know when he would kill first
[58:54] you know then he would take the the
[58:56] incense
[58:57] and then and the blood and he would
[59:01] sprinkle it
[59:02] upon the mercy seats
[59:04] and that's why we can read it here right
[59:08] everything that we've been reading in
[59:10] this in these uh in the description from
[59:12] from 11 to 14.
[59:25] it's referring back
[59:30] and I just mentioned this because it's
[59:33] what would come to mind
[59:35] when we would read this base scripture
[59:38] I know many of you might already know
[59:40] this
[59:41] but I just wanted to share that so after
[59:45] Aaron would do this process for himself
[59:48] he would do the same
[59:51] with a goats
[59:54] are the people right and then he would
[59:58] do the incense upon the mercy seats
[1:00:01] there was a certain direction he had to
[1:00:03] be
[1:00:05] Direction a certain amount of sprinkles
[1:00:08] Rocio
[1:00:11] and then after this was to happen yes
[1:00:14] you would take the second goats because
[1:00:15] remember it was two goats
[1:00:18] and he would put his hands upon it
[1:00:21] and he would confess the iniquities of
[1:00:24] the people
[1:00:25] and the transgressions
[1:00:29] he would send it to the Wilderness
[1:00:32] and that's what would happen
[1:00:34] and they would do all this upon the
[1:00:36] mercy seats
[1:00:39] and you know now we recognize
[1:00:43] we read it here in Hebrews
[1:00:46] how much more shall the blood of Christ
[1:00:50] because we understand that's the one
[1:00:53] sitting on The Mercy Seat now
[1:00:57] our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:59] he's the one that pleased for us
[1:01:03] that's all that's that they're referring
[1:01:06] to ISO
[1:01:08] when they go back and when we read this
[1:01:10] Hebrew this base scriptures
[1:01:13] and I recommend for you to read this
[1:01:15] book of Leviticus
[1:01:17] and if you want to get a little more
[1:01:19] detail of what I said
[1:01:23] you know
[1:01:25] and we and it's I recommend it to you
[1:01:28] it's it's uh it's something that we can
[1:01:31] take a lot from
[1:01:34] when we read these scriptures
[1:01:37] maybe it clicks a little bit more okay
[1:01:40] and I know um our time is almost up
[1:01:44] I just wanted to share that with you
[1:01:47] because it's something that I I wanted
[1:01:49] us all to be on the same page
[1:01:53] so that's why we say how much more shall
[1:01:57] the blood of Christ
[1:01:58] that's why we repeat it so much
[1:02:01] because if this was what was done
[1:02:05] now how much more blood of Christ bien
[1:03:08] he's like I'm very happy a lot of you
[1:03:11] are sincere okay
[1:03:12] didn't do it
[1:03:14] many years ago
[1:03:16] I asked the congregation
[1:03:19] how many of you did the homework and
[1:03:22] they all raised their hand amen
[1:03:25] and the homework he had was to read
[1:03:28] Hebrews 15. and there is no Hebrews 15.
[1:03:34] here on a man and then Bernie was just
[1:03:36] like you just tell me the truth
[1:03:39] he says a little bit more
[1:03:41] but he says that to start off but
[1:03:46] um like we spoke he continues on the
[1:03:49] three stages of Grace
[1:03:51] you know he makes an emphasis I say
[1:03:54] emphasis in how it is that we have to do
[1:03:56] our part
[1:03:58] right to be justified you know we know
[1:04:02] that Lord we just we just read it you
[1:04:05] know how much more shall the blood of
[1:04:06] Christ
[1:05:04] you
[1:05:06] make the decision
[1:06:05] shall the blood of Christ
[1:06:08] foreign
[1:06:10] [Applause]
[1:06:26] I really like everything my brother
[1:06:28] Paula was talking about
[1:06:30] really touched on a lot of things that
[1:06:32] I've been thinking about lately as well
[1:06:35] but first I'd like to thank each one of
[1:06:37] you for being here this morning
[1:06:40] I know it takes effort to be here Sunday
[1:06:43] morning
[1:06:45] especially this morning I went outside I
[1:06:50] felt like it was really cold
[1:06:51] so I thank you for overcoming that and
[1:06:54] coming here this morning
[1:06:56] no it's cold out there
[1:06:58] but fortunately we have a nice warm
[1:07:01] place where we can Gathering
[1:07:03] like brother Brandon once said he says
[1:07:07] it's a it's a terrible day out there
[1:07:09] but it's a good day in here and that's
[1:07:13] how I feel this this day is
[1:07:14] it's all about perspective
[1:07:19] and it's all about the right attitude
[1:07:22] correct you know in that same message
[1:07:24] brother Branham also says
[1:07:26] he gives an example he says it's outside
[1:07:29] there was a man outside and it was
[1:07:32] raining and he says such a terrible day
[1:07:36] but then comes another man and he says
[1:07:39] oh it's a wonderful day brother and the
[1:07:41] other the other man tells him why do you
[1:07:43] say it's a wonderful day
[1:07:45] he says what one year ago the doctor
[1:07:49] told me I had a week left to live
[1:07:53] so every day is a wonderful day
[1:07:56] so we're going to continue this morning
[1:07:59] what's the topic we've been going on for
[1:08:01] quite some time now
[1:08:04] which is the Plan of Redemption and so
[1:08:07] we always go through the definitions of
[1:08:09] what it is uh what Redemption is
[1:08:13] what a plan is so what I have here is
[1:08:17] some definitions of what a plan is
[1:08:20] the first one I have is it's a detailed
[1:08:23] proposal for doing or achieving
[1:08:25] something
[1:08:26] um
[1:08:31] but it's also an intention or decision
[1:08:34] about what one is going to do
[1:08:39] and based on what all of our brothers
[1:08:40] have been speaking on is
[1:08:45] no we have different uh definitions of
[1:08:48] what Redemption is
[1:08:51] no one of them is it's the action of
[1:08:53] saving or being saved from sin error or
[1:08:56] evil
[1:08:59] the other one we have is the action of
[1:09:01] regaining or gaining possession of
[1:09:03] something in exchange for payment or
[1:09:05] clearing a debt
[1:09:09] and the other one is the act of making
[1:09:11] something better or more acceptable
[1:09:16] so knowing what a plan is
[1:09:19] knowing what Redemption is
[1:09:21] I believe that it's a plan to save from
[1:09:24] sin yeah
[1:09:27] it's a plan to regain possession
[1:09:30] and it's the plan to make something
[1:09:32] better or more acceptable
[1:09:35] so then you have to ask the questions or
[1:09:39] I ask myself the questions
[1:09:46] regained possession of who
[1:09:51] you and I those dead make who better or
[1:09:54] more acceptable
[1:09:56] once again that's you and I know he
[1:09:59] wants me to reach a better place to be
[1:10:01] better people
[1:10:03] and be better Christians so when you
[1:10:07] think of this plan
[1:10:10] how did this plan come about
[1:10:13] when did he come up with this plan
[1:10:17] was it a couple hundred years ago
[1:10:21] was it a couple thousand years ago
[1:10:24] well brother Brandon gives us an answer
[1:10:26] to that question
[1:10:28] in the message
[1:10:30] Hope preached in 1955
[1:10:33] you know he says did you know Redemption
[1:10:36] was even before the Plan of Redemption
[1:10:38] was laid out before the world was ever
[1:10:40] formed
[1:10:47] he says think of that is God forcing and
[1:10:51] making a way of redemption before he
[1:10:54] even made the world
[1:11:01] so just reading that part in itself it
[1:11:05] makes me see how how rich and mercy God
[1:11:07] is
[1:11:08] it makes me thankful for that amazing
[1:11:11] grace
[1:11:13] before even the world was made
[1:11:16] God already had a plan laid out for us
[1:11:20] and brother Branham continues
[1:11:23] he says for the Bible plainly says that
[1:11:26] Christians was predestinated sorry that
[1:11:29] Christ was predestinated for ordained
[1:11:31] and was the Lamb of God
[1:11:33] foreign
[1:12:33] next of it it's a comprehensive plan
[1:12:37] what does that mean it means it's
[1:12:40] complete yes it means it includes all
[1:12:43] elements or aspects of something
[1:12:46] important but what else it's a
[1:12:50] far-reaching plan
[1:12:52] what does that means that it's important
[1:12:56] and it's widely applicable it has widely
[1:13:00] applicable effects or implications
[1:13:05] some synonyms it's profound it's
[1:13:07] profundo it's extensive it's all
[1:13:10] embracing and so here I believe God has
[1:13:13] a plan for all of us
[1:13:16] and here's where I tie this in with what
[1:13:18] my brother Paolo spoke on
[1:13:21] he has a plan for us
[1:13:24] God does his part we have to do our part
[1:13:28] so we have to ask ourselves or I ask
[1:13:31] myself
[1:13:32] is how do I do my part
[1:13:35] well one little uh key thing that
[1:13:38] brother banham told us
[1:13:40] is he tells us that the plant's already
[1:13:42] made
[1:13:43] he says redemption's already paid for
[1:13:46] is the only thing you have to do is
[1:13:50] accepted so that's something that sounds
[1:13:53] so simple
[1:13:55] but do we do it no it sounds so easy but
[1:13:59] do we do it
[1:14:00] but I say that for myself
[1:14:02] because I I've been thinking about
[1:14:04] lately
[1:14:06] because it seems like the the simplest
[1:14:08] things
[1:14:10] are sometimes the hardest to do
[1:14:14] no for example foreign
[1:14:56] you say well yeah that's easy
[1:14:59] oh yeah but remember you can't hold
[1:15:02] grudges
[1:15:03] you have to learn how to forgive then
[1:15:06] all of a sudden it's not so easy maybe
[1:15:09] you're thinking about it twice well
[1:15:10] maybe it's not that easy
[1:15:12] and I mean we have like the scripture
[1:15:14] says some of our brothers have mentioned
[1:15:17] that before
[1:15:18] in Revelations
[1:15:21] and I'm paraphrasing a little bit you
[1:15:24] know when he says to take the little
[1:15:25] book
[1:15:26] eat it up it shall make thy belly bitter
[1:15:30] but it shall be in that mouth sweet as
[1:15:32] honey
[1:15:35] so my understanding is it's easy to talk
[1:15:39] about
[1:15:40] easy to preach about it
[1:15:43] difficult to digest it
[1:15:46] or difficult to live
[1:15:49] you know and there's like but we have to
[1:15:51] do it you know there's that saying that
[1:15:54] they that's there's that saying you know
[1:15:56] talk to talk well now you gotta walk the
[1:15:58] walk you see look I says yes meaning you
[1:16:01] gotta whatever you preach
[1:16:03] you gotta practice and so I use myself
[1:16:07] as an example
[1:16:08] no I'm no longer I'm not a child
[1:16:11] I know right from wrong
[1:16:14] I know what I'm supposed to do but yeah
[1:16:17] I still fall but what matters is that
[1:16:21] you get back up
[1:16:22] you know it's okay to fall it's not okay
[1:16:27] it's staying in that Fallen State
[1:16:32] there's a saying I've heard before
[1:16:34] they say it's okay to be weak
[1:16:37] it's not okay to stay weak
[1:16:41] you can be weak we have to put in that
[1:16:44] effort to get stronger each day
[1:16:47] yeah we get stronger
[1:16:49] we stay in the word of God you do what
[1:16:53] we have to do
[1:16:54] we do our part
[1:16:57] you know like sometimes you know you
[1:16:59] find ourselves in iniquity
[1:17:01] you know and this this is something that
[1:17:03] clicked in my mind it's like okay
[1:17:06] it's a message I heard a while back
[1:17:09] I believe it was brother Javier he was
[1:17:12] talking about it
[1:17:13] it was titled the sin iniquities
[1:17:18] you know and then there he you know we
[1:17:20] hear the definition of what it is what
[1:17:22] is Iniquity is
[1:17:24] you know and it's the definition I've
[1:17:26] always heard
[1:17:28] which is it's doing the knowing
[1:17:30] something's wrong but still doing it but
[1:17:34] when it clicked for me
[1:17:36] is when he switched it around he says
[1:17:40] it's knowing what the right thing is
[1:17:44] that for me it made a big impact
[1:17:47] it changed the way I look at things
[1:17:50] once again something so simple
[1:17:53] yeah it made such a big impact when I
[1:17:55] thought about it
[1:17:57] it's this little small things no my
[1:18:01] brother here does something nice for me
[1:18:04] something nice and I know that the right
[1:18:07] thing to do is to say thank you gracias
[1:18:10] but I don't know did I do something bad
[1:18:12] that in itself is Iniquity
[1:18:15] when we think about Sin iniquity
[1:18:19] a lot of times we think of the big
[1:18:21] picture stuff which is this is
[1:18:23] but we forget about the small details
[1:18:27] but God is so merciful
[1:18:30] but even then he's with us
[1:18:33] no I want to do God's perfect will
[1:18:36] I know you want to do God's perfect
[1:18:39] but unfortunately
[1:18:44] so we find ourselves in God's permissive
[1:18:47] Wills
[1:19:47] maybe you had a bad attitude
[1:20:15] there's just a couple words I had for
[1:20:18] you this morning
[1:20:19] I hope they served at least for some
[1:20:21] sort of encouragement
[1:20:24] that's something that I find myself in
[1:20:26] need sometimes
[1:20:27] you know that's how I am
[1:20:30] sometimes I get discouraged you know I'm
[1:20:33] I'm myself toughest
[1:20:36] criticism you know I judge everything I
[1:20:39] do
[1:20:40] sometimes I feel like I need to
[1:20:42] encourage myself
[1:20:44] and we have to keep pushing forward each
[1:20:46] day
[1:20:48] no matter how difficult
[1:21:23] close your eyes
[1:21:26] dear heavenly father
[1:21:28] thank you for this this beautiful
[1:21:30] morning
[1:21:32] for giving us a place together

[1:21:49] Lord and not even just us
[1:21:52] but our families
[1:21:54] our loved ones and I'm thankful for that
[1:21:58] this morning
[1:21:59] I ask that you be with our brothers who
[1:22:01] are here Lord
