[40:12] we have to take control of the service
[40:16] each and every person here
[40:23] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[40:25] amen amen
[40:28] uh before anything I want to read the
[40:30] scripture
[40:32] the same scripture we've been reading
[40:35] Hebrews 9 11.
[40:40] 11 through 14.
[40:53] there is like this
[40:55] but Christ being calm and high priest of
[40:58] good things to come by a greater and
[41:00] more perfect Tabernacle
[41:02] not made with hands that is to say not
[41:05] of this building
[41:06] foreign
[41:34] fifth blood of bulls and goats and the
[41:38] ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean
[41:41] Sanctified to the purifying of the flesh
[41:45] is
[41:53] how much more shall the blood of Christ
[41:57] who though the eternal spirit offered
[41:59] himself without
[42:01] without spot to God versus the
[42:04] conscience from dead Works to serve the
[42:07] Living God is
[42:20] foreign
[42:25] we're going to be continuing with the
[42:27] topic of redemption
[42:31] so Redemption
[42:33] is an act of redeeming it's like a
[42:37] toning for a father mistake
[42:41] or the state of being redeemed
[42:44] you know because man was found guilty of
[42:47] sin
[42:49] we were born
[42:57] some people would ask the questions
[43:02] why did God do this
[43:05] so how many of you have ever heard the
[43:07] name John Newton
[43:09] John Newton for those who don't know he
[43:13] was the man
[43:16] that we know as amazing grace
[43:19] and so it's probably the most well-known
[43:22] Christian song There is
[43:25] a Christian Cristiano so how many of you
[43:29] know what he was before
[43:39] and so for those who don't know
[43:42] a slave ship was used for transporting
[43:45] slaves
[43:48] could you imagine
[43:50] being the captain of that kind of
[43:54] I was seeing a group of people go back
[43:56] and forth
[43:58] with no control over their own lives
[44:03] and
[44:05] and knowing they're owned by other
[44:07] people
[44:09] um
[44:14] how much the Lord Jesus Christ can
[44:17] change
[44:25] for example for example emotions and so
[44:29] what emotion would you have felt
[44:32] usted if you say a loved one enslaved
[44:39] is
[44:44] anger is a dangerous woman
[44:47] and the reason for that is
[44:50] because anger can prohibit us
[44:57] you know it could be it could be like a
[44:59] barrier
[45:03] so when we allow anger to stay in the
[45:06] presence
[45:08] we live in that type of state of mind
[45:13] we don't think clearly
[45:19] and we let our motion take take us by
[45:22] control
[45:24] we're not us anymore
[45:28] so but once we learn to take control
[45:32] it's one step closer
[45:35] because anger can not only be it's not
[45:38] only a bad thing
[45:41] it may
[45:43] you know depending on the situation
[45:46] and so
[45:49] excuse me
[45:51] and
[45:53] so what happens is
[46:01] so
[46:02] yeah it depends on the situation
[46:05] so anger is what sparked many great
[46:07] movements
[46:10] of change around the world
[46:13] you know for example we just talked
[46:15] about slavery
[46:17] President Lincoln is a great example
[46:21] he wanted to foreign
[46:58] so over 2400 U.S Personnel were killed
[47:05] and so seeing their own soldiers go down
[47:07] like that this is
[47:10] the U.S knew they had to do something
[47:13] yeah they could just stand by
[47:17] Otherwise who knows what could have
[47:18] happened next
[47:21] how many more lives would the country
[47:24] have lost and
[47:29] it becomes a problem
[47:31] if we
[47:34] looked
[47:35] you know because the devil wants us to
[47:38] get angry
[47:40] because if we get angry just like that
[47:43] we're doing say in a favor
[47:46] because there's a difference between
[47:48] reacting and responding okay
[47:52] reacting for example
[47:55] is when
[48:16] they're like punches
[48:25] doesn't mean
[48:27] so when we respond
[48:30] there's a difference
[48:32] we think
[48:34] and we take control of the situation
[48:37] and the reason for that is because we
[48:40] know
[48:44] so that could be
[48:49] for example
[48:52] foreign
[49:22] and so no matter what happens
[49:26] when put in a situation like that
[49:32] is
[49:39] read something from brothers
[49:42] and so
[49:44] it reads like this so there's no one in
[49:47] the world
[49:48] now get this real close
[49:51] there's no one in the world right now
[49:53] that could do one thing for you towards
[49:56] Divine Healing
[49:59] only to get you to believe in what Jesus
[50:02] has already done
[50:07] so people say
[50:09] I have healing power in my hands
[50:16] there's no such thing
[50:19] as that now you just you just get that
[50:24] away from me
[50:26] when anyone says
[50:29] you know they they may be honestly
[51:04] and Jesus Paid the full price
[51:11] only thing you do
[51:13] is accepted
[51:15] it says right there and Jesus Paid the
[51:18] full price at Calvary yeah
[51:21] perfect sacrifice
[51:23] man was found guilty of sin
[51:27] was because
[51:45] and now it will never do you no good
[51:48] until you accept it
[51:55] then you have to accept it
[51:57] it's not how hard you cry
[52:02] how much
[52:04] you persuade
[52:06] it's a surrendered heart
[52:09] surrendered
[52:12] with faith believing he done it
[52:16] so no matter how much you pray
[52:19] you'll never be
[52:21] forgivenado
[52:25] and so I guess you could call it a habit
[52:28] when we begin to doubt
[52:32] maybe sickness
[52:36] it puts you in fear you know
[52:42] um
[52:46] and so but it's those old habits that
[52:48] hold us back
[52:51] because man has
[52:55] but it doesn't work that way
[52:58] and because the prophet said
[53:01] by grace
[53:06] and so that's the only thing that could
[53:09] save you
[53:11] it's Grace it's La Gracia so it's
[53:14] important to have a faith and believing
[53:16] God
[53:18] because of his grace we are saved
[53:22] and so
[53:24] it's like the song Amazing Grace
[53:28] it's like it says it's God's Amazing
[53:31] Grace
[53:32] as a church
[53:35] as Christians we're all connected
[53:38] my God's Amazing Grace
[53:43] so
[53:45] but when put in a situation
[53:48] we seem to forget the most basic things
[53:52] you know like we said before
[53:55] there's reacting and responding
[53:59] and say we get sick and started
[54:04] I came across this quote
[54:07] I was researching one day
[54:11] and so I was
[54:13] I was talking about fear yesterday
[54:16] because fear is the is the one thing the
[54:20] devil can't put on to you
[54:23] I believe brother Branham said that it's
[54:26] the worst thing that we could put apart
[54:31] I found this quote
[54:34] and it says that even Kings get scared
[54:39] and I realized like what what does that
[54:42] means because
[54:45] when I read it
[54:47] I then realized this is
[54:50] the definition of a brave man
[54:56] um
[55:04] who conquers that fear
[55:06] because we all live with
[55:10] but we just should never try to let it
[55:13] win and
[55:16] uh my time is up yes
[55:18] uh I just want to say
[55:21] that it was good to talk in front of you
[55:24] oh yes
[55:27] being able to share this with you and
[55:32] just remember yeah
[55:35] we're Saved By God's Amazing Grace
[55:41] [Applause]
[55:49] yeah
[55:51] God bless you all this morning
[55:55] first off I want to thank God and my
[55:57] pastor for giving us this opportunity to
[56:00] speak in front of you be honest guys
[56:02] says
[56:06] and they wanted us to speak on the topic
[56:09] of redemption
[56:16] [Music]
[56:18] many different interpretations of
[56:20] redemptions
[56:24] for example according to the Oxford
[56:27] dictionary
[56:30] Oxford Redemption is the action of
[56:33] regaining or gaining possession of
[56:36] something in exchange for payment is
[56:43] clearing at that oh
[56:46] um
[56:48] uh but to us
[56:50] Redemption is the action of saving or
[56:54] being saved salvados
[57:12] who does the same
[57:20] oh who is the one that saved Kenneth
[57:22] Salva
[57:26] known as mismos
[57:29] is yours
[57:32] so if God is the one who is saving us
[57:37] then why don't we see Redemption
[57:39] happening in front of us
[57:44] that is all powerful
[57:47] it's so powerful that you can create
[57:49] universes with just his words
[57:54] if he's that powerful then
[57:59] surely you can save us right
[58:02] correct no no
[58:06] the reason why we don't see Redemption
[58:08] happening in front of us
[58:14] because God does not force change
[58:17] is
[58:20] [Music]
[58:26] like I'm not saying God can't do it he
[58:29] can surely do it
[58:31] he is after all powerful
[58:36] s us to choose
[58:44] otherwise we would be like machines
[58:48] and machines are only Pro programmed to
[58:52] do a certain tasks like
[58:59] like truly could be like machines
[59:00] program to the love and worship Him 24
[59:02] 7.
[59:09] which sounds great right okay
[59:12] but the problem with that
[59:15] it's not real okay
[59:18] a machine's love is
[59:25] a machine is merely an imitation
[59:29] it's an imitation of what a human can do
[59:32] is
[59:34] for example the the computer
[59:39] that's right correct there's one in our
[59:42] pockets right now you don't understand
[59:43] we'll see you
[59:46] um
[59:48] like we use it for a computer it has the
[59:50] power to uh
[59:53] to store gather and access information
[59:57] is
[1:00:05] just like a human I mean
[1:00:10] the only difference is that the brain
[1:00:12] that they
[1:00:14] the greater compute
[1:00:15] computers
[1:00:18] meaning that it can pull the information
[1:00:21] out of its uh from its uh memory quicker
[1:00:25] yes
[1:00:29] uh
[1:00:31] what makes
[1:00:32] an imitate imitation of the human brain
[1:00:35] is
[1:00:38] because uh because it's inferior to the
[1:00:42] human's brain's memory
[1:00:47] computer
[1:00:49] can only like the on average a computer
[1:00:52] can hold about eight gigabytes of memory
[1:00:59] well the human brain is
[1:01:04] can hold about
[1:01:06] 2.5 million gigabytes of memory Montana
[1:01:13] just in case of those who didn't care
[1:01:15] there's a there's a million in between
[1:01:22] now going back to God not forcing
[1:01:25] anything on us
[1:01:42] he oh where he does is just wait for our
[1:01:46] consent is
[1:01:50] allow us to change
[1:01:56] on the door and all we have to do is
[1:01:57] just answer yes
[1:02:04] the real question is
[1:02:09] why aren't we opening the door
[1:02:14] now one of the reasons why we don't open
[1:02:17] the door
[1:02:20] like my brother Nate said
[1:02:23] that we're too distracted
[1:02:27] and we're distracted by lies and
[1:02:34] uh our own mistakes
[1:02:37] we're distracted by the past
[1:02:41] and we
[1:02:43] allow that to determine we allow that to
[1:02:46] determine our future
[1:02:51] for example for example
[1:02:53] what if someone would say
[1:02:55] oh I can't do it look what happened last
[1:02:58] time
[1:03:02] or I made too many mistakes and I can't
[1:03:04] do it
[1:03:09] oh
[1:03:10] you said it does this is
[1:03:14] a person who says I can say yo puedo and
[1:03:19] the person who says I can't
[1:03:22] have one thing in common
[1:03:26] they're both right
[1:03:31] our past Mr pasado our history is meant
[1:03:36] to guide us is
[1:03:41] it should not determine what our future
[1:03:42] is going to be determination
[1:03:45] it may influence it will they influence
[1:03:47] for example if you make a mistake
[1:03:50] foreign
[1:04:16] the future isn't always going to be set
[1:04:18] in stone based on your past experiences
[1:04:25] God doesn't care what happened in the
[1:04:27] past
[1:04:29] he only cares what you do now
[1:04:35] and that is all I have written is
[1:04:42] God bless you
[1:04:44] [Applause]
[1:04:51] God bless you Brothers
[1:04:55] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:58] how many are happy to be here
[1:05:05] I'd like to give thanks to God in my
[1:05:08] pastor for giving me time to speak on do
[1:05:09] you have some words
[1:05:16] a topic that we've been speaking
[1:05:19] and I always think what am I going to
[1:05:21] say this time
[1:05:23] I think I've already said everything
[1:05:29] you always find something new amen amen
[1:05:32] don't says
[1:05:35] when we talk about the Plan of
[1:05:37] Redemption is
[1:05:43] something that doesn't go with the old
[1:05:45] nature
[1:05:47] it can't go together
[1:05:57] is that we have to change that nature
[1:06:02] we have to dedicate Our Lives
[1:06:05] and give God the control
[1:06:08] so he can remove that old human nature
[1:06:11] amen Brothers
[1:06:13] I was doing I was studying he
[1:06:18] and they say that a human
[1:06:21] changes for four reasons
[1:06:24] the first reason is
[1:06:28] when something hurts him enough to make
[1:06:31] him change
[1:06:37] the second reason is that they see
[1:06:39] something that inspires them to change
[1:06:46] and the third reason is they learn
[1:06:48] enough to want to change
[1:06:52] and the fourth reason is when they
[1:06:54] receive enough to be able to change
[1:06:59] I don't know if you've heard a story
[1:07:01] about me
[1:07:02] maybe my mom told the story
[1:07:05] foreign
[1:07:23] and I always ask my mom to make
[1:07:25] enchiladas
[1:07:31] so I was like what's what's going on
[1:07:33] with him he's always asking me for
[1:07:34] enchiladas and she would talk with my
[1:07:37] father
[1:07:38] and this is what I remember
[1:07:45] and then my dad told him
[1:07:49] Manila what's simple just make them
[1:07:51] about 40 enchiladas and whenever he asks
[1:07:52] you for some just get him out the fridge
[1:07:54] and warm them up
[1:07:55] and so she made them
[1:07:59] yeah and the day came was
[1:08:05] and so it was easy I knew they were in
[1:08:06] the fridge I would serve myself
[1:08:09] she made him that day and by the end of
[1:08:12] the day yeah there was no more
[1:08:16] I ate all 40 enchiladas in that one day
[1:08:25] and then I asked myself what's going on
[1:08:27] with my clothes
[1:08:30] did I wash it wrong what's up with the
[1:08:33] clothes
[1:08:35] but no brothers
[1:08:38] uh
[1:08:40] is
[1:08:42] for you and perhaps it's funny
[1:08:46] for me it's more sad
[1:08:55] that's where you begin to see if you
[1:08:57] want to change or not
[1:08:59] you want to change the way in which
[1:09:01] you're living a little
[1:09:04] loser does what's going on hurt you
[1:09:05] enough
[1:09:07] to want to to want to make you change
[1:09:10] are you inspired enough
[1:09:14] in my case
[1:09:17] I was inspired to go to the gym every
[1:09:19] day I just
[1:09:23] sometimes I gotta watch the Rocky movie
[1:09:37] um
[1:09:40] many times I do things without thinking
[1:09:42] of the consequences
[1:09:47] and why do we do these things is what I
[1:09:49] ask myself
[1:09:53] because if we don't have heart and we
[1:09:55] don't have God in our hearts
[1:09:58] then there's an emptiness there you know
[1:10:01] by
[1:10:02] [Music]
[1:10:04] someone's going to go to the things who
[1:10:06] they do the things they like supposedly
[1:10:09] to feel that emptiness
[1:10:12] it's different for each person
[1:10:15] but that emptiness
[1:10:18] it can't be compared to anything else
[1:10:22] because that emptiness is specifically
[1:10:25] for God
[1:10:27] that emptiness Only God Can Feel amen
[1:10:30] amen Brothers
[1:10:32] [Music]
[1:10:36] and I was reading a message by Brother
[1:10:38] Branham
[1:10:41] if you're a small quote
[1:10:44] before reading it
[1:10:46] I was listening to what my brother was
[1:10:48] saying
[1:10:50] we have to open our heart up to God no
[1:10:53] he's not just going to come and fill it
[1:10:59] without first opening up our heart to
[1:11:01] him because he is a gentleman
[1:11:05] he wants us to make that choice
[1:11:07] [Music]
[1:11:11] here brother Venom says
[1:11:18] he says that we may have everything we
[1:11:20] need but first we need God
[1:11:25] in the message questions and answers
[1:11:30] a hand can lay an egg
[1:11:34] but if she hasn't been with the rooster
[1:11:37] he'll never hatch noise
[1:11:40] it is infertile
[1:11:43] it hasn't got any blood in it is
[1:11:49] and that's just like what many times
[1:11:50] I've said
[1:11:53] a lot of these old churches around here
[1:12:00] you've got a bunch of eggs all right
[1:12:04] so it's so C
[1:12:06] that's right
[1:12:10] but they'll lay all right there is
[1:12:16] unless they gotta be with the mate
[1:12:18] Christ Jesus
[1:12:22] and being born again and filled with the
[1:12:25] Holy Ghost and
[1:12:28] then they've got life your screen they
[1:12:31] believe
[1:12:32] amen Brothers is
[1:12:34] that's where brother Brandon is trying
[1:12:36] to tell us
[1:12:38] we can come to church we can read our
[1:12:41] Bible
[1:12:43] but if we don't have the Lord Jesus
[1:12:45] Christ in our hearts
[1:12:46] if we don't have the Holy Spirit
[1:12:53] because no life will come from our life
[1:12:57] Lord Jesus Christ wants to use each one
[1:12:59] of us
[1:13:02] to go reach out to other lost souls
[1:13:06] Brothers As We Know
[1:13:10] [Music]
[1:13:11] the world wants to destroy us
[1:13:14] [Music]
[1:13:17] we are focused on what they say over
[1:13:19] here when they say over there
[1:13:21] when the story of brother Brandon
[1:13:25] was there was a big rooster
[1:13:31] feathers las Plumas las Plumas
[1:13:36] the feathers were shining
[1:13:41] he was telling the other animals that
[1:13:43] were there
[1:13:47] I have found one way to have the best
[1:13:49] feathers
[1:13:53] everybody was excited listening you
[1:13:57] and there comes another little rooster
[1:14:02] or little small chicken and had almost
[1:14:04] no feathers or skinny
[1:14:08] and he comes as I also have news
[1:14:12] we're all going to the slaughterhouse
[1:14:14] tonight
[1:14:19] the world might show you a beautiful
[1:14:21] image
[1:14:25] but here the word of God is telling you
[1:14:27] that we're at the end time
[1:14:30] that we have to be prepared amen
[1:14:37] all right
[1:14:40] God's love Brothers
[1:14:44] love is not just a feeling
[1:14:49] many of us have in our mind
[1:14:51] solo ES
[1:14:57] we can see oh how beautiful it feels
[1:15:00] now I know that I am in love
[1:15:04] that's not love
[1:15:10] is what you do without mattering what
[1:15:13] what you feel El Amor is
[1:15:19] love is fighting for the good of another
[1:15:21] person that person never sees the
[1:15:23] sacrifice you're making for them
[1:15:28] he wasn't saying Oh what a beautiful day
[1:15:31] it is
[1:15:33] oh the wind is really nice
[1:15:36] oh look at these nails
[1:15:39] they felt excellent
[1:15:42] no brothers
[1:15:46] that love that he was feeling at that
[1:15:48] moment I heard him so much brothers
[1:15:51] okay
[1:15:54] [Music]
[1:15:56] that's the worst he could have ever
[1:15:58] lived
[1:15:59] again
[1:16:07] I think he would respond yes
[1:16:12] because you know the value that each one
[1:16:14] of you have
[1:16:16] it he knows just
[1:16:19] you're worth more than 10 000 worlds
[1:16:23] it's something so precious
[1:16:27] we could see with the eyes of the Lord
[1:16:30] Jesus Christ
[1:16:32] we could see why he loves us so much
[1:16:36] then we have to give ourselves more to
[1:16:39] him is
[1:16:40] it's a relationship between two
[1:16:45] it's not just the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:16:49] you have to walk towards each other amen
[1:16:52] Brothers
[1:16:56] this is what I had in my heart Brothers
[1:17:06] [Music]
[1:17:08] if you're needing something this morning
[1:17:13] it's a Time
[1:17:17] don't wait for another day
[1:17:19] because tomorrow
[1:17:22] is not promised
[1:17:25] it's today
[1:17:30] so today as If Today Was Your Last Day
[1:17:32] on Earth
[1:17:36] we have to live that way
[1:17:38] as if they were our last day
[1:17:45] we hear that a person here left with the
[1:17:47] Lord
[1:17:48] another person here left with the Lord
[1:17:51] they were 22 years old
[1:17:55] we don't know when the Lord will call us
[1:17:57] home
[1:17:59] we can go to sleep
[1:18:01] and now wake up the next day
[1:18:04] so Brothers yeah
[1:18:06] okay
[1:18:08] let's change that way of thinking
[1:18:11] [Music]
[1:18:12] and try every day to be better
[1:18:15] try to use every second that we have
[1:18:20] and take that Advantage the most we can
[1:18:22] yeah amen Brothers okay
[1:18:25] okay let us please stand
[1:18:31] they're in your heart Brothers
[1:18:33] you speak with the Lord
[1:18:37] and he will answer
[1:18:39] and he will provide what you need

[1:19:08] and worship your sweet name
[1:19:12] that great sacrifice that you did for us
[1:19:15] Lord
[1:19:16] [Music]
[1:19:20] it's something that we're going to try
[1:19:22] our best
[1:19:22] [Music]
[1:19:26] so that we can have a better
[1:19:28] relationship with you
