prayer let's pray lord heavenly father lord here we are once again under your presence asking for more of you father [Music] and also we pray for those that have their hands risen and likewise father

[Music] in [Music] it's a pleasure to be here in the house of the lord 11 25. let's take advantage of the time and thank god for this opportunity and our pastor and every single one of you for being here in the house of the lord and it reads jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet he shall live jesus and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe it me and resurrecting lord father if there's anything that's hindering us this evening so we can have a good fellowship in thy word in the name of our lord jesus christ amen amen you may be seated brother puento mastos we have a special subject we're going to be speaking the title of the subject is he has risen we're going to speak a little bit of the lord jesus christ so as you see here when jesus before before he resurrected jesus god revealed to him what he had to do is and he wanted to do his father's will amen amen so it's it's the same thing with us when we're right here in this in this earth have eternal life with the lord jesus christ we have to go through what the lord jesus christ went through as well everybody has different things they have to take away from their lives and it's typical to take those things away from yourself nobody's going to do it for you god is not going to do it for you you have to make that decision so whenever you pray to god ask for strength don't ask for him to remove what needs to be done amen uh when the lord went through the crucifixion as we know crucifixion is execution of a person a persona and the lord jesus christ went to calvary voluntarily yes even though some of his servants wanted to fight for him like peter come on pedro he didn't want to let those soldiers get him that way we have to believe that sacrifice was for us the lord jesus christ for every single one of us the only way it becomes active in our lives it's for us to believe it and apply it amen amen and uh i was uh hearing a message of brother branham it was titled go tell my disciples and he was talking a little bit of jesus christ about how he was a man but as well was it was god can you read leslie as brother tom was saying was just saying tom today was the day that he proved what it was anyone could die quote he looked like god he proved on easter morning and so this so this is and i was seen as he was explaining that he was more than a man i saw the story of lazarus and how um how mary was there martha and mary were there marta and they were waiting for jesus to arrive to the scene man amen but they were expecting him at a certain time and the lord didn't arrive at that time sooner or later the lord came to the scene and martha marta [Music] by the time the lord got there it was about four days so she tells the lord lord it's already it's already been four days since last year it passed away he still went to lazarus and so he felt the pain he felt that pain of losing a person felt frail at that time he was crying his tears coming down his cheeks even though everybody was thought the everything was over when the doctors say you don't have an opportunity anymore that's when the lord starts to warm up man is many times we want to think about the smartest way of solving it and it might be a small problem but we should not lean on our own understanding and we should just go to god first amen amen so martha's there is marta and jesus is is with lazarus jesus and he's jesus tell us lazarus come forward and last resort that doesn't matter how how last minute we think it is and i lost my job already and now you you want to pray for me now what are you going to do now but that's when god comes into the scene doesn't matter what has happened no important amen and saying uh god is the same yesterday today and forever so he's not gonna change what he did back then today don't change jesus amen amen so what are we doing this evening we're here at church that's great worshiping his name no it's not because it's sunday but because he's our lord and savior that's he's everything to us jesus promised to everybody jesus whoever believes in him shall never die amen amen so i invite you this evening brothers to open up your heart to them to give them all your problems stop worrying about your problems and let him take care of it you just worry about serving him make sure he's the first thing in your life and the rest he's going to do amen amen god bless you brother it's a pleasure to be here this evening i really love sitting down and listening to when our brother speaks here so i'd love to hear in your perspective especially when it's one of our fellow youth specialists he when lazarus no one ever understands how i feel please remember jesus knows exactly how you feel because he went through it when he was a man and so meditating or thinking about eastern i was thinking about this subject throughout the week and i was thinking about why it's so important so i came i came down to this and i started thinking this act that's the reason why we're all here tonight he's talking about he's preaching on a sunday morning or he's preaching on a uh sorry an easter morning who came to redeem the whole human race i think about everything we've been learning just throughout the years like right now we're still focusing on the whole plan of redemption when we talk about reconciliation the basis of all those things is us recognizing what was done for us so rich no thinking he was a man how much pain he was going through at the moment when he was being whipped when they put that that crown of thorns on his head then when they they spit on him all this towards the person who was here to save them i could just think about how much that must have hurt him as a man how much he must have hurt him how much he must have hurt his father he was willing to give up his son me and you and as i was reading a message it's titled living dying buried rising coming and then he says like once he once brother branham was talking to a scientist he says there's only one way that it could have happened he says it was not because the roman spear that he died neither was it the loss of blood says that what that showed he says there was still that shows that there was still blood in his body so that's not what he died from he said he didn't die from the nails that drove in his hands or the thorny crown they placed on his head he says they gambled for his clothes and we read the scripture he says that they were all gathered round i can imagine it's i take this oh oh who wants this quincy who wants it who wants to get it everybody raise their hand i want it i want it why not cause it was something great because they were making fun of him in that pain that he must have gone through he says that jesus was the greatest representation of love that ever hit the earth i'm sorry he says no man could ever love like him and oh no man was ever hated like him no no one that's that's a lot to say we look at history we see a lot of people who we think are evil and we say everybody has to hate them well they were a terrible person but here brother says that no one had ever been hated like he was when he was when he he's saying when he in his last breath on the cross in la cruz just with the vulgar mocking orlando of those that stood by the door not what they do even then yeah even being whipped uncles being tortured he still prayed for us he still forgave he was capable of loving his enemies but you still would not have such a painful death like the one he had that's how painful it was for him in what of it well here we are this morning i'm sorry this night because he died for each one of us not just my sins no no no no no no no no no specifically all of your sins maybe you have co-workers he died for their sins as well fellow fellow students new hats or new clothes he says that that's all right this is he says it's a symbol of something new he said god did something new says which is all right or hunting easter rabbits or bunny eggs or little white chickens or some other stuff well as a successful day and he made us participants of that redemption of that reconciliation reconciliation like i said last time up here he's restoring that fellowship to fellowship with us and something that i like that he kept mentioning in this message brother branham he says he i like the way he puts it you know he says living he loved me dying he saved me said buried he carried my sins far away he says all rising he justified freely forever someday he's coming oh glorious day glorioso so one day he's coming isn't that is that not what we believe is that why we're here and that's why this is important this right here is our foundation this is what like brother branham said it makes our religion real i was thinking of a video that has been shown to me several times i think our brother showed it to us maybe it was a valentine's day and maybe he maybe on another occasion as well you know and just just give you the quick version maybe you've seen it as well it's the one of a man who works on a railroad [Music] the bridge comes down cross when it's time for it to cross there was people having a party there's it goes onto the tracks where the train is supposed to come and the man has this has to make a decision he says if if i don't bring the train the tracks down well the train train's going to crash and everybody on the train is going to die but his son will be his son will be well because his son had been on the tracks or he can bring the track down ultimately killing his son but everybody on that train will live in itself was a type of what the lord jesus christ did for us because in the video she looks at her window and it shows years later or some time passes by and the man's back at the railroad and when he sees that lady once again but now she looks much different she looks in way better conditions not that even though he gave up the life of his son others were able to live and now somebody else was able to live yeah and it's not what the lord jesus christ did for us it was painful and that's all i have for you been a pleasure being here with you and god bless you [Music] the greatest [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] amen amen [Music] um [Music] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] my [Music] [Music] [Music] yo
