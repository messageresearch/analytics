[7:41] this
[7:43] [Music]
[8:31] [Music]
[8:50] [Applause]
[8:56] [Music]
[9:31] [Music]
[9:44] and
[9:51] [Music]
[10:08] [Music]
[10:14] [Music]
[10:16] foreign
[10:18] [Music]
[10:24] [Music]
[10:50] hey
[10:56] [Music]

[11:43] and
[11:52] [Music]
[12:05] hey
[12:07] [Music]
[12:11] uh
[12:13] [Music]
[12:23] [Music]
[12:29] [Music]
[12:38] hmm
[12:42] [Music]
[12:57] and then
[13:00] [Music]
[13:19] [Music]
[14:33] the like figure where unto even baptism
[14:36] does
[14:37] also now save us not the putting away of
[14:40] the filth of the flesh but the answer of
[14:42] a good conscience toward god by the
[14:44] resurrection of jesus christ
[14:49] so baptism is necessary
[14:55] actually it's the first step
[14:58] that a person takes
[15:00] that he takes public
[15:03] to let the whole world know
[15:06] that he is a christian
[15:09] now one thing
[15:10] is
[15:38] [Music]
[15:52] during the last 20 years
[16:04] he was a bank robber
[16:06] and who knows
[16:35] and repents in his heart
[16:38] then he says i accept you jesus christ
[16:42] the question is
[16:47] when he accepts jesus christ
[16:54] was he forgiven
[17:01] washed by the blood of jesus christ
[17:14] looks at him
[17:15] we know this is a genuine
[17:20] has he repented
[17:22] is it possible
[17:25] but then when he sees him go down
[17:28] to the water to the water
[18:13] l
[18:16] he is now clean
[18:21] but in order for the whole world to
[18:22] receive it and believe it
[18:26] is
[19:10] i'm going to start reading from chap
[19:11] from verse 1 of acts chapter 10.
[19:18] here we have cornelius
[19:36] [Music]
[19:50] 5 says and now send men to joppa and
[19:53] call for one simon whose surname is
[19:55] peter
[20:04] he lodges with one simon tanner whose
[20:07] house is by the sea side he shall tell
[20:09] thee what thou art to do
[20:18] peter had already been converted
[20:20] is that right
[20:23] peter had already been converted
[20:30] but see peter's conversion still had not
[20:32] taken away from him his love his desire
[20:33] to be about the scene
[20:37] peter was a tremendous fisherman
[20:39] when he was resting
[20:43] in the desert way inside
[21:02] when the angel of which spake unto
[21:04] cornelius was departed he called two of
[21:06] his household servants and a devout
[21:08] soldier of them that waited on him
[21:10] continually
[21:14] and when he had declared all these
[21:16] things into them he sent them to japan
[21:20] [Music]
[21:25] they were on all their way to japan
[22:10] remember he was at home
[22:16] and there she was preparing the food
[22:22] he went up to the top of the house to
[22:25] wait for the food to be established
[22:27] he was there praying to the lord
[22:32] he was hungry was just killing him
[22:36] like we said brazil he was very
[22:38] how much
[24:02] see the
[24:30] seems like the
[25:26] and then
[25:54] verse
[25:55] 47
[26:08] video
[26:11] then peter
[26:12] answered
[26:14] can any man forbid water that these
[26:16] should not be baptized which have
[26:18] received the holy ghost as well as we he
[26:22] bought
[26:26] and he commanded them to be baptized in
[26:27] the name of the lord
[26:30] first of all
[26:34] follow them over there
[26:36] in
[26:50] baptism
[26:54] is not greater than what god has done in
[26:55] their lives
[26:58] god has already come to witnesses
[27:00] but they're claiming
[27:02] they're clean vessels
[27:17] can one of you forbid
[27:26] i order you to be baptized in the name
[27:28] of the lord jesus christ
[28:14] while he yet spake
[28:16] these words the holy ghost fell
[28:28] and then peter said
[28:30] can we forbid water seeing that these
[28:32] receive the holy ghost like we did up
[28:34] there
[28:39] i believe their sins were already gone
[28:52] and he would not have come in unless
[28:54] they had been predestinated vessels
[29:24] present that had that
[29:26] idea of circumcision
[29:29] that they would not accept them to be
[29:30] baptized
[29:33] first of all put himself into them
[29:36] so no one could forbid water
[29:38] to them
[29:58] don't be impatient i'm almost finished
[30:18] just ask yourself the question
[30:44] and now why terrorists now arise and be
[30:47] baptized and wash away thy sins calling
[30:49] on the name of the lord
[30:53] now here's the question
[30:56] just arise
[30:59] be baptized
[31:01] and wash away thy sense
[31:11] had his sins already been forgiven
[31:30] be
[31:43] and another one says no they weren't
[31:45] forgiven
[31:47] and there's a theological difference
[31:50] they get mad
[31:51] pull their hair out they walk out mad
[31:55] isn't that right
[33:08] uh
[34:05] calling on the name of the lord
[34:10] same thing
[34:15] accept jesus christ
[35:34] i believe paul the reason he had to be
[35:36] baptized again is he had persecuted the
[35:38] christians
[36:10] foreign
[36:30] and when he noticed saul was down there
[36:32] in the room blackened face and darkened
[36:34] eyes and he he'd prayed so hard and dust
[36:37] all over him and he was blinded from the
[36:39] pillar of fire that appeared to him on
[36:41] the road down there and he said i have
[36:43] chosen him a vessel to the gentiles
[36:47] god knew that ananias
[36:49] god knew
[36:50] yo
[37:02] god knew that ananias would be able to
[37:04] baptize him in the name of jesus christ
[37:06] in the damascus river
[37:08] three days later
[37:14] but i believe that his sins were already
[37:15] remitted
[37:18] but he had to do this
[37:47] did you have accepted
[38:16] he was a
[38:58] as
[39:01] [Music]
[40:02] in the name of the lord jesus christ
