me I'm a bit nervous buyer standing uh let's uh please uh please uh if you please start we just open your Bibles too Hebrews 9 11. interest is um but Christ come in the high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands not to say not of this building is neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered once into a whole holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us dancing [Music] of goats and the ashes of the heifers sprinkling Beyond clean Sanctified to the purifier is um how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God pure your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God is uh um first before I begin I want to thank my pastor for giving us the opportunity to speak before you and this is um um well don't don't get me wrong it's an it's an honor to to speak with you about the Lord about the word of the Lord is let's just say I try my best not to be called up and as you can say I'm not doing a good job about it um Carlos and the others have a special talent of finding those who are hiding I'm sorry I'm heading off topic here they wanted us to speak about the topic of redemption and speaking honestly I do not have any new material to share with you and the brothers before me had have done a marvelous job at covering the topic of redemption is also I'm I don't have much experience in in Redemption experience the trials that I've that I've faced are pale in comparison of what most people most people here have experience um that and also I still have my bad habits and I'm not where I should be um on that note I'm gonna try to talk about something that uh that I've heard from previous sermons um but that's that stood out to me [Music] um there was um one brother who I don't remember uh his name um he he talked about the significance of an eagle um now here in the U.S the eagle is a symbol of freedom and of strength yeah but to us as Christians we have a a different deeper meaning for it um according to research the eagle has two stages in its life the stage where it goes from being a hatchling to an adult and the stage of its rebirth um the the now the eagle is a brilliant Hunter when um one of the greatest in in the animal kingdom animal so great that they can see fish swimming in streams of rivers in Los Rios from a couple of miles from the sky um but as great as it is um like all material things they begin to age and lose their strengths um over time the the the feathers of the of the Eagles start to shrivel up and become rotten yeah their talents become dull and old through stalones viejos the and the beak becomes it grows too large and it becomes too heavy for foreign whether it should stay where it is where it has all the the rotten feathers the heavy beak and the dull Talent lascaras or you can change it um I'm sorry I'm still reading my notes um mind this that if it stays where it is then it will it will surely die um starvation then by another Hunter um so when it if it decides to change itself what they will do is they will pluck each feather from their from their wings and from their body is um and they'll rip the talent off of their feet and using a rock from a part of a mountain they will break their their beakoff is um and yes this is very painful for the eagle yes they do this because they know they have to yeah um it's either this or death um so as time passes [Music] those feathers start to regrow back that's Plumas the talents become sharp again and their beak regrows stronger than before uh once the transformation is complete they live for another 10 years uh brother Brown refers talks about this magnificent creature magnifico uh and he Compares it to us because [Music] it the eagle is not just a symbol for freedom and strength but it's a symbol of the Redeemer thank you we ourselves are eagles and we get to choose whether we stay with her with our bad habits or change stuff suffer a little bit so that we can be rebuilt into something stronger and that's all I have right now so I'm going to pass it to my brother is so uh thank you for listening and God bless you guys [Applause] can you hear me um it's an honor and privilege to be with you with this beautiful morning normally I find myself in the audio department and me as somebody who doesn't have much experience to other preachers obedient before going forward too much I'm going to continue with the same topic which is the Plan of Redemption but before going too much forward [Music] I'm going to talk about a small conversation I had about this theme this topic me being young we can say that I perhaps not have too much experience in many things I have to be those who are around me to be able to ask about things that I don't know about and more so things of the message and I asked my father or brother asked my father I asked them advice for the things I don't understand it's also a very easy way to commit a easy way of communication because know he's very blunt with me well no well now it says once we're talking about the Plan of Redemption that topic can't you make it shorter conversations the end of the topic uh the end of the conversation was that Redemption means eternity in which time does not exist foreign no Everlasting oh Everlasting thank you significance we know the Redemption the word Redemption means to receive something or restore something in exchange for a payment so where is the similarity significa is to buy something or purchase something with a Pavement we can first look at the definition of redemptions in The Prince and the main scripture of this theme I'll just be mentioning it the verses that we already read in Hebrews 9 11. it's not by the blood of goats or bulls Eternal Redemption that is for us ke Los Angeles this is that the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ was the only form of payment that could cover our sins so that we can relate both words because it's for Humanity or bring us back to Eternity we have learned or they have taught us that God wants to have fellowship with his people and and yeah and he provided a way for us to get there with him Christ once again took possession of us and that's where we saw the Final Redemption in action I believe that it's something that should make us feel really good I feel good knowing that I have that is and all I have to do is accept it and his Redemption is eternal location and what it means for us that what's going to happen oh what happened it's not going to change that Redemption because we learned that eternity is forever and God it is the same yesterday today so it seems that his word is the same his word is for us it's our guide yeah rely on that or base ourselves on that and with that is in the Plan of Redemption is when you get the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's the earnest of your salvation is that right in other words it's a down payment is the down payment what will it do when we get the full benefit it'll be glorious isn't it I like how brother Brandon mentioned that in the end he didn't say how glorious he doesn't explain it because businesses than the down payment how the down payment makes us feel yeah but how we feel when we receive everything and that is what we're waiting on the thing is you have that guide to reach that end is our goal in the Plan of Redemption I also like our brother Paul said in a couple weeks ago he says that we all we all are part in this planet Redemption it doesn't matter if it's a big purpose or a small purpose we have to accept that plan and let God do his work what belongs to God as accepting that sacrifice or and to live for him yes that's something that sounds very easy right questions we know that it can be very difficult but thank God for this Plan of Redemption this eternal Redemption that covers Us for what the Lord Jesus Christ did for us also says no you don't have to do one thing it's by Grace you're saved this see not nothing that you do no I'm not there isn't one thing you could do another that would amount to anything the plant's already made Redemption is already paid for it the only thing you have to do is accept it foreign to reach our destination that's what we have it depends on us if we want to reach eternity through the Plan of Redemption thank you for your attention Brothers may God bless you [Applause] Hermanos God bless you Brothers in the name of Lord Jesus Christ first I'd like to thank my pastor yeah in the Lord Jesus Christ for this opportunity to be here in front of you he is I was thinking Brothers looking over my notes and everything that God was placing in my heart and I got the thought is maybe with everything you're going to say you're going to be throwing a couple of rocks a couple of stones foreign to be able to survive the spirit requires of certain things no Muerte spiritual a spiritual death is when we need what is from God we don't receive that what we need from God our spirit little by little it begins to die it begins to lose nutrients it becomes weaker man amen sometimes we forget to prayer is so important brothers and when we don't pray it's as if we're telling God that we don't need him that we don't need to have that relationship with him we can do it by ourselves Hermanos the brothers we all know that's more that's more than clear that without God we are nothing and so many things going on in the world these days I was listening to a small story in school or of school more so the um a teacher talking with a student about the things of God in this discussion is reality the teacher was telling the student how can you prove to me that God is real if we've already proved Evolution and these other things he said that if you can't see God if you can't touch God how can he exist and the student was left thinking and he said a couple things in the end and he told the professor it's what we believe in amen amen although on the Diablo ignore Uno when the devil ignores one is that's when you should be worried when everything is done it's when you already cleaned your home you already did everything you had to do that's when you relax well the devil is doing the same we already did his job to depart you from the things of God he already has you in the mud what else are you going to do is what he's thinking so then he moves on to another person and he starts once again that's why it's so important they have the correct mental attitude to be able to understand how God works and amen it's important to know that in dreams we need to have goals we need to have plans it just becomes to a disappointment you'll never reach that dream on the path to fulfill your dreams make him a reality because in the dream if you're not engaged or you're not a tied up or bound you'll never start it is then you'll never finish it amen Brothers he um many times doubt reaches muchas at the Devil places in our mind or in our heads um why this or why the other or why not I'm a son or daughter of God and the questions go on and on and on on the seals is Jesus came to be a witness as a savior of the world correct though is that right they never got to know anything about the Lord Jesus Christ they went right on just like the world know nothing about it but all the time what was going on in the world then see why didn't he let them know El Vino he came he loses were the ones that received him there had been no good to say anything to the rest of them because he could not have redeemed them because they wasn't even redeemable I hear this Brothers it's something very great is it the word of God has reached your life is because you are redeemable because it is for you brother amen amen glory to God you know what's dangerous for the devil [Music] opinions don't matter anymore they just reassure you of what you already knew s and if I know that God if I know what God says of me why am I going to leave what God says about me why am I going to believe what somebody else says if we already know the truth isn't another truth this is the person who's in jail even to the person who's been high in the puppet we all need more from Christ it's not just something that's more on our lives it is to take complete control amen amen it's going to be like oil and water they can't mix you're going to be fighting amen amen okay answers uh is a small scripture we have here it's very simple but it's very important is a no all about second Mateo Matthew chapter 7 verse 21. I'm going to read it quickly you don't have to look for it not everyone that says unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father is which is in heaven foreign Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name is and in thy name have cast out Devils muchos many wonderful works and then I will profess unto them I never knew you depart from me I said how sad that day would be hear those words it would be something so sad something we focus on is I said let's try to impress God doesn't want that he wants a relationship with you he doesn't want you to try to impress him he doesn't want to see how good you can be he wants to get to know you more you can get to know him man Hermanos amen Brothers did not die for us just to make a religion but to make a relationship correct sometimes we have that wrong mental attitude um we give ourselves completely to God we can avoid so many problems God bless you Brothers just a little bit more and I'll be closing is when we focus on that scripture in Matthew the problem is that we didn't know ourselves we didn't get to know each other on the time we were here on Earth you just wanted to impress God oh I wanted to speak with you yeah I want to see how much you love me um we're not at God's level God wants to show us something here on the table we're sitting on the floor we can't see what God is doing we had to lift ourselves up this is God has foreign everything goes by fast it's more than we can count we can please stand thank you very much for your attention is it's something very important Brothers foreign foreign [Applause] [Music] on perfect which is the key for the growth of the Statue of the perfect man we have to have discipline you have to be persistent we have to be obedient sometimes we want to find the mystery in the Bible it's in discipline consistency it's inconsistency it's in obedience if we apply that the dimension of time the Revelation welcome the planet Redemption is God has control of all things during that time we have to have the revelation of who we are yeah [Music] [Music] do what belongs to us [Music] he would provide foreign foreign [Applause] he thinks this morning foreign [Music] to Professor you talk to her through your profits you told us and exposed the power that used then you spoke to us power of decisions the battle that is Raging in this God against Satan who will win the one that went to the one we give them this is Jesus Christ a man yeah man amen God bless you [Music] Jehovah [Music] [Music] you are more foreign [Music] for
