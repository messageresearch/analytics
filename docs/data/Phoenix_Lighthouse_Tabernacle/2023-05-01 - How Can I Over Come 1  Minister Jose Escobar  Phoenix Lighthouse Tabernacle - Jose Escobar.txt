[Music] amen [Music] God bless you all it'd be so kind to please open your scriptures will be going to Revelations 3 21. 21 we can indicate it in with an amen once you have it in the subject World she'll be covering this evening will be uh how can I overcome in the scripture reads to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am sat down with my father in his throne so before I start I'd like to thank my pastor for uh the privilege to be here in front of you um it's a big responsibility but I'm happy I'm happy to be obedient with the topic of how can I overcome or you know the question is that we ask ourselves is how can I overcome or how can I be an overcomer and so a really simple way to think about it is in order for you to be an overcomer you have to have something to overcome and so in thinking of that we thank God for all the trials that we're able to overcome as brother Brandon points out in as he reads the scripture in the message how can I overcome um to him that overcometh he said he says it's it's talk he says he's talking to the individual individual he says if he was talking to the church he would say to she is but he says to him that overcoming and so what does it mean to overcome and said well brother Benham gives us some definitions and most of us we know them now maybe by memory but it gets you repeat them so overcome means to stand the test or it also means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks so how can I overcome well the Lord Jesus Christ he showed us how to overcome he himself is a perfect example of an overcomer and so in the message how can I overcome I have a quote here from Brother Branham 103. and so he says Jesus told us how to do it he overcome means overcome means to stand the test significance that's right correct like all the same old Saints did Antonio like Jesus did amidst all of his enemies he stood the test everything he was tested against he stood it in the presence of the grave and but essential he overcame the grave and here's the key brother gives us all by the word in humility um he says there's the real man says there's the one to make your example are your style and so here I have the key he gives us so you ask yourself how can I overcome it's by the word in humility and so Jesus is the perfect example of an overcomer and so thinking of examples of Overcomers you know I look to the Bible to many characters who are Overcomers and one of the stories that I was interested is the story of shamgarh you know when you talk about shamgarh to a lot of people he's a very unknown character and sometimes people consider him to be overlooked because I believe he's only mentioned twice in the Bible says it talks about in the days of shamgarh and then judges 331 he says it talks about when shamgar delivered Israel and he killed 600 Philistines but thank God that we have a prophet who was able to was able to come we know and paying for us a better picture and give us more details and so in the message uh God commissioned Moses and then you know he talks about shamgar and I'd like to go into it you know he talks about in the days of shamgarh you know Israel didn't have a king at the time and so the ones who did whatever they wanted with the Philistines and so he's he reached there on 30. I've seen in the day of Judges a little old fellow named shamgar he says it's found over in the Book of Judges and then and the Philistines would come and take off everything that they had every time they'd raise a crop and the Philistines would come in and get take what they had and take off and these Philistines about about time the Israelites didn't have any kingdom is in just about the time that they'd get their crops all raised and harvest a 31. he said so one it says the Philistines would take and they hadn't go back so pretty much the the Israelites would do all the hard work says and then when it was time to harvest your crops here comes the Philistines and they will take it away from you maybe there's something you worked super hard towards somebody just comes and takes it away from you it's probably a terrible feeling so one day this little old fellow by the name of shamgar still out there [Music] I just like that little guy he was there standing in that in his barn he says well I suppose maybe we'll have enough grain to feed the family this year Trump trump Trump trump this is that up the road you could hear there there came 600 Philistines he says all in armor with big Spears they were coming to get his crops he says my after all the Harvest he said he said after all the trying after all the effort and here comes and here comes 600 armed Philistines to take away what he had and he says that he looked over and he saw his old wife wearing a raggedy clothes and she was almost naked and then he looked over at his children and they had you know pale skin they were almost starved to death and so it says and so he thinks is it these Philistines is they're going to come to take what I have tengo and so my family is going to Starved and so Brothers this is not looking here I know I'm not a warrior Guerrero I can't fight and there's 600 men what am I going to do brother says you know pacing back and forth maybe a lot of us do at times I'm going to do this he says everything he had done would be taken off over into that big enemy country there giving away to the enemy is that something happened he says that God began to move on him this is the first thing that happened began to get angry okay he says that he looked around and he says I'm in Israel I'm circumcised soy 33 he says and that's an uncircumcised Philistine coming up there yeah he says I'm not a soldier he says I ain't got time to take lessons and learn how to duel or learn how to fight he says but I tell you God's my God so he just reached there and he got an ox code [Music] you know what an AUX code is an old thing with a brass knob at the end of it is he says not to go and learn how to do it says God is your teacher says hallelujah he says the Holy Ghost will back up God's word every time he says I ain't got time to learn about it he just jumped out there and he knocked down 600 Philistines I mean that's a lot of Philistines they stayed fat that year which means that he succeeded in protecting his crops says amen amen he says if there was ever a time that we ought to stand and defy the devil Diablo he says it's now my brother he says that's right foreign you know he says if you want to talk about something ridiculous he says can you imagine Moses he says you know one beautiful morning he says the suns are rising say the birds are whistling he said Here Comes an old man yeah she's leading a little old meal with a wife with a youngin on each hip he lost he says with a crooked stick in his hand and here he goes and so he says where are you going Moses he says I'm going down to Egypt to take over you said he says it's a one-man Invasion and brother Branham says this is something that impacted me he says you know in that day he said Egypt was like Russia so imagine one man taking over Egypt it's like one man taking over Russia once again that sounds absurd it's a uh but God was with him says he says oh my here and he did he says he certainly did he said he went down and he took over because God was with him and so that leads me to the scripture yes you know Romans 8 31 and Romanos he says what shall we say to these things West if God before us then who can be against us and one we have an old farmer with an Oxford who killed 600 Philistines and over here we have another old man with a Crooked Stick like brother Brandon says who conquered Egypt because God was with them and here I have one of one of my favorite stories too you know it's the story of David you know this whole story can be found you know on first Samuel 17 the whole chapter and in the message brother man talks about it as well you know the way he puts it says Goliath came outside he says you know there's no reason why all these men have to die and he says you know if you would ever kill me you know we'll be your servants and so but everybody was too afraid and so you ask yourself why were they afraid well then you read to the chapters you know you hear the description of Goliath so in verse in verse you know it says a champion named Goliath this is um he came out to Philistines camp us it says he was six cubits and they span he said now in the in the message this great warrior David is you know brother Branham says that Goliath is he was nine feet three inches nine feet three inches you know whenever PSI is so now for reference I myself yo I'm about six feet two inches give or take an inch or so um so Goliath was 9-3. so you can imagine he's about three feet above me so he's he's huge enormous so you might say no wonder they were scared of him [Music] and so in verse it gives us more of a description he says he had a bronze helmet on his head is it says of armor of bronze weighing 5 000 shekels [Music] and so I looked around different sources on online in the best conversion I could find is that that's about 125 pounds so he's weighing 120 25 pounds of armor uh yeah in verse six it says that on his legs he wore bronze Greaves foreign somebody else carried a shield for him and so everybody was afraid of him and then excuse me here and so what did he do he said he boasted just like you know just like the devil does like the enemy does he always boasts says in this message you know what he says he gives a he says he likes to boast and carry on like that he says oh he gives a big boast and I said he says sure the enemy when he's got the edge on you it's like oh which one are you 22. just sure the enemy when he's got the edge on you say Let Me Go tennis uh he likes to boast and carry on like that and so he boasts like this for 40 days and then something that I like that brother mentions is that he did it for 40 days and brother Branham says that that's God's number of Temptations He says that Moses went to the mountain for 40 days he came back regresso and he was tempted he says Jesus went into the Wilderness for 40 days and he was dead he was tempted he says and it rained for 40 days he says and so forth yeah so he said that 40 is God's number of Temptations like the enemy does he likes to boast says he says he made a big boost he says NFL on the ears of the wrong fellow he said he said so he was boasting but one day and David said he says you mean to tell me that you let that uncircumcised Philistine stand out there and defy the armies of the Living God is he says why I'll never stand for that and so we all know what happens you know he goes and he approaches him I don't come with a sword he says you come at me with a sword with a shield he says but I come to you in the name of the Lord lord of the hosts you know and you can see even how confident David was because he was trusting in God you know he didn't he told him that he was he says I'm going to cut your head off this is not only that he said that he was going to throw it in the field so that the animals would eat it because he was that confident in in God and so he we know the story he knocks him over and what happens he goes over he takes his sword and he cuts his head off just like he said he would but then what happened after that after he killed him he says that the Philistines when they saw their Champion it says that they fled in other versions it says that they turned around Moses foreign he says brother every time he hollers boo it says and you jump back you'll just keep getting bigger he says but when you take God's word and you say does say it the lord it's written he says he will take his flight and he will get littler he said you know like brother bam says that there's that brother who told him about that dream he had he said but the little devil was attacking him and every time he got back in Vegas that one day he finally went and started fighting back it's not the devil started getting his literally yeah and I like to end here on this quote terminal and it's from the message this great word David next foreign [Music] he says what we need tonight is somebody else who knows where they're at located what we need tonight is men and women who know their position in Jesus Christ and when the devil the devil makes his big boast he says sure he makes his he says he's still making his post to this day he's still making his booster says and in that message he says we have a whole lot of Davids in here this morning he says thanks be to God for that and so thank God for that so how can we overcome well by taking God by his word knowing where we stand and trusting in God you know in one of these messages he keeps asking he says what's in your hands it was an ox code for Moses it was a Crooked Stick and for David it was the sling but with the god with them but with god with them they were able to do amazing things foreign and buy our head so we can pray dear heavenly father father Celestial Lord thank you for being with us this evening I thank you Lord because you're so good to us Lord that's what we want to do we want to overcome just like you did why Lord because we know that there's a reward because and so we thank you Lord for everything we thank you for the good times but we also thank you for the bad times we thank you for the trials and we thank you for the test because it's through those foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] I call in US [Music] foreign [Music] guide me [Music] again [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Laughter]
