[11:26] soon as I hear things that I didn't hear
[11:27] before I must be Sam Bellamy is the
[11:30] scene that's how special this tape is to
[11:32] me mano Garcia in simple numero Cinco
[11:36] but the Garcia in the tape number five
[11:38] and he mentions three words as a
[11:44] reference in Vietnam and a necesita
[11:46] which he references right away in this
[11:48] tape around a assessing that means you
[11:50] know me that in the first in this tape
[11:53] he references the world which is
[11:54] humbleness yeah a Moses couch a low-res
[11:56] Muslim oh no Cavallo's face and okay no
[11:59] me that and we first through our brother
[12:00] colors a reference to what humility or
[12:02] humbleness am I gonna say it is Bihar
[12:05] the way to go up is to go down is lay
[12:07] the dose that's the law of God the
[12:12] gospel honest Clavis sake
[12:14] but brother Garcia gives us a reference
[12:15] to three key words you know this thing
[12:18] and he tells us
[12:19] Jamieson almost inevitable assume that
[12:21] we need to have revelation he ain't in
[12:22] there in understanding Esther's allowed
[12:25] and to understand these three words okay
[12:27] listen Lena which is the word discipline
[12:29] even significant and he gives the
[12:31] meaning la palabra diligently in the
[12:34] word diligence in la palabra
[12:36] su isseo in the world subjective yes so
[12:39] he soon which is submission prolly
[12:42] simply my advanced nickel in this esto
[12:44] the word discipline he gives the
[12:46] definition image says this intern
[12:48] ambient okay career training that
[12:50] rectifies the form Amalia the forms or
[12:54] molds a perfect Sunna which perfects it
[12:57] only secularism Lena this is a
[12:59] discipline in like image I love affects
[13:01] you
[13:01] it's what takes us to perfection center
[13:03] mandala that's tremendous Kinesis demise
[13:06] unequal man and that's its own theme on
[13:08] its own when Esther
[13:10] so significant which is this definition
[13:13] yeah but he says that the word diligence
[13:18] that's the significant it gives this
[13:20] definition yes sniffing I guess
[13:22] establish he's an ass it's stable it's
[13:24] tenacious and not equal they are joining
[13:27] yeah Bleeker locust a silicon esfuerzo
[13:29] and a plastic what you're doing with
[13:30] effort a pony or would accompany Leo and
[13:33] he gives an example within it gives
[13:36] Tennessee domicile indeed in other words
[13:37] is you don't give up estaba hablando ok
[13:40] is the hint that you're constantly vigil
[13:42] or you're diligent yeah look at this I
[13:44] mean you know put into a testimonial
[13:46] with recess he mentions a bit of his
[13:47] testimony under on Mexico when he goes
[13:49] to Mexico in until you kill him a person
[13:51] I'd be hinting he understood that he was
[13:53] a diligent person but a polarity of
[13:55] elements I had probably Spanish to be
[13:56] able to take the message to the Hispanic
[13:58] people who still went Reyes way in LA
[13:59] Lucinda and you find that in the tape
[14:01] por la palabra stream you see on but the
[14:03] word submissive no quietly sarcastic
[14:05] assume which means it's subjective and
[14:07] all that significant he doesn't give the
[14:09] definition fellow scientist Benton
[14:11] minutos less tusita
[14:12] but the next 20 minutes in this tape are
[14:14] la sala de esta palabra so museum he
