his family asking for prayers victor lopez peterson foreign is asking for prayers and she will be having surgery and as a lord to have her in control now bow your heads we'll play for the petitions and offerings god thank you for another day of life may you bless anyone that may have their hand raised or have a petition in their heart we're going to pray for all the offering to pick up may you bless the cheerful giver or most part of the [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] is [Applause] is [Music] christ is for his lord [Music] is [Music] just christ is for he is lord he has risen from dante in his home is and for his lord for he is slow [Music] and he is slow he has risen from the dead and he's slow [Music] [Music] the [Music] christ is in love for his lord [Music] every time christ is one of his moms for he is lord [Music] and [Music] me [Music] [Music] jesus christ is is for his blessings and his mercy and this morning i've got a half year i could have my mother you know today not just my mother but my grandma as well and i thank god before anything else let us read our scriptures and she said oh my lord as thy soul liveth my lord i am that woman that stood by thee here praying unto the lord for this child i prayed and the lord has given me my petition which i asked for him therefore also i have lent him to the lord as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the lord and he worshipped the lord there it's one that we've heard many times very often train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it look another year which we can celebrate this [Music] and above all amen amen [Music] i think that is what every mother wants their sons compared to others who are out there um or how can i repay her with nothing but i believe what she has taught me it might be one of those things that may be able to repay a little bit for me because i know she asked for me a prayer for me he's going to continue asking for me and whatever is and so a good praying wife or mother can do more for the kingdom of god on her knees at home than sometimes a preacher can do on that platform that's my parents have taught me she's more attentive of the children what they should do and i thank god for that this is very powerful because it says i'm going to repeat it once again then sometimes a preacher can do on the platform a mother always asks for her children or her son and we know a mother's love is the nearest thing to the love of god in a man because she has shown me that you know what and i want to show it but how the person always comes to mind look at me send me imagine it's what my mom that's how the voice of my mother is as well reminding me to do what is good what comes to mind is to always do what my parents are talking about what my mother has because she wants to give them everything and everything is the kingdom of god and show them the way and be assured that they get there that's the best thing a mother can can do i imagine in showing her what she has taught me something that has stuck with me i know she comes she's joyful seeing me up here and i thank god [Music] i here have another quote that i would like to mention it's from the philadelphia church now i just got a short piece of history here on the messenger for tonight of john he was born on june the 17th 1703 in epworth rectory england he was the 15th child of 19 children wesley john and susana wesley and here i'd like to focus on this a mother a consecrated saint although with 19 children to take care of she found much time through her busy day to teach her children bible lessons and bible stories and pray for them that's what made the boys what they were the great songwriter charles his brother who gave the world some of the most inspiring songs we've ever had even though his father was the minister or the preacher that's john wesley john wesley that john wesley was who he was because of the teachings of his mother and the prayers of his mother abraham lincoln and they talk a lot about our president abraham lincoln and about his mother and juan wesley i wanted to focus on john wesley mama and his mother because in the way that she asked for them the way she raised them all 19 children i see they all came out well just because the prayers of a mother i love i really have to show that i'm thankful for the mother i have a mafia a loyal mother santa holy you know full of love for me for me for mr manos for my brothers she knows what i don't like and what i do like not just her sons and not just her sons but also my dad and it's something like that you can be very thankful because maybe she doesn't like something but because of that love she makes what her family likes best i also like to thank god for me for my grandma in the way she raised my mother and her children and they were where they're are where they're at today i see my grandma as a as a woman of god that's how i see my mother a reflection of my mother of my grandmother to maybe just show her that i do like i do believe what she does and just repay her just a little bit for happy mother's day to all the mothers [Applause] god bless you i greet you all in the name of the lord jesus christ um i was very very surprised to hear that i was going to be talking a little bit today considering i usually like to hide uh and uh just talk to you a little bit about mothers and a little bit about my mother opportunity first and foremost uh mom where are you [Applause] that is the woman uh islam that raised [Music] maybe like around 12 i believe my mom had the unfortunate task of being playing both roles of mother and father i mean i remember when we first moved here to arizona it was it was a little difficult i mean i was i was small i was 12 again like i said and she was she she had just moved here she had no job i mean we really had had nothing i mean thankfully we had family here that helped us out of course but my mother struggled a lot and now that i'm older and i can see that because now that i'm older and i'm working and i'm doing all these all these uh and i mean if it was i think i think to myself if i think it's hard for me for me i believe it was about 20 times harder for me so i mean thank you mom um i'd like to i have some uh quotes here from a message uh brother branham preached on mother's day in 1959. um [Music] okay so first one would be okay mother is so great she's the first in this life to hold you when you're born she's one of the first hands to touch you and to wipe the tears out of your face now i think that there is not enough honor that we could give to a mother and i believe that there is nothing that i could do that could possibly repay everything my mom's been through just to get me to get me and and my siblings to the to the spot that we are now you know the sacrifices that were made and i understand that there's sacrifices there's things that there always need to be decisions that always need to be made and and some are very hard but i believe that my mother took the the decisions that were best for us because if it weren't for her i would probably not be standing here today proverbs chapter 6 capitulo says verse 20 through 23. reads as such my son keep thy father's commandment and forsake not thy law the law of thy mother. bind them continually upon thine heart and tie them about thy neck at all in la when thou goest it shall lead thee when thou sleepest it shall keep thee and when thou awakest it shall talk with thee for the commandment is lamp and the law is light and reproofs of instruction are the way of life so i think one of the things that come to mind when i read that i kind of just picture it as as i'm walking through this dark narrow path which let's we we should say that you know the path being life and and our parents in this in this scripture because i if you think about it casino i mean you're your parents fathers um and then you kind of have to uh go off of that and then you know live your life based off what they teach you hello and and i mean brother branham says right here and again in the scripture and in his message of mother's day mother is first with the child and she is a great responsibility of what that child will be responsible mother has a responsibility from god it is and that's why i think mother has a special little touch special i believe i i don't remember where i heard it said but um but i remember uh brothers said that a mother's love is god's love if the seas were ink and the skies were paper and god would write about his love it would not it would not finish there would be no end to it inc the seas were inc and the skies were papers he foreign and he just kept writing about his love it would not run out there'd be no end so i believe that a mother's love is exactly the same there was a story i heard about a mother who was an accident in an accident with her kids a car accident [Music] an accident the automobiles the car was upside down and and the mother was able to get out but the children were still in the car [Music] um firefighters showed up the cars the doors would not open they could not get the children and the mother out of desperation out of out of just wanting to have her kids back because even the firefighters have this apparatus called the jaws of life sorry they're pretty much just really big tweezers that cut through metal that can cut through metal and the firefighters couldn't get the kids out and the mother out of out of just pure desperation went to the car and yanked the door right off was able to grab her kids carlos so so that's i think i think that that mothers are our real real special uh blessing that god you know decided to to give us i don't deserve my mother you know you know me mother but i'm very very grateful that she is my mom and i'm i believe it was here my brother joe that said uh god gave us the uh the parents that are right for us that know that know exactly what to do with us so that we may turn out all right here not send her a bunch of flowers but love her but care for her talk to her care for her 306 days and nights she would appreciate it a lot sit down and talk to her just a little bit so [Music] these these are things that that they're really not hard but i find myself that i i miss yes but i believe that you know every day we should we should do better so just doing those small little things i believe would uh would do them a lot of good questions and sometimes i get home i don't even want to talk to anybody i don't want to spend time with my mother because she's she's all i have and we as her kids are all she has so i believe it's it's our job as as as uh their children to take care of them and look how i look at after them because unfortunately it is a little sad but they they won't be here forever so love them as if it was the last day but um yeah just keep going strong that's right um i believe my time is up thank you so much for your time god bless you and happy mother's day [Applause] lord jesus christ they asked me to speak a little bit about mother's day it's a great honor to be here god bless all the brothers who are watching us via internet and so to begin i like to mention that having a mother especially it's something very special they not stop thinking about all the things they have done is our there were about two million children who grew up without a mother that would have been about three percent of the population here in the united states which is about four percent and that's very sad because a mother is something so important to a child that when a son or daughter doesn't have their mother by their side [Music] it's the scientists say that it's very difficult for them to find a substitute it has long-term effects on their self-esteem that's something that the young man or young lady starts to experience later on in their life that's the only reason is because they didn't have that guidance of a mother in the beginning so we have to thank our mothers everything they do for us each every day [Music] i don't see my mother here on to today i know she's watching through internet i want to say god bless you it's one of the greatest things god has given me the good thing is that god knows all things if you're fortunate enough today to have a daddy and a mother living amelos love them the hour will come when you'll think they're the greatest people in the world and don't ever little fellows don't ever give this slandering word old man or old woman that's not the old man and old woman yes today can be the last day the last day they say some loving words to your mother and we take it lightly we won't do anything you have hear them lower down in the ground the pastors say denise alas and now in the best flower you could give them is obey them and that's the first promise in the bible as we know you can find that scripture in the book of exodus [Music] they don't just work during the day they also work at one we still don't have much experience giving our mothers flowers and gifts on them on mother's day that is very good [Music] but this isn't the only day we should do it abraham lincoln and i saw the quote from abraham lincoln [Music] if there's anything that i want to give praise to or my life was influenced by where was a godly mother who taught me to pray and to know jesus as my savior i believe that all the young ones here that's something they can say our mother has taught us to follow the lord it's a great blessing uh is george washington which is george washington my mother was the most beautiful woman i ever saw i attribute all my success in life to the moral intellectual and physical education i received from her we all know these two presidents we know the great things they both did when they were president [Music] and they said that their mother was the greatest thing that helped them do what they did so brothers let's do the same we first have to do these basic things to honor our fathers and our mother everything turns out fine so we can be successful because they're based on their founding on the word of god in the word of god we know is perfect we know it's perfect that's nothing better it doesn't change like this [Music] but that does not mean that i do not feel how much i love you [Music] how much i appreciate you and how important you are in my life your love guidance and correction is priceless and all the money in the world would not be enough to buy such genuine love although many times i was rebellious it doesn't hurt [Laughter] [Music] physically and spiritually it helps us move on in the path of god that nothing can get in our way we can only just be obedient towards our parents problems we wouldn't have so many problems because they already went through so many things they already went through things that we're going through and we know that if we do it a certain way we can avoid so many problems amen so thank you thank you a lot brothers for your attention may god bless you and thank you [Applause] stand up for a minute please i want you to rest uh just a minute i don't know if you know no but i'm proud of these boys mothers you've done a fantastic job brothers what i'd like you to do is now if you're a mother's don't sit down she these young men [Music] and this is my greeting for today god bless each mother on this day i appreciate what what you've done with each son and daughter that you molded and nourished for the kingdom of god god has honored your prayers and your faith words were coming through my thoughts what is a mother words can only describe a mother but it's a mother's love that comforts a child when he's sick it's your mother mothers you are the ones that help in the early stage of reinforcing their character mothers you are the protectors the one who implants the vision and the goals for the future the word of god the word of god mother mother you're the first teachers both at home and at school i know
