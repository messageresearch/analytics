thanking each one of you for your attention to our pastor for the confidence and trusty places in me this evening My Brother Carlos you know brother Javier and albertini as well I'll be going directly to the word to make time last for some reason I'm a bit nervous to Hebrews 9 27. and after that we'll be going to first Peter 4 17. reads innovail Peru this is [Music] and as it is appointed unto men wants to die but after this the judgment and first Peter 4 17. ie said for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of God and if it first begin in us what shall at the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God and if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and The Sinner appear let us pray Heavenly Father we put ourselves in your hands Lord the words we speak human anoint with your Holy Spirit this place may be strengthened in our spirit and full of joy foreign [Music] Lord Jesus Christ amen amen tomorrow these glasses are just breeders I only need them to read if I leave them on then I can't see you is take them off and I can't read say a is so we're reading here in the scripture I want to call the attention of each one of you okay the scripture speaking to us about a judgments you know that all the Christian World in all the religions a yes they all have to believe that that they will come which they call it judgment which I myself also believe [Music] let me tell you one thing I don't expect to be there on that Judgment Day brother how do you say that the Bible says that's what I want us to see in this evening uh questions what is a judgment um the judgment is made up of several people ones that are accusing and others that are defending now this judgment or this trials I want us to look to him that is since I was born I grew up listening to the message of the hour for some reason at time at that time we were raised as children educated in the message profoundly argument but I considered myself a child that can argue with older people a child of 10 11 or 12 years old arguing with an older person but it was because I had really good teachers pero que me separated at a time where I separated from doing the will of God with that person who would rebuke me this is and you were saying you might say was it the Holy Spirit partially but let's see what the scripture says era mi corazon it was my heart the scripture says in First John 3 20. amados foreign foreign because when the Holy Spirit comes to this place many times the first one that doubts is our hearts and in our heart we begin to doubt is it true am I being brainwashed there has to be a battle with our own heart out of those things that we let enter our heart but there's also some that we should avoid at all costs because if they get to our hearts they're going to cause us and then later it's tough to get it how many times have we not spoken with people who just have that root of bitterness spoke about that root of bitterness and we let that tree grow and it entangles in her heart yes it begins to imprison Place pressure on her heart is no longer space for the things because that heart is occupied so what do we let enter into our heart now one of the things that we need in our hearts important one of the most important things that we need in our heart is love why love Brothers I would prefer that maybe a gift come into my heart and I can do wonders what the scripture says okay even I spoke angelical tongues and I gave all my money to the poor and I don't have love then I am nothing no I can have all of those gifts are we going to display love is love has fruits love has a face love is projected you project that love now how can you say that love has a face a Poland now by the grace of God I have many years and believe me that I am happy and believe me that I am very happy with the job that I do this is and you're saying oh we're just standing there at the door brother yes Brothers for me it's a great thing to be there at the door because many times I'm the first one that greets each one of you I give you a welcome I try to make sure you feel good but sometimes since we already know each other okay I can see that somebody is coming in a certain situation one has to be cautious because when you see that a certain brother comes in a certain situation wants to fight that's the first thing I do he foreign and I just grab them and go like that and I say why don't they greet me but there's no problems we all walk under different circumstances different thoughts things that there is in our mind I wanna uh now I'm very curious in my mind and I think a lot of things I love all of you that says that we should love even our enemies let us love one another look at my brothers and say well I love all of them but sometimes I can't beat everybody's friends no brother I do love you many times something foreign that was my way of thinking he said remember when you were a young person and you were respectful Amen brother our brother can also get us out of that problem we find ourselves in each one of them but sometimes I fight with them they're not all my friends I'm more friends with one than the other obviously maybe I'll see one I'll say hey what up but I love them brother my sisters they're so different one from another either and from the other [Music] I can't tell you that I haven't had problems with them I know that they love me and I love them I don't go and visit them to their house but they know that I love it why because I respect them because every chance I get I show them that I love them with a hug porque is because that helps in a great manner God bless you there isn't a greater thing we could tell our brother this is the platform good morning friends palabras iOS but those were words that to me were very precious I hear them just simply listening to that is it's a very great thing to me for someone to call me their friend that they even the even the god of the heaven can call me his friend but we're talking that we're at a trial or out of judgmente foreign like the Judgment says all living beings one day will have to face judgment yes and that sometimes causes fear among the people is established that means it is that we will die once and then comes judgment now the scripture tells me that it's something terrible I expect to stand in the presence when there's a heart that's judging me every day but I can't fool his heart I have tried I can't fool my own heart in the same way the man do you believe that one day there will be that day of judgment amen Amen brother because that's the way the word of God says it pero is so then what is Our Hope our scripture says that if the heart our heart does not rebuke us but I want to tell you something I don't know about you know my heart continues to rebuke me every day my heart tells me buenosis well you did this you could have done more okay oh well you're doing this you can always do more a is simply just listening to a message or listening to the word brother foreign because it's good to have the word in our mind pero but the wind will take it away we need to let it go into our hearts so that instead that root of bitterness growth that heart can be filled with love when that heart is full with love nothing else will be able to go inside and whatever leaves from there it's going to be of benefit to all of my brothers because we can't just speak empty words hablar de Corazon we need to speak from the heart and do what we say Jason I love you and then we live and I don't even greet him or anything well then something's not right we need that our actions match with what we're talking about now why does our heart rebuke us because when we were created we were created to Worship the Lord to live according to his word pero we were infected with that thing called Death and when we were infected then the battle began against ourselves because like the Apostle Paul says what I don't want to do I do is what I need to do I don't do hermano is bro that's the Apostle Paul now imagine yours but each one of us should think of that if the Apostle Paul these words how much more should we now let me tell you the time has gone by and certainly we will face judgment I must imagine now just imagine a little bit Daniel Curry and all those who have heard the testimony of Daniel Curry in front of the Throne of judgment that would be the worst of the worst no Daniel Daniel Curry was speaking the truth I've done this work so many Souls have come and accepted the Lord Jesus Christ but even then he was rejected only by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is that he found an opportunity I may ask you how can we find our opportunity because I want to tell you I was born with that guarantee that one day I will die I believe that we all have that guarantee we don't know brother but we're gonna die either and afterwards judgment well let me tell you that there's an Escape Route what are we doing here this evening my niece asked me yeah they came from the beautiful city of Juarez to come visit us I'm going to ask him if they can please stand they can see where my wife got her beauty from why are we going to church again that's what she was asking why are we going again no I'm asking you why are we here again why do we come to church on Sunday on Thursdays why the word says Lord this this word is tough It's foreign this evening if you're thinking of living a religion then you're wasting your time because what I've been says we should live the word without taking nothing away and without adding anything how are we going to live this world that's what we thank God because at the final time they gave us the word directly inspired that way neither you or I would be but what are we feeding on the YouTube is it YouTube is it the things that people are saying what are we doing there we have a profit I came and brought us the words foreign be judged twice for the same time and we allow the message if you allow the word of God to judge us and who can who else is the very own God from the heavens in words it's judging us each day who else has the right to judge no one will judge us no one judges the Bride of Jesus Christ thank you now greet your brother bless them I really enjoyed the the message that our brother brought remember one thing what we are doing here on this Earth we are being judged let me say it over again our Prophet taught us one thing we are being judged here so we're not judged over there and you say Amen how many want to be judged here forgive me I was going to speak both languages we're being judged today everything we do we're being judged that is why that is we have this agent free moral agency where we can ask for forgiveness ask for forgiveness then is more than willing to forgive us we need to do that ask for forgiveness I think we ask for forgiveness every day because our heart will condemn us the love that we project is going crazy sitting there my mind was working uh double time is remembering what brother Garcia said and I'm tell you right now you mentioned brother Paul and mentioned that was brother Paul yes so take your seats for a momentum I'm gonna take about five minutes I want you to think about what I'm gonna say okay what I need you to understand is this whatever you need tonight all you have to do is ask we don't ask when we don't receive so number one forgiveness we can ask for it my body hurts I can ask that he healed my body my mind is is way off he can heal my mind yes or no so how many of us are so involved mentally that we're losing control every day is a constant battle here this is where the key battle is and what he said don't let it get into your heart that's where bitterness comes in careful the bitterness let's get into your heart so let me tell you the root of bitterness because there's always a little bit of a root that stays in there and it continues to grow and I can tell you right now somebody needs prayer anyone needs prayer then what I want you to do I'm not going to call an altar call I know it's hot outside but it's hotter in hell and it is in Phoenix so we're being judged if you need prayer just stand up I'm standing up so I need prayer we need prayer I think we all need prayers every one of us because it's a constant battle that we're fighting because I know the result is winning people that were baptized today those three people that were baptized what does the Bible say they need to be what is filled with what with the word l-o-v-e love amor otherwise those individuals will hear something filled with the wrong character when I said you know somebody of Jesus Christ this evening every fiber of my body this is an example of what you ought to be they made the first step happily without a shadow of a doubt that they received part of Jesus Christ when they came up now the more they feed it that's what we believe Jesus the more spirits so just raise your hand up to my Lord pray I'm going to pray for myself I'm going to pray for you people send me texts that they wanted prayer they needed my name is separated it has a conflict within the family structure families I just my family our families are in a conflict espiriendo first of all that you bless these three individuals [Music] they took the first step father

hearts the father we ask these things in your preciousness in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the Bride of Jesus Christ amen amen we are part of the Lord poor Danny's not here come here come and
