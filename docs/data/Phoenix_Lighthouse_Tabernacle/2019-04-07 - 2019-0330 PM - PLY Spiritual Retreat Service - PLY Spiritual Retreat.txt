[Applause] [Music] Oh god bless you me take your seats please so this video that we're about to watch right now we've seen it before but it's very much worth seeing again so let's please a play close close attention again we seen it already but it's worth watching again god bless you [Music] [Music] I am here tonight to tell you about a father who loved his son and a son who loved his dad the way this story's gonna unfold for you it's a little bit different because I want to bring it to now you see a dad would go home and he would go out of school every now and then he would pick up his son and say son could you go to work with me the boy loved that and when his dad would just come and pick him up he was the happiest boy ever he knew that he would get to spend the afternoon with his father and working and he would get his coat and they would walk and he he would bring hot chocolate for his son where it's really cold and they would they would go through but this boy was different this boy would see things this boy wasn't normal and when he whom they were walking one afternoon going to where dad worked this boy would notice things that other people would notice he see things other people wouldn't see he sees a man in a bathrobe in the middle of the street who's yelling at a second-story window he sees a woman who's very angry at him and doesn't really want to hear what he says this boy is the rest of the world hustles by he slows down he sees them hurt and the pain he sees the English in the sorrow he sees the window closed and a desperate man and this boy would see these things his father rushes that gets him by the hand and says let's go be late he would stop and look one more time can I stop his ping but the boy loved his father they would go and they would catch the trolley I think that's what you call it here we call it a tram yo know the words but he would get on there with his dad and the boy would just notice people he would look and that day one particularly he noticed something as he got on the train as you can hear there's a train coming and I gotta get through this before the train gets here he saw a man he saw a woman he saw that the man seemed very happy and the woman seemed very sad and you couldn't understand why they could be together and one be happy and the other be sad he couldn't understand that but the little boy knew that there was something wrong he had this feeling this instinct that was amazing how he cared for other people but he loved none other than his father he knew his dad he loved him and as he watched the world and they're hurting their plane he knew that he would always have a father but even noticed this I need you to understand as you hear this story and get involved in the life of this man and his son I need you to notice that there's no mom as they walked through the woods the boy would say to his father dad what will I do when I grow up well world I get to do wacky the cool job like yours how will I work I don't know but I want to change the world I want to do something great I'm going to do something wonderful I want to help people I want to do something that they can change the lives of anyone I just want to be that great I just want to do something good and as he walked with his dad his dad was saying son you will be great you will be awesome you will change the world your life is gonna be incredible there was a train coming [Music] we're all on the train of life just riding whether we realized the truth or not were to really realize what's happening or not we're all on that same train to me only God has saw it fit for us to be in the same room the same car for such a time as this when I get to the edge of the train track he could see where his father were we see the bridge that's what his dad did you see the bridge was very very important boats needed to come to the harbour to get off their goods so they could make money but trains were coming with people going from one town to the next not many cars in Europe so they couldn't use a lot of that too many people not enough roads so everybody to get from the town to town to get to work and to get home then one day the train was coming by what you have to understand is that boy in love going to work with his dad he was saved by the river's edge and he would do what he loved to do the most let me explain that he loved to fish anybody liked to fish all the guys go the dad looks at his boy and he says son now remember the rules you got to stay right here because I can see you from the window right here don't get out of the side of this window because you got to stay there as you can hear the train's coming the father's job was cool if I wouldn't preach I wouldn't mind doing that get to work get grease on you even if you didn't have to just support it on that's why we do there was a boat coming in the harbor timing is very essential I'll go ahead and give you the key the key is this there's always a light everybody say light say it again one more time there's a light that the train conductor needs to see if that light is green he can go if it's red he must stop you see God has given us road signs in our life that we must read tell us to stop whether we read those and believe them or not is up to us that's why some of you have fallen and you cannot get up but tonight that's why I'm here the boat needed to come through so he called no man said ok I've got time it's a long time before the train should come so he pulls the lever as you just saw and the big big huge stone steel bridge the gears started turning they started cranking the steam all of a sudden gears are moving and that big huge bridge is just starting to go up as it rises higher and higher he has to watch and make sure everything set everything's good everything's fine as he looks out the window he could see everything but the dad being a good dad keeps one eye on his work but the other eye on his baby one eye on the world but the other eye on his children you think God doesn't know where you are he keeps one eye on his world and one eye on his child no matter what you've done a word you've been it's one eye on the world but the other eyes on you he's watched you and he's kept you even though your train is coming down the track he understands that and even though sometimes see the red light he didn't see it so many times just say the train was early the boy can hear and see the steam and he looks this at Danny to train daddy Denny to trains early daddy you got a daddy hey daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy the track daddy the train's coming but the dad looking at the gears making sure he had enough oil making sure there was enough steam to get the bridge back down for the Train and then to what the boy knew one thing they listened the boy knew that his dad one time showed him where the trigger was it was a red lever if he pulls it the Train bridge with claps down fast and the train will be able to come across all the point knew was there were people on that train there were people that needed to be safe there were people in the head sometimes just with their friends having a good time like everything's fine they did not know that the bridge was up they did not know what was coming they're just living their life like you and me just going down the road just leave the whole thing doing the whole thing and the dad all of a sudden here's the train coming he looks and he said well my son he looks out and his boys gone he's like oh my god where's my son where's my son he got me he looks like just in time to see his son trying to save the day all he had to do was pull that lever he reaches in the pulley and the boy pulls too far and he falls in the hole now it's owned the Father and God the Father did you hear me God the Father has to make a choice it's his now do I save my son or god save the world but they don't even know they don't even know the greatest decision of his life he can blame it on them not seeking the red light he could blame it doesn't matter anymore pull the lever save the world leave it up save your son for God so loved the world that He gave His only Son they never would know I didn't even know the train goes by it's fine everything's cool two breaches down just like always it's always gonna be down for God so loved the world that He gave and you know what's amazing I wonder what God did right when his son died on that cross when he breathed his last breath when he took that breath and he fries it it was over just thinking about the person they're gonna see the people they're gonna hang out with just trying to be caring doesn't matter if you're blind doesn't matter if you're putting a little more makeup trying to look pretty for somebody you're just wearing another mask liquefying her but in one moment are you listening in one moment is the Bible says everybody gets a chance and one woman had to see the look of the Father when he knows what he did for you when you realize the sacrifice when you realize he let his son die so they could live when you realize what he did no matter what you're doing no matter where your retinas life no matter what you're part of you gotta stop you gotta stop even if it's for one second I think my god he did it for me pray to God you did that's why you're so quiet you see the trains but why do I keep doing even Paul said why do I do well flesh tells me and I do what I know is wrong and I don't do what I know is right you can understand tonight the fight is on and we can win we've become more than conquerors you Jesus Christ and I'm not preaching just for me I'm preaching on behalf of you but you gotta understand this there had to be a moment in those three days when Jesus died on a Friday and rose again when it was just God every sin that's ever been committed I'm here to tell you that as the Sun sets in the afternoon the Sun will rise again and when the Sun rises again you cannot change your past but you can't change your future you see it's always a different day one day someone lives the next day they die the next day you wake up and you're still living you're like what am I gonna live what does this have to be my turn one can see the whole picture here you see because when God the Father gave His only Son when Jesus Christ breathe his last breath that he died he did it in a way that you can never ever say you don't know me you don't understand me God don't understand my pain God don't understand my sorrow you see that's the very dream that was that boy was on that's the very tree that he was on and as this dad remembers look real close you see the pictures of the people BAM there's somebody added in a picture in the pan there they are do you see who's that and in it in every face of every person Jesus is in their life why because when you're the greatest sacrifice you always end up in everyone's life no matter where they are who they are he did it so that you can say he was there waiting patiently Jesus Christ was there all the time in the Train keeps coming train keeps moving people keep living people keep dying and God the Father the other I own you some of your second figured I'd like what is he looking for just one girl cuz he the whole horrible day God only had his eyes it was just a day and she's so [Music] [Music] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in dollars well but you enjoyed this video and it's opened up your eyes I mean we can man Tate a little bit but what the Lord did for us so I meant their letter knows you through the stairs to
