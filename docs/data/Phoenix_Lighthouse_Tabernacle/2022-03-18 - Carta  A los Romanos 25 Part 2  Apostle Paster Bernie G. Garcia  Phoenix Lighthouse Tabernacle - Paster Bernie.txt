========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] uh so we can see a little item some small details so we can see clearly what god has done for us the more i see it the clearer i see it the more it makes better right there's several messages that the prophet talks about and one of them in particular is the masterpiece and you know how it is that god created man in his image that what man was god's masterpiece placed him there and then how man felt [Music] to bring up his because it's mine when we hear the message hearing the tapes uh we see certain things that brother bradham taught one of the things is that masterpiece came through four stages a 37 and 3 it is israel this is israel jacob is now israel loved joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colors how many sons does jacob or israel have that had 12. whom did he love the most of many colors these different colors they all contain the colors of the rainbow it was let's look to see what this code of many colors is open up your bibles to the book of judges is verse 30 of chapter 5 judges have they not sped have they not divided the prey to every man a damsel or two to sisera the prey of diverse colors a prayer diverse colors of needlework of diverse colors of needlework on both sides mean for the necks of them that take the spoil they're says the bible says of diverse colors a needle work on both sides meet for the necks of them that take a spoil in other words for the head or the leader the clothing of diverse colors is both for the head oh or for the the head man that's why when the israel will dress joseph with the code of many colors he loved him and he placed him as a head the head man over the rest of his brothers joseph had had a dream for 12 stars bowed to him and people say well how can he represent jesus christ is or the captain let's look at another scripture second samuel samuel second uh samuel is right before kings and chronicles first a second samuel excuse me second samuel chapter 13. he if you study here how it says how that absalon amnon's brother comes and avenges his sister tamar would have been violated by his brother her brother my purpose this morning is not to speak about them but just to emphasize a little something here second samuel chapter 13 verse 18. and she had a virgin as she excused me she had a garment of diverse colors upon her for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins appareled this code of colors it was a vestment that the daughters the virgin daughters of kings wore uh when they would see a lady walking with a dress of many colors they and tamar put ashes on her head and rent her garment of diverse colors that was on her and laid her hand on her head and went on crying given a sign that she was had been dishonored she ripped up her guards because she had been dishonored yeah just keep your bible open twitter to chapter 5. and if you can review what i'm saying i find that there's a book written within and without esta and it is sealed now let's look at revelations chapter 10. yes i needed money are you ready and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and the rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire i'm going to show you this sketch now i wouldn't and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven there's only this indian london where did the angel come down from from heaven he was clothed with a cloud that is open your bible and i saw another mighty angel the angel was mighty and he came down from heaven he was surrounded the the strong angel he is inside the cloud and he's surrounded by a cloud then the cloud represents power glory surrounded this angel thou came from heaven i placed the seven colors because it was a an arc above it was it was uh this is rainbow separated the word rainbow it shows do you know that the clouds they start they start coming in then it starts to rain that's where the seals were open and they showed an above they was going to pick up the other part of that and then here from the earth will from the [Music] sierra seven seals were opened what did these seven seals do i don't know mysterious they opened up the mysteries in his father's old age and he dressed with many colors the seals were you know how the prophet types the human beings upon the earth [Applause] more than anyone else we were manifested when the ancient of days sat down let us read it let's look at daniel 7 and verse 9. olympia i'd be held till the thrones were cast down and the ancient of days did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like the pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame and his wheels as burning fire de fuego is fiery stream issued and came forth from before him thousand thousands ministered unto him and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him the judgment was said and the books were opened yep come in then we were manifested when the ancient of days maturity and he visited us he not funeral that this should be the age of perfection but i always wondered how could it be possible there was a holiness in the cleanse of that how it came about i don't know i didn't even live in that age but there was something beautiful amongst them king's chamber but that's not the age of perfection how could it be then that we are called the age of perfection it is because is to behave like a daughter of a kid is without having time to prove it if it is that way i want you to understand that i believe that dogma then god's seven full compound name are displayed through the members of god's mystical christ mystical bodies for example jehovah he knows where he's going where he came from he knows where he's standing is how are we not going to be perfect how can we help being perfect for dress i'm going to finish now i'm going to try and say it perfection and addressed the virgin last circle we'll come back in type we have returned again in time to the garden of eden and we find there that man is there who brought us to it was the sacrifice of the lord jesus christ which permitted man to return once again come into that and we cast out the devil the invisible union behaves that i've spoken that's where the head [Music] in the name of the lord jesus christ [Music] ah [Music] [Music] is me [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] my [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music]
