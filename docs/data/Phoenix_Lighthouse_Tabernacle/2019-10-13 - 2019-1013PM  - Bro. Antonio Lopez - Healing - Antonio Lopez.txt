and we really have to be a our pastor Thomas Castello he also stressed up a story because not a lot of people are doing what he's doing okay now I muchas casi lo que él hace going from country to country you know the pipe is month every month cada mess so we thank God for pastor Lamas gonna do is punish the past or come in so I have a small power here aqui tengo una Pentimento I uh I found this book here in my house in contrast le bro and Mikasa I didn't even know I had any savvy oculata Nia there is hopefully I'm not the only one that finds both of their house in Mikasa well it's been a great blessing una gran bendición and it's a this book is from a prophet brother william branham i said he was gonna stop a feta mono william branham it's called demonology some a Dem on over here it's a three parts in this boat some tres partes de libro there's so much in the book i tanked honestly bro then I'm still in the first part kappa das a story too obvious to end up in a beer in the book for like few week master it's to really understand liberal pour unison - yeah and I'm still in the first part cuz I have to continue really asked overlapping me apart a pork a well-balanced I feel the information in the first part for Kyra's intercooling for Mussina la primera parte it was so good a stamina so it's full of blessings that you know that has been easy onus there I just can't continue I feel like I'm leaving some stuffy you know pose I say give me siento como que toda hunt I'll go atrás so this first part - next up I made a party is called a physical room si mi el drano physical so it's talking about our healing our healing star a lot of communists acai that which is gonna be the main my my title is this afternoon I said meaty pillow and esta tarde it's gonna be simple but very important I said see simply pero muy importante the just the healing part the master party this sunny that this is where this first part of the demonology talks about okay is okay habla de la primera parte Damon Damon or here anyone here brother branham breaks it down down to the cells no brainer lockira hasta las olas so if we begin see empezamos so for for our healing somebody hadn't paid the price as we know first on a sunny net alguien tuvo que pagar el precio any man I mean somebody had a die for us again - okay Maurice por nosotros our Lord Jesus Christ died at birth mr. sinister customer upon nosotros and God is the only one that heals it's a saloon Akaka sauna brother branham was out as I was reading the book my co-star Liendo el mensaje libro he was telling us in the study siendo that there's many that God is the only one that heals es el único que sana there's nowhere in history and I knew our part in astoria the medicine that says that medicine cure sickness calamity scenic una enfermedad that's only God si no mas s Dios medicine can help you get there that makes en ella puede ayudar kill a guy II my make things easier and Horus las Casas mess fussy but it does not do the healing no hace las honey that God is what takes care of the Hyun oh-seok a Silas I need that man oh man these are Brendan brother branham's words yes son las palabras de hermano Branum he says y LD say well let me tell you but they can make this illness there's not one speck of medicine ever did cure any sickness existed Lamas minima portion the medicine aquella Corrado algún enfermedades no one doctor no less he's some quack me no I knew goon medico a menos que se algún charlatan but a real doctor will tell you that they do not claim to be healers but on Brad aeromedical lady rock a just Nora Clemens their son odorous and right up over the door where Jimmy m-miss most of a la puerta on the Jimmy Ayo's this is talking about the male aqui aqui esta hablando de la clínica de los de los hermanos me oh my oh he's taught as we know it now is probably the Mayo Clinic though that we hear of today now let's say most case like any cameo cameo toes or emos they became a great big clinic now a grand clinica and so as we continue reading you can Coco Tina Mosley and oh the mayo clinic they they also they they said that they do not profess to be healers like okay you know professors and odorous they only profess to be assistant nature the same case no much professional is that a lot natural esse so they just hope the body you must know Master UNL quirt you put everything in place or guardian to the healing your opponent Austin su lugar para que Dios a gala Sonny that amen amen that's what the the medicines for SOS la medicina so as we continue here a continuous there's two ways we're how healing comes I just wanted Eskimo be any less than he that it comes through divine healing when a poor sunny that Davina or through a miracle Apollo Milagro man then and they do have their differences AC teen ensues diferencia because the miracle / - Emile agro as Jesus did miracles como su so Milagros miracles you can have a cancer here in the body but their cancer and so cuerpo and somebody prays for you and the second later is no longer there it's not in existence again hora por usted lo opossum Segundo you cannot study is there's not much of a process you know in mucho don't process oh man man divine healing is a little bit different Bassanio Davina's Paquito different a divine healing there's a process Purdue man here you see I in process of Palace Ani that at least it's a longer process or soon process of mass Largo man because divine healing its brother branham state man abandoned he said they'll ask me that divine healing it's something it calls the life out of if it's a tumor or cancer whatever the sicknesses it calls the life out of it si la salida de vino' yama la la vida de lo que es around two more say a cancer and as we're gonna get in deeper into them my wasn't our mass our interests don't see but before we go any further by the sky by Ausmus lejos I want to ask what what starts sickness from Turkey in PSL and Fermat that it's uh it's first a spirit Ramirez from a speedo and then it becomes a disease you know assassin and for me that whatever the disease is called carrion from like I said it's a cancer diabetes yes unconscious yes alga Bettis it's first the spirit we made as soon as spirit to and then it it turns into a disease you know what Yaga said wooden vermin that same as we are were first spirits come on hasta supremeness almost espiritu's and then we become human being and there was so much Amano's man I mean where are our body changed changes over time so cuerpo Cambiaso with tempo brother brandon say is around 25 years old - a que ellos dicen Kuan Yew's you find a few wrinkles under your in your eyes under your eyes in Quinton Lucas some gray hairs coming on gonna scan us in May it's going to be because death is after you as he said uh porque la muerte viene por usted and as as we know that comes comes for everybody come on we must have more tape in a por todos it doesn't matter if you have money no no no no see anything narrow if you if you have drive a nice car cause you stepped in your own when carro or a nice house steering a casa sooner or later it's gonna come for you and it's gonna get you a 10-pounder when he produced at aloha tomorrow but the good part fell apart a winner is that when you believe in God comes that crate and Yost and you've been paid for a god Easter is the us who stay svl adios there is just a separation Marty no mas Asuna separation and you go with God now if they save a con Dios amen amen so it doesn't keep you if you believe in God you will be resurrected once again dios by sri suta tato so see here in my experiences they may experience we all go through to this aging man Obama's poorest I that we're we're in the 20s toes faintest we feel great sink in was muy bien and around 25 yeah let's make this Cinco I've experienced this myself your your experience at I saw yo mismo you start noticing some changes instead be able no scab using instead mismo my experience I've gained a few pounds it makes Nancy is with almost poetess libras are not a few several pounds focused on this amen I mean but but it's been insane pretty much the bodies from that point it starts to get old gets to it to a peak there can it set up by a quick point case I can be our man so you're gonna start noticing the the same strength or the that same strength is no longer there or yes as for says the understand he or some appearances in your face make you look a little older honest appearances at saqqara love you Lawson Casey media must be a ho-oh more mature or mass Maduro man and then see here so as we continue here okatee Nando this brother Branham says that the worst part here is a Caleb pure party there is that's god's worse enemy in divine healing okay okay okay okay cell P or n amigo de Dios it's our site is just a Vista and time yes diem PO man because this is where our five senses a kiss on this toaster Cinco Santino's the five senses the human being has the Cinco sent es que tiene una mano starts to get in the way of the things of God in pain se ponen en el camino de las casas de Dios we want to see changes getting most ver los cambios if we have a bruise see the name one more time if we have a broken leg to tenemos own won't be a quebrado we wanna work on it immediately get the most coming out in el immediate Ament even if we feel like we haven't been healed she knows he must come when was C dos anos we start doubting it it's almost out of that and that's why it's the hardest part or the worst enemy of God's if we accept our enemy go Dave Yost and man and there's 10 their symptoms I think Thomas Mann the devil he's been at it for many years eh-oh esto por muchos anos the symptoms is this what catches is most of the time I think the masses clock' simply no stomach at abyss the body aches los loros del cuerpo and many other symptoms yo sing Tomas and it doesn't mean you're not healed but significative state no Asano you've been prayed for see I know rather poor usted so you just have to believe it I'm a Latina que creer the symptoms are still gonna be there listen to my story I want to start eating but the main thing is about believing important esquina que creer man so there's things that are gonna be bothering you whenever causes Calvinists or vara even have to being prayed for this place care or and usted it's a Herrick cs1 dolor de cabeza the headache might be still there for a few more hours African satirist upon asuras despues que induced that's where the trout comes in or something pestle upriver that's where God is looking at you I saw they just lost a meal and oh and you didn't say you trust in me or not aka protests you still it was a feel or no man if you're gonna keep believing she by container a clear or if you're just gonna doubt she was with that man and then and brother branham like I said he goes down to the cell lamanno Brannon by a la Salle's because he breaks it down that for percale Acedo by this man who sandal man and he says he puts an example cancer I see him Rosedale cancer cancer cells la salut as a cancer when you see cancer in the body first ever consider like cuerpo its breast cancer she has cancer they say no when the doctors do their examines their examiner's their images Susan McGinnis they see those cells because it's different from the rest of the body as Vanessa cellulous porque son diferentes de el resto del cuerpo de Ron they don't have the same pattern me small but wrong they don't have this the cells are not the same size as the rest of the body the same as el cuerpo so that's how you know when it's not part of your body Eskimos esta vez que no es parte de su cuerpo it came from somewhere we know the otra parte but it was not originally there but no bi e so these cells versus Ella's when there's divine healing when I study that Divina when somebody prays for you in your heel on the alien or a prosthetic status another automatically the life of those cells goes out automatic Ament a la vida de hacer las salhan amen and then so as we know so now these cells are dead or that's the syllabus is done what does they no longer have any life in them yes but now there's a process where these cells are getting in the future they're gonna change and in futo when I come here is where I'm gonna explain it how brother Branham says it here Oh a speaker come listen mr. Romano Branham he makes it so simple it was it done simply any read any anyone here ever killed a deer or a cow or anything like that I mean a Kia a gamma turbinado una vaca Wawa see sure all right seguro muy bien you wait tonight you hunters out there friends of mine better know who stays esta noche los cazadores que estan aqui you kill the deer and you throw him on the scale tell the boys how much he weighs ESMA Tanana delorean sobre la paz' elacin los muchachos Squanto Pesa watch out we dado in the morning he's gonna be several pounds lighter in a magnet and ravenously resume Miscanthus then worried he was when he was a when a human dies cuanto antes cuando una mano where a the undertaker LM Bassam adore the first thing takes the false teeth in or the an eye the primarily psychology antes Positas oh no ho whatever it is in in there Nene's pasti hosono co-locating ah he takes it out Lusaka because it shrinks or guessing cocky it pushes out because the human body shrinks associate acts pasado por tu cuerpo humano san koke every other flesh shrinks out like carne Cinco the life is gone out of the cell on a la vida es una cellular it begins to move down and shrink yucca means have a higher sink okay so same thing with these cancer cells a cell has the cancer they shrink when the life is pulled out from those cancer cells and Koken con la vida canada yes they shrink so same cocaine for example if you're having a leg pain for example of state in a dollar days you're you're brave poor yeah I don't put a stat now automatically you're feeling much better no mejor so that that process right there at that moment I say momentous a processor is when the tape for the product cancer cell and more precise and let the cancer the life was taken out yeah like on la vida so you're no longer having that same pain they are not in SMS model order but there's more that's gonna go through before you're completely healed but I must give up Assad and his crew states are completamente Salado amen so as the shrinks that happens for 72 hours ok pass a person dose or as this alumina bran the shrinking process a process of the Enco here and after that it starts to swell you know what come in Sarah I mean char see little little dog ear and over they can operate okay see a torpedo our here on the road I can't lie carretera let him lay there in the Sun for about three days they can ie backwards all como por tres dias and watch what happens email okay so said a he's a bigger dog than he ever was they don't para mas grande que antes he swells up say is that right where that case I see man so as we we've seen all some animals gear and over those they must be so only Stanley - kind of a hollow satrapy and so they they do get swollen up see same ancient leaky and Cal or they make him swallow up that's a case a inches so same with these cells that mean Islam is OpenSSL you last Thursday shrimp remoulade same token and after time he called the passer temple they start to swirl up against in pace and I in chair the pain might be coming back now Aloha el dolor estar a gray sandal when then you start doubting he lost at in Posadas are for you by or little tarts by your head open cement was been a su mente my pains coming back I started with some homies Oh Lord what happened I was just prayed for I was feeling fine gay Passover a condo right for me you miss it yeah bein in my healed or not it's another or no so brother branham a mano random that's where it gets tough you know that when you're tested is the case on the hill opponent in a pho man so you might be saying brother Brandon said look at my no venom for the first few days you might feel all wonderful nonetheless Ramirez Diaz horthy owe me siento de maravilla then began to say I'm feeling sicker than I ever was welcome inside they see estoy mass and firm okay antes I'm losing my healing epididymis a knee that just as sure as fate took it out that's he have to come with a fellow Socko unbelievable bring it right back again like incredibly that what I I even wave oh as faith kills it si como la vie la mota unbelievers or exit line can with that the rasa Sita so that's when you that's where that what brother and burn him insane right there commando Brando my king as you start on believing on stead in Pisano creer that's where you you give this spirit a chance to resurrect a something's tell it out opportunities to speed to cater to CT and I'm just gonna read a quick scripture here in Matthew well ever ask you to write in my tell you don't have to go through it all will be quick here you can note it down Lepidus it's gonna be a Matthew 12 I say tomato sauce a 43-45 quantitate rest a quality cinco when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through Dry places seeking rest and finding none Congress p2 in mundo as a little hombre on the poor lugar a circus buscando raposo in no lawyer so he's talking about the spirit here where he's walking through Dry places heat a blonde LSP took a stab wound up or somewhere on the poor lugar a circus so verse 44 there so cuenta cuatro then he said I will return into my house from whence I came out and when he is come he findeth it empty swept and garnished tone says DC revolver a mi casa de donde Sally he cuando viene Lea de su coupe pas de Bouree de ya door nada so by this part here by this moment here with the spirit has returned and esta parte cuando are aggressively spirit oh well god did his part just is a su parte he cleaned you he purified you purified olimpio and now you're a clean vessel alright some vaseline Pio but as we continue on reading here on verse 45 so context Cinco then he goeth he and taketh with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell it there and the last state of this man is worse than the first even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation entonces by atomic Anza go otro CSP to spur or skl entrado smarana e y son Torres las cosas Ultima deltal hombre que la primera hace tambien acontece era esta generation mala so as we see here aquí como vamos now this man is seven times worse or este este hombre es si or brother branham when says that when the good man stands firm in the Word of God the mana running se que cuando el hombre y no se para fear menos then there's no problem it wasn't like programa when that spirit comes back sp2 regresa he won't be able to come in you know that ain't right because you're standing in the Word of God if you're not standing in the Word of God but you stay no stop para la palabra de Dios that spirit is gonna come right in as I speak to Ventura and seven other spirits he's yet the ultra spirit worse than him hey or Cain so that it's a very important s muy importante and we get prayed for on the Orang porno so trust you be faithful that they never fail because if we're not just get worse menos a vampire well the Brennan gives us a perfect example here hemp low he talks about cataracts habla dick las cataratas and he says i'll say the cataract digamos que la catarata what happens when there's a that man guess who says yo kwon do I say hombre if you notice a blind person sees a freaking una persona see a guy I don't know whether I ever have any here now Sehun Tenga alguien aquí yeah cataract eyes con ojos cataratas I'll let them stand for a few minutes like a safari in a pond why okay so that shrinkage begins to take place para que Cinco he meant Oh in easier tell them to come back give us a testimony less the okay well Bank a nose test if we can all my Ohia they can see wonderful they are spoiling Barrett matter of your cementing oh my I just I can see Orion simplemente puedo ver causes yes see what's the matter guess who said a life is gone la vida a Salido the body of the cataract is shrinking a cuerpo de la que trata esta in coach endo say well it'll do the way for a couple days being Laura room party ideas say oh I'm getting so well oh dear on historico Brando me tan bien and after a while it is president temple I began to get a headache commencing on dolor de cabeza they don't feel so good tambien get up the next morning Ilona

rollers got you worked up guess I can't do that de Santo Dolores they must you know don't you don't you believe that no creo is that s oh that's alive the devil si una mentira del diablo if you believe that just ate like a day you'll go right back blind again okay let's see a go but if you just hold on and say mr. Stetson ah Saphira no lord I believe he said no Senor yo creo man and that's them that's that's where you can really hurt the devil there I saw they pose a lasting malady habló because when you use the world because pawn instead use a la palabra and you put it you know in work Ella Pony a trabajar there's nothing the double can do fall upon in accion nada que pasa el Diablo so as we see here like e como vemos we can see Abraham as well vamos time in a bit Abram when his faith when a sufi was so great for tan grande when their angel gave him the promise on the landlady was a promesa as Sara would have a baby guess I ought to be wrong baby and he didn't doubt it you know though maybe the first year I'm Hornet prima Daniel you would answer Posada you feel any different this ain't as
