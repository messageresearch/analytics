[34:01] business
[34:09] God bless you all this morning
[34:24] dear Lord Heavenly Father Celestial we
[34:28] thank you for another day of life
[34:30] and we thank you for letting us be in
[34:33] your house today
[34:37] we ask that you help the speakers
[34:42] that they do and say the right things
[34:56] that they may take something with them
[34:58] from our lessons
[35:02] I asked all these things
[35:08] I'm in
[35:10] uh while you're still standing can you
[35:13] please open your Bibles
[35:16] uh we'll be reading First Corinthians
[35:19] chapter 10 13.
[35:31] once you have it please indicate it by
[35:33] saying amen
[35:44] it reads hello uh no tape no temptation
[35:48] has overtaken you
[35:50] that is not common to man
[35:53] God is faithful and he will not let you
[35:56] be tempted beyond your ability
[35:58] but with the Temptation he will also
[36:01] provide a way of Escape
[36:03] that you may be able to endure it
[36:06] is
[36:21] uh you may take your seats
[36:24] uh before I begin in this case
[36:29] I I want to thank God and my pastor for
[36:33] giving us this opportunity to speak
[36:35] before you
[36:36] okay
[36:42] and normally I would say I'm a bit
[36:44] nervous
[36:47] but gladly with more experience I'm a
[36:51] little bit less experience
[36:57] um
[36:58] and being given the chance to speak to
[37:00] you I want to share a question
[37:06] a question that I've heard and asked
[37:09] myself
[37:15] and I I doubt I'm the only one in this
[37:17] room who's hadn't heard this question
[37:19] before
[37:24] the question is
[37:27] why is it that during our times of
[37:30] hardship
[37:31] when we ask God for help
[37:33] foreign
[37:49] sorry
[37:55] when I asked this question
[37:57] um
[38:01] my my fellow classmates from the Sunday
[38:04] School couldn't answer it
[38:09] but the teacher was able to help me
[38:14] and she told me
[38:17] you know why he's silent
[38:21] um
[38:22] because God is Not only a Creator but
[38:26] he is a teacher maestro
[38:30] we are his students and he is our
[38:33] teacher yeah
[38:35] I'm going to be a bit honest when I
[38:38] heard that I was still a bit confused
[38:42] and then she continued with this
[38:48] a teacher remains silent
[38:52] silencio when the students are doing a
[38:54] test examine
[39:00] God stays silent silencio he doesn't say
[39:04] or do anything
[39:05] because he already gave you what you
[39:08] need okay
[39:11] he gave you everything you could
[39:13] possibly need to overcome the time
[39:18] and when God is handing out tasks he
[39:23] won't give you something that you can't
[39:25] handle
[39:28] just like how a teacher doesn't begin
[39:30] the class with the with the test
[39:32] is
[39:35] you don't take a class in the in the
[39:39] first day they automatically give you a
[39:43] testament no that's not how it works
[39:46] the teacher gives it after
[39:50] you've taken the class after you've
[39:53] studied the material is
[39:58] a teacher doesn't pass out a test to his
[40:01] students
[40:03] until they feel confident that their
[40:06] students can succeed is
[40:12] so if God is the teacher
[40:16] Maestro then what is the devil
[40:20] well the devil's the actual test is
[40:26] remember the test that we've been
[40:28] giveness
[40:30] is a test for Redemption
[40:33] and Redemption is knowing every trick
[40:37] the devil has
[40:39] El Diablo or in other words
[40:42] Redemption is withstanding the devil is
[40:50] and when you're giving it when you give
[40:53] been given a
[40:55] testament you see like a bunch of
[40:58] multiple choice
[41:08] and have you ever wondered uh why are
[41:11] there more answers and questions
[41:17] it's because it to trick you yes
[41:22] and like a testament
[41:26] the devil will question
[41:29] to confuse you
[41:31] so that you picked the wrong answer is
[41:34] correct
[41:40] and the reason why
[41:42] it's because the devil doesn't actually
[41:45] have any power
[41:48] like when you've been given a test does
[41:51] this piece of paper have power over here
[41:55] does it tell you where to go where to
[41:58] sleep
[42:00] no no if you wanted to you could just
[42:03] crumple it up and throw it away
[42:08] so if it has no power over you over me
[42:14] then why do people why do kids and
[42:18] students
[42:23] because they believe it has power over
[42:25] them okay
[42:27] and that's how the devil gets his power
[42:29] yes
[42:31] he gets it because we give it to him
[42:37] when we listen to his lies we allow him
[42:39] to control part of our lives
[42:46] and I promise you this if you give him
[42:49] an inch he'll go for a mile
[42:55] now here's something that some people
[42:57] don't know
[43:02] many people
[43:03] fear the test or fear the devil
[43:08] Diablo but in truth it's the devil who
[43:10] fears you know
[43:14] why else would you think he would be
[43:16] attacking you okay
[43:18] he doesn't attack the week
[43:22] he's he attacks you because he's afraid
[43:26] he's afraid of what you might become
[43:31] remember you are a child of God
[43:34] and if you have the faith
[43:37] you can tame the Seas and you the
[43:40] mountains
[43:44] and he attacks
[43:48] because he doesn't want that to happen
[43:53] but little does he know
[43:56] that those questions those tests is uh
[44:02] uh are actually making us stronger
[44:06] and returning to my first question
[44:11] why God stays silence
[44:14] is because he knows the best way to
[44:17] teach someone
[44:19] is to have that person do it themselves
[44:26] uh
[44:27] if we constantly have someone giving us
[44:29] the answers
[44:32] then we never hope to learn anything
[44:34] this is
[44:36] it's like that kid who has Google's
[44:40] everything on his phone
[44:43] it's like oh I know everything they say
[44:45] no you know but once you take away that
[44:49] phone
[44:52] where am I
[44:53] don't destroy
[44:56] so if you ever wondered
[45:00] if you're not hearing anything from God
[45:04] and that means you're probably still
[45:06] taking the test yeah
[45:11] and like a test you have a timeline
[45:18] and speaking of time limits
[45:24] so I'll pass it along to my brother
[45:28] and God bless you and thank you
[45:34] thank you
[45:50] God bless you
[45:53] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[45:54] once again
[45:56] before anything I'd like to thank my
[45:59] pastor for this opportunity foreign
[46:10] it feels a bit weird being up here again
[46:14] yeah I just got back from out of town
[46:18] I just got back yesterday evening
[46:21] and because the day right before I left
[46:25] I got a message on my phone
[46:30] and it was the
[46:32] list of who was speaking
[46:35] nice thing
[46:38] my name is
[46:41] not getting out of this one this is your
[46:44] yes I reckon now
[46:47] um but God has a reason for everything
[46:48] and
[46:51] um I know the importance of being
[46:54] obediente and I just want to thank the
[46:56] Lord Jesus Christ
[46:58] for keeping my family and I safe
[47:02] and bringing us home safely
[47:06] and so
[47:08] we're going to start
[47:11] um
[47:12] well I want to talk more on Redemption
[47:14] and
[47:17] well we know that Redemption is the
[47:19] action of saving is
[47:30] and we as humans
[47:33] and we were found guilty of sin we must
[47:37] um
[47:38] guilty found guilty of sin see
[47:41] thank you and um you know that's how we
[47:44] were born
[47:45] you know that's how uh it was from the
[47:48] very beginning for us
[47:50] we were born in San Francisco
[47:58] and so
[48:00] but then we have Jesus Jesus who paid
[48:04] the full price at Calvary okay
[48:06] the perfect sacrifice
[48:09] so then we ask ourselves and
[48:16] when we hear the message
[48:19] you know there are a lot of things we
[48:21] learn right
[48:23] then at the same time it seems like we
[48:26] have so much left to learn and
[48:31] um I say that because at times it gets
[48:33] confusing and
[48:37] see man has tried to save himself
[48:41] but it doesn't work that way
[48:46] um
[48:47] execution
[48:51] see the prophet said
[48:53] by grace
[48:55] are you saved through faith and that's
[48:59] the only thing that can save you yes
[49:03] God's grace
[49:06] um by definition
[49:07] is the unearned or unmerited kindness is
[49:11] that
[49:12] um
[49:16] and forgiveness of God
[49:19] so there's not no other just like it
[49:21] right
[49:23] and yet no one else could compare to
[49:25] God's grace
[49:28] you know sometimes we think we're the
[49:30] only ones that have the right to hear
[49:32] this message
[49:36] but he's a god of
[49:38] allos and he cares for each and every
[49:41] one of us
[49:44] you know brother Bernie said
[49:47] God deals with all Races
[49:50] um
[50:03] and we know that the gospel means the
[50:05] good news
[50:08] and with God there is no exception of a
[50:13] personas when he sees us
[50:16] he sees us all on the same level
[50:20] but with the love God has
[50:24] he wants to test us
[50:27] challenge us
[50:28] like my brother was saying we're going
[50:32] to go through tests
[50:33] he's going to use these trials to make
[50:36] us stronger
[50:38] and putting us closer to him
[50:41] closer to the light because
[50:45] when the gospel is in our grass
[50:49] he looks to see what we do with it
[50:53] and you know there have been many things
[50:56] in our path
[50:58] but we can overcome
[51:01] because he's with us no matter what
[51:04] we can overcome these old habits
[51:09] you know the ones that hold us back
[51:12] the problem is to us it's like nature
[51:17] you know brother Branham said
[51:19] you could get a pig
[51:23] you know wash them up
[51:25] clean them up but sooner or later
[51:30] he'll return to that regress because of
[51:34] his nature
[51:36] but we have to learn
[51:39] to accept
[51:41] see there's no way to tell someone to
[51:44] pray so many times
[51:55] you know patches when you're putting on
[51:58] a clothes
[52:00] but the difference here is
[52:03] the clothes is all right
[52:13] so we all have to say we're all guilty
[52:16] there's no such thing
[52:18] because the nature we were born
[52:24] so we have to accept Jesus Christ
[52:27] because he was the son of God
[52:30] and the gospel is
[52:33] and the Apostle Paul says
[52:36] I want you to know that God is a spirit
[52:41] and this is God's gospel yes
[52:44] the same guy left his place to live on
[52:48] this earth
[52:50] when he was born he was born with a
[52:54] purpose
[52:55] God said then and there is if a person
[52:59] accepts me
[53:01] if a person comes to me
[53:04] as soon as he receives
[53:14] and when it's performed
[53:17] the person there who accepts me is
[53:21] their savior Salvador is declared
[53:24] innocent
[53:26] innocente and I was listening to this
[53:28] message
[53:29] uh brother Bernie was speaking
[53:32] and he said
[53:36] that that was the time when he would
[53:39] reach a maturity
[53:42] and the decision
[53:44] with full awareness
[53:47] he would go to Calvary calvario be taken
[53:51] to the cross
[53:53] and right then and there is
[53:57] so the sap of the tree
[54:01] would come out
[54:04] because Jesus is the tree of life
[54:08] and them also being a tree
[54:11] that was the Bible titles
[54:14] um a human being as a tree
[54:17] that the person is a tree
[54:20] we have to stay before the Shadows of
[54:23] the Cross
[54:26] because when Jesus went to Calvary
[54:29] he brought his cross
[54:32] when something casts the shadow
[54:35] you know it shows there's light is
[54:38] and the light of the Gospel evangelo was
[54:42] displaying a shadow of the Cross
[54:45] um
[54:47] and when a person can receive the
[54:50] Revelation
[54:51] Revelation and accept the gospel of God
[54:55] now picture this is the step is still
[54:58] not being poured upon him
[55:02] the shadow is drawing him to that cross
[55:06] and the Apostle Paul says when we accept
[55:10] Jesus Jesus we are justified by faith
[55:14] but the life of the tree
[55:17] is not in us yet
[55:21] because we have to stay in that Shadows
[55:24] the time comes when the cross no longer
[55:29] cast The Shadow
[55:31] because the shadow is there for us to
[55:33] receive shelter
[55:36] and until the Revelation comes down from
[55:39] God
[55:42] um I'm sorry yeah until the Revelation
[55:44] comes down from God
[55:46] is he he want he went to the Cross to
[55:50] surrender his life
[55:52] on our
[55:54] behalfarte but the only way we can be a
[55:57] Church of the Living God
[55:59] is for the life of that tree is
[56:04] to return to every tree in the church
[56:08] so we as trees
[56:11] are are drawn by the cross
[56:14] and we could be justified by faith
[56:17] but you'll never reach Perfection
[56:21] unless that shadow goes away
[56:26] become one with that tree yes
[56:30] and so once we become one
[56:33] the life of that tree
[56:36] returns to that worshiper
[56:39] you know it's it's not a dry lifeless
[56:42] tree
[56:44] it's not under the shadow anymore and
[56:59] [Music]
[57:04] but the only thing is
[57:06] we have to learn to get to that point
[57:10] because we live a Christian Life
[57:13] Christiana but it's not an easy one
[57:17] you know tests will come in our way okay
[57:20] you know many things stand in our way
[57:22] which of course
[57:23] and we never know what to expect from
[57:26] the future
[57:28] so it could sometimes bring fear to us
[57:32] and you know that's the worst thing the
[57:35] devil could put upon us this is
[57:37] you know when we go through a test
[57:41] it's hard to go through it is
[57:44] if there's just fear holding us down
[57:48] Orlando you know it could be caused by
[57:51] both physical
[57:53] and emotional scenarios emotional you
[57:57] know and either or I would always find a
[57:59] way to like sneak up on YouTube
[58:02] you know but the one thing that's always
[58:04] helped me is
[58:06] to counterfeit it's um
[58:09] with confidence
[58:11] you know that's something I've always
[58:13] told my students
[58:17] with confidence
[58:21] basically what that means is
[58:26] you know we can't go on worrying about
[58:29] what will happen you know foreign
[59:13] I want to read a quick scripture
[59:17] and it's going to be Isaiah 41 10. yes
[59:31] it reads like this
[59:34] fear fear thou not for I am with d
[59:38] be not dismayed for I am thy God
[59:41] I will straighten thee
[59:43] yeah I will help thee hey I will uphold
[59:46] thee with the hand with the right hand
[59:49] of my righteousness
[59:54] is
[1:00:02] you know the Bible speaks the truth
[1:00:06] and I believe that with all my heart
[1:00:09] will always be with us
[1:00:11] give us the strength when we need to
[1:00:14] yeah
[1:00:15] like my brother said God won't give us
[1:00:17] something we can't handle
[1:00:21] no matter what you're dealing with
[1:00:26] you know if you don't know like the
[1:00:28] right direction to look to know correct
[1:00:33] because he's the same God okay yesterday
[1:00:37] today and forever
[1:00:42] [Applause]
[1:00:52] God bless you Brothers can you hear me
[1:00:56] no
[1:01:02] yeah you hear me see okay
[1:01:07] God bless you Brothers
[1:01:12] it's a pleasure to be here with you this
[1:01:14] morning
[1:01:18] I think my passion for this opportunity
[1:01:22] and all of you who made the effort
[1:01:24] because
[1:01:26] reward you for that amen amen simplicity
[1:01:39] you can talk about everything
[1:01:42] that we learn about in life
[1:01:45] we can make it so simple but at the same
[1:01:49] time
[1:01:55] we can talk about the same subject with
[1:01:57] just bigger words
[1:01:58] that are saying the same thing
[1:02:04] but maybe it sounds a bit different
[1:02:08] so what I want to say with that this is
[1:02:12] sometimes we could talk about mysteries
[1:02:19] about things in the Bible that maybe we
[1:02:21] don't have full understanding of
[1:02:23] but in the end
[1:02:42] there's some questions I have here he
[1:02:46] is
[1:02:48] gathered with some people
[1:02:51] at work
[1:02:55] that they are very intelligent in what
[1:02:57] they do
[1:02:58] he he always says and sometimes they
[1:03:02] talk about nature
[1:03:05] the laws of nature of gravity
[1:03:09] why they're here
[1:03:14] as they always Point towards science
[1:03:20] that it's a product of a mind
[1:03:25] foreign
[1:04:00] amen Brothers
[1:04:03] DNA
[1:04:09] is
[1:04:11] so many genetic codes
[1:04:21] that is not in its place
[1:04:24] it's a very big problem
[1:04:29] how is it possible that every court is
[1:04:31] in its perfect place
[1:04:33] out of nowhere
[1:04:36] that was created by a mind
[1:04:39] the mind of the Lord Jesus Christ uh
[1:04:43] Almar or if I went to the ocean or the
[1:04:46] sea is and I write a name down in the
[1:04:49] sand
[1:04:49] no no no foreign
[1:04:59] [Music]
[1:05:43] [Music]
[1:05:54] come on
[1:05:57] I'm asking you as a baseball player what
[1:06:00] do you know about yourself
[1:06:04] maybe when he understands I was going to
[1:06:06] say well I have two arms think of those
[1:06:08] Spears I have two feet
[1:06:11] I have to grab the me in one way
[1:06:15] I have to throw the ball with another
[1:06:17] hand Anton says
[1:06:20] in that way in which she explains it is
[1:06:26] that's something how we can explain as
[1:06:28] Christians who we are
[1:06:31] um
[1:06:37] is understanding me
[1:06:39] amen
[1:06:44] where Body Spirit and soul
[1:06:50] and so the body has five channels it is
[1:07:03] which are the five senses
[1:07:08] in those five senses
[1:07:11] reasoning
[1:07:40] how you resolve problems
[1:07:43] and I say that because
[1:07:45] when I heard it
[1:07:51] is
[1:07:53] reasoning is of why I did what I did in
[1:07:56] ton says
[1:08:00] it's more like kindness a minerals amen
[1:08:06] in the soul
[1:08:08] is
[1:08:11] the nature of your spirit
[1:08:15] says that the soul and the spirit are
[1:08:17] binded
[1:08:19] we can't talk about one without talking
[1:08:21] about the other yes
[1:08:25] the deepest part of a man
[1:08:30] we know that our soul is so precious
[1:08:33] foreign
[1:09:01] [Music]
[1:09:03] and sometimes they even fight
[1:09:09] why are they allowing what are they
[1:09:11] allowing in their mind is
[1:09:18] they're taking care of something based
[1:09:20] on their emotions or their feelings
[1:09:28] taking care of our soul is by being
[1:09:30] around the things of God amen amen
[1:09:33] it's going to church
[1:09:35] it's having that Fellowship
[1:09:38] it's praying to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:42] that is feeding our soul
[1:09:45] because if we do none of that is
[1:09:50] the only way we can feed our soul
[1:09:53] then in what condition is our soul going
[1:09:55] to be
[1:09:56] in one way or another
[1:09:59] it has to be fed
[1:10:02] and Thorn says then
[1:10:05] we talk about a seed is
[1:10:12] it could represent a Christian
[1:10:17] we all know that a seed has to be
[1:10:19] planted
[1:10:21] it has to be buried in the dirt
[1:10:26] so I can process its nature
[1:10:33] I think that if we are a seed
[1:10:37] and we're planted in the soil or in the
[1:10:39] earth
[1:10:41] inside there's no longer any light
[1:10:44] maybe we would be scared
[1:10:47] would be alone
[1:10:52] so for a moment we would be confused
[1:10:58] then
[1:11:00] come the sun rays
[1:11:37] Amen brother again are you falling
[1:11:42] and the seed says that it hurts he
[1:11:45] doesn't like this
[1:11:46] is
[1:11:51] and it begins to produce its own fruit
[1:11:56] and it is not always in darkness
[1:11:59] now when you get past the trial is when
[1:12:03] you come out to the light
[1:12:05] you can see where you came from you can
[1:12:08] see the process and you can understand
[1:12:11] amen Brothers
[1:12:17] and then when we understand brothers
[1:12:20] and when God gives us more revelation
[1:12:24] he
[1:12:25] is
[1:12:28] and as we look at certain points in our
[1:12:30] lives
[1:12:33] Altos in high points
[1:12:37] and we look at our high points
[1:12:39] [Music]
[1:12:41] that we always would like to be there
[1:12:45] we like to be closest to God as possible
[1:12:51] who wants to be the best version of
[1:12:53] themselves
[1:12:57] that version is not I can do it all
[1:13:02] that version is in discipline
[1:13:05] it
[1:13:07] has parameters
[1:13:10] that parameter is like a circle
[1:13:14] discipline is the same way
[1:13:16] you know that you have to do something
[1:13:18] you
[1:13:20] can't go too far off because you have to
[1:13:22] stay within those parameters that is
[1:13:25] discipline
[1:13:26] it is a Nago ESO I don't do that I don't
[1:13:30] drink this no full moon I don't smoke
[1:13:33] I don't hang around with these people
[1:13:36] because of your discipline is
[1:13:40] you're focused on a reward
[1:13:45] you know that one of these days
[1:13:48] or Jesus Christ is going to return Yes
[1:13:53] and that's why we wake up each morning
[1:13:56] thanking the Lord Jesus Christ is
[1:14:02] that everything we're going through is
[1:14:04] worth it
[1:14:31] you're placing those parameters
[1:14:43] you're just no longer hanging around
[1:14:45] with those people that are doing you bad
[1:15:25] yet there are things that are going to
[1:15:27] take us with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:15:30] there are things that we don't do
[1:15:43] you can play Stan Brothers
[1:15:50] will be praying Brothers
[1:15:53] if you have a need foreign
[1:16:10] [Music]
