[42:08] God bless you all this
[42:11] morning for me it's an honor to be
[42:15] here we'll be presenting a little
[42:21] one I know here the little one is with
[42:23] their parents
[42:27] I would like for the grandparents to
[42:28] come up as
[42:30] well all four of the
[42:36] grandparents Sarah Elizabeth lope the
[42:40] baby little one's name is Sarah
[42:42] Elizabeth
[42:46] lope she was born the 18 of September of
[42:50] 2024 Antonio Sarah Lopez the parents are
[42:54] Antonio and Sarah Lopez
[42:57] and here are the
[43:00] grandparents on behalf of the mother
[43:02] brother and sister
[43:07] Blan on behalf of the dad our brothers
[43:09] and
[43:11] Lopez as I tell you for me it is an
[43:16] honor here there are four
[43:19] grandparents and I almost consider
[43:21] myself a grandparent as well
[43:28] I would like to make you nervous or make
[43:29] myself
[43:31] nervous but brother Bram preached a
[43:35] message but she titled
[43:39] token there in five letters as brother
[43:41] Bram
[43:44] says in Spanish it's five letters and
[43:46] it's the same in
[43:48] English and there in that message
[43:50] brother presents several children
[43:57] girls and four boys brother Bram
[43:59] presents and here thanks to God it's
[44:01] only one of
[44:04] them brother says the following in one
[44:06] of
[44:10] quotes he says you gave her this child
[44:12] to
[44:16] raise in another one he says you plac
[44:18] them under their
[44:22] care and they know that they are
[44:24] insufficient without your help
[44:30] well I thought I had my Bible in hand
[44:33] but I left it back
[44:36] there but I'll tell you the verses from
[44:39] memory as I
[44:50] have Mark 10 says but when Jesus
[44:53] says not the little children to come
[44:59] for such is the kingdom of
[45:02] God and I like how it says in
[45:07] Proverbs
[45:10] 176
[45:16] Mar Mark is the scripture so we know
[45:18] where we get presenting the children
[45:23] from in Proverbs 176 it says
[45:33] it says the children's children are the
[45:34] crown of old men and the glory of
[45:36] children are their
[45:39] fathers I'm not under appreciating the
[45:41] Spanish
[45:43] version children's children but in
[45:45] English it says children's
[45:47] children that includes grandchildren and
[45:52] granddaughters so in this morning as I
[45:54] told
[45:55] you for me it's a privilege to present
[45:58] this little
[45:59] one the only thing that I can
[46:02] say is may God bless this little
[46:06] one when my grandson was
[46:09] born he now he's now 21 years
[46:12] old all I asked of
[46:15] God I told my
[46:20] son-in-law God give you wisdom to guide
[46:22] this little one and it's the same that I
[46:24] tell you
[46:27] God give you wisdom to guide this little
[46:29] one and she's never
[46:32] alone and neither are
[46:35] you and I said here are the
[46:38] grandparents but I would like the
[46:41] [Music]

[1:00:44] as our brother Eli
[1:00:48] says it is always good to be
[1:00:53] home as we all know we were in the
[1:00:55] country of Peru
[1:00:57] accompanying our
[1:01:01] pastor and something that was
[1:01:04] outstanding the Apostle of the Lord says
[1:01:07] our brother Bernie G
[1:01:10] Garcia he says we are a
[1:01:14] tsunami says we are a
[1:01:16] Revival doesn't matter where you go
[1:01:20] doesn't matter where you are we are a
[1:01:22] Revival
[1:01:26] he says and why do I call it a
[1:01:29] tsunami because a tsunami in
[1:01:32] nature when there's a tsunami in the
[1:01:37] ocean it's to cleanse all the filth
[1:01:40] that's inside of
[1:01:42] it it's to take all the filth to the
[1:01:45] surface and as I tell you
[1:01:48] Brothers we represent a fivefold
[1:01:51] Ministry we move under an
[1:01:54] apostasy and not just any
[1:01:57] Apostle the greatest Apostle of the 21st
[1:02:00] century you want to believe it or
[1:02:03] not his name is the Reverend Bernie G
[1:02:07] gar the founding pastor of Phoenix
[1:02:10] Lighthouse
[1:02:12] [Music]
[1:02:13] Tabernacle don't fail to put emphasis on
[1:02:17] this he is the
[1:02:19] founding this is his
[1:02:22] vision his vision is Phoenix Lighthouse
[1:02:25] Tabernacle he is the
[1:02:27] founder him he did his first
[1:02:30] service he called it in this
[1:02:33] manner and a very peculiar thing he said
[1:02:36] when God gave him the vision he gave him
[1:02:39] a dream as
[1:02:40] well he says and there was a
[1:02:44] lighthouse and there Sparks of fire
[1:02:47] came towards the whole
[1:02:50] world so we are that Revival we are that
[1:02:54] tsunami doesn't matter where we go the
[1:02:57] Lord makes himself manif we don't
[1:03:00] represent
[1:03:01] ourselves the my pastor doesn't
[1:03:03] represent
[1:03:04] him we represent a fivefold Ministry you
[1:03:07] our brother bam
[1:03:09] said that the fivefold ministry is is is
[1:03:14] for the Perfection of the
[1:03:17] Saints and the only perfect
[1:03:19] on is the Bride of the Lord Jesus
[1:03:23] Christ so if you want to recognize a
[1:03:27] or you don't want to recognize it that's
[1:03:29] that's all right but the Apostle Paul
[1:03:34] says it's for the
[1:03:36] Perfection of the
[1:03:38] Saints and you remember brother
[1:03:41] brandham he said if the Paul if Pauls go
[1:03:44] in so will
[1:03:46] mine because I have only
[1:03:49] repeated what Apostle
[1:03:52] Paul what he has said and here is the
[1:03:56] echo he said my
[1:03:59] voice along the prophet of the
[1:04:02] age will continue
[1:04:04] repeating continue being an echo of what
[1:04:08] he
[1:04:09] already in that day there will be no
[1:04:13] exit you won't say that it was ignorance
[1:04:15] before the
[1:04:16] angel he led us a paved path he La us
[1:04:20] thousands of
[1:04:24] books for which we should should live
[1:04:26] according to what he preached not say
[1:04:28] it not say he's my Apostle my
[1:04:32] Apostle live those
[1:04:34] tapes live that
[1:04:37] Ministry represented it with
[1:04:41] dignity don't bring it amongst your
[1:04:43] shoes or kicking it around Lift It Up
[1:04:46] Lift It Up May the whole world
[1:04:50] see who your tutor is who is your
[1:04:53] Apostle who is your pastor
[1:04:56] and your life will
[1:04:59] reflect what you were
[1:05:02] taught we know that we're learning day
[1:05:04] by
[1:05:06] day SC says that faith on faith
[1:05:08] Revelation
[1:05:10] Revelation I with all of my
[1:05:13] heart that we have a mature
[1:05:16] Ministry a mature Ministry that wherever
[1:05:20] we
[1:05:21] go the best effort that's made is to
[1:05:24] lift up
[1:05:27] to lift up the name of Lord J as the
[1:05:29] only
[1:05:31] Savior and
[1:05:34] Lord so now I ask that you please
[1:05:43] stand we're going to open up our
[1:05:45] scriptures to Genesis
[1:05:49] 1:1 in Peru the theme of the convention
[1:05:52] in Peru in in aripa
[1:05:56] is the power of the
[1:05:58] blood how many believe that the blood
[1:06:00] has
[1:06:02] power and the scripture reads the
[1:06:06] following in the beginning God created
[1:06:08] the Heaven and the
[1:06:11] Earth and the Earth was without form and
[1:06:15] void and darkness was upon the face of
[1:06:18] the
[1:06:21] deep and the spirit of God moved upon
[1:06:23] the face of the waters and God
[1:06:26] said let there be
[1:06:29] light and there was
[1:06:32] light let us go to verse
[1:06:35] 11 and God
[1:06:38] said let the Earth bring forth
[1:06:41] grass the herb yielding
[1:06:45] seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit
[1:06:47] after its
[1:06:50] kind who SE in itself upon the
[1:06:54] Earth and it was
[1:06:57] so John
[1:07:04] 129 the next day John see Jesus coming
[1:07:08] unto him and
[1:07:11] [Music]
[1:07:13] says Behold the Lamb of God which taketh
[1:07:16] away the sin of the
[1:07:17] world let us bow our
[1:07:20] heads beloved and good Heavenly

[1:09:06] seats uh good morning Brothers God bless
[1:09:10] you uh first I'd like to thank my pastor
[1:09:13] for allowing me to go on this trip and
[1:09:15] my my dad my Theo and brother Danny
[1:09:19] brother Danny's Pastor team
[1:09:30] I would like to share a little of my
[1:09:32] experience when I
[1:09:36] went it wasn't what I expected it was
[1:09:38] different the brothers the buildings the
[1:09:40] brothers were so loving and kind you can
[1:09:42] just feel how loving they are towards
[1:09:51] everyone the attitude the brothers have
[1:09:54] they are willing to learn and they want
[1:09:55] to hug and talk to you and learn
[1:09:58] whatever they can from
[1:10:03] you it was very scary when I had to go
[1:10:06] up and greet the brothers I didn't think
[1:10:08] I was able to do
[1:10:16] it then I saw the brothers singing and
[1:10:18] dancing in the spirit you you just feel
[1:10:20] how happy they were
[1:10:29] and after the services me my dad and
[1:10:31] brother Danny had took candy for the
[1:10:33] little kids and it felt so rewarding to
[1:10:36] pass out the
[1:10:47] candy everyone wanted the candy even the
[1:10:50] older sisters and it felt bad to tell
[1:10:52] the kids sorry
[1:11:00] but it was a very good experience for me
[1:11:03] and I would like to go
[1:11:07] back and I would like to thank my pastor
[1:11:09] for this
[1:11:12] opportunity God bless you
[1:11:14] [Applause]
[1:11:26] God bless you
[1:11:28] Brothers it's always good to be in the
[1:11:30] house of the
[1:11:31] Lord it's always good to greet
[1:11:34] you and I've said it many
[1:11:38] times it doesn't matter where one wants
[1:11:40] to run
[1:11:42] to when God has a calling for
[1:11:44] you doesn't matter where you run
[1:11:48] to God will bring you back sooner or
[1:11:52] later you have a calling on behalf of
[1:11:54] the Lord
[1:11:57] if it's the Lord that's calling you this
[1:11:59] morning you feel that pull in your
[1:12:03] heart the reason you feel that pull in
[1:12:05] your
[1:12:06] heart is because it's the Lord calling
[1:12:09] you you are
[1:12:12] blessed not just anybody has
[1:12:15] that there are many people that would
[1:12:17] like to have what you
[1:12:20] have we're sitting in Heavenly
[1:12:22] places in Christ Jesus
[1:12:26] he knows what he's
[1:12:28] doing and he calls his
[1:12:30] own when he calls
[1:12:33] you and you submit to that calling or
[1:12:36] you heed to that
[1:12:39] calling that is the best experience that
[1:12:41] you can
[1:12:43] have surrender to the feet of our Lord
[1:12:46] Jesus Christ brother bham
[1:12:49] says he says receiving the Holy
[1:12:52] Spirit he said it's better than any
[1:12:54] amusement part
[1:12:56] now I started thinking at
[1:12:59] myself because me by the the grace of
[1:13:04] God I had the opportunity to take my my
[1:13:06] family to several amusement parks and
[1:13:09] you enjoy
[1:13:11] it I used to ask myself for many years
[1:13:14] when I was a
[1:13:16] child my parents would take us to
[1:13:18] certain
[1:13:19] places for example they would take us to
[1:13:21] the Sea
[1:13:25] and I would ask well what did they get
[1:13:27] out of it what do they have fun if they
[1:13:28] don't get in the ocean or the
[1:13:30] water until I became a
[1:13:32] father and then I understood
[1:13:36] that when you see that you can make your
[1:13:38] children
[1:13:41] happy it's a satisfaction for
[1:13:44] oneself now imagine
[1:13:48] God when he sees that his children are
[1:13:50] receiving of his holy
[1:13:52] spirit you can receive God in your heart
[1:13:57] and you feel that Joy inside of your
[1:13:59] heart and you can ask well what is God
[1:14:03] doing there's my daughter there's my
[1:14:07] son they're receiving of my spirit
[1:14:10] they're receiving from
[1:14:12] me and that is the reason why we go
[1:14:15] out to share with the
[1:14:18] people what God has given
[1:14:20] us and not only us that are
[1:14:23] here but what he's given to each one of
[1:14:26] you the only reason that you're sitting
[1:14:28] here in this
[1:14:30] morning because you have a part of God
[1:14:32] inside of you or else you wouldn't be
[1:14:35] here there's many people that would like
[1:14:37] to be here but they're not
[1:14:39] here because they don't have what you
[1:14:45] have so I think my pastor it's always a
[1:14:47] privilege to travel with him and travel
[1:14:50] with the
[1:14:54] team this time I was very
[1:14:59] happy I say because I don't want to
[1:15:01] break
[1:15:02] down but my brother and my son
[1:15:08] went and forgive me
[1:15:15] brothers and it's the best experience of
[1:15:17] my
[1:15:19] life when you can leave something for
[1:15:22] your children
[1:15:26] now I understand a bit of my
[1:15:28] father when I began
[1:15:32] preaching he came and he told me several
[1:15:36] times he said son I am very proud of
[1:15:41] you and what better gift can you leave
[1:15:44] behind for your
[1:15:46] children when you can see that they
[1:15:48] serve
[1:15:50] God that you project that life to them
[1:15:55] and that's the best that one can
[1:15:58] do the screen appears not on
[1:16:01] see but we went
[1:16:06] to if you could please continue with the
[1:16:10] presentation that right there
[1:16:13] Isa it's a very beautiful
[1:16:17] city it's very picturesque it's very
[1:16:21] Colonial the brothers have gone they can
[1:16:23] appreciate that
[1:16:25] there's a lot of Tourism there there's a
[1:16:28] lot of
[1:16:30] attractions but you know what is the
[1:16:32] main
[1:16:34] attraction is the children of the Lord
[1:16:36] Jesus
[1:16:37] Christ there there is
[1:16:39] seed that serve
[1:16:43] God and that's the reason why we
[1:16:44] continue to go
[1:16:46] there the topic was the power of the
[1:16:49] blood There Is Power in the
[1:16:52] Blood now imagine when you apply that
[1:16:56] blood that blood that blood is building
[1:16:59] and
[1:17:01] Alive the blood of Emanuel does not dry
[1:17:04] up it has
[1:17:06] power power to do
[1:17:08] what power to forgive your
[1:17:12] sins to cleanse everything that you
[1:17:16] have and that blood is still
[1:17:19] alive still alive inside of you when
[1:17:22] you're born again
[1:17:26] that is what God wants for each one of
[1:17:30] us on Thursday I fell our lot to be at
[1:17:33] the local church of our brother
[1:17:35] kpe my brother went up to give a couple
[1:17:37] of
[1:17:39] greetings my brother and his son were
[1:17:41] there as
[1:17:43] well and then our pastor went
[1:17:45] up representing each one of you he was
[1:17:49] happy to be
[1:17:50] there and to have that
[1:17:53] expectation of what God had for
[1:17:56] them do you know this morning God has
[1:17:59] something for
[1:18:00] you only just open up your
[1:18:03] heart only reason we don't receive
[1:18:06] blessings is because we're holding God
[1:18:10] back but if we could only just open up
[1:18:12] our
[1:18:13] hearts and you'll see what he can give
[1:18:17] you this is the pastor and his wife our
[1:18:20] sister Elsa and our brother
[1:18:21] Christal this is in the auditorium
[1:18:26] that they rent each time that I go
[1:18:27] they've been renting it for quite some
[1:18:28] time there's a lot of people fit in
[1:18:32] there and people go searching out and
[1:18:36] knowing that they will
[1:18:39] receive what they have been
[1:18:43] expecting here's theorum before the
[1:18:45] services
[1:18:47] begin here it is at
[1:18:52] night and it f the law of our brother
[1:18:55] Danny to open up on Friday and he did a
[1:18:57] very good
[1:18:58] job and I've already told him
[1:19:02] personally but I believe that one grow
[1:19:04] spiritually one begins to
[1:19:08] mature and begin to display more of what
[1:19:10] God
[1:19:12] has and here is the
[1:19:17] auditorium there's our brother arano
[1:19:19] Marcos Marcos Aran brother Marcos arano
[1:19:23] is Mex he is from Mexico
[1:19:29] yeah he was there as well he also sings
[1:19:30] very
[1:19:34] beautifully and then he's also from
[1:19:36] Gomez which is where I was
[1:19:42] born that's why perhaps I feel affection
[1:19:44] for the sons of
[1:19:46] God but when they're fellow when they're
[1:19:49] fellow people from where you're from you
[1:19:51] feel
[1:19:53] different like our brother says these
[1:19:55] brothers are from C and from St Louis as
[1:19:58] well he says what's going on
[1:20:01] buddy it's an affection when you meet
[1:20:03] somebody that's from where you're
[1:20:06] from and it felt this young man's lot to
[1:20:09] open
[1:20:12] up name a bit
[1:20:17] difficult and our
[1:20:20] brother also fell his lot to
[1:20:23] speak that was Saturday morning this is
[1:20:26] another
[1:20:31] Pastor excuse me for the
[1:20:33] names brother sanago
[1:20:36] Rees then the team was
[1:20:40] ready for what the people were expecting
[1:20:42] or waiting
[1:20:43] for so when people are that in
[1:20:46] expectation so they can receive what
[1:20:48] they
[1:20:49] need likewise where you're in
[1:20:52] expectation you can receive
[1:20:55] what God has for
[1:20:56] you my son went forward to greet the
[1:20:59] people as he said he was very
[1:21:03] nervous and after greeting the
[1:21:06] people the people
[1:21:09] applauded and he's surprised as to why
[1:21:12] they did
[1:21:14] that because when you see somebody stand
[1:21:16] for the
[1:21:17] word it's not easy to
[1:21:19] stand this is the first time that he did
[1:21:22] it and it was full of
[1:21:26] so it's needed on behalf of
[1:21:28] God for you to be able to do
[1:21:31] that and that's why I am proud of
[1:21:36] him and I come and told him I said those
[1:21:38] are the one of the proudest moments of
[1:21:39] my
[1:21:41] life now I can understand each one of
[1:21:44] you that your children have stood behind
[1:21:46] this
[1:21:47] Pulpit you feel so much
[1:21:50] pride you feel so
[1:21:53] happy they're following along in what we
[1:21:56] believe in the Lord Jesus Christ in his
[1:22:00] condescendence sending a prophet and
[1:22:03] then sending us an
[1:22:06] apostle and when you point them towards
[1:22:08] the correct
[1:22:10] line then one feels that
[1:22:14] gratefulness then our brother Danny went
[1:22:16] up and then
[1:22:20] again and our brother my brother went up
[1:22:22] as well
[1:22:23] picture and we fell my lot to speak for
[1:22:25] five minutes and then it was our
[1:22:28] pastor the people were ready
[1:22:32] ready they were all in
[1:22:35] expectation need just a little bit of a
[1:22:39] push to be able to go into that
[1:22:42] spiritual
[1:22:43] Kingdom spiritual realm you need to be
[1:22:46] there but you need a
[1:22:48] preparation when you arrive then you can
[1:22:50] step
[1:22:52] inside says that when Moses
[1:22:57] he says take the sandals off your feet
[1:22:58] because you're stepping on Holy
[1:23:00] Ground he says that he turned into a St
[1:23:02] of an
[1:23:04] ecstasy because it's beyond that curtain
[1:23:06] of
[1:23:07] time there's curtains there's
[1:23:10] doors there's places where there in
[1:23:13] itself and you just open it up you open
[1:23:16] up that
[1:23:18] Dimension enter inside that
[1:23:21] Dimension so then anything can happen
[1:23:25] so easy to Just Surrender to
[1:23:28] yourself enter into that spiritual
[1:23:32] realm the presence of the Lord Jesus
[1:23:34] Christ so then anything can happen but
[1:23:38] it's something so small the prayer
[1:23:41] came the people were
[1:23:43] ready receiving what they
[1:23:46] needed when people come with that
[1:23:51] expectation when they hoping they goow
[1:23:53] onto that garment that our Pastor
[1:23:55] has the prayer cloth that brother BR
[1:23:57] prayed for the people are
[1:24:01] ready that point of contact that they
[1:24:04] need and there they receive what they
[1:24:07] need it's that
[1:24:11] easy then afterwards the people began to
[1:24:13] dance in the
[1:24:14] spirit the people were so
[1:24:17] happy because they received what they
[1:24:20] received and see if they can play the
[1:24:22] video
[1:24:25] the people especially the
[1:24:27] youth I know sometimes one wants to hold
[1:24:31] back but when one finally lets
[1:24:37] loose then you're realizing that you
[1:24:39] reive that which you
[1:24:41] needed so they're
[1:24:44] dancing to thank
[1:24:46] God what he has already done for
[1:24:49] them after they crossed the Red
[1:24:52] Sea and the enemy was left behind
[1:24:56] the scripture says that Miriam got her
[1:24:58] tambourine and they begin to dance in
[1:25:00] the
[1:25:00] spirit and that is the reason why we
[1:25:03] go for them to
[1:25:05] receive what they have to receive may
[1:25:08] the Lord bless you God bless you
[1:25:39] now I can see your bright
[1:25:41] faces your
[1:25:43] smile now you can take your
[1:25:46] seat uh wherever we
[1:25:48] go uh it's always a
[1:25:53] blessing individuals that receive what
[1:25:56] they have need
[1:26:02] ofal The Misfortune
[1:26:06] individuals understand that there is
[1:26:08] someone that
[1:26:10] cares that's what we have to understand
[1:26:14] somebody cares for
[1:26:17] us then I was looking at individuals
[1:26:20] with issues
[1:26:24] an issue that they cannot
[1:26:28] overcome and uh one came to me and he
[1:26:32] had a an
[1:26:34] issue his cell phone and the cell phone
[1:26:38] looking at things he shouldn't look
[1:26:42] at and he wanted
[1:26:45] prayer the
[1:26:47] release a person can actually for one
[1:26:51] second
[1:26:56] God
[1:26:57] will restore your
[1:27:00] life I believe that with all my
[1:27:02] heart we believe a God that heals with
[1:27:07] understanding let me say it again serve
[1:27:10] a
[1:27:11] God that understands what we have need
[1:27:15] of we have
[1:27:18] need the issue is too many of us
[1:27:24] know that we're sick but we don't want
[1:27:28] to
[1:27:29] leave that
[1:27:33] atmosphere it could be drinking it could
[1:27:37] be smoking it can be a religious
[1:27:42] spirit we're all
[1:27:44] affected one by the
[1:27:47] other brother Bernie
[1:27:50] said our
[1:27:52] Apostle your decision today marks your
[1:27:56] destiny for
[1:27:57] tomorrow other words what you do today
[1:28:01] has a great impact on on what will
[1:28:04] happen with you
[1:28:07] tomorrow let me put it this
[1:28:11] way there is nothing under Heaven that
[1:28:15] is
[1:28:16] new we know
[1:28:18] that they had drugs in those
[1:28:21] days
[1:28:23] her had to bring forth of its
[1:28:26] kind don't tell
[1:28:29] me that drug wasn't
[1:28:32] there because opium is a drug and it
[1:28:37] comes from one of the oldest
[1:28:41] countries nothing changes they were
[1:28:47] remedies and people used it for their
[1:28:51] entertainment as they do today
[1:28:58] brother Bram
[1:29:00] said and I'm going to read it to you
[1:29:03] believe this with all my
[1:29:04] heart it's believe from the
[1:29:07] heart oh my soul cry
[1:29:11] Hallelujah to God when I think that God
[1:29:15] put in his church the best he could
[1:29:22] find look at your neighbor say to your
[1:29:26] neighbor I am the best God could
[1:29:33] find don't look at your
[1:29:36] shell look at what's inside your heart
[1:29:41] look at your soul this morning and
[1:29:43] you're the very
[1:29:45] best that God could
[1:29:48] produce we
[1:29:49] are the
[1:29:51] reflection of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:29:57] today God takes his
[1:30:00] children and tests them with an acid
[1:30:06] test then he places them in the body of
[1:30:11] Christ you're going to be tested don't
[1:30:15] come to me and tell me pray for
[1:30:19] me when I know that you're going through
[1:30:23] a test
[1:30:24] I'm going to do what our Apostle did to
[1:30:28] me laughed at
[1:30:30] me when I would tell them that I'm going
[1:30:34] through a hardship in my
[1:30:36] life I can't overcome this can't
[1:30:39] overcome that and he laugh because he
[1:30:42] was aware that it's a test that each
[1:30:45] child of God will be put through a
[1:30:49] test and it's up to us
[1:30:55] to look at that test and say Lord give
[1:31:00] me sufficient
[1:31:02] Grace give me that sufficient Grace to
[1:31:06] pass through
[1:31:08] this
[1:31:10] amen he continues
[1:31:13] on they
[1:31:14] believe they went through
[1:31:17] trials they had the
[1:31:20] experience we we go through trials we
[1:31:23] have experience and the experience that
[1:31:26] you're going to have with the Lord Jesus
[1:31:30] Christ I don't hear aen on that one we
[1:31:33] either want an experience with the Lord
[1:31:35] Jesus
[1:31:36] Christ we need the
[1:31:41] experience you know I I I was reading
[1:31:43] what was on the on the um
[1:31:48] Monitor and the more I read by the
[1:31:52] blood every everything has to do with
[1:31:55] the blood of Jesus
[1:31:58] Christ is it
[1:32:00] dried how can it be dried if I'm born
[1:32:04] again and that blood is running through
[1:32:06] our veins when we're born again have the
[1:32:10] blood of Jesus
[1:32:12] Christ in your
[1:32:15] veins and people are afraid to be born
[1:32:18] again because it's a change we go
[1:32:21] through a change and the change is not
[1:32:24] that you're
[1:32:25] changing God is changing us you can't
[1:32:29] change but he
[1:32:32] surely send someone to help you during
[1:32:35] that
[1:32:36] time you're changing you become a new
[1:32:39] creation a creation with the blood of
[1:32:42] Jesus
[1:32:45] Christ this is what brother Brenham said
[1:32:49] it they are witnesses of his
[1:32:55] they know what they're talking
[1:32:57] about not just an intellectual
[1:33:01] conception not just an intellectual
[1:33:05] conception but they're born
[1:33:07] again with a
[1:33:09] relationship through the blood of Jesus
[1:33:12] Christ has been Grace all this
[1:33:16] period but we need that personal
[1:33:21] relationship every day
[1:33:25] we need to be born
[1:33:27] again then he goes
[1:33:29] on of the precious Holy
[1:33:32] Spirit but they're born again of the
[1:33:35] precious Holy
[1:33:37] Spirit and time
[1:33:39] tested and
[1:33:41] tried until their
[1:33:44] soul are the
[1:33:46] Flint Flint do you know what a flint
[1:33:52] is what's a flint
[1:33:56] we have the
[1:33:58] Flint I hear a
[1:34:00] lot of
[1:34:02] mechanics but you are this morning the
[1:34:05] Dynamics of that
[1:34:09] Flint so I want you to look at your
[1:34:11] neighbor and tell them I am the
[1:34:15] Flint I am the dyamic the dynamic is the
[1:34:20] holy spirit this morning
[1:34:23] in his
[1:34:27] children yes they are are time
[1:34:31] tested they are witnesses of
[1:34:35] his you
[1:34:38] want for us given to
[1:34:43] us prior to them going into the upper
[1:34:48] chamber they had to wait until the power
[1:34:53] the power is the Holy
[1:34:55] Spirit you can't guide
[1:34:57] it it guides
[1:35:00] you you say Amen so if we have an issue
[1:35:04] today if I have a concern today all I
[1:35:08] have to do is open up quit getting in to
[1:35:14] your
[1:35:15] Zone and feeling sorry for yourself that
[1:35:19] nobody understands
[1:35:26] quit thinking that you're the only one
[1:35:29] going through an
[1:35:31] issue I want to understand one thing if
[1:35:36] the Bible tells me something the
[1:35:38] messenger says something if our Apostle
[1:35:40] said something if I tell you something
[1:35:43] you need to follow that
[1:35:47] processing to follow the
[1:35:49] process putting you in danger har way
[1:35:57] so I tell
[1:35:58] you God one day his Mercy will
[1:36:05] stop and there won't be any more
[1:36:09] Mercy while we have mercy while Grace
[1:36:14] while the Holy Spirit is still time this
[1:36:18] world together protecting it it's time
[1:36:21] for us to say
[1:36:24] I want to serve you Lord I don't
[1:36:28] understand everything but I'm
[1:36:30] willing that
[1:36:35] distance there's many sick
[1:36:39] people a lot of sick people there A lot
[1:36:42] of marriage
[1:36:47] problems we prayed for the
[1:36:50] sick then the couples came

[1:36:59] communication if they're not
[1:37:04] talking husband wanted leaving the
[1:37:07] wife husband wanting a new
[1:37:10] wife a younger wife I don't understand
[1:37:13] the
[1:37:15] issue until D do us
[1:37:19] part you
[1:37:21] selected some elected because our
[1:37:26] Apostle
[1:37:28] joined individuals are you aware that
[1:37:32] everyone he joined together are still
[1:37:35] together and those that decided to do
[1:37:38] their
[1:37:39] thing are no longer together matter of
[1:37:43] fact they're not even in the message
[1:37:46] anymore because they failed heal to the
[1:37:50] holy spirit that told them to do
[1:37:53] something
[1:37:55] and they
[1:37:57] refused brother brandham continues he
[1:38:00] cares do you
[1:38:03] care this is
[1:38:07] us there's a lot of issues in the
[1:38:09] church all the way from
[1:38:13] suicidal to wanting to be with your
[1:38:16] friends 24 hours doing what they do
[1:38:24] brother Brenham
[1:38:26] says we believe that doctors help
[1:38:29] people I want you to listen because
[1:38:31] there's a lot of people in the message
[1:38:34] video

[1:39:41] medicine so if you tell me from your
[1:39:44] religious
[1:39:47] spirit God

[1:39:59] trash here's brother Brenham
[1:40:02] saying God heals by medicine he also
[1:40:07] said if you're taking medicine continue
[1:40:10] taking that
[1:40:11] medicine even if you prayed for continue
[1:40:15] taking the
[1:40:18] medicine don't hear a lot of amens

[1:40:25] said not what I think or what another
[1:40:29] brother thinks stay with what the voice
[1:40:33] of God
[1:40:36] said God heals by surgery God heals
[1:40:40] by
[1:40:43] understanding I want you to know who
[1:40:44] said it he said it God heals by
[1:40:50] understanding God heals by love

[1:42:19] Spirit comes from
[1:42:21] Satan that's why
[1:42:25] I'm going to seal
[1:42:27] this I'm G to Jack him
[1:42:30] up why because we're anointed by a
[1:42:34] spirit that controls us and as long as
[1:42:38] we allow it to control us physically
[1:42:43] mentally it will hold us a
[1:42:48] prisoner Let It Go one day just a moment
[1:42:53] and see how good you feel did you feel
[1:42:59] great you know that was his
[1:43:03] character I had him laughing why he
[1:43:06] became Anointed with what with the
[1:43:11] Holy that's what our young people need
[1:43:14] it's for the holy
[1:43:18] spirit so that they can have a
[1:43:21] relationship but it
[1:43:23] starts mommy
[1:43:26] daddy with
[1:43:28] you it's not the Sunday School it's not
[1:43:31] the church starts at
[1:43:38] home he continues and he goes
[1:43:41] on God heals by love God heals by
[1:43:48] prayer God heals
[1:43:51] by God heals by
[1:43:55] God heals whatever Source it
[1:43:59] is God heals
[1:44:02] by you say amen
[1:44:06] amen it's God that heals for he said I'm
[1:44:10] the Lord that Health all thy
[1:44:13] diseases what diseases do we have this
[1:44:15] morning think about it look at
[1:44:21] yourself examine
[1:44:24] what has been going on this
[1:44:28] week because we fell
[1:44:31] once doesn't mean we have to stay
[1:44:34] there if we're born again we're gonna
[1:44:38] fall it's not a picnic we're gonna get
[1:44:41] up we're gonna try
[1:44:48] again if he goes on he says and so all
[1:44:53] all of it should work together all of it
[1:44:56] should work together my prayer your
[1:45:00] prayer by Love by
[1:45:08] understanding and the man in different
[1:45:13] Ministries should work together for
[1:45:18] that I'm sorry Danny said five min we
[1:45:23] still don't understand what that is
[1:45:25] there is a
[1:45:26] head that
[1:45:30] controls that fivefold
[1:45:32] Ministry they can't do whatever they
[1:45:36] want that's the concern I've always had
[1:45:39] too many people want a fivefold Ministry
[1:45:42] and they want to do and say whatever
[1:45:43] they want to do and say it doesn't work
[1:45:46] that
[1:45:49] way all of a sudden
[1:45:53] and the man in different Ministries
[1:45:55] should work together for that are we
[1:45:58] working
[1:46:00] together that is why our Apostle
[1:46:04] said give me 10 men with the Holy Spirit
[1:46:09] I will conquer the
[1:46:12] world let me change it
[1:46:14] now he said it in the beginning toward
[1:46:18] the end he was say give me one
[1:46:21] self-sufficient end individual that I
[1:46:24] will conquer this
[1:46:28] world I don't hear
[1:46:30] amen because we hear what we want to
[1:46:34] hear you know who that is you know what
[1:46:37] church it
[1:46:38] is look at yourself
[1:46:42] say brother Bernie was talking about the
[1:46:49] lighthouse I'm not boasting I'm handing
[1:46:52] you what
[1:46:59] said work together for
[1:47:02] that see now but they don't
[1:47:07] do you know why you don't do
[1:47:10] it
[1:47:13] video I know we get a lot of
[1:47:18] hits Min minen to what
[1:47:24] because you want
[1:47:27] Power everything is based on power too
[1:47:31] many people lost for
[1:47:35] power they think there's money behind it
[1:47:39] there is no
[1:47:43] money but people
[1:47:46] lost for that
[1:47:48] power and I tell you one number one you
[1:47:53] don't believe what I'm saying go to the
[1:47:56] the message brother Bernie preached
[1:47:59] on lusting for
[1:48:02] what that's what the ministry is doing
[1:48:06] today for something they can't
[1:48:11] control let me tell you start lusting
[1:48:14] for power power you're going to receive
[1:48:17] the power Satan gives you
[1:48:21] to listen to what I'm saying what Satan
[1:48:25] gives you to do divide and
[1:48:29] conquer that's the power he gives you
[1:48:32] and as long as he can trap a minister a
[1:48:36] pastor into
[1:48:40] that the people think well that sounds
[1:48:44] good to me that's
[1:48:47] trash God sent us a prophet and that
[1:48:51] Prophet told us
[1:48:54] what we were to do examine ourselves
[1:48:57] daily Die
[1:49:01] daily and then we had by the grace of
[1:49:04] God an apostle who spoke
[1:49:09] Spanish and told us the very same
[1:49:12] thing but you know what we
[1:49:16] are we all fall into a
[1:49:19] trap look at me
[1:49:24] I don't believe like he
[1:49:30] believes yeah right I'm GNA do
[1:49:33] it God gave me a
[1:49:39] Ministry who died and made Montoya King
[1:49:42] go as
[1:49:43] God that's our attitude that same
[1:49:47] attitude will take
[1:49:50] us and separate
[1:49:53] and divide
[1:49:56] you from the Lord Jesus
[1:49:59] Christ I heard brother Brenham say I
[1:50:02] need
[1:50:06] separators the
[1:50:08] separators of the
[1:50:11] world you know what covers the world my
[1:50:16] thinking we got to go back and receive
[1:50:20] the mind of Jesus Christ
[1:50:28] I want you to stand up I'm going to stop
[1:50:32] there I'm long
[1:50:36] wind I just need a little bit of
