[31:27] foreign
[31:29] [Music]
[31:46] [Music]
[32:10] everything is
[32:20] [Music]
[32:31] God bless you brother
[32:35] it's always good to be home once again
[32:39] as you are standing will first of all
[32:41] begin with the prayer
[32:43] Lord Jesus Christ Heavenly Father Lord
[32:47] we thank you
[32:48] for everything you do real men
[32:53] so the everything you do for us day
[32:55] after day
[32:57] things you do for us are so much
[33:02] sometimes we don't even realize it that
[33:04] it's you right now
[33:05] Lord help us to recognize
[33:08] that we just can't be standing here you
[33:10] know foreign
[33:35] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[33:38] amen
[33:43] for anything I greet you in the name of
[33:46] our Lord Jesus Christ
[33:49] happy to see every one of you almost uh
[33:53] we'll be speaking a little bit brother
[33:57] of our missionary trip to Mexico
[34:02] yes
[34:05] photos and second we'll be showing some
[34:08] pictures
[34:10] in the church the lily of the valley
[34:14] foreign
[34:24] [Music]
[34:26] 9 11.
[34:29] the scripture we've been reading is
[34:36] I believe we only take a percentage of
[34:38] what truly is here
[34:41] is God's spoken word
[34:47] I believe we will never completely
[34:49] understand God
[34:51] the scripture reads the following is
[35:07] but Christ being come and high priest of
[35:10] good things to come by a greater and
[35:12] more perfect Tabernacle not made with
[35:13] hands that is to say not of this
[35:16] building
[35:18] foreign
[35:34] once to the holy Place having obtained
[35:36] Eternal Redemption for us
[35:40] is
[35:47] the blood of bulls and of goats and of
[35:50] the ashes of in heifer sprinkling the
[35:52] unclean Sanctified the purifying of the
[35:55] flesh
[36:29] we'll be just speaking to you brethren
[36:31] for a few minutes
[36:35] sharing a little
[37:12] doesn't matter how prepared the preacher
[37:15] may come
[37:16] if the people are not ready
[37:25] of the valley Tabernacle foreign
[38:27] footprints in the sands of time
[38:37] but with his life
[38:41] this is louder than many people
[38:47] the reason we go and go to the
[38:49] convention is
[38:52] the people entering the church
[38:56] I told you the brother were already in
[38:59] expectations
[39:04] there have been some time where they
[39:06] hadn't had Services
[39:33] the thing is just to be in there in the
[39:35] atmosphere
[39:36] and if you get front row seats
[39:41] but if we don't like to get up too early
[39:45] because of traffic
[39:47] then we're gonna have to sit in the back
[40:17] you're only going to receive what you're
[40:19] waiting for
[40:21] talking about
[40:23] yeah
[40:26] but when you stand up here and surrender
[40:28] to God it is God speaking
[40:30] it is God that is inside the man
[40:34] is
[40:37] I like to read the scripture you don't
[40:39] have to stand yes
[40:49] but continue thou in the things which
[40:51] thou has learned and has been assured of
[40:54] the life of whom thou has learned them
[40:56] the reason I say this is
[41:00] because of this quote
[41:04] in the exposition of the seven churches
[41:14] when you prepare for a message that
[41:16] everything comes against you
[41:18] but the messenger says this way
[41:24] in every age we have exactly the same
[41:26] patterns
[41:30] that is why the light comes to some
[41:32] god-given messenger
[41:34] in a certain area
[41:42] and then from that messenger there
[41:45] spreads the light through the ministry
[41:50] of others who have been Faithfully
[41:52] taught
[41:53] now the reason I say this is
[41:56] I don't go over there and give orders I
[42:00] go and learn
[42:02] now there may be things that I may think
[42:06] that maybe it shouldn't be this way
[42:10] we have a leader we have a pastor yes
[42:13] it has been Faithfully instructed by an
[42:17] apostle of God
[42:20] and he's not going to ask what do you
[42:22] think
[42:24] brother Bernie taught me this way
[42:25] foreign
[42:49] from Saltillo
[42:52] you get me from Tama Olympus is
[43:00] stood Faithfully they don't claim
[43:04] anything
[43:05] I believe a true man of God
[43:08] he's going to go looking for his rights
[43:12] forfeits is
[43:31] able to share a little bit of the word
[43:33] uh
[44:27] and we stand next to them and
[44:31] in a convention yeah we're in the
[44:34] convention
[44:36] foreign
[46:18] receiving what they were asking foreign
[46:47] [Music]
[47:30] people got here restoring
[47:34] Homesite whatever you need
[47:37] Paradise
[47:40] you have to be willing to receive it is
[47:50] so many times in the ministry tells us
[48:03] no they're not yours because you're not
[48:06] worthy
[48:07] did you know you are worthy is
[48:17] undeserved gifts
[48:22] what Grace is foreign
[49:30] usted
[49:54] do what you need
[49:57] video
[50:01] is
[50:12] when the people of
[50:14] the Hebrew people
[50:16] crossed over Israel okay foreign
[51:27] it was worth it
[51:29] may God bless you
[51:31] [Applause]
[51:36] God bless you this is
[51:50] my precious brother Branham
[51:53] she said oh yeah can you hear me
[51:56] that voice told him
[52:00] why didn't they cry out to me because
[52:04] on Earth you were a leader and as a
[52:07] leader
[52:08] he will be judged
[52:11] so we have a leader he says the Holy
[52:14] Spirit
[52:18] the Holy Spirit Iglesia in this church
[52:22] is
[52:36] we would greet each other foreign
[53:07] the teacher would say
[53:10] I'm going to tell you one thing
[53:13] I believe that you and you
[53:16] are called to the missionary field
[53:19] and we laughed
[53:21] [Music]
[53:25] and I would think the same thing
[53:28] but time has taken up brother says
[53:52] [Music]
[54:08] I'm unworthy experience
[54:18] maybe sin comes out and takes away my
[54:20] joy
[54:22] and and without lying to me
[54:26] you this that and the other
[54:29] yeah
[54:30] but one time
[54:34] take them to the Cross
[54:37] he was defeated there he has no power
[54:41] the power was yeah always take him there
[54:45] he knows he has no power yes yes
[54:57] you're something great
[54:59] but people say something in it
[55:09] so brother Branham The Voice told him
[55:13] you'll be judged
[55:15] for what you've preached
[55:18] as a leader
[55:50] get home a little bit more
[56:08] [Music]
[56:23] he's a repeater
[56:36] I am the faith
[56:39] you are Las Olas the words
[57:03] without being disorderly
[57:07] as our sons
[57:20] everyone was young
[57:22] they were all young Brothers
[57:39] you think the Army the military wants
[57:40] young men
[57:43] because young men can be instructed
[57:45] an old dog
[57:47] very difficult
[57:55] it's difficult for the new man
[58:02] possessed by the older man
[58:05] the man who reasons
[58:08] the man is always trying to look at your
[58:10] failures your failure
[58:13] his own failures
[58:16] it's always the old man
[58:19] who's trying to go before us
[58:23] I've been born again
[58:45] from the new man
[58:50] oh brother you get the Bible in the
[58:52] message
[59:02] why waste time why waste our time
[59:07] you think I like to leave my wife behind
[59:10] Norman I don't brethren
[59:34] just in that
[59:36] I asked you to pray for me pray for me
[59:40] because things are not easy
[59:42] but if you pray for us
[59:50] these are my words for you
[59:55] [Applause]
[1:00:04] that was fast
[1:00:08] stand up for a minute
[1:00:16] greet your your neighbor
[1:00:20] it's always good to greet each one of us
[1:00:24] because we're not sure when God is gonna
[1:00:28] take us home
[1:00:30] it's good to see faces and bless that
[1:00:36] Persona and take your seats you know as
[1:00:40] the boys were
[1:00:43] were speaking I was just recalling
[1:00:46] what happened in Mexico City Mexico
[1:00:52] there's so many churches in Mexico City
[1:00:57] the ones that stayed faithful
[1:01:00] to brother Bernie or Pastor or Apostle
[1:01:05] we visit
[1:01:10] brother Bernie would say
[1:01:12] uh you should make it a habit
[1:01:16] should be part of you there's three
[1:01:19] services a year
[1:01:24] the second one was Guadalajara
[1:01:27] Guadalajara and the third one was Mexico
[1:01:29] City Mexico
[1:01:32] We are following orders
[1:01:34] of what we were left
[1:01:37] it's not our message
[1:01:39] it's not our way
[1:01:42] it's the way we were taught
[1:01:45] and recalling everything
[1:01:49] uh I felt bad in Mexico City Mexico I
[1:01:53] saw a brother from
[1:01:56] he's up in his 80s
[1:01:59] and I look at the soldiers of tomorrow
[1:02:06] they're awesome
[1:02:09] but they need teaching
[1:02:13] we were able to be taught the correct
[1:02:17] way
[1:02:18] you didn't do it his way
[1:02:21] and I'm not sure how many of you were
[1:02:24] called to his office
[1:02:30] critical
[1:02:37] positively
[1:02:40] uh your your sermon
[1:02:42] and the reason he did
[1:02:45] is because sometimes we felt too big for
[1:02:49] our britches
[1:02:50] in other words
[1:02:52] we thought we were it and
[1:02:57] that's not the way it is
[1:02:59] he taught us to Humble ourselves
[1:03:02] in such a way that I recall that I've
[1:03:06] stated from this Pulpit
[1:03:08] I went 14 years without preaching yeah
[1:03:17] that the ministry is not all about
[1:03:20] preaching
[1:03:22] the easiest thing to do is
[1:03:27] the hardest thing to do
[1:03:31] is the administration Administration
[1:03:34] it's the hardest thing
[1:03:37] that all churches have
[1:03:40] great preachers come out
[1:03:42] the administration of the church is not
[1:03:46] there
[1:03:47] and we were taught Administration 101.
[1:03:51] Pablo
[1:03:58] Garcia Jr Garcia Jr a lot of times we
[1:04:02] leave the junior off
[1:04:15] Garcia Jr
[1:04:20] then I started looking at what we're
[1:04:22] doing in the mission field
[1:04:25] not everybody was called foreign
[1:04:35] [Applause]
[1:05:19] foreign
[1:05:29] has to be
[1:05:30] born again
[1:05:37] the pastor El Pastor has to be born
[1:05:39] again through those three processes
[1:05:43] everyone that has a role of a leader
[1:05:47] pass through those three processes
[1:05:51] you got to be justified
[1:05:56] then born again
[1:05:59] how many times should I buy should I be
[1:06:02] born again
[1:06:03] why do I have to be born again
[1:06:09] if God called me to preach
[1:06:12] has he Vindicated
[1:06:20] let's go back in the Book of Revelation
[1:06:24] because we all should know it
[1:06:28] the whole book of Revelations
[1:06:32] was written
[1:06:34] by foreign
[1:06:46] [Applause]
[1:07:00] everyone that was healed God God knew
[1:07:03] this person had to be there
[1:07:07] a little old lady
[1:07:09] wanting to hug me
[1:07:13] thinking negatively
[1:07:17] what will the people say
[1:07:20] let me tell you
[1:07:22] that could have been my mother
[1:07:26] she must have been 80 some years old
[1:07:37] then I prayed for her
[1:07:40] and what she wanted was just to touch me
[1:07:46] my hands on that day
[1:07:51] my voice not my voice that's what we
[1:07:55] seem to like
[1:07:56] Revelation that's when the Holy Spirit
[1:07:59] comes down
[1:08:09] it's the miracle from God
[1:08:14] that is pouring out
[1:08:21] so we say this Angel as he wrote
[1:08:26] who was the the person writing
[1:08:30] what was his name
[1:08:33] John one and John wrote everything
[1:08:37] he saw everything
[1:08:41] and then all of a sudden it's like
[1:08:44] everyone else
[1:08:47] this is what happens
[1:08:49] people try to worship you
[1:08:52] I've had people trying to worship me
[1:08:55] first thing I do is remember
[1:08:58] you worship God and God only Allah
[1:09:04] foreign
[1:09:38] foreign
[1:10:15] worship God Only
[1:10:18] God is a god a
[1:10:23] jealously to honor and respected
[1:10:28] our Lord Jesus Christ This is why people
[1:10:32] aren't successful
[1:10:34] the first thing they start to do they
[1:10:37] worship the wrong things
[1:10:47] I don't see his wife she's probably in
[1:10:49] Sunday school somewhere but could you
[1:10:51] imagine is
[1:10:53] worshiping
[1:10:57] says how many of you worship your
[1:10:59] husband Hermanas
[1:11:03] thank you gracias we shouldn't worship
[1:11:08] I know you say I've been part of a group
[1:11:12] that I've heard sisters
[1:11:16] he's my Lord
[1:11:18] yes you know yes I believe all husbands
[1:11:24] are there Lords
[1:11:31] on Spanish in Spanish
[1:11:36] that's not what I said
[1:11:38] with a little owl Escola
[1:11:44] please
[1:11:45] this is what happens let's try to say
[1:11:49] words that I didn't say
[1:11:51] the ones in Colombia because in Colombia
[1:11:55] the ones in Iowa the ones in Mexico
[1:11:58] wherever we have missions
[1:12:01] why you said it I didn't say it my
[1:12:04] interpreter said that's why I have to
[1:12:07] correct
[1:12:09] what is said thank you I like to listen
[1:12:11] to each word
[1:12:20] here's the Lord
[1:12:28] all right so notice Lord I can accept
[1:12:30] that but put the little L not the s
[1:12:35] and I know in Spanish
[1:12:41] you should do everything foreign
[1:12:55] but you have the Lord of lords
[1:12:59] always remember that
[1:13:04] oh I'm sorry put it on uh here's Danny
[1:13:07] every time I look at Danny you tell
[1:13:10] myself almost there
[1:13:13] so when I see Danny from the middle
[1:13:15] Danny first thing I do is look at his
[1:13:18] brand new truck
[1:13:21] it's a nice looking older truck right uh
[1:13:24] that's I mean
[1:13:26] type truck
[1:13:29] do you imagine can we worship a car
[1:13:35] yeah see
[1:13:37] very it's easy to worship something
[1:13:40] do men worship women
[1:13:45] when the angel said
[1:13:47] don't worship me worship him we need to
[1:13:53] start putting that in our vocabulary
[1:13:57] Worship the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:14:03] and that's what the angel said yes
[1:14:06] we see many people today
[1:14:09] we understand that the angel of the
[1:14:12] church is the pasture
[1:14:16] the one we worship
[1:14:20] is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:14:31] is that what he said
[1:14:33] what did he say open to all the world
[1:14:38] that's why I said not everyone was
[1:14:40] called foreign
[1:14:42] [Applause]
[1:14:48] we go to South America
[1:14:52] foreign
[1:15:08] to go from hotel to hotel
[1:15:11] you have Services
[1:15:14] because the law is after you
[1:15:17] because in communist countries you
[1:15:20] cannot preach religions
[1:15:26] what religion are you
[1:15:29] and they have it and I put it
[1:15:34] but the reason they want to know
[1:15:36] what you're doing in their country is
[1:15:40] because they'll go to that church
[1:15:42] they'll go to that group they'll
[1:15:46] assault
[1:15:48] the pastor in the front they'll take his
[1:15:51] money they'll take your money
[1:15:56] that's why they want to know what are
[1:15:59] you doing in a communist country
[1:16:02] so we were told go to all the world he
[1:16:06] preach the gospel demonstrate
[1:16:10] your ability
[1:16:13] to give advice
[1:16:16] is that what it says
[1:16:17] no no what does it say
[1:16:22] go into all the world
[1:16:27] the power of the Holy Spirit foreign
[1:16:52] somebody said I'll be judged again what
[1:16:55] I preachers
[1:17:10] you will be judged for what you did with
[1:17:15] the Holy Spirit that's why we testify
[1:17:20] we testify what God has done in our life
[1:17:24] not what you've done in your life
[1:17:27] what God has done in your life
[1:17:36] I
[1:17:38] have two pages of notes
[1:17:42] but when you become a new creature
[1:17:45] when you become a new creature raise
[1:17:47] your hand and you become a new creature
[1:17:51] we should all have our hands up changed
[1:18:01] yes see what happens if I revert back
[1:18:08] to what I was
[1:18:11] because I started hanging around with
[1:18:13] the wrong group
[1:18:16] of having the anointing of the Holy
[1:18:18] Spirit
[1:18:22] anointing of the people I hang around
[1:18:24] with
[1:18:30] somebody played a joke on me
[1:18:33] I'm glad nobody was here
[1:18:36] when they played it I was in a country
[1:18:42] I know the language
[1:18:45] this was maybe
[1:18:48] 2005.00 well
[1:18:51] Pastor hands me a bottle
[1:18:55] I might as well pick a new today
[1:19:01] hands me a bottle yeah
[1:19:05] and the two that understood English
[1:19:10] did not say anything to me
[1:19:13] here's the bottle
[1:19:17] I'm not going to tell you what it is but
[1:19:19] I want you to know what to drink Thomas
[1:19:23] they opened it
[1:19:27] did you take a drink
[1:19:29] no you're supposed to
[1:19:32] well I didn't do that you know
[1:19:35] Something Told Me
[1:19:39] don't drink it

[1:20:27] Thanksgiving is right around the corner
[1:20:31] right around the corner have a little
[1:20:33] bit of wine
[1:20:35] well
[1:20:39] it turned out resulta that all of a
[1:20:43] sudden I'm a always have questions
[1:20:45] I said brother what is it
[1:20:52] typical beer of the country
[1:20:57] I looked at the two brothers
[1:20:59] and I said Payback
[1:21:04] they wanted to see if I was going to
[1:21:06] drink beer
[1:21:08] do you think that's right
[1:21:10] do you think that's a good joke
[1:21:20] it's real it's real
[1:21:23] and no matter what you do it's going to
[1:21:26] be a country that's what they believe
[1:21:31] just so you know Argentina is known
[1:21:34] Argentina that certain pastors would
[1:21:37] drink a lot of wine
[1:21:43] so I told them one and one is
[1:21:46] I tell black is black white is white
[1:21:50] I believe he left the message after I
[1:21:53] told him
[1:21:58] every time I go to Argentina he's not
[1:22:01] there let's go back to the brothers
[1:22:03] because he heard the truth like I said
[1:22:07] black is black white is white
[1:22:10] and if you ever do this again
[1:22:15] you're asking for problems
[1:22:19] please it's no joke
[1:22:26] so then we say thank you we see that we
[1:22:29] testify
[1:22:31] and the devil is good to do one thing
[1:22:34] I'm testifying that God is
[1:22:43] just raise your hand
[1:22:46] God heals yosanna
[1:22:50] has to accept
[1:22:56] to accept it
[1:22:59] foreign
[1:23:04] [Applause]
[1:23:10] [Applause]
[1:23:36] things about this message
[1:23:38] business talking about it
[1:23:41] that's what gets this ministry in in the
[1:23:44] problems
[1:23:46] we shouldn't do it didn't called you to
[1:23:50] do it selected
[1:23:58] so brother Brennan said I close with
[1:24:01] this

[1:24:19] lighthouse
[1:24:25] raise this church is to be a light house
[1:24:33] to give out light
[1:24:36] not Darkness

[1:24:41] encouraging words
[1:24:44] give out what you have the faith you
[1:24:48] have to give it to someone else give
[1:24:52] someone else a blessing
[1:24:54] it goes on to say
[1:24:58] God raised the church to be a lighthouse
[1:25:10] to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:25:13] [Applause]
[1:25:19] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:25:29] the only one that heals is the Lord
[1:25:31] Jesus Christ
[1:25:36] God the Healer
[1:25:42] to let his powers
[1:26:08] you can't say that to brother way
[1:26:13] he went to Phoenix Tabernacle one day
[1:26:15] and gave his testimony
[1:26:17] he's the older man that
[1:26:21] in church

[1:27:43] Bible sentimente preach the Full Gospel
[1:27:48] manifested
[1:27:51] and you're gonna manifestation
[1:27:57] but we begin
[1:27:59] to creep in and let down the bars
[1:28:06] we allow sin back into the church
[1:28:09] it's like Israel Israel they wanted a
[1:28:13] big guy
[1:28:16] they didn't want to be governed by the
[1:28:19] Holy Spirit
[1:28:20] they wanted a man and they chose the
[1:28:24] wrong one they told Saul to be their
[1:28:27] leader that's not what God wanted
[1:28:31] but it would be it became the permissive
[1:28:35] will of God
[1:28:39] that's all it's a soul you can't tell me
[1:28:42] we all know the stories
[1:28:48] we let down the bars
[1:28:50] we as a family
[1:28:54] well the pastor's wife does it I can do
[1:28:57] it
[1:29:01] if the Deacon's wife does it what can I
[1:29:04] do it

[1:29:11] we allow sin back into the church
[1:29:17] let me tell you just so you know but
[1:29:20] like I said I won't let it
[1:29:23] don't care if you leave or not
