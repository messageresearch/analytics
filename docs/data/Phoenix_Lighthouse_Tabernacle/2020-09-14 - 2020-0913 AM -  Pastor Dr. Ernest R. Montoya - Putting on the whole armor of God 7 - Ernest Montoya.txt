redeemed by the blood of the lamb members of phoenix lighthouse tabernacle presented wishing that each is well and is enjoying your health we understand that we are living in times that were prophesied in the sacred scriptures difficult times that have affected our daily life as we know it foreign the pandemic that has hit the entire world has caused preventive measures to be taken to maintain the health of each member of this church for whom i am responsible these measures have been based on the statistics and regulations issued by the state government in the same way we have kept abreast of the local and national news medias locales we have heard that the cases of infected individuals have decreased but we have also heard that certain numbers have been manipulated and not all the new cases that have emerged have been reported seeing the numbers of infections increasing and hearing so much contradictory information is the reason why i have kept the church closed for all this time is always keeping in mind the welfare of each and every one of you some of you might ask when are we going to go back to church all i can say for now is don't dismay and stay true everything is in the hands of god we will keep you informed and when the day comes it will be a pleasure to announce the date that we can return to church to worship the sweet name of the lord jesus christ

make sure and i say whatever we do [Music] to to do anything but to tell you what's in my heart what god has placed in my heart so we need to go back and see what we are doing [Music] we're ushering in into our special meetings which is next week has strategies for us i want to mean more strategies lord jesus christ than anything else what i need to tell you and then it destroys it's all a mind matter there's a rage that goes on it's a spiritual rage that's here let me say it over again it's a spiritual race it's so full of rage the battle is raging to destroy us destroy our family destroy the church destroy a loved one destroy the very message that we believe our heavenly father we're grateful for this blessing this morning we thank you because you've been good to us you've given us a message that we could be proud of you gave but this battle rages on trying to destroy us but all we have the only weapon we need is your word this morning we're so happy for that we ask that you bless each person bless your families bless their efforts in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen if we'll go to our scripture again our our title has always been has been for the last two months putting on the hormone of god you know and i forgot my little but if you can help me in the back we're gonna go to uh ephesians 6 11 and then i'll go back to the mama and it reads as follows put on the whole armor of god that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in in the evil day and having done all to stand up i just wanted to always make sure that we're christians we are christians inner interdenominational faith we believe that our conduct should be based on the word of god everything should be written here everything was voiced by our prophet william william it was echoed by apostle because we are under grace that took jesus out of the history book the word of god church order and doctrine that's what we even taught the new generation [Music] and the first quote i want to read church order and conduct brother branham preach this and i i want you to know and the reason i want you to know why i don't come up here i want to start correcting those little things that have been taught please forgive me i'm aware bernie even our prophet not the person that comes behind this pulpit what brother branham stated the concerns that were happening in the tabernacle lat brother capps or whoever is leading song services and have a song leader no matter who it is no important don't let them stand up and say or carry on like they were a preacher this is god's pulpit it should be revered as a pulpit of god the ministry that comes up here but when we come up everybody wants to say something brother if you're praying for the petition but throughout the years we don't follow that no somebody will come up a message that's it goes on continue see let them stand up there and lead songs that's their business it's the pastor's business to preach songs the song leader leads and they have a summary and it's about 20 minutes and they say everything from everything and they go on we are a disciplined church is found in the bible how we actually not to feel sorry for myself i'm not a wimp no no i'm a soldier of god but if i'm not careful [Music] you get caught up in the daily life the struggles life is hard that's why we're being judged now the bride of jesus christ today but a day will come who doesn't think life is rough if you don't think life is rough share with me how you do it mothers you put your pants on the way i do use the way you do when i do someone else something we all have scars are right here because he's our i want you to go to slide six please just to say it quickly how many how many of us and i said it believe all the word of god if you believe the whole word of god either you're with me and we are believers of this world it's a plan of god it's just like a football game mexican football or american football footballer the soldiers the players they know their position is that right all sports positions they have a game plan as we continue how it is in this plan of god how it is if we're not careful i want to read a quote you know there's just haven't felt like that in a long time then before you know it she is young i'm trying to look young or vice versa because he's young okay let's corbin what woman is trying to look young have you noticed that i guess i've been watching too much tv television um soap operas but this flesh is getting old but one day it will be young again that's what i believe the beauty of my wife yes it is still there i want to study but i gotta look beyond our ages and have a revelation daughter of god foreign amen amen so this is what brother brenham said the battle raged when eve opened up her mind to listen to her reasoning and that's the flu it come in canal that's the flu it came in strata i remember what you did to me last week in that channel stays there that's why we can't have the victory that's why i can't overcome drugs i can't overcome liquors on a product of the flesh because i open up that channel i heard him say or temptation didn't i tell you to go to work if you don't do this i'm gonna go tell brother montoya everything goes here and the poor guy is back [Applause] because of the channel what we have opened up it's real israel these are strategies that the devil uses against us as long as we're in flesh and blood amends on that one that's a lot her reasoning she in her soul she reasoned against her and we know the greatest battle was fought here and today it's being fought here through this channel far better than her own husband or far better than his own wife don't fall asleep on me no i'll continue on we have been long-winded with this because it's so important this is life or death this is the strategy it's killing us today he was beautiful handsome far better than her own husband he was the most subtle of all the beasts in the field and he was probably a finer man than her husband all right uh stand up chewie i'm sorry chewie there's a big guy right there all right just let your massage go there's a young man right handsome looking tall alto but here is the serpent a foot taller than what he is oh this guy had braids nine ten foot tall the sps big hands manos grandes pearly white teeth didn't walk like this look at me now i see thank you the serpent was far better than adam that's what the bible teaches there it is how you stop he looked like a great masculine be standing there how great he was and he was trying to tell her what a great thing it was this new revelation that this serpent had he was trying to get her to see it masculine big man and he kept on enticing oh that guy is better than this guys what man is doing what the woman is doing or the young person when i get married it's going to have to look like i want her to look like this she doesn't look like that she knows how are you gonna go find me samson did the same thing but look at what he's saying the first thing she did she opened up her mind what's the mind what did brother branham teach us what the mind is but here it is and he was trying to tell her how great it was and the first thing she did she opens up her mind and when she did and when she did human reasoning caught it that's why we reason today well if i put a bigger ceiling i'm going to be able to do more with it then the reasoning comes who's going to do it all he has to do he gets a pick in the shovel and he digs down here then he just puts a thing a little higher or oh you get ernie montoya he gets a grenade he blows up all this then we start over the bible tells me i reason with god sickness [Applause] m amen amen listen why but okay wouldn't it be a thrill how many of you had a thrill seriously i've had thrills in my life i've gone goes up 250 feet from the front and the bad thing i got a cramp and my crap was in this leg and it was going up like this and when it was coming down i sat down real fast but it was a thrill of my life all those amusement parks get on the rods you get on those ones that superman sounds like a bullet goes up and comes back down you'll get the thrill of your life but there's other ways to get a thrill and this is what satan was telling this lady the serpent was telling this lady life is all about not only the woman getting the man too stop playing games no he has the man where he wants some woman with a lovely little husband find some great big masculine man this man will try to open up the reasoning you know i've seen some good people get divorces in my family beautiful sisters i have but one thing i do know it's biblical it's biblical been happening for a long time yes or no don't fall asleep on me don't worry i don't give names out you know this man will try to open up the reasoning your husband never told you this one your eyes are so bright they light up my heart your lips are so sweet that when i hear you speak of life i see heaven your middle cielo [Music] but that guy is good at what he does yes or no think about it remember that's satan is he working on you right now nobody's checking them out nine of starbucindo begins to move through but god gives but give god's word the first place you can't sin hallelujah here it is this is coming fresh new a man cannot sin until first he casts aside god's word he cannot even sin that's disbelief i don't have a problem with older people they're and you can tell them over and over and over and over and over don't go out don't be on the streets at midnight two o'clock okay you're going to work that's different amen amen and the spiritual war rages on as i said here something that won't go away something we should i accept christ that was a crisis or have a what am i supposed to do it's a raging battle right here for you to make a choice now here's a man of god i believe with all my heart that has the holy spirit all of a sudden he's diabetic does he still have the holy spirit full of god's goodness but on the outside a lot of sickness a lot of worry dying every second you're the brother branham outside of the pulpit of how many of you think brother branham had problems or let me put it this way how many of you believe he didn't have any problems he had a lot of problems he was a prophet to the whole world he had problems matter of fact he ran from his problems got off the field he left the field because of people and it's still going on people leave the message i'm not a reformer we're not reformers don't want to be a reformer i can just tell you what he said but on sunday check him out i'm sorry yes uh he's dirty looked like he came from work we dress the best we can honoring our father that's our example you don't see him with a mohawk haircut you don't see him with his funny sideburns or you know 101 how many of you know how many of you have gone to college or where's your hands i know you've gone to college you're well worms we've got some problems here in this church all right thank you 101 what does that mean well 101 means you know how they have ap calculus ap grammar so because it's so simple you don't have to think about it no wow that's simple just what the serpent said to eve makes it so simple everybody can understand this that's 101 it's the art of planning and directing an overall military operation overall military operations and the reason i stopped there we're the military we have operations we gotta go to all countries you're having a good time what does satan do your being's burned to frijoles before you know it you're preoccupied yes thinking something different who plays today the nba do they play today los angeles lakers does anyone know the lakers are going to play today i don't know who's winning who's playing but they i think they play today i don't know who they play today who put it on uh what's that where you record how do you a recorder tv on record no i don't don't have cable uh the chief was playing today all right the movement in a war or a battle i'm gonna go home after service he's already stopped 50 goals this year why i say that because brother garcia used to say that a lot wants to take it away whatever he can do he wants to take his word god's word away from you god wants you to have faith satan wants you to reason satanic god wants you to love one another satan wants you to fight one another a tactic is a strategy by military operations i don't know if you remember felipe felipe but planes used to fly in vietnam they have dropped leaflets little leaflets and they would say if you come over to this side we'll give you food we'll forgive you and they dropped them millions of them a strategy oh i'm sorry we don't do that in the message do we do that danny i'm sorry do they do that to you at your uh barber shop this poster can i leave this poster strategies to bring people god strategies and strategies [Music] and i surely can prove it at night i'm sorry arizona it's so hot here what does the sky look like when the sun is going i was thinking about the beans again [Music] the kindle you have is not new tablets are not needed the big watch danny has like that is not you know yes or no um amen amen brother branham said this is very simple see his attack watch listen close that's his attack there can you see the greatest battle ever fought there's two forces two armies and what is satan's weapon against you whenever to write the voice of god i'm going to pay for the books english and spanish because we just don't know the greatest battle ever fighting the battle yeah so that means you need to read that book satan's weapon against you is to try to get you to disbelieve god's weapon oh you know it's my eyesight i can't see the way it is let me read that over if he can get you to disbelieve your weapon is equivalent or if he can get you to disbelieve your weapon is equivalent if he can get you to believe that your weapon is not strong enough see right thank you sisters i you do a far better job than the brothers smells better not saying the brothers don't do it right yes he wants to disarm us satan will disarm you like a dinosaur age don't believe it do you really want your wife to look like that i don't know who told me yesterday a lady's car broke down wanted to use somebody's phone says the husband says so where are you he's throwing things in your ear how many have you ever listened to something a lie and you guys are good somewhere else every time i go in the mission field somebody tells me something so you know what i said don't want to hear it no kiddo don't want to hear it because everybody has something to say and we listen to it yes can't worry about him i have to worry about this person once this person is right and i can help this and i can help that person but i gotta do it here first i'm almost done i'm gonna is everybody has anyone ever heard something about you that was a liar that i was real like completed no no i want the guy that's tall not even my dreams you don't look like him you don't sound like him i used to just say bend over people that didn't go to after-school detention i want you to sit down my son dave is not here so i can talk about it you know david was bad when he was young so he knew i had a swarm in my house i think the only one i never swatted was james he never did anything wrong james but david he knew i had to swat him so he had to come in because he had pillows inside of his pants i mean they were hanging you know so i said okay okay i didn't hit him hard but i did give him a swipe because my word so that's why i'm saying satan will disarm you take away god's word you cannot sin until you leave his words you know what i just want to read something i'm not going to read this i'll wait till uh two weeks but i want to read what a soldier is well
