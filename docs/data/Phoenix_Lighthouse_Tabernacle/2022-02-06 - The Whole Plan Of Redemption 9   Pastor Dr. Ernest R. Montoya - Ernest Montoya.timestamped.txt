[41:07] 11 it reads as follows
[41:11] we're still with the whole plan of
[41:13] redemption we'll never get out of this
[41:15] i'm not sure when
[41:17] i really don't know
[41:31] so hopefully we won't take three years
[41:35] but i do want to spend some time
[41:39] um
[41:40] again our our thought was carriers of
[41:43] the hour
[41:47] and the bible reads as follows
[41:50] but christ being come and high priest of
[41:53] good things to come
[41:55] by a greater and more perfect tabernacle
[41:59] not made with hands that is to say
[42:01] not of this building
[42:14] neither by the blood of goats
[42:16] and calves
[42:17] but
[42:18] but by his own blood he entered in once
[42:21] into the holy place
[42:23] having obtained eternal redemption for
[42:26] us
[42:36] for if the blood of bulls
[42:39] and of goats
[42:40] and the ashes of of and heifer
[42:43] sprinkling
[42:44] the unclean
[42:46] sanctifieth to the purifying of the
[42:49] flesh
[42:55] scientifically
[43:00] how much more shall the blood of christ
[43:03] who through the eternal spirit offered
[43:06] himself
[43:07] without spot to god
[43:10] purge your conscience from dead works to
[43:12] serve the living god juan tomas la
[43:14] sangre de cristo en el cual mediante el
[43:16] espirito turno
[43:19] si manchadios
[43:20] imperables tres conciencias muertos
[43:22] parque silva
[43:26] take your seats
[43:29] again
[43:30] carriers of the hour
[43:35] and when i was
[43:39] meditating
[43:41] uh
[43:42] last week and this week
[43:44] basically last week
[43:48] i like to answer my own questions
[43:51] i had a question
[43:56] and i'm gonna read it
[43:59] so that you'll know my answer
[44:04] but my answer or my question was
[44:09] who sold the human race
[44:11] to sin into sin
[44:17] again
[44:20] who can
[44:34] this world is this body
[44:37] is sinful especially
[44:41] it's hybrid it's ibrito
[44:44] so i need to know
[44:46] who sold it
[44:48] there's only two people
[45:03] all right let's start
[45:05] one or two
[45:07] it's one or the other
[45:10] it can be a tricky question
[45:15] but i'm not i don't want to
[45:29] you know that is a good
[45:37] so let's see what brother branham said
[45:41] think about it

[55:07] we will pass to the other side
[55:10] blessed be the name of the lord

[58:35] if i was to define it
[58:38] if we were to define it
[58:40] what the will of man is
[58:42] it's human freedom
[58:46] it's human freedom
[58:48] if you
[59:09] the will of man has human freedom

[1:14:39] of something else physical or
[1:14:40] spiritually
[1:14:55] our hands should be up
[1:14:59] we're not the christ

[1:15:26] and it says
[1:15:28] christ comes from the greek
[1:15:31] meaning anointed
[1:15:35] the word is the
[1:15:37] derived
[1:15:38] from the greek verb
[1:15:44] meaning to anoint

[1:16:53] all nations under heaven
[1:16:59] all nations under heaven
[1:17:14] in jerusalem
[1:17:16] until the power from up high came down
[1:17:21] people would testify in their own
[1:17:23] language
[1:17:27] and they were carriers
[1:17:41] [Applause]

[1:18:17] where i said this was the last thing i
[1:18:19] said
[1:18:20] he was son of god of the lord
[1:18:24] and he is the word of god
[1:18:27] because he carries carrying the word of
[1:18:29] god

[1:19:31] he may not want to go but he's gonna go
[1:19:41] [Applause]
[1:20:02] whether he feels like it
[1:20:07] whether he wants to
[1:20:11] whether whatever more

[1:25:38] four to one is given by the spirit
[1:25:41] the word of wisdom
[1:25:43] and to another
[1:25:45] the word of knowledge by the same spirit
[1:25:52] spirit
[1:26:00] no that's not what it says there
[1:26:02] let's try that again
[1:26:04] it's right there
[1:26:06] for to one is given
[1:26:08] by the spirit the word of wisdom to
[1:26:11] another the word of knowledge by the
[1:26:13] same spirit
[1:26:16] who gives it foreign
[1:26:22] we wanted to break it up more than he's
[1:26:24] correct
[1:26:26] but we're saying it the way it's written
[1:26:31] to another faith by the same spirit a
[1:26:34] lot of faith
[1:26:48] to another the working america
[1:26:50] prophecy to another discerning of
[1:26:52] spirits
[1:26:53] to another diverse kinds of tongues
[1:27:02] but all these workers
[1:27:05] that one and the self same spirit
[1:27:10] it's the same spirit
[1:27:13] that is anointing an
[1:27:17] with individual of wisdom
[1:27:27] oh all of that
[1:27:30] to form a basis
[1:27:34] in the basis
[1:27:40] for to one is given by the spirit and we
[1:27:43] said wisdom knowledge faith
[1:27:56] is
[1:28:26] is
[1:29:21] you're back here
[1:29:34] is
