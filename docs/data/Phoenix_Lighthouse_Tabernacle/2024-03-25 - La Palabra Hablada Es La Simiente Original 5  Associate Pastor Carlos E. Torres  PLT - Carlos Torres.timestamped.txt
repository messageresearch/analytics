[0:00] what is the first figure in the Zodiac
[0:02] the
[0:05] Virgin what's the last figure Leo
[0:10] the the first coming and the second
[0:12] coming of Christ all of it is written in
[0:21] there then the next Bible was written
[0:24] was in stone called
[0:28] pyramids
[0:33] God wrote In The
[0:35] Pyramid if you study them watch the
[0:37] ancient histories and Wars how they were
[0:40] built before the andian
[0:49] destruction the third was wrote on paper
[0:53] the Bible for the great smart
[0:56] intellectual world to
[0:58] come
[1:06] [Music]
[1:08] God has moved down to the age we're at
[1:12] Leo the
[1:18] line we're at the capping of the
[1:23] pyramid we're in the book of the
[1:26] revelations at the last
[1:28] chapter
[1:32] science says we're 3 minutes before
[1:40] midnight oh think of where we're
[1:44] at and notice let's take the pyramid
[1:46] it's
[1:49] easy runs kind of like in a
[1:55] triangle when we were down here
[1:57] beginning at the early age of the church
[2:00] at the Reformation in Luther's
[2:08] time just a man to say he was a
[2:10] Christian either meant his life or
[2:18] death they killing saying he's a
[2:24] Christian therefore to go through
[2:28] persecution every age to every time
[2:31] there's been
[2:36] persecution all that live Godly in
[2:39] Christ Jesus shall suffer
[2:45] persecution in the age of Luther it was
[2:47] horrible to say a
[2:52] Lutheran he was considered a fanatic and
[2:54] could be put to
[2:58] death many times they killed them at
[3:01] Stakes burn them and everything else for
[3:10] lutherans then the church narrowed as
[3:13] like the
[3:17] pyramid it come into another step of
[3:20] Grace which was
[3:24] sanctification Wesley's time when he
[3:27] protested the angland church Tau
[3:36] Sanic it come into the minority
[3:40] again then they were called a bunch of
[3:44] Fanatics
[3:49] then how manyan Methodist or used to be
[3:52] or was once connect with Methodist
[3:58] Church
[4:01] half of
[4:03] you did you know the Methodist Church
[4:06] almost had the Holy Ghost one
[4:14] time went to Methodist churches and see
[4:16] him fall on the floor and throw water in
[4:18] face and fan him with a fan keep the
[4:19] holy ghost from coming on
[4:28] them
[4:33] now that's the
[4:37] truth down the hills of Kentucky where
[4:39] we had Methodist you guys are Church
[4:41] Jers I
[4:47] hear we had Methodist back there
[4:52] Baptist we got out the Altar and beat
[4:55] one another in the back till we got
[4:58] something
[5:03] we come through we live different after
[5:07] that but you just come up put your name
[5:10] on the book and say I'm a Methodist and
[5:12] get the salt shaker and sprink a little
[5:14] water on you and that's all of
[5:23] it going out wear shorts
[5:28] makeup
[5:31] run the horse races bet gam Place slot
[5:34] machines and everything else still good
[5:45] Methodist that's not
[5:48] Methodist that's just church Jers that's
[5:56] right Baptist the same way Presbyterian
[6:00] all down the same
[6:06] way David said grandchildren God don't
[6:10] have any
[6:15] grandchildren God never had a
[6:19] grandchild he's got Sons but no
[6:27] grandsons you and people come into the
[6:30] Methodist Church or Pentecostal church
[6:31] or Baptist Church because your mother
[6:33] father was Pentecostal or Baptist and
[6:35] your
[6:45] grandson they were Sons your
[6:51] grandsons so God don't have anything
[6:53] like that the church has a lot of that
[6:55] but not but not the not the not God
[6:58] doesn't
[7:06] now notice these on down to it comes
[7:09] down as it becomes to the minority the
[7:19] church the Pentecostal Age come in that
[7:22] certainly cut off a lot
[7:28] ofs
[7:31] then it what did it do it just left the
[7:33] Methodist and Lutheran all
[7:38] behind now the holy spirit's moved right
[7:41] on away from the Pentecostal
[7:47] age what did they do they
[7:52] organiz made themselves we are the
[7:55] Assemblies of God we are the Oneness we
[7:58] are the Tess
[8:07] we are the Church of God we are the this
[8:13] that you don't belong you can't get in
[8:15] heaven unless you got your name on our
[8:22] book oh such
[8:25] nonsense I don't care if you're Baptist
[8:28] me is Presbyterian you put your name on
[8:30] The Book of Life when God puts it on
[8:40] there if you were predestinated to
[8:42] eternal life God will call you some way
[8:46] [Music]
[8:54] somehow you sure
[8:56] will all the father has given me will
[8:59] come come to
[9:02] me no matter what church you belong to
[9:04] that has nothing to do
[9:10] with but the denomination will never do
[9:13] one thing to you but might hinder you a
[9:15] lot from going on with God but it'll
[9:18] never do nothing
[9:28] else you together with a bunch of
[9:30] Believers and
[9:34] unbelievers of course you hit that
[9:36] everywhere you go even had that in
[9:43] heaven so it's all right but you're
[9:47] looking to your
[9:52] denomination look to Jesus amen he's the
[9:56] one to look
[9:58] to
[10:01] now as we're coming right down to
[10:06] the how many I believe this woman here
[10:09] raised her hand that she' study the
[10:15] pyramid you know the PID never was
[10:17] capped was it never did have a cap Stone
[10:19] put on
[10:25] it they never kep even find it
[10:30] they don't know what ever happened to
[10:33] it why why was the Capstone put on the
[10:37] head stone the top of
[10:44] it because he was rejected when he
[10:49] come he was a rejected Stone that's
[10:56] right but it will be capped
[11:00] that's
[11:02] right and then those stones that fit
[11:05] around that headstone will have to be
[11:07] Stones that'll be so completely like
[11:09] that stone that'll fit it joint and
[11:11] every
[11:25] everywhere the pyramid is so perfect you
[11:27] can't run or raise your blade between
[11:29] them where them Stones go
[11:36] together such beautiful
[11:41] masonry some of them would weigh
[11:43] hundreds of tons up in the air and so
[11:46] perfectly set
[11:53] together that's why God's bringing his
[11:58] church
[11:59] we were fitly joined together am one
[12:03] heart and one
[12:08] Accord now somebody say well the Luther
[12:10] back there
[12:14] had then don't you believe
[12:17] it the lutherans will come forth in the
[12:20] resurrection just the same as the rest
[12:21] will come forth in the
[12:28] resurrection Presbyterians and all of
[12:30] God's children will come forth in that
[12:37] Resurrection that's the reason today
[12:39] people say oh well there will be a sweep
[12:41] and Revival that'll go out here and save
[12:43] 100 million
[12:52] Pentecostal will all get saved and
[12:54] that'll be the Rapture you're
[12:58] mistaken
[13:01] that Rapture will be hundreds of
[13:03] thousand that's right but there'll be a
[13:04] made up in 6,000 years of Salvation D
[13:08] 6000 years
[13:17] back man walks in the light as the light
[13:20] comes to him he crosses the bridges when
[13:23] he comes to
[13:28] them
[13:31] now if he refuses it then he's left in
[13:36] darkness but if he keeps moving
[13:40] on now notice then the coming of the
[13:44] Lord Jesus is so close at
[13:47] hand until the spirit from way down in
[13:58] here King just barely justification
[14:02] sanctification baptism of the Holy
[14:04] Spirit and now right into the time of
[14:06] the coming of the
[14:17] head the church has got to be so
[14:20] perfectly like Christ until Christ and
[14:23] the church can unite
[14:25] together the same spirit
[14:37] the spirit of Christ is in you it makes
[14:39] you live the life of Christ act the Life
[14:42] of Christ do the works of
[14:52] Christ believeth on me the works that I
[14:54] do shall he do also Jesus said
[14:58] that
[15:02] see now we going to have we got a
[15:05] Ministry coming it's just exactly like
[15:08] the Life of
[15:14] Christ what does that Ministry identify
[15:17] the coming of the
[15:22] Lord look at it in the world today what
[15:25] why Cru saying and all these other great
[15:28] things
[15:34] great worldwide conflict right hand at
[15:37] any time could go to Power at any second
[15:41] that's
[15:48] right and if that we know that that's
[15:54] closed any sensible person can read in a
[15:57] newspaper listen to a radio
[15:59] or know that that is
[16:06] Clos well remember Christ comes for his
[16:10] church before that
[16:17] happens so how close is the coming of
[16:19] the Lord
[16:23] Jesus maybe before this meeting ends
[16:27] tonight
[16:31] we are at the end time certainly
[16:38] true watch the church as it's come as it
[16:44] moved just take it in your own mind you
[16:47] historians to studies
[16:53] history look at the Lutheran Church
[16:55] under
[16:56] justification coming just for PR from
[16:59] Catholicism look at
[17:07] it and I look at Wesley coming a little
[17:10] closer in the sanctification weaving
[17:27] theur

[50:14] amen God bless you all this
[50:17] morning it's a pleasure to be in the
[50:18] house of the
[50:21] Lord before you take your seats first
[50:23] we'll be reading the
[50:25] scripture be so
[50:28] kind to open Genesis
[50:33] [Music]
[50:35] 1 Genesis 1:1 will continue with the
[50:40] topic that our pastor set for this
[50:45] year the spoken word is the Original
[50:49] Seed how many already have their
[50:53] scripture
[50:55] amen
[50:58] I'm trying to look if somebody's still
[50:59] going through their Bible trying to find
[51:01] it now if we don't know where Genesis is
[51:05] at well then let us read the
[51:09] scripture in the beginning God created
[51:11] the Heaven and the
[51:21] Earth and the Earth was without form and
[51:23] void and darkness was upon the face of
[51:25] the deep and the spirit of God moved
[51:27] upon the face of the
[51:30] waters and God said let there be light
[51:33] and there was
[51:37] light and God saw the light that it was
[51:39] good and God divided the light from the
[51:46] darkness and God called the light day
[51:48] and the Darkness he called night and the
[51:50] evening in the morning were the first
[51:54] day and God add the blessing to the
[51:56] reading of his
[51:58] word kind and please take your
[52:01] seat down please your tell them God
[52:05] bless
[52:09] smile it's a pleasure to be able to see
[52:11] one
[52:12] another as I tell
[52:15] you now even our way we greet each other
[52:17] has changed so if it's not that way it's
[52:20] a fist bump five five there's no problem
[52:23] either
[52:24] way the good thing is that you bless
[52:28] that's what important that you also
[52:29] receive your
[52:31] blessing it's always better to give than
[52:34] to rece it's the law of the
[52:37] boxer because when you give you do with
[52:40] all of your
[52:42] heart the law written in the word of
[52:46] God it says that you will receive a h
[52:48] hundredfold what you
[52:51] give give love comprehension and
[52:53] kindness that is what you will receive
[52:58] or bad words or bad
[53:00] treatments that's where you will receive
[53:03] multiplied so may God help us
[53:07] amen like to send a special greeting to
[53:09] our
[53:12] pastor who is still outside of the
[53:15] country we'll continue praying for
[53:21] him praying for him that God take care
[53:24] of him and bless him but most important
[53:29] once he comes back he can tell us what
[53:30] it is that he's
[53:35] eating him tell us I won't tell you but
[53:37] let him tell us what he is our brother
[53:40] Elis as
[53:41] well may God watch over him and protect
[53:43] his
[53:44] stomach and may God give them
[53:49] strength Pastor stands where God's
[53:52] manifest his power with
[53:53] him that the souls may be delivered
[53:58] May the captives be set
[54:01] free the Holy Spirit fill the
[54:04] people and they listen the word of our
[54:08] pastor and say the word of God I say the
[54:10] word of our pastor now why do I say
[54:14] that because when the ministry opens
[54:17] up oh when the mystery opens
[54:20] up as Paul
[54:22] did when he began to
[54:25] speak
[54:27] part of the development of the thoughts
[54:28] of
[54:30] God he come and he told the
[54:33] Philippians he I want you think and all
[54:35] things true all the
[54:37] honest and everything that is
[54:39] righteous and the nice the
[54:42] kind I want you to think on those
[54:45] things then he extends a bit
[54:52] more says whatever things you are good
[54:55] report
[54:59] just and the God of Peace will be with
[55:06] you Paul goes ahead to that and he
[55:08] starts revealing the mystery of the
[55:11] deity knowing that he is placed in the
[55:13] body of
[55:14] Christ he is a prisoner of
[55:18] Christ he moves a bit and he says what
[55:20] you heard from me what you saw of
[55:23] [Music]
[55:24] me what you learned from me
[55:27] what you received from me do
[55:31] that and the God of Peace will be with
[55:35] you that is where the Revelation is of
[55:38] the time we're living
[55:41] in so let us continue praying for our
[55:45] pastor he's almost time
[55:48] for and it's the last part is always the
[55:51] hardest that's when one is most
[55:55] tired and it's it's more difficult to
[55:58] come
[56:00] back for being in the plane from 10 to
[56:02] 12
[56:06] hours and you you reach a point where
[56:08] where no matter how you move you're not
[56:12] comfortable unless he gets a bed well
[56:15] then that's
[56:16] different but generally he has to
[56:20] pay so may God bless our pastor may
[56:24] continue blessing him may give him
[56:25] strength
[56:29] so let us not forget
[56:31] that to our visitors may God bless
[56:34] you welcome to the house of the
[56:37] Lord it's a pleasure for you to be here

[57:57] time now may God keep
[58:02] her and let's continue with the topic
[58:04] we've been
[58:05] covering but before jumping into
[58:10] that but first I'd like to thank all our
[58:12] brothers who have been helping
[58:18] out as you know we've been doing some
[58:20] remodeling here inside of the

[58:28] God thank you for your
[58:30] efforts I know someone has to make the
[58:33] sacrifice someone has to sacrifice
[58:38] themselves I know some say like yes
[58:40] Church got canceled
[58:42] again I know that some
[58:47] that they used to see that that word a
[58:49] lot in TV they say
[58:54] you those that come to work they say oh
[58:56] no it's going to get canceled
[59:00] again already fasting and praying
[59:09] Church those Brothers God has answered
[59:11] your
[59:12] prayer hopefully soon we won't have to
[59:13] cancel any more services we able to
[59:15] finish
[59:16] today and whatever can't be done today
[59:18] it could be done throughout the
[59:22] week so we can come back to our
[59:25] regular
[59:28] from all of our heart thank you for your
[59:30] [Music]

[1:00:02] you're doing it with all of your heart
[1:00:05] no one
[1:00:07] complains so then the blessing is yet
[1:00:09] even
[1:00:11] greater God bless you and thank you so
[1:00:14] much the spoken word is the Original
[1:00:21] Seed Isaiah 55 we already read that
[1:00:24] scripture before
[1:00:29] tell us that God's thoughts are higher
[1:00:30] than our
[1:00:34] thoughts his thoughts are
[1:00:37] [Music]
[1:00:38] higher his Revelation
[1:00:41] comes Revelation comes to our
[1:00:45] lives it's the only way we can access
[1:00:48] God's
[1:00:49] thoughts have to cry out for
[1:00:52] Revelation God's ways are
[1:00:54] higher
[1:00:56] because his thoughts are
[1:01:00] higher no one can walk higher than their
[1:01:02] very own
[1:01:04] thought no one can live higher than what
[1:01:06] they
[1:01:09] think no one can live higher than what
[1:01:11] they think
[1:01:12] of in Genesis
[1:01:15] 1:1 God analyzed the
[1:01:19] situation to see what condition the
[1:01:21] Earth found itself
[1:01:23] in when he saw the it was below
[1:01:30] that without form and
[1:01:34] voice God saw the void
[1:01:38] he
[1:01:41] saw he to
[1:01:44] dis but God's thoughts have always been
[1:01:49] hidden certain portions throughout the
[1:01:53] ages PA
[1:01:58] but the revelations of the
[1:02:01] Gospel the one that was not
[1:02:05] beloved now it's called The Bride the
[1:02:09] Beloved of the people who which are we
[1:02:12] are
[1:02:13] part it's something important for us to
[1:02:18] understand that we're part of that
[1:02:20] privileged
[1:02:22] group because of
[1:02:24] predestination
[1:02:27] so then we have to look at
[1:02:30] predestination to see and analyze the
[1:02:33] situation to be able to understand who
[1:02:35] we
[1:02:36] are at
[1:02:39] theend God once again analyzed the
[1:02:41] condition of
[1:02:42] the we know what the condition of the
[1:02:44] age
[1:02:45] is where we're going from one place to
[1:02:48] another in this age
[1:02:50] we God analyzed the
[1:02:54] condition begin to speak
[1:02:57] to as thinks
[1:03:01] they poor and
[1:03:04] blind they're naked and they
[1:03:07] not they think they know everything but
[1:03:09] they know
[1:03:10] nothing they constantly are claiming for
[1:03:13] their
[1:03:14] rights that's why the time we
[1:03:17] live everyone is trying to claim their
[1:03:20] rights everyone
[1:03:23] why because it's the anointing that in
[1:03:25] the age that we live
[1:03:28] in when the seed is planted
[1:03:33] or the seed begins to feed
[1:03:36] itself according to where it was
[1:03:40] swn the seed can't feed itself from
[1:03:42] somewhere
[1:03:45] else if you plant a seed outside of your
[1:03:50] house the seed will begin to
[1:03:54] expand and its food will they'll get it
[1:03:56] from what it
[1:03:57] surr it's going to go into the
[1:04:00] iron calcium everything it
[1:04:02] needs because that place where it was
[1:04:04] sewn or
[1:04:07] planted that's where it has what it
[1:04:09] needs in order to
[1:04:12] grow all of the plants have that
[1:04:17] characteristic why plants that you want
[1:04:19] to
[1:04:20] plant and they won't give you
[1:04:24] nothing because what that need what that
[1:04:26] seed needs to
[1:04:27] develop it's not in that in that
[1:04:32] environment so then the
[1:04:35] seed has to have the appropriate
[1:04:39] atmosphere and us as seed of
[1:04:41] God we have two
[1:04:44] options we are seed of
[1:04:47] God that's the first thing you have to
[1:04:50] know I
[1:04:52] am I am a son of the age of
[1:04:58] SE
[1:04:59] physically the seed has no option you
[1:05:02] planted it there and that's where it has
[1:05:04] to
[1:05:06] be but in this time speaking
[1:05:11] spiritually God planted Us in this age
[1:05:13] we're
[1:05:14] living but he put inside of
[1:05:18] us the capacity or capability to be able
[1:05:21] to
[1:05:22] choose the environment of the
[1:05:24] atmosph to be able to feed off of that
[1:05:29] atmosphere live under
[1:05:32] Le or we going to feed ourselves with
[1:05:34] the
[1:05:36] word I'm going to stay like many
[1:05:39] seeds that are planted in toxic
[1:05:42] places the Earth is
[1:05:45] contaminated what do you think the seed
[1:05:46] is going to get nothing but
[1:05:52] contamination if you let Leia take hold
[1:05:54] of you
[1:06:00] your roots begin to grab onto the
[1:06:02] anointing of
[1:06:05] lady so he will feed off of that
[1:06:11] anointing to take hold of your
[1:06:14] mind and after that takes hold of us we
[1:06:17] will
[1:06:20] say why can't I get rid of this
[1:06:24] habit
[1:06:26] the Bible says we're more than
[1:06:29] con all things in Christ who
[1:06:32] streng why can't I get rid of this habit
[1:06:36] and I feel
[1:06:39] defeated why can't I connect myself with
[1:06:42] God why is it that when I
[1:06:46] pray contact or that
[1:06:48] communication I feel like God
[1:06:51] doesn't like God doesn't
[1:06:54] worry pray for it doesn't come and
[1:06:59] happen that's the spirit of Leia
[1:07:02] knocking at your
[1:07:05] door when you begin to think on these
[1:07:08] things I can't connect to
[1:07:15] God and then comes a thought and you
[1:07:17] begin to think on
[1:07:19] it surely it's my
[1:07:22] fault there has to be something wrong
[1:07:24] with me
[1:07:28] that stopping me from experimenting
[1:07:29] God's presence like other people exp we
[1:07:32] begin to blame
[1:07:34] ourselves it's our fault that we're in
[1:07:36] this
[1:07:39] condition why I lose my temper so
[1:07:43] easily why can't I be so patient like
[1:07:45] this other
[1:07:47] person it seems like they got running
[1:07:50] through their veins I want to be that
[1:07:54] way
[1:07:56] such they can't tell I'm already Sparks
[1:07:59] I'm already uh getting lit
[1:08:02] up and then I offend everyone and then I
[1:08:05] feel
[1:08:06] bad and that makes
[1:08:09] makes because I fear that I
[1:08:13] will because I always want to prove my
[1:08:19] point why do I constantly make wrong
[1:08:24] decisions why am I constantly fighting
[1:08:26] with my
[1:08:31] children trying to get to do this and
[1:08:33] that the other and children are fighting
[1:08:34] back with the parents saying no I don't
[1:08:35] want
[1:08:36] to fighting with your husband fighting
[1:08:38] with your
[1:08:40] wife if the toothpaste goes here then
[1:08:43] why is it over
[1:08:48] there something very important it has to
[1:08:50] have the cap
[1:08:54] on why why this
[1:08:56] fear
[1:08:58] worry and negativity consumes me
[1:09:05] why why is it when I see what everybody
[1:09:07] puts on social media on
[1:09:11] Facebook and all those other social
[1:09:13] media why is it that when I see that
[1:09:16] what others do what others
[1:09:20] post they make me feel like my life is
[1:09:23] worthless and has no purpose
[1:09:27] makes me feel that they have the perfect
[1:09:28] life in mind is a disaster
[1:09:34] why why always think that somebody is
[1:09:36] more successful than what I
[1:09:38] am yes brothers that's the way we
[1:09:43] think someone may I was speaking with
[1:09:50] someone no one knows the battles that
[1:09:52] everyone's
[1:09:54] going problems the
[1:09:57] worries this and the
[1:09:59] other it's like I used to tell a
[1:10:02] brother like brother you don't know how
[1:10:04] much I struggle to comb my
[1:10:08] ha he probably thinks well it's easy
[1:10:10] what are you even going to comb
[1:10:13] over so I struggle to comb my hair now
[1:10:16] more than back then I struggle
[1:10:20] more because it's like my hairs became
[1:10:22] more
[1:10:23] rebellious see yes
[1:10:28] you can say well it's easy what are you
[1:10:29] even going to comeb
[1:10:32] over we always think that someone has a
[1:10:36] EAS always thinking about this that or
[1:10:38] the
[1:10:39] other
[1:10:45] question connecting one way or another
[1:10:48] with
[1:10:50] the es
[1:10:54] that
[1:11:00] Speak Us tells us
[1:11:03] come the voice comes through a
[1:11:06] man you can't unbind God's voice with
[1:11:10] human
[1:11:11] flesh God is the one that he will give
[1:11:14] you
[1:11:15] strength you have to accept voice at
[1:11:18] time that you're living in
[1:11:20] Hallelujah way
[1:11:23] there there an Open Door in the
[1:11:28] heavens and I will show
[1:11:31] you anointing
[1:11:35] of but the reason we can't heed to that
[1:11:41] voice pulling
[1:11:48] us is
[1:11:51] trying that we're Something That We're
[1:11:53] Not that we're sinners
[1:11:56] we don't have that no one loves us no
[1:11:59] one will ever no one will ever
[1:12:03] understand W up to our
[1:12:06] reality is that we're sons of
[1:12:09] God the blood of the
[1:12:11] Lamb come from ET going towards
[1:12:16] ET as long as we don't
[1:12:18] recognize the age
[1:12:21] of always have an influence over us
[1:12:25] because the message of our
[1:12:28] age our Prophet by God sent
[1:12:32] by spoken by our to take us out of
[1:12:36] Le he didn't
[1:12:38] come he didn't come to be a theologist
[1:12:42] he didn't come to do
[1:12:43] that came that
[1:12:46] each recognize who we
[1:12:48] are that's the real
[1:12:50] reason and God hides he reveals himself
[1:12:56] Simplicity that's
[1:12:58] why you want God's love in your life
[1:13:00] what do you have to
[1:13:05] do read the word and
[1:13:13] pray why do I need God's love in my
[1:13:16] life
[1:13:20] well when Lord Jesus Christ was on
[1:13:24] Earth
[1:13:26] he came as the
[1:13:29] lamb and he began to display his
[1:13:33] love he was
[1:13:37] rejected he was injured by
[1:13:40] our the punishment of us was upon
[1:13:44] Him each time that he was on
[1:13:47] Earth each time that he
[1:13:50] did he was subjected
[1:13:54] to one had the habit of praying it was
[1:13:56] our Lord Jesus
[1:13:57] Christ and if the Lord Jesus Christ had
[1:13:59] to pray what about
[1:14:02] us what about
[1:14:06] us I want you to meditate on this for a
[1:14:09] moment if God made
[1:14:18] flesh God himself came and made himself
[1:14:20] so a
[1:14:24] virgin F the scripture to Isaiah a
[1:14:27] virgin shall
[1:14:30] conceive God coming to
[1:14:35] dwell the full Divinity of the body made
[1:14:38] flesh he had to
[1:14:44] pray now what about
[1:14:46] us what about
[1:14:51] us I just can't get rid of this habit
[1:14:54] what do I have have to
[1:14:58] do read the word and
[1:15:02] pray why can't I connect with God I feel
[1:15:05] like God doesn't hear
[1:15:08] me read the word and
[1:15:13] pray
[1:15:17] something the karate Angel is going to
[1:15:19] come and just give him a kick
[1:15:22] no don't think that if you're waiting
[1:15:24] for that
[1:15:32] for he say why I lose my temper so
[1:15:34] easily why can't I be like that brother
[1:15:37] so to do what do I have to do
[1:15:41] brother read the word and
[1:15:45] pray why do I constantly make the
[1:15:48] wrong I know that I shouldn't do it but
[1:15:50] I still do
[1:15:52] it what's the answer to that problem
[1:15:56] read the word and
[1:15:59] pray what I fight with my wife or with
[1:16:02] my husband so much
[1:16:09] why because what what what isn't matter
[1:16:12] is there what's the problem with that
[1:16:14] it's not bothering anyone
[1:16:18] there well then we need
[1:16:21] Revelation because maybe the problem is
[1:16:23] not
[1:16:28] there something over here that's
[1:16:29] building up
[1:16:32] toothpast we think
[1:16:34] it's but in reality it's something
[1:16:40] else over here and the pants over
[1:16:42] there and the wife is walking
[1:16:45] around trying to Pi everything up to go
[1:16:48] do the
[1:16:49] laund and she's barely finishing with
[1:16:51] laundry and now the shoes are over
[1:16:53] there and we throw everything everywhere
[1:16:58] well the answer this problem what do we
[1:17:00] have to
[1:17:01] do we have to read the word
[1:17:06] and from the to give Revelation for why
[1:17:10] it's not good to leave your toothpaste
[1:17:17] there why does Fear worry and negativity
[1:17:19] come and take hold of my
[1:17:22] mind what do I have to do to re to
[1:17:24] obtain that the peace of
[1:17:27] God to read the word and
[1:17:32] pray why is it that when I see what
[1:17:34] other people post on social
[1:17:36] media what I what I feel
[1:17:40] bad I can't even go to the corner and
[1:17:43] this person over here is out in
[1:17:45] France I can't even make it to C
[1:17:49] Grand and they're in France here and
[1:17:51] they go to New
[1:17:53] York
[1:17:57] that I'm I'm a skyscraper that you can
[1:17:58] see all the way down I'm standing over
[1:18:02] [Music]
[1:18:04] Crystal Pho and if I'm lucky I can get
[1:18:06] to North
[1:18:09] Phoenix what's the solution to that
[1:18:15] problem and read the word and pray maybe
[1:18:18] the first thing God will anwers they
[1:18:19] have to shut down that social
[1:18:23] media but in order to pray does God have
[1:18:25] to come and force
[1:18:31] you no that's why God allows us things
[1:18:33] to
[1:18:35] happen the problems lead us to read the
[1:18:40] word because the word when we
[1:18:42] it it will make contact with our
[1:18:46] spirit to wake
[1:18:48] up awaken who we truly
[1:18:52] are when word makes contact with the SE
[1:18:54] that is inside of
[1:18:56] us then the seed will begin to
[1:18:59] move the atmosphere will begin to
[1:19:02] change that
[1:19:05] atere that's being created by the word
[1:19:10] of I'll begin to
[1:19:13] meditate I'll begin to do what I
[1:19:16] to I'm busy or if I'm not
[1:19:21] busy doesn't matter
[1:19:23] I because this is my spiritual life
[1:19:27] that it's more important to pray than to
[1:19:30] sleep
[1:19:33] yes I prom I promise
[1:19:37] you if you drive 30 minutes
[1:19:41] minimum 30 minutes minimum if you drive
[1:19:43] to work wherever you're
[1:19:46] going you can listen to one message a
[1:19:51] day don't tell me you don't have time to
[1:19:53] listen to messages
[1:19:57] if just when you're commuting to your
[1:19:58] job 30
[1:20:00] minutes wherever you go you listen to
[1:20:02] the
[1:20:03] m store listen to the
[1:20:06] message some errands listen to the
[1:20:09] message minimum you listen to one
[1:20:13] message you listen to one message daily
[1:20:15] how many will you do in a
[1:20:17] week I'll give you I'll give you the
[1:20:19] Sunday off but what about the rest of
[1:20:21] the
[1:20:22] week that's six just a week wow how many
[1:20:27] do I listen to
[1:20:29] now don't tell me just think about it
[1:20:32] just think about
[1:20:37] it is it so difficult to pray for 15
[1:20:40] minutes 20
[1:20:42] minutes sometimes we're even watching TV
[1:20:45] for up to an
[1:20:47] hour I'm going to watch TV for half an
[1:20:50] hour and then I'm going to pray for half
[1:20:52] an
[1:20:53] hour
[1:20:55] before you know it you'll be praying for
[1:20:58] hour and you'll be watching TV for zero
[1:21:01] minutes you won't watch
[1:21:04] it because the spirit will pull you to
[1:21:06] the
[1:21:07] word that's what it did with the Lord
[1:21:09] Jesus Christ it always led him to the
[1:21:14] word that's why if you want to go deeper
[1:21:17] into and you want God's love to
[1:21:19] transform you to mold
[1:21:21] you you want the anointing of
[1:21:25] create a barrier around
[1:21:30] you so doesn't cause you to do things
[1:21:32] you don't want to
[1:21:34] do I'm going to give you the
[1:21:36] solution the hidden mystery hidden
[1:21:38] throughout times you have to do
[1:21:42] what read the word and pray is that
[1:21:48] difficult we just have to analyze the
[1:21:52] situation analyze the situation
[1:21:55] to see the value of the seed what
[1:21:59] seed the one that God planted in my
[1:22:02] heart I am well worthy I have
[1:22:06] value God had the cross for me for me
[1:22:11] for
[1:22:12] me when you always
[1:22:15] touch he cried he died on the cross for
[1:22:18] me for me for me for
[1:22:21] me you know that when you do that
[1:22:25] your body begins
[1:22:27] to they positive
[1:22:29] vibration they affect
[1:22:32] your it begin to change the composition
[1:22:35] of and it begin to hor C chemical in
[1:22:38] your body that will make to the word of
[1:22:42] God to be
[1:22:46] positive that's the effect that God's
[1:22:48] word has on
[1:22:53] our
[1:22:56] that our very own cells are getting used
[1:23:00] to they're accustom to stress
[1:23:04] hormones we have to change our
[1:23:07] atmosphere we have to change the
[1:23:09] atmosphere that we
[1:23:11] live worries what do I have to
[1:23:16] do how
[1:23:19] often brother says that a
[1:23:22] Christian every day
[1:23:25] they read the word every day and they
[1:23:28] pray every
[1:23:30] day that is what we have to
[1:23:33] do and what will be the result if we do
[1:23:36] that the musicians can please come
[1:23:47] forward I even lost
[1:23:52] the good thing I have eyes everywhere
[1:23:59] what's going to be the
[1:24:01] result God's power to
[1:24:04] transform you can please
[1:24:10] stand and everything under control to
[1:24:12] bring forth of its kind now remember to
[1:24:17] bring when he put the seed in the
[1:24:22] Earth the seed can only come for with
[1:24:24] the power of life
[1:24:26] with to transform it from a seed to a
[1:24:29] plant or whatever it
[1:24:31] was his transforming
[1:24:34] power now God put the seed in
[1:24:38] there with potentials that it would be
[1:24:40] what he
[1:24:41] said and now my question is
[1:24:44] for what is it that God said that you
[1:24:46] would
[1:24:47] be what is that cry you have in your
[1:24:50] heart that cry in your
[1:24:53] heart
[1:24:54] one
[1:24:56] deep you
[1:24:58] want because there is a holy spirit if
[1:25:02] you
[1:25:04] want I tell
[1:25:07] you are free this

[1:25:32] problem bitterness is
