[16:14] for as many as have sinned without law
[16:16] shall also perish without law and as
[16:19] many as have sinned in the law shall be
[16:21] judged by the law for not the hearers of
[16:23] the law are the are just before god but
[16:26] the doers of the law shall be justified
[16:28] for when the gentiles which have not the
[16:31] law do by nature the things contained in
[16:33] the in the law these having not the law
[16:35] are allah unto themselves
[16:37] which show the work of the law written
[16:39] in their hearts their conscience also
[16:41] bearing witness and their thoughts the
[16:43] mean while accusing or excusing one
[16:46] another in the day when god shall judge
[16:48] the secrets of men by jesus christ
[16:50] according to my gospel

[17:24] wherefore i give you to understand that
[17:26] no man speaking by the spirit of god
[17:29] calls jesus a curse
[17:31] and not no man can say that jesus is the
[17:33] lord but by the holy ghost
[17:36] [Music]
[17:41] gracias
[18:23] the hunger and thirst after
[18:25] righteousness for they shall be filled
[18:39] someone might be in bondage lord may
[18:41] they be set free
[18:45] and those that have been separated
[18:48] did they rise up a little higher
[18:51] than theirs
[18:52] they stretch out their wings when a
[18:54] pillar
[19:06] for every good and perfect gift comes
[19:08] down
[19:41] let's sing a song spanish
[19:45] [Music]
[20:15] foreign
[20:21] [Music]
[20:30] foreign
[20:37] foreign
[20:38] [Applause]
[20:38] [Music]
[20:49] [Music]
[20:55] right
[20:58] [Music]
[21:06] is
[21:09] [Music]
[21:26] thank you
[21:43] welcome brother
[21:45] it is a pleasure to have the young man
[21:47] brother john jonathan and alan
[21:56] it's a pleasure to have
[22:11] in the lord
[22:18] we're studying here and the subject that
[22:20] we've taken is a letter to the romans
[22:36] and the subtitle that this message has
[22:38] is your conscience and the day of
[22:41] judgment
[22:43] this is the fourth message on that uh
[22:54] like to speak on this morning is
[22:56] concerning
[22:57] unit
[22:58] oneness excuse me oneness
[23:06] i'm trying to bring it the easiest way
[23:08] for it to be understood
[23:12] and sometimes that's a little hard
[23:18] you know that it's not hard to preach
[23:26] the thing is to bring it down to a level
[23:28] for the people can understand uh
[23:45] that a human being is a triune being
[23:58] the brother is going to draw some
[23:59] circles the first one being the body
[24:16] this time instead of another circle
[24:20] and inside the heart
[24:21] is a compartment
[24:26] that's where the soul is
[25:07] three things united may comprise one
[25:09] thing
[25:38] you see that it's hard to separate the
[25:40] spirit and soul
[25:45] the only way we can separate it is by
[25:47] through the message
[25:51] taking those things that the messenger
[25:52] has told us
[25:54] and just stand there
[26:08] i'd like to brother to write down the
[26:10] word
[26:14] like for you to write down that book on
[26:16] your in your notebooks lord is a one
[26:18] heaven power
[26:20] and authority
[26:22] over others
[26:36] how many of you want to have the lord in
[26:38] your heart
[26:47] we as believers want to have the lord
[26:48] jesus christ in our heart
[27:04] once we start getting into it a little
[27:05] more
[27:08] we find out
[27:11] that the devil is also lord a lord
[27:32] remember
[27:50] let's repeat again what's in the circle
[27:52] so i can understand what i'm saying so
[27:53] far
[27:58] what's on the outside is the body
[28:38] wrote down here on this one that i
[28:40] wanted to comment on what is a soul
[29:10] you couldn't pull it up no matter how
[29:12] much you do for it
[29:17] that soul's got to be changed here
[29:22] to be born again
[29:51] in order for us to see exactly what
[29:52] brother
[30:29] the thing is just that not everybody has
[30:32] eternal life
[31:15] you understood the circle we have before
[31:16] us say
[31:36] i'd like for you to follow along please
[31:37] i'm going to try and speak as calmly and
[31:39] slowly as possible for you to understand
[31:44] i was going to write down the word
[31:53] so the best way at the top and i want
[31:54] you to follow along here
[32:09] we understand the word elohim to mean
[32:11] the self-existing
[33:09] we could come down to the level where we
[33:10] as human beings could understand
[33:15] what came out of him is called a halo
[33:22] a halo
[33:29] this halo is called logos by the
[33:31] theologians
[33:35] realmente is
[33:49] notice how simple it is
[33:56] actually the message was brought to us
[34:03] and that's the theme for our convention
[34:05] is god in simplicity
[34:09] it's really really simple
[34:13] first of all it was elohim the
[34:15] self-existence
[34:17] he's the lord of
[34:19] apocalypses when you go to a revelation
[34:25] it says that the lord omnipotent
[34:26] reigneth
[34:29] so then out of him
[34:32] came the
[35:13] is that right
[36:01] [Applause]
[36:09] we will be able to understand why it is
[36:10] that brother branham
[36:16] that that seed must be dramatized
[36:22] i believe that in us
[37:05] what is it that gives see life to that
[37:08] seed
[37:10] we lived
[37:13] we do a lot of things
[37:16] we're born
[37:18] of our parents
[37:20] and then we
[37:34] we don't use
[37:45] is
[38:29] some people don't like enchiladas
[39:12] we all have a soul
[39:26] [Applause]
[39:54] and they're both the same
[39:57] grano so you split those seeds
[40:04] talk like about a grain of corn
[41:45] let's look at it like this
[42:00] a little bit
[42:12] the spirit is the father
[42:28] try
[42:29] deal concerning the seed
[42:33] that's the feminine
[42:36] isn't that right
[42:38] i'm gonna come back now
[42:41] i see that uh
[42:56] actually
[43:52] she
[44:06] doesn't matter how much
[44:34] i'm
[45:01] and until there's a transformation of
[45:02] the souls
[45:14] is
[45:30] transformed
[45:32] has to be dramatized
[45:40] when a man and a woman united
[45:51] and the man releases a million
[45:54] germs also
[45:58] one after
[46:12] that's
[47:02] the holy ghost starts dealing with your
[47:03] heart talking to it
[47:08] your conscious starts
[47:29] [Applause]
[48:31] remember one thing notice
[48:57] a
[49:23] it's not worthwhile at all if people say
[49:25] well tremendous
[49:27] what are the brothers
[49:40] you know that it's very easy to ask
[49:42] questions
[49:56] of ourselves
[50:08] god chose
[50:23] the
[50:24] mind okay put the devil the mind
[50:28] god the heart
[50:36] are you willing to have me ask you
[50:38] questions
[50:42] i always ask myself those questions
[50:45] or questions
[50:46] yeah
[50:48] if it be
[50:51] el diablo the
[51:06] how could it be
[51:20] asked yourself i would have you know
[51:22] what yeah
[51:23] i'm going to tell you
[51:26] something that i have said for years
[51:29] and you've heard me yeah
[51:31] and i've really understood it
[51:48] william branham
[51:53] not seen in any other man on this earth
[52:02] when i accepted this message
[52:08] we had been taught that the woman was to
[52:10] wear a veil
[52:12] and that's how the women dressed
[52:15] they weren't changed
[52:29] that's right
[52:43] my mom and my wife were there on
[52:45] commentary and they heard me say hey
[52:49] what brother had said
[52:52] my mom she took off her video
[52:55] my wife took her life
[53:13] all michelle wear a hat no no
[53:16] prove it to me
[53:18] i couldn't prove it
[53:20] i've said that many times
[53:22] i've mentioned it many times
[53:25] on the contrary i will go to the bible
[53:40] el
[54:22] is
[54:50] freely
[55:14] and apart
[55:32] oneness
[55:43] i want to get into the scripture
[56:18] how many steps did the pyramid have that
[56:19] the prophet drew yeah there were seven
[56:24] so way up at the top
[56:26] is the eighth
[56:28] corrector
[57:12] remember there's two towers
[57:14] the body has a tower
[57:17] has a tower
[57:19] so then that tower controls
[57:21] the control towers in the soil
[57:23] right there in the heart
[57:38] thank you
[58:04] christ in the holy ghost is the same
[58:06] thing
[58:47] genesis chapter 2.
[59:01] genesis 2
[59:18] a lot of questions
[59:20] has raised a lot of questions
[59:29] has raised a lot of questions
[59:43] to hell
[1:00:13] they shall be
[1:00:18] [Music]
[1:00:47] me
[1:00:52] [Music]
