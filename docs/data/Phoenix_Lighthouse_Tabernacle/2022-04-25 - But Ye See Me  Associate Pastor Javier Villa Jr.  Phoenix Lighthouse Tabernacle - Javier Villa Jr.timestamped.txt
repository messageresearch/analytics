[39:05] just just please hear a small piece
[39:10] so you can receive this information
[39:12] and it'll be of help to all of us
[39:15] the word of the lord reads the following
[39:20] i will not leave you comfortless i will
[39:22] come to you
[39:35] yet a little while and the world sees me
[39:37] no more but ye see me because i live ye

[40:50] with all the local governments
[40:54] that helps us bring forth these services
[40:58] and i've all of you too brother may god
[41:00] bless you
[41:04] once again we're in the plan of
[41:05] redemption
[41:10] today now the subject we'll be focusing
[41:12] on it's a little simple
[41:16] title it but you see me
[41:18] hey
[41:30] [Music]
[41:45] it's a promise god is giving to us
[41:49] first of all he says he will not leave
[41:50] us comfortless
[41:53] he will come to us amen amen
[41:58] said something more simple that we've
[42:00] repeated many times
[42:04] in john 14 19.
[42:09] and the world sees me no more
[42:13] he's speaking here of the world the
[42:15] exterior the cosmos
[42:24] believers
[42:26] i'll repeat that
[42:40] ye shall live also
[43:51] he didn't appear to everyone amen
[44:05] the prophet says we're going to read in
[44:06] a second
[44:10] he could appear to the pilot
[44:12] and claim to him
[44:19] the high priest
[44:48] listen closely
[45:31] so it was a great time them them
[45:33] glorious 40 days
[45:37] i would have loved to have been there
[45:41] but then thinking again
[45:44] that i'd have to
[46:11] today he still only to his elected
[46:13] church believers
[46:15] notice brethren
[46:22] and then he appeared to his elected
[46:23] church
[46:26] the rest
[46:54] know
[47:08] why did not jesus after his resurrection
[47:10] if he was so interested in everybody
[47:13] knowing that he had raised from the dead
[47:14] then i wonder why he did not
[47:16] go up well i'll say pilate or to herod
[47:19] and say to them
[47:44] or go to orthodox church down in the
[47:46] synagogue and say to them
[48:04] is now you all have always believed that
[48:07] there would come a messiah and david
[48:09] said his soul would not be left in hell
[48:11] neither would he suffer his holy one to
[48:13] see corruption so i am here the one that
[48:15] you nailed to the cross i am hearing the
[48:17] resurrection to prove to you that
[48:32] when he was here in person on earth
[48:33] before his crucifixion
[48:36] they would not believe him afterwards
[48:42] there's something else that happened
[49:00] [Music]
[49:11] that's the same way he would do it today
[49:14] she would come today
[49:19] which he has in spirit form
[49:26] prophecy only comes
[49:28] today i
[52:16] so
