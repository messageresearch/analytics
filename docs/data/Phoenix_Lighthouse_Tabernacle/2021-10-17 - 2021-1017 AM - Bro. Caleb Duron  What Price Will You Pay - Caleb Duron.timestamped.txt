[39:14] careful

[39:25] certain things

[39:42] no way to uh to grow in faith is that
[39:44] right

[40:32] spanish huh
[40:34] amen matthew chapter 13. matteo capitol
[40:44] amen
[40:46] says here again the kingdom of heaven is
[40:49] like unto
[40:50] unto treasure hid in a field
[40:53] the which when a man hath found he
[40:55] hideth and for joy therefore thereof
[40:58] goeth and selleth all
[41:01] that he had and buyeth that field
[41:15] again the kingdom of heaven is like unto
[41:17] a merchant man seeking goodly
[41:24] who when he had found one pearl of great
[41:26] price went and sold all
[41:28] that he had and bought it
[41:36] amen
[41:37] uh m47 again the kingdom of heaven is
[41:39] like unto a net that was cast into the
[41:42] sea and gathered of every kind has
[41:50] which when it was full they drew
[41:52] they drew it to shore and sat down and
[41:55] gathered the good on to vessels
[41:57] but cast
[41:59] the bat away
[42:07] so so shall it be
[42:09] at the end of the world
[42:11] the angels shall come forth and sever
[42:13] the wicked
[42:15] uh several the wicked from among the
[42:17] just
[42:23] and shall cast them into the furnace of
[42:25] fire there shall be willing and gnashing
[42:27] of teeth
[42:41] and all the time you were good is
[42:50] and though
[42:52] you allow him to try our faith and he
[42:54] presents things in front of us
[42:59] i recently
[43:01] read the back of the book
[43:04] and i was refreshed to remember if we
[43:07] are recording that at the end time we
[43:10] win
[43:23] and remembering that you are in my heart
[43:27] and that i too
[43:29] have already
[43:31] conquered death hell yeah
[43:35] for thou art with me oh lord
[43:40] and i believe in you this morning

[43:58] in jesus christ's name
[44:00] for there is none greater
[44:03] amen amen you may be seated
[44:06] this morning i wanted to talk uh preach
[44:09] to you this morning
[44:12] on a subject called
[44:14] on a subject
[44:16] what price would you pay
[44:20] what price will you pay
[44:23] i know that when we come to the the
[44:25] christian walk
[44:27] christian we uh we sometimes it's it's a
[44:30] jailhouse conversion
[44:34] sometimes it is a
[44:37] hospital conversion
[44:40] hospital perhaps a deathbed
[44:43] perhaps you're you're afraid of
[44:45] something happening
[44:48] maybe somebody close to you
[44:51] had a tragedy
[44:54] that seemingly woke you up
[44:58] or perhaps it was just uh uh something
[45:01] uh well for the most part
[45:15] but too often as people
[45:19] we uh we we barter or bargain with god
[45:24] understands what i'm saying
[45:27] we give up certain things
[45:30] but not all things
[45:44] would obtain
[45:47] you you see that in the sold out life of
[45:50] jesus christ
[45:53] and right away we say well that was
[45:55] different he was the son of god
[45:59] well i should remind you that adam also
[46:01] was the son of god
[46:05] and jesus had a choice
[46:08] jesus could have had a family
[46:11] jesus could have had children
[46:25] he was he had something pushing or
[46:27] leading him
[46:29] but the flesh part of him
[46:32] had a choice
[46:34] and and jesus saw through vision through
[46:37] the revelation that that god in him gave
[46:40] him
[46:53] how he was able to pray
[47:07] how is he able to do
[47:08] this because he saw the bigger greater
[47:11] picture
[47:13] and we must remember as people
[47:17] as human beings
[47:20] that the the the temporary uh
[47:23] satisfactions here
[47:27] or just that temporary solamentos
[47:30] and nothing that you are enjoying
[47:34] that perhaps is sinful
[47:55] and he was telling me how he was having
[47:57] trouble fighting this sickness
[48:01] and i said you know you lived a pretty
[48:03] good life the last few years
[48:06] but while you were young you did a lot
[48:08] of damage
[48:11] lots of drinking
[48:13] yeah lots of you know
[48:14] drugs and so forth
[48:17] and it caused his liver and his kidneys
[48:19] and so his body to overwork itself
[48:25] so that now that he really needs the
[48:27] strength of his immune system
[49:13] your flesh however
[49:20] [Applause]
[49:23] and you say well why didn't god just
[49:25] heal me of the of the attributes of sin
[49:36] he's coming back for the part of you
[49:38] that's a part of him from before the
[49:41] foundation of the world
[49:47] [Applause]
[49:56] and blood
[50:01] [Applause]
[50:06] this flesh is not going back to god the
[50:08] spirit is going back to god
[50:12] [Applause]
[50:23] god will forgive you
[50:38] the evidence is still there
[50:40] and so that part of sin is a part of the
[50:43] pecan that that was pleasure for a
[50:45] little while
[50:48] you you have to work through those
[50:49] things
[50:52] was the drugs worth it was the drinking
[50:55] worth it
[50:56] was was the you know
[50:58] you understand what i'm saying
[51:01] and so then we begin to understand
[51:05] if you pay a greater price
[51:08] a greater portion of god is there for
[51:11] you
[51:13] and we often uh uh
[51:15] you know point out the bad things
[51:19] but it's not just the bad things that'll
[51:21] keep you out of the presence of god
[51:26] working is good
[51:28] and having wealth is fine
[51:32] but if it keeps you from coming to
[51:34] church
[51:46] it puts a wedge between you and the lord
[51:48] how many understand we'll
[52:29] how much of god do you really want
[52:37] [Applause]
[52:45] now i've laid a foundation let me go a
[52:48] little deeper
[52:51] if you'll turn to genesis chapter 21
[52:55] er verse nine particularly
[52:58] and we knew that god had called abraham
[53:02] to a a place
[53:06] who was builder who uh to a city whose
[53:09] builder and maker was god
[53:12] but now if you're familiar with the
[53:14] story
[53:16] it was not just a different place
[53:22] come out of the people you're around
[53:25] leave your father and
[53:32] [Applause]
[53:41] [Applause]
[53:54] and you can see that that abram had
[53:56] nothing but trouble
[53:59] until he let lot go
[54:01] a lot but then we we go a little further
[54:06] he was waiting for a promised son
[54:10] [Applause]
[54:19] but it was taking a little bit of time
[54:24] [Applause]
[54:29] and sarah started to say well maybe you
[54:32] should do this
[54:34] or maybe god meant this
[54:41] [Applause]
[54:58] [Applause]
[55:03] it says i'm going to visit you according
[55:05] to the time of life
[55:08] remember
[55:09] ishmael had already been born
[55:12] he tells them
[55:14] i'm going to bring you the promise i
[55:16] told you
[55:19] [Applause]
[55:33] the moms are competing now
[55:36] and the suns are competing
[55:39] [Applause]
[55:41] that the birthright goes to the
[55:43] firstborn
[55:46] and sarah was not okay with that
[55:49] and verse 21 uh verse nine here it says
[55:53] and sarah saw the son of hagar
[55:55] the egyptian which she had borne unto
[55:58] abraham mocking
[56:08] wherefore she said unto abraham cast out
[56:12] this bondwoman and her son for the son
[56:15] of this bones woman shall not be air
[56:18] with my son even isaac
[56:28] now listen verse 11.
[56:30] and the thing was very grievous
[56:34] in abraham's sight because of his son
[56:42] are you catching what i'm doing here
[56:44] it was not an easy thing
[56:48] i i don't care if it came from hagar
[56:51] or what the issue was
[56:54] this boy is still
[56:57] [Applause]
[57:03] but there was still some kind of bond
[57:05] between them
[57:08] so help me out now you understand what
[57:09] i'm saying
[57:10] he
[57:11] [Applause]
[57:23] and this time he says
[57:39] [Music]
[57:41] [Applause]
[57:48] but he had to pay
[57:50] a bigger price
[57:55] [Applause]
[58:04] you'd not be able to number them
[58:14] [Applause]
[58:15] and i imagine that it must have been
[58:17] hard on isaac as well
[58:20] that was his
[58:27] [Applause]
[58:41] [Applause]
[58:49] abraham knew god's word
[58:53] if he proceeded to kill isaac
[58:58] god would have to raise him up again
[59:01] to fulfill his promise
[59:03] [Applause]
[59:11] [Applause]
[59:15] because of this
[59:18] because of this
[59:21] i'm going to do what i said i was going
[59:23] oh yeah
[59:26] well god had already given his word
[59:29] it wasn't that god was looking for him
[59:31] to do something
[59:33] he was allowing abraham
[59:36] to prove to abraham
[59:39] abraham
[59:40] was willing to pay any prices
[59:47] [Music]
[59:51] [Applause]
[1:00:03] [Music]
[1:00:05] [Applause]
[1:00:15] [Applause]

[1:00:51] close
[1:00:53] you're going to be so close to me closer
[1:00:56] than anybody has ever been to me
[1:00:59] and i would get excited

[1:01:09] to send you a number we are going to be
[1:01:11] tight
[1:01:12] in the world that you and me are tight
[1:01:16] praise god
[1:01:18] but then he might say this
[1:01:22] you've got
[1:01:31] [Applause]

[1:02:09] forgive me brother
[1:02:11] as the saying goes
[1:02:13] it's all fun and games
[1:02:16] so somebody loses an eyeliner

[1:02:34] i said he would require it
[1:02:37] you understand the difference
[1:02:39] it's not that he would snatch it from
[1:02:40] your hand
[1:02:42] it would be just give it over

[1:03:50] would never be able to pay the price
[1:03:54] we'd never own up to it

[1:07:53] he says and this new birth is nothing
[1:07:55] less than a mess
[1:07:59] you get up from the altar crying
[1:08:03] and carrying on continuing
[1:08:05] uh it makes a starchy church feel like
[1:08:07] you don't have to do that
[1:08:22] that we live today
[1:08:24] and are willing to pay the price
[1:08:28] amen amen i hear the pouch saying it man
[1:08:33] all right if you're willing to pay the
[1:08:34] price
[1:08:36] and lay
[1:09:01] we ought to teach for them the baptism
[1:09:03] of the holy spirit

[1:11:09] see when adam took the first bite
[1:11:17] [Applause]

[1:11:41] amen amen so what price are you willing
[1:11:43] to pay yeah
[1:11:45] i know we got some pretty intelligent
[1:11:47] people
[1:11:50] and we've got some really revelated
[1:11:52] people
[1:12:17] we still need to hand over those
[1:12:19] trophies to god
[1:12:48] criticize
[1:13:17] that's strange
[1:13:19] you don't like the way he did things
[1:13:21] you don't like how he did things
[1:13:23] you don't like the people that follow
[1:13:25] his message
[1:13:27] but without the message
[1:13:29] he had nothing to preach
[1:13:34] huh
[1:13:36] i got a question
[1:13:38] why is it that when when when people
[1:13:41] cause a disturbance
[1:13:59] how come they don't go down to the
[1:14:00] baptist church with that stuff
[1:14:03] help me out somebody you wanna make one
[1:14:05] how come they don't go meet with the
[1:14:06] pope
[1:14:08] set him straight
[1:14:10] that's how you say pope papa oh yes
[1:14:12] that's horrible
[1:14:17] huh i'll come in on go meet with the
[1:14:18] catholic dignitaries
[1:14:22] of god with their nonsense
[1:14:25] no because they're only big shots in
[1:14:27] message churches
[1:14:29] you know why they don't go down those
[1:14:30] places
[1:14:32] [Applause]
[1:14:34] they know those dignitaries
[1:14:38] because all they got is words
[1:15:10] give up his first wife
[1:15:12] he had to give up his daughter
[1:15:15] he had to give up the baptist church
[1:15:18] away from all those things
[1:15:20] in order for god to take him further
[1:15:36] did you say montoya yeah i found out
[1:15:39] pastor montoya
[1:15:42] that that that god deals with me better
[1:15:45] okay
[1:15:47] when i get away from people
[1:16:02] and if you don't do it is you stand
[1:16:04] lower
[1:16:13] maybe i'll cause you to have a
[1:16:14] misunderstanding with somebody
[1:16:16] else
[1:16:18] and people walk
[1:16:46] but i went
[1:16:54] and right when i got to the hotel
[1:16:56] hotel i saw they didn't feel good
[1:16:58] i said what in the world is this
[1:17:00] i was in
[1:17:13] you know what i'm saying just the
[1:17:14] pressure
[1:17:24] the brothers thought i was sick so they
[1:17:26] wouldn't come see me
[1:17:28] i
[1:17:39] and all i could do was pray
[1:17:41] and the lord showed me some things
[1:18:00] i had to i paid for that trip
[1:18:04] and the lord told me this
[1:18:06] so you'll know that i allowed this
[1:18:10] i'm going to send somebody to pay the
[1:18:11] bill for you
[1:18:14] so one of the brothers that found out i
[1:18:15] was sick
[1:18:18] he found out what my expenses were
[1:18:21] and he said he felt led to god to
[1:18:22] reimburse me
[1:18:23] yes
[1:18:37] sometimes you need to let brother uh
[1:18:39] pastor ernie
[1:18:41] ernie get along with the burning bush
[1:18:44] so that he can give you what god wants
[1:18:46] to give you
[1:18:49] sometimes if we're bothering the pastor
[1:18:50] or just
[1:19:08] yeah let me finish up i don't know how
[1:19:09] much time it's gonna tell me that
[1:19:11] i need it got about 10 15 minutes or
[1:19:13] something

[1:19:20] okay and so it is today i got 35 more
[1:19:23] minutes wow
[1:19:27] there is no need of any man dying in sin
[1:19:31] there's no need of all this stuff going
[1:19:33] on
[1:20:02] away
[1:20:19] [Music]
[1:20:26] [Applause]
[1:20:40] but god allows the situations to come
[1:20:42] down
[1:20:44] he
[1:21:06] [Music]
[1:21:12] there's no
[1:21:34] [Applause]
[1:22:08] for
[1:22:22] stop making them do it
[1:22:25] let god show them how to do it
[1:22:29] i'll close with this
[1:22:30] there's a bomb in gilead
[1:22:33] there's a physician there are you medica
[1:22:35] but the people won't take his medicine
[1:22:44] thinks he's too good to take the
[1:22:45] medicine of the holy ghost
[1:22:48] the holy ghost is god's medicine
[1:22:55] [Applause]
[1:23:59] sometimes it's hard yeah
[1:24:01] but it always does
[1:24:04] it tastes bad
[1:24:06] it tastes better it takes bad tasting
[1:24:08] medicine
[1:24:10] medicine
[1:24:11] to do to do you any good but
[1:24:14] is that right they're not willing to pay
[1:24:16] the price

[1:27:46] there
[1:27:47] where the church is failing
[1:27:50] in a place
[1:27:52] overcoming
[1:27:54] overcoming temperance
[1:28:27] here's my neighbor
[1:28:29] the person sitting next to the person
