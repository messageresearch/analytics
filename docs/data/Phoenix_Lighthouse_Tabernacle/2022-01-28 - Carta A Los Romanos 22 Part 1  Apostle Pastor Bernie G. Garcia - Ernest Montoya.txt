========================================
[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so so [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] um [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i greet each and every one of you in the precious name of our lord jesus christ let's get into the word romanos capitolo romans chapter eight delbert [Music] we're happy that each and every one of you is here this morning [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of god let us pray today [Music] in the name of the lord jesus christ [Music] [Music] okay [Music] [Music] oh [Music] we of course already know that this is a 22nd message in the subject entitled the letter to the romans and it's the second message with the subtitle of the manifestation of the sons of god we believe that this generation is a generation that will see the fullness of the manifestation of the sons of god this morning we do not have with us two of our brothers in brooklyn new york we were able to buy plane tickets for both brother lalo dries brother alex bruno jr they are both now right now in brooklyn new york assembly i also would like to say that the congregation of brother samuel johnson they paid and bought the tickets for both brother uh elliot colon and brother raul ramos to go to puerto rico they'll be leaving september 7th god willing let god help our brothers brother eddie sanchez is also sending greetings from the state of colorado the young man that's there right now several people have already asked for christian baptisms surely god has to bring out his predestinated seed regardless of where it says of those called [Music] elected [Music] commission anointed to tell mankind manifestation of the sons of god we're not waiting for a future time but rather this time that we're not living the manifestation of sons of god [Music] what belongs to is a real estate a home a car or a boat that's property to take possession of that property it's like one that receives a position of to be just mediocre she's the one that's leading her [Music] [Music] this is bless us now as we approach the word and father that knows the reason that i'm approaching the word from this very scripture here it's because i feel that you want me to do it this way that it's your divine will it's in your order it's the order of the [Laughter] to let the people positionally find their place and be ready for the hour [Laughter] each one of us has to find our position just like the brother said in his prayer to you not long ago oh you in order for them a degree or position of dignity [Laughter] [Laughter] but this time there should be children of god that are mature can you say that ranks apart from the adoption our sonship and godship we said that the first was a relationship of a son to a father and the other word in english significa godhead divinity deity the scripture and brother said that the man lost his place he lost his [Laughter] they say that people are so fanatical that they believe that man is god i want you to understand if you don't understand anything else for you to understand this that out of god's children our gods [Music] so if we i showed you the pyramid [Laughter] [Laughter] we have but sometimes we overlook those small things we have already said i've spoken about that first part upon which the foundation is based on do i have the holy [Music] seems like the question is still in the hearts of the people that hear the message how simple the message is the bible says that we do not have faith except we've been born again god's forgiveness [Laughter] [Laughter] is which are seven virtues [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] [Laughter] is [Music] what do you think that is is the holy ghost so i'm going to start reading a little bit to be able to just kind of settle down establish that little part yes and then i don't know an adoption [Music] throughout the years so that way you can stand firm there won't be a devil to move there's a lot of devils a lot of demons and they try to move but once you know who you are once again [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] because [Music] [Applause] if i'm a right inheritance of something if god is knocking in my heart and saying william branham i called you a long time ago before the foundation of the world to preach the gospel i have an inheritance and inheritance of eternal life now god has sent jesus to make that inheritance real to me because there was nothing i could do to inherit it it was blank it was valid but god in the fullness of time god sent in his own good time jesus a lamb slain from the before the foundation of the world his blood was shared that i might go to my inheritance but i said okay did you know that that man that are sons of god are amateur gods how many ever know that how many knows that jesus said so the bible says jesus said the officer did not [Laughter] [Music] just like brother chuck is and i was walking already i walked right by him and i said hi buddy [Music] but the man had the meaning over animals these days dogs will not no longer bite again to receive a kingdom of peace except the manifestation of the sons of god comes now that they were gods and he lost his god [Laughter] [Applause] scripture always used to raise up or bring up a lot of questions in me and i like to read it so that you can see it even though it doesn't go along with the subject but i'd want you to see it so you can not see it revelations 3 and verse 9. remember that part that i just finished saying a couple of minutes ago how many of you know the message also said [Music] disobedience i know that you so about to give birth to a baby the baby's in the boat of that it's a spirit already that's gonna go enter into that baby is it right deep [Music] behold i will make them of the synagogue of satan which say they are jews and are not i will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that i have loved thee it's a scripture that even though i had mentioned a lot it used to just astonish me but i believe that [Applause] is is that right [Music] a city and the houses are not finished and that's what happens and i was asked who lives in this house who lives in your house [Music] lives time to put on the ceiling so that it won't leak in other words you have to seal the house so nothing can come against the house it's placed on the house the son of god honey you're mine they say come here honey you're mine and you're mine also honey you're hugging your kids you embrace each other christ is jesus christ that's inside so let us go back return now he gave him a dominion over all things we are waiting for the manifestations of the sons of god who will come back and take when the power of god will walk out belongs to god can understand it [Music] [Applause] her husband you'll see that [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
