going to speak on this morning is within the complete Plan of Redemption uh apocalypses I'm just going to bring a little portion of the scripture Revelations 3 14. the uh foreign before we read the scripture I'd like to thank everybody's efforts will be with us this morning [Music] we're going to entitle the title this morning I canceled thee yes that's the title we're taking from the scripture yes we're going to go to Revelations 3 14. the title we're taking it from a message to brother Bernie Garcia preached he entitled the message buying gold he preached this message uh 17 years ago 50 years ago 50 years ago I'm sorry May 17 1973 that's about 50 years we're going to speak a little portion of this expecting that it'll be helped for everyone Revelations 3 14 you know the scripture this is right these things saith the amen and faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God sobres I know that works at our art neither cold nor hot I would have that word called orhat estibio Caliente so then because Thou Art look warm neither cold nor hot I was building out of my mouth this is Rico is because thou says I am rich and increased with Goods made of nothing and Noah said no it's not that thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked portanto yote compressor in Fuego Rico is Trident fire that thou mayest be rich in a white Raymond that thou mayest to be clothed nudes and that the shame of the inequities do not appear and anoint with isaf that is as many as I love I rebuke and chase them be serious therefore repent amen Brothers small portion that we read uh the E hero ah musliment I'm gonna focus on one scripture only the title that we're gonna speak on is I counsel thee an apocalypses Revelations 3 18 . there's something outstanding here three little things I want you to take an account the description obviously corresponds to this last age you'll notice that this is the only church age k El angel that the angel or the Lord it tells the church [Music] and all the rest of the church ages he had something against them but in this age is going to counsel giving advice to this church he's given the answer or the the way out to this generation so it's good for us to know what this is the first thing is that's right take the message receiving Gods advice this morning he's telling us directly okay to buy with me gold I tried and Fire that we are in the generation and like that in the age where there is more Darkness and it's so dark that people can't see who they are they don't know they're men or women that's how dark this church is among other things that are happening but the Lord in his grace I will cancel the foreign unhappy it's very simple yes thank the Lord for the message gives us the key here in the message paragraph 190. This is the word of God says but the goal that Jesus gives is it's the Holy Spirit the golden oil of the spirit so the Rama then Force into your heart and oh my console of you then Oro is the perfect oh yes the Holy Spirit to understand a little bit more let us go to the scripture first Peter once to understand what's the goal is and we hope that at the end of the service many can understand the riches in the Lord First Peter 1 7 says foreign with fire might be found and to praise and honor and Glory at the appearance of Jesus Christ let us go to the scripture now our faith will be tried that's what it's telling us here our faith will be tried and that trial will be more precious than gold even though gold it will end it is our faith will be tried amen amen how many of you want to buy gold our faith will be tried yes surrender to me surrender to the Lord Jesus the goal that you need yes and that gold is mold our characters if everything was easy everyone would be successful it's hard greater and precious than gold itself scripture continues saying that or saying about that first Peter 4 12 says the word is so beautiful so tremendous is not strange concerning the fiery trial trial which is as though some strange thing happened unto you this is extra don't don't be awesome when the fiery Trials come don't let it be a strange thing unto you why because and those that want to buy gold that character what character of the word that's why James 1 2 tells us want to buy gold yeah very few one gold this is look at how hard this is when he fall into diverse Temptations how is this how will we be happy tells us about the next verse tells us I Surrender be the name of the Lord that's why we have trials and We complain is different levels we all have trials the trial you're in now yes it's it's what we need is nothing greater than Wicked overcome will come to us foreign we passed the rebuke then we are legitimate can you imagine this God is testing us it's testing everyone so get out of us what's inside of us we're going to be convinced are we going to take the test you want to buy gold forever [Laughter] the holy spirit will do exactly what he did with Jesus man okay you're scary rich in the Lord righteous in the Lord in God's blessings [Music] don't think of the riches here it reaches in the Lord comprador is Revelations 3 18 the second part with the goals with the riches white arrangement amen amen this is what the word tells us the second thing is but he wants us to be rich so we can buy the arraignment Isaiah 61-10 no this is why bester means I will greatly rejoicing the Lord and my soul shall be joyful and my Lord for he has clothed me with the garments of Salvation he has covered me with the Robes of righteousness as a bridegroom decking himself with ormonds and as a bride adoreth herself with the jewels how did he dress as well with garments of Salvation And The Robe of righteousness those that's what the word is telling us Revelations 1970. it's more clear more simple let us speak louder for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife has hath made herself ready siente porque Lino yes clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints in English I like how it says in English but it tells us here clean and white Blanco okay it says here clean and white in English it's something that that shines it's white foreign [Music] this is you understand the prophet tells us paragraph number two he's telling us about the scripture here the compressed vestibular as blank as the hell he said I can't so did you come and buy white arraignment from him the Bible say it said the white robes are righteous righteousness of saints why because we need to be dressed amen amen is Carlos the righteousness of the Saints this is the second thing now the third thing foreign [Music] Santo daily ghost of the Holy Ghost um amen entonces so then one of the three things maybe a little bit tired but that's fine I do this for a purpose so that we can understand what time we are in case what's happening now around us this is the prophet tells us in the same message paragraph 297. is speaking here on the denominations wise and foolish virgins I were foolish and fire for wise foreign there and don't say this is the scripture tells us there was a cry yeah the bridegroom cometh come out ye to receive him and the ten virgins some of them know that they have oil General Awakening in other words because they've heard the cryother the big and fine churches are doing today Las organizations organizations they know they need it what is the word tells us there is an abundance then there will be enough yes what happened the Lord come came amen amen ities February 8th of 2020. the Holy Spirit fell down on the Asbury College Revival ended March 1st they could not stop this movement this is a regular service but the Holy Spirit came down and called up to people in other parts of the Holy Spirit they started this movement the atmosphere that was created they wanted was inside car was moving in this place did you believe this yes I do is Jesus he tells us in the message foreign foreign continue students California school and Revival continued across the U.S is published last month April 5th and CBN News even the news they data from this California California is Los Angeles mean are we buying gold um they are Awakening this is a church age paragraph 297. notice what the prophet says when they went to get the oil here is one you already have it you don't need to buy it anymore you already have it let your bodies and let him decide for you um salvation has nothing to do with your faults it's yours in the Holy Spirit oh the Wilderness understands you'll be there by yourself what are you gonna do to be tested but this trying to get it right now organizations we got to get back to the Pentecostal blessing okay foreign because they also want to get dressed when that happens foreign foreign would come and those who had the oil on their lamps and went away what happened and what happened foreign period [Music] in a nation of teeth varieties in heaven oh wait a minute oh my God this is what's happening now you don't know what I'm going through I might not understand it and I don't want to understand it one thing I will tell you that you would make your decision and dare to believe and everything that's within you is by his stripes just believe it is no one here is saved by works he is the only one that's right and his righteousness when it comes to your life it's not your righteousness his righteousness foreign they cry out foreign heads is someone needs prayer the Ministries here whatever you need nobody might understand it but this is the challenge worldwide you want to buy goldendo distance [Music] you are cones [Music] so that you may be rich yeah we will do things possible yes for you [Music] buying gold or trials I think we all have the trials every one

are disobedient to the council [Music] thank you that's the concern I've always had as brother Javier said you may not understand it be obedient to it someone knows many times it's not you I'm gonna
