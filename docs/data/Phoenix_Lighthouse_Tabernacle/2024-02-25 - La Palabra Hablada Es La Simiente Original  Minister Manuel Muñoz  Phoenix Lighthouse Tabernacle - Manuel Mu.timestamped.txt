[1:01:27] time it' be so kind please open up your
[1:01:31] scriptures we'll be using our base
[1:01:33] scripture
[1:01:36] uhis which is in Genesis
[1:01:46] 1 we can indicate with an amen once you
[1:01:49] have
[1:01:53] it the Bible reads in the beginning God
[1:01:56] created the Heaven and the
[1:02:06] Earth and the Earth was without form and
[1:02:08] void and darkness was upon the face of
[1:02:10] the deep and the spirit of God moved
[1:02:12] upon the face of the
[1:02:15] waters and God said let there be light
[1:02:18] and there was
[1:02:23] light
[1:02:25] and God saw the light that it was good
[1:02:27] and God divided the light from the
[1:02:30] [Music]
[1:02:34] darkness and God called the light day
[1:02:36] and the Darkness he called night and the
[1:02:38] evening and the morning were the first
[1:02:42] day I'd like to jump to verse
[1:02:53] 11
[1:03:00] and God said let the Earth bring forth
[1:03:02] grass the herb yielding seed and the
[1:03:03] fruit true yielding fruit after its kind
[1:03:06] who seed is in itself upon the Earth and
[1:03:08] it was
[1:03:16] [Music]
[1:03:22] so and the Earth brought forth grass and
[1:03:24] Herb yielding seed after its kind and
[1:03:26] the true yielding fruit whose seed was
[1:03:29] in itself after its kind and God saw
[1:03:31] that it was
[1:03:34] good and the evening and the morning
[1:03:36] were the third
[1:03:38] day now I'd like to read another
[1:03:40] scripture
[1:03:42] in it'd be in John chapter
[1:03:53] 1
[1:03:55] [Music]
[1:04:01] the first first verse reads in the
[1:04:02] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:04:04] with God and the Word was
[1:04:08] God the same was in the beginning with
[1:04:16] God all things were made by him and
[1:04:18] without him was not anything made that
[1:04:20] was
[1:04:23] made
[1:04:25] in him was life and the life was the
[1:04:27] light of
[1:04:35] men and the light shineth in darkness
[1:04:37] and the Darkness comprehended it
[1:04:40] not let us
[1:04:42] pray Heavenly
[1:04:45] Father Here we are this morning
[1:04:48] Father Lord you saw this scene
[1:04:51] already even before the foundation of
[1:04:53] the world
[1:04:56] you knew who would be here this morning
[1:05:00] Lord you need each person that would be
[1:05:02] watching us throughout the
[1:05:04] [Music]
[1:05:07] means you know the heart of each one of
[1:05:09] us
[1:05:11] father Lord you know our
[1:05:16] needs you know us even better than we
[1:05:18] know ourselves
[1:05:19] father we ask you this morning
[1:05:22] Father we open up our Hearts to
[1:05:26] thee to us this morning
[1:05:29] Lord and give us that which we
[1:05:33] need Lord I have no words
[1:05:36] father I trust in you this morning
[1:05:39] Father you be able to speak to every
[1:05:41] heart Holy
[1:05:43] Father give us what we need
[1:05:46] father because we trust in
[1:05:49] you we put ourselves in your hands this
[1:05:51] morning we give you thanks for
[1:05:53] everything
[1:05:55] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:57] amen
[1:05:58] amen you may take your seats
[1:06:02] Brothers
[1:06:06] um it's a surprise for me to be
[1:06:12] here they told me I would be preaching
[1:06:14] on the last Sunday of the month in
[1:06:18] February and it feels like they just
[1:06:20] told me
[1:06:23] yesterday
[1:06:25] for me right now it's currently a very
[1:06:28] difficult time for those that know
[1:06:31] me this is my main time of
[1:06:35] work and many times it's
[1:06:39] difficult to make time because time is
[1:06:41] only 24 hours a
[1:06:45] day sometimes I say why did they only
[1:06:47] give us 24
[1:06:52] hours but sometimes it is
[1:06:56] us we're the ones that don't know how to
[1:06:58] manage our
[1:07:00] time we are Our Own Worst
[1:07:07] Enemy and I'm not a person who's out of
[1:07:09] the
[1:07:14] ordinary I'm always going against
[1:07:19] time I believe brother bam says that
[1:07:22] time is the worst enemy of man
[1:07:27] sometimes we think we have time to do
[1:07:28] this or do the
[1:07:31] other but then all of a sudden we find
[1:07:33] ourselves out of
[1:07:34] time in this time that we live
[1:07:39] in it feels like time is going to get
[1:07:41] much
[1:07:42] faster I remember when I was
[1:07:46] young I when you want I already wanted
[1:07:48] to be 21 years
[1:07:52] old things that perhaps children could
[1:07:55] not
[1:07:57] do the other day one of my
[1:08:00] clients I told him oh I would like to go
[1:08:03] back in
[1:08:04] time he was 33 years
[1:08:07] old I told him I would love to be 33
[1:08:10] years
[1:08:11] old but I thank
[1:08:13] God for all the experiences for all the
[1:08:17] trials for everything we go
[1:08:21] through because everything that we go
[1:08:22] through Brothers it's for a
[1:08:26] purpose all the good times and all the
[1:08:29] bad
[1:08:30] times and we didn't have bad
[1:08:33] times then we would be able to
[1:08:34] appreciate the good
[1:08:37] times and many times we
[1:08:39] complain because it's too hot or because
[1:08:42] it's too
[1:08:44] cold it feels like we're never
[1:08:47] satisfied but I believe that God he
[1:08:50] gives us what we need
[1:08:55] to place us in our
[1:08:59] position truly for me
[1:09:02] um I have seen my
[1:09:06] brothers speaking on the topic of the
[1:09:09] spoken word is the Original
[1:09:13] Seed and it's a very large
[1:09:18] topic sometimes I look at the
[1:09:21] cake and I like to grab some from here
[1:09:24] or grab some from over
[1:09:26] here but this
[1:09:28] morning I want to stay a little bit
[1:09:33] simple believe God hides himself reveals
[1:09:36] in
[1:09:39] Simplicity many things we complicate
[1:09:44] things we want to understand it in a
[1:09:47] certain
[1:09:49] way but God is
[1:09:52] simple
[1:09:54] God is a God who hides and reveals
[1:09:56] himself in
[1:09:58] Simplicity and he's brought us a great
[1:10:00] message through a great
[1:10:03] prophet and that was the simplest
[1:10:06] way so that we could all
[1:10:11] understand but sometimes we
[1:10:15] overthink understand this that or the
[1:10:18] other but I believe that there are
[1:10:21] Mysteries there are many Mysteries in
[1:10:23] the
[1:10:26] Bible but God gives us according to how
[1:10:29] we
[1:10:29] grow it's just like a
[1:10:34] child there are certain things you don't
[1:10:36] talk about with them until they reach a
[1:10:38] certain
[1:10:41] maturity you can talk about other things
[1:10:43] with them at that point and I believe
[1:10:45] that God is the same
[1:10:47] way he gives
[1:10:50] us according to what we are needing
[1:10:58] this morning I'd like to speak a little
[1:10:59] bit on the topic of the original
[1:11:02] seed for me
[1:11:08] Brothers God has G me certain
[1:11:10] understanding if I could say it that way
[1:11:13] when my eyes were
[1:11:19] opened that we're the same material as
[1:11:21] our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:11:24] truly when he died at the
[1:11:30] cross the Bible says that he was hurt by
[1:11:32] a
[1:11:35] spear and water and blood fell onto the
[1:11:38] Earth and for
[1:11:41] me I can see that that's where the bride
[1:11:44] tree was
[1:11:46] planted and that's where I was that's
[1:11:50] where you were
[1:11:52] brother that the Bible says that he came
[1:11:54] to his
[1:11:56] own for they knew him
[1:11:58] not but he gave
[1:12:00] power so all those that could believe in
[1:12:03] him they can be
[1:12:05] saved and they would be called a Son of
[1:12:09] God so through
[1:12:12] adoption he has called us
[1:12:15] children but we have come out of
[1:12:18] him we're the same
[1:12:22] material sometimes when I speak with
[1:12:25] couples I say sometimes we struggle to
[1:12:29] understand when your
[1:12:33] couple where did Eve come
[1:12:36] from she came from the riv of
[1:12:39] Adam she came from his own
[1:12:42] body and it's the same
[1:12:46] material and nowaday I can
[1:12:49] understand that God is in each one of
[1:12:51] his children a portion of God in each
[1:12:56] one of
[1:12:59] us that's why when you can reach the
[1:13:01] understanding
[1:13:05] of says when the bride recognizes who
[1:13:07] she
[1:13:09] is is nothing that can stand in your
[1:13:13] way the words that you
[1:13:18] ask you desire what you ask for with
[1:13:20] your
[1:13:22] words you are a a a meaning God
[1:13:27] a you can bring Gods into existence
[1:13:30] world world you can be sorry you can be
[1:13:32] worlds into
[1:13:33] existence you have the power with your
[1:13:39] words that's why we have to be very
[1:13:41] careful what we speak what we
[1:13:45] say because those words come
[1:13:49] out and they're recorded in time
[1:13:54] and those words have
[1:13:58] power I speak with certain people
[1:14:02] brothers and I notice how they direct
[1:14:04] themselves towards their
[1:14:07] children some I say oh you're a
[1:14:10] dummy or you're so
[1:14:16] foolish when I hear those words I'd like
[1:14:18] to get them and tell them say because
[1:14:21] that is what you are creating or
[1:14:24] raising because when you talk to your
[1:14:26] child in that
[1:14:28] manner that is what you are
[1:14:31] creating we have to be
[1:14:33] careful how we speak to our
[1:14:36] children as
[1:14:38] parents we want the best for
[1:14:42] them but we have to be very
[1:14:46] careful because we are
[1:14:48] creatures in our words they have
[1:14:52] power so it's better to say God bless
[1:14:56] you or my son how smart you are what a
[1:15:00] good job you did keep
[1:15:03] going those words are much
[1:15:08] better because you're creating an
[1:15:10] atmosphere you're creating a world
[1:15:13] there so then we have to be careful
[1:15:16] because our words they have
[1:15:22] power truly with my
[1:15:25] family try to teach them or show
[1:15:29] them sometimes how to
[1:15:33] speak because sometimes we say things
[1:15:35] that we
[1:15:36] shouldn't sometimes we say joking around
[1:15:39] I hate you like for example
[1:15:43] saying it's a very strong
[1:15:46] word sometimes we say just joking
[1:15:48] playing
[1:15:49] around but truly we shouldn't do that
[1:15:53] it's better to say I love
[1:15:56] you because our words have power we can
[1:16:00] bless or we can
[1:16:04] curse and truly we need to be very
[1:16:06] careful with
[1:16:08] that truly for
[1:16:13] me when I see the power of our
[1:16:18] words you have that power
[1:16:21] brother because if the seat of God is
[1:16:24] inside of you if God is in your
[1:16:28] heart then you can ask what you
[1:16:31] may and God will give it to you but you
[1:16:34] have to believe it when you have that
[1:16:37] revelation of who you
[1:16:40] are don't be afraid to ask from
[1:16:43] God many times we limit God I was one of
[1:16:47] them
[1:16:49] brother I would say how is God going to
[1:16:51] give me this
[1:16:55] sometimes you make yourself small or
[1:16:58] unworthy but truly
[1:17:00] Brothers if we knew who we are we are
[1:17:04] the
[1:17:07] best Carlos I think I now remember our
[1:17:09] Brother
[1:17:11] Carlos he said it once I believe it was
[1:17:13] in
[1:17:14] Africa and I like to repeat it because I
[1:17:18] believe
[1:17:19] it just like when a
[1:17:22] team
[1:17:25] when they're tied and they're going into
[1:17:28] overtime they send in their best
[1:17:32] players and if right now we're in the
[1:17:34] end
[1:17:36] time and time is already at its
[1:17:42] end we are those that God has placed in
[1:17:45] this
[1:17:46] time when we were over
[1:17:49] there we
[1:17:50] chose to be here
[1:17:55] knowing that this is the most dangerous
[1:17:58] time it's the most deceitful time but
[1:18:04] why why is it the most dangerous and
[1:18:06] deceitful
[1:18:08] time because right now as the last time
[1:18:11] I
[1:18:12] spoke there is many
[1:18:16] religions there's many people who go to
[1:18:19] church and they think that they're doing
[1:18:21] right
[1:18:23] and the Devil is a good adversary
[1:18:29] brother sometimes he knows the exact way
[1:18:31] to approach
[1:18:33] us and truly
[1:18:37] Brothers he knows our exact
[1:18:41] [Music]
[1:18:43] weaknesses and for me it's been quite
[1:18:45] the
[1:18:51] battle
[1:18:55] because I'm a person that truly
[1:18:57] sometimes I
[1:18:58] struggle I make myself
[1:19:03] small I like how they say I don't like
[1:19:05] to be in the
[1:19:08] spotlight but I know that God has a
[1:19:13] purpose we shouldn't hide the gift that
[1:19:15] God has placed in our
[1:19:19] heart you have words to share with your
[1:19:21] brothers
[1:19:24] that can give life to a
[1:19:27] brother God has given me the privilege
[1:19:29] to travel with my
[1:19:32] pastor sometimes I feel like what am I
[1:19:35] doing
[1:19:36] here but I trust in
[1:19:39] God and I seen his Almighty hand in my
[1:19:45] life and I I believe that he has dealt
[1:19:48] with each one of us
[1:19:50] here this church we see that is under
[1:19:52] under
[1:19:54] construction and that is sometimes how I
[1:19:56] myself
[1:19:58] feel just like that old colored lady
[1:20:02] said I'm not what I ought to
[1:20:05] be but I know I'm not what I used to
[1:20:09] be and it's a step it's a path it's a
[1:20:14] battle but the most difficult brother
[1:20:16] Bernie says is to
[1:20:19] Die the seed
[1:20:21] Brothers has to die
[1:20:24] it has to
[1:20:25] rot so that it can bring forth
[1:20:28] life if you have a seed here brother and
[1:20:31] you don't plant
[1:20:34] it you don't place it in the dirt so
[1:20:37] that it may die it may rot then it can't
[1:20:40] bring forth
[1:20:41] life and that is what we have to
[1:20:44] do we have to die to our own
[1:20:48] ideas we have to die to our own
[1:20:51] thoughts that's the most difficult
[1:20:54] brother brother brandham says who wants
[1:20:56] to die Bernie brother Bernie says who
[1:20:59] wants to
[1:21:01] die he says we need a
[1:21:03] massacre we need to
[1:21:05] die to our thoughts to our ideas to our
[1:21:11] theories so that God may come
[1:21:15] in that's why Paul
[1:21:17] said no longer I that live but Christ
[1:21:20] lives in me
[1:21:23] we need to surrender ourselves
[1:21:24] completely to
[1:21:25] him but in this
[1:21:30] time there's a lot of self-centered
[1:21:32] people or selfish people just like
[1:21:36] La they fight for their
[1:21:40] rights have their rights of this or this
[1:21:42] rights of
[1:21:44] that this time we felt art Lots live
[1:21:48] in where everybody is fighting for their
[1:21:51] rights that's the time we are living in
[1:21:55] but for the bride
[1:21:56] Brothers there's been an escape
[1:22:00] door a door that you can enter
[1:22:03] in a door that is
[1:22:06] open enter in through that door and
[1:22:10] escape this
[1:22:12] age and that door is the Lord Jesus
[1:22:14] Christ he is the
[1:22:17] answer all of our
[1:22:21] problems problems that you could be
[1:22:24] having anything that you're going
[1:22:28] through he is
[1:22:30] willing and he is
[1:22:32] waiting so you may cry unto
[1:22:36] him sometimes he allows us to get
[1:22:38] ourselves in those
[1:22:40] situations so that you
[1:22:42] may seek him out
[1:22:47] more just as we heard the story of that
[1:22:51] Shepherd
[1:22:54] that he broke the leg of that lamb or
[1:22:56] that
[1:22:59] sheep many might think well that's a
[1:23:01] very bad
[1:23:03] Shepherd but truly he says no is that I
[1:23:07] love her so
[1:23:09] much that I always want to have her by
[1:23:11] my
[1:23:12] side and that is how God is with
[1:23:16] us he wants to have fellowship with his
[1:23:20] children he wants to conversate with us
[1:23:25] just like a father with his
[1:23:27] children he wants to have that
[1:23:29] Fellowship Brothers forgive me
[1:23:33] Brothers I wanted to have a
[1:23:37] presentation I want to have something
[1:23:38] that we could display on the
[1:23:42] screens I tell you time is always
[1:23:44] against
[1:23:46] us and truly
[1:23:48] Brothers I give thanks to
[1:23:51] God
[1:23:53] for everything that he has done for
[1:23:56] us because all the trials that he has
[1:23:58] given
[1:24:00] us it's to place us in our
[1:24:04] position it's to place us where we
[1:24:06] should
[1:24:10] be the way back and the brother BR Mage
[1:24:14] the way
[1:24:16] back i' like to read this short
[1:24:19] paragraph because I believe in my heart
[1:24:21] brother
[1:24:23] that's the most
[1:24:26] important is to be born
[1:24:29] again because any other
[1:24:33] way we think that we could know this
[1:24:36] that or the
[1:24:37] other and it's good to
[1:24:40] know but we have to be
[1:24:42] certain that we have been born
[1:24:46] again because that's the only
[1:24:48] way that we can enter
[1:24:51] in
[1:24:53] and that sea that God has deposited in
[1:24:56] US SE that's each each one of his
[1:25:00] children who that sooner or
[1:25:02] later it has to come
[1:25:05] forth it has to burst open has to come
[1:25:09] forth you have to be the same as God to
[1:25:13] be like Jesus that's why we sing that
[1:25:15] song to be like Jesus be like
[1:25:18] Christ that is what we desire that is
[1:25:22] what
[1:25:23] want because it's the most important
[1:25:27] thing knowing that we have been born
[1:25:30] again and that we are part of
[1:25:33] him because in this
[1:25:37] walk there's many dece there's many ways
[1:25:40] there's many
[1:25:43] paths even the Bible say there's path to
[1:25:46] a man appear to be
[1:25:49] straight but we know that there is only
[1:25:51] one path
[1:25:53] and that is the Lord Jesus
[1:25:55] Christ on the the way back
[1:26:00] says he says
[1:26:06] listen any birth is a
[1:26:12] mess I don't care whether it's in a pig
[1:26:14] pen
[1:26:16] or or where it is
[1:26:20] atess it is a mess
[1:26:24] any
[1:26:26] birth and so in
[1:26:30] birth so the new birth will make you do
[1:26:33] things that you didn't think you would
[1:26:35] ever
[1:26:37] do but it brings
[1:26:41] life and before you can have
[1:26:44] life you have to have
[1:26:47] death he says before a
[1:26:51] seed
[1:26:52] can reproduce
[1:26:55] itself it's got
[1:26:58] to it's got to die in order
[1:27:02] uh not only
[1:27:05] die but it's got to
[1:27:09] rot in order to get new
[1:27:13] life and it's got to die and rot in
[1:27:16] itself and so does every sinner every
[1:27:21] man no matter how highly he's
[1:27:24] educated or how much he is
[1:27:27] polished or how many degrees he has in
[1:27:30] the
[1:27:32] church or so
[1:27:36] forth or how many colleges he is
[1:27:39] educated out
[1:27:41] of he has got to
[1:27:43] die to his own
[1:27:46] theory he has to die to
[1:27:50] himself he has to die
[1:27:53] to
[1:27:56] everything to be reborn
[1:27:59] Again by the Holy
[1:28:01] Ghost it will make him
[1:28:04] cry it will make him speak in
[1:28:06] tongues and jump up and
[1:28:09] down and carry on like a
[1:28:13] maniac but he has got new
[1:28:17] life and that's what it
[1:28:20] takes he has to got to have new
[1:28:24] life so then Brothers the
[1:28:29] seed planted in each heart of each Son
[1:28:32] of
[1:28:33] God but in order for it to give
[1:28:37] life there has to be a new birth we have
[1:28:41] to die to our way of
[1:28:44] thinking and that's the most difficult
[1:28:47] part because who wants to
[1:28:50] die fight each day
[1:28:55] says that it's a daily
[1:28:57] [Music]
[1:28:59] fight it's you fight inch by
[1:29:02] inch and in this life we will
[1:29:07] fight to reach our
[1:29:11] goal but the fight doesn't have to be
[1:29:13] you on yourself by
[1:29:15] yourself that's a problem many
[1:29:20] times I'm somebody who tries to do
[1:29:22] things on my
[1:29:24] [Music]
[1:29:25] own I have learned through my
[1:29:30] mistakes truly sometimes it is better to
[1:29:32] ask for
[1:29:35] help God is waiting for us sometimes he
[1:29:38] lets
[1:29:39] us he lets us make a
[1:29:42] mistake so that we can learn the
[1:29:45] lesson and truly that is how we learn
[1:29:49] Brothers sometimes through our mistakes
[1:29:53] to be able to learn the
[1:29:54] [Music]
[1:29:56] lesson but we don't always need to make
[1:29:59] the same
[1:30:01] mistakes on an occasion I was speaking
[1:30:03] with my
[1:30:06] wife she says why do we always make the
[1:30:08] same
[1:30:10] mistake honestly she was talking about
[1:30:15] me she says if you know that this is
[1:30:17] going to
[1:30:19] happen why do you do it then
[1:30:22] and truly
[1:30:30] Brothers I believe I've heard once that
[1:30:32] what is the definition
[1:30:35] of what is insanity
[1:30:40] insanity is to do the same thing over
[1:30:42] and
[1:30:44] over and expect a different
[1:30:47] result and truly
[1:30:49] Brothers we have to learn from our
[1:30:53] mistakes but God is there to help
[1:30:56] us you don't have to do it on your
[1:30:59] own you can grab onto God's hand and
[1:31:03] with
[1:31:04] him all things are
[1:31:09] possible we want to do it
[1:31:11] ourselves knowing that God is
[1:31:14] there waiting on
[1:31:17] you the Bible says that he is a
[1:31:20] gentleman he is at the door he is
[1:31:24] waiting he may surrender
[1:31:27] to a a completely surrendered
[1:31:31] heart but we're the ones that Harden
[1:31:35] ourselves and we don't let him come
[1:31:38] inside we're the ones that put a Hal to
[1:31:41] God brother Bernie
[1:31:43] says how much time will it
[1:31:46] last until as long as you want
[1:31:50] it you're the one who holding God
[1:31:53] back he is willing he is
[1:31:56] ready he wants to give you
[1:31:59] everything but he is waiting on
[1:32:02] you you're holding God
[1:32:05] back we could be on at the bench for 20
[1:32:10] years many brothers have given that
[1:32:14] testimony they been at the bench on the
[1:32:16] Pew for 20
[1:32:18] years many times it's because ourselves
[1:32:22] we hold ourselves back but we have to
[1:32:24] let loose we have to exercise our faith
[1:32:28] if we're children of God then ask to God
[1:32:32] he will do it brother his children
[1:32:35] whatever you want any
[1:32:38] need he's ready to give it to
[1:32:41] us he wants to give
[1:32:43] us more than we can ask
[1:32:47] for so then that
[1:32:49] seed has been deposited
[1:32:53] in each heart of each children of God
[1:32:56] and what do we have to
[1:32:57] do if I plant a
[1:33:00] seed and I place it in the Earth or in
[1:33:02] the
[1:33:03] ground and if I don't water it it will
[1:33:07] not
[1:33:09] grow brother Bram also tells
[1:33:12] us that we have to water
[1:33:15] that we have to give water to
[1:33:18] it so that it can grow
[1:33:23] so I can give
[1:33:24] fruits look brother a
[1:33:27] seed as small as it
[1:33:30] is let's say that it's an orange
[1:33:32] [Applause]
[1:33:34] seed all the oranges that that tree will
[1:33:37] give already inside of that
[1:33:42] seed imagine what God has deposited in
[1:33:44] each one of
[1:33:45] [Applause]
[1:33:46] us everything that God deposited in
[1:33:50] you you
[1:33:52] need is to take you from this Earth
[1:33:55] until your
[1:33:58] home we're just passing a temporary
[1:34:04] time a time frame that God permitted for
[1:34:06] each one of
[1:34:07] us but this is not our
[1:34:12] home this home that we live
[1:34:14] in house that we live
[1:34:17] in it's a temporary
[1:34:20] body
[1:34:22] but we have
[1:34:23] a we have a
[1:34:27] representation and that is what we day
[1:34:29] after day we should be seeking seeking
[1:34:33] more of
[1:34:34] God because truly
[1:34:37] Brothers we can possess all
[1:34:42] things but you will take nothing with
[1:34:45] you sometimes we worry about bills we
[1:34:48] wor about our house for our cars
[1:34:52] for all of those things but
[1:34:56] truly we will not be taking
[1:34:59] anything this is not my home I'm simply
[1:35:02] walking
[1:35:05] through and God has provided a home a
[1:35:09] home for each one of his
[1:35:12] children and truly that is the
[1:35:17] purpose that is why we came to this
[1:35:20] life to just go through and brother
[1:35:23] Bernie
[1:35:25] says our
[1:35:27] decisions they equal our
[1:35:31] destiny God gives us we're free moral
[1:35:35] agents we have to
[1:35:38] decide you have to make that
[1:35:40] decision to follow
[1:35:43] God he is a gentleman he's not going to
[1:35:46] force
[1:35:47] you he is waiting on
[1:35:50] you
[1:35:52] you now that's what I would like for us
[1:35:54] to
[1:35:56] understand because many times one is the
[1:35:58] one who's holding him
[1:36:00] back God wants to use your
[1:36:03] hands he wants to use your mouth or your
[1:36:07] voice he wants to
[1:36:10] use but he needs a surrendered body
[1:36:14] completely surrendered to now I can
[1:36:17] understand when brother Bernie
[1:36:20] says that it's God
[1:36:23] Christ he has to be your
[1:36:27] brother for me I didn't understand
[1:36:31] that but as you become the same as God
[1:36:35] now I can
[1:36:37] understand why you can pray for brother
[1:36:40] brother Bernie says you get to the
[1:36:44] point where God no longer
[1:36:49] intercedes and now you can inter
[1:36:52] for your
[1:36:54] brothers if you are like God then you
[1:36:57] have the power give life to whomever you
[1:37:02] desire you have that power
[1:37:05] brother because God is in
[1:37:09] you when we reach that
[1:37:12] realization you are an amateur God or
[1:37:15] small
[1:37:19] God doing what God wants to
[1:37:23] do were the works of
[1:37:27] the when he poured himself out at
[1:37:29] [Music]
[1:37:31] Pentecost deposit in his people in his
[1:37:34] bride in his
[1:37:37] people and now you are doing The Works
[1:37:40] of the holy spirit
[1:37:43] says God can do nothing without
[1:37:47] man he needs
[1:37:50] man needs
[1:37:54] you he needs every son or daughter of
[1:37:58] God to be able to fulfill his
[1:38:02] plan but we have to
[1:38:04] surrender we have to ask of him for him
[1:38:08] to come
[1:38:10] in and open every
[1:38:13] [Music]
[1:38:16] window I know brother B talks about
[1:38:18] doors in the heart I know we have doors
[1:38:19] in our heart
[1:38:22] there some that we have things that are
[1:38:23] so
[1:38:26] secret that we don't want nobody to know
[1:38:29] about or very deep
[1:38:32] things but I want to open my
[1:38:37] heart I want God to go into the deepest
[1:38:39] part of my
[1:38:41] heart I don't want to have anything
[1:38:44] hidden because we are naked before
[1:38:48] God you can't hide from any you can't
[1:38:50] hide hide from God in anything he knows
[1:38:55] us so what are we going to
[1:38:57] hide we have our heart this morning
[1:39:01] brother and let him enter into
[1:39:05] us he can come in and water that
[1:39:09] seed so it may bring forth life and it
[1:39:12] can give
[1:39:15] fruits you have so many things to
[1:39:20] give because you are a small
[1:39:23] god you're an amateur God but it
[1:39:26] requires but it
[1:39:28] requires for you to surrender
[1:39:32] completely and die to our way of
[1:39:37] thinking to deny
[1:39:41] ourselves and that's the most difficult
[1:39:43] thing to do in this
[1:39:46] time when you begin to ask for stuff or
[1:39:49] acquire things or acquire things
[1:39:54] you begin to tie yourself with things
[1:39:55] like I like my house a lot I like this
[1:40:01] car it hurts you that even if they
[1:40:03] scratch
[1:40:06] it but that is all just
[1:40:09] vanity that is all
[1:40:12] vanity it does of no
[1:40:16] good the most important is what we have
[1:40:19] here
[1:40:23] truly God is good with
[1:40:27] us such a good and kind
[1:40:30] God that he's given us
[1:40:33] Grace it's not because we are good
[1:40:36] people it's not because we properly
[1:40:38] behave
[1:40:39] ourselves what is
[1:40:42] Grace it's an undeserving gift it's a
[1:40:46] gift from God it pleased him to give you
[1:40:53] not because you behave
[1:40:55] yourself not because you come from this
[1:40:58] family it is God's
[1:41:01] choosing he chose
[1:41:05] you decision that you would
[1:41:09] make because he knew that you would
[1:41:12] choose him and he chose you he chose
[1:41:17] me for this time
[1:41:19] brother to be able to
[1:41:22] fulfill God's
[1:41:25] plan and God has a purpose for each one
[1:41:28] of
[1:41:30] us I'd like to thank my
[1:41:32] pastor for the opportunity he gives
[1:41:35] me I know that his birthday is
[1:41:40] approaching I know that he's not
[1:41:42] here happy birthday but I'd like to tell
[1:41:44] him happy
[1:41:46] birthday truly for
[1:41:49] me
[1:41:51] when God opened up my
[1:41:53] eyes to be able to
[1:41:56] know who that person
[1:41:59] is is a very
[1:42:02] special for me he is very
[1:42:05] special just as brother Bernie brother
[1:42:11] brandham I would have liked to be with
[1:42:13] brother
[1:42:15] Bernie but now God gives me the
[1:42:19] opportunity to be with
[1:42:21] Monto a very special
[1:42:25] person and truly God places those
[1:42:28] people in our
[1:42:30] [Music]
[1:42:32] path to be able to help us to be able to
[1:42:36] guide
[1:42:38] us and the trust that he has in
[1:42:41] me I wouldn't would not like to let it
[1:42:45] down because to me he is a very special
[1:42:49] person and when I came to the
[1:42:52] lighthouse I
[1:42:56] struggled to say that brother Monto is
[1:42:59] my I don't know how many went through
[1:43:03] [Music]
[1:43:05] that but it was a struggle in my
[1:43:09] mind because we always had brother
[1:43:12] Bernie when God reveals to
[1:43:16] us who is behind that
[1:43:19] Veil then you can see
[1:43:22] God and that person that God has placed
[1:43:26] and that's the way God
[1:43:27] is he hides in
[1:43:30] Simplicity he hides behind the
[1:43:33] veil but we can look
[1:43:37] Beyond and see God in each one of our
[1:43:40] brothers because that is what God
[1:43:43] wants he wants to dwell in each
[1:43:47] heart he wants you to open that door so
[1:43:50] that he can enter
[1:43:52] in and dwell or abide in each one of
[1:43:56] us so kind of please
[1:44:00] stand time has gone
[1:44:04] by time goes by
[1:44:08] fast but this morning
[1:44:11] Brothers the most important
[1:44:15] thing is to die to our way of
[1:44:18] thinking die to our
[1:44:23] desires and let God come into our
[1:44:27] [Music]
[1:44:28] heart and let him do what he
[1:44:32] pleases with your
[1:44:36] life let it not be me that chooses what
[1:44:39] to
[1:44:40] [Music]
[1:44:45] do may be him who guides me and I can do
[1:44:48] what he
[1:44:49] wants
[1:44:51] because the worst thing that I want is
[1:44:53] to get
[1:44:55] there and think that I have done the
[1:44:57] right thing and be
[1:45:03] mistaken I want God to have complete
[1:45:05] control of my
[1:45:07] life I thank God for my
[1:45:11] parents truly God places the
[1:45:15] people the right
[1:45:17] people in your way
[1:45:21] let us pray Heavenly
[1:45:25] Father Lord you know my heart this
[1:45:30] morning for my mistakes and my
[1:45:33] errors Lord I am
