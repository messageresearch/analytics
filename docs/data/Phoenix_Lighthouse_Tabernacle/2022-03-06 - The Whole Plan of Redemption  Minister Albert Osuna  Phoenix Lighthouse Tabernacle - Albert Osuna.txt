actually able to see you a little bit more yeah we're wearing masks but that's okay things could be a lot worse so i'm happy that you're here this morning um greet our bread and also watching us online for internet our brother's watching us in san luis obis in san luis obispo brothers and all our brothers there god bless you he told us in iowa and all our other brethren whether you're watching us from miranda whether it's south america south america maybe in california california no matter where you're at and don't stay god bless you okay elsa because that heat you don't do it for me for me you don't do it for a pastor we're doing it for our lord jesus christ at calvary for you and for me and how do we pay him back with our lives by serving them by helping our brother what does the word say whatever you're doing to one of my sons and daughters because you're doing it to me i like those two words plan and redemption we're gonna focus a little bit on that in a second let us read our scripture hebrews 9 11 reads but christ being a high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building christmas foreign neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once in the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us verse 13 for if the blood of bulls and of ghosts and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spots of god purge your conscience from the dead works to serve the living god in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen god bless you brother please thank you again good morning yes um when they asked me to if not when they asked me when they told me that i was going to speak a little bit you know as soon as that i end the phone call right away you know you start battling in your mind we all battle in our minds right some people right now are battling uh physically though we all see the news we all know what's going on we see what's going on in the ukraine we see the news right now we see some horrible images you know we see families having to pick up and and leaving families can you imagine that you gotta just get whatever clothes you can and you're not just gonna get a bus outside their house and go you know some some could have driven out inside the house and these kids got to literally walk for hours day after day to try to make it to the border to be safe and sometimes we see the people migrating from south america over here and uh politics aside i mean i think we're going to do all we can for our children how busy how bad may they be going that they're willing to risk their life to get over here and that's what we see what's going on a little bit in the ukraine we see the people uh leaving being refugees in another country now do you think there's believers in the ukraine absolutely absolutely um you've heard of the app lifeline right the application lifeline it's from the voice of god recordings uh it's on that app in this application it tells you like for example today's the the sixth of march let's you scroll and you can even see the pictures of some of the brothers and right there the the the reporting on there and some of the representatives in holland and poland and romania romania uh orlando that's right and they've been able to help the brethren so i know you're praying for the people in ukraine and it's working brethren yes they're doing the best they can imagine they're there in good spirits trying to get out or my team didn't win on tv am i going to get upset my team didn't win am i going to get it i wanted everybody else's team to lose too if my team lost it's not a big deal anymore thank god because there's worse things hey man brother we're so blessed to be here though we're gathering our sanctuary we're super blessed so we gotta uh i try to tell my daughter and try to show it and not just tell her but redemption so the first time when we started reading about this month ago or maybe longer absolutely longer when we would be reading this i had a little bit of a hard time trying to get it so writing to the hebrews it's the jewish people so speaking to the jewish people he speaks a lot about their customs which we read in the in the old testament and the message the unpardonable sin preached in 1954 he says this they say now paul here is speaking in the hebrews was trying to tell the people the approach to god was through the bleeding sacrifice and at the sacrifice sacrifice of the lord jesus christ brother brown says that's how you approach him it's through jesus or he is the lamb that takes away the sin of the world when they brought the lamb they made their offering their sacrifice sacrificio held the lamb they held the lamb while it was squirring well it was shaking you know what the jugular after they had done the sacrifices that's what i'm trying to kind of explain verse 12 a little bit how they sacrificed the the little animals in the same desire to commit uh whatever they were committing whether would they lie too much whether they cheated a lot well there were thieves so then that's what i was trying i wanted to figure that out myself that it was a type query it was a symbol symbol of things to come how much most of the blood of christ through the eternal spirit of himself with our title being the plan of redemption now we all think of we know what a plan is we make plans in life for uh let's say a student is going to college who wants to get a certain degree university do they go to the university or can they go to junior college and right here in hebrews 9. one of the titles it says in here in the bible this is the plan of redemption so this is our plan amen a plan is a a method for achieving an end finale so you make a plan because you want to get to an end let's say we're going to take a trip to mexico you know what highway you got to take you know so so what we have here look at that this is our plan we got to keep that in mind now we go to the word redemption the act or process or an instance so redeeming comes the word redeemed it's to buy back yes if you're buying back it was already yours because you're redeeming it you're taking back it's yours you left it there but you're gonna go back and get it to release from blame or death to be free from the consequences of sin liberal consequences it's a change for better de cambiaras to remove the obligation of by payment obligation so this is the plan it has a plan to make things good paracetamol right the plan has been given to you and me el planas now it's going to be up to us if we want to follow it again right here what paul is telling us [Applause] sacrificio that's that's that's what that's that's the symbol of what it was but then we get down a little bit lower here how much more the blood of jesus christ and what's he talking about what the lord jesus christ did for us at the cross what do you do with the cross of calories he was there in our state he paid our price sometimes uh they say well what is what is it truly about during this plan we have sometimes we say man i know how to get to that uh i know how to get to south mountain but they're shortcuts i don't got to go through all this traffic they're shortcuts our journey but we want to do it our way i want to take a shortcut i mean i'm doing that shortcut sometimes i mean going by a cliff a cliff that's called uh uh forgive me brother maybe be called depression well i think i can't make it anymore because i wanted to get to my certain destination but i try to go my own way i didn't go the way that i was told to go during i can't handle uh my when i'm about to jump off that cliff i different ones of course different we some of us have lost children some of us have lost our parents god knew what you were going to go through he was building that character because he knew because he knew when you went through that trying to jump off the cliff that brother we gotta work in teams you're not supposed to be up there what am i going to do brother can we just set him up i'm trying to be obedient i want to do the best i can i'm trying to follow this plan brethren i've been on cliffs many times i've tried to take my shortcuts and during this planet calls us to believe yes okay it's so easy only believe right we sing about it all the time but do we really do it i remember i was reading on brother branham when he was younger he had a stomach issue at one time he couldn't eat the doctors i told him you can't eat anymore you're not gonna do it brother i need you here at a certain time why do i gotta listen to them i'm my own man but we know something's stopping us and thank god for that sometimes when you want to do something and you know something's in your head then you shouldn't do it thank god for that you got those breaks my dad another part of the plan here you got to forgive yourself we've all gone through ups and downs that we said maybe last week we're going through it and we just we beat ourselves up these are fights that we all gotta deal with the things we gotta forgive ourselves and forgive others sometimes we may go years old thinking about what somebody did to us and we love them but we just can't believe they did that they heard us so much and they act like nothing happened we're the ones that are living with that notre dame see this body here when abraham was told to get out of that country of preaching of the lord jesus christ he just you want to be redeemed i want to be redeemed but we got to take actions for we got to be uh responsible for our own actions i can tell you this for two or three hours you must say brother albert why are you even saying this so we want to follow these plants brethren we have to we have to go by the rules tell us to go to the to the highway of forgiveness we gotta go there and forgive he can tell me about it he can teach me about it but he has most of his life but it's going to be up to me it's going to be up to you and then our children reach a certain age and then we give them the example in every aspect of our life right at the house we want them to keep their room clean we got to keep our room clean ourselves that's what you do it brethren our actions speak louder than our words if we want to reach our goal it takes a plan plan with that plan maybe right i can't talk to you about something i don't know about the problem i like to work in teams i like to watch teams everybody has to do their part everyone in here plays their part everyone in here brother god has something for every one of you or something big we may be the doormat maybe we may be the speaker but you play your part god knows every little detail about us let's continue to love each other times are tough it hurts what we see on the news look how blessed we are to be here we're here for certain reasons we encourage our households no but i'm going to try hey albert how come uh you don't talk like this or talk like that okay sometimes you do i might just see but not all the time and i'm just telling you and then you that's that's when you got him right there because they're asking questions is that because of you it's because god is god god bless each and every one of you you know yesterday i went to visit uh pete i just went to visit he's the one i used to talk to you about that we went into the military together um i went down though god i got lost yesterday i get my petty i tried to take shortcuts i'm not sure if you're aware the freeway is closed uh there's no way to get down uh west after 35th your avenue is actually taking you to different locations trying to get find an easier way and when albert was speaking i mean that gps took me all the way up to thomas thomas from thomas it was taking me to 93rd avenue uh i was right next to um costco on 91st this is really nonsense but see we all have a plan and god has a plan your car has a plan and i have to be identified you need to be identified that god set up for your life let me say it again god has a plan for each and every one of us and when that purpose of that plan that he established four years there's only two forms being an astronaut or going back into the world so as we become identified with the message with our partners i was talking danny with someone the other day i'm not going to give you the name but you don't know and they
