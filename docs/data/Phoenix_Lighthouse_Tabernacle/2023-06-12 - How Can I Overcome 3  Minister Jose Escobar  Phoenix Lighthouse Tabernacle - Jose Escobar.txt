[Music] and uh as we're getting looking for our scriptures first I'd like to thank our pastor for this honor says it's in order to be up here you know it's a great responsibility so I'm going to try my best to do what I can and I'm also very thankful with the Lord yesterday was my birthday so um I guess this is my present but I'm happy that he's granted me another year of life uh yesterday uh we could go to the scripture and the scripture reads the scripture reads to him that overcome it will I grant to sin with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm sat down with my father in his throne series dear heavenly father no we thank you for the great privilege of allowing us to be here once again we're so thankful and we're so blessed Lord and we thank you for everything you're doing everything you've done and everything you will do you annoying my lips after you anoint the ears of the people listening whether they be here or watching online tries to help me and my interpreter as well yeah so ask you all these things the person in the Lord Jesus Christ So based on the scripture we're going to be continuing with the topic of how can I overcome it's a very great topic I enjoy hearing each of the brothers that come up here and listening to the different approaches to that topic I feel like As an interpreter myself I feel that I have someone of an advantage you know I get to stand up here and listen every word right next to them so I feel like I can capture everything so to me it's truly a benefit so how can I overcome how can I be an overcomer how can we be Overcomers you know and we know the definitions we have to stand the test but we also have to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks and I've said it before and it sounds really simple so yes and see you but in order to be an overcomer you have to have something to overcome and so we have to recognize that we're going to be tested you know this is a thought I had in my mind and our pastor church on just a little bit this morning yeah you know we're expected to be tested so I have a quote here from brother Brandon it's from the message how can I overcome and it reads like this he says now we're expected to be tested he says that's a good lesson for my brother way back there also yes must first be tested this is tested with what he says with the word he says that's God's test he says do you believe it says that only shows a true child then C be tested and when the test comes on you you can't overcome unless there's a test to give to you is [Music] and when the test is given it's to see whether you're overcome or not and Jesus said to him that overcometh the test Jesus and see here he gives us a kid it's something that might be difficult to understand but something that we know we have to know and he says the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to you that right there might be something difficult to accept yeah because maybe you've had all sorts of tests so you're thinking that moment of pain you're telling me that that's the best thing that ever happened to me and it is he says the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to you but why is it so great in case it's those tests that mold us into a better Persona you know they build our character we can become a better person through those tests he's talking about Jesus Christ he says he made himself like us that we may be made like him I believe that's what the tests are foreign Peter said that our Charles are worth more to us than precious gold is it's a testing time and here is another key uh he's talking about the test he says it's one good evidence to us that God is with us he says when we're tested for alternative God are tested and tried so that might sound tough yes but there should be some comfort in there um that if you're having a hard time that's evidence that God is with you and like Peter said our trials are worth more than precious gold Orofino so if you have trials he says it's a promise God made the promise he says let's stay with it said God promised it no matter if you've got to have a battle yes he said if everything comes lazy why you're what are you overcoming since they overcome by the word of God and their testimony the blood of Christo and here once again going back to an order of being Overcomer you have to have something to overcome he says you've got to overcome something and you have to have some obstacles yes and people are different and fuzz with you and tell you you're a Holy Roller and things of that that's put before you it's a trial is it's a trial and here he says he says if you haven't got that says then you're not even in the battle so here we have both sides of it see if you're in if you have trials then you know God is with you but if you don't have any obstacles everything is easy then you're not even in the battle so that's something we have to realize you know that's where we at we're in a battlefield that is you know a battlefield is not a nice place we're very difficult it's where people lose their lives you know just this week is June 6th and it says it's what they call D-Day you send it which is you know it commemorates from when the the Allied troops uh went to the beach of Normandy in France during the World War II and then you know and it was a very important battle and brother Branham talks about that battle yeah and he says that if it wasn't for that battle is there would be no Victory Day Victoria that we have to understand that in order for us to have a victory day we have to have a D-Day as well it's you know thousands of soldiers lost their lives but if it was necessary in order to win that war but so you know we're going to be tested you know and something that I've been doing more often who I'm trying to do um you know get more familiarized with stories of the Bible you know I know stories from when I was a child you know but I've never gone back and truly examined them and so going back to you know God is with you in your trials and tests and so one story I was reading earlier this week you know it's the story of the Three young Hebrews and you know that one can be found in Daniel 3. of course you know I won't be reading it I'll just be telling the story you know and you you know the story maybe many of you may know it you know there was a king Nebuchadnezzar is when he created this large statue of gold and then he made Allah he says that whenever you would hear a thing a horn or a flute yeah when you hear the music throughout the day it meant you had a drop down and worship this statue and so he made it Allah and most people obeyed but there was three people who did it so one of these men he was a citizen he went and he told Nebuchadnezzar is he said there's these three Jewish young men who do not pray to your statue that was and that's that's the three Hebrew men yes and so as The Story Goes the king gets angry and he calls them in and so they go and they bring them into into where the king is and he tells them is this true is and you know he says can your God deliver you from the punishment you'll received because part the punishment for not worshiping the statue you would get thrown inside a furnace and so that's what they did to the three young men and you know and the King was so angry that he wanted he asked for the furnace to burn seven times hotter okay and then they tied up the young men yeah they send them into the furnace but when you read the scripture the man that delivers them to the furnace the two men that were the men that were with them it was so hot that they died from it you know in the Scripture it says that they weren't just any men the king chose his mightiest man and at that moment you know he was impacted because they were inside and they weren't binded no more they were walking freely so he went and he called him to come out and the interesting part is you know when they came out not a single hair and their body was burnt you know and I think about when you stand around the fire you could be there for a couple minutes you know and your clothes starts to smell like the fire is and then it's like really hard to get off yes but the scripture says that even the smell of fire wasn't on them no that's the God we serve you know I believe that God could have turned off the fire because he could have destroyed the furnace but that would be removing the test instead of in this he was there with him in the test and he delivered them because God never promised that there wouldn't be tests but he promised that he'd be there with us and so then why do we want to overcome transport as we've spoken before no there's a reward for the Overcomer as we were in the scripture you know it's to sit with me in my throne and you know that's the reward for the Overcomer of laodicea this is because as you read in Revelations no every age has Overcomers in every age has a reward but we get the greatest reward of all of all of them and the question is why do we get the greatest rewards here you know this is the message how can I overcome he says we see this age that we're living in he says it's one of the grandest ages of all ages he says because it's the ending of time in the blending of Eternity is the greatest sinful age is he says it's more sin in this age that there's ever been instead he says and the powers of Satan is many times harder to fight against than it was in any age so why are we getting the greatest reward you know so he's you know sometimes he think you know he he knows how great we are you know but we don't recognize it you know and I'll say that for myself you know no one bullies Joe like Joe bullies Joe come on my worst my worst critico critical no I bully myself I want to say that everybody in here you're all great and you know I talked to the Young The Young Ones you know know they they can be whatever they want to be and I like to let them know that anything great that you're ever going to be that's already within you yes that's already inside of you anything you can hope to be it's already inside of you yes you know brother gives us the example of the apple tree he says you know every fruit or every Apple it will ever give fruit is already inside that seed yesterday so whatever yield will be it's already inside you just started you know we're talking maybe in your career maybe in school but Also spiritually what a real B is already within you yes these little passes I would like to read you know brother Brandon here you know he talks about a Lily and it's a really nice story that I'd like to read he says where a lily I think is one of the most prettiest flowers that there is he says I'm very fond of those great calla lilies and pond lilies he says I think there's nothing hardly as pretty as great big Pond Lily call it a water lily karaoke he says how it's radiance now he says now where does it come from he says it's a little seed it says down in the bottom of a muddy Mucky Pond he says in that little city yet all the ratings that will ever shine in it is in it right then is in that slime that it's living in yeah it presses its way through the mud the mug in the waters in the waters in the stagnant places until it sticks its head above in the light and expresses what's been hidden it all the time says I think that's the Overcomer yeah they were once in sin um they did the things that were wrong he says don't worry about it now he says once did things that was wrong then now why look back into the pond again look you have God by his predestination see he has brought his seed to life and is pressing itself [Music] it's pressing itself coming to life this is and now on top of Ali has overcome foreign he says amen amen he says you can't now point back to where he was on top so maybe if you ever found yourself in that situation or maybe you feel like you're there right now you're in the mud yeah on a logo but you're rising up little by little brothers You're striving you'll get higher and higher until you stick your head out and you express who you really are you express so how do we come how do we overcome in our age we have to have the word Innes so then how do we overcome you know it's not us but it's the word inside of us because the word is God so we overcome the things of the world because it's the world in it's the word in us because like we said before you know Jesus was the perfect example Jesus and brother Brandon talks about how Satan had three major assaults on him so that's how we overcome yes we use the word we also use the weapons that we have as Christians so what weapons do we have as Christians but we have the Holy Spirit we have the word of God we have prayer and we have love more and then right now you know if you feel like you're struggling you just gotta keep pushing you know what I can say is you know don't leave God you know if or if you feel like you've left God is you just have to go back to where you left him you know and this and I'll be finishing with this and this is a story I've said before this one is and it's a story that I really like brother Benham says it several times and I believe um brother Bernie mentions in identification you know it's about a chaplain you know who find herself with a captain you know who was at War you know he got injured and he was about to die and so the chaplain went over to him and you know he asked him he said sir are you a Christian senores Cristiano and the captain says he says I once was in the chaplain Assam he says how long have you been backslidden where did you leave him alone and he was struggling and at the same time you know the blood was over was filling his lungs and so the chaplain told him you better think fast and he said what can I do yes he says go right back to where you left him he says and begin right there he says that's where you'll find him he says where you left him and the the captain you know he just laid there for a moment and he was struggling but then a smile came across his face and then he said and then the the chaplain song will start right there and then he said it says now I lay me down to sleep I pray the Lord my soul to keep if I should die before I wake I pray the Lord of my soul to take yes and when he said that is and if you don't know that prayer it's I think it's a it's a prayer a night prayer that they I think it's from the 18th century is that what kids would say before they go to sleep where did he leave God said back in the Cradle he said on the knees of his mother but he was able to go back to where he left them this is sojos dear heavenly father Celestial I thank you for once again being with US foreign you allow us to
