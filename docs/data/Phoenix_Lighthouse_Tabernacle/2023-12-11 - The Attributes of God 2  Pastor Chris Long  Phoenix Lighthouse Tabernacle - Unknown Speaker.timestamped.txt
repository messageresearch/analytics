[0:02] that's justed
[0:05] ones which are at Ephesus and the
[0:09] faithful in Christ
[0:15] Jesus so the class won't forget it how
[0:18] do we get in
[0:23] Christ do we join the church to get in
[0:28] Christ
[0:30] do we make a profession to get in
[0:35] Christ do we be immersed in water to get
[0:38] in
[0:41] Christ how do we get in
[0:45] Christ First Corinthians 12th chapter
[0:49] for by one
[0:53] Spirit one capital s p i r i t which is
[0:58] holy spirit
[1:00] we are all baptized into the promised
[1:08] [Music]
[1:20] land in this Promised Land everything
[1:23] belongs to
[1:25] us in the Promised
[1:28] Land
[1:33] see it
[1:34] Brothers see everything in the promised
[1:40] land when Israel crossed over this
[1:44] Jordan into the promised
[1:46] land down
[1:52] everything I remember in this promised
[1:55] land that don't mean that you are immune
[1:58] from sickness that don't mean that
[2:00] you're immune from
[2:10] troubl but it does spell
[2:20] this it says this that it's
[2:28] your
[5:33] [Music]
[5:51] [Music]
[9:02] [Music]
[11:28] I
[11:38] now the word let me read the
[11:42] next foundation of the
[11:44] world that we should be holy and Without
[11:47] Blame before him having predestinated
[11:57] us I want to stop on that word of
[12:01] [Music]
[12:07] predestinated now predestin say I'll
[12:11] choose and
[12:13] I I won't choose
[12:22] brother that isn't
[12:25] it it's the for knowledge of God
[12:30] that know which one would be right and
[12:32] which one wasn't
[12:39] right so by for knowledge God knowing
[12:44] what he was going to
[12:49] do he
[12:52] predestinated by his for knowledge Amen
[12:56] to make all things work together
[12:59] together for the good to them that love
[13:07] God that he might in the age that is to
[13:10] come call all things
[13:14] together in one which is Christ
[13:25] Jesus let me draw you a little
[13:27] illustration here it's good
[13:34] hu we go back I believe I talked on a
[13:38] little bit the other night I struck
[13:40] it in Genesis the 1 chapter
[13:50] 126 when God called his name Lord God
[13:54] it's in the word of l l Elohim
[13:59] which means the self existing
[14:14] one nothing else existed but
[14:19] him there was no air there was no light
[14:23] there was no stars there was no world
[14:26] there was no nothing else
[14:34] it was God and God
[14:38] alone
[14:44] el now he made
[14:47] that inside of
[14:51] that was
[14:54] attribute which meant that he was a
[14:57] inside of the this great L El Elohim was
[15:04] an attribute or
[15:15] a so you know what an attribute
[15:20] is or let me say it like this was a
[15:27] nature that's so the little fell will
[15:30] get it I'm one of the little fell that
[15:32] had to get it that
[15:43] way of him
[15:45] was the nature to be a
[15:52] father but he's
[15:54] [Music]
[15:56] self-existence there ain't nothing for
[15:58] him to be father
[16:05] by now down inside of that was something
[16:09] else that he was
[16:15] gone and a god is an object of
[16:22] worship but it was
[16:25] self-existence
[16:27] El
[16:29] him so there was nothing to worship
[16:40] him inside of that he was a
[16:47] savior there's nothing lost to be
[16:56] saved inside of that he was a Healer
[17:07] sick to be heal be
[17:16] SI now do you get the
[17:19] picture so
[17:22] isut his
[17:24] nature produced what is
[17:27] today
[17:32] some people say well why didn't God just
[17:33] stop it in the
[17:38] beginning he's a cruel hearted brute
[17:41] said Joe Lewis that want to condemn
[17:46] [Music]
[17:52] Joe that he's just a Cru hearted brute
[17:54] there's no such a thing as
[17:57] God
[18:01] if there was such a thing it'd be oh I
[18:03] just called him all kinds of names
[18:09] see but it's just because he might have
[18:13] a lot of knowledge up here but he ain't
[18:14] got nothing down
[18:25] here this word tells it here
[18:28] and he's hid
[18:32] it and these Mysteries has been hidden I
[18:35] remember the Bible said since the
[18:37] foundation of the
[18:38] world waiting for the manifestations of
[18:42] the sons of God to display them to the
[18:57] church
[18:59] you get
[19:05] it I stop on my story just a little bit
[19:10] or I'll bring I'll go to my next stop
[19:12] till I get
[19:20] this I remember all through the ages of
[19:25] Moses back to the ages of the prophets
[19:29] back through all ages they waited until
[19:33] this latter
[19:34] days for these things to be displayed
[19:37] according to the
[19:52] scriptures right for it to be revealed
[19:55] to the sons of God
[20:02] why from the L until like the pyamid as
[20:06] I have said building Closer Closer
[20:13] [Music]
[20:17] Closer as I've often made this remark
[20:21] and said God made three
[20:27] Bibles
[20:30] the first one he put it in the sky the
[20:37] Zodiac you ever see the
[20:41] zodia what is the first figure in the
[20:46] zodia the
[20:49] Virgin what's the last figure in the
[20:51] zodiac Leo
[20:56] line he come the first time to the
[20:58] Virgin he comes the second time as the
[21:00] lion of the tribe of Judah
[21:09] see he made the next one in the
[21:12] pyramid back in the days of Enoch when
[21:16] they made
[21:22] theam and they measure I don't
[21:24] understand
[21:26] it but to the wars where they stupid and
[21:29] go on their knees for so long and can
[21:31] measure the distance of the
[21:39] wars you know where they me to
[21:43] now come across the king's
[21:49] chamber and as this pyramid went up we
[21:52] could not build it with everything that
[21:54] we got today we couldn't build
[21:57] it
[22:03] it's built right up like this to a
[22:09] point and the stone on the
[22:13] Capstone never was
[22:20] found they never did put a cap on top of
[22:23] the
[22:24] [Music]
[22:26] pyramid I don't know whether you know it
[22:28] or not the big Pyramid of Egypt it never
[22:30] had a top Stone on
[22:37] it
[22:39] why the Capstone was rejected Christ the
[22:44] headone see was
[22:52] rejected but as we grow from the
[22:56] Lutheran age bap age Methodist age
[23:00] Pentecostal age we're right up to the
[23:04] capping Stone
[23:14] now waiting and longing for that capping
[23:18] Stone to set down the buildings
[23:26] complete
[23:28] have not you read the scripture the
[23:30] stone was
[23:33] rejected of course we realize that was
[23:35] talking of the Solomon
[23:40] Temple but the rejected Stone has become
[23:43] the chief of the
[23:47] corner I'm saying this only to make
[23:50] a a picture to
[23:55] you now and in the Bible we're living in
[23:59] the last days the top of the
[24:08] pyramid the cross fishes of the cancer
[24:11] age in the
[24:17] Zodiac in the time of the coming of the
[24:24] Le in the capping Stone
[24:29] and in the days of the manifestations of
[24:33] the sons of
[24:35] [Applause]
[24:37] [Music]
[24:43] God we're right at the end
[24:48] time how many been reading the paper
[24:50] this week what
[24:56] Cru
[24:58] well they're ready so are
[25:05] we ready
[25:10] all
[25:12] oh what a privilege what a
[25:18] day if the Christians could only realize
[25:21] the day that we're
[25:26] living
[25:30] why do you think the writer of this book
[25:31] had seen
[25:35] it and seen where it would be manifested
[25:37] in the last
[25:41] days waiting and groaning for those sons
[25:44] of God to rise in the last
[25:49] days for that power of the Holy Ghost at
[25:52] the end of the age to reveal the secret
[25:56] things to the foundation the world to
[25:58] bring it
[26:05] up now let's go back into the foundation
[26:08] of the world again to get a revelation
[26:10] to see if we're right or
[26:19] not I hope I don't make myself sacri
[26:22] religious by calling God
[26:26] Papa
[26:30] but I want to say it that way so you'll
[26:32] understand
[26:36] it Papa wanted some
[26:39] children so what did he do he said let
[26:42] there be
[26:48] angels and they come around
[26:52] him oh that's fine
[26:55] oh they worshiped him then he was God
[26:59] the
[27:03] attributes remember he was
[27:07] L
[27:08] Elohim
[27:11] self-existence nothing but
[27:16] [Music]
[27:19] him the first thing come around was
[27:25] Angels then angels could do no more than
[27:32] worship they couldn't be
[27:38] lost so they couldn't be sick they were
[27:41] Immortal
[27:46] beings so he couldn't display his
[27:48] healing power he couldn't display his
[27:56] salvation
[27:58] so
[27:59] then
[28:02] before then after that he said we'll
[28:05] make
[28:12] something so he made an
[28:17] earth and when he made the Earth he made
[28:20] all the creatures of the
[28:25] earth and then he made
[28:30] man everything that come up out of the
[28:32] earth starting off with a A polywog or a
[28:37] jellyfish just a form of Flesh floating
[28:39] on the
[28:48] Water started from there from that to a
[28:52] frog which is the lowest type of life
[28:54] that we can find they claim as a frog
[29:05] highest type is human
[29:06] [Music]
[29:08] being from the Frog it started to the
[29:11] lizard from the lizard on and on and on
[29:13] and every time the Holy Ghost begin
[29:16] to breathe life come
[29:26] again
[29:35] and the first thinging something come up
[29:38] in the image of
[29:40] God that was a
[29:47] man nothing has ever been never was
[29:50] never will be created
[29:53] anymore anything higher than a man
[29:55] because a man is in the image of
[30:08] God
[30:10] then man when he made his first man now
[30:14] when he made his Angelic being he made
[30:25] Man created he made and female all in
[30:29] the same
[30:33] unit he was both man and woman femin and
[30:37] masculine when he made Adam and put him
[30:40] in
[30:46] flesh remember inesis he made man and
[30:53] woman and in Genesis 2 there was no man
[30:57] yet yet to kill the S flesh
[31:04] man no man that could take a hold of
[31:07] anything and steal the S but yet there
[31:10] was a man in His
[31:18] image God is
[31:22] [Music]
[31:26] a
[31:28] he made the first man male and female
[31:30] created
[31:35] he now when he made the first
[31:37] [Music]
[31:39] man now remember all together he had it
[31:43] in his
[31:47] mind and Sunday night I went through
[31:51] that a a word is a thought expr
[32:01] expressed God thought how he could be
[32:05] God how he could be worshiped how he
[32:07] could be a Healer how he could be a
[32:18] savior and as soon as he spoke the word
[32:21] it was finished
[32:26] forever
[32:28] oh if these sons of God
[32:31] now can only lay hold of that word like
[32:41] that when God speaks the word it is
[32:45] finished
[32:46] [Music]
[32:52] absolutely he might have waited
[32:54] chronologist say that or an archist just
[32:57] all they claim it maybe the world was
[32:59] millions and millions
[33:08] and I don't know it might have been
[33:11] trillions and trillions of years I don't
[33:12] know how long it
[33:18] was God does not exist in
[33:24] time he has not one minute l time than
[33:27] he did when he spoke
[33:33] it he is still God there's no time with
[33:41] him I never knew that like that till the
[33:43] other night other morning
[33:50] rather Eternal no yesterday no tomorrow
[33:54] it's all
[33:55] now
[34:00] did you ever notice the word I am not I
[34:03] was or I will be it's Eternal I am I

[1:01:30] amen amen God bless you a real pleasure
[1:01:34] to be back with you this
[1:01:36] evening while you're standing if you
[1:01:38] would take your Bibles and turn to
[1:01:40] Philippians once
[1:01:42] again chapter
[1:01:45] two we will finish that portion of
[1:01:47] scripture which we started this
[1:01:51] morning amen and and and and let's let's
[1:01:56] if if we don't know it already let's be
[1:01:57] an
[1:02:01] attribute amen uh Philippians chapter 2
[1:02:04] veres 5-8 and we'll finish we we'll stop
[1:02:08] right now uh when we get to the bottom
[1:02:10] uh verse 7 let this mind be in you which
[1:02:13] was also in Christ
[1:02:17] Jesus who being in the form of God
[1:02:19] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:02:21] God but made himself of no reputation
[1:02:24] and took upon him the form of a servant
[1:02:28] and was made in the likeness of men
[1:02:44] I amen may the Lord add a blessing to
[1:02:47] the reading of his word you may be
[1:02:50] seated now as we started out this
[1:02:53] morning we spoke about how that uh the
[1:02:55] only way that you'll ever be able to
[1:03:00] channel the thoughts of
[1:03:02] God is to have this mind because that's
[1:03:05] what the mind is it's a
[1:03:07] channel it's a
[1:03:09] director it's a guide so in verse eight
[1:03:14] and being found in fashion as a man he
[1:03:19] humbled
[1:03:21] himself so we found out that this mind
[1:03:24] has certain
[1:03:26] characteristics and we and we know that
[1:03:29] it's it's to it's to be a
[1:03:31] servant no
[1:03:33] reputation not afraid to be equal with
[1:03:38] God but now we're going to get to the
[1:03:40] difficult
[1:03:41] part
[1:03:43] humble was not afraid to be humble as a
[1:03:46] matter of fact it knew that humility was
[1:03:50] the key
[1:03:53] characteristic
[1:03:55] to being able to channel the thoughts of
[1:04:00] God we live in a we live in a
[1:04:03] time where it's most difficult to be
[1:04:08] humble because
[1:04:10] of social
[1:04:13] media social media carries with
[1:04:20] it certain
[1:04:23] characteristics and they're all found
[1:04:25] right
[1:04:26] here this is the this is the home
[1:04:30] plate listen careful this is the mind
[1:04:34] for social
[1:04:36] media this channels it right
[1:04:39] here you see we want to be on YouTube
[1:04:41] can in YouTube we want to be on my place
[1:04:45] in my place Facebook in Facebook and I'm
[1:04:48] not preaching against those
[1:04:50] things I'm preaching how we use
[1:04:53] them
[1:04:55] everything starts out
[1:04:58] innocently the the the
[1:05:01] gun was was was meant to
[1:05:05] protect and to be able to get food to
[1:05:09] eat so it started out good but it turned
[1:05:14] bad you with me the
[1:05:17] automobile was meant to carry you from
[1:05:20] place to
[1:05:21] place now it uses a weapon
[1:05:25] it destroys people's
[1:05:27] lives it
[1:05:30] can and then I'll just go right to this
[1:05:33] gadget
[1:05:35] here okay I have one it's what you use
[1:05:39] it
[1:05:42] for that's the same thing that God wants
[1:05:46] out of his
[1:05:48] children he wants you to
[1:05:51] channel he wants you to become the D
[1:05:54] director
[1:05:55] of he wants you to become a
[1:05:58] guide of his
[1:06:00] thoughts this started out
[1:06:04] innocently meant to
[1:06:06] communicate now everything has a
[1:06:09] positive and a
[1:06:11] negative Facebook Facebook my my
[1:06:16] brother-in-law years ago he say how come
[1:06:19] you're not on
[1:06:20] Facebook it's so that we can share
[1:06:22] family pictures
[1:06:26] that sounds good but after sharing the
[1:06:29] family
[1:06:31] pictures we find out way too much about
[1:06:34] the
[1:06:36] family whether it's true or
[1:06:39] false people want they they get the
[1:06:42] feeling of of well I I I I I feel like
[1:06:45] I'm I'm going to be able to to to send a
[1:06:50] message to my friends and family and
[1:06:54] then all of a sudden they have a hundred
[1:06:57] friends never met one of
[1:07:00] them don't really even know if they're
[1:07:03] the person that they say they
[1:07:06] are you see that's the way the human
[1:07:10] mind
[1:07:11] works we need to change
[1:07:14] that the human mind was meant to channel
[1:07:18] God's
[1:07:20] thoughts and become the manifestation of
[1:07:23] those thoughts
[1:07:26] now you heard me say there was a
[1:07:29] positive yeah I got the entire message
[1:07:32] of the hour on
[1:07:33] here I have the Bible on here I have the
[1:07:38] dictionary on
[1:07:40] here and I have my wife's picture on
[1:07:43] here that's the only
[1:07:46] face that I
[1:07:48] need for my
[1:07:51] book the Lord is good to us
[1:07:54] let me tell you because he sent us a
[1:07:56] message that gives us the
[1:07:59] opportunity to learn God's
[1:08:03] ways and God's
[1:08:05] thoughts that's why we're here this
[1:08:08] evening I believe
[1:08:09] that you know you often hear the
[1:08:14] phrase the manifestation of the sons of
[1:08:19] God of course that includes you
[1:08:22] daughters do you know what the word
[1:08:25] manifestation
[1:08:28] means to show
[1:08:32] up to show up to
[1:08:37] arrive did you know
[1:08:39] that so let me tell you the simplest
[1:08:42] form of the
[1:08:45] manifestation of the sons of
[1:08:47] God show
[1:08:49] up it's that
[1:08:52] simple because
[1:08:54] we have
[1:08:56] arrived one of the most difficult things
[1:08:58] for
[1:09:00] people is to come to the house of
[1:09:03] God why it's not because they don't want
[1:09:07] to it's because they have jobs they have
[1:09:11] family they have
[1:09:13] friends they got the
[1:09:17] sons
[1:09:20] Cardinals you see things like that
[1:09:24] they tend to get in our
[1:09:31] way it's okay to
[1:09:35] be a
[1:09:37] fan but what we really need to
[1:09:41] be is a fan of Jesus
[1:09:44] Christ should be number
[1:09:47] one always in our
[1:09:50] lives I'll tell you what Jesus Christ
[1:09:53] does
[1:09:54] as number one in your life he keeps your
[1:09:57] marriage
[1:09:59] together he keeps your family together
[1:10:02] and I know I have children that don't
[1:10:04] serve the Lord and I have children that
[1:10:06] do serve the
[1:10:09] Lord I'm not worried about the ones that
[1:10:11] are serving the
[1:10:13] Lord I'm praying for the ones that
[1:10:17] don't those are who I'm pulling
[1:10:21] for the believing children are pulling
[1:10:23] with
[1:10:26] me so see brothers and sisters this mind
[1:10:30] of Christ
[1:10:32] Jesus has
[1:10:34] requirements
[1:10:36] characteristics and humility is one of
[1:10:40] the hardest characteristics to truly
[1:10:42] find
[1:10:46] today brother brandham said
[1:10:49] this the greatest people he ever
[1:10:52] met
[1:10:54] were the humblest people he ever
[1:10:57] met you know why they had nothing to
[1:11:01] prove they knew who they
[1:11:04] were that's why I'm preaching this to
[1:11:07] you tonight so that we can know who we
[1:11:10] are now first of all you would have to
[1:11:13] believe that there is a
[1:11:16] God and that he could
[1:11:19] write because this is his
[1:11:22] word I be believe
[1:11:24] that and because I believe this is his
[1:11:27] word I can also believe in
[1:11:31] prophets and I believe he sent a
[1:11:34] prophet wasn't an ordinary man he was a
[1:11:38] man that God decided that he would give
[1:11:40] Vindication and proof
[1:11:44] to he
[1:11:46] Vindicated his
[1:11:47] ministry now we we quote out of many
[1:11:51] different
[1:11:52] Publications
[1:11:54] you know I hear men quoting
[1:11:56] uh uh uh the brothers in the
[1:12:00] past uh Martin Luther for instance Mar
[1:12:03] Lu John Wesley John Wesley and uh and
[1:12:07] many many different men their mind
[1:12:09] escapes their their names escaped my
[1:12:13] mind and I believe that all of those men
[1:12:16] had
[1:12:18] truth but I do not
[1:12:21] use their l
[1:12:24] lure for anything but to vindicate what
[1:12:29] the prophet already said because he said
[1:12:31] it
[1:12:33] first when you read something that the
[1:12:36] prophet did not agree
[1:12:39] with set it
[1:12:41] aside it's not
[1:12:46] Vindicated you with me
[1:12:48] there our Prophet was
[1:12:52] Vindicated
[1:12:54] many infallible
[1:12:58] proofs now I hope this don't shock
[1:13:02] you but I don't
[1:13:05] worship that's right you know
[1:13:09] why because of the mind of
[1:13:12] Christ thinking it not
[1:13:16] robbery oh we're not talking about the
[1:13:20] position we're talking about the
[1:13:22] mystical body of
[1:13:24] Christ and every attribute in
[1:13:28] it we are if we believe we
[1:13:32] are his
[1:13:35] children his children emanated from his
[1:13:39] mind by his
[1:13:41] thoughts that's the reason why it
[1:13:43] doesn't
[1:13:44] say let the mind of God be in
[1:13:48] you let the mind of Christ be
[1:13:52] in that was the channel that God was
[1:13:55] going to
[1:13:57] use I want to express these things to
[1:14:00] you so it becomes
[1:14:03] clear did you know that God is also in
[1:14:06] the same battle we're
[1:14:09] in because the prophet said he would
[1:14:13] never do he would never ask us to do
[1:14:18] anything that he hadn't already
[1:14:22] done you say wait a minute brother it
[1:14:25] sounds like there's a
[1:14:27] conflict oh there is one there's a
[1:14:32] message the conflict between God and
[1:14:37] Satan is that
[1:14:40] right what is the conflict between God
[1:14:44] and
[1:14:46] Satan oh I got it
[1:14:48] now I know you're not the devil
[1:14:51] brother so I'm going want to let you be
[1:14:56] God and I'm going to say
[1:14:58] that I'm the devil but I'm not you stay
[1:15:04] right there there's a conflict between
[1:15:07] him and I Carlos would you stand
[1:15:11] up who now is between him and
[1:15:14] I oh a Son of
[1:15:18] God you see there is a conflict between
[1:15:20] God
[1:15:22] and and it's the men and
[1:15:26] women between the
[1:15:28] two the conflict
[1:15:31] between Satan between God and
[1:15:35] sat you and
[1:15:38] I so now there's a
[1:15:41] conflict you don't think God didn't
[1:15:45] first understand
[1:15:48] conflict why if we go into our Bibles in
[1:15:50] the Book of
[1:15:52] Genesis we'll find
[1:15:54] out that it even
[1:15:57] grieved God that he made
[1:16:01] man is that
[1:16:03] right I spoke about
[1:16:06] Moses this morning and how he
[1:16:10] stopped he entered into the
[1:16:12] conflict and he said hold
[1:16:15] it in the days in
[1:16:18] Genesis it was
[1:16:20] Noah he saw he he I see a righteous
[1:16:25] man that's going to save at least the
[1:16:29] Journey of
[1:16:34] humanity you see how God was it seemed
[1:16:38] like God was
[1:16:40] conflicted it grieved him that he even
[1:16:45] made how is that
[1:16:47] possible because that's the mind of
[1:16:51] God you know brother Bram said that when
[1:16:54] when the presence of the Lord
[1:16:56] comes the Holy
[1:16:59] Spirit you're dancing on the bubble he
[1:17:03] says you feel
[1:17:05] good he said but when the
[1:17:09] presence of God comes into the
[1:17:13] room you
[1:17:16] freeze your skin begins to turn
[1:17:19] Ashen the blood begins to drain out
[1:17:24] and you begin to
[1:17:26] feel the
[1:17:28] presence of the
[1:17:30] judge but then the heart of
[1:17:34] God steps
[1:17:36] in and it begins to emanate the love you
[1:17:41] talking I couldn't agree with that
[1:17:46] more started with
[1:17:49] love you see when brother Brandon
[1:17:51] preached the message what is the Holy
[1:17:55] Ghost he preached that title that
[1:17:59] way because he because the
[1:18:02] Pentecostals became his
[1:18:05] congregation we notice when we listen to
[1:18:08] the
[1:18:09] messages most of the time brother
[1:18:12] Ernie the people that followed
[1:18:16] him didn't get the order just
[1:18:20] right he would be making an altar call
[1:18:23] somebody would stand up speak in unknown
[1:18:26] tongues somebody would
[1:18:29] prophesy that that was still the work of
[1:18:32] the Holy
[1:18:34] Spirit but
[1:18:36] man injected
[1:18:39] himself into the order of God which made
[1:18:43] the order
[1:18:45] incorrect not the gift brother BR said
[1:18:48] always reverence the
[1:18:50] gift always reverence the gift
[1:18:53] even when you know it's out of
[1:18:57] order is that right see brothers and
[1:19:01] sisters this is the
[1:19:03] mind of
[1:19:07] Christ it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't
[1:19:09] uh step
[1:19:12] back when it's
[1:19:14] told you can be equal with
[1:19:18] me you understand how can we be equal
[1:19:22] with God
[1:19:24] God and His word
[1:19:29] are in the beginning was the
[1:19:31] word and the Word was with
[1:19:34] God and the Word was God and the Word
[1:19:38] was made flesh and Among
[1:19:41] Us that's the equality that God gives
[1:19:46] you and
[1:19:48] I we can be the word made flesh
[1:19:54] that's our
[1:19:56] opportunity that's why we stay with the
[1:20:00] word people will argue over the
[1:20:03] word in John
[1:20:07] 1 in the beginning was the
[1:20:10] word how many knows what the word w r d
[1:20:18] means it's even in the Spanish
[1:20:21] Bible
[1:20:23] Loos is that
[1:20:26] right it's in the beginning was the
[1:20:30] logos and the Loos was with
[1:20:33] God and the Loos was
[1:20:36] God and the Loos became flesh and dwelt
[1:20:40] Among
[1:20:41] Us now that logos is the pillar of
[1:20:44] fire the same one that's on the
[1:20:48] picture with
[1:20:50] brother the same one that Paul
[1:20:55] met I know you think I'm repeating
[1:20:59] myself but I want you to see
[1:21:02] something that's the same Pillar of
[1:21:06] Fire that came down on the day of
[1:21:10] Pentecost and began to
[1:21:13] impart
[1:21:14] itself to the 12
[1:21:18] Believers not diminishing itself one
[1:21:25] you know what the type of that
[1:21:27] is you get some bread and some
[1:21:30] fish you begin to break it off to feed
[1:21:33] the
[1:21:33] people and there's the same amount of
[1:21:37] fish listen and the same amount of
[1:21:40] bread with
[1:21:43] leftovers they picked up many many
[1:21:47] basket why was there
[1:21:50] leftovers it was pointed to others that
[1:21:54] would
[1:21:55] come that would need the fish and the
[1:22:00] bread that's where you and I come
[1:22:03] in it's the same Pillar of
[1:22:06] Fire it's here
[1:22:08] tonight because it is now Jesus
[1:22:13] Christ come on Paul on the road to
[1:22:18] Damascus who art thou
[1:22:21] Lord I'm
[1:22:24] Jesus you
[1:22:26] remember back there in the Old
[1:22:29] Testament I came from God and I went
[1:22:33] back to
[1:22:34] God actually he was the representative
[1:22:38] of
[1:22:39] God in the form of a
[1:22:41] son because God is a
[1:22:44] spirit and you can't get a hold of the
[1:22:47] spirit you can reach out for it but you
[1:22:50] can't
[1:22:51] grasp oh try that with a
[1:22:56] thought you can't get a hold of that
[1:22:58] thought but it's
[1:23:00] there I can prove it because I'm
[1:23:04] thinking it right
[1:23:05] now see I want you to understand where
[1:23:07] we came
[1:23:08] from we came from the very thoughts of
[1:23:14] God and the word
[1:23:16] Loos means thought or
[1:23:21] concept did you know
[1:23:23] and the word
[1:23:25] thought comes from
[1:23:28] conceive
[1:23:30] conception the very beginning and
[1:23:33] existence
[1:23:36] of that's where we came
[1:23:39] from but there's something interesting
[1:23:41] about God's
[1:23:43] thoughts let me finish verse
[1:23:46] eight and being found in fashion as a
[1:23:49] man he humbled himself and and became
[1:23:53] obedient unto death even the death of
[1:23:55] the
[1:24:00] cross I love this
[1:24:02] part because this is the
[1:24:05] channel the guide the
[1:24:09] director of God's
[1:24:11] thoughts are you getting it it's like
[1:24:15] it's the mind you see we get
[1:24:18] thoughts and then we send them through
[1:24:20] our mind to see how they
[1:24:23] out put on the mind of
[1:24:26] Christ and they'll turn out just like
[1:24:29] this run them through the human
[1:24:32] mind and just like Eve did in the Garden
[1:24:34] of
[1:24:36] Eden wow wait a minute
[1:24:38] now yeah you're starting to make perfect
[1:24:40] sense to me there yeah let me let me let
[1:24:43] me think about
[1:24:45] that let me reason that out no no that's
[1:24:49] the mistake people are making
[1:24:53] you cannot prove God by
[1:24:56] science by
[1:24:58] education by
[1:25:00] magic by
[1:25:03] Machinery by
[1:25:06] engineering you can only prove God
[1:25:10] by because that's the way he chose
[1:25:14] it God proves himself by
[1:25:19] Fai he puts his faith
[1:25:22] in what he
[1:25:24] says and it
[1:25:26] happens cuz he's got perfect
[1:25:29] Faith now in Hebrews 6 it says let us go
[1:25:34] on to
[1:25:36] Perfection shall
[1:25:38] we and do you know that the people that
[1:25:41] have already gone on before
[1:25:43] us people that were here brother and
[1:25:46] have
[1:25:47] gone the leaders the men on that
[1:25:51] calendar you
[1:25:56] they're waiting on
[1:26:00] us it seems like when brother Brandon
[1:26:03] went beyond the curtain of
[1:26:05] time pretty close to
[1:26:10] Perfection there was
[1:26:14] love cont but there was still one
[1:26:18] element
[1:26:21] missing they they without us can be
[1:26:27] made they're rooting for you and
[1:26:30] me they're
[1:26:33] anticipating they're they're they're
[1:26:34] actually Desiring for
[1:26:38] us to find our
[1:26:41] position in the body of
[1:26:44] Christ and guess where we're
[1:26:49] at you see I have a good time when I
[1:26:51] preach
[1:26:54] because I believe this
[1:26:55] brother Christ is the mystery of God
[1:27:00] revealed now God's secret
[1:27:05] mystery he had before the world
[1:27:08] began oh this goes way
[1:27:11] back this is not an unfamiliar
[1:27:15] quote but whether you realize it or not
[1:27:18] this quote refers to you
[1:27:24] now back in the back
[1:27:28] part of God's
[1:27:32] mind how far back is
[1:27:35] that exactly
[1:27:38] where back in the back part of God's
[1:27:42] mind there was something that he was
[1:27:47] trying can you
[1:27:49] imagine the prophet of God
[1:27:52] using the
[1:27:53] word God
[1:27:58] trying it makes it sound like there's a
[1:28:02] problem like a
[1:28:04] conflict oh
[1:28:07] yes there can be a
[1:28:10] problem if we want to make it
[1:28:14] one but God is going to accomplish
[1:28:17] it whether you and I decide to be part
[1:28:20] of it or not
[1:28:24] but I have
[1:28:25] decided to follow
[1:28:27] Jesus back in the back part of God's
[1:28:31] mind there
[1:28:33] was what was in the back part of God's
[1:28:37] mind oh it must have been his
[1:28:41] thought he must have been keeping one of
[1:28:43] those
[1:28:46] thoughts nobody could touch
[1:28:50] it the prophet of God
[1:28:54] that not even the man we know is
[1:28:59] Jesus knew the
[1:29:01] hour right or the
[1:29:04] day as if he didn't know the seventh
[1:29:08] seal oh it was in
[1:29:11] him did you get that it was in him just
[1:29:16] like Ephesians
[1:29:19] 1:4 chosen in him before the foundation
[1:29:23] of the
[1:29:24] world that's how back far back this
[1:29:28] thought he was keeping
[1:29:31] it why so nobody could touch
[1:29:37] it nobody could contaminate
[1:29:40] it nobody could twist
[1:29:43] it nobody nobody could take it into the
[1:29:47] laboratory and begin to
[1:29:50] manipulate nobody could hide hbd
[1:29:53] it it was kept
[1:29:56] safe it was sealed
[1:30:00] up in the back
[1:30:02] part of the mind of God well brother
[1:30:06] Chris how do you know that's for
[1:30:08] us oh the word of God
[1:30:10] says the first shall be
[1:30:13] last and the last shall be first you see
[1:30:18] we have arrived brothers and sisters at
[1:30:21] this point
[1:30:23] Christ is the mystery of God
[1:30:27] revealed and that's what he was
[1:30:30] keeping he was keeping back the
[1:30:34] revelation of who Christ
[1:30:37] is you notice if I had one here I'd
[1:30:40] bring it up doesn't matter the seal
[1:30:45] book what does it say on the cover of
[1:30:48] the seal book does not say the opening
[1:30:50] of the seven
[1:30:54] that's right brother it says the
[1:30:57] revelation of the Seven Seals so
[1:31:00] therefore it requires
[1:31:03] God Revelation is faith we put our faith
[1:31:07] in God God begins to open himself
[1:31:11] up notice on the Journey of
[1:31:14] Abraham good
[1:31:20] now
[1:31:23] oh I keep I keep my
[1:31:25] time but when I got
[1:31:27] it
[1:31:30] Advantage you realize on the
[1:31:34] journey God called
[1:31:37] Abraham and Abraham heeded the call of
[1:31:42] God think about it put yourself in
[1:31:47] Abraham what if you went to your mother
[1:31:49] and your
[1:31:50] father your children your wife your
[1:31:53] husb your
[1:31:55] grandchildren your your
[1:31:57] co-workers your
[1:31:59] boss and you said hey God spoke to me
[1:32:02] last night and he said
[1:32:06] leave where are you
[1:32:10] going God didn't tell him where he was
[1:32:13] going Abraham by faith just started
[1:32:17] walking because he believed it was God
[1:32:20] that I don't think you'd be here tonight
[1:32:22] if you didn't think God hadn't talked to
[1:32:26] you but this is the part about the
[1:32:28] Journey of
[1:32:30] Abraham that means so much to
[1:32:33] us God never spoke to him
[1:32:36] again till he got to the next
[1:32:39] destination that God wanted to talk to
[1:32:41] him at
[1:32:42] again in between he never he never
[1:32:44] talked
[1:32:46] to certain things had to
[1:32:48] transpire he had to lose his father
[1:32:52] is that right he he didn't tell him to
[1:32:54] take his nephew
[1:32:57] lot he had to begin to get rid of
[1:33:01] things but what's really good about the
[1:33:04] call of
[1:33:05] God is you don't have to worry about
[1:33:08] getting rid of
[1:33:10] lot he'll leave you
[1:33:14] anyway won't he that's right he said
[1:33:18] there's not enough room for both
[1:33:19] of you see my guys and your
[1:33:23] guys you and they're not getting
[1:33:27] along that's where all those voices came
[1:33:31] from think about it this is going on in
[1:33:35] each one of
[1:33:37] us even if you're committed like I am to
[1:33:40] the
[1:33:41] Lord that old nature comes up every once
[1:33:44] in a
[1:33:46] while hey there
[1:33:48] hey nobody home I know there's somebody
[1:33:52] in there I see the lights
[1:33:56] on but you've got to still say nobody's
[1:34:02] home that's the mistake Eve
[1:34:05] made Eve answered the
[1:34:08] door to
[1:34:10] reason she
[1:34:13] stopped look what's
[1:34:15] happening in the world we live
[1:34:18] in don't
[1:34:20] stop don't
[1:34:23] stop if I couldn't leave you with
[1:34:26] anything else don't
[1:34:29] stop because what's going
[1:34:32] on is the
[1:34:34] opening and the
[1:34:36] revealing of the thoughts
[1:34:39] of and we only get those
[1:34:43] thoughts as God releases them to
[1:34:46] us and he only releases them to us as we
[1:34:52] travel down his
[1:34:54] road and there are certain stopping
[1:34:58] points you got this
[1:35:01] far praise the
[1:35:03] Lord okay now
[1:35:05] next see and and we have to by faith
[1:35:09] step to the next stage of the
[1:35:12] journey to me that's what God is
[1:35:15] doing let me finish this and I'll
[1:35:20] stop
[1:35:22] I'm trying to remember the number you
[1:35:23] told
[1:35:25] me there was something that he was
[1:35:27] trying and was going to
[1:35:30] achieve and he had a motive in doing
[1:35:34] it so in his great
[1:35:38] mind oh what a good place to
[1:35:40] be not in not just his
[1:35:43] mind in his great
[1:35:45] mind he wanted these
[1:35:50] attributes that's you and
[1:35:53] I read it in your
[1:35:55] message I don't have time to quote it
[1:35:58] it's
[1:36:00] everywhere his thoughts are his
[1:36:03] attributes his attributes are his
[1:36:06] children we
[1:36:08] it and that's what he is going to
[1:36:12] accomplish he wanted these
[1:36:15] attributes to be
[1:36:17] expressed listen now watch the
[1:36:20] expression and in him was
[1:36:25] [Music]
[1:36:26] love I remember an old song from
[1:36:31] the not the
[1:36:35] 1860s what the world needs
[1:36:38] now is
[1:36:40] love and if it needed it in the
[1:36:44] 60s about
[1:36:47] the the
[1:36:50] world
[1:36:52] love and the only
[1:36:56] Bible that many of your friends
[1:36:59] and will
[1:37:03] ever you see your written
[1:37:07] Epistles read of all
[1:37:10] men and in him was to be a
[1:37:14] savior to be a father to be a son to be
[1:37:19] a Healer and all all these great
[1:37:23] attributes that we
[1:37:25] see already
[1:37:28] expressed they were in
[1:37:31] God but God wants them
[1:37:35] out he wants you and I to become the
[1:37:39] [Music]
[1:37:40] expression right I love
[1:37:44] this here I'm going to stop with I got
[1:37:49] halfway down this one today
[1:37:52] hang on thank you
[1:37:55] brother I appreciate it I mean that
[1:37:58] because I'm
[1:37:59] serious so we got
[1:38:02] here
[1:38:05] adoption well there was nothing to
[1:38:08] save now remember he wanted to be a
[1:38:11] savior nothing to
[1:38:13] save he wanted to be a Healer there was
[1:38:16] nothing
[1:38:17] sick he wanted to be a
[1:38:20] provider but everything was already
[1:38:23] there
[1:38:25] H watch his
[1:38:29] attributes watch his
[1:38:31] children watch his
[1:38:33] thoughts and his
[1:38:36] attributes produced it you see brothers
[1:38:39] and sisters I'm going to read a little
[1:38:41] bit more till my time is
[1:38:43] up but I want you to get
[1:38:47] this at that stage of the journey in
[1:38:50] God's mind
[1:38:53] nobody
[1:38:55] sick's nobody
[1:38:57] in there's nobody
[1:39:01] lost but his
[1:39:05] attributes his
[1:39:08] thoughts they were
[1:39:11] there and they received a
[1:39:15] signal that he wants to
[1:39:17] be he wants to be and he wants to
[1:39:22] and then there was a
[1:39:23] conference his thoughts got
[1:39:26] together and
[1:39:28] said get the dictionary
[1:39:30] out and look up
[1:39:33] sickness wasn't in the dictionary
[1:39:37] yet because there was nothing
[1:39:40] sick Look up the word
[1:39:43] lost wasn't anything
[1:39:46] lost Look up the word
[1:39:50] provider
[1:39:52] there no
[1:39:53] needs let me tell you where you and I
[1:39:55] come
[1:39:59] in we raised our
[1:40:02] hands and we said I'll
[1:40:08] go that's what Isaiah
[1:40:12] done well you you mean you're going to
[1:40:15] leave the
[1:40:18] comfort and the safy
[1:40:23] of the mind of
[1:40:25] God if we came from
[1:40:27] there we go back to there you see then
[1:40:31] we knew
[1:40:33] that then we knew that we were in that
[1:40:38] theop but today here we are
[1:40:42] struggling sick uh uh uh you know we get
[1:40:47] oppression depression I want I want to
[1:40:50] give you you a little
[1:40:54] tip a
[1:40:57] prescription it's not a bottle of
[1:41:01] pills it's the mind of
[1:41:05] God we're
[1:41:08] here because God allowed
[1:41:10] us to make the
[1:41:13] choice to be
[1:41:15] here he wanted each and every one of us
[1:41:18] tonight to recognize
[1:41:22] where we came
[1:41:23] from and once that becomes a
[1:41:29] revelation nothing can stop it nothing
[1:41:34] and let me tell you something else about
[1:41:35] that
[1:41:36] Revelation it's
[1:41:38] catchy like
[1:41:40] fire if you're on fire and you get close
[1:41:44] to somebody who's in a flammable
[1:41:46] [Music]
[1:41:48] suit they're catching on fire
[1:41:53] it's catchy
[1:41:55] brother it's the fire of
[1:41:58] God it's the
[1:42:02] beginning you know that brother brandham
[1:42:04] told us
[1:42:06] this God gave birth to
[1:42:11] himself brother brother Ernie
[1:42:15] how by
[1:42:18] producing his
[1:42:19] attributes
[1:42:21] so when God gave birth to
[1:42:25] himself he was giving birth to you
[1:42:28] and we just don't realize it
[1:42:32] yet but the message of the
[1:42:34] hour it's revealing to you and
[1:42:38] me by faith that's right you have got to
[1:42:43] believe it you say well brother you
[1:42:46] don't I don't have to understand I don't
[1:42:48] even understand myself
[1:42:51] brother bram's wife said well Bill
[1:42:53] nobody understand
[1:42:55] you and he said I don't even understand
[1:43:00] myself and we think that brother bradam
[1:43:03] had his act
[1:43:06] together he traveled down the same road
[1:43:08] you and
[1:43:11] I I had a couple more minutes let me get
[1:43:14] this this is a different
[1:43:17] paragraph adoption part
[1:43:19] two I know you're listening to the
[1:43:21] adoption
[1:43:23] series now I didn't know that when I
[1:43:25] came but I had this
[1:43:27] already so to me that's a
[1:43:30] Vindication that God wants it reinforced
[1:43:35] in listen
[1:43:37] now let me draw you a little
[1:43:39] illustration
[1:43:41] here he says it's
[1:43:43] good yeah we go
[1:43:46] back I believe I talked on it a little
[1:43:49] bit the other night
[1:43:52] struck on
[1:43:53] it in Genesis the first
[1:43:55] chapter
[1:43:57] 126 when God
[1:44:00] called his
[1:44:02] name Lord
[1:44:05] God God called his own
[1:44:09] name he's calling ours
[1:44:12] too
[1:44:14] right it's in the word of el
[1:44:18] Elohim Elohim which means
[1:44:21] the self-existing
[1:44:23] one there was nothing else existed but
[1:44:28] him there was no air now you and I have
[1:44:32] trouble
[1:44:33] there how's
[1:44:35] that that's not
[1:44:37] possible well we're talking about God
[1:44:40] here there was no
[1:44:43] air there was no
[1:44:45] light there was no stars there was no
[1:44:49] world there was no nothing
[1:44:54] else it was God and God
[1:44:58] Alone Elohim El now he made
[1:45:04] that did you get
[1:45:06] that he purposed it he made it that
[1:45:11] way you know why CU we were in
[1:45:15] him and he would not lose a
[1:45:19] one so he he started with the
[1:45:23] self-existent
[1:45:25] one so that anything that was in
[1:45:28] him could not be
[1:45:32] lost do you get that see
[1:45:35] that inside of
[1:45:38] that wait a minute self-existent one it
[1:45:43] looks like this just
[1:45:45] one oh yes there was but inside
[1:45:52] that's the next
[1:45:53] sentence but
[1:45:56] inside of
[1:45:58] that was
[1:46:02] attributes which
[1:46:05] meant that he
[1:46:07] was inside of this great L
[1:46:12] Elohim was an
[1:46:14] attribute or uh you know what an
[1:46:18] attribute is
[1:46:21] let me say it like this was a
[1:46:25] nature I tell you brothers and sisters
[1:46:28] this is
[1:46:30] deep cuz now he's taking
[1:46:33] us inside of the self-existent
[1:46:36] one calling them
[1:46:40] attributes and then he says it's a
[1:46:47] nature so we
[1:46:49] are
[1:46:52] representatives of the nature of
[1:46:55] god
[1:46:57] wow even when I say that to
[1:47:02] myself that's
[1:47:06] incredible a guy like
[1:47:08] me I don't deserve it he didn't ask me
[1:47:12] if I deserved
[1:47:16] it he asked me if I believed it
[1:47:21] I believe this I believe this is God's
[1:47:28] word and last but not
[1:47:31] least inside of that he was a Healer
[1:47:36] there was nothing sick to be
[1:47:38] healed nothing to be
[1:47:40] sick now do you get the
[1:47:44] picture this is a
[1:47:46] photograph you get the picture
[1:47:50] so his
[1:47:52] attributes his
[1:47:55] nature
[1:47:56] produced what is
