[24:22] is
[24:30] behold I stand at the door and knock If
[24:33] any man hear my voice and open the door
[24:34] I will come into him and what's up with
[24:36] him and he with me
[24:45] to him that overcome it will I grant to
[24:48] stay with me in my throne even as I also
[24:50] overcame and sat down with my father in
[24:52] history
[24:58] let him hear what the spirit said unto
[25:00] the churches
[25:02] will be jumping into Romans
[25:05] 8 37.
[25:14] name all these things we are more than
[25:17] conquerors through him that loved us
[25:18] foreign
[25:28] for I persuade that neither death nor
[25:31] life nor angels nor principalities nor
[25:33] powers nor things present nor things to
[25:36] come out
[25:48] shall be able to separate us from the
[25:50] love of God which is in Christ Jesus our
[25:52] lord
[25:54] I'll be reading another scripture
[25:57] we're going to Matthew 5 48.
[26:08] be ye therefore perfect even as your
[26:11] father which is in heaven is perfect
[26:14] you may take your seats
[26:23] [Music]
[26:38] in Christ Jesus
[26:44] how can we overcome
[26:55] she recognize the devil in each one of
[26:57] his tricks
[26:59] and strategize each one of its movements
[27:03] how many times do we have to overcome
[27:07] that many times as we're tempted
[27:10] how many times do we have to withstand
[27:14] the amount of times we are tempted daily
[27:18] Brothers
[27:22] reach a point like we said the previous
[27:24] time
[27:25] like the Apostle Paul says
[27:29] no longer either Christ lives
[27:33] and together I'm crucified when I mean I
[27:36] Die daily
[27:43] we're going to see what trials and
[27:45] temptations do for us
[27:58] it's the message reaction to an action
[28:01] slide number eight
[28:12] and when you're put under a test when
[28:14] you're fixing to be used for God for a
[28:16] testimony
[28:20] like the lady here in the wheelchair the
[28:22] man or the little boy
[28:24] some of you people out there
[28:30] maybe your Christian wonder why you're
[28:32] put under this test
[28:35] here the messenger is telling us
[28:37] that God is about to the US to use your
[28:41] testimony
[28:42] [Music]
[28:44] but he wants to see how you will react
[28:47] that's why he allows it
[28:50] allows pressure
[28:52] If you
[28:54] combusters he can't do nothing for you
[28:58] but if you withstand the test
[29:02] then you will overcome
[29:05] so if you withstand the test is
[29:08] God is about to use you
[29:11] maybe remove cancer
[29:14] maybe take away that sickness the
[29:18] headache uh
[30:06] It's the reaction to an action
[30:09] slide number eight nine
[30:12] [Music]
[30:25] but he waits till his own time
[30:30] he wanted to see what kind of reaction
[30:32] they'd have
[30:35] he knew they'd made their stand
[30:40] and when he knows that you make your
[30:42] stand
[30:46] he will let Satan take you to the last
[30:48] mile of the way
[30:49] two things brother
[30:52] God knows
[30:54] that you've taken your position
[30:57] and he allows Satan
[31:00] he'll take you to the last mile of the
[31:03] way
[31:05] him knowing that you already have your
[31:07] position
[31:10] remember he's still there
[31:37] sure you got it he just wanted to see
[31:39] how you're going to react on what you
[31:40] said
[31:51] [Music]
[31:54] then we don't show our true colors
[32:00] you say I believe God I'm sorry I say
[32:03] maybe say oh praise God I believe in the
[32:06] baptism of the Holy Spirit
[32:07] Elizabeth
[32:19] your reaction on your action
[32:22] program know he's trying to test you
[32:25] today
[32:28] every son that committed to God must
[32:30] first be chastened tested
[32:35] every child that comes to him he puts
[32:37] him through it
[32:38] to see how he will act
[32:41] as we notice Brothers
[32:45] we have to know our position
[32:50] and how do we realize we're in our
[32:52] position
[32:54] or how do we get to know what our
[32:56] position is
[33:07] that taking our position is to surrender
[33:09] ourselves
[33:28] to let someone have dominion over
[33:31] somebody else on
[33:38] sometimes you want to make things a bit
[33:40] more complicated
[33:42] um
[33:45] the message the unchangeable god of
[33:47] working in an unexpected way
[33:54] you touching me would do no good but
[33:57] touching him
[34:00] what if I can submit myself to him
[34:04] I'm just like this microphone just like
[34:07] this one is
[34:10] this microphone is complete new
[34:16] it's complete Mew until something speaks
[34:19] it's simple right how are we going to
[34:22] surrender just stay calm
[34:25] give us the example of a microphone
[34:28] when somebody speaks through it
[34:31] then the microphone is surrendered
[34:37] what's the first thing you see in our
[34:39] fruits and we have surrendered
[34:40] there comes humility
[34:44] but let's talk about a Christian
[34:46] humility
[34:48] because just famous people who say that
[34:50] they're humble
[34:53] that they have psychologists that they
[34:55] don't get to um I think too highlight
[34:57] themselves because of their money
[35:01] they're humble because they've taken a
[35:03] picture
[35:07] maybe somebody ran across the field and
[35:09] got a picture
[35:13] people say oh what a humble player
[35:15] Manuel is
[35:18] no he's doing an act so that he's he
[35:21] doesn't look bad in front of the people
[35:24] when you surrender to God
[35:27] begins to work in our mind in our body
[35:31] in our hearts
[35:33] in our behavior
[35:36] in our temperament so
[35:39] how often do we have to surrender
[35:42] to surrender daily
[35:45] when we completely surrender ourselves
[35:50] when he starts to overcome through us
[35:54] there's no other way
[35:57] because he is a gentleman
[36:00] like they say at the ranch
[36:05] they twist the head of the chicken and
[36:07] spin around it to kill it
[36:10] he doesn't do that he's a gentleman
[36:13] he waits for us to surrender so that he
[36:17] can overcome through us
[36:26] let's see your reaction why the devil
[36:29] hates Perfection so much
[36:31] we go to the Book of Job
[36:38] we'll be reading six seven and eight
[36:40] this is
[36:48] now there was a day when the sons of God
[36:51] came to present themselves before the
[36:52] Lord and Satan came also among them is
[37:00] doubt then Saints answer the Lord and
[37:02] said from going to and from in the earth
[37:05] and from walking up and down it is
[37:17] and the Lord said unto Satan has thou
[37:19] considered my servant job that there is
[37:21] none like him on earth a perfect and
[37:23] upright man one that feareth God in
[37:25] issue with evil
[37:32] it seems like the devil is the first one
[37:34] who comes so
[37:41] so the messenger says
[37:44] the devil doesn't fear the theologists
[37:52] because he is their father and foreign
[38:37] because our father before being
[38:40] he is our attorney
[38:47] elono to one
[38:50] once again they say
[38:52] is
[39:01] again there was a day when the sons of
[39:04] God came to present themselves before
[39:05] the Lord and Satan came also among them
[39:07] to present himself before the Lord
[39:10] this is another service
[39:13] from it's not the same service as job
[39:15] one this is a different service
[39:20] Royal
[39:23] Lati and the Lord said unto Satan from
[39:25] whence come is thou and Satan answered
[39:26] the Lord and said from going to and from
[39:28] in the earth and from walking up and
[39:29] down in it
[39:39] and he the Lord said unto Satan has thou
[39:41] considered my servant job that there is
[39:42] none like him on earth a perfect and
[39:44] upright man one that feareth God an
[39:46] issue with Evil
[39:56] aparteth Fast his Integrity although
[39:59] thou moveth me against him to destroy
[40:01] him without cause
[40:05] it seems the devil goes to the heavens
[40:08] as if someone is at his house
[40:18] Simone
[40:29] when God tells the Simon is
[40:39] Simon Simon before Satan has desire to
[40:42] have you that he may save you as wheat
[40:47] but I have prayed for you that I thy
[40:50] faith might fail not
[40:51] interested
[40:53] we've seen in three occasions the devil
[40:56] goes to the heavens
[40:58] he goes and he asks for us
[41:01] and he has all the rights
[41:03] and God allows it is
[41:17] have you not seen my servant who is
[41:20] upright and perfect
[41:23] he says he hit him right in the face
[41:27] have you considered my servant who is
[41:29] perfect in upright man because
[41:32] sometimes people may look perfect but
[41:35] then comes the test
[41:37] then you really get to see what's within
[41:39] them a problem at church
[41:47] now we're going to get to see who is the
[41:49] devil
[41:50] what is it that he does
[41:54] at what moment he was co-equal with God
[42:05] in other words
[42:09] he destroys and is perverse
[42:15] he says that he was one of the ones who
[42:17] guarded the ark it was one of the
[42:20] Guardians
[42:24] we'll be going to Ezekiel 28
[42:28] 14. we'll be reading all the way to 17.
[42:40] and I have said thee so thou was upon
[42:43] the holy mountain of God
[42:45] is
[42:48] thou has walked up and down in the midst
[42:51] of the stones of fire
[42:52] perfect
[42:57] that was perfect and I wish from the
[42:59] data that was created
[43:01] did you notice something here he was
[43:04] perfect
[43:08] de la
[43:15] till iniquity was found in the
[43:19] is
[43:25] by the multitude of thy merchandise I
[43:28] have filled the midst of thee with
[43:29] violence and thou has sinned therefore
[43:31] our Cassidy as profaned out of the
[43:33] Mountain of God in our destroy thee of
[43:35] curvature from the midst of the stones
[43:36] of fire okay
[43:49] was lifted up because of thy Beauty
[43:54] is
[43:59] thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason
[44:01] of thy brightness I will cast It To The
[44:03] Ground our lady before Kings
[44:08] we have always been taught
[44:11] that we have to be careful with women
[44:14] dinero with money
[44:19] that sometimes would throw people out of
[44:22] the course
[44:24] but I know it's something here comes how
[44:28] was it that he was cast out of the
[44:29] heavens there there was no money there
[44:32] was no women
[44:35] he made himself higher in his heart
[44:39] was lifted up
[44:41] the Fame got to his head
[44:45] the fame cousin to be cast out of the
[44:47] heavens
[44:49] brother Bernie says something that is
[44:51] very dangerous
[44:53] those are sitting on the benches
[44:57] they have the same value
[45:00] the same as the one who is preaching
[45:03] foreign
[45:07] foreign
[46:01] got to him
[46:03] let us move forward um
[46:10] I would like to read the quote from the
[46:12] law or Grace
[46:19] yes
[46:21] set of cities preached 1954 1006.
[46:31] under the law if the old mother horse
[46:33] had a little cult
[46:34] he was
[46:39] Milton Reyes
[46:41] you can put your name there brother
[46:45] you know in his ears broke down
[46:49] and his knees knocked on what a cross
[46:53] side they say um
[46:54] in horrible looking mules
[47:00] well that meal if he could look at
[47:02] himself
[47:06] dueño
[47:38] intermediate into condition and you have
[47:41] a Birthright and now when the master
[47:43] comes out and sees you in your condition
[47:45] is
[47:48] to go back and get a lamb without
[47:51] blemish
[47:56] and kill it so that crippled up looking
[47:58] mule can live
[48:01] you see the priest never seen the meals
[48:05] he saw the lamb
[48:10] it wasn't whether the mule was perfect
[48:13] it had to be the perfect lamb
[48:16] oh I hope you see it
[48:23] it isn't whether you're good enough to
[48:25] be a Christian or not
[48:30] good enough to be a Christian
[48:34] is
[48:39] whether he was good enough if God
[48:42] accepted him and his blood makes an
[48:43] atonement
[48:45] God don't see you he sees the lamb I
[48:49] mean Hermanos amen Brothers entonces
[48:52] foreign
[49:05] all over the field have a good time
[49:13] is going to live but one perfect had to
[49:16] die for this is imperfect is it is it
[49:18] that you're William Brandon he says that
[49:21] was me William Branham I can say that
[49:22] was me
[49:25] nothing good not worthy of living
[49:28] fear to God worthy to go to hell
[49:31] born in a sinful family
[49:33] raised a sinner
[49:35] absolutely no good at all
[49:40] not one sound party that's right
[49:46] but one day I accepted Hallelujah says
[49:48] The Messengers
[49:49] when God looked down
[49:52] on Christ and Christ took my place
[49:56] then God don't see me
[50:00] he sees the perfect one
[50:04] me Milton who was the mule
[50:07] I was the most horrible
[50:11] do that perfect atonement
[50:13] God sees us
[50:16] he sees you as perfect
[50:23] it's not my perfection
[50:28] I don't have any
[50:48] began to come forth
[50:51] time has gone a bit fast
[50:55] I'll be reading one more quote
[50:58] um
[51:00] it's the power of the devil 55 1005.
[51:04] this is a
[51:06] Ura
[51:07] no no
[51:10] we have not got it in full that's true
[51:15] but we have the earnest of our Salvation
[51:18] what is
[51:24] a guarantee
[51:28] we have the earnest
[51:48] foreigners in Christ Jesus
[51:51] when I do something bad
[51:59] I'm ready to repent anyone else that
[52:01] wants to live right with God
[52:04] you don't desire to do wrong
[52:10] but when Satan upsets you somewhere
[52:12] because there is an atonement waiting
[52:14] for me
[52:15] if I confess my wrong Joseph
[52:18] God's just to forgive it is
[52:21] and the same thing is when you've got
[52:23] you have no idea
[52:26] it's no sign that you're immune from
[52:29] sickness
[52:32] but in every time God is willing to
[52:35] deliver you from that sickness
[52:38] we're not above Temptation
[52:41] we're not above the trial
[52:44] we're not above doing what's wrong
[52:47] we're not above sickness
[52:51] but the key is to completely surrender
[52:54] ourselves to
[53:23] let us pray
[53:25] [Music]
[53:27] father of Glory
[53:31] [Music]
[53:32] thank you for everything you do for us
[53:36] thank you for the trials and temptations
[53:39] [Music]
