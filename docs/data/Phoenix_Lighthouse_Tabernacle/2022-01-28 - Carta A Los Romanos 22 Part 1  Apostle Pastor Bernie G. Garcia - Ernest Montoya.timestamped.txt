[16:41] capitolo
[16:43] romans chapter eight
[16:48] delbert
[16:50] [Music]
[17:01] we're happy that each and every one of
[17:03] you is here this morning
[17:06] [Music]
[17:11] [Music]
[17:29] [Music]
[17:43] [Music]
[17:56] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[17:58] god they are the sons of god
[18:01] for ye have not received the spirit of
[18:02] bondage again to fear but ye have
[18:05] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[18:07] we cry abba father
[18:09] the spirit itself bears witness with our
[18:11] spirit that we are the children of god
[18:14] and if children then heirs heirs of god
[18:17] and joint heirs with christ if so be
[18:20] that we suffer with him that we may also
[18:23] be glorified together for i reckon that
[18:26] the sufferings of this present time are
[18:27] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[18:30] which shall
[18:31] be revealed in us
[18:33] for the earnest expectation of the
[18:35] creature waits for the manifestation of
[18:37] the sons of god
[18:40] let us pray today
[18:55] [Music]
[19:08] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[19:19] [Music]
[19:25] [Music]
[19:30] okay
[19:39] [Music]
[19:54] [Music]
[20:02] oh
[20:05] [Music]
[20:20] we of course already know that this is a
[20:22] 22nd message in the subject entitled the
[20:25] letter to the romans
[20:33] and it's the second
[20:35] message with the
[20:36] subtitle of the manifestation of the
[20:38] sons of god
[20:46] we believe that this generation is a
[20:48] generation that will see the fullness of
[20:49] the manifestation of the sons of god
[20:58] this morning we do not have with us two
[21:00] of our brothers
[21:15] in brooklyn new york we were able to buy
[21:17] plane tickets for both brother lalo
[21:19] dries brother alex bruno jr they are
[21:21] both now right now in brooklyn new york
[21:25] assembly
[21:37] i also would like to say that the
[21:38] congregation of brother samuel johnson
[21:40] they paid and bought the tickets for
[21:42] both brother uh elliot colon and brother
[21:45] raul ramos to go to puerto rico
[21:50] they'll be leaving
[21:51] september 7th god willing
[21:55] let god help our brothers
[22:02] brother eddie sanchez is also sending
[22:04] greetings from the state of colorado
[22:08] the young man that's there right now
[22:12] several people have already asked for
[22:14] christian baptisms
[22:20] surely god has to bring out his
[22:21] predestinated seed regardless of where
[22:23] it says
[22:39] of those called
[22:40] [Music]
[22:42] elected
[22:43] [Music]
[22:44] commission
[22:45] anointed
[22:49] to tell mankind
[23:07] manifestation of the sons of god
[23:11] we're not waiting for a future time
[23:15] but rather this time that we're not
[23:16] living
[23:19] the manifestation of sons of god
[24:16] [Music]
[24:58] what belongs to
[25:12] is
[25:52] a real estate a home a car or a boat
[25:59] that's property to take possession of
[26:01] that property
[26:07] it's like one that receives a position
[26:08] of
[26:35] to be just mediocre
[26:49] she's the one that's leading her
[27:03] [Music]
[27:16] [Music]
[27:46] this is
[28:04] bless us now as we approach the word and
[28:06] father that knows the reason that i'm
[28:08] approaching the word from this very
[28:10] scripture here
[28:19] it's because i feel that you want me to
[28:21] do it this way that it's your divine
[28:23] will
[28:25] it's in your order
[28:28] it's the order of the
[28:30] [Laughter]
[28:39] to let the people positionally find
[28:41] their place and be ready for the hour
[28:43] [Laughter]
[28:55] each one of us has to find our position
[29:04] just like the brother said in his prayer
[29:05] to you not long ago
[29:10] oh you
[29:37] in order for them
[30:03] a degree or position of dignity
[30:21] [Laughter]
[31:00] [Laughter]
[31:19] but this time there should be children
[31:20] of god that are mature
[31:22] can you say that
[31:24] ranks
[31:39] apart from the adoption
[31:58] our sonship and godship
[32:07] we said that the first was a
[32:08] relationship of a son to a father
[32:12] and the other word in english significa
[32:17] godhead divinity
[32:18] deity
[32:41] the scripture
[32:47] and brother said that the man lost his
[32:50] place
[32:54] he lost his
[32:57] [Laughter]
[33:06] they say that people are so fanatical
[33:08] that they believe that man is god
[33:13] i want you to understand if you don't
[33:14] understand anything else
[33:16] for you to understand this
[33:18] that out of god's children
[33:21] our gods
[33:22] [Music]
[34:32] so if we
[35:14] i showed you the pyramid
[35:19] [Laughter]
[35:30] [Laughter]
[35:42] we have
[35:55] but sometimes we overlook those small
[35:56] things
[36:04] we have already said i've spoken about
[36:07] that first part upon which the
[36:08] foundation is based
[36:10] on
[36:38] do i have the holy
[36:49] [Music]
[36:51] seems like the question is still in the
[36:52] hearts of the people that hear the
[36:53] message
[36:56] how simple the message is
[37:02] the bible says that we do not have faith
[37:05] except we've been born again
[37:33] god's forgiveness
[38:05] [Laughter]
[38:15] [Laughter]
[38:29] is
[38:43] which are seven virtues
[38:44] [Laughter]
[38:56] [Music]
[39:00] [Laughter]
[39:17] [Laughter]
[39:37] is
[39:42] [Music]
[39:53] what do you think that is
[40:08] is
[40:20] the holy ghost
[40:49] so i'm going to start reading a little
[40:51] bit
[40:56] to be able to just kind of settle down
[40:59] establish that little part
[41:02] yes
[41:03] and then i don't know
[41:16] an adoption
[41:18] [Music]
[41:31] throughout the years
[41:45] so that way you can stand firm
[41:49] there won't be a devil to move
[41:53] there's a lot of devils a lot of demons
[41:56] and they try to move
[41:58] but once you know who you are
[42:13] once again
[42:25] [Music]
[42:31] [Music]
[43:13] [Laughter]
[43:32] [Music]
[43:38] because
[44:24] [Music]
[45:16] [Applause]
[45:50] if i'm a right inheritance of something
[45:52] if god is knocking in my heart and
[45:53] saying william branham i called you a
[45:55] long time ago before the foundation of
[45:57] the world to preach the gospel
[46:02] i have an inheritance and inheritance of
[46:03] eternal life
[46:13] now god has sent jesus to make that
[46:15] inheritance real to me because there was
[46:17] nothing i could do to inherit it
[46:23] it was blank it was valid
[46:38] but god in the fullness of time
[46:39] god sent in his own good time jesus a
[46:42] lamb slain from the before the
[46:43] foundation of the world
[46:51] his blood was shared that i might go to
[46:52] my inheritance but i said okay
[47:20] did you know that that man that are sons
[47:22] of god are amateur gods
[47:25] how many ever know that
[47:28] how many knows that jesus said so
[47:31] the bible says
[47:32] jesus said
[47:35] the officer did not
[47:39] [Laughter]
[47:58] [Music]
[48:32] just like brother chuck is
[48:36] and i was walking
[48:38] already
[48:43] i walked right by him and i said hi
[48:44] buddy
[48:52] [Music]
[48:58] but the man had the meaning over animals
[49:42] these days dogs will not no longer bite
[49:44] again
[49:48] to receive a kingdom of peace
[49:55] except the manifestation of the sons of
[49:56] god comes
[49:58] now
[50:07] that they were gods
[50:22] and he lost his god
[50:41] [Laughter]
[50:50] [Applause]
[50:52] scripture always used to
[50:54] raise up or bring up a lot of questions
[50:55] in me
[50:58] and i like to read it so that you can
[50:59] see it
[51:04] even though it doesn't go along with the
[51:05] subject but i'd want you to see it so
[51:07] you can not see it
[51:13] revelations 3 and verse 9.
[51:20] remember that part that i just finished
[51:21] saying a couple of minutes ago
[51:33] how many of you know the message also
[51:34] said
[51:42] [Music]
[51:48] disobedience
[52:02] i know that you
[52:30] so
[52:44] about to give birth to a baby
[52:46] the baby's in the boat
[52:49] of that
[52:51] it's a spirit already
[52:53] that's gonna go enter into that baby
[52:56] is it right
[53:12] deep
[53:27] [Music]
[53:44] behold i will make them
[53:46] of the synagogue of satan which say they
[53:49] are jews and are not
[54:04] i will make them to come and worship
[54:06] before thy feet and to know that i have
[54:08] loved thee
[54:16] it's a scripture that even though i had
[54:17] mentioned a lot it used to just astonish
[54:19] me
[54:22] but i believe that
[54:48] [Applause]
[54:50] is
[55:04] is that right
[55:15] [Music]
[55:19] a city and the houses are not finished
[55:23] and that's what happens
[55:28] and i was asked who lives in this house
[55:31] who lives in your house
[55:41] [Music]
[55:46] lives
[56:00] time to put on the ceiling so that it
[56:02] won't leak
[56:04] in other words you have to seal the
[56:05] house
[56:07] so nothing can come against the house
[56:12] it's placed on the house
[56:27] the son of god
[56:42] honey you're mine
[56:44] they say come here honey you're mine
[56:49] and you're mine also honey
[56:52] you're hugging your kids
[56:53] you embrace each other
[57:38] christ
[57:52] is
[58:06] jesus christ
[58:19] that's inside
[58:30] so let us go back return now
[58:47] he gave him a dominion over all things
[59:12] we are waiting for the manifestations of
[59:15] the sons of god who will come back and
[59:16] take
[59:57] when the power of god will walk out
[1:00:11] belongs to god
[1:00:24] can understand it
[1:00:27] [Music]
[1:00:28] [Applause]

[1:01:10] you'll see that
[1:01:15] [Music]
[1:02:09] so
