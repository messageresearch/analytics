glow Glory [Music] amen [Music] uh can everyone hear me all right that's my point in the house the Lord again each and every one of you and uh before anything I just want to start off with a quick prayer yeah Lord heavenly father father Celestial we thank you for another day of life you're giving us today we're allowing us to make it here safely allowing us to worship you know we thank you for all you do fathers that you take control of this service I help each and every speaker today that you help The Interpreter allow us to say the right words correct we thank you Father we have to take control of the service each and every person here Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen uh before anything I want to read the scripture the same scripture we've been reading Hebrews 9 11. 11 through 14. there is like this but Christ being calm and high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building foreign fifth blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean Sanctified to the purifying of the flesh is how much more shall the blood of Christ who though the eternal spirit offered himself without without spot to God versus the conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God is foreign we're going to be continuing with the topic of redemption so Redemption is an act of redeeming it's like a toning for a father mistake or the state of being redeemed you know because man was found guilty of sin we were born some people would ask the questions why did God do this so how many of you have ever heard the name John Newton John Newton for those who don't know he was the man that we know as amazing grace and so it's probably the most well-known Christian song There is a Christian Cristiano so how many of you know what he was before and so for those who don't know a slave ship was used for transporting slaves could you imagine being the captain of that kind of I was seeing a group of people go back and forth with no control over their own lives and and knowing they're owned by other people um how much the Lord Jesus Christ can change for example for example emotions and so what emotion would you have felt usted if you say a loved one enslaved is anger is a dangerous woman and the reason for that is because anger can prohibit us you know it could be it could be like a barrier so when we allow anger to stay in the presence we live in that type of state of mind we don't think clearly and we let our motion take take us by control we're not us anymore so but once we learn to take control it's one step closer because anger can not only be it's not only a bad thing it may you know depending on the situation and so excuse me and so what happens is so yeah it depends on the situation so anger is what sparked many great movements of change around the world you know for example we just talked about slavery President Lincoln is a great example he wanted to foreign so over 2400 U.S Personnel were killed and so seeing their own soldiers go down like that this is the U.S knew they had to do something yeah they could just stand by Otherwise who knows what could have happened next how many more lives would the country have lost and it becomes a problem if we looked you know because the devil wants us to get angry because if we get angry just like that we're doing say in a favor because there's a difference between reacting and responding okay reacting for example is when they're like punches doesn't mean so when we respond there's a difference we think and we take control of the situation and the reason for that is because we know so that could be for example foreign and so no matter what happens when put in a situation like that is read something from brothers and so it reads like this so there's no one in the world now get this real close there's no one in the world right now that could do one thing for you towards Divine Healing only to get you to believe in what Jesus has already done so people say I have healing power in my hands there's no such thing as that now you just you just get that away from me when anyone says you know they they may be honestly and Jesus Paid the full price only thing you do is accepted it says right there and Jesus Paid the full price at Calvary yeah perfect sacrifice man was found guilty of sin was because and now it will never do you no good until you accept it then you have to accept it it's not how hard you cry how much you persuade it's a surrendered heart surrendered with faith believing he done it so no matter how much you pray you'll never be forgivenado and so I guess you could call it a habit when we begin to doubt maybe sickness it puts you in fear you know um and so but it's those old habits that hold us back because man has but it doesn't work that way and because the prophet said by grace and so that's the only thing that could save you it's Grace it's La Gracia so it's important to have a faith and believing God because of his grace we are saved and so it's like the song Amazing Grace it's like it says it's God's Amazing Grace as a church as Christians we're all connected my God's Amazing Grace so but when put in a situation we seem to forget the most basic things you know like we said before there's reacting and responding and say we get sick and started I came across this quote I was researching one day and so I was I was talking about fear yesterday because fear is the is the one thing the devil can't put on to you I believe brother Branham said that it's the worst thing that we could put apart I found this quote and it says that even Kings get scared and I realized like what what does that means because when I read it I then realized this is the definition of a brave man um who conquers that fear because we all live with but we just should never try to let it win and uh my time is up yes uh I just want to say that it was good to talk in front of you oh yes being able to share this with you and just remember yeah we're Saved By God's Amazing Grace [Applause] yeah God bless you all this morning first off I want to thank God and my pastor for giving us this opportunity to speak in front of you be honest guys says and they wanted us to speak on the topic of redemption [Music] many different interpretations of redemptions for example according to the Oxford dictionary Oxford Redemption is the action of regaining or gaining possession of something in exchange for payment is clearing at that oh um uh but to us Redemption is the action of saving or being saved salvados who does the same oh who is the one that saved Kenneth Salva known as mismos is yours so if God is the one who is saving us then why don't we see Redemption happening in front of us that is all powerful it's so powerful that you can create universes with just his words if he's that powerful then surely you can save us right correct no no the reason why we don't see Redemption happening in front of us because God does not force change is [Music] like I'm not saying God can't do it he can surely do it he is after all powerful s us to choose otherwise we would be like machines and machines are only Pro programmed to do a certain tasks like like truly could be like machines program to the love and worship Him 24 7. which sounds great right okay but the problem with that it's not real okay a machine's love is a machine is merely an imitation it's an imitation of what a human can do is for example the the computer that's right correct there's one in our pockets right now you don't understand we'll see you um like we use it for a computer it has the power to uh to store gather and access information is just like a human I mean the only difference is that the brain that they the greater compute computers meaning that it can pull the information out of its uh from its uh memory quicker yes uh what makes an imitate imitation of the human brain is because uh because it's inferior to the human's brain's memory computer can only like the on average a computer can hold about eight gigabytes of memory well the human brain is can hold about 2.5 million gigabytes of memory Montana just in case of those who didn't care there's a there's a million in between now going back to God not forcing anything on us he oh where he does is just wait for our consent is allow us to change on the door and all we have to do is just answer yes the real question is why aren't we opening the door now one of the reasons why we don't open the door like my brother Nate said that we're too distracted and we're distracted by lies and uh our own mistakes we're distracted by the past and we allow that to determine we allow that to determine our future for example for example what if someone would say oh I can't do it look what happened last time or I made too many mistakes and I can't do it oh you said it does this is a person who says I can say yo puedo and the person who says I can't have one thing in common they're both right our past Mr pasado our history is meant to guide us is it should not determine what our future is going to be determination it may influence it will they influence for example if you make a mistake foreign the future isn't always going to be set in stone based on your past experiences God doesn't care what happened in the past he only cares what you do now and that is all I have written is God bless you [Applause] God bless you Brothers Lord Jesus Christ how many are happy to be here I'd like to give thanks to God in my pastor for giving me time to speak on do you have some words a topic that we've been speaking and I always think what am I going to say this time I think I've already said everything you always find something new amen amen don't says when we talk about the Plan of Redemption is something that doesn't go with the old nature it can't go together is that we have to change that nature we have to dedicate Our Lives and give God the control so he can remove that old human nature amen Brothers I was doing I was studying he and they say that a human changes for four reasons the first reason is when something hurts him enough to make him change the second reason is that they see something that inspires them to change and the third reason is they learn enough to want to change and the fourth reason is when they receive enough to be able to change I don't know if you've heard a story about me maybe my mom told the story foreign and I always ask my mom to make enchiladas so I was like what's what's going on with him he's always asking me for enchiladas and she would talk with my father and this is what I remember and then my dad told him Manila what's simple just make them about 40 enchiladas and whenever he asks you for some just get him out the fridge and warm them up and so she made them yeah and the day came was and so it was easy I knew they were in the fridge I would serve myself she made him that day and by the end of the day yeah there was no more I ate all 40 enchiladas in that one day and then I asked myself what's going on with my clothes did I wash it wrong what's up with the clothes but no brothers uh is for you and perhaps it's funny for me it's more sad that's where you begin to see if you want to change or not you want to change the way in which you're living a little loser does what's going on hurt you enough to want to to want to make you change are you inspired enough in my case I was inspired to go to the gym every day I just sometimes I gotta watch the Rocky movie um many times I do things without thinking of the consequences and why do we do these things is what I ask myself because if we don't have heart and we don't have God in our hearts then there's an emptiness there you know by [Music] someone's going to go to the things who they do the things they like supposedly to feel that emptiness it's different for each person but that emptiness it can't be compared to anything else because that emptiness is specifically for God that emptiness Only God Can Feel amen amen Brothers [Music] and I was reading a message by Brother Branham if you're a small quote before reading it I was listening to what my brother was saying we have to open our heart up to God no he's not just going to come and fill it without first opening up our heart to him because he is a gentleman he wants us to make that choice [Music] here brother Venom says he says that we may have everything we need but first we need God in the message questions and answers a hand can lay an egg but if she hasn't been with the rooster he'll never hatch noise it is infertile it hasn't got any blood in it is and that's just like what many times I've said a lot of these old churches around here you've got a bunch of eggs all right so it's so C that's right but they'll lay all right there is unless they gotta be with the mate Christ Jesus and being born again and filled with the Holy Ghost and then they've got life your screen they believe amen Brothers is that's where brother Brandon is trying to tell us we can come to church we can read our Bible but if we don't have the Lord Jesus Christ in our hearts if we don't have the Holy Spirit because no life will come from our life Lord Jesus Christ wants to use each one of us to go reach out to other lost souls Brothers As We Know [Music] the world wants to destroy us [Music] we are focused on what they say over here when they say over there when the story of brother Brandon was there was a big rooster feathers las Plumas las Plumas the feathers were shining he was telling the other animals that were there I have found one way to have the best feathers everybody was excited listening you and there comes another little rooster or little small chicken and had almost no feathers or skinny and he comes as I also have news we're all going to the slaughterhouse tonight the world might show you a beautiful image but here the word of God is telling you that we're at the end time that we have to be prepared amen all right God's love Brothers love is not just a feeling many of us have in our mind solo ES we can see oh how beautiful it feels now I know that I am in love that's not love is what you do without mattering what what you feel El Amor is love is fighting for the good of another person that person never sees the sacrifice you're making for them he wasn't saying Oh what a beautiful day it is oh the wind is really nice oh look at these nails they felt excellent no brothers that love that he was feeling at that moment I heard him so much brothers okay [Music] that's the worst he could have ever lived again I think he would respond yes because you know the value that each one of you have it he knows just you're worth more than 10 000 worlds it's something so precious we could see with the eyes of the Lord Jesus Christ we could see why he loves us so much then we have to give ourselves more to him is it's a relationship between two it's not just the Lord Jesus Christ you have to walk towards each other amen Brothers this is what I had in my heart Brothers [Music] if you're needing something this morning it's a Time don't wait for another day because tomorrow is not promised it's today so today as If Today Was Your Last Day on Earth we have to live that way as if they were our last day we hear that a person here left with the Lord another person here left with the Lord they were 22 years old we don't know when the Lord will call us home we can go to sleep and now wake up the next day so Brothers yeah okay let's change that way of thinking [Music] and try every day to be better try to use every second that we have and take that Advantage the most we can yeah amen Brothers okay okay let us please stand they're in your heart Brothers you speak with the Lord and he will answer and he will provide what you need let us bear heads Heavenly Father remember firstly we thank you for how great you are without you lord we wouldn't be able to do anything [Music] you wouldn't be able to come here to church and worship your sweet name that great sacrifice that you did for us Lord [Music] it's something that we're going to try our best [Music] so that we can have a better relationship with you that is what we desire help my brother's father we all need more from you in our lives we need you to fill our hearts with your beautiful love that Divine love father so that we can we can take it to other people so that other people may know you [Music] other people may see what the love of God is father we put it all in your hands the person in the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen [Music] who lost my soul [Music] painless Bridges [Music]
