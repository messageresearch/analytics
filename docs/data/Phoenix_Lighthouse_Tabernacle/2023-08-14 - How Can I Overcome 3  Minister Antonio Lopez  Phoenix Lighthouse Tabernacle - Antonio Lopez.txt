we'll get you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ how many are happy to be here there's bar heads my heavenly father we first thank you for the privilege to be able to be here for your mercy for your sacrifice father we wouldn't be here this evening it's a perfect sacrifice we're indebted to you for the rest of time there is nothing we could do to repay you father but to open our hearts and submit our life to you place all of this in your hands father s when you anoint my lips my interpreter that we may receive what you have prepared for us and be able to apply it in our lives in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen we could please open up our scriptures we'll be going to the Book of John says it'd be chapter 16 verse 33. we can indicate it with an amen once you have it it is I'm going to read is affliction Al Mundo these things have I spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace and the word ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world one more scripture Brothers it'll be in the Book of Revelations beat chapter three versiculous we'll be reading verses five and six is a Blancas inaudible either overcometh the same shall be cloth and white Raymond and I will not plot his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels let him hear the spirit set unto the churches amen amen you may take your seats Brothers to be here this evening I thank God in my passage for this opportunity it's something that militants because we want to do the will of God in our life man amen you almost hear it we're going to continue on the topic how can I overcome um and I put it as a subtitle having the mind of Christ [Music] it's difficult with traffic but God has given us the strength to be here this evening and he will reward you um I have a few questions I'll be asking as I go along with my thoughts and those questions are for everyone we can't do it like a hot potato we can't just pass it to the side or to the back these questions are for everyone no one can say well maybe it helps more of the other brother we all need it man amen foreign [Music] I need salvation those are all correct amen Brothers [Music] and if you're here it's because you're a son or a daughter of God if you come to church wanting to or not wanting to is you listen to the word of God and I believe that there is no coincidences [Music] because when we listen the word to the word of God is because it is for us it's not just because we're passing by and we happen to catch something if we listen to it it is because it is for us amen amen is in which he touches on this point I've read it before here and it's one of my favorite quotes in the message questions the answers on the seals it says now remember Jesus came to be a witness as a savior of the world correcto is that right well there was just people after people after people after races after people that never even knowed nothing about it went right on just like the world knoweth nothing about it but all the time that was going on the world the largest class was performing all of his miracles [Music] he was walking here on Earth but there was people who still didn't know nothing about it but in other parts of the world they never knew anything about the Lord Jesus and why did that happen okay he says why didn't he let them know he came and the ones that were predestinated to eternal life were the ones that received him there'd be no good to say anything to the rest of them because he would not have redeemed them because they wasn't even redeemable why was it when those priests stood there okay because the predestinator was plotted out in there all around so he had to preached them as a group so what I take from this quote is that we're all listening to the word of God we all know about the Lord Jesus Christ we all know the sacrifice he did for us so it's telling us that we are redeemable that we can receive him it's a decision that we have to take amen amen and another question it's a question that we all ask ourselves do I have the Holy Spirit this is sometimes we think about those things especially after we fails we ask ourselves do I really have the Holy Spirit why do I do these things why do I keep making the same mistakes and many people are individuals they start to criticize themselves they think that they're Hypocrites because they're struggling to overcome sometimes we struggle to get up in the morning foreign [Music] instances so when you're born again you still make mistakes but now it's different when you make those mistakes well now you feel better you know good and wrong you know that there's a better life there's a higher life when we're born again he you know and one is born again you know you were born again because you have that desire to be free you no longer want to be part of that world you know that you continue doing the same things you're going to finish off with just where you started or even worse amen Brothers [Music] at the same time they're battling or struggling praying [Music] you get frustrated because you're making the same mistakes you feel like you're stuck and we want to move forward so many times God has plans God lead us in that place for a good amount of time until we learned that lesson that God has for us God is not just going to give us a trial not just so you have something to do there's always a lesson to learn from that trial [Music] it's something so you can get closer you can continue to grow as a Christian each trial is that is what it's for he [Music] how would you know good from bad so what I want to say brothers um there's another voice there one voice tells you to do good and the other voice you have to make that decision so that voice that tells you to do good is where the holy spirit is maybe you're not completely filled to 100 at one time you'll always give you little by little depending depending on how much trust you place in God if God sees that you are growing will give you more and more of the holy spirit amen Brothers e ingalatas and in Galatians uh the CR commonly spiritual this is how the spirit and the flesh are constantly fighting it's in chapter 5 verse 17. he said it says that this the flesh is contrary to the spirit in the spirit is contrary to the flesh so there it tells you when you have the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is going to fight against your own flesh and if you didn't have the Holy Spirit and the flesh would do what it wants to do no one's going to fight against your own flesh that nature that we have originally it's incorrect we need that new birth e e in another question who likes to forgive me as well like our brother says I know foreign many people don't forget because the thing that forgiveness is for the other person that is for the person that Did You Wrong they're going to think that if you forgive them then maybe they were right argument that they won the argument that's not the way it is not to validate what the other person did and it does not make you weak a lot of the world thinks that way if I forgive them they're going to think I'm weak and they can do whatever they want with me that's not the way it is when we forgive Brothers is that I'm willing to cancel out the debt completely not because what the other person did is right but because it makes us free it sets us free and so when we forgive that sets us free when we give that forgiveness it's like a sacrifice there's also a reward when we forgive we receive the forgiveness from God we receive peace thinking so we can have more peace how many are with me Brothers you win and continue to have a couple minutes more um many times Brothers [Music] I was reading a small core small paragraph they had here they have it in a frame of brother Branham its prayer is not necessarily bringing God to the level of man so you know must be in uh but more so it elevates man to the level of God many times we think that let God come it's way too difficult here but no that's not the right way to think we have to leave from here one day we will leave from here we're going to go to a place with him that he has amen Brothers why doesn't God just show me the plan exactly how it is why do we have to have so many Mysteries he only shows me how it ends and that's about it but it tells us everything that we have to go through and we're going to get scared because the Lord Jesus Christ that is the image of the Lord Jesus Christ he had to go through many trials everything that we've been tempted by he was tempted by it as well amen Brothers he is [Music] it's all something that's very painful so instead of hanging on to both sides it's better to leave that of the world and go with the Lord Jesus Christ we don't have to go to that process of so much pressure coming to our lives it's much more easy it shouldn't matter to you what the world thinks first of all the world is not thinking about you say yes it doesn't say if you decide to come with us then we're going to treat you better no Hermanos no brother whether you go the good way or the bad way amen Brothers he foreign that's where we're struggling amen Brothers it's something to finish here I don't know if you've heard when an eagle and a crow fight when a crow fights with an eagle it grabs onto the back of an eagle [Music] and what do you think the eagle does Eagle does nothing is very simple what the eagle does the eagle doesn't fight it doesn't waste his energy thinking on the crow no it just does one thing it begins to fly higher Ebola in the higher and higher it flies foreign all right thank you for your attention Brothers whatever you may need ask for it to God this is the time this is the place as I tell you crows will fall off by themselves we have to go to a higher level the crows are not going to fall if you stay there falling on the ground you have to go up higher you have to lift yourself up and God will handle the rest Amen Let Us bow our heads Lord Jesus Christ we want to let you know that we love you we ask you for forgiveness anything that we may have done that has not pleased we ask for forgiveness at this moment you help us get closer to you father you help us in our trials but that you may never remove them those trials are so precious to us [Music] [Music] the name of Lord Jesus Christ amen amen thank you [Music] is easy when you're up on the map and you've got peace [Music] [Applause] [Music] change when you're down in the valley oh don't lose me [Music] never alone [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] down or drugs and temptations [Music] [Music] still got [Applause] to God the god [Music] amen [Applause] we've come this far my veins [Music] trusting in his holy word remember man [Music] oh we can't turn back [Music] now [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh we cannot [Music] amen foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] we have come to the final portion of this service but now before reading of a couple of announcements on behalf of our pastor doctrines
