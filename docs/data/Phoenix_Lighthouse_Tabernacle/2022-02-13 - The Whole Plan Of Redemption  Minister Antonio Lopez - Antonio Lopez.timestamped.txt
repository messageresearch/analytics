[33:00] verse 11 we'll start with joseph
[33:04] you can say man when you have it
[33:13] and the word reads
[33:15] but christ being come in high priest of
[33:18] good things to come by a greater and

[33:23] hands
[33:25] that is to say not of this building
[33:28] foreign
[33:38] neither by the blood of goats and caps
[33:41] but by his own
[33:43] by his own blood he entered in once
[33:46] into the holy place having obtained
[33:48] eternal redemption for us
[33:50] you
[34:02] [Music]
[34:04] in the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the
[34:07] unclean sanctify sanctify it to the
[34:10] purifying of the flesh
[34:28] how much more shall the blood of christ
[34:30] who through the eternal spirit offered
[34:32] himself without spot
[34:35] to god purge your conscience from their
[34:37] works to serve the living god
[34:59] thanking you for your grace and mercy
[35:03] for your protection
[35:06] these days
[35:08] they haven't been easy for anybody
[35:13] so much out there in the world
[35:16] but you've kept the safe lord
[35:19] and we thank you lord
[35:20] gracias father if we've done something
[35:22] against our word
[35:26] we ask for forgiveness
[35:41] father
[35:42] as we hear your word
[35:46] may those chains start to fall lord
[35:50] may
[35:51] we feel that freedom you give us lord
[35:56] when your
[36:02] [Music]
[36:08] all we want to do is serve you father
[36:11] and the only thing
[36:13] we only want to say what you want us to
[36:15] say
[36:18] in the name of our lord jesus christ
[36:22] you may take your seats
[36:31] mexico and mexico and um
[36:34] and all over the united states
[36:37] god bless you
[36:39] thank you for tuning in
[36:43] i want to thank god for this opportunity
[36:48] our pastor
[36:50] pastor
[36:51] loaning me his pulpit foreign
[37:12] how many i see that you all came very
[37:14] happy to the
[37:15] house of the lord
[37:18] hey man i see how beautiful you all look
[37:23] but how many of you came with the
[37:24] expectation
[37:28] i'm not saying
[37:30] demanding
[37:33] but a humble expectation expectation um
[37:36] wanting to change for the lord jesus
[37:38] christ
[37:41] we're going to stay with the same
[37:43] topic
[37:46] same subject the plan of redemption
[37:50] and i wanted to ask you
[37:53] when was your last experience with god
[37:56] experience
[37:57] was it this morning
[37:59] was it yesterday
[38:01] last week
[38:04] so it's very important
[38:07] and when we come to the house of the
[38:08] lord
[38:10] we already come uh
[38:12] with some energy
[38:16] we don't come to the house of the lord
[38:19] unprepared
[38:21] if we come prepared already
[38:24] it makes things a lot easier that
[38:25] atmosphere just it's already there
[38:28] is
[38:33] so it's always be it's always good to
[38:35] get that experience daily
[38:39] being around the word of god
[38:42] because at the end of the day
[38:44] it's the only thing that can satisfy our
[38:46] soul
[38:49] we can buy everything we want
[38:53] we can have a new house
[38:57] but before we go to sleep
[39:10] and as we see
[39:12] ourselves and everyone in the world
[39:14] today
[39:17] sometimes we we do get stressed out
[39:22] our daily
[39:23] or our daily things we do the daily
[39:26] things we do
[39:28] our work
[39:30] our finances
[39:32] financials are our family or familia
[39:35] problems are going to come that's
[39:36] problem
[39:37] and that's going to bring stress in our
[39:39] lives
[39:45] we see that people can can't handle that
[39:47] stress anymore
[39:52] they prefer to take their own life away
[40:03] our minds don't stop thinking about our
[40:04] problems
[40:07] we can't go to sleep anymore we can't
[40:10] have that peace we once had
[40:13] so that's when
[40:15] we have to come to the lord
[40:18] and just
[40:18] give it all to him
[40:20] let him take care of it
[40:37] and as we know if we continue thinking
[40:38] about it
[40:41] it might bring anger
[40:43] it might bring depression
[40:45] all that bitterness
[40:48] and if we think on it for so long
[41:03] i always see
[41:05] god as a gentleman
[41:09] he's waiting for us to
[41:11] make that decision
[41:15] to follow him
[41:18] to serve him
[41:20] because he's not going to come one day
[41:24] and he's going to be like
[41:26] i'm tired of
[41:27] antonio estoy
[41:29] antonio i'm just going to
[41:31] do it for him
[41:33] i'm going to take that snake away from
[41:34] his heart
[41:37] and i'm going to fill him with the holy
[41:38] spirit
[41:40] if he wants it or not i'm just going to
[41:41] do it okay and why is the way i said
[41:44] no he's not like that brothers
[41:47] he's waiting for you to make that
[41:48] decision
[41:51] man so redemption
[41:54] i was speaking last time i spoke a
[41:56] little bit of redemption
[42:00] i was talking about accepting redemption
[42:04] so
[42:04] that's one of the first things we have
[42:06] to accept
[42:09] so
[42:10] the plan of redemption can activate
[42:27] well the plan of redemption
[42:31] um
[42:33] how is the lord jesus christ
[42:37] died for us for our sins
[42:40] not in vain
[42:42] so we have to make sure that it wasn't
[42:44] unveiled
[42:47] we have to do our part
[42:49] and now that it's uh we're close pretty
[42:52] much a day away from valentine's day
[42:56] that's pretty much the last our love
[42:59] story here as christians
[43:03] when he died for us for our sins
[43:06] we it's that unconditional love he had
[43:09] for us
[43:24] and it's still with us today
[43:28] and as i was saying earlier
[43:31] uh we have to come with the correct
[43:33] attitude to church amen
[43:39] i confess that sometimes when i'm
[43:41] praying confess
[43:44] sometimes i'll be praying and i'll go
[43:46] straight into my problems
[43:50] um i forget to thank god
[44:08] that's another place where we have to
[44:10] have the correct attitude
[44:14] if you want your prayer to work
[44:17] you want god to listen to your prayers
[44:34] god revealing himself to his people
[44:39] just what i was trying to do to the to
[44:41] the woman
[44:43] was get her in the right mental attitude
[44:48] she wouldn't have she wouldn't have to
[44:49] be prayed for
[44:51] necessarily
[44:52] the right mental attitude
[44:55] towards any promise of god
[44:58] will bring it to pass
[45:00] do you believe that
[45:02] amen so that's all we have to have
[45:05] that correct attitude
[45:09] and
[45:11] by activating redemption
[45:13] uh god's redemption in our lives
[45:52] and
[45:54] sometimes we feel like things aren't for
[45:56] us amen
[45:59] or sometimes we feel like we don't
[46:00] deserve them
[46:04] that's that's my case many times
[46:07] and i and i have to
[46:09] get get out of that spirit
[46:50] there was a case
[46:51] tried on that in the federal courts of
[46:54] our land
[46:58] a man had committed a crime and the
[47:00] governor of the state has sentencing to
[47:03] be shot
[47:09] or to be killed by public execution
[47:14] and while the man was in prison waiting
[47:16] his time to of execution
[47:23] someone interceded to the governor until
[47:25] the governor found reasons to pardon the
[47:27] man
[47:33] the governor wrote just a little line
[47:36] on a piece of paper and signed his name
[47:43] this man is pardoned governor so and on
[47:47] so and so este hombre especially
[47:52] and when it was brought to the man
[47:55] showed him by his attorney
[48:00] he said
[48:01] i will not receive it
[48:05] a pardon's got more to to it than that
[48:10] i believe it's bogus
[48:13] therefore
[48:14] i believe someone's trying to put
[48:16] something over on me
[48:18] again
[48:22] how that the devil says the same thing
[48:24] to the church tonight
[48:29] the bible's
[48:31] misinterpreted
[48:46] we hear the stories of moses
[48:50] we hear the stories of abraham
[48:54] and we say well that was for that
[48:56] generation
[49:00] what about us now
[49:02] but
[49:03] no it's it's still for us as well
[49:05] brothers
[49:07] what they went through over there
[49:10] and they did to
[49:12] get closer to god
[49:14] it still
[49:20] amen amen
[49:24] and
[49:25] we make mistakes daily yes does eastside
[49:27] do
[49:42] you have to build a new place
[49:45] not patch up the old one
[49:48] but build a new one
[49:52] not too long ago i don't know if it was
[49:53] a year ago or two years ago did you uh
[49:55] hear in the news
[50:09] and it killed a lot of people
[50:13] well they were saying that that building
[50:16] had they were they were looking at the
[50:18] past history of the building
[50:22] and they saw that there were there were
[50:23] faults in the
[50:33] and um
[50:35] they just did like little patches here
[50:37] and there you know
[50:40] but they never truly fixed the problem
[50:44] so now the bigger uh
[50:46] the bigger problem came and the building
[50:48] fell down
[50:52] and a lot of lives
[51:04] when you make a mistake
[51:09] you can't just patch it up here
[51:11] and just forget about it
[51:15] you have to go right to the root of the
[51:16] problem
[51:19] take away what's bad
[51:34] in so a little bit of when i was
[51:37] studying here for on the planet of
[51:39] redemption
[51:43] i was a
[51:44] thought came into my into my mind
[51:49] identifying
[51:50] or identifica identification
[51:53] identification ourselves
[51:56] as the bride
[52:00] and also identifying our advisor
[52:17] so those are the questions that come up
[52:18] as soon as you start hearing about this
[52:21] subject
[52:26] and one time i heard brother carlos
[52:30] preaching
[52:44] them
[52:47] amen
[52:54] as soon as we identify the tricks of the
[52:56] devil
[52:58] the faster we become overcomers
[53:02] example when
[53:05] a brother comes and you're talking with
[53:06] a brother
[53:09] and he says something you didn't like or
[53:13] or anything that you were not
[53:16] agreeing with
[53:22] and now you have something against that
[53:24] brother
[53:27] well before you have something against
[53:28] the brother antes
[53:30] hermano you can
[53:32] if you can identify the devil
[53:34] diablo then you can see that it wasn't
[53:37] the brother
[53:40] it was something else
[53:44] and there's no reason for you to have
[53:45] something against that brother
[53:49] you can easily
[53:52] uh put it to a side
[53:55] and completely forget about it
[53:58] because many times
[53:59] i know it because of me i sometimes
[54:01] don't even know what i said
[54:05] where i feel like it's uh what i'm
[54:07] saying
[54:08] is not going to offend anybody
[54:12] but at the end of the day it does offend
[54:14] somewhere
[54:18] so
[54:20] the
[54:22] sometimes a brother would say well
[54:23] brother i just can't forgive that
[54:24] brother
[54:28] he
[54:29] he did this already more than once
[54:33] i feel like he's doing it on purpose
[54:37] and
[54:38] once once they mess with me i'm done
[54:40] with them
[54:44] one time i um at work
[54:48] this there was a nurse and a doctor
[54:49] they're always
[54:54] and
[54:56] the doctors are very specific very picky
[54:58] i understand that
[55:00] specifically
[55:02] and
[55:03] an inch or a centimeter if the head is
[55:05] not positioned a centimeter or off a
[55:08] centimeter from the place they want it
[55:14] and they'll make a big deal about it
[55:32] and she's like he he messed with me i'm
[55:35] and it it's really hard for me to trust
[55:37] that person again
[55:42] and
[55:43] i don't know if i'm going to be able to
[55:45] be around him anymore
[55:50] so that's that's just a little example
[55:52] this is an example of how we can
[55:56] uh do things bigger
[55:58] and by listening to the wrong voice yeah
[56:10] we know it's going to guide us in the
[56:11] right direction
[56:14] we know it's going to guide us to
[56:15] forgiveness
[56:18] we know it's going to guide us leave it
[56:19] to god
[56:22] amen amen
[56:24] i have a personal story myself
[56:28] in my family not as much anymore
[56:32] but we in our birthdays
[56:35] we would uh
[56:36] get the the person the
[56:38] the person that's having the birthday
[56:41] person
[56:42] and we'll put the cake in there we'll
[56:43] put their face in the cake
[56:48] so one time that happened to me they put
[56:50] my face in the cake
[56:57] and i was like and this is in december
[57:01] because that's uh and
[57:03] and i was like man when is his birthday
[57:07] i want to get him back
[57:10] this is and just think about it his
[57:12] birthday is still september
[57:15] i'm already planning for it
[57:21] i'm not going to say which brother noise
[57:25] but i is have two no
[57:27] hermanos
[57:28] you have a 50-50 shot
[57:32] so i was already planning for it
[57:36] so
[57:37] the day comes
[57:44] but the cake was made out of ice cream
[57:49] so it was it was harder than usual
[58:05] and we put his face into the uh to the
[58:07] cake
[58:10] and the cake barely got a little dumb
[58:12] from the nose
[58:18] the only words i remember saying i
[58:20] remember him saying
[58:23] is that
[58:24] he felt little tears coming out of his
[58:26] eyes
[58:29] from the
[58:31] from his nose being smashed into the
[58:32] cake
[58:35] so it's just
[58:37] even a small thing like that
[58:41] all that can be avoided
[58:44] um
[58:46] just by listening to god the most poor
[58:56] we're going to make mistakes
[58:57] automatically
[59:01] because we're going to be hearing the
[59:02] wrong voice
[59:15] preach for
[59:16] so many years 120 years
[59:22] the same thing
[59:24] god was coming
[59:27] the flood was coming
[59:30] and
[59:31] there was going to be an arc
[59:34] and if you get if you repent from your
[59:36] sins
[59:39] you would and get in that arc
[59:44] but nobody would listen
[59:47] they think he was crazy
[59:51] and the only people at the end of the
[59:52] day
[59:55] that listen to him was his own family
[1:00:25] and he still was obedient to god
[1:00:30] it's just um
[1:00:31] very tremendous
[1:00:34] just to see how much obedience a person
[1:00:37] can have towards god
[1:00:42] so
[1:00:43] we are the bride of the lord amen
[1:00:47] and being the bride of the lord
[1:00:50] we are part of the plan of redemption
[1:00:53] of
[1:00:56] pretty much
[1:00:57] the plan of redemption
[1:01:01] is to find that bride of the lord
[1:01:05] so they can reunite once again
[1:01:10] i was
[1:01:11] hearing uh
[1:01:12] another message
[1:01:16] brother brown message
[1:01:18] the five uh five uh
[1:01:20] definite in the identifications of the
[1:01:23] true church of the living god
[1:01:25] identification
[1:01:29] we'll start reading a little bit on that
[1:01:31] and then uh after this quote i'm going
[1:01:34] to start closing
[1:01:37] well
[1:01:38] what was the
[1:01:40] speckled verb
[1:01:43] i defer the i differ with the guy that
[1:01:46] said that was wrong
[1:01:51] what was the speckled bird of the bible
[1:01:56] it was not israel no era israel as they
[1:01:59] said it was
[1:02:02] it was the church of jesus christ
[1:02:06] so who here is the church of jesus
[1:02:07] christ
[1:02:09] i believe we're all or
[1:02:12] so this is for us here
[1:02:16] for a sin offering
[1:02:31] and poured the blood upon the living
[1:02:33] mate
[1:02:37] and turned the maid loose
[1:02:41] and the mate sprinkled
[1:02:44] is with the blood of the dead mate
[1:02:49] went across the earth
[1:02:52] sprinkling as he flew his wings
[1:02:58] and the blood splashing upon the earth
[1:03:00] cried holy holy holy unto the lord
[1:03:09] amen amen and that was a type of christ
[1:03:14] and the great sparkled bird is the
[1:03:16] church
[1:03:19] that's been specked by the blood of the
[1:03:22] dead of its dead
[1:03:28] the survivor jesus christ el salvador
[1:03:30] jesus christ
[1:03:32] and
[1:03:33] she's crossing the world today
[1:03:37] flopping her wings
[1:03:39] crying holy holy holy unto the lord
[1:03:50] i'm so glad my name is on her book
[1:03:56] put there not by my goodness
[1:04:00] no sir no
[1:04:01] i never
[1:04:02] i'd never be there
[1:04:05] or by your goodness
[1:04:07] but by the goodness and mercies of god
[1:04:18] what is the identification
[1:04:21] of the church
[1:04:24] what is
[1:04:37] jesus
[1:04:38] christ not a bishop no no bispo not the
[1:04:42] catholic church no glacier catholic
[1:04:46] not luther
[1:04:48] not wesley no wesley no sir no senior
[1:04:51] who set it up
[1:05:16] we can get to heaven
[1:05:18] can we get to heaven without it
[1:05:23] for those that are dead
[1:05:25] in christ will god bring with him
[1:05:30] and not not any anyone else
[1:05:33] but those who are dead in christ
[1:05:39] jesus is coming for those that are dead
[1:05:41] in christ
[1:05:44] he says
[1:05:45] in galatians
[1:05:46] he's saying ephesians 4 chapter 4 and
[1:05:49] then he corrects himself uh galatians
[1:05:52] i believe it is
[1:05:53] the fourth chapter
[1:06:00] said that those that are dead in christ
[1:06:46] it's all worth it at the end of the day
[1:06:49] it's an eternity with our lord jesus
