TRANSCRIPT
========================================
our amen We Believe don't know any longer there's nothing to live for only to get other saved is the best that I know now tonight we want to just start a little background of our previous lesson and I will try to read because the entire chapter if I can tonight so Sunday morning I'll have to maybe push in both Sunday morning and night that's all right to try to get in this setting of what I want the church to see oh it's glorious to find your position and no one can do anything unless you know properly what you're doing you know what if you were going to be have an operation and there was a young doctor that had just come from school that he would never had an operation before or yet he was young and handsome and his hair was comb slick and he was dressed very fine natal and everything and he said I've sharpened the knives and I've sterilized all the tools and things you'd have a little funny feeling about that I'd rather have an old doctor had went through that operation many times before before I want to be cut him I want to know somebody not just out of school I with somebody with some experience and the best experience I call on tonight is the holy spirit he's God's Great physician and great teacher and is backgrounding my message tonight still from Sunday sermon that it is they rejected Samuel with the word of the Lord and accepted Saul the son of and rejected Samuel which represent the holy spirit because he only spoke as the spirit led him to speak and when he called their attention to it he said remember I've never said nothing to you in the name of the Lord but what the Lord brought it to pass neither have I walked mavenly before you and no one can accuse me of sin like Jesus said who can condemn me of sin and he said again that I have not come to you and begged you for money and so forth I've nothing from you but all that I have said has been for your good that I have brought to you from the mouth of the Lord and all the people give witness that's true all that's true but still we want to have a king we want to be like the rest of the world now tonight our scripture is dividing the book of Ephesians is the Book of Joshua of the New Testament diving up and setting in order the overcome one now just a background for a few minutes to get a place before we start reading beginning with the third verse now we find last Sunday night that the god in the Old Testament had made Israel a promise of a land of rest because they had become pilgrims and [Music] wonders and they were in a land that wasn't their God had promised to Abraham that his sojourn his seed would souljourn for 400 years and a strange people be mistreated but by a strong hand he had bring them out into a goodly land that was Flo with milk and honey and now when the time of the promise Drew n God raised up someone to bring them to that land how many in the class tonight who that one knows who that one was notice a very very real type of our one that was given to bring us to the promised land Christ now we have a promise because our promise is spiritual rest for theirs was physical rest and so they was coming to a land that they could say This Is Our Land we are no more wanders we've settled down this is our land and here we have rest we'll plant our corn our Vineyard and we'll eat from our vineard then when we pass on we'll leave it to our children oh how we could go into the land of it the laws of inheritance like neom Ruth Bo all that back how a brother in Israel how that he must anything that he had lost must be Redeemed by a Kinsman how beautiful it would take weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks we' never leave this chapter to go to we can TI entire Bible right into here right into this one chapter and oh I just love to study it we used to take it and take it for a year and a half and never leave a book stay right with it now but it was such a great thing that the inheritance how it was that an inheritance in the land that no one else but a close Kinsman could redeem that inheritance now let me just drop on a little token here that I touched on the night you mother how many of you prayed for your loved ones lost all right there you are again see your [Music] inheritance see Paul told the Romans said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou and thy house shall be saved You' got faith enough for your own self to be saved have faith enough no matter how wavered that boy is or that girl is they'll be saved anyhow God somehow if you has to lay them on their back Lan in a hospital dying they'll be saved God promised it The Inheritance oh and they shall be there is all their offsprings with them oh yes that they shall not hurt or resty all my Holy Mountain sayth the Lord oh i' got a little spot I hope I can get to tonight for just burning in my heart that comes back to that but now on forward then did you notice Moses that great miracle performer that brought down Israel down to the land and brought them up to the promised land but did not Place their inheritance to them he did not give them their inheritance he led them up to the land but joshu divided the land to the people that right and Christ brought the church up to the place the were their possession was made to them was given to them just cross but the holy spirit is the one who sets the church in [Music] order the Joshua of today puts the church in its order giving to each one gifts plac and he is the voice of God speaking to the inner man that Christ has saved the Holy Spirit how do you get that much of it we're getting over into the book of Ephesians now the same way he's positionally placing the church where they belong Joshua placed them in the natural land now the holy spirit is placing the church positionally in the land that they in the position that they belong in their inheritance now the first thing he starts off here he addresses his letter Paul which we're going to find out that all this mystery was revealed to him not in a seminary not by any Theologian but it was a divine revelation of the Holy Ghost that God gave Paul knowing that the mystery of God he said that had been hid since the foundation of the world had been revealed to him the ho and the Holy Spirit amongst the people was setting each one in all hard setting the church in position now the first thing Paul starts out here to tell the people is to get all remember this is to the church not to The Outsider it's mystery and riddles to him never able to understand goes over the top of his head he does more know about it than nothing but to the church it's Honey in the Rock it's joy unspeakable it's a Blessed [Music] Assurance it's an anchor of the Soul It's Our Hope and stay God it's a Rock of Ages oh it's everything that is good and Earth will pass away but God's word shall never pass away but the man outside of Canaan knows nothing of it he's still wandering not saying that he's not a good man I don't say that I don't say the man even in Egypt's not a good man but he until he has come over into this [Music] possession and the possession that the promise that was given to the church is not a natural land but a spiritual land for we are a royal priesthood a holy nation in this royal priesthood holy nation pecular people called out elected chosen set aside then all the world is dead on the outside and we are led by the spirit Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God Amen not by man but by the spirit all in love the whole thing is buled up out this has been tried to be taught on many times no doubt what great theologians has struck it lot deeper than I could but the thing I want to try to get to you is this that a man that is in Christ with the Holy Ghost can bear with a man when he's wrong long suffering gentle patient he's sweet humble faith fill with the spirit never negative always positive he's a different person not just the man that we once had it if we shouted we had it us Methodist all when we shouted we was in the land that's good that's all right I believe that too then the Pentecostal come along speaking with tongues they had it everyone spoke a Tong head it I believe that too but still we found out there lot didn't have it yet now there we are now coming to this great hidden Mystery amen that's been hid since the foundation of the world and now being revealed in the last days to the sons of God you believe that to be true that sons of God are manifested before we even go anywhere let's turn over to Romans 8th chapter just a minute let me read see if this is this coming up the what I'm speaking of here now we go get Romans 8 the 19th verse of the um of the eth chapter of Romans for the earnest expectation the creation waiteth for the manifestations of the sons of god with Earnest expectations the whole creation is waiting for the manifestation see the manifestation what is the manifestation making know the whole world theam over here they're looking for all around everywhere they're looking for where is these people we've had the we've had a mighty Russian wind we've had Thunders Lightnings we've had o and blood we've had all kinds of things but we fail to hear

day today uh it's not hot and it's not cold going introduce our guest speaker and we were talking a little bit and the more I talked with him had to reminisce all these years that have gone by God I just can't believe it we've known each other for more or less 45 years I've been in the message I'm not going to tell you but it's been a while the message has been a blessing it's something that we live something that we love we love our messenger uh without him where would we be today so I count my blessings and I look at the old uh guard if I want to say it that way we coming up we're young I I I mean I I go back and I'm telling myself where were my 20s where were my stop there then I look at individuals and I tell myself that Banner is still as strong today as it was back then and that's what I love about the message it gets stronger in us we are what we are We Are The Bride of Jesus Christ today because we're the Bride of Jesus Christ the word is in us the word is in us and we are are that word that's what I love about this message so when I see my [Music] friend I always laugh please excuse me and uh he looks like an actor I'm not going to mention the name but he's still the same I look at him I said the guy doesn't change Joanna I'm sorry but I'm one of those type of individuals uh I love my friends I have many brothers in this message we all have many brothers in this message there only few that we consider friends within that realm that we call Brotherhood so we have friends this is one of my friends uh a friend that I love that I respect a hero of the faith and that's what we need to remember is that we have Heroes Warriors that have fought fight still fighting and that's what I love about brother Chris long and with that I want brother Chris to come forward use the holy spirit this morning God bless you God bless you oh yes is it my time all right God bless you all it's a it's a grand privilege to be able to be here with you I'm I'm not deserving of the kind words from Brother Ernie but I love him for it anyway we have known each other for at least 45 years we've concluded that much so and unfortunately that gives away some of the time of our age but you know what I'm gonna be like that old fellow brother brandham ran into one time they could just barely get him up to the platform and brother Bram felt sorry for him brother he said what do they doing bring that old man up there but when he got under the inspiration he said there ain't enough room up here for me to preach so uh we we got plenty of room room God bless you all it's a real privilege again and of course we have I see many families from the church up in Cottonwood God bless you all the effort appreciate you coming uh that's that's my Amen Corner let's stand for the reading of the word we'll just get right into it now I I I gave the message a title uh the attributes of God and I have been preaching on those attributes for 40 years but for the last year uh taking this this approach that we're going to uh bring to you this morning I believe it's important especially in the hour that we live in that you know who you are we know that recently in the past few years uh many many people have fallen away from what we call the message well in my humble opinion they never were there yet or they would not have left uh it was an intellectual conception it was something that was in the mind and never reached the heart because once it reaches your heart there's no turning back it's only forward holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty those those cherubims ain't got nothing on us because we're continuing forward the only problem we run into God is eternal we're creatures of time but we're finding out something the message of the hour declares to us that we never had a beginning and we'll never have an end now when you look in the mirror you look like maybe you're coming close to the end but that's just the beginning for us amen so let's turn to Isaiah 55 if you would I might as well just start preaching Isaiah 55 I got to find it myself forgive me for not having it marked we'll just read verses uh 8 and N for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayeth the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth yeah so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts amen let's pray father oh how we love you Lord we appreciate friends and family father but more than that Lord people that are closer than a brother father we are your attributes we are actually closer Lord than than we really know because of where we came from father and in the hour we live in we must know who we are and the only way we can know who we are Lord you instructed us it's where we came from that matters and then that'll determine where we're going Lord we love you and we thank you appreciate brother Ernie Lord the congregation here and those who traveled from afar help us now father each one to come under the anointing and the inspiration lord of the holy spirit in Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen God bless you you may be seated now I have been preaching and preaching and preaching on this and I'm very comfortable with it because I believe it's where we came from with all my heart I believe we came from God and we are going to go back to God this is the journey we're on now I love the Journey of Abraham because I believe Abraham was our our type and and the shadow of the things uh of the past that help us with today Abraham was just an ordinary man you know we would we would look at uh uh somebody in the Bible and we would think oh my goodness they made made it into the Bible they made it into God's holy word they must be a fantastic person Abraham was so fantastic that he was just like you and I he was just a common person he didn't come he didn't come from what we would call a good background a matter of fact the the prophet of God taught us that they packed idols on their backs so they were Idol worshippers now I think it's time for us to get the idols off our backs it's time for us to put away the things that so easily beset us because we are living in the hour where it is the end of the end there was the beginning of the end but now it's the end of the end the signs of the times tell us we realize that Israel is God's time piece for the earth look where Israel's at fighting for their lives fighting for their Nation fighting for their cause fighting for their identity that's what you and I are here doing this morning fighting for our identity we're constantly having to tell the devil no I'm not that this is what I am no I'm not that this is what I am this is what I stand for this is where I came from this is who I am and I'm going to heaven I love the way Isaiah that God told Isaiah my thoughts they're not your thoughts my ways they're not your ways you see my thoughts God speaking now my thoughts they're higher oh sounds like a Rapture to me because I don't want to hang around down here any longer than we have to it's like John on the pmos revelations chapters 1 through3 John is wandering around the aisle of Patmos he's there for the word of God God visits him with an angel and begins to tell John the things which were and the things which are but it took a little bit higher elevation for John to be able to see which was going to be Hereafter you with me Revelations 4:1 come up here John come up a little higher God's thoughts are higher than our thoughts so the answer is simple let's find the thoughts of God now there's a requirement if you'll turn in your Bibles to Philippians there's a requirement to be able to attain and channel the thoughts of God because God's thoughts are one thing and the mind is is another it's by definition I guess I need those little tabs like you got there brother are you ready Philippians 2 pH everybody knows these scriptures now but I'm gonna preach on them verse five let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus all right if we understood what's going on here we'll understand that Christ Jesus has a particular kind of a mind now the Mind by definition is a spirit or Force used to direct guide or give directions to one's thoughts so in order to have access to the thoughts of God you must have the right kind of mind that's why Paul wrote this to the Philippians this mind be in you so it can Channel Direct or guide God's thoughts he said it's not my will but thy will be done now Jesus had his own mind but it was the mind of Christ Jesus that ultimately becomes important you see and you and I have two separate thinking capacities now for the sake of location I'm going to point to my head we have a a mind they call it brains they say but it's not really located in the gray matter it's located in your spirit but because we are a Triune being we have more than one thinking capacity because as a man thinketh in his heart so is he so now the battle begins we have the greatest battle ever fought and in English brother Ernie I say the greatest battle ever thought sense we're in a battle I don't think you came here this morning for a picnic this is a battle am just get on the winning side and your troubles are over oh no they just started you see because before it didn't matter now it shouldn't matter you see we have a battle going on between the heart and the head is that right now we know that the prophet of God told us that in the message the greatest battle ever fought there's got to be a Battleground is that right and this is a battle between God and Satan is that right now if it's God versus Satan we know that God's going to win where do we fit in we believe in God Jesus said believe also in me all right because God sent him what is an apostle one sent sent by God you say well an apostle is just a word a title a definition yeah but the Bible is clear you want to know if it's an apostle or not try those try those the Bible says put them on trial or try them out to see if they work I don't know if that makes sense in Spanish sense to me I realize that the language is not ex you know we have puns do you have puns see so it's very difficult have to be done correctly in order for you to get it and I'm interested in you getting it this morning so I want to take my time but I'll fit it all in I expect you to go digging around to see if it's the truth or not but in Philippians let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus I believe I have that mind brother let's see what this mind does let's see how it acts the next verse it says who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God so the first thing we notice about this mind is that it does not have a problem being equal with God it doesn't necessarily have to be behind God it certainly is not in front of God that's Lucifer's problem he doesn't want to be equal with God he wants to be God but this mind understands something there's no way that you can rise any higher I'm quote the message now than your pastor so it really helps to have one with the mind of Christ because if he doesn't think that it's robbery to be coequal with God he can take you there too that's what the message is to me the message is not a way for us to argue that's what people use it for though we got something much greater we have something bigger than an atomic bomb that's faith it wasn't an atomic bomb that brought everything into existence it was Faith because everything we see came into existence by faith God even instituted faith in such a way where he had to obey it himself the prophet of God tells us that when he said let there be light God himself who said it had to believe what he said you say well where does God fit in all this you realize that we're a tri being made in the image after the likeness of God therefore we're not the first Tri and being we're made in the image of a triun being now we know that Triune being as father Son and Holy Ghost is that right now it's very simple it's not three Gods it's one God three offices how do I know that by faith I know it by experience I am a father I am a son and I am me so I am a triing being no notice something about what brother Bram titled the offices of God every parent is going to know what I'm talking about once you become a parent a father or a mother you have certain responsibilities you have and you also have your way of thinking when you have children they inherit some of that thinking oh he's just like Daddy yeah until Daddy has to set him down say that's not the way we do it son that's not the way it's done around here but always he's just like his daddy not exactly doesn't think the same way so what his father Endeavors to do is to instill is in him the correct way to think that's what God is doing to you and I through his word he's constantly reminding us that's why brother Ernie I have no problem preaching this every day of the week because he's constantly reminding this is how you do it this is how you do this is how you do this is how you do and after a while we better do it that way but you see somehow we inherited a stubborn Str I want to do it my way well we need to transform that mind you understand it has to be transformed and the way it starts is let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thoughted not robbery to be equal with god wow you would think that would be at the bottom not but you have to have some motivation you got to be motivated in order to want the mind of Christ to be in you so God's not like us he is the top he's the top so if we were in him before the foundation of the world brother Ernie we started at the top but God wanted to express himself he wanted to be able to express his attributes see now I'm under inspiration so I have just because I'm I'm I'm odd but I'm not trying to be odd listen to this adoption no coincidence part one in this publication paragraph 105 when was our names put in the Lamb's Book of Life when the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world when before the foundation of the world it's the same question God asked job now I realize in your scripture it doesn't say it exactly like the prophet said it but the prophet read the paragraphs above where were you Jo that's the same question being asked us this morning where were you Jo where did you come from when the sons of God sh Joy why were the sons of God shouting for joy because they were in the mind of God before there was anything and God was going to manifest himself so he started out with a sacrifice he started out with himself sacrificing himself that got the sons of God doing a little shouting out told dancing bit little shout going on here and of course because we're his attributes we had some idea of why he was doing it when you do something wrong and your daddy says go to your room you know what's coming you know it's coming now when I come down here to minister for brother Ernie Brother Carlos always has a little gift for me that's the opposite of going to your room that's like wow I'm going to shout and dance a little bit see that's what the sons of God and Daughters of God were doing they were happy they were excited because they knew knew that God was going to use them in his plan how do I know that I was there well yeah but we don't know if you were there well let's see if you were there because if you were there you'd have seen me there and if I was there I'd have seen you there you remember the little story huh about the the the man telling the the little girl come on that story about Jonah come on no whale can swallow a [Music] person he said well I I believe that that it happened you you know the story the girl said she would ask when she got to Heaven huh see she'd been there and the man said well well what if he's not there then you ask him only two places there only two ways right and wrong amen Amen Let me let me let me go here when God was Jehovah El Elohim elim the self-existent one see that's true Oneness with he was self-existent but he was self-existent with his attributes with his thoughts you might still ask yourself where do we come in give me a few minutes just like one great big diamond and he could not be nothing else but inside of this diamond his attributes was a savior in this attributes on the inside of him was a Healer well there was nothing to save nothing to save yet nothing to heal but his attributes produced it I want you to notice that I'll read it to you that we are the thoughts of God that he had before the foundation of the world and that God's thoughts are his attributes so his attributes produced it his thoughts produced it well how in the world did we find that out let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus he knew where he came from he knew who his daddy was he knew what his position was so Father Son and Holy Ghost so so simple that's right I'm a father when I'm addressing my son Carlos can you be my son for I'm addressing my son so usually the son comes for advice have ask brother but when I'm addressing my son I'm in the office of a father and and and and and my and my way and my and my and my thinking and and and the pattern and my even my personality and characteristic have to take on the office of a father so you speak to your son in a c way you are the leader you are the commander you are the chief and you're looked up to and you're expected to have the answers you're expected to give the right kind of advice thank you brother when you're addressing your children but watch the same person could be you or me when you're mother or father show up you have to turn and you have to submit you have to subject same God I'm the I was the leader a minute ago but my daddy came in the room hey Dad Pap what's up you know Dad don't just show up usually you know it ain't Thanksgiving or Christmas what's Dad doing here huh why why why why does my dad want to see in his office did you get that brother in his office so when you become the office of a son or a child for Ladi yes sir but when you turn and you're a parent you are looking for yes ma'am yes sir that's right but it ain't over comes down to us you see that's the type of the Holy Ghost the office of us did you get that does that make sense you know you can say me but but I tend to like us I'll tell you what cuz God did not say in Genesis 1 let me make man he did not say that he said let us make man in our image after our right that's what the message of the hour is it is fulfilling God's command to himself but he was including his attributes let us man in our image how is this possible how do we know brother well verse seven begins give us the prescription but made himself let us make man but made himself of no reputation where did we go wrong brother don't you know how important I am see that that well I'm so and so and it even gets down to well I'm a believer I'm better than they are that is not the reputation that this mind calls for no reputation now he had one as long as he was breaking the fish and the loaves as long as there was a healing line and people were getting healed but not everybody liked it the Sadducees and the Pharisees the other so-called Believers didn't like it because the way they were thinking the wrong mind was look at him he's trying to make a reputation for but he was of no reputation Jesus Christ was God the almighty God the creator of heavens and earth in a man and he didn't want no reputation how dare they say that he's trying to make himself of a reputation I want you to catch this because I'm just reading to you out the scriptures you want to entertain do you want to be able to guide and direct direct the thoughts of God this mind has to be in you I want you to understand something that if you and I and I'm gonna say it even better than that because you and I were in him that's Ephesians 1 ver in him before the foundation of the world then we are his attributes I'll read it to you we are his attributes we are his thoughts then what's wrong with they have to have the right mind to channel through to direct to God we can be one of God's thoughts and not have the mind of Christ and it's all misdirected thoughts think about it Lucifer lucif had to have got his start in the mind of God but there's a different difference between the mind and the thoughts there sure is let me ask you something where do thoughts come from I recently asked a brother that very intelligent brother very intellectual Minister not from Arizona from way back and he said well that's obvious brother it starts with our our brains I disagree brother I disagree that's a mind that channels thoughts have you ever heard the prophet of God say that when science wants to reach its highest level take him a blade of grass lay that blade of grass on their desk and say I want one of those and science will say we have it everywhere every football field has that every baseball diamond has some people's yards have we make it out of plastic that plastic has no life in it see the interest is where's the life you take you're take my my favorite uh object to use for my congregation is an avocado seed first of all that proves I had avoc I love avoc but it's also a large seed so I can set it up on the pulpit and you can look at it and it's obvious to anybody who eats avoc that's an avoc recognize that and so what will that avocado seed do if it's put in the right condition see if it's ch through the correct conditions placed in the right kind of ground and tended to properly avocados come oh it don't come right away it takes years it takes years to get another avocado seed yet it started with that seed you had in your hand oh that's why the spoken word is the Original Seed and God's not a creature of time like you he planted that seed in the thoughts of his attributes and we're here this morning Years Years in the making but I'll tell you something that was the seed of God what will it produce the fruit of God what will the fruit of God produce this is where Pentecost missed it the only place I can think of they missed it the fruits of God will produce the seed of God and the seed of God is his spoken word amen amen that's how come we're here this morning because God had one seed ready that seed was William Mariam BR William Bram and he used him to begin to bring the other seeds to maturity that's why he came during Pentecost because it was the fruit bearing stage of the journey that's not the most important stage it's the seed again it's the seed again listen to what brother brandham says somebody asks him a question on predestination and of course he refers to John 1:1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word became a person and the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us that was the first seed to come to fruition to come to the stage of the journey where it could be used to reproduce itself again is that right nearly 2,000 years after Paul another seed sprung forth the spoken word seed now I realized everybody would say well that was the prophet the word seed is not just singular it can remain that way until more seed comes forth and since the spoken word is the original seene it makes perfect sense that God would have to send another seed to speak to the seeds that were waiting for those words you see that's why he thought it not robbery to be God none of us are going to assume the position literally of Jesus Christ but if you understand him we were in him we were in him before the foundation of the world he was the lamb that was slain in the mind of God there wasn't a literal Lamb slain it it was the Lamb of God in the mind of God and as attributes we were in him Ephesians 1:4 therefore we were part of that sacrifice and we are being used today to express our part our part that was in the mind of God before foundation wait a minute now we're not done yet I'm watching that clock I got a little bit more time no reputation it wasn't robbery to consider oneself to be equal with God if God is the word then you must be the word in order to be equal with the word that's what we're becoming we bypassed that part of God that was in his thoughts we call it a theop Jesus did not bypass his theophany he knew but God has made a way for you and I to find out who we are Jesus knew I came from God he said I go back to God remember that Pillar of Fire that we have a photograph of over the head of William bradam William is the pillar of fire the same Pillar of Fire that entered the cave it's the same Pillar of Fire that was in The Burning Bush was the same Pillar of Fire that was Jesus Christ right that appeared to Paul on the road to Damascus that same Pillar of Fire is the thoughts am that's why it's higher we want his thoughts we want his ways well there's two more things that this mind portrays you still with me brothers and sisters I'm preaching this for you because I believe this and I'm here to declare unto you brother Ernie I may not be there yet but I'm there see I want you to get this I want everybody in here to get this well brother you're just saying that in your mind that's what God did before the foundation of every seed brings forth after it's com it must be believed in the mind and drop down into the heart well wait a minute what's the difference between God and Jesus brother BR said that there was a time when he thought God was gonna punish him and Jesus was going to rescue then he said I found out that they're the very same person he said Jesus he found out was the very Heart Of God because God's a tring being God has a thinking capacity up here and one down here how do I know Moses it Grieves me that I even made man get get get out of the way Moses wi right that was the mind of God that was the mind of God that was the thoughts of God being challenged in the mind of God oh but the heart of God stood he's not a dual personality different office and the Heart of God hold it right there take me if you're going to take them that was the lamb slain before in the mind of God God knew Moses was going to inter just like he knew the lamb was going to inter and I'll tell you something brothers and sisters it's time for intercession brother Bram told us that as his attributes you have a child you have a loved one you have a mom and dad you have friends and family if you want them they are yours now you say brotherr you're just saying that from up here when it drops down it's over they're there brother Bram said even if it's on their death they're yours I believe that that's really the hour we live in not about me it's not about you it's about those who don't have what we have let me finish I got see I'm watching that clock brother Ernie asked to save a little time for a little I'll give you five minutes brother you said it but made him uh himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant oh here's another factor in letting this mind oh in the world we live in today and the hour we live in everybody wants to be served not this mind this mind is a servant this mind submits itself to service let me tell you how simple it is you say what don't you have to be somebody well who do you think you are I'm saying that cuz catch this you think you are who you say right you have to say it because that's the Original Seed it's got to be said it's got to be and then what happens is a challenge comes am I gonna be what I say I am or am I going to live like a hypocrite and have two faces I really love being served but I'm going to act like a servant so that I appear to have the mind of Christ yeah but I'm talking about the heart see I'm not talking about the head let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jes is the mind of the heart because when Jesus got to the Garden of the man Jesus the mind up here the brains of the out said hey if it's possible let this cup oh but the heart of God you know the one that was slain Foundation said not my will but thine be done that's a servant that's a true servant there's a battle going on who to serve what to serve how to serve Just Surrender and let this mind be in you oh we're not done I got three more minutes because see I say that to myself brother I'm reminding myself because my congregation has found out that I can go an hour and a half without that's not my intention I want you to take watch now watch I want you to take the other half hour well it'll be pretty quiet and when he opened the seventh seal Silence about the space of half an hour what was going on the thoughts of God well well there would be a lot of noise you're thinking I don't hear you but I know see that's what's going on that's the reason there was silence in heaven for about the space of half an hour because God's thoughts found a channel down here on Earth and and the the Thunders uttered from the earth and a thunder is the voice of God not understood because the prophet of God told us like in St John 12 everybody said oh it was a messenger the Angels were talking but brother BR said and the Bible says Jesus heard God he knew it was God and it wasn't a thunder it was a voice brother Bram says that the real true church at the end will understand watch how he says it those seven voices what do those voices represent I'm one of those guys that doesn't make it you don't look like a thought of God to me because those seven spirits that the rainbow projects seven phases and ways of God that going to accomplish something and complete it that's where we're at you notice the rainbow there's a right side edge and a left side edge PA William brandom William Bram Pablo Pablo and William brand William Bram and notice everybody in between just fades in and out of one another there's no exact Fades into the other into the seventh one brother me brother Ernie that angel me he said because brother brandom understood this is it this will be the end of the line this will be the group of people who represent we not I not me we are alive please stand God bless you praise God he said his attributes produced Ministry min oh good then I'll start out with the other statement you never know I know but I'm getting old God bless you all appreciate you take your seats for a moment you know our womb needs to start thinking it can come down to where it should be here I love that message that was when I was sitting there started remembering what brother Brenham said there's only two faculties that govern a human say that over again there are two faculties that govern a human one is Faith that's right let me say it again one is Faith it brings results and the other is fear which has no value in it at all is of god fear is of the devil fear makes you worry it makes you wonder and if it's going to die in the morning what good would it do me what good would it do us how many of you fear death I cannot fear [Music] death death is coming and I got to approach it and understand but he said this morning I gotta pull that's right because I'm Eternal we are Eternal what I need to get what belongs to me that's right you said something important that I love you have to have love first say it again you have to have love First Love produces Faith love produces Faith perfect Faith that's what we need it's perfect faith I was recalling brother Hickerson brother Brenham told Brother Hickerson you were there I'm gonna say brother you were there I'm going to say brother we were there now I want you to look at your your neighbor and I want you to say we were there we were there we are important from enough theme he has made us into something and because we're special we are his attributes and his attribute I got to produce it it's going to come I don't need nothing it just flows out like a [Applause] lamb it just comes out that's what we are I want you to look at your neighbor and say brother I love you brother I love you love it's love that's why when he was speaking he said God had to believe what he said where was the light there was no light there was no material to make the life God it was a thousand years if it was a million years believe what he said and that's us we got to believe what we need it may not come today may not come tomorrow it's coming now exactly just like that seed see you know I believe with all my heart got phone calls during the week I'm in the hospital every morning I like to look at you to see who's here and who's not here and I don't see the person here but this person is in the hospital diabetic too much sugar high blood pressure a lot of stress in their life she was hospitalized I've shared with people what their food should be like brother Brenham said it when you're young food is life when you get to a certain age food is Death and All of a all of a sudden you get to be my age and you want to drink a Coca-Cola you're bringing death you want to eat a hamburger a banana split Banana Split banit you say banana split uh you know it's a couple scoops of ice cream banana on top when you're young yes see you get older it's a no no yes no other words I'm going to tell you please don't get upset at me your tamales I love tamales you got to be careful at a certain age what how to eat when to eat so I had another person call me what it brings all this food that we intake consume it so much you're not only I have a doctor in the house here he'll tell you what happens when you're diabetic when you're under stress look at your ankles first sign second sign you want to cut your foot off before you know it your eyeball the nerve is pinched it throws out blood to the front before you know it you can't see before you know it they're telling you you're becoming blind what I like what you said giving the right advice we got to change our habits we got to change our ways I'm gonna and have the mind of Christ I'm GNA have certain people come up if you're a a couple and you need the mind of Christ to come up but before that brother Chris I want the three of you down here Danny get my pole you see there's a door the most hideous thing there is today is found in Revelations right up here I stand at the door and knock and we don't let him in we close them out well this morning I want the mind of Christ I need the mind of Christ I'm just G to pass by everything has to be Vindicated by God but we pass by God help me and God will help you God knows what you have needed because what he said this morning God is God he knows our thinking he knows what we are he knows what we need when I go to Africa the first thing they tell me I don't need anything I want more of him and that's all we want more of him so if you're a couple and you want to come up let it come from here not from here from here if you're sick and your diabetic be at the end be at the end of the line guarantee all it is is a change of diet in 30 days that spirit will leave you but as the brother said you got to believe and I can guarantee you it will leave you can't go back to the old ways he said move forward so if you want to get in line please do so [Music] you see I have three individuals here's the fourth you want your son you want your daughter I want you to look in to space it's called the black hole I always said it from this church put your hand through that Dimension make contact and bring the future back here stick that hand in

Brenham sang when the saints were marching in in Africa they're so organized that they'll March out and Mar in but there's always a serpent in our thoughts sometimes in our heart and that's why
