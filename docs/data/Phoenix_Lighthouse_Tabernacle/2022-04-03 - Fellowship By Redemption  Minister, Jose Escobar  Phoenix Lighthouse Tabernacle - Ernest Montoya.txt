house of the lord [Music] [Music] at home right now we have i would say really nice weather [Music] in the park or doing something else wednesday decided to be here [Music] the scripture we've been using which is hebrews 911 and for putting the trust in me for letting me be back here [Music] i would say that i'm not supposed to be back here but i think all things happen for a reason if there's any coincidences and whoever was supposed to be here they'll get their of good things to come by greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building is neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us cabrillo for if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctified to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spots of god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god well we thank you once again for allowing us to be here lord we are truly blessed to have a to have a place where we can come and congregate that you anoint the ears of the people listening maybe you may be with me and my interpreter it may not be my words lord what are your words so once again we're happy to be here this morning and so we're going to continue on the subject that we've been focusing on which is and we've heard the scripture many times now and i've been enjoying hearing uh different people talk about this subject our pastor with the whole planet redemption is taking a different aspect of redemption and also been enjoying our youth when they come up and they talk about what redemption means in their life i really enjoy watching the youth when they come up here because some of them are younger than me some are older than me but regardless i always learn something from when they come in here and talk about redemption in their life so i've thoroughly been enjoying listening to this topic of redemption so each time we have somebody and they talk about redemption but we've heard different definitions of what redemption means and i i've gone to understand someone understanding what redemption is one of the messages i had been listening to uh when thinking about this thoughts that's what i had been thinking about in my mind i had been thinking about fellowship and how that ties in with redemption and companies but we lost our relationship with god before before and this you would you would sacrifice an animal and that would be your replacement because through this death of its blood paul here in hebrews telling us who was our redeemer how that by one offering he made and perfected forever those that enter in by him is and so we're looking at what the word redemption means i came upon what what the hebrew root word is it's a legal term it's concerning the substitution required for a personal or animal being delivered yes and the verb has to do with the deliverance of some personality when our body becomes in tune with god becoming a part of him to vindicate the presence of the lord jesus christ in all of his power and omnipotence he has risen from the dead he wants to fellowship he lives amongst us today and he wants to fellowship back with his people again his great majesty his glory is now spreading forth and he is desiring to fellowship again with his people like he did in the garden of eden i considered to be somewhat uh introverted which means i'm not really you know i don't go i'm not a loud person i'm not very outgoing [Music] espanol but i was thinking about how these i was reflecting on these past two years i was always at home i was working from home i was also doing school from home even i started feeling a little isolated at first i was like well i don't know how everybody else misses people i'm good about myself here in my room is i did start missing that interaction just simple interactions with people i even started missing i started missing coming to church seeing my brother sister christ see seeing my brothers and sisters in christ or just being here in person i had that desire because now people say i'm quiet but when i was little all people wanted me to do it because i talked a lot in school my teachers told me i talked too much they used to challenge me and my cousin tell us can you please sit down for 15 minutes that's the first challenge just sitting down the second challenge can you be quiet just for 15 minutes and now people want me to talk about this i went from talking a little too much and now people actually want to hear me talk but that's my experience with with uh talking with fellowship with having relations so they say talk to this person talk to this employer you have to get your connections out i expanded and they tell you to talk to different companies different uh managers people owners of different businesses and it's difficult for me because i just want to just want to mind my own business be in the corner and just be by myself but i know that if i want to progress i have to go and make those connections so for me i say that for me something i look back on it it's been tough for me to to have that fellowship whether it be with people from church am i taking advantage of that sacrifice would he restore that fellowship that connection so i can personally now have a connection with him but it's amazing that god desires to fellowship with us but so then comes the question what is stopping us from having fellowship with god or maybe what's stopping us from having fellowship with our brothers or our families uh is it is it my attitude is it the way i talk es do maybe i don't get along with somebody but brother benham answers that question he says he says what's stopping us from having fellowship with god he says [Music] [Music] so i think about how we when we gather with our brothers and sisters in christ we share that same interest we believe the same message we read the same scriptures we all share that same interest and people have different versions of fellowships i know in school they have what they call graduate fellowships [Music] different programs where they gather together and they help each other whether it be different parts of school differences in escuela whether it be a certain degree or a certain job you're trying to get to they they help you out but those are different things people look at as fellowships but the question is what is the elective fellowship with god and brother gives us an example in this message he refers back a lot to adam and eve he talks about the relationship they had with god they had a perfect relationship with god before sin came ante so brother gives an example now in the beginning when god made man to worship him and live god taking care of him fed him god came down in the evening and talked to adam and eve diwali no sickness could ever come to them they didn't even know what sickness was they didn't know what old age was nos they didn't know what being hurt says they couldn't be heard they were in the presence of the omnipotent powers of god which held them in control and guided them by his spirit there and i think to myself is that a desire i should aim for yes to have that perfect fellowship with god i can be in his presence i like how how he talks and how the situation was it's something that he puts emphasis on algo que i had been having it earlier this earlier last month actually and it all started i got a notification on my phone notification and it was under fake a notification from uh google photos notification photos of google and if you're not aware what that is it's a it's a storage system it's a cloud storage system that where you can save your photos upload them to google so i got a notification from them notification and i clicked on it and it said it two years ago on this day and so it was early march and so i said it was it was in march of 2020 yes so i opened up the photos i only had a handful i wish i took more questions but i looked and it was it was pictures of when uh the youth when we went to our trip to jeffersonville we actually got to go inside the branham tabernacle that's that's somewhere where i had to take a picture i'm not one for pictures but i had to take one there and we also went to the ohio river ohio and that's where one of our brothers who's not here right now okay that's where he got engaged in that's where he proposed and then we also went to the confectionery or the candy store we also went to different museums we even got to attend a service and it was all a great time it was a really good trip a really good a really good time of fellowship not only with god but with one another and the reason i say that is because even though i had all those great memories there okay this [Music] yeah so when we were there we had two vans venice one was for the sisters and one was the brothers and i was sitting all the way in the back i'm one of the taller ones so i needed a place where i had a little more leg space i was in the corner establish and some other brothers were there back back there with me and i remember this i remember this vividly i can't exactly remember which day it was i want to say maybe it was sunday night it was dark out yesterday i think we were probably making our way back to the hotel and i remember we were all just we were all just talking because i want to skim through and just read what it's all about i've heard a lot about about a certain message and then another brother would come in and he would tell us oh yeah about this message and he would ask questions and we would do the best to answer them no we couldn't we'd ask each other we refer to the to the books and but that's something that's really stuck with me just being sitting there in the back of the trash in the van just having a conversation with my brothers my brothers in christ talking about what we believe in trying to answer questions and i i feel that i got to experience fellowship with others and know what it's like so i started thinking is that maybe i caught a glimpse no it was early march of 2020 little did we know in a couple weeks things were going to get pretty rough but we weren't worried about that tomorrow [Music] that we're able to have here it is how do you get into this fellowship he says how do you get it how do you get it brother brandon how do you ever get into this fellowship and he responds [Music] in which we don't know what sickness is okay we're not worried about old age we're not worried about being hurt we just have that perfect fellowship with our with god so it's good that we we have that that good communication with that good relation with one another because how i treat my brother reflects what i believe reflects if i'm really somebody who loves god then i'll love the people he uses i know he is my brother here yes he uses our pastor he uses all brothers here whether it's preaching to reflect that that godly love each one of them because that's where god is at we have our personal relationship with god but we also have a relationship with him through others and that's what i really wanted to speak on this morning i know it's a bit short but i just wanted to get that thought out of this redemption and fellowship by redemption [Music] that helps them in their christian walk that's that's more than enough sufficient whether it be somebody here lord maybe somebody watching online or like i always say maybe somebody who will watch this in a couple days or in a week maybe they'll click on this video and they'll listen through and they'll be able to get something something to help them lord [Music] [Music] help [Music] amen amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] see this [Music] [Music] oh god [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] me [Music] know [Music] this is [Music] oh [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] my [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] life is easy [Music] peace like you never know [Music] when you're [Music] are down [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] when we're upon [Music] [Applause] but it's [Music] [Music] when [Music] when things go wrong is [Music] is when things go wrong [Applause] [Music] [Music] now
