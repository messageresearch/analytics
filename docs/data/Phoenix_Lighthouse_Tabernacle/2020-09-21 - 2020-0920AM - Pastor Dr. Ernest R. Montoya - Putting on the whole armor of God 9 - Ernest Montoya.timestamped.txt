[26:13] long conversation with brother gomez

[26:54] there's times where he has
[26:57] times he doesn't have to say and what
[27:00] i'm talking about is

[28:25] have this that or the other
[28:43] by phoenix lighthouse
[28:46] to give to brother bernie and sister
[28:49] lily
[28:51] what they do with it is
[29:10] and i know because we i'm dealing with a
[29:14] large population of hispanics
[29:20] and the hispanic families
[29:24] as the father mother of either side
[29:30] they grow older and behested then you
[29:32] take them into your home
[29:35] you help them you protect us
[29:52] hablando here's our father
[29:57] our father that raised us
[30:01] he raised me
[30:04] before i was born again
[30:14] and that's the greatest thing we could
[30:15] do
[30:20] something
[30:31] [Music]
[30:34] second week of each month
[30:45] that's all she had in her pocket
[31:02] is
[31:09] and i want to i want to start off
[31:13] with our first quote
[31:19] we're going to read our first quote this
[31:21] is the ninth
[31:23] message on putting the arm of god
[31:28] god's strategies verse satan's
[31:31] strategies
[31:35] and brother branham said in the greatest
[31:37] battle ever fought
[31:59] his strategy is what
[32:03] disbelieve god's word
[32:06] he's going to do everything in his power
[32:09] get
[32:10] us to disbelieve the word of god
[32:14] [Music]
[32:19] now if you're mad enough
[32:23] you've ever disbelieved
[32:36] i saw people i saw people
[32:39] coming after me
[33:08] i'm
[33:22] atmosphere
[33:35] when i get away from the word of god
[34:00] so how many of us have gotten away from
[34:02] them
[34:04] we've all have
[34:16] that's the greatest tool that we have
[34:46] he
[34:56] can you see the greatest battle ever
[35:00] fought
[35:11] and what is satan's weapon against you
[35:14] equals
[35:28] is
[36:09] well i didn't have time to read my bible
[36:24] and i saw your
[36:50] i've been on my father's business
[37:20] they take up my space so i know what i'm
[37:24] thinking what they're saying
[37:30] have you been around people you can tell
[37:33] what you're thinking
[37:41] but this is what the greatest weapon or
[37:44] the weapon used against you by satan
[37:48] is
[38:02] i want you to show
[38:04] [Music]
[38:30] is
[38:57] so he hits us in different angles
[39:02] let's listen real quiet now
[39:06] listen
[39:11] if he can get you to disbelieve your
[39:13] weapon is equivalent
[39:19] if he can get you to believe that your
[39:21] weapon is not
[39:22] strong enough
[39:26] incredible
[39:40] is
[39:54] is
[40:07] so why do we believe
[40:21] for his word to be completed in your
[40:24] life
[40:25] but it has to be completed
[40:31] his promises how many of you have ever
[40:34] asked him for something
[41:18] we need to
[41:20] [Applause]
[41:32] i become
[41:57] let's stand and
[42:01] we're going to read our scripture
[42:04] then we're going to pray
[42:08] i promise not to take too much time
[42:13] put on the armor of god that ye may be
[42:16] able to stand against the wiles of the
[42:19] devil ephesians 6 11.
[42:28] diablo for we wrestle not against
[42:33] flesh and blood but against
[42:34] principalities against powers against
[42:37] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[42:40] against spiritual wickedness in high
[42:42] places
[42:56] wherefore taken to unto you the whole
[42:59] armor of god that ye may be able to
[43:01] withstand
[43:02] in the evil day in the evil day and
[43:04] having done all to stand
[43:10] today
[43:19] a blessing for those individuals that
[43:21] are either in
[43:22] silver city
[43:37] reveal your word this morning for our
[43:40] hearts
[43:42] help us pray in the name of the lord
[43:46] amen amen if i go back to
[43:50] uh 12 you can take your seeds
[43:54] uh for we wrestle not against flesh and
[43:56] blood but against principalities
[43:58] against powers against the rulers of
[44:01] darkness of this world
[44:02] and this is where i want to put a little
[44:04] emphasis
[44:19] brother
[44:48] um
[45:14] my business is to preach the word
[45:29] and he said america is not the america
[45:32] of yesterday
[45:37] he told us what was going to happen
[45:42] i mean we've known it for how many years
[45:45] 50 years
[45:47] it shouldn't be a shock to us when all
[45:50] of a sudden we read the paper
[45:55] and we see this individual persona his
[45:58] name is
[45:59] trump see i'm a trump
[46:02] i'm glad it's not ernie trump
[46:07] trump but it's donald trump is donald
[46:10] trump
[46:11] worth about eight million dollars more
[46:39] and then our ex-governor was there
[46:42] everybody
[46:43] rudy because of what he was saying
[46:47] and what he's saying
[46:50] is he wants a new law for immigration
[46:54] he
[47:08] that the hispanics
[47:18] they sell drugs
[47:28] i don't know about you
[47:32] but i know what the prophet said
[47:35] in reference to hispanics those are the
[47:38] most
[47:39] humblest people i've ever met
[47:44] what are you gonna believe that's a
[47:47] rapist
[47:50] drug addicts or the most humblest people
[47:55] i've ever seen
[47:58] i don't include myself let me clear your
[48:00] mimi's my ear
[48:02] with just anyone solo identify
[48:18] he's rich
[48:36] [Music]
[48:46] why
[48:59] the queen of the south is not south
[49:11] for the united states to be destroyed
[49:28] i don't care what people believe i
[49:31] believe what the prophet taught us
[49:40] so when i hear stuff like
[49:44] this
[49:47] shouldn't bother you he said it was
[49:50] coming
[49:53] 50 some years ago
[49:58] we read it and we take it personally
[50:02] how many of you are mexicans
[50:10] i'm not
[50:52] so when they talk about me you know that
[50:56] song they can talk about me
[51:00] anyway they please you can talk about me
[51:06] and
[51:20] we shouldn't what we do
[51:25] so just go back to that song
[51:30] high places somebody had to fit
[51:39] somebody had to come together
[51:42] and play this paper
[51:46] thank god it wasn't you
[52:06] now if you don't raise your hand i'm
[52:08] going to give you a real fast one that
[52:09] your parents lied to you
[52:11] know that's why
[52:15] there is
[52:27] ain't gonna bring you anything santa
[52:29] claus won't bring anything no santa
[52:39] you've never heard that if you're not
[52:41] good santa claus is not going to bring
[52:43] you anything for christmas
[52:58] so how many of you got presents from
[52:59] santa claus
[53:05] none of you got presents from santa
[53:07] claus
[53:08] santa claus so then your parents really
[53:10] lied to you
[53:18] they're trying to make you happy feliz
[53:22] brother branham hey man brandon just so
[53:25] you know para question had a christmas
[53:39] because they didn't have sufficient
[53:40] money
[53:44] and giving his kids
[53:47] that opportunity you said never take it
[53:51] away from them
[53:55] so if we're taking it away i have a
[53:58] christmas tree in my house every day
[54:03] 1975 to maybe 1980 i didn't
[54:08] know
[54:22] merry
[54:35] said merry christmas
[54:49] it was never uttered in malachi 4 5.
[54:55] because everybody believed that we
[54:58] should
[54:58] no either about christmas
[55:03] that he wasn't born on christmas
[55:17] and not take it away from our kids
[55:21] giving them a present telling them the
[55:23] truth
[55:25] everybody celebrates christmas
[55:29] we don't believe in santa claus
[55:32] i gave you the present
[55:36] and this is what christmas is all about
[55:40] isn't that so simple
[55:44] how many of us believe in strategies
[56:13] parents you know
[56:42] inadequate
[56:50] so what are we missing
[57:10] god cannot
[57:21] you know that's why i like that young
[57:23] kid i don't know where he's at
[57:37] a very strong
[58:06] some people
[58:19] you don't have to say a
[58:35] just the way you act the way you talk
[58:40] the way you live god will
[58:43] show someone what you are
[58:46] god will vindicate
[58:53] that's what brother branham taught us so
[58:56] we should
[58:57] be insufficient
[59:02] of all
[59:16] we're so insufficient
[59:30] that's what we need that's what i want
[59:32] look yo
[59:33] that's what we all want to be
[59:37] insufficient
[59:41] you know i don't know if you can see
[59:43] this
[1:00:03] you can see that they he has a cut on
[1:00:06] his side
[1:00:08] still fighting on
[1:00:11] you having
[1:01:10] in spanish but when i was growing up
[1:01:15] and we were going to beat up a person
[1:01:21] young lady a young
[1:01:51] principle locker but you would tell that
[1:01:53] person
[1:01:54] the whole world would know you know
[1:01:57] somebody like that i mean they know
[1:02:00] everything
[1:02:02] my mother once was told by the
[1:02:21] my mother told me she scratched her head
[1:02:23] and she knew she was just playing with
[1:02:24] the lady
[1:02:26] said wow i didn't know that
[1:02:30] so she would have told everybody
[1:02:45] how do you know he landed
[1:03:00] is
[1:03:15] if you really look at the spacecraft
[1:03:19] is there air wind i i hide it oh yeah
[1:03:23] in the moon then why is that flag doing
[1:03:28] this
[1:03:41] i can have something in my hand
[1:03:59] the last one was getting a spoon full of
[1:04:03] uh i don't know it was they said
[1:04:06] chili some chili the hot chili stuff
[1:04:09] trying to be real custom
[1:04:22] if you can eat this if you can't you
[1:04:24] give me can i go
[1:04:25] are you going to be right you go first
[1:04:29] no you go first
[1:04:31] so i'm very sneaky i'm sorry my old age
[1:04:36] no deception
[1:05:10] and about that time
[1:05:15] that was my 50 pesos i was teasing him i
[1:05:18] didn't want his guest
[1:05:20] hot chili
[1:05:48] family
[1:06:09] how many people followed him or i should
[1:06:12] say his disciples
[1:06:13] do you think all his disciples are in
[1:06:15] heaven
[1:06:29] they went from paradise they went up
[1:06:33] or they went yeah that's not the problem
[1:06:36] my problem is
[1:06:38] they all denied him though they all left
[1:06:42] they all betrayed him
[1:06:49] [Music]
[1:06:58] don't worry about it turn the other
[1:07:01] cheek
[1:07:03] don't take it personally because the
[1:07:06] person that does it
[1:07:09] is inspired by a demon
[1:07:23] amen amen
[1:07:27] satan's strategies 101.
[1:07:30] you don't know the strategies
[1:07:33] i talked about i hope i talked about it
[1:07:36] six
[1:07:36] uh two weeks ago four weeks ago
[1:08:06] so you know what the strategy is again
[1:08:12] the art of planning and directing
[1:08:14] overall military operations
[1:08:16] and movements in the war or battle the
[1:08:19] planet
[1:08:22] military
[1:08:36] and if you
[1:08:41] [Music]
[1:08:49] because my adversary your adversary
[1:08:53] our adversary
[1:08:57] the devil diablo my adversary
[1:09:00] your adversary walks
[1:09:04] like
[1:09:46] and he will
[1:09:59] cleanse your hands
[1:10:28] this
[1:10:33] least satan should get an advantage of
[1:10:36] us
[1:10:38] for we are not ignorant of his devices
[1:11:11] not knowing thank you gracias not
[1:11:14] knowing about it
[1:11:16] about what how many of you can fly a jet
[1:11:21] we're ignorant someone
[1:11:26] how many of us speak french francis
[1:11:30] maybe one two we're ignorance
[1:11:33] ignorantess
[1:11:34] american well we're ignorant
[1:12:18] amen we should be more ahead than what
[1:12:22] we are today
[1:12:49] you okay the reason okay
[1:12:54] this is what brother branham said
[1:12:58] perfect strength oh god strategy
[1:13:15] is to take empty human vessels
[1:13:21] and shape the world with them
[1:13:26] it's the same one person or is it saying
[1:13:30] plural
[1:13:43] now just a little bit and we'll go oh i
[1:13:46] don't know
[1:13:49] what did he do he'd taken them 10 days
[1:13:53] to get all emptied up
[1:13:58] in other words
[1:14:38] i gotta empty myself out
[1:14:54] or you did this
[1:15:22] but we have all the light
[1:15:25] that which is perfect
[1:15:29] that which is perfect
[1:15:33] 100 pure word of god
[1:15:48] and he actually interpreted
[1:16:17] and that's what we have yeah
[1:16:32] i heard brother bernie sanders
[1:16:39] pure unadulterated word of god
[1:17:00] got
[1:17:13] that's why i can't stop
[1:17:29] how many of you believe that
[1:17:32] gotta believe in something
[1:17:36] but they were all standing there with
[1:17:39] their
[1:17:39] vessels turned up perots
[1:18:35] how many times
[1:19:19] we can talk about those mysteries
[1:19:23] when it comes time you're not going to
[1:19:26] be filled
[1:19:28] we're going to be empty vessels if we're
[1:19:30] not
[1:19:32] we're always going to wonder why did
[1:19:33] montoya go why did this
[1:19:48] too much knowledge not enough oil
[1:19:53] what do i want this morning i need that
[1:19:55] oil
[1:19:58] that's what need of today that's what we
[1:20:01] need today
[1:20:16] we need
[1:20:30] gossip
[1:20:53] listen brother
