Revelations 3 21. we're going to be continuing with the topic of how can I overcome and as you find the scripture I just like to take some time to thank our pastor um for the confidence he puts in without let me be here once again we can indicate it with an amen once you have it foreign to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am sat down with my father in his throne is so once again it's to him that overcome it no will grant to stay with me in my Throne you know here brother Bannon tells us he's letting us know that there is a reward for the Overcomers sorry it's on my Throne not in my throne and so since we're still so we're on the topic of how can I overcome no we always go through what it means to overcome um and last time we spoke on how Jesus how he is the perfect example of an overcomer told us that overcome means it means to stand the test he says just like Jesus did foreign he says he's just as real as you or anybody this is a real devil and you must recognize him real estate he says You must know he's a devil says but at the same time that you recognize him and you know that he's a devil and he's against you then to overcome you must recognize that the god in you okay is greater and my dear is he says that he says that one that's in your that the one that's in you has already overcome him and he says and by his grace he says you're more than a match for him yes and so right there I find that interesting he says he doesn't say you're a match for him you're more than a man somebody is a match for you that means you're on the same level but he's saying that you're more than imagination so you're more than him and that's why we can overcome you know in finishing off that quote no he gives us a key here he says that's real overcoming when you recognize so from reading that quote we are the latest you know I I learned that there's things I have to recognize so I have to recognize that there's a real devil real I have to recognize that he's against me he's against you he's against us but nothing I have to do I have to also have to recognize myself you have to recognize you know what who you are and where you stand and then that leads me to recognize me or The God in you is greater and mightier than he is so we have to recognize that's the word of Promise he says and it says the next one would be it says What's the Word of Promise to every Christian and he says it says greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world he said mayor is how do I overcome he says not me he said but the word that's in me so we can place ourselves there you know it's not me it's not you all right it's not us but it's the word that's in us and he says the word is God he says then I overcome once again then we overcome he says not the things of the uh he says we overcome the things of the world it's the word in me and then he says he says if ye abide in me and me just my words in you miss palabrasotros he says then just ask what you will just keep pressing up says you're coming to the top he says as sure as anything says you've got to come to the top and so then here once again we go back to how can I overcome so how did Jesus overcome no he showed us how he said an example for us you know he overcame by the word and by humility and so here I have a quote 103. it says we're talking about humility I was trying to find something that talks more about you know the humbleness of our Lord Jesus Christ and so I found in the message uh called humble myself in it reads like the following yes brother Brandon says look at Jesus nothing but one bundle of love Jesus he says he was God manifested expressed himself through him and he says no wonder Miracles and things happened he says his humble life and consecrated life he said to come from being God we need the serdios to be a man on Earth he says to express God through himself I like what brother Brennan says here that's what made him what he was he says I've always said just what made Jesus God to me was the way he humbled himself he says he was so great yeah he could make yeah he could be so small see that's right so then I understand you know in order for me to be humble yes it's good to recognize where you come from and maybe you're somebody who's great but at the same time we make ourselves smaller because we're being humble because we're the son of a king but God doesn't like us going around boasting so we have to be humble and if we want to overcome so you know and he says Jesus gave us the example how to do it Jesus he says now we want to know how to overcome Jesus told us how to do it Jesus said humility girded himself to a towel and watched the disciples feet and wiped them um so he uses the word girded you know and that means you know to equip or to prepare is and he says he took him tell and he watched disciples fee and wiped them he says the very God Of Heaven humiliated himself and then here he's talking about people he's met along his life brother Branham he said he says I've had the privilege of getting meeting some great and it's these guys that got a change of clothes and 50 cents in their pocket to Rattle yes individuals he said that's the guy that thinks he's something when he's nothing he says but I stood by Great Men He says I mean great men with ragged sleeves he says he says they make you think you're the great Persona and so here it teaches me once again how can I be humble you know it's you make somebody else feel like they're the great one person by yourself you make the other person feel like they're the great one person gives us another key yeah he says greatness is humility so if I want to be great [Music] he says greatness is expressed in humility he says now how fine you can be so it's not how fine I can be it's the greatest expressed in humility and so when he says what you might say okay well then maybe I then why do I dress so nice or why do I put so much effort into looking nice to be humble this is doesn't mean you have to dress ragged or to be dirty or not be close but what it means is having been humble in spirit so it's it's not you know the way you look but it's the humbleness in your spirit and how did Jesus Express humility you know he was willing to die you know he forfeited all the world and all the things and Jesus was Jesus conquered all Temptations and then you ask you know why why was he tempted you know and in this this morning you know our brother did he did a great job and he told us you know why we're tried no we have to build that character you know he said we want to buy gold but we receive it through those trials so why was Jesus was tempted what was he tempted it was to mold his character and then brother Benham says you know the Temptation was for him IL that would be 104 and he says you know that the Bible says that he was tempted in all points like you and I are and that's we you know oh that's it says tempted in all points it doesn't say in some points he says he was tempted in all points but yet without sin pero so he was tempted in everything you know you might sit there and think well I struggle with this problem another problem maybe I don't think Jesus was tempted by this stuff I'm tempted by it says he was tempted by drinking was tempted by women he says he was tempted by everything that could be tempted by it so anything you think about he was you know 140. no brother Brown tells us you know he come and suffered and he took the hard rugged route he took the route of persecution and he took the route of death no and then asks a question you know I can ask it to you this evening are we this morning and I can say are we this evening he says willing to do just take that same route that he taken is are we willing to die and then here's another key are we willing to give ourselves up to God forfeit all the world and other things to serve him see when and when I read that that's what I think it means to be humble is I think that's humility yes um for example my brother here you know he could do whatever he wants those were free moral agents but yet what does he choose to do he serves God and that's humility yes um but the question is why did he endure it all he got through it all and but why did he endure it and here brother is talking about when you know the devil was tempting Jesus you know he offered them the kingdoms of the world and here 141 brother Brandon says he says now he failed to do it we to Forfeit Satan was to him he says though Jesus was tempted and even here's the real beauty of it he says he overcome for us he says he endured all temptation for me and for you he says he could have took it right then he says but what did he take the other route for pero and he says and if he paid such a price then how little would it be not to take it Don says he says one remember there's nothing here anyhow request and so when I read that and I say that's that's genuine love is being able to endure such harsh conditions no not thinking of yourself thinking of someone else you know that's love ESO you know and I think of the love of a parent you know how they're willing to suffer so free they're willing to uh you know overcome not for themselves because they're thinking of their children or maybe somebody out there who's thinking of their loved ones uh you know you do it for them because that's what love is and that's what we gotta do yeah sometimes we have to put ourselves last question that's first it's God then it's your family and then next it's you and here you know I have a quote I'm going to extract okay you know when he says you have to remember you're living for God he says that we have one objective and he says and that's Jesus Christ and he says outside of that there's nothing yeah he says nothing else counts he said that's him just then secondly says it's for your family he says then thirdly it's yourself but first for God next for your family and next for you he says you're number three foreign I think maybe of us who have been raised you know by our parents you know we were corrected we must corregidos you know I know I was corrected in more ways than one and muchas you know I know we have Mother's Day coming up no we have Mother's Day coming up so I'll just get this out the way now no but growing up you know I was corrected you know and when you're little you know you think it's your parents just being mean to you or maybe they don't like you that's why they're correcting you okay but you realize when you grow up you realize it's because they love you that they correct you and that's why God we need correcting because God loves us that a real mother and you know we we receive all these trials but we have to overcome them but like they mentioned this morning you know we should be happy in the trials I've always liked when they mentioned that when they say why is the devil after you it's because he doesn't have you so while you have trials because you know in your battle but if you're not having anything in your life and that should be a cause for concern you know that's what they say about when you have little kids or little you know babies you know they say you know when you have kids he says it's normal to to have a noise and have a lot of noise but when you have kids and all of a sudden it gets quiet then that's when you should go check that's when you should be worried I don't know go check the laundry room or something make sure they're not drinking something they shouldn't be drinking yeah but that's what happens if it's quiet you should be concerned but when there's that noise going on you have you can you know you're in the right spot and then closing off with this you know brother Brandon says he says that we have to strive with all that's in us he says to stay in the Life of Christ Jesus he said so that you should be fruit bearing is how Jesus taught us just by taking the word the promise in humility and um and here brother Brandon was you know he was closing off the service with a prayer he says Lord Jesus he says Jesus he says hour and 15 minutes now standing here he says trying to take your word and explain to the people how to overcome he says you told us how it's done you didn't only tell us but you showed us how it was done he says you let us you showed us how to do it receive the word inside of us and be sure to hold on to that word in every temptation but be humble through your power which has already conquered our enemies and he says the only thing we have to do is walk humble with faith is also taught us the importance of an identification is believing that our badge is of identification identification of the Holy Ghost and Satan has to move so once again as long as we're walking humble with faith with our Badge of identification rostro dear heavenly father Celestial Lord thank you for being with us once
