TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] hmm [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] so so [Music] [Music] me down [Music] my [Music] um [Music] now [Music] so [Music] mommy [Music] um [Music] hello [Music] oh [Music] hey [Music] hmm [Music] hello so [Music] you [Music] [Applause] [Music] my [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] we're so grateful for that great love that you have shared about in our heart also your grace did you permit us to gather here to have fellowship around your word [Music] permit that every living being that's in this place that you might help us and fill us and give us that what we need avitamos we're living in a dying world and it's a system that's about to be finished off your kingdom has come to us your will be done on earth as it is in heaven they're in glamour it cries out at the thirst for you it asks for you are you celestial heavenly father help us this morning mythology number 161 the day of redemption [Music] nations are breaking nations are breaking [Music] israel's awakening the signs that's the prophet foreign [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] let's open up to the book of romans the people will go [Music] on the subject of your conscience and the day of judgment for relay [Music] for as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law for not the hearers of allah or just before god but the doers of allah shall be justified for when the gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law these having not the law are allah unto themselves which show the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another in the day when god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according to my gospel god bless his word before saying [Music] in english [Music] [Music] of redemption is [Music] your life [Music] your redemption is near amen before beginning we want to welcome all those that visit us i know the and being that you have come to a sanctuary that says that you're wanting to be helped it's a privilege for you to come to be with us we're speaking about your conscience and the day of judgment i'd like to review something a small item this morning i want to speak about just concerning consciousness [Music] permits me the next time i speak i want to bring on the other side of the conscience as we have started speaking about consciousness we have said that man is a triune being we've drawn a circle the outside part which is the body lego la parte [Music] and when we're referring to consciousness we're not referring to the outside consciousness because we're conscious of the outside through the five senses is [Music] remember that the spirit is tied to the soul everything that will be saying in this subject [Music] and so it can be well established and the people can know the reason why we're here so the innermost part is the soul [Music] project to you just a positive [Music] we believe that [Music] this kind of shocks people when they hear it for the first time when you talk about predestination but if we go back to the simplicity of the gospel the reason why god made himself flesh that's why emmanuel got with us was manifest in the savior which we know him as the lord jesus christ his sole purpose was to seek that and find that which had been lost even the word redeemed significa everything handed over to the devil there was our salvation each one of us fell right there but thanks there was something in him already but my petition that i have to god is that he might be able to relax and we might be able to understand that we're eternal if he was to say it like this extraterrestrial we're extraterrestrials doesn't matter neither nothing or no a few scriptures now and so we can talk about conscience [Music] i want to talk on just one side of the corner say amen open your bibles please if as this message is going forth if a question comes to your mind why don't you jot it down and if we finish the series we might first timothy 1 5 0 is now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart and of a good conscience and of faith [Music] kindness commandment is charity out of a pure heart talks about a pure heart and of a good conscience so then the spirit linked to the soul the third part is with faith we must have a good conscience [Music] is we're gonna be reading there in uh chapter three verse nine 9. timothy chapter 1 verse 19. there is saying holding and that's grabbing hold up holding faith and a good conscience we're going to see something here this morning so we must holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience mysterious see there is a mystery the mystery is of faith when a person gets to the awareness and knowledge of what faith is what this mystery is he finds that in him there's a certain authority [Music] what god has done for us apostle saint paul and thank god whom i serve from my forefathers with pure conscience that without ceasing i have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day pablo established he spoke about the resurrection from the dead 2416. he wanted to attain to be a partaker of the resurrection from the dead in other words he understood that there was a special group i was going to raise from the dead and then do i exercise myself to have always a conscience void of offense toward god and toward men in other words a clean conscience or the deacon just cover it up with that that's the enemy you must always keep a clean conscience and right inside of us is that conscious i do exercise myself to have always a conscience void of offense this proves to me that a man can have a clean conscience but he can that way we can always have a conscious voice of offense toward god and toward men so you must have a consciousness not guilty standing before god amen is so we can bring it to light the next time but this morning what i'd like to do i'd like to read it hebrews chapter 10 verse 22 let us draw near with a true heart and full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from all from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with clear water he completely convinced for sure having a heart sprinkled from an evil conscience and our body is washed with protection that's an inexhaustible culture where you can't and when they accept it they feel like something went off for them they feel clean they actually have been cleaned they go outside one goes out clean one does not go out one accepted if how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god small items he offered himself just recently we received the book i think we did there's a portion there that i've been quoting it for 17 years now we're just a garbage can [Music] [Music] perfect is jesus christ is i'd like to show you one side of the conscience now 25 cents a quarter from here in the united states but i have spoken this morning it's just the introduction to speak about consciousness i believe that this bible that's here cannot be understood except at except through the message that has been given to us by god's mouth which is his prophet amino i don't [Music] uh if i teach it's got one eye in it you [Music]
