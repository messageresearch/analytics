do [Music] [Music] every step [Music] m [Music] [Applause] [Music] first i greet each and every one of you in the precious name of our lord jesus christ we welcome each one especially those that visit us we're happy to have brother jamie with us again would you stand so they will know you and your wife both of you yeah they're working in san diego [Applause] it's a pleasure to have brother jim with us there's [Music] and we thank the lord that we've had the opportunity [Music] he was my brother-in-law [Music] he went to rest to be with the lord all the visitors let [Music] our purpose is to be fed by your word fellowship around your word that's only right correct fellowship and that's around your word that we might grasp that what you have for us in your holy word in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen you would open up your scriptures with me the letter to the romans bought from paul number this is the 29th message we have on the message subject the letter to the romans i'll start reading from verse 12 through verse 16 he for as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law for not the hearers of the law are just before god but the doers of the law shall be justified for when the gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law these having not the law are allah unto themselves which show the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another in the day when god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according to my gospel them [Music] all along on the road allah [Music] every step that you take this great eye is awake there's an eye watching you watching you watching you every day mine of course you pursue watching yourself watching you there's an awesome watching [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] to the romans and being that this is the 29th take take number 29 on this series that's last sunday we took the eighth message on the manifestation of the sons of god and this morning i'd like to start on a short thought on the series this is going to be my first message is your perhaps if i read it from the greek verse 15 says like this is who demonstrate the work of the law written on their hearts yellow their conscience co-attesting and the reasonings between each other accusing or defending and the in a day when according to my glad tidings god will judge the hidden things of men through christ jesus so the word a test attesting is to give a witness test testify that's why i noticed to draw something i won't be able to refer to the circle this morning because i won't be able to get that far this morning okay that is brother is going to be drawing up three circles another uh uh even though i have the outside body young even though i have a spirit there must be something in the very most inner part of my being for us to line up the three in one but i noticed something yes that the spirit has conscience in order not to confuse us [Music] uh i'd like to re-emphasize what i spoke on last time is that body in itself what was the life we were going to live while we were on the earth because the apostles he explains and tells us like this that is his attributes of savior healer and so forth he permitted sin to enter into the world and being that way we bypass our eternal home name was when we were born our name was written so that we would know what kind of life we were going to live but then there was an end to that then our name surfaces we come to prove to we must grow baby does not i'm following how many of you love god about six hours the book of revelation chapter 50. and the subject is your conscience and the judgment day judgment we understand that the the rights of jesus christ will be there but not being judged rather being standing at the side of the case the hot carriers are the farmers the janitors the welders governors kings presidents presidents are all there [Music] another and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works is son against [Music] page 970 and the books were opened the books of the sinners and another book was opened which was the book of life 18. is for i testify unto every man that hears the words of the prophecy of this book if any man shall add unto these things god shall add unto him the plagues are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy that takes away god shall take away his part out of the book of life because he says this locker it feels dislocated you take away and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire so there's there is a danger for your name to be taken out of the book of life is two first corinthians moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful but with me it is a very small thing that i should be judged of you or a man's judgment yea i judge not my own self i judge not myself i don't even know myself with the hot iron they take like a rod get it really really burning hot and they're serious do away with that for i know nothing god until the lord come who will who both will bring to light the hidden things of the dark side will make manifest the councils of the hearts and that then shall every man have praise of god amen there's something there that goes off into something else and i'll just leave it there have a time next time 524 fiesta [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you
