[35:21] god bless you this morning
[35:24] uh take your seeds for a
[35:28] moment it is a great sunday morning
[35:34] if you were here last night you received
[35:36] a blessing
[35:39] the young people put on a
[35:42] tremendous service last night
[35:46] the speakers were awesome
[35:49] uh and what i did um prior to them even
[35:53] speaking something was placed in my mind
[36:06] uh trying to get a mystery here and a
[36:08] mystery there
[36:25] the two young men spoke last night
[36:30] we need to remember one thing
[36:33] that he preached
[36:35] god in simplicity
[36:38] it has
[36:48] [Music]
[37:31] so that the word of
[37:34] god you can't have faith without some
[37:38] type of stimulation
[37:41] it will cause a revelation that we need
[37:44] for this time period
[38:01] because the master
[38:29] so that whatever our needs are
[38:34] obtain those needs
[38:37] through a sacrifice
[38:40] through the blood that was shed
[38:44] covers us
[39:26] is
[39:38] let me put emphasis on that
[39:48] that's what makes us special this
[39:50] morning
[39:52] that's what separates us
[40:05] now what i'd like you to do okay kiddo
[40:07] kevin
[40:13] i want you to stand we're gonna pray
[40:17] some questions i think there's simple
[40:18] questions
[40:20] biblical questions
[40:33] this morning we're so happy
[40:36] content
[40:45] knowing that this is such
[40:48] a tremendous day
[40:52] [Music]
[41:01] father raise us up this morning
[41:06] so that we can serve you better father
[41:10] that's my prayer
[41:12] that you helped us this morning
[41:15] place the confidence
[41:18] in the mind of
[41:32] to dwell in our thinking
[41:35] for we pray this morning
[41:37] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[41:46] if i was to give this a title he has
[41:48] risen
[41:51] he has risen
[41:54] how many of you believe that
[41:56] raise your hand if you believe
[42:07] how many of us
[42:11] have risen
[42:13] resources
[42:21] you know
[42:22] we have been taught
[42:24] that once we go into the waters
[42:27] for our justification
[42:39] that it's not easy to baptize a person
[42:42] these
[42:49] you can do everything you want
[42:52] but when you take them down
[42:55] what is he doing
[43:09] so you needed to just relax
[43:12] and as he
[43:14] submerged you in the water
[43:17] you were still kicking
[43:19] people kick
[43:21] they don't want to die
[43:24] when you
[43:36] you have potentially potential which you
[43:39] should be look at once you come up
[43:42] because we have to resurrect
[43:45] thank you
[43:47] it's important it's important if you
[43:49] kick
[43:50] and that leg that arm yes
[44:06] and re-baptized
[44:09] because he he
[44:11] just didn't want to die
[44:14] how many of you want to die
[44:18] oh wow that's different
[44:22] let me say it again how many of us want
[44:24] to die
[44:25] let me say it correctly
[44:29] how many of us want to die
[44:32] spiritually
[44:34] i mean i gotta forfeit
[44:37] whatever is bothering me
[44:41] i heard brother branham say
[44:47] you don't want the holy ghost
[44:51] you don't want the holy ghost
[44:53] you're afraid of it
[44:55] you say it again you don't want the holy
[44:58] ghost
[45:01] you're afraid it's going to change
[45:04] that's going to transfer
[45:06] when will it happen
[45:08] it's between you
[45:10] and your savior
[45:11] between you
[45:13] and your lord
[45:14] it's between and you
[45:21] i need you to remember that word
[45:26] my first question is
[45:40] help me
[45:43] how many of us have lost the joy of our
[45:46] salvation
[45:48] have you lost something
[45:49] the pandemic is taking everything
[45:53] including
[45:56] wanting to come to church
[46:24] so the pandemic
[46:26] has taken it
[46:40] and this was part of the commercial of
[46:42] the tv
[46:44] well he was a newscaster
[46:53] so
[46:54] he has his jacket on somebody says
[46:56] something else
[46:58] he stands up el salvanta
[47:01] i won't tell you no away
[47:04] what he was wearing
[47:07] that's us
[47:09] because of youtube we stay in our
[47:11] pajamas

[47:23] we gotta have our coffee
[47:25] and then maybe later yeah
[47:28] we can enter that webinar
[47:31] that's the joy that we're
[47:37] let losing say that over here
[47:39] we're losing our joy
[47:42] because we're not
[47:49] at night
[47:59] to see exactly where it goes
[48:04] and the reason i need to make a decision
[48:10] i look into your eyes
[48:12] and the first thing that tells me
[48:15] you don't feel his presence anymore
[48:18] i see people
[48:32] that was delivered
[48:35] is no longer there
[48:41] i was in kabul
[48:45] and i noticed the same thing
[48:52] and i noticed something lacking
[48:57] it's that desire that we once had to
[48:59] serve jesus christ
[49:05] how many of you
[49:07] don't raise your hand
[49:09] raise your heart
[49:11] not only have lost your joy
[49:24] think about it
[49:25] something so simple alcotnio

[49:53] to forfeit all our rights to inherit
[49:55] eternal life

[54:49] uno
[54:58] in the end of the sabbath
[55:18] 28-2
[55:23] excuse me five single
[55:27] and the angel answered and said unto the
[55:29] women
[55:31] fear not ye
[55:33] for i know that he seek jesus which was
[55:36] crucified
[55:46] he is not here

[55:56] the lord lay
[55:57] no esta
[55:59] porque
[56:00] como digo
[56:08] verse 7 which is where i want to stay
[56:13] and go quickly
[56:15] and tell his disciples that he is risen
[56:18] from the dead
[56:20] and behold he goeth before you unto
[56:23] galilee
[56:24] there shall you see him
[56:27] lo i have told you
[56:42] so we have an angel
[56:46] well i disagree with many people
[56:49] please forgive me
[56:51] there's two angels
[56:53] an angel given to the jewish people
[56:56] israel
[57:06] was given to the jewish people for
[57:10] gabriel foreign
[57:36] gabriel spoke to me gabriel may have
[57:38] lost
[57:53] no but they gave him a different name
[57:56] what was his name
[57:59] thank you lucifer lucifer the bible
[58:01] mentions
[58:02] michael
[58:04] lucifer
[58:06] revelations we
[58:19] but
[58:20] michael
[58:33] i believe
[58:46] it has been created
[59:02] that means the flesh
[59:04] will have an end
[59:06] fiend
[59:09] but what is of god
[59:11] the spirit
[59:13] that dwells in us
[59:15] jesus from the dead
[59:45] so whatever is created has a what
[59:49] has a
[59:52] beginning
[59:55] does heaven
[59:57] have an end time
[1:00:11] pass away
[1:00:26] not talking about a dimension
[1:00:29] i am not talking about a dimension
[1:00:34] i'm talking about heaven
[1:00:36] heaven is the car's most
[1:00:52] that's god's word
[1:01:06] like i said
[1:01:09] here the angel tells them
[1:01:12] and it tells them
[1:01:14] go tell
[1:01:16] the disciples
[1:01:18] that jesus
[1:01:21] galileia
[1:01:25] well
[1:01:29] you know if you're from the united
[1:01:31] states
[1:01:33] what's today sunday queso domingo
[1:01:36] what's the special occasion
[1:01:41] we know 40 you're a man
[1:01:46] but after 40.
[1:01:48] there's something wrong with our
[1:01:50] chemistry
[1:02:18] and he marked it didn't look at anything
[1:02:22] i looked at him i said sir
[1:02:25] can you tell me where i parked my car
[1:02:32] he stared he was
[1:02:34] bewildered
[1:02:38] he looks at me it's my camera
[1:02:42] looked at my wife
[1:02:45] like thinking this guy there's something
[1:02:48] wrong with him
[1:02:50] he said sir
[1:02:52] here's the doors you know how you exit
[1:02:54] costco
[1:02:58] it's out there
[1:03:00] yeah
[1:03:15] so i had to do something in order for
[1:03:17] him to get off of what he was thinking
[1:03:21] maybe something happened at home
[1:03:24] maybe that was his last day
[1:03:27] maybe it was the last day because he was
[1:03:29] fired
[1:03:34] so i had to throw some humor
[1:03:37] so he could get away from that
[1:03:39] atmosphere that he created
[1:03:48] i think we all create an atmosphere
[1:03:52] it can be love what they said they can
[1:03:54] be hate
[1:03:55] they can be
[1:03:57] it tortured be drugs
[1:03:59] it could be alcohol it could be women it
[1:04:02] could be whatever it is
[1:04:05] but it's attracting
[1:04:08] it's doing something to your mind
[1:04:21] that sometimes i wake up
[1:04:24] i tell my
[1:04:28] [Music]
[1:04:38] so then i tell myself
[1:04:41] i go into the mirror
[1:04:43] i do this i watch them well you know
[1:04:45] these this used to be really firm
[1:04:47] stanley and freemasons but they're not
[1:04:49] sagging have you ever gone up there
[1:04:52] you look at

[1:05:42] if i want to do this
[1:05:44] i'll do that if i don't want to get up
[1:05:46] i'm not going to want
[1:05:53] it's not that you're getting old

[1:11:26] stand up right there
[1:11:36] i have believed
[1:11:38] i've heard
[1:11:53] i've heard
[1:11:54] not all of them i'm sorry to say
[1:11:58] i don't
[1:12:00] i really haven't heard a lot of brother
[1:12:03] bernie's tapes
[1:12:06] only what we
[1:12:20] there
[1:12:35] in other words
[1:12:38] if the same spirit that was in jesus
[1:12:41] christ is in us today this morning
[1:12:44] is it in this person
[1:12:47] is it in this person
[1:13:02] do
[1:13:16] let me say it again
[1:13:19] what has been preached
[1:13:25] can you say amen
[1:13:30] so we're here this morning
[1:13:34] four five six
[1:13:36] seven eight
[1:13:38] nine ten yes
[1:13:40] to stimulate
[1:13:42] your faith
[1:13:44] so that we can resurrect
[1:13:49] so that we can be what we should be
[1:13:54] say it again so that we can be
[1:13:56] we should be
[1:13:58] sir
[1:14:10] but i ain't what i used
[1:14:42] they can slap you how many have you been
[1:14:43] slapped by a message believer
[1:14:50] i don't mean spiritually i mean
[1:14:52] physically you know
[1:14:54] physically
[1:15:07] and he did this to me
[1:15:10] for me and then the brother
[1:15:13] get closer i'm biting you i won't push
[1:15:15] you
[1:15:18] the brother does this
[1:15:21] he does this
[1:15:32] so when somebody says something bad
[1:15:34] about you
[1:15:36] no
[1:15:42] but
[1:15:43] when the devil speaks to a person
[1:15:46] is he telling the truth
[1:15:50] is he telling you the truth
[1:15:54] okay
[1:15:54] i believe he's telling me the truth
[1:15:57] i'm a snake in the grass
[1:15:59] i'm everything he said
[1:16:01] 99.9 percent
[1:16:11] the devil isn't going to say something
[1:16:13] that you haven't done
[1:16:15] i mean he's taking a tabulation he's
[1:16:18] doing everything that you've done he's
[1:16:20] marking it down to accuse you day and
[1:16:22] night
[1:16:24] so he's writing everything down
[1:16:27] so when he comes to you and he says
[1:16:31] i'm not lying no
[1:16:32] don't you
[1:16:34] [Music]
[1:16:47] he's telling the truth
[1:16:49] but it's that point
[1:16:51] nine or 0.1
[1:16:56] because jesus forgave me
[1:17:27] those
[1:17:28] brothers they opened their church to
[1:17:31] this morning
[1:17:33] and i wanted to say
[1:17:35] it was like what we did
