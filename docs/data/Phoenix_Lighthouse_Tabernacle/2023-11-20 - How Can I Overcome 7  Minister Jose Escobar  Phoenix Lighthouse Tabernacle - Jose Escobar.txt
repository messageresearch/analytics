[Music] fore [Music] God bless you all it's a pleasure be in the house of the Lord I think it's always good to be in the house of the Lord how many are thankful for this nice weather we've been getting lately it's a quite beautiful night we have would be so kind of please open up your scriptures we'll be going to the Bas scripture we've been using which can be found in Revelations 320 to [Music] 22 and before we go into our scripture I just want to take some time to thank our pastor uh for the opportunity he gives me to be here in front of you you know we all go through tests and I'm going through one right now you know am I going to be obedient and so here I am so it's a small victory for me but it's also a victory for each one of you who are here tonight so do we have the scripture and the scripture reads behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will sub with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and him sat down with me in my father in his throne he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches you so kindly please by our heads dear heavenly father L we thank you for this opportunity you give us Lord we thank you for letting us have a place where we can congregate and we thank you for another day of life now I ask that you be with me as your word comes forth I pull myself to the side maybe you speaking to your people be with me be with my interpreter and be with the audience who's listening Lord give everyone the portion that they're looking for Lord so I ask you all this Lord and I thank you in the precious name of Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may take your seats so as you can tell we're continuing in the topic of how can I overcome you know it's something that we repeat and we repeat and we repeat but I believe we're a people that believe that in repetition that's where we'll find our Revelation so it's always good to repeat these things and I'd like to start off by by reading a quote by brother brandham you know every day there's a quote of the day and this one came about I think a couple weeks ago you know and I saved it because when I read it I felt that it was it was perfect for the topic of how can I overcome you know and it's from the message God's covenant with Abraham and his seed preach in 1956 and it says says God doesn't make any difference between his children he says every son that cometh to God must first be tried or chastised says you get it says first be tried or chastened corrected child trained schooled everyone no [Music] exception he says every son then he asked have you went through trials he says have you went through tribulation he says have you suffered persecution he says then you're endure those things he says then you're a real children of God says but when you can't bear chastisement says when the rod comes down heavy and you run off back into the world says the Bible said you're illegitimate children and not the children of God says for when a man is born of the spirit of God he expects those things and he loves those things and the Bible says the trials that come upon us Fury trials is is more precious than gold to us he says think of it what captured my attention from this quote is where he says we we expect those things and we love those things so then it's my understanding that I have to expect to be tried but I also have to love the trials and know that's something very difficult but we should expect that you know and how can I overcome in part three by Brother Bernie you know he giv us an example he talks about students when he says that we're students he says there's students who like to go to school you know maybe like to a certain class but when they hear that there's going to be a test they begin to get nervous and they want to run away from the test and he says you can you can say you're a good student you can say you're learning you say you can fool your other classmates he says but when the test comes that's when you know if you're really learning or not and brother Bernie has told us he says that we are students he says we're studying the most tremendous message has ever been he says we're also in the most tremendous age he says but we have the need of standing the test you know and I can relate to that because when I was in school maybe you know you can you maybe you find a way to get a good grade on a quiz or maybe uh maybe on an assignment but then when it comes down to the actual exam you're you get nervous because you know if you need to pass this before maybe you got by with I don't know using Google or using online to help you with your homework but when it comes to the exam it's just you and the exam that's when you find out if you really know what you're talking about and that's the way that's the way with me as a Christian you know I can say I'm a good Christian I can say that I believe but when the test comes and my faith is tested that's when I'll really find out where I'm standing you know and I like the example brother Bernie gives us he says when we have a test he in other words he says God descends down to earth and he says here's my son my son Antonio maybe my son Moises he says I'm going to allow him to be tested he says to show Satan that he's my son and that he can stand the test so that's when we receive test it's God coming down and saying here's my son and he's allowed to be tested so he can prove that he's my son so we have to overcome you know and we've been taught many times you know repeating it once again overcome means to stand the test you know and I focused on that word stand you you know I found a definition for it and it's to be able to endure or tolerate and the word I like there the word the word I like is endure and endure has very interesting definition one that I found it says to suffer patiently another one I found it's to remain firm under suffering or Misfortune without yielding you know without yielding so you're going through something tough something painful something difficult but you're being patient you're you're yielding you're not giving up it doesn't mean it doesn't mean that it doesn't hurt but you're not giving up so you know lately we've had some rain and I know it's it's been all right you know actually recently you know I was driving on the freeway and I got caught I got caught by the rain and so I turned on my windshield wipers and just a couple minutes went by and uh my windshield wiper just B away and I was on the freeway and I I couldn't really see but I kept going you know sometimes we walk by faith but I had to drive by faith and I say that because when a storm comes it makes things difficult it makes things hard to see and that's what I'm getting at and so when I thought about this I thought about how here in Phoenix Pho or in Arizona you know we have what we call monsoon season you know this is when we get a lot of rain a lot of wind we have lightning we have thunder and once it happens you know there's always a lot of you know effects of it you know you go outside and there's maybe damaged houses you know there's damaged um cars you know the streets are real dirty but something you notice a lot is a lot of broken down trees you know you go outside and everywhere you look there's trees that have fallen over because of the storm but to me what's remarkable is when you can see a tree that maybe it's not the biggest tree but it withstood the storm no the storm came and it's still standing now maybe it lost all of its leaves maybe it broke a couple branches but the tree is still standing you know and that's like like we are you know the storm comes no if we're like trees no maybe we break a branch maybe we break we lose leaves but what's important is that we're still standing you know and you look at the tree and you say why is it still standing it's because it's well rooted and that's the way we have to be as well we have to be well rooted in the word and you know thinking of trees know there's things that they need in order to survive you know they need sunlight they need water they need nutrients you know we also need light we need the light of the Gospel the light of the word we need that water as well but not just any water that living water and we also need our nutrients we need that that food at its due time but something interesting about trees know if you have one and you want it to grow properly then you have to prune it and when you prune a tree uh you remove the dead branches from it or you remove branches that are um stopping it from growing properly so if we're like trees and we want to grow properly we also have to get pruned so we have to lose those dead branches we have to lose those things that are stopping us from growing but the tree doesn't prune itself someone has to come and prune it so someone has to come and prune us and at first it may not look pretty you know a tree sometimes when you prune it and you know the seasons are changing you know it looks all bald it looks very ugly but when spring comes along then it begins to bloom that's the same with us we'll Bloom as well and we bring in those fruits but we need to be like those trees and so overcome means to stand the test and the other thing we know is overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks you know brother bam has told us we have to recognize that there's a real devil that he's as real as you or anybody and you have to recognize them as real you know and brother Bernie tells us he says the matter with people is that they don't recognize the devil and one way I look at it is sometimes we don't want to recognize the devil because we don't want to give him credit we don't want to admit that he's strong brother Bernie tells us that the devil he's powerful that he's a good adversary and he's a tremendous fighter but the way I look at it you know there's Sports you know there's always the two teams that make it to the finals you know there's team a and there's Team B you know you go to the fans of Team a and you tell them what do you think about Team B they're going to say Well they're trash oh they're good for nothing they don't have any good players you say all right okay and so then you go to Team B you what do you think about team hey oh they're good for nothing they're trash they don't know how to play and so you stand back and then you say well they both have to be lying because they're both in the finals so they must they both must be good but they don't want to admit that the other one is good because they feel it makes them look weak but that's us we don't want to admit that the devil is is real we think it makes us weak but we have to recognize him the Devil is a person brother Bernie tells us he's powerful he's a good adversary he's a tremendous fighter and I say he has to be he has to be powerful because just look at who he's going up against he's going against against the Sons and Daughters of God he has to be a good fighter because we're not something to be played with we're not something that's easy to get by we recognize the devil I think he recognizes as well but the difference is is he's a bluffer so he's going to act like he doesn't know that you're powerful but he knows you have power but we have to recognize the devil but something that I found interesting no is brother Bernie says how we sometimes fail to recognize the devil he says when you're sick he says you have to recognize that you're sick and it says maybe the doctor tells you you're sick and he say no no no I'm not sick he says when you do that you're not recognizing the devil you have to recognize that you're sick but at the same time you recognize that God is inside of you you remember that greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world so we have to do all that but here's the thing and this is maybe unfortunate or maybe it's a good thing you know the the devil is our adversary but he's not our biggest enemy you know brother bam tells us the thing you have to overcome is yourself is your ideas and it's your thing what your think that's what you have to overcome and so that leads me to believe to have an A a greater uh my biggest enemy and that's true you know the devil maybe he'll come against me but sometimes he has other people to go to so he's not always with me but my biggest enemy he's always with me you know in the morning when I wake up he's there with me at night when I go to sleep he's there with me as well you know when I look in the mirror you know I see him you know he's about this tall he looks all right but he's my biggest enemy and the thing about him you know is he has problems he has issues he has complexes you know sometimes he feels good sometimes he feels bad you know when he feels bad you know he bullies me you know he says things that bully would say you know he tells me you know you're not good enough he says uh nobody likes you he says you should give up and the thing about him is he's smart you know when I go out those doors and I greet my brothers you know he's quiet you know when I'm out having fellowship with my brothers no he's quiet but the moment I go to my car it's just me and him and we start to talk you know sometimes he tells me good things and sometimes he tells me bad things now sometimes I don't listen to him sometimes I do listen to him and sometimes I agree with him and that's the difficult part because sometimes you'll tell me something bad but and I agree with with him and it's tough but even though he's my biggest enemy you know the Bible tells me that I have to love my enemy so it's difficult for me to Love My Enemy in other words it's difficult for me to love myself but that's where I cry out to God and that's where I tell him help me you know this is really tough just give me the strength so I can keep fighting you know brother bam gives us the key he tells us that we have to surrender we have surrender ourselves to him he says he overcomes for you he knows the way we don't so I don't know the way he knows the way so I have to surrender myself to him if I want to overcome you know maybe we have other people here who also struggle fighting their biggest enemy that's when we have to seek out the scriptures you know when you're feeling sad you know we got to seek out the scripture when you're feeling happy look at the scriptures when you're feeling depressed go to the scriptures when you're feeling anxiety go to the scriptures when you're feeling sad go to the scriptures no and you feel like you need guidance go I like Proverbs 356 you know where we're told so trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not into thine own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy paths so I need to stop lying on my relying on my own understanding acknowledge Him and and the Lord will direct my paths CU once again I don't know how to overcome but he does so I have to surrender my life to him so he can overcome through me and now since we're in this week you know we have a holiday you know it's Thanksgiving so I think it's only right that we Express gratitude no brother brother Bram tells us that for us Thanksgiving should be every day so I'm thankful for many things in my life but I'm thankful for those trials and that's a tough thing to say but I'm thankful for those trials and I'm thankful for our Lord Jesus Christ and like to take these last few moments to thank each one of you for those who are here at at in in in person and to those who are watching online you know I'd

atmosphere is correct for when the preacher comes up and I want to thank our youth you know I I always try to my best to you know help them you know I know it's tough right now especially in this time
