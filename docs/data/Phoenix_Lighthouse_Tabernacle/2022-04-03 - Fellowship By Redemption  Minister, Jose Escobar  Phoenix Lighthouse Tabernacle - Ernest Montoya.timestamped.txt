[31:54] do
[32:05] god bless you all this morning
[32:09] it's truly a pleasure to be here in the
[32:10] house of the lord
[32:13] [Music]
[32:23] [Music]
[32:26] at home
[32:28] right now we have i would say really
[32:30] nice weather
[32:31] [Music]
[32:33] in the park or doing something else
[32:37] wednesday decided to be here
[32:44] [Music]
[32:51] the scripture we've been using which is
[32:52] hebrews 911
[33:04] and for putting the trust in me for
[33:06] letting me be back here
[33:07] [Music]
[33:10] i would say that i'm not supposed to be
[33:11] back here
[33:13] but i think all things happen for a
[33:14] reason
[33:17] if there's any coincidences
[33:19] and whoever was supposed to be here
[33:22] they'll get their
[33:33] of good things to come by greater and
[33:35] more perfect tabernacle not made with
[33:38] hands that is to say not of this
[33:39] building
[33:50] is
[33:54] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[33:56] but by his own blood he entered in once
[33:58] into the holy place having obtained
[34:00] eternal redemption for us
[34:03] cabrillo
[34:13] for if the blood of bulls and goats and
[34:15] the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the
[34:17] unclean sanctified to the purifying of
[34:19] the flesh
[34:27] how much more shall the blood of christ
[34:29] who through the eternal spirit offered
[34:31] himself without spots of god purge your
[34:33] conscience from dead works to serve the
[34:35] living god
[34:52] well we thank you once again for
[34:53] allowing us to be here lord
[34:56] we are truly blessed to have a to have a
[34:58] place where we can come and congregate
[35:16] that you anoint the ears of the people
[35:17] listening
[35:20] maybe you may be with me
[35:22] and my interpreter
[35:24] it may not be my words lord
[35:27] what are your words
[35:41] so once again we're happy to be here
[35:42] this morning
[35:50] and so we're going to continue on the
[35:51] subject that we've been focusing on
[35:56] which
[35:56] is
[35:58] and we've heard the scripture many times
[36:00] now
[36:02] and i've been enjoying hearing uh
[36:04] different people talk about this subject
[36:09] our pastor with the whole planet
[36:10] redemption
[36:14] is taking a different aspect of
[36:16] redemption
[36:20] and also been enjoying our youth when
[36:22] they come up and they talk about what
[36:23] redemption means in their life
[36:28] i really enjoy watching the youth when
[36:29] they come up here because some of them
[36:30] are younger than me
[36:34] some are older than me
[36:36] but regardless i always learn something
[36:37] from when they come in here and talk
[36:38] about redemption in their life
[36:44] so i've thoroughly been enjoying
[36:45] listening to this topic of redemption
[36:51] so each time we have somebody and they
[36:53] talk about redemption
[36:56] but we've heard different definitions of
[36:58] what redemption means
[37:03] and i i've gone to understand
[37:05] someone understanding what redemption is
[37:17] one of the messages i had been listening
[37:18] to uh when thinking about this thoughts
[37:28] that's what i had been thinking about in
[37:29] my mind i had been thinking about
[37:30] fellowship and how that ties in with
[37:32] redemption
[37:34] and companies
[37:46] but we lost our relationship with god
[38:01] before
[38:03] before and this you would you would
[38:05] sacrifice an animal
[38:07] and that would be your replacement
[38:11] because through this death
[38:15] of its blood
[38:30] paul here in hebrews telling us who was
[38:33] our redeemer how that by one offering he
[38:35] made and perfected forever those that
[38:37] enter in by him
[38:44] is
[38:48] and so we're looking at what the word
[38:50] redemption means
[38:54] i came upon what what the hebrew root
[38:56] word is
[39:10] it's a legal term it's concerning the
[39:12] substitution required for a personal or
[39:14] animal being delivered yes
[39:21] and the verb
[39:23] has to do with the deliverance of some
[39:25] personality
[40:58] when our body becomes in tune with god
[41:00] becoming a part of him
[41:18] to vindicate the presence of the lord
[41:19] jesus christ in all of his power and
[41:21] omnipotence
[41:26] he has risen from the dead
[41:32] he wants to fellowship he lives amongst
[41:34] us today
[41:37] and he wants to fellowship back with his
[41:39] people again
[41:43] his great majesty
[41:46] his glory is now spreading forth
[41:50] and he is desiring
[41:54] to fellowship again with his people
[41:58] like he did in the garden of eden
[42:42] i
[43:11] considered
[43:12] to be somewhat uh introverted
[43:16] which means i'm not really you know i
[43:17] don't go i'm not a loud person i'm not
[43:19] very outgoing
[43:21] [Music]
[43:24] espanol but i was thinking about how
[43:27] these i was reflecting on these past two
[43:28] years
[43:31] i was always at home
[43:33] i was working from home
[43:36] i was also doing school from home
[43:43] even i started feeling a little isolated
[43:47] at first i was like well i don't know
[43:48] how everybody else misses people i'm
[43:50] good about myself here in my room
[43:52] is
[43:58] i did start missing that interaction
[43:59] just simple interactions with people
[44:05] i even started missing i started missing
[44:06] coming to church
[44:09] seeing my brother sister christ
[44:12] see seeing my brothers and sisters in
[44:13] christ
[44:16] or just being here in person
[44:19] i had that desire
[44:34] because now people say i'm quiet
[44:37] but when i was little
[44:40] all people wanted me to do it
[44:44] because i talked a lot
[44:47] in school my teachers told me i talked
[44:48] too much
[45:02] they used to challenge me and my cousin
[45:05] tell us can you please sit down for 15
[45:07] minutes
[45:09] that's the first challenge
[45:11] just sitting down
[45:12] the second challenge
[45:14] can you be quiet just for 15 minutes
[45:30] and now people want me to talk
[45:33] about this i went from talking a little
[45:34] too much and now people actually want to
[45:36] hear me talk
[45:39] but that's my experience with with uh
[45:41] talking with fellowship with having
[45:43] relations
[46:04] so they say talk to this person talk to
[46:06] this employer you have to get your
[46:08] connections out
[46:09] i expanded
[46:17] and they tell you to talk to different
[46:18] companies different uh managers people
[46:21] owners of different businesses
[46:28] and it's difficult for me
[46:30] because i just want to just want to mind
[46:31] my own business be in the corner and
[46:33] just be by myself
[46:36] but i know that if i want to progress i
[46:37] have to go and make those connections
[46:42] so for me i say that for me
[46:44] something i look back on
[46:47] it it's been tough for me to to have
[46:48] that fellowship
[46:52] whether it be with people from church
[47:08] am i taking advantage of that sacrifice
[47:14] would he restore that fellowship that
[47:15] connection
[47:20] so i can personally now have a
[47:21] connection with him
[47:25] but it's amazing that god desires to
[47:26] fellowship with us
[47:30] but so then comes the question
[47:34] what is stopping us from having
[47:35] fellowship with god
[47:38] or maybe what's stopping us from having
[47:40] fellowship with our brothers or our
[47:41] families
[47:45] uh is it is it my attitude is
[47:48] it the way i talk es
[47:50] do maybe i don't get along with somebody
[47:53] but brother benham answers that question
[47:56] he says
[47:57] he says what's stopping us from having
[47:59] fellowship with god
[48:03] he says
[48:33] [Music]
[48:46] [Music]
[48:48] so i think about how we when we gather
[48:50] with our brothers and sisters in christ
[48:53] we share that same interest
[48:57] we believe the same message
[48:59] we read the same scriptures
[49:02] we all share that same interest
[49:06] and people have different versions of
[49:07] fellowships
[49:10] i know in school they have what they
[49:11] call graduate fellowships
[49:14] [Music]
[49:19] different programs where they gather
[49:21] together and they help each other
[49:22] whether it be different parts of school
[49:24] differences
[49:27] in escuela whether it be a certain
[49:29] degree or a certain job you're trying to
[49:31] get to they they help you out
[49:36] but those are different things people
[49:37] look at as fellowships
[49:42] but the question is what is the elective
[49:43] fellowship with god
[49:47] and brother gives us an example
[49:50] in this message
[49:52] he refers back a lot
[49:55] to adam and eve
[49:57] he talks about the relationship they had
[49:58] with god
[50:01] they had a perfect relationship with god
[50:05] before sin came ante
[50:08] so brother gives an example
[50:12] now in the beginning when god made man
[50:14] to worship him and live god taking care
[50:16] of him fed him
[50:33] god came down in the evening
[50:35] and talked to adam and eve diwali
[50:48] no sickness could ever come to them
[50:52] they didn't even know what sickness was
[50:56] they didn't know what old age was nos
[50:59] they didn't know what being hurt
[51:03] says they couldn't be heard
[51:06] they were in the presence of the
[51:07] omnipotent powers of god
[51:13] which held them in control and guided
[51:15] them by his spirit
[51:20] there
[51:47] and i think to myself is that a desire
[51:53] i should aim for yes
[51:56] to have that perfect fellowship with god
[52:00] i can be in his presence
[52:30] i like how
[52:38] how he talks and how the situation was
[52:42] it's something that he puts emphasis on
[52:44] algo que
[53:41] i had been having it earlier this
[53:43] earlier last month actually
[53:46] and it all started
[53:49] i got a notification on my phone
[53:51] notification
[53:53] and it was under fake a notification
[53:54] from uh google photos
[53:56] notification photos of google and if
[53:59] you're not aware what that is
[54:01] it's a it's a storage system
[54:05] it's a cloud storage system that where
[54:07] you can save your photos upload them to
[54:08] google
[54:22] so i got a notification from them
[54:24] notification and i clicked on it
[54:27] and it said it two years ago on this day
[54:31] and so it was early march
[54:34] and so i said it was it was in march of
[54:36] 2020 yes
[54:38] so i opened up the photos
[54:41] i only had a handful
[54:43] i wish i took more questions
[54:45] but i looked and it was it was pictures
[54:47] of when uh the youth when we went to our
[54:49] trip to jeffersonville
[55:18] we actually got to go inside the branham
[55:20] tabernacle
[55:22] that's that's somewhere where i had to
[55:23] take a picture i'm not one for pictures
[55:25] but i had to take one there
[55:29] and we also went to the ohio river
[55:32] ohio and that's where one of our
[55:33] brothers
[55:35] who's not here right now okay
[55:37] that's where he got engaged
[55:40] in that's where he proposed
[55:44] and then we also went to the
[55:46] confectionery or the candy store
[55:51] we also went to different museums
[55:53] we even got to attend a service
[55:56] and it was all a great time
[55:59] it was a really good trip
[56:01] a really good a really good time of
[56:02] fellowship
[56:05] not only with god
[56:07] but with one another
[56:09] and the reason i say that
[56:11] is because even though i had all those
[56:13] great memories there okay this
[56:21] [Music]
[56:25] yeah so when we were there we had two
[56:26] vans
[56:27] venice
[56:28] one was for the sisters
[56:30] and one was the brothers
[56:32] and i was sitting all the way in the
[56:34] back
[56:36] i'm one of the taller ones
[56:38] so i needed a place where i had a little
[56:39] more leg space i was in the corner
[56:41] establish
[56:48] and some other brothers were there back
[56:50] back there with me
[56:52] and i remember this i remember this
[56:53] vividly
[56:55] i can't exactly remember which day it
[56:57] was i want to say maybe it was sunday
[56:58] night
[57:01] it was dark out yesterday
[57:03] i think we were probably making our way
[57:04] back to the hotel
[57:07] and i remember we were all just we were
[57:09] all just talking
[57:22] because i want to skim through and just
[57:23] read what it's all about i've heard a
[57:24] lot about
[57:52] about a certain message and then another
[57:54] brother would come in
[57:56] and he would tell us oh yeah about this
[57:57] message
[57:59] and he would ask questions
[58:00] and we would do the best to answer them
[58:04] no we couldn't we'd ask each other we
[58:05] refer to the to the books
[58:43] and but that's something that's really
[58:45] stuck with me
[58:47] just being sitting there in the back
[58:50] of the trash in the van
[58:52] just having a conversation with my
[58:53] brothers my brothers in christ
[58:56] talking about what we believe in
[58:59] trying to answer questions
[59:02] and i i feel that i got to experience
[59:04] fellowship with others and know what
[59:05] it's like
[59:10] so i started thinking
[59:12] is that maybe i caught a glimpse
[59:30] no it was early march of 2020
[59:34] little did we know
[59:36] in a couple weeks
[59:39] things were going to get pretty rough
[59:42] but we weren't worried about that
[1:00:39] tomorrow
[1:01:06] [Music]
[1:01:08] that we're able to have
[1:01:36] here it is
[1:01:38] how do you get into this fellowship
[1:01:42] he says how do you get it
[1:01:44] how do you get it brother brandon
[1:01:46] how do you ever get into this fellowship
[1:01:50] and he responds
[1:02:01] [Music]
[1:02:17] in which we don't know what sickness is
[1:02:19] okay
[1:02:21] we're not worried about old age
[1:02:23] we're not worried about being hurt
[1:02:26] we just have that perfect fellowship
[1:02:31] with our with god
[1:02:45] so it's good that we we have that that
[1:02:47] good communication
[1:02:50] with that good relation
[1:02:52] with one another
[1:02:54] because how i treat my brother
[1:02:57] reflects what i believe
[1:02:59] reflects if i'm really somebody who
[1:03:01] loves god
[1:03:03] then i'll love the people he uses
[1:03:06] i know he is my brother here yes
[1:03:09] he uses our pastor
[1:03:11] he uses all brothers here
[1:03:13] whether it's preaching
[1:03:28] to reflect that that godly love
[1:03:31] each one of them
[1:03:33] because that's where god is at
[1:03:36] we have our personal relationship with
[1:03:37] god
[1:03:39] but we also have a relationship with him
[1:03:40] through others
[1:03:45] and that's what i really wanted to speak
[1:03:46] on this morning
[1:03:48] i know it's a bit short
[1:03:50] but i just wanted to get that thought
[1:03:51] out
[1:03:53] of this redemption
[1:03:55] and fellowship by redemption
[1:04:34] [Music]
[1:04:39] that helps them in their christian walk
[1:04:42] that's that's more than enough
[1:04:44] sufficient whether it be somebody here
[1:04:46] lord
[1:04:47] maybe somebody watching online
[1:04:50] or like i always say
[1:04:52] maybe somebody who will watch this in a
[1:04:54] couple days or in a week
[1:04:57] maybe they'll click on this video
[1:05:00] and they'll listen through
[1:05:02] and they'll be able to get something
[1:05:05] something to help them lord
