[17:43] [Music]
[17:51] let us open up our bibles
[17:54] to the book
[17:56] written by the apostle paul saints
[18:12] 12 to 16.
[18:22] foreign
[19:09] for as many as have sinned without law
[19:12] shall also perish without law and as
[19:14] many as have sinned in the law shall be
[19:16] judged by the law
[19:18] for not the hearers of the law are just
[19:20] before god but the doers of the law
[19:23] shall be justified
[19:25] for when the gentiles which have not the
[19:27] law do by nature the things contained in
[19:31] the law these having not the law
[19:34] are a law unto themselves
[19:36] which show the work of the law written
[19:39] in their hearts
[19:40] their conscience also bearing witness
[19:42] and their thoughts the meanwhile
[19:44] accusing or else excusing one another
[19:48] in the day when god shall judge the
[19:50] secrets of men by jesus christ according
[19:54] to my gospel
[19:58] before you sit down why don't you turn
[19:59] and shake yourself
[20:04] welcome have various visitors here tell
[20:07] the visitors
[20:08] god bless you you're welcome
[20:17] juan grande
[20:18] [Music]
[20:29] oh
[20:33] [Music]
[20:45] is
[20:46] [Music]
[21:01] oh
[21:05] [Music]
[21:21] [Music]
[21:34] would like to welcome each and every one
[21:36] of you to this place where we come to
[21:38] worship the lord
[21:42] we
[21:57] we're also happy that brother james
[21:58] garcia is here with us
[22:03] tremendous servant of the lord that is
[22:04] working in san diego
[22:12] i don't know that if you know that
[22:13] brother andrades
[22:16] had an accident and is in the hospital
[22:21] let us pray to the lord that the lord
[22:23] will bring him out healthy
[23:19] anybody else no another mask
[23:37] [Applause]
[23:47] we're speaking about we're bringing
[23:49] messages on concerning the book of
[23:50] romans and this is the message number
[23:53] thirty
[24:02] uh the thirty-one
[24:04] uh that we're speaking on right now is
[24:06] your conscience
[24:07] and the day of judgment
[24:11] this is uh the message number three on
[24:14] the subtitle
[24:15] domingo proximo pasado
[24:19] last sunday we spoke on one side of the
[24:21] coin
[24:26] taken as a baby
[24:28] first peter 3 21.
[25:06] the like figure where unto even baptism
[25:09] does also now save us then in
[25:11] parentheses it says
[25:13] not to put in the way of the filth of
[25:15] the flesh but the answer of a good
[25:17] conscience toward god
[25:20] and the princesses by the resurrection
[25:22] of jesus christ
[25:38] we saw that it was very important to be
[25:39] baptized in christian baptism
[25:46] we saw how it was that the blood of
[25:48] jesus christ cleanses us from our sin
[25:54] from
[26:06] we need to be baptized in the name of
[26:08] the lord jesus christ
[26:13] baptism produces a good conscience
[26:18] but it does not take away
[26:21] the filthiness of the
[26:35] one thing that we need to know
[26:37] concerning baptism
[26:41] when someone
[26:43] receives baptism it is a public
[26:45] confession
[26:49] they are confessing that they have
[26:50] accepted jesus christ
[26:57] but this public
[26:59] confession does not take away the
[27:00] filthiness of the flesh
[27:44] as you know as i move amongst the people
[27:45] and travel to different places
[27:51] we can really see the things that
[27:53] perturb man
[27:56] the things that molest the thinking of
[27:59] the believers
[28:36] but the teaching of the word uh is what
[28:39] places the believer in his place
[29:34] let us draw near with a true heart
[29:37] in full assurance of faith having in our
[29:40] hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience
[29:44] and our bodies washed with pure water
[29:51] i would like to say that this verse
[29:52] speaks to us about a fountain
[29:58] i believe that even though we have
[29:59] spoken many times concerning this
[30:04] people still have not been able to
[30:06] understand it
[30:21] him and i noticed them and i studied
[30:22] them and i find out that they do not
[30:24] believe it
[30:26] they do not believe it
[30:31] for example let's say that i say this
[30:33] way hey
[31:02] so he can take care of me because i'm
[31:03] sick
[31:05] if you are intelligent at all
[31:09] you will know that he did not believe
[31:11] what he said the first time
[31:14] even though i say okay
[31:26] but inside of me i have not believed it
[31:29] for example
[31:57] he was the one that existed he was a
[31:58] self-existing woman
[32:02] we have known we have been taught there
[32:03] was no noise
[32:05] there was no air no yeah
[32:08] it was not neither atoms nor molecules
[32:12] there was a total silence
[32:40] which created
[32:55] from that which was not seen
[32:58] it wasn't seen but now it is
[33:02] so then that word was made flesh
[33:06] and when it was made flesh would be held
[33:08] the glory
[34:18] over the but we
[34:21] unless we bypass nosotros
[34:28] we bypass the body of the word
[34:32] to come
[36:08] is in san diego
[36:23] i'm very difficult to interpret
[36:38] i'd like to read to you
[36:40] in the still book
[36:48] so i want to show you that fountain
[37:01] that when you accept jesus christ
[37:05] and you are forgiven
[37:18] it seems like we are struggling
[37:36] to clean off that
[37:38] in other words
[37:46] and it does not take away
[38:16] is
[38:24] 282 in english in the seven cells
[38:28] this is
[39:36] now they were gods and man if you become
[39:39] born in the family of your family name
[39:42] you are a son and a part of your father
[39:46] then when sin came in
[39:48] we found out the man crossed the chasm
[39:51] and brought up bulls and goats
[39:53] for cover
[39:55] but did not remit until the real bleach
[39:57] came
[39:58] that could take the stain of sin
[40:01] and break it completely to pieces and
[40:03] send it back upon its original perverter
[40:07] that was satan
[40:08] when it got back to satan
[40:10] he was his time of eternal annihilation
[40:14] now that shows what we believe we
[40:16] believe that he will be absolutely
[40:19] completely done done away and
[40:21] annihilated
[40:26] i would like for the brother to help me
[40:27] with two words in english okay cover
[40:30] the word cover
[40:31] cover cover
[40:34] and the other word is remit
[40:50] ghost they covered the sin
[40:57] but the clorox
[41:03] now to remit
[41:06] is to send away
[41:10] i'm going to remit my letter
[41:14] so when we understand what the word
[41:16] means
[41:45] the other day brother paul was baptizing
[41:52] and i was interpreting for him
[41:57] and then when i was interpreting
[42:00] i did not notice
[42:27] well how can that be possible
[42:31] and what was the mistake
[42:35] he said this way i baptize you i baptize
[42:38] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[42:41] for the remission
[42:56] so
[43:23] it does not matter
[43:38] and
[43:49] for example here is a folder
[44:16] doesn't matter how often they search me
[44:18] there is nothing there
[44:20] that's the way it is
[45:18] continuing in reading i believe that sin
[45:22] will be broke up
[45:23] when it's confessed
[45:26] under the basis of the blood of jesus
[45:28] christ
[45:30] it's just like dropping a drop
[45:33] of black ink in a bunch of clorox bleach
[45:37] it just breaks it into the chemicals and
[45:40] sends it plumb back to where it come
[45:42] from
[45:43] and that's the way the blood of jesus
[45:45] christ does
[45:47] then that sets a man across the chasm
[45:49] again as a son of god
[45:54] now let us read
[45:56] it
[45:57] isaiah 1 18.
[46:26] but then when we began
[46:39] to fix our life
[47:35] though they be read like crimson they
[47:37] shall be as wool
[47:43] it doesn't matter how black or how red
[47:45] your sin is
[47:47] that sin can be taken
[47:50] how can it be
[48:32] foreign
[48:39] and i saw the dead small and great stand
[48:42] before god
[48:43] and the books were opened and another
[48:46] book was open which is the book of life
[48:49] and the dead were just out of those
[48:51] things which were written in the books
[48:53] according to their work
[48:57] i'm going to ask you a couple of
[48:58] questions
[49:40] there are two types of people uh
[50:10] the
[50:23] what is it written with
[50:38] a lot of people like that the book would
[50:40] be written with pencils so who can erase
[50:41] it and make changes but it's written
[50:43] with ink
[50:45] is it written with a ink
[50:48] it's written with ink
[50:51] perfect
[51:00] he speaks through his mouth correcto is
[51:03] that right
[51:04] fiona
[51:06] yes or no
[51:20] all we have to do is apply that message
[51:22] to our heart
[51:24] it says like this
[51:30] is
[51:39] i believe that sin will be broke up when
[51:42] it's confessed upon the basis of the
[51:44] blood of jesus christ
[52:02] it's just like dropping a drop of black
[52:06] ink
[52:07] in a bunch of clorox beach
[52:12] why did he compare it with a drop of
[52:16] creviendo
[52:30] that
[52:58] up
[53:12] not
[53:36] i put the word there confessed
[54:36] upon the basis of the blood of jesus
[54:38] christ for example let us say for
[54:40] example
[54:44] putting myself in the middle east
[54:49] i really like to steal
[55:03] and i am not ashamed
[55:17] but god forgive me
[55:30] but through the years has been maybe 30
[55:32] 40 years
[55:45] and i said well
[55:53] the other day i saw the quarter from
[55:54] brother campo
[56:28] him
[56:30] i said oh i know what i'm going to do
[56:34] i'm going to get into my bedroom
[56:39] i'm going to say lord jesus
[57:38] there was a woman that had lived with
[57:39] another man
[57:45] and she went to the psychiatrist and to
[57:47] the doctors and nobody could cure her
[57:51] the reason was she had never confessed
[57:53] herself
[57:55] she was afraid that her husband would
[57:57] divorce her
[58:00] because she had committed an incorrect
[58:01] act
[58:05] you have to uh
[58:21] time of 10 15 years
[58:23] they do not want to confess their sins
[58:27] and they run again to be baptized
[58:30] you don't need to be baptized
[58:47] when you make everything
[59:00] he's a sinner
[59:17] real quiet oh yeah
[59:19] we are happy garlic
