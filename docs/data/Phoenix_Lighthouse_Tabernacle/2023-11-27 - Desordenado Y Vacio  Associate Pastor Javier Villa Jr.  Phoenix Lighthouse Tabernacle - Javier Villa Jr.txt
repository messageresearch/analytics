Without Blame before him in denominations in love when did God choose us when did God choose you that's got the Holy Ghost when did he choose you before the foundation of the World by his for knowledge he forw you and know that you love him and before there was a foundation of the world he chose you and sent Jesus that he might be the propitiation of your SS to call you to reconciliation to himself to love oh wish we had just a few more minutes time let me before we go any further go back Genesis 126 I'll pick it up Wednesday when God made man before he made man he called himself l e l l e l h l l o eloh the word means in the Hebrew the self all by himself nothing existed before him he was all the existence he ever was self existence on means all sufficient all powerful allm Mighty self existence one but inesis when he made man he said I am y a h u j u v u h yah what did it mean am the all existence one who has created something all for myself to be a son of mine are a temporary or an am little one of mine why he gave man Jehovah means that he gave man to be an amateur God because he is Father God and he made a man an amateur God so he isn't self-existence anymore he exists with this [Music] family Elohim now now he is Jehovah Jehovah meaning the one who exists with his family now God made man to be the predominant over all the Earth he had dominion and the Earth was man's Dominion is that scripture then if that's his domain he was God over the Earth he could speak and it would be so he could speak this it would be so he is god Jehovah the one who once existed in self-existence but now exists with his family and his little ones with him amen there Hallelujah I read that we'll get into it Wednesday night when we got more time just about 15 more minutes and we I thought I'd get to a certain spot here but uh we won't now where we're sealed by the holy SP Spirit of Promise all right now when was we called to be Servants of God when was AR nille called to be a servant of God this staggers me oh I tell you let's get some scriptures I want you to get first Peter and uh get Revelations 178 and I'll get Revelations now we want to listen here you want to know when God called you to be a Christian oh I love this this man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God all right brother nille you got first Peter 120 read 119 and 120 listen this but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without without who verily was fored before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you when was he [Music] forain before the foundation of the world brother Pat read Revelation 178 for me Beast that thou s and is not and shall out of the bottom they that dwell on the Earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the book of from the found of the world who's going to be deceived who's going to be deceived by this religious person like Saul was that was just so cunning and so perfect to it would deceive the what very e all right Revelations 138 let me read it for you and all that dwell upon the Earth Earth sh all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names were not written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slaying before the foundation of the world Hallelujah when was our names put in the Lamb's Book of Life when the lamb was slain before the foundation of the [Music] world when godh El the self-existence one just like one great big diamond and he could not be nothing else but inside of this diamond his attributes was a savior in this inside of him was a Healer while there was nothing to save and nothing to heal but his attributes produced St so then before the foundation of the world when he know that the great display in here of him that he would be a savior that he would come and be made flesh and dwell Among Us and he know by his stripes would be healed he slay the Lamb on his book before the foundation of the world and wrote your name on that book before the foundation of the world oh amenes listen to this predestination looks back to for knowledge I mean election election looks back to for knowledge and predestination looks to Destiny don't forget that that is election looks back here here I was a I was born in sin shap iniquity come to the world speaking lies born among Sinners father and mother and all my whole family sin I was a but all of a sudden I become a wheat grain how did it happen that what is that election God before the foundation of the world elected that the was to become a grain of wheat now because I'm Sav how do I do it look back and see that heated long AG he seemed that I would love him so he made a propitiation to his own son that through him I might become from a Cocker to a [Music] I at now I'm saved I'm walking in the grace of God what does predestination look to Destiny where will he take me to and where am I going there you are amen now let's read just a little further and then we'll have to close pretty shortly according as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy Without Blame before him and love having predestinated us unto the adoption predestinated unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will what did he do he by for knowledge for saw us knowing that he was a savior self-existence there was no Ang no nothing just God El Elohim the self-existence one nothing but him alone but in him was a savior well what he go to save there's nothing lost knowing that then he know that this great attribute in him would project something out down there that he could save then when he did that by four knowledge he looked down and he saw every one that would accept it and then by doing so he said sa that the only way I can do it will be come down myself and be made flesh and take the sin of the man upon him and die for him that I might be the one that's worship because he is God the object of worship then he came down and taken upon himself and while he did that he did that that he might save you who wants to be saved do you see what I mean knowledge amen the infinite God who know all things saw the lamb and he slay the lamb before the foundation of the world and he put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life if any seen the deceitfulness of Satan what he would do so he put your name on there and he said that the an Christ would be so religious so good such a fine fellow such a smart man such a religious man that he would deceive that very elected if it was possible but it isn't impossible because her names were forain before the foundation of the world election he chose them and by predestination they know where they are going now who could doubt that that's what Paul said that's Paul's scripture that's Paul's writing that's what he taught his church the church positioning before the foundation of the world when God in his labor pain was bringing forth bringing forth you knowing what you would do he positionally placed you into his own body Amen to be a housewi to be a farmer to be a preacher to be a prophet to be this are to be that he placed you positionally when we have come from the garlic lands of Egypt through sanctification and baptized into the Promised Land for the promise of God is the Holy Ghost amen Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption then God having predestinated the church he said all the there will be Millions times millions that will walk very religious and be [Music] deceived the only ones that will not be deceived will be those that have come over into the Promised Land who before the foundation of the world had their names put on the Lamb's Book of Life and come over into the promised land and it many people are afraid you're going to act funny many people are afraid the Holy Ghost will make you do something you'll be ashamed of people people many people are afraid they'll cry and their sweetheart will see them crying our mama or your neighbor or your boss will see you let me tell you about a man one time before closing that was a man named David and when the Ark of God had been down in the Philistine land and had come across P when David saw that AR coming he had a little go on him he run out there kick his feet in that a jumped around and screamed and jumped and danced and jumped and danced and him the king of Israel and his wife looked out of the window and saw him acting so strange she despised him why she must have said the idiot look at him out there the way he's acting throwing his feet up in the air around acting like that why he must be crazy and that night one come in she said and words like this why you've embarrassed me why you the king my husband out there doing like that acting like that David said tomorrow I'll do better than that yes sir he said don't you know I was dancing unto the [Music] Lord crossed over he was in the land of the promise he'd lost all self Styles and buck of the world he was so happy to know that the ark was coming into his own City no I tell you some

the opportunity he's granted us to be here also thanking our pastor for his trust I told him we're looking for a visiting Minister and I wasn't able to escape we thank God thank you brother for being here with us uh the word of the Lord reads the following something very simple we'd like to speak on waiting on God for him to help us thanking Dr Montoya for the opportunity he's granted us Hing you could withstand me for a few minutes the word of the Lord reads the foll Genesis 1:1 and two amen amen amen the word of the Lord reads in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and the Darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters now turn the same book Genesis to chapter 8 verse 8 also Genesis 88 word reads also he sent forth a dove from him to see if the waters were Abad from off the face of the ground but the dove found no rest for the soul of her foot and she returned unto him into the ark for the waters were on the face of the whole earth then he put forth his hand and took her and pulled her into him into the ark verse 10 and he stayed yet in other seven days and again he sent forth a dove out of the AR vers 11 and the Dove came into him in the evening and low in her mouth was an olive leaf pluck off so Noah knew that the waters were Abad from off the Earth amen Amen brother we take your seats we thank you very simple hoping that God may help every one of us thought I'd like to bring forth this evening title it the way it reads in Genesis 1 verse two titled without form and void Amen brother we know the scripture through the revelation of the message has a double fulfillment has many fulfillments if I would give it a subtitle tile it the great search the reason why I have this thought what gets my attention is the words without form and void the word without form not having form means confusion an alteration of order means disturbances of order perturbed of discipline whether it's a group of people or meeting or community of people also meaning it's a disturbance which Alters public uh Tranquility it's an excess it's an abuse that's what the word disorderly without form means the word void lacking of context where it's physical or mental also meaning it's empty or lack of something solid void also means invain without fruit something unfinished the word void also means Idol with with empty or something that a person should have but doesn't void also means a gap like if it was a cliff or something something high and then there's there's nothing on the other side so meaning a space which lacks matter so that's how the Earth was so in the beginning the Earth was without form Earth had no form in confusion Earth was was Disturbed without [Music] discipline lots of turbulation but not only that it was also void vacant not solid without fruits it lacked matter that's how Earth was in the beginning but the Bible tells us there's two things that we need to pay attention to here that the darkness was over the face of the Earth amen but also the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters the spirit of God is the holy spirit moved over the face of the waters Prophet tells us it was like a dove that was I was carrying watching over the Earth so it would bring forth fruit well that was in the beginning God made his creation six days his creation made it perfectly beautiful and in the fall as we heard this morning sin entered then a change on Earth began God made Earth perfect in other words from from without form and void God made something tremendous special Something Beautiful something we cannot describe for God makes things perfect Perfection was there but when sin enters it only took man 2,000 years scripture reads Genesis 6 there was a great wickedness in men and their mind continually in wrong so many things on earth that the flood came correct flood comes something happens there earth once again now mankind turns back to the beginning disorderly and void correct so Noah being in the ark Let's Lose a dove that Dove types of what's happening in the beginning again the dove a symbol of the Holy Spirit flying over the flood over the waters says let the dove loose before let a raven loose when he let the Raven loose he would come and go Prophet says that the Raven was feeding himself off the rotted flesh that was on the Earth again the Earth was without form and void God sent the dove Noah a dove a type and when he doesn't send a dove when he sends a the the story history repeats again the the face of the water scripture reads that the dove did not find where he could plant himself and sit down the dove did not find where was able to to to bait on the ground the dove failed in its search for there was a disorder Earth was again vacant Earth was confused but see scripture reads that Noah wait another seven days and sent the dove again out of the Ark correct after the seven days in the evening time let's see the types the evening time the dove brought in its beak an olive leaf he had found an olive tree or an olive plant Olive we get oil from found something where the dove could rest brought evidence to the ark something tremendous it reads Noah understood that the waters were Abed from off the Earth correct correct well this was the first 2,000 years now the scripture repeats itself that was in the fall so the following 2,000 years history repeats itself that's right remember the Bible is not only a book but it's a prophetic book to understand what's happening today the next 2,000 years God himself Lord of Glory took a body scripture reads complete Divinity of God emptied itself in a called Jesus was God on Earth he gets here on Earth found the same thing that happened with Noah happened in the beginning mankind without for and void history repeating itself when Jesus walks on water remembering the type of the dove back with Noah and above the water could not rest could not plant his foot as in the beginning spirit of God moved upon the waters not find rest scripture repeats itself but the Lord his grace and mercy I'm GNA do something to be able for the dove find a place where to rest he emptied his spirit in 120 the perfect church at Pentecost this is the example to follow people with the Holy Spirit In other words with a symbol with God's Dove now another 2,000 years have passed and Brethren what's happened same thing same thing things happened the church now the church find itself again without void amen amen that's why God sends a prophet to bring this scripture into a reality the time which we're living in history repeats itself but thanks to God when you read the Bible and see that the dove brings evidence when brother in the evening time the beginning of the day remember the day was cting when the sun came up to sun down complete day for them night Darkness continu the evening time at the end of the day at the End of the Age after the seven church after the seven days God sends again his Dove and continue searching but cannot find rest with's foot because now the church is without form and void it's confused perturbed Disturbed void empty it's idle without without being filled it's in in a in a cliff God's Church vacant now he calls the individual for the dove sent in these days God's grace was opened so that the church in other words God is calling individuals get out of the disorder get out of the Void the that is sent daily and is searching elders women children young people who is willing to receive the dove when you get up that's an opportunity receive the dove but it's got to be in you but you got to be in a state in the place where you're not in disorder you're not void the dove says scripture says Dove brought the evidence in it be an olive branch correct Olive Lea the scripture reads Noah understood that the waters were Abed from off the Earth what does Waters mean Revelation 175 tell us that Waters mean peoples many people Nations tongues and other words man represents Waters represent mankind human being is made up three parts of water there's lots of mankind in US scripture tells me that the dove confirmed ired that the waters had Abed from off the Earth we're also Earth the dust of the we are took from the earth and we will give back to the so we're dust and water but what the word means because the search continues Waters to be Abad or to to to to to go away for what we have much mankind lot of water we don't need what are you trying to tell me with Waters see the dove is waiting for our water to Abate to for let loose of that water for we have too much make it let me make it easier more simple we have too much mankind within us make it even more simple too much a Man Too Much of us too much discipline too much idleness too much vanity too much pride etc etc etc etcc etc that's why the dove cannot rest on the P until those Waters go away until they leave my IDL goes my disorder goes away and pride my my own way for us to get an order let that Dove fill the person when the person comes is taken an olive takes their testimony takes it to the Father the have Abed in other words your sons your bride your church your Waters eved now you can come down be one with them why brother because we're without form and void the word repeats itself again the dove continue searching my time is up forgive me I'm going to finish with this the search continues the great search God continues searching you wake up the moment you wake up scripture reads if he watches over the watches over the flock over the birds he's going to watch over and you'll be ready to say Lord take away my form fill my void bring that Dove to me many times we don't know we don't understand the dove leaves the following day Dove comes again searing for you searching for you searching for everyone who you can say brother who they who want it they who need it it rejects the world I make so many mistakes that's why God's coming to you he wants for you to get that great experience that'll make the difference in your life when you have that experience when you have that encounter with God everything changes you come with a vision you always look towards Calvary nothing will move you nothing will agitate you nothing will knock you down your sight is on Calvary that's what the scripture reads there'll be a thousand to your to your right but it won't get to you sight is on calv the dove has made has filled that void inside has taken that the proof to the father and is telling him Lord you can get off the ark now you can get off the ark now the arc is the word the word it's going to become flesh flesh in you now you or that Ark they who look at you come close to you you'll be able to reach them into a refuge for those people you convert yourself shield for the people you begin feel in your heart to pray for the people why because the dove has found rest but it's not for everyone for they who want they who decide I denounce everything I have I want that service after service church service after church service is here above the waters the waters are you see who's ready who's willing who wants it if you want it this evening please stand father of Glory we thank you for your word Lord our hands are lifted up and we ask you with all of our heart when the dove comes when your Holy Spirit comes that's what the Bible tells us do not upset the Holy Spirit don't make him upset don't let him leave father it's because we're not ready we haven't understood the continue searching continue searching for individuals are willing Lord to take that decisive step you want to take that step lift up your hands tell them Lord I want from today
