[36:52] for
[37:05] our lord and savior jesus christ amen
[37:08] amen
[37:10] before anything
[37:12] i just want to read a quick scripture
[37:16] so if you can open your bibles to
[37:18] second corinthians
[37:32] but
[37:38] so
[37:39] reach like this yes you live
[37:41] wherefore come out from among them and
[37:44] be separate save the lord
[37:47] and touch not the unclean thing and i
[37:49] will receive you
[37:52] apart
[37:57] and i will be a father unto you and you
[38:00] shall be my sons and daughters saith the
[38:02] lord almighty
[38:25] and i've been teaching i've been helping
[38:27] my uncle teach sunday school recently
[38:33] and i was speaking on mother's day
[38:37] and
[38:39] as i was speaking he wanted to say one
[38:40] thing
[38:43] and he said to our students
[38:47] that not everyone has a mother
[38:50] you know
[38:51] and he pointed to one class specifically
[38:55] specifically and it was the five to
[38:56] seven year olds
[38:58] de cinco
[39:08] and
[39:09] that's when i realized it could be the
[39:10] same situation with a father
[39:25] that's jesus christ amen this is and
[39:28] thankfully he's giving me a mother and a
[39:29] father today
[39:33] along with my grandpa and my grandma
[39:37] you know because they're just like my
[39:38] parents too okay
[39:41] and i love each and every one of them
[39:47] and
[39:50] you know but we're not perfect amen
[39:53] you know god created us to be human
[40:04] and one specific one we've been covering
[40:07] specifically
[40:21] was that anger is one letter short from
[40:23] danger
[40:28] as a kid i would get angry real easily
[40:33] i would get into arguments with people
[40:36] whether it was my parents
[40:38] padres my friends
[40:40] amigos my family my family
[40:42] and
[40:44] um one of the things
[40:47] was
[40:48] i would argue with my dad sometimes
[40:52] and
[40:54] i would it would be mainly because i
[40:56] didn't want to do something you know
[40:59] for example i i would never want to go
[41:01] to
[41:02] my martial arts school for example you
[41:04] know
[41:18] he was doing it for me for me and i
[41:20] didn't get that for the longest time
[41:23] however today
[41:25] i have a better understanding of what he
[41:26] was doing
[41:32] and you know without them uh
[41:34] i didn't go just for you know
[41:36] self-defense or nothing no no no no
[41:38] defense appropriate i would go you know
[41:40] they also taught us important lessons
[41:44] and without what i was taught there is
[42:08] and i was 16 at the time
[42:11] and anger got the best of me
[42:27] and so the first thing is i snapped at
[42:30] my mom
[42:32] i don't know why no
[42:34] that's just how i was feeling that dude
[42:37] and
[42:38] in those types of situations
[42:41] my dad knew how to take control
[42:45] instead of yelling at me
[42:47] invest in
[42:49] gritar
[42:50] or sending me to my room or something
[42:53] he would talk to me hell may have loved
[42:55] me and
[42:56] that always helped yes
[43:00] but for some reason today was different
[43:04] after him saying that he wanted to help
[43:06] me
[43:07] kill me
[43:08] i told him i didn't need him right now
[43:24] is how my dad's father is
[43:26] father
[43:27] would never let him talk to him the way
[43:29] i did
[43:33] and then i realized something
[43:35] my dad's father
[43:38] passed away when he was 16.
[43:42] and that's how that was right there he
[43:44] says
[43:46] all he had was his mom
[43:50] growing up with his brothers and sisters
[43:53] and it was a total of nine kids
[43:57] you know as a parent
[44:00] i've heard that having one or two kids
[44:03] is hard enough
[44:18] and so
[44:21] um there was this one time before
[44:24] it was actually father's day
[44:26] and it was a couple years ago yes
[44:29] um
[44:31] so
[44:31] i remember i had just gotten home
[44:35] and
[44:36] we wanted to go see
[44:38] our other side of the family
[44:42] and
[44:43] i went with my dad
[44:46] and he
[44:47] he said he wanted to say hi to everyone
[44:50] and as we were in the car
[44:53] he said he wanted to tell my grandma
[44:55] happy father's day
[45:00] he wanted to tell his mom happy father's
[45:01] day
[45:04] and i was confused at the time
[45:08] i was like
[45:09] i don't understand
[45:12] you know she's your mom didn't mother's
[45:14] day just pass
[45:16] the pasta and he's like yeah he needs to
[45:19] see
[45:20] but i didn't have my dad
[45:23] the whole time
[45:26] when we moved here to phoenix he said
[45:28] phoenix my mom was the only person i had
[45:31] my
[45:33] so i never thought about it that way
[45:36] and i'm just thankful that i had both my
[45:37] parents
[45:40] and
[45:41] for those of you don't know who my
[45:43] grandpa was
[45:49] and my dad would always tell me stories
[45:51] about him
[45:53] and how he always got to hear him speak
[45:56] about god
[46:03] and i'm lucky that he was able to share
[46:05] what he learned with me
[46:10] and one thing that stays with me
[46:26] pray
[46:28] and
[46:31] there was one point in my life
[46:35] where i was just confused
[46:38] and i didn't know what's going on
[46:54] as i grew older i didn't know what was
[46:55] going on
[46:58] i didn't know what was next amen
[47:04] and
[47:06] brother branham says
[47:08] the worst thing the devil can put upon
[47:10] you
[47:17] and i was just scared at the time
[47:23] so what i did was just look at you as i
[47:26] was working
[47:28] i just got down on my knees
[47:30] and i started praying
[47:33] and i knew that would help yo
[47:36] and i just trusted what my dad said in
[47:38] your confidence
[47:40] and so that's what i did
[47:42] but the devil was in my head
[47:46] i kept doubting
[47:48] and brother branham says to never doubt
[47:50] yeah
[47:52] and so
[47:53] i started asking myself all these
[47:55] questions
[47:59] like why me okay
[48:01] why why would god choose to help me
[48:03] porque
[48:20] and that was that god
[48:22] is the same yesterday today and forever
[48:26] and i'm just glad i remember that
[48:33] from learning it from my dad
[48:37] from church in iglesia from him taking
[48:39] me to church
[48:42] you know i remember as a kid i would
[48:43] never want to go to church
[49:01] i didn't i didn't i didn't want to
[49:04] i was just a kid at the time
[49:07] i thought why can't i just stay home
[49:09] like any other kid
[49:12] and one thing my dad told me
[49:29] and i'd be like
[49:31] yo this yeah
[49:33] why
[49:34] i just didn't understand either you know
[49:36] you wanted to know not india but he
[49:38] would tell me
[49:40] that his dad would tell him
[50:06] i'm thankful for him to always bring me
[50:09] to church
[50:17] [Music]
[50:53] i can't wait to see you once you get
[50:54] back
[50:57] i just hope you have a good trip overall
[51:00] god bless
[51:03] [Applause]
[51:20] god bless you
[51:21] all this morning
[51:24] before anything else i just want to say
[51:26] happy father's day
[51:30] and i want to thank my pastor for
[51:32] letting us
[51:34] speak and share his pulpit
[51:43] and this time i'm glad that they gave me
[51:45] more time to prepare
[51:49] like i've been telling everyone the last
[51:51] time they let me speak they gave me an
[51:53] hour before the service
[52:02] and
[52:03] this is my first time speaking for
[52:04] father's day and i
[52:06] hope that i do well so please
[52:08] forgive me if i say anything
[52:11] correct
[52:16] correcto
[52:19] anyways i want to spend the time i have
[52:21] talking about our fathers
[52:27] um according to the word
[52:31] a father should be a man who will govern
[52:33] the house
[52:36] who will protect his family
[52:39] a man who will instruct his
[52:42] children
[52:45] to prepare them against the evils of the
[52:46] world
[52:50] i say should because not again not
[52:52] everyone has a father and
[52:54] and unfortunately not every father is
[52:57] like this
[53:04] but my father is a very good example of
[53:06] this
[53:10] my father is the most
[53:12] hard-working person i've ever met
[53:19] not only is he humble
[53:21] and right standing with god
[53:25] but he is
[53:26] he is as wise as he is clever
[53:32] um
[53:34] and sometimes he tries to share that uh
[53:36] wisdom that knowledge with me
[53:40] is
[53:44] [Music]
[53:50] as a teenager i understand the want to
[53:54] rebel and
[54:11] like his advice is just only there to
[54:13] bring us down and just to remind you of
[54:15] your mistakes
[54:21] or that he thinks that we're going to
[54:23] make a lot more mistakes in the future
[54:28] but that's simply not true
[54:32] our fathers just don't want us to suffer
[54:35] like they have suffered
[54:46] honestly i never knew the hardships my
[54:49] father
[54:50] just so that our family could have a
[54:52] better life
[55:01] for those of you who don't know my
[55:03] father
[55:05] repairs air conditioners for a living
[55:10] area
[55:17] which he spends most of his days and in
[55:19] the hot sun
[55:20] or in an attic
[55:26] and not to joke about it but in the heat
[55:28] in arizona is so bad that you could
[55:30] probably use it to cook
[55:41] uh anyways
[55:44] one day i went to a work firm
[55:48] and i was complaining as usual
[55:54] thank you um
[55:55] and i asked my dad do you love your job
[56:00] and he told me well of course
[56:04] i can do this and never get tired of it
[56:09] then i asked did you always wanted to
[56:11] become a repairman it is
[56:24] and then i asked
[56:26] what happened
[56:29] um
[56:30] he told me that's not that's not what
[56:32] god had intended for me
[56:39] uh oh sorry i can't read my own
[56:41] handwriting
[56:46] um
[56:48] he said
[56:50] i'm glad god didn't give me what i
[56:52] wanted he says
[56:56] for it wasn't
[57:07] he said if god made me wealthy
[57:11] not only would i
[57:13] have no heart you know
[57:16] but my children would suffer for it
[57:22] my dad was happy to sacrifice his desire
[57:25] so that
[57:26] his children can have a life with christ
[57:34] and all i'm
[57:36] trying to say is that i love my
[57:38] father
[57:40] even though that i don't show it yeah
[57:42] this is no one seeing you
[57:45] and
[57:46] i
[57:46] i'm sorry um
[57:49] and
[57:51] and i'm proud to be called this son is
[57:58] [Applause]
[58:06] god bless you uh first of all i would
[58:08] like to thank our pastor dr ernest
[58:10] montoya for giving me the privilege
[58:12] to speak behind this pulpit
[58:19] i know it's not an easy thing to do
[58:24] and i know that um
[58:26] having the trust for someone to be back
[58:28] here is a big thing to give so i really
[58:29] appreciate him for that
[58:35] secondly i'd like to give my respect to
[58:37] all the fathers out there today happy
[58:38] father's day
[58:43] i know that it's um it's a great task to
[58:46] have and i know sometimes it can be
[58:48] thankless
[58:58] [Music]
[59:05] our brother carlos and our brother
[59:07] montoya sort of a father figure to us
[59:09] all helping us when we all need them
[59:16] other great men i know that my father
[59:18] has given me the privilege to be
[59:20] introduced to
[59:21] hombres
[59:25] um because i've gotten to know truly
[59:27] great man because um because of this
[59:29] religion and the thing and the gifts
[59:39] um and so going into that i want to go
[59:41] into um a scripture that i have doesn't
[59:43] necessarily
[59:53] the father of the righteous shall
[59:55] greatly rejoice and he that begeth a
[59:57] wise child shall have joy
[1:00:05] i really like this scripture because it
[1:00:07] showed that um
[1:00:08] a father that raises a good child a
[1:00:10] father that raises a righteous one will
[1:00:12] always
[1:00:17] [Music]
[1:00:26] and i really like that because i think
[1:00:28] that while it shows the side where you
[1:00:29] have to be a good son
[1:00:35] i think that it also reflects that um
[1:00:37] for for you to have a good son you have
[1:00:39] to be a good father
[1:00:44] and today the reason why i'm speaking is
[1:00:47] because i'm here to talk about the
[1:00:48] greatest man and father i've ever known
[1:00:50] in my life and that i believe has ever
[1:00:52] walked on earth
[1:01:05] so i want to say that those
[1:01:07] those of us with fathers we're truly
[1:01:09] blessed and we don't understand what we
[1:01:11] have until it's taken from us
[1:01:15] [Music]
[1:01:19] having a father is one of the greatest
[1:01:20] blessings you can ever have
[1:01:29] i know that my father truly practices
[1:01:31] what he preaches
[1:01:34] and while all humans make mistakes when
[1:01:36] i witness my father do something he's
[1:01:38] always done it perfectly
[1:01:44] i've never seen my father's faults and
[1:01:46] i've never seen his sins before nunca
[1:01:48] visto los pecados
[1:01:51] and i think that's really important
[1:01:55] because obviously as a human we all are
[1:02:00] as a human we all make mistakes
[1:02:04] but there's certain mistakes that
[1:02:06] that can be controlled who can see them
[1:02:13] obviously there's certain mistakes you
[1:02:15] can't avoid
[1:02:26] or when i um
[1:02:27] or when i made fun of my dad because he
[1:02:29] missed a turn signal when he's the one
[1:02:31] that lectures me about being such a good
[1:02:44] i've never seen my father angry to the
[1:02:46] point where i'm afraid of him
[1:02:52] i've never seen him complain about a bad
[1:02:53] day
[1:02:56] i've never seen him complain about the
[1:02:57] traffic
[1:03:00] as a matter of fact
[1:03:12] i've never been ashamed of who my father
[1:03:14] is
[1:03:26] i truly admire my father because of the
[1:03:28] things he's done
[1:03:32] and the great things that he's built
[1:03:35] he's built a great family
[1:03:41] and the fact that he did it so good no
[1:03:42] matter what others may think
[1:03:50] on a
[1:03:51] on one side he supported all six of his
[1:03:54] children and made sure that none of them
[1:03:55] ever lacked in life
[1:04:02] which many think is simple but it's
[1:04:03] truly a blessing we all take for granted
[1:04:10] and on the other side
[1:04:12] he's made us all feel very loved and
[1:04:14] cared for
[1:04:18] and he's given us all the love and
[1:04:19] attention that we need
[1:04:23] um i really admire my father
[1:04:38] my father was not born the man he is
[1:04:42] he was made
[1:04:44] and it was through the toughest trials
[1:04:47] and tribulations that i've ever heard
[1:04:48] come from a man
[1:04:53] my father and his brothers did not have
[1:04:55] easy lies as he's told me
[1:05:01] and
[1:05:03] his his story is truly one of greatness
[1:05:06] is
[1:05:08] because through all the troubles that
[1:05:09] he's had he's never forsaken god
[1:05:15] and i truly like the stories that he
[1:05:17] tells me
[1:05:20] because they all have a lesson
[1:05:23] whether whether he might not be trying
[1:05:25] to tell a lesson
[1:05:28] or he's telling me a story just for fun
[1:05:36] um like how he told me he spent money
[1:05:39] playing arcade games when he didn't have
[1:05:40] much money at all
[1:05:48] and he told me this really funny story
[1:05:51] one time and um
[1:05:54] it made me really happy because it
[1:05:56] showed that when he was my age she was a
[1:05:58] little bit like me
[1:06:02] when
[1:06:04] so i asked him one time
[1:06:06] and he told me that if he could be
[1:06:08] anything right now
[1:06:10] he would be he'd want to be a cook
[1:06:15] a
[1:06:23] uh building pancakes doesn't pay as much
[1:06:25] as you build houses haciendo pancakes
[1:06:32] so
[1:06:33] he told me that when he was my age
[1:06:36] he used to work as a cook at a certain
[1:06:38] job
[1:06:40] and he would work the night shift
[1:06:43] and at that night shift he there was um
[1:06:46] security guards in that building
[1:06:54] and uh while while they were working
[1:06:56] they were open
[1:06:59] but since it was not many people would
[1:07:01] come by at all
[1:07:04] so um since it was night time he'd do
[1:07:07] food prep while um while it was night
[1:07:09] time
[1:07:13] and sometimes it would take a while to
[1:07:15] cook and stuff like that
[1:07:19] and he would lay out food on the grill
[1:07:22] to cook or in a pot
[1:07:26] when
[1:07:34] so he'd ask some security guys like hey
[1:07:37] when the food is done cooking can you
[1:07:39] wake me up this is
[1:07:46] and
[1:07:46] they were all pretty cool they would say
[1:07:48] yes and take care of it and stuff
[1:07:52] [Music]
[1:07:53] but one security guard was like what are
[1:07:55] you doing like it's your job
[1:08:00] so one day while uh while he was cooking
[1:08:03] and he was cool with the security guards
[1:08:11] they asked if he could make them some
[1:08:12] sandwiches
[1:08:15] and he was like yeah like you're my
[1:08:16] homie like i'll make a sandwich
[1:08:20] so um
[1:08:21] while he was making them he finished
[1:08:23] making them up
[1:08:26] sandwiches
[1:08:27] and he was like hey i'm going to make
[1:08:29] some for you guys but not for that one
[1:08:30] guy he said
[1:08:35] he and he would call one of them and he
[1:08:36] would say i want you to take your
[1:08:39] sandwich and i want you to call one at a
[1:08:40] time to come get the sandwich until we
[1:08:42] get to that guy
[1:08:49] so they went one at a time getting their
[1:08:51] sandwiches getting their sandwiches
[1:08:54] until that one guy didn't get anything
[1:09:01] and uh he went up to my dad and he was
[1:09:02] like so where's where's my sandwich
[1:09:06] sandwich it was like sandwich i didn't
[1:09:08] make you a sandwich sandwich you cannot
[1:09:09] taste some sandwich
[1:09:11] and uh i think i think that was really
[1:09:13] nice because it showed that my dad was
[1:09:16] was a human
[1:09:17] yes
[1:09:21] sometimes i think my dad is a robot the
[1:09:22] way he doesn't talk at all sometimes
[1:09:27] for father's day i know that he loves
[1:09:29] steaks
[1:09:30] that that expensive steak
[1:09:32] is
[1:09:38] so uh since since i just got that
[1:09:40] paycheck i was like hey dad you want me
[1:09:42] to take you out to longhorn steakhouse
[1:09:47] [Music]
[1:09:54] [Music]
[1:09:57] that's crazy like what can i do to get
[1:09:58] this guy to show some kind of emotion
[1:10:00] see what he wants
[1:10:06] and uh and i i i really do want him to
[1:10:10] show some emotions sometimes
[1:10:14] especially when i get awards at school
[1:10:16] and stuff like that
[1:10:19] and i show him
[1:10:21] and sometimes i want something more than
[1:10:23] a muy bien gordon
[1:10:27] solo un muy bien
[1:10:29] and
[1:10:30] so so coming from that um does we need a
[1:10:33] little i've always wanted to be like my
[1:10:35] dad
[1:10:37] and he's told me about his youth
[1:10:40] and all his stories have meaning it was
[1:10:56] um things that things that i could
[1:10:59] relate to him about
[1:11:02] i wanted to be the type of man that my
[1:11:04] father was
[1:11:08] a useful man
[1:11:26] i didn't want to be like well if we have
[1:11:27] hamburger buns and hamburger bread we're
[1:11:29] all good on food guys
[1:11:35] so um i recently took a job
[1:11:52] and i do this stuff because i want to be
[1:11:53] like my father
[1:11:57] and uh so i know for a fact that some
[1:11:59] people might consider it foolish
[1:12:03] because my mother has always told me how
[1:12:05] hard my father works
[1:12:21] i'd do anything to be the kind of man
[1:12:23] that my father is
[1:12:28] truly truly a man in a different caliber
[1:12:31] yes
[1:12:34] amanda that all men should strive to be
[1:12:37] like
[1:12:39] that i want to strive to be like
[1:12:42] i do this also that i can honor in some
[1:12:44] way everything that he's done for me
[1:13:01] and i really could not thank him enough
[1:13:03] for that
[1:13:06] no matter what my demeanor my behavior
[1:13:07] might say
[1:13:11] i never intend to leave the gift that
[1:13:13] god gave me
[1:13:19] [Music]
[1:13:29] and a loving mother
[1:13:33] and a house that worships god
[1:13:37] is the greatest honor that i think
[1:13:42] that i think my dad will always be proud
[1:13:44] of okay my me
[1:13:46] no matter what i am
[1:13:50] um
[1:13:53] i'll be who i am with god at my side
[1:13:57] because truly what would we be without
[1:13:59] god
[1:14:02] i thank god for my father every day
[1:14:06] and for the kind of man he is
[1:14:09] because he's a good man
[1:14:11] and i truly believe that
[1:14:14] the steps of a good man are ordered by
[1:14:15] the lord
[1:14:21] and my father is a man that people have
[1:14:23] come to pray around for help
[1:14:25] he is
[1:14:39] he's a soft-spoken man of many trades
[1:14:41] and talents
[1:14:46] and uh although we strive to be like my
[1:14:48] father
[1:14:51] so i just want to say that you should
[1:14:53] never forget that um a father a parent
[1:14:55] is the best gift
[1:14:57] you you can ever have
[1:15:00] father
[1:15:04] and especially me and my little brother
[1:15:08] my dad
[1:15:21] and sometimes i take that for granted
[1:15:25] um i try to work as much as i can
[1:15:29] just so i can have some semblance of
[1:15:31] what my dad has done for us to be
[1:15:34] in the place we are right now
[1:15:59] it'll never be anything compared to what
[1:16:01] my father has done for
[1:16:02] me and my family
[1:16:20] he deserves a son who reflects that i
[1:16:21] think
[1:16:24] i'll always try to do my best so that i
[1:16:26] can be someone he's proud of
[1:16:28] me
[1:16:33] the way i look at my dad and say that's
[1:16:35] my dad that's one of the greatest men on
[1:16:36] earth
[1:16:41] i want to be a son
[1:16:43] and a child who can whom my father can
[1:16:45] say that's my son and he's one of the
[1:16:47] greatest sons on earth
[1:16:53] and with that i just want to say god
[1:16:55] bless you all
[1:16:57] happy father's day tall fathers and
[1:16:59] families
[1:17:02] and let's celebrate what our fathers
[1:17:04] have done for us not today but every day
[1:17:09] god
[1:17:11] [Applause]
[1:17:22] it is an honor for me to stand before
[1:17:23] you this beautiful resurrection sunday
[1:17:25] morning
[1:17:29] and i'd like to thank my pastor for this
[1:17:30] opportunity that he's given me to speak
[1:17:32] about my father
[1:17:37] so me my father i see him as a great man
[1:17:54] and although times were not always
[1:17:57] the best of times for us in our family
[1:18:02] but i believe it was all with a purpose
[1:18:04] in god's plan
[1:18:08] i could say that
[1:18:10] everything that we went through it all
[1:18:12] it was
[1:18:13] each had a step for each and every
[1:18:14] single one of us
[1:18:22] and today i would just like to speak
[1:18:23] about a little testimony of my first
[1:18:25] experience with the lord through the
[1:18:26] circumstances of my father
[1:18:34] and i believe that if it wasn't never
[1:18:36] for where the condition that my father
[1:18:38] was in i would have never had my first
[1:18:39] experience
[1:18:46] and i love my father with all of my
[1:18:48] heart so when i say these things i don't
[1:18:49] say these things as something bad
[1:19:04] and it was at the time where my father
[1:19:06] was about to get out of prison
[1:19:12] and while he was in there
[1:19:13] i believe with all of my heart that he
[1:19:15] was a changed man
[1:19:20] the same man that went in was not the
[1:19:22] same one that came out
[1:19:26] because even while he was in there he
[1:19:28] was showing me great faith that i've
[1:19:30] never seen before
[1:19:34] when he was in there when we'd go to
[1:19:36] visit him on the sunday's torts the last
[1:19:38] few months that he was about to get out
[1:19:43] on saturdays when we'd go we'd see him
[1:19:45] and he'd always point to a little corner
[1:19:47] right outside the prison
[1:19:53] and he says on this day at this hour
[1:19:54] you're going to come and you're going to
[1:19:55] come pick me up right there
[1:20:01] and for me i
[1:20:03] i had doubt in my heart
[1:20:07] come on
[1:20:09] it's like really you heard what the
[1:20:10] lawyers and what the judge said
[1:20:16] and they said that you're going back to
[1:20:18] mexico and for me that was
[1:20:20] but i heard my father every saturday the
[1:20:22] last few months he'd always say the same
[1:20:23] thing
[1:20:30] and i'd hear him and i'd hear him and i
[1:20:32] just and i just couldn't believe it
[1:20:33] because because
[1:20:35] me growing up in the u.s you learn about
[1:20:38] what power the judge has
[1:20:41] gone
[1:20:48] you see the last
[1:20:50] the the words that they say they have
[1:20:51] the power to sentence somebody
[1:20:57] so i knew that what the judge says was
[1:20:59] final
[1:21:02] final and that no matter what happened
[1:21:04] or what could happen he was they told
[1:21:07] they told him that you're going back to
[1:21:08] mexico
[1:21:14] so for me that was such a there was a
[1:21:16] burden in my heart because i had doubt
[1:21:18] and i didn't know what to believe
[1:21:23] as much as i wanted to believe that my
[1:21:24] father was going to come out here in the
[1:21:26] uk in the
[1:21:37] and then my mom went to the lawyers to
[1:21:40] to see what if
[1:21:46] and she went to the one that she had
[1:21:47] before and she and the lawyer told her
[1:21:49] the exact same thing
[1:21:54] he said there's nothing don't waste your
[1:21:55] money on me there's nothing i can do
[1:21:59] in me
[1:22:01] because he's going to go back to mexico
[1:22:04] and my mother told the lawyer that what
[1:22:06] my father was saying what he's saying
[1:22:08] he's going to come out here
[1:22:13] and then the lawyer says you go and you
[1:22:15] tell him what i said
[1:22:19] and if he doesn't believe believe you
[1:22:21] tell him to call me and i'll tell them
[1:22:23] myself
[1:22:27] and my mother tells me she can't
[1:22:28] remember if she told my father what the
[1:22:30] lawyer said
[1:22:35] because my mom saw the faith that my
[1:22:37] father had and she didn't want to
[1:22:38] disrupt it
[1:22:50] and so but to me thinking about it
[1:22:54] now that i can look back on it
[1:22:58] i don't think
[1:22:59] if my mother would my mother would have
[1:23:01] told her what the lawyer said sh it
[1:23:03] would have not disrupted my father
[1:23:10] because as i said i believe that my
[1:23:12] father was a changed man in that prison
[1:23:18] and i've heard brother bernie and i've
[1:23:19] heard brother branham say the same thing
[1:23:22] hermano bernier
[1:23:24] that once the doctors give up on you
[1:23:29] once the judges and the lawyers
[1:23:31] lost
[1:23:33] when everybody in the world is against
[1:23:34] you
[1:23:37] that's the perfect time for god to work
[1:23:42] so i believe it wouldn't have disrupted
[1:23:44] him
[1:23:46] but to me i still couldn't unders at
[1:23:49] that time i didn't understand
[1:23:52] and around that time was on march it was
[1:23:54] when tabernacle had their camp at pine
[1:23:56] rock
[1:24:01] in pine rock and i've always heard about
[1:24:02] camp it's like if you have a need if you
[1:24:04] have a
[1:24:05] if there's something in your heart go to
[1:24:07] camp
[1:24:12] and my mother asked me if i wanted to go
[1:24:15] and i said yes i want to go.
[1:24:19] and this is probably one of the first
[1:24:20] times i in my life that i can remember
[1:24:23] that i went to a camper i went to a
[1:24:26] service
[1:24:26] wanting something from the lord
[1:24:42] so i put my faith in
[1:24:44] in god
[1:24:46] to see what he could do of this
[1:24:51] and i remember going to camp friday
[1:24:53] service came recording
[1:25:02] i just remember that leaving camp i just
[1:25:05] felt like the burden that was in my
[1:25:07] heart it got lifted
[1:25:24] and then we'd go again the next saturday
[1:25:26] to go visit my father
[1:25:29] and he'd be saying the exact same thing
[1:25:32] but this time i didn't see it in the
[1:25:35] eyes of of what the world or what the
[1:25:37] lawyers of what the judge had said
[1:25:52] and come
[1:26:06] doing nothing play
[1:26:21] and all i heard from the voice that came
[1:26:23] from the from the phone is like
[1:26:27] like it's time come pick me up exactly
[1:26:30] where i told you
[1:27:01] to know that no matter what i go through
[1:27:03] in my life or whatever whatever happens
[1:27:05] with our family
[1:27:09] the same faith that his the same faith
[1:27:11] that he had
[1:27:13] the exact same faith that i can have
[1:27:16] and to see that example to see someone
[1:27:19] that i can that i see every day
[1:27:24] that the world was against
[1:27:27] but he put his faith in something
[1:27:29] greater than the world
[1:27:33] and i believe that even though we
[1:27:35] struggled for so many years
[1:27:40] i'm grateful for each and every single
[1:27:42] one of those years
[1:27:45] because if it wasn't for those years i
[1:27:46] don't think i'd be able to stand before
[1:27:48] you today
[1:27:53] to not have my father for an important
[1:27:56] part of my life
[1:27:58] a
[1:28:10] and that was just for each and every one
[1:28:12] of us in our family gonna get stronger
[1:28:17] to build that character
[1:28:20] that god loves you
[1:28:25] i remember one of my uncles while my
[1:28:26] father was in prison he asked me do you
[1:28:28] love your father
[1:28:34] and without a second going by i said yes
[1:28:36] i love my father
[1:28:38] and he was surprised because that was
[1:28:40] that was a quick answer
[1:28:44] and he asked me why
[1:28:46] i said well
[1:28:48] because he's my dad
[1:28:50] i have to love him
[1:28:52] and now that i think now that i can look
[1:28:55] back on it and i can look now
[1:28:59] i can say that while my dad was in the
[1:29:01] prison god showed him grace mercy and
[1:29:04] love
[1:29:08] and forgiveness
[1:29:10] so if god showed if god forgave my
[1:29:13] father and showed him love
[1:29:17] that means i have to forgive him and i
[1:29:18] have to love my father
[1:29:23] so to me my dad is
[1:29:25] this is a great man
[1:29:29] everything that happened to us i don't
[1:29:30] hold it against them
[1:29:35] because i wouldn't be here today without
[1:29:36] it
[1:29:47] just like all of you fathers and my
[1:29:49] pastor that are great example for your
[1:29:51] sons
[1:29:54] that we can see that are in their
[1:29:56] position where they need to be okay
[1:30:01] because i believe if i were to just sit
[1:30:03] down on one of the benches
[1:30:28] i've learned so much about him more than
[1:30:31] more now than any time
[1:30:45] um
[1:30:59] he's trying to teach me something
[1:31:32] so if i said anything
[1:31:34] that he may not like
[1:31:37] i'll just wait for that phone call later
[1:31:44] i just wanted to say to all the dads
[1:31:45] here happy father's day
[1:31:48] felicia del padre and to my dad that's

[1:34:29] we're very fortunate to have brother
[1:34:30] trinity
[1:34:42] foreign
[1:34:58] he really only speaks about things that
[1:35:00] he lives
[1:35:03] he he spoke a time in nacogdoches texas
[1:35:08] texas about the secrets of daily living
[1:35:26] and in these details it's it's a
[1:35:29] it becomes so great
[1:35:33] in just the way that he speaks that one
[1:35:35] would speak to their wife
[1:35:38] or the one that once would speak to the
[1:35:39] kids when they get home
[1:35:43] he said a thing when we were there in
[1:35:44] texas
[1:35:47] you never want to forget your
[1:35:48] anniversary
[1:35:50] all right just forget it once it must be
[1:35:52] that day one another and of course that
[1:35:54] he's not saying to forget it
[1:35:57] but he spoke a lot on on little details
[1:36:02] you know and he talks about how
[1:36:04] when he started in this message
[1:36:08] he wanted to share with his coworkers
[1:36:12] he didn't know what books to take
[1:36:15] so he asked our
[1:36:17] brother paul garcia
[1:36:19] paul garcia jr and he told him we'll
[1:36:21] just
[1:36:22] leave them the message
[1:36:26] and then they'll see something
[1:36:28] and then they'll want to come to church
[1:36:32] just leave them alive
[1:36:35] and you know and when reflecting on this
[1:36:37] father's day
[1:36:41] i was listening to a message of
[1:36:42] perseverance
[1:36:46] it's difficult to find a lot on father's
[1:36:48] day
[1:37:00] so i looked for a message that was
[1:37:02] preached on this day on june 19th this
[1:37:04] is
[1:37:15] [Music]
[1:37:17] of different characters in the bible the
[1:37:26] of a sister that comes from california
[1:37:27] to hear him speak leonard
[1:37:29] california
[1:37:31] you know they weren't going to do a
[1:37:32] prayer that day
[1:37:34] but she found a way
[1:37:37] she found a way to be with brother
[1:37:38] branham
[1:37:40] she had a tumor
[1:37:42] and then she was able to get prayed for
[1:37:44] really quickly
[1:38:01] and he says he talks about brother
[1:38:03] manana
[1:38:04] brother bannon speaks
[1:38:08] it was a brother that he called manana
[1:38:10] yes
[1:38:12] because he was so slow
[1:38:42] and she
[1:39:23] you know he had to have been persevering
[1:39:30] they told my father not so long ago
[1:39:34] you know oh he
[1:39:36] he had cancer
[1:39:37] but he was still working there like oh
[1:39:53] in the same manner when he had a small
[1:39:54] stroke
[1:39:58] and he
[1:39:59] in the same way
[1:40:01] you know it was difficult time for all
[1:40:02] of us
[1:40:04] but we were able to make it through but
[1:40:06] foreign
[1:40:40] and you know um just uh

[1:42:33] things

[1:42:37] our families
[1:42:40] and my
[1:42:45] and he told me that recently he brother

[1:42:50] sentence

[1:42:53] father brother bernie jr
[1:43:25] things started to get a lot better
[1:43:29] when brother trini was saved
[1:43:32] that's what he was saying about about my
[1:43:34] father
[1:43:36] because he dedicated his life to the
[1:43:37] people
