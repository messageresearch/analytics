Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen take your seats God bless you brother it's always good to be in the house of the Lord happy to see every one of you Colombia as you know we just came back from Barranca Colombia and every one of the Brethren sends greetings in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ what would happen in Barranca the local Pastor there is something happens to me I want you to go to Brothers sometimes the reason our pastor tells you something because God already shown him because he's trying to surprise you I see likewise the pastor from that place and he told his congregation Lighthouse I want you to see the webpage of our brothers from Phoenix Lighthouse the reason I say this is they know the majority of you they know who our musicians are yeah they know who the preachers they follow us online and admire every one of you is because of the pastor we have there's an appreciation to this church and to every one of its members and every one of the ministry that is my opinion I believe we have the best here because if you don't believe that way [Music] that you've been with your wife until you find out God give you a jewel in your handsome so what are you doing with that we have a stewardship that God's given every one of us that's what I'm happy to be home again there's nothing like being home when I get home is and I see every one of you I feel very happy if I hadn't seen you for a very long time I feel like I appreciate you more very tremendous are you now you attract people as you are not alone you attract uh things that are similar so you have young men and women they're going to attract young men and women because young men and women throughout the world they want to know what you do okay what do you do in your daily life how do you obtain the victory how do you overcome daily what do you do what do you do at work what do you do when you're out shopping how do you obtain the victory because it's not the big things scripture reads and our messenger says the small things that we stopped doing Queens from making it that day that's the big things um complicated you I have a series of messages that are chronologically hear from Brothers because you are what you eat his ways we need a member from the body of Christ and when his niendo sobrel las manos and entered into his house and putting his hands on him even Jesus may God bless you God bless you brother can you hear me um at first when we're on the plane um they had told me beforehand it was going to be a little humid I remember and I lived in Iowa young people as we are here in the pictures the together [Music] when you begin to know that person is a high school they're about to get their diploma and some were also working is switch [Music] came on every one of them is doing something during the service I think I noticed quite a bit and I want to go back a little um the first service which was on a Thursday I lost my voice pero [Music] song leading Peppa well God has prepared for us so what we need to do is begin to move what's hindering us and let God do the work [Music] as I was thinking about what's going on with my voice came to me and told me this is the moment I began to think other Brethren were treated us while we were there my mind is saying they don't even know me this way but they know who represents us a location yes we were speaking on Redemption the final plan would be for us to help our neighbors friend a brother and what came to mind and I'll leave you with this do you hear your brothers crying I want to tell you is do you hear your Brethren's cry now what are we going to do with it Joe the Joe [Applause] amenos God bless you brother uh pleasure to be here this morning I know I didn't dwell for a long time it was for about a week I'm a president who doesn't leave home too much or the state or city for me a little trip was long brother Eli said when I see every one of you is it feels like I hadn't seen you in a while it's a pleasure to be here before you this morning when you continue speaking on our missionary trip they told me to go in Spanish so I'm going to do my best being in Colombia I had no other options God was with us I was able to choose the correct words and I believe people received the message that I had was just not my message but the Lord Jesus Christ what helps quite a bit is the people get their in expectations you're going to feel like they're pulling something from you but they have a need I want to hear something and they're there uh waiting so that makes it a little easier to speak what we need to speak very beautiful trip of myself on Wednesday we got to the city of services we have services from that Wednesday to Sunday yeah that's when I was able to speak to more youth there in and I like that quite a bit something I was able to say is any of the youth there then have interested in English and learning English muchos Gustavo English everyone I would talk to tell me they liked English I would ask the same questions what do you like to learn English because when you like something it comes easier it's the same thing with the words if you like to follow God because of the love you have for him it'll become easier that was something that made an impact in myself many of them being there are very young there is my favorite brother Bernie message is this and that one yeah and they're giving me the want to learn more because they're they're young and they listen so much to brother Bernie I mean I want to make the effort to hear more of brother Bernie and more messages yes there's some of the pictures of the sisters that they sat in front of me yes and that's where I learned what our brothers and they begin to tell me the names of all the musicians and the brothers also the interpreters and sometimes the other brother they're able to see when the camera is on them and she told me yes in terms of services so they give me more interest to give all the information is [Music] [Music] [Music] it was a good time nombre everyone begin to introduce themselves it was their name what they do what they like and what's their interest but a part that I like very much so after that okay now what we're going to do uh um every person is going to share now what God has done in their life had a great testimony back to it was a very good trip for myself but I know it was for them as I told you I'm very I keep to myself but knowing that we had a goals the purpose why we're there is to take all my thoughts or feelings and do the work of God into this we try the best and made the effort take time with the youth another thing we did uh yes that was on on Monday now we're done with our services on Monday we had time to do something else the idea my uncle had is [Music] foreign I believe that was something very good for us we knew that they wanted to do something with them maybe push them a little more yes and that's something that I like very much on this tripado and with my brother also I was a little worried because of the weather is going to be very humidity and I've said in many occasions I don't like the humidity too much and as soon as we get off the plane humid it was there you don't even worry about it every service we believe would be outside oh we had a goal yes so they can continue the work experience I mean that was a great experience that's what I spoke on over there and I'll say it here is one of my pastor asked me the question if I wanted to go to Colombia is I said maybe one day I'll go on a missionary trip remember here I was sitting in the front when our pastor told us here tell your children to get their passports one day I'm going to ask them the questions I'm going to ask you if it's okay yes or no for your sons to go with me on a missionary trip I remember as I spoke over there in December I graduated in the University um yeah it's an internship an internship somewhere we got an internship into this uh foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Music] all right them when would you like me to start it doesn't mean we have two different dates where you can begin you can begin on the 6th of February this was the week that we're going to go to Columbia you can start on the 21st of February it will be the week that we got back after okay which would be this past Tuesday this Tuesday so I acted like I was thinking about it in my mind I already had the 25th yes I can't start on the six please I went to bed I went to my bed and I pray to God I know this is everything came out perfect plan I had time to go come back and get all the documents you gave me what I needed God bless you Menudo Salah I've always believed one thing that God has a plan and it's up to the parents talk to the parents to do their part I believe in God's plan uh take your seats and we cannot deviate from God's plan God knew from the beginning who he was going to commission who is going to anoint and those individuals sooner or later as the brother said it's going to click and click and I believe that with all my heart you got a lot of young people we're living in an age if we don't train our young people to understand that the beginners of this message I gotta go back and you need to understand but I have to go all the way back to Pablo Garcia Chavez senor I gotta go back because they opened the road was no one else then I have to look at the fact that brother Bernie G Garcia our pastors had a team and his team opened the path the door became wider in order for the future of his ministry continue in the field work and that's what we're doing it's not something that we have not our ministry but it's a continuation of the apostolic age we need to really understand the door was open the door has been closed what he's been doing if you want to believe it or not I gotta go back to 2008. where I sat down in my office of the old church I wrote down teams and we were Minute Men yeah we would go out and each person would have a song leader person that would be able to play an instrument to have the young people I did not have the young people on those teams uh he was eight years old let me put it again Joe was eight years old I have to go all the way back to 2008. was he part of the plan it's not my plan it's God's plan he knows who he's going to selected we just go with the goals the plan the plan that God has established and I'm going to tell you is it hard as parents yes it is it's hard to allow your son to go out the circumstance is the difficulties that he will have it's not easy they have to do what I do I get up early I can't sleep Guess what at a certain time they need to be up there having their breakfast and that's when it begins I told them what we were going to do it's a very hot and humid place and I'm going to tell you if you've ever been to the hottest place in your life I don't know what city that is that's very human we live in a dry Zone they there it's a wet sticky humid place this is a jungle was the jungle turned into a Town Pueblo there's a lot of mosquitoes there's a lot of animals there what you think yeah we have in the desert they have it there yeah so I'm going to tell you it was he first of all parents address your son your son's sequels did a fantastic work Fantastico the Bible says work they said and the works that they did it was not only for them but it was for those young people it is we are in charge of uh that church we're in charge of the church and I can't stop I will continue taking young people there because they need to hear the word of God first and foremost thing they need to hear the word of God they hear Brother Bernie they listen to us they know us however it has to be a personal revelation it has to be an experience a relationship between them and the Lord Jesus Christ now the question is when you have this type of setting were their baptisms John the Baptist where are you at how many did we baptize too was it a successful trip yes see yes it was because as they said we've never had that many young people and that's why I told them give them a little bit at a time once you give them a little at a time and that's what it is yes he is they want to hear more of the word of God somebody lost their voice well let me tell you um I love the kid I I love his ways but he talked too much it's very simple when you talk too much guess what you lose your voice not only that but I was told uh whenever it's hot put it this way we went from Bogota you go into a place that's humid and hot you don't wear shoes uh you think you're a big boy now yeah it does so you don't need shoes when you get up you're barefooted you know what's going to happen I don't have to tell you parents you're going to get sick you're going to lose your voice I didn't notice he lost his voice he was always having a good time that's nothing bad that's something good he was having such a good time he lost his voice did I know I wouldn't ever put him to direct the song service if I knew he had lost his voice I didn't notice it until all of a sudden I spoke on Sunday morning I heard somebody crying I go God good Thurman wasn't for people to start crying it was something for them to think about and I said well and I feel bad up to the day I feel right because he did lose his voice that he couldn't sing and that's when I started thinking about my friends they like to sing a lot that should have been there but sooner or later Jesus uh we'll get you but they want people the thing we don't do enough outside of praying foreign you are my heroines because all the girls were talking about they were all involved they wanted to hear more so I go back and when do I go back I laugh and the reason I laughed is I was looking at certain people no I like to look at people I'm not looking at you because there's something wrong uh yeah I think I'm gonna take so and so on and it wasn't that I like you or dislike it do me a favor you're a mother and father do me a favor take care of them let me say it again please take care of your son know his destination you didn't know when he was eight years old you didn't know when I knew Danny he had a diaper it wasn't uh God you know diapers fit firm Danny was three years old in a diaper when I first met dad did I know did he knows God has a plan and if you're in that plan you're not going to be able to get out of it those individuals that he thought of in his plan you are part of his plan if you like it or not you are part of the plan of the Lord Jesus Christ now what I want you to do is stand up okay because I wasn't going to take a lot of time you want to speak today I want you to hear the individuals that have been training sitting down hearing the word of God and what they've become okay and what they've become the future Generations [Music] they are our future and no matter what happens in the future is always going to have those individuals the role God has called them to to do if you have a desire you need prayer somebody needs prayer just raise your hands I'm not going to take too long our heavenly father we're
