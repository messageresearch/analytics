TRANSCRIPT
========================================
what do you say brother R well no wait a minute let's take Israel down in Egypt there come a time where God said I'm going to send the death angel through the land and I'm going to take every one of the Elders of the family unless there's blood on the door that great night of the Passover now's Israel a promised people going to a promised land and they it's a night of the Passover the death angel is in the land and we hear a scream coming from down the street we look out two big black wings are waving down the street you think Israel is all excited no sir death was at the door the little boy looked out the window he's the oldest of the family he sees that big black angel he looks and said daddy do you love me sure son I you well Daddy am I not your firstborn yes you are son look at there daddy that angel got that little boy I know him I played with him Oh Daddy here he comes toward but son you see on that door post Hallelujah daddy will get me no sure son he can't get you why that's his promise when I see the blood I'll pass over you go back and get your toys and start playing son there's no need to wearing we're in God's Refuge that all Ste foru Israel could sit back and read the Bible while the rest of them is screaming and Billy up steam Israel was relaxed why death right at the door what difference did it make it can't hurt them so when death comes to glory to God as long as God's requirement of blood's been placed on the L of my heart po what difference does it make it can't me the doctor says you're going to die tomorrow what difference does it make the blood is on the post you got to die anyhow but if that blood's been applied I've got a Resurrection coming amen amen Israel could be calm no building of steam for them because they know that the death angel couldn't strike them they were under the blood it was God's provided way now notice say can I be assured that our Christians here we are can I be assured of that I spoke on it last Sunday night now Israel was a promised Covenant people God's people they had been promised a land that was flowing with milk and honey so they uh they never seen that land not a one of them have ever been there but they had a promise of it they never been over there they didn't know nothing about the land but they were promised that land and they come out of their slavery by the hand of God to his prophet and was sojourning professing that they were pilgrims and strangers and was going to a land that they' never seen or none of them had ever seen it it so they come close to the borderline there was a great warrior among them named Joshua Joshua takes means Jehovah Savior and Joshua went over the Jordan into the promised land and come back was the evidence that it was a good land they brought a bunch of grapes and taken two men to pack it was just exactly what God said it was it was flooring milk and honey that should have made everyone of them rej josua brought back to evidence of a land that nobody know nothing about that God had promised to give them see because they were had a promise to land was on the road to it now one day the human race is in a trap and there comes someone to the Earth for the name of Jesus Christ Jesus means Jehovah savior and he went down to the J of death went over the Jorden in death and Rose up on Easter morning with the evidence that a man can live after he dies Hallelujah death is not the end Jesus proved that a man can live after he died he stood before him and he said before he left he said in my father's house is many manss it wasn't so I would have told you and I going and prepare place I'll go over and fix up a place and return back and receive you to myself that where I am there he may also after he died till the moon and stars and sun was ashamed of themselves he died till a Roman soldier pierced his heart with a with a spirit water and blood had separated he was the deadest of the Dead he went to the Grave like any man did his soul went to hell as the Bible said but on Easter morning he came back from Death hell and the grave and said I am he that was dead and I'm alive forever more and had the keys of death in hell I'm a man they said he's a spirit said give me a fish sandwich and eat fish and bread he was a man that died and went to the land and returned back with the evidence that a man can live after death what's death got to do with us hey man off the pressure not only that but he give us a promise what was it he give us the earnest of our inheritance he said now to prove this to every believer now you're walking down here in unbelief you don't believe the word you're walking in sin in the things of the world but he that believeth on me has eternal life notice now when we receive his Spirit we were once dead in sin and trespasses he gives us New Birth New Life what does he do he we die and are buried in Jesus amen we raise in the spirit from the worldly things onto the Heavenly things and tonight we are sitting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus how many Christians in here still love the world if you do you're are not a Christian you are a professor of Christianity and not a possessor amen for when I man wants Taste of Christ he's dead to the things of the world and by no means he has any desire go back what does it do the life Paul said that I once live I live no more yeah live not me but Christ in me he raised him from this low level of worldly sin up to a place that we ourselves can look back and see where we come from look back and see where we once lived now we live different what is it it's the assurance that we are dead and our lives are HID in Christ to God and are sealed by the Holy Ghost and raised above those things then we are a lie with the same evidence that he come back with to prove to us me I'm the land is glorious and this is a down payment this is the earnest of our Salvation it's the first money that holds the contract cont has everlasting life not come into condation but pass from Death onto life but off the pressure brother yes look as Elijah that great prophet a type of Christ Elijah the type of the church which a double potion of the Spirit come upon the prophet he walked to the jar one day a type of this day this government and things we have now you remember notice when Elijah following Elijah for a reason am where did he take him to Jordan up to the school of the prophets and down to Jordan Alan that's why he takes you through justification sanctification and doubt to receive life amen not to a denomination or some Creed but today to your spirit so you can be born again and Elijah Elijah struck that water walked across Jordan and Elisha followed him and when Elisha returned back to the land again on the other side he come back with a double potion we follow Jesus to his death burial and baptism death burial and Resurrection rather through baptism we believe in we're D to the things of the world confess that we're nothing baptized in his name buried with him in baptism raised with him in Resurrection our Spirits live up above the things of the world then we're in Christ now we got one potion when we return from across the death M of Jordan we'll have another potion the bodies that we now have with spirits that we have have the earnest the holy spirit that can't die because it's part of God bodies that we live in he eats my flesh and drinks my blood have everlasting life and I'll raise him up at the last what difference doesn't make atomic bombs or anything else let do of this one thing that we have eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord so why do we care about what the world's got to say why do we care about pressure don't make any difference to us why because we can let off the [Music] steam [Music] the world now with our heads bowed let's raise our [Music] hands [Music] [Music] our heavenly father Satan has lost the battle just be patient don't build up a steam standing here preaching on letting off the Steam and then Satan thought he could run me from the vit get me out of this alter call no Lord in my heart there was something burning saying there's somebody here there's somebody hunting for that rock we thank you Father for the victory when that last person walked to the altar the lights come on he's seen he lost might as well give up the stands tonight that number of Grace five precious

them from doing it every effort he could put forth he tried to do it but he lost now as your servant I'm going to lay my hands upon them and anounce your blessings God may it follow because if they

for you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ put ourselves together in your hands amen amen this as we're standing we'll be going to the scripture we'll be going to the Bas scripture which we have been reading we'll be reading Revelations 3:20 to 22 after that we'll be heading over to Romans 8:37 through 39 you look for it we always thank our pastor for his trust and the words reads thus behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will sub with him and he with me to him that overcome will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit sayth unto the churches we'll be heading over to Romans 8:37 says n all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come NE height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is Christ Jesus our lord yes this evening I know we're on the topic of how can I overcome and I'd like to add a small subtitle we more than Overcomers in Christ Jesus you may take your seats my brothers truly we've learned a lot from what we've been speaking on I'll try to speak a little bit tonight about death to bring it as simple as I can and also a bit about the benefits of an insurance policy how many insurance agents do we have here I'll ask you once again later on we know that there's many types of insurances and it's Fallen my law he has allowed I've gone through a lot of um lot lawsuits and I know a little bit about insurances and I can stay here all night talking about the all the lawsuits I've had but we know that God is in all things but I'm going to stay in one on one occasion I was the Headmaster for one of the companies that I worked for for one of the weekends I invited that same group to do the roofing on my house that was many years ago at the first hour one of my friends that accepted to go he went up he fell and he broke his hand now we reach an agreement that I would help him out because I believe God is a right to try to help him but either way he sued me so the house insurance did not cover [Music] that he got his lawyers I struggle to get a lawyer because no lawyer wants to take your case when there's no insurance company to back you up they're honest they say they were going after the bigger fish which is the insurance and through many references I was able to get a hold of one and he did represent me and we went to court and even my own lawyer told me we had about a 50% chance of winning can you imagine the hope that gave me that your own lawyer tells you you have a 50% chance of winning just but if they give us a tie and if the judge decides 5050 we still lose they have to give us 51 in order for us to win and by the grace of God that process went about two to three years they were trying to for close my house with the insurance they were trying to get money and for close my home and so for somebody that's something that cost you so much and they want to come and take it away from you so then things get complicated but God in the midst of the scene everything was able to be resolved they accused me that I had a company that I really did not have at that time but one of those things is what pushed me forward to start my small business and many times God works in different ways at the time we don't understand it but God is on the scene afterwards when we had our insurance on our small business another person fell once again it was about 3 feet tall there was no telling how he broke his foot but at this time we already had the right insurance and I was worried once again the insurance sent me a letter and the the insurance said Milton we're fighting for you so don't worry about it I asked them well what I have to do and they said well nothing he's like no we sent that letter to you so we're representing you in court so one can rest I feel the same way it's with Christ when we leave everything to him and we truly surrender to him it is God that is working with us amen but we have to surrender when somebody buys an insurance policy usually the one who buys it is not the beneficiary the beneficiary is the somebody else there has to be a testament it comes connected with the one who purchases the policy in The Testament you write down it's the car for so and so the furniture for the carpenter the house for sew and it's all written down in the deed no one can collect any of that until the one who wrote down the Testament until they pass away now why do I tell you this because of other legal issues this year I had to visit another lawyer but I'll share that with you on another [Music] occasion but what I did know is that I could create a testament or deep and I got a bit afraid because they started asking me some type of strange questions that's when one realizes that death is is real is when you die who do you want to have your body you want an autopsy and I was a bit afraid what does an opop have to do well just do whatever I was already there where do you want to be buried do you want them to send you back to your home country or you want it to be here so they could buy your pot of plot of land what do you want with your body do you want them to burn it or they wanted to leave it and I really just started to think there are questions that one does not want to hear another question they asked if you're in a vegetable state would you like your wife to pull the plug and asked well what if we're B in the vegetable State then we have to find other people so they can they can pull the plug on both of us so there are questions that make you think what do you want to do with your organs are you going to donate them no I'm not donating nothing because if I'm alive take me apart our brother our Apostle brother he tells us in these times when a wife or a husband when they begin to get sick brother Garcia says they already have a bride or a groom ready if the sick one goes and dies within weeks or within months they' already got married once again sometimes they count their chickens before their eggs hatch brother gcia says he is that the messenger maybe did not reach the seventh grade it wasn't a man with much education but he sat with great businessmen they would ask him why are you with businessman he says well I'm a businessman myself he says what do you sell he said assurance and he went to the dictionary says that insurance and Assurance is the same thing and they would ask him kind of company a Celestial company now question is how many insurance agents do we have with the celestial company here I have a quote here that I would like to share with all of you the message fellowship with God through reconciliation preach in 1956 0120 not too long ago an insurance agent was at my house nothing against insurance but he said Billy I want to sell you a policy I said I got insurance he know what I didn't have any insurance Earthly I said I got insurance my wife looked around asked me to say wait what's that said I have insurance he said Billy what kind of insurance you got I said insurance he said Blessed assurance Jesus is mine will four Taste Of Glory Divine ha of salvation purch of God born in his Spirit washed in his blood Billy he said Billy that's all right I recognize that says that's all right said but Billy that will not get you in the graveyard up here I said but it'll take me out brother I ain't worried about getting there I'm worried about getting out of there amen it's the main thing I'll get there somehow because of this Blessed assurance Jesus made the promise I believe it with all of my heart so are we worried about getting out of them we're all going to get there one way or another but we determine which way are we going to leave I'm going to try to explain how you get to be a beneficiary of a great policy which our Lord Jesus Christ has left for us [Music] we go to Hebrews 9:27 and as is disappointed unto men once to die but after this the Judgment it says that they die once and in judgment not that they're going to reincarnate into a bowl or a cow so Christ was once offered to Bear the sins of many so we want to stop there where it says the sins of many he was talking about a special group of people do you want to include yourself there I can include myself there Phoenix lith Phoenix Lighthouse is there the Rey's family put your last name esar [Music] family and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation and now we go to Romans 81 the odd thing is we go from the Bible from one place to another and all it all it all aligns perfectly and the Bible is written by many years apart it's not one that sat down and wrote it was many years of difference and it all aligns perfectly Romans 81 there is therefore no now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit the messenger says that condemnation means judgment and the other scripture says that we die once and then we go to judgment are you following along let's go to Romans 82 for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death here in Romans 82 we see that there are two laws it says the spirit of the law is the law of spirit of life in Jesus Christ had made me free from the law of sin and death not that it's going to liberate me it has already liberated me Romans 6:23 Romans 6:23 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord we see that there are wages for sin and the wages is death and it's applied to all human beings death but here is one law that comes to the Lord Jesus Christ that liberates us from the other law which is death says there's many people who are defeated and they Place themselves in the other law of death truly we were delivered from that death we are more than conquerors in Christ Jesus that law of death and sin it makes us depart from that departs away from us to understand a bit more we're going to go to Romans 66 knowing this that our old man is crucified with him so that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin do you notice something something in six that our old man is crucified with him we go to seven for he that is dead is freed from sin and eight now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him amen knowing that our old man was crucified with Christ we died with Christ condemned with Christ we were judged with Christ we're more than conquerors in Christ Jesus it says now we be dead with Christ We believe We Shall also live with him Amen brother says does that give me the right to do whatever I want no sir that shows that you're rejecting that perfect sacrifice we go to Romans 9 knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death had no more dominion over him so now if our lord Jesus he was resurrected from among the dead he no longer died likewise we die with him we resurrect with him we continue speaking on for that he died he died into sin once but that he liveth he liveth unto God he died one time one sacrifice one perfect sacrifice for all of us we include all of ourselves in that he died to the sin once for all for all and forever when many may say there's a PE there's a special people I believe with all of my heart that he is speaking to to all of us here what is the requirement my brother for the beneficiary of that great policy he says not going according to the flesh it's one of the parts where we struggle the most Romans 81 once again now there for now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit that is the requirement that I find here it's the only requirement not going after the flesh it's one of the things that we struggle with the most that's why the Apostle Paul would say that I Die daily this flesh sometimes wants to get out of control it doesn't not it doesn't want to surrender so then we say sometimes we leave Jesus and we say why can't Jesus overcome within us brother Garcia says because we have left him we cannot overcome if we've left Jesus behind I'm going to read one more scripture it's going to be Jeremiah 156 thou Hast forsaken me sayth the Lord thou are gone backward therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee and Destroy Thee I am weary with repenting when brother Garcia says when have we left Jesus when we yelled our parents when you're disrespectful to your wife when you're disrespectful towards your pastor when you speak ill of someone else when you're disrespectful to your brother when you yell at your wife or your husband he says those and those little things we have left Jesus it's not the great things amen Brothers when you're disrespectful you know how you spoke to them the husband the wife knows how she spoke to the husband when there's something that tells you in your heart that you were wrong that's the uh the warning that God has given us it's not the great things it's the small things and if we could just wake up and we go back where we have left him there he is waiting for us and we have to make amends quickly so he can come inside of us can be Christ Jesus overcoming within us now we have F we have mended things that we made and we continue moving forward and it's Jesus overcoming within us amen Brothers this what makes us creators of this great policy and not only uh deliberates us from judgment or death when the Lord took everything to the Cross he took illnesses as well he took pain he took shame he took um he took slavery he took the vi addictions problems and anguish he took everything but what do we have to do not walk according to the flesh that's the requirement he asked to walk after the spirit May the musicians can please come forth you have forsaken me says the Lord and we know where we have left them behind as we are we'll be praying oh our lord Jesus Heavenly Father how good you are with us knowing that there was no hope for us yet you there for us father and sometimes in the small things that go over our heads and that's where we have left you father help us continue moving forward help us surrender more to thee Lord because you know all of the hearts father you know what we're struggling with we have to surrender ourselves more to thee if one of my brothers here this evening he knows what he's struggling with may he recognize that you already died once and for all and that makes us creators those great benefits of that great policy it's as if we really realized that there in the state of Arizona there are rich people who are and you are more than that if only we could realize uh help us surrender to continue moving forward help our invisible audience put ourselves all together in your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen [Music] for [Music] oh me [Music] be [Music]
