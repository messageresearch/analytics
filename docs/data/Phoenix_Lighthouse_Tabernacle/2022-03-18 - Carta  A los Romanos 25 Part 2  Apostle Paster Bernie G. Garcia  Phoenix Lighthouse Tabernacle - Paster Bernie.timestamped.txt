[15:24] better right
[15:51] there's several messages that the
[15:52] prophet talks about
[15:58] and one of them in particular is the
[16:00] masterpiece
[16:06] and you know how it is that god created
[16:08] man in his image
[16:12] that what man was god's masterpiece

[16:47] because it's mine
[16:52] when we hear the message
[16:54] hearing the tapes
[16:56] uh
[16:59] we see certain things that brother
[17:00] bradham taught
[17:09] one of the things is that masterpiece
[17:12] came through four stages
[17:44] a
[18:41] 37 and 3
[18:43] it is
[18:46] israel this is israel jacob
[18:49] is
[19:00] now israel loved joseph more than all
[19:02] his children because he was the son of
[19:05] his old age and he made him a coat of
[19:07] many colors
[19:11] how many sons does jacob or israel have
[19:15] that had 12.
[19:20] whom did he love the most
[19:50] of many colors
[19:59] these different colors they all contain
[20:01] the colors of the rainbow

[20:16] what this code of many colors is
[20:42] open up your bibles to the book of
[20:43] judges

[21:37] have they not divided the prey to every
[21:39] man a damsel or two

[22:19] the
[22:20] clothing of diverse colors
[22:23] is both for the head oh or for the the
[22:26] head man
[22:35] that's why when the israel will dress
[22:37] joseph with the code of many colors
[22:40] he loved him
[22:48] and he placed him as a head the head man
[22:50] over the rest of his brothers

[39:31] let us read it
[40:21] let's look at daniel 7 and verse 9.
[40:35] olympia
[40:40] i'd be held till the thrones were cast
[40:42] down and the ancient of days did sit
[40:44] whose garment was white as snow and the
[40:47] hair of his head like the pure wool his
[40:50] throne was like the fiery flame and his
[40:52] wheels as burning fire

[44:34] is
[44:46] to behave like a daughter of a kid
