[0:05] didn't there wasn't nothing but himself
[0:08] he was
[0:13] self-existence nothing else existed but
[0:18] God but being that he was
[0:22] God then there must be something to
[0:25] worship him because he loved
[0:28] worship
[0:34] and his own being created creatures to
[0:39] worship
[0:43] Him Now temporarily let's hit it
[0:50] again temporarily now we won't go
[0:53] through the whole thing but you get it
[0:54] on the
[0:58] tapes
[1:01] but then because that he was God he made
[1:03] angels and Angels worshiped
[1:10] him angs still worship Him
[1:15] amen while the angels are stand in the
[1:17] presence of God has six sets of wings
[1:20] six
[1:26] wings they car two over their face two
[1:28] over their feet and fly with in his
[1:30] presence crying day and night holy holy
[1:33] holy Lord God
[1:44] Almighty that's what the scripture
[1:48] said they worshiped
[1:51] him now that created something to
[1:55] worship
[1:58] him that is inside of him was an
[2:02] attribute of
[2:10] Savior how could one of those creatures
[2:13] when there was no sin or no thoughts of
[2:15] sin how one them be
[2:24] lost it couldn't be so there had to be
[2:28] something made could be lost so that he
[2:31] could be a
[2:38] savior inside of him a
[2:41] Healer do you believe he's a
[2:45] savior you believe he's a
[2:48] Healer but what if there wasn't nothing
[2:50] to save or
[2:54] heal see there had to be something made
[2:58] that way
[3:02] so he never made it that
[3:05] way but he put man on freeo
[3:12] agency if you take this you live if you
[3:15] take that you
[3:20] die and every man that comes into the
[3:23] world is still set for the same
[3:28] thing
[3:30] God by his for knowledge knew who would
[3:32] and who would
[3:38] not if God
[3:40] being the question was asked yesterday
[3:43] by a theologian to me that's been
[3:46] tending the meetings you're hearing the
[3:54] tapes said one
[3:58] question
[4:00] he said then is God
[4:06] om then he said he can be
[4:12] everywhere I said he is not omin in the
[4:16] way that the word speaks omin
[4:22] present he cannot be a being and then be
[4:25] an ominent
[4:28] present
[4:30] if he's omnes why would you pray for the
[4:32] Holy
[4:37] Spirit he's on the present he feels
[4:40] every crack Corner crevice every cell
[4:43] fiber everything else there
[4:52] is why did he hunt for Moses if he's
[4:55] Arin present at the
[4:58] end
[5:02] for why did he run up down the Garden of
[5:05] Eden crying Adam Adam where
[5:17] th he's omn because he's omn
[5:25] Mission he knows everything because
[5:29] because he's
[5:33] infinite being infinite makes him omin
[5:39] pres being then being
[5:46] infin then he sets in the heavens he
[5:49] abides in a place because he is a
[5:56] being but being infinite then he knows
[5:59] all
[6:03] things knowing every time that BS
[6:09] it know every bumblebee where he goes
[6:11] into the cone to get his
[6:17] honey he knows every thats in
[6:22] the he knows every thought that's in
[6:25] your mind because he is
[6:28] infinite
[6:37] Anin that is he not only is he infinite
[6:41] he's ominent Mission he knows
[6:48] everything but he is a being God is a
[6:55] being and out of this being begin to
[6:58] bring forth
[7:02] and sin I said the other night Sin is
[7:06] not a
[7:12] creation there is nothing created but
[7:18] Perfection God created all things
[7:22] good sin is not a
[7:26] creation said well that's a very
[7:28] creation sin you've heard
[7:34] that but that's an
[7:37] error sin there's only one Creator
[7:40] that's
[7:43] God God could not create sin because he
[7:46] holy and there's nothing to make
[7:55] it sin is
[7:58] perversion
[8:00] not creation but it's
[8:05] perversion an adultery is the righteous
[8:08] act
[8:12] perverted a lie is the truth
[8:20] wrong
[8:22] any any sin is righteousness
[8:28] perverted
[8:30] therefore now God
[8:34] sets he's already manifested himself
[8:37] he's
[8:43] God he's already manifested himself as a
[8:50] savior man was lost and he saved
[8:54] him he's already manifested himself as a
[8:58] Healer
[9:01] there's L people say he is and he is
[9:03] anyhow just the
[9:11] same he's a Healer he's a savior he's
[9:15] God he's
[9:22] Eternal and he has a purpose and his
[9:25] purpose was in the beginning to make
[9:28] creatures that would love him and
[9:31] worship
[9:38] him and he made creatures and creatures
[9:41] fell and then God by his infancy looked
[9:46] down through the stream of time and saw
[9:48] every man that would be
[9:50] saved
[9:58] amen
[10:01] every man he knew it by by
[10:08] knowledge therefore if he by for
[10:11] knowledge knew who would be saved and
[10:14] who would not be saved he could
[10:25] predestinate amen so the word's not such
[10:28] a bad word after all
[10:35] isn't he could predestinate because he
[10:38] knew who would and who would
[10:44] not therefore in order to catch those
[10:47] who
[10:48] would he had to make a a propitiation
[10:51] for their
[10:58] sins
[11:00] oh if we can we only to get to it just a
[11:04] few verses
[11:10] below he
[11:12] predestinated us to eternal
[11:16] life knowing at those you would lay
[11:19] aside
[11:23] everything and no matter how indifferent
[11:27] it would look towards the children of
[11:28] the world it wouldn't mean one thing to
[11:31] them because they were children of
[11:43] God and he called
[11:46] them and He sent Jesus that his blood
[11:51] might be an atonement blood
[11:57] at
[12:02] a propitiation are a exceptions are a
[12:11] cleansing a cing process
[12:21] toly not just one time and one Revival
[12:25] but ever
[12:27] living making intercessions that the
[12:31] Christian is kept clean day and night
[12:46] amen there is a blood of Jesus Christ
[12:49] that makes an exception on the cross
[12:57] there in the presence of God that
[13:00] cleanses us constantly day and night
[13:04] from all sins
[13:11] and and we are
[13:15] safely tued
[13:19] in tued
[13:22] in by the Holy Spirit into the body of
[13:26] the Lord Jesus and
[13:31] [Music]
[13:33] save he he my words and believeth on him
[13:36] had sent me has everlasting life and
[13:39] shall never come into the Judgment but
[13:42] has passed from Death unto
[13:53] life no more
[13:57] judgment the Christian never goes to the
[14:02] Judgment Christ went for
[14:05] him my attorney stood in my
[14:11] place he pleaded my case and I was
[14:19] ignorant he told the father that I
[14:21] wasn't worthy I
[14:27] was me and he took my place and pleaded
[14:31] my case and today I'm
[14:39] free
[14:41] yes and he shed his blood offer there
[14:45] for our
[14:46] [Music]
[14:50] sins remember last Wednesday night no
[14:54] Christian Christian
[14:56] sins but a sinner cannot
[15:08] a sinner doesn't sin because he's a
[15:14] sinner he's just a sinner to begin with
[15:17] and that's
[15:21] all here take the the back of this book
[15:24] it's
[15:27] black
[15:29] how much of that is black it's all
[15:34] black did just know white to it's
[15:39] black you said this much here it's the
[15:42] whole thing's black it's all
[15:49] black that's way a
[15:52] is he just condemned to start
[15:57] with
[15:59] well he say what about if he commits
[16:03] adulter what if Hees
[16:07] woman what
[16:11] what what if he shoot
[16:14] somebody that's not of our
[16:18] business that's not of our business we
[16:21] got laws down here take care of
[16:26] that we're not ref s we're preachers of
[16:30] the
[16:35] Gospel we don't condemn him for what he
[16:39] done we don't condemn him for committing
[16:44] adultery we condemn him because he's a
[16:51] sinner a Christian he wouldn't do
[16:56] it that's right cor if he's been changed
[17:00] he won't do
[17:03] that but because he is a sinner that's
[17:06] what makes him do
[17:12] that that's what knocks the props out
[17:15] under
[17:21] legalist yes sir brother let me tell you
[17:24] it's not by works but by grace are we
[17:26] saved and not by faith
[17:37] don't condemn legalist they're my
[17:44] brother they'll be there just the same
[17:46] as the rest of them will be there cause
[17:48] God's for our D his church to be
[17:57] there
[17:59] but just the thing you keep the people
[18:01] so tore up they don't know

[18:15] hunger the world are not there to begin
[18:23] with I don't live true to my life
[18:26] because I think she divorce me

[18:38] her it's a legal position that we have
[18:42] taken that we love one
[18:48] another first before it could be there
[18:50] it had to be a
[18:55] love I love her
[18:58] although I believe if I done something
[19:00] wrong she'd forgive me still I wouldn't
[19:02] do it
[19:03] anyhow I love
[19:11] her that's way it is with
[19:14] Christ if I if I live uh I'm 50 if I

[19:43] anything I ever couldn't do did do or
[19:45] anything

[58:09] amen God bless each one of
[58:13] you before anything let us open up the
[58:17] word contining with the same
[58:22] topic which our pastor established this
[58:28] year we're going to the base scripture
[58:30] which is Genesis
[58:32] [Music]
[58:36] 1:1 Genesis
[58:39] 1 I'm giving you some time so you can
[58:41] look for
[58:43] it and the word of God reads
[58:48] thus in the beginning God created the
[58:51] Heaven and the
[58:53] Earth
[59:00] [Music]
[59:02] and the Earth was without form and void
[59:04] and darkness was upon the face of the
[59:06] deep and the spirit of God moved upon
[59:07] the face of the
[59:11] waters and God said let there be light
[59:13] and there was
[59:16] [Music]
[59:18] light and God saw the light that it was
[59:20] good and God divided the light from the
[59:23] darkness
[59:30] and God called the light day and the
[59:32] Darkness he called night in the evening
[59:34] and the morning were the first
[59:39] [Music]
[59:40] day now be so kind we'll be reading the
[59:43] scripture in Isaiah
[59:46] [Music]
[59:48] 55 we're going for to verse
[59:52] eight it's also a very beautiful
[1:00:00] scripture Isaiah 558 reads the following
[1:00:11] way for my thoughts are not your
[1:00:13] thoughts neither are your ways my ways
[1:00:15] sayth the
[1:00:23] Lord
[1:00:27] for as the heavens are higher than the
[1:00:28] earth so are my ways higher than your
[1:00:30] ways and my thoughts than your
[1:00:42] [Music]
[1:00:44] thoughts for as the rain cometh down and
[1:00:47] the snow from heaven and return it not
[1:00:49] thither but WTH the Earth and make it
[1:00:51] bring forth and Bud that it may give
[1:00:53] seed to the sour and the bread so to and
[1:00:55] bread to the
[1:01:07] eater so shall my word be that goeth
[1:01:10] forth out of my mouth it shall not
[1:01:11] return unto me void but it shall
[1:01:13] accomplish that which I please and it
[1:01:15] shall prosper in the thing where to I
[1:01:16] sent
[1:01:18] it may God bless the reading of his
[1:01:21] word so kind
[1:01:23] of as you sit down please greet your
[1:01:29] smile give him a great big
[1:01:35] smile exercise your face
[1:01:42] muscles let the hormone and the
[1:01:44] chemicals of Happiness bring forth
[1:01:46] through your
[1:01:48] [Music]
[1:01:51] face brother right now I'm not really in
[1:01:53] the mood I don't want to smile
[1:01:56] that's when you should make an effort
[1:01:57] even more to make the
[1:02:03] effort to allow that God through the
[1:02:05] perfect body with he
[1:02:08] created he can manifest what God is
[1:02:10] inside of us amen
[1:02:15] amen thank God for the opportunity G us
[1:02:17] to be here this
[1:02:20] morning I'd like to thank our pastor for
[1:02:22] the
[1:02:23] opportunity his
[1:02:27] trust which he gives us to be able to
[1:02:29] express a little bit of what's in our
[1:02:32] heart I always say and I always mention
[1:02:36] it let us always be praying for our
[1:02:41] pastor time I'm behind I repeat
[1:02:44] it because something that's very
[1:02:49] important that us as members of this
[1:02:53] church
[1:02:55] always supporting our pastor in
[1:02:58] prayer brother Bram always
[1:03:00] said if somebody needs prayer it is
[1:03:05] me so let us always be grateful with
[1:03:09] God for having the pastor that we
[1:03:12] have and always uplifting him in
[1:03:15] prayer so wherever that he may be wher
[1:03:19] he
[1:03:20] goes he begins to preach the go
[1:03:24] May the Holy Spirit come down and
[1:03:26] fulfill the
[1:03:28] purpose that he has for the people
[1:03:30] wherever he
[1:03:32] goes so we always have to be praying for
[1:03:34] our pastor
[1:03:35] [Music]
[1:03:37] amen and let's continue with the topic
[1:03:42] that the spoken word is the Original
[1:03:46] [Music]
[1:03:48] Seed it's a very beautiful and extensive
[1:03:52] topic can be taken from different
[1:03:59] angles now there's been several brothers
[1:04:01] who have expressed their thoughts on
[1:04:02] this
[1:04:05] topic they have been expressing what God
[1:04:07] has given
[1:04:09] them and I think we have received a
[1:04:11] great
[1:04:13] blessing they have done it in quite a
[1:04:15] Mastery
[1:04:16] way being a
[1:04:18] blessing for each one of
[1:04:23] us
[1:04:24] but the word tell us that we're not only
[1:04:25] to be listeners but
[1:04:28] doers but there is where the
[1:04:34] key we can take the word that's been
[1:04:36] spoken unto
[1:04:44] us and not just take it as a message
[1:04:47] that our brother spoke onto us and he
[1:04:48] spoke it
[1:04:49] well we liked what he spoke
[1:04:53] on
[1:04:55] that's something that the word tells us
[1:04:57] is
[1:04:59] sweet it's sweet in our palet
[1:05:05] mouth but the scripture is not fulfilled
[1:05:07] un which we move forward with the
[1:05:09] rest when it starts to make your belly
[1:05:12] big that's when that sweet word which we
[1:05:15] heard we have to put it into action and
[1:05:19] that's where it causes
[1:05:20] bitterness and that's where we don't
[1:05:22] like it that's where it
[1:05:26] hurts Isaiah
[1:05:29] 55 my thoughts are not your
[1:05:33] thoughts neither are your ways my
[1:05:37] ways so then we go to Genesis
[1:05:42] one in the beginning God created the
[1:05:44] Heaven and the
[1:05:46] Earth God was expressing his
[1:05:50] thoughts when he began the creative
[1:05:53] process
[1:05:57] that he
[1:06:00] had in the beginning God created
[1:06:06] the
[1:06:09] be there was a word to express them his
[1:06:14] thoughts you
[1:06:16] can't unless you
[1:06:20] speak so
[1:06:23] godess
[1:06:25] it's the spoken
[1:06:27] word the spoken
[1:06:31] word being the great
[1:06:34] eloh self
[1:06:36] exist the self-existing
[1:06:39] one who takes up all
[1:06:44] space had within him all of
[1:06:47] these that's why Isaiah told
[1:06:49] us my
[1:06:51] thoughts are higher
[1:06:56] be compared
[1:06:58] to but God in
[1:07:01] his Desir for God
[1:07:04] thought to be able to bepress and
[1:07:08] understood they could be
[1:07:11] reveal could leave his
[1:07:15] thoughts nobody have
[1:07:17] ACC in order to
[1:07:20] that so he began to
[1:07:22] unravel
[1:07:25] he began to unravel
[1:07:28] himself and he began to develop his
[1:07:32] plan that's why in the
[1:07:35] beginning created the Heaven and the
[1:07:39] Earth and the Earth was without form
[1:07:43] and and the Darkness was upon the face
[1:07:46] of and the spirit of God was
[1:07:52] moving what is it that the spirit of God
[1:07:54] was
[1:07:55] doing it began to
[1:07:59] move the space which it belonged to
[1:08:04] him he began to speak the vision that he
[1:08:07] had in
[1:08:10] his but in order to be able to speak he
[1:08:12] had to come
[1:08:17] down because God as Elohim he was
[1:08:22] invisible
[1:08:24] of God had to come forth which word the
[1:08:27] anointed the the
[1:08:31] son he was the one who began
[1:08:33] topress what was God's
[1:08:35] plan God's
[1:08:37] thoughts and through the
[1:08:40] word the thoughts
[1:08:44] Express and then the thoughts have to be
[1:08:47] materialized so then
[1:08:50] God when he began
[1:08:52] to he saw the condition
[1:08:56] of he begin to analyze the
[1:09:01] situation first analyzed the condition
[1:09:03] which the
[1:09:04] Earth and when he
[1:09:07] analyzed said the Earth is without form
[1:09:09] and
[1:09:10] void so then comes the
[1:09:14] Revelation the prophet messenger comes
[1:09:16] and speaks to us and he says that
[1:09:20] God he was
[1:09:22] moving
[1:09:26] he says as something flying like perhaps
[1:09:27] a
[1:09:31] hen how it lies down to have the correct
[1:09:34] atmosphere so that the sea
[1:09:37] that can come to
[1:09:42] manifestation when it has those
[1:09:44] hatchlings that are still in their sh it
[1:09:47] begins to
[1:09:49] um that through the
[1:09:52] process they can come to
[1:09:57] manifestation and so the prophet says
[1:09:59] that God was doing
[1:10:00] the he was analyzing the
[1:10:04] situation he saw the Earth was without
[1:10:06] form and
[1:10:07] void he saw that there was
[1:10:10] Darkness but under that
[1:10:13] Darkness under
[1:10:15] that there was a
[1:10:17] SE so
[1:10:19] him he began to
[1:10:22] analyze and he saw that that seed had
[1:10:26] value he analyed the
[1:10:30] situation he saw the situation which the
[1:10:32] SE found
[1:10:33] himself so then
[1:10:37] now he began to analyze the value of the
[1:10:41] seat so he loved the seat so
[1:10:45] much he began to move upon the face
[1:10:49] of to create the correct
[1:10:52] atmosphere when the word was
[1:10:55] spoken it would create
[1:10:59] the it would bring to manifest the seed
[1:11:02] of
[1:11:04] God that was the analysis that God
[1:11:07] made that there was
[1:11:10] seed the condition which the seed found
[1:11:12] itself
[1:11:14] in then he saw the value of the
[1:11:20] seed the seed has value it has so much
[1:11:26] value just the way as a bird stays in
[1:11:28] its
[1:11:29] nest it could be
[1:11:34] raining Thunder it could be
[1:11:36] windy it could be the
[1:11:40] storm but that bird will not move
[1:11:43] for because there's a love
[1:11:47] relationship creating the appropriate
[1:11:52] atmosphere those can come into
[1:11:55] manifestation if that
[1:11:58] bird doesn't create the
[1:12:01] atmosphere that seed can't come
[1:12:04] forth it loves that seed that bird loves
[1:12:06] the SE so that the storms
[1:12:10] don't
[1:12:11] situation it's going to stay
[1:12:14] there the seed comes to
[1:12:18] manifestation until those hatchlings can
[1:12:20] come out of their
[1:12:22] shell the plan that
[1:12:24] was he was analy the
[1:12:27] situation situation
[1:12:30] of the
[1:12:33] atmosphere analing the value of the he
[1:12:36] said I stay
[1:12:37] here I'm going to move upon the I'm
[1:12:40] going to create the correct
[1:12:44] atmosphere because I love what
[1:12:46] I it's a love
[1:12:49] relationship I love what I'm seeing I'm
[1:12:52] going to express
[1:12:54] spoken
[1:12:55] word going to finish with
[1:12:58] the I'm going to get rid
[1:13:00] of
[1:13:06] get through my
[1:13:08] word will become
[1:13:12] materialized and that's the process that
[1:13:18] God says my thoughts
[1:13:22] areer focuses
[1:13:25] on when we're looking at
[1:13:27] Genesis we read the
[1:13:30] word we say the Earth was
[1:13:34] without there was
[1:13:37] Darkness but when God SE
[1:13:39] that he's looking at the
[1:13:42] sea looking at the
[1:13:44] circumstan he's looking at a
[1:13:47] sea that has the power
[1:13:49] within to begin to reproduce it has a
[1:13:53] system
[1:13:54] it has a
[1:13:56] system
[1:14:00] Force according to
[1:14:02] it be an atmosphere created an
[1:14:05] appropriate atmosphere so that I can be
[1:14:12] born so the thoughts of God the ways of
[1:14:16] God they are
[1:14:22] higher
[1:14:24] and you can't walk higher than your
[1:14:27] thoughts and you can't
[1:14:29] think
[1:14:33] higher than what God has
[1:14:38] expressed you can't think higher of what
[1:14:40] you
[1:14:42] speak and you can't speak higher than
[1:14:45] that what you think and you can't
[1:14:48] walk and higher than what you think or
[1:14:50] what you your confession
[1:14:56] limit the spiritual condition in which
[1:14:57] you find
[1:14:58] yourself your
[1:15:01] thoughts they limit you to live in a
[1:15:03] certain
[1:15:07] atmosphere my thoughts are not your
[1:15:12] thoughts because our thoughts lead us to
[1:15:14] have a certain
[1:15:15] perception a way of looking
[1:15:18] at a way of
[1:15:22] understanding
[1:15:24] when Lord Jesus Christ spoke with
[1:15:27] Nicodemus he says is you must be born
[1:15:33] again you must be born
[1:15:36] again Nicodemus could not
[1:15:39] understand the revelation of the
[1:15:41] thoughts of
[1:15:43] God for the age in which he
[1:15:46] lived because God's thoughts are
[1:15:50] higher than the thoughts of any human
[1:15:52] being
[1:15:54] but God in his
[1:15:56] plan he desired to
[1:15:58] unravel so
[1:16:01] that you could enter into God's program
[1:16:04] in God's
[1:16:07] plan could have access to the hidden
[1:16:09] thoughts of
[1:16:11] God because God hid them
[1:16:14] INR he was the anointed one he was
[1:16:18] the the thoughts of
[1:16:20] God were hidden inside
[1:16:24] they couldn't be
[1:16:25] revealed until a certain time when they
[1:16:28] were
[1:16:32] expressed so then
[1:16:37] us we have to understand the way God did
[1:16:41] things how he did
[1:16:44] it because that's an example for
[1:16:47] us when in a
[1:16:52] situation a situation which we
[1:16:55] find we have to find the
[1:16:57] value not look at
[1:17:04] the at the value inside of the
[1:17:06] circum because in that disorder in that
[1:17:10] voice below them is the
[1:17:13] seed the seed has a value so then
[1:17:18] Christ unraveling God's plan that's why
[1:17:22] the prophet said
[1:17:24] Christ is
[1:17:27] the thoughts of God in
[1:17:29] Christ in the heart
[1:17:31] of they have to be
[1:17:33] spoken
[1:17:36] reation contact
[1:17:38] with and the hidden Mystery
[1:17:41] can and be revealed in our lives but
[1:17:46] that happens while the Earth is without
[1:17:50] form that's where the
[1:17:52] process
[1:17:54] the developing of God's
[1:17:57] thoughts where we have to
[1:17:59] enter in the presence of
[1:18:01] God to be able to activate his
[1:18:06] power activate the power that's inside
[1:18:08] of
[1:18:10] us understand and analyze the
[1:18:13] sit and see the value that God is
[1:18:17] seing at
[1:18:18] the
[1:18:21] problem the
[1:18:23] ill because God is not looking at that
[1:18:27] God's not
[1:18:30] seeing of the sea that's
[1:18:32] behind there's value in that
[1:18:35] se because
[1:18:37] God like our
[1:18:42] thoughts they're
[1:18:48] higher so
[1:18:51] then God
[1:18:57] he began to unravel his
[1:19:00] plan the messenger
[1:19:04] says in the message of the sman
[1:19:09] age the Eternal thoughts of
[1:19:13] God allow me to ask
[1:19:17] you are God's thoughts
[1:19:20] Eternal are they eternal
[1:19:24] if you can see
[1:19:26] this then you will
[1:19:28] understand many
[1:19:31] things God is
[1:19:34] uncountable so much in his Essence as in
[1:19:37] his
[1:19:39] Mo God is infinite in his
[1:19:41] abilities for
[1:19:43] so he has to be
[1:19:45] omnicient if he is
[1:19:48] omnicient then he is not
[1:19:51] learning neither is he taking advice
[1:19:54] from
[1:19:56] anyone and he knows the beginning just
[1:19:58] like the end because he is God
[1:20:03] for God's thoughts are Eternal they are
[1:20:08] real they're not like the thoughts of
[1:20:11] man we can go out throughout the
[1:20:14] ages we see we
[1:20:16] findes find
[1:20:18] Jeremiah find John the Baptist each one
[1:20:22] of them
[1:20:24] they were the thought of
[1:20:26] God expressed in their
[1:20:29] time those
[1:20:31] prophets were the thought of
[1:20:34] God expressed at a
[1:20:38] certain that existed in their it was
[1:20:43] limited by the word that had
[1:20:46] been through God's mouthpiece at that
[1:20:49] time Moses
[1:20:51] spoke he brought a
[1:20:54] revelation he brought
[1:20:56] Deliverance he took them to a land he
[1:20:59] was guiding
[1:21:00] them the promise
[1:21:02] that was the time for of the people
[1:21:07] of Revelation came for that
[1:21:10] time the
[1:21:17] of God's thoughts to the
[1:21:19] people it was the time for Del didn't
[1:21:23] matter it didn't
[1:21:26] matter how powerful the
[1:21:28] country how powerful that
[1:21:31] Nation how great their army
[1:21:34] was God had already prepar a man he
[1:21:37] would
[1:21:39] come to express God's
[1:21:43] thoughts
[1:21:45] those spoken
[1:21:47] word you bring the
[1:21:51] deliver it was the revelation
[1:22:01] began to speak
[1:22:03] them his
[1:22:05] thoughts God once again analiz the
[1:22:11] situation of the people had reached his
[1:22:16] pres matter how
[1:22:20] strong H was the value of
[1:22:25] the presence of God sent him a
[1:22:28] deliverer an Escape
[1:22:32] Route once again
[1:22:35] analyed the Earth was
[1:22:37] without people of God
[1:22:39] were they were in
[1:22:41] dark heart
[1:22:45] were uh being enslaved was killing their
[1:22:48] Spirit but
[1:22:50] God was watching
[1:22:53] he was see the
[1:22:54] value in the midst of that chaos so
[1:22:58] then spoke the
[1:23:00] word
[1:23:03] man what had been promised for that
[1:23:07] time when they were in
[1:23:11] anguish when the people were
[1:23:14] trapped when the sea was in front
[1:23:17] of army was
[1:23:19] behind there
[1:23:21] was
[1:23:23] but there
[1:23:24] God brought his plan he toldes say why
[1:23:29] cry unto speak
[1:23:32] speak so that these
[1:23:34] people can cross
[1:23:37] and again the god thoughts of
[1:23:40] God God opened a
[1:23:43] way that the seed was
[1:23:46] valuable wasable it had
[1:23:49] value the
[1:23:51] ensl
[1:23:53] had Bound
[1:23:56] for come down to deliver people and he
[1:23:59] sent
[1:24:06] Moses so the prophet say in the age of
[1:24:11] Smyrna so then we get to Jesus the
[1:24:18] logus he was the complete thought
[1:24:21] expressed
[1:24:24] Jesus he was
[1:24:27] the perfect thought
[1:24:31] expressed and he was known as the word
[1:24:35] he was the Jesus Christ The Original
[1:24:39] Seed he was the
[1:24:43] promised he the one that all the
[1:24:44] prophets had seen God himself brother
[1:24:48] Bram
[1:24:50] says so now we're reaching in this
[1:24:53] conclusion how
[1:24:55] theog the
[1:24:57] word god
[1:24:59] Eternal was manifested in his
[1:25:04] son J Christ dwelt all the planet all
[1:25:07] the
[1:25:10] fullness the Eternal
[1:25:12] being the father manifested in
[1:25:16] flesh now it was God coming down once
[1:25:21] again not only did he want to express
[1:25:23] part of what
[1:25:24] he he wanted to express all of his
[1:25:28] thoughts this was a love
[1:25:32] relationship God wanted to manifest his
[1:25:36] love to be able to
[1:25:39] display that
[1:25:41] promise to the SE that he
[1:25:45] loved so he came to manifest himself in
[1:25:48] flesh according to his
[1:25:51] plan according to his
[1:25:54] plan the Lamb of God had to
[1:25:57] come because we were
[1:26:01] lost we were far away from
[1:26:04] God so then throughout
[1:26:07] time the Lord Jesus Christ came
[1:26:11] to it was the
[1:26:13] time the greatest manifestation in
[1:26:15] history God himself came
[1:26:19] down the perfect thought
[1:26:23] the anointed one God
[1:26:27] made now he was expressing
[1:26:32] God's because it was God himself in
[1:26:36] flesh in a
[1:26:39] fellowship it was no longer a Divine
[1:26:42] Fellowship now he came to bring theh to
[1:26:46] a fellowship in flesh to be able to
[1:26:49] unite the Earth with heaven
[1:26:53] to be able to unite flesh with to be
[1:26:56] open
[1:26:57] way there no longer
[1:27:00] one one have
[1:27:03] access but through
[1:27:05] death of the Original
[1:27:07] Seed who would die and come to
[1:27:10] land but it would bring many
[1:27:13] fruits the only begotten Son of
[1:27:16] God come to be sacrif to be
[1:27:20] crucified and as he
[1:27:23] he would he would
[1:27:25] resurrect after
[1:27:28] Resurrection he would disperse in the
[1:27:31] SE the seed which he was looking for
[1:27:35] because the son
[1:27:37] of come and save that
[1:27:39] which now would be
[1:27:42] shared even though it be
[1:27:44] dis it would not lose
[1:27:47] it not
[1:27:48] lose it way
[1:27:51] or
[1:27:53] now the power be shared among many
[1:27:55] members now that power that
[1:27:59] Spirit to bring the
[1:28:02] members to form the body of Christ
[1:28:06] body formed by
[1:28:09] many baptized by The Same
[1:28:14] Spirit so then God was
[1:28:18] manif but our
[1:28:21] thoughts not like the thoughts of
[1:28:24] God that is why when he was on
[1:28:27] Earth he began to
[1:28:29] develop began to
[1:28:32] show the way he
[1:28:38] thought the message the future home of
[1:28:40] the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly
[1:28:43] bride now this little
[1:28:47] woman her life up here she was a
[1:28:51] prostitute she was all marred
[1:28:53] up but way down in
[1:28:57] her here was just a little bit of
[1:29:01] understanding I know when Messiah cometh
[1:29:04] that was
[1:29:07] there but this little woman had nothing
[1:29:09] to
[1:29:12] present she was as filthy and dirty as
[1:29:14] she could be but
[1:29:17] notice way down in
[1:29:19] her she got represent
[1:29:23] and once
[1:29:26] again perf thoughts of
[1:29:29] God walking on the face
[1:29:32] of he was analyzing the situation he saw
[1:29:36] this
[1:29:36] woman he
[1:29:39] made before the foundation of the earth
[1:29:42] he had to be there at a certain time
[1:29:44] time to have an appointment with
[1:29:48] something which people
[1:29:50] despised people saw the
[1:29:54] flesh people saw a young lady who
[1:29:58] wasil nothing to
[1:30:00] present but once again God
[1:30:04] Made Who was in the
[1:30:08] beginning now he was
[1:30:10] manifesting he began to analyze the
[1:30:13] situation he began to
[1:30:15] analyze and he saw a young lady of ill
[1:30:19] Fame he saw a lady who was
[1:30:23] lost but inside of that
[1:30:25] woman there was
[1:30:28] representation of what Jesus
[1:30:30] saw was the value of the
[1:30:33] seed you look at the
[1:30:35] condition at the value of the
[1:30:39] seed the value of the
[1:30:42] seed he saw that there
[1:30:44] was crying within
[1:30:47] her and he
[1:30:49] began to discern the spirit of that
[1:30:51] woman
[1:30:53] that
[1:30:54] woman when she presents herself with
[1:30:57] Jesus she was 18 years old she 18 years
[1:31:01] old that's what the prophet
[1:31:05] says imagine a young lady in that
[1:31:10] condition when Jesus begins to speak
[1:31:12] with
[1:31:13] her she felt
[1:31:17] judged because what she received from
[1:31:19] everyone
[1:31:20] else she couldn't go with to
[1:31:25] bring she had to go at the hottest time
[1:31:27] of the day when no one wanted to
[1:31:32] go her heart the
[1:31:35] desire to be able to satisfy that that
[1:31:40] insatable with nothing could
[1:31:42] fill she look one way or
[1:31:46] another had many
[1:31:50] hus her
[1:31:53] husband but inside of
[1:31:55] her she had a small bit of
[1:31:59] understanding that when the Messiah
[1:32:02] cometh her life would be
[1:32:05] restored her thirst would be
[1:32:08] quenched and Jesus once again the God
[1:32:14] made analyzed the
[1:32:17] situation he didn't care about
[1:32:19] the he began to speak the word
[1:32:22] speaks the
[1:32:25] word the Eternal
[1:32:27] seed which
[1:32:29] was in the midst of that
[1:32:31] disorder the prophet
[1:32:35] says and she was looking for this to be
[1:32:37] made
[1:32:38] flesh and when he said she
[1:32:41] said sir you're not be
[1:32:45] El I perceive you are a
[1:32:49] prophet now we know the Messiah which is
[1:32:51] called thought Christ will come and when
[1:32:53] he does he'll do this he said I
[1:32:59] am he said I am he he spoke the
[1:33:04] word then all of the
[1:33:06] heavens the power of the
[1:33:10] universe happened in the
[1:33:14] ages in the word that he had
[1:33:18] spoken and all that power hit
[1:33:22] and that that seed began to come to life
[1:33:25] I
[1:33:27] am great powerful
[1:33:30] conqueror general of the
[1:33:33] army one has spoken throughout the
[1:33:37] ages manifested in different ways the
[1:33:40] Eternal God made
[1:33:44] flesh looking and saving that which had
[1:33:46] been
[1:33:47] lost he made contact with the
[1:33:50] seed
[1:33:53] The Great I
[1:33:55] Am the spoken
[1:33:58] word recognition of who she
[1:34:01] was give value to
[1:34:04] the he didn't look at the
[1:34:06] condition at the value of that
[1:34:10] seed she didn't have
[1:34:12] doubt she didn't have to explain
[1:34:15] it she saw it and she believed it and
[1:34:18] she left
[1:34:20] why what did it do to her it redeemed
[1:34:24] her now
[1:34:26] watch he came to be a
[1:34:30] redeemer what does redeem mean bring
[1:34:35] back so then he was
[1:34:37] fulfilling the
[1:34:39] plan his thoughts which he had
[1:34:42] had from the beginning of the world to
[1:34:46] fulfill it at that
[1:34:47] moment that appointment that he
[1:34:50] had Young
[1:34:54] T The Thirst she had in her heart and so
[1:34:58] then she he began to unravel what he was
[1:35:02] he was a
[1:35:04] redeemer so the process of
[1:35:06] redemption to
[1:35:08] unravel he spoke the word and he said I
[1:35:12] am
[1:35:13] he who the scripture has spoken
[1:35:18] of he came to redeem which had fallen
[1:35:24] in the fall this had messed up with that
[1:35:28] girl but God had her in his
[1:35:31] thinking before the foundation of the
[1:35:34] world God had her in his thinking so
[1:35:39] then if God's thoughts are
[1:35:43] Eternal she was in the thoughts of
[1:35:46] God so then she had eternal
[1:35:49] life so that's why God didn't
[1:35:53] care and he finds the
[1:35:56] value the condition will not
[1:35:59] limit his thoughts are
[1:36:02] Eternal thoughts do not have limits when
[1:36:05] he speaks the
[1:36:07] word his thoughts are
[1:36:10] expressed they have to come to
[1:36:12] materialize but that's why his
[1:36:15] plan he hat his thoughts in Christ and
[1:36:19] reveal them not just to one
[1:36:22] but to a
[1:36:24] body body of the Lord Jesus Christ each
[1:36:28] one
[1:36:30] position but all one in when Christ
[1:36:34] speaks he expresses his
[1:36:37] thoughts but he changes mask he changes
[1:36:41] mask over here
[1:36:43] Chang over here he speak else heess his
[1:36:47] thoughts over
[1:36:49] here and saving
[1:36:52] that which had been
[1:36:53] lost now he does it through
[1:36:56] Christ through
[1:37:00] Christ manifested in another
[1:37:05] age he came to cleanse
[1:37:07] her
[1:37:09] then he KN he she he had eternal
[1:37:13] life he know he had eternal
[1:37:17] life she understood that she had etal
[1:37:20] life
[1:37:22] but to understand that she had eternal
[1:37:24] life contact with the word with the with
[1:37:29] Christ with Christ the
[1:37:34] word the prophet in that same
[1:37:38] message it says a Son of
[1:37:41] God can go on for much
[1:37:44] time without recognizing that he is a
[1:37:47] son now let me say it
[1:37:49] again a son of of
[1:37:52] God can go on for a long
[1:37:55] time without recognizing that he is a
[1:37:58] son and
[1:38:00] once that a true Son of
[1:38:03] God hears the Cry
[1:38:05] of through the
[1:38:09] word you will realize sooner or later
[1:38:11] who he
[1:38:14] is when the Holy Spirit begins to cry
[1:38:17] out to express the word sooner or later
[1:38:21] that
[1:38:23] son in dark in the dis he will hear the
[1:38:28] word word of his God
[1:38:31] speaking when he sees the
[1:38:33] mask will
[1:38:36] be Christ once
[1:38:39] again his
[1:38:42] wording his thoughts
[1:38:47] again saving that which had been lost
[1:38:50] but now
[1:38:53] a body through
[1:38:56] those understood their
[1:38:58] position taken the
[1:39:01] responsibility manifest the glory of God
[1:39:04] I will speak the
[1:39:06] word because to be in Christ I have to
[1:39:09] be baptized in the same body we have one
[1:39:13] Faith one Lord one baptism and that
[1:39:17] takes
[1:39:18] us to be in line CHR and with the
[1:39:21] with the
[1:39:22] ano and when Christ speaks when you
[1:39:25] speak God expressing his
[1:39:32] thoughts but the
[1:39:36] enemy wants to devalue the value of the
[1:39:40] seed so then
[1:39:45] God he begins to reveal to us his
[1:39:48] mystery and he tells us
[1:39:52] in in
[1:39:55] Colossians
[1:40:00] 126 the musicians can come
[1:40:05] forward where of I made a
[1:40:11] minister according to dispensation of
[1:40:13] God this is Paul talking to the
[1:40:17] Colossians Accord of God which is given
[1:40:19] to me for you
[1:40:22] to
[1:40:24] fulfill the word of
[1:40:29] God even the mystery which had been hid
[1:40:31] from ages and from
[1:40:33] Generations but now is made manifest to
[1:40:35] his
[1:40:38] Saints whom God would make known that is
[1:40:40] the riches of his
[1:40:43] glory of this mystery among the
[1:40:46] Gentiles which is Christ in
[1:40:49] you the hope of
[1:40:52] Glory a people who
[1:40:56] weren't a people who weren't a
[1:40:59] [Music]
[1:41:00] people Paul says in Romans
[1:41:04] 9 that he'll call his
[1:41:06] people who is not my
[1:41:09] people and her
[1:41:12] Beloved the not beloved I will
[1:41:16] call people who had no
[1:41:19] hope people that was given to the idol
[1:41:23] they were away from
[1:41:26] God Paul understands the calling of God
[1:41:29] in
[1:41:30] his Christ the word he has an
[1:41:34] experience he has an
[1:41:36] experience that took away all of his
[1:41:40] thought and now God could pour His
[1:41:43] thought Christ once
[1:41:45] again and he hides them in
[1:41:48] Paul he begins to speak the mystery
[1:41:52] now the
[1:41:54] Gentiles they had the same right to hear
[1:41:57] the
[1:41:59] gospel that were not
[1:42:02] beloved people that were not a
[1:42:05] people people that had
[1:42:08] no God would raise a
[1:42:12] beloved said he would say you
[1:42:14] are don't devalue who you
[1:42:17] are do matter condition what you find
[1:42:19] yourself in don't look don't look at
[1:42:23] your condition look at the value that
[1:42:25] you
[1:42:26] have what is worth more the
[1:42:30] blood the blood that he
[1:42:33] shed or what the Blood Bought what has
[1:42:36] more
[1:42:38] value his blood for
[1:42:41] us because he analyzed our situation and
[1:42:44] he said I will not forsake them I will
[1:42:47] not leave them in that condition I will
[1:42:49] not leave them lost
[1:42:52] I will not forsake
[1:42:54] them I will not leave them
[1:42:56] enslaved I will give my
[1:42:58] life I will shed my
[1:43:01] blood for the pardon of sin for the
[1:43:05] Redemption to bring healing to bring
[1:43:09] Deliverance because I am
[1:43:12] analyzing seeing the value of the
[1:43:14] seed the value that you have he saw it
[1:43:19] the seventh age
[1:43:22] he saw the age of L and he
[1:43:26] said he said I will send once
[1:43:28] again to Christ the
[1:43:31] word The Original
[1:43:34] Seed begin to speak my
[1:43:36] word and when I speak my
[1:43:39] words it will reveal my
[1:43:41] thoughts in that inside of
[1:43:44] Christ will have access to
[1:43:47] my to the hidden Mystery throughout the
[1:43:51] time you can
[1:43:53] live as high as your thoughts in your
[1:43:58] thoughts are the thoughts of
[1:44:01] God so then your thoughts are Eternal so
[1:44:04] then you have you have access to
[1:44:08] Eternity when you enter
[1:44:10] eternity you take the hand of Fai you
[1:44:14] enter into another dimension you begin
[1:44:17] to pull that which you
[1:44:18] need because my thoughts
[1:44:21] not your thoughts says the
[1:44:24] Lord throughout the message of the
[1:44:27] hour access to the thoughts of
[1:44:30] God now if I speak the word and it's no
[1:44:34] longer me
[1:44:35] speaking made flesh speaking and
[1:44:38] expressing the thoughts of God to bring
[1:44:42] order where there is disorder to bring
[1:44:45] life to bring
[1:44:48] hope where everything is dried up to
[1:44:52] bring pardon to bring
[1:44:55] Deliverance to bring the
[1:44:57] redemp BR the
[1:45:00] restoration who has to speak the word

[1:45:28] 329 for the Lord's portion is his
[1:45:31] people it's a relationship of God loves
[1:45:35] us so
[1:45:37] much each time that he expressed his
[1:45:40] love in the Old
[1:45:42] Testament it was a story of love with a
[1:45:48] gentile talking about the plan that
[1:45:49] would come in the
[1:45:51] future that he would make of a
[1:45:54] people someone who was not beloved he
[1:45:57] would make him his
[1:45:59] beloved he saw the value of the
[1:46:02] seed he saw the value that you
[1:46:06] have please don't tell me that you're
[1:46:09] worthless don't tell me that you have no
[1:46:11] value don't look at your
[1:46:14] circumstances the representation that is
[1:46:16] inside of
[1:46:19] you why J Christ paid the price he
[1:46:23] analyzes your
[1:46:25] situation you're in a
[1:46:27] problem it's an
[1:46:30] opportunity the glory of
[1:46:33] God speak the
[1:46:35] word
[1:46:37] manifestation the promise of God for
[1:46:39] this time and for your
[1:46:42] [Music]
[1:46:44] life the enemy tries to devalue us he
[1:46:48] tries to buy
[1:46:49] us by telling
[1:46:51] God telling Lord Jesus
[1:46:54] Christ that we have no
[1:46:57] value but Jesus answers unto
[1:47:01] him they are not for
[1:47:04] sale they have been
[1:47:07] redeemed but you don't see how they fail
[1:47:10] I love them you don't see their
[1:47:13] condition they're not for they're my
[1:47:16] children they're
[1:47:19] mine
[1:47:21] they were in the lowest and the
[1:47:24] filthiest I paid the price for
[1:47:26] them and when they can
[1:47:30] understand the value of the price that I
[1:47:32] paid for
[1:47:34] them when that Revelation reaches
[1:47:37] them they will free them from the
[1:47:40] condition which they have
[1:47:43] experienced then
[1:47:46] they they will understand the value of
[1:47:48] their
[1:47:49] soul they will
[1:47:51] understand that before my
[1:47:54] eyes they have no price they
[1:47:59] Priceless there's nothing that can buy
[1:48:02] them because I bought them for
[1:48:06] myself that's a love
[1:48:10] [Music]
[1:48:15] relationship all we have we just have to
[1:48:19] understand
[1:48:20] the value that we have inside of
[1:48:22] us don't look at the
[1:48:25] condition don't look at the
[1:48:27] circumstances act as God
[1:48:30] acts analyze the
[1:48:33] situation then look at the value of the
[1:48:37] seed look at the price that was paid for
[1:48:39] that
[1:48:40] seed and everything that was done for
[1:48:43] that
[1:48:44] seed so when you see everything that's
[1:48:46] been done you will begin to understand
[1:48:49] that it was done for you you it was done
[1:48:51] for
[1:48:53] you and when the Revelation
[1:48:55] strikes you understand he gave his life
[1:48:58] for me he opened up a way for
[1:49:01] me to understand the value that you
[1:49:06] have you understand the seed has
[1:49:10] value and God is listening to The Cry of
[1:49:13] each se you have to cry
[1:49:15] out because when the seed cries
[1:49:18] out God comes and enters into the
[1:49:21] scene bow your heads
[1:49:25] please we give you thanks Lord
[1:49:29] Jesus to understand that we have the the
[1:49:32] value we have before th
