[35:00] cries out into the City and the man of
[35:04] wisdom shall see thy name hear ye the
[35:07] rod and who
[35:20] like to continue with the same thought
[35:22] we did last time it's a very simple word
[35:26] it's always in our daily living
[35:44] or act
[35:46] foreign
[35:59] how you face a person
[36:02] is
[36:07] Christian and they have a good attitude
[36:13] the correct moral attitude
[36:17] and the wrong model attitude
[36:21] [Music]
[36:27] last time
[36:35] the right mental attitude towards any
[36:37] promise of God
[36:41] you won't cast out a demon with a bad
[36:44] attitude
[36:57] or your brother
[37:14] 15 extra years of life
[37:21] also the attitudes that we take towards
[37:24] any problem that comes against us
[37:27] how do we feed ourselves during the week
[37:33] how much Instagram Facebook or or
[37:36] Instagram do we feed our spirit
[37:39] is
[37:41] depends which dog you feel the most you
[37:44] see that the black dogs
[37:45] we saw that already
[37:48] [Music]
[37:50] we also saw the attitude that the thief
[37:53] took on the cross
[37:59] thank you
[38:02] hello
[38:11] and Abraham said unto lot let there be
[38:14] no Strife I pray thee between me and
[38:16] thee and between my herdsmen and thy
[38:18] herdsmen for we are Brethren observation
[38:21] an observation here this is
[38:26] supposedly his nephew
[38:29] but when you come to the Lord
[38:32] we become Brethren
[38:35] um
[38:40] foreign
[38:57] then I will go to the right if the other
[38:59] part to the right hand then I will go to
[39:02] the left alone says
[39:09] oriente is
[39:12] chose him all the planes of Jordan and
[39:16] large journeyed East and they separated
[39:18] themselves from one to the other uh
[39:25] in the message Hebrews chapter 7 57 9
[39:29] 15.
[39:51] but after a while his father died he
[39:54] buried him
[39:59] then he had his nephew then quarrels and
[40:03] arguments came up
[40:06] and then finally took his choice and
[40:10] went down into Sodom
[40:12] that even notice that Abraham didn't
[40:15] fuss with lots
[40:17] he said we are brethren
[40:20] we must not argue is
[40:30] any way you want to if you go east then
[40:33] I'll go west
[40:37] that's the Christian attitude
[40:42] be willing to give the other man the
[40:45] best of the deal
[40:47] always presented to him
[40:50] let him take his choice Abraham
[40:57] for why what Abraham do it he knew that
[41:00] what had what was promised by God that
[41:03] he would inherit the whole thing anyhow
[41:05] um
[41:10] so then attend a college College why
[41:13] should we care okay
[41:16] he brings it down to us
[41:19] it all belongs to us anyways
[41:27] where I stayed here dictionary
[41:31] it does not attack uh
[41:36] that's not attack it's not
[41:41] aggressively it's peaceful
[41:44] docile
[41:50] this is
[42:02] so give the man the best of the choice
[42:06] maybe that's the only thing he'll get
[42:09] everything else is yours
[42:18] one thing that caught my attention
[42:24] this
[42:29] is when we always have a relative
[42:33] ly grew up together
[42:34] [Music]
[42:36] for one reason or another we got
[42:38] separated from our home he lives
[42:50] what was he doing
[42:55] we should reflect that in US
[43:04] how Abraham deals with lot
[43:07] s
[43:11] Genesis 14 14 and then Abraham heard
[43:14] that his brother was taken captive
[43:21] he armed his trained servants born in
[43:24] his own house 318 and pursued them into
[43:27] Dan
[43:31] and he divided him against them and he
[43:34] and his servants by night is
[43:50] the women also and the people the Kings
[43:52] there
[43:53] I'm going to hold on Abraham they're
[43:56] just a little bit he was not a warrior
[43:59] he gathered up with the strange servants
[44:03] with Shabbos
[44:07] and he went against an army
[44:10] can you imagine the attitude
[44:13] how God is with Abraham
[44:49] and the Lord said because the Cry of
[44:51] Sodom and Gomorrah is great and because
[44:54] their sin is very Grievous
[45:01] God comes down
[45:05] and the two angels which we know who
[45:07] they are
[45:16] do you think
[45:21] but because he loved Abraham
[45:26] at the time but he was going to do
[45:30] and then some kind of a negotiation
[45:33] Lord what is this what is this 50. 50
[45:37] righteous
[45:39] what if there's 40. I will not destroy
[45:42] it is
[45:48] there weren't even ten righteous there I
[45:51] mean amen
[45:54] and he said once again
[46:00] I got an ideas see ideas
[46:03] and he said oh let not the Lord be angry
[46:07] and I will speak yet but this once
[46:10] shall be found there and he said I will
[46:13] not destroyed for the tense sake
[46:17] I will not destroy them
[46:22] he went back and he argued with me with
[46:25] himself with Abraham and he went back to
[46:27] his place but this caught my attention
[46:34] had made an influence
[46:44] but it was all the contrary
[46:49] was taking Lots
[46:58] 15. curioso I fell in the Curious data
[47:02] here
[47:08] I had about 50 or 60 000 people
[47:11] um
[47:14] if we bring it down to our time it would
[47:16] be hard to see
[47:21] as normally when we travel around the
[47:23] city we use vehicles and we get a faster
[47:24] service
[47:27] but I brought it down to a city which we
[47:29] all know
[47:30] it was like Flagstaff
[47:34] but that size the city of Sodom is
[47:39] the closest I found people-wise in
[47:43] population amen amen
[47:46] we're going to see another incorrect
[47:48] attitude
[47:49] we saw the right attitude a Christian
[47:53] attitude from Abraham
[47:56] foreign
[48:17] where is Abel your brother
[48:22] and he said
[48:24] I do not know am I My Brother's Keeper
[48:33] and the Lord said what have you done the
[48:36] voice of your brother's blood is crying
[48:38] to me from the ground
[48:40] this is
[48:48] three messages uh Cain that Define caino
[49:13] it's like a challenge you're trying to
[49:15] challenge someone against something and
[49:17] resistance
[49:20] something
[49:26] this is
[49:30] reconciliation brother Bernie says
[49:37] the reason why God didn't allow Cain's
[49:41] sacrifice
[49:43] because God had cursed the ground
[49:47] he brought a sacrifice out of the ground
[49:53] bridge in 1954 the end time nothing is
[50:00] now notice there's two coming now out of
[50:02] Genesis let's bring them up
[50:07] then he was cane as soon as he seen
[50:10] God's blessed God blessed Abel he become
[50:14] jealous
[50:17] is that right a religious worshiper
[50:19] becoming jealous
[50:23] what it means to be jealous
[50:29] it's a feeling of being envious or or
[50:33] being angry at someone
[50:36] are we jealous
[50:38] because they gave someone a promotion
[50:42] the jealousy and the marriage
[50:44] jealousy
[50:59] matrimonious
[51:03] how many marriages
[51:06] and then he ends up killing them amen
[51:59] when I have it here foreign
[52:21] [Music]
[52:52] it was a way to communicate back then
[52:55] Houston Texas
[53:02] in Houston
[53:05] it was from Auburn here in Houston Texas
[53:07] it was that man that criticized me so
[53:09] bad that night when the angel when the
[53:11] picture of the angel that the Lord was
[53:12] taken there
[53:21] the wife said and I know brother Branham
[53:27] is
[53:36] sister's boy is sitting in the dead
[53:38] world to die in the chair
[53:43] he said what if it was your son Billy
[53:45] Paul
[54:16] [Music]
[54:20] the boy and his girlfriend
[54:22] [Music]
[54:29] and all you read it in the paper of
[54:31] course you said you only hoped you have
[54:33] is for you to come and hold the meeting
[54:35] and get the people together
[54:41] there was a president yes
[54:48] and they were asking a meeting with with
[54:51] them amen amen
[54:53] Raymond
[54:56] um
[55:06] and Raymond Orchestra and had he had
[55:09] already wrote me several times but you
[55:11] know I had planned after that meeting
[55:13] that I would go hunting trip with Mr
[55:14] McNally and them and then I thought well
[55:17] if I let the kids die they won't put my
[55:20] effort they won't put it my effort forth
[55:31] and then if I thought well if I let them
[55:34] kids die and don't put my effort forth
[55:36] I'll never be able to go hunting again
[55:40] I said all right I'll come in Houston I
[55:43] came over to Houston I had a meeting
[55:47] bottom and of course they never killed
[55:49] him
[55:50] they just gave him life
[55:54] that's what they wanted them to do give
[55:57] them life
[56:05] sentence
[56:07] to get to that um that that sentence
[56:11] they have to be first degree
[56:15] to be in the first degree they have to
[56:17] kill another president
[56:24] in
[56:25] observations
[56:27] [Music]
[56:36] spend the best in attorneys
[56:40] if it's worth it all his money he has
[56:45] to get them out of there
[56:47] singing
[56:48] if they were asking for help them
[57:01] he said an audience with the attorney
[57:04] and
[57:06] again
[57:08] when the Earthly law this is
[57:11] there's no more
[57:13] but there is
[57:20] a higher life comes than anyone else
[57:27] the governor of Texas
[57:36] the president they had killed John F
[57:38] Kennedy he was a governor
[57:41] he was a governor during that time
[57:43] [Music]
[57:45] able to get an appointment with him
[57:55] I'm going to read to you what brother
[57:57] Brandon said when he had this meeting
[58:00] and the message is July party of the
[58:02] gospel
[58:05] 1963-06 30.
[58:12] and I said the first murder that was
[58:14] ever committed in the world was one
[58:16] brother killed another
[58:19] did not take his life foreign
[58:55] no indeed
[59:00] if those were brothers words
[59:13] [Music]
[59:16] I mean my brother George Smith found
[59:18] that young man in 2001 he was still
[59:20] alive Laura Cristiano he wasn't a
[59:22] Christian
[59:26] but because of Christian added to the
[59:28] brother Branham
[59:29] that he was there living amen you once
[59:33] again though are you following me
[59:36] let us look at another attitude
[59:40] and numbers
[59:50] foreign
[1:00:02] Moses with a number of people of Israel
[1:00:06] 250 Chiefs of the congregation chosen
[1:00:09] from the assembly well-known men and
[1:00:11] they assembled together against Moses
[1:00:15] and the message standing in the Gap
[1:00:19] 630-623 Santos
[1:00:27] he says
[1:00:31] you are to have let the whole
[1:00:33] congregation do such and such they're
[1:00:35] all holy God had commanded Moses to lead
[1:00:37] the people to the promised land
[1:00:43] is
[1:00:47] and they said you have taken taken it
[1:00:51] upon yourself to do too much you try to
[1:00:54] make yourself the only one in the whole
[1:00:56] bunch that has got away
[1:00:59] attitude
[1:01:26] [Music]
[1:01:41] [Music]
[1:01:45] woman
[1:02:01] from that region came out and was crying
[1:02:03] have mercy on me O Lord son of David my
[1:02:06] daughter is severely oppressed by a
[1:02:08] demon
[1:02:21] Israel but he did not answer her a word
[1:02:25] and his disciples came and begged him
[1:02:27] saying send her away for she is crying
[1:02:30] after us and he answered and sent the he
[1:02:33] answered I was sent only to the last
[1:02:36] sheep of the House of Israel is
[1:02:45] but she came and knelt before him saying
[1:02:47] Lord help me and he answered it is not
[1:02:50] right to take the children's bread and
[1:02:52] throw it to the dogs
[1:02:57] she said yes Lord yet even the dogs eat
[1:03:01] all the crumbs that fall from their
[1:03:03] master's table
[1:03:04] or attitude
[1:03:07] humbled more I mean
[1:03:17] what if he would tell that to any one of
[1:03:20] us
[1:03:27] but there was nothing in him anyways
[1:03:34] the great big church right there he
[1:03:36] ain't nothing but a Holy Roller he ain't
[1:03:38] nothing but a Bells
[1:03:40] if it would have been in our time
[1:03:44] that would have been our answer is
[1:03:53] she said it is
[1:04:03] the scraps from under the children's
[1:04:06] table
[1:04:11] please the right attitude that she had
[1:04:15] foreign
[1:04:37] they said unto him teacher this woman

[1:19:08] we are all sinners
[1:19:13] all fallen short of the grace of God

[1:20:55] problem that we are facing today
[1:20:59] besides the addiction
[1:21:01] besides the diseases that are going on
[1:21:07] there's one
[1:21:09] Spirit are you in a spirit who seems to
[1:21:11] control us

[1:22:19] category

[1:22:30] do you want to get it
[1:22:39] I was out of town
[1:22:42] and everybody I came across
[1:22:45] the spirit
[1:22:51] and the more I would look at individuals
[1:22:54] I'd tell myself
[1:22:58] this is here yes what about the church
[1:23:08] not a spirit God the US brings tension
[1:23:16] because that's what's going on today
[1:23:19] I don't know what the
[1:23:26] thank God
[1:23:29] that is
[1:23:33] the same time
[1:23:39] and when we go out we preach the very
[1:23:43] same thing
[1:23:52] brother Branham continues
[1:23:55] I want you to listen to this
[1:23:57] what's going on
[1:24:01] that every son
[1:24:03] and every daughter that cometh to God
[1:24:10] you're going to be trying
[1:24:13] can you say Amen how many of us have
[1:24:16] been twice
[1:24:23] must be tried proven
[1:24:27] and tested
[1:24:30] he lets sickness
[1:24:34] what's anxiety a sickness
[1:24:38] what other thicknesses are going on
[1:24:41] foreign
[1:25:10] he lets diseases come upon you
[1:25:15] to show the world
[1:25:18] very simply there's no other way
[1:25:31] the examinado
[1:25:34] that you're truly is
[1:25:41] he's checking all over the place
[1:25:45] and the world laughs
[1:25:52] but God's just proving
[1:25:56] that you're truly is
[1:26:02] that you're identified
[1:26:07] but you are identified
[1:26:11] so I'm gonna say it like this if we
[1:26:14] allows sickness
[1:26:21] and if you're not tempted don't lie to
[1:26:24] me
[1:26:25] everyone here
[1:26:39] the Holy Spirit
[1:26:44] and we cannot do nothing
[1:27:02] what our topic is
[1:27:08] and it's the word helping
[1:27:12] do you go for money no
[1:27:17] do you go for popularity
[1:27:21] we leave the church
[1:27:25] not to be recognized but we go
[1:27:30] because
[1:27:39] that's what this church is all about
[1:27:42] house giving light to the world
[1:27:54] believe in prayer
[1:27:57] that's all we have
[1:28:01] prayer
[1:28:05] to be taken Ada
[1:28:08] the way we should
[1:28:11] when we receive prayer
[1:28:21] that's one thing we don't do a lot of
[1:28:31] no matter where we go
[1:28:33] we should be praying
[1:28:37] when you call Carlos Carlos
[1:28:40] and he tells you yeah
[1:28:43] it's the attitude that you express
[1:28:49] I don't care where you go
[1:28:53] me is the caring
[1:28:56] instead
[1:29:26] unless you don't want it
[1:29:27] you don't need prayers I think we all
[1:29:31] need prayers
[1:29:33] again everything
[1:29:46] I want one two three four okay
[1:29:54] I love the number four yeah
[1:29:58] I believe in four Messengers
[1:30:03] those four Messengers
[1:30:07] bring life
[1:30:10] Satan has four Messengers so whatever
[1:30:13] God has
[1:30:18] there's four angels of death
[1:30:27] what I'm gonna do okay
[1:30:31] persona
[1:30:45] so what I want you to do okay again

[1:31:04] we all have pressure
[1:31:12] that's why he needs
[1:31:15] spursion like I said
[1:31:18] I'm going to ask him a question
[1:31:23] then all he has to do is raise his hand
[1:31:26] are you under a lot of pressure
[1:31:30] you're under a lot of stress
[1:31:32] raise your hands
