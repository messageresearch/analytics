[0:09] now there's a little preview of what
[0:10] death was and how horrible death was to
[0:13] the founders down to our Christian
[0:16] religion how the promises is given down
[0:18] through these Patriarchs that have
[0:19] mentioned this morning now let's come
[0:21] right down the home words
[0:28] that
[0:41] these little disciples after the little
[0:43] band that was hated in the
[0:46] beginning they had not many friends of
[0:48] this Earth and any man that serves Jesus
[0:52] Christ will not have many friends of
[0:54] this you have to stand on your
[0:56] conviction
[0:58] alone
[1:16] for many times you have to stand by
[1:19] yourself but he promised he would stand
[1:22] with you I'll go with you even to the
[1:28] end
[1:35] and now while I see him let's look at it
[1:38] he' been taken away they expected
[1:40] because he could do Miracles and he
[1:43] claimed he did nothing in himself but
[1:45] what the father showed him but he he was
[1:48] a Mir
[1:58] worker
[2:04] and when he given into the hands of P
[2:07] how could they expect to see the Messiah
[2:10] of God stripped down with his clothes
[2:12] and stand there and beaten and bruised
[2:14] and mashed and crushed and spit on and
[2:17] not even open his mouth and say a word
[2:20] that had broken their
[2:28] heart
[2:44] the very man could stretch out say be
[2:47] still and the wind and the
[2:50] [Music]
[2:56] waves the one who could stop a funeral
[2:59] procession and lay hand up on the casket
[3:00] and say young man I say unto the AR and
[3:04] he come
[3:15] for one who went into a heartbroken home
[3:18] where a daughter just died a little
[3:21] priest who would set himself with Jesus
[3:23] and became a Believer and he walked in
[3:26] said Give Peace because the damel is not
[3:28] dead she sleep
[3:49] surely they would have known surely
[3:52] there was something there he walked in
[3:54] Tucker by the hand look at it and said
[3:57] Danel I say unto thee arise and girl
[4:00] that was dead in her soul gone stood to
[4:03] her
[4:23] feet how that he went to the grave of
[4:26] Lazarus crying like a man the tears
[4:29] rolling down his cheeks as he wept and
[4:31] stood there and a man that have been
[4:33] dead four days and the skin worms
[4:36] crawling in and out of his body let see
[4:39] him raise his little figure like that
[4:41] that I am the resurrection and the life
[4:44] he that believeth in me though he were
[4:46] dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth
[4:49] and believeth in me shall never
[4:56] [Music]
[4:58] die
[5:25] for thank of it he that liveth and
[5:28] believeth in me shall never die what a
[5:31] hope we have this morning then when we
[5:34] visit our grace through our loved on
[5:36] what a hope we have in this mortal flesh
[5:38] today as the Holy Spirit Bears record he
[5:43] lives shall never die
[5:58] has
[6:12] yet we pack the bodies over the grave of
[6:14] the sa but inside they are alive they're
[6:18] living
[6:28] somewhere
[6:31] when he stood said I am the resurrection
[6:33] and life and there was a man laying
[6:35] there he said take away the stone and
[6:37] the contamination of his body that odor
[6:39] of a human body you know what it is when
[6:42] they raised up what with the sickly
[6:44] smell around there but he spoke out and
[6:46] said
[6:47] Lazarus come forth and a man that had
[6:51] been dead four days rose up from the
[6:58] grave
[7:24] how could they see a man with that kind
[7:26] of a power hanging on Calvary with great
[7:30] mocking gods of solders spit that made
[7:33] fun of him dropping from his beard while
[7:35] they jerked handfuls of beard from his
[7:36] face and hit him on
[7:58] Andes
[8:00] when they see Roman Nails drove into his
[8:02] hands and into his feet how could they
[8:04] see a man like that die because God
[8:08] required judgment and Christ took our
[8:24] judgment how they were so disappointed
[8:27] they went away to their and and Peter
[8:29] said I go fish and the disciples said
[8:32] I'll just go with you they did they were
[8:34] all together torn
[8:53] upo there they took his body down
[8:55] wrapped it in some linen and laid it in
[8:57] the grave and said that's the thing is
[9:08] that how the world was against him they
[9:11] said he was a Holy Roller he was insane
[9:13] he was he was a fanatic and so forth but
[9:16] he said he was God he looked like him he
[9:20] acted like him he proved he was
[9:28] God
[9:42] [Music]
[9:43] a woman said not long as I said this
[9:45] many times she said he wasn't Divine
[9:47] brother brand a Christian Science woman
[9:50] she said he was only a man that he was
[9:52] just man I said he was more than a man
[9:55] he was God I said he either God or
[9:58] Deceiver
[10:19] she said well because he cried the grave
[10:21] of Lazarus he proved that he wasn't
[10:23] nothing but a man I said when he was
[10:24] crying he cried like a man but when he
[10:27] rose the dead he proved he was God
[10:45] he is I said when he was hungry he
[10:47] hunger like a man but could you imagine
[10:49] a man standing around a fig tree trying
[10:52] to find something eat and a few days
[10:54] later picked up a few biscuits about two
[10:56] biscuits and two or three pieces of fish
[10:57] and said five
[10:59] people with
[11:22] good Calvary hanging there between the
[11:24] heavens and earth crying I thirst I
[11:26] thirst and turned even water to
[11:29] the very creator of the water standing
[11:32] there streaming for
[11:52] water sin for us that we in his Pro
[11:56] poverty might be made Rich he in his
[11:59] death he died like a sinner that us and
[12:01] our death could die Sons and Daughters
[12:03] of
[12:21] God I think one difference between death
[12:24] old daddy Haze down here when he was
[12:25] dying called his children to the bedside
[12:28] and there he'd been laying in a coma for
[12:30] two or three days he had a word he said
[12:32] dear bless my
[12:51] soul long white flowing beard he said
[12:55] dear bless my soul you thought daddy hay
[12:57] was dead he said I'll never
[12:59] because Jesus Lives I live
[13:19] also and there he blessed each one of
[13:22] his children said raise up my hands he
[13:24] couldn't hold his hands up one of his
[13:25] boys got on one side raised that hand
[13:27] the other raised that hand he began to
[13:43] saying eyes began to look up towards
[13:46] heaven he said happy day happy day since
[13:49] Jesus washed my sins away he taught me
[13:52] how let me pray and live rejoicing every
[13:57] day
[14:08] and closed his eyes and went out to meet
[14:11] God I tell you that's the way I want to
[14:13] go that's the way letesus
[14:27] Christ disciples had seemed that all the
[14:30] disappointments and everything that that
[14:33] he had looked like it let him down they
[14:35] all started to go back one went back to
[14:38] his work the other went back this
[14:51] [Music]
[14:57] way now we want start this morning on TB
[15:00] and after his resurrection Mary Martha
[15:04] and Mary Mary magdalina
[15:15] ofus
[15:18] magd it was early one morning they kept
[15:21] his body in the ground over the Sabbath
[15:23] which was a customary that they didn't
[15:26] do anything on the Sabbath day so he
[15:28] died Friday afternoon at 3:00 and Rose
[15:32] up real early Sunday
[15:48] morning now I want to settle this
[15:51] question while you're here this morning
[15:52] in this Sunrise Service many people says
[15:56] how comes then that he said said that he
[15:59] would lay he was in the grave three days
[16:01] and night he never said he would do that
[16:03] he said but in these three days while I
[16:05] raise up my
[16:27] body now the reason he did that is
[16:31] because David had said one place in the
[16:33] scripture I'll not leave his soul in
[16:36] Hell neither will I suffer my Holy One
[16:38] to see corruption and he knew that
[16:40] corruption set in the human body after
[16:43] 72 hours 3
[16:57] days
[17:02] and sometime within that three days and
[17:05] night God was going to raise him up so
[17:08] he died on Friday afternoon at 3:00 and
[17:10] Rose up early Sunday
[17:23] morning now let's just take a little
[17:26] drama right here and stop for a moment
[17:28] and
[17:33] watch I can see it's all night long poor
[17:37] little old Mary the Mother her heart was
[17:40] broke the prophet Anne told her she
[17:44] would Beed to RS
[17:57] of
[18:01] how that his body was afflicted in her
[18:04] own darling bab hanging on the cross and
[18:07] what a disgrace he had brought to the
[18:09] church but yet in her heart that
[18:11] Mother's Love reached out there was no
[18:13] matter what he had done how
[18:27] much
[18:32] [Music]
[18:36] he died capital punishment like a a
[18:39] convict today that would go out there to
[18:41] be hung or electrocuted or something
[18:44] that's the way he died in shame and
[18:57] disgrace
[19:07] and then how she' wept probably all
[19:09] night and her and Mary magdalina she
[19:12] knew his power she knew there was
[19:14] something about him was different from
[19:16] anyone else she had Seven Devils cast
[19:19] out of
[19:27] her
[19:37] everybody that's ever been free from the
[19:39] Devil by the power of Jesus Christ knows
[19:42] where they're standing no one can ever
[19:45] come in his great divine presence and
[19:48] ever be the same person anymore you
[19:51] you're a change something Happ to
[19:57] you
[20:11] or you can stand off psychology and
[20:13] imagine this and accept this a certain
[20:16] thing and some theories or uh something
[20:19] like that but we don't believe in
[20:22] theology we believe in the power of the
[20:24] resurrection of Jesus
[20:27] Christ
[20:41] and when you come into His a presence or
[20:45] something that happens in your life that
[20:47] changes you and you're never the same
[20:49] anymore a man that's ever been in the
[20:51] presence
[20:57] of
[21:04] she had Seven Devils cast out of her
[21:07] pride and envy and she thought she was
[21:09] so pretty and there was no one like her
[21:12] but when Jesus spoke
[21:27] in

[1:06:59] believe our brother for what he
[1:07:02] lived what he was able to
[1:07:08] see he's the greatest witness in
[1:07:12] mankind that saw God's
[1:07:18] manifestation in quantities that not
[1:07:19] even in biblical
[1:07:22] times were manifested
[1:07:27] very special
[1:07:28] man and he still
[1:07:31] is for he's not dead but only
[1:07:36] asleep he was born on the 13th of
[1:07:38] September of
[1:07:40] 1935 when he was two
[1:07:46] years he had an experience with the Lord
[1:07:49] allowed him to see the angel of the
[1:07:52] Lord
[1:07:55] there were in a hotel when the angel of
[1:07:57] the Lord uh told Brother Billy to the
[1:07:59] bill to wake him up and he was able to
[1:08:01] see the angel of the
[1:08:03] Lord so from that moment
[1:08:07] on I knew when the angel of the Lord was
[1:08:10] present I learned to identify that
[1:08:13] presence not only did I feel him but I
[1:08:15] was able to see
[1:08:19] him we're going to place a small video
[1:08:22] here at think about 10 minutes

[1:09:16] months after about a year Little Billy
[1:09:19] Paul come on the
[1:09:22] scene all she almost
[1:09:25] died and how I walked up and down the
[1:09:28] floor when the little fellow was being
[1:09:31] born and just as soon as he was Barn I
[1:09:34] heard him cry and I screamed I said

[1:09:38] Shall be Called Billy
[1:09:41] Paul many of you know my son Billy Paul
[1:09:45] his mother died when he just a little
[1:09:47] baby I packed him around and night time
[1:09:51] we couldn't afford enough coal to keep
[1:09:54] fire so he I'd put his bottle under my
[1:09:56] shoulders like this and keep it warm for
[1:09:58] him at night time when he wake up crying
[1:09:59] for his mother I'd put the bottle in his
[1:10:02] mouth
[1:10:04] and she asked me when she was dying
[1:10:07] always stick with Billy we've been real
[1:10:10] Chums and so everywhere I go I take
[1:10:14] Billy and he's stuck with
[1:10:20] me well like could take this opportunity
[1:10:23] to greet you I don't get this
[1:10:25] opportunity much anymore as you get a
[1:10:27] little older you can't do the things
[1:10:29] that you used to do you want to and in
[1:10:32] your heart but one thing I want you to
[1:10:34] know that I love you and I pray for you
[1:10:37] daily and I know that you pray for me
[1:10:40] because that's why I'm here today truly
[1:10:43] we're a blessed people and I just want
[1:10:45] to take an opportunity to say God bless
[1:10:47] you and over the many years that I have
[1:10:51] known you and have worked with you when
[1:10:54] Dad was here and now in the work with
[1:10:57] Brother Joseph it's just an honor to
[1:10:59] call you my friend and you know there's
[1:11:02] words you can't say but I just trust
[1:11:05] that this little greeting will be a
[1:11:06] blessing to you just to say I love you
[1:11:09] and that you can feel it from your heart
[1:11:12] you know brother brand said we could we
[1:11:14] could talk too much we could sing too
[1:11:16] much we could shout too much but we can
[1:11:18] never pray too much and each day brother
[1:11:22] Bram told me he said when you come in
[1:11:23] office Billy he said I want you to do my
[1:11:26] mail and I said Daddy I don't even know
[1:11:28] how to turn on the typewriter he says
[1:11:30] the Lord will be with you he said he
[1:11:32] told me he wanted you to do that for me
[1:11:34] and I said okay he said no matter if
[1:11:37] you've got one letter or you've got a
[1:11:39] thousand he said the first thing you do
[1:11:41] is kneel down and pray and lay your
[1:11:44] hands on the mail and ask the Lord to
[1:11:46] help you that day and he said don't you
[1:11:49] answer any Bible questions don't you
[1:11:51] answer for me he said if a question of
[1:11:54] me you keep them when we get together
[1:11:57] the next day or that day or whenever he
[1:12:00] says then you write down on the envelope
[1:12:02] and I'll answer the questions he said
[1:12:04] but no matter where I am he says you
[1:12:07] remember every day that you do the mail
[1:12:10] he said I'll be praying for you and he
[1:12:13] says and God will be there with you and
[1:12:15] he says don't process the mail he said
[1:12:17] just open one letter at a time and just
[1:12:20] think like you only have one letter to
[1:12:22] answer
[1:12:24] and he says and then when you through
[1:12:25] with that he says discard it and then
[1:12:27] get another one and that's what I've
[1:12:29] been doing for the last 60 years it's
[1:12:32] been a great honor and I know I'm
[1:12:35] getting older now I'm not an old man but
[1:12:38] I know I'm getting up there and soon
[1:12:41] I've got to go and be what we've all
[1:12:44] been waiting for and I believe that R is
[1:12:46] so close at hand but I just want an
[1:12:48] opportunity to say I love you and I
[1:12:51] thank you for your love to me your stand
[1:12:54] for this word and you know brother Billy
[1:12:56] I'm just talking to you from my heart I
[1:12:58] believe this is a oneman message it's a
[1:13:02] perfect message there's no mistakes
[1:13:04] there's many voices but for me and my
[1:13:07] house we only follow one voice and
[1:13:10] that's the voice of God to us in this
[1:13:12] day it's perfect it needs no
[1:13:15] interpretation it interprets itself and
[1:13:19] I was thinking a couple of days now I'll
[1:13:22] be getting my 83rd birthday and in my
[1:13:25] heart and in my body I don't feel that
[1:13:28] old I know I look it and the wife says I
[1:13:30] act like it no I shouldn't say that if
[1:13:32] it wasn't for her I I wouldn't even be
[1:13:34] here today but it's just the idea of of
[1:13:38] being able to express yourself this
[1:13:41] message is everything to me it's perfect
[1:13:45] and may God encourage your heart to stay
[1:13:47] with it there's things we don't
[1:13:49] understand but remember if God thought
[1:13:51] it brother Brenham spoke it we believe
[1:13:55] it and that settles it I was thinking
[1:13:57] the other day and I woke up and when I
[1:14:00] was just a little boy I was about 12
[1:14:02] years old and we was over in a little
[1:14:04] town called vandelia Illinois and
[1:14:07] brother Brandon was having a tent
[1:14:10] meeting and we stayed in a little cheap
[1:14:13] hotel and I say that to go with my
[1:14:16] testimony here and I know you've
[1:14:17] probably heard me give this testimony
[1:14:19] but maybe just one more time I want to
[1:14:22] share it with you because it's one of
[1:14:24] the greatest experiences of my
[1:14:26] life and in this room it didn't even
[1:14:29] have a bathroom the bathroom was down
[1:14:31] the hall and we just had a war spacing
[1:14:35] right where the camera is here and it
[1:14:37] was just a little war spacing and a
[1:14:39] little picture and that's where we'd
[1:14:40] wash our hands and things when we had to
[1:14:42] take a shower take a bath we' go down at
[1:14:44] the end of the hall I used to sell in
[1:14:48] the meetings I had a little apron and I
[1:14:50] go down and I'd sell the little books
[1:14:52] there was three books brother brandom
[1:14:54] had Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:14:55] today and forever I was not disobedient
[1:14:58] to the heavenly vision Divine Healing in
[1:15:01] healing in the campaigns and I thought I
[1:15:04] was something get down there and sell
[1:15:06] those books and daddy would always i'
[1:15:09] see the the Lord move in the meetings
[1:15:11] and as a kid he'd tell us about these
[1:15:13] things and how the angel would meet him
[1:15:16] and I remember one night in this hotel
[1:15:19] room we sitting there and my dad's
[1:15:21] brother was working with us at that time
[1:15:23] he was driving a truck and his name was
[1:15:25] Donnie and he was the youngest of the
[1:15:28] brothers and he and I and dad were
[1:15:30] sleeping in the same room and I don't
[1:15:34] remember I know Dad says on tape that he
[1:15:36] that he took a pillow and throw it over
[1:15:38] and woke me up all I remember I woke up
[1:15:40] was a pillar across my face and and he
[1:15:44] he had this pillar across my face and he
[1:15:45] says Paul I said yes sir it was about
[1:15:49] 2:00 in the morning and he says you know
[1:15:52] the Ang angel that Daddy talks about I
[1:15:55] said yes sir and he said he visited me
[1:15:57] tonight and was telling me some things
[1:16:00] and about the meetings and how to
[1:16:02] conduct the meetings and what was going
[1:16:03] to happen and I said yes sir and he
[1:16:06] still had the pill across my face and he
[1:16:08] says and I asked him could I wake you up
[1:16:11] and could I wake up my brother Donnie
[1:16:14] and he said the angel said you can wake
[1:16:16] up Billy And he says and he says can he
[1:16:20] see you and the angel said yes
[1:16:23] he
[1:16:24] said excuse
[1:16:26] me he says when Dad when dad takes his
[1:16:29] pillow from your face he says you know
[1:16:32] where the was spacing knows over there
[1:16:34] and I said yes sir he said he'll be
[1:16:36] standing there and you can see
[1:16:41] him and I said okay you remember I was
[1:16:45] just 12 years
[1:16:47] old and he took a pillow from my face
[1:16:50] and I thought it' be an angel with wings
[1:16:52] flying playing around but it wasn't like
[1:16:55] that there stood a man in that room
[1:16:57] dressed in Pure White and he had his
[1:16:59] arms folded like this hair down to his
[1:17:02] shoulders he just stood there one thing
[1:17:05] it remind was so outstanding to me he
[1:17:08] never spoke a word but he look around
[1:17:11] the room but his eyes was totally
[1:17:13] focused on my dad every move was
[1:17:17] watching my dad and I can see those I
[1:17:19] can see him yet now them eyes just going
[1:17:21] around the room he look at me me and he
[1:17:23] look over at my Uncle he look back
[1:17:25] around like that he'd move his head a
[1:17:27] little bit but his eyes never left
[1:17:29] Daddy's Eyes and I grabbed daddy cuz I I
[1:17:32] didn't know it was a man standing in the
[1:17:34] room over by the window and and he I
[1:17:37] never forget daddy told me he said don't
[1:17:39] be scared son he said he sent from the
[1:17:42] presence of almighty God and he says he
[1:17:45] won't harm you he says he'll be a
[1:17:49] blessing now watching he just held real
[1:17:52] close and daddy held me and he went from
[1:17:55] that being of a man just as brother Bram
[1:17:58] describes him into I'm not going to say
[1:18:01] a pillar fire it was like a Mist a light
[1:18:04] a vapor he just kind of vanished and he
[1:18:08] went out the window right out the room
[1:18:10] like that and when he left a rainbow
[1:18:13] come right in the same window and hung
[1:18:15] in that room for hours at midnight 2:00
[1:18:19] in the morning dark room but he stood
[1:18:21] there and that P oh excuse me that
[1:18:24] rainbow stayed in the
[1:18:26] room I felt a
[1:18:29] presence and I asked my dad later I says
[1:18:31] why did that happen and he says he said
[1:18:35] CU I wanted you to see him he said God
[1:18:38] called you to work with me Billy and I
[1:18:41] wanted you to see him and to know what
[1:18:43] Daddy was telling you was the truth not
[1:18:46] that I doubt it but was just such an
[1:18:48] experience such a wonderful experience
[1:18:51] and all through my life I traveled and
[1:18:54] my job was to get Daddy in and out of
[1:18:57] the meetings you know sometimes I let
[1:18:59] him stay too long and sometimes I take
[1:19:02] him too quick and you know I just young
[1:19:05] boy but I kept doing what he said and I
[1:19:06] give out the prayer cards and I'd bring
[1:19:08] the people up to him and sometimes I let
[1:19:11] him stay too long and he' said Billy you
[1:19:13] let me stay too long tonight he says he
[1:19:16] says tomorrow night you don't give out
[1:19:18] prayer calls CU Dad's too TI well I'd go
[1:19:20] home and I'd cry I'd be so upset because
[1:19:23] I messed up the next night's meeting
[1:19:26] then sometimes I take him too quick he'd
[1:19:28] say you could let me stay a little
[1:19:29] longer and no was just a hard time but
[1:19:31] what a wonderful time I've seen the
[1:19:34] people just any disease I was thinking
[1:19:37] the other night you know you watch the
[1:19:39] news they call this disease that and
[1:19:41] they they change the name but it's all
[1:19:43] the devil it's all the devil but when
[1:19:46] the angel made him he said if you get
[1:19:47] the people to believe you nothing will
[1:19:49] stand before your prayer not even cancer
[1:19:53] and I'm a witness to you today that he's
[1:19:56] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:19:59] what not one time from that time in that
[1:20:02] room when I saw that angel that I could
[1:20:05] always tell you not brother Billy but
[1:20:08] that presence I could tell when he was
[1:20:11] near even before daddy would say you
[1:20:13] know what I'm waiting for something I
[1:20:15] might be down at audience working the
[1:20:17] prayer line ushering whatever I might be
[1:20:20] doing but I could tell exactly when that
[1:20:22] angel come the platform before dad
[1:20:25] sometimes even said he said he's here
[1:20:27] but I knew he was so didn't make any
[1:20:29] difference what diseases was I knew when
[1:20:31] they left it's going to be well but he
[1:20:33] said if you get the people to believe
[1:20:34] you and I was telling someone the other
[1:20:36] day I said I've seen them bring them in
[1:20:40] well and they sit there and make fun and
[1:20:43] they pack them out dead I seen them pack
[1:20:46] him out
[1:20:48] paralyzed and I seen him bring him in on
[1:20:51] a stretcher and he would be dead and I
[1:20:54] seen him walk out alive and well only
[1:20:57] believe so I just wanted to say God
[1:20:59] bless you and I like to just leave my
[1:21:02] little greetings to you and this if I
[1:21:05] don't see you in person I'll meet you on
[1:21:09] that day and I had the privilege when he
[1:21:12] was
[1:21:13] here to have the interviews for him to
[1:21:15] set him up I don't know how it's going
[1:21:17] to be over there I just know I'm going
[1:21:19] to be there by his grace and I said God
[1:21:21] bless me above any man first of all he
[1:21:25] let me be his son he chose me and then
[1:21:30] let me be a son of a prophet and to be a
[1:21:33] brother of a prophet and to have worked
[1:21:36] with both of the prophets in my lifetime
[1:21:39] truly I've been a blessed
[1:21:41] man all we have to do is push play and
[1:21:47] obey God bless you and remember if God
[1:21:50] thought it brother Bram
[1:21:53] spoken I believe it and that settles God
[1:21:57] bless
[1:22:04] you I'm gonna give stand and give
[1:22:07] Applause in memory BR brother Billy Paul
[1:22:21] Brandon you may take your
[1:22:32] seats I imagine in other churches
[1:22:34] they're doing the same thing honoring
[1:22:36] the memory of this great man believe he
[1:22:38] deserves that much
[1:22:45] more Brother Joseph said in his
[1:22:51] letter
[1:22:54] it's difficult because he's not long
[1:22:55] longer with us like said but he has
[1:22:57] received his
[1:23:08] prize me people may have questions
[1:23:10] because of the testimony
[1:23:12] uh ask
[1:23:18] questions and that's where the Mind
[1:23:20] begins to find a logical answer
[1:23:24] and that's where us as humans
[1:23:27] fail because we want to try
[1:23:30] interpret the thoughts that God has
[1:23:32] expressed in a in in a human
[1:23:36] way sometimes we're just so connected
[1:23:38] with
[1:23:39] our with the
[1:23:42] material and when God comes and speaks
[1:23:44] to
[1:23:45] us we interpret his
[1:23:47] word in a in a humanly way and then we
[1:23:51] mix it
[1:23:53] and we take out the supernatural out of
[1:23:55] it and instead of
[1:23:57] believing we begin to doubt and
[1:24:00] [Music]
[1:24:02] reason speak to
[1:24:05] brother well someday we should be ready
[1:24:08] it's
[1:24:10] now because now he is a young man he's a
[1:24:14] young
[1:24:15] man according to what we've been
[1:24:18] taught according to what the prophet has
[1:24:20] spoken to us he's a young man
[1:24:23] now he's not an older man
[1:24:26] anymore God gave him his
[1:24:28] reward and seeing
[1:24:31] this people can speak and say this but
[1:24:34] for a Son of
[1:24:36] God instead of analyzing what's
[1:24:39] on a Son of God analyzes with inside and
[1:24:43] begin to analyze our own
[1:24:46] life ask about what happened
[1:24:49] here for us very important
[1:24:54] but also people were asking about
[1:24:59] this what are we going to do what's
[1:25:02] next Prophet already spoke
[1:25:05] it already told us what's going to
[1:25:08] happen he's already opened the
[1:25:16] Revelation our pastor and Apostle
[1:25:18] Brother G Garcia preached so many
[1:25:19] messages so many
[1:25:21] Revelations
[1:25:23] the only time for the only thing for us
[1:25:24] in these
[1:25:26] days shouldn't be to be questioning the
[1:25:29] modern
[1:25:37] events because the problem sometimes we
[1:25:39] try to put these events in chronological
[1:25:41] order and get in trouble with
[1:25:44] [Music]
[1:25:47] that remember time is an
[1:25:51] illusion everyone gives their own
[1:25:56] interpretation you can see sit down for
[1:25:58] five minutes and watch your favorite
[1:26:01] movie you'll say that
[1:26:06] fast let me grab you and put you
[1:26:10] underwater and trust me it's going to
[1:26:11] feel like 10
[1:26:15] hours because everyone interprets time
[1:26:17] according to its
[1:26:19] event but God doesn't work that way for
[1:26:22] God is
[1:26:23] eternal so what's
[1:26:26] happening there's no time to reason
[1:26:32] it this isn't time for you to say well
[1:26:34] it's gonna happen like this and it's
[1:26:35] gonna happen like
[1:26:37] that it's time for us to surrender more
[1:26:39] to
[1:26:40] God time to analyze Our
[1:26:44] Lives it's time to see and say
[1:26:48] Lord Lord is my life according to your
[1:26:51] word
[1:26:52] am I doing what you've sent me to
[1:26:54] do you have an eternal plan you have
[1:26:57] something for
[1:26:59] me am I behaving according to the plan
[1:27:02] you
[1:27:04] have part of the mystical body of the
[1:27:06] Lord Jesus
[1:27:08] Christ I know I've been
[1:27:12] called you gave me an order a
[1:27:15] commission but I'm placed am I plac in
[1:27:17] the body of
[1:27:18] Christ I'm placed in my
[1:27:21] position I'm doing what pleases
[1:27:24] you I'm doing your perfect
[1:27:27] will that's what we should be
[1:27:33] thinking the attacks that are happening
[1:27:35] in this
[1:27:37] [Music]
[1:27:39] conflict have been brutal attacks those
[1:27:41] who you've seen
[1:27:46] the the attacks from this Hamas to
[1:27:51] Israel
[1:27:53] we should always be praying for
[1:27:57] Israel Prophet taught
[1:27:59] us Israel is God's time
[1:28:03] piece you don't know what time you want
[1:28:05] to know what time it is look at
[1:28:07] your but if you don't know what time
[1:28:09] we're living in turn to
[1:28:14] Israel these times when the attacks
[1:28:19] happened uh it was a 50 year an
[1:28:28] there's a war that's called yum kapor
[1:28:29] that was in
[1:28:35] 1953 yapur is a secr celebration of the
[1:28:39] Jewish people a holy
[1:28:43] day interpretation to our
[1:28:46] language the day of
[1:28:51] atonement
[1:28:54] a religious holiday that is
[1:29:00] celebrated series of 10 days in which
[1:29:03] this celebration takes
[1:29:08] forth this they give us special
[1:29:12] attention it's a solemn
[1:29:17] day they complet completely sated to God
[1:29:23] asking for forgiveness to
[1:29:27] God God's sanctification and
[1:29:31] forgiveness asking forgiveness for their
[1:29:34] [Music]
[1:29:41] sins and that's when the the Hamas the
[1:29:43] terrorist organization attacked
[1:29:48] Israel so on our part what we can
[1:29:50] do
[1:29:52] is pray
[1:29:57] [Music]
[1:29:59] pray and people interpret
[1:30:02] it people get
[1:30:05] nervous people begin to get
[1:30:12] fear begin to interpret things in our
[1:30:14] own way of
[1:30:18] thinking there's a time we should
[1:30:20] dedicate ourselves to prayer it's now
[1:30:25] the time where we need to anal analyze
[1:30:27] ourselves it's
[1:30:29] now many
[1:30:34] times we understand certain things that
[1:30:36] the word tells
[1:30:36] [Music]
[1:30:38] us but we applied in a time where it
[1:30:40] shouldn't be
[1:30:43] [Music]
[1:30:45] applied brother Bernie preached a
[1:30:48] message titled the just
[1:30:50] judge
[1:30:53] brother bam said a thing that that the
[1:30:55] word comes to
[1:30:56] judge comes to
[1:31:00] judge and the word says that he made us
[1:31:02] Kings and
[1:31:03] [Music]
[1:31:08] Priests and when we're placed the
[1:31:14] Revelation and a time comes where it
[1:31:16] says that we will have judgment to be
[1:31:18] able to
[1:31:20] decide
[1:31:24] we'll be in a trial we'll be the ones
[1:31:26] making the
[1:31:27] decision as the Bride of the Lord Jesus
[1:31:30] Christ many
[1:31:34] times we take that out of of the context
[1:31:37] of
[1:31:39] time for the time when the bride will be
[1:31:43] judging is
[1:31:45] present at the time of
[1:31:48] judgment is that the bride is judging
[1:31:51] itself
[1:31:53] the bride is judging
[1:31:56] itself the bride before able to judge
[1:31:59] others has to judge has to sit
[1:32:03] down to judge yourself according to the
[1:32:11] word privilege we we have being the
[1:32:13] Bride of Jesus Christ I'm gonna sit down
[1:32:15] and
[1:32:19] judge before doing that we have to sit
[1:32:21] down and judge
[1:32:22] ourselves the words have been
[1:32:25] spoken the word begins to judge
[1:32:28] us begins to tell us where
[1:32:31] we're telling us where we need to fix
[1:32:33] ourselves but God forces no
[1:32:36] one this is the revelation of the last
[1:32:40] days that the maximum Revelation
[1:32:44] came another time has been
[1:32:47] around but also in this
[1:32:50] time God has made partnership with
[1:32:52] us God has made us
[1:32:56] partners partnership is
[1:32:59] 50/50 that's why it's so
[1:33:03] difficult has been loed in the time
[1:33:04] we're
[1:33:07] living Prophet said all the Demonic
[1:33:12] power to attack the Bride of the Lord
[1:33:14] Jesus
[1:33:16] Christ all the power of hell is
[1:33:18] attacking every son and daughter of
[1:33:20] God
[1:33:22] God has sent an
[1:33:25] unction of the eagle in the last
[1:33:28] days prophetic
[1:33:31] Vision where we can go to the highest
[1:33:33] point be able to
[1:33:35] see what's happening in our
[1:33:39] days the word where it needs to be
[1:33:43] placed and where should the word be
[1:33:46] placed in our
[1:33:48] hearts that's where we need to apply it
[1:33:50] to
[1:33:57] are you salted how many are
[1:33:59] salted we're
[1:34:02] salted
[1:34:05] remember the only salted
[1:34:07] ones are
[1:34:11] who the of the Lord Jesus
[1:34:15] Christ somebody calls you salty don't
[1:34:17] get offended don't get
[1:34:20] offend the bride is
[1:34:24] salted you are the salt of the
[1:34:26] earth I am the salt of the
[1:34:35] earth of
[1:34:37] theud begin to speak to
[1:34:39] them begin to preach them
[1:34:43] Doctrine he was speaking of
[1:34:49] do phes were preaching Doctrine
[1:34:53] when people heard uh the Lord
[1:34:56] Jesus they Marvel the doctrine of Lord
[1:34:58] Jesus Christ they heard the doctr of the
[1:35:01] Pharisees but when they heard the Lord
[1:35:03] Jesus Christ they Mar of his
[1:35:07] doct he would speak with
[1:35:12] authority because the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:35:14] came to make contact with
[1:35:16] them and what he want to do was change
[1:35:18] their
[1:35:20] attitude
[1:35:23] we we speak of the natural causes of
[1:35:26] uses for
[1:35:28] salt see see how salt is a
[1:35:31] seasoner on the basis of the scriptures
[1:35:34] Leviticus
[1:35:36] 2 how the sacrifice needed to be
[1:35:40] salted once it was salted it had to go
[1:35:42] through the
[1:35:45] fire as us when we go through the
[1:35:50] fire
[1:35:52] according to Colossians we begin to
[1:35:53] speak with salted
[1:35:57] words me means that when the trial come
[1:36:00] to support the trial sacrif we're a
[1:36:03] Living
[1:36:04] Sacrifice going through the
[1:36:08] trialed acceptable for the Lord Jesus
[1:36:18] Christ how we speak on how love is one
[1:36:21] that gives
[1:36:22] salt gives the The Salted flavor towards
[1:36:25] people When Love is
[1:36:29] projected see how salt provokes
[1:36:32] thirst provokes
[1:36:37] thirst when we are
[1:36:40] salted we provoke we provoke thirst to
[1:36:43] others desire to be like
[1:36:47] us others desire to have that Christian
[1:36:50] attitude
[1:36:59] now we mean to speak a little bit how
[1:37:00] salt is a
[1:37:04] preserver in the time of Jesus they used
[1:37:06] salt as a
[1:37:10] preserver now if you
[1:37:13] remember you that took
[1:37:15] notes according to the
[1:37:20] word salt was made to be stepped on by
[1:37:25] men was thrown on the floor to be
[1:37:28] stepped on
[1:37:36] by would throw is on the floor because
[1:37:38] the salt would get mixed up with other
[1:37:41] [Music]
[1:37:46] elements then people when they were
[1:37:47] going to use a salt they knew it was
[1:37:49] preserved with something else because it
[1:37:50] had a better taste
[1:37:55] so then the salt turned into a bitter
[1:37:57] salt they threw it along the
[1:37:59] way so the way wouldn't be so
[1:38:03] slippery only the salt that was
[1:38:05] preserved well salt that was
[1:38:08] used salt had much
[1:38:12] value there was ways especially made to
[1:38:16] transport that's why it's called The
[1:38:17] Salted
[1:38:19] way now as a preserver
[1:38:27] salt was used to preserve a combust
[1:38:29] combustibles
[1:38:31] no oh I'm sorry salt was used to
[1:38:34] preserve
[1:38:37] food so it wouldn't uh go
[1:38:41] bad meat
[1:38:43] wouldn't fish wouldn't go
[1:38:46] sour that's why it was so
[1:38:50] valuable
[1:38:52] because right now we want to conserve
[1:38:53] something we just freeze
[1:38:54] it they didn't have
[1:38:56] freezers but they have
[1:38:59] salt Sal would conserve the
[1:39:04] food that's why it was so
[1:39:09] valuable the food would
[1:39:14] spoil it avoided salt of food being
[1:39:20] corrupted
[1:39:22] it avoided for the for the food that
[1:39:23] they were about to eat to
[1:39:26] spoil then when we're
[1:39:30] salted when we are
[1:39:32] salted it's to
[1:39:36] preserve we turn into salted
[1:39:41] people we're avoiding the corruption of
[1:39:43] our
[1:39:47] attitudes helps us for not having
[1:39:49] negative at
[1:39:52] to be busy with not to be busy with our
[1:39:55] thoughts not only
[1:39:58] that second chronicles
[1:40:13] 135 are you not to know that the Lord
[1:40:16] God of Israel gave the Kingdom of Israel
[1:40:17] to David forever even to him and to his
[1:40:20] son by a covenant of
[1:40:23] salt God made a covenant of
[1:40:26] salt with David and his
[1:40:29] descendancy a covenant of
[1:40:32] salt a covenant that would
[1:40:36] last in the Old Testament when they had
[1:40:37] a covenant of
[1:40:40] Sal meant that something would
[1:40:44] last Isaiah

[1:41:03] Everlasting Covenant with you even the

[1:41:14] Covenant she said you the salt of the
[1:41:19] earth a covenant one with the
[1:41:23] they throw salt to one
[1:41:28] another that means that the Covenant
[1:41:30] must
[1:41:32] keep Sal holds them
[1:41:35] together keeps it from
[1:41:38] spoiling nothing can spoil our contract
[1:41:42] it's a
[1:41:44] covenant our handshake is
[1:41:49] fellowship we agree upon the basis of
[1:41:54] Fellowship that we'll keep our covenant
[1:41:56] one to
[1:41:58] another so will keep our
[1:42:01] covenant because it will not Mar or
[1:42:05] spoil our covenant will always be
[1:42:10] kept in the message he swore by
[1:42:14] himself he gave him the
[1:42:17] Covenant unconditionally not because
[1:42:19] Abraham was Abraham
[1:42:22] went through that weeks ago you
[1:42:26] know he gave Abraham the Covenant
[1:42:28] because God himself chose
[1:42:31] him elect him before the foundation of

[1:42:38] Earth God knew all about

[1:42:46] AB not only
[1:42:49] Abraham

[1:42:54] him so God made a
[1:42:57] covenant Covenant of

[1:51:18] is
[1:51:20] how many are
[1:51:24] salted within our
[1:51:26] heart is a
[1:51:28] mystery there a hidden
[1:51:31] Mystery but the
[1:51:35] problem many times we're sleep to what's
[1:51:39] happening Focus so much about what's
[1:51:41] around
[1:51:43] us don't Focus what's us the answer is
[1:51:47] not out the answer is in
[1:51:52] understand the answer to all your
[1:51:55] questions within us is the
[1:51:59] Eternal internal
[1:52:02] conversation always Destro us we have a
[1:52:08] mentality destroy
[1:52:14] ourselves of
[1:52:18] self-destruction us take promises to
[1:52:23] us self
[1:52:26] destroying of the
[1:52:30] diseases that is in these days
[1:52:35] everywhere immun our self our
[1:52:38] self-destroying immune system a a
[1:52:42] aimmune
[1:52:45] system our own body attacks
[1:52:48] itself
[1:52:54] things happening within our organism
[1:52:55] that our body doesn't know what to
[1:52:57] do and is attacking the
[1:52:59] body that's why there's bone
[1:53:01] inflammation Artis
[1:53:10] arthritis so many things going on that
[1:53:12] there diseases within our own
[1:53:16] body our body attacking

[1:53:24] life we attack
[1:53:27] ourselves we're destroying
[1:53:32] ourselves we're not giving the
[1:53:33] opportunity for the land to
[1:53:40] come within us there's a
[1:53:46] seal the lamb can untie
[1:53:48] it
[1:53:50] the nature of
[1:53:51] L that seal
[1:53:55] will will maintain
[1:53:58] hidden that's what it
[1:54:00] is that's why in these
[1:54:03] days the greatest thing there
[1:54:07] could greatest
[1:54:10] quality is to have a clean
[1:54:16] heart M but I'm saying a clean heart
[1:54:23] the Samaritan woman had a clean
[1:54:25] heart when she found herself with
[1:54:29] Jesus let me tell you what the prophet
[1:54:36] says the message he swore by
[1:54:43] himself you can't be destroyed of what
[1:54:46] God was already
[1:54:47] destroyed for you're a part of of
[1:54:51] God I will lift you up in the latter
