[19:41] I GRE each and every one of you this
[19:42] morning in the precious name of the Lord
[19:44] Jesus
[19:48] Christ before praying let's open our
[19:55] [Music]
[19:57] Bibles
[19:59] I have three scriptures the first being
[20:03] in the ninth chapter of First
[20:08] Corinthians verses 24 through
[20:12] [Music]
[20:19] [Music]
[20:27] 27
[20:30] [Music]
[20:47] know ye not that they which run in the
[20:50] race run all but one receiveth a prize
[20:54] so run that you may obtain and every man
[20:57] that striveth for the mastery
[20:59] is tempered in all things now they that
[21:01] do it obtain a corruptible Crown but we
[21:04] an Incorruptible I therefore so run not
[21:06] as uncertainly so fight I not as one
[21:09] that beateth the air but I keep under my
[21:12] body and bring it into subjection lest
[21:15] by any means when I have preached to
[21:16] others I myself should be a Cast
[21:19] [Music]

[21:25] 1 ver 13- 16
[21:31] [Music]
[21:42] [Music]
[21:49] [Music]
[21:57] St James chapter 1 1: 13 let no man say
[22:01] when he is tempted I am tempted of God
[22:03] for God cannot be tempted with evil
[22:06] neither tempteth he any man but every
[22:08] man is tempted when he is drawn away of
[22:10] his own lust and enticed and when lust
[22:13] has conceived it bringeth forth sin and
[22:16] sin when it is finished bringeth forth
[22:19] death do not Heir my beloved

[22:29] verses 14 through
[22:30] [Music]

[22:57] 18
[23:13] foris 22 beginning with verse 15 and the
[23:16] angel of the Lord called called Abraham
[23:19] out the second time and said by myself
[23:23] have I sworn sayeth the Lord for because
[23:25] thou Hast done this thing and H has not
[23:28] with withheld thy son thine only son
[23:31] that in blessing I Will Bless thee and
[23:33] in multiplying I will multiply thy seed
[23:35] as the stars of heaven and as the sand
[23:37] which is upon the seashore and thy seed
[23:40] shall possess the Gate of his
[23:43] enemies let us
[23:45] bow
[23:49] father we draw nigh unto thy of grace
[23:52] and
[23:53] mercy reporting for
[23:57] service
[24:00] before me is this sweater Lord
[24:05] of and as your word is being
[24:08] [Music]
[24:10] voiced as it is written
[24:14] Lord as the people which hear are
[24:18] delivered and as those that hear on the
[24:20] table are
[24:23] delivered and those that have not an
[24:25] opportunity
[24:27] be when this sweater goes to the
[24:30] indicated
[24:31] one that she may receive
[24:34] that she has need of in the name of the
[24:36] Lord Jesus
[24:38] Christ for we are more than
[24:40] conquerors in the name of the Lord Jesus
[24:48] Christ first of all I'd like to thank
[24:51] each and every one of you for visiting
[24:55] us the ministry which accompanies us all
[25:04] also and the Brethren which have helped
[25:06] through these few days we give them
[25:08] thanks
[25:12] also I think we've been benefited in
[25:15] having heard the four Brethren which
[25:23] spoke a very formidable message brother
[25:27] Ramon Deon spoke on the reaction of
[25:32] Faith then brother Abraham spoke to us
[25:36] on the big
[25:38] tree a very beautiful teaching that the
[25:41] brother brought
[25:45] forth last night brother Pablo re spoke
[25:48] to us on the rules or the laws of the
[25:54] game he that open the
[25:57] convention
[26:01] brother gabri speaking to us of the
[26:03] testimony in his
[26:09] life I sincerely have learned to love
[26:11] brother Gabriel very
[26:19] much because I believe that he's been
[26:21] able to understand something that has
[26:22] gone over many of our
[26:27] heads in coming here being here this
[26:34] morning first of all I appreciate God's
[26:39] leading and his
[26:47] protection the first time while having a
[26:50] convention that I've brought forth the
[26:52] word of God here in the
[26:55] Tabernacle we've always asked other
[26:57] brethren to
[27:03] speak but I had placed my S there to
[27:07] speak this
[27:09] morning in colia well in
[27:15] colia we had uh
[27:19] difficulties in departing from that
[27:22] [Music]
[27:27] country through God and brother faal
[27:30] everything was straightened out in
[27:35] time we arrived here in Phoenix on
[27:38] Thursday night in at
[27:41] midnight in col well there in
[27:46] colia we were in the city
[27:53] of they're meditating on the thought
[27:56] that the Lord's been dealing with me
[27:57] about
[28:01] the thought of the origin of
[28:08] humanity brother fa asked me if I had
[28:11] already completed that
[28:19] teaching I answered no brother we're
[28:21] just barely skimming the top of what
[28:23] we'd like to speak on
[28:27] that
[28:33] it so happens that a while back the lord
[28:36] gave us a thought which we entitled
[28:37] spiritual
[28:43] AIDS from there we were led to the
[28:46] subject the origin of
[28:51] humanity then we spoke on the thought
[28:54] flesh and
[28:57] blood
[28:59] and afterwards the thought
[29:04] identity the word identity is synonymous
[29:07] with the word
[29:16] Oneness we were able to see how a man or
[29:20] the human being when he is completely
[29:22] surrendered to God how within
[29:27] him he has part of the Sevenfold Glory
[29:30] of God's
[29:37] personage truly they seem as though they
[29:40] thoughts that that are separated or
[29:47] isolated but the only way to understand
[29:50] it is if you bring all of those thoughts
[29:52] together into
[29:55] one and I've come to the conclusion
[30:00] that man
[30:03] himself when he's totally surrendered to
[30:08] God becomes all Mighty
[30:14] sufficient sufficient in
[30:24] himself he is able to exist like self
[30:29] existent one he has within him that
[30:31] which he
[30:35] needs in speaking on this it seems as
[30:38] though it's
[30:40] heresy but I
[30:42] [Music]
[30:44] believe and that's when I'm trying to
[30:46] bring forth to the
[30:50] people as we see the example of the
[30:52] Prophet
[30:54] Daniel he was in
[30:57] captivity he did not have a brother a
[31:00] church a
[31:05] pastor he didn't have anyone else he
[31:08] didn't have a Pianist
[31:11] Guist he didn't have anyone else with
[31:16] him the Sevenfold Glory of God's
[31:19] personage
[31:22] inside and that's what kept him
[31:26] firm we you see that when God created
[31:31] man that was his
[31:36] Masterpiece man fell from the position
[31:39] that God had placed him
[31:40] in we understand these
[31:46] things he was the most precious thing
[31:48] the human is the most precious thing of
[31:50] God's
[31:51] creation there is nothing that can
[31:53] compare with
[31:55] mankind that's the most precious
[31:58] that exists
[32:01] today but man must recognize his
[32:08] calling so that he can fulfill that
[32:10] which God desires to do through
[32:13] him as we were there Ina colia in kaha
[32:21] [Music]
[32:22] Colombia the lord gave me another short
[32:26] thought
[32:28] within the same line of the origin of
[32:33] humanity and I'd like to entitle that
[32:35] thought this morning world
[32:41] champion that is my
[32:45] desire to become world
[32:52] champion I don't want to be a boxer that
[32:55] just goes to the preliminaries
[33:01] but I want to box to win
[33:04] all to be the world
[33:07] champion
[33:08] recognized
[33:12] World Nam called
[33:15] announced the world
[33:21] champion so happens that in these
[33:23] brethren in bringing forth their
[33:26] messages the scripture that they
[33:30] read or those things that they
[33:35] mentioned they were quoting my
[33:41] scriptures I would just like to draw all
[33:44] of these together and bring forth a
[33:45] short
[33:46] thought world
[33:51] champion so happens that I I hear
[33:53] different
[33:56] comments
[34:00] like for example brother if you hear so
[34:02] and so brother
[34:07] speak you shouldn't speak what that
[34:10] brother
[34:13] spoke because that's now secondhand
[34:19] religion I
[34:26] believe when our brother Prophet
[34:28] messenger of this age brought the
[34:31] message when he brought something forth
[34:34] of the word of
[34:36] God we received that
[34:39] message I believe that while it's
[34:41] something
[34:44] intellectual I believe then that it's
[34:46] secondhand
[34:48] religion and I have no right to speak
[34:51] it because then I'm preaching someone
[34:53] else's
[34:55] message but when the Revelation comes
[34:58] and it's re revealed
[35:01] personally it's no
[35:03] longer my message my word my
[35:09] Revelation no one can take
[35:11] it it's been revealed to my
[35:14] heart but as long as it's not revealed
[35:16] to your
[35:17] heart anyone can take it
[35:23] away we find that the mind is the womb
[35:27] of the SP
[35:31] Spirit the greatest battle ever fought
[35:33] takes place in the
[35:35] mind that's the
[35:38] Battleground it's through mutual
[35:43] agreement Satan and God were in
[35:48] agreement first of all to the
[35:53] Mind Satan has rights to your
[35:56] mind
[36:02] because the fight or the battle of the
[36:03] contest is Satan against God or
[36:08] God call either word or
[36:14] doubt many people many Christians are
[36:18] defeated in that
[36:20] point because they don't claim what
[36:23] there is rightfully
[36:25] there because an evil thought has come
[36:28] to their
[36:29] mind but the devil has right to or or
[36:33] the right to come to your
[36:35] mind the battle is being fought in the
[36:38] mind in the mind of each and every one
[36:40] of
[36:42] us the the fight is for the
[36:46] soul Satan wants the
[36:48] soul he wants you to doubt the word of
[36:52] God God wants you to believe the word of
[36:56] God
[36:58] you must permit the word to descend to
[37:00] the
[37:01] heart because if you confine confide in
[37:04] your mind you'll be
[37:07] defeated sooner or later you'll be
[37:11] defeated but if you permit the word to
[37:13] descend of the
[37:15] heart and if you come to a place of
[37:18] weakness in the
[37:20] mind from the
[37:22] heart the word is
[37:25] Anchor and it will surge
[37:28] and stabilize
[37:30] you because it's God in
[37:34] you the Great and Mighty
[37:39] conqueror the scripture and our brother
[37:44] say that the promise that God gave to
[37:50] Abraham was that thy seed shall possess
[37:52] the gates of thine
[37:54] enemies how many of you believe that
[37:57] when
[37:58] I believe that to be
[38:03] so possess
[38:06] complexes possess
[38:09] thoughts possess those complexes that
[38:11] come to
[38:14] me possess the thoughts that come to
[38:19] me because I should
[38:23] dominate those thoughts before I
[38:26] wrest it's not not with the ministry I
[38:29] wrestle not with you it's with
[38:33] myself because the wrestle is in the
[38:37] mind fighting for my
[38:42] soul that's why many I said the other
[38:44] day many people they get shook up when
[38:46] there's a vote or
[38:48] election they say well that's
[38:53] political the first one that that began
[38:56] the voting process was
[38:58] God free moral
[39:01] agency you vote God votes for
[39:03] you and the devil votes against
[39:07] you now it's where you vote what matters
[39:11] the Battle Is Here many
[39:13] people oh the battle is heavy the battle
[39:17] is Raging there's many Devils around me
[39:20] there's many devil Devils there there's
[39:22] no Devils there the devils are in the
[39:25] mind that's where the battle
[39:29] I want to be a world
[39:30] champion not beating the
[39:33] wind but hit the
[39:37] mark I want to possess
[39:43] complexes Prophet said
[39:47] saying God
[39:50] made manmade
[39:54] slaves when we hear this these words
[39:58] we quote them we put them a far off but
[40:02] let's bring it close to
[40:05] home God made
[40:08] man man makes himself a slave to his own
[40:13] to his own thoughts his own
[40:16] complexes the things that come against
[40:19] him he should CLE to the not doubting
[40:23] the word of God that's then a
[40:26] Slave
[40:28] the message
[40:29] says there were many
[40:34] slaves and there was one that didn't
[40:36] behave much like a
[40:40] slave you heard heard them say around
[40:43] well he doesn't act like a
[40:50] slave he doesn't act like a slave
[40:53] because he is the son of a
[40:56] king
[40:59] people let themselves to be drawn by
[41:04] slavery there are people that are slaves
[41:06] to
[41:07] liquor other slaves to
[41:13] drugs they're tried to educate him out
[41:15] of
[41:17] drugs they've tried to educate them out
[41:19] of
[41:21] liquor other are others are slaves to
[41:25] hate to of Wrath
[41:27] and so many other
[41:30] things the only way we can become slaves
[41:33] is if it comes to the mind the thought
[41:36] for and it captures
[41:38] you you did not capture the
[41:42] thought the incorrect thought captured
[41:45] you a slave
[41:49] then people that get so mad they can't
[41:51] dominate it they're slaves of that wrath
[41:55] slaves of that wrath
[42:00] I want you to be a world
[42:03] champion the battle is at
[42:05] home can you accept
[42:09] that let's open the word for a
[42:13] bit First Corinthians chapter
[42:17] 9 verses 26 and
[42:21] 27 you know more or less where I'm
[42:25] heading um getting to
[42:32] home if you can understand it you shall
[42:35] be
[42:37] Crown not just as a
[42:40] preliminary but a world
[42:43] champion verse 26 of chapter 9 of First
[42:49] Corinthians therefore so
[42:53] run I not as
[42:56] uncertainly so fight
[42:59] I not as one that beateth the
[43:04] air brother brother spoke to
[43:08] us not one that's just beating at the
[43:11] wind the air
[43:14] no but I keep my
[43:19] body so the body the the the the punches
[43:23] are to the
[43:26] body brother said last
[43:30] night Paul wanted to defeat his worst en
[43:34] is that
[43:36] right his worst enemy is Bernie
[43:39] Garcia that's
[43:43] my so I don't want to beat the
[43:47] wind so you can understand me that
[43:49] beating the wind beating brother V
[43:52] brother Bernie
[43:53] jto or brother
[43:56] VTO brother said
[43:58] so I want to beat
[44:03] myself where the body shots are
[44:08] two I bring my
[44:13] body bringing it unto
[44:17] subjection there are
[44:21] two the Bible talks a bit about the
[44:24] outer or carnal man and
[44:29] the whenever you go both of them
[44:33] walk always thinking
[44:37] Beyond like those drivers that are
[44:39] always with the high
[44:41] be looking Way Beyond but let's bring
[44:44] him
[44:45] glow the fight is not the fight is close
[44:50] in your own
[44:54] person and we thought on the on what the
[44:57] poet
[44:59] said the whole congregation can Beed
[45:03] pastor and
[45:05] everyone but if God has placed you there
[45:08] for you to be a
[45:09] light no matter if everyone's wrong you
[45:13] should
[45:14] stay to be the light of the world there
[45:18] place to be a light you see brother I
[45:22] sincerely
[45:23] believe that the
[45:25] message not brought to
[45:28] it was brought so we can know who we
[45:32] are the most precious thing that
[45:34] exist the human
[45:37] being let's turn to Romans R Romans the
[45:41] sth
[45:42] chapter verse
[45:47] 24 when I read it I apply it to
[45:50] myself and as you read it apply it to
[45:54] yourself don't apply it to someone else
[45:59] oh Wretched Man that I
[46:03] am who shall deliver me from the body of
[46:06] this
[46:09] death I thank God through Jesus Christ
[46:12] Our
[46:15] Lord so then with the mind I myself
[46:17] serve the law of
[46:21] God but with the flesh the law of
[46:25] sin the brother spoke to us concerning
[46:29] the rules of the law of the
[46:35] game here Paul is saying I myself with
[46:38] the Mind serve the law of God because
[46:41] the mind to that womb
[46:45] here is where God and the devil
[46:48] come and it's so
[46:51] difficult that I can't tell the
[46:53] difference many
[46:55] times I can't guide myself with my mind
[47:00] but my mind with the mind I the law of
[47:05] God the law of God which is his word
[47:08] what the word of God
[47:10] says I must anchor it in
[47:13] my whatever the word of God says is what
[47:17] I will
[47:18] do many people say I do this because
[47:21] that's what I feel like
[47:25] doing I didn't feel like going to the
[47:29] service but if you investigate
[47:35] yourself I didn't go because I didn't
[47:37] feel like going to serice if he would
[47:40] investigate
[47:41] himself he will find that he's a
[47:44] prisoner no matter what he say from what
[47:46] he
[47:48] shouts thought has
[47:52] dominated when a
[47:54] person permits the law of God
[47:57] the word of God to guide
[48:00] him he will go where God said go honor
[48:05] me when you go to the house of
[48:09] God to hear for the word of God says
[48:12] that but my thought my
[48:15] complexes don't let me run ey because I
[48:17] see this brother I see that brother I
[48:20] see the minister I see the
[48:24] preacher my complexes have given
[48:29] Flav but if I do not let my mind govern
[48:33] me but the law of God then I'll have
[48:37] Victory and become a world
[48:40] champion but with the
[48:43] flesh the law
[48:51] of we already know what the symptoms or
[48:54] the fruits of the flesh are
[48:58] so unto the law of
[49:03] sin the law says do you not understand
[49:06] that an adulterer
[49:08] not that's the fruit of the
[49:11] flesh but the word of God says this do
[49:14] not commit
[49:16] adultery the flesh wants to draw of
[49:20] that the the law of sin of Flesh says
[49:24] but the law of God says no I want to
[49:27] smoke
[49:28] for and they're so bold in that to say
[49:32] this the messenger said I smoke all I
[49:35] want I drink all I want but since he
[49:39] didn't want he
[49:41] didn't he'd come to another
[49:44] stage but when we're still in the
[49:47] flesh even when we accept Jesus Christ
[49:50] Still In the
[49:51] [Music]
[49:53] Flesh drugs and so much other
[49:55] things serving the
[49:59] flesh with the flesh the law of sin
[50:02] don't be drunken don't
[50:06] get law of
[50:09] sin but when we're free from those
[50:11] things I have no need of
[50:14] them I know that's not my
[50:17] own which is
[50:20] mine but as long as I
[50:24] am that I serve the the flesh with the
[50:27] law
[50:30] said we're not
[50:32] religious that's why when you come to
[50:34] the Lord I don't tell you you can't
[50:37] smoke you can't drink you can't Comm you
[50:41] can't do this that the word of God will
[50:43] speak to you and bring those things to
[50:46] you you want to smoke
[50:48] smoke you smoke a cigarette a cigar I
[50:53] come to you and I embrace you
[50:57] oh I I take him out no you didn't take
[51:00] me
[51:01] out because I'm not the one fighting you
[51:04] nether am I going to judge
[51:06] you the word of God
[51:09] judges you must be judged by the
[51:12] word and say Lord I want to
[51:16] smoke I made a
[51:18] covenant
[51:20] baptizing and even though I
[51:22] want I'm going to
[51:25] subject fory flesh to the LA did not
[51:28] stop smoking
[51:33] iify the
[51:41] flesh myself in the room and say Lord
[51:43] take it away I don't want to be a to
[51:47] this take that desire away make me free
[51:51] me I beat my body I beat my own
[51:55] body Serv for you
[51:58] Lord because I want to be a world
[52:01] champion first John
[52:07] 44 people that don't know
[52:10] me that they have not heard me
[52:15] before maybe they think well poor
[52:19] Pastor he's just starting
[52:23] out that's why he can't bring the de
[52:29] teachings you can know all the
[52:34] Mysteries the
[52:36] T the of the son
[52:38] of the heavens the New Jerusalem the
[52:43] Millennium the Rapture over all
[52:47] things but if you don't overcome your
[52:49] own self you will be
[52:51] defeated the main
[52:55] thing
[52:57] we Pro that in the scriptures when we
[52:59] speak spoke on the message
[53:03] identity that we didn't not know our own
[53:06] selves but it was
[53:09] promised that one day he would manifest
[53:12] himself and we would know him as he
[53:15] is and see him face to
[53:18] face and knowing him as he
[53:21] is we would know our
[53:25] own you can find that
[53:29] in 1 John 32
[53:33] Corinthians
[53:37] 139 if you don't
[53:39] understand go to the message
[53:42] identity I did not know myself I was a
[53:46] religious man a
[53:48] preacher a Son of a
[53:50] Preacher Brother of a
[53:52] Preacher brother-in-law of preacher
[53:56] Uncle of
[53:57] preachers all
[53:58] around but I didn't know my own
[54:01] self because I didn't know him look at
[54:05] him as looking
[54:08] Darkly looking at myself as
[54:11] Darkly but one day the veil was torn
[54:14] open and the seals were
[54:16] open the messenger spoke
[54:20] to Mighty God unveiled before
[54:23] us the revealed
[54:25] word through
[54:28] that the time came when he
[54:31] said now you know me
[54:34] son now know
[54:37] thyself when I began to learn about my
[54:40] own
[54:42] self saw the message completely
[54:46] different seeing it different than when
[54:48] I preached it for 19
[54:50] years I thought before that the gospel
[54:54] the message been
[54:57] given to show the whole
[54:59] world all of the
[55:01] Mysteries 70 weeks of
[55:03] Daniel whatever Min Ministry was there
[55:06] and preaching it and I taught it but all
[55:09] of
[55:10] that after all of that I place my
[55:14] eyes around the world and no people
[55:16] don't even know who they are what it
[55:19] is what's the greatest mystery is deity
[55:23] and without
[55:24] deity you can't get to
[55:28] Second not God above us not God With
[55:32] Us God in
[55:35] us that's the hope of
[55:37] glory in you so that
[55:41] you can fight against the the satanic
[55:45] Wild for the fight is not in
[55:48] church the battle is in the
[55:53] mind first John
[55:55] 44
[56:00] once again I feel L to repeat that
[56:06] slowly it doesn't make any difference
[56:09] what
[56:11] subject the preacher stands up to
[56:14] preach and people
[56:20] become when people leave a
[56:23] church the first thing they say is
[56:25] nothing but hyp
[56:28] it doesn't make any difference to me if
[56:29] I'm surrounded by complete
[56:31] hypocrit it's who am I am I a
[56:36] hypoc am I sincere with
[56:39] God have I had a a meeting with God have
[56:43] I received
[56:45] him if I I have received he's given me
[56:49] power according to the
[56:51] Bible not to the Min to
[56:55] me and that received
[56:57] him he gave
[57:00] power to become the sons of God he gave
[57:03] me then
[57:04] power so I could become a Son of God not
[57:08] to run to someone else myself and
[57:12] dominate myself my thoughts and my
[57:14] complexes and my feelings to the word of
[57:18] God the word burst forth and a son of
[57:22] God comes forth because our mother is
[57:25] the word
[57:28] we are sculptured to the
[57:31] word the word is how does he we hear the
[57:36] word J by the
[57:38] word we
[57:40] are through the word and with
[57:45] bur Son of God from mother which is the
[57:50] word and the spirit is waiting for to
[57:53] enter that
[57:54] body so don't tell me
[57:57] that you think it's the
[57:59] Revelation the great
[58:02] Revelation the greatest Revelation is
[58:05] that's what the messenger
[58:06] say without the Revelation reation de
[58:10] you can't get to second
[58:12] base is that
[58:16] right first John
[58:25] 44
[58:30] ye are of God little children and have
[58:33] overcome them because greater is he that
[58:35] is in you than he that is in the
[58:38] world can you say
[58:40] Amen who have we
[58:43] overcome the
[58:47] spirits spirits and thoughts come to the
[58:51] mind let me just say this again I don't
[58:54] know why I mention it
[58:56] but just listen
[58:58] closely the messenger
[59:00] said in this
[59:03] age there's a
[59:05] bride a pure
[59:08] virgin that stays with every word that
[59:11] proceedes out of the mouth is that what
[59:13] he
[59:14] said but a spirit
[59:17] comes and
[59:19] says don't believe
[59:22] it Maliah 4 is all mixed
[59:28] the ministers the the Ley everyone's
[59:31] just a bunch of Lies Liars but take
[59:34] hold with the law of
[59:37] God says there's a
[59:40] virgin
[59:42] somewhere a raptured
[59:44] people people that are going to accept
[59:46] the word and you Lo direct
[59:49] Yourself by that law to
[59:53] overcome lying spirit
[59:56] come depart from

[1:00:38] Jacob Jacob could not face his brother

[1:00:44] face his brother right until he got into
[1:00:47] desperation when he got I can't go to my
[1:00:55] brother

[1:01:00] him the birth that I had Lord because he
[1:01:03] been born he had the the birth right

[1:01:56] in
[1:01:57] you is
[1:02:00] greater than he that is in the
[1:02:04] world returning again to the message
[1:02:09] identity I know you thought it was a
[1:02:11] very nice
[1:02:13] message many told me oh what a nice
[1:02:16] message and when I said that when they
[1:02:18] said that I said to myself they didn't

[1:06:30] world the love of the father is not in

[1:07:26] when that Ang
[1:07:27] came to
[1:07:29] Daniel that from the first
[1:07:33] day God sent but I couldn't

[1:08:40] aded he'll say this is
[1:08:43] my
[1:08:46] ye Tru he's become a world
[1:08:51] champion my last thought
[1:08:54] now this is what the Devil comes to your
[1:08:57] mind to
[1:08:59] say if this is Maliah
[1:09:03] 4 I'd rather go back to my
[1:09:07] denomination without knowing
[1:09:11] it we're confessing that we're still
[1:09:13] denomination a
[1:09:15] personal
[1:09:18] denomination thousands of personal
[1:09:22] denominations
[1:09:24] ideas
[1:09:26] and they return to their own
[1:09:28] denomination maybe not church one man
[1:09:30] one man
[1:09:33] denomination one man
[1:09:37] denomination the thought the thoughts
[1:09:38] come here the
[1:09:41] wrestling I believe the word how many
[1:09:44] believe the
[1:09:45] word if I look at myself in the mirror
[1:09:48] and see that I'm a
[1:09:49] hypocrite and my
[1:09:52] brothers and all my
[1:09:54] congregation
[1:09:56] if I look at myself that
[1:09:58] way say you're a hypocrite that minister
[1:10:01] is a
[1:10:02] hypocrite the congregation hypocrite but
[1:10:05] there is
[1:10:07] somewhere people called by surrendered
[1:10:10] to the word because the word
[1:10:13] can confess the truth the word is not fa
[1:10:18] forming and presenting
[1:10:22] Sons but the sons must accept
[1:10:26] that the battle is in
[1:10:32] them for 20 years
[1:10:34] almost I've been preaching this
[1:10:39] message I know that the devil tears you
[1:10:44] to
[1:10:45] pieces by coming
[1:10:48] here and when he comes to your mind he
[1:10:51] makes you
[1:10:52] doubt that you're of God
[1:10:56] first of
[1:10:57] all God gave him
[1:11:01] permission to the devil to come to your
[1:11:04] mind God
[1:11:07] [Music]
[1:11:11] said there's going to be a match a
[1:11:15] fight you and
[1:11:18] I no one else you and
[1:11:21] I very
[1:11:23] well where will the match be in in
[1:11:27] England in
[1:11:30] Japan United
[1:11:32] [Music]
[1:11:33] States a mutual
[1:11:37] agreement had a mutual
[1:11:41] agreement the match will be in the mind
[1:11:45] of
[1:11:47] man and we'll fight for his soul from
[1:11:52] there the devil says I'll present my
[1:11:56] wisdom which is doubting the word of
[1:12:00] God God said okay
[1:12:03] present and I'll present my word as a
[1:12:06] reality and
[1:12:08] that's but since the Devil
[1:12:10] comes and since you thought the
[1:12:14] evil if you were a Son of God you
[1:12:17] wouldn't have thought
[1:12:19] that is that
[1:12:21] right and answer him devil
[1:12:27] I found my
[1:12:28] identity I know that I come from
[1:12:31] God these evil thoughts are not my own
[1:12:35] take them
[1:12:36] [Applause]
[1:12:38] back
[1:12:39] resist the devil in
[1:12:42] faith resist him in Revelation and he
[1:12:46] will flee from you not to his
[1:12:49] people
[1:12:52] inth
[1:12:54] you
[1:12:56] ration of the
[1:12:57] word maybe I was a
[1:13:00] drunk drug ad maybe I
[1:13:04] was but now
[1:13:07] I'm the blood of the
[1:13:09] Lamb
[1:13:11] cleansed but remember you did that do
[1:13:14] you remember devil yes I
[1:13:17] remember it was a
[1:13:21] revelation but God doesn't he doesn't
[1:13:24] remember that
[1:13:26] but the devil wants you to remember so
[1:13:28] that you'll vote for and don't vote for
[1:13:30] him resist him in and claim what's yours
[1:13:35] close your
[1:13:36] eyes
[1:13:39] anyone help
[1:13:45] quickly
[1:13:47] father your
[1:13:49] [Music]
[1:13:51] children
[1:13:53] extend that hand of faith
[1:13:57] to resist the devil in
[1:14:01] faith put the battle
[1:14:04] forward that atomic bomb that
[1:14:08] Revelation and the devil can't draw
