[31:31] overcame and been sat down with my
[31:32] father in his throne

[31:41] spirit says unto the churches
[31:47] to your heavenly father Celestial all
[31:51] right thank you for letting us together

[31:54] thank you because we have a place

[32:04] online
[32:05] I ask that you may anoint my lips
[32:12] will you help me maybe that me and we
[32:14] also help my interpret as well
[32:16] this is all for the benefit of your
[32:18] people
[32:19] so I ask you all these things
[32:25] amen I'm
[32:28] as you can see we're still talking about
[32:31] the topic of how can I overcome
[32:35] and that's the scripture we just read
[32:38] you know it's it's a message to the
[32:41] Larissa age
[32:42] [Music]
[32:44] not just that it's a message to the
[32:46] Overcomers
[32:49] um
[32:50] [Music]
[32:53] was an age that needed rebuking
[32:59] um
[33:01] and it's also he also says it's the
[33:04] grandest of all the churches
[33:06] you know it's the greatest sinful age
[33:10] you know this age has more sin than
[33:12] there has ever been
[33:14] okay
[33:18] it's many times harder to fight now
[33:22] we spoke on last time
[33:25] no this being the the most difficult age
[33:28] but yet God chose us to be in this way
[33:32] what does God think about us
[33:34] no you could have been in other ages
[33:37] but God chose you to be in this area
[33:40] you know something interesting
[33:44] um a while ago we're having Fellowship
[33:47] here behind the church
[33:49] you know we had a youth activity
[33:53] and we were asking each other questions
[33:56] and one of the questions was you know if
[33:59] you could talk to any character in The
[34:01] Bible yes
[34:05] some people said you know Enoch and some
[34:09] people said job and other people
[34:11] mentioned other characters that they
[34:12] would want to talk
[34:15] but what I found interesting
[34:17] was what one brother said you know we
[34:21] would want to ask them questions
[34:23] but they would want to do the same
[34:26] foreign
[35:45] but you take as much Darkness as you
[35:48] want to and try to stand against light
[35:49] one time see what happened
[35:52] foreign
[36:52] and we repeat it all the time and I
[36:55] think it's worth repeating to overcome
[36:57] is to stand the test
[37:00] but what is a test so a general
[37:04] definition for a test
[37:06] you know it's a procedure intended to
[37:09] establish the quality
[37:13] performance or reliability of something
[37:17] especially before it's taken into
[37:19] widespread use
[37:23] so for example you know when we buy a
[37:25] car
[37:26] before that car can be sold
[37:29] it has to be tested you know is it safe
[37:33] enough to write to drive on the road
[37:37] you know also when we buy any type of
[37:39] Technology
[37:41] you know it has to be tested to see if
[37:44] it's safe for the consumers
[37:47] you know and that's the same for us
[37:50] no God wants to test us see
[38:04] am I somebody who when I have a trial so
[38:07] yeah am I going to run we have a weed
[38:10] where am I somebody who's going to stand
[38:12] firm also
[38:13] that's why the Trials Come yes and we're
[38:16] expected to be tested
[38:20] and how can I overcome
[38:25] he says no now we're expected to be
[38:27] tested
[38:28] that's a good lesson for my brother back
[38:31] there also
[38:33] he says
[38:40] it says with the word he says that's
[38:44] God's test
[38:46] do you believe it is
[38:52] come into God must be tested
[38:56] says that only shows a true child then
[38:59] see be tested
[39:03] he says and you can't overcome unless
[39:05] there's a test to give to you
[39:08] and when Tess is given it's to see
[39:11] whether you can overcome or not
[39:14] and Jesus said to him that overcometh
[39:17] the test Jesus
[39:19] and here is once again a key that
[39:21] brother Benham gives us
[39:23] he says the test is the greatest thing
[39:25] that ever happened to you
[39:29] I believe it's written in the scripture
[39:32] Peter said that our trials are worth
[39:35] more than precious gold
[39:39] so it says it's a testing time
[39:42] and here's another good key yes
[39:45] it's one good evidence to us that God is
[39:48] with us
[39:52] because when we're tested is for all
[39:55] children of God are tested and tried
[39:59] so we have to expect to be tested as
[40:03] long as we're on the earth
[40:06] we're always going to be tested
[40:08] but what do we have to overcome
[40:11] you know we overcome the things of the
[40:13] world
[40:14] we find that the hardest thing to
[40:16] overcome
[40:18] is to overcome ourselves
[40:24] the thing you have to overcome is
[40:26] yourself
[40:30] you have to surrender to yourself to him
[40:33] he overcome for you he knows the way
[40:39] you know that's the hardest thing to do
[40:41] is overcome yourself
[40:43] you can see all these you know famous
[40:45] artists
[40:46] and all these famous people you know who
[40:49] are successful they conquered their
[40:52] career foreign
[41:52] foreign
[42:32] that will defeat Satan that has never
[42:34] been nothing on this Earth that would
[42:36] ever defeat Satan like the word of God
[42:42] here he tells us you know the best thing
[42:45] we can use is
[42:46] the word of God you know Jesus used it
[42:50] in his great battle he said it is
[42:51] written Jesus
[42:56] that you just give him the word
[42:58] and that he can't stand it
[43:01] the devil can't stand he says because
[43:04] it's inspired
[43:06] but what's another tool that we can use
[43:10] we have the Holy Ghost we have the Holy
[43:14] Spirit you know but what is the Holy
[43:16] Ghost no I don't know too much
[43:20] tells us you know what it is
[43:23] he says the holy ghost that it's a power
[43:26] he says
[43:28] he says that it's a comforter he says
[43:31] it's a sign
[44:27] and
[44:31] because of
[44:54] no we're Sinners we were found guilty
[44:57] foreign
[45:32] say
[46:32] it's your Resurrection
[46:33] he said it's all that God has for you
[46:37] he's an advocate and I'm happy for that
[46:41] advocate
[46:42] in paragraph 62.
[46:45] we could go into details with that and
[46:47] break that down
[46:52] of how that when it makes intercessions
[46:55] for our ignorance
[46:59] no he intercedes for our ignorance
[47:04] it tells us that he takes our place
[47:09] but because God loved us he sent
[47:12] somebody who took our place and now here
[47:16] we are yeah we are tonight
[47:18] and then he goes on you see he says the
[47:22] holy spirit is there to make an advocate
[47:23] for us
[47:25] he is our attorney
[47:32] he stands there and pleats for us
[47:36] if we don't plead for ourselves
[47:38] because the Holy Ghost in his pleats for
[47:41] us
[47:44] it's not us that please
[47:47] it's the holy ghost that please for us
[47:50] it intercedes for us so the holy spirit
[47:54] is giving utterance sometimes with words
[47:56] you can't understand
[48:00] what was it uh it's the last part 62.
[48:04] no Santo
[48:07] in in
[48:09] sometimes you can't understand and he
[48:11] makes interests for us
[48:14] that's the Holy Ghost is
[48:17] 63. this is when I walk into anything
[48:21] I walk like a little kid
[48:24] you walk like a little fellow
[48:27] we we're walking in a dark world full of
[48:29] enemies
[48:33] full of traps full of everything
[48:37] he said oh I'm afraid I'm afraid to take
[48:41] that Christian Life
[48:43] you know and how many of us I've ever
[48:46] been afraid to take that Christian Life
[48:49] I can raise my hand every time I've been
[48:52] afraid to take the Christian Life
[48:54] he says I'm afraid to do this
[48:57] I'm afraid I'll do this
[49:35] you know because if it wasn't for that
[49:37] act foreign
[50:00] and so I'm glad we have an advocate
[50:02] but why do we need an advocate
[50:05] because there's an accuser you know
[50:08] there's always somebody who accuses and
[50:11] then there's always a Defender you know
[50:13] and I like when I was up here where my
[50:14] brother
[50:15] and he told us you know let's not accuse
[50:18] each other
[50:19] no let's show Grace towards each other
[50:22] because he said there's already an
[50:24] accuser
[50:26] and there is an accuser no it's the
[50:29] devil you know and brother Bernie you
[50:32] know the message understanding me
[50:34] no he talks about how he accuses
[50:38] and he says that the devil is going to
[50:42] accuse you before the Deacon
[50:45] not before the pastor Del Pastor no
[50:48] brother Bernie tells us he says he comes
[50:51] to you and accuses you directly
[50:54] so he comes directly to you and he
[50:58] accuses
[51:08] some people might say you know he comes
[51:10] to church and accuses you
[51:12] he says not even there he says he comes
[51:15] directly in front of the throne
[51:19] he says he stands there to accuse you
[51:22] but on the other side you have God
[51:25] backing you up
[51:27] and once again
[51:30] you know he wants to remind you because
[51:33] that's what happens with us we have a
[51:34] memory
[51:35] we remember those bad things we did
[51:38] no we're forgiven but the Devil comes
[51:42] back and reminds us
[51:45] he's just like that mouth that you
[51:47] praise the Lord with
[51:49] you I mean um
[51:53] he's like you curse with that amount and
[51:56] he comes and he accuses us we have to
[51:58] remember
[52:00] foreign
[52:23] you know how can I overcome you know
[52:26] another word for overcome
[52:28] you know could be conquered you know how
[52:31] can we conquer ourselves
[52:33] how can we conquer the things that come
[52:35] against us
[52:37] another example that brother Brandon
[52:39] gives
[52:40] you know is of Napoleon Napoleon you
[52:44] know that he was a great conqueror you
[52:46] know that people feared him
[52:48] he says that at night or the moms you
[52:54] know what they would tell their kids no
[52:56] they wouldn't tell them the boogeyman's
[52:57] Gonna Get You
[52:59] Napoleon's gonna get you and he said
[53:02] that they would be scared
[53:03] because he was such a terrible man
[53:06] but he overcame all these things but in
[53:10] the end he couldn't overcome himself
[53:13] he died due to his alcoholism
[53:19] and so here we are in Romans 31
[53:25] says what shall we then say to these
[53:28] things if God be for us then who can be
[53:30] against us is
[53:34] he that spared not his own son but
[53:37] delivered him up for us all how shall he
[53:40] not with him also freely give us all
[53:42] things
[53:49] who shall lay anything to charge of
[53:52] God's elect it is God that justifies
[54:00] you see that condemneth it is Christ
[54:02] that died year rather that is risen
[54:04] again who is even at the right hand of
[54:06] God who also maketh intercession for us
[54:16] once again it's telling us right there
[54:18] who makes an intercession for us
[54:22] next one is who shall separate us from
[54:25] the love of Christ shall tribulations or
[54:27] distress or persecutions or famine or
[54:30] nakedness or Peril or sword
[54:39] as it is written for thy sake we are
[54:42] killed all the day long we are accounted
[54:44] as sheep for the
[54:46] slaughtered
[54:50] and here's one of the verses that I
[54:52] really like
[54:54] he says and all these things we are more
[54:57] than conquerors through him that loved
[54:59] us
[55:03] so we're not just conquerors
[55:13] you'd want to give us that Advocate
[55:16] because he loved us
[55:19] for I am persuaded that neither death
[55:21] nor life nor angels nor principalities
[55:24] nor powers nor things present nor things
[55:26] to come
[55:33] foreign there's no height nor death nor
[55:37] any other creature shall be able to
[55:39] separate us from the love of God which
[55:40] is in Christ Jesus our lord
[55:49] so what can separate us from the love of
[55:51] God
[55:53] nothing nothing but we can overcome we
[55:57] have to take God at his word
[55:59] use the two he's given us
[56:02] and if we fall is
[56:07] that we have an advocate
[56:14] once again I thank you all for being
[56:16] here this evening
