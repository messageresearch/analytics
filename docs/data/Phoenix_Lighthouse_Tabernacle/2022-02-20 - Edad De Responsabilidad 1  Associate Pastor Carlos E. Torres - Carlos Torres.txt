name of the lord jesus christ amen amen amen and amen before anything else we're going to go directly into this while we're standing [Music] if you want to write them down hebrews 9 11. reach the following but christ being come and high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not immediately hands that is to say not of this building you know sangre de machos cabrillo neither by the blood of goats and calves by his own blood he entered once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us for the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of the heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctified to the purifying of the flesh and how much more shall the blood of christ whom through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god virtual conscience from death works to serve the living god amen amen bless everyone you may be seated in la casa del signora it's good to sing songs until the lord and to come together our praise together so they can bring the sacrifice of praise together bless everyone once again the brothers that are watching through the internet colorado our pastor already told us the complete plan of redemption of bringing this title this it's a secret repetition you're going to repeat the same thing not necessarily but it all gets to a certain point to be able to understand or say one thing it's not enough for us or to read the the devil has known that secretary sanchez and he has bombarded our minds one and another with so many other things because he has understood what the secret of repetition is we as christians instead of getting advantage of this [Music] the whole planet of redemption it covers a lot uh we've heard our pastor for a long time [Music] [Music] around this time we shouldn't know what the scripture says without even read many times from this pulpit we can't separate the ministry of the ministry of the end time revelations this is something very important that we should understand that in this time prophet god sent the prophet madum professor [Music] but by every word that proceeded out of a man of the of knowledge is the awakening of your conscience when you come to the message there's an awakening to see who who we really are and when we wake up is when we open up the scene in revelations in the days of the boys when he shall begin to sound let me tell it shall make the belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey [Music] this is where the problem is our job is to he knew that his name was written but how did john know that his name was when he eats up the book so when he ate up the book what does it mean to eat i asked someone the other day what is it it's what does it mean to eat up the little book it could mean this it couldn't mean that but i'm not really sure because someone's you know i told him we've mentioned mentioned this so many times racist we've preached so many times we should understand that this is important [Music] la puerta [Music] and the ones that are here that wasn't here during that period the door of grace opens up but they have to walk l is [Music] there's mental sickness taking control of the people because the struggle now is a spiritual spirituality the struggle comes to your mind it comes to your mind knowing that we're in the la russia churches so that we can escape in one way or another god speaks to a loudest church in revelations i know that works neither are you hot or cold you've said i've gotten rich miserable poor blind and naked and don't know you [Music] the problem comes in we want to hide it we're not gonna face this we're gonna put it aside if we have that attitude then we're wretched lisa we see this age that we live in the the age of pressing a button the push button and yet people have less time to pray than they ever did have hey oh in this modern times they used to sit all night and listen to a sermon and we and now we just can't do it we haven't got time to do it [Music] it's just in our head we think we haven't have time [Music] the prophet tells us that this age is wretched [Music] the opportunity rejecting god's grace the devil won't get you away from the church [Music] he's going to let you sit here but not go forward the grace is [Music] this it takes us to a scripture in matthew 7 24. description is therefore whosoever hear this saying saying of mine and do with them i like them i liken him and to a wise man which built his house upon iraq and rain descended the floods came the winds blew and beat upon the house and it fell not for it was founded upon iraq and everyone that hear this sayings of mine and do with them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his cells upon the sand and rain descended the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon the house and it fell and the great was the fall of it is speaking of laura the condition the condition of the eggs how and he brings up the scripture here and he tells us this age has built upon quicksand then we see that the wise man he built this house upon a rock but the foolish built upon the sand possible and the image that probably comes to our mind is this image here there's a rock there on the highest and he's built his house but in reality there's not the image that we're trying to project was speaking to people that knew his customs that's what it seems like this is this is lucas looks 646 tells us why call me lord lord and do not the things which i say jesus when jesus spoke in this parable yeah he just preached the sermon on the mountain he began to bring and he tells him straight off what are you going to do what i just had just preached whosoever commits to me and heareth my saying and do with them i will show you to whom he is like he that comes to me he comes and eats up the book he makes them he does better in that belly i must forgive one i don't want to forgive he is like a man which built in a house and dig it deep and laid the foundation on a rock and when the flats arose the stream controller and when he found the rocket fundamentals there he plays this fundamental foundation it began to build so we have two builders now unused no important questions doesn't matter who you are no important doesn't matter how old are you familiar no matter what family the storm is a time [Music] [Music] a few years ago i was in new york and new york with the birth and how it would look and we got to there to the buildings the surprise was that he had completely almost finished it but it was just just left there no one um occupied it i asked the man who which i was with what's the problem que pasa what's wrong that he forgot to dig deep enough to search for the foundation she was so worried how the building was going to look like what the building was going to have inside fundamental correctness he for him to come to our heart and we want him to come but we don't have a foundation and of the holy spirit [Music] allow me to say this with respects to the lord jesus it doesn't matter how regular you go to church unless you've taken the time today to that foundation of jesus christ and place your hopes on that solid rock those beautiful buildings everything else that's all that's all right that's fine but all this will crumble the eternal rock which is jesus christ now the prophet turns the corner here and he says and we are starting off for god fundamental don't build upon any false foundation what happened with this evil he based [Music] [Music] we're making the wrong decisions right this is a key it says here discipline discipline here is your heart the one that built it found it foolishly stayed on the surface only in the deepest part of his home foreign our life is ventilated by different emotions that we have hate comes into our life anger comes into our life [Music] significant fundamental it means that there's no foundation fundamentals falsehood your foundation is false oh you obviously persona oh i hate that person you all knew i'm his father so i can't take care of you i hate my parents i've heard people honor them and respect that's not taking responsibility enough attention to you not the complaint that's why you wanted to pull that's what you wanted to talk about those three things until but as when you find a child doing something wrong full of chocolate oh it's all it wasn't me it was my brother my brother we're trying to blame [Music] all my parents we're responsible in changing it anytime we blame our traumas and complexes there are things that happen in life traumas happen we do understand it's a personal decision [Music] their financial situation for the katrina hurricanes that happened so long ago it was katrina's a hurricane that ruined my life trying to blame something that it's you can't control when a person said excuse us when a person begins to make excuses because they know with them themselves that he could have changed the situation [Music] i have [Music] have more oxygen than other people a complicado he had a complex because of that because of that reason he would always put himself isolated he would always isolate himself he started off with a complex then he was depressed diablo get the take him [Music] is i want you to be the one there on the bench i want you the buses you can no one likes you anymore it's a habit we must practice daily happiness is within me [Music] i love enthusiasm i love that word you know what was your loss i'm just going to say it quickly the meaning of this word the griego from the creek is foreign regards is
