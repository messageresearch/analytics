pleasure and an honor it's an honor and a pleasure to come and serve the lord jesus christ surrender he's still [Music] i have nothing against and because he was hollering many times right i want people to see what he was trying to say and then i heard a great man an apostle and i heard a person say a commentary and he said you're listening to the guy that likes to holler a lot but it was the technology that we had in that time period fill more church an iglesia del fillmore was a high type two-story building very small the acoustics we had just so you'll know was a little cassette how many remember those little portable cassette players put one in here he would actually sit in the back in this little room back here and he would be recording brother bernie what brother bernie said here back there i can barely but if you speak with brother bernie so i just wanted to share that with you nothing against anyone [Music] it's happening so fast we don't have time kids don't have time to blink because then their families are separating and this is why i'm bringing what i'm bringing is because of what is happening in this world today now if you'll turn with me to ephesians 6 11 we're going to read the scripture if you'll stand with me we're going to pray ephesians 6 11. it reads as follows if you'll hit the first slide please put on the whole armor of god that ye may be able to withstand against the wiles of the devil diablo for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand firm heavenly father we know we're living in the civil age a time where there's ambushes just waiting for us traps you know our questions were fairly simple how many of us have been recruit recruited as soldiers that have been recruited some soldiers that are not recruits anymore mature in the gospel we also said that a soldier needs to be trained and how many of us have been trained i'm not sure what time we wake up but if you're in the military you're up at 5 30. 5 30 you're ready to go john wesley had already preached the message [Music] we want to sleep an hour more quest i'm tired you know i've been tired all my life at an old age i have to take vitamins vitamin we've all reasoned for one reason or another tosa i take vitamin f a lot i need it every day you know the vitamins i take my wife looks at me and says oh those are them is you know what gummy bears are i mean i can chew them and i pop them every so often but i like f gummy bear f how many of you take yes f is faith f i need some faith this morning i missed that gummy hoping that i received it's the substance we hope for but we're willing till we receive it when we receive it we're so happy what about us i mean i need a job i don't you know think i'd die if i got a job this is a 24-hour job but we wait for the right job and it doesn't come in vienna i'm waiting for if i wasn't married we want everything put in the microwave wanted to be and that's where we come in just because i go to barber school and i've graduated does that make me a barber no no this is what i love about barbers because remember they're trained we're talking about trains this is a barber they don't look at your shoes right barbers don't look at shoes you know cut your hair how did you know yes danny cut your hair huh yeah is that the right word i don't know it just came out who butchered [Music] now when he was 48 what year was it born in 1909. now i want to know i'm 48 years old now all right let me look at this 48 1957 thank you this is 1957. i know you don't get is that 41 okay if i'm in the united states uh 21. jesus christ what happened what do you mean what happened but if i'm 16. i'm gonna say 119. but when brother branham was 48 seconded in 1957. you went around the world for the lord jesus christ but here he said i haven't done anything something yes how many of us have been commissioned as soldiers you see i look at like this young man he has a future in the ministry i see many young men with the same caliber that they've been called by god but what needs to happen what and that's sometimes what we don't understand yeah you might have called us just to thank the brother for something if he has something in store for you yeah well i played a saxophone saxophone trombone um i think that's it the violin now let me tell you something you know how they say you ride a bicycle once and you never forget that's a lot he said yes or no look we talked last week on attacks how message believers for whatever reason we'll go on a web page and start looking at what has been said against our prophets and i like to read that stuff i don't know why when people look in into these web pages and before you know it you're doing something you normally wouldn't do no we failed to understand that the greatest holy spirit correct so do me a favor so i tell you like this tell us why they say that just pray solo wouldn't in these type of web pages internet now was brother branham ever ambushed before how many times was brother branham i was ambushed in chicago and moscato in chicago yes or no no so it wasn't the first time his own friends his own colleagues would come up to him oh my brother branham my brother but he would call him my brother my friend my amigo this is the way brother branham was i've seen it he knew they said something bad about it that persona this is the way he was now would he get mad yeah see but he would never get even that was his character ambush as we said last week surprise attack on a person wait a person newly enlisted in the armed forces and not very good moses those are things that should come automatically whose are great great great great great great grandfather no no no adam noah that's where we come from but our grandkids he tells me they're going to get away with murder they're going to get away with doing wrong what your kids didn't do yes or no think about it i mean i have a grant i i have 16 of them and each one of them i kind of want a certain amount but one takes it off yeah but he did a better job than what i thought but he wants something so that's a recruit newly enlisted in other words we are new maybe it's me there it is abc's an accuracy or abbreviation now i want to start this morning genesis 3 genesis now the serpent was more subtle than any beast in the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea as god said you shall not eat of the of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it least you die three fruits are they still talking about the word of god yes they are see again then the bible says let me know the old serpent in revelations revelation apocalypses it's the devil it's the old serpent what the one in genesis and hennessy he brought it over here in revelations still talking about the word of god [Applause] and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die that's where the lie was trying to contradict what god said look at you that's why he started flirting word of god a little white lie blanca you're not gonna die for god does know that in the days you eat thereof that your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good god's thank you a woman how many of you heard greek mythology raise your hands it's nothing it's just somebody's opinion opinion written can your car be a god don't touch that won't you touch my car a car can be a god because that's what you worship god is an object of worship and many times we worship the worst thing amen amen listen the woman was always in the front line or the woman was in the front line amen amen eve was in the front line was your husband have you ever thought of that this is what brother branham said that's the location of listening at him now just how nasty he gets and how he whitewashes the word yes how many minds does he get into in cuantas mentes think about where do your thoughts start to trigger where does it come out after we don't i'm trying to get into this is what satan tried now don't you let satan fortify nothing don't let him fortify nothing see you keep god's word fortified in your mind is that what it says that's why i want you to wake up we can't daydream not he wants to you paid all that money foreign uh [Music] do you see what enters our mind that's what he plays with the problem is we allow him to enter our minds he plays kanikaz marbles he plays marbles right up here we allow it now don't let you don't you let satan fortify nothing you keep god's word fortified in your heart you do the same now this is what i like watch you uh micahs the woman said unto the serpent ye may not eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but the butt of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst in the middle sea of the garden fruit god said you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch at least you die no more now she got back on the word but this guy already opened up her mind say it now that's the word she's quoting it back to him now watch she's quoting she liked to quote the word of god the word of brother i read the books no no some of us that are bilingual we can do that and here's what brother branham is saying she's quoting it back to him the word of god i have pledged my eternal and the serpent said unto the woman you surely not ye shall not surely die see what's he trying to do that first human being he's trying to anoint that precious woman there what about us he anoints he anoints us with the same word come on brother we gotta wake up that's exactly what he's trying to get her to do [Music] make some of us fall asleep then the girl would say remember carlos carlos remember juan juan pedro remember those guys what happened to them i wonder what they look like well i'll tell you what we can do i don't know how brothers cavarosa does it sounds like that al gossey let's look on facebook on facebook wow he's gained some weight there that boy [Music] of what it was before off you fantasize i don't want to see your hands go up no kidding but i can see your hearts because once i said it that's what happens we go back in time we don't want to go back in time i go back in time for the vietnam war you can see it was no game it wasn't a game it was real real 58 209 people died look at this that's what he tries to get each good how many of us want to be anointed with lies then amen amen and the only thing you have to do now you're a free moral agent now you can accept it if you want to the thrill is there when some friend of yours and before you know it you're sitting down at a bar get because this is part of my next quote that many sisters have great husbands many brothers have great wives the day that it that comes and you don't tell her she's beautiful let's do this well i love your dress who bought it for you man he's a great man but you know you're a great lady my husband never said that to me i look at you you're well educated my husband tells me i'm stupid what's going on he's flirting with him this is real this is what destroys marriages is when you don't talk to your wife when you don't tell your wife what you mean in your heart because if you don't do it ponytail back here [Music] amen amen if we do this i can guarantee 1984. i don't know you were born in 83. 1984. brother bernie tells me this i'm going to do it the way he did it i want you to have equals more children what would you do they said instead will not have any more kids stop that you won't have any kids what would you do i wanted a little girl what did the devil do okay so diablo hey guys what does he think he is you can have a little girl certain people shouldn't tell you what to you know what i did he came and talked about listen i'm sorry how many boys do we have we have three boys i wanted a fourth quarter lucky numbers four numbers so i wanted a fourth one hoping for little girls no what would you say don't tell me because some of you would say let's go to another church i'm letting you know what i did look at you because i was convicted that's what i did i don't care who you are the battle raged on it's been going on if you listen to god's word i don't run for my problems i need vitamin f i need vitamin f which is faith i need vitamin b which is justification i need vitamins which is and i need vitamin hs which is the holy spirit it is i understand that in my life i need it in my life i desire forced her naila for so nobody grabbed her arm nobody forced me nobody forced naina she did it no no okay he'd be the serpent you're gonna no not like that like that that type of expression all right there there you go wow look at him my husband doesn't look like that he's a big guy handsome guy wow far better than her own husband he was the most subtle of all the beasts in the field this character good looking far better now think about it when we look on facebook and facebook and we see the past of a no boyfriend that's what he wants yes i've opened up that channel i want you to listen to them you can open the channel without knowing and he was trying to tell her what a great thing it was she's going to participate in an act yeah how great it was this is a gospel truth and when she did human reasoning caught it she opened up her mind why wouldn't that be [Music] think about it playing soccer jugando football let it go i don't know how to play you playing a it's still with us this morning i don't know who was what was his name michael jordan no michael jackson michael jackson i don't know he's saying a thrill song cantona and everybody thought it was great and before you know it and it's going on oh and when she did human reasoning caught it why wouldn't that be a thrill that's the thing he does since i've heard that the husband is liable for what you do some woman with a lovely little husband find some great big masculine man lovable husbands are here uh i'm not one all right but i'm going to watch a novella wow you know if you only look like ricardo ricardo or desi arnaz dezziornez i love lucy's husband i know i know i guess he never watched i love and we wish our husbands what god give but give god's word the first place a man can't even come he can't sin hallelujah here it is this is coming flesh fresco a man cannot sin until he first cast aside god's word he can't even sin that's disbelief this is describe i want you to stand listen don't open your mind to him don't that's why people are waiting the anointing [Music] i want you to [Music] you have enough power [Music] don't let those spirits anoint your spirit

are we going to go back to church all i can say for now is don't dismay and stay true everything is in the hands of god we will keep you informed and when the day comes it will be a pleasure to
