[37:33] god bless you brother
[37:37] it's always good to be in the house of

[37:46] as i said before
[37:56] we just returned from a missionary trip
[37:58] with my pastor
[38:00] but it's always good to be home
[38:02] the
[38:15] the best musicians
[38:25] [Music]
[38:58] yourself in simplicity
[39:01] in the most simplest things
[39:05] even in the morning when the sun is
[39:07] rising
[39:09] it's such a great accomplishment
[39:39] you are the great i am
[40:05] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[40:07] amen amen
[40:24] says the greatest thing you can wish
[40:26] upon your brother yes
[40:28] god bless you
[40:30] and yes it is
[40:34] but you're asking for a blessing from
[40:35] god foreign
[41:19] i have some notes that the brother and i
[41:21] have read when brother brown speaks and
[41:24] marvin predictable
[41:25] brother branham would preach he'd have
[41:27] his notes
[41:30] and i've seen some of his notes when he
[41:32] would preach
[41:44] [Music]
[41:58] the word of god is
[42:27] but christ become a high priest of good
[42:30] things to come
[42:31] by a greater and more perfect tabernacle
[42:33] not made with these hands that is to say
[42:35] not of this building
[42:55] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[42:57] but by his own blood he entered into
[42:59] once into the holy place having obtained
[43:01] eternal redemption for us
[43:10] scientifically
[43:13] for the blood of bulls and of goats and
[43:15] the ashes have been heifer sprinkling
[43:17] the unclean
[43:18] sanctifieth to the purifying of the
[43:19] flesh
[43:24] spiritually
[43:33] how much more shall the blood of christ
[43:35] who through the eternal spirit offered
[43:37] himself without spots of god purge your
[43:40] conscience from dead works to serve the
[43:41] living god
[43:46] take your seats may the lord have his
[43:47] blessings to the reading of his word
[43:53] it's buenos to be back home and be able
[43:54] to see every one of you
[43:58] not only at home where i live
[44:01] but this here is my home
[44:04] you're my brothers and sisters in christ
[44:06] yeah
[44:09] and as i come home see my parents my
[44:10] family my children
[44:13] that's how i can see every one of you
[44:18] there's a saying is
[44:22] sometimes you don't know what you have
[44:23] until it's lost
[44:29] maybe if you haven't lost it but you
[44:31] have had it without some time
[44:34] you appreciate what you have at home
[44:37] in the simple things
[44:42] as i said we just got back from lima
[44:44] peru
[44:48] by god's grace over there it's winter
[44:50] time
[44:55] it was about 52-53 degrees
[45:00] and the temperature just reached up to
[45:02] about 63-62 degrees
[45:08] are you a little jealous because of my
[45:09] weather i'm in no medical anatomy she
[45:11] said don't talk about it
[45:17] the weather was very nice we enjoyed our
[45:19] missionary trip
[45:26] we went to inaugurate a church of
[45:27] brother carlos
[45:29] a very beautiful church
[45:57] [Music]
[45:58] message
[46:09] this is not the big things that are
[46:10] gonna hold us back from going into the
[46:11] rapture
[46:25] is incredible and it seems insignificant
[46:43] the eternal god the suffix 1661.
[46:51] he came and formed himself in the cell
[46:52] of a virgin
[48:04] doesn't matter
[48:28] my brother one time was telling me that
[48:30] he heard that uh that they told that
[48:31] only the ministers and pastors will be
[48:33] in the rapture
[48:37] so he was talking to a sister so this
[48:40] sister
[48:41] was scared
[48:46] so she went to go talk to someone else
[48:49] look a pastor told me this
[48:54] see what happens sometimes they haven't
[48:56] read the message
[49:00] and the brother said they'll be there
[49:01] more women
[49:03] because the woman is more serious
[49:06] he surrenders
[49:09] so the church is a type of a woman
[49:12] jesus who the first i want to go search
[49:14] for for jesus christ
[49:25] we can surrender it will be a correct
[49:26] attitude that we have
[49:40] and when the word of the lord comes to a
[49:41] true servant
[49:55] whether he's prepared
[50:07] in other words whether he wants to or
[50:09] not he says
[50:24] he never goes for foolishness
[50:28] and this is the difference
[50:35] garcia apostle brother bernie garcia
[51:07] he only goes in the name of the lord
[51:10] for one thing
[51:12] he's got a mission
[51:15] of the lord
[51:48] you know that every one of you goes
[51:51] we are representing every one of you
[51:53] they sell them out of brandon brother
[52:00] you know what's the success of my
[52:01] conventions
[52:58] you don't have to do it no it's an
[52:59] obligation it's not an obligation
[53:02] but she does it because of love
[53:07] because sister will say when i get your
[53:09] father's
[53:10] shirts
[53:12] and i begin
[53:26] and that's
[54:08] a
[54:50] and it's not the great things that we
[54:52] share with them
[54:53] yes it's the simple things
[54:55] people want to know
[54:59] how much you care about the people
[55:02] i don't care how much you may know
[55:18] one is willing to help them
[55:23] and i believe that's what our pastor is
[55:24] projecting okay
[55:28] sometimes we're misunderstood
[55:31] but it's simple brothers
[56:10] on a monday and i'm getting everything
[56:11] ready that i need that i need for my
[56:12] missionary
[58:20] is
[58:34] yente
[59:15] people very happy
[1:01:16] religion without expiration
[1:01:19] the atonement
[1:01:20] the atonement
[1:02:14] my father was speaking the gospel to a
[1:02:16] customer
[1:02:31] the person came and said i'm not going
[1:02:32] to
[1:03:24] sometimes why we are the way we are yeah
[1:03:41] if you doubt whether you're a son or
[1:03:42] daughter of god
[1:04:26] [Music]
[1:04:41] and he was kindly opposed of divine
[1:04:43] healing
[1:04:47] he's changed his mind since then
[1:04:57] but that afternoon was fifteen eighteen
[1:04:59] hundred people were sitting in the
[1:05:07] or 800 auditorium sitting in the
[1:05:08] auditorium
[1:05:10] el salvador
[1:05:12] he preached on christ the savior of the
[1:05:13] world
[1:05:17] and asked people if they'd come down and
[1:05:18] accept him
[1:05:24] [Music]
[1:06:16] yes
[1:06:24] now let's see how brother branham's
[1:06:26] group looked i know many of you know but
[1:06:27] we're reviewing
[1:06:29] entrance
[1:06:30] mine come in on crutches
[1:06:33] wheelchairs came
[1:06:35] straight jackets
[1:06:37] you know what a straight jacket
[1:06:39] when a person is
[1:06:41] insane
[1:06:44] and they have to
[1:07:25] similar things brother bernie would say
[1:07:29] certain ministers that couldn't work
[1:07:34] brother bernie would say if you don't
[1:07:36] work you can't eat it
[1:07:39] no that's trash
[1:08:33] thank you for giving us the spiritual
[1:08:34] food at its right time
[1:09:17] to raise me up
[1:10:13] that's a different thing for your faith
[1:10:15] to bug something like that
[1:10:21] come down accept christ and be saved
[1:10:28] but when you have to prove what you're
[1:10:30] talking about
[1:10:32] that's right when jesus christ comes
[1:10:34] down
[1:10:38] and makes but brother as long as
[1:10:40] in his gospel and he promised it
[1:10:45] don't let one thing thank you
[1:10:48] because he will do it
[1:10:51] that's true
[1:10:53] he will do it
[1:11:25] and as many as he shall find bid to the
[1:11:27] marriage
[1:11:38] so the servants went out into the
[1:11:39] highways and gathered together all as
[1:11:41] many as they found both bad and good and
[1:11:44] the wedding was furnished with guests
[1:11:47] colombia peru colombia pedro por los
[1:11:50] caminos

[1:12:00] del cordero to the wedding supper of the
[1:12:03] lamb el senor
[1:12:04] may god bless you
[1:12:08] [Applause]
[1:12:11] stand up for a minute please
[1:12:17] you know god is real
[1:12:20] there's only thing one thing we need to
[1:12:22] do

[1:12:28] to be preoccupied
[1:12:31] let me say it again do not allow your
[1:12:34] mind to be preoccupied
[1:12:41] and the reason our mind gets preoccupied
[1:12:47] we live
[1:13:01] imagine
[1:13:13] we are dealing with real live spirits
[1:13:19] this is the generation

[1:20:27] i'll be praying for you
[1:20:44] mentally
[1:21:12] every little button that somebody pushes
[1:21:18] we get upset
[1:21:24] the bride no lanovia should be doing one
[1:21:28] thing
[1:21:29] preparing herself
[1:21:32] for that meeting
[1:21:34] that means one thing
[1:21:37] pray

[1:22:09] he wanted to talk to me about religion
[1:22:14] i spoke with him for about an hour two
[1:22:16] hours three hours
[1:22:20] he gave his heart to jesus
[1:22:28] let me say it again he gave his heart to
[1:22:30] jesus
[1:22:35] but one thing he did tell me
[1:22:38] what's my family going to say
[1:22:43] what are my friends going to say
[1:22:50] do i have to do this
[1:22:52] no i have to cut my hair
[1:22:55] can i wear shorts oh some shorts can i
[1:22:58] grow a beard oh uh
[1:23:01] not old enough
[1:23:03] but he had all these questions
[1:23:18] yourself to jesus christ
[1:23:21] he will change you
[1:23:23] the pastor can't change things
[1:23:28] it has to be an experience
[1:23:30] that you have
[1:23:32] with your lord
[1:24:00] what
[1:24:07] why don't i have three or four services
[1:24:11] why don't i have a youth
[1:24:14] campaign put those souls in danger
[1:24:20] i have to give an account
[1:24:22] not you no i have to give an account
[1:24:26] for everything i do wrong
[1:24:28] for
[1:24:36] and somebody gets sick and passes
[1:24:41] it's me
[1:24:42] it was
[1:24:55] i got to do what god told me to do
[1:24:58] and if god said one service excuse me i
[1:25:01] gotta go with this
[1:25:02] service
[1:25:03] i can't listen to people
[1:25:06] because we are living
[1:25:10] in the age of that
[1:25:13] of laodicea
[1:25:15] where people go from home to home
[1:25:19] good and bad
[1:25:22] of what we should be doing
[1:25:38] because they need money
[1:26:06] i sorry i get paid uh five thousand
[1:26:10] dollars a month
[1:26:12] no that's not what i told you i missed
[1:26:17] i'm not looking for your money
[1:26:19] i don't need your money
[1:26:34] of all the churches
[1:26:36] from voice of restoration
[1:26:40] this is the church
[1:26:44] that they're gonna learn from
[1:26:46] what they're gonna see
[1:26:48] as an example
[1:27:02] what
[1:27:28] love love
[1:27:33] i don't care what yesterday it looked
[1:27:35] like
[1:27:36] i want to know what today is going to be
[1:27:42] what's going to keep us away from the
[1:27:44] rapture
[1:27:49] is that i haven't established
[1:27:52] we haven't established
[1:27:54] pure love in our hearts
[1:27:57] don't worry about yourself
[1:28:00] worry about others
[1:28:02] look at the person next to you
[1:28:07] that's the person we pray for
[1:28:09] constantly praying
[1:28:11] constantly
[1:28:23] it's not easy in the mission field
[1:28:26] the hardest
[1:28:34] if i would know today
[1:28:37] or if i would know yesterday what i know
[1:28:39] today
[1:28:40] you
[1:29:21] according to the spirits that governs
[1:29:24] you
[1:29:27] espiritu
[1:29:30] that governs the person
[1:30:03] shall not die
[1:30:17] he was deceived
[1:30:45] and understand one thing
[1:31:00] the same message the same spirit you
[1:31:03] must be through that one receives
[1:31:05] the other one received
[1:31:07] i jump in the spirit
[1:31:09] the tears are gonna jump in the spirit i
[1:31:11] mean
[1:31:13] it's not in them it's over them
[1:31:18] the tares do not have
[1:31:21] the holy spirit
[1:31:23] all it's doing is doing this the holy
[1:31:25] spirit
[1:31:27] is that in them
[1:31:42] sooner or later
[1:31:45] those stairs will be burned
[1:31:49] so i ask you today
[1:31:51] somebody approaches you
[1:31:54] i can't stand you no tell
