[16:33] [Music]
[16:34] here
[16:37] [Music]
[16:47] [Music]
[16:59] [Music]
[17:02] the spirit itself bears witness with our
[17:04] spirit that we are the children of god
[17:07] and if children then heirs heirs of god
[17:09] and joint heirs with christ if so be
[17:12] that we suffer with him that we may also
[17:15] be glorified together for i reckon that
[17:17] the sufferings of this present time are
[17:20] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[17:21] that shall be revealed in us for the
[17:23] earnest expectation of the creature
[17:26] waits for the manifestation of the sons
[17:28] of god
[17:29] let us pray to god
[17:33] [Music]
[17:39] lord how our soul innermost being just
[17:42] yearns to see the manifestation of the
[17:44] sun
[18:13] [Music]
[18:36] [Music]
[18:56] [Music]
[19:07] again
[19:13] [Music]
[19:23] play
[19:30] [Music]
[19:39] [Music]
[19:46] [Music]
[20:03] brother
[20:07] [Music]
[20:17] [Music]
[20:34] [Music]
[20:46] they're in a spirit
[20:49] [Music]
[20:54] his face
[20:59] [Music]
[21:12] with god
[21:56] we're in the letter to the romans this
[21:58] is message number 24.
[22:05] and we're in number four now in the
[22:07] subtitle the manifestation of the sons
[22:09] of god
[22:15] it's something very interesting that is
[22:16] if we're following all along on the
[22:18] teaching
[22:19] uh
[22:24] we
[22:57] you have trained us for such a long time
[22:58] now lord now father give us our ranks
[23:04] how many of you would like your rank uh
[23:14] trusting will be able to understand that
[23:16] what i'm trying to get across to you
[23:29] that each one of us has to understand
[23:31] get our rank
[23:40] and the word rank is a degree or
[23:42] position of dignity eminence or
[23:44] excellence
[23:52] so each one of us should get to a
[23:54] position or place a degree of position
[23:56] of dignity eminence or excellence
[23:58] is
[24:10] sometimes when i'm speaking the people
[24:12] pick up on something and they
[24:13] misunderstand it that they twisted or
[24:15] mislocated
[24:31] made the comment that we are not worms
[24:39] someone might take a quote scripture say
[24:41] throw it back and say well you are worms
[24:54] but now that worm has been transformed
[24:57] and is now a beautiful butterfly and to
[24:58] the fight
[25:53] i'm not worthy
[26:22] this man even the way he walked you
[26:24] could tell he was different from the
[26:25] rest of the slaves
[26:27] that was the man that wanted to buy him
[26:31] do you treat him better
[26:33] you feed him better
[26:35] you give him a better bet
[26:51] uh i used to is myself the same question
[26:53] so i found out that his daddy is a king
[26:55] back overseas
[27:00] dignity
[27:05] even the way a person behaves you can
[27:07] tell whether he feels himself worthy
[27:11] i believe in surrendering to god
[27:18] i
[27:45] uh
[28:00] yes
[28:14] so he says father give us our ranks
[28:22] eminence or excellence
[28:25] that's my prayers
[29:07] those are the three words that i gave
[29:09] you last time and i'd like to review
[29:10] them
[29:17] over concerning the words overbearing
[29:21] overpowering and overwhelming
[29:33] you take the word overpowering that
[29:34] takes you to a super being
[30:06] el salvador
[30:16] by the blood of god
[31:16] going to
[31:44] the bible says his righteous soul was
[31:46] vexed
[31:49] when he saw the abomination that were
[31:50] performed in the city
[31:53] but the messenger says it like this
[31:56] but he didn't i wasn't enough
[33:57] [Music]
[34:18] when
[34:31] there's something about that
[36:38] that's great
[37:34] just like
[38:30] the bible says
[40:22] i know it
[40:26] but if they did know it they would
[40:27] understand it
[40:30] in an understanding that would be part
[40:31] of the word
[40:33] it would be one with the word
[40:49] i believe there's at least 100 people
[40:50] here that were here
[41:25] [Music]
[42:13] about being born
[43:07] let's look at the next scripture
[43:10] colossians
[43:18] amen
[43:52] are we going to meet the lord jesus
[43:53] christ here on the earth isn't that soul
[44:00] brother i believe we should be a little
[44:01] bit further away
[44:05] we do not make jesus christ
[44:20] that the people
[44:48] in order for
[45:02] verse 26.
[45:13] even the mystery which has been hid
[45:15] from ages and from generations but now
[45:18] is made manifest to his scene
[45:23] here we're speaking about the
[45:24] manifestation of the sons of god
[45:28] but there can be no manifestation
[46:17] to whom god would make known what is the
[46:19] riches of the glory of this mystery
[46:21] among the gentiles which is christ in
[46:23] you the hope of god
[48:18] corinthians
[48:21] the
[48:22] subject is the manifestation of the sons
[48:24] of god
[48:56] that god was in christ reconciling the
[48:59] world unto himself not imputing their
[49:02] passes unto them and has committed unto
[49:04] us the word of reconciliation
[49:10] so the bible says god was in christ
[49:14] and he was reconciling the world unto
[49:15] himself
[49:17] that was he was calling to himself
[49:21] that's why
[49:23] no one can come into the foreign
[50:37] mighty god
[50:46] romans chapter 7.
[51:03] first one
[51:11] [Music]
[51:20] for i speak to them that know the law
[51:22] how that the law has dominion over a man
[51:25] as long as he lives
[51:35] for the woman who hasn't had husband is
[51:38] bound by the law to her husband
[51:41] what's the subject title of the song
[51:44] the manifestation of the sons of god
[51:46] come back
[52:06] for you have not received the spirit of
[52:08] bondage again to fear but you have
[52:10] received a spirit of adoption whereby we
[52:12] cry abba father
[52:16] see we
[52:35] for the woman which has a husband is
[52:37] bound by the law to her husband
[52:41] now remember
[52:43] we were married
[53:09] while her husband lives she'd be married
[53:11] to another she shall be called an
[53:12] adulterer
[53:26] accept jesus
[54:22] is
[54:31] to be born again
[55:18] in the
[56:42] anyway
[56:46] but the word will draw out it's his
[56:48] people
[56:53] is
[57:15] where in time passed you walked
[57:17] according to the course of this world
[57:19] according to the prince of the power of
[57:20] the air the spirit that now works in the
[57:23] children of disobedience
[57:42] every man born a woman born of a woman
[57:45] is right mentioned right here in paul's
[57:47] including himself also entered
[57:52] into
[58:02] also we all had our conversation in
[58:04] times past and the lust of our flesh
[58:05] fulfilling the desire of the flesh and
[58:07] of the mind and whereby nature the
[58:09] children of wrath even as others
[58:13] so here speaking about nature
[58:16] of husbands
[58:50] even when we we were dead and sins has
[58:53] quickened us together with christ by
[58:54] grace are ye saved
[58:56] now let's go back to rome
[58:59] uh seven and five
[59:16] foreign
[59:25] wherefore my brethren you also are
[59:27] become dead to the law by the body of
[59:29] christ that you should be married to
[59:31] another even to him who is raised from
[59:33] the dead that we should bring forth
[59:35] fruit unto god
[59:39] with christ
[59:42] just like he died i went to california
[1:00:12] verse
[1:00:22] for when we were in the flesh the
[1:00:24] motions of sin which were by the law did
[1:00:26] work in our members to bring forth fruit
[1:00:28] unto death
[1:00:31] classes
[1:00:32] so there's two kinds of fruits
[1:00:37] fruit
[1:00:48] [Music]
[1:01:05] [Music]
[1:01:29] [Music]
[1:01:44] you
