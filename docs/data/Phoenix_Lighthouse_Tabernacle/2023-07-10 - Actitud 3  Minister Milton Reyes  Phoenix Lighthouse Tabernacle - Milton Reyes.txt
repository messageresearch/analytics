you look for it I want to thank our pastor once again for his Trust Ed um oh man what is good and what does the Lord require of thee but to justly and love mercy and to walk humbly with thy God nombre restaurant the Lord's voice Cried unto the city and the man of wisdom and shall see thy name hear ye the rod and who hath appointed it you may take your sheets Brothers this morning this morning I'd like to continue speaking on an attitude honestly I try to bring another topic and sometimes it's not what you want one studies it brings you back to the same thing [Music] Lord help me I'm gonna continue with this topic of attitude and here we are going to repeat once again what the dictionary says the word attitude means it's the way of being with somebody or being able to behave with someone [Music] a temperament towards a person or a situation this morning we'll be looking at a different attitude whether it be good attitudes or bad attitudes I'll try to make it a little more personal last week we were not here we went with the children to go take them out I'm going to share with you what happened to me um we're in a line to get on top of it inside a train there was a small child next to us and he had a briefcase the suitcase so that we would be calm learning that from oh that was a lesson that's the lesson that God showed it going back to attitude and we're going to focus on attitudes that we see on the day-to-day um [Music] they're always there with a good attitude they're trained to have a good attitude um I was looking at the Senate they were hiring people and the first thing that caught my attention it's what it says what you got to do when you fill out your application before filling out the rest of documents he is and they're trained to have the correct attitude also catch my attention is the dealership that wants to sell cars [Music] they treat you like a king when you get there is that true have you ever been to a dealership they try not to get you not to leave without first driving the cars they come in [Music] they have a very nicely furnished office inside it is [Music] even though sometimes they throw in a little numbers that we don't see in the contract I hope that there's no one here who sells cars but we're trying to learn a lesson foreign [Music] they always have a very good attitude I want to go get a haircut with my brother it wasn't him it was other Barbers I was looking at the one who was cutting hair next the customer was very serious it was very no very small talk one word would come in another word in a minute they were laughing wow [Music] [Music] oh yeah they're very uh educated when it comes to sports the political politics is they have a very good attitude another attitude that I like um is the waiters or waitress waiters you get there well when you're not so hungry and we'll see [Music] they try to do their best they bring you the menu [Music] doesn't come and take your order maybe you start not to get such a good attitude you ask yourself you know where did this guy go yeah and when he comes like maybe he forgot about me but the majority they try to do their best because they have a lot of tables amen Brothers I'm trying to talk about the attitudes that we come across on the day to day um I'm gonna have one of my attitudes um CEO yeah I have an appointment with a clients he's going to sign a contract for me by the grace of God but if I'm going to go with the client yeah I'm almost arriving at the at the site so I can get the contract but two minutes before maybe I get a phone call and maybe something a catastrophe happens since I'm already with the clients I have to show him a smile I can't let him know that they've started bothering me amen Brothers is in a bad mood families [Music] before this isn't now this was me I'm talking about me when we lacked money at home [Music] does it put you in a bad mood this a construction worker myself he says right now you're not gonna scold me because with this he my blood is boiling don't even tell me nothing oh okay I say all right I'm not going to tell you nothing when we're hungry [Music] but we're hungry when we're very hungry but of all these attitudes that we have seen um sellers the waiters waitresses they have something behind them correct that makes them have a correct attitude they have a pay or they have a benefit that they will receive yes that's what makes them have a correct attitude I want to bring it closer to us get the get that we have to do to always have a correct Christian attitude that our pastor may tell us each time that you have a correct we're gonna pay you well then our eyes were changed amen amen okay forgive me I don't want to get into problems amen Brothers we foreign [Music] [Music] and there was a police uh playing a game and he was getting bothered this is Senor he says Lord I have two daughters my daughters are you going to allow them to live in this filth because why don't you just destroy them how am I going to allow my daughters to live among this is [Music] he says look is this is you show them all the sins he has committed and they start flying but there's like a parachute that everything that he did reach the presence of God everything that he did it came back because there was almost a rainbow like blood and God to him he kept seeing him he says oh Lord forgive me we're having this bad attitude towards and he gets closer to her later on after he has seen the vision is a [Music] [Music] [Music] and that woman went back to the path of God sometimes I had a bad attitude with Beggars around the streets [Music] but studying this [Music] we have to be we have to be sure that we have it [Music] [Music] um [Music] the word became flesh preached 1954 on 1003 you say yes and I recognized the other day okay a selfish Spirit coming in me uh and what it is [Music] [Music] the messenger he recognized it is [Music] this man is wrong I had to tell him about it he says that's wrong God is the one to tell him about it so no no song means negotios that's not it's none of my business my business is to preach the gospel and love everybody and love my enemies as Jesus Christ loved me one of the first Commandments is to love the Lord why do I have to love him with all of my heart you know [Music] the messenger says Jesus Christ loved me Jesus Christ loved us first and us as Christians it says we don't fold our hands [Music] there's something wrong amen brothers because Jesus gave the first step he loved us first that's why we have to be that way we have to uh that's the attitude that's the Christian attitude I'll be reading another quote [Music] the reaction to an action preacher 1959-08-10 they say yes you say oh praise God I believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit he says that this is what we say oh praise God I believe in the baptism of the holy spirit in the first little Temptation that comes along you fly off like a buzzsaw foreign [Music] Luciano he told me he was Christian you know [Music] and he didn't have the correct tool he needed to do a certain job he started saying all sorts of things were coming out he went to the store you want to go buy the tool he needed he was throwing it from halfway across he was angry well this is so we have attitude towards another person it's a it's a attitude the attitude is for good or it's for bad that is how we should behave amen Brothers I'm going to go into the Book of John 11. we'll be bringing Through The Story of Lazarus which caught my attention of Martha and Mary Jesus where in John 11 4. glorification when did you heard that he said the sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God that the Son of God might be glorified thereby Marta is here Martha's Brothers had gone to tell him that Lazarus was sick o now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus [Music] when he had heard it therefore he was sick he about two days in the same place where he was in other words he knew that he was in agony and he was about to die but as we say sometimes those who are hourly workers he stayed more days there esperando waiting for Lazarus to pass away and we're jumping by we're going to 11. is said unto them our friend Lazarus sleepeth but I go that I may awake him out of sleep then said his disciples Lord if he sleep he shall Do Dwell well he said he is already dead and I am glad for your sakes I was not there till the intent you may believe nevertheless let us go on to him here's the Lord Jesus saying that thankfully that no disciples were there who he was foreign [Music] in the grave four days already decompose after four days Integra your liver begins to disintegrate your brain begins to disintegrate in the bacteria stick over the body that's why there is a putrid smell [Music] she heard that Jesus was coming went and met him but Mary sat still in the house Jesus unto Jesus Lord if thou has been here my brother had not died if you would have been here amen Hermanos um were sisters and they were a brother of Lazarus they're Lazarus sisters the master says I am here I am the life in the way and whoever comes to me shall not die um thy word preached in 1948-0305 [Music] when he was standing there at the side of the grave of Lazarus [Music] crying and the tears running down his cheeks Lazarus but that was his human feeling for the people in by the side of the grave L said take your way the stone just take you away the stone is says you got to do your part anytime you say Lord help me change Lord help me in order to change we have to do our part [Music] those two little frail women and when he took away the stone I can hear him clear yes hears me always Lazaro but you can hear him scream with a loud voice way out during the spirit land Lazarus this element the measure says that if he has said Lazarus the resurrection would have happened that's why he called them by name Lazarus I believe he says a general Resurrection right there and I believe that's what I think that's right he said Lazarus come forth stood up on his feet again please come forth I'm going to read one more quote this is sometimes we've been reviled or hurt s we've been betrayed Los Angeles they have rejected us they have hurt us emotionally the unpardonable sin was Jesus for Jesus when he was reviled revital means to use insulting language [Music] you are vowed not again [Music] when they done evil to him he turned and did good to them when they persecuted him and nailed him to the Cross he looked down and said his father forgive them for they don't know what they're doing [Music] that's an attitude that goes beyond those limits let's hurt us no no no punch you want to fight with them a man amen you yeah it says forgive them for they don't know what they're doing a club the Speedy too see this is that the kind of spirit is not in you the Holy Ghost has never entered you yet for that was the Same Spirit was on Christ Jesus the Bible said let it be in you Christ in his church let it be in you Christ is in his church so maybe they hurt us physically we want to respond where they hurt us emotionally we feel bad once I saw a friend foreign news is I said 20 years he says how much damage did he do to you his brother-in-law says he didn't lend me his bicycle sometimes that's the way we are little small things we get we started two other things a man amen [Music] I'm gonna give some time to our pastor um may God bless you Brothers [Music] [Applause] okay stand up for a minute I'm not going to take too long um I do want to send the the people where we were at last week and San Luis they send their greetings we had a good time and everything has to do with attitude we have um um something that we're going to be doing there in San Luis it's a project it's going to take a little while you'll be hearing about it and what we want to try to do we're going to build a church let me say it again we want to build the church in the 80s they were small it was a small group The 90s there was a small group we call individuals going there was still a small group individuals lately we have had the church grow and it's time that we start looking at the future of San Luis there's a lot of souls there I would say there's a million people there's people to be saved let me say it again a positive positive attitude will bring people in the smile that we have is what they need what people want is to have confidence in someone yes or no see no people are looking we're in an age we're confused people don't know what to do people don't believe this is just the very same thing that brother Milton was speaking about we lost our vision let me say it again Christianity has lost its Vision what we need to do as a church we're in the lighthouse because we are a lighthouse we need to give light is also individuals those individuals individuals [Music] that's our correct attitude we need to have it in other words if I want to give something I have what they're asking foreign I'm Gonna Let You Go a minute thinking about you you're touching us because if I was to say who's the grouchiest person here Mommy on a Monday and I won't tell you and you won't know call me Monday I'm the biggest grouchy person on a Monday why okay because the test is on why because everybody thinks that there's only one persona that can give you the confidence that you need or the advice that you need it's Jesus it's Jesus it's Jesus the only one that will care and take care of your burdens you don't have to fight anymore he will fight for you but we have to stay potatoes we gotta stay positive so I wake up in the wrong side of the bed Moderno he models himself the way he talks the way he looks the way he behaves how he dresses his appearance now let's look at the sister that's the other side of the coineda again needs to dress the way she should be dressing otherwise the Modern Man the modern husband the model of the generation the first thing they're going to imitate what you are and we need to be careful because one anointing spirit will attract the other person is so don't blame the devil poor guy we're always blame blaming the devil it's our attitude again if we have the correct attitude people will come they'll want to be around you so God bless you this morning uh that's all I'm going to say I'm not going to say too much about anything I'll wait till I preach again uh I do want to say this there's a person here we're going to be praying for it what happened was there was an accident there's always accidents no matter what we do we're going to have an accident is paralyzed how would you like to be in that position how would your attitude be more so if you're a Christian Cristiano well it happened so we're going to pray but prior I'm going to give you a testimony I'm giving the testimony wants to come forward as a representative of his brother then he's going to come forward but this is what happened I'm in Africa you're still here in Africa I was in Johannesburg Johannesburg right there I was in Johannesburg there was a sister they brought her in a chair she had she was in a car accident yesterday Carlos was there Manny was there adios miracles happen but it's the attitude that someone does without thinking oh here we go again God is on the same for a purpose and when God comes on the same God that heals that delivers can you say Amen Milton can I see you your little slip the um all right um um his name is well that's a fancy name de Leon I have a friend named um all right well close Circa Hermanos brother can you tell me what happened to your brother God bless all of you the house and when he told us that apparently but the rest is immobile do you believe in miracles are you Christian today on [Applause] what if I was to tell you that God has done and no matter who it is sooner or later God will put you in a bed so then you can cry out when you come on you'll know what to expect this is what's going to happen please listen carefully his brother will walk again mother will walk again for one human to do one human to believe another human so if you believe amigo now if you don't believe because I don't need you I don't I I'm positive positive atmosphere and that's what we live by yes we have a code of ethics and that code of ethics only only calling to the others deep call in the Deep nothing has to happen otherwise God wouldn't have given us escrito do you believe it is Heavenly Father celestial here we are our hands are lifted we believe you were in the positive to a reaction Maybe [Music] negative questions but father Gates let brother or the family knowing that you are on the same foreign they said you would be healed it's are positive will stay positive to the church when the brother comes to the church God yes and God is a party [Music] strengthen s towels it's God [Music] we put the virtue in the legs of our brother killer [Music] the only thing that the brother needs to do is come to this church will come with positive thoughts more than able to heal hermano Milton he spoke about Lazarus he was there for four days Jesus Christ when he said Lazarus Lazaro this is Lazarus that's when Lazarus heard the voice and he came forth he didn't have a nose oh God he gave him that nose he gave him the blood because God is the same yesterday today and forever [Music] you can move the legs of our brothers I don't know him but he knows him this brother is here he wants his brother to walk he has a family and the family wants him to walk you know tell them today if you mark it down in your Bible there's something special this is the uh about this day that's why I tell you Brothers when he arrives and that brother arrives you will see the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ not because I say it well because he fought it so Lord here we are with our brothers help him this morning who's in the hospital may he tell him they're waiting for you over there yes and that's the good news he has that you will walk so Heavenly Father understand where our brother is at change his thoughts Place something in his heart that says today I am positive the Pastor said I will walk I believe it so father make it real in the heart of our brother who's in the hospital that is take care of the family he will reach in the new birth that is we are hoping for father Todo thank you foreign my God Is Right foreign my God is real [Music] thank you [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] goodbye let me say [Music] one
