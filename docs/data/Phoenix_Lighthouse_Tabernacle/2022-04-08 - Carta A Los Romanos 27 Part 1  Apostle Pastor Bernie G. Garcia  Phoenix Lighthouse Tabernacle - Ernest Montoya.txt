[Music] for verily i say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desire to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things would ye hear and have not heard them [Music] before your brother [Music] mm [Music] i'm the temple of the spirit of the lord [Applause] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] yes i am yes i [Music] am yes i am [Music] [Music] lord our grace full of power full of glory full of grace [Music] [Music] we're going to continue on the subject that we've been having that's the manifestation of the sons of god this is the seventh message that deals with the manifestation of the sons of god title to the tape is a letter to the romans number 27. for me it's been a study of a lot of benefit buenos as i review the message of scripture i seem like i had never heard it before this just keeps me stimulated there are certain things that are just tying together completely especially not trusting god that he gives us the complete revelation of the day that we're living in revelation because if he does give us a revelation of the day that we're living in no nos we won't be idle uh we see that this is a time period when the sons of god are to be manifested we know that manifested means to declare to manifest a show esta is this is the age when the children of god god's sons will be made known who they are see that even from the fall back there in the garden of eden all creation has been waiting for this day when that backsliding took place during the garden of eden is the only hearing them preach hamas but they'll never be able to take you to the spot where you can recognize the day that we're that's i'm going to continue on this message of manifestation of the sons of god and there's a few items i want to read to you from the message and to be able to read you these little items and as we've talked about the message that which has been brought to us by the messenger of the age we have talked and said that the wheat plant has four major stages to it the first part once the seed versus foreign the second part is the castle the third part is a shock and the fourth part is the seed you that are a believer if you believe it has four parts first part he says now in english the first part second part tassel second part third part the shark and the fourth part green the seed the grain okay whatever the math once again without any help number one second part third part fourth part drain how many stages of parts of the wheat plant i've showed you how many are you going to answer okay okay thank you that's how god raises up the individual he also goes to four parts to be able to get to where he has to get the premier party that's it in english i want to be sure that everyone understands me god brings the individual in four steps the same as a wheat plant now the first part is justification sanctification is the second part then you're born a child of god then you're placed or adapted or sealed so let's say together a brother and he will say the first second third fourth and then you say right after him i want to be sure he stays with us so justification justification sanctification sanctification born a son born placed played adopted adopted or sealed we've all heard that haven't we so how many parts does the wheat plant have so how many stages does a christian go through it's four movies we find likewise they they won't be able to follow me just put me the pyramid there that's in my head and wrap down seven steps up and then with a with a headstone on top here we are in 1985. the third uh if you count emphasis number one number two in is the capstone that's number four the original seed if you believe that say yeah no notice are you they were carriers because when jesus was that was buried bloom and it's all its height but then the second age came in it started decreasing that by the third age died and it was buried is finally excommunicated you look at the mammoth grain is let's go back again you i want you to understand just one little thing 16 verse 20. verily verily i say unto you that ye shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into joy the a woman when she is in travail has sorrow because her hour has come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remembers her sorrow no more the anguish for joy that a man is born into the world well the third but rather in fulfillment finish of everything would be taking place now the latest century began 1906. the messenger came to rebuke the bliss was born in 1909 is uh god will open up your eyes this is my beloved is this is my beloved is the lord jesus christ 101 let's open up to zechariah chapter 3 the manifestation of the sons of god three verse nine for behold i have laid before joshua upon one stone shall be seven eyes behold i will engrave the raving thereof saith the lord of hosts and i will remove the inequity of that land in one day [Music] a couple things you have to have joshua is i don't understand in this is the holy is we don't need their voices totally revealed open with me [Music] is yet 2 17. he that hasn't let him hear what the spirit says into the churches remember later on i gave you some calls to prove that is a little bit turn it around you have one thing very outstanding have a pyramid that's god's great [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you
