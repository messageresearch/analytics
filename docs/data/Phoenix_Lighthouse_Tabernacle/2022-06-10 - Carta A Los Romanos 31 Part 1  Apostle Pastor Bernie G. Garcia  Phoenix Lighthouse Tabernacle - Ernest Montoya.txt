great [Music] then sing my song my favorite [Music] our greatness [Music] i'm [Music] [Applause] [Music] let us open up our bibles to the book written by the apostle paul saints 12 to 16. foreign for as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law for not the hearers of the law are just before god but the doers of the law shall be justified for when the gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law these having not the law are a law unto themselves which show the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing or else excusing one another in the day when god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according to my gospel before you sit down why don't you turn and shake yourself welcome have various visitors here tell the visitors god bless you you're welcome juan grande [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] would like to welcome each and every one of you to this place where we come to worship the lord we we're also happy that brother james garcia is here with us tremendous servant of the lord that is working in san diego i don't know that if you know that brother andrades had an accident and is in the hospital let us pray to the lord that the lord will bring him out healthy anybody else no another mask [Applause] we're speaking about we're bringing messages on concerning the book of romans and this is the message number thirty uh the thirty-one uh that we're speaking on right now is your conscience and the day of judgment this is uh the message number three on the subtitle domingo proximo pasado last sunday we spoke on one side of the coin taken as a baby first peter 3 21. the like figure where unto even baptism does also now save us then in parentheses it says not to put in the way of the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good conscience toward god and the princesses by the resurrection of jesus christ we saw that it was very important to be baptized in christian baptism we saw how it was that the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from our sin from we need to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ baptism produces a good conscience but it does not take away the filthiness of the one thing that we need to know concerning baptism when someone receives baptism it is a public confession they are confessing that they have accepted jesus christ but this public confession does not take away the filthiness of the flesh as you know as i move amongst the people and travel to different places we can really see the things that perturb man the things that molest the thinking of the believers but the teaching of the word uh is what places the believer in his place let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having in our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water i would like to say that this verse speaks to us about a fountain i believe that even though we have spoken many times concerning this people still have not been able to understand it him and i noticed them and i studied them and i find out that they do not believe it they do not believe it for example let's say that i say this way hey so he can take care of me because i'm sick if you are intelligent at all you will know that he did not believe what he said the first time even though i say okay but inside of me i have not believed it for example he was the one that existed he was a self-existing woman we have known we have been taught there was no noise there was no air no yeah it was not neither atoms nor molecules there was a total silence which created from that which was not seen it wasn't seen but now it is so then that word was made flesh and when it was made flesh would be held the glory over the but we unless we bypass nosotros we bypass the body of the word to come is in san diego i'm very difficult to interpret i'd like to read to you in the still book so i want to show you that fountain that when you accept jesus christ and you are forgiven it seems like we are struggling to clean off that in other words and it does not take away is 282 in english in the seven cells this is now they were gods and man if you become born in the family of your family name you are a son and a part of your father then when sin came in we found out the man crossed the chasm and brought up bulls and goats for cover but did not remit until the real bleach came that could take the stain of sin and break it completely to pieces and send it back upon its original perverter that was satan when it got back to satan he was his time of eternal annihilation now that shows what we believe we believe that he will be absolutely completely done done away and annihilated i would like for the brother to help me with two words in english okay cover the word cover cover cover and the other word is remit ghost they covered the sin but the clorox now to remit is to send away i'm going to remit my letter so when we understand what the word means the other day brother paul was baptizing and i was interpreting for him and then when i was interpreting i did not notice well how can that be possible and what was the mistake he said this way i baptize you i baptize in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission so it does not matter and for example here is a folder doesn't matter how often they search me there is nothing there that's the way it is continuing in reading i believe that sin will be broke up when it's confessed under the basis of the blood of jesus christ it's just like dropping a drop of black ink in a bunch of clorox bleach it just breaks it into the chemicals and sends it plumb back to where it come from and that's the way the blood of jesus christ does then that sets a man across the chasm again as a son of god now let us read it isaiah 1 18. but then when we began to fix our life though they be read like crimson they shall be as wool it doesn't matter how black or how red your sin is that sin can be taken how can it be foreign and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were opened and another book was open which is the book of life and the dead were just out of those things which were written in the books according to their work i'm going to ask you a couple of questions there are two types of people uh the what is it written with a lot of people like that the book would be written with pencils so who can erase it and make changes but it's written with ink is it written with a ink it's written with ink perfect he speaks through his mouth correcto is that right fiona yes or no all we have to do is apply that message to our heart it says like this is i believe that sin will be broke up when it's confessed upon the basis of the blood of jesus christ it's just like dropping a drop of black ink in a bunch of clorox beach why did he compare it with a drop of creviendo that up not i put the word there confessed upon the basis of the blood of jesus christ for example let us say for example putting myself in the middle east i really like to steal and i am not ashamed but god forgive me but through the years has been maybe 30 40 years and i said well the other day i saw the quarter from brother campo him i said oh i know what i'm going to do i'm going to get into my bedroom i'm going to say lord jesus there was a woman that had lived with another man and she went to the psychiatrist and to the doctors and nobody could cure her the reason was she had never confessed herself she was afraid that her husband would divorce her because she had committed an incorrect act you have to uh time of 10 15 years they do not want to confess their sins and they run again to be baptized you don't need to be baptized when you make everything he's a sinner real quiet oh yeah we are happy garlic [Music] foreign [Music] hmm [Music] this [Music]
