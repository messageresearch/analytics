[42:39] for all that are able to listen and hear
[42:40] a little bit of the word
[43:02] [Music]
[43:10] in this journey that we find ourselves
[43:11] in
[43:14] and if we bring something simple
[43:20] here that we take out
[43:24] it's not
[43:52] death
[44:06] because when
[44:20] here we're not going to say it there
[44:23] if we're here we're egoistic
[44:26] we'll be there the same way
[44:29] because we weren't able to change

[45:40] but father you strengthen and help us

[45:46] because we realize
[45:49] that your grace has not left us
[45:52] you've always been with us
[45:56] from the moment we began to breathe
[46:12] and father we know that everything that
[46:14] we've gone through
[46:16] has been with a purpose
[46:22] father thank you we ask you help us will
[46:24] we speak your words
[46:25] help your people
[46:33] [Music]
[47:01] [Music]
[47:07] we're going to bring in to bring a small
[47:36] is
[47:38] and i know thy works in tribulations and
[47:41] poverty but thou art rich
[47:44] and i know the blasphemy of them which
[47:46] say they are jews and are not
[47:48] but are the synagogue of satan
[48:17] i know thy works and tribulation
[48:22] now i want you to understand that a
[48:23] little bit
[48:25] the one that's speaking here
[48:28] is the lord
[48:32] he's telling this church this this age
[48:38] it's under generation i know that works
[48:40] in tribulation
[48:44] if you notice in every age there's been
[48:46] tribulations in
[48:50] and in every age there's been more and
[48:52] more trials and tribulations
[48:55] the trials intensify
[48:57] and every time
[48:59] says
[49:28] you've experimented
[49:42] multiply
[49:45] everything came against me
[49:48] how many does that happen
[49:51] gloria for five six seven wow
[49:54] i enjoyed that
[50:10] but when the lord reaches us
[50:13] the second he reaches us
[50:18] in making the turn
[50:21] then we're going against the current
[50:24] that's
[50:52] but it says
[50:59] but call to remembrance the former days
[51:01] in other words remember
[51:05] don't remember the days past don't
[51:07] forget the days passed
[51:09] in which despoja versus
[51:11] after ye were illuminated
[51:15] after you were eliminated by the gospel
[51:20] after
[51:47] this is what the word says
[52:17] there's so much pressure
[52:19] that they begin to see the problems
[52:22] the first thing they think
[52:24] you know
[52:25] i don't know what i did
[52:36] [Music]
[53:10] filled with problems
[53:40] they exposed
[54:06] he became companions of them that
[55:04] you had compassion of me and my bonds
[55:06] and took joyfully the spoiling of your
[55:08] goods knowing in yourselves that ye have
[55:11] in heaven a better and enduring
[55:12] substance
[55:16] and since then the spoiling of your
[55:17] goods
[55:18] fries
[55:45] oh that church is filled with nothing
[55:46] but problems
[55:58] knowing in yourselves that ye have a
[56:01] heaven a better and enduring substance
[56:04] the scripture continues
[56:07] here the word encourages us
[56:12] cast not away therefore your confidence
[56:17] which has
[56:18] great recumbence of reward
[56:22] for ye have need of patience
[56:28] that after ye have done the will of god
[56:30] ye might receive the promise
[56:35] in other words be perseverant
[56:38] don't lose your confidence you're trying
[56:39] to
[56:40] you have a reward oh this was necessary
[56:43] oh that is essential
[56:46] patients that we're creating in the
[56:48] trial
[56:50] we are doing the will of god
[56:52] so obtain the promise
[56:55] that's what the word of god
[57:09] the key is in tribulation
[57:39] the chief shepherd of the flock
[57:43] he is there walking amongst them
[57:46] and he notices that his people are in
[57:48] tribulation
[57:50] you know he is not um
[58:33] and that is a reason
[58:48] evil is present
[58:51] what am i doing bad
[58:53] everything
[58:54] is buena my intentions are good
[58:57] i want to do what's good
[58:59] but i'm not able to do it
[59:01] what's happening is
[59:17] the people of israel also thought the
[59:18] same way miramano look brother
[59:22] malachi chapter 1
[59:29] here's how is the claiming proclaiming
[59:31] to
[59:32] god the people of israel
[59:38] the burden of the word of the lord to
[59:39] israel by malachi
[59:42] i have loved you saith the lord
[1:00:39] this is what the people of israel were
[1:00:40] claiming
[1:00:55] but this is a stumbling block for many
[1:00:57] people
[1:01:01] well i believe that the lord is not amen
[1:01:03] the lord is love
[1:01:08] mercy amen he is a god that is rich in
[1:01:09] mercy
[1:01:14] for the wrath and amen comes for the
[1:01:16] mercy amen
[1:01:27] [Music]
[1:01:37] [Music]
[1:02:01] struggling
[1:02:32] by the lord
[1:03:13] something bad happens to you
[1:03:14] abe
[1:03:24] can get closer to god
[1:03:42] he's not right with god
[1:03:46] that's because he doesn't correct
[1:03:47] himself he just doesn't understand
[1:03:49] sometimes that's how we think
[1:03:52] but god knows best persona but that
[1:03:54] person
[1:03:56] is
[1:04:08] that's the way that the lord works
[1:04:24] while we've suffered for a little time
[1:04:26] in suffering
[1:04:30] it goes making us perfect
[1:04:32] it establishes us
[1:04:35] will strengthen us
[1:04:37] will make us firm
[1:05:05] the roots get deeper and deeper
[1:05:09] there was no wind
[1:05:13] there would be no deep roots
[1:05:17] a small wind would come in
[1:05:18] knock it over
[1:06:02] oh this poor person
[1:06:10] there may come a dog
[1:06:16] the problem
[1:06:45] and he learned obedience
[1:06:48] through what he suffered
[1:06:56] he actually was made perfect by the
[1:06:58] things that he suffered
[1:07:00] that's why the scripture says
[1:07:03] in hebrews 5 8.
[1:07:06] speaking the lord jesus christ though he
[1:07:08] were a son
[1:07:10] how many are your sons here
[1:07:12] glory to god
[1:07:21] obedience by the things which he
[1:07:23] suffered
[1:07:26] you're telling me that the lord jesus
[1:07:26] christ learned obedience
[1:07:28] amen
[1:07:30] how do you learn it
[1:07:32] from what he went through
[1:07:36] oh
[1:07:37] he had it real easy
[1:07:39] no sir
[1:07:52] he became the author of eternal
[1:07:54] salvation unto all them that obey him
[1:07:58] lord jesus christ
[1:08:02] he had to go through all his suffering
[1:08:03] to learn obedience
[1:08:30] i like what it says here in an
[1:08:31] exposition of the seven church ages
[1:08:34] in plain language
[1:08:37] the very character of jesus where
[1:08:39] perfection
[1:08:41] was perfected by suffering
[1:08:45] jesus the character of jesus
[1:08:49] was perfected by suffering is
[1:09:03] a measure of suffering
[1:09:32] is
[1:09:59] description below
[1:10:02] it's a very difficult scripture
[1:10:08] it's very difficult we're going to read
[1:10:09] about it
[1:10:13] call it all joy when you fall into
[1:10:15] diverse temptations
[1:10:20] i'm going to read it again
[1:10:22] i don't know if you understood it
[1:10:23] hermanos this is my brethren
[1:10:26] count it all joy
[1:10:28] versus
[1:11:08] and he stays on the sidelines
[1:12:04] heirs of god and joint heirs with christ
[1:12:06] yeah
[1:12:21] and if we're going to be joint heirs
[1:12:22] with christ
[1:12:26] we have to suffer with him
[1:12:31] so with him
[1:12:34] that way you may also glorify together
[1:12:39] how many of you want to reign with the
[1:12:40] lord
[1:12:48] i
[1:13:06] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:13:08] glory which shall be revealed in us
[1:13:13] it's just a little suffering
[1:13:16] because the
[1:13:57] you continue on
[1:14:12] that doesn't knock you over
[1:14:55] victoria it is a victory
[1:14:58] so we don't suffer with him
[1:15:01] and we will not be able to reign with
[1:15:02] him
[1:15:03] we have to suffer
[1:15:05] to be able to ring
[1:15:20] see what the message says in exposition
[1:15:32] think
[1:15:32] it not strange concerning that the fiery
[1:15:34] trials that are to try you
[1:15:46] that is what peter said is it strange
[1:15:48] that god wants us to develop a
[1:15:49] christ-like character that comes through
[1:15:51] suffering
[1:15:53] he asked the question
[1:15:57] he says no sir
