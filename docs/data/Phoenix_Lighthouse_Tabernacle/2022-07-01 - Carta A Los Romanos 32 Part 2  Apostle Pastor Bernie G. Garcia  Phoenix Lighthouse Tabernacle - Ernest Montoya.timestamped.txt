[24:12] god chose the heart
[24:29] something that i have said for years
[24:33] and you've heard me yeah
[24:35] and i've really understood it
[24:43] when i accepted this message
[24:58] on
[25:12] we had been taught
[25:26] their veil
[25:28] but they still fight at that point
[25:31] man
[25:33] that's right
[25:38] i want to emphasize something
[26:22] i couldn't
[26:49] i had control of my mind
[27:23] [Applause]
[27:58] bring it through the scriptures
[28:27] where
[28:35] oneness
[29:10] whole
[29:22] how many steps did the pyramid have that
[29:23] the prophet drew yeah there
[30:34] lord jesus christ
[31:03] so get christ in your heart
[31:08] christ and the holy ghost is the same
[31:10] thing
[31:15] holy spirit christ means the
[31:30] and it's christ in you anointing
[31:35] the messiah
[31:37] christ
[31:39] because they've come to an anointing
[32:22] a lot of questions
[32:23] has raised a lot of questions
[32:26] spirited
[32:40] the devil has caused this scripture this
[32:43] scripture
[32:45] to send millions
[32:47] to hello
[33:51] he
[33:52] [Music]
[34:32] we
[35:56] i lived many years in sin until i found
[35:59] the lord
[36:00] please brother branham i have sinned
[36:02] again and i'm not worthy to come before
[36:04] you in this holy place
[36:06] please tell me if i can be restored holy
[36:09] again please help me brother brown i
[36:11] have a devil in me help me will you lay
[36:14] your hands upon me and restore me again
[36:18] i want you to know when it is
[36:37] how many of you come to me and say i'm
[36:38] not worthy
[37:42] you have not sinned here's the answer
[37:45] you have not sinned my friend so far in
[37:47] god but what you can be restored
[37:50] if you had sinned so far that you could
[37:52] not be restored you'd never want to be
[37:55] restored see
[37:57] but as long as there is something
[37:59] dealing with your heart you're still in
[38:02] line
[38:16] uh
[38:29] little white one
[38:32] or adultery
[38:34] that's goodbye
[38:35] you're guilty of the whole thing
[38:39] you say just a little tiny little line
[38:43] you're just as guilty
[39:39] that itself is the proof that god is
[39:41] still dealing with
[39:46] you've probably gotten nervous
[39:54] here
[39:56] probably satan telling you that you
[39:58] can't be restored he's a lion certainly
[40:01] he is
[40:03] that's why
[41:10] the question now will you lay hands upon
[41:12] me and free from them
[41:29] sure i'd lay hands on you but that
[41:32] wouldn't for
[41:42] he puts his hands upon you and that
[41:44] would not free you
[42:00] interpretation of the word perfect
[42:05] the only thing is to express the word
[42:08] the perfect word that has been given
[42:11] if brother branham was here
[42:14] i'm sure
[42:29] eddie i'm going to read it again
[42:39] sure i'd lay hands on you
[42:42] but that
[43:24] call ourselves john's but we're a bunch
[43:26] of giants
[43:27] they were there
[43:30] so what would free you is
[43:33] to understand
[43:35] but you are already
[43:51] uh
[44:30] but that still wouldn't set you free
[44:32] until you accept
[44:34] what
[44:44] how many times
[45:41] god's children
[45:57] upon them
[46:34] that's where you get freedom and
[46:36] justification when you're willing to say
[46:38] i'm sinned i'm wrong that's
[46:45] [Applause]
[46:54] is
[47:20] [Applause]
[47:50] i have fallen
[48:04] absolutely
[48:17] that shows that god dropped the
[48:30] move right on up into the rest of the
[48:32] ears
[50:05] [Applause]
[50:49] from the book
[50:52] what shall i do with jesus called christ
[50:56] that is your faith age 16
[51:02] okay
[51:32] that's not easy for a person to go to
[51:34] hello
[52:02] told you it was wrong
[52:07] but you continually run through the red
[52:09] line
[52:11] you run over the barricades
[52:14] you're reckless
[52:30] that's not easy
[53:11] he's
[53:54] you better get
[55:14] what are you trying to hide
[57:22] the holy spirit
[58:26] the name
