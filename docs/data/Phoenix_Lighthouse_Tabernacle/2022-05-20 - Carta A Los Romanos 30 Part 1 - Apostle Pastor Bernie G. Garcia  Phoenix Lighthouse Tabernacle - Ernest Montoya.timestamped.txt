[12:58] [Music]
[13:18] know
[13:22] [Music]
[13:25] oh
[13:27] [Music]
[13:58] how many of you love god
[14:28] so open up
[14:40] and the judgment day
[14:56] rather we've
[15:11] eve to the serpent and so forth
[15:13] but on that day
[15:15] won't be able to pass back to anybody
[15:19] our very own conscience
[15:20] will be standing right there
[15:24] now this person
[16:34] stand before god
[16:40] and the books were opened
[16:42] the books were opened
[17:02] everyone
[17:14] you've done while you've been here on
[17:15] the earth
[17:26] the book of life
[17:40] and the dead were judged out of those
[17:42] things which were written in the books
[17:44] according to their works
[17:50] first of all we see that there are there
[17:52] are books
[17:57] and these books are the sinners books
[18:02] what happens
[18:06] that when a person
[18:08] repents
[18:10] accepts the gospel
[18:39] to be a son of god one an eternal god
[18:43] an eternal son of god
[18:47] we see then
[18:50] that there are books open
[19:22] or two or three witnesses
[19:33] you might try to dodge that
[19:35] but when you do that who concerns your
[19:38] conscience
[19:41] comes and testifies the same thing
[19:45] and it says i say amen to what that book
[19:47] says
[20:45] he covered it
[21:01] [Music]
[21:14] another book was
[21:43] that i'm with you which we'll be judging
[21:48] now let's see revelation 22.
[21:53] verse 18.
[22:21] unto every man that hears the words of
[22:23] the prophecy of this book if any man
[22:25] shall add unto these things god shall
[22:27] add unto him the plagues are written in
[22:28] this book
[22:41] and if any man shall take away from the
[22:42] words of the book of this prophecy that
[22:44] takes away god shall take away his part
[22:46] out of the book of life
[22:48] beautiful says
[22:50] this locker see it feels dislocated
[23:06] 20.
[23:12] on verse 15.
[23:16] we see that
[23:17] we read here from the brother
[23:19] this is two books here illegally
[23:36] and whosoever was not found written in
[23:38] the book of life was cast into the lake
[23:40] of fire
[23:42] so there's there is a danger
[23:44] for your name
[23:47] should be taken out of the book of life
[24:15] written in the book of life
[24:30] from god's
[24:45] and verse 2
[24:47] chapter 4
[24:48] verse 2 first corinthians
[25:01] moreover it is required in stewards that
[25:03] a man be found faithful
[25:16] but with me it is a very small thing
[25:18] that i should be judged of you or of
[25:20] man's judgment yea i judge not mine own
[25:23] self
[26:35] the bible says
[28:53] until the lord come who will who both
[28:55] will bring to light the hidden things of
[28:57] the dark side will make manifest the
[28:58] councils of the hearts and that shall
[29:00] then shall every man have praise of god
[29:02] amen
[29:06] there's something there that goes off
[29:08] into something else i'll just leave
[29:20] 524
[30:06] it was presented
[30:17] is
[30:48] is
[31:02] other our lives
[31:05] through the world
[31:07] because it brings to the surface
[31:12] but when this happens
[31:14] there's another one that hides
[31:16] that covers himself
[31:57] house
[32:12] each one of us will change
[32:48] foreign
[33:09] that's page 434 of the hebrew book
[33:16] but the wicked are in a place of waiting
[33:18] and torment with you for their judgment
[34:18] someone
[34:33] at right now look look at luke's chapter
[34:35] 16.
[34:39] 16 verse 22 of luke
[34:43] hermano hermano juan alvarado foreign
[35:14] 22.
[35:25] and it came to pass that the beggar died
[35:26] and was carried by the angel unto
[35:28] abraham's bosom the rich man also died
[35:30] and was buried
[35:34] the dagger died and was taken to
[35:35] abraham's bosom
[35:38] and the rich man also died
[35:40] and was buried
[35:42] verse
[35:52] and in hell he lifted up his eyes being
[35:54] in torment and seeing abraham afar off
[35:56] and nazareth
[36:16] and he cried and said father abraham
[36:18] have mercy on me and send lazarus that
[36:20] he may dip the tip of his finger in the
[36:23] water and cool my tongue for i am
[36:25] tormented in this flame conformed
[36:28] according to the word
[36:31] he was a so-called believer
[36:36] and he says father abraham
[36:38] he
[37:20] it's like a person that
[38:01] sentence to death
[38:04] [Music]
[38:29] is
[39:03] should i change subjects
[39:09] i continue reading
[39:43] now therefore there is no condemnation
[39:46] for them who are in christ jesus to walk
[39:47] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[39:52] no i agree with you there is no judgment
[40:06] [Music]
[40:25] matthew
[40:26] 7.
[40:35] you know where
[40:51] i'll be picking it up in my field from
[40:53] where i live after matthew 7.
[41:09] not everyone that says unto me lord lord
[41:11] shall enter into the kingdom of heaven
[41:13] but he that does the will of my father
[41:15] which is in heaven
[41:29] many will say to me in that day lord
[41:32] lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[41:34] and in thy name cast out devils and i
[41:36] name that many wonderful things
[41:37] wonderful works
[41:45] before going to the radio station this
[41:46] morning
[41:58] i forget the man's name
[43:10] rule the
[43:38] profession for them
[43:41] i never knew you apart
[43:45] depart from me that work in equity
[43:50] in other words one
[43:51] worker of inequity
[44:52] therefore whosoever hears these things
[44:54] in mind and does does them i will liken
[44:56] him unto a wise man which built the
[44:57] house his house upon a rock it is
[45:07] and the rain descended and the floods
[45:09] came and the winds blew and beat upon
[45:11] that house and it fell not for it was
[45:12] found upon a rock
[45:22] and everyone that hears my these saints
[45:24] the mind and does them not shall be
[45:26] likened into a foolish man which built
[45:27] his house upon the sand
[45:39] and the rain descended and the wood the
[45:41] floods came and the winds blew and beat
[45:43] upon that house and it fell and great
[45:45] was the fall of it
[45:49] now the scriptures that we read in
[45:50] romano in romans
[45:53] chapter two
[45:56] reverses consciousness
[46:26] that's
[46:54] amen over there
[46:57] the witnesses will be there against you
[46:59] amen and your own country will say amen
[47:02] yes
[47:03] i didn't send them alive
[47:10] i went to church just to have a good
[47:11] time i was garden over here look for a
[47:13] girlfriend i would get an overview look
[47:14] for a boyfriend
[47:17] to look fine for our social standings
[47:22] i don't really
[47:29] [Applause]
[47:34] through his word
[47:44] for this morning
[48:09] jesus went unto the mount of olives and
[48:12] early in the morning he came again into
[48:13] the temple
[48:15] and all the people came unto him and he
[48:16] sat down and taught them entonces
[48:37] to him a woman taken in adultery and
[48:39] when they had said her in the midst they
[48:41] said unto him master this woman was
[48:43] taken adultery in the very act now moses
[48:46] and the law commanded us that such
[48:48] should be
[48:49] such should be stoned but what says
[49:01] this they said tempting him
[49:04] and they
[49:06] that they might have to accuse him but
[49:08] jesus took down with his finger wrote on
[49:10] the ground as though he heard them not
[49:25] so when they continued asking him he
[49:27] lifted up himself and said unto them he
[49:30] that is without sin among you let him
[49:32] cast first cast a stone at her
[49:38] and again he stood down and wrote on the
[49:40] ground
[49:57] it being convicted by their own
[49:58] conscience went out one by one beginning
[50:01] at the eldest even unto the last and
[50:03] jesus was left alone and the woman
[50:05] standing in the midst
[50:08] the greek says
[50:38] 2 and verse 16.
[50:49] in the day when god shall judge the
[50:52] secrets of men by jesus christ according
[50:54] to my gospel
[51:01] right there before them was jesus christ
[51:05] then he starts writing on the ground
[51:34] and scribes
[51:35] [Music]
[52:23] [Music]
[52:30] none of them turned
[53:25] where the truth is
[53:39] right
