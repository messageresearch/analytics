what they come here Lord waiting foreign [Music] once again brother and good morning it's good to be here with you you know before it uh it passes before I forget I want to congratulate my brother my brother Isaiah is on Wednesday I had the privilege to be at Phoenix Tabernacles Phoenix where he was baptized I was able to be a witness of this great event it was a privilege to be there you know to be there with my family you know be there with with brother Casa's family no it was a privilege to be there so we can all continue to pray for one another continue to pray for our brothers who chose to make that decision and like I said we were able to be a witness this is a great event you know we just uh about two weeks ago I had the privilege of going to San Luis I was able to go with our associate pastor pastors and our brothers it's always the privilege to travel with them you know this time it was a little bit different no I'm used to maybe uh when I go when the Warriors not getting up as early because I don't have to I was at my parents house right everybody meets there I can get up 15 minutes before and before five o'clock you know shower brush my teeth get ready very fast and my brother was gonna drive and it was because of this because of how much I was looking forward to it and something that I had been asking for yeah and asking foreign it happened there in a simple spot it was just it's something because of the Great Expectations because I did my part I was looking forward to it you're talking about it and it was it was a privilege to listen to the message the day I died and that's what our brother Javier spoken you know and I'm not gonna get it too much into that I just want you to know that the peoples love you they want to shake your hands you know they're they're praying for you pray for the people in San Luis San Luis you know and uh it's uh like I said it was just something that I had a great expectation you know um and this morning I would like to if you would stand for a moment to return to our base scripture in Hebrews 9. you might be thinking you know you already spoke quite a bit and just get into this or he already talked a lot but that comes towards my time too even though we're just starting for the scripture Hebrews chapter 9 verse 11 is but Christ being come and a high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say out of this building or neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered into in once in once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us is the 13th for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the fleshos is how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God foreign you know where it's the Lord he presents to Moses speaking on what Aaron his brother should do the high priest so that's that's um what's reading being read here in Hebrews in chapter nine it's referring back Leviticus 16. and then you can read it on your own oh what's happening it was the whole process that's why when we read it it's in uh in 14 in verse 14. Hebrews chapter nine how much more the blood of Christ right so because it's saying if you know if the if the blood of bulls and goats how much more the blood of Christ so he's again he's referring to Leviticus for his for his sins he would take a bull um and he he would one was for his sins and his household and then the other was a sacrifice and then you know he would put on the garments and then he would he would uh take two goats and he would take the ram El carnero and then the process would start I'm not going to get into too much details right where he would he would kill London he would he would he would kill the excuse me the bull and then he would offer the sacrifice of the ram that was for him his atonement and for his household and then for this two two goats he would say and he would be for the sins of the people yeah so the one that would take the blame exactly the one that would take the blame and so that this was the process you know when he would kill first you know then he would take the the incense and then and the blood and he would sprinkle it upon the mercy seats and that's why we can read it here right everything that we've been reading in this in these uh in the description from from 11 to 14. it's referring back and I just mentioned this because it's what would come to mind when we would read this base scripture I know many of you might already know this but I just wanted to share that so after Aaron would do this process for himself he would do the same with a goats are the people right and then he would do the incense upon the mercy seats there was a certain direction he had to be Direction a certain amount of sprinkles Rocio and then after this was to happen yes you would take the second goats because remember it was two goats and he would put his hands upon it and he would confess the iniquities of the people and the transgressions he would send it to the Wilderness and that's what would happen and they would do all this upon the mercy seats and you know now we recognize we read it here in Hebrews how much more shall the blood of Christ because we understand that's the one sitting on The Mercy Seat now our Lord Jesus Christ he's the one that pleased for us that's all that's that they're referring to ISO when they go back and when we read this Hebrew this base scriptures and I recommend for you to read this book of Leviticus and if you want to get a little more detail of what I said you know and we and it's I recommend it to you it's it's uh it's something that we can take a lot from when we read these scriptures maybe it clicks a little bit more okay and I know um our time is almost up I just wanted to share that with you because it's something that I I wanted us all to be on the same page so that's why we say how much more shall the blood of Christ that's why we repeat it so much because if this was what was done now how much more blood of Christ bien he's like I'm very happy a lot of you are sincere okay didn't do it many years ago I asked the congregation how many of you did the homework and they all raised their hand amen and the homework he had was to read Hebrews 15. and there is no Hebrews 15. here on a man and then Bernie was just like you just tell me the truth he says a little bit more but he says that to start off but um like we spoke he continues on the three stages of Grace you know he makes an emphasis I say emphasis in how it is that we have to do our part right to be justified you know we know that Lord we just we just read it you know how much more shall the blood of Christ you make the decision shall the blood of Christ foreign [Applause] I really like everything my brother Paula was talking about really touched on a lot of things that I've been thinking about lately as well but first I'd like to thank each one of you for being here this morning I know it takes effort to be here Sunday morning especially this morning I went outside I felt like it was really cold so I thank you for overcoming that and coming here this morning no it's cold out there but fortunately we have a nice warm place where we can Gathering like brother Brandon once said he says it's a it's a terrible day out there but it's a good day in here and that's how I feel this this day is it's all about perspective and it's all about the right attitude correct you know in that same message brother Branham also says he gives an example he says it's outside there was a man outside and it was raining and he says such a terrible day but then comes another man and he says oh it's a wonderful day brother and the other the other man tells him why do you say it's a wonderful day he says what one year ago the doctor told me I had a week left to live so every day is a wonderful day so we're going to continue this morning what's the topic we've been going on for quite some time now which is the Plan of Redemption and so we always go through the definitions of what it is uh what Redemption is what a plan is so what I have here is some definitions of what a plan is the first one I have is it's a detailed proposal for doing or achieving something um but it's also an intention or decision about what one is going to do and based on what all of our brothers have been speaking on is no we have different uh definitions of what Redemption is no one of them is it's the action of saving or being saved from sin error or evil the other one we have is the action of regaining or gaining possession of something in exchange for payment or clearing a debt and the other one is the act of making something better or more acceptable so knowing what a plan is knowing what Redemption is I believe that it's a plan to save from sin yeah it's a plan to regain possession and it's the plan to make something better or more acceptable so then you have to ask the questions or I ask myself the questions regained possession of who you and I those dead make who better or more acceptable once again that's you and I know he wants me to reach a better place to be better people and be better Christians so when you think of this plan how did this plan come about when did he come up with this plan was it a couple hundred years ago was it a couple thousand years ago well brother Brandon gives us an answer to that question in the message Hope preached in 1955 you know he says did you know Redemption was even before the Plan of Redemption was laid out before the world was ever formed he says think of that is God forcing and making a way of redemption before he even made the world so just reading that part in itself it makes me see how how rich and mercy God is it makes me thankful for that amazing grace before even the world was made God already had a plan laid out for us and brother Branham continues he says for the Bible plainly says that Christians was predestinated sorry that Christ was predestinated for ordained and was the Lamb of God foreign next of it it's a comprehensive plan what does that mean it means it's complete yes it means it includes all elements or aspects of something important but what else it's a far-reaching plan what does that means that it's important and it's widely applicable it has widely applicable effects or implications some synonyms it's profound it's profundo it's extensive it's all embracing and so here I believe God has a plan for all of us and here's where I tie this in with what my brother Paolo spoke on he has a plan for us God does his part we have to do our part so we have to ask ourselves or I ask myself is how do I do my part well one little uh key thing that brother banham told us is he tells us that the plant's already made he says redemption's already paid for is the only thing you have to do is accepted so that's something that sounds so simple but do we do it no it sounds so easy but do we do it but I say that for myself because I I've been thinking about lately because it seems like the the simplest things are sometimes the hardest to do no for example foreign you say well yeah that's easy oh yeah but remember you can't hold grudges you have to learn how to forgive then all of a sudden it's not so easy maybe you're thinking about it twice well maybe it's not that easy and I mean we have like the scripture says some of our brothers have mentioned that before in Revelations and I'm paraphrasing a little bit you know when he says to take the little book eat it up it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in that mouth sweet as honey so my understanding is it's easy to talk about easy to preach about it difficult to digest it or difficult to live you know and there's like but we have to do it you know there's that saying that they that's there's that saying you know talk to talk well now you gotta walk the walk you see look I says yes meaning you gotta whatever you preach you gotta practice and so I use myself as an example no I'm no longer I'm not a child I know right from wrong I know what I'm supposed to do but yeah I still fall but what matters is that you get back up you know it's okay to fall it's not okay it's staying in that Fallen State there's a saying I've heard before they say it's okay to be weak it's not okay to stay weak you can be weak we have to put in that effort to get stronger each day yeah we get stronger we stay in the word of God you do what we have to do we do our part you know like sometimes you know you find ourselves in iniquity you know and this this is something that clicked in my mind it's like okay it's a message I heard a while back I believe it was brother Javier he was talking about it it was titled the sin iniquities you know and then there he you know we hear the definition of what it is what is Iniquity is you know and it's the definition I've always heard which is it's doing the knowing something's wrong but still doing it but when it clicked for me is when he switched it around he says it's knowing what the right thing is that for me it made a big impact it changed the way I look at things once again something so simple yeah it made such a big impact when I thought about it it's this little small things no my brother here does something nice for me something nice and I know that the right thing to do is to say thank you gracias but I don't know did I do something bad that in itself is Iniquity when we think about Sin iniquity a lot of times we think of the big picture stuff which is this is but we forget about the small details but God is so merciful but even then he's with us no I want to do God's perfect will I know you want to do God's perfect but unfortunately so we find ourselves in God's permissive Wills maybe you had a bad attitude there's just a couple words I had for you this morning I hope they served at least for some sort of encouragement that's something that I find myself in need sometimes you know that's how I am sometimes I get discouraged you know I'm I'm myself toughest criticism you know I judge everything I do sometimes I feel like I need to encourage myself and we have to keep pushing forward each day no matter how difficult close your eyes dear heavenly father thank you for this this beautiful morning for giving us a place together Lord you have a purpose in for all of us include us in your plan of redemptions Lord and not even just us but our families our loved ones and I'm thankful for that this morning I ask that you be with our brothers who are here Lord those who are watching via internet whether they have a need a petition Thanksgiving you provide them what they need and you continue blessing their efforts so as we go about this week is we help those in school we help those at work wherever we find ourselves but I thank
