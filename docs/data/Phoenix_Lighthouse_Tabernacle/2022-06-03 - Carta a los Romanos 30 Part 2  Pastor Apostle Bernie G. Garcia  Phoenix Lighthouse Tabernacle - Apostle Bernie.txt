========================================
[Music] [Music] um [Music] man [Music] um [Music] huh [Music] right [Music] huh [Music] hmm [Music] hey [Music] hey [Music] so [Music] [Music] my [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] this [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] and [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] hey [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] my and [Music] hey [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] and then [Music] [Music] the like figure where unto even baptism does also now save us not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good conscience toward god by the resurrection of jesus christ so baptism is necessary actually it's the first step that a person takes that he takes public to let the whole world know that he is a christian now one thing is [Music] during the last 20 years he was a bank robber and who knows and repents in his heart then he says i accept you jesus christ the question is when he accepts jesus christ was he forgiven washed by the blood of jesus christ looks at him we know this is a genuine has he repented is it possible but then when he sees him go down to the water to the water l he is now clean but in order for the whole world to receive it and believe it is i'm going to start reading from chap from verse 1 of acts chapter 10. here we have cornelius [Music] 5 says and now send men to joppa and call for one simon whose surname is peter he lodges with one simon tanner whose house is by the sea side he shall tell thee what thou art to do peter had already been converted is that right peter had already been converted but see peter's conversion still had not taken away from him his love his desire to be about the scene peter was a tremendous fisherman when he was resting in the desert way inside when the angel of which spake unto cornelius was departed he called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually and when he had declared all these things into them he sent them to japan [Music] they were on all their way to japan remember he was at home and there she was preparing the food he went up to the top of the house to wait for the food to be established he was there praying to the lord he was hungry was just killing him like we said brazil he was very how much see the seems like the and then verse 47 video then peter answered can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized which have received the holy ghost as well as we he bought and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the lord first of all follow them over there in baptism is not greater than what god has done in their lives god has already come to witnesses but they're claiming they're clean vessels can one of you forbid i order you to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ while he yet spake these words the holy ghost fell and then peter said can we forbid water seeing that these receive the holy ghost like we did up there i believe their sins were already gone and he would not have come in unless they had been predestinated vessels present that had that idea of circumcision that they would not accept them to be baptized first of all put himself into them so no one could forbid water to them don't be impatient i'm almost finished just ask yourself the question and now why terrorists now arise and be baptized and wash away thy sins calling on the name of the lord now here's the question just arise be baptized and wash away thy sense had his sins already been forgiven be and another one says no they weren't forgiven and there's a theological difference they get mad pull their hair out they walk out mad isn't that right uh calling on the name of the lord same thing accept jesus christ i believe paul the reason he had to be baptized again is he had persecuted the christians foreign and when he noticed saul was down there in the room blackened face and darkened eyes and he he'd prayed so hard and dust all over him and he was blinded from the pillar of fire that appeared to him on the road down there and he said i have chosen him a vessel to the gentiles god knew that ananias god knew yo god knew that ananias would be able to baptize him in the name of jesus christ in the damascus river three days later but i believe that his sins were already remitted but he had to do this did you have accepted he was a as [Music] in the name of the lord jesus christ [Music] [Applause] hey oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] is
