[6:16] getting ready for our
[6:22] Exodus it's oh it's such a beautiful
[6:27] thing the whole scripture just ties
[6:30] together it's one big
[6:35] story now this morning we're we're still
[6:39] in the book of we is going to take the
[6:41] first three chapters of of the book of
[6:54] Ephesians Paul's letter to the Ephesians
[6:58] Ephesus trying positionally placing the
[7:08] church and just before we approach it
[7:11] could we just spare another moment or
[7:13] two for prayer just before we
[7:22] do oh Lord Our God we are coming into
[7:26] thy presence now
[7:34] as unworthy as we are yet we know that
[7:38] there is a blood sacrifice there
[7:47] waiting cleansing us from all
[7:50] uncleanness and presenting us before the
[7:53] father blameless
[7:58] faultless
[8:04] not nothing that we could ever do to
[8:06] Merit
[8:09] this but because that Jesus has done
[8:13] this for us we bow humbly to his
[8:17] presence and his
[8:26] name asking that you'll send the holy
[8:29] spirit this morning in our
[8:35] midst and is not being a theologian or
[8:40] knowing how to set scripture in
[8:45] order but just enthused and grateful to
[8:49] the feeling of the Holy Spirit as it
[8:52] moves through
[8:58] my
[9:01] may it bless all of us together as we
[9:03] read thy written
[9:05] word that it might become to us life
[9:17] eternal granted father we ask it in
[9:20] Jesus name and for Jesus sake
[9:28] amen
[9:35] now I might say in here first that if
[9:39] anytime that I might say something that
[9:42] would be
[9:44] disagreeable not setting just
[9:54] right may be absolutely wrong to your
[9:58] teaching or something that you could not
[10:01] agree
[10:08] with I'm trusting the holy spirit that
[10:12] he'll make it so seasoned and so sweet
[10:16] until there'll no be no offense at
[10:28] all it'll be through love and
[10:31] fellowship that that's what it's it's
[10:33] meant that
[10:42] way and this all begin with the sermon
[10:45] last Sunday I believe it was last Sunday
[10:47] morning as the rejected
[10:56] came have anybody got the tape yet
[11:00] yet I think they've got him and you can
[11:03] have him if you wish them the rejected
[11:13] King now just a few days and we'll be
[11:16] beginning at up at the Middletown
[11:24] Ohio in Middletown oh we want all that
[11:28] has their
[11:29] their vacation Station for that time to
[11:31] be sure to meet with us there because
[11:34] we're expecting a great time of
[11:36] fellowship at Middletown
[11:51] OH Dr is the chairman I think of the
[11:57] committee
[11:59] and there'll be five nights of it I'll
[12:01] be preaching as the the the guest
[12:04] speaker at the International Convention
[12:07] of the inter denominational
[12:18] church and then then after that will be
[12:21] our own meeting from then
[12:27] on
[12:29] we have got it staged till the
[12:34] 12th but under the understanding that we
[12:37] may go on through even another week
[12:39] after
[12:44] that just depends on how the Holy Spirit
[12:50] leads we all want to be led by the
[12:56] spirit just what the spirit says do then
[12:59] do it
[13:04] quickly and let's remember while we're
[13:06] obeying the spirit one great lesson that
[13:09] we want to learn is never be hastely
[13:21] amen take your time have
[13:26] faith if we have asked got anything
[13:29] remember God answers
[13:37] prayer he does it in his time the way
[13:40] it's best makes it work just right for
[13:49] us and if that isn't so then what are we
[13:52] doing here this
[13:57] morning what are we climing Christianity
[14:02] for God this isn't the word of God then
[14:06] it isn't true then we are found among
[14:08] people most
[14:18] miserable I'm so glad to join hearts
[14:22] with many here that know that this is
[14:25] the infallible word of God it's
[14:35] that it is every word the truth every
[14:38] word of it every phase of
[14:48] it and with the grace of
[14:51] God have been privileged to view the
[14:54] land amen of which someday we shall
[15:06] travel yesterday people don't know what
[15:09] depressing times comes with this type of
[15:17] ministry I got real depressed and I said
[15:21] to the wife I wish I could just go
[15:27] on she said why you say that
[15:31] bill I said oh here I have troubles
[15:38] and then seemed like the holy spirit
[15:40] said are you trying to bypass
[15:45] him are you are you trying to dodge
[15:51] them no I said just let me stand right
[15:55] up in the face of all of it and face it
[15:57] out see just
[16:06] it's so much
[16:07] [Music]
[16:09] better honestly
[16:12] truly I say this by IE
[16:16] witness that just after this life is
[16:19] over we enter a land that's beyond
[16:23] anything that anyone can
[16:27] amen
[16:39] and if there be any strangers here I
[16:41] trust that you do not I pray to God that
[16:45] you do not consider me a
[16:54] fanatic I I want if anything is to be
[16:57] honest then to tell the
[17:03] truth then what good would have do me to
[17:07] tell something that was wrong when
[17:09] there's so there's so much as here is
[17:17] true why we have to tell anything wrong
[17:19] about it
[17:24] see it's it's just
[17:27] TR then no wonder I believe Paul was
[17:32] caught up into the third
[17:38] heaven and he saw things that it wasn't
[17:41] expedient for him to speak
[17:45] of and one day he said I has not seen
[17:49] ears not heard or has it either entered
[17:51] the heart of man what God has for them
[17:55] in store that love
[17:57] him you
[18:07] oh we're just
[18:08] [Music]
[18:10] living we're living in a dump pile down
[18:13] here that's all just a rubbish sheat
[18:16] full of of smoldering smoke from
[18:27] filth
[18:30] even if we are not contaminated with it
[18:32] ourselves we are living in it where the
[18:35] smoke is coming from smoking emeralds of
[18:49] sin one of the most sickening things I
[18:51] can think of is an old city dump of
[18:57] burning
[19:01] was you ever near
[19:03] one that horrible contaminated smell of
[19:09] smoke coming up through all kinds of
[19:17] Filth you get a breath of it and just
[19:20] turns you
[19:25] around I remember having go down to new
[19:27] Alby down on the below 18th Street there
[19:30] where the old dump used to
[19:39] be I'd have to cleck down in there and
[19:42] read
[19:45] meters and I just dreaded to day when I
[19:48] was Route 18 when I had to take that
[19:50] down in there because it was to smell
[19:54] that horrible
[19:57] smell
[20:06] laying out on there was bodies of rats
[20:09] and dogs and everything you know that
[20:11] was smoldering and that old smoke coming
[20:15] up to
[20:23] it now yet that is what this life is
[20:28] compared to that's
[20:35] best just a
[20:37] sming sin just smells from everywhere as
[20:41] it was spiritually speaking yes
[20:51] amen where the wind is blowing free and
[20:56] everything is love Lely and peace and
[21:00] joy and eternal life just across the
[21:13] river but we're in a
[21:17] battle so let's not just lay down and
[21:20] say let's hurry up and get over there
[21:21] let's bring everyone with us that we can
[21:27] bring
[21:33] that's and now the purpose of these
[21:36] lessons is to Anchor those that have
[21:39] already come across the
[21:42] land
[21:49] see the purpose of this studying this
[21:51] book of Ephesians is to positionally
[21:54] place the church where it absolutely
[21:58] abolutely stands in
[22:09] Christ it is a type of the Old Testament
[22:12] and the Book of
[22:20] Joshua suay we had where Joshua led the
[22:25] lands to each man
[22:32] and he had done it by
[22:36] inspiration how
[22:38] Moses was brought the people out of
[22:42] Egypt the garlic
[22:49] Le out and gave them a place to where
[22:53] God had promised 400 years later 400
[22:56] years before that he would bring them
[22:59] into a place of goodly land flown with
[23:02] milk and
[23:13] honey and Moses led the children of
[23:16] Israel right up to the land but did not
[23:19] take them
[23:26] over Jesus do the spiritual do the
[23:31] people that we were been promised the
[23:32] Holy Spirit since the
[23:43] beginning led us up to the
[23:47] [Music]
[23:48] promise
[23:50] but a Holy Spirit came at Joshua to take
[23:54] over and lead and direct and to possess
[23:57] the land man or possess the church
[24:08] amen we find out basically then that in
[24:15] our now here's where maybe people might
[24:19] think that I am rude and trying
[24:26] to
[24:30] I am
[24:32] not God be my judge I am
[24:37] not I'm only trying to point out
[24:40] something that is a truth
[24:46] see we have chosen leaders of man
[24:50] instead of leading leaders leadings of
[24:53] the Holy
[24:56] Spirit
[25:02] we have wanted man to lot out our part
[25:05] and lead
[25:10] us denominations like Methodist Baptist
[25:14] Presbyterian Lutheran Church of Christ
[25:17] Pentecostal and different denominations
[25:20] to set an organization as an example we
[25:23] follow
[25:26] that
[25:38] but we are nowhere in the Bible are we
[25:42] to do such as
[25:48] that there isn't one Texas scripture in
[25:52] all of God's Bible where he ever
[25:54] organize the
[25:56] church
[26:02] or were he ever spoke of an
[26:09] organization not one place in the
[26:12] Bible but always contrary to
[26:19] it he doesn't want us to be fashion like
[26:22] the things of the
[26:26] world wants us
[26:28] pecular set
[26:32] aside I don't mean now to be silly as we
[26:36] call
[26:38] it I mean to be a called out people
[26:48] amen oh blessed holy nation Hallelujah
[26:53] living lives that's above
[26:56] reproach oh
[27:04] acting behaving
[27:06] ourselves just like he would working in
[27:13] us for we are his
[27:16] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[27:21] good
[27:26] works now Wednesday night many of you
[27:28] was here Wednesday
[27:33] night but we got into the I believe it's
[27:36] the third verse oh it's the fifth
[27:46] verse onto the
[27:48] adoption or
[27:51] placing of the
[27:56] people how they God trying to place his
[28:03] people and when God places one then all
[28:07] the whole church wants to be like that
[28:14] one have the same kind of things do the
[28:17] same
[28:20] things we are cut out different we're
[28:23] made different we are nature different
[28:27] and we are positionally placed
[28:40] different each one different
[28:45] work maybe one for just a little kind of
[28:49] a work another for a large
[28:56] work believe it was David or one of the
[28:59] prophets I forget
[29:02] [Music]
[29:03] now said I would rather be a doormat at
[29:08] the house of the
[29:09] Lord yes amen than to be to dwell in the
[29:13] tents with the the
[29:23] wicked now we're going to stop just a
[29:26] second on the adoption the fifth verse
[29:29] trying to get down as far as we possibly
[29:32] can on
[29:39] it but I remember the theme it is all
[29:43] together on
[29:51] placing how many understand
[29:54] that let's sure you say it with one word
[29:57] word
[30:03] placing the
[30:05] body of Jesus
[30:13] Christ in
[30:16] Christ INR where the Holy Spirit the
[30:20] holy is leading
[30:26] us there you are now we got it
[30:31] SE positionally placing us the book of
[30:35] EP is to do
[30:40] that and watch this master teacher
[30:47] Paul the first thing he does is knock
[30:50] out all the idea of falling
[30:55] away yes amen
[31:01] knock out all the idea of ever being a
[31:04] Christian today and tomorrow I'm gone
[31:06] and the next day God's condem me the
[31:08] next day I'm back
[31:17] again and that's
[31:23] nonsense now this is this book is not
[31:26] address to Evangelistic teaching

[31:46] church for Paul addressed it to the
[31:51] Saints those that are called and
[31:54] preserved and are filled and are are set
[31:58] aside and are in the Holy Spirit already
[32:01] in canaan's
[32:09] land he's trying to tell them the first
[32:13] saying get it out of your mind amen that

[1:05:33] blood because sometimes we want to feel

[1:05:43] worthy father father help
[1:05:46] us we play ourselves in your

[1:06:09] hands in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:06:12] Christ
[1:06:14] amen taking advantage that we're
[1:06:16] standing we'll be going into the
[1:06:20] scripture it's which is a base scripture
[1:06:22] which we've been using
[1:06:25] we'll be Genesis 1
[1:06:29] 1-5 and then we'll be reading 11 and
[1:06:35] 12 in the beginning God created the
[1:06:37] Heaven and the
[1:06:39] [Music]
[1:06:46] Earth and the Earth was without form and
[1:06:48] void and darkness was upon the face of
[1:06:50] the deep and the spirit of God moved
[1:06:52] upon the face of the waters
[1:06:56] and God said let there be light and
[1:06:58] there was
[1:07:03] light and God saw the light that it was
[1:07:06] good and God divided the light from the
[1:07:14] darkness and God called the light day
[1:07:17] and the Darkness he called night in the
[1:07:18] evening and the morning were the first
[1:07:20] day then we'll be going to
[1:07:22] 11
[1:07:38] and God said let the Earth bring forth
[1:07:39] grass the herb yielding seed and the
[1:07:41] fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind
[1:07:43] who seed this in itself upon the Earth
[1:07:45] and it was
[1:07:52] so
[1:07:57] [Music]
[1:07:59] and Earth brought forth grass and Herb
[1:08:00] yielding seed after its kind and the
[1:08:02] tree yielding fruit whose seed was in
[1:08:04] itself after his kind and God saw that
[1:08:06] it was
[1:08:08] good you may take your seats
[1:08:15] Brothers we know we're speaking on the
[1:08:17] topic of the spoken word is the Original
[1:08:21] Seed and I'd like to add a subtitle
[1:08:26] it's cleansing our
[1:08:29] hearts I'll be speaking a little bit on
[1:08:31] the
[1:08:33] heart I'll be going to another scripture
[1:08:35] just as we are
[1:08:37] seated we're going to Jeremiah
[1:08:40] 17 we'll be reading 9 and
[1:08:49] 10 the heart is deceitful above all
[1:08:52] things and desperately Wicked who can
[1:08:54] know
[1:09:06] it I the Lord search the heart I try the
[1:09:10] Reigns even to give every man according
[1:09:12] to his ways and according to the fruit
[1:09:13] of his
[1:09:17] doings I'll be speaking about a lot of a
[1:09:19] little bit of aspects of the physical
[1:09:22] heart but first I'd like to introduce
[1:09:25] another
[1:09:26] quote to place another
[1:09:36] Foundation message preach the Church of
[1:09:38] the Living God preached 19517
[1:09:48] 27 now the seed you people here who are
[1:09:51] farmers every seed will produce in its
[1:09:53] right kind of a
[1:09:57] [Music]
[1:10:01] ground and every Divine promise of God
[1:10:04] and the Bible will produce if it's met
[1:10:06] in the right kind of a
[1:10:09] heart we'll be reading the highlighted
[1:10:11] part just to move
[1:10:18] forward it's up to Nature to God to
[1:10:20] water it and to see that it produces is
[1:10:22] that true
[1:10:29] it's God to water it to see that it
[1:10:30] produces is that
[1:10:35] true so that's the way you do with the
[1:10:37] word of God accept it in a good
[1:10:42] heart first I'd have to ask a question
[1:10:48] here where does the messenger tell us
[1:10:50] that the land is in our body
[1:10:54] here the messenger showing
[1:10:56] us he's saying that the Earth in our
[1:10:59] heart sorry the Earth in our body is our
[1:11:04] heart in the
[1:11:09] natural if we leave a clean terrain for
[1:11:12] two or three
[1:11:14] months and it we come back automatically
[1:11:17] again it produces
[1:11:21] something but it's not going to produce
[1:11:23] good
[1:11:25] seed because we have not planted good
[1:11:29] seed it automatically is
[1:11:31] wicked
[1:11:34] amen if you plant
[1:11:37] nothing then you expect
[1:11:41] nothing automatically there's pasture
[1:11:44] that you're not
[1:11:47] expecting likewise in our home where we
[1:11:51] live we have to always be doing
[1:11:55] maintenance perhaps those who know about
[1:11:59] Landscaping maybe they go to a house
[1:12:01] once a week or
[1:12:04] twice but if they don't
[1:12:06] go
[1:12:08] automatically something begins to come
[1:12:10] forth or grow amen
[1:12:13] brothers that's the natural
[1:12:18] part and so I started to investigate a
[1:12:21] little
[1:12:22] bit but the messenger
[1:12:26] says when you plant the seed in our
[1:12:30] heart how do we water
[1:12:35] it he says that it's planted in the
[1:12:38] heart but that's God's part it's the
[1:12:42] seed now but what's our
[1:12:45] part is to listen to messages to read
[1:12:48] the Bible to come to
[1:12:51] church that's our part
[1:12:54] when the seed is in our
[1:12:56] hearts seed is the same
[1:12:59] as it int uh the definition is the same
[1:13:02] as a something you
[1:13:07] plant so I did a little bit of research
[1:13:09] in what what allows our heart to
[1:13:12] function according to doctors and
[1:13:18] scientists there there uh it's a process
[1:13:21] of electricity that produces attractions
[1:13:23] in your
[1:13:29] body the body has a Electric System
[1:13:32] called a heart condition
[1:13:36] system and it's a it's a something that
[1:13:39] controls the frequency of your
[1:13:43] heartbeats now I explored where that
[1:13:46] system that heart
[1:13:47] system it comes from the deepest part of
[1:13:50] the
[1:13:52] heart there's some something called the
[1:13:54] sinus
[1:13:55] node it's a muscle that generates
[1:13:59] [Music]
[1:14:01] that and there it's good but after that
[1:14:03] I couldn't find any more on this
[1:14:05] topic because I started to investigate
[1:14:07] and investigate
[1:14:10] more I went back to seeing that it's
[1:14:12] muscle
[1:14:14] threads after that muscle I couldn't
[1:14:16] find anything
[1:14:18] else which is threading or
[1:14:22] fib
[1:14:25] it's according to somebody who has given
[1:14:26] life that's how it gets
[1:14:30] damaged but we truly know that it's God
[1:14:32] who's giving us that
[1:14:38] life heart is used in the different
[1:14:43] types specifically more in this month
[1:14:45] which is of Valentine's
[1:14:48] Day sometimes the couples gave each
[1:14:50] other chocolate
[1:14:52] hearts
[1:14:54] maybe when we were young and we were in
[1:14:57] school we'd get we place on a tree or on
[1:15:00] our
[1:15:02] desk they weren't even our girlfriend
[1:15:04] but it was who we
[1:15:07] liked or the other way around whoever
[1:15:09] the ladies
[1:15:10] like and they would draw a
[1:15:13] heart and an arrow going through
[1:15:19] it it said Cupid but to this day I don't
[1:15:22] know what the arrow means if going
[1:15:23] upwards or
[1:15:26] downwards and there's another
[1:15:29] city that's identified with the
[1:15:31] heart which is the city of New
[1:15:35] York which has as as a sign of a
[1:15:39] heart when we seeing the national
[1:15:42] anthem we see a symbol the flag as a
[1:15:45] symbolic
[1:15:47] sign we place our hand over our
[1:15:51] heart we also when we get scared
[1:15:55] we also grasp onto our chest amen
[1:15:59] amen just a short testimony something
[1:16:01] happened to me a couple weeks
[1:16:03] ago well about a week ago I didn't know
[1:16:05] that it fell my law to
[1:16:10] preach but I was I was out with my wife
[1:16:13] we went out to
[1:16:15] eat and I got a a chest
[1:16:18] pain but I had never gotten that type of
[1:16:21] pain and truly I got
[1:16:28] scared because my father passed away due
[1:16:30] to heart
[1:16:33] problems and I heard of a young man who
[1:16:36] was a soccer
[1:16:39] player after playing a soccer game he
[1:16:41] lied down on his
[1:16:43] couch he rested on the
[1:16:46] couch now he was 19 year old and that's
[1:16:48] where he
[1:16:51] laid and so all these thoughts came to
[1:16:53] my mind at that
[1:16:58] moment I I thought about it tell my wife
[1:17:01] I did complain that my my chest was
[1:17:05] hurting I said Lord if it's my time to
[1:17:08] go and then me make things
[1:17:10] right but truly I don't want to
[1:17:13] die that's the
[1:17:15] TRU how many have gotten scared because
[1:17:18] your your chest
[1:17:20] hurts yes it's true
[1:17:25] you want to see what size your heart
[1:17:27] is perhaps some know and some don't
[1:17:30] know the size that you are if you make a
[1:17:36] fist that's the site that's the size of
[1:17:38] your
[1:17:39] heart for
[1:17:42] example if I weigh 230
[1:17:46] pounds if you weigh 150 P 10% of that
[1:17:51] weight is your blood
[1:17:54] blood so if I weigh 230
[1:17:58] PB then I have 23 lbs worth of
[1:18:01] blood and the size of my
[1:18:06] heart it bumps all throughout all my
[1:18:09] heart with within four to five
[1:18:12] minutes
[1:18:17] amen so approximately in 24 hours it's
[1:18:20] 100 110,000 bumps
[1:18:24] I don't want to go in deeper into
[1:18:28] that but it's an idea that we can know
[1:18:30] how our heart
[1:18:32] functions just a small
[1:18:35] apparatus which maintains our heart our
[1:18:37] body
[1:18:39] functioning I'm going to go to
[1:18:42] scripture we're going to go to Matthew
[1:18:44] 158
[1:18:51] to19
[1:18:54] but those things which proceed out of
[1:18:56] the mouth come forth from the heart and
[1:18:58] they defile the
[1:19:09] man for out of the heart proceed evil
[1:19:12] thoughts murders adulteries fornications
[1:19:14] thefts false witness and blasphemies
[1:19:17] amen
[1:19:18] amen all this comes forth from the
[1:19:21] heart
[1:19:24] and
[1:19:25] unfortunately that we're all
[1:19:28] sick with a sickness called
[1:19:34] sin
[1:19:35] the the Bible tells us that the heart
[1:19:37] soul and spirit will live
[1:19:39] [Music]
[1:19:41] forever I didn't understand this until I
[1:19:43] started to
[1:19:45] study how is it that our heart is going
[1:19:47] to live on
[1:19:49] forever it's simple if you were made in
[1:19:51] God's image uh
[1:19:54] then we're going to have a
[1:19:57] heart I go to Matthew
[1:20:04] 58 blessed are the pure in heart for
[1:20:07] they shall see God amen
[1:20:12] amen the scripture Proverbs
[1:20:21] 4:23 keep th heart with all diligence
[1:20:24] for out of it there are the issues of
[1:20:30] Life the heart is a containment of Faith
[1:20:33] but it's also the basis for
[1:20:38] doubt when God sees man he does not see
[1:20:40] the color of his
[1:20:43] skin he doesn't look at his position or
[1:20:45] the type of clothes that he
[1:20:47] wears God sees his
[1:20:51] heart sometimes the doctor
[1:20:54] perhaps
[1:20:57] now oh perhaps they're now
[1:20:59] white tomorrow they're
[1:21:02] brown another day they're Hispanic or
[1:21:05] whatever color you want to place
[1:21:08] upon but they don't make any difference
[1:21:10] on a heart because it's the same heart
[1:21:12] amen
[1:21:16] amen go to another scripture Amos
[1:21:21] 4:12
[1:21:23] [Music]
[1:21:32] is therefore thus will I do unto thee oh
[1:21:35] Israel and because I will do this unto
[1:21:37] thee prepare to meet thy God o
[1:21:42] Israel but how are we going to go with
[1:21:44] the meeting with our
[1:21:46] God if our heart is not
[1:21:49] well because if there's something
[1:21:51] unclean there
[1:21:53] then I can't go to that
[1:21:55] meeting I can't enter up
[1:21:59] there how much have I given to that seed
[1:22:03] that is in my heart do I listen to tapes

[1:22:11] [Music]

[1:22:16] stethoscope and I place it on my
[1:22:19] brother I believe that I also have to
[1:22:21] place it on myself

[1:22:27] God how your heart is but it's one and
[1:22:31] the
[1:22:32] same I hope that I haven't offended

[1:23:14] mother-in-law my father-in-law amen
[1:23:20] amen if God caus us to love our
[1:23:23] enemies why don't we love our
[1:23:27] in-laws who are part of our
[1:23:32] family oh brother well you don't know
[1:23:35] how they
[1:23:36] are I don't but God
[1:23:39] does I haven't heard it in this
[1:23:42] church I've heard it somewhere else
[1:23:44] don't go thinking that it's
[1:23:47] [Music]
[1:23:49] here our duty is to say and love all
[1:23:51] without an
[1:23:54] exception the rest of the questionnaire
[1:23:56] you can do to
[1:23:58] God our our heart has to be
[1:24:02] clean as the word says or else we cannot
[1:24:05] see
[1:24:06] God we go to Matthew
[1:24:16] 158 this people draweth night unto me
[1:24:19] with their mouth and honth me with their
[1:24:21] lips but their heart is far from
[1:24:25] me how many times do we come to church
[1:24:28] we
[1:24:30] sing we hear the
[1:24:32] preachings we go back
[1:24:34] home we just throw our Bible
[1:24:38] somewhere and next Sunday we can't find
[1:24:40] where we left
[1:24:43] it I believe that there it's written and
[1:24:45] it is for
[1:24:47] us because throughout the week we don't
[1:24:49] listen to
[1:24:51] anything when that happens
[1:24:54] brother we're fulfilling this
[1:24:57] scripture brother Garcia
[1:25:02] says says let the surgeon come and
[1:25:04] remove that Heart of
[1:25:08] Stone I want to jump to Ezekiel
[1:25:21] 36:26
[1:25:31] and new heart also will I give you and
[1:25:33] new spirit will I put within you and I
[1:25:35] will take away the Stony heart out of
[1:25:36] your flesh and I will give a heart of
[1:25:48] Flesh and I will put my spirit within
[1:25:51] you and cause you to walk walk in my
[1:25:52] statuses and ye shall keep my judgments
[1:25:54] and do
[1:25:58] them now you might say brother I had an
[1:26:01] experience with Jesus the question
[1:26:04] is if we already had an experience with
[1:26:07] Jesus a personal encounter with
[1:26:11] God do you think that there could still
[1:26:13] be wickedness in our Earth or our land
[1:26:15] it's just a
[1:26:20] question do you think this enemy can
[1:26:23] still come and plant tears in our land
[1:26:25] or in our
[1:26:33] heart answer is simple is yes sir
[1:26:35] because all those things are what give
[1:26:37] maintenance to our
[1:26:42] heart or brother Milton my heart is
[1:26:45] clean but it is injured it's
[1:26:48] damaged well welcome as
[1:26:51] well we go to Psalms
[1:26:56] 145
[1:27:00] 1453 he heals the
[1:27:03] Brokenhearted and he mend the
[1:27:06] injuries he mens our
[1:27:09] injuries he gives us
[1:27:11] Comfort when we have a legal
[1:27:16] problem and the lawyer says that I can't
[1:27:18] do it no more we're going to wait what
[1:27:21] to see what happens
[1:27:24] and then something happens that's
[1:27:27] unexplainable when there's nothing else
[1:27:29] for the lawyers to
[1:27:30] do that's when God comes into the
[1:27:35] scene when the doctor says that there's
[1:27:37] no more hope for
[1:27:39] you go home and
[1:27:42] die I believe sometimes the doctors are
[1:27:44] a bit
[1:27:49] Savage they tell you well we we don't
[1:27:52] know what to do with you we're already
[1:27:53] spending too much time with you in the
[1:27:54] hospital just go
[1:27:56] home that's when Jesus comes into the
[1:28:01] scene because he goes into cases where
[1:28:04] the human can no longer go
[1:28:06] more he's an expert in that am amen
[1:28:11] brothers let's keep moving
[1:28:19] forward they asked Bill Gates he's
[1:28:21] currently a
[1:28:24] millionaire if he knew somebody who was
[1:28:26] even richer than he
[1:28:28] was he responded with
[1:28:32] yes and he spoke that when he was not a
[1:28:38] millionaire he used to go to the airport
[1:28:40] in New
[1:28:42] York about in 2012
[1:28:46] 2013 and he didn't have any cash to buy
[1:28:51] newspaper and he already had the
[1:28:52] newspaper in his hand and he tells the
[1:28:55] man he told him I don't have the
[1:28:58] cash he says well just keep it it
[1:29:00] doesn't
[1:29:01] matter and then he went by once
[1:29:04] again he once again forgot to carry
[1:29:08] cash well it happened about two or three
[1:29:13] times so when they asked him if he knew
[1:29:15] somebody who was richer than
[1:29:19] him he said yes that it was that man who
[1:29:22] gifted him those
[1:29:24] newspapers because he tried to go
[1:29:26] looking for
[1:29:27] him once he was already a
[1:29:30] milliona he found
[1:29:34] him and he asked him if he wanted
[1:29:36] anything says that he would get him
[1:29:38] whatever he
[1:29:39] wanted there was already an elder
[1:29:42] person he said well I I don't want
[1:29:46] anything he says I give it to you at
[1:29:48] that moment because you needed
[1:29:50] it
[1:29:53] so he says that the Elder didn't take
[1:29:54] anything from
[1:29:57] him that's why he says he was a
[1:29:59] millionaire in rich in
[1:30:03] heart if Bill Gates was able to say that
[1:30:05] to that person who was rich in heart
[1:30:08] great
[1:30:09] heart and they he expressed himself
[1:30:12] about
[1:30:13] that what about us with our Lord Jesus
[1:30:17] Christ there's no way to explain
[1:30:20] it how rich he is in Mercy it's true
[1:30:25] Brothers our brother Garcia
[1:30:28] says that there is no
[1:30:30] Minister there is no
[1:30:35] Minister that could support or withstand
[1:30:37] the people of
[1:30:40] God that could withstand
[1:30:43] them as God can withstand
[1:30:47] us and then you say well brother why are
[1:30:49] you saying
[1:30:50] that
[1:30:56] sometimes we confuse ourselves as a head
[1:30:57] of a
[1:31:00] family perhaps as a leader at
[1:31:04] work now imagine God dealing with all
[1:31:06] the bride around the
[1:31:08] world there's no words to explain
[1:31:16] that he says now that is a great heart
[1:31:19] and a merciful
[1:31:20] one that is so
[1:31:24] merciful that if it weren't for his
[1:31:26] Mercy we wouldn't be
[1:31:30] here when the mind of God told
[1:31:34] Moses he says move I'm going to destroy
[1:31:38] everyone the heart of Christ said he say
[1:31:41] you have to go through me first but not
[1:31:44] through not with
[1:31:45] [Music]
[1:31:47] them when the mind of God said if this
[1:31:50] if it's possible for this CU to pass me
[1:31:55] over but the heart of Christ said let it
[1:31:57] not be mine but your will
[1:32:00] amen as the musicians come
[1:32:06] forth I have here a prayer from the
[1:32:09] messenger that I would like to
[1:32:20] read
[1:32:22] said Heavenly Father you see their hands
[1:32:24] I was watching watching something being
[1:32:27] done he says you know all about it
[1:32:34] father I pray now that your spirit will
[1:32:35] be sweetly upon
[1:32:40] them let them know that this is what I
[1:32:43] have
[1:32:47] said that they can say that from this
[1:32:49] time
[1:32:50] on
[1:32:54] their attitudes have been changed the
[1:32:56] hardness that was in their
[1:32:57] hearts has melted
[1:33:01] [Music]
[1:33:02] away sweet peace and divine love has
[1:33:05] taken its place granted
[1:33:14] father each one of them receive the
[1:33:16] baptism of the love of God in their
[1:33:20] heart
[1:33:22] that they could turn the other cheek go
[1:33:24] to the Second
[1:33:29] Mile like he did with spit on his face
[1:33:31] and thorns on his
[1:33:36] brow with heavens and earth in his hands
[1:33:38] walking meekly to the
[1:33:41] Cross to die for people who were killing
[1:33:48] him God how make us that way father take
[1:33:50] that Stony heart out of
[1:33:54] us and put a real sweet kind heart in
[1:34:01] US put a spirit in us like he's
[1:34:06] got let the spirit of God rest upon each
[1:34:09] of

[1:34:25] you may they sweetly come to
