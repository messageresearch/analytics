[28:37] son our lord jesus christ amen amen

[28:49] you could help me read this scripture
[28:53] demarcos going to open up to the book of
[28:55] mark
[28:56] [Music]
[29:38] hoping that the lord also blesses you
[29:44] the word of the lord reads like this
[29:45] following brethren
[29:48] the word reads
[30:04] and when he was gone forth into the way
[30:06] there came one running annealed to him
[30:09] and asked him good master what shall i
[30:11] do that i may inherit eternal life
[30:20] and jesus said unto him why call us thou
[30:22] me good there is none good but one that
[30:25] is god.
[30:31] testimonials
[30:36] the commandments do not commit adultery
[30:38] do not kill do not steal
[30:41] do not bear false witness defraud not
[30:43] honor thy father and mother
[30:46] helen
[30:53] and he answered and said unto him master
[30:55] all these have i observed from my youth
[30:59] jesus
[31:13] then jesus beholding him loved him and
[31:16] said unto him one thing they'll lack is
[31:18] go thy way sell whatsoever thou hast and
[31:21] give to the poor and that shall have
[31:24] treasure in heaven and come take up the
[31:26] cross and follow me
[31:29] reflect
[31:35] and he was sad at that saying and he
[31:37] went away grieved for he had great
[31:39] possessions
[31:51] and jesus looked round about and saith
[31:54] unto his disciples
[31:55] how hardly shall they that have riches
[31:58] enter into the kingdom of god
[32:04] jesus
[32:16] and the disciples were astonished at his
[32:18] words but jesus answereth answereth
[32:21] again and saith unto him children how
[32:24] hard it is for them
[32:26] that trust enriches to enter into the
[32:28] kingdom of god
[32:31] [Music]
[32:38] it is easier for a camel to go through
[32:40] the eye of a needle than for a rich man
[32:42] to enter into the kingdom of god
[32:54] and they were astonished out of measure
[32:56] saying among themselves
[32:58] who then can be saved
[33:12] and jesus looking upon them saith with
[33:15] men it is impossible but not with god
[33:18] but with god all things are possible
[33:21] amen amen
[33:35] this is the thought which we'll be
[33:36] speaking on this morning
[33:42] we'd like to call it the encounter of
[33:44] everlasting life
[33:48] i'm taking this message
[33:54] he preached two messages called
[33:55] leadership
[33:56] in prescott arizona one of the priests
[33:58] in prescott arizona
[34:00] california the other one in covina
[34:02] california
[34:04] 1965.
[34:16] everlasting life and how to receive it
[34:33] this morning i'd like to bring something
[34:34] very simple
[34:36] which caught my attention
[34:41] and particularly help myself
[34:44] i'd like to share with you
[34:46] that
[34:52] we're going to call it the encounter of
[34:54] everlasting life
[34:59] brother branham speaks very
[35:17] must be able to take advantage of the
[35:18] riches of the word of god
[35:25] this brother brown speaks of this uh
[35:27] young rich ruler
[35:36] but when this young rich man approaches
[35:42] jesus he goes before the lord before
[35:44] jesus and kneels before him
[35:49] nowhere does it say that he's rich
[35:54] so we do not know that this man was rich
[36:12] [Music]
[36:25] that stood out
[36:28] special tremendous man
[36:31] one of the characteristics that he was a
[36:33] prince
[36:34] principal
[36:36] a man that was in charge
[36:38] of a certain ruler uh uh he was a
[36:40] certain ruler
[36:42] a tremendous man
[36:44] a man who had influence
[36:50] not only influence but had a lot of
[36:51] possessions
[37:05] he was an exemplary person
[37:09] not only with education
[37:14] but also had knowledge of the scripture
[37:18] a very obedient and educated person
[37:26] so he was a special person uh instructed
[37:28] the correct way
[37:31] i like how brother brandon mentions it
[37:48] uh
[38:16] there will be someone there to watch our
[38:17] last steps
[38:19] someone will guide us
[38:22] someone will be there with us
[38:24] maybe it won't be someone there
[38:26] physically
[38:28] there will be someone who sees our last
[38:30] steps and says
[38:57] he was admired from the people around
[38:59] him
[39:08] brother ben speaks on this picture would
[39:09] we believe it's the hoffman yes
[39:15] this is the one where he speaks of the
[39:16] rich young ruler
[39:21] we know that this young rich ruler
[39:24] [Music]
[39:27] besides him achieving so many things
[39:31] he knew he needed one thing
[39:35] that's when he came to the lord and
[39:36] asked him senor lord
[39:40] kneels before him
[39:44] what must i do
[39:48] what do i need to achieve
[39:53] but i like one thing no tengo
[40:36] said lord
[41:18] that stands out at
[41:47] and when jesus begins to speak to him
[41:52] so go sell whatsoever thou hast
[41:57] now after you've sold everything you
[41:58] have lost
[42:00] give to the poor
[42:27] he didn't have that that value
[42:34] he didn't have the the courage to be
[42:35] able to take that decision
[42:39] because he had achieved so many things
[42:56] prophet speaks on this message
[43:01] how this uh young rich ruler
[43:04] of transport
[43:07] immediately transports him to another
[43:08] scripture
[43:15] he's the same one that's the rich man
[43:17] with with lazarus
[43:21] in luke 16 19
[43:32] [Music]
[44:27] there he'd be at the gate at the
[44:28] entrance of the rich man's home
[44:34] he saw and desired
[44:37] to fill himself
[44:40] with the crumbs
[44:43] or the leftover food
[44:45] but
[44:46] for him to be able to quench his hunger
[44:48] without
[45:11] that the bible speaks in luke 12 16.
[45:15] about the the foolish uh ruler eston
[45:18] puerto rico this rich man
[45:23] what am i going to do with so much money
[45:24] that i've accumulated
[45:27] i know what i'm going to do
[45:37] and i'm going to build even uh bigger
[45:39] warehouses
[45:42] and i'm going to
[45:44] collect even more things
[45:47] when i accumulate all these things i
[45:48] wanna see where it is here now i will be
[45:50] able to say
[45:52] the scans alma seoul right
[45:55] enjoy life
[45:58] enjoy yourself
[46:01] so you can enjoy all the days of your
[46:03] life
[46:04] scripture reads
[46:06] jesus says
[46:12] today this evening this tonight will ask
[46:14] for your soul
[46:18] and whose will it be everything that
[46:19] you've accumulated
[46:24] he places those scriptures with the same
[46:25] character miramos
[46:40] [Music]
[47:23] scripture reads that he answers it
[47:26] says what is it that you want he said
[47:30] please tell lazarus
[47:34] the tip of his finger
[47:50] there's
[48:32] [Music]
[48:46] the greatest gift
[48:49] to reject everlasting life
[48:52] when the opportunity was given to him
[48:55] he rejected it
[49:26] this man the scripture tells us que lisa
[49:37] i want none of my own family members to
[49:39] be here where i'm at mandela send
[49:42] someone
[49:55] it's better if someone goes and
[49:57] resurrects them from the dead and
[49:58] they'll listen they say no say no i
[50:01] wanna see noah they won't even listen
[50:03] that way
[50:06] they are here they have the prophets
[50:10] eleven
[50:24] wasn't able to understand
[50:46] because the scripture says that this man
[50:48] trusted in his riches
[50:51] not trusting in the word
[51:20] a man instructed in the law
[51:22] jesus and when jesus finds him jesus
[51:29] jesus tells him the exact same thing
[51:30] that he told the rich young ruler
[52:30] a
[52:45] middle post
[52:46] was healed
[52:50] that's why it's necessary for the
[52:51] son of man to be born to be raised
[52:55] when he's raised
[52:57] they who believe on him
[53:26] nicodemus
[54:03] and it's repeated for us exactly the
[54:04] same but
[54:08] for us for us to believe to know that
[54:10] the word has not changed
[54:15] because that's how we uh obtain
[54:17] everlasting life juan cinco de cuatro la
[54:20] paris
[54:21] john 5 24 tells us
[54:44] unto you he that heareth my word and
[54:46] believeth on him that sent me has
[54:48] everlasting life and shall not come into
[54:50] condemnation but is passed from death
[54:52] unto life
[54:55] brother what must i do
[54:59] with your heart
[55:02] jesus christ
[55:04] except calvary
[55:31] and have everlasting
[55:32] life jesus speaking here jesus
[55:37] brother that's all i have to do
[55:40] yes brother we must believe
[55:42] why brother
[55:44] because it's this simple but
[55:56] give us an example the same scripture we
[55:58] just read
[56:00] prophet
[56:18] then you will have to become a part of
[56:20] his everlasting being
[56:22] is that right
[56:40] and if you become a part of this
[56:41] everlasting being that makes you a son
[56:43] or a daughter of him to him which
[56:45] exactly fulfill what the scripture says
[56:48] we're sons and daughters of god is that
[56:49] right
[56:53] no this is the essential part notice
[56:56] notice what the prophet says
[57:00] speaking of eternal life he says when
[57:01] did you get it
[57:03] when you shouted
[57:06] when you went to the altar
[57:08] when you spoke in tongues
[57:52] there's people who can speak in tongues
[57:53] amen
[57:55] that's right
[57:57] and yet not believe
[57:59] this
[58:00] prophet says
[58:03] we have worked them up to evidences
[58:06] and have made
[58:26] you can pin a man down because he's done
[58:28] this that he's a christian
[58:31] like the rich and rulers
[58:48] prophet makes a declaration
[58:52] he's a christian
[58:55] because he believes us
[58:57] you're a christian
[58:59] because you believe
[59:02] here's a key notice
[59:05] in his own life
[59:08] bears the fruit of the spirit
[59:11] no matter what he does
[59:13] in other words
[59:43] holy spirit
[59:56] no matter what he does ben si i see
[1:00:11] and everlasting life is
[1:00:42] perhaps 95 percent or maybe a hundred
[1:00:44] raised up
[1:00:45] christians they're christian
[1:00:50] here's the key brethren
[1:00:54] as long as you believe that establish
[1:00:56] all right
[1:01:00] but the minute that you begin to think
[1:01:02] that you're not is a moment
[1:01:06] that's the time you start sinking right
[1:01:08] there is
[1:01:37] salvation
[1:01:38] your salvation the same
[1:01:43] because everything of god is by faith
[1:01:45] [Applause]
[1:01:49] and nothing of god's can be proven by
[1:01:51] natural
[1:01:52] america
[1:01:55] our faith
[1:01:57] makes the difference
[1:02:00] with this i'll be closing
[1:02:03] notice what the prophet says
[1:02:31] with his wife
[1:02:52] i said if god would come to this room
[1:02:54] and would say i'm going to give you a
[1:02:56] choice to live another 50 years and
[1:02:58] you're going to go through poverty and
[1:03:00] sickness and troubles
[1:03:05] have to be rejected especially
[1:03:07] [Applause]
[1:03:08] and despised and have a terrible time
[1:03:14] you're going to have to beg every meal
[1:03:16] that you eat in the next 50 years
[1:03:20] at the end of those 50 years
[1:03:22] you'll have every eternal life
[1:03:29] but i'm going to give you the whole
[1:03:30] world and all the money
[1:03:34] and turn you back to 18 years old
[1:03:38] make you king over all the world for a
[1:03:39] million years
[1:03:42] but at the end of the million
[1:05:06] you'll
[1:05:48] and your life will manifest
[1:05:51] what you have in your heart
[1:05:55] so the prophet says in the message he
[1:05:57] must be born again
[1:05:59] and i'll be finishing with this
[1:06:00] la gracia what is
[1:06:12] [Applause]
[1:06:29] what grace is
[1:06:58] and
[1:07:43] [Applause]
[1:08:16] so the experience of the
[1:08:18] the experience uh of being born again
[1:08:21] tells us what we are
[1:08:30] why are you preaching to us this in the
[1:08:32] new year
[1:08:34] because it's time the reflection
[1:08:36] to uh reflect
[1:08:50] obey you know and don't believe
[1:08:53] that you don't have everlasting life
[1:08:56] remember
[1:08:57] let us pray father
[1:08:59] father we thank you puerto pala for your
[1:09:01] word
[1:09:05] how good you've been to us
[1:09:08] we give you the honor and glory this
[1:09:09] morning
[1:09:11] help us to serve you each day better are
[1:09:13] you
[1:09:14] help us
[1:09:17] every one of us
