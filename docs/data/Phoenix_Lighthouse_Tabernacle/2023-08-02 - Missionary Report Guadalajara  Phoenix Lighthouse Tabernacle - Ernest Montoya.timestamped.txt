[41:00] amen
[41:07] foreign
[41:12] [Music]
[41:36] [Music]
[42:24] yeah that doesn't mean that we don't
[42:25] lose a battle
[42:28] but the end the end battle
[42:30] the final world we have a God
[42:33] who is a warrior
[42:35] and he's never fought in any of them
[42:38] sorry he's never lost a war
[42:41] a battle war
[42:45] s
[42:47] us to get a bit of hurt
[42:50] to see how what reaction we have almost
[42:55] as you're standing
[42:57] Uno
[43:01] the scripture is Ephesians
[43:03] we'll be reading from three to five
[43:05] brothers
[43:11] Ephesians 1 3-5
[43:19] is
[43:26] the scripture reads blessed be the God
[43:28] and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[43:30] who had blessed us with the spiritual
[43:31] blessings in Heavenly places in Christ
[43:39] according as he has chosen before the
[43:42] foundation of the world and we should be
[43:44] holy and Without Blame before him in
[43:46] love
[43:57] until the adoption of children by Jesus
[44:00] Christ himself according to the good
[44:01] pleasure of his will by your heads
[44:05] or Jesus Christ Heavenly Father we give
[44:08] you thanks Lord
[44:10] be here once again at home
[44:13] for giving us health and life
[44:16] giving us everything that you have given
[44:18] us
[44:19] you have given us so much
[44:24] sometimes with our blurry vision that we
[44:26] have no pude
[44:30] we can't see the blessings that you do
[44:32] for all of us
[44:34] you do so much on the daily
[44:37] respiration even with a simple Act of
[44:39] being able to breathe is
[44:49] Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
[44:52] you may take your seeds
[44:56] once again I greet you in the name Lord
[44:58] Jesus Christ
[45:02] I'm going to speak a little bit I don't
[45:04] know if you have the pictures ready
[45:07] like the majority of you know
[45:11] we went to the convention in Guadalajara
[45:14] I went supporting my pastor yes
[45:20] it's not easy sometimes
[45:23] but when God calls you
[45:27] it's not because you yourself want to go
[45:30] there's something within you
[45:33] that has to respond yes
[45:36] and that is the reason why we go
[45:39] it was in my own choosing
[45:42] I believe it was choosing on behalf of
[45:44] the Lord
[45:45] it also does not make me better than
[45:48] anyone else
[45:49] but each one has a different colors
[45:54] daily here whether we go out or we don't
[45:56] go out
[45:58] with our life we preach on The Daily
[46:00] what we believe
[46:03] you may not stand behind this is
[46:07] your very own life it is
[46:19] that shows who you truly are this is
[46:23] the only Bible that some people may only
[46:25] read
[46:26] which is the life of each one of you
[46:31] so here was an auto term that they
[46:33] rented out it's a very large Auditorium
[46:37] it was foreign
[47:16] it went up to 90 degrees
[47:19] so for one of us that's nothing
[47:52] a person who I knew came about
[47:55] a brother from church
[47:59] he says let's test out this car so you
[48:02] know what it does
[48:06] he lit up a marijuana cigarettes
[48:10] and I said well you know there's no
[48:12] problem you know you go you know what
[48:13] you're doing
[48:14] he says you're not going to scare me
[48:16] with that
[48:20] so everybody has to have their own
[48:21] burden because the theme
[48:35] the scripture here specifically to the
[48:38] individuals
[48:42] can each overcome that is the question
[48:45] is
[48:49] put the windows down because it smelled
[48:51] very bad like many of you know
[48:54] it tells me that he began to smoke
[48:58] he says tell me about the car I don't
[49:00] care about all that
[49:02] um
[50:07] you're holy because he is
[50:11] so we let him come into our lives
[50:15] from the inside
[50:20] reflection there was a
[50:23] Reflections as Christians are not
[50:25] perfect
[50:26] they're just forgiven to accept
[50:30] so how much do you accept that
[50:32] forgiveness of God in your life
[50:36] here is the church the service was done
[50:39] here
[50:40] as you know it is a small church
[50:45] because brother said they didn't give
[50:47] him the auditorium from Friday
[50:50] so this church brings back a lot of
[50:52] memories
[51:00] But as time goes on I'll let you know
[51:02] what happens
[51:04] in the first convention my mother passed
[51:06] away
[51:07] and the church is
[51:10] so each time I go to this church
[51:14] that moves the feelings Within Me
[51:17] browse at the same time I've realized
[51:22] from the beginning with each one of us
[51:25] when you think that God is Not By Your
[51:28] Side
[51:30] God is letting you be to see what you
[51:32] will do
[51:34] brother God loves to test his children
[51:45] or a daughter who go to a game like a
[51:48] baseball game or a soccer game or a
[51:49] basketball game something of those sorts
[51:53] opened up the service
[51:55] I like how he preaches
[51:59] because I'm up here
[52:03] I consider that he is my friend
[52:06] and I like how God is
[52:18] automatically my mind went to the
[52:20] message of brother Branham
[52:22] why are people so tossed about he said
[52:28] he asked a question and he gives an
[52:30] answer
[52:34] from here to there to another place
[52:39] sorry maybe I don't understand that word
[52:41] a toss about maybe you know what it
[52:42] means
[52:46] someone who's talked about someone who
[52:48] fluctuates is somebody who moves from
[52:49] here to there
[52:51] is
[52:52] a person who is that way is because they
[52:54] have not been here
[52:56] when you're born again
[53:09] not just here by coincidence
[53:15] it's not an accident that you were born
[53:17] foreign
[54:17] yeah you can know that there's something
[54:18] Beyond
[54:20] a representation
[54:24] it's the same thing when there's a
[54:25] representation of God in your heart
[54:27] it doesn't matter where you want to rise
[54:33] you will never escape from God
[54:38] has a plan for each one
[54:42] brother I don't care how young or how
[54:44] small or how big you are yes
[54:48] you may see brother well I'm already an
[54:50] old person I think I've already done
[54:51] everything God wants me to do
[54:54] but the reason you're still here on
[54:56] Earth
[54:57] because God wants to continue using it
[55:04] say brother I'm tired of this life I
[55:06] would like to go with the Lord already
[55:12] because you still have to fulfill the
[55:14] purpose you have
[55:17] it's so tremendous like brother Benham
[55:18] says
[55:20] he says God can prepare a person
[55:24] all of their lives
[55:28] let's say that they're almost 50 years
[55:30] old like myself
[55:33] young people might say well brother it's
[55:35] very old
[55:39] Century
[55:41] he's already an old man
[55:46] a person just tell me you're already an
[55:48] old man
[55:50] I tell them yeah when I get to work and
[55:52] what's the first thing I do
[55:55] I leave the walker in my car
[55:58] and then I walk normal
[56:02] God has a purpose
[56:05] that's all I want to tell you it's that
[56:08] simple Brothers
[56:10] God could prepare you all your life
[56:13] only to use you for five minutes
[56:20] don't think that you're not valuable to
[56:22] God
[56:23] each soul that is here
[56:26] it's worth more than ten thousand words
[56:30] if you're valuable in the eyes of God
[56:33] maybe in the eyes of the world
[56:37] or your girlfriends
[56:46] you're valuable in front of the eyes of
[56:48] God may God bless you
[56:51] thank you
[56:58] because Tabernacle
[57:30] and the brothers there brother Mark
[57:31] Castillo and the evening lights
[57:33] Tabernacles
[57:39] veterans
[57:42] I have another 25 years here
[57:45] has been with us uh services
[58:46] the unchangeable god
[58:50] in an unexpected way
[58:56] he fulfills his word
[59:00] we think we have everything figured
[59:08] but he continues
[59:16] the reason why I say this because we
[59:18] don't think we all have to go through
[59:19] the same past
[59:20] we are born
[59:23] but some birds are more complicated than
[59:26] others he is and the natural that's how
[59:28] it is
[59:30] but we're born again that's that's what
[59:33] the importance
[59:33] some struggled more than others
[59:44] others that take a little bit longer
[59:48] services
[1:00:26] that building foreign
[1:01:25] 807 they're actually waiting for him to
[1:01:28] take
[1:01:28] and we all know
[1:01:31] that he loves to pray for the people
[1:01:34] is
[1:01:38] he
[1:01:44] was trying to lift up the faith of the
[1:01:46] people so they could be helpful it would
[1:01:48] be impossible
[1:01:51] to see everything that got there among
[1:01:54] the people
[1:01:55] but I believe people were blessed
[1:02:58] foreign with this I want to tell you
[1:03:01] Brothers
[1:03:04] your prayers are greatly appreciated
[1:03:09] we had a good time with the family
[1:03:14] I was happy because my father was there
[1:03:16] in Guadalajara this is
[1:03:20] for the convention
[1:03:23] we were a small group there's Nintendo
[1:03:26] uh
[1:03:27] from the lighthouse
[1:03:33] people appreciated
[1:03:47] but your prayers
[1:03:51] not only for him
[1:03:58] for here foreign
[1:04:27] foreign
[1:05:24] God bless you this morning
[1:05:36] [Music]
[1:05:42] Del farro
[1:05:45] parque
[1:05:48] today we are
[1:05:55] and as long as we're part of the team
[1:05:59] what
[1:06:01] is
[1:06:08] what we did
[1:06:18] success
[1:06:21] and with that success
[1:06:23] it's only because the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:30] it's never the man it's always the
[1:06:34] spirit dwells
[1:06:41] I introduce brother Javier
[1:06:44] as our co-pester
[1:06:47] let me say it again
[1:06:50] um
[1:06:51] I'm not sure how many of you were
[1:06:54] uh in the message
[1:06:57] as I say Old-Timers
[1:07:00] they're young timers
[1:07:03] and we had a co-pastor first time I ever
[1:07:07] heard the word cold past 76.
[1:07:14] the Bible
[1:07:16] and the message brother Brennan brought
[1:07:19] us
[1:07:26] [Music]
[1:07:29] a lot of fits with the word
[1:07:34] but I wanted to address it yeah
[1:07:44] huh
[1:07:51] but then I I have the last say so
[1:07:55] if we go back
[1:07:59] we find the word
[1:08:02] uh with Lucifer Lucifer uh you're all
[1:08:06] aware well we should be aware
[1:08:10] that Lucifer was coal equal okay
[1:08:19] brother Branham said he was quote equals
[1:08:29] but then they inserted the word
[1:08:32] that he was
[1:08:41] and this is what started the battle
[1:08:44] Plato
[1:08:46] and it's always
[1:08:49] when there's a persona
[1:08:52] that wants to be something that is
[1:08:58] why people want power is
[1:09:06] so let me put it this way
[1:09:10] I think we all want pounds the Bible say
[1:09:14] and acts 1 8 I believe
[1:09:18] away until
[1:09:21] that power comes into us
[1:09:25] but what happens we uh seem to use the
[1:09:29] human nature with power
[1:09:33] [Music]
[1:09:35] the convention was a success
[1:09:46] way back in the 80s
[1:09:51] what did I learned
[1:09:54] the pastor prayed for me
[1:09:56] he prayed for my vocal cords
[1:10:02] I recall his words
[1:10:07] what he wanted
[1:10:09] it was for me
[1:10:11] to speak Spanish
[1:10:15] that was a prayer
[1:10:17] do I speak Spanish well let me put it
[1:10:20] this way the only one that knows the
[1:10:24] Spanish is
[1:10:27] please stand up
[1:10:32] she's the only one that knows me Espanol
[1:10:38] and the reason she knows is her husband
[1:10:43] her first husband in the Lord
[1:10:48] was a friend
[1:10:51] and I didn't speak Spanish did I if I
[1:10:54] spoke Spanish I didn't speak Spanish
[1:10:56] espanol
[1:10:59] NADA uh
[1:11:04] that was my Spanish
[1:11:10] I didn't speak nothing
[1:11:12] I understood
[1:11:14] but something happened
[1:11:18] that Spanish was not the Spanish that
[1:11:20] was spoken in my home
[1:11:23] my mother went to the third grade
[1:11:29] she understood English
[1:11:31] but only knew a couple cuss words
[1:11:35] and when somebody came over these words
[1:11:38] came out
[1:11:39] I'm giving you uh just a little taste of
[1:11:43] what I went through
[1:11:47] Juarez
[1:11:53] first time I met him
[1:12:00] and I understood 100 Espanol
[1:12:06] [Music]
[1:12:15] the person's name is
[1:12:25] say it at my house we talked
[1:12:28] and there was something about him
[1:12:31] some attraction attraction
[1:12:34] that just made me
[1:12:37] moved from
[1:12:39] Texas
[1:12:42] to Phoenix a phoenix
[1:12:44] and if I ever hated a city more than uh
[1:12:52] more than I did
[1:12:55] El Paso
[1:12:57] Phoenix it's too hot
[1:13:04] but that's a long time ago
[1:13:11] in Phoenix what I wanted you to do is
[1:13:14] stand up for a minute
[1:13:16] just share with you
[1:13:21] I know I had to stand up but I'm I have
[1:13:23] about an hour left
[1:13:26] and I need to take an hour
[1:13:29] now bless your brother or bless your
[1:13:31] sister
[1:13:38] and I think these are the best words
[1:13:40] that I know God bless you
[1:13:43] bless each other
[1:13:50] and I was in uh
[1:13:53] in Mexico something kept on bothering me
[1:13:58] how many of you sinned before don't be
[1:14:01] embarrassed
[1:14:04] if you don't put your hands
[1:14:07] the Bible is
[1:14:14] I've said it more than once
[1:14:17] that the Bible says
[1:14:23] all men are what
[1:14:27] words
[1:14:30] how many of us have sinned
[1:14:35] Nuevo
[1:14:45] but we've all fallen short Perot and I
[1:14:50] sinned and I fell
[1:14:52] shorts
[1:14:55] I'm happy I didn't say everything
[1:14:58] but if I ever met a person that was
[1:15:04] he followed me and missing you
[1:15:06] made it simple for me
[1:15:09] go to that person go to that person go
[1:15:13] to this person you gotta pray for them
[1:15:19] and the people we prayed foreign
[1:15:39] bajo
[1:15:43] every day
[1:15:45] so my sin was
[1:15:47] I preached I was all wet
[1:15:55] well
[1:15:56] went and had some soup with somebody I
[1:15:59] won't never mention names
[1:16:07] I had to come back to earth
[1:16:11] and uh I forgot I put on a shirt
[1:16:16] I still don't know the name of the soup
[1:16:18] I say Italian
[1:16:20] and the people look at me
[1:16:24] is this
[1:16:31] I just love to eat it
[1:16:38] it came so hard
[1:16:41] across the street
[1:16:45] I was drenched off my shirt
[1:16:51] I passed out this way
[1:16:55] my throat
[1:16:58] I was going to call Bill uh
[1:17:07] I don't have a voice
[1:17:11] my sin was
[1:17:14] I know that I'm supposed to take off
[1:17:17] I know I'm supposed to be warm out of
[1:17:21] the air conditioner
[1:17:26] so it was not only was the room cold
[1:17:29] but my throat was just close
[1:17:36] it was only God that saved me foreign
[1:18:03] so I've been troubled a lot
[1:18:07] um
[1:18:09] and there was a conflict between Ernie
[1:18:11] Montoya
[1:18:13] Spirit on Saturday night
[1:18:15] and look this way I'd see your spirit
[1:18:20] I saw over here
[1:18:23] it was like people were pulling away
[1:18:27] I don't want to serve God anymore
[1:18:33] I started telling myself have we lost
[1:18:36] our confidence
[1:18:40] have we still stooped so low
[1:18:45] that every time I see my wife
[1:18:57] this is what I was fighting the thoughts
[1:18:59] that were coming
[1:19:05] do they attack you yeah
[1:19:10] they attack all of us
[1:19:16] so then my thought was
[1:19:18] conflict between the sons of God
[1:19:24] I want you to say there is a conflict
[1:19:28] between between the sons of God the sons
[1:19:32] of God and Satan insane how many sons of
[1:19:35] God are here
[1:19:36] we're sons of God
[1:19:40] in other words
[1:19:45] and that struggle yes it's not against
[1:19:48] your brothers
[1:19:49] but it's against us
[1:19:54] spirit that hangs around lingers
[1:20:00] have you ever gone somewhere and all of
[1:20:04] a sudden you start acting differently
[1:20:08] because someone there before you and
[1:20:12] left an anointing
[1:20:21] but he said this
[1:20:24] sister hermana you stayed at a hotel
[1:20:29] the southern Brothers stayed at the same
[1:20:32] hotel room
[1:20:36] not at the same time
[1:20:38] but they both stayed at the same Hotel
[1:20:43] the same room
[1:20:45] a spirit was left there is
[1:20:53] I'm not going to tell you what the
[1:20:54] anointing was
[1:20:56] but there was anointing
[1:20:58] Brennan told the sisters
[1:21:05] father that was anointed with that
[1:21:08] Spirit
[1:21:11] lingers until it finds
[1:21:15] a horse
[1:21:21] say it again
[1:21:25] brother Brennan gave an advice
[1:21:34] yes see he looks at another person
[1:21:40] not gonna go into it
[1:21:43] many of you know the story
[1:21:46] but many times what happens
[1:21:49] we don't know what's behind the
[1:21:51] anointing
[1:21:53] one wanted this
[1:21:55] said okay the other one is the same
[1:21:58] things
[1:22:10] do the spirits go with Jesus Jesus
[1:22:15] or do the spirit stay here
[1:22:19] and when they stay here in order to have
[1:22:22] life a spirit needs a horse
[1:22:28] then it comes to you
[1:22:31] because of your your Fallen Spirit
[1:22:35] foreign
[1:22:40] okay
[1:22:50] that person left yeah
[1:22:57] if he would have taken a talk
[1:23:05] would govern him
[1:23:08] what we need to do we need to put it
[1:23:16] ISO
[1:23:26] because it will take you by surprise
[1:23:32] and I don't say it because somebody is
[1:23:35] doing this
[1:23:38] I was in Mexico
[1:23:45] some people had an anointing where they
[1:23:47] wanted power
[1:23:48] others wanted an anointing that they
[1:23:52] were something
[1:23:54] why do you want to be something okay
[1:23:57] God made us a nobody so that we could be
[1:24:01] somebody in his economy
[1:24:05] I don't care about the economy of the
[1:24:09] United States
[1:24:10] however I used it
[1:24:14] when I was in Guadalajara of what's
[1:24:17] Happening Here in America Trump
[1:24:22] a chosen vessel he claims
[1:24:27] the person that's going to make us great
[1:24:29] again
[1:24:33] well he has a surprise
[1:24:37] because like I said there's a conflict
[1:24:40] between and sons of God
[1:24:44] there's a conflict between the word of
[1:24:48] God
[1:24:51] I'm conflict between
[1:24:54] God
[1:24:56] it's a conflict
[1:24:59] good and evil there's a conflict are you
[1:25:02] conflicted
[1:25:16] because it grabs us
[1:25:21] and we're doing things we shouldn't be
[1:25:22] doing yes
[1:25:51] when the sons of God
[1:25:54] shouted for Joyce
[1:26:03] someone tell me
[1:26:06] where we were at
[1:26:08] shouting praise God
[1:26:13] we weren't troubled back then
[1:26:17] we didn't lose our confidence
[1:26:22] but today
[1:26:24] many of us are so worried what's going
[1:26:27] to happen tomorrow
[1:26:29] I can't do this I can't pay for that
[1:26:35] what about my kids brother Brennan said
[1:26:39] this is
[1:26:40] a rose
[1:26:44] what five six minutes
[1:26:50] because of this thing called
[1:26:53] trap
[1:26:55] there's a trap in every corner
[1:27:01] brother Brenham said it was preached in
[1:27:03] 1956.
[1:27:06] and if you notice
[1:27:08] I don't have a slight presentation
[1:27:15] and if you notice
[1:27:18] it's when you're discouraged
[1:27:23] the devil can really pour it on you
[1:27:28] when you lose your confidence
[1:27:42] that we're not worthy
[1:27:45] when we want to just throw in the towel
[1:27:53] he continues and he says
[1:27:57] does that happen to anybody here
[1:28:02] he says this he says if you come to
[1:28:05] church
[1:28:06] well I don't know
[1:28:08] I don't know whether
[1:28:11] I'll ever get any better or not
[1:28:15] brother
[1:28:17] raise your hand
[1:28:20] thank you gracias how's your wife
[1:28:28] any words spoken there
[1:28:30] no do we know what that means
[1:28:33] everything is all well
[1:28:36] all is well
[1:28:40] so brother Branham says
[1:28:44] better or not
[1:28:46] I've been prayed for twice
[1:28:51] how many of you have been prayed for and
[1:28:53] you're still not healed
[1:29:02] you might as well go home
[1:29:07] that's all but when you prayed excuse me
[1:29:12] but when you can cast aside
[1:29:16] I don't want you to be frowning
[1:29:22] how many of you from
[1:29:26] there he goes again
[1:29:28] I wish you'd just shed his mouth
[1:29:33] how many frowns are there
[1:29:36] I mean look at the time
[1:29:42] I gotta drive all the way down to um
[1:29:49] I mean I saw a lot of them Saturday
[1:29:52] night
[1:29:54] did the France leave finished they were
[1:29:58] gone

[1:30:53] like instrumental music instrumental it
[1:30:57] relaxes me relax when I get back on
[1:30:59] course
[1:31:02] there's a list of books brother Branham
[1:31:05] read
[1:31:08] many of them Westerns
[1:31:11] and the reason I say it is because
[1:31:15] that all brother Brenham did was read
[1:31:17] his Bible
[1:31:19] it was a different side over here
[1:31:23] Billy brother Billy Paul anybody Paul uh
