amen Brothers if you can please turn with me I'm going to be reading a scripture here uh this uh is this one is not going to be in the presentation um but it's going to be on Revelations 3 21. Once you have it you please indicate it with an amen and the scripture says like this to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I am set down with my father in his throne go ahead he that he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says unto his churches now the next scripture that I'll be touching on it is going to be on the presentation and this is on uh Revolution I'm sorry uh it's going to be on rev Revelations 12. 10 through 11. and the scripture says like this and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren has cast down which accused them before our God day and night and don't just yeah and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony yes and they loved not their lives unto death amen amen you may take your seats Brothers what I would like to talk about today Brothers as you can see on the presentation the overall I guess theme of uh Sunday nights is how can I overcome and after listening uh to uh messages of apostle yes um I felt inspired to put a subtitle raising my white flag to him Brothers I I believe um we can all uh relate throughout time uh times have been getting a little bit more difficult and it has been said he said that in this time it would be and as we as I sat with a couple of Youth here and there is I see that that the devil is really hitting hard but something that our Apostle spoke something that really really got to me Impacto it says that the the problem here it's not it's not out there the problem is within here all right so what I what I would talk would like to talk a little bit yeah when I when I was younger brothers I was in high school and something that I was really struggling with um I I was I believe it was uh my senior year um I was struggling on what to do um what was going to be of my life and I think most of most of the uh young adults today um their thought really goes to Pennsylvania what's my purpose why does God have been planned for my life sometimes what's what happens is that the Unseen it kills you it's okay and and some something that happens that when there's uh unknown we tend to make decisions that aren't right correct us and because because we don't have a specific um in our minds we don't have a specific Pathway to go to okay something planned for us and that happened to me yes um something that that uh I was going through during that time most likely at the beginning of the year I don't know if you guys know but my mother was struggling with uh problems from the heart problem and at that time um like my mom would say I'd have one foot here and one foot there and my mother would say you have to make a decision you can serve two Gods at the same time but it's something that happens I decided to go out with my friends Amigos I'll be a little sincere with you um we went out and uh with the car and we were on people's yards uh it was it was bad yeah um and when I got home uh I found out that my mom was awake and and she was worried yesterday I believe at that time my uh uh no no she wasn't yet but um at that time when I got there my mom was very very worried to the point um that she was having uh problems with with breathing and and yes because of her problem that she was having and uh I recall years back um my grandma spoke to me one time and she told me and um possibly maybe maybe not it wasn't the right thing to say at the moment but what she told me she says if you don't stop doing what you're doing because you're gonna kill your mother from a heart attack and in my mind I I didn't think that was possible but when I saw the scene that day yeah I I felt like I stepped back a little bit and I looked at where I was at at that momento and I thought to myself is that really what I want do I want to cause this pain the person who gave their life gave everything for me and this is my repayment that was my mentality at that momento and I in within within myself he then through the me I said something has to change but something has to change during that year a lot of things happened um as I I've said uh in previous times before I had gone to a youth campaign God dealt with me and it is it is so now I think about it it's so great how God works things in your life to bring you to that point you can probably thought out by yourself but the way he did it was just perfect yeah and when that happened in my life and I I I I got that that uh personal relationship with the Lord that was a change in my life and I remember that that after I came back from the campamento the first thing I did is I I uh on that Sunday I said Domingo I ran to Brother Carlos Carlos and I say I told him I want to receive the Holy Spirit I want my life to change I don't want to keep living the same way I've been you know that's the decision I made and our Apostle tells us that that has to happen in our lives as well but something that he says you know our Prophet says many of us would probably says uh well that happened to me in 2013 and you know I'm okay now okay no no Paul says Apollo says we have the daily constantly die I would like to read here and I believe it's on the presentation here presentation it's on Matthew 16. 21-24 the 24 is what I'm I want to focus on okay but I added a little more just so we can have a little bit of context what happens and it says like this from that time Jesus began telling his followers he must go to Jerusalem he explained to he explained that the older Jewish leaders the leading priest and the teachers of the law would make him suffer many things and he told his followers that he must be killed then on the third day he would be raised from Death is 21 says Peter took Jesus away from the other followers to talk to him alone he began to criticize him he said God save you God save you from these sufferings Lord that that will never happen to you apart number 23 says then Jesus said to Peter gonna get away from me Satan you are not helping me you don't care about the same thing God does you care only about the things that people think are important and 24 says like this then Jesus said to his followers if any of you want to be my follower you must stop thinking about yourself and what you want you must be willing to carry the cross that is given to you for following me questions and number 25 says like this you who will try to save the life you have will lose it but you who will give up your life for me Will Truly find truly will true life will find True Life so right here uh Jesus is telling them now when to me the first time I heard the the scripture a while back he's like yo he really called called him satanas but no what he was really really saying well okay Satan was using him saying the things that he was saying and many times what happens is that within ourselves our brothers and sisters maybe we say something and you're like like well and she's Christian this is Christian Cristiano but our personal profit and the scripture tells us and shows us that it's not your brother it's a spirit in your brothers but how are we supposed to know that right how are we supposed to know that it's not our brother but it's the spirit and our brothers of course the scripture says but it must be a revelation to YouTube and who gives that Revelation but the spirit of God that's why it is very important that we can obtainer the holy spirit because that is what's going to help us identify certain things see things that we probably could not but that is a process something that I I kind of compared to and I'm sorry if some of you are hungry but something I compare it to it's like cooking a pizza Una Pizza I mean yeah you can buy it on on the store and you put it in the oven and you put it for a minute and then it's done but if you're gonna make a pizza there's instructions my instructions there's steps that you must take so that product can come out as it should so if you think that from one night to the other we're perfect perfectos it's a process so when when we look at ourselves I don't want to say give yourself some slack okay this is it takes time but at that time that take that it takes we must use it in our on our knees asking God Lord give me more of you change my life but something that we've learned that in order for us to get to where we need to go we're gonna have to go through trials that's why it says foreign but when you when you look at yourself and uh and you see that you're not you're not where you should be people around you maybe just just uh right now just just turn around and look at the brothers around you right we're all we're all gonna make mistakes let's give Grace let's give Grace but what I mean is that don't be so hard on us but as well don't be as hard to yourself in in John 11 25 it says this is Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead ye shall live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe is thou this is something that our people uh says Allah bastante uh he says that a lot of us are scared to Die the name was yeah that's true yes but that why I believe is that it's because when it comes to change I want to insert this here when it comes to change as a kid and your body starts growing then your skin starts stretching this is I don't know if you've encountered it maybe just me but it hurts and and it will hurt because the trials are the ones that are going to make us grow but in order for us to take this trials and be able to grow we have to take it you have to apply it foreign but it has to happen there's no other way I I would like I was um I wanted to insert this uh our Apostle said it at the message uh uh I must say in Spanish world champion and there's certain things that I took that that I think is very beneficial question beneficial like I said in the beginning the problem is not out there is in order for for for us to be closer to him in order for us to overcome the trials we go through something has to change in our lives and I I want to say this our Apostle says this is so when you conquer yourself you come as a lamb to the slaughtero here I am Lauren let thy will be done like I said you know you say it so easily he said he said but it's so hard I don't know about you but it's hard you said there's this I I when I when I hear this and uh I think about it I I as hearing the messages of our apostles all I can think to myself just like like what it said there say Aki Laura senor you're willing me like I said our Apostle says that you must you must surrender yourself and the only thing I can think to myself uh I all I can picture myself doing I I I I I pictured myself and and I said I said like this and I said Lord senor I'm coming to you surrendering my life do what you will cut what you need to cut but I want to be like you and our Apostle says that in order for us to overcome is to be like him to have him in us because he overcome um so I will overcome so in order for us to take that step we must surrender Our Lives say Lord this is toy [Music] do what you will in my life it's gonna hurt but I know that at the end of this process is Motu something that I I would like to say hello and and in this uh I found it in the uh uh in the message and it I believe it's on the presentation presentation uh this is the uh the part where it says uh message former and latter rain this is foreign let's go over to Revelations apocalypsies Jesus said himself Jesus he that overcomethier I will give him the Morning Star the Bible said that what is it is an overcomer when that overcome the world Al Mundo overcome overcome pride is I will make them the Morning Star La Estrella de la Manana what does it do yes sir it'll shine him up and set him up there that I can bye my over by my oncoming power will reflect my own presence in the Darkness he that overcomesire will I give the Morning Star what's the Morning Star set there foreign of the coming it's the brightest thing in heaven is existing and having ought to be today and is today yes the minister or the Christian or the Spirit-filled man so filled with the holy spirit so he's forsaken the world and
