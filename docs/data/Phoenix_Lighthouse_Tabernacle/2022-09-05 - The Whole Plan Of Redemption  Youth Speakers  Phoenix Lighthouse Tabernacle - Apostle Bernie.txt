[Music] but christ being come and high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building but estonia neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered into once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us for if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of in heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctify to the purifying of the flesh scientifically how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience conscience from dead works to serve the living god cuanto mas la sangre de cristo el cual mediantel espiritu all right um so like we've been going over the plan of redemption so we want to go into that what is the plan of redemption or to be redeemed so we all know the base what it means to be redeemed we talk about it every sunday that god died on the cross for us so that we may be redeemed and so i want to talk about that he the way that he died was one of the worst ways a person can die that was the man that was supposed to save the entire earth so the real main definition of redemption using it in the real world so that's what jesus christ did when he died on the cross for us so you have to think about that for a second that he died to clear a death for every single person that walked on earth and that and that ever will walk on earth that's a lot of sin to get rid of it's also it [Music] that's how perfect jesus christ was it is christopher and i know for a fact as we all do that jesus that jesus christ did not die for nothing jesus no he died for our sins to make us redeemed by his blood so that we would be spotless in the eyes of god now our so i'd like to go into a quote our brother branham says god's plan of redemption through the offering of the blood of the lord jesus christ once and for all to cleanse the guilty unworthy sinner alpecador in indigno and to bring him into reconciliation with god and to restore him back to the garden of eden with his wife and loved ones never to die no more but never to be sick never to have heartache for a lot of the brothers here um that work because i know a lot of the brothers here do work physical jobs there's not many of us that sit behind a desk and i know there's nothing wrong with that you know but i know that it's just i know that it's just hard to be outside especially when it's in the sun and things like that um i know that especially when days like that happen it's it's uh it's always relaxing to be able to go home and relax because um like we all know the human body is flawed so i think that just being able to go out and enjoy life to live the way that we were meant to live is one of the greatest rewards that we could ever have so um so it's much harder to to to close to that's like that's how you claim it you can't just pretend to be someone you're not you can't be a bad person but in reality that's who we all are because we're sinners um because to to go to heaven and an in in por simplical de maciado we just have to be good god-fearing people but being a good person isn't just something that happens on its own and there's not a lot of that in this world anymore especially um with the way that sin is right now sin isn't something that's uh that's thrown out something that's seen as wrong you're just you're a little different because you won't do things that other people will do you're kind of set apart from them no and it and it's hard because it's not suffering on the outside it's suffering mentally knowing that you're not like the people around you that you don't fit in be i'mma be punished for this later god's gonna get me for this because when you when you're sinning what are you what are you doing usually out in public with your friends uh sinning isn't that horrible thing that we make it out to be sin is a beautiful thing it's fun and it's enjoyable yes um we sin because it makes us feel good but what's that temporary fake happiness to being with god eternal in glory so uh it's especially hard for some of us especially especially those that are in school because you're just a little bit different than anyone and uh and don't get it wrong it's not like we're not it's not like some disney movie disney right they don't grab you and like throw you against throw you against the locker like so what a loser nobody does that nadia says and uh but you're just you're just weird for not doing certain things but uh you need to realize that out there there's always someone to hang out with but and it's not some uh like a consolation prize you can hang out with people that are genuinely fun and so it's nice to be around them so uh before i go into this i just want to tell everyone it's what i did isn't fun and i don't want to be a bad influence to anybody so i want to tell you guys a little story so this was during quarantine so obviously it was a little hard being locked up in the house all the time and uh so me and my friends have a group chat together like a lot of people do you have and my mom knows i used to go out almost every single day to go out skating with them and uh so uh one day one of my friends was miss amigos uh he had a little laser antenna and it was a really really like strong laser you know uh like it was it was like in the movies where it was those lasers from the gun that you could see perfectly so a bunch of sophomores having that right there is a first red flag so we were just hanging around the field with that thing and my friend he's pretty dumb so he's like i'm shining at that car right there he's this is the opponent and i wasn't i wasn't going to be like the the the big i wasn't going to be the big uh like the whoop you know so we kept doing it to a bunch of cars just and when you think about it it's only funny because you're with people no matter so um so that's not the whole story so so there's a roundabout like right here and then there was a field in between it yeah and then it's halted like it's breaks our school that i used to go to as a middle school kid was right next to there so i was like i used to go there's no problem with me and my friends hopping we all used to go there so then we just started waiting there and the guy left obviously because he couldn't really get to us so we were just chilling at the field doing some more dumb stuff just just making dumb jokes and uh we would get scared and laugh because cars would come into the roundabout kind of looks like a tahoe tahoe the the cars that police drive was like that's not a cop though we were just shining a laser at a car and uh so uh so then we we were just sitting there just looking at the car and then so since it was night time and and so at that point me and my friends saw that in this field and we were just there like deer in headlights so so we had to run away as fast as we could so um so uh being generous here i must say i'm like 5 10. and i'm not the lightest person in the world so i can tell you that the way i jot i jumped a six foot fence ps in less than like two seconds and uh so then someone yelled out i was so mad so so we all split up and everything was different and then we all met up at my house so um obviously right that's not what i mean when i say have fun with people you know like at the very most like ding dong ditch a house but don't don't get the police on you guys because uh my parents were so mad when they found out pasta but then at the same time i've gone out with my friends to the mall or the movies and it's it's just as fun as being with anyone else yes you hang out with good people what do you think you're going to get out of it good habits so when you do that you can you you can learn to become a better person by hanging out with better people you can always add that extra sentence to your prayer [Music] you can make god your friend right you could thank him for that yellow light that you barely made maria and my mom's going to get mad but i make that prayer often so talk to him and make him your go-to and most of all he must what i'm trying to make out of all this is make the most out of the redemption god gave you escape right god didn't die for us so that we could walk around like robots spewing out bible scriptures and trying to convert everything that we touch right we honor his death by worshiping him by we worship him not just at church but by living good lives right and it's so easy you know yes we fussy like it's not it's not that hard to to to be a to live that good life and i know a lot of kids my age like we grew up listening to those songs and that's all you have to do and um so i think that telling the truth is a big thing but that is right because especially with the phone and everything especially it's so easy to lie it's so easy to spread alive and i want to talk about a story um that uh that happened to my dad one time so one time he went to the bank and he went to cash in a check and i think i don't know if it was a small job because it was like a check of a couple hundred dollars and so uh so i don't even know how this happens but the bank gave him extra money right i wish that would happen to me right but my so so my dad was obviously when you get a nice amount of money you like to count and it makes you feel kind of nice so my dad was counting and saw they had a couple extra a couple extra hundreds and he returned it right my dad's a really honest guy and when you don't think about the external external you think about the internal internal doing this did benefit my dad yeah because he left that tiny situation with and i think that the integrity of a person is one of the most important things that you can have in your life right so you honor god who said and don't defile your temple you know um um that god gave you because it's the only one we get it died on the cross for us no god loves us and he shows it to us every day you don't notice it because you don't think about it right ask yourself what's stopping you from being that car accident in the news what's stopping your house from being that smoke you see in the distance okay right always thank god and be humble because god coming down was the most humble thing he could ever do because he didn't just humble himself he stooped down to our level and so our prophet said this uh there's the picture of true redemption how he came down worthy robbed himself and took upon him not the nature of angels not the nature of god but the nature of man he became a man for us and we'll always remember what he did for us to i'm asking myself this too but ask yourself do i act in a way that shows i truly appreciate being redeemed that's all god bless you and uh thank you for letting me speak to you [Applause] god bless you all i greet you all in the name of the lord jesus christ um i'd like to uh speak on uh on the same same topic today uh a great plan of redemption um i'm very first and foremost i'd like to thank my pastor for this opportunity he gave me premier leagues um i'm usually again as i've said i'm usually hiding behind the drum set but uh so i think it's it's good that i get more face time you know that way i uh shake the levers a little more question but uh nonetheless i'm very grateful to be here this morning very fortunate very lucky very blessed um you don't have to turn your scriptures with me but i just like to read a little scripture here i have one it will be found in job it's in hope chapter 19 it's a for i know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth and though after my skin warms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall i see god is so first and foremost i just wanted to speak a little bit on on redemption itself and and and what it means but i mean i'm sure everybody here knows what it means by now from a simple google search uh i came up with two different definitions for redemption so the first one i found it gave me a pretty straightforward one i think to what we're talking about so i have here the action of saving or being saved from sin error or evil and the second one being the action of regaining or gaining possession of something in exchange for payment or clearing of a debt recuperator or soda he was up there because we we at that point had lost their salvation we were doomed we were destined to go to a place where we would we would suffer and in doing so he he he made sure that that we we we had a future and while he was up there he saw all of us here he saw you sitting in that same spot you are now yo yo you saw me speaking here today and he thought that was worth dying for yeah so el el crio queso vallo murir so redemption itself is brother branham says it's one of the oldest things in the bible being that it's in the oldest book in the bible um he says uh it even predates the the plan of redemption because the his this whole entire thing is just one big big play that we're all we all have our own little roles we're all filling uh it could be the simplest of things it could be the person that holds the door at the end of the service could be the person that's at the door at the beginning of the service but we all have a small or large role to play so sometimes i i think i think to myself uh you know why why why do we why do we why do we why do we put ourselves in the situations where sometimes we shouldn't be at all but i found that it was just it was it was the human and it's we we are after all a flawed species yet perfect in the eyes of god you know christ brother branham says christ was predestined predestinated he says and he was the lamb of god way before the world was made way before the world was made god already had this plan of redemption we all we i'm sure we all believe that god puts puts things together for for those that that truly love him although sometimes we may fall and stumble yeah he says and it's most you know nine times nine out of ten times it's it's our own fault we we just have to position our place in christ find our position in christ and and all of that will fade away like a shadow position foreign so so why why did why do we why do you think god puts puts us in the trials he puts it sometimes because i know that sometimes i every day i'm struggling with something it's it's constant nonsense i it gets the point where i think there's there might be something wrong with me i don't know it's it's i'm very i'm a very clumsy person so you're not persona so i i don't know i find the most simplest and dumbest ways to hurt myself so i i could be from from where i park my car outside of my job site from the little walk trip to there to the front door i probably tripped maybe twice and i so so i just i wonder why why why do sometimes and a christian walk why do we fall so constantly why does god let some things happen to us on purpose permitted well brother branham tells of a story i'm sure we've all heard it before of the good shepherd he says a missionary from palestine palestine told him that he once saw a shepherd walking down the road with a lamb in his arms he said the lamb had a splint on its on one of its legs and so the missionary asks the man why why is why does he have a splint on his leg and the the good shepherd simply explained that out of his whole herd this certain lamp was the one that would simply not seem to follow him he would you know go off and do his own thing and act like he was his own shepherd and so the the good shepherd being a good shepherd he grabbed the lamb and broke its leg and and so i mean to someone on the outside that doesn't really understand the story it could seem like he just broke the leg to be mean and then you know when he once he he gives it a little bit of special treatment and and and loves it a little more when that when that sheep when that lamb is all healed up it's going to it's going to follow the shepherd without a second thought and so i think that our pain sometimes makes us a lot stronger it builds up an armor around us an armor of faith armadura something that every time we fall and and hurt ourselves it's easier for us to get back up to trust him even more so that the next time we fall it's just like a dust off and we keep walking no matter what because that's what that's what this whole life is it's a big long road and at the end we can just make out the destination but every time we fall the road gets a little bit longer but we just have to get back up and keep going um brother branham says he says that the devil is kind of like a pawn broker he uh evil evil that man puts us puts us in there and and just won't let us out you know we didn't let us out until christ paid that great debt. so christ redeemed us and bought us out of that pawn shop the government had said that by sunrise all the slaves would be free so all of the slaves the the younger ones the ones they would either climb the highest tree they could find the top the highest hill just so that they could get a glimpse of that rising sun and as soon as they got a peek of it as soon as one of those sun rays hit their face they ran to their people and and just screamed i'm free i'm free korean consequential but for now we just got to keep keep uh keep fighting keep fighting the good fight because otherwise where else is there to go um many times which asbestos i feel like well i speak personally but many times i can feel like we just say like i i just i i don't like i don't do enough come on like i'm i like i can't do enough to please god okay but it just [Music] we'll make it there before we know it all right god is good brothers am i right this is a man correcto so just remember brothers [Applause] each and every one of us you know and i appreciate you all for being here i appreciate my brothers in the order brother joe here as we said it's uh it can be taken as a victory that you're here today and it might not seem so horrible but for for some [Music] we've been given the the subject of the plan of redemption and i appreciate my brothers for their efforts you know it's a a day of victory it's a day it's known as a day that we that the enemy has been defeated [Music] and that's what i want to focus on in god's plan of redemption it's for us to accept him is different brethren and it's preached in sierra vista arizona arizona not too far from here south of tucson in a small house he talks about two things he talks about a victory day that he entitles and then he talks about d-day and in describing these two indescribed he talks about the world wars specifically in world war ii it's known as the day they went into battle and anguish and he breaks down these two and it's impossible to cover everything it's impossible it's impossible to do it just as the way that brother branham brought it yes i highly recommend that you take the time and listen to it yes and the way that brother branham is just speaking to a few people [Music] and if you didn't know that it's as if you were speaking to thousands it took the same sincerity towards these people the same love to these people we have to have each one we have to have one and brother branham in this message he has a lot of examples that he uses and he takes a lot of examples from the old testament on the day where he was taking the people of israel out okay you know the people that had been enslaved had been enslaved they had been in slavery he was taking these people out towards the promised land moses had been sent as the deliverer you just saw 10 miracles and and then you're doubting yes you just saw all this happen it says just stay where you are you must say it's just trust in god and i want to read into something that brother branham says so you can hear how he says in the same message says what a courage that ought to be for the sick person what a courage that ought to be for the backslider okay turn yourself around and start back stay in the line of duty it's god's business to open up the red seas it's god's business you just speak and move forward that's all you have to do is is who obeyed the voice of their prophet and when they spoke and went forward and moses said haven't you seen 10 miracles already and smart ladder and they walked across on dry land described it as a v day for them what they had to go through and then because everyone was so worried about everything else maybe that's how it is today it comes to people like that but it's our part to do our role with all the things that come at me but if i just know but it's our part to just focus on our role foreign i had the opportunity to go to a few different job locations i had to go visit a few things and so i met i met with a member of the arizona department of transportation he was speaking with other people and i was just in the back he says oh i can't come tomorrow which is wednesday because he goes he so this man would go to bible studies and so that that caught my attention but we didn't say anything more on it and then later on the seat switched up and i was able to sit next to him and so uh we were just talking there talking about um our backgrounds where we're from where we live i'm like oh okay that's a that's nice and then he told me have you do you know about this have you accepted the lord as your savior come to salvador and i but he seemed a little surprised i had never met him maybe it's just something he doesn't run into but him asking me it caught my attention attention that just the simplest question just to try to see if he could help me or maybe lean me towards the right way just that small role that maybe god had put has put in his plate you know it's one that we can have in the tiniest roles to be a lighthouse as we are here today and to finish off let me have something that brother branham here has he says now remember god has counted you worthy when you have a test know that it is that you need to have a d day to have a day of victory and that's the message that brother tries to bring yes have i accepted the lord jesus christ is my savior salvador that simple question that was asked god [Applause] is i want you to stand up for a minute you know everybody's celebrating celebrando uh what we call tomorrow as labor day the labor day we're celebrating our victory the so-called labor day labor day take your seats we gotta honor then recognize the labor in america in america we know it as as labor day where we uh just stay home relax but we failed to understand somebody accomplished iso all his accomplishments you [Applause] [Applause] rest your mind i start listening to these three young men i'm extremely proud of them i didn't tell them what to preach but what i wrote down in my notes on each person it all boils down to one thing are we worthy of the gospel of jesus christ i need to present to you jesus christ [Applause] [Applause] if you talk about william branham that's fine but you're wrong you have no business trying to share this gospel where they don't even at least know the gospels with a big revelation killing people you're killing individuals we understand god sent malachi 4-5 to help us not to destroy the very cross no destroy la cruz that we worship ramos why am i saying all this stuff saying that two of you listen you are trying to bring people to christ and they don't know nothing about him it's time that we go back it's time that we start listening to not only the message for victory a victory it's time yes we wake up i don't have time to play church this is real time is ending that i come up and i pray years and years ago and he only had me listed for five years that's god i can't argue with him he will vindicate what he called you foreign and many of you all suffering so that we could suffer can you say it man i shall suffer who wants the suffering forgot to put my hand up away he suffered a suffering because he said it to us for there's only one way to be blessed thank god you know i was i was listening to to one of the brothers you don't have three individuals today that can speak the way they did are looking for their peers all of a sudden get involved pressure i'm thinking of all the people i've come in contact people that have been sick where's the sister i was in peru her daughter's sick sweetheart couldn't sleep at night was being haunted by evil spirits wanted to commit suicide is that any of

faith that you have what you know i was taught when somebody speaks listen to every word that they're saying odd look at this guy let me put it with respect i believe in the gospel but i'm going to tell you so does satan say he preaches this is better than we do is [Applause] everybody thinks because i'm humble that you look like a very poor person a person that can't walk worldwide my name is known let me say it you're either thinking about your barbecue tonight you gotta listen to god's word i will listen to every word why am i saying what i'm saying because i got it somebody so i blew or
