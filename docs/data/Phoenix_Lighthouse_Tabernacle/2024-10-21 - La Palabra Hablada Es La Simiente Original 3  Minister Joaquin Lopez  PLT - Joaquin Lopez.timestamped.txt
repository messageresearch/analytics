[0:19] 18 now he is the head of the church the
[0:23] body who is the beginning the firstborn
[0:26] from the dead that in that in all things
[0:30] he might have the
[0:32] primin he is the
[0:35] head of the church which is his body and
[0:38] he wants Su Prem listen now listen close
[0:41] while we're going
[0:44] what he is to be the head of the body
[0:48] his bride's body which is taken from him
[0:51] flesh and Bone like an Adam see Bride
[0:54] born from the dead see that's born from
[0:58] the dead sin of unbelief what killed Eve
[1:02] unbelief is that right the unbelief and
[1:05] what but but the UN the unbelief in God
[1:09] no she had faith in God sure did she say
[1:12] there is no God no sir she was an
[1:14] Infidel well she said you know I don't
[1:17] believe his word at all oh no she
[1:19] believed all but one little thing he now
[1:22] didn't the Bible say over the Book of
[1:23] Revelation Jesus said himself I I jesus
[1:26] sent my angel to testify these things un
[1:28] you whoo ever shall take one word from
[1:31] it or add one word to it and if all this
[1:34] heartache and sorrow had to come because
[1:36] a woman doubted one word of God will he
[1:40] let you back doub in one word he'd be
[1:45] unjust see that wouldn't be right
[1:47] condemn here's one man standing he calls
[1:49] all his heartache because of one word
[1:51] doubt it then he goes ahead and takes
[1:52] years of experience and everything Bible
[1:55] and so forth and others who give their
[1:57] life for and say oh you can go ahead and
[1:58] eat that's all right I'll let you back
[1:59] anyhow
[2:01] God is no respect of person
[2:04] but God is no respector person I know
[2:07] notice now he is the head of the body
[2:10] that's born from the sin of unbelief in
[2:13] God's
[2:14] word that is that excuses every
[2:17] denomination every
[2:20] Creed unbelief in the word which is
[2:23] himself The Word of Life see the word
[2:27] only has life any other word is a high
[2:29] hbd no matter how much it looks like it
[2:31] it isn't the word the word produces its
[2:34] own life that Eve swap for personal
[2:40] knowledge see how the church has today
[2:42] through some man's understanding Moses
[2:45] had a great understanding of God till he
[2:47] met the burning bush then he saw his
[2:49] failure the burning bush had what Moses
[2:52] lacked amen the words got what the
[2:54] denomination
[2:56] likes he the head is the first fruit of
[3:00] the Resurrection we go off this
[3:01] Revelation just a little while longer if
[3:03] you say
[3:04] so just a little bit now he is the first
[3:08] fruits of the Resurrection is that
[3:10] right what then what is he he's the head
[3:15] of the
[3:17] body which is his church bride then the
[3:22] bride body must follow the head for it
[3:25] is part of his resurrection and part of
[3:29] the mystery
[3:31] amen it's impossible for it not to
[3:35] go it's part of God's mystery how God
[3:39] revealed himself here and raised it up
[3:40] by the word so he reveals the church and
[3:42] raises it up by the same word it's a
[3:45] part of his threefold mystery as the
[3:48] head was tucked from the grave so must
[3:50] the body follow him back to Eden where
[3:54] the head of the family the man the
[3:57] bridegroom the bride being the body of
[3:59] the bridegroom must follow the bride
[4:01] because that's the head and the head's
[4:03] revealed and come back with eternal life
[4:05] and the body must follow that because it
[4:09] is husband and wife again amen as long
[4:11] as you're pregnated with the same word
[4:13] which is his body you've took his body
[4:15] becoming him when you took the word not
[4:17] the Creed the
[4:19] word oh my wouldn't I make a text for
[4:22] this afternoon to go on my wouldn't that
[4:24] be wonderful see just think of it now
[4:28] what it is therefore the body cannot
[4:32] recognize don't you fail this the body
[4:37] therefore cannot recognize any other
[4:40] headship but the
[4:43] word because of the head is connected
[4:46] with the body and the head is the word
[4:49] and it's the same
[4:52] word one headship therefore
[4:55] denominations and holy fathers and
[4:58] everything else is dead
[5:00] done there's one headship that's Christ
[5:04] the body only recognizes one thing the
[5:07] word I show me where somebody was
[5:09] baptized in the body in the name of
[5:11] Father Son and Holy
[5:15] Ghost and watch you
[5:18] recognize yeah I realize I'm talking to
[5:20] thousands on tape you know we got tape
[5:22] Ministry around the
[5:24] world what name are you baptized in for
[5:27] there's not another name given under
[5:29] heaven said the
[5:30] word whereby man can be
[5:34] saved if you're baptized to show your
[5:37] belief in Christ and then take on a
[5:39] Creed
[5:41] name then you're
[5:44] hybrid if you're not exactly like that
[5:46] church is exactly like they're teaching
[5:48] then you Catholic
[5:49] people how can you go under the
[5:52] jurisdiction of a pope now saying that
[5:55] he is a successor by Apostolic
[5:57] succession from from Peter and this Pope
[6:00] in this church teaching so contrary to
[6:01] this first word which God recognized by
[6:05] signs and wonders to be his church and
[6:08] to see that same word being brought
[6:10] forth today in its Purity showing the
[6:13] same resurrection that he had there God
[6:15] living among these people doing the same
[6:17] things then you can recognize a headship
[6:19] in Rome or headship is in heaven I'm not
[6:22] going to Rome I'm going to heaven when I
[6:24] die the headship is in heaven and the
[6:29] body must follow the head as the wife
[6:32] follows the husband being that Adam was
[6:35] not deceived he walked out with Eve Eve
[6:38] was deceived she was in the
[6:40] transgression or the entire resurrection
[6:42] of the whole body would have come forth
[6:43] at the day of the Lord Jesus when he
[6:45] come forth from the grave but he had to
[6:47] redeem her which is his body she has to
[6:49] be redeemed in order to come to
[6:53] him you you see it
[6:58] oh see
[7:00] it couldn't have happened then the
[7:02] Redemption is going on I see the seals
[7:05] when he's in his mediatorial work back
[7:07] here redeeming but someday he comes
[7:08] forth to get this book that he's
[7:11] redeemed and all that's in this book
[7:13] would be him or that's a Believer the
[7:16] words in the book and the word is him
[7:18] and all it's in that he come forth for
[7:20] this book of redemption whose names are
[7:23] written on the book before the
[7:24] foundation of the world when he was
[7:25] slaying as a
[7:26] lamb and here he is today
[7:30] in his word manifesting the same thing
[7:32] he did there she can't recognize another
[7:36] headship no there's no Bishop no nothing
[7:39] she recognizes one headship that's
[7:41] Christ and Christ is the
[7:42] word oh
[7:45] my I love that that's right as the head
[7:49] was tuck up from the grave so must his
[7:52] body follow him into Eden therefore the
[7:54] body cannot recognize any other headship
[7:57] but the headship of the word
[8:00] no denomination can put anything to it
[8:03] for whosoever shall take one word away
[8:05] from it or add one word to it it took
[8:07] away from it they're dead hrid right
[8:09] there she's back this testimony in her
[8:11] hands the filthiness of her fornications
[8:13] committing a spiritual adultery against
[8:15] the very word that she claims to believe
[8:17] therefore it's word or nothing that's
[8:19] right he the word how do you know it's
[8:22] right he the word is Vindicated see he
[8:26] the word properly Vindicated is the
[8:28] headship
[8:30] the head of the church he is the word
[8:33] the headship he's properly identific
[8:36] identified Vindicated by his own spirit
[8:39] being in the church itself the person
[8:42] showing forth himself in Vindication is
[8:45] a direct proof to the entire
[8:50] body you don't need Creeds Z
[8:53] denominations has perished but the
[8:56] headship itself recognized in the body
[8:59] by personal
[9:02] identifications see identifying himself
[9:05] proves a headship to the body then we
[9:08] are united under one Vindicated headship
[9:12] that is Christ the word of
[9:15] God not under any church then our
[9:19] headship is a kingdom the kingdom of God
[9:22] is within you said the Bible Jesus the
[9:25] kingdom we are not a
[9:27] denomination We Belong to a
[9:30] kingdom and the kingdom is the word of
[9:34] God made spirit and life in our own life
[9:39] bringing to pass every promise in this
[9:41] day as it did in that day when the word
[9:44] in God was one and the word in God is
[9:47] one in his church today making it the
[9:49] headship of the body that is redeemed to
[9:53] bring the message in the last day and be
[9:55] taken up from the dead in the
[9:56] resurrection to go back and restore
[9:58] again his at in the
[10:01] beginning the threefold mystery of God
[10:03] his body oh my notice closely now like
[10:08] en types Israel of
[10:10] old am I taking too much time don't let
[10:13] me go we ain't got about 20 more pages
[10:17] amen
[10:19] but just a little bit now and then then
[10:22] I'll leave you all go till next summer
[10:23] sometime it's the Lord willing see now
[10:25] look notice now United together under
[10:29] one headship in a like manner type of
[10:32] Israel of old now you getting it like
[10:35] Israel of old one God of Vindicated by a
[10:41] pillar of fire and revealed himself
[10:44] through a prophet to be the
[10:46] word the same God same Pillar of Fire
[10:50] same way he cannot change his
[10:54] way is that as perfect as it can be is
[10:57] it one God how many gods did Israel have
[11:01] how many is a bride God one how many
[11:04] will there ever be sure
[11:06] sure under the leadership of the Holy
[11:11] Spirit which was the pillar of fire in
[11:13] the days of Moses the great prophet he
[11:16] was directed by a pillar of fire is that
[11:18] right all right going to a promised land
[11:22] and in the Christian age there was one
[11:26] God which appeared in the form of a
[11:28] pillar of Fire
[11:29] to a prophet called Paul who was sent to
[11:32] the Gentiles to take a people out for
[11:33] his name's sake Hallelujah is that
[11:37] right and in the last days has come down
[11:41] in like manner of vindicating himself
[11:44] see in the same sign same Wonder same
[11:47] Pillar of Fire same gospel same word
[11:50] same
[11:51] manifestation his body will do the works
[11:54] that he promised like in Mark 16 and so
[11:56] forth his body was not held in the grave
[12:00] but was recognized with him in the
[12:03] resurrection do you get it then the body
[12:07] of his believing
[12:08] children will not be held in the grave
[12:12] when he comes but will be recognized
[12:14] with him because he died for the purpose
[12:17] to resurrect his bride the body
[12:20] recognize because it is his body because
[12:22] it's a word it's so completely yielded
[12:26] from denomination things to him and he
[12:28] is the word see and it's recognized with
[12:32] him because now we have the first fruit
[12:34] of our Resurrection but know that we
[12:35] pass from death into life become
[12:36] prisoners with his and God proving to us
[12:39] by his personal headship that he is the
[12:41] same yesterday and forever doing the
[12:43] same things through the church that he
[12:44] did then he and me and I and him and you
[12:47] you know so forth that's right his body
[12:50] was not held in the grave recognized
[12:52] with him in the resurrection same as he
[12:54] is now listen which means this his word
[12:58] which he is
[12:59] has been begin to be risen the word that
[13:05] down to the age of Luther
[13:08] Wesley has begin to raise up to its
[13:11] power they begin to
[13:13] move they moved a little more now it's
[13:16] coming up to
[13:19] identification see watch now to the life
[13:23] in the body is a Vindication of the
[13:26] Rapture is at hand when you see the
[13:30] headship and the body becoming one and
[13:34] the fullness of the measure of his
[13:36] manifestation shows that the body is
[13:38] about ready to be received to the
[13:43] headship nations are
[13:45] breaking Israel's Awakening see what I
[13:48] mean he has beg to give life into his
[13:51] body why the one that he has redeemed
[13:54] immedi work is done he's bringing his
[13:57] life to body in a Vindication for the
[13:59] Rapture remember now in the last day uh
[14:05] if you just bury me on this just a
[14:07] little bit it'll be all right I don't
[14:09] want you to miss it and I got to I got
[14:10] to take this paint now I've been to
[14:12] start this far one more great remark I
[14:14] want to make if I have to move over a
[14:16] little of it now notice listen to this
[14:20] now is the great thing now is where we
[14:23] want to watch remember in the last days
[14:28] will ad ex L go back and vindicate the
[14:32] first
[14:33] day see Adam and Eve husband and wife no
[14:37] sin life then the fall notice notice
[14:43] closely up notice what caused
[14:47] it
[14:50] Lucifer
[14:52] Lucifer is doing now as he did at the
[14:55] first
[14:57] time just as the the kingdom of the
[14:59] Gentiles was brought in with King
[15:01] Nebuchadnezzar Vindicated the Gentile
[15:04] Race by a prophet who could interpret
[15:07] unknown tongues Visions
[15:11] dreams and it's come down through the
[15:13] Gentiles without anything it's me of
[15:15] persans ir and so forth and then the
[15:17] feed it goes out the same
[15:19] way again the Gentile Kingdom notice
[15:24] Lucifer in the last days is doing as he
[15:26] did at first what did Lucifer do the
[15:29] first thing that Lucifer done to
[15:31] separate the fellowship of God and man
[15:33] he wanted to build him a United
[15:36] Kingdom of Greater
[15:39] Splendor and seemingly more
[15:43] cultured a greater Kingdom than Michael
[15:46] Christ
[15:48] had you got it now now if you miss it
[15:51] just hold up your hand I'll say it again
[15:52] you see see Lucifer at the beginning his
[15:56] purpose and heart was to achieve
[15:59] a brighter and greater thing in heaven
[16:02] than Christ had is that
[16:04] right by seemingly a more cultured more
[16:08] beautiful more Splendor than the kingdom
[16:10] of
[16:12] Christ do you think we'll have
[16:14] automobiles in the Millennium and
[16:16] airplanes see what Lucifer's doing now
[16:20] the big fancy intellectual denominations
[16:23] are doing the very same thing Gathering
[16:25] themselves together to do the same thing
[16:28] see
[16:30] they are gathering and denominating
[16:32] himself themselves each one trying to
[16:34] beat the other and now they got so much
[16:36] Splendor they don't know what to do but
[16:37] to unite it with the Catholic
[16:40] Church Lucifer
[16:42] again building a bigger Kingdom to push
[16:45] out people that don't believe in
[16:47] denominations and even take their Church
[16:48] buildings and make store rooms and the
[16:50] pastors of such has no rights at
[16:53] all and a man that is a godsent man
[16:56] would never stand in denomination if
[16:57] you're hearing this or seeing
[16:59] he got enough to go out and look at it
[17:01] certainly see I don't say it critically
[17:03] I say it
[17:04] truthfully to see that reveal notice in
[17:09] this last days Lucifer is doing the same
[17:12] thing can you see it the devil doing the
[17:15] same thing building a a hybrid Church a
[17:20] hybrid by hybrid members hbr by
[17:23] knowledge instead of the word by
[17:25] intellectual man instead of born again
[17:27] man building an intellectual Kingdom
[17:31] that'll outshine Christ's little bitty
[17:34] flock see what is it that did that
[17:38] Fallen
[17:40] Angels the Bible say was Fallen Angels
[17:43] who listen to Lucifer instead of Christ
[17:45] who they once belonged to is that right
[17:48] now listen close Fallen Angels what kind
[17:51] of
[17:52] angels Luther Wesley Catholic
[17:57] Pentecostals who kept not their first
[18:01] estate like the Angels did and it's fell
[18:04] into organizations like Lucifer's main
[18:06] ho at
[18:08] NAA and what have they done organized a
[18:11] great ecumenical Association of
[18:13] ministers to make an image into the
[18:16] Beast as the Bible said and building a
[18:18] Christian economy that will close the
[18:21] doors of this church and others
[18:25] like see Lucifer at's work I'm tring to
[18:29] bring you the three-fold Revelation or
[18:31] mystery of
[18:33] God what did they do sold out to
[18:36] reasonings of wisdom and education like
[18:39] Eve
[18:40] did Fallen Angels did Wesley was a man
[18:44] of God but what followed him for Angels
[18:48] got into it what was the Angels first
[18:51] created beings of God but fell for
[18:53] Lucifer's
[18:54] wisdom fell for Lucifer Lucifer's wisdom
[18:59] and you see what they become fallen
[19:00] angels and organizations from man of God
[19:03] who went forth to establish truth in the
[19:06] earth before that truth could go on and
[19:09] proclamate and get on to the real
[19:10] revelation of Christ Fallen Angels come
[19:13] in and took it over and made
[19:14] denominations out of it that's the
[19:16] reason the revelation of the seven seal
[19:19] mystery had to be unfolded
[19:23] amen amise God now you see it yes amen
[19:28] what they left off if Luther would have
[19:31] went on it have been here if Wesley
[19:34] would have went on if Pentecost would
[19:36] have what would they done now there's
[19:38] only one thing can happen there has to
[19:40] be a message at the end time when there
[19:44] is nothing else can follow it and now
[19:46] the ecumenical world has set up such a
[19:48] regime that there can be no denomination
[19:51] and no nothing else follow it you're
[19:54] either in it or you're not in
[19:56] it the fruit is in the top of the tree
[20:00] and the light is shining on that
[20:01] predestinated fruit and she's rening
[20:03] into Christ like fruit bringing forth
[20:07] the same melness and sweetness and the
[20:09] same spirit that he had in him hope you
[20:12] see it Hallelujah see I try to put too
[20:14] much in one Daye a we you out look they
[20:17] sold out to reasonings sold out to
[20:20] reasonings of denomination if I can just
[20:22] belong to this the the mayor goes to
[20:23] this
[20:24] church if I can be a Methodist or a
[20:27] presbyterian just look where they've
[20:28] gone I've just explained them limbs are
[20:30] pruned off they're dead they're not
[20:32] connected with Christ anymore they' be
[20:33] bringing the same life they're not
[20:36] connected with it but there's they're
[20:38] like a citrus fruit any citrus fruit
[20:39] will live on a citrus tree but it'll
[20:41] bring its own fruit you put a grapefruit
[20:43] in a in a orange tree it'll live by the
[20:46] orange tree but it bring forth
[20:47] grapefruit you put a lemon in there it's
[20:49] a citrus fruit it'll bring forth an or
[20:50] sour lemon but it's living all the life
[20:53] and that's what denominations are doing
[20:54] by under the name of the
[20:56] church it's the bride
[20:59] that's the original tree the original
[21:01] Spirit the Revelation comes from Christ
[21:03] not the denomination
[21:05] Christ
[21:08] notice what the denomination trying to
[21:10] exalt itself like
[21:13] Lucifer they so call themselves The
[21:16] Church the bride which they are
[21:17] Revelation 17 as it spoke of the false
[21:20] bride above Christ's Little Flock the
[21:22] bride Lucifer thanks and exalts himself
[21:27] above the humble word of of God's truth
[21:29] by the knowledge of the
[21:31] Revelation and has placed himself by
[21:34] Seminary education and
[21:36] theology until they have got themselves
[21:39] up and if you don't belong in their
[21:40] group then you are a
[21:44] outlash like Lucifer did in the
[21:48] beginning saying to the people just
[21:50] exactly what Lucifer said to Eve surely
[21:54] God will receive us we feed the poor
[21:57] that's good
[21:59] surely you will receive us we are a
[22:01] great denomination we are a beautiful
[22:04] Church well look at our great buildings
[22:06] look at our great membership we stand in
[22:08] the millions surely God will not turn
[22:11] that group down the same thing that Cain
[22:14] did brought in the pretty fruits from
[22:16] the ground that he had Ked and toiled
[22:18] and worked and brought in the fruits and
[22:20] rejected the humble blood of the
[22:26] Lamb God have mercy that man women will
[22:29] not think I'm saying this to exalt
[22:31] something or some personal revelation or
[22:33] something I'm only telling you the truth
[22:36] and you see what they're
[22:38] doing yes amen I speak it loud and harsh
[22:41] but you got to drive an a to the
[22:42] clenches if it's going to do any good
[22:45] till you'll see it now saying to the
[22:49] people surely you mean to tell me that
[22:52] our great Catholic churches stood all
[22:53] this time our great Methodist and look
[22:55] at our
[22:56] forefathers but they broke the word of
[22:58] the Lord and Eve was God's one of his he
[23:02] she was a byproduct of
[23:05] Adam and because she doubted one word of
[23:08] God's word it did it and here's Lucifer
[23:12] at his job again today and remember the
[23:15] Antichrist is not communism the
[23:18] Antichrist is so close like the real
[23:20] thing till it deceive the very elected
[23:22] if it was possible Jesus said Matthew 24
[23:24] the elected if it was possible Lucifer
[23:28] again Lucifer again is breaking God's
[23:32] unity in Man by his is limiting the word
[23:37] of God to his reasonings what he thinks
[23:40] is right and what he thinks he breaks
[23:42] the word of God and the same thing he
[23:44] did in the days of Jesus and Jesus said
[23:45] you by your Traditions has made the word
[23:47] of God of no effect and the
[23:50] denominations by their organized uh
[23:53] intellectual reasonings has made God's
[23:55] word of no effect upon the people right
[23:58] they just can't see it then they say
[24:00] where is the god of the
[24:01] Bible he's right here he's the Bible
[24:04] that's what he is notice now Lucifer
[24:07] comes into
[24:09] kindness and breaks the unity of
[24:12] God to man just like he did in Eden by
[24:17] great Temptations of promises of
[24:20] self-power and
[24:23] exaltations well you might become a
[24:25] bishop if you just stay with us you
[24:27] might become a district president
[24:29] why would you go to something like that
[24:30] see that's
[24:32] Pentecostal the Catholic and so forth
[24:34] see a great false promise to man to
[24:38] receive power outside the word and
[24:40] promise of God you receive power when
[24:43] the Holy Ghost has come up you not when
[24:44] you become a bishop or a deacon or
[24:46] whatever are amen see but
[24:48] Lucifer and they set in the little
[24:50] buildings anywhere they could on
[24:52] Hard Rock floor you know that if you
[24:56] talk to NAA Council in the pr I see of
[24:58] counsel and I see of fathers and so
[25:00] forth in the history of the church they
[25:02] had nothing but when they had this
[25:04] Council and inducted some of the Roman
[25:07] paganism into Christianity and put holy
[25:10] man and Bishops and so forth and popes
[25:12] and all this kind of nonsense what did
[25:15] Constantine give them I asked any
[25:17] Theologian to tell me he gave them
[25:19] property he gave them freedom and all
[25:22] that they wanted and they swapped the
[25:26] word of God for the w wisdom and culture
[25:29] of man and that's the same thing Lucifer
[25:32] did then he did in the Garden of Eden
[25:34] and they died right there the
[25:36] Pentecostal Church died at n Rome but to
[25:39] be resurrected in the brid tree in the
[25:41] last days notice Lucifer comes in conon
[25:45] like he did Dan and by Temptations and
[25:47] false promises of power out apart from
[25:50] the word of God he did the same at I see
[25:52] of Rome he's doing the same today at the
[25:54] World Council of ecumenical churches
[25:57] that's all unite together the Pope says
[26:00] I want all my economical Brethren out
[26:02] there to unite with me we are one that's
[26:05] right in organizations you are one but
[26:07] that has nothing to do with the bride of
[26:09] Christ not a thing brother you'll never
[26:13] wash her in anything like
[26:14] that now it is Promised in the last days
[26:19] that the original faith in the seemed to
[26:23] be restored to the children of God at
[26:26] the time of the brid tream
[26:28] Malachi 4 God said before the world
[26:32] burns up with fire behold I S to you
[26:34] Elijah the prophet and he will restore
[26:36] the faith of the children now that
[26:38] wasn't the first Elijah to come no no
[26:41] now we don't teach your Elijah's Manel
[26:43] and Elijah's blankets and all those
[26:45] things like that we just teach the word
[26:46] of God that's what he said see we got
[26:48] all kind of Elijah this and Elijah that
[26:51] which is
[26:51] nonsense that's we know that that's I'm
[26:54] not talking about that and you spiritual
[26:55] minded understand see is the late hours
[26:57] getting late and can't put it all on
[26:59] this paper of course now promis in the
[27:02] last days now if the Jesus said and and
[27:05] Matthew I believe the 11th chapter the
[27:08] sixth chapter and 11 no it's 11th
[27:10] chapter and about the sixth verse when
[27:12] John sent his disciples over there to
[27:13] see if he really was the one Jesus said
[27:16] who did you go out to see a a a wind a
[27:20] reed that's shaken by the winds did you
[27:22] go out to see such and such he said or
[27:24] did you go to see a prophet he said more
[27:26] than a prophet John was more than a
[27:28] prophet he was the messenger of the
[27:32] Covenant and he said if you can receive
[27:35] it this is he which is spoke up of the
[27:39] prophets I'll send my messenger before
[27:41] my faith now that's Malachi three not
[27:45] Malachi 4 because the Elisha that was to
[27:48] come in Malachi 4 their Earth was to be
[27:50] burnt with a fervent Heat and the
[27:52] righteous was to walk out in the
[27:54] Millennium upon the ashes of the wicked
[27:58] so it is not that one see now we see the
[28:02] Promise being fulfilled Christ the true
[28:06] headship going in coming in his bride
[28:10] doing the same works that he did at the
[28:12] beginning and making ready and
[28:15] fulfilling his word as he did at first
[28:17] in John 14:12 he that believeth on me
[28:20] the works that I do shall he do also
[28:23] then the head and the body are becoming
[28:25] one in works and in sign
[28:28] and in life Vindicated by God himself to
[28:33] his promised word for the last days he
[28:35] promised this in the last days now if
[28:37] you're spiritual you catch
[28:39] it then we can see that the marriage
[28:44] supper is at
[28:46] hand now if I never see you again
[28:49] remember the married supper is at
[28:52] hand and then the kingdom according to
[28:55] the promise is ready to be issued in the
[29:00] great Millennium the taking up of the
[29:02] church to the destroying of the wicked
[29:04] and the world under the Sixth Seal to be
[29:08] purified by volcanic to take all the
[29:11] corruption and sin of the world and to
[29:13] molder out again and bring forth a
[29:15] bright New Millennium for the age that
[29:18] is to come when we see all these great
[29:21] treeful revelation God in Christ Christ
[29:24] in the church the kingdom coming Adam
[29:26] and Eve redeemed back to the Garden of
[29:28] Eden in the representation of Christ and
[29:30] his bride and then the kingdom is going
[29:33] to be restored according to his promise
[29:35] praise be to God now by the revelation
[29:38] of the three-fold mystery the secret and
[29:40] by the personal Vindicated word by his
[29:43] original
[29:47] headship not say well glory to God we
[29:49] shout hallelujah we sing that OT

[57:44] Pulpit may the Lord bless him wherever

[57:48] that are with
[57:51] him the word of God reads
[57:57] in the beginning God created the earth
[57:59] and the
[58:08] Heaven and the Earth was without form
[58:11] and void and the Darkness was upon the
[58:13] face of the deep and the spirit of God
[58:15] moved upon the face of the
[58:21] waters and God said let there be light
[58:23] and there was light
[58:29] and God saw the light that it that it
[58:32] was good and God divided the light from
[58:34] the
[58:40] darkness and God called the light day
[58:42] and he called The Darkness uh night and
[58:45] the evening and the morning were the
[58:47] first
[58:48] day let's go to verse 11 Brothers
[59:04] God said let the Earth bring forth grass
[59:06] and Herb yielding seed and the fruit
[59:09] tree yielding fruit after his kind whose
[59:12] seed is in itself upon the Earth and it
[59:15] was

[1:01:43] blessing I have a small thought
[1:01:45] Brothers I know it's nothing
[1:01:49] new IID like to speak a little bit of
[1:01:51] the
[1:01:53] seed but the Seed of Abraham
[1:01:57] you know who the seat of Abraham is
[1:02:08] right and I want to let you know that in
[1:02:10] Hebrew the seed is is called
[1:02:18] zerah it refers to like uh Earth uh like
[1:02:22] the seed of plants like you read in
[1:02:23] Genesis uh 1:1
[1:02:28] where it says to for the earth to bring
[1:02:29] forth
[1:02:31] grass herbs yielding
[1:02:35] seed and the fruit tree of all of it
[1:02:39] after its
[1:02:46] kind the Covenant God made with Abraham
[1:02:49] in the Book of
[1:02:52] Genesis chapter 12
[1:02:56] verses 1 two and
[1:03:00] three note it down I'm just going to
[1:03:02] read it quickly so I could take
[1:03:04] advantage of
[1:03:13] time now the Lord had said unto Abraham
[1:03:16] get thee out of thy country and from thy
[1:03:18] Kindred and from thy Father's House onto
[1:03:21] a land that I will show thee
[1:03:28] and I will make thee a great nation and
[1:03:30] I will bless thee and make thy name
[1:03:32] great and thou shalt be a
[1:03:41] blessing and I will bless them that
[1:03:43] bless thee and curse him that curseth
[1:03:45] thee and in thee shall all families of
[1:03:48] the earth be
[1:03:52] blessed physical SE literally Brothers
[1:04:00] the seed is is like a seed that's
[1:04:02] planted in the ground as you
[1:04:04] know produces a new
[1:04:10] plant like we just read it's it's found
[1:04:12] in Genesis
[1:04:16] 111 where God orders for the earth to
[1:04:18] bring forth herb Ying
[1:04:23] seed you can also see it as a descendant
[1:04:30] like the seed can be you can say like my
[1:04:35] descendants like you could say I'm the
[1:04:37] father of Antonio
[1:04:40] okay you could say the father of my
[1:04:42] grandp my grandfather there's a
[1:04:45] descendant there it's also a
[1:04:51] seed as you can read in 21 Genesis 21:12
[1:04:56] where it says that Isaac is the Seed of
[1:05:02] Abraham and you can say that's also an
[1:05:09] inheritance in a broader sense the seed
[1:05:12] is also referred to uh spiritual
[1:05:19] inheritance promises and values that go
[1:05:21] from generation to generation
[1:05:26] I was explaining to Antonio a little bit
[1:05:28] ago that his daughter was just
[1:05:31] born she's my
[1:05:36] descendant descendants of my grandpa
[1:05:39] father of my
[1:05:41] dad and it just continues the
[1:05:44] descendence
[1:05:49] continues and it can also be used in a
[1:05:51] kingdom as
[1:05:53] well it says in the context of the
[1:05:55] oldest
[1:05:57] Testament the seed can be referred to
[1:05:59] the kingdom of
[1:06:01] God like Israel's
[1:06:04] Nation The Chosen seed of
[1:06:09] God in the message the angel of the
[1:06:14] Lord preached on April 14
[1:06:18] 1951 I'm going to read this quote real
[1:06:21] quick
[1:06:27] Jesus said a s went forth and sold some
[1:06:35] seeds and an an enemy came behind him
[1:06:38] and saw some
[1:06:44] tears and the husband the husband man
[1:06:48] said shall I go and pull up the terce
[1:06:56] and said if you do you will pull up the
[1:06:59] wheat let them grow
[1:07:04] together and on that day I will send the
[1:07:12] angels and they will gather all the
[1:07:14] tears and burn them and the weed will be
[1:07:16] taken to the gardener
[1:07:28] uh as I was saying last time I got
[1:07:31] chance to speak I was saying where the
[1:07:33] seed went to uh Stone Stony lands
[1:07:38] and where it was Thorns no no dirt or
[1:07:42] very little
[1:07:47] dirt this is where it continues this
[1:07:49] what we're talking about again
[1:07:57] in this message Brothers uh brother B
[1:08:00] starts talking about Hebrews chapter 6
[1:08:06] ver4 says that it is impossible for
[1:08:08] those who were once
[1:08:11] enlightened made partakers of the
[1:08:13] Heavenly
[1:08:17] gift partakers of the Holy Spirit and a
[1:08:20] Heavenly
[1:08:23] calling and likewise
[1:08:28] tasted of the good word of God and
[1:08:32] world powers of the world to
[1:08:37] come verse six say
[1:08:40] if shall fall
[1:08:43] away to renew themselves again to
[1:08:49] repentance seeing that they crucify
[1:08:52] themselves AR fresh the son of God
[1:09:00] and the count of the blood with with
[1:09:02] with they were Sanctified as an Unholy
[1:09:14] thing for the rain cometh off upon the
[1:09:17] Earth to dress
[1:09:19] It prepares
[1:09:23] it but the thistles and Thorns are to be
[1:09:28] burned and it says
[1:09:32] notice in this same wheat field that was
[1:09:36] sld there is barriers
[1:09:39] creepers stink weed there's
[1:09:44] everything all growing together with the
[1:09:48] wheat and when there's a drought is
[1:09:52] on the creeper is just as thirsty
[1:09:56] for water as the wheat
[1:09:59] is the water is sent for the
[1:10:04] wheat but the creepers just as glad to
[1:10:07] get the water as the wheat
[1:10:11] is and by and that's why it says and by
[1:10:14] our fruits you shall know
[1:10:18] them in the meeting of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:21] Falls over the
[1:10:24] building but those who live Godly in in
[1:10:27] Christ
[1:10:29] Jesus are the people that be taken to
[1:10:31] the
[1:10:33] Garner and the TS not for us to
[1:10:38] judge but it will be burned at the
[1:10:42] end you see what I mean brother Brandon
[1:10:44] is
[1:10:45] saying like I was telling you
[1:10:48] Brothers the seed has a logical
[1:10:51] meaning important in the Bible
[1:10:56] it relates with the idea of
[1:11:00] continuity the promise that God won't
[1:11:02] abandon his
[1:11:07] people and his Plan of Salvation will
[1:11:10] take place through the
[1:11:12] generations this P Covenant is is
[1:11:17] fundamental it's fundamental for
[1:11:19] Biblical
[1:11:23] history God promises Abraham is's going
[1:11:25] to have a large
[1:11:27] descendant he'll be a great
[1:11:31] nation and he'll be a great blessing for
[1:11:33] every family in the
[1:11:35] Earth the Seed of
[1:11:39] Abraham becomes a symbol of Hope For
[1:11:45] Humanity it's a promise that God has as
[1:11:47] a Plan of
[1:11:52] Salvation then we change to the seat of
[1:11:55] God in the New
[1:11:58] Testament brother Brandon was speaking
[1:12:00] on the Old Testament
[1:12:02] there but in the New
[1:12:06] Testament the seed of God takes even a
[1:12:09] deeper
[1:12:11] meaning Jesus presents as the Seed of
[1:12:15] Abraham the promised
[1:12:18] Messiah you can find it in Matthew
[1:12:22] 1:1 and and it says that Jesus is son of
[1:12:26] David Son of
[1:12:30] Abraham and this lineage connects Jesus
[1:12:33] with the Covenant that God made with
[1:12:37] Abraham showing that he is the
[1:12:38] Fulfillment of the
[1:12:43] [Music]
[1:12:44] promise also the seed of God relates
[1:12:47] with the New Creation in
[1:12:52] Christ Galatians verse three uh
[1:12:55] chapter 3:1
[1:12:59] 16 says that the promises of God were
[1:13:02] given to
[1:13:04] Abraham and also his seed which is
[1:13:09] Christ this seed doesn't only refer to
[1:13:13] Jesus but also everyone that believes in
[1:13:17] him that we are Heirs of God's
[1:13:23] covenant we have have the Apostle Paul
[1:13:26] using the metaphor of the
[1:13:29] seed to describe the Christian
[1:13:34] Life First Corinthians 3 ver
[1:13:42] 6 Paul Compares all the Christians to
[1:13:44] Farmers who plant the seed of the word
[1:13:46] of
[1:13:49] God as I'm reading this comes to my mind
[1:13:56] some say they were from Apollo some from
[1:14:01] Paul but we are all Christians we're
[1:14:05] we're all of Christ nobody's from other
[1:14:07] people we're just from
[1:14:10] Christ because God is the one that gives
[1:14:12] the
[1:14:13] understanding and also the
[1:14:23] growth the growth of the seed depends on
[1:14:25] the work of the Holy
[1:14:30] Spirit who gives the life to the word of
[1:14:33] God in the hearts of the
[1:14:39] Believers and also the seed of God is
[1:14:41] also a promise of
[1:14:47] Salvation the SE of God is a promise of
[1:14:50] hope and salvation complete salvation
[1:14:56] that's the promise that God has not
[1:14:57] abandoned his
[1:15:03] people that his plan for Humanity is is
[1:15:07] it will be carried out and that the
[1:15:08] eternal life is available whoever
[1:15:10] whoever believe in the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:15:12] that's a
[1:15:13] promise that's a beautiful
[1:15:16] promise for everyone that's here in
[1:15:19] Jesus
[1:15:22] Christ because he's the only one
[1:15:23] Brothers
[1:15:26] that died for me and you there's no one
[1:15:29] else who can we worship
[1:15:32] more who should we worship
[1:15:35] more we should only be worshiping the
[1:15:37] Lord Jesus
[1:15:39] Christ there's no one
[1:15:46] else the seed of God is a symbol of
[1:15:48] God's
[1:15:50] faithfulness love for Humanity
[1:15:55] and it's desired to restore the
[1:15:57] relationship that was broken by
[1:16:01] sin this is beautiful
[1:16:07] Brothers sometimes we see things so
[1:16:09] simply so
[1:16:11] simple
[1:16:13] I I say because I had a job in a company
[1:16:20] once it's hard for me to work with
[1:16:22] people that not in the message
[1:16:26] because everyone knows that I'm a
[1:16:27] Christian
[1:16:29] there and sometimes I rebuke
[1:16:33] them sometimes they see they say bad
[1:16:36] things
[1:16:38] or and sometimes I say my to my coworker
[1:16:41] you don't have to say like that you
[1:16:43] don't have
[1:16:44] to change that word for another
[1:16:47] one oh here comes the brother
[1:16:49] again that's how it should be I tell
[1:16:53] him when I'm not here
[1:16:57] when I'm not here you can do whatever
[1:16:59] you want but when I'm here just respect
[1:17:01] me a little bit I'm the the Elder one
[1:17:06] here and you can say now what does the
[1:17:09] seat of God mean in the
[1:17:14] Bible the seed of God uh in the Bible
[1:17:17] represents the descendance of of
[1:17:21] Abraham the Messiah the promised Messiah
[1:17:28] the kingdom of God in the spiritual
[1:17:29] inheritance that's pass down through
[1:17:32] generations symbol of Hope
[1:17:37] continuity and the promise of divine
[1:17:41] salvation who is the Seed of
[1:17:44] Abraham who is
[1:17:47] it very few raising hands ra don't be
[1:17:53] ashamed we're all SE of
[1:17:59] Abraham in the Old
[1:18:04] Testament the Seed of Abraham referred
[1:18:06] to his
[1:18:08] physical the or the nation of
[1:18:11] Israel but in the New
[1:18:14] Testament the Seed of Abraham identifies
[1:18:17] with Jesus the promised Messiah
[1:18:24] because it just has to sink into US
[1:18:30] Brothers It's like a machine where you
[1:18:32] put in the coins and you get a
[1:18:35] soda if you don't put in the coin you're
[1:18:37] not going to get
[1:18:40] soda you first have to put in the coins
[1:18:43] and then push the button and get the
[1:18:44] soda that's how we have to be
[1:18:48] brothers we have it has to sink into
[1:18:51] us so you can understand
[1:18:54] to get the Revelation
[1:18:57] Brothers am amen amen
[1:19:05] Brothers what is the New Creation in
[1:19:11] Christ the New Creation in Christ refers
[1:19:13] to a spiritual
[1:19:17] transformation experiences a a person
[1:19:20] experiences when they believe in
[1:19:23] Jesus they become a new
[1:19:27] creature created in the image of
[1:19:31] God the new life and the new Destiny
[1:19:35] Brothers the question
[1:19:39] is how can I be part of God's
[1:19:45] seed you can be part of God's
[1:19:50] seed you have to believe in Jesus
[1:19:52] Brothers how
[1:19:55] how's your
[1:19:57] savior you he died for
[1:20:02] you he suffered our
[1:20:10] pains and by accepting Jesus as your
[1:20:13] lord and
[1:20:15] savior you become a member of God's
[1:20:20] family and you are an he of the Covenant
[1:20:23] God made with Abraham Brothers
[1:20:28] the seed of God is a complex meaningful
[1:20:30] biblical
[1:20:32] concept for
[1:20:38] Humanity and eternal life is going to be
[1:20:41] for everyone that believes in Him
[1:20:47] brother as you understand the meaning of
[1:20:51] the God's
[1:20:52] seed God's seed in the Bible
[1:20:56] Bible then we can have a deeper
[1:21:00] understanding of the Plan of Salvation
[1:21:06] Brothers of the God's promise for
[1:21:10] Humanity and our place in his
[1:21:15] plan because in our minds we have to be
[1:21:19] brothers we have to be in the Plan of
[1:21:22] Salvation we have to be sure
[1:21:27] that we have to be
[1:21:28] there because if you're not sure
[1:21:32] Brothers start
[1:21:35] praying for God to give you
[1:21:39] Revelation for you salvation's for
[1:21:42] you because if that's not the case you
[1:21:45] can't do nothing
[1:21:48] else Jesus the Lord Jesus Christ died
[1:21:50] for you and
[1:21:52] me he's the only one worthy of our
[1:21:54] Praises our
[1:21:56] worship all honor
