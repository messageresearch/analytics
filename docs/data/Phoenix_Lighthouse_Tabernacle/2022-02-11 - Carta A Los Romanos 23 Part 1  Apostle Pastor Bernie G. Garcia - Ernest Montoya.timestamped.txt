[15:06] we greet each and every one of you this
[15:08] morning in the beautiful name of our
[15:09] lord jesus christ
[15:19] [Music]
[15:24] romanos
[15:34] right now we're speaking on the subject
[15:36] of the manifestation of the sons of god
[16:21] romans
[16:22] ocho
[16:26] romans chapter eight
[16:29] [Music]
[16:47] [Music]
[17:16] [Music]
[17:28] [Music]
[17:31] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[17:33] god they are the sons of god for ye have
[17:36] not received the spirit of bondage again
[17:38] to fear but you have received the spirit
[17:40] of adoption whereby we cry abba father
[17:43] the spirit itself bears witness with our
[17:45] spirit that we are the children of god
[17:47] and if children then heirs heirs of god
[17:50] and joint heirs with christ if so be
[17:52] that we suffer with him that we may be
[17:54] also glorified together i reckon that
[17:57] the sufferings of this present time are
[17:58] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[18:00] which shall be revealed in us
[18:02] for the earnest expectation of the
[18:04] creature waited for the manifestation of
[18:06] the sons of god
[18:24] it is
[18:40] lord we ask you this morning that you
[18:41] may open up their eyes
[18:48] that you are saying
[18:51] you're you have sons
[18:53] you have
[19:04] the name of the lord jesus christ
[19:13] [Music]
[19:25] [Music]
[19:34] is
[19:37] [Music]
[19:43] [Music]
[19:51] is
[19:55] [Music]
[20:03] [Music]
[20:18] this is the third message now on the
[20:19] manifestation of the sons of
[20:32] god as we have considered this subject
[20:35] we have seen some details that are but
[20:37] most important to us
[20:52] sometimes i speak so slow and such
[20:55] sometimes an insufficient manner that i
[20:57] really have a struggle to get into my
[20:59] thoughts
[21:22] [Music]
[21:35] we have read and seen here in the
[21:37] scripture that the word of god tells us
[21:38] that we are heirs of god
[21:42] how many of you believe
[21:59] this morning i want to just touch on a
[22:01] little bit that thought that we're heirs
[22:03] of ranks
[22:09] the majority of us already know
[22:24] thanos
[22:30] you have trained us for such a long time
[22:32] now now give us father our ranks
[22:38] [Laughter]
[22:45] when we hit something like that
[22:47] tremendous thing people ask us ask me
[22:50] and say that did he really know what he
[22:51] was saying
[23:07] or excellence see a degree rank is a
[23:10] degree or position of dignity eminence
[23:12] or excellence
[23:21] and we all of us have to receive our
[23:22] rank that is a degree position of
[23:24] dignity eminence or excellence
[23:29] we are not worms
[23:32] i want you to notice
[24:42] that we do are involved
[25:25] we have seen how we were told oh god
[25:27] give us our ranks
[25:31] how many you would like to receive your
[25:32] rank
[25:34] that is your place
[26:05] i've done my duty for today
[26:22] someone that really
[26:37] [Music]
[26:51] i don't really don't know how to say in
[26:52] spanish other than just to say that it's
[26:54] irresistible
[27:00] when you take these words
[27:16] to bear an excess amount of fruit
[27:33] how is it that someone coming to god
[27:35] be with there with god come to them and
[27:37] say to him god give us an excess
[27:45] the only way i can give you something is
[28:01] question as a human being
[28:03] i'm just as human as you are
[28:06] i ask myself
[28:09] how can a person ask
[28:12] because he's saying now lordo
[28:24] now that we have a lot of farmers here
[28:27] um
[28:37] he has seen a tree when it's really
[28:38] overbearing
[28:41] i've seen it in california
[28:45] where the branches have a lot of fruits
[28:47] they bend over
[28:57] there's like crutches they put on
[28:58] crutches so they won't bend all the way
[29:00] over
[29:03] so that the branch will not break
[29:10] so remember that we are branches
[29:18] you find a tree in that condition
[29:22] it's a very fruitful tree
[29:31] [Music]
[29:38] that's what
[30:38] [Music]
[30:54] [Music]
[30:59] men and women
[31:30] god through the messenger
[31:47] [Music]
[31:58] [Music]
[32:54] overpowered
[33:05] we have to see the meaning of each word
[33:06] and how it takes off in its own way
[33:23] the minion over
[33:25] to subject
[33:28] to bring uh under subjection
[33:31] and and that's just to put on your yoke
[34:19] give me my rights
[34:22] and that's to bring under a yoke
[34:25] dominion
[34:32] hola
[35:13] how could it be possible
[35:26] to force them to become subjects
[35:43] if you would open up your bibles with me
[35:45] to genesis
[36:09] maybe in the next few messages on this
[36:11] subject we'll have a better way of
[36:13] writing on the meanings of these words
[36:19] i would like to go back to the beginning
[36:39] if you open up your bible with me to
[36:41] genesis 1 27.
[36:57] so god created man in his own image in
[37:00] the image of god created he him male and
[37:03] female created he them
[37:06] the earth
[37:07] god bless them
[37:09] and god said unto them
[37:22] be fruitful and multiply and replenish
[37:24] the earth and subdue it and have
[37:26] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[37:28] over the fall of the air and over every
[37:30] living thing that moveth upon the earth
[37:43] and even though they're all in the same
[37:45] sentence they all each mean something
[37:47] different the primary cause
[38:01] is
[38:14] to be able to bring to the surface these
[38:16] words
[38:56] which means to bear fruit
[39:12] so when it makes you say the word
[39:14] they're fruitful
[39:17] that we produce fruit
[39:21] and the word question comes because
[39:22] through this
[39:25] because of the rejection is
[39:53] is
[41:04] give
[41:26] [Music]
[41:32] let's look at saint john
[41:34] james
[41:35] chapter 15.
[41:43] quebec
[41:51] i know that uh with this thing that to
[41:53] be fruitful was just to have children
[41:56] to bear fruit or offspring
[41:59] yeah
[42:26] do you love god
[42:27] uh
[42:46] i am the true vine and my father is a
[42:48] husbandman
[42:58] every branch in me that bears not fruit
[43:00] he takes away and every branch that
[43:02] bears fruit he purges it that it may
[43:05] bring forth much fruit
[43:09] so in order jesus christ the lord is
[43:11] saying this way
[43:13] i am the mind
[43:16] my father is the husband
[43:20] and we here are the branches
[43:22] is that right
[43:34] so like in order like
[43:36] the branches what bears a fruit
[43:50] he said that every branch that did not
[43:52] bear fruit he would take away and that
[43:54] every branch that did bear fruit he
[43:55] would purge it that would bring much
[43:57] more fruit
[44:00] if a branch does not have fruit
[44:02] that branches cut off
[44:04] it's placed off to one side
[44:06] is
[44:19] [Music]
[44:34] one thing
[44:38] those orange trees on here
[44:40] when they were not pruned
[44:43] when they were not purged
[44:45] [Music]
[44:47] when the dry branches were not
[45:16] but
[45:44] has been fulfilled
[46:55] be just like the rest of the world
[46:57] what matters is the heart
[46:59] behave like you want
[47:01] to do what you want to do
[47:08] but a message came
[47:19] oh
[48:04] i'm
[48:10] is
[48:31] as the branch cannot bear fruit of
[48:33] itself except abide in the vine no more
[48:36] can ye accept eve abide in me
[48:40] so that's easy to understand isn't it
[48:44] if someone doesn't have any fruits
[49:00] me
[50:52] we want
[51:06] is
[51:31] if a man abide not in me he is cast
[51:33] forth as a branch and is
[51:53] and men gather them and cast them into
[51:55] the fire and they are burned
[51:59] their judgment is coming
[52:01] right now they might weather it in
[52:03] circles they might be tried
[52:06] but the time constant as well
[52:10] to be burned off
[52:13] verse 7 says
[52:16] and
[52:29] and it shall be done unto you it shall
[52:32] be done
[52:34] possibly
[52:37] if we cry a lot or pray a lot
[52:40] it will be done
[52:41] if we are in him
[52:43] and he is
[53:54] see
[53:55] the people that you bear much fruit so
[53:58] shall you be my disciples
[54:00] isn't that beautiful
[54:08] and then that way we'll be his disciples
[54:11] romans chapter 7.
[54:21] the subject that i'm taking is a
[54:22] manifestation of the sons of god
[54:28] and i believe that i'm speaking apart
[54:31] to a part of that group
[54:35] that many of you
[54:36] who
[54:44] romans chapter 7.
[55:05] romans 7 1 know ye not brethren for i
[55:07] speak to them that know the law how that
[55:09] the law has dominion over a man as long
[55:11] as he lives
[55:23] for the woman which has an husband is
[55:25] bound by the law to her husband so long
[55:28] as he lives but if the husband be dead
[55:30] she is loosed from the law of her
[55:32] husband
[55:38] so then if while her husband lives
[55:39] she'll be married to another she shall
[55:41] be called an adulteress
[55:48] but if her husband be dead she is free
[55:50] from that law so that she is no
[55:52] adulteress though she be married to
[55:54] another man pablo
[55:57] paul is a very wise
[56:00] is presenting marriage
[56:12] is
[56:28] she
[56:44] [Music]
[56:55] by the body of christ that ye should be
[56:57] married to another
[57:00] establish
[57:02] he's talking about death
[57:05] in other words
[57:07] to make it clear
[57:09] paul is saying like this
[57:23] until the first one dies
[57:30] because if you mirror before the other
[57:31] one the first one dies
[57:34] adulterers
[57:36] is that right
[57:55] that is even to him who is raised from
[57:58] the dead that we should bring forth
[57:59] fruit unto god
[58:02] in other words
[58:20] unto death
[58:25] i want you to allow
[58:29] for that first husband to die
[58:34] and if you wanted
[58:48] take him lord
[59:02] fellows
[59:13] is
[59:28] is
[59:33] but sometimes we you know in the natural
[59:34] we pray lord take my old man here he
[59:36] just he's worthless
[59:39] he doesn't support me anymore
[59:44] with a nice full check of three hundred
[59:45] dollars hold both she was happy
[59:52] but why don't they ask god for the old
[59:55] man
[59:56] take him lord
[1:00:08] [Music]
[1:00:10] now
[1:00:15] let's look at it
[1:00:18] [Music]
[1:00:30] [Applause]
[1:00:36] so
[1:00:40] [Music]
[1:02:11] you
