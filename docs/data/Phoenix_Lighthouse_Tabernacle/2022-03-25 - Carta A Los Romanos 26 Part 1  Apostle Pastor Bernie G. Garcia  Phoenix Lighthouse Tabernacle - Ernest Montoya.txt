[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] god bless you all this morning [Music] we'll continue back to seeing one of the stanzas in the chorus it's a song that brother brandon really loved [Music] we want to congratulate brother o'gain sister muriel gaines for the very fourth anniversary the game both stand where's mary let's stay like that [Applause] tuesday would you stand so we can sing a happy birthday before we go okay we're going to be married now 28. i thought that was a lot yet he's [Music] [Music] brother douglas also [Music] happy birthday to you do

christ let us sing the chorus [Music] my soul [Music] is still [Music] memories in this doorhouse [Music] where is [Music] against this [Music] anger [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of god matthew 17 [Music] after six days jesus taketh peter james and john his brother and bring them up into a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as a sun and his raiment as white as a light and behold there appeared unto them moses and elijah talking with him then answered peter and said unto jesus lord it is good for us to be here if thy will let us make here three tabernacles one for thee one for moses and one for elias while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold the voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased we welcome each one of you him [Music] they ever [Music] [Applause] [Music] says [Music] my soul stillness [Music] i'm going to continue on the same subject that we've been on that's a letter to the romans number 26. and it's a subtitle this is the sixth message on the manifestation of the sons of god i'd like to review a little bit what we talked about last sunday but this is the first diagram and if you would open up with me to genesis chapter three 3 we're going to summarize and remember where was the first throne here we are in we see three very important characters in the garden of eden we see that the garden of eden was god's headquarters and we said last sunday that both man and woman were cast out of the garden but before they were cast out we see that the serpent was subject to the man is that right and the lord god said behold the man has become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground from whence he was taken i but the man and the woman were brought forth from from the garden of eden so in the second diagram we put here three things also hey jesus and the disciples uh we know already that both judas and jesus were twins so there are the three characters and inside that circle the god's children found themselves outside that circle god had already thrown them cast them out now to prove that let's look at hebrews chapter 13. in verse 12. wherefore jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate jesus so we see that jesus went out of the camp he went there to a place that was called the skull golgotha ortega [Music] i call [Music] now the third circle we see that this is during the period of the seven church ages encounters [Music] something for the new people when i when i say if you do you understand me say amen i'm not asking you if are you in agreement with me say amen one of you believers can answer me from the audience and say when did this cloud appear raise your hand uh [Laughter] it says there and out of his mouth go with a sharp sword that with it he should smite the nations out of his mouth like from god's mouth to moses's there's two main things that i want you to notice and we can open our bibles to see the first one juan diaz saint john chapter ten what comes out of god's mouth first of all it's a sharp sword and a sharp sword is the word what comes out of god's mouth okay once again what comes out of god's mouth where does it go jesus answered them is it not written in your law i said ye are gods if he called them gods and to whom the word of god came and the script scripture cannot be broken the prophet says the word comes to the prophet word comes to the prophets with from the dead a little item uh and bring under subjection [Music] how many of you want to exercise that word in your life [Music] we all want to be lords of want to be partakers of that word that was foreign to be lords to subdue who you got let me have the meaning and subdue yeah [Music] was brought so that we could to take us back to the beginning so this is the thought that i'm bringing the first thing we should have to bring on this objection or subdue another millionaire for something else we have to subjugate subdue ourselves bring this body under subjection its order and the first thing we have to subdue garcia myself to be able to be used is the pastor and then the sheep number two everything is scaling up start at the bottom [Music] second third and then we're going to get to the fourth step the prophet shepard el propheta and then the sheep how many of you believe that god through the prophet of this age is a prophet pastor number three jesus shepherd jesus jesus then halfway under jesus jesus jesus shepherd and then sheep number four god the holy spirit don't be afraid to answer if you know who gives birth to sheep el pastor is so the prophet pastor of everybody so all the believers pastor [Music] william is god through william brown is that right no but notice a lot of people say well my pastor is william branham is how was it then that if he was a prophet pastor of this age the shepherd because even though there is a sheep that give the wolf and they also give birth to elk is the prophet shepard and he was also subject to jesus the shepherd is that right and jesus god in flesh because many people jump on the local pastor over jump over [Music] shepherd he gives his life for the sheep and i'm going to give his life for the sheep he took the place as a lamb so he also was a lamb he gave his life entonces to exercise i'm going to go back to the cloud have you understood so far how many want authority a lot of people say well if they made me do you can i straighten out the thing right away i've placed the cloud here a oh i know that when you say that a lot of people think boy he's crazy and i i know that they have a right to believe like that and as i think that i come to that conclusion the is he thinks he's going to win the battle but of revelation [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you
