[29:52] individuals
[30:07] this message that i'm going to speak
[30:09] it's going to be a little hard
[30:14] but i received it from a seven-year-old
[30:20] a young lady seven years old
[30:23] seven year old
[30:25] little girls don't know too much
[30:29] we think they don't know too much
[30:32] but here i was
[30:34] drinking uh
[30:36] mineral water outside
[30:40] my granddaughter comes to me
[30:43] she's gonna be seven
[30:46] she's six years old going on seven
[31:00] so then i'm outside i had my shoes off
[31:03] my socks on or
[31:05] my socks were on i had i was uh perched
[31:10] my legs were stretched
[31:16] i mean she said
[31:18] there are a lot of predators
[31:22] all around us
[31:26] and they're looking for
[31:28] a parade to eat
[31:33] here's a
[31:34] second grader
[31:36] and she corrects me all the time i'm
[31:38] going to be a third grader
[31:42] your name is zoe
[31:44] i believe god talks to her
[31:48] i believe god talks to her
[31:51] it's like all little kids
[31:53] god will talk to those that humble
[31:55] themselves
[31:57] in other words those that are submissive
[32:00] to god's word
[32:03] [Applause]
[32:05] and she's talking to me and telling me
[32:07] uh
[32:09] that i pray
[32:12] is a weak
[32:14] animal
[32:16] so then the snakes
[32:18] the coyotes
[32:23] the rabbits they all go after the
[32:25] weaklings
[32:26] again
[32:36] um
[32:37] her
[32:39] allergies
[33:08] and i said what's going on and she goes
[33:11] remember i'm going to
[33:13] get operated tomorrow and i need prayer
[33:20] again this is a babe
[33:30] that all the angels would surround her
[33:32] in the evening
[33:35] but the angels would be in that
[33:36] operation
[33:40] that the holy spirit would guide the
[33:42] doctor
