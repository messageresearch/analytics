[42:52] the kingdom of our God and the power of
[42:55] His Christ
[42:56] for the accuser of our Brethren has cast
[42:59] down which accused them before our God
[43:02] day and night

[43:05] yeah
[43:19] and they overcame
[43:21] him by the blood of the lamb and by the
[43:24] word of their testimony yes
[43:30] and they loved not their lives unto
[43:34] death
[43:37] amen amen
[43:40] you may take your seats Brothers
[43:45] what I would like to talk about today
[43:47] Brothers
[43:48] as you can see on the presentation
[43:51] the overall
[43:53] I guess theme of uh Sunday nights
[43:59] is how can I overcome
[44:02] and after listening uh to uh messages of
[44:06] apostle yes
[44:10] um I felt inspired to put a subtitle
[44:15] raising my white flag to him
[44:22] Brothers I I believe um we can all uh
[44:26] relate
[44:29] throughout time
[44:32] uh times have been getting a little bit
[44:35] more difficult
[44:38] and it has been said he said
[44:42] that in this time
[44:44] it would be
[44:47] and as we as I sat with a couple of
[44:51] Youth here and there is
[45:02] I see that that the devil is really
[45:05] hitting hard
[45:09] but something that our Apostle spoke
[45:14] something that really really got to me
[45:17] Impacto
[45:21] it says that the the problem here
[45:27] it's not it's not out there
[45:30] the problem is within here
[45:36] all right
[45:40] so what I what I would talk would like
[45:43] to talk a little bit yeah when I when I
[45:46] was younger brothers
[45:48] I was in high school
[45:51] and
[45:53] something that I was really struggling
[45:56] with
[45:59] um I I was I believe it was uh my senior
[46:01] year
[46:05] um I was struggling on what to do
[46:11] um what was going to be of my life
[46:13] and I think most of most of the uh young
[46:17] adults today
[46:22] um their thought really goes to
[46:24] Pennsylvania
[46:26] what's my purpose
[46:30] why does God have been planned for my
[46:32] life
[46:35] sometimes what's what happens is
[46:38] that the Unseen
[46:42] it kills you it's okay
[46:47] and and some something that happens
[46:51] that when there's uh unknown
[46:59] we tend to make decisions that aren't
[47:02] right
[47:04] correct us
[47:06] and because because we don't have a
[47:09] specific
[47:11] um in our minds we don't have a specific
[47:13] Pathway to go to okay
[47:18] something planned for us
[47:23] and that happened to me yes
[47:28] um something that that uh I was going
[47:31] through during that time
[47:33] most likely at the beginning of the year
[47:38] I don't know if you guys know
[47:42] but my mother was struggling with uh
[47:46] problems from the heart problem
[47:51] and at that time
[47:54] um
[47:56] like my mom would say
[47:58] I'd have one foot here and one foot
[48:00] there
[48:03] and my mother would say
[48:06] you have to make a decision
[48:09] you can serve two Gods at the same time
[48:17] but it's something that happens
[48:20] I decided to go out with my friends
[48:23] Amigos I'll be a little sincere with you
[48:28] um we went out and uh with the car and
[48:31] we were on people's yards
[48:36] uh it was it was bad yeah
[48:40] um and when I got home uh
[48:45] I found out that my mom was awake
[48:53] and and she was worried yesterday
[48:58] I believe at that time my uh uh no no
[49:01] she wasn't yet but
[49:03] um at that time when I got there
[49:08] my mom was very very worried to the
[49:11] point
[49:14] um that she was having uh problems with
[49:17] with breathing and and yes
[49:22] because of her problem that she was
[49:25] having
[49:27] and uh I recall years back
[49:33] um my grandma spoke to me one time
[49:36] and she told me and
[49:40] um possibly maybe maybe not it wasn't
[49:42] the right thing to say at the moment
[49:46] but what she told me
[49:48] she says
[49:50] if you don't stop doing what you're
[49:52] doing because
[49:55] you're gonna kill your mother from a
[49:57] heart attack
[50:02] and in my mind
[50:04] I I didn't think that was possible
[50:08] but when I saw the scene that day yeah
[50:13] I I felt like I stepped back a little
[50:16] bit
[50:19] and I looked at where I was at at that
[50:22] momento
[50:26] and I thought to myself
[50:29] is that really what I want
[50:33] do I want to cause this pain
[50:37] the person who gave their life
[50:41] gave everything for me
[50:45] and this is my repayment
[50:49] that was my mentality at that momento
[50:56] and I in within within myself he then
[50:58] through the me I said something has to
[51:01] change
[51:04] but something has to change
[51:10] during that year a lot of things
[51:12] happened
[51:15] um as I I've said uh in previous times
[51:17] before
[51:19] I had gone to a youth campaign
[51:27] God dealt with me
[51:31] and it is it is so now I think about it
[51:37] it's so great how God works things in
[51:40] your life
[51:43] to bring you to that point
[51:48] you can probably thought out by yourself
[51:52] but the way he did it
[51:55] was just perfect yeah
[51:59] and when that happened in my life
[52:03] and I I I I got that that uh personal
[52:09] relationship with the Lord
[52:15] that was a change in my life
[52:19] and I remember that that after I came
[52:22] back from the campamento
[52:25] the first thing I did is
[52:28] I I uh on that Sunday I said Domingo I
[52:32] ran to Brother Carlos Carlos
[52:35] and I say I told him
[52:39] I want to receive the Holy Spirit
[52:42] I want my life to change
[52:45] I don't want to keep living the same way
[52:47] I've been you know
[52:51] that's the decision I made
[52:56] and our Apostle tells us
[53:00] that that has to happen in our lives as
[53:02] well
[53:04] but something that he says
[53:07] you know our Prophet says
[53:12] many of us would probably says
[53:16] uh well that happened to me in 2013 and
[53:19] you know I'm okay now okay
[53:23] no no
[53:25] Paul says Apollo says
[53:34] we have the daily constantly die
[53:51] I would like to read here and I believe
[53:54] it's on the presentation here
[53:56] presentation
[53:58] it's on Matthew 16.
[54:03] 21-24
[54:11] the 24 is what I'm I want to focus on
[54:13] okay
[54:15] but I added a little more just so we can
[54:18] have a little bit of context what
[54:20] happens
[54:22] and it says like this
[54:25] from that time
[54:27] Jesus began telling his followers
[54:33] he must go to Jerusalem
[54:36] he explained to he explained that the
[54:40] older Jewish leaders
[54:42] the leading priest and the teachers of
[54:45] the law would make him suffer many
[54:47] things
[54:48] and he told his followers that he must
[54:51] be killed
[54:52] then on the third day he would be raised
[54:55] from Death is
[55:07] 21 says Peter took Jesus away from the
[55:10] other followers to talk to him alone
[55:13] he began to criticize him he said God
[55:16] save you God save you from these
[55:19] sufferings Lord
[55:21] that that will never happen to you apart
[55:32] number 23 says then Jesus said to Peter
[55:35] gonna get away from me Satan
[55:38] you are not helping me you don't care
[55:41] about the same thing God does you care
[55:44] only about the things that people think
[55:46] are important
[55:56] and 24 says like this
[55:59] then Jesus said to his followers
[56:02] if any of you want to be my follower you
[56:05] must stop thinking about yourself and
[56:07] what you want you must be willing to
[56:09] carry the cross that is given to you for
[56:11] following me
[56:12] questions
[56:20] and number 25 says like this
[56:24] you who will try to save the life you
[56:27] have will lose it
[56:29] but you who will give up your life for
[56:32] me
[56:33] Will Truly find truly will true life
[56:36] will find True Life
[56:45] so right here
[56:47] uh Jesus is telling them
[56:49] now when to me the first time I heard
[56:52] the the scripture
[56:54] a while back
[56:56] he's like yo he really called called him
[57:01] satanas but no what he was really really
[57:04] saying well okay
[57:09] Satan was using him
[57:13] saying the things that he was saying
[57:17] and many times
[57:20] what happens
[57:21] is that
[57:23] within ourselves our brothers and
[57:25] sisters
[57:28] maybe we say something
[57:30] and you're like
[57:33] like well and she's Christian this is
[57:38] Christian Cristiano
[57:43] but our personal profit
[57:46] and the scripture tells us
[57:48] and shows us that it's not your brother
[57:52] it's a spirit in your brothers
[57:57] but how are we supposed to know that
[58:02] right how are we supposed to know that
[58:05] it's not our brother but it's the spirit
[58:06] and our brothers
[58:10] of course the scripture says
[58:14] but it must be a revelation to YouTube
[58:19] and who gives that Revelation
[58:22] but the spirit of God
[58:26] that's why it is very important
[58:30] that we can
[58:32] obtainer the holy spirit
[58:35] because that is what's going to help us
[58:40] identify certain things
[58:43] see things that we probably could not
[58:48] but that is a process
[58:51] something that I I kind of compared to
[58:55] and I'm sorry if some of you are hungry
[59:00] but something I compare it to
[59:03] it's like cooking a pizza
[59:06] Una Pizza
[59:08] I mean yeah you can buy it on on the
[59:10] store
[59:11] and
[59:13] you put it in the oven
[59:15] and you put it for a minute and then
[59:17] it's done
[59:19] but if you're gonna make a pizza
[59:23] there's instructions my instructions
[59:26] there's steps that you must take
[59:30] so that product can come out as it
[59:32] should
[59:36] so if you think
[59:39] that from one night to the other
[59:44] we're perfect perfectos
[59:49] it's a process
[59:51] so when when we look at ourselves
[59:57] I don't want to say give yourself some
[59:58] slack okay this is
[1:00:05] it takes time
[1:00:08] but
[1:00:09] at that time that take that it takes
[1:00:12] we must use it in our on our knees
[1:00:17] asking God
[1:00:21] Lord give me more of you
[1:00:23] change my life
[1:00:27] but something that we've learned
[1:00:32] that in order for us to get to where we
[1:00:34] need to go
[1:00:38] we're gonna have to go through trials
[1:00:41] that's why it says foreign
[1:00:56] but
[1:00:57] when you when you look at yourself
[1:01:02] and uh and you see that you're not
[1:01:05] you're not where you should be
[1:01:09] people around you
[1:01:13] maybe just just uh right now
[1:01:16] just just turn around and look at the
[1:01:18] brothers around you
[1:01:22] right
[1:01:24] we're all we're all gonna make mistakes
[1:01:40] let's give Grace
[1:01:43] let's give Grace
[1:01:45] but what I mean
[1:01:48] is that don't be so hard on
[1:01:52] us
[1:01:53] but as well don't be as hard to yourself
[1:02:06] in in John 11 25
[1:02:09] it says this is
[1:02:12] Jesus said unto her
[1:02:14] I am the resurrection and the life
[1:02:19] he that believeth in me
[1:02:21] though he were dead
[1:02:23] ye shall live
[1:02:25] and whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[1:02:30] shall never die
[1:02:31] believe is thou this is
[1:02:48] something that our
[1:02:50] people uh
[1:02:52] says Allah bastante uh
[1:02:56] he says that a lot of us
[1:03:00] are scared to Die the name was
[1:03:05] yeah that's true yes but that
[1:03:09] why
[1:03:12] I believe is that it's because
[1:03:15] when it comes to change
[1:03:20] I want to insert this here
[1:03:25] when it comes to change
[1:03:29] as a kid
[1:03:31] and your body starts growing
[1:03:35] then your skin starts stretching this is
[1:03:39] I don't know if you've encountered it
[1:03:42] maybe just me
[1:03:45] but it hurts
[1:03:50] and and it will hurt
[1:03:53] because the trials
[1:03:55] are the ones that are going to make us
[1:03:57] grow
[1:04:01] but in order for us to take this trials
[1:04:03] and be able to grow
[1:04:06] we have to take it
[1:04:09] you have to apply it
[1:04:12] foreign
[1:04:32] but it has to happen
[1:04:36] there's no other way
[1:04:45] I I would like I was um I wanted to
[1:04:48] insert this
[1:04:50] uh our Apostle said it at the message uh
[1:04:54] uh
[1:04:56] I must say in Spanish
[1:05:01] world champion
[1:05:05] and there's certain things that I took
[1:05:10] that
[1:05:12] that I think is very beneficial question
[1:05:15] beneficial
[1:05:16] like I said in the beginning
[1:05:20] the problem is not out there is
[1:05:25] in order for for for us to be closer to
[1:05:29] him
[1:05:31] in order for us to overcome the trials
[1:05:34] we go through
[1:05:39] something has to change in our lives
[1:05:45] and I I want to say this
[1:05:48] our Apostle says this is so
[1:05:51] when you conquer yourself
[1:05:56] you come as a lamb to the slaughtero
[1:06:02] here I am Lauren
[1:06:07] let thy will be done like I said
[1:06:13] you know you say it so easily he said he
[1:06:15] said
[1:06:17] but it's so hard I don't know about you
[1:06:20] but it's hard you said there's this
[1:06:24] I I when I when I hear this
[1:06:28] and uh I think about it
[1:06:33] I
[1:06:34] I as hearing the messages of our
[1:06:37] apostles
[1:06:40] all I can think to myself
[1:06:45] just like like what it said there say
[1:06:47] Aki
[1:06:49] Laura senor
[1:06:51] you're willing me like I said
[1:06:54] our Apostle says
[1:06:57] that you must
[1:07:00] you must surrender yourself
[1:07:03] and the only thing I can think to myself
[1:07:10] uh I all I can picture myself doing
[1:07:15] I I I I I pictured myself and
[1:07:20] and I said I said like this
[1:07:23] and I said Lord senor
[1:07:29] I'm coming to you
[1:07:31] surrendering my life
[1:07:34] do what you will
[1:07:37] cut what you need to cut
[1:07:41] but I want to be like you
[1:07:46] and our Apostle says
[1:07:49] that in order for us to overcome
[1:07:53] is to be like him
[1:07:55] to have him in us
[1:07:58] because he overcome
[1:08:02] um
[1:08:04] so I will overcome
[1:08:08] so in order for us
[1:08:10] to take that step
[1:08:13] we must surrender Our Lives
[1:08:18] say Lord this is toy
[1:08:21] [Music]
[1:08:24] do what you will in my life
[1:08:27] it's gonna hurt
[1:08:30] but I know that at the end of this
[1:08:32] process is
[1:08:36] Motu
[1:08:47] something
[1:08:49] that I I would like to say hello
[1:08:52] and and in this uh I found it in the uh
[1:08:56] uh in the message
[1:09:00] and it I believe it's on the
[1:09:02] presentation presentation uh this is the
[1:09:06] uh
[1:09:07] the part where it says uh message former
[1:09:10] and latter rain
