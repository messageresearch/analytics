[1:14:52] fulfill this way
[1:14:57] foreign
[1:15:22] or we know we shouldn't do something
[1:15:25] and we do it
[1:15:44] my heart was
[1:15:46] up and down my thoughts were going to
[1:15:49] the left and right because we fail to
[1:15:52] understand there is no time
[1:15:56] we either
[1:15:58] come in
[1:16:01] or brother we're going to be left behind
[1:16:03] one or the other I cannot stand
[1:16:07] I cannot sin unless I leave the word and
[1:16:13] I'm not saying this though
[1:16:15] I'm gonna leave my Bible and go sin
[1:16:17] that's not it
[1:16:22] leaving the words change the truth we're
[1:16:26] living the life
[1:16:28] that we received
[1:16:32] from the prophet messenger
[1:16:35] we are leaving the light
[1:16:39] that's the word so let me ask you this
[1:16:42] morning
[1:16:44] can you sin
[1:16:46] can you sin please
[1:16:49] and I can tell you right now what's
[1:16:52] going through our mind is this
[1:17:01] foreign
[1:17:24] and everything is okay with us
[1:17:27] we're either going to be ready that
[1:17:30] bride is either ready that's the word of
[1:17:33] God
[1:17:38] are you either wise or foolish it's
[1:17:40] almost uh
[1:17:43] one or the other
[1:17:45] you know what you are
[1:17:48] what he said
[1:17:51] this altar should have been full
[1:17:58] and what's happening
[1:18:00] the reason iniquity
[1:18:02] we blame it on the pandemic
[1:18:05] I'm not thinking correctly my head hurts
[1:18:11] have somebody pinch your conscience
[1:18:15] something has to awaken the bride we
[1:18:19] gotta wake up
[1:18:22] tighten the belt loop uh
[1:18:26] because the way we're going brother
[1:18:29] the way we're going to
[1:18:32] we're going to get a big surprise
[1:18:36] and it's not going to be your fault
[1:18:38] you can't blame the preachers can't
[1:18:42] blame the teachers
[1:18:44] you got to blame the pasture
[1:18:48] because I didn't break enough little
[1:18:50] feet
[1:18:53] that's hard to say but I'm telling you
[1:18:57] the truth
[1:18:58] that we're out of time look at the clock
[1:19:03] it's almost at midnight
[1:19:10] so how many of you
[1:19:13] heard what he really said
[1:19:17] you need to go back and listen to this
[1:19:20] tape three or four times
[1:19:27] I'm going to tell you I'm going to
[1:19:28] challenge you
[1:19:32] if you know you've done wrong
[1:19:35] you know what from me to you we were in
[1:19:39] San Luis last week
