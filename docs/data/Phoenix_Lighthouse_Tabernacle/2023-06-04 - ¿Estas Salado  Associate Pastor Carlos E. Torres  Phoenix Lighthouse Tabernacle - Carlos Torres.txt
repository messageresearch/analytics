more scripture because it's Matthew 5 13. just write it down Matthew 5 13. this is you're the salt of the earth if the salt has lost the Savior wherewith shall it be salted it is third fourth dense forth God for nothing but cast out and be throated on the foot of men Mark 939 which the following Salado con fuego is Mark 9 49 it reads for everyone shall be salted with fire and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt is good but if the salt has lost its saltedness wherewith will ye season it have salt in yourselves and have peace one with another [Music] it's better to give than to

on the planet Redemption and look um salty don't say that um [Music] is salty muchas many times we interpret things [Music] in a way people think but speaking at the point of view of Christ to be salty it's a blessing it's not bad luck how many of you are assaulted we are [Music] and that automatically takes us to Revelations foreign thank you the way the messenger speaks to us he speaks to us in a life of action life of action [Music] seven Church age that belly before hides behind a religious spirit foreign and making it into pieces anything hmm that's a full opinion that was the opinion
