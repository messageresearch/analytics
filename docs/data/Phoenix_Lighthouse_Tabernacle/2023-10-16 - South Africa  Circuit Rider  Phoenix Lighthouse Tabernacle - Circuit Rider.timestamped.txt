[45:44] [Music]
[45:46] it I like the theme of the convention
[45:48] they
[45:50] had the
[45:52] back the hearts of the father of the
[45:54] children the faith Apostolic Faith and
[45:57] truly
[45:59] Brothers it's
[46:02] necessary Bible tells us that with faith
[46:04] it is impossible to God we must have
[46:09] faith we must know who we
[46:12] are and we know that faith is
[46:14] revelation when you have
[46:16] faith you have
[46:20] revelation we must recognize who we
[46:24] are truly we're special
[46:29] people it's not you that's doing the
[46:32] work when you able to get
[46:35] yourself and let God work through
[46:38] you he is the one that's doing the work
[46:42] he is
[46:43] helping he is
[46:45] saving but he needs hands he needs a
[46:48] mouth he needs a voice he needs
[46:52] feet he works through every man
[46:57] that's God's plan that he
[46:59] chose he wants to use you and
[47:02] me to reach all
[47:06] those where you can give them words of
[47:08] love and
[47:10] encouragement to be able to help just
[47:12] one person and that's how God is where
[47:15] is
[47:16] God he is hidden
[47:20] in skin in every one of his
[47:23] children and he has a purpose for every
[47:26] one of
[47:27] us there in the Church of brother

[48:18] little but within
[48:20] myself sometimes I want I want to cry I
[48:24] want to run

[48:29] say you have to loen
[48:31] up and let God use you don't hold back
[48:36] on he wants to use
[48:39] you what matters what people say are we
[48:44] crazy this is the madness I when I was

[48:57] Lord because I love
[49:00] that everybody knows me as a person

[50:11] said and that's the most
[50:13] important there are things we don't
[50:16] understand there are things that I don't

[1:04:43] French it was a
[1:04:46] blessing to be able to be with them AF
[1:04:50] Africa
[1:04:53] Brothers it's different what you know
[1:04:56] it's completely
[1:04:59] different because of our
[1:05:02] culture as
[1:05:06] Hispanics in certain way we have a lot
[1:05:08] of complexes we have a lot of
[1:05:12] [Music]
[1:05:16] complexes our worship completely
[1:05:19] God we worship
[1:05:21] genuinely but we like to Worship in
[1:05:23] secret
[1:05:25] like to Worship in our
[1:05:27] heart it's a genuine
[1:05:29] worship what I like about
[1:05:32] Africa with all their
[1:05:35] heart genuine
[1:05:39] worship and they will let you know that
[1:05:41] they're worshiping with all their heart
[1:05:43] they're not they're not embarrassed
[1:05:45] about and they're not
[1:05:49] ashamed shout
[1:05:53] and we all know that everything has it
[1:05:55] place we understand
[1:05:57] that
[1:06:00] to begin to
[1:06:04] worship care to the right or to the
[1:06:07] left they don't care who
[1:06:09] see their
[1:06:12] desires and have that contact with
[1:06:15] God they want to have that contact with
[1:06:17] the Holy Spirit they don't care any
[1:06:19] about anything el else that's their main
[1:06:22] priority just
[1:06:27] to be able to receive something for that
[1:06:28] service that they came
[1:06:31] for situations are so
[1:06:34] difficult speaking to
[1:06:37] people how much people how much money
[1:06:39] they
[1:06:40] make go that place or in the
[1:06:44] hotel they were making a dollar an hour
[1:06:47] maybe dollar an
[1:06:51] hour and we would to see the prices of
[1:06:53] the food
[1:06:55] how is this
[1:06:57] possible how they could live with those
[1:07:00] wages how can they
[1:07:03] live how can they continue
[1:07:06] on there are people so
[1:07:09] humble that when they go to
[1:07:11] church maybe they have financial
[1:07:14] problems personal
[1:07:16] [Music]
[1:07:17] problems everywhere we go it's the same
[1:07:21] problem something the same problems that
[1:07:24] we have here is the same problems that
[1:07:27] they have
[1:07:32] there but to see how they loosen
[1:07:34] everything up and they put everything
[1:07:37] in it energizes our
[1:07:41] spirit then you begin to balance things
[1:07:45] out and begin to really think what's
[1:07:47] really important what what
[1:07:51] matters we have our things in priority
[1:07:58] things paring things are shouldn't be
[1:08:00] there in it makes you
[1:08:03] meditate the way they surrender
[1:08:06] the the way they're
[1:08:09] looking that way they're not
[1:08:13] embarrassed and to show everyone else
[1:08:15] that they're
[1:08:19] worshiping as God as soon as God starts
[1:08:22] moving moving in
[1:08:26] Spirit they immediately go into the
[1:08:29] wor they're not resisting the Holy
[1:08:31] Spirit they let the Holy Spirit
[1:08:34] flow and that's What Makes Miracles come
[1:08:38] many won't
[1:08:40] happen because we limit
[1:08:44] god with our
[1:08:46] thinking God wants to move a certain way
[1:08:49] and we began to
[1:08:52] reason when we see the way
[1:08:54] they the way they
[1:08:57] surrender that takes the
[1:09:00] liit and miracles begin to
[1:09:04] happen things happen that normally you
[1:09:08] shouldn't because people themselves are
[1:09:11] taking away the
[1:09:14] limits they're taking away limits so
[1:09:16] that God can come and do whatever he
[1:09:17] wants to
[1:09:22] do
[1:09:24] just a small
[1:09:46] [Music]
[1:09:52] presentation

[1:16:48] someone which side would you going to

[1:18:30] that all of a sudden when I was back
[1:18:32] in I felt something pop Within
[1:18:35] Me opened up and then this one opened
[1:18:38] [Music]
[1:18:40] up I could hear the birds out there in
[1:18:42] the
[1:18:43] morning
[1:18:46] why matter we must stand on what we
[1:18:49] believe does matter what BR we must
[1:18:51] stand we say we believe soon or later
[1:18:55] our faith has to be
[1:18:58] proven the first we have we're going to
[1:19:01] run
[1:19:01] out then what are we believing in let
[1:19:05] continue open up your heart this
[1:19:08] morning whatever you need at this time
[1:19:11] God can give it to you it's not a
[1:19:13] coincidence that you're
[1:19:15] here we're going to let God that God use
[1:19:19] the plan that he
[1:19:20] has our pastor of the
[1:19:23] church bring us this words open up your
[1:19:26] heart may the Lord bless
[1:19:31] you stand up for a minute God bless
[1:19:36] you uh it started in March that we had
[1:19:40] been going up and
[1:19:43] down just like
[1:19:45] job wherever God goes the devil's
[1:19:50] there uh the devil has the right
[1:19:53] to enter our mind distort our
[1:19:57] mind but we have and we have been
[1:20:01] identified my vision take your seats
[1:20:04] please my vision has always been an
[1:20:07] Apostolic
[1:20:09] Vision what ber brought
[1:20:13] us that's what we follow nothing
[1:20:17] new it has been
[1:20:19] preached and what we do is we just feed
[1:20:24] off of what our Apostle taught
[1:20:27] us uh and as long as there's blood in
[1:20:30] this body we will
[1:20:32] continue preaching what he
[1:20:35] brought and the good thing about
[1:20:38] Africa they're very spiritual brother
[1:20:41] Brenham
[1:20:43] said in Africa every time someone would
[1:20:48] speak they would use quote the quote was
[1:20:52] on the
[1:20:53] on the
[1:20:54] screen in other words just one word the
[1:20:58] hits that they
[1:21:00] received was there in front
[1:21:04] of so I thank first of all the wives of
[1:21:07] these two
[1:21:10] individuals because without them I
[1:21:13] couldn't have made
[1:21:15] it it's not age it's not tiredness but
[1:21:20] what we need to
[1:21:21] do
[1:21:23] we're a team it's no longer one
[1:21:27] person it now is a team it has to be a
[1:21:31] team effort in other words if I don't
[1:21:34] have a team I'm going to
[1:21:37] lose you're going to lose the people are
[1:21:40] going to lose as long as we
[1:21:43] stay
[1:21:45] identified with what brother Brenham
[1:21:47] said as long as we are
[1:21:50] trained the way we should be trained
[1:21:53] before we go
[1:21:55] out to be
[1:21:58] sent you need to be
[1:22:01] trained so we believe that with all our
[1:22:04] heart what I need to do and what I do I
[1:22:08] know the people wanted me to speak I
[1:22:10] already know that I took enough messages
[1:22:14] to speak 15
[1:22:16] messages that's not it what we have to
[1:22:20] do is show the
[1:22:24] individuals what we have been
[1:22:27] producing
[1:22:30] what Paul taught what Paul taught what
[1:22:35] he believed was what he saw in Jesus
[1:22:40] Christ what brother Bram taught what he
[1:22:44] believed he saw in St
[1:22:47] Paul what
[1:22:50] ber saw and taught and
[1:22:53] believe is what he saw in William Mary
[1:22:56] and Brenham what this church this chosen
[1:23:00] Church believes today is that we
[1:23:06] believe our
[1:23:08] Apostle but we will
[1:23:12] teach we will not go away and that is
[1:23:16] why we
[1:23:17] train why teams because you want to hear
[1:23:22] he me I need to make sure everybody
[1:23:26] knows who they are why because sooner or
[1:23:30] later someone has to take that Banner to
[1:23:35] different places the Bible says go into
[1:23:39] all the
[1:23:46] world give me 10 individuals and I'll
[1:23:50] conquer what
[1:23:53] the
[1:23:54] world give me 10 individuals and I shall
[1:23:58] conquer the
[1:24:00] world later in life he said give me one
[1:24:05] self-sufficient
[1:24:08] individual that will conquer world
[1:24:11] that's this
[1:24:13] church the church has to continue the
[1:24:17] teaching of that Apostolic Faith it
[1:24:21] won't go away
[1:24:23] as long as there's
[1:24:25] blood life a desire a vision then this
[1:24:31] will
[1:24:32] continue no
[1:24:34] coincidence Hallelujah when our pastor
[1:24:37] our Apostle dedicated the church on 35th
[1:24:42] Street 35th
[1:24:44] Avenue and he said this is the pattern
[1:24:48] Church of all churches voice of
[1:24:51] restoration
[1:24:53] he didn't make a mistake you are
[1:24:57] chosen I want you to say it I have been
[1:25:01] chosen I have been chosen you have been
[1:25:05] chosen we have been chosen take the
[1:25:10] gospel don't tell me I'm
[1:25:12] tired don't tell me I'm weak don't tell
[1:25:16] me I have no
[1:25:17] money tell
[1:25:20] me that you're identified
[1:25:24] what the Apostle brought
[1:25:26] us that changes the scenario that
[1:25:30] changes the life of
[1:25:32] indivual and that's what they
[1:25:35] want they want more of him because
[1:25:39] they're watching
[1:25:41] you how many hits do we get I don't
[1:25:45] know the internet how many hits we get
[1:25:48] procession for each service I'm going to
[1:25:52] tell you they see you they either see
[1:25:56] you smiling they either see you
[1:25:59] preoccupied or they see you
[1:26:02] rejoicing just like in Africa brother
[1:26:05] Bram said they were special
[1:26:09] people what about us what did he say
[1:26:12] about the Hispanic people tell me what
[1:26:15] he
[1:26:17] said you're the most
[1:26:20] humble in the
[1:26:22] indidual those people from Phoenix
[1:26:26] Arizona pH from Brother Garcia's church
[1:26:30] are a
[1:26:32] byproduct we are a byproduct of the main
[1:26:38] Church according to what we've been
[1:26:43] taught and we will keep it going we will
[1:26:46] not stop until each
[1:26:50] country that speaks
[1:26:53] Spanish
[1:26:55] Latinos
[1:26:57] receive our Apostles
[1:27:00] message so I tell you brother Brenham
[1:27:02] said
[1:27:04] this led by the
[1:27:07] spirit a little old fellow down there
[1:27:11] laying down by the pool of
[1:27:14] Bethesda been L laying there 38
[1:27:20] years 38 years
[1:27:23] this person was there laying in his
[1:27:27] C
[1:27:29] years is that a long
[1:27:32] time waiting for that angel to come for
[1:27:36] that
[1:27:42] angel to heal
[1:27:44] him brother Brenham
[1:27:49] goes with an infirmity
[1:27:53] his body how many of us have
[1:27:59] infirmities all let me tell you I'm
[1:28:01] going to say it again how many of us
[1:28:03] have a sickness in bodies I am
[1:28:08] bread there is a sickness in our
[1:28:12] body don't tell me there's not in the
[1:28:15] mind it's either in your
[1:28:18] soul or in your
[1:28:21] tissues matter what we do there's an
[1:28:24] infection because we're called humans I
[1:28:27] heard brother B and brother Bernie
[1:28:31] said you're worth how
[1:28:33] much 80
[1:28:36] what 83 cents full of
[1:28:41] what 16
[1:28:44] elements you dress
[1:28:48] it you look in the
[1:28:50] mirror you admire
[1:28:53] it and you have
[1:28:56] worms that one day will destroy this
[1:28:59] body but we have the
[1:29:02] assurance that that day when it
[1:29:05] comes something will res this
[1:29:11] body are you identified with
[1:29:14] that are you
[1:29:16] identified with what brother Brenham
[1:29:18] brought are you
[1:29:20] identified what you believe what you
[1:29:24] hold
[1:29:28] dear he continues to
[1:29:33] say
[1:29:35] praying with all their heart how many of
[1:29:39] us pray with all our
[1:29:42] heart if not for our kids our LED ones
[1:29:46] our neighbors our Associates at
[1:29:49] work we pray day and night
[1:29:53] somebody's going to hear
[1:29:56] it that is why when I take a team do I
[1:30:01] do all the preaching when I go do I do
[1:30:03] all the preaching when I go do I do all
[1:30:06] the teaching when I
[1:30:08] go I need to build
[1:30:12] a a special
[1:30:15] force that they're not
[1:30:19] afraid of devils that come and tell you
[1:30:23] that there's something wrong I need
[1:30:26] individuals soldiers that will fight a
[1:30:30] good fight and know that they have been
[1:30:33] chosen by
[1:30:35] God they were
[1:30:39] baptized no before the foundation of the
[1:30:42] world you were chosen I don't care what
[1:30:45] you look like I don't care what you've
[1:30:48] done I want to see the result
[1:30:52] result in you that you can go out put
[1:30:56] your foot Toe to
[1:30:59] Toe with the devil and say what he is
[1:31:03] he's a
[1:31:04] bluffer he's a
[1:31:08] liar say amen
[1:31:12] amen so what I like about these two
[1:31:16] individual lot of things I
[1:31:20] liked look
[1:31:22] what I like about them is they're
[1:31:26] simple they can take a
[1:31:30] joke how many of you can take a
[1:31:33] joke and the reason I say it
[1:31:36] from because I don't have a religious
[1:31:40] spirit I used
[1:31:42] to but when brother Paul Garcia
[1:31:46] junor told me be careful going to take
[1:31:50] 20 years before
[1:31:52] indidual what you've
[1:31:55] done what did I do look at your
[1:31:59] face I look at my face every day I see
[1:32:02] the same
[1:32:03] thing God made me what I am
[1:32:07] ugly so pardon my
[1:32:10] French but it did take 25 years
[1:32:15] before a generation had
[1:32:19] to so I tell you give me a fa
[1:32:22] love each other if somebody says
[1:32:25] something against you they offend you
[1:32:28] love
[1:32:31] them it's hard when you and I can
[1:32:37] see on all
[1:32:41] things it's easy because he's a friend
[1:32:44] because he's a brother but what about
[1:32:47] the person that doesn't believe what you
[1:32:50] believe see
[1:32:53] you got to love the person you got to
[1:32:56] pray for the
[1:32:58] person that's your
[1:33:00] weapon that's my secret of all the
[1:33:04] success that I've had in the mission
[1:33:06] field the only reason we're successful
[1:33:10] is because we know what prayer
[1:33:14] is you say
[1:33:16] Amen so brother Brenham
[1:33:20] continues Jesus was led by the
[1:33:25] spirit to where he was talking about
[1:33:28] this
[1:33:30] person and Jesus was led by the Holy
[1:33:33] Spirit right
[1:33:35] now where he was and healed
[1:33:40] him well we know that there was an
[1:33:43] angel comes down there's thousands of
[1:33:47] people but only one person that was him
[1:33:52] killed now this is what brother Brenham
[1:33:56] say when the rest of them were thinking
[1:34:00] about their
[1:34:03] diseases and
[1:34:05] things again what are we thinking sick I
[1:34:09] have this problem that problem this B is
[1:34:13] killing me I have no money when they
[1:34:16] were thinking those things nobody loves
[1:34:20] me
[1:34:22] God doesn't hear
[1:34:23] me they were thinking those
[1:34:26] things
[1:34:31] said and he went away from
[1:34:35] them never said a
[1:34:40] word how was he
[1:34:43] healed if not by the
[1:34:45] shadow of Jesus Christ not only the
[1:34:49] shadow but here he is yes another lady
[1:34:53] just trying to reach for the
[1:34:58] Garment something was going to
[1:35:05] happen brother Brenham
[1:35:08] continues I can see a bunch of
[1:35:11] people that were
[1:35:14] cowardly
[1:35:16] 120 all that little old cowed people
[1:35:23] and there they
[1:35:24] were I would say here there's
[1:35:28] maybe less than 80
[1:35:31] today there was 120 of them they didn't
[1:35:37] agree first day they didn't
[1:35:40] agree second day they disagreed the
[1:35:44] third day they looked at each other the
[1:35:46] fourth day they were
[1:35:49] thinking I think God called me for the
[1:35:53] ministry no God called me because I got
[1:35:56] a vision called because I dream a
[1:36:02] lot God called
[1:36:06] me because I'm a good
[1:36:10] person brother Brenham said that's
[1:36:16] fully everybody wants a
[1:36:19] calling God has to vindicate what you
[1:36:24] are vate your
[1:36:28] calling not just because I have a
[1:36:31] dream just because I talk in
[1:36:34] tongues not because I help the
[1:36:37] pastor God has to
[1:36:43] vindicate so he goes
[1:36:50] on
[1:36:54] they were up in little old step one time
[1:36:57] but God
[1:36:59] said Don't You Preach
[1:37:02] anymore sorry what did I say I I'm an
[1:37:04] old
[1:37:05] Geer what did I
[1:37:08] say don't you
[1:37:10] preach
[1:37:13] anymore don't you sing
[1:37:16] anymore don't you testify anymore until
[1:37:22] until you have been filled the Holy
[1:37:26] Ghost
[1:37:29] then he he Jesus Christ is going to lead
[1:37:35] you to all the
[1:37:38] nations preach the
[1:37:40] gospel once were filled with his
[1:37:46] anointing you can

[1:38:07] you to just say anything

[1:38:22] standard and
[1:38:24] conventions places we go to we speak no
[1:38:30] Doctrine what we
[1:38:32] speak is winning souls for the kingdom

[1:48:49] suffering
[1:48:51] will allow us to
[1:49:00] rain I'll give that to you as somebody
[1:49:02] said as
[1:49:06] homework what I want to finish
[1:49:11] with I had a call this
[1:49:13] morning a rooster
[1:49:18] call gu
[1:49:22] so it's brother
[1:49:24] Mundi he calls me from the
[1:49:27] Congo and I'm
[1:49:29] like in the background I he all these
[1:49:34] roosters must have been about four or
[1:49:36] five I could hear them
[1:49:39] clearly and he had a soft
[1:49:41] voice he told me what you said greet the
[1:49:46] Saints on my
[1:49:49] behalf brother
[1:49:51] jacqu said the same thing he text me
[1:49:54] this
[1:49:56] morning they love
[1:49:59] you we go back next
[1:50:02] year I plan to take a larger
[1:50:06] group the reason is I want the five
[1:50:11] churches if I have to rent the
[1:50:14] building to be Under One
[1:50:16] Roof to hear the same message
[1:50:20] ministerial
[1:50:21] meetings because there's so
[1:50:25] many problems in the churches
[1:50:28] today and I say it because there's many
[1:50:32] many
[1:50:33] problems simple
[1:50:37] problems and we like we
[1:50:41] did in
[1:50:43] guara solved and took away many spirits
[1:50:47] issues that they
[1:50:48] had so I I want you to remember those
[1:50:51] three
[1:50:52] things remember that you create the
[1:50:57] atmosphere and it's up to
[1:51:00] you so I'm heard of the phone
[1:51:04] call and something said take
[1:51:10] this so I started thinking wow Lord I'm
[1:51:15] tired I haven't stopped since
[1:51:18] March
[1:51:23] and it's I heard it
[1:51:25] again take it so what do I
[1:51:30] do who do I listen to as he said the two
[1:51:35] thoughts remember how I
[1:51:37] started God's there Satan has to be
[1:51:41] there so I tell you
[1:51:44] today if you are lacking something in
[1:51:46] your
[1:51:48] life I haven't
[1:51:53] forgotten I haven't
[1:51:58] forgotten I wait on
[1:52:01] God I can't do it on my
[1:52:05] own because if I do it on my own I will
[1:52:09] fail but if I do it with
[1:52:12] God and it's God on the
[1:52:15] scene you don't have to
[1:52:18] worry
[1:52:21] so I'm going to do
[1:52:23] this I want all my
[1:52:27] Troopers to come up
[1:52:32] here TR is the
[1:52:34] elder here you
[1:52:39] go and what I want you to
[1:52:44] do I thought I had more Troopers in
[1:52:47] this it has to be a re
[1:52:51] that you have been called that you're
[1:52:54] part of my
[1:52:56] [Music]
[1:52:58] truth once you're part of my
[1:53:00] truth then what we're going to do is
[1:53:04] you're just going to touch the
[1:53:07] Garment touch the
[1:53:10] Garment then I want you to reach
[1:53:13] out there's a black hole
[1:53:16] somewhere no there is a black hole
[1:53:21] there is a
[1:53:24] door Einstein called it a
[1:53:29] black all it was was
[1:53:35] space but we know them as
[1:53:40] holes a window a door into another
[1:53:45] place and what you got to
[1:53:48] do all you have to do is hold it enter
[1:53:52] in the holy of
[1:53:56] holy
[1:54:00] receive what's in your
[1:54:03] heart and when you touch it you're
[1:54:06] touching not the Elder but you're
[1:54:10] touching the Garment of Jesus Christ
[1:54:13] remember this is one of the
[1:54:18] last things that brother Brenham prayed
[1:54:22] for there are no more I mean I had some
[1:54:26] big ones small green
[1:54:30] ones I can't find anything
[1:54:36] anymore they wanted this in Africa they
[1:54:39] wanted me to cut it you know how I
[1:54:43] felt here's Jesus's garment and they
[1:54:47] started to
[1:54:48] cut
[1:54:50] it's
[1:54:51] whole it's never been
[1:54:56] cut so come and touch his
[1:55:00] garments and when you put your your
[1:55:04] arm you're reaching into
[1:55:07] eternity every sickness every
[1:55:12] worry will go
[1:55:14] away just like Carlos said he couldn't
[1:55:16] hear but what he did he entered into a
[1:55:19] another
[1:55:21] dimension by faith he was able to touch
[1:55:25] it by faith we are going to make it
[1:55:30] family you're my family I got to care
[1:55:34] about you care about
[1:55:38] you there's something wrong with me

[1:55:53] family loving each other like
[1:55:58] family and that's all we are as
[1:56:02] a so whatever you
[1:56:05] want you're going to come through reach
[1:56:08] into
[1:56:10] eternity hold
[1:56:12] it put it into your
[1:56:14] heart and I will guarantee you God is
[1:56:18] God today
[1:56:20] wanting to be
[1:56:22] identified W you to grab his
[1:56:25] blood and apply
