[19:57] that's the reason we come together

[20:04] vamos

[21:27] [Applause]
[21:30] [Music]
[21:41] [Music]
[21:56] is
[22:04] this evening we'll be talking on a short
[22:07] subject
[22:08] el poder
[22:20] [Music]
[22:24] i believe sincerely that praise is a key
[22:28] okay
[22:31] [Music]
[22:34] and i believe that that key opens the
[22:37] doors of heaven
[22:50] to celebrate with words
[22:54] [Music]
[22:57] the word praise is synonymous with the
[23:00] word to glorify
[23:02] significa which means to
[23:06] offer tribute
[23:10] magnificat the word uh praise is
[23:14] synonymous with the word magnify exalter
[23:18] to exalt to
[23:20] [Music]
[23:25] let's open our bibles to luke the 24th
[23:27] chapter
[23:28] verso verse 53.
[23:36] it's the last verse of the book of luke
[23:40] 1 in taking these scriptures
[23:47] and taking this short thought for a few
[23:49] moments
[23:55] i think it takes us back to the early
[23:58] church
[24:00] [Music]
[24:02] so we can see how it was that they lived
[24:08] verse 53
[24:16] adios
[24:25] [Applause]
[24:28] a man comes close to a young lady
[24:34] the first thing he does is try to try to
[24:36] praise her
[24:38] oh you're so purty you're such a good
[24:42] cook what beautiful eyes you
[25:05] slowly but surely that woman begins to
[25:07] remember those words she heard from the
[25:09] man
[25:12] forgive
[25:25] are the wolves that have learned to have
[25:27] that key in their hands
[25:29] amen and i believe
[25:32] spiritually that's why the wolves
[25:36] in the spiritual antenna
[26:08] i sincerely
[26:09] [Music]
[26:22] that would be different but the bible
[26:24] says that the people
[26:26] daily praised god
[26:31] let's see an example of how they came in
[26:37] the bible says that they daily entered
[26:39] the temple
[26:43] where did you come in through the window
[26:50] came
[27:04] if he is around then he's sharper than
[27:06] we think
[27:10] let's look at the one psalm 100.
[27:17] make a joyful noise unto the lord all ye
[27:20] lands
[27:24] he that the things make the noise
[27:32] if
[27:47] powerful audience pray unto god
[27:51] but if you read your origin enjoy say my
[27:53] healer
[27:54] can you imagine
[27:59] i'm safe
[28:39] and you tell the waitress i want a
[28:42] hamburger with
[28:43] extra onions
[28:46] and since you say onions she wrinkles
[28:48] her nose
[28:50] when she comes back she throws the plate
[28:52] at you
[28:55] you don't even feel like eating the
[28:56] hamburger after that is all right
[29:00] it happened to me like that at a
[29:01] restaurant here the other day
[29:05] i waited for an hour for them to bring
[29:07] me a piece of paper
[29:09] and they didn't bring it
[29:25] here there's an announcement advertised
[29:27] that you have pie who says
[29:30] you know that when you go somewhere and
[29:32] someone serves you yes
[29:37] and they serve you making faces and
[29:39] looking ugly at you
[29:43] you don't even eat uh you don't even eat
[29:45] happily
[29:50] says that a dry piece of bread in a
[29:52] house of peace is better
[29:53] than a large meal when there's where
[29:55] there's contention
[30:00] here the scripture says serve the lord
[30:02] with gladness
[30:17] when we come here to the house of the
[30:18] lord we come to have fellowship with god
[30:47] with thanksgiving
[31:03] in recognition
[31:06] you know how the majority comes in
[31:10] maybe because of lack of teaching
[31:15] let's give the example that this is the
[31:17] door
[31:21] and the service is about to start
[31:25] i come inside i sit down
[31:44] raise our
[32:53] i go into the bedroom and just kick back
[32:55] and sleep
[32:57] since he was a policeman i think he'll
[33:00] follow me with a shotgun
[33:03] you didn't even say hi
[33:06] you didn't say here i am
[33:23] called the house of prayer the doors
[33:26] open
[33:27] come inside come to the altar
[33:31] lord i give you thanks because i did not
[33:35] form myself
[34:59] yes sir
[35:00] [Music]
[35:08] we have enough to fill a lot of gallons
[35:10] of lemonade
[35:13] could you give someone lemonade
[35:25] it seems like they're bringing us in
[35:27] with the broom
[35:56] heaven
[36:22] i was the pastor of a church dania ekomo
[36:26] [Music]
[36:33] but those brothers knew how to praise
[36:35] the lord
[36:37] after six months in hermana there was
[36:40] about a hundred brethren
[36:43] when we'd start the service the altar
[36:46] would be full here the souls would come
[36:49] forward
[37:20] went
[37:33] why did he go
[37:48] when he left
[38:01] and the altar would get full
[38:14] hallelujah hallelujah
[38:41] [Music]
[38:43] forgive me brother
[38:58] the wine was given to me by god
[39:02] i came into the tabernacle before the
[39:04] service started
[39:06] i came to the altar
[39:10] since i usually don't come to the prayer
[39:25] i began to raise my hands to
[40:02] [Music]
[40:22] jesus christ
[40:27] we have an order in the church
[40:30] but when god takes hold we should know
[40:35] it's time
[40:39] [Music]
[41:04] i have the mind
[41:16] what am i going to repay him with
[41:31] the car cost him
[42:14] is
[43:38] jesus christ came before the father
[43:43] and he said how much does navarro owe
[43:45] you

[43:51] china
[44:06] even though they gave him a hundred
[44:08] dollars a pound for the chinese he still
[44:10] couldn't pay it
[44:11] because he said jesus christ says
[44:18] wipe it clean and give this over here
[44:47] the poor brother says
[45:02] 24 hours i owe
[45:06] the carpet
[45:09] i owe the car that they took away from
[45:10] me five years ago
