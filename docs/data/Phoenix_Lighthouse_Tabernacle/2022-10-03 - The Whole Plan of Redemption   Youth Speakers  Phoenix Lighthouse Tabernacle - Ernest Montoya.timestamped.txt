[29:33] your conscience from dead Works to serve
[29:35] the Living God is
[29:47] uh
[29:53] um
[29:55] first before I begin I want to thank my
[29:57] pastor for giving us the opportunity to
[30:00] speak before you and this is
[30:11] um
[30:12] um
[30:13] well don't don't get me wrong it's an
[30:15] it's an honor to to speak with you about
[30:18] the Lord about the word of the Lord is
[30:24] let's just say I try my best not to be
[30:27] called up
[30:31] and as you can say I'm not doing a good
[30:34] job about it
[30:38] um Carlos and the others have a special
[30:41] talent of finding those who are hiding
[30:48] I'm sorry I'm heading off topic here
[30:52] they wanted us to speak about the topic
[30:54] of redemption
[30:58] and speaking honestly
[31:02] I do not have any new material to share
[31:05] with you
[31:09] and the brothers before me had have done
[31:12] a marvelous job at covering the topic of
[31:14] redemption is
[31:21] also I'm
[31:24] I don't have much experience in in
[31:26] Redemption
[31:28] experience
[31:30] the trials that I've that I've faced
[31:34] are pale in comparison of what most
[31:37] people most people here have experience
[31:45] um
[31:45] that and
[31:47] also I still have my bad habits
[31:52] and I'm not where I should be
[31:57] um on that note
[31:58] I'm gonna try to talk about something
[32:01] that uh
[32:02] that I've heard from previous sermons
[32:08] um but that's that stood out to me
[32:16] [Music]
[32:17] um
[32:18] there was
[32:20] um one brother who I don't remember uh
[32:23] his name
[32:26] um he he talked about the significance
[32:29] of an eagle
[32:34] um now here in the U.S the eagle is a
[32:37] symbol of freedom and of strength yeah
[32:45] but to us as Christians we have a a
[32:48] different deeper meaning for it
[32:56] um
[32:58] according to research
[33:02] the eagle has two stages in its life
[33:08] the stage where it goes from being a
[33:11] hatchling to an adult
[33:15] and
[33:17] the stage of its rebirth
[33:24] um the the now the eagle is a brilliant
[33:27] Hunter when
[33:30] um
[33:32] one of the greatest in in the animal
[33:34] kingdom
[33:36] animal
[33:37] so great that they can see fish swimming
[33:42] in streams of rivers
[33:45] in Los Rios from a couple of miles from
[33:49] the sky
[33:53] um but as great as it is
[33:57] um like all material things
[34:01] they begin to age
[34:04] and lose their strengths
[34:08] um
[34:10] over time the the
[34:13] the feathers of the of the Eagles start
[34:16] to
[34:17] shrivel up and become rotten yeah
[34:25] their talents become dull and old
[34:30] through stalones viejos
[34:34] the
[34:36] and the beak becomes it grows too large
[34:40] and it becomes too heavy for
[34:42] foreign
[35:04] whether it should stay where it is
[35:10] where it has all the the rotten feathers
[35:13] the heavy beak and the dull Talent
[35:17] lascaras
[35:24] or you can change it
[35:28] um
[35:32] I'm sorry I'm still reading my notes
[35:38] um mind this that if it stays where it
[35:41] is then it will it will surely die
[35:49] um
[35:50] starvation
[35:52] then by another Hunter
[35:57] um
[36:00] so when it if it decides to change
[36:01] itself
[36:04] what they will do is they will pluck
[36:08] each feather from their from their wings
[36:10] and from their body is
[36:16] um
[36:16] and they'll rip the talent off of their
[36:20] feet
[36:26] and using a rock from a part of a
[36:30] mountain they will break their their
[36:34] beakoff is
[36:42] um and yes this is very painful for the
[36:45] eagle yes
[36:52] they do this because they know they have
[36:54] to yeah
[36:58] um
[36:59] it's either this or death
[37:03] um
[37:04] so as time passes
[37:09] [Music]
[37:10] those feathers start to regrow back
[37:13] that's Plumas
[37:15] the talents become sharp again
[37:19] and their beak regrows stronger than
[37:23] before
[37:27] uh once the transformation is complete
[37:32] they live for another 10 years
[37:39] uh brother Brown refers talks about this
[37:42] magnificent creature
[37:46] magnifico uh and he Compares it to us
[37:49] because
[37:51] [Music]
[37:55] it the eagle is not just a symbol for
[37:58] freedom and strength
[38:02] but it's a symbol of the Redeemer
[38:09] thank you
[38:11] we ourselves are eagles
[38:14] and we get to choose
[38:18] whether we stay with her with our bad
[38:22] habits
[38:26] or change stuff suffer a little bit
[38:32] so that we can be rebuilt into something
[38:34] stronger
[38:40] and that's all I have right now so I'm
[38:43] going to pass it to my brother is
[38:47] so uh thank you for listening and God
[38:50] bless you guys
[38:52] [Applause]
[39:18] can you hear me
[39:27] um
[39:32] it's an honor and privilege to be with
[39:34] you with this beautiful morning
[39:38] normally I find myself in the audio
[39:40] department
[39:44] and me as somebody who doesn't have much
[39:47] experience
[39:52] to other preachers
[39:55] obedient
[40:07] before going forward too much
[40:11] I'm going to continue with the same
[40:13] topic
[40:14] which is the Plan of Redemption
[40:21] but before going too much forward
[40:25] [Music]
[40:27] I'm going to talk about a small
[40:29] conversation I had about this theme this
[40:31] topic
[40:33] me being young
[40:39] we can say that I perhaps not have too
[40:42] much experience in many things
[40:47] I have to be those who are around me
[40:50] to be able to ask about things that I
[40:52] don't know about
[40:54] and more so things of the message
[40:59] and I asked my father or brother asked
[41:02] my father
[41:03] I asked them advice
[41:06] for the things I don't understand
[41:10] it's also a very easy way to commit a
[41:13] easy way of communication because
[41:16] know he's very blunt with me well no
[41:19] well now it says
[41:23] once we're talking about the Plan of
[41:25] Redemption that topic
[41:28] can't you make it shorter
[41:30] conversations
[41:36] the end of the topic uh the end of the
[41:38] conversation was that Redemption means
[41:40] eternity
[42:03] in which time does not exist
[42:09] foreign
[42:15] no Everlasting oh Everlasting thank you
[42:19] significance
[42:24] we know the Redemption the word
[42:26] Redemption means to receive something or
[42:27] restore something in exchange for a
[42:29] payment
[42:30] so where is the similarity significa
[42:42] is to buy something or purchase
[42:44] something with a Pavement
[42:50] we can first look at the definition of
[42:52] redemptions
[42:54] in The Prince and the main scripture of
[42:57] this theme
[42:58] I'll just be mentioning it
[43:00] the verses that we already read in
[43:04] Hebrews 9 11.
[43:07] it's not by the blood of goats or bulls
[43:21] Eternal Redemption
[43:30] that is for us
[43:34] ke Los Angeles
[43:37] this is that the blood of our Lord Jesus
[43:39] Christ
[43:42] was the only form of payment that could
[43:44] cover our sins
[43:52] so that we can relate both words
[44:00] because
[44:07] it's for Humanity
[44:11] or bring us back to
[44:14] Eternity
[44:17] we have learned or they have taught us
[44:23] that God wants to have fellowship with
[44:25] his people
[44:27] and
[44:29] and yeah and he provided a way for us to
[44:32] get there with him
[44:35] Christ once again took possession of us
[44:40] and that's where we saw the Final
[44:41] Redemption in action
[44:44] I believe
[44:47] that it's something that should make us
[44:49] feel really good I feel good
[44:52] knowing that I have that is and all I
[44:56] have to do is accept it
[45:02] and his Redemption is eternal location
[45:06] and what it means for us
[45:09] that what's going to happen oh what
[45:12] happened
[45:16] it's not going to change that Redemption
[45:20] because we learned that eternity is
[45:22] forever
[45:24] and God it is
[45:27] the same yesterday today
[45:33] so it seems that his word is the same
[45:36] his word is for us it's our guide yeah
[45:42] rely on that or base ourselves on that
[45:44] and with that is
[45:54] in the Plan of Redemption is
[46:00] when you get the baptism of the Holy
[46:03] Spirit
[46:05] that's the earnest of your salvation is
[46:08] that right
[46:10] in other words it's a down payment is
[46:16] the down payment
[46:20] what will it do when we get the full
[46:22] benefit
[46:23] it'll be glorious isn't it
[46:28] I like how brother Brandon mentioned
[46:30] that in the end
[46:34] he didn't say how glorious
[46:37] he doesn't explain it
[46:41] because
[46:52] businesses than the down payment
[46:55] how the down payment makes us feel yeah
[46:59] but how we feel when we receive
[47:01] everything
[47:02] and that is what we're waiting on
[47:06] the thing is
[47:15] you have that guide to reach that end
[47:26] is our goal in the Plan of Redemption
[47:30] I also like
[47:34] our brother Paul said in a couple weeks
[47:36] ago
[47:39] he says that we all we all are part in
[47:42] this planet Redemption
[47:44] it doesn't matter if it's a big purpose
[47:46] or a small purpose
[47:48] we have to accept that plan
[47:53] and let God do his work
[47:57] what belongs to God
[48:05] as accepting that sacrifice
[48:10] or and to live for him yes
[48:15] that's something that sounds very easy
[48:17] right
[48:20] questions we know that it can be very
[48:22] difficult
[48:24] but thank God for this Plan of
[48:27] Redemption this
[48:30] eternal Redemption
[48:33] that covers Us
[48:35] for
[48:37] what the Lord Jesus Christ did for us
[48:43] also says
[48:45] no you don't have to do one thing
[48:49] it's by Grace you're saved this see
[48:53] not nothing that you do no I'm not
[48:56] there isn't one thing you could do
[48:59] another that would amount to anything
[49:03] the plant's already made
[49:06] Redemption is already paid for it
[49:10] the only thing you have to do is accept
[49:12] it
[49:14] foreign
[49:37] to reach our destination
[49:41] that's what we have
[49:47] it depends on us if we want to reach
[49:50] eternity through the Plan of Redemption
[49:55] thank you for your attention Brothers
[49:57] may God bless you
[49:59] [Applause]
[50:05] Hermanos God bless you Brothers
[50:09] in the name of Lord Jesus Christ
[50:13] first I'd like to thank my pastor yeah
[50:17] in the Lord Jesus Christ for this
[50:19] opportunity
[50:20] to be here in front of you
[50:23] he
[50:32] is
[50:32] I was thinking Brothers
[50:37] looking over my notes
[50:41] and everything that God was placing in
[50:43] my heart
[50:45] and I got the thought
[50:47] is
[50:51] maybe with everything you're going to
[50:52] say you're going to be throwing a couple
[50:53] of rocks a couple of stones
[50:55] foreign
[51:22] to be able to survive
[51:31] the spirit requires of certain things
[51:34] no
[51:38] Muerte spiritual a spiritual death
[51:41] is
[51:46] when we need what is from God
[51:50] we don't receive that what we need from
[51:53] God
[51:54] our spirit little by little
[51:57] it begins to die
[51:59] it begins to lose nutrients it becomes
[52:03] weaker man amen
[52:12] sometimes we forget to
[52:15] prayer is so important brothers
[52:18] and when we don't pray
[52:22] it's as if we're telling God
[52:24] that we don't need him
[52:28] that we don't need to have that
[52:29] relationship with him
[52:31] we can do it by ourselves Hermanos the
[52:35] brothers we all know
[52:38] that's more that's more than clear that
[52:41] without God we are nothing
[52:43] and so many things going on in the world
[52:47] these days
[52:52] I was listening to a small story in
[52:55] school
[52:57] or of school
[53:00] more so the um
[53:04] a teacher talking with a student about
[53:06] the things of God
[53:09] in this discussion is reality
[53:21] the teacher was telling the student how
[53:24] can you prove to me that God is real if
[53:25] we've already proved Evolution and these
[53:27] other things
[53:30] he said that if you can't see God
[53:33] if you can't touch God
[53:35] how can he exist
[53:39] and the student was left thinking
[53:42] and he said a couple things in the end
[53:45] and he told the professor
[54:00] it's
[54:05] what we believe in amen amen
[54:11] although on the Diablo ignore Uno when
[54:14] the devil ignores one is
[54:17] that's when you should be worried
[54:24] when everything is done
[54:27] it's when you already cleaned your home
[54:30] you already did everything you had to do
[54:33] that's when you relax
[54:36] well the devil is doing the same
[54:40] we already did his job to depart you
[54:43] from the things of God
[54:47] he already has you in the mud
[54:52] what else are you going to do is what
[54:54] he's thinking
[54:55] so then he moves on to another person
[54:58] and he starts once again
[55:01] that's why it's so important
[55:05] they have the correct mental attitude
[55:09] to be able to understand how God works
[55:12] and amen
[55:21] it's important to know that in dreams
[55:25] we need to have goals we need to have
[55:28] plans
[55:33] it just becomes to a disappointment
[55:38] you'll never reach that dream
[55:43] on the path to fulfill your dreams make
[55:45] him a reality
[56:01] because in the dream if you're not
[56:03] engaged or you're not a tied up or bound
[56:10] you'll never start it is
[56:16] then you'll never finish it amen
[56:19] Brothers
[56:22] he
[56:24] um
[56:25] many times doubt reaches muchas
[56:30] at the Devil places in our mind or in
[56:32] our heads
[56:35] um
[56:40] why this or why the other or why not
[56:43] I'm a son or daughter of God
[56:47] and the questions go on and on and on
[57:03] on the seals
[57:05] is
[57:13] Jesus came to be a witness as a savior
[57:16] of the world correct though is that
[57:18] right
[57:30] they never
[57:34] got to know anything about the Lord
[57:36] Jesus Christ
[57:41] they went right on just like the world
[57:43] know nothing about it
[57:45] but all the time what was going on in
[57:48] the world then see
[57:51] why didn't he let them know El Vino he
[57:54] came he loses
[58:01] were the ones that received him
[58:06] there had been no good to say anything
[58:08] to the rest of them
[58:12] because he could not have redeemed them
[58:16] because they wasn't even redeemable
[58:21] I hear this Brothers
[58:23] it's something very great
[58:25] is it the word of God
[58:28] has reached your life is
[58:30] because you are redeemable
[58:53] because it is for you brother amen amen
[58:58] glory to God
[59:03] you know what's dangerous for the devil
[59:10] [Music]
[59:19] opinions don't matter anymore
[59:23] they just reassure you of what you
[59:25] already knew
[59:29] s
[59:31] and if I know that God
[59:34] if I know what God says of me
[59:39] why am I going to leave what God says
[59:42] about me
[59:44] why am I going to believe what somebody
[59:46] else says
[1:00:10] if we already know the truth
[1:00:13] isn't another truth
[1:00:19] this is
[1:00:20] the person who's in jail
[1:00:23] even to the person who's been high in
[1:00:25] the puppet
[1:00:27] we all need more from Christ
[1:00:36] it's not just something that's more on
[1:00:39] our lives
[1:00:40] it is
[1:00:48] to take complete control amen amen
[1:00:53] it's going to be like oil and water
[1:00:57] they can't mix you're going to be
[1:01:00] fighting amen amen
[1:01:06] okay
[1:01:08] answers
[1:01:11] uh
[1:01:16] is
[1:01:19] a small scripture we have here it's very
[1:01:22] simple but it's very important
[1:01:24] is a no all about second Mateo
[1:01:30] Matthew chapter 7 verse 21.
[1:01:34] I'm going to read it quickly you don't
[1:01:36] have to look for it
[1:01:43] not everyone that says unto me Lord Lord
[1:01:46] shall enter into the kingdom of heaven
[1:01:50] but he that doeth the will of my father
[1:01:53] is which is in heaven
[1:01:56] foreign
[1:02:03] Lord Lord
[1:02:06] have we not prophesied in thy name
[1:02:09] is and in thy name have cast out Devils
[1:02:13] muchos
[1:02:17] many wonderful works
[1:02:21] and then I will profess unto them
[1:02:25] I never knew you
[1:02:27] depart from me I said
[1:02:33] how sad that day would be
[1:02:37] hear those words
[1:02:40] it would be something so sad
[1:02:46] something we focus on
[1:02:50] is I said
[1:02:53] let's try to impress God
[1:02:56] doesn't want that
[1:03:00] he wants a relationship with you
[1:03:03] he doesn't want you to try to impress
[1:03:05] him
[1:03:07] he doesn't want to see how good you can
[1:03:09] be
[1:03:11] he wants to get to know you more
[1:03:13] you can get to know him man Hermanos
[1:03:16] amen Brothers
[1:03:22] did not die for us just to make a
[1:03:25] religion but to make a relationship
[1:03:31] correct sometimes we have that wrong
[1:03:33] mental attitude
[1:03:36] um
[1:03:44] we give ourselves completely to God
[1:03:49] we can avoid so many problems
[1:03:58] God bless you Brothers
[1:04:02] just a little bit more and I'll be
[1:04:04] closing
[1:04:06] is
[1:04:08] when we focus on that scripture in
[1:04:10] Matthew
[1:04:11] the problem is
[1:04:15] that we didn't know ourselves
[1:04:20] we didn't get to know each other on the
[1:04:23] time we were here on Earth
[1:04:25] you just wanted to impress God oh
[1:04:37] I wanted to speak with you yeah
[1:04:42] I want to see how much you love me
[1:04:48] um
[1:04:57] we're not at God's level
[1:05:01] God wants to show us something here on
[1:05:03] the table
[1:05:05] we're sitting on the floor
[1:05:09] we can't see what God is doing
[1:05:12] we had to lift ourselves up
[1:05:16] this is
[1:05:22] God has foreign
[1:06:06] everything goes by fast
[1:06:21] it's more than we can count
[1:06:24] we can please stand
[1:06:29] thank you very much for your attention
[1:06:32] is
[1:06:38] it's something very important Brothers

[1:09:21] sometimes we want to find the mystery in
[1:09:23] the Bible
[1:09:28] it's in discipline consistency it's
[1:09:31] inconsistency it's in obedience
[1:09:37] if we apply that
[1:09:40] the dimension of time
[1:09:43] the Revelation welcome
[1:09:46] the planet Redemption is
[1:09:55] God has control of all things
