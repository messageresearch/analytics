reads the following the Apostle Paul speaking to the church in colossia a gentile church this is the Apostle Paul says like this speaking to the Colossians who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake which is the church ministro foreign Minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God El Mysterio [Music] manifestado even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints foreign of his mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory let us pray brethren one of those kind Heavenly Father you know full of grace and mercy we come this morning before your presence is asking father

you The Plan of Redemption is it's a very vast subject but this morning I'd like to focus it is verse 26 read Colossians 1 26 where it reads Mysterio even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from Generations at all foreign the mystery which had been here from ages and from Generations Prophet says the following nothing in Instagram notice God had a threefold purpose in this great mystery secretly had a threefold purpose Mysterio in his great mystery secrets God has gracious mystery he had before the World began he has got a threefold purpose in it now we read carefully before God began to create the world God had a three-fold purpose creation had not yet began and him had a plan that he wanted to develop purpose and it says the following is now if he had this threefold purpose we want to find out what is this threefold purpose this is the first was that God wanted to reveal himself to the people number one yours want to reveal himself to this people Segundo secondly to have the preeminence in his body of believers here he specifies that is his bride that he might live in people here is so much the body of believers personas that is his bride that he might live in people third restaurant to restore the kingdom to its rightly positioned by the first Adam is back to where you walk in the cool of the evening with his people talk with them fellowship with them here the prophet gives us the three things that God wanted to do and this is throughout the entire Bible yeah foreign he is the almighty God omnipresent God is Prophet says what does that mean s that God is present in all places and what makes God omnipresent because God is omniscient foreign foreign who thinks he's doing Royal foreign he brought foreign eternal life foreign is enjoy foreign foreign foreign God if we could say it like this Journey generation after Generations but they began to boast themselves in other words they let their guard down they let their guard down please they're the only people and they are they are the only people good luck or part with God like the spoils surrender them yes la vida foreign foreign foreign any evidence when they therefore will come together they asked him saying lord well thou at this time restore again the Kingdom of Israel the one at the Kingdom be restored it doesn't uh it won't be with you doesn't correspondence Luke 17 20. he demanded of the Pharisees and he was demanded of the Pharisees foreign [Music] eternal life because of what the word says and because they who they thought with this brother scriptures I want you to understand very simple the story of Ruth me Naomi yeah they were a Jewish couple not me Naomi is a type of the church he had everything when they were in their lands with eternal life he was foreign foreign foreign he made known unto the mystery as I wrote a foreign few words he may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ in other ages as it is Holy Apostles and Prophets by the spirit Jesus by the gospel Minister foreign given unto me into the sexual power of us working and to me who I am less at least of All Saints among the Gentiles and searchable Riches of Christ foreign all type kinds those were the Gentiles idolaters they were lost considered as dogs the mystery of God told them there's a gentle people hear my word like Ruth yeah which is the Gentile bro at first fulfill this way foreign or we know we shouldn't do something and we do it my heart was up and down my thoughts were going to the left and right because we fail to understand there is no time we either come in or brother we're going to be left behind one or the other I cannot stand I cannot sin unless I leave the word and I'm not saying this though I'm gonna leave my Bible and go sin that's not it leaving the words change the truth we're living the life that we received from the prophet messenger we are leaving the light that's the word so let me ask you this morning can you sin can you sin please and I can tell you right now what's going through our mind is this foreign and everything is okay with us we're either going to be ready that bride is either ready that's the word of God are you either wise
