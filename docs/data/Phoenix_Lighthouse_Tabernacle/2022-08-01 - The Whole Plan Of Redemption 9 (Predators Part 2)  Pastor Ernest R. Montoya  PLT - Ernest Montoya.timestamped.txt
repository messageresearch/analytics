[33:50] god bless you
[33:55] it's good to be in the house of the lord
[34:00] just looking at individuals and
[34:03] thinking everything i have to do and say
[34:12] [Music]
[34:20] be inspired by the word of god
[34:24] we're happy today
[34:26] um
[34:27] one of the things that i do understand
[34:30] is that there's many many people that
[34:32] are feeling ill
[34:36] both spiritually spiritual
[34:39] and physically efficient
[34:41] it's
[34:42] no
[34:44] no burden
[34:46] noskarga
[34:48] that we see people going to hospitals
[34:50] because of what's going on
[34:52] worldwide
[34:56] we came back from
[34:59] peru
[35:06] still do not believe
[35:09] that there's a pandemic
[35:12] government in peru
[35:42] so peru is doing uh
[35:44] some good peru
[35:46] to avoid
[35:48] uh an outbreak of the pandemic again
[35:52] if you didn't know
[35:54] that i like to travel
[35:56] california california
[35:58] they were going to pass
[36:01] a law you want to pass an alley
[36:03] [Music]
[36:05] you need to wear masks again
[36:10] somehow for whatever reason
[36:12] it was defeated
[36:15] but californians
[36:17] relax
[36:19] with this pandemic
[36:22] they believe
[36:24] christians believe those christians
[36:26] not only message believers but i'm
[36:28] saying in general christians believe
[36:35] that god
[36:36] protector and i can say amen
[37:04] so with that i want to start this this
[37:07] message
[37:09] finished today i know that for a fact i
[37:11] have too many notes
[37:15] but what i have noticed
[37:19] is i'm trying to give the ministry here
[37:22] time to
[37:23] preach the gospel
[37:27] there are some individuals that
[37:29] i haven't been able to put behind the
[37:32] pulpit the person
[37:47] just like individuals
[38:02] everybody has to be ready
[38:08] and the world is going to go by us
[38:13] i can feed myself
[38:17] so i need the ministry to make sure that
[38:20] they're always constantly
[38:23] hearing the messages
[38:30] so that when it's their
[38:32] turn to come up
[38:36] they're not going to get nervous
[38:39] the first thing we forget is the order
[38:42] of the order of this church
[38:46] and i try to
[38:47] establish that wherever i go
[38:51] i talk to a pastor the first thing i say
[38:54] the pastors
[39:47] [Music]
[40:03] we always have to remember we put more
[40:05] time to the message the word of god
[40:07] rather than singing
[40:21] by now you should have it memorized
[40:25] hebrews 9 11.
[40:31] the whole plan of redemption
[40:34] a hidden predator
[41:04] 11
[41:18] but christ being come and high priests
[41:20] of good things to come
[41:23] by a greater and more perfect tabernacle
[41:26] not made with hands that is to say not
[41:28] of this building
[41:32] is
[41:42] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[41:46] but by his own blood he entered in once
[41:48] the holy place
[41:50] having obtained eternal redemption for
[41:52] us
[42:11] or if the blood of bulls and goats and
[42:13] the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the
[42:16] unclean
[42:17] sanctifieth to the purifying of the
[42:19] flesh
[42:25] significantly
[42:30] how much more shall the blood of christ
[42:32] who through the eternal spirit offered
[42:34] himself without spot to god
[42:37] purge your conscience from dead works to
[42:39] serve a living god
[42:51] heavenly father we're grateful this
[42:52] morning
[42:55] for our blessings
[43:25] the bible says
[43:28] he purged our conscience from dead works
[43:31] to serve a living god
[43:37] in other words
[43:50] so my questions
[43:51] turned out a little different
[44:07] god should be with you
[44:12] if he's not
[44:14] then we need to talk
[44:18] how many of us have been anointed by a
[44:20] spirit raise your hand
[44:25] i mean there's good spirits
[44:29] and then there's spirits that you don't
[44:31] want
[44:32] around you yes
[44:49] don't raise your hand how many of you
[44:51] have been around a person
[44:55] with an unclean spirit
[45:00] yeah don't raise your hand
[45:03] want you to remember one thing
[45:05] many people
[45:07] that have unclean spirits
[45:10] that they've relaxed so much
[45:14] they want to stay that way
[45:16] they don't want to
[45:19] now the church of the living god like
[45:21] let's say those people
[45:22] has to be born again
[45:24] in other words it's an individual affair
[45:28] again
[45:29] but the church itself has to be born
[45:33] again
[45:34] we need to be born again
[45:37] hardest thing to do and convince a
[45:39] person
[45:43] as a church
[45:58] because you're anchored
[46:00] in god's
[46:02] word
[46:06] how many of us
[46:08] want to overcome and follow christ
[46:11] don't we all want us
[46:25] if it's not peace in my mind
[46:28] peace in my heart
[46:30] peace in my home
[46:32] he said my work
[46:34] there's something wrong
[46:37] and i've got to overcome that
[46:39] i'm going to use myself as an example
[46:43] this way i'm
[46:44] no one can say he was pointing at me or
[46:47] is saying it to me
[46:50] for me
[46:51] i gotta let you know
[46:54] that there's some individuals
[46:57] whatever purpose
[47:02] and justification
[47:04] i can't go any further
[47:08] they won't
[47:23] they just haven't found their home
[47:25] they're not in contrast
[47:37] how do we resist evil
[47:41] if i want to
[47:43] overcome a spirit
[47:45] how do i resist it
[47:48] i gotta find
[47:49] in the message
[48:04] if i'm a junkie
[48:09] should i be hanging around
[48:11] with that group
[48:14] should i hang around with that group
[48:18] if you want to overcome
[48:21] that spirit
[48:22] you gotta resist
[48:24] those individuals
[48:27] you gotta stay away from them
[48:32] i gotta stay away from those cigarettes
[48:36] so the individuals that'll give me a
[48:38] cigarette
[48:43] because the more i hang around with
[48:45] people that's
[48:55] i'm going to be anointed sooner or later
[49:00] temperance
[49:02] and it just starts
[49:05] temple a simple thing
[49:09] it's an act
[49:15] we start acting differently
[49:18] you don't have that desire anymore
[49:24] because something happened
[49:26] well then i
[49:27] speak to pastors wherever i go

[1:06:29] this person that i had
[1:06:45] drops and he started running
[1:06:48] and i said this is not happening to me
[1:06:54] so i went like this we have see

[1:06:57] it is
[1:07:12] it was a predator
[1:07:34] 1978

[1:09:58] when he prayed everything

[1:10:13] i needed it
[1:10:28] he
[1:10:46] this is where brothers live
[1:10:50] in africa in africa
[1:10:52] start taking pictures
[1:10:55] and they started talking about me
[1:11:10] maybe you're a teenager you live with
[1:11:12] your parents
[1:11:14] how would you like to live in a home
[1:11:15] like this
[1:11:21] if you're renting if you're in an
[1:11:22] apartment
[1:11:23] would you like to have a home
[1:11:39] was there
[1:11:42] her son
[1:11:44] was sick
[1:11:46] with syphilis
[1:11:49] and the first thing brother branham
[1:11:51] looks at the floor
[1:11:52] i'm sorry
[1:12:07] and he knew it was a christian home
[1:12:10] christian
[1:12:12] if brother brennan was here
[1:12:17] brother branham was here
[1:12:21] who would you want
[1:12:22] to pray for you
[1:12:25] this person is a persona
[1:12:27] or this person
[1:12:29] who would you take a queen tomorrow
[1:12:32] would you take him out
[1:12:48] i
[1:13:11] because he knew she was a genuine
[1:13:13] christian
[1:13:19] i'm just letting you know
[1:13:21] the bible says
[1:13:24] they'll lay hands on the sec
[1:14:11] and
[1:14:12] i
[1:14:12] love the quotes that i have
[1:14:16] because it's like
[1:14:19] this happened to me
[1:14:22] and brother branham said the following
[1:14:46] he goes
[1:14:53] overcome means concerning
[1:15:08] i've even brought a bag full of his
[1:15:10] tricks
[1:15:13] but brother branham goes on yeah
[1:15:16] and he says
[1:15:18] a lot of people think
[1:15:19] that there's no devil
[1:15:22] diablo
[1:15:36] brother branham goes on
[1:15:39] there's a real devil
[1:15:41] he's just as real as you are yes
[1:15:47] anybody
[1:15:49] a real devil
[1:16:23] who's been born again
[1:16:36] then
[1:16:41] then to overcome and you must recognize
[1:16:45] that the god in you is greater and
[1:16:48] mightier
[1:16:49] let me say it again
[1:16:51] i'm born again
[1:16:53] god is in me do you understand me
[1:16:55] and he's greater
[1:16:57] mightier
[1:16:58] than the devil
[1:16:59] and where is
[1:17:12] foreign
[1:17:17] one that
[1:17:18] it's in you that has already overcome
[1:17:21] him
[1:17:23] one that's in you el castano
[1:17:26] has already overcome him
[1:18:38] malignant i tell lies
[1:18:43] and then
[1:18:45] i think
[1:18:47] that i can walk the devil
[1:18:49] you're wrong
[1:18:52] you can't whip
[1:18:53] no the point he's gonna get you
[1:18:55] said
[1:18:58] again
[1:19:00] once we recognize
[1:19:03] that it's the devil diablo and we
[1:19:05] recognize what
[1:19:20] you just gotta believe it
[1:19:23] you gotta believe it but you don't need
[1:19:25] that stuff anymore
[1:19:27] yeah
[1:19:28] can you say man
[1:19:32] this is what brother branham said he
