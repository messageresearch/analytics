me take your seats brothers first of all i want to thank god your pastor morning great great so we're going to talk a little bit of on the christmas uh what it means to us and um i hope you uh are helped with these words uh so when we talk about christmas uh christmas is a time where the family gets together where we get to see people that we haven't seen in a long time we see people traveling from one side of the country to the other quest and as i started looking into it i've heard a lot of times that people uh and people in general everywhere in the world becomes it changes their attitude a little bit around this time their attitude is a little bit more positive they're a little nicer when you speak with other people so i did a little research and one of the reasons is because people are expecting other guests they haven't seen in a long time so they're excited but there's another reason as well and it's the spiritual connection there was a little research i read that it said that one of the main reasons why people are happier on christmas days because their their spiritual connection is stronger with their religion or what they believe we know that the lord jesus christ we we celebrate uh christmas uh celebrates the birth of jesus christ even though we know it wasn't exactly in december so but holidays can also bring uh sadness to a person sometimes these holidays bring our unrealistic expectations we believe a holiday is going to change our our and some people will because they don't have the ability to get with their family or so again and the people get depressed that doesn't mean brothers the the lord jesus christ is not there for you he's still there and he's been he's worthy of praise man i was reading a little bit of what brother branham was teaching on christmas and today that memorial of his birthday is what do they do gassing they get some trees cut it down make a christmas tree for the kids but they think that that's all right i'm not i'm not kicking against it but here's the big butt perro the thing is it is they put more on the christmas tree than they do on christ chris kringle all over the country chris cringo esta porto del pais who is he a german a catholic saint years ago and old man went about doing good and today it becomes almost a worship as to push christ aside the real fundamentals of christ fundamentals of christmas man as i look in my life and that's something i want to change yes if i can at least that day talk about him 30 minutes an hour at least say what i'm thankful for that would be a good direction to start with i've heard stories like parents doing uh things for the children like i've heard parents say that they're they have a little elf in their house and it's supposed to be like watching their children seeing what they're doing good or bad and they say they have to wake up early in the morning so they can move the elf to different parts of the house and so the kids don't find out they moved because the parents tell the kids that that elf is watching what they do so if they're good santa will give them a good guess so that's that's where you see how important you can influence your children and that's why it's so important to tell them the truth right right out of the gate yes today's world santa claus want to take the place of the lord jesus christ we see it in in uh out in the streets uh in the television the stores um you you rarely see that uh christmas decoration of the lord jesus christ being being born now you used to see them sometimes in some houses at churches but um i haven't seen it in a while in decorations another part where brother branham speaks about this uh is the message divine healing um and i read now the christmas is not a protestant holiday festival it's a catholic day catholic the 25th of december months and months before or after before our lord was born our lord was born in april but he wasn't born in december if you've been in judo in december in december it's colder than this so you know he wasn't born in december he spelled it it's uh it's christmas not be that so when i was uh looking into these words when he like stretched out the word and uh emphasized in christmas so i started doing a little like looking for definitions and um when we first hear the word christmas we we break it up in in two words large number of people or a crowd together personas so when you put it all together and connect it it means that christmas is supposed to be a group of people filled with the holy spirit that are praising the lord let's use the holy spirit we have brothers to help our own families to help and let's not forget the important things let's praise the lord every day like if it was a christmas yes amen amen god bless you brothers it's just a few words i wanted to share with you amen god bless you elizabeth can you guys hear me all right let's get a moment here so like a brother was talking about he's talking about christmas i'd like to continue on and he touched on the point that i i figured he was going to touch on is that we know that our lord was not born in the month of december and i was reading a letter by uh that they wrote for the voice of for brother brandon for voice of god recordings is we know the month of december that our lord was not born and that's the way i was looking at it was giving me a perspective it's not the day of his birth but we can't miss the opportunity to see it as another day to celebrate hispanics and one of the things i wanted to talk about was gifts yes gifts could be both could be a talent and it could be something physical that you give us and what did christmas mean to me because before i moved to phoenix or cantos phoenix it's time for christmas i always came to phoenix when christmas came around i was going to go to phoenix i was going to see my uncles and i feel like as you get older you kind of stop focusing so much on the gifts you start appreciating more the the act of getting together and spending time with family family and getting to see your brother and sister in christ and so i was listening to a message earlier my brother bannon brandon and it's called god's wrapped gift he said he talks about how the gift we received was our lord jesus christ when he became flesh that was god's gift to us and that's the best gift we could ever receive thinking what other gifts have i received home is where the wi-fi connects automatically to your phone is brother bannon talks more about this gift and it's really interesting that he called it god's wrapped gift [Music] because he said that jesus was the wrapped gift god gave people this gift but people didn't want to open it they didn't want to accept it so i thought how would i feel and he says that's what happened we were given a gift many of us don't want to open it we don't want to see what's inside and that's what that's where i think about gifts and when we're giving gifts yes when jesus went to to the gathering with the pharisees and everybody was there that when that when she saw him that she couldn't stand to see him there sitting alone he talks about how when you went to these parties of these uh celebrations you're walking around he said in these type of sandals and so the first thing they would do is wash your feet they would greet you they would grab you and brother she felt compelled to do something about it brother describes this as as she see seeing this gift see in him like he's a present he wants to do with something with it so we know the story she goes over when she spend her money on the finest oils she washed his feet and that's when god god said that he forgave well that's when jesus said that all her sins had been forgiven and that's what i'm saying this morning how many of us want to open that gift i know there's a lot of physical gifts and we want to open them but sometimes we have other gifts how many gifts have i gotten that i've been too afraid to open it or maybe i haven't wanted to open them so i had to reflect on myself maybe you're thinking the same thing maybe you you've been given this gift of health but you you haven't opened it yet i don't know what reason but you just haven't open maybe something's holding you back in that way because maybe you've been giving a certain talent a certain gift he says but you're too afraid to use it you're too afraid to open it i feel like we have a lot of very uh very um capable youth capacity to let you know that if you feel like you have something in you don't be afraid to open it and use it for for it to uplift this name the idea of a gift and so i started thinking what other gifts do we receive many of us receive the gift of the holy ghost so i was thinking when did i receive this and i remembered that acts 238 which is the one we hear each time when when you want to get when you get baptized it says you get baptized for everyone in the name of jesus christ for the remissions of sins it says the gift of the holy ghost so in itself that's another gift that we received that's another gift i received so i'm constantly receiving these gifts and it's not even christmas time but my point here was to for you to reflect and think about all the if you receive any gifts this christmas or maybe you don't ok you'll appreciate it because god has already given you a gift you have that gift and i just i'm happy to see each one of you this morning i'm happy to be here and i'm thankful that i have the gift of having a place to call my church and people who i can call my brothers and sisters in christ and people uh it's uh we always remember the they say the reason for the season which is they try to explain why we do what we do and that's when christmas they always say you have to remember the reason for the season and the reason is the birth of son lord jesus that's what we need to keep in mind when we're celebrating or whoever you spend it with us and appreciate each gift you get yeah and appreciate the gift god has given you yeah so thank you all for your time [Music] we approach closer to christmas let us not forget why we remember this day you sent us the the best gift we could ever receive and your son with that sacrifice at calvary calvary gave us even more gifts [Music] and throughout we have received so many lords i thank you for allowing me to be here this morning [Music] [Music] amen [Music] is [Music] on is [Music] ah [Applause] [Music] then [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music]
