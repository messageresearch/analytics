TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] uh [Music] foreign [Music] bye [Music] so [Music] please [Music] them so [Music] [Applause] [Music] to [Music] uh [Music] now [Music] ah [Music] now [Music] huh [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey [Music] i am [Music] hey [Music] hey [Music] hey [Music] so [Music] so [Applause] [Music] so [Music] me [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] and [Music] [Music] uh [Music] hmm [Music] um [Music] um [Music] how many of you love god for so open and the judgment day rather eve eve to the serpent and so forth but on that day won't be able to pass back to anybody our very own conscience will be standing right there now this stand before everyone you've done while you've been here on the earth the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works first of all we see that there are there are books and these books are the sinners books what happens that when a person repents accepts the gospel you are manifested to be a son of god one an eternal god an eternal son of god we see them that there are books open or two or three witnesses written in that book you might try to dodge that but when you do that who concerns him your conscience comes and testifies the same thing and it says i say amen to what that book says he covered it [Music] another book that i'm with you which will be judging now let's see revelation 22. verse 18. unto every man that hears the words of the prophecy of this book if any man shall add unto these things god shall add unto him the plagues are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy that takes away god shall take away his part out of the book of life beautiful says this locker it feels dislocated look at revelation 20. on verse 15. we've read here from brother brother and this is two books here book and the other one is books and one of them is the book of life 2015. and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire entonces so there's there is a danger for your name to be taken out of the book of life written in the book of life and verse 2 chapter 4 verse 2 first corinthians moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful but with me it is a very small thing that i should be judged of you or of man's judgment yea i judge not my own self tremendous shut up until the lord comes who will who both will bring to light the hidden things of the dark side will make manifest the councils of the hearts and that shall then shall every man have praise of god there's something there that goes off with something else i'll just leave it there 524 we find it was is where do we go when we change house each one of us will change households i don't think about that where do you go where do i go many believe that they're going to the same place says foreign timothy i said 524 but the wicked are in a place of waiting someone look at right now look look at luke chapter 16. 16 22 of luke hermano hermano juan alvarado foreign 22. and it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the angel unto abraham's bosom the rich man also died and was buried the dagger died and was taken to abraham's bosom and the rich man also died and was buried verse and in hell he lifted up his eyes being in torments and seeing abraham far off and lazarus in his bosom he was in a place of waiting entonces la punta said father abraham have mercy on me and send lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in the water and cool my tongue for i am tormented in this flame conformed according to the words he was a so-called believer is that right and he says father abraham he was sentenced to death and there he is [Music] punishment capital punishment he's not yet is should i change subjects continue reading now therefore there is no condemnation for them who are in christ jesus to walk not after the flesh but after the spirit no i with you there is no judgment [Music] matthew 7. you know what they are i'll be picking it up from where steve after matthew 7. not everyone that says unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that does the will of my father which is inhabited many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name cast out devils and i name that many wonderful things wonderful works i'd like to insert something before going to the radio station this morning i forget the man's name rule no notice i will liken him into a wise man which built the house his house upon a rock it is and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell knocked for it was founded upon a rock and everyone that hears my these things the mind and does them not shall be likened into a foolish man which built his house upon the sand is and the rain descended and the wood the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the foul of it now the scriptures that we read in romans chapter two refers to conscience either accusing or defending your very own country is going to accuse you whatever or it's going to defend you no no no is that's amen over there the witnesses will be there against you amen and your own country will say amen yes i didn't stand on my life i went to church just to have a good time i was going over here look for a girlfriend i would get an overview look for a boyfriend to look fine for our social standing i don't really through his word for this morning jesus went unto the mount of olives and early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them entonces a woman taken in adultery and when they had said her in the midst they said unto him master this woman was taking adultery in the very act now moses and the law commanded us that such should be such should be stoned but what says this they said tempting him and they that they might have to accuse him but jesus took down with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard the knot so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you let him cast first cast a stone at her and again he stood down and wrote on the ground hole heard it being convicted by their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the eldest even unto the last and jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst the greek says [Music] in the day when god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according to my gospel christ then he starts writing on the ground he accuses woman of adultery but there are many more things other than adultery [Music] [Music] none of them right [Music] how great thou art jesus christ [Music] ah [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] bye [Music] me you
