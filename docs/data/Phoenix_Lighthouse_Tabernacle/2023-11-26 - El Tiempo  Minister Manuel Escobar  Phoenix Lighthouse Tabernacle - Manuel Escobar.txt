TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and they slay the amorites and the haites but there wasn't one hurt among any of them until sin come in the camp Tu that Babylonian garment and that gold wedge and hid it under his camp then the next day they lost 16 man stop stop wait a minute there's something wrong something's wrong here we're going to call seven days of fast God made us a promise there will be nothing hurt as our enemies will fall at our feet and there's something wrong here something went wrong somewhere because we got six SE dead man laying here they're Israelite brothers and they're dead why did they die innocent man because one man stepped out of the line you see the reason this needs to be taught amen the church lining up lining up with the word of God lining up with God lining up with each other walking perfectly upright soberly before all men fearing God because one man stole a garment and done something that he should not done took the life of 16 I think it was 16 maybe more I believe it was 16 man that was dead Joshua called said there's something wrong God made the promise and something's wrong we bring the sick up before us and they fail to be healed we need to call a solemn fast call an assembly something's wrong somewhere God made the promise God's got the sck to that promise and he will do it and he called a fast and they found out the castot and a confessed it and they killed a family and and all and burnt their ashes and left it there for a memorial and Joshua went right on through the battles taking everything without a scratcher wound there you are one day he had need a little time extra time the sun was going down the man couldn't fight very good at night time Joshua that great warrior anointed of God positionally placed into the land like Ephesians to the new church POS possessed the possessing the land taking it over he needed some time so he said Son stand still and she stood still for about 12 hours until he took the land see now the book of Ephesians Place us positionally in Christ what they was in the Holy Land we are placed not in the Holy Land but in the Holy Ghost now let us read just the word see how perfect the church is Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God oh I like that God made him an apostle no Elders laid hands on him no Bishop sent him anywhere but God called him and made him an apostle Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the W of God to the Saints Sanctified ones which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Jesus Christ how he addresses this this is not to the unbelievers this is to the church it's called to the called out ones the Sanctified and called ones that are in Christ Christ Jesus now if you want to know how we get in Christ Jesus if you turn to First Corinthians 12 it said far by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body what the Holy Ghost not by water baptism you Church of Christ people but by one capital S one spirit not by one handshake by one letter not by one sprinkle but by one spirit amen we are all baptized into one body our possession the land that God give us to live in the Holy Ghost just as he give Canaan to the Jews he's give us the Holy Spirit by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body you get it now he's talking to the spiritual Canaanites Israel the spiritual Israel has possessed the land oh aren't you glad you come out of Egypt's garlic aren't you glad you're out of the Wilderness and remember they had to eat Mana Angels food out of Heaven until they crossed over into the land when they crossed over into the land the Mana ceased to fall they were fully mature then and they eat the old corn of the land amen now that you're not babies anymore now that you're not Desiring the censor milk of the Gospel that you don't have to be babed and padded and persuaded to come to church now that you're real fully matured Christians you're ready to eat strong amen you're ready to come into something he said you're ready to understand something that's deep and Rich oh we'll get into it directly all it's been hidden since the foundation of the world he said now that you come into this I'm addressing this to [Music] you not to those who just left Egypt not to those who are still in the journey but to those who are in the promised land that has received the promise how many's received the promise of the Holy Ghost aren't you glad that you're in the land over here now eating the old K eating the strong things of God got a clear understanding your your spiritual mind is all un muddled up you know exactly who he is is you know exactly what he is you know exactly where you're going you know exactly all about it you know in whom you have believed and persuaded he's able to keep that which you've committed to him against the day oh that's the one that's who Paul's talking to now listen close now watch the faithful in Christ Jesus now let me have the church to repeat that how do we get into Christ by jaring Church no by putting our name on a book no by being baptized by IM Mery no how do we get into Christ by one Holy Spirit are we all baptized in into one promise the body amen and are partakers of all that amen amen oh I like that if it wasn't a horse I could sh when I get in this land it's mine I'm home now I'm in Canaan I'm subject to anything God wants to use I'm walking on Holy Ground a child of the king amen all roped and ready I've come out of Egypt come up to the promised land stood the trials passed over Jord into this blessed promise oh how did I get it by one Spirit the same way Paul got it acted on me the same way it did on him same way it did On You by One Spirit we are all baptized not sprinkled just a little sprinkle of it feel pretty good but immersed all make the swim under and the Holy Ghost that's the promise are Ephesians are Joshua which is the holy spirit Josh means Jesus Savior J meaning the Holy Spirit representing it in the spiritual as that was in the natural that he is our great warrior amen he's our great leader as God was with Joshua so is God in the Holy Spirit moving us about and When sin comes in the camp the Holy Spirit Demands a heart amen what's wrong here in this church something's wrong oh can't you see how we got too many sons of Kish now too many Sauls coming from seminaries and Theological schools and going out and teaching this perverse things the Bible said they would [Music] do seemingly not having the Fai separating themselves from you having no fellowship with you so forth having a form of godliness and denying the power thereof from such turn away they don't know where they come from they can't give any reason I say this this from Brother Bo clber a friend of mine if there's anything that's a ill illegitimate unod created anything in the world is a mule a is a lowest of all things he is a he don't know what he is he cannot produce himself no more a mule cannot be bred to another mule and become a he's finished he don't know where his papa come from neither does he know his mama for he is a little a little donkey and a mare horse God never did that don't you lay such as that on to God God never done that God said everything shall bring forth of its kind yes sir but a mule is a his Papa Was a donkey and his mama was a m horse so he don't know what he does belong to he he's a horse trying to be a mu or mu or he's a horse trying to be a donkey donkey trying to be a he don't know where he does belong and he is a hardheaded this say there is in the world you can never put a bit of trust to him and that's way a lot of people are in church they don't know who their papa is they don't know who their mama is the only thing they know they're either Presbyterian Methodist Baptist or Pentecostal or something they don't know where they come from and an old donkey you can just holler at him as much as you want to holler at him he'll stand there and stick them big ears out look you can preach to them all night long and they don't know a bit more when they left and what they did when they come in now that's just right I don't mean to be rude but I want to tell you the truth but there's one one thing they can do they're good workers oh they just work work work work that puts me in mind a bunch of these Armenians that's always trying to work their way into heaven that's right a mu all the l a society in this chicken supper for the pay the preacher we got to have this dance and this social just work work work work work work work and they what are they working for ask them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe they stick out their ears and don't know where they belong what do you mean where did all this what do you mean the Holy Ghost I don't ever heard nothing about it oh you must be some kind of fanatic see they don't know who Papa was was or who mama was either and you have to beat him on everything you do beat here beat there beat here beat there that's right an old but I tell you you don't have to do that by a real Fair breaded horse just crack the whip over him one time and brother he's gone he knows what he's doing oh how fine it is to ride a thir brand how nice is come on boy oh man oh you better hold tight you leave the saddle in the air that's the way it is with real thir breed Christians Hallelujah you the Holy Ghost repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission [Music] gone just as quick as they can get to the water they're gone they can't rest day and night until they receive the Holy Ghost why you know a Christian knows who his papa was see it takes two to make a birth that's right Papa and Mama the mule don't know which was Papa which was Mama but we know who Papa and Mama was for we were born of the written word of God confirmed by the spirit Peter said on the day of Pentecost if you will repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and brother a real born again Christian oh my he's spirited as soon as he gets the word he receives the Holy Ghost ask him something man he knows where he's standing do you believe in Divine Healing amen you believe in the second coming amen the MU religion I don't know Dr Jones said one time at see oh they don't know well I tell you my church is not sure of it oh brother but a born again man and woman is this is sure the coming of the Lord Jesus they're just as sure they got the Holy Ghost as there is a Holy Ghost Jesus said the woman at the well we worship in this mountain and the Jews worship at jerus he said woman hear my words the hour is coming and now is when the father seeketh those that are worship him in the spirit and the truth Thy Word is the truth and every man that will read the Bible and believe every word that Bible says and follow its instructions and receive the same holy ghost that they receive the same way they received it same results they received it same power they got when they received it he knows who his Papa and Mama was he knows he's washed in the blood of Jesus Christ bned of the spirit filled with God's unction he knows where he's standing sure he's in Canaan he knows where he come from that's the way it is with a real Christian asking have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed Amen brother AM stand the other day by an Old Saint 92 years old talking to your 80 year old Pastor I said Grandma just as bright as she could be she said yes my [Music] son I said how long has it been since you she received the Holy Ghost she said glory to God about 60 years ago I got now she'd been a mule she' said now wait a minute I was confirmed and sprinkled when I was well certain and they take me into the church and I took my letter

uh he calls me last night said he couldn't make it so I already had my message I just didn't have it in Spanish but then I saw an individual sitting by me and uh all of a sudden I looked and I said well he's part of our family he's preached here before a great speaker someone that loves the Lord and I said uh I hit my friend I poked him so he could wake up he likes to sing and he do created a new world I don't but he was into the singing I told him tell your dad if he'll speak in the morning so the person that's going to break the bread of life for us this morning from Mexico San Pedro um a nice place to visit beautiful uh it's close to everything um I as I recall I I stayed around that area I went to a Dennis um maybe 15 20 minutes away from from those areas beautiful like I said a beautiful place and um I would go to Mon and it's not too far from monter um but the person I was with the person that took me I don't know why he never wanted to stop and I would tell him well I heard Pano own these areas I don't this is what I was told and he says now we're going to Salo so I never did go into San Pedro one of these days I still have the the ability to walk so until I can walk I plan to visit certain places ours is Sedro with that our speaker part of our family brother es like I said this brother is [Applause] a if I ever met a man of God I've met a lot of men of God but here's the type of Pastor the characteristics of a pastor that if somebody wants to be a pastor look at the characteristics of this individual of this brother and I will tell you that's what a pastor should look like somebody showed me a shirt the other day on this shirt it had uh this is the way a person ought to look long hair baggy pants and the reason I share this with you because there are requirements and the requirement Number One requirement is we are the best we should dress the best should act like we're the best and here's the best that we have God bless [Applause] you God bless you all you this morning with the name above all names the sweet and Powerful name of our Lord Jesus Christ I'd like to tell you all this morning I'd like to give thanks to the Lord for the opportunity he grants us to be able to be here once again because one of brother that accompanies me Phoenix he told me I would like to go to Phoenix say I'll guide you and I'll go with you here he is I would like for him to please stand brotherto and his wife they're accompanying me as well my wife I also saw her around here somewhere you already know her but it's good to do it as well he say I wasn't going to do this I was going to hold back I say that she's the most beautiful woman but that's going to cause a controversy so I'm just going to play it safe I thank our pastor brother Montoya he has given me the honor this morning to take his pulpit and I hope that the Lord helps us this morning because there are a people in front of me in real life I'm not so uh I don't get really get ahead of myself much all because all of a sudden the Lord comes upon you and things begin to change but me on my behalf I would like to go slow and i' would like to give you the greetings our brother sent from our local church when we told told them that we were coming over here they told us to please greet all the brothers over there in the congregation so please receive a greeting from our brothers back home and I'd also like to send a greeting to our brothers who are watching us online for our brothers in Iowa that perhaps this morning they're tuned in I hope that the Lord gives us this morning what we came looking for I'd like to invite you to please take your Bibles this morning we like to take a scripture we find in the Book of Ecclesiastes it's in chapter 3 and it's verse 11 which we will be reading glory be to God do you have it there Brothers the verse verse 11 reads he had made everything beautiful in his time also he has set the world in their heart so that no man can find the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end let us please stand to have a small prayer this morning to place you in the hands of the Lord let us bow our heads God and good Heavenly Father Lord Jesus this morning come to stand before th divine presence Lord I Thank you for this opportunity you grant me L your word has been read I cry out for your help because I need it I'm somebody who needs much of your hand of Grace your hand of Mercy bless us this morning Lord with your word everyone to be attentive to it we understand you have more to give us than we can ask for Lord I give you thanks name of our kind Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen and amen you may take your seats you'd be so kind this morning I like to speak on a topic that I have titled time and truly it's beautiful to listen to prophetic voice at this time in this age which is he that gives us the the foundation that for talk in the Bible I believe with all of my heart that if God had not sent a prophet to this age for us we would be lost because God sent the voice of God for these last days and he revealed all things had for ages and ages but he would like to reveal them to us and that's where our joy that's where our Delight is because look because our Prophet told us that the Pentecostal gospel well without offending anybody because I know many people watch Us online and brother he said the Baptist and the Methodist he said uh they're they're going wrong they're in the wrong path oh they're rot in food and that's what the gospel became throughout the ages that's why God sent a prophetic Messenger to a special people in this you understand that we were predestinated before the foundation of the world to hear this precious gospel it's not to boast God determin it in that way as he told the Apostle John or better yet the Apostle Peter when John lied on the Lord's bosom and they told him he said what about him he says oh what about you amen amen it's simply his grace wej the grace and the mercy that is where we can find rest look and to go to our topic about time we're going to be here putting a marriage and divorce paragraph 89 in paragraph 89 reads is the question the true answer that Jesus wants to go back to is to go back to the beginning then that would be in Genesis because the word Genesis is the seed chapter to every question in the Bible and you always have to go back to see to see what kind to see what kind of seed is in the field to find out what crops will be now now what kind of seed is sown Genesis being the seed chapter we'd go back to Genesis Jesus introduces us to that scripture at the beginning now remember that's when time started to begin before that it was eternity now our question there was notice if we go back to the beginning now that's a really marvelous scripture because Genesis is the book of seed so truly in Genesis is where time started because from Genesis 1 to Genesis there was no time it was simply eternity but time began when woman was deceived received and after Genesis 3 and so on we see the scene how is the woman of she was deceived and she didn't get the word of God and there when she committed this act there began time because the Lord had said in Genesis 2 of all the trees in the garden you may only not of the one of knowledge and science because the day you eat it thereof you will surely die then when the woman she she entered into transgression then that's where time began there that's where time started counting down because there was no time before that it was only eternity only even though we didn't know it before but now when a prophet comes he shows us through the scripture that God predestined us before the foundation of the world and that our origin is eternity so that is our origin but we didn't know that unless God sent a prophetic messenger now going into this scripture into this part of the Bible I told you on an occasion that I blamed Adam because he had sinned but then a prophet came and he gave us the Panorama first of all he tells us that there was five attributes in God that he wanted himself display that in him was to be a father to him was to be a son in him was to be a Healer and him was to be a savior and in him was love but this attributes he himself wanted to express and to be able to express them he had to create he had to create a human being in this case our father Adam and our mother Eve who which he placed in the Garden of Eden and I'd like to tell you this morning they enjoyed in the beginning of Eternity praise be the name of the Lord brother and the beautiful thing they spent an eternity or a long time while they were in the Garden of Eden and since they were Eternal they remain in the age of 18 to 21 years old which that is the Eternal age I was talking with a brother in the conventions in Durango I saw a young man here like Jose very goodlooking well he's my grandson and I told the young man well you look truly handsome he said but let me tell you one thing that I'm also going to be like you said just give me a couple more days they don't get desperate because we're waiting for the coming of the Lord the scripture say that these bodies will be transformed and we'll go back once again to our original state so just a few moments more and then we'll see our faces once again and he simply just smiled I want to tell you because in the heart of each human being even if you didn't understand this gospel within you inside of your heart in the deepest of your soul you know you know you're part of that eternal being within your heart that's vibrating there's that desire and I want to tell you that the desire is correct because a prophetic messenger came and he revealed this Mysteries which had been hidden throughout the ages and throughout time but now they would be revealed for which you and I we're partakers of name be Lord that's why our delight and our joy is in our Lord Jesus Christ and may the Lord help us this morning now to speak on time I'd like to take a scure from the message glory to God you find it in the book I believe it's marriage and divorce now this quote we have it in the book of adoption this is paragraph 57 brother bham says the following now but he wanted to put things in time you had to make something to worship so his attributes produced this then he made the man then in he looked lonesome so now to show now his great mind and he had the picture of the Christ and the church praise it be the name of the Lord the scripture says that he wanted to put things in time now we know that God is eternal now truly he wanted to put things in time knowing that we we were chosen before the foundation of the Earth being a part of Eternal God he also wanted us to use to use the Eternal to time praise be the name of the Lord this was in the great Mind Of God glory to God that he wanted to place you and I in time amen amen this is wonderful on behalf of the Lord so he tells him that way it's not that you or I wanted to is because God in his grace he determined it so and he is perfect amen amen be the name of the Lord he wanted us for us to go to time so we can love eternity because this is the grace of the Lord because he knew that you being predestinated you weren't going to get lost you're not going to get lost is be the name of the Lord only God wanted to display his grace you want to show these five attributes for you and iise the name of the Lord may he help us this morning now going into this part of time we find that he that he came to take together with us a life of time that's why he appeared 2,000 years ago as a man just like you and I to also have an experience or to be like us that way he could relate to us that's why the Bible says he knows our condition to be able to understand us perfectly that is why he also had to enter into time but our Prophet said but when he resurrected he said you can see him once again in the pillar in the pillar of fire because he returned once again to his original state and in the book of adoption he also wanted to try time praise it be the name of the Lord God also wanted to go into time with us to be able to understand this to better understand each one of us amen another way it would be theology this way he had the experience of our sufferings just as our joy he could understand us perfectly glory to the name of the Lord may God have mercy on us this morning now talking about time let's see what brother bam says in this message of marriage and divorce he says there in Genesis Jesus called our attention to the scripture in the beginning now remember that's when time started to begin before that it was eternity now our question there was notice if we go back to the beginning glory to the name of the Lord God takes us back to where it began where time began was there in Genesis that's where time there was no time but God placed us in a state of time amen praise and be the name of the Lord and in the message marriage and divorce the prophet paragraph 96 now notice that after the beginning we also broke the line we was the line of time and we also the line of life and the line of time the P was broken everything was in ruin now what caused all of this he says the woman amen amen praised be the name of the Lord that's where the line of continuity the line of life and the line of time there in Genesis 3 that was all broken and that created us to be creatures of time that is why we find ourselves here but we know that our origin Eternal together with God but he wanted to put us in time to him to be able to display his attributes as a Healer as a savior attributes were inside of him and he wanted to express them so in this way God could Express his thoughts that's why we came into this state of time we know that time is ending Revelations 10:7 tells us at the days of the seventh angel these Mysteries would be revealed that's why now we can understand the plan of God because God sent a prophet which he revealed all of these things were which were hidden to us glory to the name of the Lord let us continue with our talk this morning so we're talking about time and we know that currently our time ising out glory to the name of the Lord now brother Brown says in the message adoption paragraph 57 now he wanted to put things in time he had to make something to worship so his attributes produced this then he made a man then this man he looked lonesome so to now show his great mind that he hadn't a picture of Christ in the church he he did not take a different piece of and made a woman but he took from the side of Adam a rib prais be the name of the Lord now here the prophet God that God wanted to place things in time he placed us in a state of time amen amen that's why we find ourselves in this current condition on occasion I said that I was displeased with Adam because he's the one that put us in this condition I said if Adam wouldn't have sinned then we would live in eternity but when a messenger Prophet came and he spoke to us about Jesus Christ the the mystery revealed he told us that God had this in his mind because he wanted to reveal his secrets and he wanted to reveal his attributes for us amen amen that's where we find our rest that's where our joy is that he himself wanted he wanted to display his attributes and here we are this morning praise it be the name of the Lord I hope that the Lord helps me this morning I'm going to read from the paragraph of marriage and divorce 89 brother Brenham says now our question that was noticed is to go which would be in Genesis because the word Genesis a dece chapter pra be the name of the Lord for all the question in the Bible and you always have to go back to to see what kind of seed is in the field to find out where your crops will be now what kind of scene is was swn in Genesis being the seed chapter we'd go back to Genesis Jus to that scripture at the beginning now remember that's when time started to begin before that it was eternity now our question there was notice if we go back beginning Amen in the beginning everything was eternity just eternity but God wanted to place us in a state of time that is why we're now in a current state of time but Revelations 10:7 tells us that time is running out it's finishing we're at the end of time hope the helps us this morning because we're in the end time and brother we hope that the Lord because here we have wonderful things that a prophet brought us and that's where our anchor is praise be the name of the Lord a paragraph I have here glory to God [Music] it's from the kinsman redeemer paragraph 47 says When a Man Loves a Woman and he marries her because she's just pretty there will be an end to that but when a man finds a woman that he loves you don't know why but he loves her and she finds a man that she loves no matter what he looks like he loves her she loves him that's an eternal made in glory they death nor else can ever separate them because they are from eternity and they stepped out in the space of time and will return back to Eternity isn't this wonderful or it be the name of the Lord is it how how we had to enter this space of time leave eternity and go into a space of time and then once again go back to Eternity amen praise be the name of the Lord so we left eternity time and then we go back once again to Eternity is it not wonderful for us praised be the name of the Lord may God have mercy upon us this morning he help us I hope that the Lord help me help his guidance and I need more of him now to continue with our talk this morning I said that our our talk is about time where time began and I'd like to read one more quote from Brother brandham blessed be the name of the Lord put to the Future home of the Heavenly bride and to God he made the Earth and he worked six days and he rested on the seventh it was just a type of time but I only said that we've come to be eternal this Millennium is a type of the Sabbath and even us we are in time amen amen PR be the name of the Lord still the Millennium seventh day we are still in what is called time now time ends until the Millennium and from Millennium continues eternity amen amen pra be the name of the Lord so we hope the Lord helps us this morning this time because we need a lot from the powerful hand his hand of Grace his hand of Mercy because these times are very difficult and they're very dangerous that we need more help from the hand of God than other time because are the most difficult and dangerous times of all times so this morning I'd like to continue just a little bit more with the help of God the Lord help us because I need help I need from his powerful hand glory to the Lord I'm going read from the marriage and divorce this is from adoption paragraph 57 now he wanted to put things in time he had to make something to worship so his attributes produce this so then he made the man then this man he looked Lonesome now to show his great mind we had a picture of Christ in the church he took not a different and made a woman but he took from the side of Adam a rib took from the spirit of Adam and the femin and put it in this rib when you see a man that acts a man that acts like a c there's something wrong prais be the name of the Lord God wanted to put things in time that was God's purpose to show his grace he wanted to put his children in time that's why through this revelation we understand God's purpose towards us he wanted to place us inside of time amen praised be the name of the Lord but we know that time time is time to go back home praise be the name of the Lord this morning I hope that the Lord help me may God have mercy and help us this morning to continue with our talk because prais it be the name of the Lord glory to the name of the lordu glory to God let's worship the name of the Lord read the scripture of Ecclesiastes of of verse 11 in the chapter in the third chapter the scripture says he had made everything beautiful in his time also he had said the world in their heart so that no man that the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end that's why we needed a prophetic messenger why do we need him so he can reveal the things that were hidden throughout the ages and time but God had him through the seventh angel these Mysteries they would be open Praises be the name of the Lord that's why we can understand God's purpose towards us we can know the reason for why we're here we know that we're just passing by because the of the Lord is at hand this morning brother I'd like to give thanks to God for the opportunity to be here once again with you all and rejoice around the word of God and see these things that God had for ages and time but he had them specifically set for a people a special people through the church ages especially for the end time well I begin I believe my time is running out so first I'd like to thank God for this I believe brother simply there are things to see but up to this point we thank God for it for these Ministry that the Lord hased allow to see each one of you this morning once again this place for which we are be to have Fellowship around the grace may the Lord bless the pastor our brother Montoya and may the Lord be with each one of you God bless you may God keep you amen amen amen and amen stand up for a moment please I'm only gonna take an hour I won't take more than that I believe that God formed us for one purpose so that we would be here subject to time and as we get older as we've said said before some of us are closer to 22 than 100 we will see the time when this body is transformed but before now that we're in this time element I I wish we could stop it if I stop time today that Dimension that we don't see open up you would see your loved ones there if you don't understand there's a hole there is a hole and in that hole is a dimension that we can't see we can't touch we know it's there Einstein talked about it but we forget we haven't been taught correctly to understand that if I was to put myself directly into that channel bring forth whatever I desire because it's in time here there for the blessings to bring whatever is there into my presence now take your seats it's simple life is simple we make it hard and the reason we make it hard is our Lord Jesus Christ decided in the beginning how you were going to act what was going to happen in your lifetime how we would travel Souljers but there had to be a time where you and I could see what's there I don't want to go back I can't go back to the Garden I don't want to go back to the Garden I want to go forward there's something special about that place where all eternity is at that's why brother Brenham said when you leave here you're going to a better place where is that dimension where there is no time where he saw individuals that he converted all young there was no time there is no time there but I will share with you I got to be led we got to be led you can't lead yourself I'll say it again we were never meant to lead ourselves I start leading myself I get into trouble and the type of troubles that we get into we do things not knowing that they're wrong and then he brings something to you he brings the attention of what we have done wrong in our life he brings it to us but there's someone else that makes it even rougher that that puts us down that abuses us abuses our thinking abuses heart and all he's doing is telling us the truth but in the beginning Before Time existed and God was thinking about you and I he knew exactly where you going to fail he knew exactly where I was going to fall knew exactly where we would be he knew everything that's the God we serve but he always wanted us to be led and I always tell myself who leads you wife who leads you son daughter who leads you someone has to lead us and if you tell me the Holy Spirit leads you I'll say Amen but that Holy Spirit needs a vessel so you can be led a spirit's not gonna come and talk to but it's the holy spirit in man that has to guide you I heard brother Brenham say a dove doesn't bathe he has oil inside the oil is inside brother Brenham said that goes out through its feathers and keeps himself clean the oil is produced from the inside the oil is produced from here you say Amen listen the body the body your body produces oil but it all depends what's in here so we know that the days of Miracle are still with us if you believe in miracles and you yourself see yourself as a dove how many of you are doves I know we talked about the lamb but we're we are a dove that's our nature we just don't need anything we don't have a spiritual G to swallow nonsense as the brother said rotten food no that's not the word he use we don't eat it we stay away from it it's dead it's belly it's rotten we only eat pure Christian food and that's the word of God you say Amen so what I want you to do look at your neighbor I want you to tell your neighbor the Holy Spirit today the Holy Spirit today canot be disgraced if it's disgraced it's not in us that little DB will take its flight you say Amen remember it's inside the oil is cleansing us from all our rotness it takes his flight how far look put the branch out there's the branch when it left the ark you think where did it settle on a eat that there had to be a branch you are that Branch this morning and when we get away from the word of God of the word of God the acting of the word of God disgrace a little dou will take its fight he's right there right there at the tip of your finger right there that close waiting for you and I to rep and it comes back this is God's plan this is what God had planned for each and every one of us when we were in and that's why I say when was Jesus crucified when was he crucified let me put it this way because I have the quote Jesus died before the foundation of world he died in God's thinking you spiritually died in the of God so that a new creation born can you say Amen a new nature creature now I want you to stand up just gave you a little bit this is what I believe that we are at the end of time everything is is at its place rumors of wars the way people act all ified unto marriage what makes a real Christian is what's in the inside and what's in the inside should be in the inside is what the brother spoke about love you want to get to that Dimension brother Brenham said you needed what perfect love in other words I can't stand Eli he thinks he's a machine I can't stand that character more so when I see Dan the guy thinks he has a gift he thinks that he can sing boy when he gets off tune y all remember when he got off tune no some of us do I can't stand him that ain't perfect love I don't care what he does to you what she does to you she says perfect love is closing the mouth when somebody speaks evil of you something simple as not saying a word I'm sorry can you take a punch all right machine H now who hit you you ain't gonna hit me I've been punched before so did you go tell Danny that I punched you there it is he tells nobody what people do he keeps it and he's going to pray Lord change his heart perfect love don't ever hate someone because they don't speak with you don't ever hate someone because they have a little bit more than you never hate someone or despise someone because God blesses them more than He blesses are fulfilling scripture the Bible says I Will Bless who I want to bless let me say it again I will bless who I want to bless and I will curse who I want to curse so remember keep it closed love everyone and God will give you the the desire of your heart why because here it is Jesus was whooped and he didn't say a thing didn't defend himself how many of you have a need if you have a need I mean I love the services I rejoiced good speakers there was only one thing just one simple what attracts people you know what attracts people no matter what you say what you do there's only one attraction and that attraction is when when somebody lays hands on you the burden goes away when somebody lays their hands on lay a hand on you don't you feel good you feel relaxed you feel like something left so you know I'm going to have the ministry stand right there and if you have a burden don't care what it is come up here brother stand right [Music] here Joe stand over [Music] here [Music] I've learned two things in my life and brother Brenan made it clear Gentiles Gentiles that's what we are need someone to touch them Jewish people all they say speak the word speak the word but there's something about Gentiles this nation is breaking all that the prophets for told is coming to pass so what I want if you want to be prayed for your marriage your son your daughter your health I went to the doctor you know they give you all this good garbage and they check your blood and in that blood they tells you everything about yourself there's not one thing you can hide from that exam it's all in the blood which is the life that lives in you but I know a blood I know a blood and a person that gives us blood name is Jesus Christ he can he will destroy what man has said is in your blood all you have to do is come and believe nothing more just come and believe so if you want you've been fighting with a religious spirit come through the line if you've been fighting maybe drugs maybe you've been fighting with your neighbor I don't know come through the line we didn't have the opportunity yesterday but today is
