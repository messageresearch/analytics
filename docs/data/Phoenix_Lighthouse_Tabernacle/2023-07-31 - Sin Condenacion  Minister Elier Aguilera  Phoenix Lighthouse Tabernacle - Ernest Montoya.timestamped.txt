[32:02] to our pastor for the confidence and
[32:04] trusty places in me this evening
[32:08] My Brother Carlos you know brother
[32:09] Javier and albertini as well
[32:13] I'll be going directly to the word
[32:16] to make time last
[32:22] for some reason I'm a bit nervous
[32:38] to Hebrews 9 27.
[33:01] and after that we'll be going to first
[33:03] Peter 4 17.
[33:16] reads
[33:24] innovail

[33:40] [Music]
[33:44] and as it is appointed unto men wants to
[33:47] die but after this the judgment
[33:54] and first Peter 4 17.
[33:59] ie
[34:06] said
[34:10] for the time has come that judgment must
[34:13] begin at the house of God and if it
[34:15] first begin in us what shall at the end
[34:17] be of them that obey not the gospel of
[34:19] God
[34:25] and if the righteous scarcely be saved
[34:28] where shall the ungodly and The Sinner
[34:30] appear
[34:33] let us pray
[34:36] Heavenly Father
[34:38] we put ourselves in your hands Lord
[34:45] the words we speak human anoint with
[34:47] your Holy Spirit
[34:53] this place may be strengthened in our
[34:55] spirit and full of joy foreign
[34:59] [Music]
[35:07] Lord Jesus Christ amen amen tomorrow
[35:18] these glasses are just breeders I only
[35:20] need them to read
[35:21] if I leave them on then I can't see you
[35:24] is
[35:25] take them off and I can't read
[35:28] say a
[35:30] is
[35:32] so we're reading here in the scripture
[35:36] I want to call the attention of each one
[35:38] of you okay
[35:41] the scripture speaking to us about a
[35:44] judgments
[35:49] you know that all the Christian World in
[35:51] all the religions
[35:54] a
[35:59] yes
[36:01] they all have to believe that that they
[36:03] will come which they call it judgment
[36:05] which I myself also believe
[36:08] [Music]
[36:09] let me tell you one thing
[36:14] I don't expect to be there on that
[36:16] Judgment Day
[36:19] brother how do you say that the Bible
[36:21] says
[36:23] that's what I want us to see in this
[36:25] evening
[36:26] uh
[36:29] questions what is a judgment um
[36:35] the judgment is made up of several
[36:37] people
[36:39] ones that are accusing
[36:42] and others that are defending
[36:46] now this judgment or this
[36:49] trials
[36:52] I want us to look to him that is
[37:34] since I was born I grew up listening to
[37:36] the message of the hour
[37:45] for some reason at time at that time we
[37:48] were raised as children educated in the
[37:49] message profoundly
[37:56] argument
[37:59] but I considered myself a child that can
[38:02] argue with older people
[38:07] a child of 10 11 or 12 years old arguing
[38:10] with an older person
[38:13] but it was because I had really good
[38:16] teachers
[38:17] pero
[38:27] que me separated
[38:30] at a time where I separated from doing
[38:32] the will of God
[39:06] with that person who would rebuke me
[39:08] this is
[39:10] and you were saying you might say was it
[39:12] the Holy Spirit
[39:15] partially
[39:17] but let's see what the scripture says
[39:20] era
[39:25] mi corazon it was my heart
[39:28] the scripture says
[39:30] in First John 3 20. amados
[39:34] foreign
[39:45] foreign
[40:18] because when the Holy Spirit comes to
[40:21] this place
[40:24] many times the first one that doubts is
[40:27] our hearts
[40:28] and in our heart we begin to doubt
[40:33] is it true
[40:40] am I being brainwashed
[40:45] there has to be a battle with our own
[40:48] heart out of
[41:15] those things that we let enter our heart
[41:28] but there's also some that we should
[41:30] avoid at all costs
[41:32] because if they get to our hearts
[41:36] they're going to cause us
[41:40] and then later it's tough to get it
[41:47] how many times have we not spoken with
[41:49] people who just have that root of
[41:50] bitterness
[41:54] spoke about that root of bitterness
[41:58] and we let that tree grow
[42:01] and it entangles in her heart yes
[42:06] it begins to imprison
[42:12] Place pressure on her heart is
[42:16] no longer space for the things
[42:20] because that heart is occupied
[42:26] so what do we let enter into our heart
[42:34] now one of the things that we need in
[42:36] our hearts important
[42:39] one of the most important things that we
[42:41] need in our heart
[42:43] is love
[42:47] why love Brothers
[42:54] I would prefer that maybe a gift come
[42:56] into my heart and I can do wonders
[43:00] what the scripture says okay
[43:07] even I spoke angelical tongues
[43:11] and I gave all my money to the poor
[43:15] and I don't have love
[43:18] then I am nothing
[43:23] no I can have all of those gifts
[43:34] are we going to display love
[43:37] is
[43:38] love has fruits
[43:41] love has a face
[43:45] love is projected
[43:50] you project that love
[43:56] now how can you say that love has a face
[44:00] a
[44:02] Poland now by the grace of God
[44:06] I have many years
[44:11] and believe me that I am happy
[44:15] and believe me that I am very happy with
[44:18] the job that I do this is
[44:20] and you're saying oh we're just standing
[44:22] there at the door brother
[44:24] yes Brothers
[44:28] for me it's a great thing to be there at
[44:31] the door
[44:36] because many times I'm the first one
[44:38] that greets each one of you
[44:40] I give you a welcome
[44:43] I try to make sure you feel good
[44:49] but sometimes since we already know each
[44:51] other okay
[44:55] I can see that somebody is coming in a
[44:58] certain situation
[45:04] one has to be cautious because when you
[45:06] see that a certain brother comes in a
[45:08] certain situation
[45:12] wants to fight
[45:31] that's the first thing I do he
[45:34] foreign
[46:05] and I just grab them and go like that
[46:08] and I say why don't they greet me
[46:12] but there's no problems
[46:17] we all walk under different
[46:19] circumstances different
[46:21] thoughts
[46:23] things that there is in our mind
[46:26] I wanna
[46:28] uh
[46:31] now I'm very curious in my mind and I
[46:33] think a lot of things
[46:40] I love all of you
[47:03] that says that we should love even our
[47:05] enemies
[47:07] let us love one another
[47:13] look at my brothers and say well I love
[47:15] all of them
[47:17] but sometimes I can't beat everybody's
[47:19] friends
[47:42] no brother I do love you
[48:44] many times
[48:49] something
[48:57] foreign
[49:52] that was my way of thinking
[50:26] he said remember when you were a young
[50:28] person and you were respectful Amen
[50:31] brother
[50:55] our brother can also get us out of that
[50:57] problem we find ourselves in
[51:16] each one of them
[51:21] but sometimes I fight with them
[51:25] they're not all my friends
[51:28] I'm more friends with one than the other
[51:30] obviously
[51:32] maybe I'll see one I'll say hey what up
[51:37] but I love them brother
[51:40] my sisters
[51:42] they're so different one from another
[51:44] either and from the other
[51:48] [Music]
[51:53] I can't tell you that I haven't had
[51:55] problems with them
[51:59] I know that they love me and I love them
[52:04] I don't go and visit them to their house
[52:07] but they know that I love it
[52:10] why because I respect them
[52:14] because every chance I get I show them
[52:17] that I love them with a hug
[52:20] porque
[52:28] is
[52:30] because that helps in a great manner
[52:37] God bless you
[52:46] there isn't a greater thing we could
[52:48] tell our brother
[52:50] this is
[52:56] the platform
[53:00] good morning friends
[53:12] palabras
[53:14] iOS but those were words that to me were
[53:17] very precious
[53:21] I hear them just simply listening to
[53:23] that
[53:24] is
[53:27] it's a very great thing to me for
[53:30] someone to call me their friend
[53:36] that they even the even the god of the
[53:39] heaven can call me his friend
[53:45] but we're talking that we're at a trial
[53:47] or out of judgmente
[53:54] foreign
[53:59] like the Judgment says all living beings
[54:01] one day will have to face judgment
[54:04] yes
[54:06] and that sometimes causes fear among the
[54:08] people is
[54:12] established that means it is
[54:16] that we will die once and then comes
[54:19] judgment
[54:20] now the scripture tells me
[54:23] that it's something terrible
[54:28] I expect to stand in the presence
[54:38] when there's a heart that's judging me
[54:40] every day
[54:45] but I can't fool his heart
[54:48] I have tried
[54:51] I can't fool my own heart
[54:53] in the same way
[55:08] the man
[55:14] do you believe that one day there will
[55:16] be that day of judgment amen Amen
[55:18] brother
[55:21] because that's the way the word of God
[55:23] says it pero
[55:25] is
[55:27] so then what is Our Hope
[55:33] our scripture says that if the heart our
[55:36] heart does not rebuke us
[55:37] but I want to tell you something I don't
[55:40] know about you
[55:43] know my heart continues to rebuke me
[55:45] every day
[55:57] my heart tells me
[55:59] buenosis well you did this
[56:02] you could have done more okay
[56:06] oh well you're doing this you can always
[56:10] do more
[56:14] a
[56:17] is
[56:19] simply just listening to a message or
[56:21] listening to the word brother foreign
[56:51] because it's good to have the word in
[56:54] our mind pero
[56:57] but the wind will take it away
[57:00] we need to let it go into our hearts
[57:08] so that instead that root of bitterness
[57:10] growth
[57:12] that heart can be filled with love
[57:16] when that heart is full with love
[57:19] nothing else will be able to go inside
[57:22] and whatever leaves from there
[57:26] it's going to be of benefit to all of my
[57:29] brothers
[57:35] because we can't just speak empty words
[57:39] hablar
[57:40] de Corazon we need to speak from the
[57:43] heart
[57:44] and do what we say
[58:01] Jason I love you
[58:05] and then we live and I don't even greet
[58:07] him or anything
[58:10] well then something's not right
[58:18] we need that our actions match with what
[58:21] we're talking about
[58:26] now why does our heart rebuke us
[58:32] because when we were created
[58:37] we were created to Worship the Lord
[58:41] to live according to his word
[58:44] pero
[58:54] we were infected
[58:58] with that thing called Death
[59:03] and when we were infected
[59:09] then the battle began against ourselves
[59:14] because like the Apostle Paul says
[59:24] what I don't want to do I do
[59:28] is
[59:29] what I need to do I don't do hermano is
[59:33] bro that's the Apostle Paul
[59:37] now imagine yours
[59:42] but each one of us should think of that
[59:45] if the Apostle Paul
[59:50] these words
[59:54] how much more should we
[1:00:00] now let me tell you the time has gone by
[1:00:11] and certainly we will face judgment
[1:00:15] I must imagine now just imagine a little
[1:00:20] bit
[1:00:23] Daniel Curry and all those who have
[1:00:26] heard the testimony of Daniel Curry
[1:00:36] in front of the Throne of judgment
[1:00:52] that would be the worst of the worst
[1:00:58] no Daniel Daniel Curry was speaking the
[1:01:01] truth
[1:01:03] I've done this work
[1:01:06] so many Souls have come and accepted the
[1:01:09] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:01:11] but even then he was rejected
[1:01:19] only by the grace of our Lord Jesus
[1:01:22] Christ is
[1:01:24] that he found an opportunity
[1:01:31] I may ask you how can we find our
[1:01:34] opportunity
[1:01:35] because I want to tell you
[1:01:52] I was born with that guarantee that one
[1:01:56] day I will die
[1:01:59] I believe that we all have that
[1:02:01] guarantee
[1:02:10] we don't know brother
[1:02:14] but we're gonna die either and
[1:02:17] afterwards
[1:02:18] judgment
[1:02:23] well let me tell you
[1:02:25] that there's an Escape Route
[1:02:30] what are we doing here this evening
[1:02:33] my niece asked me yeah
[1:02:44] they came from the beautiful city of
[1:02:46] Juarez
[1:02:48] to come visit us
[1:02:52] I'm going to ask him if they can please
[1:02:54] stand
[1:02:57] they can see where my wife got her
[1:02:59] beauty from
[1:03:08] why are we going to church again
[1:03:17] that's what she was asking why are we
[1:03:19] going again
[1:03:21] no I'm asking you why are we here again
[1:03:25] why do we come to church on Sunday
[1:03:29] on Thursdays why
[1:03:39] the word says
[1:03:59] Lord this this word is tough It's
[1:04:01] foreign
[1:04:53] this evening if you're thinking of
[1:04:55] living a religion then you're wasting
[1:04:56] your time
[1:05:00] because what I've been says we should
[1:05:02] live the word
[1:05:03] without taking nothing away and without
[1:05:07] adding anything
[1:05:09] how are we going to live this world
[1:05:13] that's what we thank God because
[1:05:17] at the final time
[1:05:23] they gave us the word directly inspired
[1:05:28] that way neither you or I would be
[1:05:32] but what are we feeding on the YouTube
[1:05:35] is it YouTube
[1:05:37] is it the things that people are saying
[1:05:41] what are we doing there
[1:05:43] we have a profit
[1:05:46] I came and brought us the words
[1:05:52] foreign
[1:06:52] be judged twice for the same time
[1:06:56] and we allow the message
[1:07:00] if you allow the word of God to judge us
[1:07:04] and who can who else is
[1:07:07] the very own God from the heavens in
[1:07:09] words
[1:07:14] it's judging us each day
[1:07:17] who else has the right to judge no one
[1:07:21] will judge us
[1:07:22] no one judges the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:07:39] thank you
[1:07:41] now greet your brother
[1:07:46] bless them
[1:07:51] I really enjoyed the the message that
[1:07:54] our brother brought
[1:07:56] remember one thing what we are doing
[1:07:59] here on this Earth we are being judged
[1:08:02] let me say it over again our Prophet
[1:08:05] taught us one thing we are being judged
[1:08:08] here so we're not judged over there and
[1:08:11] you say Amen
[1:08:13] how many want to be judged here
[1:08:22] forgive me I was going to speak both
[1:08:23] languages we're being judged today
[1:08:27] everything we do we're being judged
[1:08:30] that is why that is we have this agent
[1:08:34] free moral agency where we can ask for
[1:08:38] forgiveness
[1:08:43] ask for forgiveness then is more than
[1:08:47] willing to forgive us
[1:08:51] we need to do that ask for forgiveness I
[1:08:56] think we ask for forgiveness every day
[1:08:58] because our heart will condemn us
[1:09:03] the love that we project is
[1:09:06] going crazy sitting there
[1:09:09] my mind was working uh double time
[1:09:13] is remembering what brother Garcia said
[1:09:18] and I'm tell you right now you mentioned
[1:09:21] brother Paul and mentioned that was
[1:09:23] brother Paul yes
[1:09:24] so take your seats for a
[1:09:27] momentum I'm gonna take about five
[1:09:29] minutes I want you to think about what
[1:09:32] I'm gonna say okay
[1:09:37] what I need you to understand is this
[1:09:40] whatever you need tonight
[1:09:43] all you have to do is ask
[1:09:47] we don't ask when we don't receive
[1:09:52] so number one
[1:09:55] forgiveness we can ask for it
[1:09:59] my body hurts I can ask
[1:10:03] that he healed my body
[1:10:05] my mind is is way off
[1:10:09] he can heal my mind
[1:10:12] yes or no so how many of us are so
[1:10:17] involved mentally that we're losing
[1:10:20] control
[1:10:30] every day is a constant battle here this
[1:10:34] is where the key battle is
[1:10:36] and what he said don't let it get into
[1:10:39] your heart
[1:10:41] that's where bitterness comes in
[1:10:43] careful the bitterness let's get into
[1:10:46] your heart
[1:10:47] so let me tell you the root of
[1:10:50] bitterness
[1:10:53] because there's always a little bit of a
[1:10:56] root that stays in there
[1:11:00] and it continues to grow
[1:11:03] and I can tell you right now
[1:11:06] somebody needs prayer
[1:11:10] anyone needs prayer
[1:11:15] then what I want you to do I'm not going
[1:11:17] to call an altar call
[1:11:20] I know it's hot outside
[1:11:22] but it's hotter in hell
[1:11:25] and it is in Phoenix
[1:11:28] so we're being judged
[1:11:32] if you need prayer just stand up I'm
[1:11:35] standing up so I need prayer we need
[1:11:37] prayer I think we all need prayers
[1:11:40] every one of us
[1:11:42] because it's a constant battle that
[1:11:45] we're fighting because
[1:11:49] I know the result is winning
[1:11:52] people that were baptized today
[1:11:56] those three people that were baptized
[1:11:59] what does the Bible say
[1:12:01] they need to be what is
[1:12:05] filled with what with the word
[1:12:08] l-o-v-e
[1:12:12] love amor
[1:12:16] otherwise those individuals will hear
[1:12:20] something
[1:12:21] filled with the wrong character when I
[1:12:24] said you know somebody of Jesus Christ
[1:12:27] this evening
[1:12:30] every fiber of my body
[1:12:34] this is
[1:12:36] an example of what you ought to be
[1:12:40] they made the first step
[1:12:42] happily without a shadow of a doubt
[1:12:46] that they received
[1:12:49] part of Jesus Christ
[1:12:51] when they came up
[1:12:53] now the more they feed it
[1:13:02] that's what we believe Jesus the more
[1:13:06] spirits
[1:13:13] so just raise your hand up to my Lord
[1:13:17] pray I'm going to pray for myself I'm
[1:13:19] going to pray for you
[1:13:21] people send me texts that they wanted
[1:13:23] prayer they needed my name is separated

[1:13:30] structure
