[Music] [Music] the name of Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen amen Elizabeth God bless you once again let's take advantage that we're standing to read the scripture everything else Hebrews 911 this is the base scripture for the topic we've been covering over the Plan of Redemption is because the blessing is not there for not only for the one who reads but the one who hears and the word is the prophecyte in the word of God reads but Christ being come in high priest of good things to come by greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building is neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us purification de la carne for if the blood opposing goats in the ashes of in heaven sprinkling the unclean Sanctified to the purifying of the flesh is how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God amen amen God add the blessing to the reading of his word please have kind of take your seats I believe we're in the best place here in church worshiping our Lord Jesus Christ our pastor find himself out of town thank you for the opportunity he gives us this morning to be able to express a little bit of what's in our hearts and like I've always said to continue motivating each other to pray for each other to keep our pastor in prayer always the power of God always manifests to fulfill the purpose for which which he was called for amen amen amen sincerely [Music] throughout the week in San Luis we had a sensible loss in La Familia Lopez Gallardo and the Lopez Gallardo family our brother Federico yeah find himself over there with some other brothers as well accompanying him or De La Familia part of the family but we know that a Christian doesn't die of God only goes to sleep and there's a promise a promise of Resurrection [Music] it is like God always fulfills his promises when the Son of God rest upon that is something that is an assurance and we give thanks to the brothers who are right now supporting down in San Luis uh Carlos and his wife they're coming from Hawaii City it's a pleasure to have us with us amen God bless I also had a gun some time for a while now it's always a pleasure and what better to be in the house of God seeing one another yes what God is going to do for us it's a mystical people the focus we give it the way in which we see things other results [Music] that's what we're going to continue with the Plan of Salvation has been speaking on [Music] sometimes we try to interpret God and understand them based on the point of view we have so many times it's not what we read but it's more so how much are we going to keep and apply what we have read Anton says so it could be that maybe we only know one scripture but that one scripture is we read it over and over and analyze it and apply it and we meditate then if we read the complete and we didn't meditating the Bible at all in the hearts of men foreign it's always been based on Revelation foreign the church that made God in Revelations 3 14 it describes the conditions which this church finds itself so we have to be assured that we can understand what is the condition of the age what is going to try to pull us in this is like we've never had it before the church finds itself in a lukewarm condition because they have the word physically there's access to the world with our attitudes we depart many times from that word with our attitude our thoughts it comes from two Greek words that means to withstand and trial God calls him blessed but in a point of view the viewers the God's point of view Persona when a person comes they're called Dios according to what God has is he's not blessed because he can't withstand the test foreign in the only way that they can go back is accepting God's advice I mean God directs himself just come to me and buy compra bye you said Abraham says the church is not talking with God it's not dealing with God trying to get the spiritual fruits of God says God's views it's a character in The likeness of Christ which is produced in the burning oven of Affliction when everything is done we will take our character so in this age the antidote to be able to escape that the H is displayed to understand that us as children of God we have to be responsible it's the age of responsibility why the age of responsibility because in Revelation yes from 7 to 11. when he speaks to us he received the order and take the book we have access to the Bible take the book we have it in our hands in our minds from this word access to it than any other time the book that's printed the most is the word of God people and this time to be able to this to be able to say that I am responsible in this age we have to understand that God calls us to action you might ask how brother Matthew 16. when you ask who do you say I am Jesus Jesus asked the disciples who do you say is the son of man and they all gave their response each one had their own interpretation but only one had the revelations that's why it's a battle between Revelation and perception another questions for each one of you and who do you say I am in those vamos and we go say when the Lord says I know there he is walking in the midst of this he is the chief Shepherd of it but don't hold back the persecution the system the tribulation he simply says I know your tribulations like Israel they wonder if God really loves them how can God be just and loving if he stands by and watches his people suffer perfection it's not that he's punishing you foreign what's the mouth of God to propheta his prophet is that's why you go through trials and tests in plain language come to a place of perfection why did you want this why no ceremony I don't know that that's what the prophet says all three are one you can't humanly understand United because that's where we put our faith to test I'd like to give you other news but that's just the way it is that's what the prophet said when The Shepherd of the flock Prophet says if we interpret it as humans it's going to push us towards the age when you have a son says my daughter's so responsible what is it that makes you say those words that your son or daughter make Services when you express yourself in that way of your children you rest it's cancer you rest because you know that they're going to make the right decisions because they're responsible and that's what God is looking for foreign and if he asked a question you can say whatever you want foreign and follow me Luke 9 23 says any come after me deny himself foreign follow me not Revelation 10 7. here it's the same God giving instructions he's saying take up your cross in Revelation he says take the book saying take the cross take your cross not yourself follow me take the book consume it is instructions he did not leave us without insurance but the instructions he gives us we have to be in action s follow me why [Applause] [Applause] come to me if you're sick and I will give you healing foreign [Applause] and not stay without acting we have to act foreign that's good it's hell yeah don't stop because for this time we need to understand it is our response our responsibility is our responsibility because if we don't take responses God loves me God loves me yeah from the world now says love chosen in love before the foundation of the world now watch having predestined us now there's the word for destinations on to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ according to the good pleasure of his will what about it isn't that wonderful he loved you she loved you before there was a world you know your weakness Know It All About You can't surprise it's not based on what you do or what you want based on circumstances [Applause] [Applause] his foreign [Applause] chose to restore you you could have you couldn't have done anything you say brother then let me go enjoy life foreign [Music] [Applause] you were already Eternal with God that's that's a great amount that's a great America through Revelation that it's not what I do no look what you do but I'm just referring to bathroom I'm referring to good things as well as well sometimes we work thinking will earn the favor of God no brother you do it the more work you do the more pleased but God's love was in elections he said I choose you I love you I love you the sacrifice provides the Sovereign Grace for us yes brother now what is it that I have to do is take the word as if it was already done when God speaks it then we can that will happen see him yes brother yes yes that's the way it is we're going through difficult situations we have to be responsible take our cross humble ourselves follow him in the path he's laid for us move forward Prophet says preached in 1961. God has no weak Parts nor strong parts no wait let me go back the word says that he is strong but when you see God you can't say this part is weak we need to improve on this oh this is the strong part of God because God doesn't have any weak Parts simply God then you have God you have the power to create a new system to grab onto this word and the prophet says it's God and he is strong so if you have God yeah and if God there is no weak parts then what does that make us we have God in our heart s because I'm weak so it I'm very I'm so weak because we're trying to interpret God in our way Lord help me in this situation what are you talking about because in God's mind you already saw everything you already saw everything yeah foreign [Applause] and they would go there and live their private life you can create your own world brother if you want a peaceful world believe in your world peace and live in it your own atmosphere around you sir how am I going to do it how much can I dive myself into this word there's one power within you to do it if you have a shadow of God you have the power to do it is you can bring a word in you can bring the world into existence that is the power that's in the church now now and like let's just start oh yes in the church the power is in it right now but it's controlled by a law he knows and it's not to keep the prophet is doing something the act that God responds to you is not based it's based on Election elections and without blemish before God already did it by elections look at the elections give you what you needed foreign [Applause] the prophet says [Music] and you're so Desiring it then it's yours it's yours every place in which you place your foot upon faith is yours it's yours you can possess it if you find the key of Faith so do you understand what I'm trying to say is your son or daughter of God is that faith never leaves is always with you foreign [Applause] [Applause] foreign psycho infernal cuerpo gets the body sick Soma Summit it's a sickness psychosomatic sickness more the power that's within us than we do ourselves so if healing if sickness is created so can healing start in our minds you begin to change your thoughts you begin to put yourself on the same level in which your promises you put yourself in the same level then foreign and all by his grace nothing we could have done you may say what is it that I have to do Implement simply because stay with the word the worst thing is all things are possible for those that believe so if you believe everything is possible for you it's not based on a condition it's based on election in election in election by his grace by the grace of God he saw you he says I elect you I love you I elect himself I know what you're going to do yeah it's all over you but either way I still elect you yote I love you [Music] and I will manifest you my love I love you so much that I want to bring you towards me I want to bring you closer to me normally interpret
