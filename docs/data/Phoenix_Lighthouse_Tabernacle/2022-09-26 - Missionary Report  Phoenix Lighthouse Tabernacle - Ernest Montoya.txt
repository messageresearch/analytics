prayer for our sister and her family you know this is asking for our prayers for their family and their Christian walk that's how we have burning down we're praying in place in this petitions in the hands of God by our heads and close your eyes let us pray Brothers father in this precious mornings we want to give you thanks for your rich and Abundant Blessings Grace is new every day we love you foreign and we place this all before your presence believing with all of our hearts and we've come to the correct place we comes with the correct attitude and we can't believe everything will be all right and that is our trust and our faith living in your word and in your promise you will make all things possible and your holy spirit is working and you're with each one of the petitions of your children and that you're answering yes but joy and happiness because you're the god of God the King of Kings gracias thank you Lord now we pick up this offering foreign [Music] foreign [Music] what I saw [Music] somebody [Music] thing for things [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] give me foreign [Music] [Music] never will okay [Music] another

always good to be home once again as you are standing will first of all begin with the prayer Lord Jesus Christ Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for everything you do real men so the everything you do for us day after day things you do for us are so much sometimes we don't even realize it that it's you right now Lord help us to recognize that we just can't be standing here you know foreign in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen for anything I greet you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ happy to see every one of you almost uh we'll be speaking a little bit brother of our missionary trip to Mexico yes photos and second we'll be showing some pictures in the church the lily of the valley foreign [Music] 9 11. the scripture we've been reading is I believe we only take a percentage of what truly is here is God's spoken word I believe we will never completely understand God the scripture reads the following is but Christ being come and high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building foreign once to the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us is the blood of bulls and of goats and of the ashes of in heifer sprinkling the unclean Sanctified the purifying of the flesh we'll be just speaking to you brethren for a few minutes sharing a little doesn't matter how prepared the preacher may come if the people are not ready of the valley Tabernacle foreign footprints in the sands of time but with his life this is louder than many people the reason we go and go to the convention is the people entering the church I told you the brother were already in expectations there have been some time where they hadn't had Services the thing is just to be in there in the atmosphere and if you get front row seats but if we don't like to get up too early because of traffic then we're gonna have to sit in the back you're only going to receive what you're waiting for talking about yeah but when you stand up here and surrender to God it is God speaking it is God that is inside the man is I like to read the scripture you don't have to stand yes but continue thou in the things which thou has learned and has been assured of the life of whom thou has learned them the reason I say this is because of this quote in the exposition of the seven churches when you prepare for a message that everything comes against you but the messenger says this way in every age we have exactly the same patterns that is why the light comes to some god-given messenger in a certain area and then from that messenger there spreads the light through the ministry of others who have been Faithfully taught now the reason I say this is I don't go over there and give orders I go and learn now there may be things that I may think that maybe it shouldn't be this way we have a leader we have a pastor yes it has been Faithfully instructed by an apostle of God and he's not going to ask what do you think brother Bernie taught me this way foreign from Saltillo you get me from Tama Olympus is stood Faithfully they don't claim anything I believe a true man of God he's going to go looking for his rights forfeits is able to share a little bit of the word uh and we stand next to them and in a convention yeah we're in the convention foreign receiving what they were asking foreign [Music] people got here restoring Homesite whatever you need Paradise you have to be willing to receive it is so many times in the ministry tells us no they're not yours because you're not worthy did you know you are worthy is undeserved gifts what Grace is foreign usted do what you need video is when the people of the Hebrew people crossed over Israel okay foreign it was worth it may God bless you [Applause] God bless you this is my precious brother Branham she said oh yeah can you hear me that voice told him why didn't they cry out to me because on Earth you were a leader and as a leader he will be judged so we have a leader he says the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit Iglesia in this church is we would greet each other foreign the teacher would say I'm going to tell you one thing I believe that you and you are called to the missionary field and we laughed [Music] and I would think the same thing but time has taken up brother says [Music] I'm unworthy experience maybe sin comes out and takes away my joy and and without lying to me you this that and the other yeah but one time take them to the Cross he was defeated there he has no power the power was yeah always take him there he knows he has no power yes yes you're something great but people say something in it so brother Branham The Voice told him you'll be judged for what you've preached as a leader get home a little bit more [Music] he's a repeater I am the faith you are Las Olas the words without being disorderly as our sons everyone was young they were all young Brothers you think the Army the military wants young men because young men can be instructed an old dog very difficult it's difficult for the new man possessed by the older man the man who reasons the man is always trying to look at your failures your failure his own failures it's always the old man who's trying to go before us I've been born again from the new man oh brother you get the Bible in the message why waste time why waste our time you think I like to leave my wife behind Norman I don't brethren just in that I asked you to pray for me pray for me because things are not easy but if you pray for us these are my words for you [Applause] that was fast stand up for a minute greet your your neighbor it's always good to greet each one of us because we're not sure when God is gonna take us home it's good to see faces and bless that Persona and take your seats you know as the boys were were speaking I was just recalling what happened in Mexico City Mexico there's so many churches in Mexico City the ones that stayed faithful to brother Bernie or Pastor or Apostle we visit brother Bernie would say uh you should make it a habit should be part of you there's three services a year the second one was Guadalajara Guadalajara and the third one was Mexico City Mexico We are following orders of what we were left it's not our message it's not our way it's the way we were taught and recalling everything uh I felt bad in Mexico City Mexico I saw a brother from he's up in his 80s and I look at the soldiers of tomorrow they're awesome but they need teaching we were able to be taught the correct way you didn't do it his way and I'm not sure how many of you were called to his office critical positively uh your your sermon and the reason he did is because sometimes we felt too big for our britches in other words we thought we were it and that's not the way it is he taught us to Humble ourselves in such a way that I recall that I've stated from this Pulpit I went 14 years without preaching yeah that the ministry is not all about preaching the easiest thing to do is the hardest thing to do is the administration Administration it's the hardest thing that all churches have great preachers come out the administration of the church is not there and we were taught Administration 101. Pablo Garcia Jr Garcia Jr a lot of times we leave the junior off Garcia Jr then I started looking at what we're doing in the mission field not everybody was called foreign [Applause] foreign has to be born again the pastor El Pastor has to be born again through those three processes everyone that has a role of a leader pass through those three processes you got to be justified then born again how many times should I buy should I be born again why do I have to be born again if God called me to preach has he Vindicated let's go back in the Book of Revelation because we all should know it the whole book of Revelations was written by foreign [Applause] everyone that was healed God God knew this person had to be there a little old lady wanting to hug me thinking negatively what will the people say let me tell you that could have been my mother she must have been 80 some years old then I prayed for her and what she wanted was just to touch me my hands on that day my voice not my voice that's what we seem to like Revelation that's when the Holy Spirit comes down it's the miracle from God that is pouring out so we say this Angel as he wrote who was the the person writing what was his name John one and John wrote everything he saw everything and then all of a sudden it's like everyone else this is what happens people try to worship you I've had people trying to worship me first thing I do is remember you worship God and God only Allah foreign foreign worship God Only God is a god a jealously to honor and respected our Lord Jesus Christ This is why people aren't successful the first thing they start to do they worship the wrong things I don't see his wife she's probably in Sunday school somewhere but could you imagine is worshiping says how many of you worship your husband Hermanas thank you gracias we shouldn't worship I know you say I've been part of a group that I've heard sisters he's my Lord yes you know yes I believe all husbands are there Lords on Spanish in Spanish that's not what I said with a little owl Escola please this is what happens let's try to say words that I didn't say the ones in Colombia because in Colombia the ones in Iowa the ones in Mexico wherever we have missions why you said it I didn't say it my interpreter said that's why I have to correct what is said thank you I like to listen to each word here's the Lord all right so notice Lord I can accept that but put the little L not the s and I know in Spanish you should do everything foreign but you have the Lord of lords always remember that oh I'm sorry put it on uh here's Danny every time I look at Danny you tell myself almost there so when I see Danny from the middle Danny first thing I do is look at his brand new truck it's a nice looking older truck right uh that's I mean type truck do you imagine can we worship a car yeah see very it's easy to worship something do men worship women when the angel said don't worship me worship him we need to start putting that in our vocabulary Worship the Lord Jesus Christ and that's what the angel said yes we see many people today we understand that the angel of the church is the pasture the one we worship is the Lord Jesus Christ is that what he said what did he say open to all the world that's why I said not everyone was called foreign [Applause] we go to South America foreign to go from hotel to hotel you have Services because the law is after you because in communist countries you cannot preach religions what religion are you and they have it and I put it but the reason they want to know what you're doing in their country is because they'll go to that church they'll go to that group they'll assault the pastor in the front they'll take his money they'll take your money that's why they want to know what are you doing in a communist country so we were told go to all the world he preach the gospel demonstrate your ability to give advice is that what it says no no what does it say go into all the world the power of the Holy Spirit foreign somebody said I'll be judged again what I preachers you will be judged for what you did with the Holy Spirit that's why we testify we testify what God has done in our life not what you've done in your life what God has done in your life I have two pages of notes but when you become a new creature when you become a new creature raise your hand and you become a new creature we should all have our hands up changed yes see what happens if I revert back to what I was because I started hanging around with the wrong group of having the anointing of the Holy Spirit anointing of the people I hang around with somebody played a joke on me I'm glad nobody was here when they played it I was in a country I know the language this was maybe 2005.00 well Pastor hands me a bottle I might as well pick a new today hands me a bottle yeah and the two that understood English did not say anything to me here's the bottle I'm not going to tell you what it is but I want you to know what to drink Thomas they opened it did you take a drink no you're supposed to well I didn't do that you know Something Told Me don't drink it so I didn't drink it foreign how many of you like to drink hard liquor no no that was a good hard liquor black Daniels some Daniels then yeah Jack Daniels Jack Daniels okay I know you're many of you are apostolics little wine is good causes stimulation Thanksgiving is right around the corner right around the corner have a little bit of wine well it turned out resulta that all of a sudden I'm a always have questions I said brother what is it typical beer of the country I looked at the two brothers and I said Payback they wanted to see if I was going to drink beer do you think that's right do you think that's a good joke it's real it's real and no matter what you do it's going to be a country that's what they believe just so you know Argentina is known Argentina that certain pastors would drink a lot of wine so I told them one and one is I tell black is black white is white I believe he left the message after I told him every time I go to Argentina he's not there let's go back to the brothers because he heard the truth like I said black is black white is white and if you ever do this again you're asking for problems please it's no joke so then we say thank you we see that we testify and the devil is good to do one thing I'm testifying that God is just raise your hand God heals yosanna has to accept to accept it foreign [Applause] [Applause] things about this message business talking about it that's what gets this ministry in in the problems we shouldn't do it didn't called you to do it selected so brother Brennan said I close with this God raised the church how many churches has God raised worldwide Monday Elementary Just One More Time Lord God raised the church up to be a lighthouse raise this church is to be a light house to give out light not Darkness to give out encouraging words give out what you have the faith you have to give it to someone else give someone else a blessing it goes on to say God raised the church to be a lighthouse to the Lord Jesus Christ [Applause] the Lord Jesus Christ the only one that heals is the Lord Jesus Christ God the Healer to let his powers you can't say that to brother way he went to Phoenix Tabernacle one day and gave his testimony he's the older man that in church I don't know what he said let out his Spirit excuse me his powers he was sick raise the Dead he gave his testimony this might have been seven to eight or 79. with brother Garcia raise the Dead cast out Devils how many devils we gotta cast them out and the only way we cast them out know their name each devil Spirit can the spirit has the name live David a holy Bible sentimente preach the Full Gospel manifested and you're gonna manifestation but we begin to creep in and let down the bars we allow sin back into the church it's like Israel Israel they wanted a big guy they didn't want to be governed by the Holy Spirit they wanted a man and they chose the wrong one they told Saul to be their leader that's not what God wanted but it would be it became the permissive will of God that's all it's a soul you can't tell me we all know the stories we let down the bars we as a family well the pastor's wife does it I can do it if the Deacon's wife does it what can I do it if the minister does it why can I do it we allow sin back into the church let me tell you just so you know but like I said I won't let it don't care if you leave or not I'm not gonna let it in the day you try to bring it in I will stop you I won't send my Warriors I'll do it myself if you don't think I will you know you don't know who I am I don't play church I never have and I never will don't make that your example God told you what to do yes sir stay with that God said women let your hair grow men quit being then quit being sissified yeah but when I get home I do he doesn't know what I do at home because sooner or later your kids are going to be doing it your daughters get to be 16. your son gets to be 16. I don't want to go to church you can't force me I'll do what I want to do what are you going to do throw them out you gotta love them more let me say it again you gotta love them more you got to protect them more pray more fast so that God takes that Spirit Away but you're the example we are an example as a church we are an example I want you to stand I took 30 minutes I was going to take Danny's 10 minutes that he had left but I want you to tell yourself today we prayed for many people God was merciful yes God loves when his people become one that their cries are heard that when they Shout Out Here I Am amen help me bless me we create that atmosphere the same way Mexico City created the atmosphere we all want that blessings I want the blessings we all deserve to be blessed God
