TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and we'll call it the Methodist Church because of his method of sanctification being the second work of Grace then they made a church and today them Church man deny everything that John Wesley stood for that's Wy John Wesley preached Divine Healing amen Wesley John Wesley the baptism of the spirit am John Wesley believed in all the restoration of the gifts amen John Wesley Martin Luther many of those great men spoke in tongues and interpreted and today you speak in tongues in a Methodist Church or Lutheran Church to kick you out the door what's the matter right in the time where we ought to be placing Sons what is the matter they have adopted something else because they don't know the mystery of God and they'll never know it through a seminary let me just read something you is it all right all right let us turn over I got something down here let's find out how Paul now here here's the teacher of this message let's go to acts 95 just a minute listen how Paul got this Revelation whatever happened now in act n we start reading like this it's a Sunday School play so why not why not read it let me know when I'm out and sa yet breathing out threatening that little hooker mean slaughterings against the Disciples of the Lord went to the high priest letters to Damascus to the synagogues that if he found any I'll go look him up just Bo what I'll do but he was predestinated amen how do you know that old boot leer down there is not predestinated to Li how do you know old street walker you won't even speak to how do you know that little hand shaking outed her church wouldn't make a saint of God out of her Y and her glory how do you know she's not that's what we don't know but that's our duty like a fisherman throw a net into the sea and pulled out he brought frogs fish lizards water spiders and everything else but some of them is fish he didn't know he' just casting that that's why we do watch PA Desiring letters to the mcus to the synagogues that if he found any in this way whether they were men or women he might buy them and bring them to Jerusalem brother he was really rough and as he journeyed he came near Damas and suddenly there shined around him came a priest up the road Dr FF Jones and said to him you need a a seminary experience now son and I believe God could use you Jones wouldn't that be a horrible look scripture read like that now that's just as much sense I ain't saying that for a joke that's that's just as much sense is what we get out of it today you know your mother was a good woman I believe You' make a good preacher watch what happened and and as he journeyed he came near D and suddenly there shine around him about a light starts off [Music] Supernatural a light from heaven and he fell to the Earth and he heard a voice saying sa sa persecuted s me and he said who thou Lord and the Lord said unto him I'm Jesus whom thou persecutest as hard for thee to kick against the and he trembled and was astonished and said Lord what will thou have me do and the Lord said un him arise and go into the City and it shall be told thee what thou sh do and the man journeyed with him and went on they found a man anas down there saw Vision all superatural saw that old meany saw Vision looked in his house he was a prophet in his house praying and he saw a vision Lord spoke to him he said there's a man coming down the road over he just as blind as a back and his name is Saul The Saul of said great things don't send me I'm a little man don't send me after him he said but behold on he R down I show him a i appeared to him in the pillar of fire I struck him as as blind as he can be and I had to Blind him and te him up before I could make anything out of him see I had to turn all do you know he he was he was a great fellow in one of those churches up there he had all kind of degrees he didn't have to polish up on anything but he said what I had to do is take it all out that was the thing it wasn't give more into him but take it out of him I think that's what's a matter a lot of our cler today take out of where God can put in them the Holy Spirit take out there he said he said Lord but this this man's a terrible man he said but behold he pray now you'll go down through a certain Street you'll come to a fountain you pass that fountain on the left and you go down there be a White House knock on the door look there in the that's as far as they ever got him lay your hands up on him take him down River Damascus and Bap in the name of Jesus CA I tell you what I'm going to do he's going to have to suffer many things for me for he is my Messenger to the Gentiles well now wait a minute Lord now what school should I advise I tell you what Let's do let's read Galatians and find out just the next next chapter right back and begin at the 10th verse let's find out what school Paul went to what Seminary and whose hands is laid on him and all all T place the first chapter to save time let's begin about his conversion the 10th verse for do I now persuade man or God or do I seek to please man for if I seek yet to please man I'll be not the servant of [Music] Christ oh oh oh may I just say a little something before this here Galatians 1 get theth chapter how many knows that Paul was the one that made them people be baptized over again in Jesus name amen [Music] amen sure let's take this a little above here a though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel to you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed where did you get this gospel Paul nth verse we said before so say I now again if any man preach any other gospel to you than that which you have heard reive let him be a curse if he's an archangel if he's a bishop if he's a g overseer if he's doctor so and so whoever he is if he doesn't preach the water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ the baptism of the Holy Ghost doesn't preach the restoration of the gifts the coming of Christ all these things let him be if he tries to take any of this word here and say it was for another day and place it over on some new Fang dangle idea that we learned off in some Seminary let him be a curse let's read on see how Paul got it see how what I'm trying to say to you this morning for do I now persuade man or God or do I seek to please man for if I yet please man then I not be the servant of how can I expect anything how can a man that loves God and a preacher especially expected to anything but be hated by man man will hate you well Jesus said if they call me the Master of the House I'm the master the greatest of all of you I'm the one to perform more miracles and do more with the Holy Spirit and all of you because I got the whole fullness in me and if they call me how much more they going to call but don't take no thought watch you be saying for it will not be you that speaks it will be the father that dwells in you do the speaking at that time stay right with the word and he when he got through write in the book he said any man that'll take one word out of this book or add one word to it the same will be taken out of the book of life for him God help us to stay right with him now the next verse let me read Now read quickly now but certify let's take you to judgment I certify you Brethren that the gospel which was preached out of me is not after man neither Methodist Baptist Presbyterian or Pentecostal it was not man neither for I neither received it man neither was I taught I never received it from man no Seminary no doctor no Divinity no school of education received it that way I never taught it that way I never found it that way it never come to me that way how did it come then Paul taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ when Christ revealed himself to me that he was the son of God when that Pillar of Fire fell upon me that day I said who are you Lord he said I'm Jesus I'm G to show what what happened to him now right now if a fell had experience they want to give him 10 years to learn Greek and uh 10 more years to learn uh something else and but that time he's gone look neither received it our man neither was our tet but by the revelation of Jesus Christ ye have heard of my uh conversations and times past in the Jewish religion I was a big doctor boy I had it he was taught Gia the highest teacher that they had in the land how many knows that Gia was one of the greatest teachers yes sir had it I know all how to say the Apostles Creed and all those things you see I know how to say all the morning prayers and to bless the people how that Beyond meure then I persecute the Church of God and wasted it how did I try to stop that bunch of holy rors and I profited in the Jewish religion I was a great man boy I really I I show him I could smash him down because I killed Stevens and whole lot of other things i' done see how I done how the Beyond meure he persecuted I profit in the Jewish religion above many my equal in my own Nation being more exceedingly zealous of the tradition of the fathers now I remember not the word of God the tradition of the fathers tradition of the church in other words I just I was a Methodist to the core I was a Baptist to the core I was a Pentecostal to the Core you are I want to be God to the core that's it all right oh traditions of my fathers but when it pleased God oh Paul here you come oh Pao who separated me from my mother's womb who even brought me to this world and call me by his grace to R his son in me how is that the Holy Spirit In Me God to take me separate from give me the son which is the holy ghost in the form of the spirit in me to reveal hisself oh my I I believe I want to shout this little let me tell you brotheru God huu it God a drunker father a mother God bless you Mom I'm not say nothing against you but mother know more about God than rabbit Noto and a father that laid drunk on the streets I not even choose to go to school and long hair down my neck and everybody hated me because I was a Kentuckian over here in Indiana was just a stinking sight but it pleased God Amen it please God who separated me from the womb of my mother he might reveal his son in Me by making a minister of the word that would stay right straight visions and signs and wonders and miracles and oh my see what he's talking about it God to do that listen close to his son in me that I might preach him among the heathens immediately I conferred not with the church amen amen I never went to any bishop and asked him what I ought to do amen I never went to any Flesh and Blood any organizations or anything else I never had anything to do with them I never conferred with flesh and blood neither went to Jerusalem to all the great holy priests and holy fathers all said now you know I had a vision what must I do about I saw the Blessed Lord Jesus in The Vision they said get out of here you what's you holy ruler what's happened to you no I had all their degrees to start with and Paul said over here I can show you in the scripture that he said he had to forget everything that he ever learned and counted as nothing yes that he might know Christ neither went up to Jerusalem to them which were Apostles before me but I went to Arabia and turned again unto Damascus and after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter and ab with him 15 days and as we read on we find out that he and the Apostle Peter never seen one another in life never know one never seen one another but when they come together they were preaching the same [Music] gospel God's got a school here

word of God we're gonna continue with the same thought which our pastor gave us for the whole rest of the year it's a very nutrition title that we can see and understand the angle of any Ministry of God every Serv of God the way they bring it we can see the angle that they bring and we take it and apply it then it will be a blessing for us Genesis is one one how many of you have it in the beginning God created the heavens and the [Music] Earth and the Earth was was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God move upon the face of the waters and God said let God said let there be light and there was light and God called the day the light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day we're gonna read Isaiah 55 just listen [Music] for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are my ways sayth the Lord Your Way say say the Lord for as Heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as a rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and return it not NE thither but WTH the Earth and make it bring forth and butd that it may give forth seed to the S and bread to the eater so shall my word be that he goeth forth out of my mouth and it shall not return unto me void for it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper and the things where unto I send it God add the blessing to the reading of the word seated for a few minutes tell him God bless you give him a smile smile strong smile you know that smile has an intensity smile has an intensity it's not a good thing to like this you don't smile you don't even greet well you do forgive me I'm G to ask for forgiveness someone greets me like this I get a sign like do this amen amen because the intensity has a lot to do with it the person around God bless you you are prophesying upon that person you want abundance and prosperity so we want everything that God wants for that person to be manifested you that you apply the law that God established love sowing and raping if you give blessing you will receive a blessing you're going to receive it and multi multiply it it all depends it's up to you how you greet each other if you want to receive you have to give um like thank our pastor before anything for the confidence that he places on us to speak of what the Lord has placed in our heart we thank the Lord that he's with us as I always say let us continue praying for [Music] him practically speak on the first six months he's going to be a little busy you'll be out of town much so we'll be praying for him amen that God will strengthen him our visitors may the Lord bless you it's a pleasure to have you with us feel at home it's good to here in the house of the Lord we have one so purpose and that is to Worship the Lord Jesus Christ with all of our heart and receive the word of God which transforms our hearts I want to do something before I start sister nor I'm I'm watching you from here sister may the Lord bless you it's a pleasure to have you with us it's good to see you the fact that she's here is a victory for all of us as a church we're gonna give her an Applause to [Applause] sister it's good to have you here with us I believe that God always answers our prayers remember once again in church it makes us smile more and we're very happy came smiling to much more than normal the Lord bless you brother let us go into our thought the spoken word is the Original Seed we've been speaking on this since the year started the spoken word is the Original Seed those are the scripture that our pastor used in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void the spirit of God moved upon the face of the deep the face of the waters God had to manifest his he wanted to express the thoughts that he had to express the word had to be present to be spoken he had to come down a little bit more something came to manifestation something we were able to see small we call the anointed the anointed one he began to express God's thoughts to give shape or form to to put things that were out of order to them in order to put Darkness so that light would be manifested as we mentioned God was analyzing the situation that the Earth found itself in there was seed there God saw the value of the seed Isaiah 55 tells us that God's thoughts are higher when we Analyze This Isaiah 55 it focuses focuses on God's thoughts and then it tells us that the word comes out of my mouth shall not return void but in verse 10 of Isaiah 55 it talks to us about a process about a process it talks about God's thoughts God God's thoughts are are higher they're higher as much as say ways are higher that's why we can say we can't live higher than what we think always keep that in mind your thoughts thoughts will reflect your your thoughts will reflect your ways the thoughts will reflect who you are you can't act different than what you think you can't speak different than what you're thinking and when you speak you are just expressing your own thoughts so God he teaches us that the structure that he has God has thoughts but when God speaks the word he expresses there is a process there's time for it to come to manifest every time that God speaks the word of God will manifest itself all God is expressing what thinking and what his thinking will be expressed our problem is that we don't understand we are time creatures sometimes we speak it doesn't happen we not careful what we watch our thoughts now we're seeing the times we've been speaking on connecting God's Thoughts with the Original Seed is the spoken word God wants his thoughts to be known but God thoughts have been given out Through the Ages God's thoughts are Eternal in the church Age The Prophet says this and he is asking this question are God's thoughts Eternal if you can see that then you will understand many things God is unchangeable in essence as in his ways God is infinite in ability he knows the end from the beginning because he is God for as much God's thoughts are eternal are real God's thoughts are Eternal we could go through the ages SP about Moses Jeremiah John the Baptist we can come down all the way to Jesus the logus every one of the prophets where God's Express thoughts in their in their time so we come back to he was God's complete thought expressed then he was known as the word now notice now here say that the L God was manifested in his son and in Jesus the fullness of the godhead bodily and that Eternal being was the father manifested in flesh and through those means he obtained the title as a son so God came down in flesh through the Lord Jesus Christ he wanted to express his thoughts so he came and he man he came through the prophet to bring up part of what he was so they could express part of his but when Jesus came he was the fullness of the God God made now God was expressing his own thoughts now was God himself God having with a human being we are hugging each other God made was God above us God With Us was God With Us manifesting God we the way their God we can understand Christ is the mystery of God revealed that God had a but he had been hidden in Christ even though Christ was with him but it was still hidden because they could not accept Christ the word made flesh God began to reveal little by little thoughts began to express then God makes himself then the the only begotten the only son of God came to be manifest in the original to die to go to Calvary to pay the price for you and me then he resurrect when he the grain of and now it's proding the ano the only begot as a first one among many that takes us to another level now God's to God is always analyzing the to evaluate the the value of the seed Romans 9 9:23 St Paul he begins to speak to us and that he might make known The Riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy which he had four prepared unto Glory even us whom he had called not unto the Jews only but of the Gentiles now Jesus Christ was sent to a certain people Prophet have spoken through the times behold beh virgin shall conceive they were waiting for that prophecy to be fulfilled they were looking for the Fulfillment of the word and God came down to give them the deliverer they were waiting the Messiah came and present before them God made flesh the once again Christ the Mysteries were in the Myst were in him but it was God completely in God manifested in flesh but the people which he came to rejected him they rejected him crucified him God began to progress St Paul comes God's plan begin to the he himself himself came God himself and and separated himself among many after he died Hees and when he goes up higher promise waiting Jerusalem wait until they were with power from on High when they're obedience a lightning came ther came and among everyone that were present now God the that light the anointed the Eternal has separated himself many when God separates himself he doesn't loses hisence he doesn't lose his me he doesn't change his principles it's now God in the body of Christ with the same with the same anointing working with the same laws so now God's plan continues and we find ourselves with St Paul he had an experience just like the other Apostles and he begins to speak about a my once again hidden Mystery in Christ now was Paul Paul was Christ the Anointed God speaking through Paul and he says this even as whom he had called not the Jews only but also of the Gentiles verse 25 as I as he said also in OA I will call my people which were not my people her beloved which were not which was not the Beloved in the place where it was told and it shall come to pass that you are not my people and they shall be called the children of the Living God there was a mystery here once again God thoughts had been hidden in Christ for to be rebuilt at a determined time now Paul's speaking of a mystery here the mystery was we as Gentiles that we would have an opportunity receive the same gospel that the Jews had receiv we're not going to be like the dogs that received the crumbs off the master table because when Jesus Jesus Di there was just the crumbs that fell table but it was no longer that anymore now the mystery was being expressed the mystery that had been hidden through the times people that were not people people people that were far off people that were forgotten one that wasn't beloved she would called my beloved people that were not my people they shall be called the children of the Living God because the mystery was being declared through Christ once again Christ was expressing his thoughts God in Christ telling us a mysteries for the age because the Revelation has to come without revelation we can't understand God's thoughts Colossians 126 tells us even the mystery which had hi from ages and from Generations but is now made manifest to his Saints the mystery had been hidden but now has been revealed and made manifest to his Saints glor to whom God would have made known that is what the riches of his glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory now Paul comes and begins to tell them you were not children you were not accepted God in Christ again analyzing the situation he analy the situation forgotten people people that were Idol people that have been placed aside but God saw that disorder in that Darkness there was a seed there he saw the value of that seed for the eyes you don't have any value but for me you are my beloved you are my beloved I love you and I've made you a way back rejected now you are my beloved I have a plan for you now now Christ in us the glory of God can be manifested you the hope of glory Christ in you God is making us partakers so that the glory of God could be manifested the power of God can be manifested when Moses he going to God's presence so Anointed with God's presence that he had to cover his face so that the people wouldn't worship because his face shown by the Pres of God when God would come down and so that man could feel his presence it was just a high priest that had access to that place where the glory of God was manifested and now the priest would come would present to the people manifest the glory of God them to them God has forgiven us we are a chosen people privileged people but when Christ the word made to pay the price for our the veil was rent into now anyone could have access where God's glory is it wasn't only the high priest anymore it wasn't only a certain person whoever wanted to go have direct access enter into God's glory that's why Paul tells us expressing God's thoughts he comes and tells us all my thought are higher than your thoughts don't interpret things according to your own thoughts now Paul tells us that the way that God will the glory of God when he comes to your heart deposit his thoughts and now the glory of will be manifested among people dirty that have been reject the one that didn't have any home that one there was no home for them God comes and tells them I love them I love you I paid the price for them now I will manifest myself through them the one that was in my people now they shall be called the children of the Living God yes now the process comes and then he sends us to the time that we're living now I'm gonna skip all the ages he sends us to laa the door was open for us God comes and he analyzes the situation once what's the situation because I know that works neither are you cold or hot because you look warm warm or hot I will spill you out of my mouth rich and I have gotten Rich have need of anything miserable wretched naked and don't even know it I you to buy gold tried in fire so you can be be dressed in white gar analyzing the situation he looks at a cold age an age without hope looks only for their own they're so relaxed they don't care about the among all move the face of the waters and he looks at the age of he looks at at a dirty neither cold or hot without there's no hope for analyzing the situation but within all that disorder all that Darkness there's there children of God they need to have contact with word so they can manifest themselves then we can see that we come from eternity and we travel through and we manifest ourselves in the day which we live in now but when we go into the dimension of time he gave us a spiritual Amnesia complete loss or partial loss of memory being Eternal being children of God God's expressed thoughts of God being the redeem being the on were bought right am I speaking to someone am I speaking to you have to know that that's you are an eternal eternity is inside that you were bought God paid the price for you he did paid the price for he also paid the price value before God's eyes if God made the sacrifice the cross the calary was to redeem me and to rescue me have value before God's eyes in this Dark Age worst age that there is dark darkness there's seed there's seed there and I am part of that seed part of that seed maybe the devil has tried to take that value off of the seed de taking you to make Mist but God doesn't look at that looks at the Eternal representation that's inside of [Music] you and when we are in this Dimension we come to this age of laa inside of us there is that Eternal seed then God once again Christ the word it brings a message behold I'm at at the door and knock I'm at the door and I'm knocking if anyone hears my voice opens the door I will come with him with me now he's speaking here he is at the door but he can't open up the door the only one that open is the one inside is the one that's you're inside so then God I will express my thoughts once again I will bring my plan I will unfold what I thought since the all the prophets of the old all the saints of the ages of the Gentile they all saw that day that we living now why when God's thoughts would be fulfilled when the word would be fulfilled to the and if God's thoughts are if God's thoughts are manifested that gives us access to to God's thought and we have access to God's thoughts then The Way We Walk it's taking us directly into eternity it's no longer it's God speaking it's God Walk we stay in because in Christ is the Myster and when he speaks the mystery is revealed because God made everything good and beautiful in its time and has put eternity and in their hearts God put God put it now I will speak once I will be once again the original the grain of wheat and I will Ex because will say I have heard their cry and he comes and he sends us a Propet just like the old times did they heard the cry the people of is I will desend and he sent them Moses now once again time he heard the Cry of the he heard the cry that you had heard that you were crying out for Perfection crying out for perfection because you can be God heard that cry God heard that cry sent his thoughts to be expressed and he sent us a mighty Prophet amen amen so now this is where it gets interesting when God in the process of revealing his thoughts Ezekiel Saw it in it time e moreover he said unto me son of man eateth thou what thou findest eest eat this Ro and go speak unto the house of Israel verse two says and I opened my mouth and he caused me to eat that roll and he said unto me son of man cause thy belly to eat and fill thy vows with this role and I will give thee then I did eat it and then my mouth was as honey for sweetness sound familiar does that scripture sound familiar it's a familiar right Ezekiel Saw It the book that was sealed up Seven Seals said son of man eat what you find eat this roll I opened my mouth and he made me eat it he made me eat it and when I ate it it was sweet why because God was revealing to a secet he was giving him the so that he would write but the vision had not been revealed yet he only saw the vision and then he wrote down received the Revelation what really he had written until once again he was standing Jesus had come he paid the price he had gone to hell he G testimony to The Souls of he goes to paradise and when he gets there open up Eternal Gates the king of glory is coming when the door is open the Saints of the Old Testament see him when he seek this is the now I understand this is the one that I saw this is the Revelation now I can understand back then I only saw but now I understand that ration sweet because he just saw the he wrote the Revelation Christ rose from the dead he is the one that a within walking forward always moving forward but this automatically takes us to Revelations 10 Revelations 108 says and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which stands upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went to the angel and said said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up it shall make th belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth now wasn't going to be sweet now but it was going to Bitter the his belly why because when the revation of God's thoughts through the age which we live he sees the vision not only does he see the vision he now brings the Revelation as he brings the Revelation God's thoughts are expressed what's the purpose that we can live a higher life God thoughts and bring them to our life and apply them when it's sweet it's when we hear the Revelation but when it's better we must apply that re it tells us that we must forgive our enemies love those that doesn't love us and reject us we have to walk according to the circumstances we want to walk we don't when we have to answer because of situ we are not resp to raise our head to keep out of the water and stay alive it's now our responsibility to not Place excuses now we can't live a Christian Life can't put any more excuses because God has bring its for what heal the brokenhearted to bring sight to the BL spiritual blind and a natural blind to bring hope to bring healing healing of the healing of the spirit and healing of the body once again manifested Christ not the hope of glory and the glory of God will be manifest every time it faith is when it's hard when things are against you we all have faith when everything goes well but your faith is tested when everything goes wrong when things don't come out like you wanted to then right there God says you the hope of glory glory will be manifested when you say Lord I don't understand this I don't know why this is happening I don't understand why but one thing I your word tells me whatever I ask in thy name you would give it to us you said I want to leave you and forsake you I get a hold of that promise myself I won one or the other because I want to manifest Your Glory I want to manifest who you are bitterness doesn't have a way in my heart because you cast it out when you were in flesh if you cast out bitterness I will cast that out of my heart as well but now it's in your hands you gonna say brother you don't understand why I'm bitter you don't understand why I'm frustrated maybe I don't understand but a betterness in your life now it's your decision it's your decision you want to keep that bitterness in your if you want to be made fre because God made a way so that you can be free you have to accept it you have to take it because God is making usn the which we live he had never done this before now God had made an association with and now God and if you confess if you walk then I will move if you don't move I will not move why because I made my part now you do your I will enter as the Great and Mighty conquer to take control of the and put that dis put light in darkness why do you have to take up that responsibility will be Christ in you the hope of glory that's how it is that's the hardest thing many times we have to obey something we don't like he made a face of me I'm gonna stick my tongue out at him it's the hardest thing Revelation is beautiful right beautiful to receive the the word and but when Revelation what will take it will give us the spiritual we want to accept that that's why it's better that's why it's better please stand the musicians could come it's Christ in you the hope of glory god loved me so much God loved us so much that he sent his own son to die for us if he sent his own son to die in my place to pay the price that I had to pay why do I devalue myself and think I don't have any value before God that's why I love what the prophet said when he spoke about the women at the well that Samaritan woman everyone had rejected everyone had put her side nobody wanted to get close but when Jesus was before her he saw the condition of the woman he saw the Eternal SE morning God looking at the Eternal City within your heart he's looking at who you really are he's not looking at the condition to find he's looking at the cry that the the seed cries is what God makes when the seed begins to cry out it's like that Lily who wants to get out of that helps to get out of that that M she's the light of the sun is hitting that area and when he begins to see that light to unfold what's within her to cry out because he sees the pedal and see God face to face when you are in problems and everything is so dark you begin to cry out when you see the revelation of the word when the word goes for when the word is revealed there is something in our heart that moves you can't still you have to cry out sun is shining that se the Lord is bringing forth that se to life once again for what to redeem us to restore us to heal our hearts to give us what we need to restore our family to restore our life to give us the Holy Spirit to give us a new birth but we have to force ourselves make the effort to get out of that condition and we can see God face to face when we're in this condition time stops we go into eternity when we're in that situation just speak the word because now all things possible look at your condition at the sacrifice that he did just speak the word believe in his word and I understand that everything has been done it's an unconditional Covenant it's a love Covenant I love you I redeemed you that's why I forgave you before you even came to this earth I had forgiven you I had answered your prayer just continue crying out I will hear you I am the son of righteousness I'm trying to bring that seed to life let us pray oh Lord Jesus your word has been spoken now your word begin to change the situation in the heart of your people if someone has a broken heart you come and put those places but you give the vision so they can run behind that Vision so they can speak the word for restoration of the home for restoration of the children for the healing of the Body for the baptism of the holy spirit for whatever we need now project the vision to your people so that we we can go into eternity and as we are in that eternity that we can speak the word because the Eternal Word has no limits and it will come to manifestation you promised it we believe it thank you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen Amazing Grace
