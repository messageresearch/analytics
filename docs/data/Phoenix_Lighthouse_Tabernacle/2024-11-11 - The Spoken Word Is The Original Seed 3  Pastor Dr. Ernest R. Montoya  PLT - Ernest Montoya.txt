nightmare let me say it again we have gone from a dream an American dream a dream to have a home a dream to have a job a dream where our kids could grow [Music] up a dream for Religious Freedom these are dreams lately it has become a nightmare let me say it again it has become a nightmare because your rights as Christians we forfeited those rights to the Lord Jesus Christ this last election you will need to decide who you're going to Forfeit your rights too don't tell me don't give me an explanation don't tell me that God is in this because I'm going to tell you God is in this God chose the correct person to destroy this country the election has proved that the dragon has a voice and his voice will be heard his voice his power will destroy and your dreams will become a nightmare we need to understand that we're living in the end time brother Brenham said it in 1956 America accepts Jesus Christ or America will no longer be a democratic Nation but will be a dictatorship many of you don't know that LBJ LBJ LBJ Johnson said it correctly we're entering a new era and I cannot run for president again A year later a year and a half later President Johnson the person that took over after the assassination of Kennedy died the person they put in as a nomination was Humphrey Senator Humphrey humy he lost and the reason he lost he had too much confidence in his ability let me see it again he had the correct words he had the correct platform but he was arrogant he believed like Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton that she that he no that she and or he going back to H would win the election by popular vote they would win the election what does that have to do with today vice president Harris Harris relied on her own way did you know more Hispanics more African-Americans good percentage voted for Donald Trump Donal trp are you aware that message Believers voted for ex or I should say former president or president elect Donald Trump Donald Trump message believers they posted they posted on their Facebook Facebook they were caps caps a cap this is nonsense the last time brother Brenham ever voted was for Nixon was the last time he voted and brother Brenham said it was a rigged election rigged the [Music] machines were all rigged people were voting that had expired years so John F Kennedy won John F Kennedy what is that have to do with all the rice in China because he said it over here we see the results we're looking at the results24 so I want you to stand up now just to give you a little bit of thought food for thought so that you understand why this message so that you understand a little more this has been bothering me since oh prior to September if something bothers me then I got to research it I got to look at it not too long ago brother told me brother Bernie preached this message I was there lusting for power that's what brother Bernie entitled it on a afternoon Sunday afternoon never clicked it didn't sink into my thoughts let alone into my heart and that's what happens to us we think we have everything figured out we think we know this message we have become parrots we say it but it's hard to live it's hard to do one thing is grasp the Revelation that was given to us and give it to our families we're more entitled to ourselves and then years pass our families grow we don't know what happened I'm going to tell you what happened I left you left we left Jesus on the Wayside we spoke about him we preached about him now open your Bibles got a lot to say so I know you're not going to fall asleep today Genesis 1 1-5 if I was to give this a title craving power for a holy life in the beginning God created the Heaven the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the the light day and the Darkness he called night and in the evening and the morning were the first day let's go let's go to Genesis 111 and God said let the Earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind whose seed is in itself upon the the Earth and it was so Heavenly Father we thank you for this day enrich in our hearts with your word anoint us with your spirit we ask that you guide us protect us we know we're chosen you chose us before there was ever a start we were in your thinking that's why we're here today because you thought on each person that is sitting here what they would wear and what they would believe and accept so father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ help us this morning we dedicate Our Lives to worshiping you in spirit and Truth the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen you can take your seats before you sit before you sit shake your brother's bless them I need a blessing we all need a blessing what we need today is a little smile I got a smile a little bit more I got to say Jesus thank you for allowing me thank you for telling me that you chose me thank you for giving me power to live or try to live a holy life that's what we need today I need to understand that in the beginning when he said there would be light and it was all Darkness it was chaos and let me tell you if it was chaos back then what about today the chaos that's going around us we don't know what to believe we don't know what to do anymore the government I blame this person I blame the school I blame the churches I got to go back and look to see what I'm doing to improve these entities what have I done to improve the church what have I done to help my my kids my grand kids everything goes back to you and I as adults because we are living in chaos we've been living in chaos for years we just never saw it we were hypnotized and do not see until one day God came to the rescue God opened your eyes God opened your thinking and God said I need some light so that my son so that my daughter can experience in their heart that I am real today it'll produce something in US each promise that's written in the Bible will manifest itself in you and sooner or later that will unfold if you're weary or gloomy today you feel everyone is against you how many of you feel that way let me put my hand many times I feel gloomy I feel BL none of you am I the only one I better go to the altar because every one of us sooner or later will go through this stage not only worrying what's going to happen tomorrow now not only gloomy I need to understand that I have salvation in Jesus Christ that if I'm gloomy we heavy laden I can go I can run and he will comfort me he will give us rest that's what we need today I need to understand that my mind can only take so much and I'm either goingon to burst say things I shouldn't say because all of a sudden my faculties my mind my heart is full nobody's telling me anything positive my parents complain that I'm this that and the other no one understands what I'm going through we forget you and I that we were at that age one time they're going through the same issues the same traumas that you and I went through when we were young I've said it before and I'm going to say it again brother Brenham said it let me just put it in in quotes you speak the word you and I speak the word God will perform it that settles it I need something I got to speak it when I speak it I'm saying as a thought goes out that I want and I need something from God and what he does not you it's never been you it has always been him performing what you are thinking what you need your desire your wants all you have to do is remember one key word speak that's it how many of you believe that God or the holy spirit is a Creator how many of you believe that the holy spirit is a Creator raise your hands if you believe that the holy spirit is a Creator if the Holy Spirit creates it's a spirit creating that Spirit cannot touch you it cannot say TR and grab your neck or your color needs a person the Holy Spirit needs a vessel and you and I are that vessel you and I are those creators say Amen if you can't create let me give you example I'm tired I don't need that from you have you ever done that sister what are you talking about I thought I married a sweet innocent you're a tiger you're a lioness always growling you're creating you're creating you either create a positive living environment or you create something that is hateful and before you know it somebody will be anointed and before you know it you go to the pastor I just love our Apostle our teacher our mentor well I didn't select it you did we always select a wrong individual life that's why we have so many problems that is why in the Old Testament what they would do is they would go out they would send the number one person to go out and look for a wife for a son the same way as a tutor he would find the best tutor for his son but we forgot about that we forgot that there's someone that knows what you need but we jumped the gun I'm I'm an old lady I'm 24 years old and I'm still not married my mom got married when she was I'm just telling you we jumped the gun prematurely we want to do what our body will reflect on it may be the worst decision you make I heard our Apostle say your decision today marks your destiny let me add to that your decision today will affect your life you will live with the consequences you got to understand you break the law God will forgive you I believe that with my heart the law will not forgive those are your decisions the law we'll do one thing make you a prisoner I have a question right I got to go to my questions I got to start my message question one how many and it should say how many of us want the character of God you want the character of God I need the character of God to live a holy life because the character of God will Empower me to live a Christian Christlike life can you say Amen I'm going to go through this quickly question two let me look I got to check something out okay how many of us believe Eve wanted a relationship with the serpent she wanted a sexual relationship what if I was to tell you no she didn't she didn't want a relationship that has been put into your mind and that's what you accept that's not what the Bible teaches me lasting she was not she was craving she craved she didn't know that she was nuded she didn't know those pleasures what she wanted what controlled her was her husband but she wanted a little more than what he was showing she wanted knowledge she wanted power she wanted Authority let me say it again she didn't know that she she was nude didn't know he was nude but our Apostle told us she was seeking knowledge that's what happens to us we wer more knowledge to be recognized we want more Power Authority so that people can say wow this person was called by God with the power and the authority so it was NE never that type of relationship that every time well she ate an apple I don't know it might have been a pear Lowa loat um no a low quat where I come from is yellow uh I forgot how to say loquat it's yellow it has a little seed inside and I like to eat them green but they're very sweet so a low quad I don't know uh that's the barrier the language barrier that we have that's why God had to send an apostle someone that spoke your language so that you would understand what a low quat is that grows all over California but God by his grace gave us an individual that understood was aware of campinos workers of the field but you ask each and every one of your neighbors have you ever done this oh not me look at my nails look at my hair we have failed to understand that this econ economy that we have today was started by immigrants let me say it again it was started by immigrants Farm owners or owners of a farm didn't do anything it took a foreigner to come into the United States and work the crops they had in the 50s something called the brasero act so that immigrants could come in and work the crops that's why when you go to school and you're in the eth grade they gave you a diploma because they felt you didn't need education so you only went up to the eighth grade and that was the only ones that had a privilege to go on were people of High status now look at it we have dropouts but at the same time we have those said have an education those that are leaders question three and this is the last one how many of us are craving to live a holy life I want to see your hands if you crave just to have a holy life I do it every day I gotta be I want to be I should be holy our thoughts should be holy I don't know what the saying is my thoughts are what louder on earth oh thank you my thoughts are louder in heaven than on Earth so what you think you got to re-register because the decision like as I said in your life will either give you a holy life or a wicked life so I'm going to say it this way living in God's way living a life that reflects the Lord Jesus Christ craving for a holy life live the life he lived don't try to figure it out believe it accept it definitions Authority this is what it means to Ernie Montoya power or the right to give orders make decisions and enforce obedience anybody want Power let me let me say it this way been a lot of people wanting power let me see let me name one oh President elect it's same fluence or command thoughts opinions or behave craving you know I had a craving I always have craving I'm sorry chocolate God I also like um I like french fries in uh other countries they're called chips so when people pray forgive my thoughts forgive my expression when people pray it's been known more than once that brother Montoya may sneak up on your I don't know is that true Enoch raise your hand if that's true you know you stick your hand in there and pull one out two out before you know it you still not done with a prayer and you're done with his food is that right Danny so I have cravings What a craving is powerful desire a hunger an intense desire for something or some obsessive thinking about something or someone or doing something too much or all the time recognition you know the one that sang played the piano they're my granddaughters every month as students your little boy little girl will receive student another month if you're here and you have received that recognition just raise your if you're 100 years old just raise your hand you've never received a student of the month certificate if you have don't be embarrassed you know I I put my hand up like this for Jesus Christ I recognize he saved me but here we're dealing with recognition of your son and daughter have you ever received that certificate I never did it was before my time thanking or acknowledging someone in a way that is visible to them you know his friend wake up his friend uh would recognize people and give him a certificate so I went back looking for certificates I found two beautiful certificates 1983 or as a minister 2008 ordained as the pastor of the lighthouse by our Apostle and brother Paul certificates I I forgot I had them something that you treasure somebody recognized you and your ability let recognition you know they hey good job have you ever done that at work that was a great job you did no no uh okay Barbers what they do to you when you cut the hair the first thing they do is give you a tip the less the tip well because of what you did to them the more the tip they're happy with the work that you did recognition what do I crave what do you crave what do you crave Caleb okay did I hear that correctly obedience oh your fault no I say chewy but in reality sister you're a good cook your mom's a good cook what do I crave money popularity women I'm telling you what's out there a status do I crave something that was never for me do I crave having something that belonged to somebody else I'm telling you what Cravings are so I ask you what craving do you have people say I just can't get rid of this thought I can't get rid of this anointing an anointing of drugs an anointing of whatever we do personal desires aspiration you want status how many of you want status none of you I want the correct St is power how many of you want Power got I I already have it it's how you use that Power Authority how many of you want Authority well I married Eli excuse me sister I married Eli I wanted him to be a big shot I wanted him to have a rank the reason I say rank is um we have an old saying and this old saying if I would have been in the military with before finishing boot camp they would have made me the general it's it's not funny to you but it's funny the way it's expressed so there's somebody that looks for rank well I heard one person say I am a deacon now got power there was a brother one time he I won't mention names he I got power too that's what he said I'm like right you're not the only one with power I got power and I say that so that we can wake up there two types of power the power that God anoints us or the power that Satan gives us it's one or the other the rank that God gives us or the rank that Satan tries to recognition we talked about it a wife will want her husband to be something is not just for recognition just to say in the Church Phoenix Lighthouse I do this and I do that is number Uno so let's go on and read a little bit of brother Benham my and God could ever get a man in woman today in this Tabernacle anywhere else that will pay no attention to what's going on around them but submit themselves to the Lord as an individual unit God will lead the same man today that he led then he proves that he he proves that he's with us what we need to do is a humble humble submit submitted life submit yourself don't squeeze yourself back in other words don't go back to what you don't do nothing but lead straight to the to the Holy Spirit that's what the spirit says do do quickly whatever the Holy Spirit says do do it quickly wait for a week a year what the holy spirit says do go do it what if I haven't have went to Finland with the Holy Spirit called me over there what if I hadn't went to the hospital yesterday where that little baby was laying they're dying hadn't have went obedience is better than sacrifice do do do what the holy spirit says can you say Amen we're going to find out what we need tonight is to let loose of all are little old squeezy ideas no it has to be this way it has to be that way don't worry about it and let the Holy Spirit you are taught here to know what is right and wrong what do you taught here he said tab or some other church what do we do here you know what right and wrong is that's what you're taught to know right from wrong but what you need tonight is a great big bundle of bundle full of hate full of love of God poured out in your heart all differences how many of you have differences I don't like that Monto he takes to long let him get to the point we we are being taught right from well I don't know about you but I got to go see the football game excuse me baseball no got to go see baseball I hope that you make it tonight Mexico isn't playing soccer tonight United States he goes on bury it with the old year as it passes out all that garbage all that litter don't go back to it stay away from it let it go let's start a new life A New Beginning craving power for what to live a holy I'm craving power to live a holy life that's what we need today so that people can see what you are they can recognize you and what's inside of you the authority that we have to cast out Devils the power that we have to heal the sick that's power that's what we should be looking at like the seed whatever you plant you're going to receive whatever you plant here you're going to receive it right or wrong you're going to re receive that thought and it's going to grow and the more you think about it the uglier it gets that's part of life everyone goes through it young and old we get our thought I ain't going to do that wait till I hit 18 I'm going into the world well in reality I'm a in the world got to have a brisy a brisy a brisy come on you know a beer I don't wanto I want the real mcoy I mean they say cocacola how many of you like Coca-Cola raise your hand got you got you didn't I tell you that stuff is wrong just want to see if you're awake so remember one thing of all things that you can remember I want you to live a life worthy of the Gospel let the seed get you a false seed perverted seed H Seed and I'm almost finished this day that we're living in it's such a day of unsettled peace unsettled everywhere is it or isn't it this was preached in 1947 people are running to and fro speaking whatever they may speak most anybody can get a following no matter what you teach or think somebody will listen to them well I can have 10 wives if I want I was in Africa that was what a pastor came and asked he had 10 wives we saw the video what happened later the result I don't know if it was Manny a brother Jock's house we saw a video pastor with 10 wives could you imagine that for somebody to ask me for advice and I give it to him he takes two hours of my time and he still does what he wants to do I said what does your law say well that's why I'm asking you the law now says one wife I you better start selecting one or you going to prison later he went to prison years could you imagine 50 years in prison a slave they tell you when to eat when to get up remember I worked in a prison for young men I used to have fun with the brothers that went in there the only thing you're going to eat is what I let you eat you're going to wear what I want you to wear and at night if I you're lucky I'm going to just give you a Bible with no sheeps prison how many of you are in prison I'm in prison if we live in this world I'm subject to time and matter I'm a prisoner but one glorious day I'm going to escape that's what we're waiting for goes on and it's a day that the prophets spoke of people when they're hungry they'll eat from anywhere a hippie when I was growing up would eat garbage so what we would like to do excuse my French we would put xlx xlx I don't know come on Eli xlx laxatives you know brown little pill like this choc you put it in the little hamburger you they eat it and just watching you know you you walk away a little bit and you just watch me it then they would drink whatever you had left that was a hippie in other words our homeless people would be hippies could you imagine them eating trash but when you're hungry you'll eat anything right Eli I'm the chosen one this is what I wanted to get to I'm the chosen one who is this who's this varment who doesn't know who he is this is President elect Donald Trump let me put it this way if you don't like the man respect his office let me say it again you don't like the man respect his office you didn't vote for him respect his office Trump chosen Trump es by God who can say Amen to this nobody wants to say Amen let me tell you God chooses the right person and that person God has never destroyed anything in his life man destroys himself God chose that Dragon our Apostle taught that an image rais up from the United stes an image not a pope an image of the Pope in other way in other words his characteristics would be in a man say something against Trump what is he going to do he's going to get the militia and somebody's going to prison somebody's going to face a firing squad God chooses man for either a blessing he said God saved him from a and protected him from his assassination attempts I don't know the guy must have been awful drunk and he hits his ear somebody hits your ear that way with any type of bullet that ear is Gonna Come Off part of the ear I don't know who you tell me who was the boxer that decided to bite his opponent's ear off I don't remember I don't want to remember oh yeah Mike Tyson Mike Tyson couldn't beat the guy Iron Mike iron mic iron mic mic couldn't beat him so he bit his ear off maybe he thought it was uh you know how they have Bas and in Mexico the fruit the fruit maybe he thought it was that bit his ear off you got to remember one thing God chooses and then he Donald Trump Donald Trump proclaims himself as an American savior America let me tell you America 1956 destroyed we're just seeing the results his people said him we are come from sinning how many of you sinned come from sinning we all come from sinning Jesus sat with Sinners yes or no so he's going to sit with can I say that over again maybe it didn't click somewhere Jesus sat with Sinners so he's going to sit with Trump I don't know what they're going to talk about it's not about where Trump came from it's about where he's going and where he's going to try to take you well he's going to protect Christians in our school from all these people we don't know what they are today they look male they look female I don't know they want to compete against the women I don't know but he's going to protect that's why Christians voted for Trump Trump's campaign all the events you would have the feeling of worship service I don't know if you saw any of his campaign platform where but to some Christians it felt like a worship service you imagine that and then he goes on the former president has started a godm made Trump what does that have to do with all the rights in China Christian nationalists Embrace Trump as their savior can I say that over again Christians embraced Trump trp as the savior it's all listed read I'm sure you all can read don't you read don't you hear the news I'm sorry you don't have TVs why am I saying all this I'm going to tell you why he himself has said he was a chosen Christians have said he's a chosen anointed by God so let me tell you Trump my problem with him the first thing he said is's going to stop the war Ukraine he's going to stop within 24 hours of him being elected I think a couple days have passed 48 72 hours have the war still goes on the largest listen don't fall asleep with this because I'm going to say something that like the largest deportation is going to happen a million people yearly will be deported don't tell me and give me that religious spirit that he's not going to do it dreamers dreamers no it was an act a dream has become a nightmare you don't have papers a felony you don't have papers they stop for whatever minor infraction they have the right to deport you that's why I tell people they don't listen to me oh where you going don't don't go to that state California do not go there and they still go I'm on my way already you get caught and you deported please don't call me I gave you a warning they give you judgment cats and dogs that people eat in Iowa they're going to be deported according to him who's going to stop them lawyers anyone going against President elect Trump will be put in prison he already has people lined up including this President and his vice president will be going to jail for what he's going to find a reason I mean tell me a person that has secret documents National documents sharing it with others with other countries it's called treason why wasn't he not put in jail why was he not executed in the 50s they executed a wife and a husband for treason it happens it will happen again deportation well I just came to the United States if you don't have papers wherever you came from you're going back he's going to ship you back get in trouble he's going to ship you back well I got the Supreme Court and back of me do you they're all on his side that's why January the riots at the capital is going to be Scot free why cuz he can say I'm going to Pardon myself I'm sorry what is a pardon I keep on forg what is a Parton don't look at me that way I need to know what a pardon is well I'm still with a deportation it's going to happen unless you receive it as a pardner he has the right to Pardon all those people that were at the White House died there he's going to let him go now well the what does that have to do with anything I live in Arizona tell you AR's old number one man who was Aro I for uh profiling I forget looking at for brown people I for stopping people for no reason I forget his number one man is now the elect of Maricopa County he still has oh I'm sorry let me put it this way I'm not a racist but this is what's happening make America great brother Brenham said Amer is not the same Amer back then now look at it America cannot be restored there's only one thing left for us is Judgment we have allowed everything into the country drugs I well I guess I don't know where it started trans I forget what it's called you know the guy looks like a girl the girl looks like a guy I don't know only in a America do they allow that nonsense and the reason she didn't win she has allowed that when Trump's campaign manager said we need to put don't make fun of her start looking at what she's doing wrong and what she did wrong how many of you made a mistake in your life I made many a many mistakes but I can't live with those I continue boxing you know I did this I did that what are you going to do I got Jesus Christ on my S hold it I'm not done I was born here but if I wasn't born here let me tell you what's going to happen they're going to stop me didn't they stop me one time and I showed them who their daddy was I got something right here so I showed them their daddy immigration he got mad when somebody said they were legal they didn't have papers then I started thinking I'm a coyote he's going to really put me in jail so I got off the car and I said
