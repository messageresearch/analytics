[38:32] [Music]
[38:57] thank you for listening to us
[39:19] [Music]
[39:27] scripture that we've been reading
[39:30] hebrews 9 11.
[39:33] [Music]
[39:37] chapter 9 verse 11.
[40:04] but christ being common high priest of
[40:06] good things to come by greater and more
[40:08] perfect tabernacle not made with hands
[40:10] that is to say not of this building
[40:22] eternal
[40:24] neither by the blood of goats and caps
[40:26] but by his own blood he entered once
[40:28] into the holy place having obtained
[40:29] eternal redemption for us
[40:34] cabrillos
[40:42] for if the blood of bulls and goats and
[40:43] the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the
[40:45] unclean sanctify to the purifying of the
[40:47] flesh
[40:49] juan tomas la sangre
[41:03] how much more shall the blood of christ
[41:05] who through the eternal spirit offered
[41:06] himself without spot to god purge your
[41:08] conscience from dead works to serve the
[41:10] living god
[41:25] and for this cause he is the mediator
[41:27] for the new testament that by means of
[41:29] death for the redemption of the
[41:30] transgressions that were under the first
[41:32] testament they which are called might
[41:34] receive the promise of eternal
[41:35] inheritance
[41:39] may god add the blessing to the reading
[41:40] of his word
[41:46] and god bless each
[42:37] [Music]
[42:45] [Music]
[42:56] wherever he
[43:12] raising jesus christ taking him out of
[43:14] history and presenting them in real life
[43:18] that's why we should always be praying
[43:20] one for another especially
[43:22] especially for my pastor amen
[43:29] we're going to continue
[43:32] orlando on about what we've been
[43:34] speaking on
[43:38] i'm
[43:42] [Music]
[43:53] [Music]
[44:39] [Music]
[44:59] it makes me want to dive into their pro
[45:01] the thinking process to see how they
[45:03] structured it
[45:06] and i see how god has worked through
[45:07] them
[45:10] and so we're thankful for that
[45:14] because we have youth that stood up for
[45:16] the word of god
[45:27] greet our brothers in
[45:28] iowa colorado
[46:02] or this topic always takes us to certain
[46:03] scriptures
[46:08] but one very important one that always
[46:09] takes us to is to revelation apocalypse
[46:17] when the book was sealed with seven
[46:19] seals
[46:20] was opened
[46:24] because the lamb defeated
[47:07] talking about that scripture in
[47:08] revelation
[47:19] the line of judah the tribe of david has
[47:21] overcame
[47:37] in which they focused on the scripture
[47:38] which is all right
[47:40] he comes and asks me
[47:45] he said who is the elder that said unto
[47:47] john to not weep or cry
[47:50] when
[48:20] but seeing that to me it's like eating
[48:21] dessert
[48:24] knowing who the elder was is a dessert
[48:27] la comida principal the main dish
[48:31] is
[49:00] what is the sacrifice the significance
[49:02] what does grace mean
[49:05] what does the love of god mean
[49:07] to us
[49:14] now we've talked that there's certain
[49:15] important points that we should take
[49:17] into account
[49:19] the condition of the age in which we
[49:21] live
[49:24] the plan of god for the age we live in
[49:28] a
[49:30] understanding god's plan for me as an
[49:32] individual in the age i live in
[49:34] quebec
[49:36] knowing that we live in the age of
[49:37] laurie
[49:40] the church the church that made god
[49:42] vomiting
[50:06] because that way i can understand who my
[50:08] worst enemy is
[50:55] [Music]
[51:20] you surrender
[51:48] because
[52:16] through his
[52:57] so they all began to say what everybody
[52:58] else thought
[53:01] they thought they made up an idea
[53:04] of what they had heard
[53:06] what they had perceived
[53:10] some say you are a liar
[53:26] judge this based on a perception
[53:31] now this is a perception i want you to
[53:33] tell
[53:34] to you
[53:36] for you
[53:37] you who are with us
[53:40] who do you say
[53:59] and automatically jesus replied and gave
[54:01] a blessing to simon peter
[54:05] because he was not revealed by flesh or
[54:07] blood
[54:19] [Applause]
[54:21] we base our ideas on external
[54:23] perceptions
[54:28] on the revelation of the word of god
[54:32] obviously if peter answered
[54:36] the christ the
[56:15] have intendimiento opens your
[56:17] understanding
[56:18] you know who you are
[56:21] age you live
[56:23] what is yours
[56:25] christian the body of christ
[56:41] [Applause]
[56:56] i can see
[57:02] so the same promise i was given to peter
[57:03] is giving on to me
[57:08] the keys were given to peter
[57:38] revelation to understand what
[57:41] that god loves us
[57:45] you say brother do i need revelation to
[57:46] understand that god loves me yes brother
[57:50] for me
[57:51] if he died for me on the cross
[57:54] this is hermano branham brother
[57:58] next position
[58:00] in the message and exposition of the
[58:02] seven churches serving church ages
[58:06] now the lord god all powerful says jose
[58:08] i know
[58:12] there he's moving amongst his people
[58:17] there's the major pastor
[58:21] the pastor of the herd but does he
[58:22] maintain persecution
[58:25] refrain tribulation
[58:31] he says he doesn't do it
[58:46] is
[59:03] our prophet says that he's not refrained
[59:04] from persecution or tribulation
[59:08] he doesn't remove the trial
[59:13] he simply says i know your tribulation
[59:57] is
[1:01:22] gracias
[1:02:01] if it's possible for me not to go to the
[1:02:03] cross
[1:02:04] server
[1:02:16] at the moment
[1:03:05] [Applause]
[1:03:28] i can
[1:03:31] [Applause]
[1:03:42] is
[1:04:09] the prophet says
[1:04:51] as a son of god
[1:05:05] that's why many times we misunderstand
[1:05:20] is
[1:05:34] the amount of time you stay in that
[1:05:36] problem depends on you not on god
[1:05:41] but everything is with a purpose
[1:05:47] everything is with a purpose the prophet
[1:05:48] says
[1:05:54] has left for his church
[1:05:57] a measure of suffering
[1:06:02] so that she threw her faith in god
[1:06:05] while she suffers
[1:06:10] a stature of perfection
[1:06:12] if we don't suffer with it
[1:06:15] we cannot reign with him
[1:06:17] [Applause]
[1:06:44] god wants to see how
[1:06:59] time has a purpose for everything he
[1:07:00] does
[1:07:04] nothing happens accidentally to those
[1:07:05] who love the lord
[1:07:09] nothing happens just accidentally to
[1:07:11] those who love the lord
[1:07:43] millions and millions and millions of
[1:07:44] people
[1:07:49] hear this message but they haven't been
[1:07:50] able to hear it
[1:07:54] all you had to do was
[1:08:02] [Applause]
[1:08:06] says
[1:08:22] and god is behind every move
[1:08:24] and sometimes
[1:08:26] you think
[1:08:28] that everything is going wrong
[1:08:32] but it's up to us the prophet says
[1:08:36] in other words the prophet
[1:09:10] beginning and ending of the gentile
[1:09:11] dispensations preached in 1955
[1:09:16] victoria before you can have a victory
[1:09:19] [Applause]
[1:09:31] so we ought to be thankful for the
[1:09:33] battles
[1:09:36] we need revelations
[1:09:40] how am i going to be thankful for a
[1:09:41] battle
[1:09:42] yesterday
[1:09:44] i'm going to be thankful for a trial boy
[1:10:28] it's god giving us the opportunity to
[1:10:30] have victories
[1:10:34] don't that make you a little bit better
[1:10:36] now
[1:10:38] see the battle come along
[1:10:41] somebody's saying something bad about it
[1:10:44] sickness coming to you
[1:10:48] maybe god giving you those light
[1:10:49] afflictions
[1:10:51] that he might heal
[1:10:54] and show you his favor to you
[1:11:49] [Applause]
[1:12:26] [Applause]
[1:13:06] [Applause]
[1:13:16] is
[1:13:44] you
[1:14:16] god sends you to hell because you won't
[1:14:18] repent and take christ as your savior
[1:14:23] he had his plan
[1:14:26] he projects
[1:14:35] [Applause]
[1:14:40] species
[1:14:42] to be able to produce grace
[1:14:45] in other words la gracia grace
[1:14:49] you accept it in your life
[1:14:52] that produces a responsibility
[1:15:36] how god told him
[1:15:41] he took him out he was with a couple
[1:15:42] brothers
[1:15:44] i need to speak with you
[1:15:45] in the proxy
[1:15:46] is it in the next reunion or convention
[1:15:50] you need to be careful
[1:16:31] whatever you do i will support you
[1:16:35] just see what level of profit
[1:16:39] he said lord
[1:16:41] i forgive them
[1:16:44] i forgive them for what they're doing
[1:16:59] because i was also a sinner
[1:17:28] she says she was in a bad shape mentally
[1:17:30] and physically physically mentally
[1:17:33] physically and mentally she wasn't
[1:17:35] enough
[1:17:35] she was bad
[1:17:39] through the message we know
[1:17:45] that the reason she became an ill-famed
[1:17:46] woman
[1:17:48] was because
[1:17:51] the influence that her mother had on her
[1:17:54] influence
[1:17:55] the influence of her mother
[1:18:00] it made her to be an ill-famed woman
[1:18:06] it wasn't so much that the mother was a
[1:18:07] bad example
[1:18:32] you've had five lovers the one you're
[1:18:33] with is not even your husband and she
[1:18:34] was only 18 years old
[1:18:39] she finds herself in this bad condition
[1:18:41] mentally and physically
[1:18:46] but we know that as soon as you've seen
[1:18:48] the sign done of the messiah
[1:18:50] she said
[1:19:10] she started right quick with the
[1:19:11] responsibilities
[1:19:14] to know that if she had found it
[1:19:17] and came into the presence of god
[1:19:21] she was responsible to tell somebody
[1:19:22] else about it
[1:19:26] she left with a responsibility
[1:19:29] when the grace
[1:19:31] was extended
[1:19:34] she accepted
[1:19:48] representation
[1:19:54] [Applause]
[1:20:17] la with the life
[1:20:19] with the water
[1:20:21] that's set up
[1:20:28] i had contact with the eternal god
[1:21:26] took that word
