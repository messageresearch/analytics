gave us the portion that we have that is us we gotta fight we're going to be fighting you know i'm going to have you stand before i well do anything else we're going to go to the author and then we're going to turn to hebrews 9 11 algo contrario to your word but praise you father that you gave us a guide you sent us a messenger message that showed us there is a life that can be lived so father bless us this morning anoint our hearts anoint our ears open our understanding where we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen if you'll turn with me to hebrews 9 11 it reads as follows we're still with the whole plan of redemption we'll never get out of this i'm not sure when i really don't know so hopefully we won't take three years but i do want to spend some time um again our our thought was carriers of the hour and the bible reads as follows but christ being come and high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of of and heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh scientifically how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god juan tomas la sangre de cristo en el cual mediante el espirito turno si manchadios imperables tres conciencias muertos parque silva take your seats again carriers of the hour and when i was meditating uh last week and this week basically last week i like to answer my own questions i had a question and i'm gonna read it so that you'll know my answer but my answer or my question was who sold the human race to sin into sin again who can this world is this body is sinful especially it's hybrid it's ibrito so i need to know who sold it there's only two people all right let's start one or two it's one or the other it can be a tricky question but i'm not i don't want to you know that is a good so let's see what brother branham said think about it i want you to think it was [Applause] i want to go to slide um seven okay here we're talking about adam he knew exactly what he was doing but he did it anyway so how many of you have done something wrong you knew it was wrong you were told not to do it i mean every other day casino that should be our response we do things that we shouldn't do we know better and he goes on she was part of him part of you is your wife part of you part of your stead and he was willing to take her responsibility upon himself established the husband has to guide the wife it's not that she doesn't know what she's doing the law of god it's like you know i heard a couple amends but not a lot you see the husband esposo want you to look at your husband i want you to say i'm responsible for your actions look at your wife tv land video land and internet land internet look at your wife and say to her we are responsible for the actions the one we chose if there are good actions or bad actions in the eyes of god were responsible for her he would not let her go why she had but the serpent gave her some so much light and she loved it and because she loved it she took it to her husband the serpent told her the day you eat you're not going to die like god said you'll be like a god and he go brother branham said yes he would not let her go in other words here's adam let her go thank you is that what it says am i reading it wrong so eve conceived by him [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] why what would happen to the human race and he adam saw the human race why why did he sell us out for kendall he loved his wife today we're shopping for new cars new homes a new wife she's not doing what i tell her to do no she burns the food irritate me rita she's part of you remember you're responsible for your actions the same way adam was responsible for let me go to my questions oh question should be nope nope go back here we are i read these uh questions to you last week how many of us want to do the will of god taught [Applause] so we gotta put ourselves in a category what which one of the three we're gonna do the will of the flesh [Applause] sooner or later we will pass to the other side blessed be the name of the lord if you were selected to be translated instead of going through that process [Applause] that we dwell that's what the flesh does is i want to do this i want to do that well let's see next week uh you know it's the super bowl is the super bowl you all know super bowl right who doesn't but you know in america they have a super bowl an america super bowl and in mexico in mexico that's where you come in it's on the entrance we have a menudo bowl [Applause] fighting by other individuals find the score trying to make millions and millions of dollars and we're not making one cent you know we're glued to the television if i was to define it if we were to define it what the will of man is it's human freedom it's human freedom if you the will of man has human freedom as autonomy meaning the man you the meaning that man significant you and i are free we'll steady you're someone leaving to do whatever we please is you see by the word of god something has to control me there's constraints i limit this limits that control you limited things we should do we shouldn't do it but we don't want that we don't want constraints we want without constraints free to do whatever we want i want to come to church i'm coming to church if i want to go to a dance i'm going to get it i want to drink i want to smoke nobody's going to tell me what to do i want a joint marijuana without constraints sin restrictions without sin will surely die don't fall asleep on me no smelly i don't need a pastor you know there's a a new doctrine going out i don't know all over the place [Applause] i'm going to do whatever i want to do because i'm under the umbrella of the will of man no pasture i don't have to answer to anybody you're all silent that's a mouthful i have i don't have to answer to anyone how many of those little characteristics that i named off characters accountability does that fit our mold think about it i want to have a party get on a fiesta i'm going to have a party good time i don't care what the pastor says [Applause] it sounds bad doesn't it but that's what happens malachi 4 5. my question i'm not talking about the religious world you know i'm talking about this message of the hour and we are the barriers of the message ourselves go to the parties limited the will of god believe it or not it's the life that you live you want if we i'm i like danny because boy can he get that message going hello think about it i'm talking to everyone buddy because on mondays i've got a problem i get calls from everywhere i have to write texts everybody i'll spend maybe four or five hours their question is you know this pandemic is not pandemia uh well we see you on the internet on the internet y'all wear masks and then i go to the other station they don't wear masks they don't wear gloves why is it that you all wear masks and the first thing that comes up i'm up here uh danny first thing that comes up danny looks at all these videos videos different places in mexico just so you know the last time i looked mexico city had over 300 000 cases a day it's gone up la paz los now here's danny uh danny's an unbeliever danny is incredulous all right you're an unbeliever and i want you to tell me why do your people all wear masks tell me now what i want you to do is jump up and down like you're making fun of me mocking me jump up and down yeah doesn't ring a bell huh but that's what happens let and if they're not careful or later they're gonna mock and mock and mock and you can pray for them all you want but they're not gonna survive i'm sorry one so this brother tells me yesterday they said this is what they do to me it's the location this brother tells me we need you back here so that you can preach a message they don't want to come back to church they don't want to get their shots they're happy the way they are not going to church not listening to the messages they're content what has happened i tell them the age we're in entered their soul they're so relaxed nothing bothers them amen amen uh videolan internet i know you're gonna watch it this is the hour this is the hour please forgive me i don't do it to to make fun of people i'm doing it so you can get an understanding of what's coming javi come up here for a minute so that you don't hear from him from me you're going to hear it the bible says on that day i will separate what okay and the sheep from the goats when the tribulation is coming he's going to separate what from what in other words they all look at nike they all talk alike the rain falls on the jazz uh who's going to be burned the tears are going to be broken what about the other person the wheat what happens to them they will be taken to the storehouse you know what's happening today there's a separation between because we're going somewhere else we're not going so fast god or you wouldn't be alive who sold the human race into sin we said adam because he loved his wife i want to skip some of this my definitions we set a carrier something that indicates the existence of something else physical or spiritually our hands should be up we're not the christ we're christ and i want you to listen to this description brother branham called us little messiahs he called us amen amen and it says christ comes from the greek meaning anointed the word is the derived from the greek verb meaning to anoint in greek it was used to translate the hebrew messiah who is anointed so let me tell you one two [Applause] this morning [Applause] forward the gospel went all over the world in jerusalem it struck the whole world all nations under heaven all nations under heaven in jerusalem until the power from up high came down people would testify in their own language and they were carriers [Applause] you say why do you go to the mission fields when it's dangerous if god vindicated for us to do i got to a place where i said this was the last thing i said he was son of god of the lord and he is the word of god because he carries carrying the word of god that's that was the last thing i said how many of you are carriers of the word of god [Applause] regardless of the circumstances regardless of the difficulties do you still go when i call you regardless of your circumstances regardless of your circumstances [Applause] he may not want to go but he's gonna go [Applause] whether he feels like it whether he wants to whether whatever more you don't have a choice i'm sorry the will of man the will of the flesh the will of god it's god's speaking yes yo you and i are going to carry he never goes for foolishness he never goes for money i'm sorry danny how much money did did we get who paid for the food who paid for the hotel he doesn't go for money we don't ask for money we're here he only goes in the name of the lord and he is the word of god because he's carrying the word of the lord you too come up here well the four of you come up here now would you say there the four angels of death or are they the four angels of life they're the four messengers of life he's carrying the word of the lord he is the word of god of god is he the word is he the word of god they're doing god's word so they have to be trained each person is you're not going to get somebody that was baptized yesterday and put them behind a pulpit until brother bernie told him they put first they put apostles and then they put enrique naya and they put evangelists not my words they were those words four to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom and to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit spirit no that's not what it says there let's try that again it's right there for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit who gives it foreign we wanted to break it up more than he's correct but we're saying it the way it's written to another faith by the same spirit a lot of faith to another the working america prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues but all these workers that one and the self same spirit it's the same spirit that is anointing an with individual of wisdom oh all of that to form a basis in the basis for to one is given by the spirit and we said wisdom knowledge faith is is you're back here is carrier and we don't know it we don't know that there's again a symptom something that indicates the existence of something else physically in your body and you don't understand that you're carriers of death of sickness is and he was unaware that they had it until it's too late it goes hand in hand get up here danny get up here carlos the nine spirits of the nine spiritual gifts don't they look alike they're brought forth by a spirit oh i'm sorry it's not what i meant i guess that spirit of discernment's pretty good huh there they are are you stan one of god the other a plague the plague comes from how many variants of
