[10:41] before
[10:43] the foundations of the
[10:45] [Music]
[10:51] world that we should be holy Without

[11:51] propitiation of your SS to call you to
[11:54] reconciliation to himself to
[11:57] love
[12:07] oh wish we had just a few more minutes
[12:14] time let me before we go any further go
[12:17] back Genesis
[12:23] 126 I'll pick it up
[12:27] Wednesday when God made man before he
[12:30] made man he called himself l e l l e l h
[12:35] l l
[12:47] o eloh the word means in the Hebrew the
[12:57] self all by
[13:01] himself nothing existed before him he
[13:04] was all the existence he ever was self
[13:07] existence
[13:19] on means all
[13:22] sufficient all
[13:25] powerful allm Mighty self
[13:29] existence
[13:41] one but inesis when he made man he said
[13:45] I
[13:46] am y a h u j u v u h
[13:57] yah
[14:04] what did it
[14:06] mean am the all existence one who has
[14:10] created something all for myself to be a
[14:14] son of mine are a temporary or an am
[14:18] little one of
[14:27] mine
[14:34] why he gave
[14:37] man Jehovah means that he gave man to be
[14:41] an amateur
[14:48] God because he is Father God and he made
[14:53] a man an amateur God so he isn't
[14:55] self-existence anymore he exists with
[14:58] this
[15:12] [Music]
[15:14] family Elohim now now he is
[15:20] Jehovah Jehovah meaning the one who
[15:23] exists with his
[15:27] family
[15:30] now God made man to be the predominant
[15:35] over all the Earth he had
[15:42] dominion and the Earth was man's
[15:47] Dominion is that
[15:50] scripture then if that's his domain he
[15:53] was God over the
[15:57] Earth
[16:00] he could speak and it would be
[16:03] so he could speak this it would be
[16:11] so he
[16:14] is god
[16:16] Jehovah the one who once existed in
[16:20] self-existence but now exists with his
[16:23] family and his little ones with
[16:26] him amen there

[26:01] amen now let's read just a little
[26:04] further and then we'll have to close
[26:06] pretty
[26:12] shortly according as he chose us in him
[26:15] before the foundation of the world that
[26:18] we should be holy Without Blame before
[26:20] him and
[26:26] love
[26:32] having
[26:33] predestinated
[26:35] us unto the
[26:41] adoption predestinated unto the adoption
[26:44] of children by Jesus Christ to himself
[26:48] according to the good pleasure of his
[26:56] will
[26:59] what did he
[27:01] do he by for
[27:04] knowledge for saw us knowing that he was
[27:09] a
[27:10] savior
[27:19] self-existence there was no Ang no
[27:21] nothing just God El Elohim the
[27:25] self-existence one nothing but him
[27:34] alone but in him
[27:38] was a
[27:43] savior well what he go to save there's
[27:46] nothing
[27:50] lost knowing that then he know that this
[27:54] great attribute in him would project
[27:57] something out down there that he could
[28:07] save then when he did that by four
[28:10] knowledge he looked down and he saw
[28:12] every one that would accept
[28:23] it and then by doing so he said sa that
[28:28] the only way I can do it will be come
[28:30] down myself and be made flesh and take
[28:33] the sin of the man upon him and die for
[28:35] him that I might be the one that's
[28:51] worship because he is God the object of
[28:56] worship
[28:58] then he came down and taken upon
[29:03] himself and while he did that he did
[29:06] that that he might save you who wants to
[29:11] be
[29:21] saved do you see what I
[29:26] mean knowledge amen the infinite God who
[29:30] know all things saw the lamb and he slay
[29:35] the lamb before the foundation of the
[29:37] world and he put your name on the Lamb's
[29:40] Book of
[29:51] Life if any seen the deceitfulness of
[29:54] Satan what he would
[29:56] do
[29:59] so he put your name on
[30:02] there and he said that the an Christ
[30:05] would be so religious so good such a
[30:09] fine fellow such a smart man such a
[30:12] religious
[30:20] man that he would deceive that very
[30:24] elected if it was possible but it isn't
[30:28] impossible because her names were
[30:31] forain before the foundation of the
[30:42] world election he chose them and by
[30:46] predestination they know where they are
[30:56] going
[30:59] now who could doubt that that's what
[31:01] Paul
[31:05] said that's Paul's
[31:09] scripture that's Paul's
[31:14] writing that's what he taught his
[31:19] church the church positioning before the
[31:23] foundation of the
[31:26] world
[31:29] when God in his labor pain was bringing
[31:33] forth bringing forth you knowing what
[31:36] you would
[31:43] do he positionally placed you into his
[31:47] own body Amen to be a
[31:51] housewi to be a farmer to be a preacher
[31:55] to be a prophet to be this are to be
[31:58] that he placed you
[32:11] positionally when we have come from the
[32:14] garlic lands of Egypt through
[32:17] sanctification and baptized into the
[32:19] Promised

[32:34] Ghost amen Ephesians 4:30 says grieve
[32:37] not the holy spirit of God whereby you
[32:40] are sealed until the day of your
[32:53] Redemption then God having predestinated
[32:56] the church
[33:01] he said all the there will be Millions
[33:05] times millions that will walk very
[33:08] religious and be
[33:10] [Music]
[33:16] deceived the only ones that will not be
[33:19] deceived will be those that have come
[33:21] over into the Promised
[33:25] Land
[33:27] who before the foundation of the world
[33:29] had their names put on the Lamb's Book
[33:31] of Life and come over into the promised

[1:07:21] God thank you brother for being here
[1:07:23] with us
[1:07:25] uh the word of the Lord reads the
[1:07:29] following something very simple we'd
[1:07:31] like to speak
[1:07:33] on waiting on God for him to help
[1:07:38] us thanking Dr Montoya for the
[1:07:40] opportunity he's granted
[1:07:43] us Hing you could withstand me for a few
[1:07:46] minutes the word of the Lord reads the
[1:07:49] foll Genesis
[1:07:51] 1:1 and two amen amen
[1:07:55] amen the word of the Lord
[1:07:59] reads in the beginning God created the
[1:08:02] heavens and the
[1:08:12] Earth and the Earth was without form and
[1:08:15] void and the Darkness was upon the face
[1:08:17] of the deep and the spirit of God moved
[1:08:19] upon the face of the
[1:08:22] waters
[1:08:24] now turn the same book Genesis to
[1:08:25] chapter
[1:08:28] 8 verse 8
[1:08:34] also Genesis
[1:08:38] 88 word
[1:08:46] reads also he sent forth a dove from him
[1:08:49] to see if the waters were Abad from off
[1:08:52] the face of the ground
[1:09:12] but the dove found no rest for the soul
[1:09:14] of her foot and she returned unto him
[1:09:16] into the ark for the waters were on the
[1:09:19] face of the whole earth then he put
[1:09:21] forth his hand and took her and pulled
[1:09:23] her into him into the
[1:09:27] ark verse
[1:09:34] 10 and he stayed yet in other seven days
[1:09:37] and again he sent forth a dove out of
[1:09:39] the
[1:09:52] AR vers 11 and the Dove came into him in
[1:09:55] the evening and low in her mouth was an
[1:09:58] olive leaf pluck off so Noah knew that
[1:10:01] the waters were Abad from off the Earth
[1:10:03] amen Amen
[1:10:04] brother we take your seats we thank
[1:10:11] you very simple hoping that God may help
[1:10:13] every one of
[1:10:18] us thought I'd like to bring forth this
[1:10:22] evening
[1:10:24] title it the way it reads in Genesis 1
[1:10:27] verse
[1:10:29] two titled without form and void Amen
[1:10:37] brother we know the scripture through
[1:10:39] the revelation of the
[1:10:40] message has a double fulfillment has
[1:10:43] many
[1:10:47] fulfillments if I would give it a
[1:10:50] subtitle tile it the great
[1:10:52] search
[1:10:55] the reason why I have this
[1:10:59] thought what gets my attention is the
[1:11:02] words without form and
[1:11:05] void the word without form not having
[1:11:09] form means
[1:11:13] confusion an alteration of
[1:11:17] order means disturbances of
[1:11:21] order perturbed of discipline
[1:11:24] whether it's a group of
[1:11:27] people or meeting or community of
[1:11:31] people also meaning it's a
[1:11:35] disturbance which Alters public uh
[1:11:42] Tranquility it's an excess it's an
[1:11:47] abuse that's what the word disorderly
[1:11:49] without form
[1:11:51] means the word void
[1:11:59] lacking of context where it's physical
[1:12:01] or
[1:12:03] mental also meaning it's
[1:12:07] empty or lack of something
[1:12:12] solid void also means
[1:12:14] invain without
[1:12:17] fruit something
[1:12:22] unfinished the word void also means
[1:12:26] Idol with with
[1:12:32] empty or something that a person should
[1:12:34] have but
[1:12:37] doesn't void also means a
[1:12:43] gap like if it was a
[1:12:47] cliff or something something high and
[1:12:49] then there's there's nothing on the
[1:12:50] other
[1:12:52] side so meaning a
[1:12:55] space which lacks
[1:13:00] matter so that's how the Earth
[1:13:03] was so in the beginning the Earth was
[1:13:06] without
[1:13:07] form Earth had no
[1:13:10] form in
[1:13:14] confusion Earth was was Disturbed
[1:13:16] without
[1:13:17] [Music]
[1:13:19] discipline lots of
[1:13:22] turbulation but not only that it was
[1:13:24] also void
[1:13:27] vacant not
[1:13:28] solid without
[1:13:32] fruits it lacked
[1:13:34] matter that's how Earth was in the
[1:13:37] beginning but the Bible tells
[1:13:41] us there's two things that we need to
[1:13:43] pay attention to
[1:13:44] here that the
[1:13:47] darkness was over the face of the Earth
[1:13:52] amen but
[1:13:54] also the spirit of
[1:13:57] God moved upon the face of the
[1:14:00] waters the spirit of God is the holy
[1:14:03] spirit moved over the face of the waters
[1:14:07] Prophet tells us it was like a
[1:14:12] dove that was I was
[1:14:16] carrying watching over the Earth so it
[1:14:18] would bring forth
[1:14:20] fruit well that was in the
[1:14:22] beginning God made his
[1:14:28] creation six days his creation made it
[1:14:30] perfectly
[1:14:33] beautiful and in the fall as we heard
[1:14:35] this morning sin
[1:14:40] entered then a change on Earth
[1:14:44] began God made Earth
[1:14:48] perfect in other words from from without
[1:14:51] form and
[1:14:52] void
[1:14:54] God made something tremendous special
[1:14:55] Something
[1:14:57] Beautiful something we cannot
[1:15:00] describe for God makes things
[1:15:03] perfect Perfection was
[1:15:05] there but when sin
[1:15:09] enters it only took man 2,000
[1:15:13] years scripture
[1:15:15] reads Genesis
[1:15:17] 6 there was a great wickedness in men
[1:15:21] and their
[1:15:22] mind continually in
[1:15:25] wrong so many things on
[1:15:27] earth that the flood came
[1:15:31] correct flood
[1:15:33] comes something happens
[1:15:36] there earth once
[1:15:38] again now
[1:15:41] mankind turns back to the
[1:15:44] beginning disorderly and void
[1:15:48] correct so Noah being in the
[1:15:51] ark Let's Lose a dove
[1:15:56] that Dove types of what's happening in
[1:15:57] the beginning
[1:15:59] again the dove a symbol of the Holy
[1:16:02] Spirit flying over the flood over the
[1:16:06] waters says let the dove
[1:16:08] loose before let a raven
[1:16:11] loose when he let the Raven
[1:16:13] loose he would come and
[1:16:22] go
[1:16:26] Prophet says that the Raven was feeding
[1:16:27] himself off the rotted flesh that was on
[1:16:29] the
[1:16:31] Earth again the Earth was without form
[1:16:33] and
[1:16:36] void God sent the
[1:16:38] dove Noah a dove a
[1:16:41] type and when he doesn't send a
[1:16:45] dove when he sends a the the story
[1:16:48] history repeats again the the face of
[1:16:50] the water scripture reads
[1:16:55] that the dove did not find where he
[1:16:58] could plant himself and sit down the
[1:17:00] dove did not find where was able to to
[1:17:04] to bait on the
[1:17:08] ground the dove failed in its
[1:17:12] search for there was a
[1:17:15] disorder Earth was again
[1:17:18] vacant Earth was
[1:17:20] confused but see
[1:17:23] scripture
[1:17:26] reads that Noah wait another seven
[1:17:30] days and sent the dove again out of the
[1:17:33] Ark
[1:17:35] correct after the seven
[1:17:37] days in the evening
[1:17:39] time let's see the
[1:17:41] types the evening
[1:17:45] time the dove brought in its
[1:17:48] beak an olive
[1:17:52] leaf
[1:17:54] he had found an olive
[1:17:55] tree or an olive
[1:17:58] plant Olive we get oil
[1:18:02] from found something where the dove
[1:18:04] could
[1:18:05] rest brought evidence to the
[1:18:08] ark something tremendous it
[1:18:10] reads Noah
[1:18:12] understood that the
[1:18:14] waters were Abed from off the Earth
[1:18:19] correct
[1:18:21] correct well this was the first 2,000
[1:18:25] years now the scripture repeats
[1:18:28] itself that was in the
[1:18:31] fall so the following 2,000
[1:18:34] years history repeats itself that's
[1:18:37] right
[1:18:39] remember the Bible is not only a book
[1:18:42] but it's a prophetic book to understand
[1:18:45] what's happening
[1:18:47] today the next 2,000 years God himself
[1:18:52] Lord of Glory
[1:18:53] took a
[1:18:54] body scripture
[1:18:57] reads complete Divinity of

[1:19:17] mankind without for and
[1:19:21] void history repeating
[1:19:25] itself when Jesus walks on water
[1:19:29] remembering the type of the dove back
[1:19:33] with Noah and above the
[1:19:36] water could not

[1:20:29] follow people with the Holy
[1:20:32] Spirit In other words with a

[1:21:19] reality the time which we're living
[1:21:21] in
[1:21:23] history repeats
[1:21:25] itself but thanks to God when you read
[1:21:28] the Bible and
[1:21:30] see that the
[1:21:32] dove brings evidence when
[1:21:36] brother in the evening
[1:21:38] time the beginning of the
[1:21:41] day remember the day was cting when the
[1:21:44] sun came up to sun
[1:21:47] down complete day for
[1:21:50] them night Darkness continu
[1:21:53] the evening time at the end of the
[1:21:56] day at the End of the
[1:21:58] Age after the seven
[1:22:00] church after the seven
[1:22:03] days God sends again his
[1:22:07] Dove and continue
[1:22:11] searching but cannot find rest with's
[1:22:16] foot because now the
[1:22:19] church is without form and void it's
[1:22:23] confused
[1:22:26] perturbed
[1:22:31] Disturbed
[1:22:33] void
[1:22:35] empty it's
[1:22:37] idle without without being
[1:22:40] filled it's in in a in a
[1:22:44] cliff God's
[1:22:46] Church
[1:22:48] vacant now he calls the
[1:22:51] individual for the
[1:22:54] dove sent in these
[1:22:57] days God's grace was
[1:23:00] opened so that the
[1:23:02] church in other
[1:23:04] words God is
[1:23:06] calling
[1:23:09] individuals get out of the disorder get
[1:23:12] out of the
[1:23:13] Void
[1:23:17] the that is sent daily and is searching
[1:23:22] elders
[1:23:23] women children young
[1:23:26] people who is willing to receive the
[1:23:32] dove when you get
[1:23:34] up that's an
[1:23:37] opportunity receive the
[1:23:39] dove but it's got to be in
[1:23:43] you but you got to be in a state in the
[1:23:46] place where you're not in disorder
[1:23:49] you're not
[1:23:50] void the dove says
[1:23:53] scripture
[1:23:55] says Dove brought the evidence in it
[1:23:59] be an olive branch
[1:24:03] correct Olive Lea the scripture
[1:24:05] reads Noah
[1:24:07] understood that the
[1:24:10] waters were Abed from off the
[1:24:13] Earth what does Waters
[1:24:16] mean Revelation
[1:24:19] 175 tell us that Waters mean peoples
[1:24:23] many people Nations tongues and other
[1:24:29] words
[1:24:31] man
[1:24:33] represents Waters represent
[1:24:37] mankind human being is made
[1:24:40] up three parts of
[1:24:44] water there's lots of mankind in US
[1:24:48] scripture tells me that the
[1:24:51] dove confirmed
[1:24:52] ired that the
[1:24:55] waters had Abed from off the
[1:24:58] Earth we're also
[1:25:00] Earth the dust of the we
[1:25:04] are took from the earth and we will give
[1:25:06] back to the so we're dust and
[1:25:09] water but what the word
[1:25:11] means because the search
[1:25:15] continues Waters to be
[1:25:17] Abad or to to to to to go away for what
[1:25:23] we have much
[1:25:25] mankind lot of water we don't
[1:25:28] need what are you trying to tell me with
[1:25:33] Waters see the dove is waiting for our
[1:25:36] water to
[1:25:39] Abate to for let loose of that water for
[1:25:42] we have too much make it let me make it
[1:25:44] easier more

[1:26:22] until they
[1:26:24] leave my IDL
