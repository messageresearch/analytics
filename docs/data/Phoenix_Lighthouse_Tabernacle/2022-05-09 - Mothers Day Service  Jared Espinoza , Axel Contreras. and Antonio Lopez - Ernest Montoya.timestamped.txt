[40:35] jesus christ
[40:38] is
[41:18] is
[41:28] for his blessings and his mercy
[41:32] and this morning i've got a half year i
[41:33] could have my mother you know
[41:35] today
[41:36] not just my mother but my grandma as
[41:38] well
[41:39] and i thank god
[41:42] before anything else
[41:45] let us read our scriptures
[42:14] and she said oh my lord as thy soul
[42:16] liveth my lord i am that woman that
[42:18] stood by thee here praying unto the lord
[42:25] for this child i prayed and the lord has
[42:27] given me my petition which i asked for
[42:29] him
[42:35] therefore also i have lent him to the
[42:37] lord as long as he liveth he shall be
[42:39] lent to the lord and he worshipped the
[42:41] lord there
[42:54] it's one that we've heard many times
[42:55] very often
[43:03] train up a child in the way he should go
[43:06] and when he is old he will not depart
[43:08] from it
[43:09] look
[43:23] another year which we can celebrate this
[43:32] [Music]
[43:38] and above all
[43:51] amen amen
[44:00] [Music]
[44:17] i think that is what every mother wants
[44:20] their sons
[45:02] compared to others who are out there
[45:05] um
[45:11] or how can i repay her
[45:14] with nothing
[45:28] but i believe what she has taught me
[45:33] it might be one of those things that may
[45:35] be able to repay a little bit
[45:37] for me because i know she asked for me a
[45:39] prayer for me
[45:41] he's going to continue asking for me
[45:44] and whatever
[46:12] is
[46:18] and so a good praying wife or mother can
[46:21] do more for the kingdom of god on her
[46:23] knees at home than sometimes a preacher
[46:25] can do on that platform that's
[46:39] my parents have taught me
[46:53] she's more attentive of the children
[46:55] what they should do
[46:57] and i thank god for that
[47:02] this is very powerful
[47:06] because it says i'm going to repeat it
[47:07] once again
[47:15] then sometimes a preacher can do on the
[47:17] platform
[47:21] a mother always asks for her children or
[47:23] her son
[47:28] and we know a mother's love is the
[47:30] nearest thing to the love of god
[47:33] in a man because she has shown me that
[47:35] you know what
[47:47] and i want to show it but how
[48:02] the person always comes to mind look at
[48:03] me send me imagine it's what my mom
[48:18] that's how the voice of my mother is as
[48:19] well
[48:21] reminding me to do what is good
[48:25] what comes to mind
[48:27] is to always do what my parents are
[48:29] talking about
[48:30] what my mother has
[48:46] because she wants to give them
[48:47] everything
[48:49] and everything is the kingdom of god
[48:52] and show them the way
[48:54] and be assured that they get there
[48:59] that's the best thing a mother can can
[49:00] do i imagine
[49:04] in showing her what she has taught me
[49:07] something that has stuck with me
[49:13] i know she comes she's joyful seeing me
[49:16] up here
[49:17] and i thank god
[49:23] [Music]
[49:24] i here have another quote that i would
[49:25] like to mention
[49:29] it's from the philadelphia church
[49:39] now i just got a short piece of history
[49:41] here on the messenger for tonight of
[49:42] john
[49:56] he was born on june the 17th 1703 in
[49:59] epworth rectory england
[50:04] he was the 15th child of 19 children
[50:08] wesley john and susana wesley
[50:32] and here i'd like to focus on this a
[50:34] mother a consecrated saint although with
[50:36] 19 children to take care of she found
[50:38] much time through her busy day to teach
[50:40] her children bible lessons and bible
[50:42] stories and pray for them
[50:46] that's what made the boys what they were
[51:01] the great songwriter charles his brother
[51:03] who gave the world some of the most
[51:04] inspiring songs we've ever had
[51:17] even though his father was the minister
[51:18] or the preacher
[51:35] that's john wesley john wesley
[51:42] that john wesley was who he was because
[51:44] of the teachings of his mother and the
[51:45] prayers of his mother
[51:48] abraham lincoln and they talk a lot
[51:49] about our president abraham lincoln
[51:52] and about his mother
[51:55] and juan wesley i wanted to focus on
[51:57] john wesley mama and his mother
[52:02] because in the way that she asked for
[52:03] them
[52:04] the way she raised them
[52:07] all 19 children
[52:09] i see they all came out well
[52:14] just because the prayers of a mother
[52:16] i love
[52:33] i really have to show that i'm thankful
[52:35] for the mother i have a mafia a loyal
[52:38] mother santa holy
[52:40] you know
[52:41] full of love for me for me for mr manos
[52:44] for my brothers
[53:10] she knows what i don't like and what i
[53:11] do like not just her sons and not just
[53:13] her sons but also my dad
[53:17] and it's something like that you can be
[53:18] very thankful
[53:21] because maybe she doesn't like something
[53:23] but because of that love
[53:27] she makes what her family likes best
[53:31] i also like to thank god for me
[53:33] for my grandma
[53:36] in the way she raised my mother and her
[53:38] children
[53:55] and they were where they're are where
[53:56] they're at today
[54:01] i see my grandma as a as a woman of god
[54:05] that's how i see my mother
[54:07] a reflection of my mother of my
[54:08] grandmother
[54:28] to maybe just show her that i do like i
[54:31] do believe what she does
[54:34] and just repay her just a little bit
[54:36] for
[54:51] happy mother's day to all the mothers
[54:53] [Applause]
[55:03] god bless
[55:04] you i greet you all in the name of the
[55:06] lord jesus christ
[55:09] um i was very very surprised to hear
[55:12] that i was going to be talking a little
[55:13] bit today
[55:17] considering i usually like to hide
[55:33] uh
[55:33] and uh just talk to you a little bit
[55:35] about
[55:36] mothers and a little bit about my mother
[55:38] opportunity
[55:42] first and foremost uh mom where are you
[55:52] [Applause]
[55:57] that is the
[55:58] woman uh islam that raised
[56:09] [Music]
[56:13] maybe like around 12 i believe
[56:17] my mom had the
[56:19] unfortunate task
[56:24] of being
[56:26] playing both roles of mother and father
[56:33] i mean i remember when we first moved
[56:35] here to arizona it was it was a little
[56:37] difficult
[56:42] i mean i was i was small i was 12 again
[56:44] like i said and she was
[56:46] she she had just moved here she had no
[56:48] job i mean we really had had nothing
[56:56] i mean thankfully we had family here
[56:58] that helped us out of course
[57:03] but my mother struggled a lot
[57:06] and now that i'm older and i can see
[57:08] that
[57:18] because
[57:20] now that i'm older and i'm working and
[57:22] i'm doing all these all these uh
[57:37] and i mean if it was i think i think to
[57:39] myself if i think it's hard for me
[57:44] for me
[57:45] i believe it was about 20 times harder
[57:48] for me
[57:52] so
[57:53] i mean
[57:54] thank you mom
[57:58] um
[57:59] i'd like to
[58:00] i have some uh quotes here from
[58:03] a message uh brother branham preached on
[58:05] mother's day in 1959.
[58:13] um
[58:13] [Music]
[58:15] okay so first one would be
[58:18] okay mother is so great
[58:34] she's the first in this life to hold you
[58:38] when you're born she's one of the first
[58:40] hands to touch you and to wipe the tears
[58:43] out of your face
[58:57] now i think that there is not enough
[58:59] honor that we could give to a mother
[59:06] and i believe that there is nothing that
[59:07] i could do that could possibly repay
[59:09] everything my mom's been through
[59:14] just to get me to get me and and my
[59:17] siblings to the to the spot that we are
[59:19] now you know
[59:24] the sacrifices that were made
[59:28] and i understand that there's sacrifices
[59:31] there's things that there always need to
[59:33] be
[59:36] decisions that always need to be made
[59:42] and and some are very hard
[59:46] but
[59:47] i believe that my mother took the the
[59:48] decisions that were best for us
[59:54] because if it weren't for her i would
[59:55] probably not be standing here today
[1:00:12] proverbs chapter 6
[1:00:16] capitulo says verse 20 through 23.
[1:00:20] reads as such
[1:00:22] my son keep thy father's commandment
[1:00:25] and forsake not thy law the law of thy
[1:00:28] mother.
[1:00:34] bind them continually upon thine heart
[1:00:37] and tie them about thy neck at all
[1:00:40] in la
[1:00:42] when thou goest it shall lead thee
[1:00:45] when thou sleepest it shall keep thee
[1:00:48] and when thou awakest it shall talk with
[1:00:51] thee
[1:00:57] for the commandment is lamp
[1:00:59] and the law is light
[1:01:01] and reproofs of instruction are the way
[1:01:04] of life
[1:01:11] so i think one of the things that come
[1:01:12] to mind when i read that
[1:01:16] i kind of just picture it as as i'm
[1:01:18] walking
[1:01:21] through this dark narrow path
[1:01:25] which
[1:01:26] let's we we should say that you know the
[1:01:28] path being life
[1:01:32] and and our parents
[1:01:34] in this in this scripture
[1:01:45] because i
[1:01:46] if you think about it casino
[1:01:48] i mean you're your parents fathers
[1:01:55] um
[1:01:57] and then you kind of have to uh go off
[1:01:59] of that and then
[1:02:01] you know live your life based off what
[1:02:03] they teach you hello
[1:02:08] and
[1:02:11] and i mean brother branham says right
[1:02:12] here and again in the scripture and in
[1:02:14] his message of mother's day
[1:02:18] mother is first with the child
[1:02:22] and she is a great responsibility of
[1:02:25] what that child will be
[1:02:27] responsible
[1:02:29] mother has a responsibility from god it
[1:02:32] is
[1:02:38] and that's why i think mother has a
[1:02:40] special little touch
[1:02:46] special
[1:02:48] i believe i i don't remember where i
[1:02:50] heard it said but um
[1:02:55] but i remember uh brothers said
[1:02:58] that a mother's love is god's love
[1:03:11] if the seas were ink and the skies were
[1:03:13] paper
[1:03:14] and god would write about his love
[1:03:17] it would not it would not finish there
[1:03:18] would be no end to it
[1:03:23] inc the seas were inc
[1:03:25] and the skies were papers
[1:03:29] he foreign and he just kept writing
[1:03:31] about his love it would not run out
[1:03:36] there'd be no end so i believe that a
[1:03:38] mother's love is exactly the same
[1:03:42] there was a story i heard about a mother
[1:03:44] who was an accident in an accident with
[1:03:46] her kids a car accident
[1:03:48] [Music]
[1:03:49] an accident the automobiles
[1:03:52] the car was upside down and
[1:03:55] and the mother was able to get out but
[1:03:56] the children were still in the car
[1:04:00] [Music]
[1:04:02] um firefighters showed up
[1:04:06] the cars the doors would not open they
[1:04:09] could not get the children
[1:04:14] and the mother out of desperation out of
[1:04:16] out of just wanting to have her kids
[1:04:18] back
[1:04:23] because even the firefighters have this
[1:04:25] apparatus called the jaws of life
[1:04:35] sorry they're pretty much just really
[1:04:37] big tweezers that cut through metal that
[1:04:39] can cut through metal
[1:04:44] and the firefighters couldn't get the
[1:04:45] kids out
[1:04:48] and the mother out of out of just pure
[1:04:50] desperation
[1:04:52] went to the car
[1:04:54] and yanked the door right off
[1:04:57] was able to grab her kids
[1:04:59] carlos
[1:05:00] so so that's i think i think that that
[1:05:03] mothers are our real real special uh
[1:05:06] blessing that god you know decided to to
[1:05:09] give us
[1:05:14] i don't deserve my mother you know you
[1:05:15] know
[1:05:16] me mother but i'm very very grateful
[1:05:18] that
[1:05:20] she is
[1:05:21] my mom
[1:05:25] and i'm i believe it was here my brother
[1:05:27] joe that said
[1:05:29] uh god gave us
[1:05:31] the uh
[1:05:33] the parents that are right for us
[1:05:39] that know that know exactly what to do
[1:05:41] with us so that
[1:05:43] we may turn out all right
[1:05:47] here
[1:06:02] not send her a bunch of flowers
[1:06:07] but love her but
[1:06:09] care for her
[1:06:13] talk to her
[1:06:16] care for her 306
[1:06:18] days and nights
[1:06:23] she would appreciate it a lot
[1:06:27] sit down and talk to her just a little
[1:06:29] bit
[1:06:30] so
[1:06:34] [Music]
[1:06:45] these these are things that that they're
[1:06:47] really not hard but
[1:06:49] i find myself that i i miss yes
[1:06:57] but i believe
[1:06:59] that you know every day we should we
[1:07:01] should do better
[1:07:05] so just doing those small little things
[1:07:07] i believe would uh
[1:07:09] would do them a lot of good
[1:07:12] questions
[1:07:21] and sometimes i get home i don't even
[1:07:23] want to talk to anybody
[1:07:26] i don't want to
[1:07:40] spend time with my mother because she's
[1:07:42] she's
[1:07:43] all i have
[1:07:47] and
[1:07:48] we as her kids are all she has
[1:07:53] so i believe it's it's our job as as as
[1:07:56] uh their children to take care of them
[1:08:02] and look how i look at after them
[1:08:05] because unfortunately
[1:08:08] it is a little sad but they they won't
[1:08:10] be here forever
[1:08:13] so love them as if it was the last day
[1:08:20] but um
[1:08:24] yeah just keep going strong
[1:08:28] that's right
[1:08:30] um
[1:08:32] i believe my time is up
[1:08:36] thank you so much for your time
[1:08:38] god bless you
[1:08:40] and happy mother's day
[1:08:42] [Applause]
[1:09:02] lord jesus christ
[1:09:09] they asked me to speak a little bit
[1:09:10] about mother's day
[1:09:13] it's a great honor to be here
[1:09:30] god bless all the brothers who are
[1:09:31] watching us via internet
[1:09:35] and so to begin
[1:09:39] i like to mention that having a mother
[1:09:41] especially it's something very special
[1:09:57] they not stop thinking about all the
[1:09:58] things they have done
[1:10:00] is our
[1:10:28] there were about two million children
[1:10:29] who grew up without a mother
[1:10:35] that would have been about three percent
[1:10:36] of the population here in the united
[1:10:37] states
[1:10:57] which is about four percent
[1:10:59] and that's very sad
[1:11:04] because a mother is something so
[1:11:05] important to a child
[1:11:09] that when a son or daughter
[1:11:12] doesn't have their mother by their side
[1:11:14] [Music]
[1:11:21] it's the scientists say that it's very
[1:11:22] difficult for them to find a substitute
[1:11:49] it has long-term effects on their
[1:11:51] self-esteem
[1:12:10] that's something that the young man or
[1:12:12] young lady starts to experience later on
[1:12:13] in their life
[1:12:18] that's the only reason is because they
[1:12:19] didn't have that guidance of a mother in
[1:12:21] the beginning
[1:12:24] so we have to thank our mothers
[1:12:28] everything they do for us each every day
[1:12:31] [Music]
[1:12:34] i don't see my mother here on to today
[1:12:37] i know she's watching through internet
[1:12:41] i want to say god bless you
[1:12:46] it's one of the greatest things god has
[1:12:48] given me
[1:13:14] the good thing is that god knows all
[1:13:15] things
[1:13:40] if you're fortunate enough today to have
[1:13:41] a daddy and a mother living amelos love
[1:13:44] them
[1:13:53] the hour will come when you'll think
[1:13:54] they're the greatest people in the world
[1:14:12] and don't ever little fellows don't ever
[1:14:14] give this slandering word
[1:14:19] old man or old woman
[1:14:24] that's not the old man and old woman yes
[1:14:56] today can be the last day
[1:15:01] the last day they say some loving words
[1:15:02] to your mother
[1:15:05] and we take it lightly
[1:15:08] we won't do anything
[1:15:31] you have hear them lower down in the
[1:15:33] ground the pastors say denise alas
[1:16:23] and now in the best flower you could
[1:16:25] give them is obey them
[1:16:29] and that's the first promise in the
[1:16:30] bible
[1:16:46] as we know you can find that scripture
[1:16:47] in the book of exodus
[1:16:49] [Music]
[1:16:57] they don't just work during the day
[1:17:00] they also work at
[1:17:14] one
[1:18:37] we still don't have much experience
[1:18:52] giving our mothers flowers
[1:18:55] and gifts on them on mother's day
[1:18:58] that is very good
[1:19:01] [Music]
[1:19:04] but this isn't the only day we should do
[1:19:05] it
[1:19:47] abraham lincoln and i saw the quote from
[1:19:49] abraham lincoln
[1:19:51] [Music]
[1:19:57] if there's anything that i want to give
[1:19:59] praise to or my life was influenced by
[1:20:02] where
[1:20:08] was a godly mother who taught me to pray
[1:20:10] and to know jesus as my savior
[1:20:16] i believe that all the young ones here
[1:20:18] that's something they can say
[1:20:22] our mother has taught us to follow the
[1:20:24] lord
[1:20:26] it's a great blessing
[1:20:45] uh
[1:20:47] is george washington which is george
[1:20:49] washington
[1:20:54] my mother was the most beautiful woman i
[1:20:57] ever saw
[1:21:10] i attribute all my success in life to
[1:21:12] the moral intellectual and physical
[1:21:14] education i received from her
[1:21:18] we all know these two presidents
[1:21:24] we know the great things they both did
[1:21:25] when they were president
[1:21:27] [Music]
[1:21:33] and they said that their mother was the
[1:21:34] greatest thing that helped them do what
[1:21:36] they did
[1:21:38] so brothers
[1:21:40] let's do the same
[1:21:57] we first have to do these basic things
[1:22:00] to honor our fathers
[1:22:02] and our mother
[1:22:06] everything turns out fine
[1:22:21] so we can be successful
[1:22:25] because they're based on their founding
[1:22:26] on the word of god
[1:22:29] in the word of god we know is perfect we
[1:22:31] know it's perfect
[1:22:34] that's nothing better
[1:22:35] it doesn't change
[1:22:50] like this
[1:22:53] [Music]
[1:23:07] but that does not mean that i do not
[1:23:08] feel how much i love you
[1:23:10] [Music]
[1:23:14] how much i appreciate you and how
[1:23:15] important you are in my life
[1:23:21] your love guidance and correction is
[1:23:23] priceless
[1:23:30] and all the money in the world would not
[1:23:32] be enough to buy such genuine love
[1:23:37] although many times i was rebellious
[1:23:42] it doesn't hurt
[1:23:46] [Laughter]
[1:23:50] [Music]
[1:24:42] physically and spiritually
[1:24:45] it helps us move on in the path of god
[1:24:49] that nothing can get in our way
[1:24:55] we can only just be obedient towards our
[1:24:56] parents
[1:24:58] problems we wouldn't have so many
[1:25:00] problems
[1:25:03] because they already went through so
[1:25:04] many things
[1:25:07] they already went through things that
[1:25:08] we're going through
[1:25:14] and we know that if we do it a certain
[1:25:15] way we can avoid so many problems
[1:25:18] amen
[1:25:20] so thank you thank you a lot brothers
[1:25:23] for your
[1:25:24] attention may god bless you
[1:25:28] and thank you
[1:25:30] [Applause]
