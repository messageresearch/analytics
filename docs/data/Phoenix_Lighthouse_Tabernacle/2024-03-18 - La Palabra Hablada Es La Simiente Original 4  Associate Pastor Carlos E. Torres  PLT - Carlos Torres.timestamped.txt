[13:54] before we approach the
[13:58] word
[14:01] our heavenly
[14:03] father thou the Living
[14:06] God ever
[14:12] alive the Sun that just went down that
[14:16] same Sun Daniel looked at it when it
[14:23] set Jeremiah looked at it
[14:26] setting Adam looked at it setting
[14:29] Jesus looked at it
[14:37] setting and it's the same world that
[14:40] they lived in and walked in and you
[14:43] still remain the same
[14:53] God tonight there's many
[14:57] requests a man with tumor on the
[15:00] brain a sister fears the same
[15:08] thing you're the only hope Lord there is
[15:11] for
[15:15] that that tumor has become malignant
[15:18] there's nothing can be
[15:22] stopped it's way out of the reach of the
[15:25] hands of the
[15:27] doctor
[15:31] but tonight we go with our little sling
[15:33] shot after that
[15:34] lamb to bring it back to
[15:44] father in the name of the Lord Jesus we
[15:47] direct our prayer to slay the line the
[15:51] tumor the
[15:53] malignancy safely to bring them to the
[15:57] f
[16:06] God do remember tonight our lovely
[16:09] president brother our Dwight
[16:13] Eisenhower
[16:20] know he has gued the land lord he's
[16:23] tried to keep us out of
[16:27] War
[16:30] he promised the Korean War would end if
[16:33] he had any way
[16:38] he could he promise those mothers he'd
[16:41] bring those boys
[16:46] back but he said for me to do it I can't
[16:49] do it I can put my efforts but God Alone
[16:52] will have to do
[16:57] it
[16:59] you with him Lord and now it's all
[17:01] settled
[17:04] up why couldn't they SE that in the
[17:07] first
[17:09] place God I pray that you help
[17:14] him bless that Gallant soul
[17:19] lord and we pray that you'll choose for
[17:22] us the leader that is to be
[17:27] next
[17:29] your predestinated will be done
[17:34] Lord but the one that we are so
[17:37] interested in tonight besides our
[17:39] national Affairs is that great and
[17:42] glorious one that's coming to set up a
[17:45] kingdom that will have no
[17:47] end the lord Jesus thy
[17:57] son

[18:18] fruit of them they'll build houses and
[18:21] have
[18:25] them there never be no more trouble than
[18:32] then bless us now as we approach the
[18:38] word father thou knowest the reason that
[18:41] I'm approaching the word from this very
[18:43] scripture

[18:54] want me to do it this
[18:57] way
[19:00] that it's your Divine will it's in your
[19:02] order it's in the it's the order of the
[19:05] day to let the people positionally find
[19:08] their place be ready for the hour of
[19:21] battle our brother said in his prayer to
[19:24] you not long ago oh you have trained us
[19:27] so long Lord

[19:41] ranks put us out there to what we're
[19:43] supposed to do so we can be about the
[19:47] father's
[19:52] bus for we ask it in Jesus name thy son
[19:57] amen

[20:07] afternoon talking to a famous doctor
[20:11] Lille his nurse
[20:20] must heard about glorious things of the
[20:23] Lord her father as a
[20:27] doctor
[20:30] she came over and sat in my room most
[20:32] the afternoon just come in dropped in
[20:35] wonderful
[20:44] person brother a little hard you know
[20:47] kind of a staunch real Presbyterian to
[20:50] start with but left with tears running
[20:53] down her
[20:57] cheeks
[21:05] God
[21:07] everywhere offices and
[21:15] nurses I don't believe there's a nurse
[21:17] in n's Infirmary Hospital that I didn't
[21:20] testify to about having the Holy Ghost
[21:22] and
[21:27] ask
[21:36] a doctor I come in contact with
[21:44] anywhere tell them about it a got much
[21:47] time
[21:50] brother no matter how hard seems here
[21:52] just wait till you cross that last
[21:54] breath Y and see and you wish you had
[21:56] done it yes sir
[22:03] don't wait till that time let's do it
[22:05] right
[22:08] now this is the
[22:10] hour all they might disagree and F and
[22:13] fuss a little about it but they don't
[22:15] mean
[22:20] it they really don't mean it they're
[22:27] all and they go to fussing at you just
[22:30] just remember they they don't really
[22:32] mean it they don't mean
[22:40] it they just maybe been taught something
[22:43] they just hang to that so you you can
[22:46] see their
[22:52] idea don't fuss with them don't fuss
[22:55] with no one but just love them right
[22:57] into it
[23:08] for well I think we got down to the
[23:11] ninth verse I'm not
[23:16] sure that's a long way from the third
[23:19] chapter isn't
[23:27] it Honey in the Rock to
[23:33] me we were speaking now remember so we
[23:37] can get a little backgr
[23:44] again brother nille you you pull me a
[23:47] little bit now I failed to see the time
[23:49] getting away so I can have prayer for
[23:51] the
[23:57] sick
[24:01] we want to get every little spe that we
[24:05] [Music]
[24:07] can tonight I want an alar
[24:14] call ending up on this which I'll may be
[24:17] able just to read the rest of
[24:22] it but the purpose of this is seeing
[24:27] your position in
[24:33] Christ seeing that it's not something
[24:36] that
[24:37] you just stumbled into or something that
[24:41] might have you merited somewhere but
[24:43] it's what God did for you
[24:57] himself that you were so good that you
[25:00] went to a church one
[25:02] night that some poor brother LED you up
[25:05] to the
[25:11] altar it wasn't that it was God before
[25:15] the foundation of the world
[25:16] predestinated you to eternal
[25:24] life when you get there that day no
[25:27] wonder the 4y 24 Elders laid off their
[25:37] crowns everybody laid down their Crown
[25:40] everyone fell on their
[25:45] faces they didn't have one thing that
[25:47] could say no preacher no Elder no
[25:55] nothing all praise to the lamb
[26:02] amen God will gather in him all things
[26:06] at that
[26:10] day or if we' ever know and recognize
[26:13] who that was who they
[26:21] crucify now only we start at the eth ver
[26:25] to get a little
[26:27] background
[26:31] wherein he has abounded towards us in
[26:33] all wisdom and
[26:40] Prudence having made known to us the
[26:43] mystery of his
[26:48] will the
[26:50] mysteries of his
[26:56] will remember how we hung on
[27:00] that how many was here this morning
[27:03] let's
[27:06] see how we stuck on that the mystery of
[27:11] his
[27:16] will now it is not just a little thing
[27:19] then it's a
[27:24] mystery God's will is a
[27:27] mystery my and each man has to seek out
[27:31] the will of God for his or
[27:34] herself God's
[27:41] my how do we find out was known to
[27:47] him he said he didn't confer with any
[27:50] man no Flesh and
[27:54] Blood he went to no school no Seminary
[27:57] had nothing to do with
[28:02] it but he it was revealed to him by
[28:07] Jesus
[28:11] Christ who met him on the road to
[28:13] Damascus in a a light like a pillar of
[28:17] fire and it called
[28:25] him and he went to Arabia and there
[28:29] dwelt three
[28:33] years oh don't you imagine that
[28:41] brother years down there in Arabia red
[28:45] in a little building somewhere walking
[28:48] up and down
[28:54] the all the old Scrolls they didn't have
[28:57] the new ones
[28:58] PA
[29:06] wrote right these old Scrolls how that
[29:10] God at the beginning predestinated us
[29:20] unto he would Jesus that through this
[29:23] sacrifice we' all have a right to the
[29:26] Tree of Life
[29:39] those called Already Justified those who
[29:43] Justified he already
[29:52] gled God since the beginning of the
[29:55] world predestinated us to the adoption
[29:57] of son
[30:02] now the whole creation gring waiting for
[30:05] the manifestation of the sons of
[30:14] God oh I imagine Paul had a wonderful
[30:20] time I like to been there with him
[30:22] wouldn't
[30:25] you now he said he made to us the
[30:34] myy get the Holy Spirit on you sometime
[30:37] and start running that and just watch
[30:39] how it
[30:46] goes this afternoon I had all about 30
[30:50] minutes to study just to look the lesson
[30:53] over maybe not I I'll say half of that
[30:55] 15 minutes between the time
[31:10] and I got run and I thought
[31:13] theery how
[31:20] mysterious and the scripture packed me
[31:22] back into the Old Testament then back
[31:26] over into the new test
[31:35] something together see the mystery of
[31:39] his coming the mystery of his will the
[31:42] mystery of the setting
[31:49] together remember it cannot be taught in
[31:54] any
[31:56] Seminary
[32:01] it's a
[32:03] mystery you cannot know it by education
[32:06] by
[32:06] [Music]
[32:10] theology it's a mystery that's been
[32:12] hidden since the foundation of the
[32:15] world waiting for the
[32:19] manifestations of the sons of
[32:26] God

[1:05:30] hands in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:05:32] Christ am amen and
[1:05:37] amen before anything else let it go to
[1:05:39] the word of
[1:05:41] God Genesis
[1:05:49] 1is Genesis 1 verse
[1:05:54] 1
[1:05:56] it reads the following way in the name
[1:05:57] of the Lord Jesus
[1:06:00] Christ in the beginning God created the
[1:06:03] Heaven and the
[1:06:13] Earth and the Earth was without form and
[1:06:15] void and darkness was upon the face of
[1:06:17] the deep and the spirit of God moved
[1:06:19] upon the face of the
[1:06:23] waters and God said let there be light
[1:06:26] and there was
[1:06:30] light and God saw the light that it was
[1:06:33] good and God divided the light from the
[1:06:41] darkness and God called the light day
[1:06:43] and the Darkness he called night and the
[1:06:45] evening and the morning were the first
[1:06:48] [Music]
[1:06:49] day may God add the blessing to the
[1:06:51] reading of his
[1:06:53] word be so kind and please take your
[1:06:55] seat
[1:06:57] you all welcome to the house
[1:07:01] of say God bless
[1:07:04] you bless them bless your
[1:07:07] neighbor with a
[1:07:12] smile brother while I'm still half
[1:07:14] asleep doesn't matter just smile so you
[1:07:16] can fully wake
[1:07:21] up we give thanks to God for this
[1:07:24] day we give thanks to God because he
[1:07:26] allows us to be
[1:07:27] [Music]
[1:07:32] here according to what our brother
[1:07:34] Antonio told us is being alive is worth
[1:07:35] more than
[1:07:37] $10,000 so then we are
[1:07:42] millionaires where is it brother well
[1:07:44] then we got a balance there has to be a
[1:07:47] balance to learn to Value what we
[1:07:51] have our pastor finds himself outside of
[1:07:54] the country
[1:07:56] he finds himself in
[1:07:58] Vietnam fighting the good
[1:08:02] fight tending to the
[1:08:05] call the call God has placed in his life
[1:08:09] and we're going to be praying for
[1:08:12] him I believe they have a 14 hour
[1:08:14] difference from
[1:08:18] us so just with that alone is enough to
[1:08:21] have your thoughts going
[1:08:23] wild in order to get acquainted kind of
[1:08:27] difficult when the time is so different
[1:08:29] than that which we're used
[1:08:31] to here it's day over there it's
[1:08:34] night you're over there
[1:08:37] awake and you're sleeping because over
[1:08:39] here it's night it's already time to go
[1:08:41] to sleep over
[1:08:43] there and you're wi awake because you
[1:08:45] can't go to sleep because over
[1:08:47] here and when you're barely getting used
[1:08:49] to it it's time to go
[1:08:53] back and you have to get used to once
[1:08:55] again to where you can say
[1:08:57] nor so let us continue praying for our
[1:09:02] pastor is with him we also Place him in
[1:09:04] our prayers as
[1:09:06] well may God be with our pastor and
[1:09:08] strengthen
[1:09:09] him may he fulfill the
[1:09:12] purpose for which he made this trip
[1:09:15] for for what God called him for this
[1:09:18] trip May the sick be healed and people
[1:09:21] be
[1:09:23] delivered people receive the Holy Spirit
[1:09:27] can they be able to receive what they
[1:09:29] need God needs a
[1:09:31] vessel he needs a vessel in order to
[1:09:35] work if we could make it in a simpler
[1:09:37] way we put it in the such
[1:09:42] manner imagine you order pizza you're
[1:09:45] hungry how many here like
[1:09:47] pizza however you
[1:09:50] like I don't like
[1:09:54] pepperoni to have jalapenos or chili or
[1:09:56] something like that however you like
[1:10:05] it now there's even p uh now there's
[1:10:08] pizzas that aren't flower
[1:10:10] based they
[1:10:14] cauliflower so now imagine you order
[1:10:16] pizza and you're very
[1:10:18] hungry and where you ordered
[1:10:21] from he comes and knocks on your door
[1:10:23] you see that he has the pizza on his
[1:10:26] he has the pure Pizza on his hand he's
[1:10:27] burning his hand he's saying hurry up
[1:10:28] I'm
[1:10:29] burning I've come to bring you your
[1:10:32] pizza what is it that you're going to
[1:10:35] think you would think well first of all
[1:10:37] did he clean his
[1:10:39] hands would you
[1:10:42] eat someone brought the pizza itself on
[1:10:45] their bare hands and they're giving to
[1:10:47] you like
[1:10:49] that I wouldn't eat it
[1:10:53] brother unless I'm out in the desert
[1:11:00] but
[1:11:02] nor the first thing I would think is
[1:11:05] where is the
[1:11:07] box where is the pizza
[1:11:10] box because the Box protects the
[1:11:17] product so when they bring me the pizza
[1:11:19] in a pizza box all my heart I accept it
[1:11:22] and I open the
[1:11:23] box and I begin to satisfy my
[1:11:27] need that's in the
[1:11:30] natural
[1:11:32] spiritual can't send you the substance
[1:11:35] unless it comes in
[1:11:36] flesh the
[1:11:39] product has to be covered in
[1:11:41] FL that can satisfy your
[1:11:44] need because God's
[1:11:47] Gift has to be in flesh because that is
[1:11:51] God's plan for the time we are living
[1:11:54] in how we give
[1:11:57] thanks and that's the way the best way I
[1:11:59] can
[1:12:03] explain what our pastor means to
[1:12:06] us it is
[1:12:08] God dressed
[1:12:12] Ines once again satisfying our needs
[1:12:15] amen
[1:12:17] amen so when you think
[1:12:20] on remember about the pizza without a
[1:12:23] box it can't be so
[1:12:26] it has to have a
[1:12:29] box God has to have a vessel to express
[1:12:32] his love towards
[1:12:36] us that's why we will always up our
[1:12:39] p and also pray for Sita and his
[1:12:43] family you always have to be strong to
[1:12:45] stay behind and be supporting as well
[1:12:48] it's a
[1:12:52] teamwork let's continue with the topic
[1:12:54] which corresponds to
[1:12:58] us the spoken word is the Original
[1:13:03] Seed we have been listening in a great
[1:13:11] amount we' have seen the way each one of
[1:13:13] our brothers have expressed this topic
[1:13:16] and we're grateful for what they've
[1:13:17] spoken to
[1:13:18] [Music]
[1:13:19] us for which they have expressed what's
[1:13:22] in their
[1:13:24] heart
[1:13:26] and I believe that God has fed us he's
[1:13:29] been feeding
[1:13:31] us the important
[1:13:35] part is that when we
[1:13:38] come we come with
[1:13:41] expectations because if we don't come
[1:13:43] expecting
[1:13:45] anything then we will leave with exactly
[1:13:50] that because we expect nothing we will
[1:13:52] leave with
[1:13:54] nothing
[1:13:56] so we go to past
[1:14:02] Sunday well how many take notes don't
[1:14:04] raise your
[1:14:05] hand if you take notes what do you do
[1:14:08] with your notes is the question don't
[1:14:11] answer but many times we take
[1:14:15] notes we say well that what the brother
[1:14:17] said was
[1:14:21] tremendous what our brothers expressed
[1:14:23] last Sunday our brother Anton and our
[1:14:24] brother
[1:14:27] of the value of the
[1:14:30] seed our life is worth more than
[1:14:33] [Music]
[1:14:40] money but in order for you to fully
[1:14:42] enjoy or understand the meaning of
[1:14:45] song you have to have an experience that
[1:14:47] you went
[1:14:48] through the seed went through an
[1:14:54] experience
[1:14:56] the Lily was trying to escape for that
[1:14:57] Merry clay or that
[1:15:02] swamp to make that effort and search out
[1:15:04] that light of the Sun that
[1:15:10] sunlight that's why when we come and we
[1:15:11] listen to the praise and the songs it's
[1:15:13] an
[1:15:15] experience that's why we can worship God
[1:15:18] in the bad times amen
[1:15:21] amen in brief that is what was spoken to
[1:15:23] us last Sunday
[1:15:31] so then I think that if we don't
[1:15:35] meditate we don't go back once again to
[1:15:37] what's been spoken to
[1:15:39] us so then the essence of the
[1:15:42] word it doesn't make an impact on our
[1:15:47] lives because Revelation comes through
[1:15:52] repetition so God puts us puts
[1:15:54] everything with
[1:16:00] so if we didn't take notes and we can
[1:16:01] always go back watch online and remember
[1:16:03] what God has for
[1:16:08] us something something I liked I don't
[1:16:10] know what it was but I I know I liked it
[1:16:11] but I don't know what it
[1:16:16] was God has so much Mercy on us you can
[1:16:19] go back and watch and listen to exactly
[1:16:20] what the brother said once
[1:16:23] again so then we have to take advant
[1:16:24] Vantage of what we
[1:16:29] have because in the beginning when God
[1:16:31] created the Heaven and the
[1:16:33] Earth the Earth was without form and
[1:16:40] void God began to make manifest his
[1:16:45] thoughts the other scripture we've been
[1:16:47] reading is Isaiah
[1:16:53] 5
[1:16:55] 558 where it says for my thoughts are
[1:16:57] not your
[1:16:59] thoughts neither are your ways my ways
[1:17:02] sayith the
[1:17:03] Lord verse
[1:17:15] 10 for as the rain cometh down in the
[1:17:17] snow from heaven and runneth not thither
[1:17:19] but WTH the Earth and make it bring
[1:17:21] forth in Bud that it may give seed to
[1:17:23] the swer and bread to the eater
[1:17:27] so shall be my word that go forth out of
[1:17:29] my mouth it shall not return unto me
[1:17:34] void but it shall accomplish that which
[1:17:38] I and it shall prosper in the thing
[1:17:40] where to I sent
[1:17:43] it God is manifesting once
[1:17:46] again what's the
[1:17:49] process for which you have to go
[1:17:52] through that the power of the spoken
[1:17:56] can have
[1:17:57] effect effect in our
[1:17:59] lives in
[1:18:01] what that we can
[1:18:04] place action what we have been
[1:18:07] taught brother brandham
[1:18:09] says God is
[1:18:12] unchangeable as much as in essence and
[1:18:16] as infinite in his
[1:18:19] abilities he knows the beginning and the
[1:18:21] end he is
[1:18:23] God
[1:18:26] therefore the thoughts of God are
[1:18:28] Eternal they are
[1:18:32] Eternal thought God tries to reveal them
[1:18:34] to each one of
[1:18:37] us he can't do it in the way that we
[1:18:42] think has to do it the way which he
[1:18:45] established in his
[1:18:49] plan that even though our life may be
[1:18:52] without form or
[1:18:53] void
[1:18:55] God has a process he has sh
[1:19:00] us which he desires to show his thoughts
[1:19:02] in our
[1:19:04] lives in that way the prophet
[1:19:08] says us being Eternal in his
[1:19:16] thoughts in our due time we become the
[1:19:18] many members of the seed of the spoken
[1:19:21] word manifested in flesh
[1:19:25] and those Eternal
[1:19:27] thoughts are now manifest in
[1:19:30] flesh are the sons of
[1:19:33] God just as we are
[1:19:37] called we don't become seed through the
[1:19:39] new
[1:19:40] birth we were
[1:19:43] seed and that's why we were born
[1:19:48] again because only the chosen can be
[1:19:50] born
[1:19:51] again because we were
[1:19:53] seed
[1:19:56] for that reason we could be
[1:20:00] quickened for that reason we could be
[1:20:04] quickened was in our
[1:20:08] hearts because there was the etal he
[1:20:15] deposited with a plan to go into action
[1:20:17] at a Due
[1:20:20] Time Each time he had a plan to manifest
[1:20:23] his
[1:20:27] that person could not live higher than
[1:20:28] their very
[1:20:29] own the revelation of
[1:20:32] the it was to be not to live
[1:20:35] higher could speak higher than your
[1:20:39] thoughts therefore you couldn't leave
[1:20:42] higher but the time we
[1:20:45] live God came once again in human
[1:20:49] flesh in the time we are living
[1:20:51] in in the age
[1:20:53] of
[1:20:57] Revelations behold I am at the
[1:20:59] door the only
[1:21:02] age in which Lord Jesus Christ is
[1:21:05] outside he's knocking to come
[1:21:10] inside so God is analyzing the situation
[1:21:12] which laa find itself
[1:21:16] in is the darkest age of
[1:21:23] all everyone is claiming their
[1:21:27] rights where they neither cold nor
[1:21:30] hot where there is no real commitment
[1:21:32] with
[1:21:33] God people are miserable and poor blind
[1:21:38] naked and they know it
[1:21:42] not God is trying to come in to the
[1:21:45] heart of the human being he is
[1:21:48] knocking but in this
[1:21:51] age in this door that he is knocking on
[1:21:55] there's no way to open it from the
[1:21:56] outside it has to be opened from the
[1:21:59] inside your heart you have to open it
[1:22:03] yourself you have to open that
[1:22:07] door the door that the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:22:09] may come for what
[1:22:11] reason to be able to reveal to
[1:22:14] you what it
[1:22:16] is that you mean to
[1:22:19] him he will take you throughout the
[1:22:23] scriptures
[1:22:25] he will take you to understand who you
[1:22:29] are Romans 9:23
[1:22:39] says glor and he said and that he might
[1:22:42] make known The Riches of his glory on
[1:22:44] the vessels of Mercy which he had a
[1:22:46] prepared unto
[1:22:53] Glory even us whom he called not the
[1:22:56] Jews only but also of the
[1:23:05] Gentiles as he said also in ozi I will
[1:23:08] call them my people which are not my
[1:23:10] people and her beloved which was not
[1:23:17] beloved and he shall come to pass that
[1:23:19] in the place where it was said unto them
[1:23:20] ye are not my people there shall they be
[1:23:22] called the children of the Living God
[1:23:25] in Colossians
[1:23:33] 1:26 even the mystery which had been hid
[1:23:35] from ages and for Generations but now is
[1:23:37] made manifest to his
[1:23:44] Saints to whom God would make known what
[1:23:47] is the riches of the glory of his
[1:23:48] mystery among the
[1:23:51] Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope
[1:23:53] of glory
[1:23:57] Ephesians 36
[1:24:06] says that the Gentiles should be fellow
[1:24:09] Heirs of the same body and partakers of
[1:24:11] the promise in Christ by the
[1:24:13] gospel that
[1:24:15] us which were not a people which were
[1:24:18] not
[1:24:19] Beloved the Lord Jesus
[1:24:22] Christ came manifest the thoughts
[1:24:25] God di the cross at
[1:24:27] Calvary for the pardon of our
[1:24:31] sins he came to preach he came to
[1:24:35] express to express God's thoughts but he
[1:24:39] died and as he
[1:24:42] died the word had to be ful he
[1:24:47] resurrected God's thoughts Express at
[1:24:50] each
[1:24:51] moment God's plan had to continue
[1:24:56] Paul comes and says now I have a
[1:24:59] mystery God has deposited this mystery
[1:25:04] within I surrendered my life I made
[1:25:06] myself a prisoner of
[1:25:09] Christ because I am a prisoner God has
[1:25:11] given me a
[1:25:13] vis and with a vision comes
[1:25:15] Revelation the revelation
[1:25:17] of he says now the Gentiles are
[1:25:22] coair the Gentiles
[1:25:25] are
[1:25:26] partakers of the same
[1:25:30] promise not only is it Abraham seed in
[1:25:32] the
[1:25:34] natural now it's Abraham's Royal seed in
[1:25:37] the
[1:25:38] spiritual and if we are sons of
[1:25:42] Abraham we have to act like Abraham act
[1:25:45] and
[1:25:48] Abraham who became the father of
[1:25:52] Nations he believed in Hope against
[1:25:56] hope he became the father of
[1:25:59] many because it is what the word has
[1:26:05] said always called called with his word
[1:26:09] that he is the father of our
[1:26:12] faith and that same faith has to dwell
[1:26:15] in
[1:26:16] us to understand who we are the ones who
[1:26:19] are not belov are now Beloved the ones
[1:26:23] who are not people
[1:26:26] people can be called sons of Liv God God
[1:26:29] is
[1:26:30] trying Express his
[1:26:33] thought so that we can
[1:26:36] understand what we mean to
[1:26:39] him that we are beloved of
[1:26:42] God we're so beloved that he only
[1:26:46] son to die at cross for
[1:26:51] us so we would don't always be in the
[1:26:54] same
[1:26:55] condition but the
[1:26:57] riches the richness of his
[1:27:01] grace of his
[1:27:03] mercy be deposited in each one of
[1:27:07] usep Ephesians
[1:27:11] 17 in whom we have Redemption for his
[1:27:14] blood in the pardon of
[1:27:17] sin according to the riches of God's
[1:27:19] grace
[1:27:21] epesi Ephesians 1:8
[1:27:27] I pray the eyes of your heart may be
[1:27:31] enlightened in order that you may know
[1:27:33] the Hope which he has called
[1:27:37] you the riches of his glorious
[1:27:39] inheritance and His holy
[1:27:42] people understanding
[1:27:46] this that now the gospel could be
[1:27:48] preached to the
[1:27:50] Gentiles and how the Gentiles were
[1:27:52] partakers of that promise
[1:27:55] we are part of that
[1:27:58] promise we are part of that which was
[1:28:01] revealed being Gentiles being F
[1:28:04] separated from God now we have the
[1:28:06] opportunity to return We with Christ
[1:28:11] when Christ
[1:28:12] dies being the only begotten Son of
[1:28:15] God the gra
[1:28:18] the Earth but when he res
[1:28:21] res resurrected
[1:28:23] as amongst many
[1:28:26] Breen that places us in a quality of
[1:28:28] children or
[1:28:29] Sons that's how God is looking at
[1:28:33] us God sees each one of
[1:28:36] us why because we are his beloved we are
[1:28:39] his
[1:28:41] people we are the reason why he came to
[1:28:45] Earth Deuteronomy
[1:28:49] 329 for the Lord's portion is his
[1:28:53] people
[1:28:54] and after everything that passed
[1:28:59] by Paul comes and he tries to get the
[1:29:01] people to understand this
[1:29:03] Myst so one way to understand
[1:29:09] it he talked to them in a term that they
[1:29:12] could
[1:29:13] see he says the riches of his
[1:29:17] grace The Riches of his
[1:29:20] Mercy now poured out unto the Gentiles
[1:29:24] Something
[1:29:26] Rich thinking someone who's
[1:29:30] wealthy because Grace has been
[1:29:33] expressed Mercy has been expressed this
[1:29:38] mystery thees
[1:29:41] of and pours it out over a people who
[1:29:44] did not deserve it it's by Grace it's by
[1:29:47] Grace not by
[1:29:50] works and God in his
[1:29:53] love he asked one
[1:29:56] thing in John
[1:30:00] 17 how many believe that the Lord Jesus
[1:30:02] Christ prayed for
[1:30:05] us the Lord Jesus Christ prayed for
[1:30:09] me you're so valuable that the Lord
[1:30:11] Jesus Christ prayed for you no brother
[1:30:15] how St John
[1:30:20] 1720 my prayer is not for them alone
[1:30:28] I pray also for those who will believe
[1:30:29] in me through their
[1:30:32] message throughout
[1:30:35] time by their
[1:30:37] message Believers have
[1:30:40] come even getting here with
[1:30:43] us Lord Jesus Christ said Lord I'm not
[1:30:46] just praying for those who are here
[1:30:49] listening but for those who will believe
[1:30:51] because of
[1:30:52] them and that's where you and I are
[1:30:57] included the Lord Jesus Christ prayed
[1:30:59] for
[1:31:00] us what a
[1:31:03] revelation what Revelation it's so
[1:31:07] simple because if I would have been
[1:31:08] there with brother BR I would have
[1:31:10] surrendered to
[1:31:13] God Jesus Christ would have lived in my
[1:31:17] time if you would have prayed for me I
[1:31:18] would have been
[1:31:19] free well then be free brother Lord
[1:31:23] Jesus Christ prayed for you what are you
[1:31:25] waiting for what are you waiting
[1:31:31] for that all they may be one that's his
[1:31:35] prayer father you as you are in me and I
[1:31:39] am may they also be in

[1:31:50] me so they may be
[1:31:52] one as we are
[1:31:55] one I and them and you and
[1:31:58] me so they may be brought to complete
[1:32:01] un then the world will

[1:32:28] where I am that was his
[1:32:31] desire he began to
[1:32:34] express so at that place where he was

[1:32:43] God those who had
[1:32:45] predestined could have a way back why he
[1:32:49] prayed and he said

[1:41:58] times we don't understand in order to be
[1:42:03] partners we have to
[1:42:06] invest you can't be a partner without
[1:42:11] inves that's why many times we're
[1:42:15] ineffective we want to claim
[1:42:17] our without having paid the
[1:42:20] price you have to pay the price
[1:42:25] in order to claim the right of being
[1:42:27] partners with
[1:42:28] God you have to give your part which
[1:42:30] corresponds
[1:42:32] to so then you have the right to
[1:42:35] decide over the business in which you're
[1:42:38] in and God tells us I love you so much
[1:42:41] that you are my partner everything is PA
[1:42:44] I already paid the
[1:42:45] price I already di on the cross for you
[1:42:48] you are clean you're holy you're
[1:42:52] sanctified
[1:42:53] I see you clean before th my
[1:42:57] eyes now simply act on what I have told
[1:42:59] you if I told you you're
[1:43:02] free then be
[1:43:08] free I want an angel from the Heavens to
[1:43:10] come down and give me a slap on the
[1:43:12] face now when he slaps
[1:43:15] me I can see Thunders and lights and
[1:43:18] stars the angel already came brother and
[1:43:21] he already gave you a smack in the face
[1:43:23] but we were
[1:43:25] asleep not even that woke us
[1:43:29] up it's time for us to wake up and see
[1:43:31] who we really
[1:43:32] are because this age is a neurotic age
[1:43:36] we're so busy or preoccupied or so in a
[1:43:39] rush so then what is the solution if God
[1:43:43] loves us then we have to love him as
[1:43:47] well we have to show that we love
[1:43:51] him how are we going to show that
[1:43:56] the only way is having the love of God
[1:43:57] in our
[1:43:58] lives we have to have the love of God
[1:44:00] inside of
[1:44:01] us no brother that's
[1:44:04] impossible in other time it was
[1:44:08] difficult had access to that
[1:44:11] mystery God's
[1:44:13] thoughts had not been
[1:44:16] expressed so you could have the love of
[1:44:18] God in its
[1:44:20] fullness but comes God comes once again
[1:44:23] in the darkest
[1:44:24] age to give us
[1:44:27] access to to access the love of
[1:44:31] God God's love in
[1:44:33] our and when God sent his prophet and he
[1:44:36] told us he
[1:44:39] says says be certain that you have
[1:44:42] it God allow to go beyond the curtain of
[1:44:46] time he came back to give
[1:44:50] testimony nothing that doesn't have
[1:44:52] Divine love can enter
[1:44:55] God's love in your
[1:44:56] life be certain that you have it so
[1:45:00] then if God Express
[1:45:03] himself exess need God's love to enter
[1:45:05] in that
[1:45:08] means that we have access to God's love
[1:45:10] in our
[1:45:12] life we have access to
[1:45:16] experience God's
[1:45:18] love because us as
[1:45:20] Gentiles Christ in US
[1:45:23] this hope of glory Christ in
[1:45:28] US is the only way God can show his when
[1:45:31] he comes to
[1:45:33] us to reveal what he is in an
[1:45:37] age where everything is in a rush we
[1:45:40] want everything
[1:45:42] quick we get mad over any small
[1:45:45] thing if he doesn't greet me I get
[1:45:48] mad and if he greets me I also get
[1:45:51] mad doesn't greet me I'm mad CU he greet
[1:45:54] me but if he greets me I get mad because
[1:45:57] why did he greet me that
[1:46:00] way when someone's in that
[1:46:05] situation that means they don't have the
[1:46:07] love of God in their
[1:46:10] life what does it have to do with
[1:46:13] anything well in everything we have to
[1:46:15] reflect the Lord Jesus
[1:46:18] Christ they made ugly faces to him they
[1:46:21] rejected him
[1:46:25] they placed a crown of fors they spit on
[1:46:30] him how many times he wanted to greet
[1:46:31] someone and bless
[1:46:33] them and the pH was said
[1:46:36] nope he says you're not one of
[1:46:39] mine you hang around
[1:46:43] with oh with publicans and
[1:46:48] sinners I can't greet you because you're
[1:46:50] going to contaminate
[1:46:51] me they rejected him many times but he
[1:46:55] always
[1:47:00] forgave so one of the ways we express
[1:47:02] the the glory of God in our
[1:47:08] lives and when pardon or forgiveness is
[1:47:11] a characteristic in our lives
[1:47:14] pardon to forgive ourselves for what we
[1:47:17] have
[1:47:19] done and forgive others because
[1:47:21] constantly
[1:47:23] We are failing we're
[1:47:26] offended family is not focused in the
[1:47:30] word of
[1:47:31] God the children
[1:47:33] offend the parents
[1:47:36] offend the husband does understand the
[1:47:39] wife doesn't understand the husband the
[1:47:41] son doesn't understand the mother the
[1:47:43] daughter doesn't understand the brother
[1:47:45] father and the son doesn't understand
[1:47:47] it's a
[1:47:51] disaster and place all things together
[1:47:54] is the
[1:47:55] love God's love in
[1:47:57] our but God's love is
[1:48:01] so possible that we can have access to
[1:48:03] the love of
[1:48:04] God I have access to God's love what do
[1:48:09] I have to
[1:48:11] do do I have to do a certain type of
[1:48:16] ritual God placed at such a level that
[1:48:19] anyone can access
[1:48:21] it because Jesus only asked one
[1:48:25] thing and that we have fellowship with
[1:48:27] him he loved us so
[1:48:30] much that he
[1:48:34] left because the only way to have fellow
[1:48:36] with for his love in our
[1:48:40] heart so
[1:48:42] then when they ask brother
[1:48:48] brandham how can a Christian enter more
[1:48:51] deeply into the love of God
[1:48:54] now can somebody tell me it's there on
[1:48:56] the screen what does it
[1:49:00] say read the word pray brother Bram
[1:49:06] said he says good thing that God when he
[1:49:08] called them he didn't call Pure
[1:49:12] intellectuals he says because if he
[1:49:13] would called intellectuals I would have
[1:49:15] been
[1:49:17] set say he made it so simple that even I
[1:49:19] can understand
[1:49:21] it so God plac it so
[1:49:24] simp that we can enter
[1:49:27] into have God's love in our
[1:49:30] lives he says this is the portion that
[1:49:32] corresponds to
[1:49:34] you says read the word and
[1:49:42] pray so in a
[1:49:44] rush our first excuse
[1:49:48] is I don't have
[1:49:51] time I'm
[1:49:54] tired I can't
[1:49:57] pray because I got mad with my
[1:50:00] wife and my prayer doesn't go beyond the
[1:50:05] roof we always have a reason why we
[1:50:09] don't we have access to God's love in
[1:50:11] our
[1:50:12] lives God made it so
[1:50:15] simple that even the weakest
[1:50:18] person even the person with the lowest
[1:50:21] intellect
[1:50:24] can elevate a prayer and God will hear
[1:50:26] that
[1:50:27] prayer open the Bible they can open the
[1:50:29] message God can reveal it to that person
[1:50:33] he made it so
[1:50:34] simple so that no one would go
[1:50:39] astray avoids it doesn't let us pray and
[1:50:42] read the
[1:50:45] word so then what are we going to
[1:50:51] do
[1:50:56] how can a Christian enter deeper into
[1:50:57] the love of God prayer read the
[1:51:02] word prayer
[1:51:06] changes we have problems in the last
[1:51:08] thing we do is go and
[1:51:09] pray there's problems in
[1:51:12] our and first we fight
[1:51:16] and KS and throw
[1:51:18] whatever throw our cell
[1:51:21] phone in order to break yourself it be
[1:51:23] something really
[1:51:25] serious to break it
[1:51:28] why because we lose
[1:51:33] control that we're so worried in
[1:51:38] our but the pressure of to act in way
[1:51:41] that we shouldn't be
[1:51:43] AC we shouldn't
[1:51:46] be and that's where the seed loses value
[1:51:49] because the Devil
[1:51:50] comes and he brings all his demons
[1:51:53] from the fourth
[1:51:55] dimension to surround that
[1:51:58] person to bring an
[1:52:01] atmosphere the anointing brings
[1:52:06] information and that information will be
[1:52:08] like a
[1:52:08] USB we will try to come to your
[1:52:12] mind and give you certain information to
[1:52:15] give you a
[1:52:16] new something who you are not you're a
[1:52:20] child of
[1:52:21] God
[1:52:23] the devil wants to make that you're not
[1:52:24] Son of God you're because you've done
[1:52:27] the wrong because you fa devil will
[1:52:29] convince you and he will not stop will
[1:52:33] convince you that you're worthless until
[1:52:35] you lose
[1:52:37] form that's his
[1:52:39] purpose but
[1:52:42] God made it so simple so that we can go
[1:52:45] he only said he said read the word and
[1:52:50] pray something very important
[1:52:54] we have to
[1:52:56] meditate we have to
[1:52:58] meditate
[1:53:04] why because we're so
[1:53:07] busy now I'm going to say
[1:53:12] this someone tells me well brother I
[1:53:15] don't have
[1:53:17] time let me tell you I I don't believe
[1:53:19] that you don't have
[1:53:21] time I cannot believe
[1:53:24] that you can make all the excuses you
[1:53:30] want but I can't believe if you say you
[1:53:32] don't have time to pray you can tell me
[1:53:35] whatever you
[1:53:37] want you can't tell me that you don't
[1:53:39] have time to read the word of God you
[1:53:41] can't tell me that if you tell me that I
[1:53:44] don't believe
[1:53:46] it you're tired you're
[1:53:50] exhausted the pressures of Life are
[1:53:52] invading
[1:53:53] you but here there's a
[1:53:55] key that
[1:53:59] mer the rich of
[1:54:01] Mer the rich of the grace of God was
[1:54:05] poured into
[1:54:09] you the first person you have to have
[1:54:11] grace and mercy upon is
[1:54:16] yourself because the person that judges
[1:54:17] yourself the
[1:54:20] most you're supposed to pray and
[1:54:22] don't do it and because you didn't do it
[1:54:25] well I do it let me just sit down and
[1:54:28] watch your movie
[1:54:30] instead and we watch a movie that's two
[1:54:32] hours long but we don't have time to
[1:54:35] pray how many can say
[1:54:43] Amen giving you the mystery of the
[1:54:46] revelation of Lord Jesus Christ in the
[1:54:47] time we're living in the mystery is the
[1:54:51] mystery revealed is
[1:54:53] it doesn't matter how busy you
[1:54:56] are God can still make himself manifest
[1:54:58] through
[1:54:59] you all you
[1:55:01] have is
[1:55:03] make is to follow the Eternal principles
[1:55:06] of
[1:55:07] God oh what such a big
[1:55:09] word just
[1:55:11] pray and read the Bible read the
[1:55:17] message is that
[1:55:21] difficult it's not
[1:55:25] the problem is we don't know how to
[1:55:26] manage our time we don't know
[1:55:31] how we wake up in the morning and it
[1:55:33] seems like we're in a
[1:55:35] rush we walk out of the house without
[1:55:37] shoes and we got to go back and get
[1:55:39] it I forgot this I forgot my keys then
[1:55:43] we go back and then we remember we
[1:55:43] forgot something
[1:55:45] else we do about three to five we go
[1:55:49] back and forth three or four or five
[1:55:50] times cuz we forget things
[1:55:52] then we forget our
[1:55:54] lunch and so then we have to buy
[1:55:57] something in the afternoon we come like
[1:55:59] this we're sneaking
[1:56:02] around because if our wife finds out
[1:56:04] take our lunch maybe she's going to
[1:56:06] throw the plate at so let me go before
[1:56:09] she finds
[1:56:11] out because we have so much pressure we
[1:56:14] forget
[1:56:16] things the other day I was talking with
[1:56:18] somebody I was on the phone with
[1:56:20] somebody at work and they tell
[1:56:25] me he says wait wait hold a minute I'll
[1:56:27] call you back right
[1:56:28] now I say okay everything's good is
[1:56:30] everything good he said yeah I I just
[1:56:32] can't find my
[1:56:35] phone we're talking on the phone what do
[1:56:37] you mean you can't find your
[1:56:39] phone but he so used that he always has
[1:56:41] a
[1:56:42] here that he touched and he said
[1:56:46] my and he had the phone in his other
[1:56:47] hand talking to
[1:56:51] me
[1:56:52] I tell them when you come right now let
[1:56:54] me pray for
[1:56:56] you because we're so
[1:57:01] busy and we forget that God's Simplicity
[1:57:04] is what gives us the
[1:57:07] victory when we
[1:57:09] pray that connects me
[1:57:11] with when we read word we Med word that
[1:57:16] connects me with
[1:57:18] myself connects me with the value that I
[1:57:21] have
[1:57:22] I need a
[1:57:25] conne
[1:57:27] come his glory
[1:57:30] can his anointing can
[1:57:34] be but the anointing will not take
[1:57:37] advantage understand who I
[1:57:40] am that's why I have to meditate on what
[1:57:42] I read let me tell you another
[1:57:46] key how can a Christian go deeper into
[1:57:49] the love of
[1:57:50] God read the word and
[1:57:54] pray brother Brown didn't say you have
[1:57:56] to sit down and pray for an
[1:58:00] hour how long do you have to read the
[1:58:02] word for it to make be effectful or make
[1:58:04] an
[1:58:10] impact Jeremiah
[1:58:14] 2911 I know thoughts I have you say the
[1:58:18] Lord thoughts of good and not of evil
[1:58:20] for give you an expected end
[1:58:23] Jeremiah
[1:58:25] 333 to me and I will
[1:58:27] answer how much time did I stay on that
[1:58:31] one
[1:58:31] minute let's say about a minute
[1:58:35] Lord you say if I cry unto you you will
[1:58:38] respond I'm so busy I don't have
[1:58:42] time when I get home and I
[1:58:47] fall as I'm falling down to the pillow
[1:58:49] I'm already falling asleep I'm exhausted
[1:58:52] I don't have time for this I don't have
[1:58:53] time for
[1:58:54] that but I have five minutes to read the
[1:59:00] word I'm going to take advantage minutes
[1:59:02] and I will
[1:59:03] meditate I will read
[1:59:05] promise and that promise I will make it
[1:59:10] mine I'm gonna make the word of God
[1:59:12] effective in my
[1:59:14] life I'm G make that word cry unto me
[1:59:16] and I will answer that is my
[1:59:20] promise God said that he will answer me
[1:59:22] thank you Lord you take care of
[1:59:25] me provide my needs than you for my
[1:59:29] family what you've done in my life for
[1:59:32] me if I failed you I know that you hear
[1:59:34] me I know that you love
[1:59:36] me Great and Mighty thank you
[1:59:40] Father how long do that
[1:59:47] take you just don't get it I don't even
[1:59:49] have time for
[1:59:51] that
[1:59:52] so if you don't have five
[1:59:54] minutes five
[1:59:59] minutes then take advantage of when
[2:00:01] you're driving what do you listen to
[2:00:03] when you're
[2:00:04] driving oh brother it's cuz the kumas
[2:00:12] are if the only time you have free to
[2:00:14] listen to word is while you're
[2:00:17] driving you have the option do I listen
[2:00:19] to music or I listen to a preacher
[2:00:24] I don't think you need to be a scientist
[2:00:25] to know what decision to
[2:00:27] make listen to the
[2:00:29] word listen to the
[2:00:33] word the music or the
[2:00:37] word the music is just an instrument to
[2:00:39] bring for the
[2:00:40] atmosphere but there's nothing to come
[2:00:42] and make contact it doesn't matter what
[2:00:44] atmosphere is there has to be the
[2:00:46] essence the power it has to be
[2:00:49] there the word is what has the power
[2:00:55] I'll be
[2:00:57] finishing you have to do an analysis of
[2:00:59] your
[2:01:01] life because you have the
[2:01:06] thoughts abook 2 one
[2:01:20] 22
[2:01:23] it
[2:01:25] says says write down the
[2:01:28] Revelation write down the Revelation
[2:01:31] write it
[2:01:34] down he's telling us to write the
[2:01:43] vision and the Lord answered me and
[2:01:48] said write the
[2:01:50] vision and make it plain upon
[2:01:54] tables that he may run that readeth it
[2:01:58] write down the vision the prophet being
[2:02:03] Christ the word revealed theed a vision
[2:02:07] but God told him don't don't keep that
[2:02:10] Vision write it
[2:02:12] down write the
[2:02:15] vision so that whoever reads it may run
[2:02:20] they may run
[2:02:24] for the vision is yet appointed for
[2:02:28] time but at the end it shall
[2:02:31] speak though it ter wait for
[2:02:35] it because it will surely come and it
[2:02:37] will not
[2:02:39] t that's why brother Bram had to record
[2:02:41] the message he had to have it
[2:02:45] recorded because there was a people to
[2:02:47] come
[2:02:48] after to capture the vision
[2:02:52] there had to be a
[2:02:54] church P clean and
[2:02:57] without live in the
[2:02:59] power access to thoughts of
[2:03:02] God but the vision that's been written
[2:03:04] down can be made
[2:03:06] manif unless someone
[2:03:10] reads in the
[2:03:15] heart what the word says is
[2:03:18] real and God wants to
[2:03:20] use to manifest his
[2:03:24] glory if he desires God's love to be
[2:03:27] manifest problems in your
[2:03:29] home in your
[2:03:31] matrim read the
[2:03:33] word claim the promises of God get
[2:03:38] into the
[2:03:40] man the promise of God for your life
[2:03:43] don't
[2:03:45] stay don't say they
[2:03:47] just read the
[2:03:49] word run with that vision run with that
[2:03:53] word so that God can manifest
[2:03:59] it after the thoughts come then comes
[2:04:02] the spoken
[2:04:03] word in the message Jehovah
[2:04:07] Gyra God can do nothing for
[2:04:10] you until first by faith you accept it
[2:04:15] and believe it and confess
[2:04:19] it God
[2:04:22] can do nothing for
[2:04:24] you you know why he can't because he
[2:04:27] already did
[2:04:28] it that's why I can't do
[2:04:31] nothing and that's the part of the the
[2:04:34] society or the
[2:04:35] part he says now I've did my part now
[2:04:37] you do your part accept it believe it
[2:04:42] and confess
[2:04:48] it that's the only way God can act now
[2:04:53] is when you act
[2:04:56] first you have to act first you have to
[2:05:00] pray you have to
[2:05:03] read to listen to the message you have
[2:05:06] to read the
[2:05:08] word because he is the high
[2:05:11] priest making
[2:05:13] intercessions on your confession of your
[2:05:16] faith in his finished
[2:05:19] work you have to confess
[2:05:22] the work has been done that's
[2:05:26] why as we read
[2:05:28] Genesis Isaiah
[2:05:30] 55 God made an
[2:05:33] analysis do analysis in our life as
[2:05:36] well and God had the
[2:05:38] thoughts God had the thoughts he had the
[2:05:42] vision when he had the vision he spoke
[2:05:45] the
[2:05:46] word and the word came and made itself
[2:05:48] manif when
[2:05:50] we the
[2:05:52] situation say Lord I need to pray more I
[2:05:56] need to read the word
[2:05:57] more we begin to read the
[2:06:01] word to see that the word speaks about
[2:06:04] us by his stripes I am
[2:06:07] healed what he thinks about
[2:06:09] me I will not leave you nor forsake you
[2:06:12] that is he's talking about
[2:06:16] me God is tell me through the prophet
[2:06:18] that I have to
[2:06:20] believe
[2:06:23] it's for me understand it and accept and
[2:06:25] believe it and confess
[2:06:26] it my
[2:06:29] thoughts they begin to become a
[2:06:32] vision of The Eternity in my
[2:06:36] life eternity begins to dwell in
[2:06:39] me I begin to make contact with the
[2:06:43] Eternal begins to make contact with the
[2:06:47] Sun so then inside of me a vision comes
[2:06:50] for it says
[2:06:52] in habac
[2:06:54] sorry don't stay with the
[2:06:57] vision how I'm how am I going to run
[2:06:59] with it have to start to speak the word
[2:07:01] of God so it produces the results
[2:07:05] because the word that I bring
[2:07:08] forth will not return to me voice
[2:07:11] because I speak I already understand who
[2:07:13] I am I understand that God loves me I
[2:07:16] have grace and mercy with myself I will
[2:07:19] extend grace and mercy to everyone else
[2:07:21] I will
[2:07:22] forgive I will begin to have
[2:07:25] faith I will begin to do what I'm
[2:07:27] supposed to so that God May dwell in
[2:07:30] life and I will begin to manifest the
[2:07:33] word of God I will begin to speak the
[2:07:35] word
[2:07:36] of have contact with the Eternal God so
[2:07:40] he can May transform my
[2:07:42] life God placed it at a
[2:07:45] level that any person can do
[2:07:48] it he placed it at such level
[2:07:53] where the wisdoms and the the the people
[2:07:55] who study they trip over
[2:07:58] this because the children can walk
[2:08:01] through
[2:08:02] there because he made it so simple for
[2:08:05] us all he
[2:08:07] said the greatest thing we can have is
[2:08:10] the love of God in our lives and what do
[2:08:13] I need to
[2:08:15] do what I need to do for the god of love
[2:08:17] can manifest in my life and grow and
[2:08:19] grow and grow what I have to
[2:08:24] do pray and read the
[2:08:27] word who has to make that decision
[2:08:30] God no I have to make a decision I have
[2:08:33] to manage my
[2:08:35] time I have to manage my
[2:08:39] time to be able
[2:08:41] to do what I have to
[2:08:46] do be able to have that Divine
[2:08:48] fellowship with my creator that is the
[2:08:50] only way
[2:08:53] that we can escape the neurotic age it's
[2:08:55] the only way if we don't do
[2:08:59] that
[2:09:01] thetic sooner or later it will absorb
[2:09:04] us sooner or later it will absorb us and
[2:09:06] the prophet
[2:09:07] said says the problem
[2:09:10] is is just we explode we
[2:09:14] offend we make
[2:09:16] excuses and all this gets together the
[2:09:20] tension builds up the stress builds
[2:09:24] up builds up the problems build up
[2:09:27] anxiety builds up nervous nervousness
[2:09:30] build up and all of this produces a
[2:09:35] result that someone will act out of
[2:09:37] place and it will be something
[2:09:44] incorrect we have the exit of the
[2:09:46] anointing L is out we can have God's
[2:09:50] peace in our life
[2:09:52] we can have God's love in our
[2:09:54] lives but that's in our
[2:09:57] hands how can I go deeper into the love
[2:09:59] of God just read the word and
[2:10:04] pray it's in our
[2:10:07] hands God's thoughts He has expressed
[2:10:11] them and we have access to
[2:10:14] them all we have to do is make a
[2:10:18] decision I'm going to make a
[2:10:20] commitment no matter how tired I am no
[2:10:23] matter how bothered I
[2:10:27] am tense or how nervous I feel I'm going
[2:10:30] to
[2:10:31] pray when I begin to pray tension begins
[2:10:34] to
[2:10:35] leave then the
[2:10:38] word the word tells me that God loves
[2:10:41] me so I start to meditate all the bad
[2:10:44] things
[2:10:45] done but then God shows me his grace and
[2:10:47] his mercy and I see that all of God's
[2:10:50] promises are for me
[2:10:53] I can't accomplish that unless I
[2:10:54] meditate on the word if we can please
[2:11:10] stand the vision was
[2:11:14] projected we just have to catch
[2:11:17] it accept
[2:11:20] it
[2:11:22] know that it's for us confess
[2:11:26] it because the most difficult thing to
[2:11:28] do
[2:11:30] is especially when that which we want we
[2:11:33] can't
[2:11:35] see that is why we are royal Seed of
[2:11:38] Abraham because Abraham confessed what
[2:11:41] he didn't
[2:11:42] see he confessed it as if it was already
[2:11:46] done and that is what we have to
[2:11:49] do bring the atmosphere of God
[2:11:51] whatever we need it can come to our Liv
[2:11:55] but we have to make a
[2:11:57] commitment I will not move from
[2:11:59] there the presence of God until
[2:12:04] he I will fight
[2:12:06] with until God's glory is made manifest
[2:12:09] in my life I will pray I will cry
[2:12:11] out until God comes and
[2:12:14] answers the vision will make itself
[2:12:16] manifest the vision will not car I have
[2:12:19] to run with that vision
[2:12:21] because the promise is for us if you
[2:12:23] want it it's for you you just have to
[2:12:26] accept it let us pray Lord Jesus we give
[2:12:31] you thanks holy Heavenly
[2:12:34] Father you placed that such a
[2:12:39] simple that anyone can directly come
[2:12:41] into your
[2:12:44] presence the neurotic age tries to
[2:12:48] Tor the neurotic age tries to dece
[2:12:52] to make us think that we're something
[2:12:53] that we're not help
[2:12:56] us that the pressure of
[2:13:00] life may not change who we
[2:13:02] are may not change our
[2:13:05] decisions may be the number one thing in
[2:13:07] our
[2:13:08] lives you take the preeminence in our
[2:13:13] hearts Lord may you come and take
[2:13:14] complete contr we surrender to the Lord
[2:13:18] Jesus may we be able to pray
[2:13:22] something in our
[2:13:24] Liv we understand that prayer changes
[2:13:26] the
[2:13:29] circumstances most powerful thing that
[2:13:30] you've placed in the hands of the human
[2:13:33] being the word that you have spoken to
[2:13:36] us it's the most powerful weapon that
[2:13:38] you placed in the
[2:13:40] hands that powerful weapon is in our
[2:13:42] hands we have to use it Lord we give you
[2:13:46] thanks help us we're in your hands
[2:13:51] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
