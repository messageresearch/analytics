[37:18] father and attend to know understanding
[37:22] oh it is
[37:26] for I give you a good Doctrine forsaking
[37:28] not my
[37:30] laws
[37:33] for I was my Father's son tender and
[37:36] only beloved in the sight of my mother
[37:37] but yet
[37:46] dear God
[37:47] thank you for letting us come to another
[37:50] Sunday in your house
[37:53] thank you for everybody come here safely
[37:56] on this Father's Day yes
[37:59] I want to thank you for letting me have
[38:02] a father
[38:03] and
[38:05] those in the audience I have a father
[38:07] too yes
[38:11] again Lord I thank you okay
[38:15] please let me find the right words to
[38:17] say today
[38:20] and in the name of Lord Jesus Christ we
[38:22] pray
[38:23] amen amen
[38:27] so
[38:29] I like to my pastor again give me a
[38:30] chance to express myself here today
[38:32] [Music]
[38:34] you know I'm using the back on the
[38:37] computer
[38:38] I'd rather make my dad look good online
[38:45] but uh
[38:47] I'm still here today in front of you
[38:49] guys so I'm gonna do my best please
[38:57] again I'm not really good at expressing
[38:59] my feelings and putting my words
[39:08] so looking at what makes a father
[39:12] it's commonly said that they usually
[39:15] teach life skills or lessons
[39:21] being a role
[39:24] Modelo their presence
[39:26] support responsibility
[39:34] this is what they say what traits and
[39:36] what fathers do and so look at is
[39:41] um
[39:46] I've seen families that
[39:49] I grew up not seeing women
[39:57] or sometimes they did or then they were
[39:59] abusive clearly
[40:03] and I'm still friends with some people
[40:05] to this day
[40:07] and it's really clear to see the
[40:10] difference between having a father and
[40:11] not having a father Yes
[40:16] and for that I'm thankful to wake up
[40:18] every day and have a superhero when I
[40:19] said
[40:23] and it's funny to say superhero because
[40:25] you know when I was little yeah there's
[40:28] the amount of rules my dad had yeah
[40:33] and make me think he's a villaino
[40:39] but the type of I'm the type of person
[40:43] that always likes to be right
[40:46] and my dad's always the type of person
[40:48] to always be right
[40:52] so I wonder where I got that from this
[40:54] is so
[40:57] every time I try to argue my dad it's
[41:00] always pointless
[41:04] because the more I think about his view
[41:06] he's always right
[41:12] he always seems to be 10 steps ahead of
[41:14] me
[41:16] from experience
[41:19] and he always tells me about his
[41:21] experiences
[41:23] he tells me what to do and what not to
[41:25] do
[41:26] sometimes
[41:29] and the exact outcome is what he'd
[41:32] always say is
[41:36] he tells me stories from his childhood
[41:39] more examples what to do and what not to
[41:41] do it
[41:45] foreign
[41:58] it's Evan at home he's a leader yes
[42:02] and not just at home he's a leader to me
[42:04] too you know
[42:07] whenever I look at him I see a great man
[42:09] hombre
[42:12] no matter what he does I always see him
[42:13] do good
[42:17] whenever he messes up I don't see it
[42:20] turns it around
[42:23] again he's my superhero my name is
[42:28] well my dad's out on the missionary
[42:31] field
[42:33] he's quite frankly always out
[42:37] and I sort of miss him
[42:42] but never fails every time I do miss
[42:47] um
[42:50] my phone lights up or my mom's phone
[42:52] lights up
[42:56] it's either him texting or calling
[42:58] checking in on me
[43:05] everything he does is for me
[43:09] he always repeats that towards me too
[43:12] every choice he makes he always thinks
[43:14] about me
[43:17] and that's what I think a father should
[43:18] do yeah
[43:26] sometimes I might not show it to him
[43:28] clearly yeah it says
[43:31] but I really do appreciate what he does
[43:32] for me
[43:37] he has unconditional love
[43:40] I can mess up sometimes
[43:43] but his love is
[43:48] when I mess up or do anything that's
[43:51] wrong
[43:54] I always say I can't do it or
[43:59] I don't know how to do it
[44:02] my dad doesn't get fat as a matter of
[44:04] the fact that I can't
[44:07] spell the fact that I say I can't say
[44:11] he tells me
[44:13] why is that your vocabulary
[44:16] he tells me never to say can't or never
[44:18] this is
[44:24] the easiest way
[44:30] really Tommy never say nevertheless
[44:43] even when he comes home every day
[44:46] good day or bad day
[44:49] I see how he treats everybody at home
[44:52] he never gets married
[44:55] if he will have a bad day at work
[44:58] [Music]
[45:01] and that's him being a role
[45:04] Modelo Never Letting anger take the best
[45:07] of him at home
[45:12] how he treats my mom how he treats me my
[45:15] brother
[45:18] he treats me my brother with
[45:20] pure love
[45:22] and he really does show it
[45:28] I have a lot of uh uncles in here too
[45:33] all my all my cousins their children are
[45:36] my best friends
[45:39] Amigos I grew up with everybody all my
[45:42] uncles
[45:44] and they're all like a father to me but
[45:49] the one uncle that always been there for
[45:52] me when I was little um
[46:00] he's my son like my second dad yeah
[46:04] that's why I call him Papa Chewie
[46:09] he he was there when my parents were
[46:11] busy at work my mom at work my dad at
[46:13] work
[46:17] I know a lot of my cousins say he would
[46:19] they were raised by him and his mom and
[46:21] his wife
[46:38] [Applause]
[46:48] God bless you
[46:51] and I'd like to wish you all a Happy
[46:52] Father's Day
[46:56] and before anything I'd like to thank my
[46:59] pastor yeah
[47:01] for having the trust to let me speak up
[47:04] here behind this pulpits
[47:07] now to go straight to the point
[47:11] what does it mean to be a father
[47:14] and what I found what it means to be a
[47:17] father
[47:19] is to be caring I said uh
[47:24] here
[47:26] look with that thank you
[47:28] he's someone that comforts you again
[47:30] someone that protects you again someone
[47:34] that loves you again someone that
[47:36] disciplines you I didn't get the
[47:38] discipline for what is Love Without
[47:39] correction
[47:42] and for me the most important is being a
[47:45] guide is
[47:52] damaro
[47:55] because the signpost he points towards
[47:58] Jesus Christ
[48:00] always wanted me to follow in those
[48:03] steps follow that
[48:06] pathos
[48:07] I believe that makes the father proud
[48:10] the most
[48:12] is that knowing the fact that his sons
[48:15] his daughters
[48:20] and a little bit about my father
[48:23] he was born in Mexico in Mexico in a
[48:27] very very humid environment
[48:31] similar to here
[48:34] but slightly hotter and more
[48:37] humidity and he came here to Phoenix
[48:40] over I want to say 25 years
[48:45] where he met my loving mother
[48:50] and together they had three crazy Sons
[48:56] with whom he had to put up with
[48:59] and probably especially my little
[49:01] brother
[49:05] God bless my father so for dealing with
[49:07] them
[49:11] and one of the most memorable things
[49:13] about him
[49:15] was when I had one of my pets
[49:20] they sadly they had sadly passed away
[49:25] and my father was here to come for me
[49:29] which is something that I'll forever be
[49:31] thankful for him
[49:36] I know that he's a very strong man
[49:41] but what I like the most about him is
[49:44] that I know that he never fails to have
[49:47] his sons in his mind
[49:51] even when he prays maybe he may not
[49:53] mention us
[49:55] but he'll always have us in his mind
[49:58] always wanting the best for us
[50:02] because he loves he loves Usama
[50:06] but he also knows when to punish us to
[50:09] discipline us
[50:12] because if he didn't love us then he
[50:14] wouldn't discipline us yeah
[50:19] and another one that I look to as my
[50:22] father
[50:24] is my grandpa is which I don't really
[50:28] get to see him
[50:30] mucho but thank God that for the past
[50:33] two or three years that he's been here
[50:37] in Phoenix
[50:39] and
[50:40] well I've spent more time since he lives
[50:43] with me
[50:46] and I've learned things remember
[50:51] and another father that I would like to
[50:53] look up to that
[50:56] all of us look up too is our father the
[51:00] Lord Our God
[51:02] he places his teachings in our fathers
[51:07] to show us El Camino
[51:12] and he Lo he loved us that he became
[51:14] flesh to suffer and die for us
[51:19] he became flesh to know our pain
[51:25] our suffering
[51:29] that's where we find life
[51:33] and one of the stories that I've heard
[51:36] my uh
[51:37] brother Javier says
[51:40] it was when we went to San Luis like a
[51:43] few weeks ago foreign
[51:51] the son acts asks the father
[51:54] how big is God
[51:57] and his father points to the sky
[52:02] and this is a small airplane or an
[52:05] airplane far away flying
[52:09] and he said that's how big God is he
[52:11] said
[52:12] and the sun said
[52:14] then he looks modern
[52:18] but the father told them to come with me
[52:22] I need to come to the airport
[52:25] and when he saw the planes there
[52:28] looked big because they were there
[52:32] and then the sun says that's a that
[52:36] plane is big
[52:39] and the father tells them to come with
[52:41] him again
[52:44] and they go in front of the plane
[52:47] and it's massive
[52:50] and the son says Dad it's Matt it's big
[52:56] and what I want the points that I want
[52:59] to get from there is
[53:01] that The Closer you are to God
[53:05] the bigger he is in your life
[53:09] and another one that I pulled out is
[53:11] that a good father
[53:14] will always raise his son in the Lord
[53:20] now
[53:22] on uh once again I'd like to wish
[53:25] everybody a Happy Father's day
[53:27] everyone that's a father here
[53:30] or everyone that has a father that may
[53:34] not be with us
[53:37] whether somewhere else or whether that
[53:40] they may have passed with the Lord
[53:44] but I know that they'll see them again
[53:47] and we'll see our heavenly father
[53:51] Celestial once you reach inside his
[53:53] throne
[53:54] God bless you
[53:57] [Applause]
[54:09] bendiga
[54:11] yeah
[54:20] foreign
[55:45] for those who don't know is my mom's dad
[55:49] this is
[55:52] and um
[55:54] one thing that I remember
[55:57] he he's he's been in my life ever since
[56:00] I was born
[56:01] you know and as someone who's always
[56:05] been there to care for me
[56:08] care for his family
[56:11] and someone who's got one of the kindest
[56:14] Hearts uh
[56:28] he was the first one to share some of
[56:31] his notes with me
[56:33] and I had I had never spoke before
[56:37] so I wasn't used to it
[56:39] and I was wondering what should I talk
[56:41] about this is
[56:43] he was the first one there to help me
[56:45] out yeah
[56:47] that's something I'll never forget
[56:50] because he's always got that help in
[56:53] hand
[56:55] yeah someone
[56:58] um
[56:59] not only a wonderful grandpa is um
[57:03] but a wonderful father
[57:06] and he has three kids
[57:10] my Uncle Albert mitio Albert my Uncle
[57:13] Paul Pablo and I did want to talk a
[57:16] little bit about my Uncle Albert as well
[57:19] Albert because he is also a father
[57:23] and he's been in my life ever since I
[57:25] can remember right yeah and
[57:29] one of the main things I wanted to bring
[57:31] up was
[57:34] he was my Sunday school teacher
[57:37] [Music]
[57:38] dominical I believe I was
[57:41] 12 to 13 year olds around that age
[57:45] and the reason I'm bringing this up is
[57:49] because he had an influence on me
[57:53] as a teacher
[57:55] and he was someone I looked up to at
[57:57] that age
[58:01] and
[58:02] they he taught me so many things
[58:06] that have helped me to this day
[58:10] yeah whether it was about God
[58:12] or about life
[58:16] and one day he wanted to bring the that
[58:18] same class back
[58:21] because it had discontinued for a while
[58:23] okay
[58:25] and the person he has to teach
[58:28] me
[58:30] obviously I was no teacher
[58:33] Maestro and I was questioning like why
[58:36] would he ask me
[58:38] I'm sure there are several different
[58:40] people he could ask
[58:44] way better than me
[58:46] and so I was questioning like why would
[58:49] you do that
[58:50] but at the time he didn't need someone
[58:55] but I knew had it been anyone else you
[58:58] know say it again if it had been anyone
[59:00] else
[59:01] I probably would have told them now
[59:04] but it was because of the trust he had
[59:06] in me
[59:08] I knew I had to trust myself
[59:12] and it was the respect I had for him
[59:16] that I told him yes
[59:17] and to this day yesterday I'm glad I'm
[59:21] able to teach just like he taught me
[59:22] yesterday
[59:25] and I'm thankful to have an uncle as
[59:28] great as him
[59:30] he's also a father
[59:33] with a daughter loves her with all his
[59:37] heart
[59:38] and I'm sure everyone can see that
[59:41] and I'm thankful I still have a grandpa
[59:45] today
[59:47] because I never knew my dad's father
[59:50] for those who don't know my other
[59:52] grandpa
[1:00:01] now one of the things I've noticed
[1:00:05] yeah my dad um tells me this is uh that
[1:00:11] every time he sees me playing an
[1:00:12] instrument
[1:00:15] he would be reminded of him because
[1:00:20] um his dad had a gift for plain
[1:00:21] instruments
[1:00:24] at his church yeah he would play I
[1:00:27] believe it was three instruments
[1:00:33] which are the three instruments I play
[1:00:37] I'm still learning to play
[1:00:42] my dad and his brothers
[1:00:44] Hermanos always told me stories
[1:00:48] and
[1:00:49] like what he was like at church
[1:00:52] as a pastor come on pastor and what he
[1:00:55] was like
[1:00:56] in La Casa
[1:00:58] I'm sure I have a ton of stories to
[1:01:01] share about him
[1:01:04] some good ones
[1:01:06] some not so good ones with his sons and
[1:01:11] um
[1:01:12] because my grandpa had a strong
[1:01:13] relationship with God
[1:01:18] and I was I was able to
[1:01:22] I see how he was able to teach
[1:01:26] each and every one of his kids
[1:01:28] because today
[1:01:31] you know I see them
[1:01:33] and you know they all have a strong
[1:01:36] relationship with God
[1:01:38] you know they're all successful in life
[1:01:41] and so I know they would talk well by
[1:01:44] both their parents
[1:01:46] and uh you know my dad told me that he
[1:01:51] wish he could ask questions to his dad
[1:01:55] about the Bible about life
[1:01:59] and why he did things the way he did
[1:02:02] yeah and I'm still glad that I have my
[1:02:06] dad to his day
[1:02:08] I feel very blessed to have my dad
[1:02:12] a father as great as him
[1:02:15] and now I want to talk a little bit
[1:02:17] about my dad
[1:02:19] someone who loves God again
[1:02:23] cares about his family
[1:02:25] and also has a strong sense of humor
[1:02:29] um
[1:02:33] it was around Christmas time last year
[1:02:38] December
[1:02:39] and he sent me a message
[1:02:42] and he was saying um how us too we're
[1:02:46] going to speak on Sunday
[1:02:57] did you tell Maya
[1:02:59] said again I told him did you tell my
[1:03:01] mom yet
[1:03:02] he was like no no no no no no no no no
[1:03:04] I'm like what's wrong
[1:03:07] because I want to freak her out
[1:03:11] okay imagine what she's gonna be like
[1:03:14] when she sees us to walking from here
[1:03:21] and uh
[1:03:23] so not only that you don't know but he
[1:03:27] also invited my Grandma
[1:03:28] I said yeah his mom and so
[1:03:33] uh after we finish speaking
[1:03:36] we head to lunch
[1:03:38] and my mom was so annoyed
[1:03:41] she told me like why didn't you tell me
[1:03:44] like he told me
[1:03:48] and especially my grandma
[1:03:51] my mom's mom she told me that she was
[1:03:55] telling her yeah
[1:03:58] he says why didn't you tell me anything
[1:04:00] he said well I didn't know and so
[1:04:05] and
[1:04:06] yeah so one of the things yeah my other
[1:04:08] grandma was the same way
[1:04:10] she's like why don't you tell me yeah
[1:04:15] well they didn't tell me anything
[1:04:17] he said sister you don't do that and I
[1:04:21] actually wanted to tell a small story
[1:04:24] about how my dad
[1:04:27] is able to understand people so
[1:04:31] in this situation he was able to
[1:04:33] understand me
[1:04:35] and so
[1:04:37] I would say it started about in November
[1:04:41] it was around the convention times
[1:04:44] [Music]
[1:04:45] and they were they were just ending
[1:04:48] and I realized uh whenever it got hot
[1:04:53] or warm or anything
[1:04:57] my skin would feel all irritated
[1:05:04] and my skin would turn a little bit red
[1:05:07] from me scratching it
[1:05:13] I couldn't sweat and
[1:05:17] it if it got too hot
[1:05:21] when you feel like it's too hot
[1:05:24] you know we live in Arizona
[1:05:28] that you you start to feel like you have
[1:05:30] to sweat
[1:05:33] but instead for me my skin will get
[1:05:36] irritated
[1:05:37] and it had happened before yeah
[1:05:40] but it would it would come for a day and
[1:05:45] then began the next yeah
[1:05:48] uh so I assumed it would go away
[1:05:51] but I was wrong
[1:05:56] and by then it had only gotten worse
[1:06:00] eventually I had to see a doctor
[1:06:03] you know they ran blood tests
[1:06:05] things like that
[1:06:08] after they were through
[1:06:10] the doctor told me the one thing I I
[1:06:14] didn't want to hear
[1:06:16] she was like you're a mystery
[1:06:19] I like Greg
[1:06:21] so they referred me to a dermatologist
[1:06:26] you know for those who have gone to see
[1:06:28] the doctor
[1:06:30] you know how difficult it could be to
[1:06:33] get an appointment
[1:06:35] I checked to see the most available
[1:06:37] times
[1:06:40] is about two months
[1:06:43] and it was annoying
[1:06:46] living like that every day
[1:06:49] one thing I remember
[1:06:52] before I went to the new doctor
[1:06:56] uh it was probably back in April
[1:07:00] it was
[1:07:02] I believe it was April it's my month to
[1:07:04] clean look it up the church here
[1:07:07] and the last day of the month
[1:07:10] I have finished cleaning in the morning
[1:07:13] I had gone outside
[1:07:16] and you know I realized the weather was
[1:07:18] getting worse
[1:07:21] and I'm outside instead of sweating
[1:07:25] I feel my skin all hot
[1:07:28] irritated you know it was terrible and
[1:07:33] so I'm upset
[1:07:35] I just remember being angry that day
[1:07:37] I said yeah I got the car
[1:07:40] I'm outside my dad asked me you ready to
[1:07:43] go
[1:07:44] yeah let's hurry up
[1:07:47] I'm just like
[1:07:50] I just remember being upset
[1:07:57] I had I had already told him about it
[1:08:01] you know I'm like this thing's still
[1:08:03] with me
[1:08:04] it's not going away I don't know what to
[1:08:07] do like it had been continuous
[1:08:12] and I just got so angry yeah and
[1:08:19] you know because I was outside for five
[1:08:21] seconds
[1:08:26] and so after the night service
[1:08:31] we're driving home is you know in the
[1:08:35] car I'm looking in the mirror story I'm
[1:08:38] like man it's starting to spread to my
[1:08:40] face
[1:08:41] it's like what are you doing
[1:08:43] like look you can see it right
[1:08:46] yeah but acknowledging it isn't going to
[1:08:49] do nothing better
[1:08:51] you prayed about it right I was like
[1:08:54] yeah so now you just gotta believe it
[1:08:58] you know I've been telling my students
[1:09:02] all these things of how important it is
[1:09:04] to believe
[1:09:06] but how's that going to work for me
[1:09:08] if I wasn't even believing at the time
[1:09:11] and
[1:09:16] to give an example
[1:09:18] we were at lunch one day
[1:09:21] it was just me and my two parents
[1:09:25] and it started getting high in the
[1:09:27] restaurant
[1:09:29] you know my mom would hate seeing me
[1:09:32] like that
[1:09:33] she was like what's wrong
[1:09:36] like it's the same thing is
[1:09:39] I don't do that it freaks me out
[1:09:43] but my dad's like live on
[1:09:46] he he
[1:09:48] is going through something
[1:09:50] that it's it's bad for him basically
[1:09:52] yeah
[1:09:55] you know because
[1:09:58] it's not something common right
[1:10:00] like I don't blame you if you don't
[1:10:02] understand like
[1:10:04] uh my condition I was in foreign
[1:10:10] and so
[1:10:14] um that's that's one of the things my
[1:10:16] dad understood me yeah
[1:10:19] and there weren't many people who did
[1:10:21] you know
[1:10:23] you know whenever I told them about it
[1:10:27] are you crazy
[1:10:29] and like I remember the first time it
[1:10:32] wasn't always like that though
[1:10:33] and the first time I told my dad
[1:10:37] uh I told him what was wrong
[1:10:40] I was telling both my parents
[1:10:43] and he was like all right
[1:10:46] you just don't worry about it
[1:10:49] but in time you go to understand
[1:10:53] and that's something I appreciated
[1:10:56] and so I trusted his word and this is
[1:11:01] but I believed with all my heart
[1:11:04] because I would always expect it to be
[1:11:06] there the next day
[1:11:09] and that was a problem
[1:11:12] and
[1:11:13] so I went to the doctor
[1:11:16] you know I was a little nervous I had
[1:11:19] never been in this kind of situation
[1:11:21] before
[1:11:23] and so what happened is
[1:11:31] that was back to normal
[1:11:33] and I'm thankful that my dad was able to
[1:11:37] be there for me okay for me and able to
[1:11:42] understand me
[1:11:43] because I know at times
[1:11:48] there could be times where you
[1:11:51] you wonder services
[1:11:54] do they really understand me and
[1:11:59] that that's one thing I appreciate
[1:12:02] because my dad was able to understand me
[1:12:04] at the time
[1:12:07] and I could tell that he was taught well
[1:12:09] by his father
[1:12:13] by his mother
[1:12:16] and overall
[1:12:19] he's always been such a caring person
[1:12:21] yes
[1:12:23] love this family
[1:12:30] and always someone who's trustworthy
[1:12:34] someone I can rely on
[1:12:38] um
[1:12:41] shows respect to others
[1:12:45] which means they will show respect to
[1:12:47] him
[1:12:49] someone responsible responsibly takes
[1:12:52] responsibility as a father
[1:12:54] responsibility
[1:12:55] takes responsibility of being you know a
[1:12:59] dad of a family of you know he has two
[1:13:01] kids
[1:13:03] having a wife
[1:13:06] and overall I'm just thankful you know
[1:13:09] my sister I feel very blessed
[1:13:12] to have my father my grandpa and Mia
[1:13:16] Willow my uncles and I'm thankful to
[1:13:18] have a father like God as well
[1:13:21] because whatever the situation may be
[1:13:25] some people may not have a father
[1:13:30] but they do have God
[1:13:32] and he's a father to all of us
[1:13:36] and I'm going to close with this
[1:13:38] I just want to say Happy Father's Day
[1:13:44] so those who may be watching online
[1:13:47] and hopefully you have a wonderful
[1:13:49] Father's Day
[1:13:54] [Applause]
[1:14:07] I'm not going to take a lot of time
[1:14:09] maybe a half an hour to an hour I have a
[1:14:15] I like to see your smiles
[1:14:20] what I'd like you to do is sit and the
[1:14:22] only ones I want standing are the
[1:14:25] fathers so if you're a father just stay
[1:14:28] standing
[1:14:31] God I thought I had more fathers than
[1:14:32] that
[1:14:36] what I'd like to do for the fathers
[1:14:40] is give him a clap offering
[1:14:49] thank you gracias I also want to
[1:14:52] acknowledge
[1:14:54] first of all hearing with the three
[1:14:56] spoke
[1:15:01] I knew brother Francisco
[1:15:06] your dad
[1:15:08] your uncles
[1:15:13] it was my pastor just so you know I went
[1:15:17] to church in Juarez
[1:15:20] and brothers
[1:15:28] everything that you don't know about him
[1:15:30] he was genuine
[1:15:32] he loved to laugh
[1:15:35] maybe not in front of a lot of people
[1:15:38] but he would laugh I'd take him I'd
[1:15:41] drive him to Phoenix
[1:15:43] and those times I lived in El Paso
[1:15:48] and we would talk
[1:15:51] at that time I think
[1:15:53] Nate you might have been maybe two years
[1:15:55] old
[1:15:57] Danny might have been a little older
[1:16:00] Daniel
[1:16:01] uh
[1:16:04] I I knew Danny's dad
[1:16:08] a friend of mine one of the individuals
[1:16:11] that would tell me your Spanish is
[1:16:14] horrible
[1:16:16] but at least you try
[1:16:19] so I was able to
[1:16:22] know the brothers from Juarez
[1:16:36] two years ago maybe three years ago I
[1:16:39] talked to Brother Carlos
[1:16:41] I said we're going to lose our young
[1:16:44] people if we don't put them to work
[1:16:47] I cannot lose the young people
[1:16:52] the majority of the time they're the
[1:16:55] ones that are going to be doing
[1:16:56] everything
[1:16:57] they're going to be speakers
[1:17:00] they're going to be working in the back
[1:17:02] in the audio
[1:17:03] they're going to learn everything in
[1:17:06] order to keep them busy
[1:17:11] I never knew
[1:17:13] it would come out to this
[1:17:15] that we have the cream of the crop and
[1:17:19] the young people
[1:17:20] and the reason I say this is I'm looking
[1:17:24] at your jeans
[1:17:28] I'm looking at your genes where your
[1:17:30] Dads
[1:17:31] Dads I'm looking at your desk where they
[1:17:35] came from
[1:17:37] and what they taught
[1:17:41] and the discipline that they gave
[1:17:43] people may not agree with discipline
[1:17:47] but let me tell you discipline and
[1:17:50] obedience plays an important part
[1:17:53] and what your kids will be when they get
[1:17:58] to be your age and they have kids of
[1:18:01] their own
[1:18:02] that's what it's all about is
[1:18:06] the next Generation coming are they
[1:18:09] prepared have we prepared them enough to
[1:18:14] understand
[1:18:15] that someone
[1:18:17] paved the way
[1:18:20] I look back
[1:18:23] I see brother Francisco facio
[1:18:27] the way he was
[1:18:30] leaning on a
[1:18:32] Persona putting all his faith in one man
[1:18:40] Garcia
[1:18:42] put all his attention there
[1:18:47] because I spoke to English you'd ask me
[1:18:50] questions and I'd look at them like I
[1:18:52] don't have the answer for that
[1:18:57] but this is the way he was
[1:18:59] he believed in people
[1:19:02] he believed in a future
[1:19:07] I left in the late 70s mid 70s
[1:19:12] because I heard the voice
[1:19:15] of an individual
[1:19:18] that my pastor followed him in his name
[1:19:23] again not ashamed to mention it
[1:19:33] a man that would give you his coat
[1:19:38] whatever he had that's why he used to
[1:19:41] say don't give me money
[1:19:43] give it to the sister give it to Lily
[1:19:47] because every time somebody gives me
[1:19:49] money I would lose it put it in the
[1:19:53] pocket or as Trini would say it went
[1:19:56] from his hand to somebody else
[1:19:59] that's how he was and we forget
[1:20:04] we forget who brought us a message
[1:20:14] was the individual
[1:20:17] stayed there day and night praying for
[1:20:20] us so that we would get to a level that
[1:20:25] they were in that's called a father
[1:20:34] what we should do in life
[1:20:37] we are the byproducts
[1:20:43] we are a byproduct of our father
[1:20:48] and they were a byproduct of their
[1:20:52] father and they were a byproduct of the
[1:20:56] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:20:59] so what is it to be a father
[1:21:02] I've heard
[1:21:04] attributes of a father
[1:21:07] each one giving recognition
[1:21:11] descriptive words is
[1:21:15] Paris but a father cannot be a father
[1:21:20] it has to be at the same time that a son
[1:21:25] or daughter is born that he receives the
[1:21:27] name or the title of father
[1:21:30] he can't be a father unless he has a
[1:21:35] child in this case he cannot be a father
[1:21:39] until the moment that the son is born
[1:21:43] then he becomes a father
[1:21:46] that's what we've been taught that's
[1:21:49] what has to be talk to our children
[1:21:53] the same way it was in the beginning
[1:21:59] he loved the world so much that he gave
[1:22:02] his only begotten son no
[1:22:07] let me tell you
[1:22:10] the son has to give the father a gift
[1:22:15] what gift will you give your father
[1:22:18] your heavenly father if it's not your
[1:22:22] son if it's not your daughter if it's
[1:22:25] not a stepson but it will happen
[1:22:31] that we will in turn
[1:22:33] give and Jesus or Jesus Christ
[1:22:37] give his father a gift and that gift is
[1:22:41] you and I let me say it again the gift
[1:22:44] that Jesus will give the father is
[1:22:54] again and this is what they're not my
[1:22:57] words excuse me
[1:23:06] where did he get it from
[1:23:09] the person called
[1:23:11] William Marion
[1:23:14] what brother Bernie said he took it from
[1:23:17] Brother Branham can you say Amen so we
[1:23:22] are not following a new doctrine you're
[1:23:25] not following a person
[1:23:27] that has his own character his own ideas
[1:23:31] I have a vision my vision our vision is
[1:23:36] the same position that our forefathers
[1:23:38] had that's when souls for Jesus Christ
[1:23:42] and how are we doing it there's the
[1:23:45] example
[1:23:48] that you are doing
[1:23:49] your work your responsibility
[1:23:55] I look at our kids
[1:24:00] and they are the best
[1:24:03] I'm amazed I'm happy
[1:24:09] because what we have produced
[1:24:12] so let me tell you I want you to do me a
[1:24:16] favor father stand up
[1:24:21] without you
[1:24:24] the vision that we have the vision that
[1:24:28] brother Brennan had the vision brother
