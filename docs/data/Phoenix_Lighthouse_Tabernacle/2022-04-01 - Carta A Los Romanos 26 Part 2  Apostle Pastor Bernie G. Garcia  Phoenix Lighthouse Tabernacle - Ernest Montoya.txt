TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] it says there and out of his mouth go with a sharp sword that with it he should smite the nations out of his mouth like from god's mouth to moses's mouth that god speaks to a vessel and that the sharp sword comes from there's two main things that i want you to notice and we can open our bibles to see the first one juan diaz saint john chapter 10. before reading the verse i want to ask you what comes out of god's mouth okay and if the word comes out john chapter 10. if he called them gods and to whom the word of god came and the scripture cannot be broken the prophet so [Music] how many of you want to exercise that word in your life [Music] said that our worst enemy is our self we want to subjugate or bring someone under something for something else we have to subjugate ourselves [Music] is that right is [Music] second third and then we're going to get to the fourth step number two the prophet shepard and then the sheep how many of you believe that god through the prophet of this age is a prophet pastor but also sheep there also jesus shepherd jesus jesus jesus shepherd and then sheep then now number four god the holy spirit i'd like to ask you nothing sheep who bears who gives birth to sheep el pastor the pastor or the sheep no ego the sheep is i have it first why do i bear sheep why as a pastor do i give birth to sheep a pastor and a sheep is that right subject a lamb subject alpaca [Music] everything has their orders everyone should have a place where they call their typos the shepherd and jesus prophet sheppard they said jesus is my shepherd if he is our shepherd it's all in a scale of an order he gave us examples he says a lot of people a lot of people say well if they made me can i straightened out the thing right away straighten it out but first of all you don't even straighten yourself out and i know that when you say that a lot of people think boy he's crazy and i i know that they have a right to believe like that because they're not thinking like i'm thinking i'm thinking everything brother bannon said and as i think that i come to that conclusion jesus christ back in the camp that's strange isn't it yes they 316. out of my mouth now that's a he you there i am i felt this there you are there it is and we have to overcome subject matter we have to subjugate subdue is ourselves he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches to him that overcomes i will give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god don't forget this is the throne once again tree there's a hybrid mixture that's not the tree of life the only one of that fruit is that he that overcomes who's going to cast out the devil [Music] and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels you forgive me i hadn't explained what people think we're gonna go to heaven and then this is gonna be fulfilled is that right or whatever let us go back there was a war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the idea and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed neither was their place found anymore in heaven and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceives the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him in a herd of love voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our god day and night now this is about to happen it's not and they overcame him by the blood of the lord and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto death we were brought [Music] let's look at revelation chapter 20. cast a devil to the earth do not subject themselves and i saw an angel come down from heaven having the kia of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his his hand and it came it came to god in other words and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is a devil and satan and bound him a thousand years that is he tied him up for us for a thousand taking us leave this until i make sure you've understood me revelation chapter 12 i'm doing nothing but repeating this morning by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony they love not their lives unto that there will be the children question uh first again and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony [Music] and they love not their lives unto death in other words they love not their lives he said no no yo yo oh that's my life all right you know what they're saying i'm placing my hand life in my hands life in the hands of god now the word cain will say well the word came to the prophet that's right there's a lot of messages from 1916 from 1933 to 1963 subjects 30 years a stature of a perfect man start speaking is and to is i don't even remember that much as a believer oh the son of god even though i know in the name of the lord [Music] you
