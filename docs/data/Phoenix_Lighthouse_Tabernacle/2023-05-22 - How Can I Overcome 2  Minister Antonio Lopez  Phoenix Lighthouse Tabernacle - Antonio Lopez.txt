in your hands [Music] perfect and divine will name the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen foreign [Music] it's one of the last books it's a very short book s opportunity to take advantage of this time I think the Lord and my pastor for the opportunity it's a lot of trust that he's placed on me I hope that he's proud in the word of God reads is [Music] for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not Grievous Al Mundo yesterday for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith amen Reynolds amen you may take your sheets Brothers I liked a lot when I read the scripture is when I heard that word Grievous it's almost as I understood but I also didn't understand at the same time it's like I knew where the word came from but I didn't understand how the word was being used when I want to go look what a man's or where they come from another word which is grave or something a word that means heavy [Music] the Commandments of God are not in that way that's a word that's usually used to talking something in a negative way so if you didn't know I can explain a little bit here I hope that helped you a little bit we're going to continue with how can I overcome and it's a very beautiful topic the more we read about the topic the more we learn more things are revealed when you think our everything has already been covered did you open a whole new point of view um how many are ready to serve the Lord sometimes we think well it's not my law to preach we all have to be at 100 when we come to church we all have a part in the plan of God we all have to be completely prepared we have to all be on the same page amen amen because we're like an army if one does not do his part or the other doesn't do his part that you can damage perhaps another department amen amen amen so we continue uh Hermanos when we come at church brothers [Music] and we're preparing ourselves maybe that same day or maybe the previous day [Music] we have to come to church that if it's healing spiritual if you don't feel that you're right with your spiritual life that we have to come with that in mind we have to come and believing that that's going to improve we have to come expecting that God is going to work on those things amen amen because even though God knows all things he likes when his children ask him he likes when you go to him in prayer he says and you ask him for what you need or you ask him for someone else because that is where God sees he sees your character he sees what stage you're on in your spiritual life and he can give you what you need in your life so I read a quote from Brother Benham speaking on this topic the message is led by the Holy Spirit from 1952. like what it says he says he says you get what you're looking for instance If You're Expecting tonight to get healed you're going to get healed have you come to the meeting tonight to say well I'll see what goes on yo okay if you say I know that's not right the devil will show you something that isn't right it depends on you what do you want in today do you want a blessing do you want to live better or do you want to leave worse man amen it's something that's just like everything else is something in which you need to practice something in which you need knowledge you don't just say I'm gonna overcome I have to know anything I'm just going to do it which is like an athlete or a teacher a doctor it's something you have to study it's something you have to learn something that requires practice Ben says Ben says Ben says you overcome overcome in the bacteria and the victories become bigger and bigger Allah maybe you say well brother I haven't seen any great miracle in my life I haven't seen God save me from a great accent or nothing has happened to me sooner than later but we're going to go through it [Music] and God's going to give us the trials that we need that we can withstandard he's not going to give us something bigger if we're already start barely starting off because he wants us to grow in the small victories then the next victims get larger and then you get the greatest one of all hello and then when you look back did you see that if it wouldn't have been for God you wouldn't have made it because it's something that has no explanations it's something that the human mind cannot comprehend amen Brothers are you throw uh there's another Court here quote here that I'd like to mention it's the the heart the door to the heart the uh hear them in the beginning of the message uh he said he says that's the way it is with the church God is painting a picture of a beautiful holy church and before it can ever be taken from the earth in the Palace of God a first must pass down the line of the critics amen Brothers here we're being compared to a painting or to a picture or drawing or whatever you want to call it uh okay foreign amen amen because there's things that only God himself can do yeah amen amen it's like if I was at work I've had the privilege to watch some surgeries let's say I start telling the doctor what don't do that oh stop doing that if I'm lucky they're going to tell me to get out the surgery room because it's something that you don't do is you let that person do it because they've done it for years and everything they needed in order to do that yes it's the same way with God yes and it's even more so with God because he knows all things everything we've seen and everything we haven't seen he already knows it man amen all that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecutions also we're we're two parents the manner of evil about you falsely for my name's sake mintiendo he is and this artist painted the picture of Jesus knocking at the door when it went through the critics [Music] one rose and said sir there's just one thing that I can find wrong with the picture is that is you do not have any latch on the door and when I heard that word I've never heard that word used in that context I've heard maybe a doorknob pasadores or uh when you grab the door handle or any other names you have for a door handle uh all those words but I've never heard the word yes that's what's helped me in many occasions that I stopped and I find out what the word means is I painted it that way he said that door is a door to the heart is and the latch is on the inside you have to open the door I mean Hermanos amen brothers that's where you take control and you can open that door give all of our heart to God we have to do a hundred percent because that's not the way God works it's all or nothing man amen and there's many times in our lives [Music] that God wants the changes [Music] he wants to give us that peace that we desire he wants us to be better with him in the car in traffic that's right those are just excuses Brothers see and stand on the word of God we can't be at the right or on the left we can't we have we can't be in the middle we have to either be with God or we're going to stand on the other side with the devil God says he doesn't like lukewarm is hot or cold amen Amen on Saturday you can't be with your friends that's not how God works you have to make your decision amen amen so you our victories are becoming bigger in a moment I'll be closing one more quote from the message the deity of Lord Jesus Christ here he is praying he's finishing up a prayer he says if there are any lost in here to Santo any without the holy spirit for we ask in the name of thy dear beloved Son Jesus Jesus a few days after that uh 40 days later in Gloria he was received up in glory yes then 10 days later Santo came again in the power of the Holy Ghost and now living in the church so he's living here with us not in this building but in our hearts if he lives in us it is what he did when he was here on Earth we can do it as well we can do it as well but it depends on our faith saying the holy ghost in the church to take it out for we ask it in his name and Hermanos amen Brothers you could please stand with this I'll be closing [Music] the most important thing is that we have to get up there's a lot of the mistakes we've made but it matters that we're getting back up we'll continue getting back up then we continue in the path of God and we stayed down yes that's when we go out of sight yes that's when we're no longer on the side of God we put God to the side so it's so important to get back up [Music] because I can decide what's going to happen in our life it can bring healing it can bring any Miracles [Music] a miracle maybe doesn't come the next day maybe it doesn't come in a year foreign [Music] God is looking at your faith and he will take charge of everything else let us pray heavenly father thank you a lot you always give us more than what we need you always give us more [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] in the name of Lord Jesus Christ amen amen [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] to wash Myself Away [Music] amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] Amazing Grace [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] like [Music] zombies [Music] [Music] hello [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Speedy today [Music] whether they're gone [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] Fly Away [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] we happy blessed be the name of the Lord will be dismissing shortly beforehand we want to thank you [Music] I'm Bev our pastor in Phoenix for you made to be here in this evening and we would like to invite you
