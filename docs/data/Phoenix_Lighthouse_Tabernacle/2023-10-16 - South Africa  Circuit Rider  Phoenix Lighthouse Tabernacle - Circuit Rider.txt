plead this morning that you help us and give us according to your perfect way thank you for all things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated once again may the Lord bless you it's a pleasure to be here it's been a week some we gone back from [Music] Africa I'm just gonna give a small report of the great things that God is doing you believe that he's the same yesterday today he is still working he's still saving Souls he's Healing The [Music] Sick he's giving Liberty to the ones that are captive he's still doing the same thing on the slides I'm going to show you some pictures I wanted to put a map on the place that we were but because of time Johannesburg johanes it's a big city AFA in South Africa many people would they they think when we say Africa that's the whole continent Brothers AFA South Africa it's a country in the continent of Africa Johannesburg or johannesburgo Johannesburg it's a city in the country but it's not the capital it's a very beautiful country it has a lot of nature it's very beautiful had a pleasant weather their Summer started but for us it was a little chilly and we had a good time with the brothers the first place where we visited brother M you know him or you remember him he's preached here a couple of times an invitation that they made because they were going to have special services for me it's a privilege to travel with my pastor truly you feel unworthy the truth is we must be OB to know that God has a calling for every one of us and we must obey that call sometimes you don't want to go what am I going to do there but God has a purpose I'm a person that has helped by a person a brother that came from another country when I was lost in drugs a brother came he came from another country he didn't say much but just very small [Music] words he spoke to me exactly what I needed to hear to be able to go back I thought that I was completely lost but the words that he spoke to me the adequate person and I am one of them that has received that [Music] benefit person that comes from another continent country just to give me a few words of love and that is what we're doing truly for me it's a privilege to stay in the room brother be able to talk to him I felt very [Music] privileged first service let's go to [Music] it I like the theme of the convention they had the back the hearts of the father of the children the faith Apostolic Faith and truly Brothers it's necessary Bible tells us that with faith it is impossible to God we must have faith we must know who we are and we know that faith is revelation when you have faith you have revelation we must recognize who we are truly we're special people it's not you that's doing the work when you able to get yourself and let God work through you he is the one that's doing the work he is helping he is saving but he needs hands he needs a mouth he needs a voice he needs feet he works through every man that's God's plan that he chose he wants to use you and me to reach all those where you can give them words of love and encouragement to be able to help just one person and that's how God is where is God he is hidden in skin in every one of his children and he has a purpose for every one of us there in the Church of brother Mundi Tabernacle reth I like the name of the Tabernacle I have to look it up in the Bible I really like it because it's a well but of Living [Music] Water for it's a privilege to be with this men and have a good time in the Lord what I like about [Music] Africa was maybe I was where I am I I hold back a little but within myself sometimes I want I want to cry I want to run you held back because you say you have to loen up and let God use you don't hold back on he wants to use you what matters what people say are we crazy this is the madness I when I was out in the world I was nuts go to dances and now how I'm not going to dance here the house of the Lord because I love that everybody knows me as a person that's quiet maybe timid but what's inside of me I want to jump and scream especially when the presence of the Lord comes down when I had many pictures of me because I was the one that had taking the pictures thank God for [Music] that were there Friday morning I mean Saturday morning took the service and we had a good time in the Lord there are people that truly love God they have a tremendous faith [Music] Faith where we struggle here sometimes but over there they do believe 100% they believe what the prophet said and that's the most important there are things we don't understand there are things that I don't understand but I believe them and sooner or later God will give us that we just need to stay still this is the Church of brother truly it's a house it was his house that he turned it into a church they on the back it's it's a full church was giving some words Brothers came from other countries the majority of most of them are from the Congo they speak French I wish I could speak French speak a few words just but not enough but I love different languages were here they know brother he's a very special man believe with all my heart when you have faith there is nothing impossible for God are no limits for god brother were ordaining and Minister we were able to go and do that as well brother Mundi loves our pastor before I forget he s SC I wish he wishes he could be here with us again and one day he'll [Music] be did a prayer Lane many people received their healing receive the holy spirit because God is still in that business you want the holy spirit it's for you even the desire that you have in your heart was placed by God because it's for you but you have to ask for it brother are here hugging each other didn't know but they want to have children there is nothing impossible for God I believe with all my heart if God allows us to go back we'll be there once again there's too many pictures we [Music] took sat Friday Saturday and Sunday Services we had there boxberg we went to another another city boxberg forun it's a church of brother Fortune I gave a small testimony there since I was one taking pictures there's not too many pictures I went to another convention brother Jack is a brother that L brother Montoya and the theme of their we would see Jesus truly we had a good service God poured out did a good job for me to know my brother to live with [Music] him be there together there in a room and know us a little bit better a great I respect them I love them you know how brother Montoya is this is Sunday morning he brought a good service how that woman wanted to touch the ham of His Garment of Jesus truly God poured out in this is the wife of sister jock Jack and his two children there two children here they're uh twins prayed for them when they couldn't have any babies and God gave them two they are witnesses of what God can do Shalom Tabernacle the Tabernacle is called Shalom Tabernacle johb it is also in Johannesburg they prepared good food they made some flour tortillas that we weren't expecting but that's how they love our pastor I wanted to put this this was something outstanding for me brother was asking for prayer he's a trucker johbur he was going to go from joh it's a four day trip he couldn't go to church but I believe with all my heart that he was asking he was praying and God brought the person to pray for him and he received his Blessing my time is up I'm gonna speak tonight I'm gonna continue with the report but I believe with all my heart I'm happy to be here but there's nothing impossible for God if we could just only believe if you can just believe there is nothing impossible been a Witnesses of witness of that and when you pray brother BR tells us that changes they can change the program change God's program When you pray people people from afar they're waiting if he could come down bring down a plane for one person if this trip was just for one person that's enough because we know that a soul is worth more than 10,000 so Brothers God bless you to be here at [Applause] home may the Lord bless everyone it's a pleasure to be back being back at home I want to thank our pastor for the opport this morning I appreciate the way they respect them the place that Brothers in Africa give him for what he has done for his ministry but sometimes when I was there he said I want to have the strength that he has I thought I was even more tired than he was so much what he has been doing theast couple months when he went to Vietnam he was there by himself he came back went to colia went to Peru Mexico and we still practically almost went for a month it's something that I truly appreciate much the effort that he makes the love that he has for the souls how he gives himself dedication for this gospel and this message to keep alive the apostolic message that's a great example for us appreciate much our pastor and I believe we have the [Music] best Brothers in Africa appreciate him much ad him they're always asking for advice very happy to have the privilege to travel with him to be able to be part of that God gave him to be able to be part of that fulfillment of vision appreciate much and we keep there in our [Music] heart to be uh thank him uh publicly so supported to be stay within the room someone with another character to be able to stand keep up with me that's why I appreciate much my wife I want to like to thank because someone when you leave the wife stays here it's it's a team effort you can't do one thing without the other I thank my wife much his brother Manuel is his wife and his family more than anything brother sister [Music] L the work that our pastor does I do it because of sister Lita it's not easy but God has a plan in all [Music] things brother man I believe the Lord has special way something special he takes pictures by itself the phone that he has no you take the pictures we're going to take good pictures say a fault we're going to make a presentation when he comes out he thinks maybe he's not going to come out on the pictures but he [Music] is tell when you're ready we were in a couple of [Music] churches my brother Joel M brother Manny said he send GRE to the whole church want go to this churches David gones Brother David gonz johb Pastor in Johannesburg Florida it's Florida it's a suburb of the city conted him so we can go visit him and his church Brothers had fellowship with him so they kept us busy for two weeks two weeks we didn't have any rest we couldn't stop service after service brother M went from Friday to Sunday we got there on Thursday Friday special services began we had just five services with him Monday Tuesday we started again the journey for the rest of the week services on Tuesday Thursday we start next special services brother Jack Jack Jack what do you what do you call him jack [Music] that's how I remember the name of a person for a while that's why I would tell the brother Jack that's how we had the meet a convention with him we still over there brother to the church we were there at a church that is called Paradox Church Paradox Tabernacle Tabernacle there are a lot of brothers most of them speak French were translated to French it was a blessing to be able to be with them AF Africa Brothers it's different what you know it's completely different because of our culture as Hispanics in certain way we have a lot of complexes we have a lot of [Music] complexes our worship completely God we worship genuinely but we like to Worship in secret like to Worship in our heart it's a genuine worship what I like about Africa with all their heart genuine worship and they will let you know that they're worshiping with all their heart they're not they're not embarrassed about and they're not ashamed shout and we all know that everything has it place we understand that to begin to worship care to the right or to the left they don't care who see their desires and have that contact with God they want to have that contact with the Holy Spirit they don't care any about anything el else that's their main priority just to be able to receive something for that service that they came for situations are so difficult speaking to people how much people how much money they make go that place or in the hotel they were making a dollar an hour maybe dollar an hour and we would to see the prices of the food how is this possible how they could live with those wages how can they live how can they continue on there are people so humble that when they go to church maybe they have financial problems personal [Music] problems everywhere we go it's the same problem something the same problems that we have here is the same problems that they have there but to see how they loosen everything up and they put everything in it energizes our spirit then you begin to balance things out and begin to really think what's really important what what matters we have our things in priority things paring things are shouldn't be there in it makes you meditate the way they surrender the the way they're looking that way they're not embarrassed and to show everyone else that they're worshiping as God as soon as God starts moving moving in Spirit they immediately go into the wor they're not resisting the Holy Spirit they let the Holy Spirit flow and that's What Makes Miracles come many won't happen because we limit god with our thinking God wants to move a certain way and we began to reason when we see the way they the way they surrender that takes the liit and miracles begin to happen things happen that normally you shouldn't because people themselves are taking away the limits they're taking away limits so that God can come and do whatever he wants to do just a small [Music] presentation hu I am that I am there is no one like [Music] is no like like you Hallelujah [Music] hallelu [Music] [Music] [Music] without Papa I am will [Music] Tove I say unto you that Jesus Christ the son of God told his disciples to go and preach the gospel heal the sick and raise the and [Music] the r [Music] [Music] hallelu Hallelujah hallelujah [Music] hallelujah amen so for for an experience it's a very special makes us see that it's real the truly Jesus Christ is the same yesterday yesterday today and forever all we have to do have the requirement to be able to bring God in the hearts of to the apostolic fathers the teach we through the years to bring through the message of the we have received apply to our heart so that in the time that we live in when we have the right attitude when we have the faith the Revelation the understanding simp you don't need a supernatural the Bas of super Fai is God says something word speaks to us the word says only believe that's all we need just only believe I'm GNA give the place to our pastor just as a testimony one of the times we were there finished one of the meetings going to go to another church you're going to speak there soon as he said that minutes went by something began to happen within me that I couldn't hear something happened here how come I can't hear anything I wasn't paying attention to it I went to get ready take shower I'm not going to pay attention to that when I went out shower I felt that my that the ear opened up then this one closed even more now and I couldn't hear anything out of the other one possible maybe it's my imagination I would cover one up and then the other one I'm leave it like as as that we were there at the service services and I was waiting you know thoughts come the enemy has to come and play with our mind it happens to all of us no one is accept of this isn't it right that the Lord Jesus Christ same y today and forever what are we going to tell him what do we do that's the greatest battle the battle that was in heaven great battle in heaven many times we think it was with weapons with it was a fight of words it was trying to convince someone which side would you going to take to see which side we're going to take of our en fa or unbelief one other there's nothing in the middle Lord Jesus Christ the yesterday today and forever how come you can't hear it's all right question right I'm still going to preach and what are you going to preach when I was preaching all I turn your pastor they were speaking to me and they weren't I began to pray I didn't come all the way right here to go we're just starting off it's not going to happen and the war word of argum who's right who's wrong within my mind he said I believe Jesus Christ same yesterday today and forever and I declared it doesn't matter what happens I'm going to preach what I believe yesterday today forever God still deliv he still healed he's still Healing The Sick afterwards I but before I go to sleep today I will be hearing again and I stayed with that all of a sudden when I was back in I felt something pop Within Me opened up and then this one opened [Music] up I could hear the birds out there in the morning why matter we must stand on what we believe does matter what BR we must stand we say we believe soon or later our faith has to be proven the first we have we're going to run out then what are we believing in let continue open up your heart this morning whatever you need at this time God can give it to you it's not a coincidence that you're here we're going to let God that God use the plan that he has our pastor of the church bring us this words open up your heart may the Lord bless you stand up for a minute God bless you uh it started in March that we had been going up and down just like job wherever God goes the devil's there uh the devil has the right to enter our mind distort our mind but we have and we have been identified my vision take your seats please my vision has always been an Apostolic Vision what ber brought us that's what we follow nothing new it has been preached and what we do is we just feed off of what our Apostle taught us uh and as long as there's blood in this body we will continue preaching what he brought and the good thing about Africa they're very spiritual brother Brenham said in Africa every time someone would speak they would use quote the quote was on the on the screen in other words just one word the hits that they received was there in front of so I thank first of all the wives of these two individuals because without them I couldn't have made it it's not age it's not tiredness but what we need to do we're a team it's no longer one person it now is a team it has to be a team effort in other words if I don't have a team I'm going to lose you're going to lose the people are going to lose as long as we stay identified with what brother Brenham said as long as we are trained the way we should be trained before we go out to be sent you need to be trained so we believe that with all our heart what I need to do and what I do I know the people wanted me to speak I already know that I took enough messages to speak 15 messages that's not it what we have to do is show the individuals what we have been producing what Paul taught what Paul taught what he believed was what he saw in Jesus Christ what brother Bram taught what he believed he saw in St Paul what ber saw and taught and believe is what he saw in William Mary and Brenham what this church this chosen Church believes today is that we believe our Apostle but we will teach we will not go away and that is why we train why teams because you want to hear he me I need to make sure everybody knows who they are why because sooner or later someone has to take that Banner to different places the Bible says go into all the world give me 10 individuals and I'll conquer what the world give me 10 individuals and I shall conquer the world later in life he said give me one self-sufficient individual that will conquer world that's this church the church has to continue the teaching of that Apostolic Faith it won't go away as long as there's blood life a desire a vision then this will continue no coincidence Hallelujah when our pastor our Apostle dedicated the church on 35th Street 35th Avenue and he said this is the pattern Church of all churches voice of restoration he didn't make a mistake you are chosen I want you to say it I have been chosen I have been chosen you have been chosen we have been chosen take the gospel don't tell me I'm tired don't tell me I'm weak don't tell me I have no money tell me that you're identified what the Apostle brought us that changes the scenario that changes the life of indivual and that's what they want they want more of him because they're watching you how many hits do we get I don't know the internet how many hits we get procession for each service I'm going to tell you they see you they either see you smiling they either see you preoccupied or they see you rejoicing just like in Africa brother Bram said they were special people what about us what did he say about the Hispanic people tell me what he said you're the most humble in the indidual those people from Phoenix Arizona pH from Brother Garcia's church are a byproduct we are a byproduct of the main Church according to what we've been taught and we will keep it going we will not stop until each country that speaks Spanish Latinos receive our Apostles message so I tell you brother Brenham said this led by the spirit a little old fellow down there laying down by the pool of Bethesda been L laying there 38 years 38 years this person was there laying in his C years is that a long time waiting for that angel to come for that angel to heal him brother Brenham goes with an infirmity his body how many of us have infirmities all let me tell you I'm going to say it again how many of us have a sickness in bodies I am bread there is a sickness in our body don't tell me there's not in the mind it's either in your soul or in your tissues matter what we do there's an infection because we're called humans I heard brother B and brother Bernie said you're worth how much 80 what 83 cents full of what 16 elements you dress it you look in the mirror you admire it and you have worms that one day will destroy this body but we have the assurance that that day when it comes something will res this body are you identified with that are you identified with what brother Brenham brought are you identified what you believe what you hold dear he continues to say praying with all their heart how many of us pray with all our heart if not for our kids our LED ones our neighbors our Associates at work we pray day and night somebody's going to hear it that is why when I take a team do I do all the preaching when I go do I do all the preaching when I go do I do all the teaching when I go I need to build a a special force that they're not afraid of devils that come and tell you that there's something wrong I need individuals soldiers that will fight a good fight and know that they have been chosen by God they were baptized no before the foundation of the world you were chosen I don't care what you look like I don't care what you've done I want to see the result result in you that you can go out put your foot Toe to Toe with the devil and say what he is he's a bluffer he's a liar say amen amen so what I like about these two individual lot of things I liked look what I like about them is they're simple they can take a joke how many of you can take a joke and the reason I say it from because I don't have a religious spirit I used to but when brother Paul Garcia junor told me be careful going to take 20 years before indidual what you've done what did I do look at your face I look at my face every day I see the same thing God made me what I am ugly so pardon my French but it did take 25 years before a generation had to so I tell you give me a fa love each other if somebody says something against you they offend you love them it's hard when you and I can see on all things it's easy because he's a friend because he's a brother but what about the person that doesn't believe what you believe see you got to love the person you got to pray for the person that's your weapon that's my secret of all the success that I've had in the mission field the only reason we're successful is because we know what prayer is you say Amen so brother Brenham continues Jesus was led by the spirit to where he was talking about this person and Jesus was led by the Holy Spirit right now where he was and healed him well we know that there was an angel comes down there's thousands of people but only one person that was him killed now this is what brother Brenham say when the rest of them were thinking about their diseases and things again what are we thinking sick I have this problem that problem this B is killing me I have no money when they were thinking those things nobody loves me God doesn't hear me they were thinking those things said and he went away from them never said a word how was he healed if not by the shadow of Jesus Christ not only the shadow but here he is yes another lady just trying to reach for the Garment something was going to happen brother Brenham continues I can see a bunch of people that were cowardly 120 all that little old cowed people and there they were I would say here there's maybe less than 80 today there was 120 of them they didn't agree first day they didn't agree second day they disagreed the third day they looked at each other the fourth day they were thinking I think God called me for the ministry no God called me because I got a vision called because I dream a lot God called me because I'm a good person brother Brenham said that's fully everybody wants a calling God has to vindicate what you are vate your calling not just because I have a dream just because I talk in tongues not because I help the pastor God has to vindicate so he goes on they were up in little old step one time but God said Don't You Preach anymore sorry what did I say I I'm an old Geer what did I say don't you preach anymore don't you sing anymore don't you testify anymore until until you have been filled the Holy Ghost then he he Jesus Christ is going to lead you to all the nations preach the gospel once were filled with his anointing you can go but you won't be Vindicated who sent you that's why we have teams here that team represents each and every one of you the life they live what they say do I allow you to just say anything from do I allow you to say anything even if it's right we have been taught we live by a standard and conventions places we go to we speak no Doctrine what we speak is winning souls for the kingdom of God that's the whole plan that our Apostle brought us go out and preach the gospel say go out and teach the gospel preach the gospel with what what are you going to preach with and these signs shall that believe so I tell you thank God for the teams that we have what I want you to do I want you to give them a clap off they give up their time they have to put up with me let me tell you I guess when I leave my wife is gone the old grouchy man is gone no my wife doesn't say that she may think it but she won't say it so I I give my wife a little bit of rest when I go out well I have to bring her a present uh sister did he get you a present I willon tell you he spent sister to bring you a present yes okay you always take a present home this way she'll smile a little more so for me to you I love the Lord Jesus Christ we do everything for him those individuals that have gone stand up if you've been on the mission field with you've been in the mission field with that have been on the trips please stand I got to put that Eagle Eye on you know I see and then I can find out who didn't show up the church where's evaristo oh he's out there all right thank you Joe you're standing up it's good to know who your ref representatives are they represent you now what do they teach are you teaching the six seal or the seven what we teach ye must be born again ye must be born there's nothing wrong thank you there's nothing wrong knowing the seals it's not what the people need what we need is that there's power in the blood and that same power can raise us up that same power can heal us that's what they want to hear I'm GNA close with that but I just want you to hear this why I believe your chosen vessels and I I need for the teams to live by this standard God's chosen vessels where are you if you're chosen vessel stand stand up if you're a chosen vessel you know God chose you chosen vessels are called to break to break new ground again God chose you us to break new ground in other words go somewhere where no one has been there before no electricity no water no internet no phone ServiceOne service I'm sorry you had air conditioned in that good room you had right I'm sorry uh you had light right I I know you had huh it went out I'm sorry you paid for three cups of coffee how much three cups of coffee you got $25 to waste some coffee I'm sorry did you pay for the breakfast or did he pay for the breakfast uh I'm sorry how much did you pay for two eggs sausage bacon $50 for how many chosen vessels are you ready for the challenge breaking new ground so how was your experience Manny um did I wake you up early I can't sleep if I don't sleep by Godly George nobody's gonna sleep right Danny I have to get up I got to have a little bit of wakeup call a wake up call is a cup of coffee then I wake everybody up where you at I'm waiting for so and so then come down and we'll wait together they're good great I'm trying to figure out who snored the loudest sisters don't say it you know that's why I sleep alone so I second thing that you should know God's chosen vessels are appointed for a chosen task for a certain job he called you to do a certain Danny what did he call you for god I didn't even understand that one are you talking French to me oh okay thank you you know he called somebody to just take care of me I've always said it from this pul if somebody was to shoot at me that person right there would take a bullet from me are they going to shoot at us brother Ferguson from Canada Fergus Canada he gave a testimony brother went into a Muslim country preaching this gospel they put him in jail the following three days later he was dead they shot him they kill it's not the same civil rights that we have here Vietnam Vietnam they're Communists one person was deported I won mention names uh because I didn't want to preach that many messages the third one point on I'll finish with this are you ready brother Brenham had a quote somebody might remember if I want to rain what do I have to do and this is what nobody wants to do what's going to happen do you know no thank you God's chosen vessels must must suffer for his name sake we're going to suffer if we like it or not suffering will allow us to rain I'll give that to you as somebody said as homework what I want to finish with I had a call this morning a rooster call gu so it's brother Mundi he calls me from the Congo and I'm like in the background I he all these roosters must have been about four or five I could hear them clearly and he had a soft voice he told me what you said greet the Saints on my behalf brother jacqu said the same thing he text me this morning they love you we go back next year I plan to take a larger group the reason is I want the five churches if I have to rent the building to be Under One Roof to hear the same message ministerial meetings because there's so many problems in the churches today and I say it because there's many many problems simple problems and we like we did in guara solved and took away many spirits issues that they had so I I want you to remember those three things remember that you create the atmosphere and it's up to you so I'm heard of the phone call and something said take this so I started thinking wow Lord I'm tired I haven't stopped since March and it's I heard it again take it so what do I do who do I listen to as he said the two thoughts remember how I started God's there Satan has to be there so I tell you today if you are lacking something in your life I haven't forgotten I haven't forgotten I wait on God I can't do it on my own because if I do it on my own I will fail but if I do it with God and it's God on the scene you don't have to worry so I'm going to do this I want all my Troopers to come up here TR is the elder here you go and what I want you to do I thought I had more Troopers in this it has to be a re that you have been called that you're part of my [Music] truth once you're part of my truth then what we're going to do is you're just going to touch the Garment touch the Garment then I want you to reach out there's a black hole somewhere no there is a black hole there is a door Einstein called it a black all it was was space but we know them as holes a window a door into another place and what you got to do all you have to do is hold it enter in the holy of holy receive what's in your heart and when you touch it you're touching not the Elder but you're touching the Garment of Jesus Christ remember this is one of the last things that brother Brenham prayed for there are no more I mean I had some big ones small green ones I can't find anything anymore they wanted this in Africa they wanted me to cut it you know how I felt here's Jesus's garment and they started to cut it's whole it's never been cut so come and touch his garments and when you put your your arm you're reaching into eternity every sickness every worry will go away just like Carlos said he couldn't hear but what he did he entered into a another dimension by faith he was able to touch it by faith we are going to make it family you're my family I got to care about you care about you there's something wrong with me there's something wrong with my experience and I put it all to tell you we are a family loving each other like family and that's all we are as a so whatever you want you're going to come through reach into eternity hold it put it into your heart and I will guarantee you God is God today wanting to be identified W you to grab his blood and apply it so come on down hold it leave your burdens in Jesus's [Music] hands I got to cry out today that whatever I have in my heart he will give it to me because I've been chosen I'm a chosen vessel not chosen by man we were never chosen by man we were chosen by a thought by the word of God this morning the word of God [Music] made [Music] you okay all right [Music] all of us are [Music] again all is [Music] well [Music] look of us [Music] here [Music] sh all is [Music] well all is [Music] well all is well
