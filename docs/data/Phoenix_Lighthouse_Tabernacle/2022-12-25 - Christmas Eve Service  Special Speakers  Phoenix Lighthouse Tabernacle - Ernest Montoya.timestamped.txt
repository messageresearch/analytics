[39:42] not made with hands
[39:45] say none of this building
[39:58] neither by the blood of goats
[40:01] but by his own blood he entered in once
[40:05] into the holy Place having obtained
[40:08] internal Redemption is
[40:21] or if the blood of impulse and of goats
[40:23] and the ashes of the heifer are
[40:25] sprinkling the unclean
[40:27] sanctifieth to the purifying of the
[40:29] flesh
[40:30] is
[40:40] how much more shall the blood of Christ
[40:42] who through eternal spirit offers
[40:45] himself without spot to God
[40:48] foreign
[41:06] sientos
[41:09] um
[41:12] Brothers wanted us to speak on the topic
[41:14] of redemption
[41:19] and I asked myself
[41:22] what more could I add to this topic
[41:27] the Brothers performing I've covered
[41:29] this topic very well
[41:35] speaking honestly I don't think I can
[41:38] foreign
[41:42] but it wasn't until recently
[41:46] that's what reminded me
[41:48] that in order to learn something
[41:53] once is not enough uh
[41:57] do you understand something deeply
[42:00] it has to be gone over and over
[42:05] until it becomes a part of us
[42:11] um
[42:12] and also we're going over this topic
[42:15] because we know that there are people
[42:17] here but do not listen
[42:20] um
[42:23] and I will confess I am one of those
[42:26] people you're welcome
[42:29] um
[42:30] but the main reason the important reason
[42:33] important
[42:35] while we're constantly speaking about
[42:37] this topic
[42:40] it's because we're living in the last
[42:42] age
[42:47] which is perhaps the most dangerous age
[42:49] of them all
[42:53] the brothers before me
[42:55] gone over numerous times Redemption
[43:01] is withstanding the test
[43:06] but what tests
[43:09] the test against ourselves
[43:14] now the Devil is a great adversary
[43:21] but he is not our worst enemy
[43:27] our worst enemy is ourselves
[43:33] the devil has no real power over us
[43:37] he can't force us to do what he wants
[43:41] the only thing he can do
[43:44] put dark thoughts into our heads
[43:50] it is us who accept and act on those
[43:53] thoughts
[43:58] so don't think for a second that we're
[44:00] innocent in this
[44:02] our hands are just as filthy
[44:05] you know
[44:08] going back to what I said about the
[44:10] devil's power problem
[44:13] all right
[44:14] he doesn't have any real power
[44:19] he cannot touch
[44:23] so much is breathe on us
[44:26] without permission
[44:30] and whose permission you might ask
[44:33] God's permission
[44:36] and I've heard people ask
[44:40] if he needs God's permission
[44:44] why does God grant it
[44:50] the reason why God grants him permission
[44:54] so that we can grow stronger from it
[45:00] because Redemption is more than just
[45:03] withstanding the test
[45:06] it is recognizing every trick
[45:09] the devil has
[45:13] not falling prey to it
[45:18] because when we make a mistake
[45:20] and we feel bad about it truly feel bad
[45:22] about it
[45:25] we won't make that same mistake
[45:30] because if there's any universal truth
[45:32] out there
[45:35] is that suffering
[45:37] the fire that forges One Soul into steel
[45:40] is
[45:48] um and going back to what I said about
[45:51] this being the most dangerous age
[45:55] [Music]
[45:58] the reason why it's the most dangerous
[46:02] it's because of the level of confusion
[46:04] that exists in the outside world
[46:10] people don't remember who they are I
[46:13] think they don't like wear that
[46:13] guinnesson why they're there
[46:16] or how to proceed with what they have
[46:22] and the level of this confusion is
[46:26] enormous it's enormous
[46:28] frankly it's frightening
[46:29] [Music]
[46:34] um
[46:38] there was an actor and a comedian
[46:45] I'm not sure if most of you know him as
[46:48] the
[46:49] Robin Williams
[46:51] Robin Williams
[46:54] if you don't know him it's the
[46:58] you voiced many Character cartoon
[47:00] characters of Disneyland
[47:05] and he was very much loved
[47:10] um
[47:10] and he he made a lot of money
[47:14] he's very famous
[47:17] he had it all in accordance to the
[47:21] American dream
[47:25] but despite having all that
[47:28] he was still not happy
[47:31] and a couple of years ago he took his
[47:34] own life
[47:37] and he was perfectly healthy
[47:39] he had no mental issues
[47:44] no diseases and
[47:49] um
[47:50] he wasn't on any antidepressants
[47:53] depression
[47:57] in fact when you look back on the
[47:59] recordings he looked perfectly normal
[48:01] foreign
[48:16] that's how scary this confusion is
[48:20] because we don't we're living in an age
[48:23] where we don't even know
[48:26] um if the people are real um
[48:31] we know they are just simply putting on
[48:33] faces
[48:38] wanted to hide the real ones
[48:41] [Music]
[48:43] and they keep to themselves
[48:47] they start hearing voices in their heads
[48:52] questioning
[48:53] they're posted
[48:58] and one thing I learned from another
[49:00] brother um
[49:03] when you start hearing voices in your
[49:06] head
[49:09] one point in time
[49:12] you forget which one's yours
[49:17] and
[49:18] now I'm gonna end here because
[49:21] that's I'm gonna end here because I'm
[49:24] about to
[49:25] over go over my limit
[49:29] um
[49:30] God bless you all and
[49:32] hope you have a Merry Christmas
[49:36] [Applause]
[49:44] God bless you
[49:47] it's a pleasure to be here with you
[49:51] thinking it's Christmas
[49:55] maybe I'll give my brother the gift to
[49:57] speak in Spanish
[50:00] I'll continue with it
[50:04] just to wish everyone a Merry Christmas
[50:07] happy to be here with you
[50:11] continue on the Plan of Redemption
[50:15] Express
[50:17] what's in our minds
[50:20] where it's helped us
[50:23] but it'll help you
[50:25] we're in a time
[50:28] where it's a Christmas time where it's a
[50:32] time to be grateful
[50:34] right we give gifts
[50:36] you know we show people that how we love
[50:39] them
[50:41] and it's it's a time where we get
[50:45] together we appreciate she ate each
[50:47] other

[51:46] foreign
[52:46] and we have an opportunity to be well
[52:49] with the Lord
[52:51] going forward you know maybe that's
[52:54] something that we that I reflect on

[53:21] a lot that we can take in
[53:25] and be thankful moving forward
[53:28] and now is the time to be able to apply
[53:32] it foreign

[54:12] together and let's move forward together
[54:16] as a church praying for one another
[54:20] and that's just something that was in my
[54:22] heart
[54:23] you know that's something that I'm
[54:25] looking
[54:26] to be better and that's something that
[54:30] we can take together into the new year
[54:32] we don't have to wait till then right
[54:35] it's right now yes it's when we can take
[54:39] it going forward
[54:41] we have an opportunity
[54:43] you know when we say well one
[54:45] opportunity right
[54:46] yeah you know to accept the Lord into
[54:48] our lives
[54:49] if you haven't done that right and if
[54:52] you feel that in you
[54:54] you have that opportunity you have that
[54:57] opportunity to allow the Lord into your
[54:59] life
[55:01] you know we see the things that happen
[55:03] on daily
[55:06] you know with with loved ones maybe
[55:10] we've had testimony our brother Alfredo
[55:14] Garcia gave testimonies
[55:16] with our sister Garcia you know I I have
[55:20] loved ones
[55:21] where the Lord is working
[55:27] with my father you know I see the Lord
[55:30] working
[55:31] and I and I see that and I just want to
[55:35] accept that into my life
[55:36] I want to be a part of that I want to be
[55:40] a part of that moving forward
[55:42] you know we see these kinds of things
[55:45] and so we can take it with our with this
[55:49] mentality to be better and to accept him
[55:53] right yes how do we accept them right
[55:56] you know he's surrendering to him right
[55:59] you know we just in in the conventions
[56:02] in November
[56:03] right it was how can I overcome right
[56:07] and one of the one of the things that
[56:08] our brother mukundi
[56:11] I hope I'm pronouncing that correct he
[56:14] talked about humility
[56:16] you're just in humility it's how we can
[56:20] overcome
[56:21] being simple and being
[56:24] um
[56:25] that's how we can accept it
[56:28] surrendering to him and I just want to
[56:31] go to the scripture very quickly we
[56:33] don't have to turn to it
[56:37] and it's it says therefore
[56:41] said he unto them a harvest truly is
[56:45] great but the laborers are few
[56:47] pray ye therefore the lord of the
[56:50] Harvest that he would send forth
[56:52] laborers into his Harvest is
[57:03] the laborers are few
[57:05] that's something that uh
[57:33] this is coming from a message from
[57:35] Brother Bernie
[57:37] and I recommend for you to read it
[57:39] so we we've talked about how it's it's
[57:42] an opportunity
[57:44] to move forward
[57:48] and be able to accept the Lord and move
[57:51] forward with the Lord
[57:53] you know to take in this gospel right in
[57:57] the gospel is the good news
[58:01] what good news
[58:03] well the good news that they that they
[58:06] had talked about
[58:08] the ones that they had spoken about
[58:11] had arrived those were the good news
[58:14] that the one that they had talked about
[58:17] in the Old Testament
[58:19] he had arrived and that was the good
[58:22] news
[58:23] that's the gospel
[58:25] one that had they had spoken about
[58:28] he had arrived
[58:31] and so
[58:32] when it comes to speaking on the planet
[58:34] of redemption
[58:36] and then to be able to accept him you
[58:39] know we said well we might think in
[58:43] accepting him you may think oh well I've
[58:45] already accepted him
[58:47] that's great and this next thing you
[58:52] know the scripture that we read in Luke
[58:54] 10 2. and look at yes those but the
[58:57] laborers are few loss you know brother
[59:00] Bernie focused it a lot focuses a lot on
[59:02] this
[59:04] and in the part two of the message
[59:06] he talks a lot about laborers
[59:11] a lot he says the word laborers a lot
[59:14] continues on about it
[59:16] laborers what is the labor you know
[59:20] there's two types you know the physical
[59:22] you know physical and mental workers
[59:25] where someone's praying you know someone
[59:28] or someone that's always here
[59:30] my brother here very early on Sunday
[59:33] morning
[59:34] it comes and he cleans yeah Olympia it
[59:37] cleans the outside you know it's the
[59:39] church looks really nice
[59:42] but it doesn't always look that way but
[59:44] there's there's laborers you know one of
[59:47] the our biggest laborers he's not here
[59:50] right now he's in maybe a big snowstorm
[59:54] a big storm yeah
[59:58] one of the biggest laborers
[1:00:02] of course our pastors
[1:00:05] someone that takes his word into action
[1:00:08] so this word laborers brother Bernie
[1:00:12] focuses a lot on that
[1:00:14] and that's just that's what I wanted to
[1:00:16] come across just that laborers
[1:00:19] because it's it's a one thing to come
[1:00:22] right it's like what's happening you
[1:00:23] know brother Bernie gives an example you
[1:00:26] know we could come you know we can do
[1:00:28] but but if there's a church with 400
[1:00:31] members
[1:00:32] we should have 400 laborers
[1:00:36] and whatever it is right
[1:00:40] in praying for one another
[1:00:42] you may you may you may think and I'll
[1:00:46] just use this as an example
[1:00:48] I saw brother Javier oh he he he wasn't
[1:00:53] doing well
[1:00:54] and then he didn't talk to me
[1:00:57] and I say I use your brother Javier
[1:01:00] because the tremendous amount of respect
[1:01:02] that I have for him that we should all
[1:01:05] have for him because that is a laborer
[1:01:08] and so if he's not doing too well
[1:01:15] or I could have gone maybe to the barber
[1:01:18] shop
[1:01:18] and spoken with him a little bit or the
[1:01:22] same thing brother Bernie says let's say
[1:01:24] our cleaning group right you know I saw
[1:01:27] a program there it was on the floor the
[1:01:31] cleaning crew will get it
[1:01:34] right no you do it and that's just a
[1:01:38] small example right and moving forward
[1:01:42] moving into the year
[1:01:44] Lord give me the desire to be a laborer
[1:01:48] whatever it is getting here early
[1:01:52] helping clean it doesn't matter
[1:02:21] that's the thought that I had this this
[1:02:23] evening
[1:02:24] I keep saying morning
[1:02:28] when people were walking in I was
[1:02:31] telling them good morning
[1:02:32] I'm so used to it right we're in the
[1:02:36] glory right now with one service a week
[1:02:39] with quick service right we're in truly
[1:02:43] in the glory
[1:02:44] and then so it's it's and it's in times
[1:02:48] like this when it's easier to not be a
[1:02:51] laborer
[1:02:53] let's let's pray together
[1:02:56] be laborers in the littlest thing let's
[1:03:00] be laborers
[1:03:02] just praying for my brother
[1:03:04] praying for my pastor those are laborers
[1:03:08] you know of course visiting families
[1:03:12] helping people those are all traits of a
[1:03:15] laborer
[1:03:16] let's pray for the desire
[1:03:19] to be laborers together and as I close
[1:03:23] no I I pass it on someone that is
[1:03:28] Merry Christmas and God bless
[1:03:31] [Applause]
[1:03:37] India
[1:03:40] it's kind of tough having to follow that
[1:03:42] is
[1:03:43] but I think my brother because I can
[1:03:45] tell that he's really appreciative of
[1:03:46] the people we have here
[1:03:50] and so what my topic is more so it's me
[1:03:53] Tema it's it's I want to focus on on
[1:03:55] Christmas since we're approaching it
[1:03:57] already in it
[1:03:59] yeah just what is the gift that we're
[1:04:02] receiving
[1:04:04] you know we mentioned it many times
[1:04:06] around these holidays
[1:04:08] that this is not the time where our Lord
[1:04:11] Jesus Christ was born
[1:04:14] why not take this opportunity to
[1:04:16] celebrate it
[1:04:17] as we should celebrate it every day
[1:04:21] and here I have a couple quotes as
[1:04:24] different messages I was listening
[1:04:28] what I want to focus on is the gift that
[1:04:31] God sent to our people
[1:04:35] you have a quote form from the message
[1:04:37] God's wrapped gift
[1:04:44] he says just a little while from then
[1:04:47] and the world was going to receive its
[1:04:48] greatest gift that they ever received
[1:04:54] it's just a little package wrapped up
[1:04:59] just a little a little first little
[1:05:01] Christmas package that was ever wrapped
[1:05:03] in all of the world God wrapped it up
[1:05:08] he says I want to break it in on my
[1:05:11] thought and say this
[1:05:14] this is the greatest thing that was ever
[1:05:16] wrapped in human flesh was wrapped in it
[1:05:23] he says God himself wrapped his own self
[1:05:27] in a Christmas package and sent it to
[1:05:29] the world
[1:05:32] and is that not the greatest gift we've
[1:05:34] all ever received
[1:05:36] but what's more important is how he came
[1:05:39] to the world
[1:05:40] you know he goes on to say later on in
[1:05:43] the message
[1:05:44] he says it wasn't wrapped in fine Linens
[1:05:47] it was wrapped in swaddling cloth
[1:05:51] which is I'm taught that that very thing
[1:05:54] was wrapped in the Christ with the stuff
[1:05:56] of the back of the Yoke of an ox
[1:06:05] says he was wrapped in the swelling
[1:06:07] cloth the that's the it's the rag that
[1:06:09] they put around the ox yolk to keep it
[1:06:11] from rubbing blisters on it when he's
[1:06:12] pulling something
[1:06:21] he says they had no clothes for him
[1:06:25] and brother Branham says when I think of
[1:06:29] that
[1:06:30] says it nearly breaks my heart
[1:06:33] he says no clothes for Emmanuel the
[1:06:36] creator of heavens and earth
[1:06:40] for him to put on
[1:06:45] he had to be wrapped in the rag that an
[1:06:47] ox had worked his neck through
[1:06:53] and brother Brandon says he says oh what
[1:06:56] a super sign okay
[1:06:59] this great happening that that came
[1:07:02] about yesterday
[1:07:05] how we received the greatest gift that
[1:07:07] we could have ever received
[1:07:10] how he was born in Bethlehem he says
[1:07:14] that in Hebrew the word Bethlehem means
[1:07:18] the house of God's bread
[1:07:20] he says that God being the bread of life
[1:07:24] he could come no place but to the house
[1:07:27] of God's bread
[1:07:31] and he goes on to say in the message um
[1:07:34] why it had to be a shepherd
[1:07:37] He says the most unlikely place for such
[1:07:40] an event
[1:07:44] he says the Shepherds now was the one
[1:07:46] who received the message
[1:07:49] he says and now notice where the message
[1:07:52] was
[1:07:54] it was in the most unlikely place that
[1:07:57] anyone would expect it to come
[1:08:02] and so it was it came in an unexpected
[1:08:05] way
[1:08:06] maybe the people wanted to receive this
[1:08:08] gift in a spectacular way
[1:08:13] that's not what God wanted
[1:08:16] he came to the humble people
[1:08:18] and I like how he places it here I like
[1:08:21] the word choice
[1:08:23] he says it bypassed all the Nobles of
[1:08:26] the land
[1:08:31] he says it bypassed all the Nobles and
[1:08:34] was revealed to the nobodies
[1:08:40] so maybe many of us here professors were
[1:08:44] nobodies
[1:08:45] but that's what he came for
[1:08:48] and he says all the nobles were
[1:08:50] decorated with great doctors Divinity in
[1:08:52] Psychology and highly educations
[1:08:59] he says in great Cathedrals and things
[1:09:02] it was all bypassed and revealed to the
[1:09:04] nobodies
[1:09:10] and that's who we came to that's all we
[1:09:13] know that maybe at the time there was
[1:09:14] people who were maybe more qualified to
[1:09:16] receive him
[1:09:19] but he came to the Shepherds
[1:09:22] in 47 he says what inspiration to those
[1:09:27] herdsmen
[1:09:29] he says the Angels coming down to speak
[1:09:32] to herdsmen
[1:09:35] just angels of God coming to speak to a
[1:09:38] bunch of Shepherds
[1:09:42] and brother goes on and he describes
[1:09:45] Shepherds
[1:09:48] he says you know Shepherds don't talk
[1:09:51] right pastors
[1:09:53] they don't know how to do mathematics
[1:09:56] he says they don't they don't know much
[1:09:58] all they know about is sheep
[1:10:00] and he jokes around
[1:10:03] and he says if you ever had the the
[1:10:05] privilege to talk to a shepherd
[1:10:10] He says they hang around sheep so much
[1:10:13] they begin to start laughing like sheeps
[1:10:17] and they start talking like sheep and
[1:10:21] they smell like sheep
[1:10:22] and it goes on 53. and he says in a
[1:10:26] Manger
[1:10:28] he says see how at ease these herdsmen
[1:10:31] was in The
[1:10:34] Stables he says what do you think a
[1:10:37] theologian would have been in there
[1:10:41] he said he put a pin over his nose and
[1:10:44] said get me out of this place
[1:10:50] see he would have been so out of place
[1:10:52] he'd be in misery
[1:10:57] again he came to the Shepherds he came
[1:10:59] to to the Lowe's
[1:11:00] because the highs would not want him
[1:11:04] and what a blessing it is to us
[1:11:07] he came and he gave the gift to us
[1:11:12] maybe low lives
[1:11:15] but out of nothing he came and made
[1:11:17] something
[1:11:18] in something what a blessing and he goes
[1:11:22] on uh 94. he says see the first time
[1:11:25] Angels ever sing at a celebration was in
[1:11:28] heaven
[1:11:31] he said but the first time they ever
[1:11:33] sang on Earth
[1:11:37] was the Shepherds at the birth of God
[1:11:39] Emmanuel on Earth foreign
[1:12:27] how fitting it is to a Shepherd to
[1:12:30] receive a message of a newborn sheep
[1:12:35] foreign
[1:13:36] in the prayer he goes on to say here
[1:13:38] that I I really liked
[1:13:41] this is brother Brandon I'm praying to
[1:13:43] close off his his preaching
[1:13:47] this is 242. and he says I offer myself
[1:13:51] to God tonight with all my heart with
[1:13:54] all that's in me
[1:13:58] Corazon me
[1:14:01] he says I don't have very much to give
[1:14:04] I can't bring frankincense myrrh and
[1:14:07] gold because I have none
[1:14:11] but all I have in myself that God gave
[1:14:13] me this life I dedicate to him afresh
[1:14:16] tonight
[1:14:26] and how much how many of us can relate
[1:14:28] to that
[1:14:29] maybe we don't have anything physical to
[1:14:32] offer him
[1:14:33] no frankincense no myrrh no gold
[1:14:36] but we have this life that he provided
[1:14:38] for us
[1:14:40] that we can dedicate him for him tonight
[1:14:43] he says but all I have in myself God
[1:14:46] give me this life I dedicate to him a
[1:14:48] fresh night upon the manger of his word
[1:14:50] in my heart
[1:14:54] he says and promise him to stand with
[1:14:57] that word if he'll let me live another
[1:14:59] year
[1:15:01] as brother Paul said you know as the
[1:15:03] year ends people will start thinking
[1:15:05] about what they're going to do the next
[1:15:06] year
[1:15:09] and here we have brother Brandon saying
[1:15:12] if you give me another year
[1:15:15] this is what I want to do with my life
[1:15:19] he says it's just as faithful as I can
[1:15:22] stand
[1:15:23] preach every bit of it
[1:15:26] and believe every bit of it you could
[1:15:28] have
[1:15:30] so help me God and then he asked a
[1:15:33] question yes and I ask it to you as well
[1:15:37] you do the same with me
[1:15:39] and he goes on when he's finishing up
[1:15:42] his prayer
[1:15:45] he says what can we do dear God
[1:15:48] and I ask the question to you what can
[1:15:51] we do
[1:15:52] or what can I do okay he says help me
[1:15:56] and these other Shepherds Lord
[1:16:00] around the world Shepherds of the word
[1:16:02] to Proclaim it Lord in this next year
[1:16:09] he says help us Lord we pray
[1:16:12] he says give us thy love
[1:16:15] thy Spirit
[1:16:18] he says we dedicate ourselves tonight to
[1:16:21] Thy word into thy cause
[1:16:25] in Jesus Christ's name we receive your
[1:16:28] Christmas gifts
[1:16:31] the word of God made flesh in US
[1:16:35] amen and so is that not what we would
[1:16:38] like to do tonight
[1:16:40] but we celebrate tonight
[1:16:42] is God sending his only begotten son
[1:16:45] to save us and this ties in with
[1:16:48] Redemption
[1:16:50] and everything we speak on if anything
[1:16:54] this is the beginning this is what sets
[1:16:55] it about it is
[1:16:59] because I was looking the voice of God
[1:17:02] Recordings
[1:17:05] every year they send out their their
[1:17:07] Christmas greetings
[1:17:09] and I was reading through the ones
[1:17:11] they've done in the past years
[1:17:15] in one of the years the scripture they
[1:17:17] used is John 3 16.
[1:17:20] and at first I wondered is that really
[1:17:22] something that applies to Christmas
[1:17:25] but when I read it and what the little
[1:17:28] message they give in the voice of God
[1:17:30] Recordings
[1:17:32] what about these beautiful words
[1:17:35] that God giving his only begotten son
[1:17:39] anybody who believes in him
[1:17:42] shall not perish but have everlasting
[1:17:45] life
[1:17:46] not the greatest gift
[1:17:48] so you'll be so kind of please stand up
[1:17:51] yeah
[1:17:53] pretty
[1:17:54] and we'll be praying to dismiss
[1:17:57] we shall kind of close your eyes and buy
[1:18:00] our heads
[1:18:03] dear heavenly father
[1:18:05] Lord we thank you because you've
[1:18:07] provided us a place to come and
[1:18:08] Gathering
[1:18:11] we thank you because you let us see
[1:18:13] another Christmas Eve
[1:18:16] like my brother said we could have been
[1:18:19] many other places
[1:18:21] I know it took effort to be here tonight
[1:18:26] so I ask that you provide my brothers
[1:18:28] with a special blessing
[1:18:32] Lord be with us tonight
[1:18:34] let us accept that gift you sent for us
[1:18:39] Lord it didn't come wrapped fancy you
[1:18:42] know we know um
[1:18:43] it came in something so humble
[1:18:46] so that we can accept it
[1:18:49] us not being Noble
[1:18:52] but being nobodies so I asked for that
[1:18:56] tonight you'll be with us
