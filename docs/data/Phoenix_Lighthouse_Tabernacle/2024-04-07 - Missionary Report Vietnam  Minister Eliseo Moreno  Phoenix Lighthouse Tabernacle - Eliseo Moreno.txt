everything you do sometimes we don't realize that you're there next to us you always have been but devil has has taken upon himself to deceive us but you as a good father you're always by our side thank you Lord I place myself in your hands put your people in your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen vietn this is where will be continuing with the report from Vietnam if you can please project it up there I was away from home in Vietnam for about 16 days it's a little difficult including the time that you spend at the airport the time you have to be there before until you arrive to the place it's about 26 to 28 hours so it's a little bit difficult so when there's the crying out of the people so now I understand a little bit more the men of God maybe you can tell them that God loves them that they're awaiting for you with that anticipation then the tiredness goes away then God takes control the situation but it is a bit difficult by the grace of God we're here brothers so let us go to the scripture Genesis 1:1 from 1-5 in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening in the morning were the first day may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you may take your seats God bless it's good to be back home and see each one of you once again you might ask yourself what is brother doing in Vietnam well let me tell you what the scripture says says in Romans 9:26 and it says it's not of him that willth nor of him that runneth but of God that showeth Mercy so for me it's always been a privilege to trouble with my pastor I want you to know that's one of the most difficult trips that I've had to take if it were up to me but it's not up to me I wouldn't go back but the brothers that takes everything away when you begin to get to know newer Brothers as the scripture says where were you when I created and the sons of God rejoiced so then you feel an identification with them that that that removes everything else because you want to have fellowship with your brothers now brother this is the city we went to this is hoim Min City because I don't know what to expect well Vietnam there's jungle there's war and other things going on but that's how the city looks it's a very modernized City I want you to see how what it looks like I took this photo this how it looks at night it's so difficult even to just cross the street because there's so many motorcycles and the motorcycles get on top of the of the pavement on the sidewalk go on the sidewalk where somebody is walking if you're and if you're not careful if you're not careful with your step then they take you with them and they almost took me a couple times but my pastor he told me get ready learn how to walk even to cross the street it's a bit difficult this is the city there's Alleyways if I could put like in in the movies when you see that there's bad people in the alleys that's how it is here it's a very difficult country the people are not very smiling or happy automatically when they see the aspects or your features they know that you're not from there and they almost want to start up something with you they're very maybe confrontational the people from Vietnam so sometimes you feel a little bit intimidated but one knows that you're going with God and besides I know that I'm with my pastor I know who he is so with him I gain confidence well if they want to square up that's why you have to look at it in every way you have to look at every aspect the devil is at every corner he's like a roaring line looking for home to devour and soon or later he's waiting for you to not focus look brother because we got there we rested for just about a day and they picked us up at 4 in the morning and then we drove four hours to get to one place son this is Brother son Gwen and brother Tron Tron Tron Tron TR on Tron on and I'm showing you this because this what we ate the majority of the time and even when I was a child did I eat so many vegetables but there I had to get used to it and it's a bit difficult and I'll say this for the brothers of Vietnam in order to honor them I know the brother won't understand me but I'll tell you it's hello my name is Eli and God bless you and we begin to have the love for the people so you begin to appreciate them what they have now this is here the first church that we visited it's about four hours from the place on the way there outout there they've changed completely the vegetation because they removed the jungle so the brothers that congregate here uh they're uh Farm Workers they work on what they call gum trees or rubber trees that's what they dedicate themselves to here's our pastor preaching with The Interpreter brother son Gwen here's where he first called the pastors and the ministers here there's a tradition because everything is different you going into a house a church or wherever you may be and you have to remove your shoes so you either go barefoot or wear socks on so at first you feel a bit uncomfortable but you see how they do it to respect their laws and their Traditions that they have here we're praying for the people and here's the congregation there was a lot of Deliverance here I felt the presence of God from the first prayer you could feel that they were in need of God so the most that you need from God he is willing to give you whatever you want but when you pray with that anxiousness then automatically he comes down but he's waiting for you to open up your heart and the people were happy here they spoke Vietnamese in another mixed language but God knows all of the languages and here where we were where our pastor and from here went where the other brother is at the brother with the white shirt I forget the name of the brother he's the brother that's in charge he has a small church now the brothers have nothing but with all their heart and all their savings and everything they do they try to make the best Church they can for the Lord and here's a place it's a bit difficult I look at it almost like a ranch back in Mexico that they have their animals and other stuff but they have they don't have any money like they said in the morning they win they earn about 97 cents an hour and there you're not allowed to worship the majority of the churches are oh they're because the government doesn't the government doesn't allow them the brother that's in the white shirt that's brother's son what he told me it still shocks me to this day it breaks me down he says I want to know how the brothers are that can worship freely and that hit me pretty hard because we don't know what we have here they would like to be where you're at I know I've told you many times but to this day his words are are echoing in my heart you can express however you want and they're so limited and with the little crumbs that they have it's like gold for them and they appreciate it a lot that's a path outside it's very far and when I took this picture automatically this scripture came to mind it says and the Lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and hedges and comp compel them to come into my house that may be filled that's why almost nobody goes over there because so difficult you have to be careful with the government be careful of other things if they catch you speaking ill of the government in the city there's cameras there's microphones there's everything they could um throw you in jail for treason it's that difficult brother but even so the seed of God there is God's seat there they're just crying out and giving things that there could just people that people that could still go there it's on a in such a hostile place and difficult place this is the brother in charge this is the son and I told him let me take a photo with you sometimes people say brother you're my hero because you this that or the other but what they do with sense that they have they give all their heart they give their lives to have what you have and even so they're surviving that's why I asked them give me the honor to take this photo with you the son I wanted to give him everything but only God knows and from there we going to go eat once again more vegetables thank God for the vegetables they're very good for you I don't know how many pounds I lost I didn't see any fat person in Vietnam so it let you know that vegetables are good for you they felt like they just yanked them off the Garden or from the grass and I didn't even ask just herbs here and herbs there and then the next day I took this picture of my pastor this was the first message Church in Vietnam that's what it looks like and they worship with all the heart that which they understand you might think that there's not many messages in Spanish now imagine how many messages there must be in Vietnamese and with what they have they appreciate it so this the first time I had never fallen my lot to speak in English or preach English but I felt very comfortable I felt good later my our pastor took it over the children sing a special I wanted you to see what the children look like but even there is the new generation coming of Believers there's something about the children maybe I remember from when I was child and that touches my heart each time I see a child but this is afterwards with a tea that they have it's a bit bitter a bit strange well but brother what ises it taste like what it's delicious I don't know what they make it with but they drink it in such a nice way but the blood here that's their missionary those these two brothers with the ties brother they go to places where there's Buddhist that if you don't believe like they do or you disrespect them or get in their way they're so violent they almost have the right to kill you and that's where these men go so sharing with a brother Tron on of what is it that they have done with the they have with cents with a dollar in their pocket but with the burning in their heart that's so when I see this this is difficult if it were to me I would want to go back but just because of them even if they don't understand me even understand some of the words when interpret that covers everything we even end up owing this sister this is her home look I believe it it been about 10 years about 11 years since they seen each other got she was so happy she opened up her bag and she took out a rag he said and you prayed for this cloth 10 years ago and I still have it she treasured it so my question all the cloth that our pastor's giving out do they still have them the ones that they prayed for do they still remember these people don't forget anything because they appreciate everything they can get their hands on and they treasure it here's the congregation they're happy with what God has given them because the seed from there we went to another place here it's called dang it's a very tourist City it's a very beautiful city that's what it looks like it's close to the ocean China Sea I believe it's called the China Sea and it's very beautiful even so it's still very difficult like I tell it feels like they want to beat you up at every corner but you're not going to get intimidated well you might say well I'm Mexican and by the grace of God God took care of us but we also have to have our guard like says we have to be aware of who is behind us privilege to here to get to know this bridge he spoke a little bit this morning for me it was a privilege to be there going where he fought everything is still the same as it was before the same boats that cross they're still there you're showing me the other side was where they were stationed and for me it was truly a privilege where a war was fought and the war still continues but now it continues in our mind it's a war that Satan continues to fight against us and hear this after 50 years that's still standing there it's a bridge the soldiers had created and P said they were always constantly bombarding it or exploding it but it's still there before you get to the bridge there's a cafe and there's a man there who his grandpa was one who fought in the battle war and he has so much respect for our pastor that when you get there they want to give you the best they have because it's an honor to have him there and he does it out of the respect he has for the people who fought there and he gave us and he gifted us these little coffee things coffee pots so my our pastor gave him a coin and I gave it was in my heart to give him also a coin that I had out of respect this is the place we were I had the privilege to get to know this place is a it's a Runway where the planes would land everything's already changed this brother Peter brother Peter lives in the n and he's the representative of the voice of God this is his son he's the one who took us over there he has already began to grow that things started to grow there back then nothing would grow because of Agent Orange that was poured over there but the seed that was in the earth began to grow and the natural typifies the spiritual doesn't matter how much Satan tries to kill the children of God see would have to grow sooner or later here is in the room the hotel because you have to do it a high hidden and this is Pastor Han and his wife and so they go into the room to have Services there but there's always people watching it's always something tremendous to get to know other pastors you're are the people that came next to me there's a sister with a yellow shirt and one with a blue shirt they asked for prayer and from what I understood from [Music] her since she was born she had a very difficult pain in her body but she went with faith knowing that God could heal her prayer you could feel how she was asking God with all of her heart and there instantly God healed her can you imagine with the pain that she was born with that had never gone away and a couple days later we asked where the sister was that she had gone out and testified what God had done in her life here are our more ministers this is our sister Fang V she's a translator of the messages to Vietnamese she's a very fine simple sister she's with she's with the agapo tablet and then invit us to eat more herbs I think about a certain amount of time you begin to get the taste the good thing is that they have chili and the chili is a little spicy it's so and so that helps me then we went to the Church of the pastor this is his little church that they have in their house outside of the city of dening and here this young man wasn't one interpreting he speaks very good English because the brothers that translate they understand English but sometimes they struggle to speak it sometimes you difficult need to adjust your ear to be able to understand them but this young man he's new and he speaks very good English and he's new in the message and God placed them in that place and that's what he is helping with there was even to interpret is the one that's there and brother Peter on the side because there certain words because the language is completely different because it's so different they need help in that certain words that are compound words and because everything is so different they have to interpret or translate the concept of what is being said here's our pastor praying for the the people the ones that have been with him in the missionary field you know that he gives everything in the missionary field he gives 110% because he wants the people to receive what God has for them but you know why sometimes we don't receive it because sometimes they read to us a quote like our Pastor said we're know it all I don't know if he said it that way so I'm going look at when I'm at home to see brother BR really said it that way but when you hear when he saying that it was so they accept it and they treasure it in their hearts to see if we can play the video just so you can see how they worship I'll give a couple seconds see if they're able to play it but when they [Music] worship they they worshiping they're they're singing Holy Holy because Chua for them is God but they give it out and they told you it's a place it's very difficult but because of the souls are crying out that's the reason our pastor goes so it doesn't matter how difficult it is doesn't matter what kind of food it is they want to know what kind of person you are if with restrictions they give everything they have risk all of their lives just to have of the gospel and we have it freely we can speak freely and they say brother you say that because you went over there I just want you to know so I can share what the world is suffering that's why brother says people are dying just for an ounce of Love or what you have have brothers and when you're praying remember our brothers in Vietnam so that God May strengthen them and the gospel begins to be spread out that the sea that is there it may rise up please stand may they come up may they give fruits and if God allows he give visas to some of the brothers so they come testify you can see them physically so you can see what it is that God is truly doing over there and that's the reason we're in the missionary field not because one is better than the rest maybe in your mind if you ever think that maybe it's a vacation then begin to speak to our wives see if it really is a vacation you'll find out that it's truly sacrifice but everything is well worth it if it was just for one single person because one soul is worth more than 10,000 worlds so if just this trip everything that was invested all the time everything that was spent it was just for one person just for that person that was sick since they were born then it was well worth it so if it's the same God over there there it's the same God here you have any need on from God if you've been asking God for something for a long time and God has not given it to you God just wants to test your faith but God is the same God Jes Christ the same yesterday today and forever and everything he did for that young lady for you here tonight come with the correct attitude you come and say God here I am once again I'm ask I've asked you once and time but now Lord even if you don't give it to me because the devil is coming to my mind even if you don't give it to me I will still continue believing that has to be our attitude to grab on to what we believe in the word belongs to us we're the best but we just have to know who we are we're not just anybody they're Sons and Daughters of God purch by the blood of Lord Jesus Christ all the promises Belong To You Lord Jes Christ Holy Father we give you thanks Lord because we don't know what we have here we have the best Lord there's people that are dying Forgive Me Lord they're dying because they want to have what we have here and what they have they treasure it we have so much Lord that we waste so much time in things that are don't matter people around the world dying help us Lord let us wake up to know what we have in our hands we have the best we have all the message in English and Spanish help us father to fill ourselves more with your Holy Spirit oh Lord all those flames of fire go throughout the whole world crying out the gospel the gospel with power that you're still the same God you still transform people you still heal people you still take away you're the same here's your people asking of give them Father give them what they need it's for them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen came to praise the [Music] Lord I just came to
