[30:50] this morning
[30:54] this morning I'd like to continue
[30:56] speaking on an attitude
[31:00] honestly I try to bring another topic
[31:04] and sometimes it's not what you want one
[31:08] studies
[31:10] it brings you back to the same thing
[31:13] [Music]
[31:15] Lord help me I'm gonna continue with
[31:17] this topic of attitude and here we are
[31:22] going to repeat once again what the
[31:24] dictionary says the word attitude means
[31:29] it's the way of being with somebody or
[31:31] being able to behave with someone
[31:35] [Music]
[31:38] a temperament towards a person or a
[31:41] situation
[31:45] this morning we'll be looking at a
[31:47] different attitude whether it be good
[31:48] attitudes or bad attitudes
[31:50] I'll try to make it a little more
[31:52] personal
[31:56] last week we were not here
[32:00] we went with the children to go take
[32:02] them out
[32:04] I'm going to share with you what
[32:06] happened to me
[32:07] um
[32:10] we're in a line to get on top of it
[32:12] inside a train
[32:14] there was a small child next to us
[32:17] and he had a briefcase the suitcase
[32:49] so that we would be calm
[32:54] learning that from
[32:57] oh that was a lesson that's the lesson
[33:00] that God showed it
[33:02] going back to attitude
[33:07] and we're going to focus on attitudes
[33:09] that we see on the day-to-day
[33:11] um
[33:27] [Music]
[33:33] they're always there with a good
[33:35] attitude
[33:37] they're trained to have a good attitude
[33:42] um
[33:43] I was looking at the Senate they were
[33:45] hiring people
[33:47] and the first thing that caught my
[33:49] attention
[33:51] it's what it says
[33:54] what you got to do when you fill out
[33:56] your application
[34:03] before filling out the rest of documents
[34:05] he is
[34:08] and they're trained to have the correct
[34:10] attitude
[34:13] also catch my attention
[34:16] is the dealership that wants to sell
[34:18] cars
[34:19] [Music]
[34:20] they treat you like a king when you get
[34:22] there is that true have you ever been to
[34:25] a dealership
[34:28] they try not to get you not to leave
[34:30] without first driving the cars
[34:32] they come in
[34:38] [Music]
[34:44] they have a very nicely furnished office
[34:47] inside it is
[34:51] [Music]
[34:58] even though sometimes they throw in a
[35:00] little numbers that we don't see in the
[35:02] contract
[35:03] I hope that there's no one here who
[35:04] sells cars
[35:05] but we're trying to learn a lesson
[35:08] foreign
[35:19] [Music]
[35:27] they always have a very good attitude
[35:34] I want to go get a haircut with my
[35:36] brother
[35:37] it wasn't him it was other Barbers
[35:42] I was looking at the one who was cutting
[35:45] hair next
[35:46] the customer was very serious
[35:49] it was very no very small talk
[35:53] one word would come in another word
[35:59] in a minute they were laughing wow
[36:02] [Music]
[36:08] [Music]
[36:12] oh yeah they're very uh educated when it
[36:15] comes to sports the political politics
[36:17] is
[36:19] they have a very good attitude
[36:23] another attitude that I like um
[36:26] is the waiters or waitress
[36:29] waiters you get there
[36:33] well when you're not so hungry and we'll
[36:35] see
[36:36] [Music]
[36:38] they try to do their best they bring you
[36:40] the menu
[36:42] [Music]
[36:44] doesn't come and take your order
[36:49] maybe you start not to get such a good
[36:50] attitude you ask yourself you know where
[36:51] did this guy go yeah and when he comes
[36:54] like maybe he forgot about me
[36:57] but the majority they try to do their
[36:59] best
[37:01] because they have a lot of tables amen
[37:03] Brothers
[37:07] I'm trying to talk about the attitudes
[37:09] that we come across on the day to day
[37:12] um
[37:13] I'm gonna have one of my attitudes um
[37:16] CEO
[37:19] yeah I have an appointment with a
[37:21] clients

[37:35] yeah
[37:38] I'm almost arriving at the at the site
[37:40] so I can get the contract
[37:42] but two minutes before maybe I get a
[37:45] phone call

[37:49] happens
[38:00] since I'm already with the clients
[38:04] I have to show him a smile
[38:07] I can't let him know that they've
[38:09] started bothering me amen Brothers

[39:38] when we're hungry
[39:40] [Music]
[39:43] but we're hungry when we're very hungry
[39:58] but of all these attitudes that we have
[40:00] seen
[40:01] um
[40:04] sellers the waiters waitresses
[40:10] they have something behind them
[40:14] correct that makes them have a correct
[40:17] attitude
[40:19] they have a pay or they have a benefit
[40:22] that they will receive yes
[40:25] that's what makes them have a correct
[40:27] attitude
[40:30] I want to bring it closer to us get the
[40:36] get that we have to do to always have a
[40:38] correct Christian attitude
[40:39] that our pastor may tell us
[40:42] each time that you have a correct we're
[40:45] gonna pay you
[40:47] well then our eyes were changed amen

[41:41] [Music]
[42:02] [Music]
[42:07] and there was a police uh playing a game
[42:11] and he was getting bothered this is
[42:13] Senor he says Lord
[42:15] I have two daughters my daughters
[42:21] are you going to allow them to live in
[42:23] this filth
[42:25] because why don't you just destroy them
[42:29] how am I going to allow my daughters to
[42:31] live among this is
[42:38] [Music]
[42:42] he says look is this is you
[42:48] show them all the sins he has committed
[42:52] and they start flying
[42:55] but there's like a parachute
[42:58] that everything that he did
[43:01] reach the presence of God
[43:05] everything that he did it came back
[43:10] because there was almost a rainbow like
[43:12] blood
[43:13] and God to him
[43:16] he kept seeing him
[43:19] he says oh Lord forgive me
[43:23] we're having this bad attitude towards
[43:27] and he gets closer to her later on
[43:30] after he has seen the vision is a
[43:47] [Music]
[44:01] [Music]
[44:17] [Music]
[44:27] and that woman went back to the path of
[44:29] God
[44:45] sometimes I had a bad attitude
[44:50] with Beggars around the streets
[45:11] [Music]
[45:19] but studying this
[45:45] [Music]
[46:01] we have to be we have to be sure that we
[46:04] have it
[46:04] [Music]
[46:15] [Music]
[46:27] um
[46:31] [Music]
[46:32] the word became flesh preached 1954 on
[46:35] 1003
[46:37] you say
[46:39] yes and I recognized the other day
[46:43] okay
[46:46] a selfish Spirit coming in me uh and
[46:50] what it is
[46:56] [Music]
[47:11] [Music]
[47:12] the messenger he recognized it is
[47:16] [Music]
[47:19] this man is wrong I had to tell him
[47:21] about it
[47:26] he says that's wrong God is the one to
[47:28] tell him about it so no no song means
[47:31] negotios that's not it's none of my
[47:33] business
[47:37] my business is to preach the gospel and
[47:39] love everybody
[47:43] and love my enemies
[47:45] as Jesus Christ loved me
[47:48] one of the first Commandments is
[47:51] to love the Lord
[48:04] why do I have to love him with all of my
[48:06] heart
[48:28] you know
[48:30] [Music]
[48:32] the messenger says
[48:35] Jesus Christ loved me Jesus Christ loved
[48:38] us first
[48:40] and us as Christians
[48:43] it says we don't fold our hands
[48:48] [Music]
[48:50] there's something wrong
[48:53] amen brothers
[48:55] because Jesus gave the first step
[48:58] he loved us first
[49:02] that's why we have to be that way
[49:05] we have to uh that's the attitude that's
[49:09] the Christian attitude
[49:11] I'll be reading another quote
[49:16] [Music]
[49:20] the reaction to an action preacher
[49:22] 1959-08-10
[49:24] they say
[49:26] yes
[49:29] you say oh praise God I believe in the
[49:32] baptism of the Holy Spirit
[49:34] he says that this is what we say
[49:39] oh praise God I believe in the baptism
[49:42] of the holy spirit
[49:44] in the first little Temptation that
[49:46] comes along
[49:49] you fly off like a buzzsaw
[49:52] foreign
[50:04] [Music]
[50:48] Luciano he told me he was Christian you
[50:51] know
[50:54] [Music]
[50:56] and he didn't have the correct tool he
[50:58] needed to do a certain job
[51:00] he started saying
[51:05] all sorts of things were coming out
[51:07] he went to the store you want to go buy
[51:11] the tool he needed
[51:14] he was throwing it from halfway across
[51:16] he was angry well this is
[51:21] so we have attitude towards another
[51:24] person it's a it's a attitude the
[51:27] attitude is for good or it's for bad
[51:32] that is how we should behave
[51:35] amen Brothers
[51:41] I'm going to go into the Book of John
[51:43] 11.
[51:47] we'll be bringing Through The Story of
[51:49] Lazarus
[51:50] which caught my attention
[51:53] of Martha and Mary
[51:58] Jesus
[52:02] where in John 11 4.
[52:14] glorification when did you heard that he
[52:17] said the sickness is not unto death but
[52:19] for the glory of God that the Son of God
[52:21] might be glorified thereby
[52:24] Marta
[52:26] is
[52:28] here Martha's Brothers had gone to tell
[52:30] him that Lazarus was sick
[52:35] o
[52:39] now Jesus loved Martha and her sister
[52:42] and Lazarus
[52:45] [Music]
[52:51] when he had heard it therefore he was
[52:54] sick he about two days in the same place
[52:55] where he was
[52:57] in other words
[52:59] he knew that he was in agony and he was
[53:03] about to die
[53:07] but as we say sometimes those who are
[53:09] hourly workers
[53:11] he stayed more days there esperando
[53:14] waiting
[53:16] for Lazarus to pass away
[53:20] and we're jumping by we're going to 11.
[53:25] is
[53:34] said unto them our friend Lazarus
[53:36] sleepeth but I go that I may awake him
[53:39] out of sleep
[53:42] then said his disciples Lord if he sleep
[53:45] he shall Do Dwell well
[54:13] he said he is already dead
[54:26] and I am glad for your sakes I was not
[54:29] there till the intent you may believe
[54:30] nevertheless let us go on to him
[54:33] here's the Lord Jesus saying
[54:37] that thankfully that no disciples were
[54:39] there
[54:42] who he was
[54:44] foreign
[54:48] [Music]
[54:55] in the grave four days already
[55:03] decompose after four days
[55:09] Integra your liver begins to
[55:12] disintegrate
[55:13] your brain begins to disintegrate
[55:17] in the bacteria stick over the body
[55:20] that's why there is a putrid smell
[55:29] [Music]
[55:34] she heard that Jesus was coming went and
[55:37] met him but Mary sat still in the house
[55:42] Jesus
[55:46] unto Jesus Lord if thou has been here my
[55:49] brother had not died
[55:52] if you would have been here amen
[56:15] Hermanos
[56:17] um
[56:26] were sisters and they were a brother of
[56:29] Lazarus they're Lazarus sisters
[56:37] the master says I am here I am the life
[56:40] in the way and whoever comes to me shall
[56:41] not die
[56:43] um
[56:48] thy word preached in
[56:50] 1948-0305
[56:52] [Music]
[56:56] when he was standing there at the side
[56:58] of the grave of Lazarus
[57:03] [Music]
[57:08] crying and the tears running down his
[57:10] cheeks
[57:14] Lazarus but
[57:17] that was his human feeling for the
[57:19] people in
[57:23] by the side of the grave
[57:26] L said take your way the stone
[57:29] just take you away the stone is
[57:39] says you got to do your part
[57:43] anytime you say Lord help me change
[57:46] Lord help me
[57:49] in order to change
[57:51] we have to do our part
[57:55] [Music]
[57:56] those two little frail women
[58:01] and when he took away the stone I can
[58:03] hear him clear
[58:06] yes
[58:09] hears me always
[58:12] Lazaro
[58:18] but you can hear him scream with a loud
[58:20] voice way out during the spirit land
[58:22] Lazarus
[58:24] this element
[58:26] the measure says that if he has said
[58:28] Lazarus
[58:29] the resurrection would have happened
[58:32] that's why he called them by name
[58:34] Lazarus
[58:39] I believe he says a general Resurrection
[58:41] right there
[58:45] and I believe that's what I think that's
[58:47] right he said Lazarus come forth
[59:15] stood up on his feet again
[59:23] please come forth
[59:27] I'm going to read one more quote
[59:34] this is
[59:41] sometimes we've been reviled or hurt
[59:44] s we've been betrayed
[59:47] Los Angeles they have rejected us
[59:50] they have hurt us emotionally
[59:55] the unpardonable sin
[59:57] was Jesus
[59:58] for Jesus when he was reviled
[1:00:05] revital means to use insulting language
[1:00:07] [Music]
[1:00:09] you are vowed not again
[1:00:14] [Music]
[1:00:26] when they done evil to him he turned and
[1:00:29] did good to them
[1:00:37] when they persecuted him and nailed him
[1:00:39] to the Cross he looked down and said
[1:00:43] his father forgive them for they don't
[1:00:46] know what they're doing
[1:00:49] [Music]
[1:00:51] that's an attitude that goes beyond
[1:00:53] those limits
[1:00:56] let's hurt us no no
[1:00:59] no punch
[1:01:01] you want to fight with them
[1:01:04] a man amen you yeah
[1:01:07] it says forgive them for they don't know
[1:01:10] what they're doing
[1:01:13] a club the Speedy too
[1:01:15] see this is
[1:01:18] that the kind of spirit is not in you
[1:01:22] the Holy Ghost has never entered you yet
[1:01:25] for
[1:01:28] that was the Same Spirit was on Christ
[1:01:31] Jesus
[1:01:34] the Bible said let it be in you Christ
[1:01:36] in his church
[1:01:38] let it be in you Christ is in his church
[1:01:42] so maybe they hurt us physically
[1:01:45] we want to respond
[1:01:48] where they hurt us emotionally we feel
[1:01:51] bad
[1:01:53] once I saw a friend
[1:01:58] foreign
[1:02:03] news is I said 20 years
[1:02:06] he says how much damage did he do to you
[1:02:09] his brother-in-law says he didn't lend
[1:02:12] me his bicycle
[1:02:14] sometimes that's the way we are
[1:02:17] little small things
[1:02:20] we get we started two other things a man
[1:02:23] amen
[1:02:24] [Music]
[1:02:26] I'm gonna give some time to our pastor
[1:02:28] um
[1:02:30] may God bless you Brothers
[1:02:33] [Music]
[1:02:34] [Applause]
[1:02:45] okay
[1:02:50] stand up for a minute
[1:02:52] I'm not going to take too long
[1:02:56] um I do want to
[1:02:58] send the the people where we were at
[1:03:00] last week and
[1:03:02] San Luis they send their greetings
[1:03:07] we had a good time
[1:03:11] and everything has to do with attitude
[1:03:15] we have um
[1:03:19] um
[1:03:20] something that we're going to be doing
[1:03:22] there in San Luis
[1:03:24] it's a project
[1:03:26] it's going to take a little while
[1:03:29] you'll be hearing about it
[1:03:32] and what we want to try to do
[1:03:36] we're going to build a church
[1:03:39] let me say it again we want to build the
[1:03:43] church
[1:03:47] in the 80s they were small it was a
[1:03:50] small group
[1:03:53] The 90s there was a small group
[1:03:57] we call individuals going there was
[1:04:00] still a small group individuals
[1:04:07] lately
[1:04:09] we have had the church grow
[1:04:14] and it's time that we start looking at
[1:04:17] the future of San Luis
[1:04:21] there's a lot of souls there I would say
[1:04:25] there's a million people
[1:04:27] there's people to be saved
[1:04:32] let me say it again a positive positive
[1:04:36] attitude will bring people in
[1:04:39] the smile that we have
[1:04:42] is what they need
[1:04:45] what people want
[1:04:47] is to have confidence in someone
[1:04:53] yes or no see no people are looking
[1:04:56] we're in an age
[1:04:58] we're confused people don't know what to
[1:05:01] do people don't believe this is
[1:05:06] just the very same thing that brother
[1:05:09] Milton was speaking about
[1:05:11] we lost our vision
[1:05:15] let me say it again
[1:05:17] Christianity has lost its Vision
[1:05:21] what we need to do as a church
[1:05:24] we're in the lighthouse because we are a
[1:05:28] lighthouse
[1:05:29] we need to give light is
[1:05:32] also individuals those individuals
[1:05:37] individuals
[1:05:41] [Music]
[1:05:46] that's our correct attitude we need to
[1:05:50] have it in other words if I want to give
[1:05:53] something I have what they're asking
[1:05:56] foreign
[1:06:18] I'm Gonna Let You Go a minute thinking
[1:06:21] about you you're touching us
[1:06:25] because if I was to say who's the
[1:06:28] grouchiest person here
[1:06:31] Mommy on a Monday and I won't tell you
[1:06:34] and you won't know
[1:06:36] call me Monday
[1:06:40] I'm the biggest grouchy person on a
[1:06:42] Monday
[1:06:47] why okay because the test is on
[1:06:51] why because everybody thinks
[1:06:56] that there's only one persona
[1:07:01] that can give you the confidence that
[1:07:03] you need or the advice that you need
[1:07:07] it's Jesus it's Jesus it's Jesus the
[1:07:11] only one
[1:07:12] that will care and take care of your
[1:07:15] burdens
[1:07:17] you don't have to fight anymore
[1:07:19] he will fight for you but we have to
[1:07:23] stay
[1:07:23] potatoes
[1:07:25] we gotta stay positive
[1:07:28] so I wake up in the wrong side of the
[1:07:31] bed
[1:07:33] Moderno
[1:07:43] he models himself the way he talks the
[1:07:48] way he looks the way he behaves
[1:07:53] how he dresses his appearance
[1:07:59] now let's look at the sister
[1:08:03] that's the other side of the coineda
[1:08:07] again
[1:08:09] needs to dress the way she should be
[1:08:12] dressing
[1:08:14] otherwise the Modern Man the modern
[1:08:16] husband the model of the generation
[1:08:20] the first thing they're going to imitate
[1:08:24] what you are
[1:08:28] and we need to be careful because one
[1:08:31] anointing spirit
[1:08:34] will attract the other person is
[1:08:40] so don't blame the devil
[1:08:42] poor guy we're always blame blaming the
[1:08:45] devil
[1:08:48] it's our attitude
[1:08:51] again if we have the correct attitude
[1:08:57] people will come they'll want to be
[1:08:59] around you
[1:09:02] so God bless you this morning
[1:09:05] uh that's all I'm going to say I'm not
[1:09:08] going to say too much about anything
[1:09:10] I'll wait till I preach again
[1:09:13] uh I do want to say this
[1:09:17] there's a person here we're going to be
[1:09:19] praying for it
[1:09:22] what happened was there was an accident
[1:09:25] there's always accidents
[1:09:28] no matter what we do we're going to have
[1:09:30] an accident
[1:09:38] is paralyzed
[1:09:45] how would you like to be in that
[1:09:46] position
[1:09:48] how would your attitude be
[1:09:51] more so if you're a Christian Cristiano
[1:09:55] well it happened
[1:10:01] so we're going to pray
[1:10:03] but prior I'm going to give you a
[1:10:05] testimony
[1:10:06] I'm giving the testimony wants to come
[1:10:09] forward as a representative
[1:10:13] of his brother

[1:10:42] there
[1:10:45] adios
[1:11:06] miracles happen

[1:11:13] without thinking oh here we go again
[1:11:17] God is on the same for a purpose
[1:11:24] and when God comes on the same
[1:11:27] God that heals

[1:13:22] done and no matter who it is
[1:13:26] sooner or later God will put you in a
[1:13:29] bed so then you can cry out
[1:13:33] when you come on
