speaks about pastors you up a little bit let's say you're going to get married let's call brother to come here let's say you died it's called brother branham he knew that there would be that spirit there that's why i said pastors continue reading [Music] [Music] yes it is order oh brother how can you be so low from reading the scripture why did the holy ghost set teachers in the church then this is true you say see i don't have to have anybody teach me the holy ghost teaches means he set your teachers in the church can you say man jeffersonville october 15 1961 if you can't respect a man respect the office he holds in god respected respect him if a minister comes up your pastor always respect him i've heard congregations talk about their pastor how they just talk write him down and ridicule him how is that pastor ever going to do anything for you he can't do it did he go there you notice say what you feel like saying about him he can't help you what's the point you can say amen that's why i want to hear another man now that was a little better wasn't it you've got to know he's a human being i believe sincerely the people forget that the pastor is a human being did you know that a lot of people so you know i mean is there no crushing to my face they'll curse me to my assistant my helper dicker's my name oh crush my assistant ride his face how many hours is that from 7 in the morning to 10 at night sunday 16 hours is that right then the people only human you've got to know he's a human being the holy ghost has made him bishop overseer okay i'm sorry you would you write down for me brother eddie over here the holy ghost santo has made him over here obispo a composed word which comes from two different words over sobre and fear video of the scripture when god spoke through the mouth of moses i will raise a prophet unto thee i told you the dead was the lord jesus christ [Music] just stay there brother the holy ghost has made him and no matter what the pastor has done him that sent me through jesus god demands respect for his servants respect that sermon you respect god [Applause] he doesn't respect you because they don't say the lord page and stay in the spirit okay might be down there stay in the spirit the world realizing that you're going to be lost if you don't you're lost see no losses significant [Applause] here a friend selected to manage the pastoral work of a congregation to which he belongs that's one of the reasons why i have not placed pastors i could have i believe that one should raise up from there from the congregation a friend and that friend [Music] is selected to manage manager now forget it third base nothing the ball game comes john doe didn't show up this day because they want to have the managers a puppet manager but the manager's place to manage and the people the team i mean is that right i'm here amen over here okay over here over here is one that supervises or to discharge another employee or recommend or to recommend such action i want you to mark me down these words okay and and i haven't got time i'm not even halfway to my message i haven't got time to finish my message but i want you to mark this down okay a supervisor supervisor has the authority are you okay after now by the end ready recall promote promo uh no wonder that people don't want to have a pastor look it up in the dictionary what take away his office is that right a trustee is one to whom something isn't trusted and the holy ghost has entrusted the pastor the souls of allah luther could bring nothing but sprigs within about three years they start an organization the nomination starts at our organization but have you noticed this has been sweeping for 20 years now there's no organization [Music] [Music] leadership and then the first thing you know that life left the stock and went into the castle outside of the three stages wesley pentecost just exactly why i do that you can't interrupt nature [Music] didn't jesus say in the last days matthew 24 24 the two would be so close it would deceive the very genes predestinated the elect the elected one if it was possible seed laying there is a predestination to see that our lander that will only be watered by the type of water that's give for that seeds it won't grow any other condition it must be the condition that grows is is so that someone might say oh that garcia or
