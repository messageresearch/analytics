[32:42] way how can I overcome today
[32:47] Revelations chapter 3 verse 20.
[32:56] behold I stand at the door and knock If
[32:59] any man hear my voice and open the door
[33:01] I will come into him and will sup with

[33:10] in Sutra 21 to him that overcometh will
[33:14] I grant to sit with me in my throne even
[33:17] as I also overcame and am set down with
[33:20] my father in history
[33:26] then I'm here with the spirit saith unto
[33:28] the churches let me take your seats
[33:32] these scriptures we just read some
[33:34] parties
[33:36] are part of a longer text
[33:42] um
[33:46] Revelations
[33:50] dedicated to the Lord
[33:53] in which we believe we've been taught
[33:57] during these times
[34:00] so one can say that these words
[34:03] are dedicated to us
[34:40] he was criticized foreign
[35:05] [Music]
[35:06] a very feasible situation he elected
[35:10] Abraham's Island
[35:13] where he was very comfortable
[35:19] when to follow the lord and he was able
[35:22] to overcome
[35:25] Isaac after Isaac came Jacob and Jacob
[35:33] his name was changed to Israel okay
[35:36] which means fighting with God he the the
[35:39] Israel and from Israel Jacob
[35:43] the Israel the 12 tribes of Israel
[35:48] tribes from the tribe
[35:52] in terms of Moses
[35:55] who's a very famous story
[35:57] that many of us know
[36:01] we know how Moses went to
[36:04] Egyptians
[36:06] he freed the people that were in slavery
[36:11] and once he let him out of Egypt
[36:17] the Lord was with them and they were
[36:19] able to overcome
[36:21] we have many examples
[36:24] how they were able to overcome
[36:27] the time of Moses
[36:31] comes the time of the great Joshua
[36:34] and the sister would like to focus on
[36:36] this evening
[36:38] Josue in the time of the great Joshua
[36:42] this is the time that comes immediately
[36:44] after yes
[36:46] after Moses dies and from there
[36:51] Lord gives a commission to Joshua
[36:55] after the death of Moses
[37:02] the first chapter
[37:05] Lord gives Joshua a vision
[37:08] tells him that
[37:11] um foreign
[38:11] something and it's your part they eat to
[38:13] go and take it and remember
[38:17] we're speaking how can we overcome today
[38:22] as the Lord tells Joshua the way I was
[38:26] with Moses
[38:42] this is part of the commission
[38:44] if the Lord
[38:53] we'll continue with the first chapter of
[38:55] Joshua Josue Joshua 1 9.
[38:59] if it turns to we'll have it here on our
[39:01] screen
[39:04] I put it on my
[39:06] in Josue Joshua 1 9.
[39:11] it's a very well known scripture
[39:15] maybe in different homes they have it on
[39:17] the wall you see it in Social places
[39:32] so this is part of Joshua's commission
[39:35] fear notes
[39:37] made
[39:49] Joshua orders the people of Israel to
[39:53] prepare themselves
[39:57] they have the land with God has promised
[40:00] us
[40:02] and the people of Israel
[40:05] see now that Josh was the electorate
[40:07] ladies ladies they tell him okay
[40:10] were you ever sent it where you sent us
[40:12] will you tell us
[40:17] this is the people of Israel telling
[40:20] Joshua
[40:22] is
[40:24] where Joshua starts going up for the
[40:27] promised land Josue and Joshua
[40:30] gets two spies and sends them to Jericho
[40:35] is these two spies
[40:38] and
[40:44] find himself next to the wall the
[40:47] Jericho the wall of Jericho
[40:50] there was a woman
[40:52] who was there and they entered there
[40:57] is
[41:00] people have gone here from the people of
[41:04] Israel
[41:05] oh
[41:25] and she says
[41:33] she had hit them on the roof these two
[41:37] spies
[41:42] once the soldiers left they were
[41:44] searching foreign
[43:19] um
[44:17] of War
[44:20] you will March towards the city he
[44:23] is and before them
[44:30] foreign
[45:51] foreign
[46:32] the Lord tells Joshua
[46:35] this day
[46:40] Israel I will begin to enlarge your name
[46:42] before all of Israel
[46:45] and God gives the order to Joshua Deke
[46:49] to cross the Jordan River he
[47:46] they walked across the Jordan River
[48:49] you can tell them
[48:58] how can we go overcome today
[49:02] and in chapter five
[49:22] because they had been in the desert for
[49:24] 40 years
[49:29] and the Lord tells Joshua yeah after he
[49:33] had done that with the new generation
[49:35] tells him yeah continue
[49:58] continues on his way and in that way
[50:03] he finds himself
[50:08] brother Branham says that he was alone
[50:11] he was walking alone and suddenly looked
[50:14] up
[50:14] and there was a man before him
[50:19] he says
[50:36] foreign
