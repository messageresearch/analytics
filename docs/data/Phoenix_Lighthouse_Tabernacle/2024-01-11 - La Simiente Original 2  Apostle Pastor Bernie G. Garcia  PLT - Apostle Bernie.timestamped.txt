[13:11] let's stand
[13:14] please read the
[13:20] scripture be reading Genesis chapter
[13:24] 1 verses 1 to
[13:27] 11
[13:30] subject that we've taken is the Original
[13:41] Seed this will be the second sermon or
[13:44] message on that subject and we'll
[13:45] probably have to leave it because it's
[13:47] we won't have enough time to cover the
[13:48] whole
[13:57] subject
[14:27] EXP
[14:57] for
[15:00] [Music]
[15:15] in the beginning God created the Heaven
[15:16] and the Earth and the Earth was without
[15:18] form and void and darkness was upon the
[15:21] face of the deep and the spirit of God
[15:23] moved upon the face of the waters and
[15:25] God said let there be light and there
[15:27] was light and God saw the light that it
[15:30] was good and God divided the light from
[15:32] the darkness and God called the light
[15:34] day and the Darkness he called night and
[15:37] the evening and the morning were the
[15:38] first day
[15:40] am and God said let there be a fir in
[15:43] the midst of the waters and let it
[15:44] divide the waters from the waters and
[15:45] God made the firmament and divided the
[15:47] waters which were under the firmament
[15:49] from the waters which were above the
[15:50] firmament and it was so and God called
[15:52] the fir me heaven and the evening and
[15:54] the morning with the second day and God
[15:56] said let the waters from under the
[15:57] heavens be gathered unto one place and
[15:59] let the dry land appear and it was so
[16:01] and God called the dry land Earth and
[16:03] the Gathering Together the waters he
[16:04] called seas and God saw that it was good
[16:07] and God said let the Earth bring forth
[16:09] grass the herb yielding seed and the
[16:12] fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind
[16:14] whose seed is in itself upon the Earth
[16:17] and it was
[16:19] so now Genesis
[16:27] 2:7
[16:35] and the Lord God formed man of the Dust
[16:37] of the ground and breathed into his
[16:38] nostrils a breath of life and Man became
[16:41] a living
[16:42] Soul let us pray to
[16:49] God once again Lord we place ourselves
[16:51] in your hands and we report for
[16:57] service
[16:59] we ask that you may still us quietness
[17:02] so that we may meditate and think on
[17:03] your
[17:07] word may we receive the teaching from
[17:09] your
[17:12] word we thank you for the message of the
[17:15] last
[17:17] hour and also the messenger that you
[17:19] sent that
[17:23] message had it not been for that message
[17:25] we would not be in
[17:26] confusion we thank you once again
[17:30] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[17:31] amen amen you may be
[17:38] seated subject we have taken is the
[17:40] original
[17:46] seed I'd like to make a comment before
[17:48] entering into the
[17:56] teaching Dr my Christian life I've heard
[17:59] comments from a very illustrious
[18:10] Man by God's grace I was able to read
[18:12] one of his articles last
[18:17] week when I started comparing it to the
[18:27] scriptures I was amazed at how far away
[18:30] from scriptural truth this man
[18:35] is this man is famous worldwide and has
[18:38] a radio program worldwide
[18:48] also and many of the Believers in the
[18:50] Pentecostal age and message have been
[18:52] swept under the teachings of this
[18:57] man
[19:04] and I've seen in reading his editorial
[19:06] that he does it really wisely but he's
[19:08] so far away from
[19:17] scripture we're not bragging now but we
[19:20] believe that brother bam was sent with
[19:22] the word for this
[19:27] hour
[19:31] and if brother BR did teach something
[19:32] that that the people are not accustomed
[19:34] to or used
[19:41] to we don't blame the people for at
[19:43] first rejecting what the prophet
[19:51] brought but if they would just but
[19:53] listen I believe that the Lord would
[19:54] open up their understanding of L
[19:57] people
[19:59] because everything that the prophet
[20:00] taught is
[20:10] scriptural we read in the scripture
[20:12] there in Genesis how each seed was to
[20:13] produce reproduce after its own
[20:17] kind how many of you believe that each
[20:19] God's word reproduces according to its
[20:21] own
[20:27] kind we've seen that the Original Seed
[20:30] is Jesus Christ is that
[20:33] right he is a
[20:41] logos we see how that when God said let
[20:44] the man come forth man came
[20:49] forth and that man was a spiritual
[20:54] man then we have the scripture in
[20:56] Genesis 2:7
[21:00] now this is another
[21:01] man how many of you can say Amen to
[21:13] this see here that God breathed into his
[21:15] nostrils the breath of life and Man
[21:16] became a living
[21:21] Soul so this takes us now to the
[21:23] beginning of the teaching this
[21:26] morning help me out
[21:28] so we can
[21:33] progress being aware that we can't cover
[21:36] I can't cover a lot of
[21:39] ground I have drawn here three
[21:45] circles first circle is the
[21:50] body the body of every human
[21:55] being this body is of what
[21:59] it's a body of
[22:03] Flesh our flesh body each and every one
[22:06] of us I have a
[22:10] question where was that body of Flesh
[22:16] formed whose
[22:18] womb in the mother's
[22:21] womb is that
[22:25] right the body was formed in the
[22:28] mother's
[22:32] womb the second Circle we have is the
[22:35] [Music]
[22:38] spirit where was the
[22:42] spirit where was that Spirit
[22:49] formed outside what
[22:52] body in the
[22:54] world outside the mother in in the world
[22:59] is that
[23:00] right you're not too
[23:03] sure brother
[23:06] says when the M mother is about to give
[23:12] birth a spirit is surrounding that
[23:17] mother brother bam calls it an
[23:20] angel a
[23:26] spirit brother says when mother drops or
[23:28] the baby drops delivers a
[23:32] baby says that the body comes out of the
[23:35] mother's
[23:39] womb and that there's no Spirit to
[23:41] receive that body then that body is
[23:43] still
[23:43] born is that
[23:46] right is that
[23:49] right if you don't understand it so I
[23:51] can repeat
[23:56] it that person being inside the womb
[23:59] does not have a spirit
[24:01] yet spirit is
[24:04] outside it's in the
[24:06] world waiting for that
[24:13] baby when that enters into the
[24:19] baby then that baby becomes a living
[24:24] Soul when it becomes a living soul
[24:31] the soul and the spirit are just like
[24:32] that
[24:34] together there's no one that can
[24:36] separate the soul from the
[24:41] spirit the only thing that can separate
[24:43] the spirit in the soul is God's
[24:46] word and the Word was
[24:49] brought that's the only thing that can
[24:51] separate one from the
[24:53] other and the spirit and the
[24:56] soul I wrote here as a heart
[25:00] they're both in the
[25:02] heart how many of you believe
[25:05] that if you're sure say
[25:10] amen and if I ask later ask you a
[25:12] question and you answer wrong it's
[25:13] because you weren't
[25:15] sure brother
[25:21] says says that the soul is the nature of
[25:24] the spirit they're not separated they're
[25:27] together
[25:29] two different
[25:30] things one is the other one is the
[25:35] soul so the soul is the nature of the
[25:38] spirit the prophet
[25:44] says says your brain is not your
[25:50] intelligence it's your spirit that's in
[25:52] you is your
[25:54] intelligence brother benam
[25:56] said
[25:59] says the mind is the womb of the
[26:02] spirit so the
[26:04] mind is not the intelligence how many of
[26:08] you believe
[26:10] this says notice how
[26:13] simple the
[26:16] mind is the womb of the
[26:19] spirit but the mind is not the
[26:26] intelligence so what the serpent was
[26:28] looking for when he made contact with
[26:30] Eve and what he was
[26:33] seeking was the
[26:36] spirit This Woman's
[26:39] spirit because he was seeking
[26:43] intelligence and when a person starts to
[26:45] converse with
[26:47] another seeking out his
[26:53] intelligence according to person's
[26:54] intelligence is how you going coexist
[26:56] with them
[26:59] even that's why even in
[27:03] marriages many couples cannot
[27:08] coexist there's not an equality
[27:10] intellectually
[27:12] speaking except they both surrender to
[27:15] the word then there's no
[27:18] problems but there has to be a
[27:22] coexistence and according to the
[27:24] intelligence of that person is how you
[27:25] can coexist with them
[27:31] so the serpent was seeking the
[27:33] womb the
[27:36] mind that's the only way he could get to
[27:39] her
[27:41] spirit the spirit is the
[27:44] life to be able to
[27:47] enter and place in
[27:51] her not in her
[27:53] soul but rather in her
[27:56] flesh
[27:58] to bring about our reproduction of the
[27:59] human
[28:02] being but first of all he had to insert
[28:04] himself inject himself into the human
[28:06] race not just in the
[28:10] body but in the deepest heart of that
[28:12] human
[28:14] being once again
[28:17] review the
[28:20] body of a human beings is formed
[28:26] where
[28:29] for all of you that know to answer at
[28:30] one
[28:31] time if you understand this I need for
[28:33] you to
[28:34] answer where was your body
[28:41] formed where was the
[28:45] spirit Spirit was outside the
[28:49] body so here's the key for you to be
[28:52] able to
[28:53] understand why you need have to be born
[28:56] again
[29:00] how many of you believe that you've been
[29:01] born again say
[29:03] [Music]
[29:05] Amen this
[29:07] birth this new
[29:09] birth where is that taken where does
[29:11] that take
[29:14] place
[29:16] where it's in the heart of the human
[29:21] being so then there is a spiritual
[29:24] birth is that right
[29:28] how you believe that you've had a new
[29:29] birthday
[29:31] amen where did this new birth take place
[29:35] in the heart in the human's
[29:38] heart if it be
[29:42] so if you were born
[29:46] again you're a spiritual Spirit
[29:50] man how many of you believe your person
[29:53] a new creature say if you believe that
[29:59] so
[30:00] here this this returns you back to
[30:04] Genesis
[30:05] 1 The Original
[30:09] Seed this takes you back to Genesis
[30:14] 1 but when you get down to
[30:17] Genesis
[30:19] 27 we still have not been return to the
[30:22] to that
[30:24] yet because this body will prove it
[30:26] later
[30:28] came by
[30:33] sex this body was formed in a mother's
[30:38] womb and that conception came through a
[30:40] sexual
[30:42] act it is not Original
[30:47] Seed it's a
[30:49] byproduct it's a secondary type of
[30:52] act not God's perfect
[30:56] will
[30:57] but God has made his new
[30:59] creatures in the
[31:02] inside but as long as we're living here
[31:04] on this
[31:05] Earth until the Resurrection
[31:09] comes we're burying in us two
[31:15] men if we could say so you can get it
[31:18] right
[31:18] away but we're trying to say if we're
[31:20] born
[31:22] again we're a grain of
[31:25] wheat how many of you believe grain of
[31:29] wheat the only problem is that there a
[31:31] grain of
[31:32] wheat inside a cocko
[31:37] [Music]
[31:40] bir is
[31:45] sticky and that needs
[31:50] water up until the Resurrection
[31:54] comes you can be a new creature in
[31:56] Christ Jesus
[31:58] but if you're not getting water you get
[32:00] real sticky real sticky thorny and you
[32:04] get you
[32:08] stick we'll be entering into the
[32:10] teaching that I have for this morning
[32:16] now how many of you believe that God's
[32:19] word is the Original
[32:23] Seed this subject that I've taken the
[32:25] Original Seed
[32:30] the prophet says that the Original
[32:32] Seed is Jesus
[32:38] Christ in order to understand this we
[32:40] have to give a little bit of a
[32:44] review he says this is the original
[32:48] seed it's God's
[32:50] word it's a
[32:52] logus in other
[32:56] words
[32:58] the word said that and then and God
[33:01] said when he said
[33:04] something what he said was is the
[33:06] Original
[33:12] Seed but then that seed created other
[33:17] seeds spoken the original
[33:22] seed that Original Seed brought forth
[33:24] millions of
[33:25] seeds
[33:28] so those
[33:30] seeds become part of
[33:34] him even
[33:37] we are a seed of God we're God's
[33:41] word we're part of
[33:43] God we're
[33:45] original because we're part of
[33:49] him he is the
[33:52] original if you understand me up to now
[33:55] say
[33:55] Amen
[33:58] if I don't have enough
[34:00] time to get to where I wanted to get
[34:07] to I want to give you or say to you what
[34:10] has amazed
[34:12] me I am a new
[34:17] creature I believe you are are
[34:22] also I believe that I am that Spirit man
[34:26] and I'm speaking about the Inside
[34:29] [Music]
[34:33] Man that Spirit man that the Bible says
[34:35] that God created in His image and
[34:39] likeness I believe that when he chose
[34:44] me he knew what would be coming
[34:48] forth he knew that the fall would come
[34:55] about he knew that every man would be
[34:58] brought forth in
[35:02] sin he knew that that body of
[35:06] Flesh would not be changed until the
[35:12] resurrection he knew that the spirit man
[35:14] brother Bernie
[35:18] Garcia would live inside that cockle
[35:23] bir and he had enough trust in me
[35:27] that even so he chose
[35:32] me because I have noticed that see
[35:34] there's evil in
[35:38] me I have come to the conclusion that
[35:40] the wrong the evil is in
[35:45] me I have come to a conclusion that this
[35:48] body that I have is
[35:51] sin I that I was sold into
[35:55] sin
[35:59] and that that first man forfeited me and
[36:01] handed me over into
[36:03] slavery I've come to the
[36:05] conclusion that God chose
[36:08] me and he has me in this body ofh in a
[36:14] that desires those things of the
[36:17] world but yet he had enough trust in
[36:20] me that this Inside
[36:25] Man was going to bring cocko bir body
[36:27] into
[36:29] subjection and that's what makes me
[36:32] cry he had enough trust in
[36:35] me this 20th century that we're now
[36:37] living
[36:38] in you can't hardly trust
[36:45] anybody before the prophet said that
[36:47] beforehand you could shake make a
[36:48] contract with a man agreement and shake
[36:50] hands with
[36:51] him and that man was manad enough to
[36:53] keep his word in that
[36:55] contract
[36:58] now you even have a a contract notorized
[37:00] by not Republic and even that way they
[37:02] still don't keep
[37:03] it that's the age that we but in this
[37:10] age God placed a group of
[37:13] seed group of
[37:16] wheat inside
[37:19] birs and they trusted
[37:24] them trusted them that they will be the
[37:26] manifestation of the sons of God and
[37:29] that all
[37:31] creation be restored back to its
[37:33] original
[37:35] condition this is the age of
[37:37] restoration through the original SE when
[37:41] I see it like
[37:42] that I said oh you're
[37:45] tremendous you're so great I don't even
[37:47] trust myself but and I've always said
[37:49] that I don't even trust
[37:53] myself yeah you trust
[37:55] me me to break down and
[37:59] cry when we come to the awareness of
[38:03] that what will happen to us what what
[38:05] happened to that
[38:07] man brother Bram
[38:11] says was a couple that got
[38:17] married the woman she was a really a
[38:20] strong Christian an oldfashioned
[38:23] Christian and the young man was a young
[38:26] a new
[38:30] believer and when they got married the
[38:32] young lady said to her
[38:33] husband I want you to know
[38:37] something if you ever
[38:42] backslide I want you to know that I'll
[38:44] be here at home waiting for
[38:47] you I I love you and I'll receive you
[38:50] I'll take you back don't go anywhere
[38:54] else you come back home I'll be here
[38:56] waiting for
[38:58] you the young man told his fellow
[39:01] workers this is what my wife told
[39:05] me how could I ever do anything
[39:10] wrong when she trusts me so
[39:13] much I believe that when we can
[39:15] understand
[39:17] this how will we ever break or violate
[39:19] that
[39:21] trust see he trusts
[39:24] me he trusts you
[39:27] that when this inside man comes
[39:30] out this Inside Man is that body the
[39:33] outside
[39:34] man he trusts
[39:38] us you can live in that body of
[39:41] sin but you're going to be
[39:44] manifested my image will be reflected
[39:46] through your life I trust
[39:49] you that you're going to do the right
[39:51] thing you're going to follow my
[39:53] word this is beautiful
[39:57] let's look
[39:58] now Romans
[40:02] 612 if you're understanding a little bit
[40:04] up to now say
[40:06] man Romans
[40:09] 612 excuse me Romans
[40:13] 5:12 you see why I don't even trust
[40:17] myself
[40:21] wherefore as by one man sin entered into
[40:24] the world
[40:31] and death by sin and so death passed
[40:33] upon all men for that all have
[40:37] sinned how did or how did Sin enter
[40:40] [Music]
[40:43] in where where did Sin enter
[40:48] into the Bible
[40:52] says see sin entered into the world
[40:57] this is the
[40:59] world where did the sin where did Sin
[41:02] enter in or to
[41:06] what into the
[41:08] world is that
[41:10] right what is
[41:13] sin
[41:15] unbelief and it has a life has a
[41:20] spirit has a spirit that's going to end
[41:22] but yet it has a
[41:24] life so then the spirit
[41:28] entered into the
[41:31] world when you come out of your mother's
[41:34] womb what do you enter
[41:36] into to the
[41:39] world and what's waiting for you is a
[41:42] spirit and whose spirit is this it's
[41:45] Spirit of the
[41:46] world because it's in the world is that
[41:51] right it's the
[41:53] life this life was permitted it's God's
[41:56] permissive
[41:58] will it's that God
[42:01] permitted for
[42:03] humankind to populate the
[42:07] world you and I are part of them through
[42:10] a permissive
[42:11] will and when we come to this
[42:14] world we're all
[42:17] liars
[42:19] thieves
[42:22] Killers that's the nature that's in
[42:25] US
[42:27] each and every one of
[42:29] us sin entered into the
[42:32] world unbelief entered into the
[42:34] world and it you have
[42:37] to needs a body to
[42:40] live and it's waiting for the human
[42:42] being's body to be to
[42:45] live blessed be the name of but thanks
[42:48] be to God that sin entered by one
[42:52] man but also by one man is sin taken
[42:55] away
[42:58] let's read psalms
[43:02] 515 I trust that you're writing down the
[43:11] scriptures behold I was shapen in
[43:14] iniquity and in sin did my mother
[43:16] conceive
[43:18] me how many of
[43:22] you believe that you have
[43:25] sinned
[43:28] brother bam on page
[43:37] 501 some people say well now here's a
[43:40] good little girl or boy they never sin
[43:43] to begin
[43:47] with but you're born and sin to begin
[43:51] with shaped in
[43:55] iniquity
[43:56] come to the world speaking
[43:59] Lies when you're born in this
[44:01] world you're a
[44:03] liar you're a thief you're
[44:09] everything everything that there is all
[44:13] sin you're not a liar a thief because
[44:16] you
[44:18] stole you're not a liar because you told
[44:20] a
[44:24] lie that spirit that s you when you were
[44:28] born because you're of the
[44:33] world that's the reason you why you
[44:34] can't have
[44:38] Reformation you've got to die and be
[44:40] born
[44:45] again you can't have a birth without
[44:49] crucifixion now I ask this
[44:53] question was Jesus Christ crucified
[44:56] no yes or
[44:57] no you're a little afraid now aren't you
[45:01] answer please yes or
[45:04] no was Jesus Christ
[45:11] crucified when he was crucified did he
[45:13] go smiling to the
[45:15] Cross how did he get to the
[45:18] Cross how was he able to get to the
[45:21] Cross he was God's
[45:24] love but if I understand
[45:26] the
[45:27] Bible he knelt
[45:31] down and he said father let this cup
[45:34] pass for
[45:35] me but not my will but thy will be
[45:41] done he said he started to
[45:44] sweat and his sweat was as great drops
[45:46] of
[45:49] blood it was not an easy
[45:53] thing to make that decision to go to
[45:55] calv
[45:58] because he was going to be
[46:03] crucified when we're speaking about the
[46:06] crucifixion this is the
[46:08] body that must be
[46:13] crucified in order for for for the
[46:19] death in order for the death of the
[46:21] nature of that
[46:23] spirit because what actually controls
[46:25] you
[46:27] it's what's inside
[46:28] you you have to
[46:30] die you have to be
[46:34] crucified and you're not going to want
[46:36] to be crucified because you want only if
[46:38] you hear the
[46:39] gospel you hear understand the plan of
[46:43] and when you do
[46:46] understand you then know that you have
[46:48] to be
[46:51] crucified many people want to be born
[46:53] again but they don't want to be
[46:54] crucified brother B
[47:00] says you need a a crucifixion in order
[47:03] to have a
[47:06] birth you cannot have a new birth except
[47:08] there be a
[47:09] crucifixion
[47:11] where in
[47:13] Christ in
[47:16] Christ so then what starts to form is an
[47:20] angel a
[47:24] messenger the B says that when we're
[47:27] born in the natural birth he says there
[47:30] is a spirit to enter into US say it's an
[47:34] angel and this
[47:36] Angel is going to speak is going going
[47:41] to do the things of the world because
[47:42] he's of the world yes
[47:44] sir but when you're born again the angel
[47:48] comes Jesus Christ inside of you and it
[47:52] starts to
[47:53] form it brings everything under
[47:55] subjection
[47:57] first of all there must be a
[47:59] crucifixion for that angel Jesus Christ
[48:02] to come inside of
[48:03] us Prophet
[48:08] says man when he's born he's got a
[48:10] spirit in
[48:12] him and it's the spirit of that he has
[48:14] in him is of the
[48:16] world it's the spirit of the
[48:22] god you forgive
[48:24] me
[48:28] that's why you can get a pig and you
[48:30] bathe him wash him
[48:31] up to put a little ribbon on that
[48:37] pig but he's going to go to the mud
[48:39] power as soon as he can because that his
[48:41] nature the nature that's in
[48:45] him we've gone down the wrong
[48:48] road we're trying to pick clean up the
[48:52] pig before changing his nature
[48:59] we have to teach men and women that the
[49:00] spirit that they have in them is of the
[49:02] world it's of the
[49:04] devil the spirit that man has that from
[49:07] the smallest baby the spirit that he has
[49:10] is of the
[49:11] devil but God's word says that the blood
[49:14] of Jesus
[49:15] Christ cleanses him until the age of
[49:21] accountability he has to come to a
[49:23] repentance a first step barely
[49:27] that's barely the first step the Second
[49:30] Step along with that of course is to be
[49:33] baptized in water and then
[49:35] what to be before
[49:37] him and saying to him change change my
[49:41] nature change my
[49:44] spirit make me a new creature in Christ
[49:48] Jesus because until we have that change
[49:50] of
[49:51] nature we don't have God in us in US you
[49:56] might have him above us but not in
[49:59] US Prophet
[50:02] says when a man's
[50:06] born he's born with the spirit of the
[50:08] world in
[50:11] him that's the reason why he's got to be
[50:13] born
[50:15] again because this
[50:17] Spirit comes from a
[50:21] conception and he can't live AB no way
[50:24] he can live forever
[50:27] then he's got to be born
[50:29] again every man has to be born
[50:32] again no matter if he's a high priest
[50:35] he's a bishop he's a pope whatever he
[50:41] is he's just as guilty as the next
[50:44] man he has to be born
[50:47] again brother bam
[50:49] says they ask him a question say brother
[50:52] Bram I want all the young children to
[50:54] not this
[51:05] brother bam will all the Sons and
[51:07] Daughters of true Born Again CHR
[51:08] Believers be
[51:15] saved in other words if your parents are
[51:17] true Born Again
[51:18] Christians see that's what makes a man a
[51:21] new
[51:22] person it's because he's born again
[51:32] reborn his first B brings him a natural
[51:35] man of on
[51:40] Earth his second birth brings him a
[51:42] spiritual man of
[51:43] Heaven see it changes
[51:46] him changes his
[51:50] form not his outward
[51:54] conscience
[51:58] not his five outside
[52:01] senses but his inward part
[52:04] his what motivates
[52:07] him has been changed to
[52:15] God why don't you take your Bibles now
[52:17] so we can tie
[52:19] together what the prophet says be in
[52:21] first
[52:23] Corinthians chapter 15
[52:29] Prophet says here that the soul is
[52:35] changed the problem says that it's the
[52:37] soul that's changed how many of you
[52:38] believe that it's the soul that's
[52:41] changed 1 Corinthians
[52:43] 15 verse
[52:48] 47 first man is of the earth
[52:53] earthy the second man man is the Lord
[52:56] From
[52:57] Heaven which is the second
[53:02] man now remember I told you
[53:05] earlier that the birth that
[53:08] was that was performed when it was birth
[53:11] that an angel came and it was the
[53:15] Lord now I want you to notice the first
[53:18] man is is from whom from
[53:21] where is from the
[53:24] Earth second man is from
[53:28] her from heaven from
[53:32] Heaven is the Lord is the
[53:40] Lord when Jesus Christ was
[53:42] born he was born in a
[53:47] manger he came forth from Mary's
[53:51] womb he was God's gift to
[53:54] us
[53:55] how many of you accept that Jesus Christ
[53:57] was God's gift to
[53:59] us have you ever given someone a
[54:04] present what must you do when you buy
[54:06] somebody a
[54:07] present you wrap
[54:10] it that's why they WRA Jesus right
[54:13] away in a swaddling
[54:19] clothing a very cloth that used to clean
[54:22] the sweat off animal that's what the
[54:24] prophet said
[54:28] said that we have a filthy stinking
[54:31] stable yet he wants to come to that
[54:33] table he wants to come to this table he
[54:37] went to that
[54:38] table way he was wrapped up in swalling
[54:41] clothing he wants to come to
[54:43] you but you have to
[54:45] die in order for him to come to
[54:48] you the Bible
[54:53] says as as is the Earthly such are they
[54:56] also that are
[54:59] Earthly and as is the Heavenly such are
[55:01] they also that are
[55:08] Heavenly and as we we have born the
[55:11] image of the Earthly we shall also bear
[55:13] the image of the
[55:16] Heavenly we see then that the first
[55:19] man is of the
[55:21] Earth the second man is from heaven
[55:26] is the
[55:27] Lord when there is a new birth the
[55:30] prophet says like
[55:32] this what starts to
[55:35] form the Lord starts to form in
[55:38] you growing more and more and more more
[55:41] and more the Lord in
[55:44] you he is that
[55:46] angel that he is the
[55:48] messenger that what you
[55:52] speak what he wants you to speak
[55:56] who's the one that brings the messenger
[56:01] message means
[56:03] messenger when a person's been born
[56:06] again you know right away if he been
[56:08] born
[56:11] again because the one that's speaking in
[56:13] him is then the angel Jesus
[56:15] Christ the prophet says there's been a
[56:18] change the soul has to be
[56:22] changed the word parom means what
[56:29] to change from one form to
[56:32] another this will help you so you won't
[56:34] get
[56:37] confused Prophet says it changes him
[56:39] changes his
[56:41] soul it changes his
[56:43] nature changes his
[56:46] desires what what motivates
[56:50] him brother tells
[56:53] me
[56:55] please pray for me or or or teach such
[56:57] and such because he wants to dance he
[57:00] wants to
[57:01] smoke that's what that's what motivates
[57:05] don't worry about
[57:07] it about the smoking and the
[57:10] drinking worry
[57:13] about there can come a change in the
[57:15] heart then the spirit
[57:18] change something else will motivate that
[57:21] man the things of the
[57:23] Lord Prophet
[57:26] says that the word
[57:30] birth means uh New
[57:33] Creation so when you're born
[57:37] again a new creation has come
[57:41] about and youve been born of the new
[57:44] Original
[57:45] Seed not through sex
[57:49] anymore that's why we have two
[57:52] parts even though we have been born
[57:54] again
[57:56] this body that you see right
[57:58] here came through
[58:01] sex but this which is in
[58:03] here did not come through
[58:06] sex and sooner or
[58:08] later I'm of
[58:11] Flesh and I'm going to
[58:15] dress if it be so that I be not found
[58:18] naked I have dressed myself with the
[58:22] word that theop body is that word body
[58:26] if I'm rapping dring the
[58:29] word then there's a body waiting
[58:31] for Dro this robe of
[58:34] flesh but until that day
[58:36] come we're
[58:39] walking two ber two
[58:42] person I can see
[58:44] two
[58:47] two and then we get shook up sometime we
[58:50] don't know
[58:51] this sometimes brother J sticks
[58:53] us
[58:55] he gets a little
[58:57] sticky he said
[59:00] Theon that holy
[59:03] man it's not the inside man
[59:06] that's it's that outside man that's
[59:08] scking
[59:08] you and that won't go
[59:10] away until the
[59:13] resurrection when he stoens up a little
[59:15] it's when the water comes you want
[59:18] water the water comes upon
[59:21] Him above that blessed soul
[59:27] service oh I can see nothing but Angels
[59:30] but if no water comes to him no no water
[59:33] drop on him several days go by without
[59:35] no water it's a little
[59:40] sticky very well the
[59:42] prophet going continue
[59:44] on can you wait for a few more minutes
[59:48] I'm almost
[59:49] done
[59:51] Prophet my
[59:53] Lord
[59:57] I was noing that I had to go
[1:00:01] scures let's go second Corinthians
[1:00:03] chapter
[1:00:04] 5 to confirm what we're speaking right
[1:00:07] now so please
[1:00:11] brother when it's the outside man that
[1:00:13] does
[1:00:15] something don't blame the that's on the
[1:00:18] inside all right if we believe the
[1:00:22] word if it be so that he was born
[1:00:26] again I'm speaking about Born Again
[1:00:29] people I'm not speaking about those that
[1:00:31] had not yet been born again and yet they
[1:00:34] want to cover themselves with
[1:00:35] religion I'm speaking about those that
[1:00:37] have been born
[1:00:38] again second Corinthians
[1:00:43] 517 now if there be any man be any any
[1:00:46] man be in
[1:00:50] Christ When sin entered into what to the
[1:00:54] world
[1:00:56] world when you were
[1:00:59] born there was that what was is of the
[1:01:02] world was waiting for you what did you
[1:01:05] enter
[1:01:06] into what did you enter into into the
[1:01:09] world and that which is
[1:01:13] the and embrace goes kiss and say come
[1:01:16] here H you're mine is that
[1:01:21] right and for years we tried to reform
[1:01:24] and
[1:01:26] you can't reform
[1:01:27] anybody there has to be a
[1:01:30] crucifixion there has to be a
[1:01:32] killing you have to die in order to be
[1:01:35] born again and then when you're born
[1:01:39] again if any man be in
[1:01:41] Christ where in what in Christ
[1:01:47] ah in the heart now this is what Christ
[1:01:50] enters you what controls
[1:01:53] you being
[1:01:55] chist he is a new
[1:01:58] creature all old things are passed
[1:02:03] away behold all things are become
[1:02:06] new how many of you believe this say
[1:02:10] Amen how many of you believe you're real
[1:02:13] good isn't it true that some of us do
[1:02:15] believe that we're real good we make a
[1:02:18] profession confession of
[1:02:20] faith I accept Jesus
[1:02:23] Christ and you cross
[1:02:26] yourself I get baptized I never smoked I
[1:02:30] never drank I never
[1:02:33] [Applause]
[1:02:35] stole I never broke one
[1:02:40] commandment if you want to know it I'm
[1:02:42] just like that Young Rich Young that met
[1:02:44] Jesus I've
[1:02:47] kept all the Lord's commandments you
[1:02:50] forgive
[1:02:51] me that's how a lot of them are told
[1:02:56] me I never I never committ
[1:03:01] adultery now let's follow that thought
[1:03:02] for about 10
[1:03:03] minutes Romans
[1:03:05] [Music]
[1:03:06] 1022 322 of
[1:03:10] [Music]
[1:03:12] Romans even the righteousness of God
[1:03:14] which is by faith of Jesus
[1:03:17] Christ unto all that believe that
[1:03:19] believe for there is no difference no
[1:03:22] Pope even the Bishop even the pastor
[1:03:27] this is for
[1:03:29] whosoever for all have
[1:03:32] sinned and come short of the glory of
[1:03:35] God for all
[1:03:37] have we born in we have all
[1:03:41] sinned first
[1:03:45] john8 if we
[1:03:53] say
[1:03:55] if we say that we have no sin we deceive
[1:03:57] ourselves and the truth is not in
[1:04:06] us if we confess our sins he is faithful
[1:04:09] and just to forgive us our sins and to
[1:04:11] cleanse us from all
[1:04:18] unrighteousness if we say that we have
[1:04:20] not sinned we make him a liar and his
[1:04:22] word is not in US
[1:04:25] now turn with
[1:04:27] us to First John 3
[1:04:32] 39 and you'll see that it looks like it
[1:04:34] contradicts
[1:04:47] itself whosoever is born of God does not
[1:04:50] commit sin for his seed remaineth in him
[1:04:53] and he cannot s because he is born of
[1:04:57] God so which one's right
[1:05:03] then they're both
[1:05:07] right if I understand the
[1:05:10] word I was born of
[1:05:13] God and I do not
[1:05:16] sin I cannot
[1:05:19] sin what is
[1:05:21] sin unbelief God said something I say
[1:05:28] Amen because the seed his seed is in
[1:05:31] me which seed is in
[1:05:33] me what's the subject's
[1:05:37] title The Original
[1:05:40] Seed where is that in my
[1:05:43] mind in the heart is that
[1:05:47] right so then that
[1:05:51] seed was in me me since I was born
[1:05:56] it but there had to be a death
[1:06:01] person in order for that life that was
[1:06:03] in me to brush
[1:06:05] forth so then it was the
[1:06:08] original how can I then
[1:06:10] sin but it says
[1:06:13] here and if anyone say we have not
[1:06:15] sinned we make him a liar because there
[1:06:19] are people that they think they're real
[1:06:23] good
[1:06:25] and they don't come to Lord because they
[1:06:26] shall Never Smoke drank or committed
[1:06:29] adultery but to begin with you were born
[1:06:34] in as soon as you were born you were a
[1:06:36] bunch of
[1:06:38] sin if you say you have
[1:06:40] not you make him a
[1:06:44] liar say you were born in
[1:06:46] sin let's
[1:06:49] look want me to see if I can
[1:06:53] finish
[1:06:54] Prophet says given the
[1:06:56] interpretation what we've
[1:06:59] spoken he said what is
[1:07:02] sin
[1:07:05] unbelief there's only one
[1:07:08] sin and that's
[1:07:12] unbelief he that believeth not is
[1:07:14] condemned
[1:07:16] already and he quing Mark
[1:07:19] 16 go into all the
[1:07:21] world preach the gospel to every
[1:07:23] creature
[1:07:25] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[1:07:28] be saved and he that believeth not is
[1:07:32] condemned already so they don't
[1:07:35] believe that's a person's
[1:07:38] condemnation because if they do
[1:07:40] believe they know that they're born in
[1:07:43] sin they know that they have to be born
[1:07:46] again they know that they have to be
[1:07:48] died to the
[1:07:51] world they know that he knows that the
[1:07:53] spirit that he has in him is of the
[1:07:55] world he knows that the life that he has
[1:07:57] in him is of the
[1:07:59] world he knows that in the
[1:08:03] beginning it was a unbelief that brought
[1:08:05] to the world but he also know that God
[1:08:09] sent his original Jesus Christ to die to
[1:08:14] redeem us to give us an opportunity to
[1:08:18] be born again not through
[1:08:21] sex but through the word
[1:08:24] in order to have a new spirit and where
[1:08:27] is that new spirit going to
[1:08:28] be in the heart he says how is it that
[1:08:32] the Bible
[1:08:33] says he'll give us a new
[1:08:36] heart is he going to give take away this
[1:08:38] heart give us a up
[1:08:42] no the same
[1:08:44] heart but he changes
[1:08:47] trans and God see verse
[1:08:49] four changes the
[1:08:51] nature spirit new
[1:08:55] desire that's a new creature in Christ
[1:08:58] Jesus
[1:09:00] now the prophet
[1:09:04] says giving the interpretation to the
[1:09:06] scripture I just finished
[1:09:08] reading first
[1:09:10] John uh 38 and
[1:09:14] 10 that's Paul that's
[1:09:18] [Music]
[1:09:20] speaking in order for you to understand
[1:09:22] I I'll just explain it to you
[1:09:27] little now he's saying here that in me
[1:09:29] are two
[1:09:30] persons one that wants to do
[1:09:33] good and the other one wants to do
[1:09:40] evil whenever I try to do good there's
[1:09:43] evil they're hindering me isn't that
[1:09:47] tremendous now you're an outside
[1:09:50] man that's controlled by senses
[1:09:54] and there is an inside
[1:09:56] man is controlled that that he's
[1:09:58] controlled by
[1:10:01] faith now Jesus Christ said made a
[1:10:06] statement and when Jesus Christ make the
[1:10:10] statement the inside man says
[1:10:13] amen the outside man he starts to
[1:10:16] reason that's not
[1:10:18] right so
[1:10:20] then just ignore the outside man
[1:10:25] and accept the Inside
[1:10:30] Man now I'm reading on page uh 1148 from
[1:10:33] conduct order and
[1:10:35] Doctrine now that's Paul himself that's
[1:10:39] speaking it says that he was sold into
[1:10:41] the law of slavery of the of the
[1:10:45] world of the flesh we're all been done
[1:10:47] the same
[1:10:49] way that's the reason why we all have
[1:10:52] have all kinds of sin
[1:10:54] adultery and all kinds of things in our
[1:10:56] life all of these
[1:10:59] things because we are
[1:11:02] carals that part must
[1:11:04] perish but then inside we are a
[1:11:08] spirit Soul
[1:11:11] inside that's faith in God's
[1:11:17] word then we bring our outside body
[1:11:19] under subjection to the word by
[1:11:22] faith
[1:11:26] how can I take a cocko bir and make a
[1:11:27] grain of wheat out of
[1:11:28] it it's impossible for me to do it the
[1:11:32] only way it can be
[1:11:34] done is because it's on the inside of
[1:11:36] the cockle
[1:11:39] bur in other words from that
[1:11:42] Cocker a
[1:11:49] wheat in other words a germ called the
[1:11:52] wheat of life
[1:11:56] then you bury that
[1:11:58] Cocker and it will produce a grain of
[1:12:03] wheat that's why Paul said I am
[1:12:05] crucified together with Jesus
[1:12:09] Christ you have to keep that cocko bird
[1:12:15] buried so that that life of God
[1:12:19] tweet because if it be that
[1:12:22] way
[1:12:27] see a grain of wheat has been placed
[1:12:28] inside that
[1:12:30] Cocker and the
[1:12:34] life and the life the spirit of that
[1:12:37] Cocker has been cast
[1:12:39] out when I was born I was born in
[1:12:44] sin on the outside and on the
[1:12:48] inside but one day I understood that I
[1:12:50] was a
[1:12:52] sinner Ood that I was born in
[1:12:56] sin I understood that I did not come the
[1:12:58] original
[1:13:03] way I understood that sin entered into
[1:13:05] the world because of Adam's
[1:13:07] unbelief when I understood that I
[1:13:10] surrendered myself to him and I died
[1:13:13] when I
[1:13:14] died then there was a new birth and what
[1:13:18] is it
[1:13:19] then it's a bird walking through
[1:13:21] the Earth
[1:13:24] but it's not the life of a
[1:13:28] it's the life of a wheat living
[1:13:32] inside let me go and let me finish it
[1:13:36] now how can I take a cocko b and make a
[1:13:40] grain of wheed out of
[1:13:43] it it's impossible for me to do
[1:13:46] it see there's a life inside that cocko
[1:13:51] in in order for me to convert it
[1:13:55] to change it I have to take the life of
[1:13:57] the co
[1:14:00] away when we born we have the spirit of
[1:14:03] the
[1:14:04] world how can I change the life in me is
[1:14:08] not the
[1:14:11] world I take that life out the
[1:14:14] world put a new
[1:14:17] life put Jesus Christ inside of
[1:14:20] me is him living
[1:14:24] see you see a CO
[1:14:26] outside you see a man who can get
[1:14:29] sick I can
[1:14:39] get if you put a a
[1:14:43] germ called qu of
[1:14:47] life then you bury that coo
[1:14:49] bir some day they might kill me and
[1:14:52] they'll bury a
[1:14:54] CO but when they that
[1:14:57] Co has G
[1:14:59] out my mind is not
[1:15:05] my
