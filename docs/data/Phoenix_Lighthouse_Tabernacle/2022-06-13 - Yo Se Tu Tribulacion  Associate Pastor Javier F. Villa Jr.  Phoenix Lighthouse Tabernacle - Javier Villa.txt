thanking the lord because today his grace has not left us our pastor for his i'm going to be honest with you character is not a gift it is a victory when hope it will be of help to all of us we also hope that it may be a blessing for all that are able to listen and hear a little bit of the word [Music] in this journey that we find ourselves in and if we bring something simple here that we take out it's not death because when here we're not going to say it there if we're here we're egoistic we'll be there the same way because we weren't able to change but if here we were honest to serve you all the days of their life as we walk in this journey father we know that has not been easy but father you strengthen and help us and for you is the honor and glory because we realize that your grace has not left us you've always been with us from the moment we began to breathe and father we know that everything that we've gone through has been with a purpose father thank you we ask you help us will we speak your words help your people [Music] [Music] we're going to bring in to bring a small is and i know thy works in tribulations and poverty but thou art rich and i know the blasphemy of them which say they are jews and are not but are the synagogue of satan i know thy works and tribulation now i want you to understand that a little bit the one that's speaking here is the lord he's telling this church this this age it's under generation i know that works in tribulation if you notice in every age there's been tribulations in and in every age there's been more and more trials and tribulations the trials intensify and every time says you've experimented multiply everything came against me how many does that happen gloria for five six seven wow i enjoyed that but when the lord reaches us the second he reaches us in making the turn then we're going against the current that's but it says but call to remembrance the former days in other words remember don't remember the days past don't forget the days passed in which despoja versus after ye were illuminated after you were eliminated by the gospel after this is what the word says there's so much pressure that they begin to see the problems the first thing they think you know i don't know what i did [Music] filled with problems they exposed he became companions of them that you had compassion of me and my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and enduring substance and since then the spoiling of your goods fries oh that church is filled with nothing but problems knowing in yourselves that ye have a heaven a better and enduring substance the scripture continues here the word encourages us cast not away therefore your confidence which has great recumbence of reward for ye have need of patience that after ye have done the will of god ye might receive the promise in other words be perseverant don't lose your confidence you're trying to you have a reward oh this was necessary oh that is essential patients that we're creating in the trial we are doing the will of god so obtain the promise that's what the word of god the key is in tribulation the chief shepherd of the flock he is there walking amongst them and he notices that his people are in tribulation you know he is not um and that is a reason evil is present what am i doing bad everything is buena my intentions are good i want to do what's good but i'm not able to do it what's happening is the people of israel also thought the same way miramano look brother malachi chapter 1 here's how is the claiming proclaiming to god the people of israel the burden of the word of the lord to israel by malachi i have loved you saith the lord this is what the people of israel were claiming but this is a stumbling block for many people well i believe that the lord is not amen the lord is love mercy amen he is a god that is rich in mercy for the wrath and amen comes for the mercy amen [Music] [Music] struggling by the lord something bad happens to you abe can get closer to god he's not right with god that's because he doesn't correct himself he just doesn't understand sometimes that's how we think but god knows best persona but that person is that's the way that the lord works while we've suffered for a little time in suffering it goes making us perfect it establishes us will strengthen us will make us firm the roots get deeper and deeper there was no wind there would be no deep roots a small wind would come in knock it over oh this poor person there may come a dog the problem and he learned obedience through what he suffered he actually was made perfect by the things that he suffered that's why the scripture says in hebrews 5 8. speaking the lord jesus christ though he were a son how many are your sons here glory to god obedience by the things which he suffered you're telling me that the lord jesus christ learned obedience amen how do you learn it from what he went through oh he had it real easy no sir he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him lord jesus christ he had to go through all his suffering to learn obedience i like what it says here in an exposition of the seven church ages in plain language the very character of jesus where perfection was perfected by suffering jesus the character of jesus was perfected by suffering is a measure of suffering is description below it's a very difficult scripture it's very difficult we're going to read about it call it all joy when you fall into diverse temptations i'm going to read it again i don't know if you understood it hermanos this is my brethren count it all joy versus and he stays on the sidelines heirs of god and joint heirs with christ yeah and if we're going to be joint heirs with christ we have to suffer with him so with him that way you may also glorify together how many of you want to reign with the lord i are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us it's just a little suffering because the you continue on that doesn't knock you over victoria it is a victory so we don't suffer with him and we will not be able to reign with him we have to suffer to be able to ring see what the message says in exposition think it not strange concerning that the fiery trials that are to try you that is what peter said is it strange that god wants us to develop a christ-like character that comes through suffering he asked the question he says no sir we all have trials we are all tried and chastened as sons this is beautiful because it's all helping us to form a character what we're going through it's just a temporary suffering amen amen and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him these scriptures are not mentioned but they have so much truth to them is he chastised is he whom the father chastises not discipline but if you be without chestnut participants whereof all are partakers and says are not legitimate children jesus he's referring to the character of the lord the lord is looking for character in the individual they'll be able to walk this path and long years ago before they had the smelters they used to take the gold and how they would know how it was right or not and all the sludges pirates all that fool's gold all the fool was out of it they his reflection [Music] and when is reflected in your life and looking straight to calvary [Music] because fiery trials sickness persecutions and persecutions it's only done to tests to get out to get the dirt out to get the you will not escape the blessing of god that is not the curse it's a blessing it is difficult to understand the lord tells [Music] [Music] you can identify with them [Music] [Music] i don't know for the love and [Music] [Music] whatever may [Music] [Music] no one noticed crying out to god do not let me go over your head because you know it's the only place you can go to refuge the hand of god [Music] where you find yourself [Music] [Music] this type of message [Music] because [Music] [Music] [Music] of everything [Music] help us to grow [Music] that you want us in the pla and where you've placed us it's been your grace with luxuries the christmas our lord jesus christ here with your people consider their petitions we give you the honor and the glory because only you are worthy of it this morning [Music] we want to tell you [Music] [Music] [Music] we say [Music] no of your amen amen [Music] oh senora [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] yes [Music] is
