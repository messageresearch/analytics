TRANSCRIPT
========================================
didn't there wasn't nothing but himself he was self-existence nothing else existed but God but being that he was God then there must be something to worship him because he loved worship and his own being created creatures to worship Him Now temporarily let's hit it again temporarily now we won't go through the whole thing but you get it on the tapes but then because that he was God he made angels and Angels worshiped him angs still worship Him amen while the angels are stand in the presence of God has six sets of wings six wings they car two over their face two over their feet and fly with in his presence crying day and night holy holy holy Lord God Almighty that's what the scripture said they worshiped him now that created something to worship him that is inside of him was an attribute of Savior how could one of those creatures when there was no sin or no thoughts of sin how one them be lost it couldn't be so there had to be something made could be lost so that he could be a savior inside of him a Healer do you believe he's a savior you believe he's a Healer but what if there wasn't nothing to save or heal see there had to be something made that way so he never made it that way but he put man on freeo agency if you take this you live if you take that you die and every man that comes into the world is still set for the same thing God by his for knowledge knew who would and who would not if God being the question was asked yesterday by a theologian to me that's been tending the meetings you're hearing the tapes said one question he said then is God om then he said he can be everywhere I said he is not omin in the way that the word speaks omin present he cannot be a being and then be an ominent present if he's omnes why would you pray for the Holy Spirit he's on the present he feels every crack Corner crevice every cell fiber everything else there is why did he hunt for Moses if he's Arin present at the end for why did he run up down the Garden of Eden crying Adam Adam where th he's omn because he's omn Mission he knows everything because because he's infinite being infinite makes him omin pres being then being infin then he sets in the heavens he abides in a place because he is a being but being infinite then he knows all things knowing every time that BS it know every bumblebee where he goes into the cone to get his honey he knows every thats in the he knows every thought that's in your mind because he is infinite Anin that is he not only is he infinite he's ominent Mission he knows everything but he is a being God is a being and out of this being begin to bring forth and sin I said the other night Sin is not a creation there is nothing created but Perfection God created all things good sin is not a creation said well that's a very creation sin you've heard that but that's an error sin there's only one Creator that's God God could not create sin because he holy and there's nothing to make it sin is perversion not creation but it's perversion an adultery is the righteous act perverted a lie is the truth wrong any any sin is righteousness perverted therefore now God sets he's already manifested himself he's God he's already manifested himself as a savior man was lost and he saved him he's already manifested himself as a Healer there's L people say he is and he is anyhow just the same he's a Healer he's a savior he's God he's Eternal and he has a purpose and his purpose was in the beginning to make creatures that would love him and worship him and he made creatures and creatures fell and then God by his infancy looked down through the stream of time and saw every man that would be saved amen every man he knew it by by knowledge therefore if he by for knowledge knew who would be saved and who would not be saved he could predestinate amen so the word's not such a bad word after all isn't he could predestinate because he knew who would and who would not therefore in order to catch those who would he had to make a a propitiation for their sins oh if we can we only to get to it just a few verses below he predestinated us to eternal life knowing at those you would lay aside everything and no matter how indifferent it would look towards the children of the world it wouldn't mean one thing to them because they were children of God and he called them and He sent Jesus that his blood might be an atonement blood at a propitiation are a exceptions are a cleansing a cing process toly not just one time and one Revival but ever living making intercessions that the Christian is kept clean day and night amen there is a blood of Jesus Christ that makes an exception on the cross there in the presence of God that cleanses us constantly day and night from all sins and and we are safely tued in tued in by the Holy Spirit into the body of the Lord Jesus and [Music] save he he my words and believeth on him had sent me has everlasting life and shall never come into the Judgment but has passed from Death unto life no more judgment the Christian never goes to the Judgment Christ went for him my attorney stood in my place he pleaded my case and I was ignorant he told the father that I wasn't worthy I was me and he took my place and pleaded my case and today I'm free yes and he shed his blood offer there for our [Music] sins remember last Wednesday night no Christian Christian sins but a sinner cannot a sinner doesn't sin because he's a sinner he's just a sinner to begin with and that's all here take the the back of this book it's black how much of that is black it's all black did just know white to it's black you said this much here it's the whole thing's black it's all black that's way a is he just condemned to start with well he say what about if he commits adulter what if Hees woman what what what if he shoot somebody that's not of our business that's not of our business we got laws down here take care of that we're not ref s we're preachers of the Gospel we don't condemn him for what he done we don't condemn him for committing adultery we condemn him because he's a sinner a Christian he wouldn't do it that's right cor if he's been changed he won't do that but because he is a sinner that's what makes him do that that's what knocks the props out under legalist yes sir brother let me tell you it's not by works but by grace are we saved and not by faith don't condemn legalist they're my brother they'll be there just the same as the rest of them will be there cause God's for our D his church to be there but just the thing you keep the people so tore up they don't know what today well maybe if [Music] I just let them know long as they got to hunger the world are not there to begin with I don't live true to my life because I think she divorce me I live true to my wife because I love her it's a legal position that we have taken that we love one another first before it could be there it had to be a love I love her although I believe if I done something wrong she'd forgive me still I wouldn't do it anyhow I love her that's way it is with Christ if I if I live uh I'm 50 if I live to be a 90 or 100 have another 50 years to preach and I never preach a time to go down sit on the river I'm saved anyhow God saved me by his grace UNM of anything I ever couldn't do did do or anything else I preach because I love him and I love his people that's reason I know I pass some death into life because I love them what kind of condition they're in I go after anyhow get them if ministers disagree and others disagree and denominations disagree that don't stop me there something it didn't stop him he come right in the midst of unbelief and he didn't stop and he move got on anyhow that's what we do go out and get them catch them any no matter reach grab hold on with all your you don't know who they are save them that's because of love not because that I have to but because I love because you love say I already to go make that right with that woman but I tell you right now I guess because I go to church I already to go make it right no you're the one order to get right first no you ain't got the love of God in your heart something makes you know that you're wrong then you go then you go make it right with God then you make it right with your neighbor Jesus taught the same thing you say if you come to an alar and there's a remember there's an art against the neighbor the brother go make it right with him first now now in the ages that has to come we had Wednesday night the manifestation we catch it again this morning in

this morning I play myself in your hands place my interpret in your hands father you may give us the advice which we need we thank you at this time in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen and amen God bless each one of you before anything let us open up the word contining with the same topic which our pastor established this year we're going to the base scripture which is Genesis [Music] 1:1 Genesis 1 I'm giving you some time so you can look for it and the word of God reads thus in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth [Music] and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was [Music] light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night in the evening and the morning were the first [Music] day now be so kind we'll be reading the scripture in Isaiah [Music] 55 we're going for to verse eight it's also a very beautiful scripture Isaiah 558 reads the following way for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayth the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your [Music] thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and return it not thither but WTH the Earth and make it bring forth and Bud that it may give seed to the sour and the bread so to and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing where to I sent it may God bless the reading of his word so kind of as you sit down please greet your smile give him a great big smile exercise your face muscles let the hormone and the chemicals of Happiness bring forth through your [Music] face brother right now I'm not really in the mood I don't want to smile that's when you should make an effort even more to make the effort to allow that God through the perfect body with he created he can manifest what God is inside of us amen amen thank God for the opportunity G us to be here this morning I'd like to thank our pastor for the opportunity his trust which he gives us to be able to express a little bit of what's in our heart I always say and I always mention it let us always be praying for our pastor time I'm behind I repeat it because something that's very important that us as members of this church always supporting our pastor in prayer brother Bram always said if somebody needs prayer it is me so let us always be grateful with God for having the pastor that we have and always uplifting him in prayer so wherever that he may be wher he goes he begins to preach the go May the Holy Spirit come down and fulfill the purpose that he has for the people wherever he goes so we always have to be praying for our pastor [Music] amen and let's continue with the topic that the spoken word is the Original [Music] Seed it's a very beautiful and extensive topic can be taken from different angles now there's been several brothers who have expressed their thoughts on this topic they have been expressing what God has given them and I think we have received a great blessing they have done it in quite a Mastery way being a blessing for each one of us but the word tell us that we're not only to be listeners but doers but there is where the key we can take the word that's been spoken unto us and not just take it as a message that our brother spoke onto us and he spoke it well we liked what he spoke on that's something that the word tells us is sweet it's sweet in our palet mouth but the scripture is not fulfilled un which we move forward with the rest when it starts to make your belly big that's when that sweet word which we heard we have to put it into action and that's where it causes bitterness and that's where we don't like it that's where it hurts Isaiah 55 my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways so then we go to Genesis one in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth God was expressing his thoughts when he began the creative process that he had in the beginning God created the be there was a word to express them his thoughts you can't unless you speak so godess it's the spoken word the spoken word being the great eloh self exist the self-existing one who takes up all space had within him all of these that's why Isaiah told us my thoughts are higher be compared to but God in his Desir for God thought to be able to bepress and understood they could be reveal could leave his thoughts nobody have ACC in order to that so he began to unravel he began to unravel himself and he began to develop his plan that's why in the beginning created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and and the Darkness was upon the face of and the spirit of God was moving what is it that the spirit of God was doing it began to move the space which it belonged to him he began to speak the vision that he had in his but in order to be able to speak he had to come down because God as Elohim he was invisible of God had to come forth which word the anointed the the son he was the one who began topress what was God's plan God's thoughts and through the word the thoughts Express and then the thoughts have to be materialized so then God when he began to he saw the condition of he begin to analyze the situation first analyzed the condition which the Earth and when he analyzed said the Earth is without form and void so then comes the Revelation the prophet messenger comes and speaks to us and he says that God he was moving he says as something flying like perhaps a hen how it lies down to have the correct atmosphere so that the sea that can come to manifestation when it has those hatchlings that are still in their sh it begins to um that through the process they can come to manifestation and so the prophet says that God was doing the he was analyzing the situation he saw the Earth was without form and void he saw that there was Darkness but under that Darkness under that there was a SE so him he began to analyze and he saw that that seed had value he analyed the situation he saw the situation which the SE found himself so then now he began to analyze the value of the seat so he loved the seat so much he began to move upon the face of to create the correct atmosphere when the word was spoken it would create the it would bring to manifest the seed of God that was the analysis that God made that there was seed the condition which the seed found itself in then he saw the value of the seed the seed has value it has so much value just the way as a bird stays in its nest it could be raining Thunder it could be windy it could be the storm but that bird will not move for because there's a love relationship creating the appropriate atmosphere those can come into manifestation if that bird doesn't create the atmosphere that seed can't come forth it loves that seed that bird loves the SE so that the storms don't situation it's going to stay there the seed comes to manifestation until those hatchlings can come out of their shell the plan that was he was analy the situation situation of the atmosphere analing the value of the he said I stay here I'm going to move upon the I'm going to create the correct atmosphere because I love what I it's a love relationship I love what I'm seeing I'm going to express spoken word going to finish with the I'm going to get rid of get through my word will become materialized and that's the process that God says my thoughts areer focuses on when we're looking at Genesis we read the word we say the Earth was without there was Darkness but when God SE that he's looking at the sea looking at the circumstan he's looking at a sea that has the power within to begin to reproduce it has a system it has a system Force according to it be an atmosphere created an appropriate atmosphere so that I can be born so the thoughts of God the ways of God they are higher and you can't walk higher than your thoughts and you can't think higher than what God has expressed you can't think higher of what you speak and you can't speak higher than that what you think and you can't walk and higher than what you think or what you your confession limit the spiritual condition in which you find yourself your thoughts they limit you to live in a certain atmosphere my thoughts are not your thoughts because our thoughts lead us to have a certain perception a way of looking at a way of understanding when Lord Jesus Christ spoke with Nicodemus he says is you must be born again you must be born again Nicodemus could not understand the revelation of the thoughts of God for the age in which he lived because God's thoughts are higher than the thoughts of any human being but God in his plan he desired to unravel so that you could enter into God's program in God's plan could have access to the hidden thoughts of God because God hid them INR he was the anointed one he was the the thoughts of God were hidden inside they couldn't be revealed until a certain time when they were expressed so then us we have to understand the way God did things how he did it because that's an example for us when in a situation a situation which we find we have to find the value not look at the at the value inside of the circum because in that disorder in that voice below them is the seed the seed has a value so then Christ unraveling God's plan that's why the prophet said Christ is the thoughts of God in Christ in the heart of they have to be spoken reation contact with and the hidden Mystery can and be revealed in our lives but that happens while the Earth is without form that's where the process the developing of God's thoughts where we have to enter in the presence of God to be able to activate his power activate the power that's inside of us understand and analyze the sit and see the value that God is seing at the problem the ill because God is not looking at that God's not seeing of the sea that's behind there's value in that se because God like our thoughts they're higher so then God he began to unravel his plan the messenger says in the message of the sman age the Eternal thoughts of God allow me to ask you are God's thoughts Eternal are they eternal if you can see this then you will understand many things God is uncountable so much in his Essence as in his Mo God is infinite in his abilities for so he has to be omnicient if he is omnicient then he is not learning neither is he taking advice from anyone and he knows the beginning just like the end because he is God for God's thoughts are Eternal they are real they're not like the thoughts of man we can go out throughout the ages we see we findes find Jeremiah find John the Baptist each one of them they were the thought of God expressed in their time those prophets were the thought of God expressed at a certain that existed in their it was limited by the word that had been through God's mouthpiece at that time Moses spoke he brought a revelation he brought Deliverance he took them to a land he was guiding them the promise that was the time for of the people of Revelation came for that time the of God's thoughts to the people it was the time for Del didn't matter it didn't matter how powerful the country how powerful that Nation how great their army was God had already prepar a man he would come to express God's thoughts those spoken word you bring the deliver it was the revelation began to speak them his thoughts God once again analiz the situation of the people had reached his pres matter how strong H was the value of the presence of God sent him a deliverer an Escape Route once again analyed the Earth was without people of God were they were in dark heart were uh being enslaved was killing their Spirit but God was watching he was see the value in the midst of that chaos so then spoke the word man what had been promised for that time when they were in anguish when the people were trapped when the sea was in front of army was behind there was but there God brought his plan he toldes say why cry unto speak speak so that these people can cross and again the god thoughts of God God opened a way that the seed was valuable wasable it had value the ensl had Bound for come down to deliver people and he sent Moses so the prophet say in the age of Smyrna so then we get to Jesus the logus he was the complete thought expressed Jesus he was the perfect thought expressed and he was known as the word he was the Jesus Christ The Original Seed he was the promised he the one that all the prophets had seen God himself brother Bram says so now we're reaching in this conclusion how theog the word god Eternal was manifested in his son J Christ dwelt all the planet all the fullness the Eternal being the father manifested in flesh now it was God coming down once again not only did he want to express part of what he he wanted to express all of his thoughts this was a love relationship God wanted to manifest his love to be able to display that promise to the SE that he loved so he came to manifest himself in flesh according to his plan according to his plan the Lamb of God had to come because we were lost we were far away from God so then throughout time the Lord Jesus Christ came to it was the time the greatest manifestation in history God himself came down the perfect thought the anointed one God made now he was expressing God's because it was God himself in flesh in a fellowship it was no longer a Divine Fellowship now he came to bring theh to a fellowship in flesh to be able to unite the Earth with heaven to be able to unite flesh with to be open way there no longer one one have access but through death of the Original Seed who would die and come to land but it would bring many fruits the only begotten Son of God come to be sacrif to be crucified and as he he would he would resurrect after Resurrection he would disperse in the SE the seed which he was looking for because the son of come and save that which now would be shared even though it be dis it would not lose it not lose it way or now the power be shared among many members now that power that Spirit to bring the members to form the body of Christ body formed by many baptized by The Same Spirit so then God was manif but our thoughts not like the thoughts of God that is why when he was on Earth he began to develop began to show the way he thought the message the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride now this little woman her life up here she was a prostitute she was all marred up but way down in her here was just a little bit of understanding I know when Messiah cometh that was there but this little woman had nothing to present she was as filthy and dirty as she could be but notice way down in her she got represent and once again perf thoughts of God walking on the face of he was analyzing the situation he saw this woman he made before the foundation of the earth he had to be there at a certain time time to have an appointment with something which people despised people saw the flesh people saw a young lady who wasil nothing to present but once again God Made Who was in the beginning now he was manifesting he began to analyze the situation he began to analyze and he saw a young lady of ill Fame he saw a lady who was lost but inside of that woman there was representation of what Jesus saw was the value of the seed you look at the condition at the value of the seed the value of the seed he saw that there was crying within her and he began to discern the spirit of that woman that woman when she presents herself with Jesus she was 18 years old she 18 years old that's what the prophet says imagine a young lady in that condition when Jesus begins to speak with her she felt judged because what she received from everyone else she couldn't go with to bring she had to go at the hottest time of the day when no one wanted to go her heart the desire to be able to satisfy that that insatable with nothing could fill she look one way or another had many hus her husband but inside of her she had a small bit of understanding that when the Messiah cometh her life would be restored her thirst would be quenched and Jesus once again the God made analyzed the situation he didn't care about the he began to speak the word speaks the word the Eternal seed which was in the midst of that disorder the prophet says and she was looking for this to be made flesh and when he said she said sir you're not be El I perceive you are a prophet now we know the Messiah which is called thought Christ will come and when he does he'll do this he said I am he said I am he he spoke the word then all of the heavens the power of the universe happened in the ages in the word that he had spoken and all that power hit and that that seed began to come to life I am great powerful conqueror general of the army one has spoken throughout the ages manifested in different ways the Eternal God made flesh looking and saving that which had been lost he made contact with the seed The Great I Am the spoken word recognition of who she was give value to the he didn't look at the condition at the value of that seed she didn't have doubt she didn't have to explain it she saw it and she believed it and she left why what did it do to her it redeemed her now watch he came to be a redeemer what does redeem mean bring back so then he was fulfilling the plan his thoughts which he had had from the beginning of the world to fulfill it at that moment that appointment that he had Young T The Thirst she had in her heart and so then she he began to unravel what he was he was a redeemer so the process of redemption to unravel he spoke the word and he said I am he who the scripture has spoken of he came to redeem which had fallen in the fall this had messed up with that girl but God had her in his thinking before the foundation of the world God had her in his thinking so then if God's thoughts are Eternal she was in the thoughts of God so then she had eternal life so that's why God didn't care and he finds the value the condition will not limit his thoughts are Eternal thoughts do not have limits when he speaks the word his thoughts are expressed they have to come to materialize but that's why his plan he hat his thoughts in Christ and reveal them not just to one but to a body body of the Lord Jesus Christ each one position but all one in when Christ speaks he expresses his thoughts but he changes mask he changes mask over here Chang over here he speak else heess his thoughts over here and saving that which had been lost now he does it through Christ through Christ manifested in another age he came to cleanse her then he KN he she he had eternal life he know he had eternal life she understood that she had etal life but to understand that she had eternal life contact with the word with the with Christ with Christ the word the prophet in that same message it says a Son of God can go on for much time without recognizing that he is a son now let me say it again a son of of God can go on for a long time without recognizing that he is a son and once that a true Son of God hears the Cry of through the word you will realize sooner or later who he is when the Holy Spirit begins to cry out to express the word sooner or later that son in dark in the dis he will hear the word word of his God speaking when he sees the mask will be Christ once again his wording his thoughts again saving that which had been lost but now a body through those understood their position taken the responsibility manifest the glory of God I will speak the word because to be in Christ I have to be baptized in the same body we have one Faith one Lord one baptism and that takes us to be in line CHR and with the with the ano and when Christ speaks when you speak God expressing his thoughts but the enemy wants to devalue the value of the seed so then God he begins to reveal to us his mystery and he tells us in in Colossians 126 the musicians can come forward where of I made a minister according to dispensation of God this is Paul talking to the Colossians Accord of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God even the mystery which had been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints whom God would make known that is the riches of his glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of Glory a people who weren't a people who weren't a [Music] people Paul says in Romans 9 that he'll call his people who is not my people and her Beloved the not beloved I will call people who had no hope people that was given to the idol they were away from God Paul understands the calling of God in his Christ the word he has an experience he has an experience that took away all of his thought and now God could pour His thought Christ once again and he hides them in Paul he begins to speak the mystery now the Gentiles they had the same right to hear the gospel that were not beloved people that were not a people people that had no God would raise a beloved said he would say you are don't devalue who you are do matter condition what you find yourself in don't look don't look at your condition look at the value that you have what is worth more the blood the blood that he shed or what the Blood Bought what has more value his blood for us because he analyzed our situation and he said I will not forsake them I will not leave them in that condition I will not leave them lost I will not forsake them I will not leave them enslaved I will give my life I will shed my blood for the pardon of sin for the Redemption to bring healing to bring Deliverance because I am analyzing seeing the value of the seed the value that you have he saw it the seventh age he saw the age of L and he said he said I will send once again to Christ the word The Original Seed begin to speak my word and when I speak my words it will reveal my thoughts in that inside of Christ will have access to my to the hidden Mystery throughout the time you can live as high as your thoughts in your thoughts are the thoughts of God so then your thoughts are Eternal so then you have you have access to Eternity when you enter eternity you take the hand of Fai you enter into another dimension you begin to pull that which you need because my thoughts not your thoughts says the Lord throughout the message of the hour access to the thoughts of God now if I speak the word and it's no longer me speaking made flesh speaking and expressing the thoughts of God to bring order where there is disorder to bring life to bring hope where everything is dried up to bring pardon to bring Deliverance to bring the redemp BR the restoration who has to speak the word Christ made flesh once [Music] again please stand [Music] says Deuteronomy 329 for the Lord's portion is his people it's a relationship of God loves us so much each time that he expressed his love in the Old Testament it was a story of love with a gentile talking about the plan that would come in the future that he would make of a people someone who was not beloved he would make him his beloved he saw the value of the seed he saw the value that you have please don't tell me that you're worthless don't tell me that you have no value don't look at your circumstances the representation that is inside of you why J Christ paid the price he analyzes your situation you're in a problem it's an opportunity the glory of God speak the word manifestation the promise of God for this time and for your [Music] life the enemy tries to devalue us he tries to buy us by telling God telling Lord Jesus Christ that we have no value but Jesus answers unto him they are not for sale they have been redeemed but you don't see how they fail I love them you don't see their condition they're not for they're my children they're mine they were in the lowest and the filthiest I paid the price for them and when they can understand the value of the price that I paid for them when that Revelation reaches them they will free them from the condition which they have experienced then they they will understand the value of their soul they will understand that before my eyes they have no price they Priceless there's nothing that can buy them because I bought them for myself that's a love [Music] relationship all we have we just have to understand the value that we have inside of us don't look at the condition don't look at the circumstances act as God acts analyze the situation then look at the value of the seed look at the price that was paid for that seed and everything that was done for that seed so when you see everything that's been done you will begin to understand that it was done for you you it was done for you and when the Revelation strikes you understand he gave his life for me he opened up a way for me to understand the value that you have you understand the seed has value and God is listening to The Cry of each se you have to cry out because when the seed cries out God comes and enters into the scene bow your heads please we give you thanks Lord Jesus to understand that we have the the value we have before th eyes don't let us analyze our situation help us anal representation

your people begin to cry out because you begin to lift them up to a higher level you can reveal your thoughts you begin to place your thoughts in their heart and your thoughts are Eternal when we enter into eternity there is no limits we can speak the word and would materialize thank you Lord the cross at calv thank you opening up a way for us now help us to understand ration of the message of
