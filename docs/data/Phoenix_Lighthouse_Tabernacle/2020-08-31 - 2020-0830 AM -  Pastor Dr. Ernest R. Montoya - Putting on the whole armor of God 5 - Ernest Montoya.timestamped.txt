[23:43] god bless you this morning it's always
[23:47] a pleasure and an honor
[23:55] it's an honor and a pleasure to come
[23:58] and serve the lord jesus christ
[24:16] surrender
[24:44] he's still
[24:54] [Music]
[25:10] i have nothing against
[25:54] and
[26:09] because he was hollering many times
[26:12] right i want people to see what he was
[26:15] trying to say
[26:17] and then i heard a great man an apostle
[26:22] and i heard a person say a commentary
[26:30] and he said you're listening to the guy
[26:34] that likes to holler a lot
[26:46] but it was the technology that we had in
[26:49] that time period
[27:04] fill more church an iglesia del fillmore
[27:07] was a high
[27:08] type two-story building
[27:12] very small
[27:16] the acoustics
[27:30] we had just so you'll know
[27:34] was a little cassette how many remember
[27:35] those little portable cassette players
[27:40] put one in here
[27:46] he would actually sit in the back in
[27:48] this little room back here
[27:51] and he would be recording brother bernie
[27:54] what brother bernie said here
[27:59] back there i can barely
[28:12] but if you speak with brother bernie
[28:23] so i just wanted to share that with you
[28:27] nothing against anyone
[28:39] [Music]
[28:55] it's happening so fast
[28:59] we don't have time kids don't have time
[29:01] to blink
[29:04] because then their families are
[29:06] separating
[29:09] and this is why i'm bringing what i'm
[29:11] bringing
[29:13] is because of what is happening in this
[29:15] world
[29:16] today
[29:20] now if you'll turn with me to ephesians
[29:22] 6 11 we're going to read the scripture
[29:24] if you'll stand with me
[29:28] we're going to pray
[29:34] ephesians 6 11.
[29:38] it reads as follows
[29:50] if you'll hit the first slide please
[29:54] put on the whole armor of god that ye
[29:56] may be able to
[29:57] withstand against the wiles of the devil
[30:06] diablo
[30:08] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[30:09] blood but against principalities
[30:12] against powers against rulers of
[30:14] darkness of this world
[30:16] against spiritual wickedness in high
[30:18] places
[30:31] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[30:34] of god
[30:35] that ye may be able to withstand in the
[30:37] evil day
[30:38] and having done all to stand
[30:46] firm heavenly father
[30:50] we know we're living in the civil age
[30:55] a time where there's ambushes

[31:56] soldiers that are not recruits anymore

[32:08] a soldier needs to be trained
[32:11] and how many of us have been trained

[40:26] for the lord jesus christ
[40:30] but here he said i haven't done
[40:34] anything something
[40:50] yes
[40:52] how many of us have been commissioned as
[40:54] soldiers
[40:57] you see i look at like this young man
[41:00] he has a future in the ministry
[41:05] i see many young men
[41:09] with the same caliber
[41:13] that they've been called by god
[41:17] but what needs to happen
[41:32] what
[41:47] and that's sometimes what we don't
[41:48] understand yeah
[41:50] you might have called us just to
[41:54] thank the brother for something
[41:58] if he has something in store for you
[42:43] yeah well i played a saxophone
[42:46] saxophone trombone
[42:54] um i think that's it
[42:58] the violin
[43:02] now let me tell you something you know
[43:05] how they say
[43:06] you ride a bicycle once and you never
[43:08] forget
[43:09] that's a lot he said
[43:37] yes or no
[43:42] look
[43:45] we talked last week on attacks
[43:49] how message
[43:52] believers for whatever reason
[43:56] we'll go on a web page and start looking
[44:01] at what has been said against our
[44:03] prophets
[44:18] and i like to read that stuff i don't
[44:20] know why
[44:33] when people look in into these web pages
[44:39] and before you know it you're doing
[44:42] something you normally wouldn't do
[44:45] no we failed to understand that the
[44:48] greatest
[45:02] holy spirit
[45:16] correct
[45:28] so do me a favor
[45:41] so i tell you like this tell us why they
[45:43] say that just pray
[45:44] solo wouldn't
[45:56] in these type of web pages
[46:00] internet now was brother branham ever

[46:15] no so it wasn't the first time
[46:20] his own friends his own colleagues
[46:28] would come up to him oh my brother
[46:31] branham
[46:32] my brother
[46:36] but he would call him my brother
[46:40] my friend my amigo
[46:44] this is the way brother branham was i've
[46:45] seen it
[46:47] he knew they said something bad about it
[46:54] that persona
[46:58] this is the way he was now would he get
[47:02] mad

[50:48] newly enlisted in other words
[50:52] we are new
[51:19] maybe it's me there it is abc's an
[51:22] accuracy or abbreviation
[51:26] now i want to start this morning
[51:33] genesis 3 genesis
[51:40] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[51:44] beast in the field
[51:45] which the lord god had made and he said
[51:47] unto the woman
[51:48] yea as god said you shall not eat of the
[51:51] of every tree of the garden
[52:24] and the woman said unto the serpent
[52:27] we may eat of the fruit of the trees of
[52:30] the garden
[53:11] of the tree which is in the midst of the
[53:13] garden god has said
[53:15] ye shall not eat of it neither shall
[53:18] ye touch it least you die
[53:22] three fruits
[53:30] are they still talking about the word of
[53:32] god
[53:34] yes they are see again
[53:37] then the bible says let me know the old
[53:40] serpent in revelations
[53:42] revelation apocalypses
[53:45] it's the devil it's the old serpent
[53:49] what the one in genesis and hennessy he
[53:52] brought it over here in revelations
[54:05] still talking about the word of god
[54:17] [Applause]
[54:20] and the serpent said unto the woman ye
[54:23] shall not surely die
[54:28] that's where the lie was
[54:32] trying to contradict what god
[54:36] said look at you
[55:04] that's why he started flirting
[55:07] word of god
[55:15] a little white lie blanca
[55:31] you're not gonna die
[55:38] for god does know that in the days you
[55:40] eat thereof
[55:41] that your eyes shall be opened and ye
[55:44] shall be as
[55:45] gods knowing good
[56:56] god's
[57:11] thank you a woman
[57:15] how many of you heard greek mythology
[57:18] raise your hands
[57:27] it's nothing it's just
[57:31] somebody's opinion opinion written
[57:52] can your car be a god
[57:57] don't touch that
[58:02] won't you touch my car
[58:05] a car can be a god because that's what
[58:09] you
[58:09] worship god is an object of worship
[58:14] and many times we worship the worst
[58:17] thing
[58:21] amen amen listen
[58:24] the woman was always in the front line
[58:26] or the woman
[58:31] was in the front line
[58:58] amen amen eve was in the front line
[59:04] was your husband have you ever thought
[59:06] of that
[59:11] this is what brother branham said that's
[59:12] the location of
[59:18] listening at him now
[59:22] just how nasty he gets
[59:25] and how he whitewashes the word
[59:28] yes
[59:44] how many minds does he get into in
[59:46] cuantas mentes
[59:48] think about where do your thoughts start
[59:51] to trigger
[59:57] where does it come out
[1:00:54] after
[1:01:08] we don't
[1:01:21] i'm trying to get into
[1:01:29] this is what satan tried
[1:01:39] now don't you let satan fortify
[1:01:43] nothing don't let him fortify
[1:01:47] nothing

[1:03:28] [Music]
[1:03:41] do you see what enters our mind
[1:03:45] that's what he plays with
[1:03:48] the problem is we allow him to enter our
[1:03:51] minds
[1:03:55] he plays kanikaz marbles
[1:03:58] he plays marbles right up here
[1:04:04] we allow it

[1:04:29] this is what i like watch you uh
[1:04:33] micahs the woman said unto the serpent
[1:04:36] ye may not eat of the fruit of the trees
[1:04:39] of the garden
[1:04:41] but the butt of the fruit of the tree
[1:04:44] which is in the midst in the middle
[1:04:46] sea of the garden
[1:04:52] fruit
[1:04:58] god said you shall not eat of it neither
[1:05:01] shall you touch at least you die
[1:05:06] no more now she got back on the word
[1:05:12] but this guy already opened up her mind
[1:05:17] say it now that's the word
[1:05:21] she's quoting it back to him
[1:05:26] now watch she's quoting she liked to
[1:05:29] quote the word of god
[1:05:33] the word of brother
[1:06:01] i read the books no no
[1:06:29] some of us that are bilingual we can do
[1:06:31] that
[1:06:37] and here's what brother branham is
[1:06:38] saying she's quoting it back to him
[1:06:42] the word of god
[1:07:10] i have pledged my eternal
[1:07:40] and the serpent said unto the woman
[1:07:44] you surely not ye shall not surely die
[1:07:49] see
[1:07:53] what's he trying to do
[1:07:56] that first human being he's trying to
[1:08:00] anoint that precious woman there
[1:08:06] what about us he anoints
[1:08:18] he anoints us with the same word
[1:08:34] come on brother we gotta wake up
[1:08:47] that's exactly what he's trying to get
[1:08:49] her to do
[1:08:56] [Music]
[1:09:17] make some of us fall asleep
[1:09:46] then the girl would say remember carlos
[1:09:50] carlos remember juan
[1:09:53] juan
[1:09:56] pedro remember those guys what happened
[1:09:59] to them
[1:09:59] i wonder what they look like well i'll
[1:10:02] tell you what we can do
[1:10:08] i don't know how brothers cavarosa does
[1:10:10] it
[1:10:12] sounds like that al gossey
[1:10:26] let's look on facebook on facebook
[1:10:39] wow he's gained some weight there that
[1:10:42] boy
[1:10:52] [Music]
[1:10:55] of what it was before off you fantasize
[1:11:00] i don't want to see your hands go up no
[1:11:02] kidding but i can see your hearts
[1:11:05] because once i said it
[1:11:17] that's what happens we go back in time
[1:11:21] we don't want to go back in time
[1:11:25] i go back in time for the vietnam war
[1:11:29] you can see it was no game
[1:11:32] it wasn't a game it was real real
[1:11:36] 58 209 people died
[1:11:46] look at this
[1:11:49] that's what he tries to
[1:11:52] get each
[1:12:07] good how many of us want to be anointed
[1:12:09] with lies
[1:12:17] then
[1:12:45] amen amen
[1:12:51] and the only thing you have to do now
[1:12:55] you're a free moral agent
[1:12:59] now you can accept it if you want to
[1:13:31] the thrill is there
[1:13:36] when some friend of yours
[1:13:40] and before you know it you're sitting
[1:13:42] down at a bar
[1:13:44] get
[1:14:10] because this is part of my next quote
[1:14:25] that many sisters have great husbands
[1:14:29] many brothers have great wives
[1:14:34] the day that it that comes and you don't

[1:53:57] members of phoenix lighthouse tabernacle
[1:54:01] presented
[1:54:07] wishing that each is well and is
[1:54:09] enjoying your health
[1:54:14] we understand that we are living in
[1:54:16] times that were prophesied in the sacred
[1:54:18] scriptures
[1:54:19] difficult times that have affected our
[1:54:21] daily life as we know it
[1:54:28] foreign
[1:54:31] this pandemic that has hit the entire
[1:54:33] world has caused preventive measures to
[1:54:36] be taken
[1:54:36] to maintain the health of each member of
[1:54:38] this church for whom i am responsible
[1:54:48] for
[1:54:51] these measures have been based on the
[1:54:53] statistics
[1:54:54] and regulations issued by the state
[1:54:56] government
[1:54:57] in the same way we have kept abreast of
[1:55:00] the local and
[1:55:01] national news dice
[1:55:13] we have heard that the cases of infected
[1:55:15] individuals have decreased
[1:55:19] individuals but we have also heard
[1:55:23] that certain numbers have been
[1:55:24] manipulated and that all new cases that
[1:55:27] have emerged
[1:55:27] have been reported
[1:55:35] seeing the numbers of infections
[1:55:37] increasing and hearing so much
[1:55:39] contradictory information
[1:55:41] is the reason why i have kept the church
[1:55:42] closed for all this time
[1:55:44] alvaro's
[1:55:55] always keeping in mind the welfare of
[1:55:58] each and every one of you
[1:56:02] [Music]
[1:56:03] some of you might ask when are we going
[1:56:05] to go back to church
[1:56:10] all i can say for now is don't dismay
[1:56:13] and stay true
[1:56:14] everything is in the hands of god
[1:56:22] we will keep you informed and when the
[1:56:24] day comes it will be a pleasure to
[1:56:26] announce the date
[1:56:27] that we can return to church to worship
[1:56:29] the sweet name
[1:56:30] of the lord jesus christ together
