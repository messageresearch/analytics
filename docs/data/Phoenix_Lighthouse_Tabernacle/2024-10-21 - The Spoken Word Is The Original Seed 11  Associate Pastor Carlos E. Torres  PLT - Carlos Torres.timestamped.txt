[0:27] do this and don't you do that you can't

[0:33] to him but the Eve in the last days not
[0:36] going to do it because she predestinated
[0:38] not to do
[0:39] it God's going to do it he knows he'll
[0:42] have he said his spot church will be
[0:43] there without spot or a wrinkle she's
[0:46] going to stand there in the Splendor of
[0:48] him his word made manifest she'll be a
[0:51] token to the world she'll be she'll be
[0:53] something to the world the world can
[0:54] look and say well the rest of world say
[0:56] ah she's a Holy Roller she's the second
[0:57] cousin she don't belong to our group I
[0:59] know that's good
[1:00] thing she belongs to this group up here
[1:03] a man said in the day to me stand
[1:05] talking said well what denomination do
[1:06] you belong to I said none what none I
[1:08] said I belong to a kingdom why is not
[1:11] only equal why is not only equal with
[1:13] God he was God
[1:15] himself see they don't get
[1:17] it by the way some of you might I've
[1:19] heard infidels one time told me that
[1:21] Jesus never did say he was the son of
[1:23] God he sure did you certainly did you
[1:25] just don't know your Bible what did you
[1:27] say the woman at the well that's right
[1:29] what did he tell her I know Messiah
[1:32] cometh and when he comes he'll do these
[1:34] things he said I'm he speaks to
[1:37] you and to Paul also in different one
[1:40] notice but now the church has the prous
[1:43] God's Great secret has always blinded
[1:45] the wisdom of the world they can't get
[1:47] it they just don't understand it Satan
[1:49] don't understand it none the rest of
[1:50] them understands it but just those who
[1:52] are predestinated to understand it how
[1:55] God and Christ are one they'll make him
[1:58] three every time they certainly will
[2:00] notice next secondly the manifested
[2:03] Christ in you the hope of glory that
[2:06] great manifested God in Christ now
[2:09] Christ manifested in you we'll hurry
[2:11] look what was once God's Great secret
[2:15] great mysterious Secret in his mind is
[2:19] now put in the hearts of the believer
[2:22] that is the body of Christ what was
[2:25] God's once great Secret in his mind
[2:27] before the foundation of the world is
[2:29] now made
[2:32] manifest oh I'm sure we don't we don't
[2:35] get it well I I can't sit the way off to
[2:38] and and I'm sure you don't see but God's
[2:41] great mystery what the Eternal God had
[2:45] as a mystery has now been unfolded in
[2:47] Jesus Christ and give it right down to
[2:48] his church what was once in God's Minds
[2:51] now in the body of Christ Jesus making
[2:54] love to the church's bride whispered
[2:56] secrets to her you know how you tell
[2:58] your wife things you know the little
[2:59] girl you're go to Mary you love her so
[3:01] much you just tell her the secrets and
[3:02] get her up next to you and love you and
[3:04] everything you know how it is that's
[3:05] what God Christ is doing to the church
[3:07] see he's letting know the secrets just
[3:09] the secrets not these flirters I mean
[3:11] his wives all right now
[3:14] look by having the revelation of a
[3:17] secret made known to them by his grace
[3:20] how the grace of God people I know it I
[3:23] hope you don't think this sounds
[3:25] personal to a bunch of people or this
[3:27] that but the secret that God is sharing
[3:29] with the whole church if they would just
[3:30] receive it see it doesn't mean just me
[3:33] or just you it means the church that he
[3:34] he's trying to get into it and you say
[3:36] well why don't they receive it they
[3:37] can't receive it he said again he said
[3:40] these things and how could it because
[3:42] Isaiah said they can't see it see and
[3:44] he's always said the prophet Paul said
[3:46] in the last days that people will be he
[3:48] High minded lovers of pleasure more than
[3:50] lovers of God truth Breakers false
[3:51] accusers incontinent and despisers of
[3:53] those that are good heady High minded
[3:55] see having a form of godliness but
[3:57] denying the power thereof from such
[4:00] Turnal way for this is a kind that goes
[4:02] from house to house and leads silly
[4:04] women Lay It Away with divers lust with
[4:05] shorts and bobbed hair and everything
[4:07] else let it away with divers lust and
[4:09] say it's all right oh they're crazy out
[4:10] there don't see never able to come to
[4:13] the knowledge of the truth and these men
[4:15] resistant and the jambers and jamers
[4:17] which stood Moses able to produce a
[4:18] church and produce a group of people
[4:20] just but their hly will be made manifest
[4:23] when Jesus takes his bride and sets her
[4:24] up here and said this is her and away he
[4:26] goes your Folly will be made look at
[4:30] having the revelation of this secret
[4:32] made known to them by his grace look
[4:34] when this great Revelation revealed
[4:38] mystery is made known to you then you
[4:42] denounce all the things of the world
[4:45] Amen now I'm going to come back once

[4:50] to it the tape sake and those that are
[4:52] going across this tape goes across the
[4:54] world see you women Acclaim you got the
[4:57] baptism of the Holy Ghost and not the
[4:59] osity to let your hair grow out when the
[5:03] Bible condemns it and said a woman a
[5:05] man's got a right to put away his wife
[5:07] and divorce if she Bobs her hair honored
[5:09] before God to do so the Bible say she
[5:11] cuts her hair she dishonors her head and
[5:14] it's a common this know what Ain old
[5:15] common thing is for a woman to even pray
[5:17] with bob
[5:18] hair wearing shorts and these slacks and
[5:21] things the Bible said any woman that all
[5:23] you say they put on a garment that
[5:25] pertains to a man it's an Abomination to
[5:27] God filthy dirty like an old stinking
[5:31] bathroom somewhere see oh my the filth
[5:33] in God's nostrils and then you try to
[5:35] pray or offer up prayers and such a
[5:37] thing as that God refuses and turns it

[6:03] the Commandment he
[6:05] magnified remember the Sabbath they keep
[6:07] it holy one day in the week now he
[6:09] magnified it oh rest comes from keeping

[6:17] good for with stammer lips and other
[6:19] tongues will I speak to this people and
[6:21] that is the rest that's a refreshing
[6:23] from the presence of the Lord yet they
[6:25] would not hear it and WIP their heads

[16:42] married by a certain age she has to
[16:43] leave the leave the tribe take off her
[16:45] tribal paint she goes into the city

[17:07] daylight
[17:09] right both men and women you know that's
[17:12] right watch don't you say well I'm pure
[17:14] whoo ever lookth upon a woman to lust

[17:20] already what about that what about you
[17:23] sister that presented yourself that man
[17:25] like that you're just as guilty as if
[17:26] you did it
[17:28] oh but it's all right pastor's afraid to
[17:30] say that cuz why his denominational
[17:32] headquarters will kick him out if he
[17:33] gets straight on that they're hybrid
[17:35] they don't take the word the word said
[17:36] that's
[17:37] true Jesus said it's true and he's the
[17:39] head now
[17:41] notice god making his self- knowing not
[17:46] we're not supposed to make converts to
[17:48] Christianity by government but by the
[17:50] Revelation the Christ in you as God was
[17:53] in Christ as God was in Christ Christ in
[17:57] you
[17:59] what what God did in Christ Christ does
[18:01] in you what signs did God in Christ
[18:05] Christ does in you am oh isn't that
[18:07] beautiful oh my I like that Jesus said
[18:11] at that day that's this day at that day
[18:15] when this Revelation is made known you
[18:17] will know that I am in the
[18:19] father and the father in me I in you and
[18:23] you in
[18:25] me when the Revelation is made manifest
[18:28] at that day you shall know that I and
[18:32] the father are one I'm in the father and
[18:35] the father is in me then when the
[18:37] Revelation comes forth then it's I and
[18:39] you and you and me there you are see the
[18:42] manifold three-fold man what far to
[18:44] bring it back we've got to be as Jesus
[18:48] was the word of God he Vindicated the
[18:51] same If he if he was the word he
[18:53] wouldn't have made manifest the word
[18:54] he'd have been some great Theologian
[18:56] that would have been the real Messiah
[18:57] the world was looking for
[18:59] yes sir that would been him that's what
[19:00] they're looking for today some some
[19:02] somebody can exceed Billy Graham or
[19:04] somebody can SM down with their
[19:06] organization come up and show them
[19:07] Baptist don't know where they're
[19:08] standing sure they're looking for that
[19:11] but the church is looking for the
[19:12] humility and the signs of the Living God
[19:16] Christ amen Jesus wasn't a great
[19:18] Theologian he was a common peasant a
[19:21] cartender son
[19:23] so-called he walked around but God he
[19:25] said some of you show me what the Bible
[19:28] says that I will do that I have it
[19:31] manifest so the church can do the same
[19:33] thing today what Christ did so does the
[19:36] church do now that day you'll know that
[19:39] I am in the father and the father's in
[19:41] me I in you and you in
[19:44] me marching on to Z the word the Kingdom
[19:48] at that day you will know that I'm in
[19:49] you and watch here here's beautiful I
[19:52] don't want you to miss this now
[19:53] everybody you people on tape out in the
[19:55] jungles and wherever you hear it now
[19:57] listen and and as the father has sent me
[20:01] so send I you Jesus said now watch the
[20:04] father that sent him went in him to
[20:07] vindicate himself right for he was the
[20:10] word and the same Jesus the Same Jud
[20:12] goes with you and in you to vindicate
[20:14] the same
[20:15] God as the father has sent me and I live
[20:18] by the father so I send you and you live
[20:21] by me what is he he's the word you live
[20:23] by the word oh how I like take a text on
[20:26] that preach now for about a couple hours
[20:27] on on that how on that notice notice and
[20:32] the father that sent me went with him
[20:35] the father that sends the Jesus s es
[20:37] goes in a little while and the world
[20:39] won't see me no more yet ye shall see me
[20:44] for I personal pronoun I the person
[20:48] Jesus will be with you even in you to
[20:53] the end of the world Hallelujah the
[20:55] works that I do shall you do also now go
[20:59] back and see what he done then see what
[21:01] you do then compare
[21:03] yourself and as it was in the days of
[21:05] Noah so shall it be in the coming of the
[21:07] son of man and as the days of lot when a
[21:10] modern Billy Graham old Roberts went
[21:13] down into Sodom and preached to them
[21:15] sodomites and blinded their eyes see
[21:18] with the gospel one Angel stayed back a
[21:20] messenger with Abraham and the elected
[21:22] group and what kind of a sign did he do
[21:25] see GL and what did Abraham call
[21:30] Elohim God manifested in flesh Jesus
[21:34] showing that he himself God in him will
[21:36] be manifested in his bride in the last
[21:40] days oh my my there no end to it just a
[21:44] revelation of God it's Eternal just
[21:46] keeps moving on and on and on notice
[21:50] then one like the first Adam and Eve
[21:54] before sin separated them in death now
[21:57] Christ the second
[21:59] Adam in life redeems his bride from
[22:03] death and now on his way back to the
[22:06] original
[22:07] Eden restoring back his bride and
[22:10] fellowship back with God as husband and
[22:12] wife in the Garden of Eden Christ and
[22:15] his bride God at that day the kingdom be
[22:18] given the father he might be all in all
[22:20] while he's just speaking out here David
[22:22] Christ David sitting on the throne the
[22:24] king over the whole human
[22:26] race and while they're yet thinking I
[22:28] don't know what they're thinking about
[22:30] for they speak I'll answer them the wolf
[22:32] and the lamb shall feed together shall
[22:35] eat straw like a block they shall feed
[22:37] together and lay down there all my Holy
[22:39] Mountain right back exactly to Eden
[22:42] again as hard as it can go there's his
[22:45] threefold purpose oh God help us to know
[22:47] it help us to know it listen closely now
[22:50] again as we go on going back to the
[22:53] original Eden then when we are born of
[22:57] him we are filled with
[23:00] him see your life his life is in you
[23:03] then all our actions should declare him
[23:07] like taking taking life out of one tree
[23:08] and putting it into another taking life
[23:10] out of a pear tree and put in an apple
[23:11] tree bear pears God to cause a sap life
[23:14] in it the germ it's par treat all right
[23:18] then all of our actions should declare
[23:21] him we have his
[23:23] name that right yes we should bear his
[23:27] name and remember we are now as his
[23:31] bride pregnated with his
[23:34] Spirit
[23:38] Hallelujah the church bearing
[23:41] children pregnated by his spirit with
[23:44] his
[23:47] name bearing his name bearing his
[23:50] life bringing forth the signs of his
[23:54] life evident with the pinises evidence
[23:57] of his resur
[23:59] resurrection showing that he is not dead
[24:02] but alive forever more this is eternal
[24:06] life and a
[24:08] Vindicated vindicates to the world that
[24:12] we are alive in
[24:14] him how do you know because you're a
[24:16] church member because Christ is living
[24:19] through
[24:20] you so pregnated with his spirit that
[24:23] you you're prisoner to anything else
[24:25] you're
[24:26] confined oh my to the gospel confined to
[24:31] the word and all the children that you
[24:33] can bring forth is that course you're a
[24:35] prisoner you can't commit adultery
[24:37] you're already
[24:42] pregnated it can't take a
[24:45] h the womb of life is closed anything
[24:48] else you're already his by
[24:50] predestination that seed has come to
[24:53] life no world can get
[24:56] in GL Glory oh how we'd like to stay on
[24:59] this for about an
[25:01] hour I'm sure you
[25:03] understand Christ and his alone already
[25:07] finished the seed was
[25:09] there Hallelujah the seed was already
[25:12] when was put there before the foundation
[25:13] of the world has predestinated us unto
[25:15] eternal life and as soon as a lifegiving
[25:18] flow that seed laying there other seeds
[25:20] that just would come in wouldn't take
[25:21] hold just couldn't do it like but when
[25:22] that seed come in quickly it stopped up
[25:24] the womb all the rest of the seed was
[25:26] drove out see like that and you become a
[25:28] prisoner surrounded in
[25:30] Christ Christ in you his life bringing
[25:34] forth his evidence his signs oh my look
[25:40] bringing his signs of life as an evident
[25:43] of his resurrection proving to the world
[25:45] that eternal life vindicates to the
[25:48] world that we are alive in him and think
[25:50] of it alive with God Our

[1:05:56] upon the face of the
[1:06:00] waters and God said let there be light
[1:06:02] and there was
[1:06:07] light and God saw the light that it was

[1:07:37] town he's in the country of
[1:07:41] Peru so let's continue praying for
[1:07:44] him so that God may continue to
[1:07:46] strengthen
[1:07:50] him because it's a lot of work that has
[1:07:53] to be done
[1:07:56] and after being out for so long

[1:08:03] hotel

[1:08:08] your own
[1:08:15] bed and whether he's here or he's out of
[1:08:19] town we're always going to keep him and
[1:08:21] maintain him in prayer
[1:08:25] because that's what was needed what we
[1:08:27] want one for the
[1:08:29] other but always for our
[1:08:32] pastor to have them in our
[1:08:38] prayers he's been he's a monument tested
[1:08:40] by
[1:08:41] [Music]
[1:08:45] time so I believe that we
[1:08:48] are under the shadow of a of a standing
[1:08:52] firm of a pillar that's a privilege
[1:09:00] before continue I'd like to greet our
[1:09:01] brothers who are in
[1:09:03] Iowa they're currently watching
[1:09:07] us last weekend our brother

[1:09:49] brothers they made the decision to get
[1:09:53] baptized we thank we're grateful for the
[1:09:55] word they the work
[1:09:57] they and we thank God for these two
[1:10:00] people who made such an important
[1:10:05] decision R I like to greet our brother
[1:10:08] in s l
[1:10:11] Rio currently find himself there at this
[1:10:14] moment with his favorite uh
[1:10:16] brother-in-law I mean
[1:10:20] son-in-law with his favorite son-in-law
[1:10:26] I was thinking of Pablo when I said
[1:10:29] that with brother Nate he's there
[1:10:32] [Music]
[1:10:37] supporting it's a pleasure that they're
[1:10:39] also doing the work of God in that
[1:10:42] area let us
[1:10:46] continue we've been speaking on is the
[1:10:48] spoken word is the Original
[1:10:52] Seed it's a very beautiful topic
[1:10:57] of our brothers have spoken have done an
[1:10:58] excellent
[1:11:01] job each one has taken it from a
[1:11:03] different way perspective they've
[1:11:05] brought
[1:11:06] it and has been a blessing to each one
[1:11:08] of
[1:11:11] us we can only take just a small part of
[1:11:14] what was told to
[1:11:15] us and apply it to our
[1:11:19] hearts I believe it would be a great
[1:11:21] blessing to our
[1:11:23] lives so let us continue with
[1:11:27] that
[1:11:29] speakit what God has placed in our
[1:11:34] hearts before continue I also like to
[1:11:36] thank the
[1:11:41] musicians when the worship was going on
[1:11:43] I came back there with the young
[1:11:44] man to gave them the
[1:11:49] presentation and so I can see the way
[1:11:51] the spirit of God moves
[1:11:56] a lot has to do with the musicians being
[1:11:57] in
[1:11:59] harmony that the spirit of God can come
[1:12:03] and take
[1:12:06] control so the musicians have to be in
[1:12:09] their
[1:12:10] position they have to be in their
[1:12:12] position they have to know what God
[1:12:14] called them
[1:12:16] for and know that they are also an
[1:12:18] instrument of
[1:12:21] God brother shows us that God heals
[1:12:23] through music
[1:12:27] [Music]
[1:12:29] there has to be a Harmony between the
[1:12:30] musicians and sad that the spirit begin
[1:12:33] to and starts doing the
[1:12:37] work so I believe they're a fundamental
[1:12:41] part of the worship to our Lord Jesus
[1:12:45] Christ so I'd like to thank the
[1:12:51] musicians the reason is because they
[1:12:53] make quite the effort
[1:12:56] don't think that they just get here and
[1:12:57] they just start
[1:12:59] [Music]
[1:13:03] playing Harmony doesn't come through
[1:13:05] coincidence or work of
[1:13:08] magic it's something that has to be
[1:13:10] worked on in order to be able to be
[1:13:14] accomplished all that
[1:13:18] partake extra they're making an extra
[1:13:22] effort they practice throughout the week
[1:13:25] at
[1:13:27] home they get here together on Tuesdays
[1:13:29] and on
[1:13:31] Saturdays and they're constantly
[1:13:35] practicing to be able to make a better
[1:13:40] service I appreciate the musicians all
[1:13:43] the work they do in their
[1:13:47] [Music]
[1:13:50] efforts have so much experience
[1:13:57] experience maybe they can play their
[1:13:58] instrument with their eyes closed or
[1:14:00] eyes
[1:14:09] shut I don't to feel old but by the time
[1:14:12] I was born they were already playing an
[1:14:16] instrument but they're always
[1:14:21] here some experience they could just say
[1:14:23] well I don't need to practice
[1:14:27] but practice is what brings
[1:14:30] Excellence practice is what makes the
[1:14:32] master or
[1:14:35] teacher so the worst mistake that a
[1:14:37] person that does not practice can
[1:14:39] make is to trust in their own
[1:14:42] gift because if a person does not want
[1:14:45] to practice and they want to provide a
[1:14:47] service to God and they trust in their
[1:14:50] own
[1:14:52] gift then they're trusting on their own
[1:14:54] wisdom
[1:14:57] but when a person
[1:14:59] practices and they enter in harmony with
[1:15:01] those part of the
[1:15:04] team so they're no longer relying on
[1:15:08] one they're relying on the gift of the
[1:15:12] Holy
[1:15:14] Spirit that's the only one can bring in
[1:15:16] harmony all
[1:15:18] together of all the participants of a
[1:15:21] project to be able to reach a goal
[1:15:28] top this is all part of
[1:15:31] it spoken word is the Original
[1:15:36] Seed my yoke is
[1:15:39] easy we've been speaking on
[1:15:42] this Matthew
[1:15:46] 11:28 come on to me the labor and are
[1:15:49] heavy
[1:15:50] laden and I will give you rest
[1:15:57] take my yoke upon you and learn of
[1:16:02] me for I am meek and lowly in
[1:16:06] hearts and you shall find rest unto your
[1:16:10] souls my yoke is easy and my burden is
[1:16:15] light my yoke is
[1:16:18] easy if we are heavy laden or
[1:16:23] labored making towards
[1:16:27] us but this
[1:16:30] is an invitation in order to accept it
[1:16:33] is up to you it's
[1:16:35] volunt no one can obligate
[1:16:38] Us in the age which we live
[1:16:40] in the age of
[1:16:43] Le the most religious
[1:16:45] age but yet it's the darkest
[1:16:50] age the worst age has existed amongst
[1:16:52] time
[1:16:55] this this age has Jesus on the outside
[1:16:58] and Jesus is
[1:17:01] knocking he's knocking on the door so he
[1:17:03] can come
[1:17:07] inside but the age thinks that they know
[1:17:10] it
[1:17:12] all Revelations 320 and
[1:17:15] forward it's
[1:17:17] cold it's naked it's Naked and Afraid
[1:17:21] and not
[1:17:22] not it thinks that it lacks nothing
[1:17:26] it thinks that it is
[1:17:28] Rich when it is good in worldly
[1:17:32] things but not in spiritual
[1:17:36] Goods in the midst of all this
[1:17:39] confusion in the midst of all this age
[1:17:43] so
[1:17:44] dark that sometimes we don't know what
[1:17:46] to
[1:17:47] do there is an
[1:17:50] enemy there's an
[1:17:52] enemy that comes and speaks to our minds
[1:17:56] is trying
[1:17:57] to to push us to do certain
[1:18:00] things that go against the word in this
[1:18:04] age brother bam has told
[1:18:08] us he's never preached to such a tired
[1:18:11] people as in
[1:18:13] this many times we don't have the
[1:18:15] strength to serve the
[1:18:18] Lord we have the strength to
[1:18:21] pray we stay
[1:18:23] asleep we're
[1:18:26] stressed we have
[1:18:28] anxiety we have
[1:18:31] nervousness what we
[1:18:35] eat it's causing us um an an unbalance
[1:18:39] hormonal
[1:18:40] imbalance our own
[1:18:45] food it's causing us to have emotional
[1:18:48] problems let me tell you once
[1:18:53] again the food is causing us to have
[1:18:55] emotional
[1:18:58] problems the emotional
[1:19:02] instability it's causing us to have
[1:19:04] spiritual
[1:19:05] problems because the
[1:19:09] body has to have a union with the
[1:19:12] spirit the prophet says that we are
[1:19:15] three Soul spirit and
[1:19:17] body and they're all
[1:19:20] connected when the spirit has the
[1:19:23] thoughts affects our
[1:19:26] body in which
[1:19:28] way through chemical
[1:19:33] discharge when one feels
[1:19:42] happy there's something that releases a
[1:19:44] chemical or hormone that bra which is
[1:19:49] serotonin that's the hormone of
[1:19:53] happiness and M tent is the one where
[1:19:55] your circadian rhythm where you
[1:19:59] sleep it's the Circadian
[1:20:02] Ry that maintains a certain
[1:20:08] time begins when the sun rays hit your
[1:20:11] the pupil of your
[1:20:12] eyes they send an order to your
[1:20:18] brain by a certain amount of
[1:20:22] time you'll be awake and you will also
[1:20:25] fall asleep at a certain
[1:20:27] time so when your body receives that
[1:20:32] light so
[1:20:35] melatonin which is the hormone for you
[1:20:36] to fall
[1:20:39] asleep it's already program so that by a
[1:20:41] certain time it could go into action and
[1:20:44] that's when you're going to get sleepy
[1:20:46] that's what's
[1:20:47] normal it starts to get dark you already
[1:20:51] know the Melatonin comes forth
[1:20:54] before you know you're sitting down on
[1:20:56] the couch and you're already
[1:20:59] snoring well those that snore I know
[1:21:01] there's a lot that don't
[1:21:05] snore it's happens I wake myself up with
[1:21:07] my own
[1:21:10] snores even though my wife says that I
[1:21:12] don't snore
[1:21:16] but but that's the way our body
[1:21:22] works but the the enemy has a
[1:21:25] purpose to bring an unbalance to Our
[1:21:29] Lives Many Times using our cell
[1:21:34] phone you know that when you use your
[1:21:36] cell
[1:21:37] phone we break that
[1:21:40] cycle the Melatonin had to come forth at
[1:21:42] a certain
[1:21:44] time but the light is hitting our
[1:21:49] eyes when the brain saying wait hold on
[1:21:51] I was supposed to send for
[1:21:52] M but now all this light is coming
[1:21:56] in that light only comes forth when the
[1:21:58] sun comes
[1:22:01] out the screen from our screens is this
[1:22:04] light from our screen is hting our
[1:22:07] eyes it's sending a sign to our brain
[1:22:10] way why are you going to
[1:22:11] sleep that's telling us that's not time
[1:22:13] to go to sleep
[1:22:15] yet then
[1:22:20] later our tablet or our television
[1:22:25] and the next day we're tired and we're
[1:22:26] walking around like
[1:22:30] this then
[1:22:33] afterwards we hear the message we listen
[1:22:36] to the
[1:22:37] word and it tell us that we have to
[1:22:39] pray and we're too
[1:22:43] tired because we already lost
[1:22:47] balance I want to pray but I can't
[1:22:53] pray I would like to pray but I'm just
[1:22:55] too
[1:22:57] tired and maybe it's because we're
[1:22:59] watching a Christian
[1:23:01] movie at 10 p.m. or 11:
[1:23:04] p.m. when it was it was time that we
[1:23:06] should be
[1:23:09] resting because the body restored itself
[1:23:11] when it
[1:23:14] rests the body has the power to heal
[1:23:17] itself God has placed that power within
[1:23:19] the
[1:23:21] body but the body needs time in order to
[1:23:23] restore and heal
[1:23:26] itself and that's the last thing we want
[1:23:28] to give our
[1:23:29] bod it's time for it to
[1:23:33] rest the only way the body Resto itself
[1:23:35] is
[1:23:38] sleeping and there's some of us that go
[1:23:40] to the
[1:23:41] other would you want to spend all the
[1:23:43] time
[1:23:45] sleeping what were you doing well I was
[1:23:49] asleep that's good no
[1:23:52] problem how come you didn't get doing is
[1:23:55] I was
[1:23:56] asleep we also can't be sleeping all the
[1:24:00] time we have to be alert we have to be
[1:24:03] awake we're living in we have to be
[1:24:08] awake that's why the Lord
[1:24:13] Jesus come unto me all you
[1:24:15] labor and I will give you
[1:24:19] rest the rest that we're looking for is
[1:24:21] physical
[1:24:25] the Lord Jesus Christ is speaking to us
[1:24:26] about
[1:24:29] is trility that it
[1:24:35] needs the
[1:24:38] confidence that God gave a
[1:24:40] prom God will fulfill
[1:24:43] it I want to know that God is
[1:24:47] listening tends to my
[1:24:50] prayer in order to get to that level
[1:24:55] go higher to a level level to understand
[1:24:58] God's
[1:25:00] plan absorbed by the age
[1:25:04] of understand God's plan in our
[1:25:07] lives that's why we need to
[1:25:09] know where we're living the age we live
[1:25:13] in analyze the
[1:25:15] age because God has a plan for us in the
[1:25:19] darkest
[1:25:20] age the most religious
[1:25:23] age God sent his best
[1:25:26] soldiers this is the darkest
[1:25:28] age and God sent you for what to bring
[1:25:32] the
[1:25:34] light to undo the works of the
[1:25:37] devil how am I going to do this we're
[1:25:40] going to rest in
[1:25:42] Jesus rest in
[1:25:44] him attend
[1:25:46] to I'm going to obey what he
[1:25:50] says
[1:25:52] now uh
[1:25:56] now Jesus invites us to take upon his
[1:26:01] yoke and he ask us to learn from
[1:26:06] him and he tell us to be meek and lowly
[1:26:09] in
[1:26:12] heart that's the requirement for us in
[1:26:14] order to be able to find rest for our
[1:26:20] souls in order to find rest in my soul I
[1:26:23] have to be meek and lowly
[1:26:24] heart lowly in heart and
[1:26:27] meek meek and lowly in
[1:26:31] heart
[1:26:32] meek meek not
[1:26:35] dumb
[1:26:36] Meek and humble or lowly in heart being
[1:26:44] humble it's one of the most difficult
[1:26:46] things to do in the age we live in being
[1:26:50] humble why
[1:26:56] because one of the things that we have
[1:26:59] seen and one of the things that the the
[1:27:01] enemy has taken charged in order to
[1:27:03] do is to twist or mix up the
[1:27:07] concepts the concepts that help us
[1:27:13] understand the concepts that help us and
[1:27:15] allow us to have that Revelation for
[1:27:18] example this is the age of the vior this
[1:27:21] is the age of the overcomer
[1:27:25] it's the age of
[1:27:27] overcoming but what does it mean to
[1:27:30] overcome well overcome
[1:27:36] means wrestling and
[1:27:39] fighting other
[1:27:42] wrestlers old school wrestlers now you
[1:27:44] know what I'm talking
[1:27:46] about I don't even know the names of the
[1:27:48] new are Mexican
[1:27:51] wrestlers boxers as well
[1:27:55] J perhaps Julio Chavez that's as far as
[1:27:59] I
[1:28:00] can but when they win the battle or the
[1:28:03] fight they lift up their
[1:28:05] hand they have to wait until the end of
[1:28:07] the fight in order to lift up their
[1:28:10] hands when they lifted their hands
[1:28:12] that's who won the one with his hand
[1:28:13] lift up that's the one who
[1:28:16] won we have to wait until the end of the
[1:28:19] fight if the thing is even
[1:28:25] or if he knocks him out well then we
[1:28:26] know automatically who
[1:28:28] [Music]
[1:28:30] won but in wrestling it's the
[1:28:33] [Music]
[1:28:34] same and that is what we think a battle
[1:28:38] or a fight the
[1:28:41] wins the one who's standing the one
[1:28:44] who's on the floor without tee I up and
[1:28:47] he and the other one says I
[1:28:49] won but the prophet comes and clarifies
[1:28:52] what the concept of overcoming is
[1:28:55] and he says that overcoming is to
[1:28:56] withstand the
[1:28:58] test he's not saying wait for the test
[1:29:01] to be for to be
[1:29:03] victorious
[1:29:06] wait wait for God to
[1:29:08] answer for try to be
[1:29:10] over the CR over and that was
[1:29:14] good way too late many times many times
[1:29:17] where we
[1:29:18] Waits celebrate a
[1:29:21] victory it it causes us to be in defeat
[1:29:25] let me tell you once
[1:29:26] again many times waiting to celebrate a
[1:29:31] victory is what produces
[1:29:34] defeat the prophet told
[1:29:37] us to overcome is to stand test if I'm
[1:29:40] in a
[1:29:42] test understanding the
[1:29:44] test that means that I'm an
[1:29:48] overcomer hard the fight is
[1:29:50] B the age is dark I have problems
[1:29:56] in my
[1:29:58] life I see everything as
[1:30:01] negative but then I go to the
[1:30:05] word that God always answers our prayers
[1:30:07] at the right
[1:30:09] time to go to a higher
[1:30:11] level leave the influence of Lady
[1:30:15] o into the atmosphere of the
[1:30:19] word word in order to
[1:30:21] be the word tells me
[1:30:25] father in his name he will do
[1:30:28] then I will start to
[1:30:31] pray I'm going to pray nothing
[1:30:33] happens I'm going to lift up my hand as
[1:30:35] a
[1:30:38] Victorious because you have given me the
[1:30:40] victory it's still not reflected
[1:30:43] yet I'm withing the test I the
[1:30:48] test what makes me Victorious I'm not
[1:30:51] going to wait God answers
[1:30:54] to celebrate my victory I'm going to
[1:30:56] celebrate
[1:30:58] it while I'm in the
[1:31:00] battle while I'm in the
[1:31:02] tri I'm going to worship God lift my
[1:31:05] hands up I'm going to give him
[1:31:08] thanks he already answered my
[1:31:11] prayer and when I do
[1:31:13] that my spirit enters into another
[1:31:17] dimension I don't go
[1:31:19] up not
[1:31:21] literally I enter into another dimension
[1:31:25] I see things in a different way the
[1:31:28] Revelation no longer limit me to
[1:31:31] physical
[1:31:33] things me see the kingdom spiritual
[1:31:35] Kingdom when I
[1:31:37] enter in the spiritual
[1:31:40] world I can see
[1:31:42] God in the throne interceding for me the
[1:31:46] prophet
[1:31:47] said what the Lord Jesus Christ doing
[1:31:51] he's interceding why
[1:31:55] for each thing that I
[1:31:56] confess that is already done when he's
[1:32:00] there interceding for
[1:32:02] me that I speak the
[1:32:05] word that I go in prayer he takes my
[1:32:09] prayer takes it to
[1:32:11] Calvary he he mixes it up with his
[1:32:14] blood he presents it before the father
[1:32:18] and it says here it is here's your
[1:32:21] son and it's determined time
[1:32:24] he will answer if what I do is get into
[1:32:30] action and within the reach of
[1:32:33] God God's
[1:32:35] rest it's not
[1:32:37] idleness it's not being not
[1:32:40] moving entering in
[1:32:42] action because Jesus's yoke he didn't
[1:32:46] say he say I will take your
[1:32:50] burden said my burden is
[1:32:52] lights you have to carry it my yoke is
[1:32:56] easy and burning is
[1:33:01] light that's a concept of an
[1:33:05] overcomer what about
[1:33:09] humility being
[1:33:17] humble God bless
[1:33:20] you God bless
[1:33:22] you the brother so
[1:33:24] humble he even leaned over AOW to greet
[1:33:28] me he's so
[1:33:32] humble look at the shoes he's
[1:33:35] wearing he has a hole in his
[1:33:39] shoes he's so
[1:33:43] humble humility has nothing to do with
[1:33:45] your
[1:33:47] appearance you have to dress the best
[1:33:49] you can best that you can
[1:33:54] the
[1:33:57] best now the best you have are holes in
[1:34:00] your shoes and don't worry about then
[1:34:02] that's the best that you
[1:34:05] can but humility doesn't have to do with
[1:34:07] the way you dress
[1:34:11] yourself the prophet comes and he clears
[1:34:13] up the concept of
[1:34:15] humility and he say that humility is to
[1:34:17] surrender your rights forit your
[1:34:20] rights in this age everybody is claiming
[1:34:22] their rights I have the right to do this
[1:34:26] I have the right to do
[1:34:28] that I have the right to believe that I
[1:34:30] am a
[1:34:31] dog I have the right to believe that I
[1:34:33] am a
[1:34:35] cat well if you're a cat then I'm going
[1:34:37] to give you a cat for let's see if
[1:34:39] you're really eat
[1:34:47] it so then the anointing of Leia comes
[1:34:50] and wants to make us think
[1:34:54] and it PES us to believe that humility
[1:34:56] has to do with appear or a certain
[1:34:59] Behavior
[1:35:01] hum how much you can surrender your
[1:35:04] rights to the
[1:35:07] word whaton humil is so important in the
[1:35:11] day that we are living
[1:35:13] in in this time that we live in it's in
[1:35:16] the
[1:35:18] age when the Mysteries have been opened
[1:35:23] came to unravel
[1:35:26] itself when there was no one that was
[1:35:28] worthy to open up that
[1:35:31] book where the Mysteries were
[1:35:33] written there was no one
[1:35:37] worthy which meant it was judgment for
[1:35:42] Humanity but when it looked like there
[1:35:44] was no
[1:35:48] hope looking he knew what was written in
[1:35:50] that book
[1:35:55] of those
[1:35:56] Mysteries was the book of
[1:36:01] Redemption where the names of all those
[1:36:03] were
[1:36:04] written for
[1:36:07] which Lord Jesus Christ has given his
[1:36:09] life up
[1:36:11] for God had a
[1:36:15] plan looking at and there was no one
[1:36:19] worthy one of the elders said
[1:36:24] Behold The Lion of the tribe of
[1:36:26] Judah Behold The
[1:36:28] Lion John
[1:36:31] knew the representation of the
[1:36:34] lion the lion by its characteristics
[1:36:37] he's the king he the king of the
[1:36:40] jungle he's a strong
[1:36:42] leader that's his nature of the
[1:36:48] lion when the lion
[1:36:50] roars all are quiet
[1:36:55] so John thought about seeing the
[1:36:59] lion he thought that the Judgment would
[1:37:01] begin with
[1:37:02] him he thought the lion came to
[1:37:06] Judge John stops and he turns and
[1:37:10] looks perhaps he had his sight looking
[1:37:13] down and little by little he started
[1:37:14] lifting it up and when he sees the
[1:37:18] vision what he thought was a
[1:37:21] lamb that had been slain
[1:37:24] before the foundation of the world when
[1:37:27] he sees the
[1:37:29] lamb everyone begins to have a
[1:37:33] jubilee open the seals was the L not the
[1:37:37] lion it was the
[1:37:40] lamb because the nature of the
[1:37:42] Lamb was
[1:37:45] humility that when he went to
[1:37:48] sa he didn't claim his
[1:37:50] rights he gave up his
[1:37:54] for the benefit of
[1:37:56] many came died at the cross at
[1:37:59] Calvary he came and gave up his blood
[1:38:02] for the
[1:38:02] forgiveness for the
[1:38:04] Redemption for the
[1:38:08] restoration of those that had their name
[1:38:10] written down in the book of
[1:38:13] redemption but that book was sealed
[1:38:16] there was no salvation there was
[1:38:19] nothing we were all
[1:38:21] lost but what opened it
[1:38:24] what broke open the seals what opened
[1:38:26] the
[1:38:28] Mysteries was the nature of a
[1:38:30] lamb the lamb is humble the lamb
[1:38:34] forfeits his
[1:38:35] rights the lamb doesn't claim anything
[1:38:37] for itself in the time we live
[1:38:41] in to understand the
[1:38:44] mystery that had been hidden throughout
[1:38:46] the
[1:38:47] times everybody wanted to be at this
[1:38:50] time because the mystery would be
[1:38:52] revealed
[1:38:54] but the Myster is not found in the
[1:38:57] heavens the Mysteries are not in the
[1:38:59] written
[1:39:01] word the Myst is in the revealed word
[1:39:04] inside of the heart of
[1:39:06] man inside of the heart is the
[1:39:10] mystery who am I what do I represent in
[1:39:14] this age what are my
[1:39:16] rights what are my obligations what can
[1:39:19] I
[1:39:20] do what my position in Christ the only
[1:39:24] way I can understand who I
[1:39:28] am is when I let the nature of the Lamb
[1:39:31] come and just as the lamb forfeited his
[1:39:34] when he surrender his rights he gives up
[1:39:37] his
[1:39:38] life he projects the love to
[1:39:41] humanity and when love is
[1:39:44] projected Grace comes into
[1:39:47] action when Grace comes into
[1:39:50] action gra produ Grace produces a
[1:39:52] sacrifice
[1:39:54] and we're
[1:39:55] beneficiaries of that sacrifice now
[1:39:58] there's healing there's Liberation
[1:40:01] there's pardon there's
[1:40:04] restoration but where is it brother it's
[1:40:07] within me what do I have to
[1:40:10] do you have to make a decision that's
[1:40:14] all you have to make a
[1:40:16] decision that
[1:40:18] you will take this word and will remain
[1:40:21] there until this word
[1:40:24] be made life quick through the
[1:40:27] Revelation in my
[1:40:30] heart then I will be in another
[1:40:33] dimension I will walk
[1:40:36] different because I'm not going to
[1:40:38] trust what I can do I will walk in the
[1:40:44] way in the way of
[1:40:47] Hol absolutely no one can get
[1:40:51] lost less the less
[1:40:55] will know where to go in this walk in
[1:40:58] the Walk of God the Walk of Hol I won't
[1:41:02] go to other side to the other side
[1:41:06] Perfection is what he desires from us
[1:41:09] but
[1:41:10] Perfection as we think of it
[1:41:14] how is completely different
[1:41:27] now being
[1:41:30] humble the other is to be
[1:41:35] meek how can a person be
[1:41:39] meek
[1:41:41] man signif
[1:41:46] means
[1:41:48] virtue that moderates your
[1:41:51] wrath and it's disorderly
[1:41:56] effects
[1:42:01] wrath many of the decisions we make them
[1:42:05] we're angry we have
[1:42:08] wrath and we make
[1:42:13] decisions and the result will have
[1:42:15] disorderly effects on our
[1:42:18] lives it's a way of
[1:42:21] templ that avoids all movement out of
[1:42:25] order of
[1:42:29] resentment generally
[1:42:34] resentment have you ever been resentful
[1:42:36] against
[1:42:42] yourself many times we're we're
[1:42:44] angry we want to hit
[1:42:48] ourselves hate yourself all you want
[1:42:50] nothing will change no no
[1:42:53] all you have to do is make a
[1:42:55] decision your heart has to be a firm
[1:42:58] decision don't hit yourself with your
[1:43:00] hand yourself with the word of God start
[1:43:04] praying listen to the message read but
[1:43:08] brother it's because you don't
[1:43:10] understand
[1:43:12] me I don't have
[1:43:17] time that
[1:43:19] brother those are called excuses those
[1:43:21] are called excuses
[1:43:25] I'm G tell you who is the originator of
[1:43:27] all excuses it's the devil it's that
[1:43:32] simple so each time you make an
[1:43:36] excuse of why you can't grow
[1:43:39] spiritually then you're listening to the
[1:43:41] devil it's just that
[1:43:45] simple brother because I I work too much
[1:43:48] I'm too tired
[1:43:55] there's a word in
[1:43:57] Hebrew for
[1:44:00] excuses and the word
[1:44:05] is now we add Gest to it and we
[1:44:10] say I don't have
[1:44:13] time I work too
[1:44:17] much I'm too tired exus those are
[1:44:21] excuses exus those are excuses
[1:44:23] they
[1:44:26] excuses we need to be
[1:44:31] meak to be able to enter into the rest
[1:44:33] of Jesus and take on his
[1:44:38] yoke meekness is behaving with goodness
[1:44:41] and
[1:44:42] gentleness
[1:44:44] Serenity a good self-esteem autol in
[1:44:51] self-control is that easy to do brother
[1:44:54] it's not easy it's not
[1:45:00] easy then why did Jesus ask us to be
[1:45:02] meek if it's not
[1:45:05] easy he says my yoke is
[1:45:07] easy and my burden is
[1:45:11] light he's telling us that we have to be
[1:45:15] meek so then
[1:45:18] Jesus he's inviting us to take on the
[1:45:20] Yoke along with him
[1:45:25] and he will begin to show us how to be
[1:45:27] meek how to be
[1:45:32] humble and the problem is that many
[1:45:36] times we can't see what the word of God
[1:45:38] is tell what the message tells
[1:45:44] us
[1:45:50] meekness has to have a greatness and an
[1:45:52] interior strength
[1:45:55] to be able to face the difficult
[1:45:58] situations without recurring to
[1:46:01] violence or falling uh falling to to
[1:46:08] feelings resentment
[1:46:11] hate and
[1:46:16] bitterness here how many are
[1:46:18] Meek how many want to
[1:46:21] beak in order to be
[1:46:25] meek we have to study another
[1:46:29] concept which is to be
[1:46:32] diligent in order to be
[1:46:35] me we have to be
[1:46:39] diligent we have to be
[1:46:42] diligent Ephesians
[1:46:45] 5:15 in the following way just write it
[1:46:47] down
[1:46:55] see then that you walk circumspectly not
[1:46:57] as fools but as
[1:47:00] wise Redeeming the
[1:47:04] time because the days are
[1:47:07] evil a diligent
[1:47:12] person knows how to take advantage of
[1:47:15] their time being
[1:47:19] diligent taking advantage of your time
[1:47:24] the definition of
[1:47:27] diligent is to fulfill with
[1:47:34] diligence with oneself means to be
[1:47:38] active not fall into
[1:47:44] laziness the worst en to a Christian
[1:47:46] this time is
[1:47:48] laziness it's idleness
[1:47:56] he doesn't fall into
[1:47:58] laziness because he has
[1:48:01] goals he fulfills them throughout
[1:48:04] time so then a diligent
[1:48:08] person has
[1:48:10] goals take advantage of time they plan
[1:48:14] their
[1:48:14] time they have a
[1:48:17] calendar they say okay I'm going to
[1:48:20] pray at 9:00 p.m. I'm going to
[1:48:25] pray doesn't matter watching TV I'm
[1:48:27] watching my favorite TV
[1:48:33] show Al is gonna
[1:48:36] confess to Maria
[1:48:38] gual go go
[1:48:43] PR don't worry about
[1:48:45] that yes brother
[1:48:48] [Music]
[1:48:55] it's time to pray should I go wait for
[1:48:56] him knock him out or should I go
[1:48:58] pray you go
[1:49:00] pray then afterwards you can watch
[1:49:03] the record you go ahead and record it
[1:49:07] then later you can enjoy
[1:49:09] it
[1:49:10] po or whatever you
[1:49:16] like some carrots a little bit of
[1:49:21] salad second Peter
[1:49:28] says brother bam used this
[1:49:31] scripture when he preached the stature
[1:49:33] of a perfect
[1:49:45] man and besid this giving all diligence
[1:49:48] add to your faith virtue and to Virtue
[1:49:50] knowledge
[1:49:55] preaches the St of a perfect
[1:49:59] man and the Apostle Peter thousands of
[1:50:01] years
[1:50:03] ago tells us that in order to be able to
[1:50:05] grow
[1:50:06] spiritually to reach
[1:50:09] adoption of a perfect
[1:50:12] man we have to be
[1:50:14] diligent because a diligent person
[1:50:17] doesn't make excuses
[1:50:23] doesn't blame others for their
[1:50:27] behavior they don't justify why they're
[1:50:29] found the condition they they don't
[1:50:32] blame their parents they don't blame the
[1:50:35] government they don't blame
[1:50:38] anybody they take the
[1:50:40] responsibility they take the
[1:50:42] commitment they begin to be
[1:50:45] D the main
[1:50:48] ingred for Christian to be
[1:50:50] adopted is diligence
[1:50:54] because a diligent person has
[1:50:56] goals what's the goal of a diligent
[1:51:00] Christian to reach the stature of a
[1:51:02] perfect man the Bible says that
[1:51:06] you you have to
[1:51:08] add
[1:51:10] you you have to
[1:51:13] add to your faith you have to add
[1:51:16] virtue who's going to add
[1:51:19] it
[1:51:20] you you
[1:51:23] that's why you have to be
[1:51:25] diligent you will make a
[1:51:27] commitment that you will
[1:51:31] do you will be the reflection of Jesus
[1:51:34] Christ in the time you live so
[1:51:37] then you have to have
[1:51:39] faith
[1:51:41] faith
[1:51:43] faith has a
[1:51:45] foundation the prophet tells us perfect
[1:51:49] Faith the foundation for faith
[1:51:53] is
[1:51:54] forgiveness in order to
[1:51:57] forgive you have to be
[1:52:00] meek because a person that is
[1:52:03] meak can control their emotions and
[1:52:06] their
[1:52:07] thoughts to be able to forgive you have
[1:52:09] to be
[1:52:12] humble because someone who's humble
[1:52:14] doesn't look for their rights no
[1:52:16] no no he did to me now it's time for
[1:52:20] payback oh you best believe
[1:52:26] if you have payback then you're going to
[1:52:27] have
[1:52:29] dou if you seek Vengeance
[1:52:31] for bitterness will fill your
[1:52:37] hearts your hearts can to be filled with
[1:52:40] bitterness and the devil's not going to
[1:52:42] take you outside
[1:52:44] chur he have you sitting in church with
[1:52:46] your heart full of
[1:52:48] bitterness if you want to be free from
[1:52:50] bitterness then forgive
[1:52:52] yourself
[1:52:54] first forgive yourself for your
[1:52:56] mistakes for not doing what you were
[1:52:58] supposed to
[1:52:59] do and then forgive if somebody else has
[1:53:01] offended
[1:53:03] you because the base for faith
[1:53:05] is without forgiveness there's no
[1:53:08] without faith there's no
[1:53:10] Revelation without Revelation there's no
[1:53:12] growth without growth there's no
[1:53:17] adoption all that just for not forgiving

[1:54:36] attitude towards any Divine
[1:54:39] promise that is written in the word of
[1:54:41] God doesn't matter what it
