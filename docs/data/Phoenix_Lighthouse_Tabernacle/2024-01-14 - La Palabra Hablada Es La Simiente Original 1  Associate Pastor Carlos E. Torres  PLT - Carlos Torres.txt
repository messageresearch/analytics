morning it's a pleasure to be in the house of the Lord before anything else let us go to the scripture you'd be so kind let us make it simple let's go to Genesis 1 that one's easy if we can't find Genesis Genesis 1 Genesis 1 verse one the word of God reads the following name of Lord Jesus Christ in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning or the first day may God add the blessing to the reading of his word and be so kind and please take your seats tell him God bless you greet them bless give him a smile we referenced back to the pandemics and it was quite a divide in the history of humanity and many times it's before and after before we should greet ourselves in another way and after the pandemic we all greet ourselves in a different way maybe doing a fist one back then was maybe he doesn't want to greet me no it's like I'm thankful that he greeted me that way there's been quite a divide we're going to greet each other and we're going to bless each other doesn't matter in which way if it's like this if it's like this like that but we're going to bless our brother we're going to make sure that our brother has a prophetic word when we say God bless you desire all the bless in the life of our brother we say brother why do you say that because that's a revelation when you desire the best to your brother what do you believe is going to happen that's going to come back to you as well so be careful what you desire upon your brother glory to God this morning thank God before we continue I'd like to thank our pastor first for he finds himself outside [Music] town I'm thankful that he can still continue to travel and we're always supporting him in prayer trying to support him in anything we can so always remember our pastor in prayer may God give him the strength where find the Holy Spirit manifest itself in a powerful way he may fulfill the purpose for why he is in the place he's at amen amen I believe as brother bam says if anybody needs prayer it is me so our pastor each time we're elevating our prayer to God let us always remember our pastor we're continue with the topic that our pastor has established for the year the spoken word is the Original Seed he already laid down the foundation he already spoke two messages on this the last message from the past year and the first message of the New Year something so something I recommend to each one of us is to be able to go back and listen to what he spoke on many times I tell you it's happened to me I like to take the way I was raised up is I to take notes during the service and I'm constantly taking notes but now there's a problem that many times I don't go back to my notes and what I write down I forget so God is so good with us he says oh my poor children they're so they're so busy so preoccupied that I'm going to help them they don't have to go back to their notes if time I'm going to have them to have I'm going to allow them to have access to the service on their phone back once again so they can listen to it again and so when they're in their car driving instead of thinking things that they shouldn't be thinking on maybe they'll begin to hear the word of God in their car they're Drive 30 to 40 minutes to go to work or do this or the other they could take advantage to drench themselves in my word how good God is with us he gives us that opportunity and many times one says well how am I going to connect myself with my car and so God thought befor said don't worry my son I'm going to advance line so much so that your phone can connect your car you don't have to use Cable in which you're binding yourself I want to turn this way the stuck and now it's all the car's fault and so I'm not going to listen to anything no brother now you don't even need any cables all you have to do is just connect yourself and then you begin to listen the spoken word which is the Original Seed amen amen I don't know if God can make it any simpler than that let us wait on God God always has a surprise now later maybe you just get home you're just going to clap and the speakers will turn on so let us take advantage of what God has for us the spoken word is the Original Seed our pastor read the scripture but he also mentioned another Isaiah 55 this is a very special scripture I'll be reading from verse eight says for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my way says the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and turn not thither but WTH the Earth and make it bring forth and Bud and that it give may give seed to the swer and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing where to I sent it what a tremendous scripture in Isaiah 551 it speaks to that the word that goes forth out of my mouth shall not return void now in Genesis 1 it says that the Earth was without form and void in Isaiah 5511 it says the word that cometh forth of my mouth it will not return void the Earth was without form and void the darkness was dominion over the Earth but the spirit of God and moved on the surface of the water and in that void in that Darkness there was absolutely nothing it was without form and void but then but then God spoke the word and said let there be light God began to project what he desired through his word because Isaiah tells us that each time God speaks it has a purpose for why he send that word the word of God it never goes without a purpose one of the translations of the Bible is God speaks today Isaiah 5511 says the following likewise the word that come out of my lips does not return to me without producing an effect but it does what I desire and fulfills the order which I give it fulfills the order that I give so what the word is telling that when we speak the word is not empty it automatically it will produce an effect because within the word there's a series of instructions within the word there's a series of orders and that word will produce inside of for which I have sent it for now the Earth was without form and vo and God is giving us the key that the spoken word is the Original Seed the prophet tells us in the message the spoken word is the Original Seed he says remember every word of God is the original seed God planted everything on Earth by his word and as long as you stay with the Original Seed she will once again reproduce exactly the same the breeding or mixing of that word produces death now note and this God saw previously he predestinated a world of of sons and daughters he predestinated them to be there the disbelief of the word of God caused hybrid but God has restored it as it was in the beginning so you would no longer have to be a hybrid you can return to the original word and be a Son of God just as it was supposed to be from the beginning so brother brandham when he speaks this message he begins to attack with everything he has over the word of God may be made hybrid the mixture of the word of God with human ideas with personal ideas he says each time the word of God is mixed up it would also produce a result because what the devil looks for is to take the word of God and use the same word of God because he knows that the spoken word is the original and he takes the promise the same word of God and he sends it and he begins speak because it will bring forth in the beginning he took the promise of God and that's how he deceived the woman 99.99% of the word small percentage was was was distorted and with that he brought death that's why brother brandham says the way the way which we will go [Music] back is being able to believe in the word of God not mixing it with our personal thoughts not mixing it with our emotions not mixing it with what we think we have to go to the source to the Eternal Fountain that's why in the beginning the Earth was without form and void God began to unravel the plan he had to wherever there is no order there can come order the only way to bring order in a family where there's disorder in a life that's out of order it's through the spoken word of God because that's the original SE so when God saw the Earth out of form and vo that did not limit God for so we have to understand the time we're living in we don't have to focus on the situation which we find ourselves in because we will never understand what God's plan is as long as we're focusing the situation or the problem in which we find ourselves when God allows for battles and trials to come and we focus on that on that test on that F fight then the purpose of God is not fulfilled because that trial that we may understand of who we are when the test and it looks disorganized it seems like everything is dark that is where we have to start put into practice what we have learned don't try to understand the situation try ask why am in the situation which I find myself because always whenever we look at the circumstances we will never have the revelation of who I am within their circumstance that's the way it is let us look at the problem we're going to see the problem bigger than it is instead of seeing the problem that's smaller that's says for my thoughts are not your thought God has hidden his thoughts so that no one can have access to them he has and he has protected my thoughts are not your thoughts my ways are not like your my thoughts are higher my ways are higher why because you can't walk higher than what you think your path reflects your thoughts if you see a person walking they will reflect in they will reflect their thoughts projected you can't live higher than your confession your confession will never be higher than your thoughts that is why God hid his thoughts and for a long time there was not access to the thoughts of God that's why God he began to condescend and hit and inside of Christ that's why in Christ the prophet came he spoke Christ is the mystery of God revealed because Christ is in the thoughts of God for not to see and understand the thoughts of God we have to see Christ revealed in front of us because Christ he's the mystery of God which have been revealed in this time so we can have access to the thoughts of God so now we can see and understand God's plan in this age in this time and for me as an individual while we focus in the disorder we will never understand God's purpose for our lives while we focus in the problems we have we will never understand what God wants to reveal in us God wants to reveal to Christ Christ the anointing of God Christ the word God wants to use us to reveal his power God wants to use us to reveal his glory but to reveal the word of God and word when we're in a contrary situation we have to go to this written word because that's where the mystery is the revealed word comes it takes the written word it brings it to our heart then the mystery of God begins to open up in our lives when we begin to see that the spirit of God moves on the face of the waters over the people in my situation in my problem God has not forsaken me God is there with me God is always there with us but we have to understand that we're under a test because God is watching our Behavior up to now well at least I have not seen maybe you have that a teacher during a test with the student like no you got that one 5 plus five is 10 not nine the teacher is never there with the student while the student does the test the teacher is just that's when he least speaks what God doesn't talk to me he never answers no God is because God already showed now he's waiting for me to show what I have learned he's given me an opportunity to display his glory I can display who he is that can display his love that can display his Pard I can display his power God is watching that he can manifest what he is what he is through us that's what the trial is for the test is not to destroy a child of is to build and to rest him to to restore him to his original state not to destroy him if you're in a trial if you're in a fight the spirit of God is there with you but what we have to do is is mix the mechanic with the dynamic bring the power of God to manifestation because within that seene there is hidden power will that power to manifest when we begin to use the power of the spoken word that's the only way because then Christ will manifest himself the Myst mystery will begin to be revealed because now it's no longer it is god in me speaking it's no longer me speaking word made flesh BR manifestation GL power of God that is why the prophet said that when the spirit of God would move even though it was out of order even though it was void but he already had within him his thoughts he had an image the only thing that he had to do was to release the that the image would come to manifest that the vision would fulfill he had to speak so the Earth would no longer be without for but God had a purpose because even in that disorder even in that Darkness the prophet say that there was seed was predestinated seed there was God working with a seed he had already created it now it was causing a process to bring the seed to life above our life or our situation it may seem that there's chaos that there's disorder that there's sadness that there's worry that there's loneliness there's incomprehension but in seeing all of that within that life which may seem alone sad again mixed up there is a seed and the spirit of God will bring that seed to life without mattering the conse the uh the the situation that's why within us there is something always crying out there's always a cry that's why in the messages we are listening to on Thursdays The Original Seed crying out for Perfection because within us there is a cry to be able to be perfect because we were perfect we're in a fallen State because of but we're crying out to go back to that Perfection constantly there is a cry within us but we need to make contact with that God have contact through Revelation to understand that this order that there's in our surroundings it's not to destroy us it's to reveal who we truly are Faith always reveals itself when the situation is difficult now when everything is well that's the way it is so the exterior circumstances cannot stop the seed they can't but the seed it has to fight against anxiety against nervousness against stress against depression against bad habits has to fight to get to work early has to fight with his family but the greatest thing he has to fight against himself to be able to manifest the seed now Isaiah 551 55 8-1 my words The New American Bible says in that way will be the word that comes out of my mouth it will not return empty [Music] without realizing what I desire and accomplished the purpose for which I sent it in the New Living Translation of the Bible that that way is my word I sent it and it always produces fruit it always produces fruit so it doesn't matter what you're speaking you're always producing fruits it says it brings forth what I want and prospers wherever I sent it that places a responsibility over to be careful what I speak but in order to know that to be careful of what I speak be careful because you can never speak higher than your thoughts your confession will never be higher than what you think to be able to speak a word with power my thoughts have to reach a level in which I can have the thoughts of God have to speak and be able to say Lord now I understand your thought the only way I can get there and understand the thoughts of God Is by knowing that God has expressed his thoughts throughout the word but the word kills but the spirit quickens so I need to look for the Revelation more than anything else so you may help me Quicken the word that's been so now this word that's been written may be engraved in my heart so now that it's a revealed word so now when you can see it and we can see in our surround now will be Christ speaking and talking through me that is why we need the Revelation because the first step to be able to get to that Lev is that we have to Humble ourselves we don't have to go up we have to go down and understand that each moment in life God will manifest the glory of God in our lives now with our thoughts and our worst that's said my ways are not like your ways because your thoughts are not like my thoughts and our actions will produce habits our habits will form our attitude our habits will form our attitude and our attitude will form our character and our character will take us to a destination Propet said that the Lord Jesus Christ only comes for one thing and that's what he's searching for it's a church with character but that character developed through having a good attitude last time we spoke about the challenge of the present hour is to be able to have a correct attitude towards any promise that God has spoken as we have our attitude we have to look at our our habits uh make up the structure of our we can think one when they become words and actions become you're forming a structure where the Holy Spirit can come and dwell that's why brother bam said when they created a beautiful building it was large it was wonderful and it was be a mum but they were never able to use it no one could go ins because they didn't have a strong enough Foundation the attitude our foundation to be deep our attitude the attitude that we have how do we look at things and we make an effort to look at things in a more POS make an effort to take the word and apply it that is only done through habits when they asked brother brandom one of the greatest things that a Christian could desire is to enter into the love of the Lord amen amen when they asked brother B said God it says what a simple question but so deep how can I enter in more into the love the Lord when I heard brother random answer that question I was like this and my JW dropped like they doing the cartoons that's that's the way I imagined it because the answer was so simple he says let's go to the next question he says read the word and pray said read the word and pray read the word and pray is a verb pray is also a verb they're verbs of action they're habits there are things that we have to do there are things that we have to form as part of our Lives an essential part of our Liv the brother's here so don't forget to pray pray for the food and give thanks for everything don't forget night when we SLE I'm you know I'm very sleepy amen amen it's a [Music] habit a habit is something that will lead you to always do the same thing over and over I have a coworker that he has the Habit he wakes up at midnight almost 3: in the morning and he has a treatment per se he's not sick but it's something he found that would benefit his health he goes into a a water tub every morning with ice cold water plch it's a cold plch and water he's in there six minutes six minutes all that sticks out is his head this morning I tried to do it when I was going to shower not go into the water but just turn on the cold water you could hear my yell throughout the whole house if anything was about 5 Seconds that was it that's something crazy but for him it became a habit it's something that's healthy he's happy and he's seeing the results so that's the way habits are and that that wakes him up at 3 in the morning of having a purpose that's why many times when people get up late for me that I see is that they don't have a purpose in life they don't have a reason for which to get up they get up at 10 in the morning and they say my day just doesn't last how's it going to last if you wake up almost at midday something else let us continue with the theme the prophet said I'll begin to close and everything under control in the message God's power to transform to bring forth its kind now remember to bring when he put the seed in the Earth the seed can only come forth with the power of life within it to transform it from a seed to a plant or whatever it was his transforming power now God put the seed in there with potentials that it would be what he said it would be and as long as it stayed in its right C it would be just exactly what God said it would be it had to be that way because he had made it that way and made a channel that anything that says in his channel in his line of word it will have to bring forth exactly like his word said it would do it cannot move from there it's channeled just exactly right so with everything and the trust in his own son that it would be that way then God said it's all good so I'll just rest and each one of those seeds has power in itself to transform itself into the species that I desire it to be each seed within itself has the power for itself to transform it doesn't have to wait for someone to come trans have the power in itself to begin to transform itself all it has to do is to understand position an eternal seed in this time to manifest the glory of God not to beest is to be restored any difficult situation it's not to destroy God in yourself have the opportunity to be part of the plan of God I say now I am walking in the age of I have heard the voice that tells me my son come up higher and I will show you other things which you have never heard I reveal something you've never seen I will tell you Christ is the mystery of God revealed I'm going to tell you my plan that I want to live within you I desire to be in your heart that I don't care simply listen and Obey what I have to tell you when Abraham received the benefit of the spoken word he was going to sacrifice his son he had to do what he did not desire to but his obedience took him to fulfill what God he was with pain he was with heartbreak but he had to obey the word which was spoken to him the word was spoken he God the Eternal God had required a sacrifice and Abraham he placed in the line of the word in the right channel I don't desire to do this but you are powerful you gave them to me you give him amongst the dead so I know you have the power to bring him back to life The Obedience of abrah he was about to sacrifice his son a ram appeared where there could be no Rams there was no way for a ram to appear in that place but the spoken word It produced through Abraham a manifestation of God and Abraham said now he will be Jehovah Jehovah will provide because the sacrifice obedience the power of the spoken word to be manifested The Obedience that goes against thought even against himself but he was loyal you say if God took it away God promised it he gave me a vision he told me that my descendant be like the stars in the sky he told me he says look at the vision can you see the stars can you count the the the sand in the sea no lord I can't so that where your lineage will be with your son with Isaac so then he knew that God could not go against his own word if he sacrificed his son his son would have to come back to life that's the power of the spoken word but to be able to bring it to manifestation there has to be a structure in the human heart there to be a desire a crying out to obey God against my own thoughts that's where the power of the spoken word manifest not in our complaints no no but in the Revelation that God is Almighty and he will bring it to manifestation what he promised that's it period i mix the word with my own thoughts mix the word with the anointing of L I will stay The Original Seed because the Original Seed is the spoken word in the spoken word has power it has power it has to manifest itself through Christ now I have to decide I'm going to let that word to manifest itself within me I'll be finishing if the musicians can come forward said brother Bram says in the message the future home of the Heavenly groom and the Earthly bride preached in 1964 now talking about the Samaritan woman he says that woman she was a prostitute she was all stained but deep inside of her there was a little bit of understanding I know that when the Messiah comes that's all that she knew she was a prostitute brother Bram has said that from very young her parents had cast her out when she was 18 years old she had her personal Encounter With Jesus she was 18 years old in St John 4 [Music] that was there but that little young lady even though she had that understanding she had nothing to offer or present she was a worldly filthy woman filthier than you can think of but notice said brother brandham within her she had representation in that disorder in that [Music] Darkness AC every C there was an eternal seed there was presentation she was Desiring in her heart that the promise of the Messiah be made flesh she said Lord you not be El like the religious say the religious had the same opportunity to have that experience with Christ the word access to the hidden thoughts of God through Christ the anointed the word but they rejected it the religious rejected it and this woman that had nothing to offer said Lord I perceive that thou are a prophet now now we know that the mes called the Christ shall come and when he comes he will do these things he said said I am and she she had no doubts she had no [Music] doubt he did not have to explain she saw him she believed it and she went with the word of the hour [Music] why why did she do Happ to her what is it that happened he redeemed her he came to be a redeemer and what does redeem mean it means to bring back heing he came to redeem her in her disaster and her disorder with an empty heart with a a life pie with a sick life was eternal seed when the Eternal seed contact with the Messiah the word anointing of God once again the spirit of God moving brought to manifestation etal seed that was inside of that woman he came to redeem that what was lost and that woman she had been binded up she got caught up in all the things of the Fall she was all caught up but God had her in his thoughts God had her in his thoughts before the foundation of
