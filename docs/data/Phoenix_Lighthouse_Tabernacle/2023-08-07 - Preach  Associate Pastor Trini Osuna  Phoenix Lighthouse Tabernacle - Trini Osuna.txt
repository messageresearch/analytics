before you yeah I don't know if you can understand what I'm gonna say there's a saying oh you don't like soup can you get another Bowl is this morning I'd like to greet you every one of you we have any visitors may you receive a double welcome I'd like to know every one of you by name it's difficult brother Paul would tell me that I had a very good memory that's when I was 27 years old I still have a decent memory I don't know but not like the one I used to have when I was younger before we begin I'd like to thank my pastor for the trust me once again of course for me it's a little difficult to be up here but I do it with much joy and with revelation I see people here that I love very much Junior a few days ago my wife showed me a picture it's brother Paul Sergio and myself edamus we're very close to brother Paul Pandora when I see people which you love very much you don't you feel it uncomfortable at all I know I love him I know he loves me too this morning I'd like to speak a little about three weeks ago I found my lot to speak on this uh message before we begin like to ask if you could please stand and we'll be praying Heavenly Father once again we thank you for all things asking that you be with us and everyone who is hearing us we love you and need you we're always thinking on our people that watch us via the Internet my brothers in San Luis Rio Colorado sometimes he says in Colombia may be difficult with the time change but father wherever they see us may you be with us and with them also help us we ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ taking advantage that we're standing we'll be reading our scripture for right now I'll be reading one scripture Mark chapter 16 verse 15. and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature may the Lord has blessings to the reading of his word you mean take your seats told you about three weeks ago felt my law to speak on this message I think I went over it pretty quick today I'd like to calm down a little more and give a few definitions okay we read the scripture that I'm gonna stay with the word preach ER and live here because I have a few notes when I began to jot down my message I write it on a page then transfer to another page and try to search out each word I went up to the sixth grade in Mexico as you may understand I'm not too educated I know we have very well-educated people here when it comes to finding the words when I read them and don't understand them I'll understand them more or less then I go to the dictionary to preach means to publish or manifest something to deliver a sermon representative to rebuke admonish to scold and the one I like the most is preaching must be accompanied by practice uh [Music] my sons tell me that they're not going to understand what this is a practice makes perfect so brother Manny and brother Gershon playing the saxophone to admonish is to warn a person just goal is to show anger to rebuke in practice skill acquired with this exercise so what you know what you know how to do with practice you'll produce uh you become a teacher of it and from there we get experience a definition when we read the definition of what it is to preach and when we read the scripture when we read the scripture normally we believe it's the person that stands behind the pulpit to preach and I believe it's for all of us stand back here and preacher my brother Branham brings it closer to home and brings it all together he preached the message that God had explained [Music] and that's where he includes us all in Chicago Illinois priest on the 25th of April 1961 in Chicago Illinois page one in the uh paragraph three I'm going to read it as it is in Spanish you know it's better to leave me a sermon than preach me one anytime and we would hear this quite often images I respect so everyone who stands here behind the pulpit and the ones that go out and preach ERS with me by God's grace I was able to go on the missionary field quite a bit with brother Paul and I've been able to go with brother Montoya also and it's not easy uh has been my friend for many years but he doesn't have any buddies so traveling with him brother Branham vcse says the following this is in the Army when you're in the military they don't ask you you want to peel potatoes they tell you peel potatoes like that more or less he doesn't tell us what we'll be doing I was able to go to Peru with him and I was able to greet the Brethren there brother Paul is so when we say where we come from when I step behind the pulpit to greet our brothers I told my I told them that this was the best investment my family and myself have done the act of being able to go to Peru Colombia because when I say go to Peru or Colombia in Africa go to Africa well the more I mentioned these trips the more expensive they are younger then I looked at him I said okay I'll go with you it was a blessing not only for myself but for all of my family is uncle Danny brother Danny um I remember who else it was an unforgettable experience when we've gone just about all of us that are here if something if we've learned something how to treat people like this there's three conventions three meetings I would like you for always Phoenix Arizona and here in Phoenix Arizona the first time I went to Chalco Elementary Martinez because I get embarrassed when I see you later Phoenix Arizona you've never failed to be there in Phoenix Arizona's convention and also more or less hardly ever come here so he embraced me hugged me and told me yes that's what helps me keep pressing on so we do struggle sometimes you know in normal but that's normal is what I'm saying you know it's better to leave me a sermon than preach me one anytime here we're preaching with a tie on but the majority of you see my Sunday just sees my Sunday face you won't see me on Monday or Tuesday so don't bother him on Mondays brother Bernie would say that was his worst day also that doesn't only happen to brother Montoya last week foreign I like to read it here a pistol reign in our hearts known and read of all men sister if you read the scripture and you read a little bit of before it or after it would see the Apostle Paul is saying recommendations because they were asking for letter recommendations of the people he was sending you are letters what do you need any more foreign one of the definitions in the dictionary it's to be honored to be honored honest I'm sorry to be honest that's one of the definitions of an epistle is to be honest uh problemas but I want to give my son any more problems for he was helping me type this up they're not going to understand that so we'll write it this way foreign I know brother Bernie says for him to preach yes it's like having a slice of cake well there's some people that can do it but he would also say okay one of the most difficult of offices is to be a pastor he says the following I just heard it last week on the message he preached at three stages of Grace he says many people think that I go and Pat people on the back and people think I do that people that believe that brother Bernie says let's see let's let them listen to 10 of my messages and see if I'm that way or not foreign to understand it you have to love brother Montoya very much foreign [Music] a message they conduct hours questions and answers on COD book s and Spanish is paragraph 11. I've read it before I like to read it again what it is that I'm speaking brother Branham says the following is now I was talking to a man this week a very prominent businessman in the city who said to me about going back into Africa and India and he and he said why they just got through killing a British general over there I said what's that got to do with me he said you can going back over there where all that murder is going on all that race riot and so forth he asked sure that's where I'm needed what the Lord wants me to go he said what if they kill you he said yes I said well if God wants me to be killed I'll just be killed that's all cuando when one goes on the missionary field in in Houston we were in Houston that's difficult tengo I'm 70 years old he is sometimes I tell my children when I'm here in the casket hey don't make the funeral service so long I want it short the first one that says something is my daughter don't say that I have to okay sooner or later it's gonna follow my life so when I saw smoke coming out the plane what am I getting into pero uh I told you it was a blessing uh when brother Branham preaches this message the token is on the first of September of 1963 at Brandon Tabernacle Indiana Jeffersonville Indiana I'm going to talk about Mom this is Brother Branham says the following you know when I see little fellows like that it takes me back when I was a little boy foreign foreign and you know the old saying is you know they on your feet now and your heart later okay but I don't believe it'll be so when we dedicate them to the Lord we have a responsibility here is this in your hand he made a preacher out of you said about women preachers you know but every mother is a preacher congression here is her congregation to raise these little fellows right while that is working and you've got a responsibility God bless you both he's here talking to Mom but also to that is to raise these little fellows right well that is working says God bless you both I read what it is to preach and also uh it's also falls on Mom you say reply to rebuke I'm going to start admonish it's cold this is that's the job of mom and dad preaching must be accompanied by practice foreign yeah so I wanted to talk about these definitions again here brother Brown was talking about Dad's at work you have that responsibility God bless you both I'm Mexican I was the type of people I would say that the woman shouldn't work when I came to the U.S is my wife began to work I didn't want her to but I would admire the husbands which wives did not work I want to marry the wife how they're able to do it to work and have the house uh the way they do okay have the house the way you do yeah raise the kids the way you're raising them here brother Ben was speaking about mom what I was speaking about that Esposa my wife worked at a sewing company we work in the same Factory I wouldn't work in the cutting the Garment and she would be in the sewing the Garment part is doing my part at home I got to be honest admire the wife so much uh didn't ask me to speak with how they raise their children how they uh how about the husband and um out of town uh I help them on a missionary trip to help him get his clothes ready my wife if it wasn't for her I have mismatched socks uh foreign are her children I congratulations there's longer larger congregations smaller congregations it's a very difficult job for moms and he has to work and without complaining because that's what fell every one of our Lives I told you my respects for every every moment I wanted to mention this is saying every mother is a preacher and her congregation are her sons and daughters you know there were sisters that wanted to preach I'm going to say let's hope you don't take it wrong brother Bernie was safe from the pulpit is if it would be permitted for women to preach we have tremendous preachers heard it before you have much respect to our sisters the message here okay that I've read before but I'd like to read it again brother prison the 19th of April of 1959. speaking of a Preacher speaking here of a Preacher Temple is in paragraph 160 in Spanish I thought why didn't they put some of them young fellows up here to preach the place was packed and jammed and I thought why didn't they do that so this old fellow instead of preaching what was going on down here on Earth he began to preach what was going on in heaven all the time well he took him up at the beginning the beginning of time and brought him back in the second coming down to the horizontal rainbow I had never heard such a preaching in my life senor parents about that time the spirit hit him and he began to jump that high and clicked his heels together foreign you open say s and I thought that'll make an old man act that like that yes he's too weird and me what would it do if it got on me I thought maybe I need some of that is right he come out there I felt so sorry for that old fellow valenciano for the out for the old fellow for me but when he left I felt sorry for myself and I looked at him I go off there that is so some people have the gift of preaching yeah some of us don't have it like I told you at the beginning yeah oh you don't like this soup I'm gonna give you another one I go back to when I was a young fellow in my town yeah that's my math they're mothers they would make a soup and we had to eat it I want to say Mom I don't like onion I don't like tomato so you're eating it yeah end of story so those were the old-fashioned moms no forgive me for what I'm going to say our children have a restaurant at home one says I want pancakes some sandwich the other one says I want a sandwich they got a restaurant at home and not only the the sons what will grandparents not do for their grandchildren would get upset jump and Shout we want our children to be happy for our grandchildren to be happy even though we may struggle a little bit but in our days 1960. I wouldn't want to say this to my brethren um so to my brothers and sisters in the flesh and my first eight years we're the most happiest years of my life I didn't know what it was I never knew I was born maybe I didn't even have sandals but we never lacked anything and we never liked any food when my wife and I got married my family yeah we got there with my dad and my my stepmom he and uh the Greece ran out my dad killed a pig we need a beans or corn we had some there in the storehouse we wanted uh some pumpkins would go out to the to the theater yeah on the season of of of of the vegetables so there was always something to eat that's why I tell you my first eight years of life we're very happy for myself I have nothing bad to say about San Luis I got there when I was eight years old when I was eight years old it wasn't such a difficult job I sold candy selling used clothes and about 13 years old I started working at this job where I made good money my son is not going to understand this word I I was a Bookseller on the streets India I saw the Daily Newspaper there in San Luis yeah I was never embarrassed of doing that but at 13 years old I made as much as anybody who would have a regular job but like I told you is very nice so when I go back over there foreign that's where I learned to work but let me tell you okay that I thought I worked hard in San Luis I work in a company who dug a holes for for a water in the kitchen for water irrigation thank you so that's what I would do and I made very good money I did work very hard when I came here to the U.S I said by God would I get myself into um my brother-in-law Brothers he got me work at a butcher shop here in the U.S yes you work much more difficult [Music] no I thought I worked hard in Mexico no you work hard here at all one works hard and you have it all but you have to pay for everything I had a co-worker he says sickness only lasts three days so in Mexico you'd get a permission to not be at work for the whole week I hear you quit working three days and the bills just keep stacking up after three days that's how it is here nothing wrong to say about Mexico or no also not nothing wrong about the U.S we all have to work yeah one may think that your job is harder than the other way I'll go with him one day to see if it's that easy so jobs here are difficulties I wanted to finish saying this okay and we want the best for them God bless you [Applause] stand up for a minute please I'm not going to take too long we have some praying to do this morning first of all now you can take your seats he didn't tell you everything again I'm military so if I tell you to do something I'm going to tell you once then I'm not going to say anything um that's the way I was brought up he said he was oh he left no Safe Way eight years old when he really started working I was 16. and my parents belonged to the military the following day on my 17th birthday I had no hair I had some baggy pants and they called me an animal I was worse than an animal so it's I started very young now I am what I am if you call it discipline discipline because of that background but I always learned one thing what I wore I wore okay and uh so that people can get ready I was in Lima Peru Lima Peru and actually it was in Lima it was I'll just say it was Peru yeah and a brother started putting on his clothes the other brother about that well he goes into the closet puts on the clothes his suit came up the jacket oh my beautiful wife oh she's so great she brought me a brand new suit she didn't have time to tailor it oh look at these pants are so nice well the other brother he gets out of the shower looks at the brothers that's my clothes the brother put on the wrong clothes everything was the same color a navy blue suit Marino and uh so I turned around and said you better check all your clothes to see if he didn't take anything else and I I wanted you to laugh the young people start coming in but it's something that when you're in the mission field you eat what they give you whatever they assign you to do we do it without being upset we do everything according to what our Apostle taught us very obedientes and one of the things that brother Bernie used to do a lot you're a beautiful young lady that's my granddaughter uh would line up all the oh you're beautiful too we want it I would line up the kids and would pray for each uh child that was going to enter the school system not only are we going to pray for for these young people starting school it's a different culture all schools are different they have their different rules foreign and what I want is uh if you're a teacher and you're in the audience what I want you to do is just stand over here on this side because we're going to be praying for you because it today it's hard to be a teacher nobody appreciates teachers it's my understanding uh years back when the students will shoot the teachers and we started looking this is what's happening uh you get a a disturbed student life is not what he thought you know let me check it out you know I'm glad God gave me my vision but you know Sunday school teachers are the same you know they should be yeah the reason I say is because we all have a job to perform foreign School teachers you need to be up here it's very important now if you're a student and you're in high school you're in college you ought to come up here the reason I say it because it's hard it's hard to be a student there's so much influence out there that influence that's out there it's called friendships when we have friends they can lead us astray and what we want and we want to make sure that as a church the lighthouse has a culture and that culture is the Lord Jesus Christ I was a Sunday school superintendent for many years and I understand one thing that somebody has to teach them Christian values it's not up to them to correct themes they should come to school Sunday school I'm prepared obedientes respectful so this is what we look at because tomorrow is Trini said brother you have ministers here you have song leaders here a few future pastures you have future wives of ministers here and we want to upbring them in a Christian environment so we're going to pray and what I want you to do is as we pray remember those that aren't here family members prayer goes a long way I believe in prayer that's one of our our weapons that we have our enemies train a child the way you should go and when it is the Sunday School teachers have given them grateful for them and I'm grateful for you as parents so let's pray Evelyn father we we thank you for this day this is their Resurrection we have no one to thank but you know want to thank teachers today public Educators Sunday school teachers for their part an upbringing these little ones those that are in second in high school those that are in college we also ask that you guide them I mean they protect them always allow them to remember the words do your part living the way you should live and then ask God to do his part God will do it he'll honor your words Father Here we are bless the little ones allow them to open their mind understanding of what is being taught we have mathematicians here we have Engineers here we have everything that a person could ever want to you we're grateful so continue blessing us blessing these children blessing is young people blessing the teachers bless the parents so father we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ 2023 2024. that are children can be a reflection of the Gospel of Jesus Christ so father we thank you In The Name Of The Lord let's give them a big dinner again remember without these kids this is our future generation without teachers teaching them how can they learn how can they preach with their life without having examples so we are the examples this morning do these little ones we are examples to our friends our neighbors of what Christians should be Cristiano and it's a great life being a Christian because we know one thing we have eternal life how many have eternal life we all have eternal life that germ was placed there when you were baptized thank you I'm not gonna say too much and I I want Danny to come up here accordia all right I I believe that with all my heart God bless you um [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] said let's
