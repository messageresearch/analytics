[42:35] how can I overcome
[42:40] a topic that I feel has no ends
[42:46] you can always be blessed by what it
[42:48] says
[42:51] because we always need help
[42:54] we're always being tried
[42:59] to be tried until the last day we're on
[43:01] this Earth amen brothers

[43:09] to see who are the true children of God
[43:11] amen amen
[43:29] within us
[43:40] not get in his way amen
[43:43] is
[43:45] I was telling a bit on this topic
[43:50] I heard a little bit of a message from
[43:52] Brother Branham
[43:55] how can I overcome okay Colin
[43:57] Jeffersonville preaching Jeffersonville
[43:59] a
[44:01] foreign
[44:56] is against you than to overcome you must
[44:59] recognize that the god in you is
[45:03] greater and mightier than he is
[45:09] already overcome him
[45:23] There's real overcoming
[45:25] [Music]
[45:27] important
[45:31] I was saying that why it's so important
[45:33] that part of recognizing the tricks of
[45:34] the devil
[45:37] because we know how in any fight or any
[45:40] battle Los contricantes the two both
[45:43] sides
[45:44] they study one another
[45:47] [Music]
[45:49] the devil probably knows us better than
[45:51] we know ourselves
[45:53] [Music]
[46:11] is going to use your family
[46:14] you can use your co-worker or your
[46:16] friend at work
[46:18] you can use whatever thing
[46:21] so you may fall
[46:25] I'm in
[46:27] Brothers
[46:29] when we are prepared
[46:32] it's just like any other exam or test
[46:35] once we see the test
[46:38] we recognize it yes
[46:41] you're already sure of what you have to
[46:43] do is
[46:44] they were not sure
[47:12] amen Brothers
[47:15] so it's very important Siempre
[47:18] siemprestanto to always be ready you
[47:22] will always be alert
[47:23] because when we least expect it that's
[47:27] when the devil attacks amen amen
[47:30] and we continue reading here
[47:35] usted
[47:37] when you recognize you look back and say
[47:47] and I'm doing that
[47:50] [Music]
[48:03] Jesus to them which are in Christ Jesus
[48:10] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[48:15] then you realize that you've overcome
[48:20] Diablo and you know that he's a devil
[48:23] usted Grandes
[48:28] [Music]
[48:50] okay
[48:53] greater I see that is in you
[48:56] then he that is in the world
[49:01] you must realize that the Holy Spirit
[49:05] has already overcome this thing is
[49:10] and you can overcome by him
[49:17] [Music]
[49:34] [Music]
[50:12] if it doesn't matter anymore Lord Jesus
[50:14] Christ
[50:15] why would it matter to you
[50:20] just worry about what is what matters to
[50:23] the Lord Jesus Christ
[50:25] no longer listen to that voice in your
[50:27] mind
[50:30] don't start listening when you remember
[50:32] those mistakes you've made in the past
[50:35] that's what's important
[50:37] you have to keep moving forward
[50:39] and continue
[50:45] it's more from the Lord Jesus Christ
[50:49] that's when we received that Revelation
[50:51] Brothers
[50:52] man amen
[50:57] the people so live can live a clean life
[50:59] limpia clean since
[51:03] holy life not being sinful adulterers
[51:07] and drinkers
[51:10] gamblers
[51:13] they can live above above that is
[51:21] [Music]
[51:33] were the chemicals of his body
[51:37] what was in him
[51:40] first under justification is the water
[51:44] baptism
[51:47] under the new birth of Wesley
[51:50] sanctification sanctification local
[51:53] Olympia which cleanses
[51:57] and thirdly under the baptism of the
[52:00] Holy Spirit
[52:02] putting that Sanctified vessel into
[52:04] service men
[52:07] the word sanctify significa is
[52:15] sanctify means it's a compound Greek
[52:18] word which means cleaned and set aside
[52:19] for service
[52:25] aside for service now the Holy Spirit
[52:27] puts it in service amen Hermanos
[52:32] but that's because we all want to do our
[52:34] part
[52:38] I know I know at least myself
[52:41] when I see at work
[52:43] [Music]
[52:46] I see that everybody's moving
[52:48] everybody's doing something
[53:00] and slow them down
[53:02] foreign
[53:07] [Music]
[54:02] at some point
[54:07] we're reading a little bit about the
[54:09] life of brother Branham
[54:13] um
[54:17] where he talks about the stomach
[54:19] problems he was having this
[54:22] is everything he would eat would just
[54:24] come back up
[54:26] I believe it's like an acid reflux
[54:31] the doctor said his stomach was full of
[54:33] ulcers
[54:40] you only drink prune juice and barley
[54:43] water yeah and that was for months
[54:48] he says he couldn't eat anything else
[54:51] it's something very uncomfortable
[54:55] and when he got to the Lord Jesus Christ
[54:58] he asked for his healing the
[55:02] immediately
[56:12] now you apply that in your life
[56:16] any problem you may be going through or
[56:18] feeling
[56:19] maybe you already prayed for it
[56:22] if you're a pretty friend you already
[56:24] received your healing
[56:27] now you have to confess
[56:30] without mattering or taking or worrying
[56:33] about the symptoms
[56:41] not mattering whatever the scientist may
[56:43] say
[57:05] sooner or later
[57:07] when the devil knows
[57:14] he can no longer get you from that angle
[57:17] the symptoms will go away amen amen
[57:21] amen
[57:24] he
[57:27] is
[57:31] in a few minutes I'll be finishing up
[57:39] I always think of the story in the Bible
[57:41] of Lazarus
[57:44] when we feel like there's no longer time
[57:48] Esperanza we feel like there's no more
[57:50] hope
[57:52] we feel like we've made too many
[57:54] mistakes already
[57:57] that we're already in the Brock bottom
[58:00] [Music]
[58:05] let us know
[58:07] okay Siempre t
[58:11] uh
[58:13] we start to think those things is
[58:19] when God begins to warm up
[58:25] that's when he stands up
[58:29] when he sees that we're trying and
[58:31] trying is
[58:34] when you see that the doctors have
[58:36] already given up
[58:49] I am the specialist
[58:52] and then when
[58:54] we see that story
[58:59] Jesus arriving
[59:02] to see Lazarus
[59:27] and my brother would be alive
[59:34] [Music]
[59:49] [Music]
[59:54] he was standing and completely trusting
[59:56] in God
[59:58] then Jesus says
[1:00:01] just take me where Lazarus is
[1:00:08] in his grave
[1:00:10] he said
[1:00:13] he says Lazarus to get up
[1:00:16] is
[1:00:18] becomes to come back to life
[1:00:20] is
[1:00:24] already spent time several days dead is
[1:00:28] he already had worms in his body okay
[1:00:34] to bring somebody back to life at that
[1:00:37] stage
[1:00:38] it's something impossible for science
[1:00:41] it's something impossible for the human
[1:00:43] mind
[1:00:46] that's the problem that sometimes we
[1:00:48] have
[1:00:59] you can't use our natural mind but uh uh
[1:01:04] you talk about the things of God or to
[1:01:07] have faith
[1:01:12] because you're always going to collide
[1:01:14] there was going to fight against each
[1:01:15] other
[1:01:26] please stand
[1:01:32] yes
[1:01:34] yes
[1:01:35] um
[1:01:41] it's something that God is always
[1:01:43] telling his children
[1:01:45] that you trust in him
[1:01:54] they only have a few days left to live
[1:01:59] uh cancer or they tell you you have
[1:02:01] cancer is
