[30:41] here
[31:15] a friend selected to manage the pastoral
[31:18] work of a congregation to which he
[31:20] belongs
[31:23] that's one of the reasons
[31:26] why i have not placed pastors
[31:30] i could have
[31:43] i believe that one should raise up from
[31:45] there
[31:47] from the congregation
[31:49] a friend
[31:53] and that friend
[31:54] [Music]
[31:55] is selected
[31:57] to manage
[32:08] manager
[32:26] now
[32:28] forget it third base nothing
[32:35] the ball game comes
[32:38] john doe didn't show up
[32:41] this day
[32:44] because
[32:47] they want to have the managers a puppet
[32:50] manager
[32:51] but the manager's place to manage and
[32:53] the people the team
[32:55] i mean is that right
[32:57] i'm here amen
[33:04] over here
[33:05] okay over here

[34:34] ready
[34:37] recall
[34:40] promote promo
[34:43] uh
[35:00] no wonder that people don't want to have
[35:01] a pastor
[35:04] look it up in the dictionary
[35:14] what
[35:28] take away his office
[36:24] is that right
[36:38] a trustee is one to whom something isn't
[36:41] trusted
[36:44] and the holy ghost
[36:47] has entrusted the pastor
[36:51] the souls of allah
[37:47] luther could bring nothing but sprigs
[38:59] within about three years they start an
[39:01] organization
[39:04] the nomination starts at our
[39:05] organization
[39:06] but have you noticed

[40:58] it would deceive the very genes
[41:00] predestinated the elect the elected one
[41:03] if it was possible
[42:01] seed laying there
