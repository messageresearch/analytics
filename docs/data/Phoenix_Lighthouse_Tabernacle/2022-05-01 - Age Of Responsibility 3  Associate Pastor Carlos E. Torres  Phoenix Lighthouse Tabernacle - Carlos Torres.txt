when i think [Music] [Music] [Music] hallelujah oh hallelujah [Music] of jesus [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] foreign foreign foreign foreign [Music] oh [Music] [Music] hey man [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] foreign um [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] christ amen amen amen [Music] this beautiful morning before anything else let's go directly foreign neither by the blood of bulls and god and calves by by his own blood he entered once for the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of the heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctified impearables conscience how much more shall the blood of christ whom through the eternal spirit over him offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from death works to serve the living god and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament that is by means of death for the redemption of transgressions that under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance amen amen you may be seated brothers in the castle [Music] but this we when the people of god worship the lord calls us things happen things happen amen before continuing i'd like to thank our pastor for the opportunity he gives us this morning he's currently out of town let us keep him in our prayers we were out for a week out of the country and then he continues with the labor that corresponds to him he had to go out of town the again thing we can do is pray for each other every one of the members in the tabernacle every one of them very very special brothers we also extend greetings to the brothers every one of them sends special greetings to every one of you yes [Music] [Music] the same holy spirit that shares this morning never send every one of those places congratulations [Music] month we have a lot of birthdays people may be like to be born in may ivarios we have a couple of birthdays here the month of may i i i hermanos [Music] god has what the word reveals [Music] the revelation of the sacrifice the revelation [Music] what must i do to fulfill the works of god the word tells us to believe on whom he has sent the church age that spirit out of god's mouth god spewed out because of the condition that i was in yes and that's the age that we live in now but this sage is constantly pulling on us to pull us to the condition of the age to the spirit that dominates constantly calling us to involve us it covers leave the spirit of trying to become a victim aside i'm trying to blame others for the condition that we find ourselves in us many times it's my it's his fault because of the condition that i find myself in mentors as long as the person doesn't understand that change is a decision emotional they build a house upon the rock and the other one upon the sand mate according to matthew 7 and luke 6. unafuelaca difference once the store comes where you're built upon the rocker upon the sand to build upon the sand is to build upon the circumstances but to build upon the rockets to build upon the revelation many times we're building upon something and we're we're building upon the past when faith is not based upon the quicksands of thoughts of man that's the reason matthias he says but sometimes we build upon perception when we build upon perceptions we're building upon what i think mi proper interpretation my a spiritual to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god mr corazon established traumas different things and that have built are or the way that we are no we can't build upon that because according to what we saw we needed to dig to get all that out a september sacrificio accepting the sacrifice and to start off building a pond of revelation the characteristics how are we going to build a spiritual house meditation we spoke last time about a prayer and meditation an outstanding teacher once told us you'll be above 90 at the not just of this class and repetition to repeat certain things the revelation of what god wants to tell us to write down descriptions write down these things and i challenge you for a month to read the scriptures continue with this principles daily the building of this house will be through all prayer and meditation our spiritual house will grow upon prayer and meditation we can't grow we don't have a plan we don't have a plan we'll just be surviving just going with the floor why is prayer and meditation so important because prayer connects me together meditation now last time we spoke on the scriptures of matthew and mark [Music] estos how was it in matthew 7 7 somebody shall receive [Music] [Music] for absolutely for example for example how many would be interested if somebody would tell tomorrow i'll give you 10 million dollars nobody in the morning so what's more important your life or the 10 million dollars then we'll see how much our life is solicited supplication is you're trying to apply to solicit something it's a request with an objective it's tied in with that with desperation with desperation your you as a father put yourself in the situation a beggar comes and asks for something now your son comes and begs for something maybe at the beggar you'll give something that you have over hustle but your son you're going to give him something because he's yours because he's your son nosotros as we are supplication with thanksgiving action difference it's the action of thanksgiving that gives us grace generally if i ask for the classes we're going to be thankful after we received it thanking him for our he still was principles he walked putting by practice the principles given by god yes that's what made the promise come to manifestation we prayed [Music] i started because we're changing the way we think [Applause] and is i am the i want to see the glory of god i want to i need to advance my spiritual do according to it all and what is written therein for then thou thou shalt make thy way prosperous and thou shall have great success i'm going to meditate on the word of god i'm going to take up this crisis there are yes the guard wants to use us to produce a change a change in our family i change your home change at work you want someone else's that we find ourselves in asia no apply it spiritually now responsibility we must take up the risk we're going to put by works what for you have not received the spread of bondage against fear and the spirit itself that testimonial spiritual inherit witness with our that we may also be glorified together foreign look at the times [Applause] i don't care what's going on i don't know what's going on is [Applause] [Applause] that the buying formula according to revelations is this are you an event there's an event there's an uh an answer to the event and then we're gonna achieve a result the result isn't going to be positive because my answer would be positive muchas versus many times i problemas there are problems the results the answer that we give to them what's going to affect the result the answer is this is the divine my father my mother decisions based on the word of god amen amen that's the key if we put it by works god will open up the way wherever we're at please stand if the enemy is telling you a lie [Music] and he's trying to tell you that you're sick [Music] because by his stripes we have been healed [Music] if our spiritual health was built upon [Music] fundamentals knock all that down and start from the bottom of the foundation start going spiritually based on the revelations [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] in their body jesus christ forgive [Music] [Music] [Music] everyone [Applause] [Music] think about his goodness [Music] think about his grace [Music] our father's love [Music] think about his love think about his love hallelujah [Music] me [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] once more think about islam [Music] hallelujah
