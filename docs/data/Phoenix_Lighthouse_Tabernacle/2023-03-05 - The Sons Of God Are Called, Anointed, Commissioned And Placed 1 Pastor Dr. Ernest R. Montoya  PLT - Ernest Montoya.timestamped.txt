[48:42] foreign
[49:12] we're bringing Souls into Christ
[49:19] o
[49:23] sisters
[49:46] start looking at man when I started
[49:49] looking at myself
[49:52] I'm telling myself
[49:57] are there spots in my face is
[50:05] spotless this morning
[50:08] if the Rapture was to come today
[50:17] but if it was to come
[50:19] are we spotless enough
[50:25] foreign
[50:54] now look and say
[50:57] from your heart if you look what a
[51:00] person or not
[51:02] because there's too many of us
[51:08] and we can't wake up
[51:10] everything is in order right now
[51:15] every nation is where they should be
[51:18] today
[51:20] the prophecy is being fulfilled within
[51:24] our eyes
[51:31] we have no time
[51:33] the time is gone
[51:38] I've heard that word
[51:42] since 1977.
[51:45] part of 1977.
[51:51] but time is at hand
[51:54] everything
[51:56] that brother Brennan said today
[52:04] so I tell myself I must speak to myself
[52:08] am I perfect am I am
[52:12] I in a perfect
[52:18] statements
[52:22] this body was meant it was designed to
[52:28] have the Holy Spirit in us
[52:36] we will be made perfect
[52:43] my concern is
[52:46] Am I Living Clean
[52:51] I tell you if
[52:53] from the heart from my heart
[52:58] or am I living with isms
[53:01] is my heart clean or am I living with
[53:04] isms
[53:09] and the reason I say isms well this
[53:12] person believes this this person
[53:14] believes that that person believes
[53:18] and let me tell you during a fellowship
[53:22] there's many Islams
[53:26] I heard one brother one says
[53:30] brother preached a great sermon sermon
[53:36] and then the other brother wanted to you
[53:38] know undercut
[53:41] and under the table hit him
[53:46] uh you had a tremendous message he said
[53:51] but how many times should I be born
[53:53] again
[53:56] my Ministry this is what the brother was
[53:59] telling this other brother
[54:04] isms ismos
[54:07] to be born every day
[54:10] not one time every day I need to be born
[54:14] again remember words
[54:17] I think wrongly
[54:20] I judge wrongly who's going
[54:23] correctamente I feel sick I'm infected
[54:28] mentally with the wrong Spirit
[54:32] that's why we die daily
[54:36] you gotta get rid of that stuff that is
[54:40] hindering us
[54:45] is there anyone here
[54:49] that doesn't worry about that stuff that
[54:52] we're so clean and pious
[54:58] that hey well you know he's talking
[54:59] about himself not me I'm talking about
[55:02] us
[55:05] I heard the other day hearing a message
[55:12] and then it was brother Branham
[55:16] speaking and all of a sudden I went back
[55:19] to what brother Bernie had said
[55:26] you see brother Brenham said when the
[55:28] church
[55:31] is born again he didn't say when an
[55:36] individual was born he said when the
[55:38] church is born again
[55:42] I had to go back to 1981.
[55:45] you know
[55:47] when the church was born again
[55:52] but my concern has always been I could
[55:55] have been born again in 1981. I could
[55:58] have been born again
[56:01] I could have been born in the message
[56:06] so my question before I get to that box
[56:09] if you uh were born in the message
[56:12] parents were message
[56:16] I can't raise my hand I'm from the
[56:19] outside coming in
[56:21] and I'm going to tell you
[56:24] that that has no bearing in this message
[56:27] because you were born
[56:38] let me say that over it
[56:40] doesn't mean a thing
[56:45] you yourself have to be born again we
[56:50] don't have to be born again
[56:53] so that I go back like I said the church
[56:56] was born again
[56:59] on a Sunday night
[57:03] January the 18th
[57:06] 1981
[57:08] I can tell you who preached that day
[57:13] when the Holy Spirit came
[57:15] and sooner or later a church is destined
[57:20] to be born again
[57:22] what happens to us as a church
[57:26] everybody is thinking one way the other
[57:30] person is thinking another way
[57:33] and it's hindering
[57:37] what we need
[57:40] you know what I better start my message
[57:42] I've gone 12 minutes
[57:48] I want you to
[57:51] go to slide one
[58:08] if I was to give this uh
[58:11] a subtitle
[58:15] the sons of God are called
[58:17] they're anointed they're commissioned
[58:21] and their place
[58:25] we need to be placed
[58:29] sooner or later we must be placed in the
[58:33] position that God
[58:35] predestinated us
[58:37] to be placed in
[58:40] the position
[58:51] you gotta stay up with me guys
[58:58] technology boy do I love it foreign
[59:44] so where's
[59:46] the Judgment scene
[59:50] somebody help me
[59:54] where and don't they
[59:57] very good thank you in the church
[59:59] gracias thank you everything's there we
[1:00:02] can read
[1:00:06] and the little Wells represent the
[1:00:09] little churches all out and the judgment
[1:00:11] begins at the house of God
[1:00:18] so all these little churches
[1:00:22] begins
[1:00:25] in the house of God so my question to
[1:00:29] you is
[1:00:32] where am I going to be judged
[1:00:35] someone tell me
[1:00:38] where I'm going to be judged
[1:00:41] the house of God
[1:00:46] let me say it over again you're being
[1:00:49] judged today
[1:00:54] everything we think
[1:00:56] someone's in here
[1:00:58] it's louder up there than here is
[1:01:03] we need to remember
[1:01:05] we are going through a judgment period
[1:01:11] we need to be obedient
[1:01:15] and do exactly
[1:01:18] what you're told to do
[1:01:21] being submissive
[1:01:23] or do you want to sacrifice
[1:01:29] now listen oh that's good
[1:01:31] brother Brennan goes on see
[1:01:34] here's where the judgment begins
[1:01:38] that's why I don't see
[1:01:41] why so many complain
[1:01:44] that I speak too hard foreign
[1:02:07] and try to make people straighten up
[1:02:14] and tell them
[1:02:19] way they're living
[1:02:21] the way they're dressing
[1:02:25] and tell me images I'm hurting my
[1:02:28] ministry
[1:02:30] here is
[1:02:32] telling people straighten up
[1:02:38] you need to make sure
[1:02:41] you're doing it this way
[1:02:44] and people telling them
[1:02:51] you know that each
[1:02:53] Pastor has to do that
[1:02:57] there's people that will accept it
[1:03:01] people that say I don't care
[1:03:04] remember spotless
[1:03:09] when the Judgment seat is in the house
[1:03:11] of God
[1:03:13] that's right
[1:03:17] here's where
[1:03:18] it's to begin at yes
[1:03:21] right here where Justice and
[1:03:24] righteousness
[1:03:27] of God is to go forth

[1:05:30] relaxing not having to worry
[1:05:35] this person doing this that person doing
[1:05:37] that
[1:05:38] but that's not what God
[1:05:41] wants
[1:05:42] that's what I wanted I can't do what I
[1:05:46] what I would do I gotta do what I'm
[1:05:49] expected to do because
[1:05:54] don't worry if it's hurting your minutes
[1:06:00] you gotta say the word of God to the
[1:06:04] letter
[1:06:07] and it starts right here
[1:06:09] in other words the minister can't do it
[1:06:15] a visiting Minister can't do it
[1:06:23] the local Pastor whatever congregation
[1:06:27] it is
[1:06:36] thank you
[1:06:38] so judgment begins in the house of God
[1:06:41] we show him
[1:06:43] I've always believed when brother Bernie
[1:06:47] used to say in reference where is the
[1:06:50] Judgment seat
[1:06:52] Well I was looking at Heaven I'd do this
[1:06:56] I'd have to go back and ask him what do
[1:06:59] you mean
[1:07:00] and he would chuckle how many of you
[1:07:03] remember his Chuckles
[1:07:06] foreign
[1:07:38] thank you
[1:07:41] Hebrews now we can start
[1:07:44] as an introduction
[1:07:47] now we can start Hebrews 9 11. again
[1:07:53] God's plan
[1:07:55] just doesn't stop with
[1:08:00] what we talked about last year
[1:08:03] the whole Plan of Redemption covers
[1:08:06] everything facet that you could think of
[1:08:08] imagination
[1:08:13] from Genesis Genesis to Revelation
[1:08:16] apocalypse we've got a lot to cover
[1:08:21] but Christ being come and high Priests
[1:08:25] of good things to come
[1:08:27] by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle
[1:08:30] not made with hands that is to say not
[1:08:33] of this building
[1:08:47] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[1:08:52] but by his own blood he entered in once
[1:08:54] into the holy place
[1:08:56] having obtained
[1:08:59] Eternal Redemption for us
[1:09:12] for if the blood of bulls and goats
[1:09:16] in the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the
[1:09:20] unclean sanctifieth to purify the flesh
[1:09:24] is
[1:09:31] how much more
[1:09:34] shall the blood of Christ who through
[1:09:36] the eternal spirit
[1:09:39] offered himself without spot to God
[1:09:42] Purge your conscience from dead Works to
[1:09:45] serve a living God
[1:09:47] is
[1:09:55] again without spot
[1:09:58] Purge your conscience
[1:10:01] to serve the Living God
[1:10:05] how many of us could put our name to
[1:10:09] that
[1:10:11] thoughts
[1:10:16] from dead Works
[1:10:21] [Applause]
[1:10:28] will you marry him
[1:10:36] [Applause]
[1:10:38] Crystal that blood is a Sangre
[1:10:42] is what covers Us
[1:10:45] when I do wrong when I think wrong
[1:10:49] though wrong it's covering us
[1:10:55] the Holy Spirit
[1:11:00] a sinful world
[1:11:04] but there's many Believers and that's
[1:11:07] why the holy spirit is circling around
[1:11:09] them
[1:11:16] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:11:18] can you say Amen so how many of us
[1:11:21] include ourselves
[1:11:26] of being called
[1:11:29] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:11:44] it's what it is
[1:11:47] you have no choice
[1:11:51] you may want to say I'm going to run and
[1:11:54] hide he said yeah
[1:12:00] you can be a jumper
[1:12:04] you can jump from one place
[1:12:08] but God already knows
[1:12:13] to be fulfilled
[1:12:15] and each and every one of your life
[1:12:19] so don't tell me that you don't have
[1:12:22] faith don't tell me you're not part of
[1:12:26] the Bride
[1:12:28] show me
[1:12:30] I'm from Missouri and I'm going to tell
[1:12:33] you right now
[1:12:35] there's not one person
[1:12:38] sitting here he shouldn't believe what
[1:12:42] they are
[1:12:44] identified with a message
[1:13:17] so when you're going through a problem
[1:13:21] when you're going through an issue
[1:13:23] I heard this word in Mexico
[1:13:28] so I had to go back to the message
[1:13:35] also restlessness
[1:13:39] worries
[1:13:42] concerns you can do this
[1:13:45] just wouldn't leave us alone
[1:13:51] I got so many things
[1:13:54] I tell people like brother Paul used to
[1:13:57] say
[1:14:02] and the same worries
[1:14:10] is what we had back in the 70s
[1:14:13] nothing has changed the only thing that
[1:14:17] has changed is
[1:14:22] I look at them back then
[1:14:25] as I said I was a golfer
[1:14:30] and I would listen to Bernie's team
[1:14:32] brother Bernie's team
[1:14:34] this brother would say well they believe
[1:14:37] this they believe that what are you
[1:14:39] going to tell them so then my ears would
[1:14:42] do this
[1:14:44] you know where they say there's a
[1:14:46] uh
[1:14:48] there's a ditch
[1:14:51] I don't know how to say it in English so
[1:14:52] that's why I said in Spanish
[1:14:58] when you hear something for those things
[1:15:00] are attentive
[1:15:05] well that's what I was to brother Bernie
[1:15:09] and then I want more
[1:15:13] and the first thing he would say
[1:15:15] 20 30 40 years are going to pass some
[1:15:19] people are gonna have
[1:15:21] those same concerns
[1:15:26] 50 years have passed it was 50 years
[1:15:33] and people have the same concerns
[1:15:38] my family
[1:15:40] my wife also my kids
[1:15:45] I have no work
[1:15:49] I have no car I have no house
[1:15:55] what am I going to do
[1:15:57] nobody loves me
[1:16:04] you know why I'd say this what's
[1:16:06] happening today
[1:16:09] I call them jumpers
[1:16:12] today they're with us
[1:16:14] tomorrow there's somewhere else
[1:16:16] they jump from church to church
[1:16:20] seeking advice
[1:16:23] they asked for advice
[1:16:26] they're not happy with the advice they
[1:16:29] go from place to place to place
[1:16:42] is marriage and divorce yes
[1:16:47] they jump and they jump and they jump
[1:16:49] until someone tells them what they want
[1:16:53] to hear and what they don't want to hear
[1:16:55] is
[1:16:56] could I leave my wife
[1:16:59] she's mean to me
[1:17:02] she believes in fast food I don't know
[1:17:06] you know Eli should have married a
[1:17:08] Mexican boy
[1:17:11] but she doesn't like to cook
[1:17:15] my wife's a great cook
[1:17:18] I use that as an example
[1:17:22] because that's what's happening a lack
[1:17:24] of communication
[1:17:30] you know I have questions
[1:17:34] how many of us want to be in God's
[1:17:37] perfect world
[1:17:44] there's three words that I can think of
[1:17:47] to be in his perfect will that is
[1:17:52] would you like to hear them I didn't put
[1:17:54] them up there
[1:17:55] because we're all writing down
[1:17:58] so let me ask Danny
[1:18:03] give me one word
[1:18:10] wow are you reading my mind today Danny
[1:18:17] obedience
[1:18:19] give me a word
[1:18:24] subject submissive wow you're reading my
[1:18:28] thoughts what's the third one
[1:18:32] can somebody tell me
[1:18:38] obedience
[1:18:40] being submissive communication
[1:18:44] you gotta communicate
[1:18:46] there's uh there's a sender
[1:18:50] um
[1:18:58] so we want to be in God's perfect world
[1:19:02] so I'm going to tell you
[1:19:06] you've all heard
[1:19:10] three stages of Grace
[1:19:11] what's the first
[1:19:17] like I said I can't really hear no sorry
[1:19:20] no
[1:19:23] uh
[1:19:25] you know I've always believed this with
[1:19:28] all my heart I'll never change I believe
[1:19:31] in unity
[1:19:33] in other words
[1:19:38] we should be able to all say
[1:19:43] justification all together that means
[1:19:47] that we all know that the first stage so
[1:19:51] what is it what is
[1:19:54] I heard a little bit
[1:19:57] let me hear it again
[1:19:59] justification
[1:20:03] now have you ever
[1:20:05] seen a person
[1:20:09] you see a person in crutches
[1:20:16] have you seen somebody sick so bad again
[1:20:20] that all of a sudden they have
[1:20:22] gangreneur
[1:20:25] have you seen that so
[1:20:31] have you heard or seen a person to tell
[1:20:34] you
[1:20:35] brother God sent me to you told me to
[1:20:39] pray for you and the person's reply is
[1:20:42] I'm waiting for my brother he's going to
[1:20:45] pray for us
[1:20:47] have you ever heard that
[1:20:51] well I recall
[1:20:53] being in Guadalajara I don't remember
[1:20:57] the year
[1:20:58] I really don't know but there was a
[1:21:02] police officer high-ranking police
[1:21:04] officer
[1:21:05] his brother lived in Orange California
[1:21:12] and this police officer commandant
[1:21:15] whatever they are official
[1:21:17] it was in a wheelchair
[1:21:22] and his wife says his feet smell you
[1:21:26] know he was gangrene it was eating them
[1:21:29] apart that means give them a couple days
[1:21:32] and he's six feet in the ground
[1:21:37] we had a Revival
[1:21:39] that year
[1:21:41] holy spirit fell people receiving
[1:21:46] their healing Miracles and baptism came
[1:21:50] that night yes
[1:21:57] about this one
[1:21:59] so the brother looks at me and I said uh
[1:22:02] brother can I pray for you
[1:22:06] and he closed down he says and I said if
[1:22:10] you're not careful you're going to die
[1:22:11] in a wheelchair I want you to stand up
[1:22:14] and walk with me
[1:22:17] how many of you walk and want Jesus to
[1:22:20] walk with you hand in hand
[1:22:23] how many would like that
[1:22:25] if you would like Jesus
[1:22:30] instead
[1:22:39] what would you say
[1:22:42] the person got up
[1:22:44] and we walked
[1:22:47] and I said can you feel that God is
[1:22:49] healing you
[1:22:52] he didn't see his feet Yes didn't worry
[1:22:55] if they hurt or not
[1:23:00] the closer we got to the
[1:23:05] I'm sorry the Judgment seed comes from
[1:23:08] where
[1:23:11] we got close to the pope is
[1:23:18] the pet is
[1:23:23] so he started looking at brother Pineda
[1:23:26] he was baptizing individuals
[1:23:29] I want to do that
[1:23:32] did anyone force him again did anyone
[1:23:35] say anything
[1:23:36] God call s him through a perfect Word
[1:23:41] Perfect
[1:23:49] so he got in baptized him got baptized
[1:23:53] walked out salio
[1:23:55] was walking like this
[1:24:03] the next day I looked for him couldn't
[1:24:06] find him
[1:24:09] the whole world
[1:24:10] that's where his family was at he was
[1:24:14] like this
[1:24:21] because he received it
[1:24:24] because he wasn't
[1:24:26] pressured
[1:24:29] he accepted
[1:24:31] God's perfect will in his life
[1:24:36] I asked brother
[1:24:39] Pablo Reyes whatever happened to the
[1:24:41] brother
[1:24:42] he said he lasted I think between three
[1:24:45] and six months
[1:24:46] and God took him
[1:24:49] now my my question is
[1:24:52] is he saved
[1:24:57] many people
[1:24:59] will be saved
[1:25:03] and they only made it to justification
[1:25:05] but that was God's will
[1:25:08] again you cannot tell me if God wants me
[1:25:14] to clean the church
[1:25:18] foreign
[1:25:29] God can use you for five minutes
[1:25:34] he was going to do it
[1:25:36] you can sing one song
[1:25:39] and that was it yes
[1:25:44] that's what he calls you foreign
[1:25:50] to pray for one
[1:25:53] Persona to preach one sermon
[1:25:56] and that was it yes and he was done with
[1:25:59] you yeah
[1:26:03] his perfect will can we change his
[1:26:07] perfect will well
[1:26:09] then why do we want to be something
[1:26:11] we're not
[1:26:17] too many people want to be this
[1:26:21] that and they don't understand that's
[1:26:24] not what God called
[1:26:27] God has a purpose and each and every one
[1:26:32] of us
[1:26:35] that's his perfect will
[1:26:38] and as we continue
[1:26:41] we'll break it down
[1:26:44] so how many of us have been called to
[1:26:47] carry out God's plan
[1:26:58] thank you
[1:26:59] Three Needs out here so I can talk about
[1:27:01] it
[1:27:03] okay his wife's not here I
[1:27:06] see his son
[1:27:11] so let me say it this way
[1:27:17] carrying out God's plan
[1:27:19] is
[1:27:25] if you're going to do it you better do
[1:27:28] it right
[1:27:29] if you don't do it right I'm Gonna Get
[1:27:31] You Down

[1:27:40] says
[1:27:43] I'll kick you down correct
[1:27:49] we were meant you and I were called to
[1:27:53] carry out God's plan
[1:27:56] so how many pastors do I have here
[1:27:59] sisters how many pastors
[1:28:06] whoa that's a catchy one isn't it
[1:28:09] what did Bernie what did Brother Bernie
[1:28:11] say about it
[1:28:13] she was the pastor of the what
[1:28:18] the kitchen
[1:28:21] let me say it again Garcia
[1:28:27] our pastor and Apostle Astoria Boston
[1:28:30] said the woman he's a pastora
[1:28:35] of her kitchen
[1:28:37] yes or no no
[1:28:42] she's the pastor of the kitchen could
[1:28:46] you imagine the pastor of the kitchen
[1:28:48] trying to go out and do I'm sorry who's
[1:28:51] the pastor of the house

[1:29:07] the husband is the pastor of the house
[1:29:10] yes or no
[1:29:16] when the pasture of the kitchen tries to
[1:29:19] take over the duties of the pastor of
[1:29:22] the house
[1:29:22] is that carrying out God's plan
[1:29:27] no no
[1:29:29] we have to stay
[1:29:32] where he placed us
[1:29:35] let me say it again we have to stay
[1:29:41] if he called me to be a deacono
[1:29:46] if he called me to do be a
[1:29:49] a trustee
[1:29:51] can I take the role
[1:29:55] of the deacono I gotta stay where okay
[1:29:59] and my
[1:30:01] colleague

[1:30:29] wood burner stove good thank you
[1:30:35] I picked up the offering
[1:30:43] God called me to be a what
[1:30:48] what was he called to do
[1:30:50] slow slumbering
[1:30:53] tired
[1:30:57] oh I shouldn't have stayed up so late
[1:31:02] brother Brennan was called to be a what
[1:31:06] a prophet but he was doing the duties
[1:31:12] an
[1:31:13] Evangelista a teacher maestro
[1:31:17] a pastor a pastor
[1:31:22] there is a difference
[1:31:23] between brother Branham being able to do
[1:31:26] all five
[1:31:31] the only one I saw close to doing that
[1:31:36] it was all five
[1:31:39] but for you and I to try to say I'm this
[1:31:43] this we are getting out of God's plan
[1:31:50] all that just to say we're getting off
[1:31:53] God's plan
[1:31:55] carriers of a message we should
[1:32:00] Witnesses but leave everything else to
[1:32:04] the person that God called him to do
[1:32:10] can you say Amen
[1:32:15] how many have you been trained
[1:32:19] I think we've all been trained to do
[1:32:21] something else did you get trained
[1:32:24] retrained
[1:32:28] training is like reading
[1:32:31] it never stops
[1:32:34] it's a live long learning
[1:32:41] in the same way it is with being trained
[1:32:44] I'm sorry
[1:32:46] way back there raise your hand
[1:32:50] um
[1:32:52] I need work sadio
[1:32:56] I
[1:32:58] want twenty dollars an hour
[1:33:02] I think it's more now more
[1:33:07] no wonder he's laughing he's saying that
[1:33:09] I got him
[1:33:11] I want more work
[1:33:15] but he was a
[1:33:19] he was a barber
[1:33:21] he doesn't know what you do matter of
[1:33:24] fact you say give me an inch and a half
[1:33:26] and he goes to you and says what's an
[1:33:29] inch and a half
[1:33:31] could you use them
[1:33:35] or would you train him
[1:33:39] he's waving his hand saying I would
[1:33:41] train him
[1:33:42] now he's a framer he's doing a good job
[1:33:47] but you need someone Italian to start
[1:33:51] putting the boxes for the electricity
[1:33:58] could he do it
[1:34:02] can he be trained
[1:34:05] uh once he's trained he go to another
[1:34:09] place and say the same thing I know
[1:34:11] framing I know electricity
[1:34:14] I found out it was 50 an hour
[1:34:22] no no
[1:34:25] you need a license you need to be
[1:34:28] certified that you've been trained to do
[1:34:31] another job who certifies us
[1:34:35] and God's
[1:34:37] instead
[1:34:41] you're looking at him
[1:34:44] it's a seal they give yourself
[1:34:48] state has its own sale
[1:34:52] electricians you need a license
[1:34:56] ministers you need a license how many of
[1:35:00] you know that
[1:35:01] ministers
[1:35:05] come on
[1:35:07] now
[1:35:11] there's two forms a license you go to
[1:35:16] school or you're ordained
[1:35:20] one or the other two groups two
[1:35:23] different groups
[1:35:25] why am I saying all this because when I
[1:35:28] get to where I need to guess you can go
[1:35:31] back to the tape and hear it over again
[1:35:34] cross training
[1:35:38] cross
[1:35:41] you need that cross training
[1:35:44] if you're in housing you need to know
[1:35:46] everything there is about housing pains
[1:35:56] and God's economy
[1:35:58] it's the same thing is you got to be
[1:36:02] trained as a deacon
[1:36:05] yes or no raise your hand yes or no
[1:36:13] you're trained as a deacon
[1:36:15] one session
[1:36:17] or is it a continual thing
[1:36:21] it never stops
[1:36:27] how many of us believe in being
[1:36:30] commissioned
[1:36:34] where are you raise your hand if you
[1:36:35] believe that
[1:36:36] I'm going to finish in a little while
[1:36:45] oh here's Danny
[1:36:49] Daddy
[1:36:51] I need you to listen to this Danny
[1:36:55] uh wanted to go to
[1:36:58] Colombia Colombia
[1:37:03] so call me and tell me you'd like to go
[1:37:05] to Colombia Colombia
[1:37:11] where are you
[1:37:15] is he commissioned
[1:37:20] no
[1:37:21] let me say it again
[1:37:24] too many people want to be commissioned
[1:37:28] but nobody sends them they send
[1:37:31] themselves
[1:37:33] that's the same way
[1:37:35] with the five-fold ministry
[1:37:41] when somebody says brother Garcia said
[1:37:53] why didn't he call me
[1:37:57] brother Garcia usually calls and lets us
[1:38:00] know ahead of time
[1:38:08] the last thing you should do
[1:38:13] is buy your ticket the first thing you
[1:38:16] should do is get permission
[1:38:20] I'm sorry
[1:38:24] you must get permission somebody has to
[1:38:28] give you the okay
[1:38:31] we just don't do things because we want
[1:38:34] to do them somebody has a plan
[1:38:38] God's plan was preordained that we would
[1:38:42] follow this type of ethics
[1:38:46] can you say Amen
[1:38:48] I'm just giving you a little bit so when
[1:38:50] I get to it
[1:38:53] how many of us have been placed
[1:38:55] raise your hand if you've been in place
[1:38:58] I'm sitting in Heavenly places no
[1:39:08] how many ministers do I have
[1:39:11] raise your hand
[1:39:17] the reason I like it so much
[1:39:21] is um
[1:39:22] you know you were called
[1:39:25] well do I don't I I don't know I didn't
[1:39:29] say ordained
[1:39:33] I said how many ministers
[1:39:37] okay good good good good good good good
[1:39:39] good good
[1:39:45] there's a difference between Minister
[1:39:47] and ordained ministers
[1:39:52] so when you're placed
[1:39:56] that's God's place in you this is how
[1:40:00] many of you lead song services
[1:40:11] that's it
[1:40:13] what were we talking about
[1:40:15] tell me
[1:40:17] you say it in Spanish I'll say it in
[1:40:19] English
[1:40:31] that's me I'm the one that's supposed to
[1:40:34] forget that's what we talked about
[1:40:36] was every time we needed song leaders
[1:40:41] now I look
[1:40:43] in people
[1:40:45] like this is like this I see and now
[1:40:48] they're like this
[1:40:50] leading song Services
[1:40:52] we have an abundance
[1:40:55] because God hears The Plea of his yes
[1:41:02] he saw you in the beginning
[1:41:10] [Applause]
[1:41:23] I'm going to skip definitions because my
[1:41:26] I have four minutes
[1:41:32] I want you to go to Europe
[1:41:40] slide 17.
[1:41:43] speak to this rock hablaster
[1:41:48] brother Brenham said you said
[1:41:52] that's what's the matter with too many
[1:41:53] churches
[1:41:55] they've taken the carnal intellectual
[1:41:58] route
[1:42:00] been cut off of this the supplies of
[1:42:03] God's blessings
[1:42:09] and the power of the baptism of the Holy
[1:42:12] Ghost
[1:42:14] and they took the desert route
[1:42:19] therefore we have arguing
[1:42:23] and complaints
[1:42:27] is that us
[1:42:29] if that's us raise your hands
[1:42:32] well a lot of you know well let me tell
[1:42:35] you

[1:43:18] everything was there for them
[1:43:21] they experienced everything
[1:43:24] experimentation but after a while
[1:43:28] they wanted a lamb
[1:43:32] you know
[1:43:35] and one says to the other we should have
[1:43:38] stayed in Egypt I missed the garlic
[1:43:46] they started complaining
[1:43:49] is that us
[1:43:50] we've seen the blessings
[1:44:00] but we still complain
[1:44:04] and the reason we complain
[1:44:08] is we get tired

[1:47:29] you're an old crow
[1:47:35] come on somebody
[1:47:43] don't tell me I'm reading your mind
[1:47:50] when somebody approaches you
[1:47:53] so a real born-again church
[1:47:57] when somebody gets to you
[1:48:00] and they tell you that is
[1:48:04] and they say well that Pastor is this
[1:48:07] that ministers
[1:48:16] what's your
[1:48:18] what should you tell them
[1:48:21] brother
[1:48:23] I love that brother I love my family I'm
[1:48:26] also familiar
[1:48:28] I don't want to hear it okay
[1:48:30] is that hard to say
[1:48:34] you know 90 of our problems
[1:48:37] would stop
[1:48:40] we were to memorize that
[1:48:45] because I'm going to tell you
[1:48:50] people have spit on me people have been
[1:48:52] pushed Tomatoes it hasn't been the first
[1:48:55] time
[1:48:57] people are going to talk about me
[1:49:00] the first time
[1:49:03] is it going to bother me
[1:49:07] it shouldn't
[1:49:09] but if you're not careful Born Again
[1:49:14] mature enough
[1:49:16] we're gonna go under a rock
[1:49:18] and that's where we're going to stay
[1:49:21] because I thought all Christians were
[1:49:23] good Christians
[1:49:25] well let me tell you that's why I said
[1:49:28] there's a time to speak
[1:49:31] a time to listen
[1:49:33] time to be obedient
[1:49:38] can you say Amen I'm gonna close with
[1:49:41] this
[1:49:50] if I can find it
[1:50:01] wow
[1:50:04] oh there it is
[1:50:07] I want you to stand up
[1:50:10] you know I had somebody
[1:50:13] they brought me this
[1:50:16] a little outfit
[1:50:18] as
[1:50:20] outfit and
[1:50:24] um
[1:50:25] they wanted us to pray
[1:50:27] for this baby
[1:50:30] and this is what brother Brennan said
[1:50:32] can I read it
[1:50:35] and I want you to apply it to yourself
[1:50:37] to your family
[1:50:42] don't say anything contrary to it
[1:50:47] refuse to sign anything the devil brings
[1:50:53] he will have to take it back
[1:50:57] I refuse to have it
[1:51:00] I just won't have it no sir no senor
[1:51:05] he will take it he will have to take it
[1:51:08] back
[1:51:11] in the name of the Lord
[1:51:13] if you believe it confess it
[1:51:17] I accept Jesus Christ as my healer
[1:51:21] there's no Affliction or disease
[1:51:27] stay right with it
[1:51:29] the reason I'm reading this is for this
[1:51:33] is
[1:51:37] I'll say it again
[1:51:39] Satan has to take back whatever
[1:51:45] is happening in your life has to take it
[1:51:49] back all you have to do is reject it
[1:51:51] if you are
[1:51:55] this that is
[1:51:57] he will take it back
[1:52:00] but you got to do your part
[1:52:05] all you have to do is believe it brother
[1:52:07] Brenham says
[1:52:10] say I accept Jesus Christ as my healer
[1:52:17] so with your heads down
[1:52:22] it doesn't matter what Affliction you
[1:52:25] have
[1:52:26] what worry you have
[1:52:31] what's in your heart
[1:52:35] God knows
[1:52:37] what you can take
[1:52:39] God knows the pressure in your life
[1:52:42] you can't hide it
[1:52:46] all you have to do
[1:52:47] raise your hand
[1:52:52] and give it back to the original owner
[1:52:54] the sickness and the reflections
[1:52:58] send it back
[1:53:01] brother Brenham continues to say but the
[1:53:05] first time
[1:53:06] that you get weak
[1:53:12] and you say you said you say well yes I
[1:53:16] still got it then you drop right down to
[1:53:20] where you were at was that
[1:53:24] you signed for it then you took it back
[1:53:28] [Music]
[1:53:35] every time we get weak in the spirit
[1:53:40] weak in the flesh
[1:53:43] the first thing that pops into your mind
[1:53:47] I still got the sickness I still have
[1:53:51] the Affliction
[1:53:52] I still have
[1:53:54] a race
[1:54:01] that's when
[1:54:03] you got it back again
[1:54:08] I want you to say
[1:54:09] say it from your heart
[1:54:12] or say it out loud
