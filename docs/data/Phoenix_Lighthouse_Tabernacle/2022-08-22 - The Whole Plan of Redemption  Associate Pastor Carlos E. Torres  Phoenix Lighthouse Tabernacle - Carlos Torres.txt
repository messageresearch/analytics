arms extended waiting for us to come back [Music] [Music] thank you for listening to us [Music] scripture that we've been reading hebrews 9 11. [Music] chapter 9 verse 11. but christ being common high priest of good things to come by greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building eternal neither by the blood of goats and caps but by his own blood he entered once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us cabrillos for if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctify to the purifying of the flesh juan tomas la sangre how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god and for this cause he is the mediator for the new testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance may god add the blessing to the reading of his word and god bless each [Music] [Music] wherever he raising jesus christ taking him out of history and presenting them in real life that's why we should always be praying one for another especially especially for my pastor amen we're going to continue orlando on about what we've been speaking on i'm [Music] [Music] [Music] it makes me want to dive into their pro the thinking process to see how they structured it and i see how god has worked through them and so we're thankful for that because we have youth that stood up for the word of god greet our brothers in iowa colorado or this topic always takes us to certain scriptures but one very important one that always takes us to is to revelation apocalypse when the book was sealed with seven seals was opened because the lamb defeated talking about that scripture in revelation the line of judah the tribe of david has overcame in which they focused on the scripture which is all right he comes and asks me he said who is the elder that said unto john to not weep or cry when but seeing that to me it's like eating dessert knowing who the elder was is a dessert la comida principal the main dish is what is the sacrifice the significance what does grace mean what does the love of god mean to us now we've talked that there's certain important points that we should take into account the condition of the age in which we live the plan of god for the age we live in a understanding god's plan for me as an individual in the age i live in quebec knowing that we live in the age of laurie the church the church that made god vomiting because that way i can understand who my worst enemy is [Music] you surrender because through his so they all began to say what everybody else thought they thought they made up an idea of what they had heard what they had perceived some say you are a liar judge this based on a perception now this is a perception i want you to tell to you for you you who are with us who do you say and automatically jesus replied and gave a blessing to simon peter because he was not revealed by flesh or blood [Applause] we base our ideas on external perceptions on the revelation of the word of god obviously if peter answered the christ the have intendimiento opens your understanding you know who you are age you live what is yours christian the body of christ [Applause] i can see so the same promise i was given to peter is giving on to me the keys were given to peter revelation to understand what that god loves us you say brother do i need revelation to understand that god loves me yes brother for me if he died for me on the cross this is hermano branham brother next position in the message and exposition of the seven churches serving church ages now the lord god all powerful says jose i know there he's moving amongst his people there's the major pastor the pastor of the herd but does he maintain persecution refrain tribulation he says he doesn't do it is our prophet says that he's not refrained from persecution or tribulation he doesn't remove the trial he simply says i know your tribulation is gracias if it's possible for me not to go to the cross server at the moment [Applause] i can [Applause] is the prophet says as a son of god that's why many times we misunderstand is the amount of time you stay in that problem depends on you not on god but everything is with a purpose everything is with a purpose the prophet says has left for his church a measure of suffering so that she threw her faith in god while she suffers a stature of perfection if we don't suffer with it we cannot reign with him [Applause] god wants to see how time has a purpose for everything he does nothing happens accidentally to those who love the lord nothing happens just accidentally to those who love the lord millions and millions and millions of people hear this message but they haven't been able to hear it all you had to do was [Applause] says and god is behind every move and sometimes you think that everything is going wrong but it's up to us the prophet says in other words the prophet beginning and ending of the gentile dispensations preached in 1955 victoria before you can have a victory [Applause] so we ought to be thankful for the battles we need revelations how am i going to be thankful for a battle yesterday i'm going to be thankful for a trial boy it's god giving us the opportunity to have victories don't that make you a little bit better now see the battle come along somebody's saying something bad about it sickness coming to you maybe god giving you those light afflictions that he might heal and show you his favor to you [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] is you god sends you to hell because you won't repent and take christ as your savior he had his plan he projects [Applause] species to be able to produce grace in other words la gracia grace you accept it in your life that produces a responsibility how god told him he took him out he was with a couple brothers i need to speak with you in the proxy is it in the next reunion or convention you need to be careful whatever you do i will support you just see what level of profit he said lord i forgive them i forgive them for what they're doing because i was also a sinner she says she was in a bad shape mentally and physically physically mentally physically and mentally she wasn't enough she was bad through the message we know that the reason she became an ill-famed woman was because the influence that her mother had on her influence the influence of her mother it made her to be an ill-famed woman it wasn't so much that the mother was a bad example you've had five lovers the one you're with is not even your husband and she was only 18 years old she finds herself in this bad condition mentally and physically but we know that as soon as you've seen the sign done of the messiah she said she started right quick with the responsibilities to know that if she had found it and came into the presence of god she was responsible to tell somebody else about it she left with a responsibility when the grace was extended she accepted representation [Applause] la with the life with the water that's set up i had contact with the eternal god took that word yes running she began to tell everyone else the scriptures had prophesied was in our midst [Applause] so that others may be able to come grace brings responsibility [Applause] our testimony should always be positive [Applause] is keeps you thinking things you shouldn't be thinking constantly negative constantly thinking negative but if we can understand that in this moment if we're going through english [Applause] are going to turn into a [Applause] take the responsibility for my situation is all these is [Applause] [Applause] yesterday today and forever he said he's going to heal me he will heal me he said he hears me he hears me don't tell no do this don't doubt [Applause] that space [Applause] can come on [Music] [Music] instead of our own interpretation [Music] but i want you to be like i am it's me speaking to you telling you that i love you don't flee from this truck oh yes [Music] you will alter the process that i have for you i want to transform myself [Music] [Music] in [Applause] [Music] transform everything has a promise with him [Music] i ask you father you [Applause] you so you could finish that process of transformation and when that process is done reach one of them sacrificially they present as a living pleasing sacrifice [Applause] if [Music] now it depends [Applause] thank you father amen amen amen amen god bless you [Music] amazing grace shall always be my song of for it was grace that bought my liberty [Music] i do not know just why he came to love me so he looked beyond my fault and saw my knees i shall forever lift my knives to calvary [Music] to
