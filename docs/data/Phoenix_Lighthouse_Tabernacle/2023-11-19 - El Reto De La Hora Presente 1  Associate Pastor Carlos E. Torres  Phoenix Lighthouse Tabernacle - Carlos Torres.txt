TRANSCRIPT
========================================
they'll probably be driving down after after the lunch tonight and then we will some of them from way down I hope you stay over and what rooms we got is open to you and then Wednesday night we'll continue on on the study and then the Lord willing next Sunday again and Thena begins on the six so all that's got your vacations plan we're expecting a great wonderful time amen at Thea that's where we always have such a marvelous time not to bigger crowds we run sometimes it'll hold up to about I suppose we could put 10,000 in it easy but usually last year I think we had around about 7,000 something like that that was a packed out place but there's plenty of room to stand and seats that they could run all the way out and uh so we are looking forward to that and glad to see many of our Minister Brothers in can't never think of his name here the missionary brother Humes sister Humes is that you sitting right here the little ones we're glad to have them a missionary other ones brother Pat brother dton and all just so many brother brothers just a few moments ago it be kind of hard to call them all but we're very happy to have you in the house of the Lord tonight this great precious brother Neville sitting behind me here to pray with me while we are going to teach the word Charlie glad to see you and sister Nelly Here Tonight the little ones this is in Bible teaching is usually a very yes brother Welch I just was looking for you I see you sitting back there now Bible teaching is usually a little treacherous a little you know kind of walking out on the thin eyes we call it but we just feel that maybe at this point and at this time it might be good to kindly bring the the church to what I think to uh uh complete uh understanding positionally of what we are in Christ Jesus and sometimes I think that preaching is a wonderful thing but I believe sometimes brother beer that teaching goes beyond that amen and kindly especially to the church now preaching usually catches The Sinner brings him under condemnation by the word but teaching places the and positionally what he is and we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are now if the United States of this Fair land here sent me over to Russia as an ambassador of this nation to Russia then if they have officially sent me to Russia all the power that the United States has is behind me my word is just the same as in United States if I have been recognized as an AM and then if God has sent us to be his ambassadors all the power that's in heaven all that God is all of his angels and all of his power stands behind our words if we are correctly an ordained sent Messengers to the people God has to honor the word for he has so solemnly written that whatever you bind on Earth that will I bind in heaven whatever you loose on Earth that will I loose in heaven I give unto thee the keys to the kingdom all such great promises he's given the church and I am after the other day if many of you supposed to share this morning to hear as I tried to in my humble simple way to explain the the vision that I saw of Heaven I Would by no means ever try to doubt anything that anyone ever told me that God told them I believe it even if I didn't see it in the scripture I would still uh want to believe that brother's word I might just stay right along with the Bible but still I would believe it maybe brother just misunderstood it some way that he might have just got it mixed up a little and still I would believe he he' to be my brother and if there's anything that burns within my heart and I hope it never leaves in my years to come that I'll never forget what happened last Sunday morning as a week it has done something to me that's revolutionized my life I I do not fear I I have not one fear of death death has no fear at all and it it doesn't for you if you just understood now maybe if you'd have to have the experience to know it because there's no way to explain it you cannot find words because it doesn't l in the English uh dictionary or no other dictionary because it's in an eternity no yesterday no tomorrow it's all present tense and it's no uh I feel pretty good in an hour from now I don't feel so well and another hour feel good again tense all the time never ceas just that glorious peace something and there can be no sin there could be no jealousy there could be no sickness there there could be nothing ever reach that Heavenly Shore and if I may have the privilege of saying this which may be I do not if I do not then I pray God forgive me but if I have the privilege and it was that God let me be caught up to see something I would refer to the first heavens and then I believe one in the Bible by the name I believe it was Paul that was caught up into the third heavens and if it was this glorious in the first Heavens what does that third Heavens hold you see no wonder he couldn't speak of it for 14 years he said he did not know whether he was in body or out of body with that great Apostle not to share his his his office or not to try try to make ourselves anything like he was but I can say with him I don't know whether was in this body or out of the body only thing it was just as real as I'm looking at you and I've always wondered about if IID passed by I'd see a little Cloud floating by a spirit and say there goes brother and sister that's Charlie and Nelly that's brother and sister Spencer going there that always puzzled me if my eyes is in the grave decaying rottening if my ears is not here to hear anymore and if my blood is all gone back in the been bombed it and it's in the waters or in the [Music] ground and my mental faculties my brain cells are all gone then how would I be any more than just a spirit floating around that wearied me how would I like to say hello brother Pat oh so glad to see you hello brother nille I would like to see you but I thought well if I don't have anything to see with any mouth to speak with it's rotten it's dust how would I be able to say hello brother Pat hello brother Neville or so forth hi Charlie but now I know that that's wrong hard is written in the scriptures which I say it's not contrary for if this Earthly Tabernacle be designed we have one already waiting another Tabernacle that has eyes ears lips mental faculty if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolv it has a body that can feel can talk and now it comes to me just now that Moses had been dead and in an in unmarked grave for 800 years yeah and Elisha had went to heaven 500 years before but on Mount Transfiguration they were found talking with Jesus after Samuel had been dead for at least three to five years and the witch ofor called him up and she fell on her face and she said you have deceived me because you are sa yourself she said because I see Gods she was a heathen you see I see Gods rising up and Saul couldn't see him yet and he said what does he look like describe him to me said he's th and he has a mantle over his shoulder said that Samuel the prophet bring him here before me and I want you to notice that Samuel had not lost any of his [Music] personality he was still a prophet he told told Saul exactly what would happen the next day so you see death does not completely diminish us as we weep and whail and lament at the grave it only changes our Dwelling Place it takes us from a place to what is age if I live one more hour I'll outli a many 16y old person I'll out live a many fivey old person age is nothing we're just set here for a purpose to do something well now many of these little pretty face mothers sitting here some of them 60 70 years old would say what have I done brother Brandon you've raised your children you've done what you were supposed to do maybe some old dad sitting here say well I've hired the fields I've done this I never preach but you did just what God sent for you to do there's a place for you speaking to an old doctor yesterday one of my doctor friends buddies 80 something years old and his sister-in-law is here at the church tonight and she's been just a tle teeny bit worried about it I went to see as soon as I began to talk to him he brightened up told me about a hunting trip he taken many years ago in Colorado in the very same country just as brilliant bright and I said Doctor how long You' been practicing he said when you were nursing and way down I said a many a time he said I've practiced taking my buggy I put my saddle bags over my horse I took the little satchel and I've walked and I said yes down along the creek Banks 2:00 in the morning with your flashlight trying to find the house where little child had tummy acre mother labor pains that's right I said you know doctor I believe across this dividing line here between Mortal and immortality God has a place for good old doctors serve like that great tears come in his eyes he started crying he reached up his feeble hands and said brother I hope so across the line God judges a man's Soul what he is then I give him this satisfying scripture many times flying through those dark muddy fields at night trying to help somebody maybe never get a penny for it but it's all right I said Jesus said in the scripture blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy and that is true tonight we want to set the church in these three lessons if God permits how and what to look to what we are we're going to begin at the first chapter of the book of Paul's letter to Ephesus and we're going to take the three first chapters in our next three studies trying to get a chapter evening if we can tonight Wednesday and next Sunday morning Ephesians first chapter now as we study together I'd like to say this that this book of Ephesians perfectly parallels the Old Testament joshu Ephesians the book of Ephesians now remember if we happen to get just a little off to your teaching just forgive us and bear with us a while we open it let's ask him to help us as we bow our heads Lord we are approaching th holy and sacred RIT which it is more secure than all the heavens and earth are we reading this word called the Bible that both Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word shall never fail then upon this solemn hour that I come to this pit tonight before the purchase of your blood these precious darling marles that set sh tonight grasping for every little hope that they can hold on for that life that is to come May It Be so sufficient tonight that every believer here will see his position and everyone who has not yet come into this Great Fellowship will press the kingdom Lord then knock at the door until the keeper opens the door Grant it Lord we are reading in here where this Bible is of no private interpretation God forbid that I your servant or any other

to be here with [Music] us and today we have him here at home with us always a how many are always praying for our pastor thank you for that also give thanks to my pastor for the opportunity let us speak a little bit on the word let us give it a [Music] title over what we've been speaking on the challenge of the present hour there's a challenge for the hour which we're leading we as looking at the image we can tell that the challenge is for a certain time without having to read any Scripture you can understand what the Bible says when Jesus is knocking on the door I am at the door and I call we know seeing that and mentioning that we can tell what age we're living in First Corinthians 13 verse 11 says when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish and now we see by a mirror dark when we see face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am we know in part we see a bit dark the glass where there is a reflection and in that glass there's a reflection of an image and the image that is being seen it's the image projecting of he who's in front of the mirror what are we looking at when we stand in front of a mirror in front of the mirror of the word we see darkly but there will come a time when we will know ourselves then as we were known because what is in part will be taken away we know another we have to reach the complete the complete Revelation to see the image C which has been projected in that mirror or that glass brother Bram says in the message calling Jesus to the scene so there was a storm on now God created the winds God created the air God created the water it's all his creation he made it but you see it was the devil that got into it and whipped it up that's what causes trouble is the devil and now if he is the Creator and made it thus in the beginning shouldn't those disciples know that that Creator laying right there could make it stop you say how can I be sure of it though brother Bram if I could just be sure then call him to confirm his word making Hebrews 138 right then the doubts and fear will cease just like the winds [Music] did them old winds going through your mind maybe I won't get it maybe it won't be me maybe he won't do this don't there ain't no maybe to it he promised it that takes all the May out of it wake Jesus call him on the scene are you scared to do it are you afraid to to take God's challenge here brother Bram is giving us he telling us we're afraid to take God's challenge it's a question are we afraid to take God's challenge when elij was he he was before the prophets he was challenging he says if Jehovah is God Ser but if Je if B is God then serve Why are you jumping back and forth between two different thoughts serve him focus on he was giving challeng it was a challenge he had given at that hour who will you serve he made a challenge to God that responds God response with fire that is the true God now in this time brother bam is telling us are we afraid to take God's challenge he begins to describe the scene when they entered the boat and got and and the storm came and shook them the storm came and try to finish them brother says God created but the Devil Comes anded try to finish those disciples then Jesus was there he was in the but he was they began to cry out they began to scream he says Wake Jesus up he says Wake Jesus up are you afraid to take God's challenge the time that we're living what is it what is the challenge we have before us what is the challenge brother Bram tells us the condition or the diagnosis of the age we understand the age of L is the last age it's the darkest age it's the most evil age worst of the ages since the beginning of time but it's an age of much abundance how odd that in this age of progress and abundance How can there be proof it's truly strange it's an age of abundance and opportunity when we have so much and there is so much more to gain and all the inventions that do our job for us many things to give us have fun and give us pleasure we find mental sicknesses taking over people to to the point where the nation is alarmed they should all be happy and truly have nothing to be sad for [Music] and many take sedatives at night to go to sleep and in the morning they wake up they take medicine to boost their emotion uh energy they're running with frequency to the doctors they're going into mental institutions with alcohol they try to drown the fears that they don't even understand this age grafts on to having a great abundance of things but people are less happy they respond to spiritual accomplishments but people have less trust and confidence they grasp on to ver moral values and it's the most corrupt of any other age since the beginning of the flood in this age we talk about knowledge and science but it's losing that battle on all ends because the mind and the human Spirit cannot understand or comprehend the changes that have come upon the Earth in just one generation we Advanced so much from the time of the horse and buggy to the time in space and this gives us a lot of Pride but within is a dark empty Cavern that is crying out in torment without knowing why man is failing because of fear and the man the world is so dark that they could well be called the age of neurotics this age could be called the age of neurotics we're in the age of the neurotics that's an anointing that's going around that's trying to take hold of people to turn them into neurotics they don't respect age they don't respect social position you don't respect how many years you have in church you're born the message or if you wen't burn message respect whether you went to church or you didn't go to church it will attack you with everything with the purpose to destroy you the neurotic age when neoism and depression where stress anxiety are taking control of people's mind with Rebellion esting more than ever everyone claiming their rights that's what makes the age of L that's what it means what this age means the people's rights is claiming their rights but when a person begins to Rebel at the same time they begin to lose their identity when somebody claims their rights that the age of is offering people claiming the rights of being able to identify however they want to identify it's no longer just man or woman each time that someone Rebels they lose their identity when the people of Israel they began on their Journey to the promised land they began to rebel against Goden amen yes brother but they never complained with God they rebelled against God but they were complain against Moses they were complain with Moses but the effect of that was that they were rebelling against in rebelling they were losing their identity the right to the promis it was for rebelling against the servant of God the man that God has been us take them to the promised land there is no way that we can't in the time serve God and detach God from the there is no way God sent a powerful prophet and that's the problem with many people they rebel against God but they don't Rebel directly but they're rejecting what the prophet has spoken now the prophet gave a challenge in this age and the challenge was always simple in the message it is I preached in 1960 now any of you I challenge you I challenge your faith in Christ's name anywhere to believe it it says in the message hear ye him I challenge you Faith to believe it now brother bam is telling is that he challenges us to have faith but what is Faith it's Revelation other words I challenge you to have that Revelation I challenge [Music] you he says take any Divine Pro promise listen to this anything that you you can make this stat it's on recordings everything but I say this and challenge anybody the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of this word will bring it to pass regardless of what it is so he's giving us a challenge to believe to have faith in the age which we live where nervousness is over where depression is overpowering people where stress is overpowering where Rebellion is overpowering people where anxiety is overpowering the minds of people where people are committing suicide they no longer want to face the problems of life at this time the challenge is for each one of us the challenge is can you believe not halfway we if he is god Jehovah is God then serve him the prophet stands in the US to believe challeng us to have fa it tells us that we have the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise from God God will bring it to pass but the problem is that nervousness depression stress fear anxiety it takes our mind don't have time to meditate in the word of God the revelation of the day where weing we're so preoccupied in the purpose of this age is to send us to send us to a corner to turn us into neurotics into neurotics now there's people that act like neurotics but there is a process the one that starts to act like a neurotic they become sick and then they become a neurotic and if that advances he gets worse and worse until he completely loses his identity Prophet says the following he's challenging us he's giving us a challenge how many can believe but then he goes a bit to open up the Revelation and he says a greater witness in Greater witness preached 1953 he says I want to ask you [Music] something will you obey me as his servant says now just as a servant not as obey I don't mean that but you'll obey what he says through me now I'm going to challenge every one of you tonight they sing up in the nights here in in this meeting but if you could just take my advice there would not be one feeble person left Among Us he's first giving us the challenge to he says if you can believe me there would be no feeble person with us in the message why are people so tossed about each in 1956 he say now you might not be able to understand it you might not be be able to get it but I challenge your faith you come and believe what I have told you and watch what happen you just believe what's been told and see what happened now the prophet's giving us an even greater challenge he's not just saying can we believe now he's saying if you can believe me that's a greater challenge the most difficult thing is for one man to believe another he says if you believe me there will be no feeble person if you believe what I tell there be no no sick person among us and that's the key for the time we are living in that we can believe Christ Jesus the word God made flesh God in human God in his perfect condescendence God Jesus Christ made flesh he came and said sent a powerful gave us the message of the hour he gave us a message to wake up to reality he gave us a powerful Apostle who spoke to us the exact same things that the prophet spoke he came and gave us and managed to place Us in the body of Christ he's positioning us with a [Music] pastor the deity of God made that's the challenge of the can we believe God made flesh can we believe God in human flesh because that's the key to be able to have our spiritual success to be able to see God in human respect God in human flesh God see God in our midst when he speaks to us through our pastor and be able to see that that is the advice that we need says you could take my advice you could just listen to what I why would the prophet because I'm listening directly and I'm giving you what you need and that's the C if I could just you could just listen to what I give you the advice that because I'm taking it directly from the perfect condescendence of God of the word of God from one prophetic Apostolic brings us the perfect placing in the body of of Christ how many can accept it that is the challenge of the present hour being able to hear that advice through human lips that is the challenge believe believe have faith have revelation of who God is what is his program what is his plan and what is my in that recognize who's next to me kn who's my comp see God in human flesh so next time I'm greeting God I G him here we might give him a right hook to oh man when we look at it that way we'll respect one another more we're going to be careful what we say about our brothers we're going to be careful we're going to love each other brother says doesn't matter all the gift what I desire is the love reflected in each one that is the greatest thing why is it the greatest when he went beyond that Cur of time he said he said be assured because anything that's not perfect love canot only I can go in is the perfect love I love God if I hate my brother how can I say I serve God I can't serve my brother I can't do something good for him that's the revelation of the can we accept the CH Cheng be to in our and when we do that open up a blessings for you healing comes to you because you're ffing the been established for your operation that's the key we have to go the presence of God Beyond flesh when God when Jesus saw a Samaritan woman see a lost woman see an ill woman the prophet he saw representation a pure woman without SP when Jesus made contact with the spirit of that woman he began to bring it what she really was and then begin to project a vision when the woman re the Revelation who the Messiah was the vision in the present time no longer matters ration of deity was able to manifest she left running was on Earth the man that they had been waiting man to bring deliver forgiveness of that the chains may fall no longer had to be enslaved go to a certain place to worship now the going Spirit be truly free the messah was on Earth she receives that revelation of who truly maned in this Dimension time that is why we need to understand the deity God God walking

give you a a pill to combat stress and to combat Rebellion I'll give you another one Psalms 151 it's the best prescription for n praise Praise Him in the firment of his power praise him for his mighty Praise Him according to the excellent greatness praise him with the sound of the Trum Praise Him With Praise Him with tremble and dance him withing instruments Praise Him upon the loud symbols him

your use your voice use your mouth everything that have use it to praise let me tell you one cannot be in the same place a depressed person cannot who worships cannot get depressed that's the way it is you want to get over stress never be worried but be known arations before the Lord I cry with Thanksgiving and the peace of God and the peace of God suedes all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds to Christ Jesus with prayer with crying out the definition of crying out is to ask into a way you ask in desperation that's the definition according to the and brother said you want God to come you want God to answer in will come and man into desperation with Thanksgiving that's so difficult to give thanks to God it's difficult this I'm going to give it to you thank you thank you I gave it to him thank you no this is yours I'll give it to you later okay okay this again Sor When God says he has a promise for us when we begin to pray we begin to cry out we can see that the promise we just have to get out of knowing that God has answered my pray because your promise because your word is true to me and I will answer I know that you will answer I know that you will give me what I ask for is I claim thank you Lord when you begin to give thanks even though you don't have it that's the beginning give thanks in his presence and says if you got your into the that which you are asking for you give a p another the promise is maned before your eyes you want to combat Rebellion practice humility according to Matthew 26 let this cup passing by will he want to go he didn't want to have to die he subjected himself to what the word said that he had to be that we can have salvation he for and he became the redeeming L when you have your rights can complain all you want re all you want you forfeit your rights and say I'll surrender to the words you become a lamb and remember when John was in Revelation the only that could open up the seals was the lamb you have to turn into a lamb so that the dove can guide you will guide the lamb and then where will it guide it to to the slaughter to die to himself and when you can do that then you turn into that will give life to will
