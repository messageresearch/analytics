sacrifice of calories [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] how can somebody be talking two to three hours in some place Genesis chapter 37 23-24. and he came to pass when Joseph was come unto his Brethren that they stripped Joseph out of his coat his coat of many colors that was on him and they took him and cast him into a pit and the pit was empty there was no water in it you may take your seats I'll be reading on the scripture which is Jonah chapter one verse one two three now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of amateur saying the great City and cry against it for the wickedness has come up before me is to flee from Tarsus from the presence of the Lord and went down to topam though he found a ship going to Tarsus so he paid the fare thereof and went down into it to go with them under Tarsus from the presence of the Lord foreign because he maketh intercessions for the Saints according to the will of God is [Music] and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose and I just want to talk a little bit about what is the plan of God um one time I had to talk about the development of the enrollment of God's plan that God has done is doing or will do is perfect I think that's the best plan that God has made and because God made it it cannot fail any other plan can fail but when God has created a plan when he creates something asked to function perfectly so this morning I wanted to focus on the plan of God these two characters about Joseph and Jonah uh they were both in a very tremendous situation Joseph was in a pit or in a Hole uh he was in a pitiful situation was inside of that fish I'd like to talk a little bit about him how many of the characters I've seen the others have been a little bit more disobedient level they're both children of God foreign [Laughter] that's what's happening today by his foreign so when we see each one of their lives me personally I like to read about the story of Joseph about his life [Music] his entire life how it's going about when I reached the part when he's thrown inside of that pit something touched my heart so then he was in that pit at that time the Bible says that he was hated he was hated Without a Cause but he was in that pit this is his brother had attempted to kill him there I'd like to stay a little bit here on the pit because I believe that each one of us has fined ourselves in many times some have causes and others don't have causes as to why they're there and because I said I have a reason why I'm there people have gone through depression or through problems you say well if they're a good person God is taking care of those details about Jonah foreign Vienna and swallowed by a whale and then when the whales it went to the Bottom of the Sea to rest that's the way a fish does it when it is sometimes don't want to believe that but God had prepared this fish this was a different kind of whale God prepared this one to swallow so he it was a different fish fish Erman how tremendous [Music] how many of us have read in the Bible no one can run away from the things of God foreign uh [Applause] anytime one wants to treat join a certain way but he was actually falling into the purpose let me read this part this is the names of the people this is I um program [Music] to swallow him [Music] he always has a way to rescue foreign [Music] from brothers or sisters he was rescuing a foreign perfectly land in there no they had a meeting inside of the ship okay someone here is wrong so they all cast their Lots when you know you're not doing things you know you can't fool yourself [Music] any other animals on the perfect plan of God escape from the plan of God said oh maybe I'm lost how am I gonna do it maybe there are so many questions even in the following conditions that is a tremendous that God has for us where'd you find yourself perfectly because no one can get lost from the plan of God that's why the seed has to come to life that's why it says that everything according to his purpose it doesn't matter Brothers here was that fish he was waiting for the son of God it was seed of God in him foreign [Music] it's sad for the gospel sometimes God has somebody a person with a problem and that person wants to go and take that problem the prophet says one thing we can do is say God help him I can't take it away you'll be with them you guide him that's the only thing we can do for that brother here was Jonah so he fell in the belly of that whale he had all the time to think about it but there was no need because he had already confessed that it was him foreign [Music] foreign he says that the whale was at the bottom of the ocean here we last one or two hours [Applause] but here was Jonah once again Belly of the whale so he worked and he would say okay that's enough says he walked out if he was bound from his hand his feet that God has for us to do foreign that's when people get closer to the feet of God my time don't give me more time talking about the pit look at me Jose let me talk a little bit about what he said about Joseph this is and it was considered that Jacob his own father thought that his son had been killed how difficult must have been for Joseph knowing he was born when they had killed him to eat it and he knowing all those things but Joseph could have one thing in mind that the hand of God was over him he knew that he was a believer how much lack of cooperation or any other thing Joseph knew that God would fulfill his words [Music] he couldn't flee from the purpose interested foreign Garcia is a message by Brother Bernie he talks a little bit about Jonas and he calls out all of the negative traits about Jonah he's not calling out his defense he's calling out our defense over Renegades like Jonah God has the control to take that Renegade away from us God has the way to bring you back doesn't matter if you don't want to go one way or another God's going to send you to that place sometimes we make our plan like they say you tell God your plans you're going to make him laugh we say I'm going to do this I'm gonna do this I told my wife from now on I'm going to do things backwards so they come out right and they come out the other way around they never come out right foreign [Music] is that his name is Jim that a whale swallowed him he says yes sir well then you ask him do this so it doesn't matter Brothers I don't need a fight with anybody else simply as a little girl said when I find him I'll ask him that was the way to shut that man up yeah well I'll ask him over there well then you can ask him Lord you've given us up to this day thank you for your mercy [Music] thank you for allowing us to be here once again before your presence how much we're still lacking in our lives remove all those things from our lives and as that beautiful hymn says renew me Lord I don't want to be the same [Music] May each day we be better [Music] renew our minds we knew our hearts we knew our lives change our way of thinking change the way we fight come here [Music] be better [Music] to fulfill that plan you have for us because all things that happen to us work for the good thank you Lord [Music] everything you work in our lives it hasn't proven it's all for the better [Music] [Music] blessed be the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord and say s glory to God for the bad times [Music] without them there would be no good times [Music] and even identifying ourselves in the Bible Allah has worked for good yes and to this day you have done extraordinary things in our lives [Music] when you continue working in all things for us I don't care how hard the trials are to this day you've given us the strength to continue so we see that your word is fulfilled it all works for good and that's why I give you things get all this working for it it doesn't matter where you've had it or where you have us going through where you will have us go through yeah help each brother who's here in this place [Music] help me help my brother Jesus help his family Lord [Music] all works for good Lord Jesus we all go through certain circumstances [Music] may you be with her in everything and we give you thanks for everything thank you with all of our hearts in the Lord Jesus Christ we thank you amen amen [Music] [Applause] thank you one sad alone beside the highway begging [Music] his eyes were blind the light he could not see laughs he clogged his arrest and shiver in the shadows then Jesus came and made his Darkness Hallelujah we love you Lord where foreign [Music] he takes the glue [Music] [Applause] [Music] off when Jesus comes to students from home and Friends they both speak strong [Music] among the two he dwell in [Music] it [Applause] [Music] then Jesus came and time said the kind of free Hallelujah when the sky [Music] broken [Music] away [Music] takes and filled the light [Music] on [Music] it when Jesus comes to stay unclean unclean the leper cried in torment the death the dawn [Music] for lessness [Music] out here [Music] [Music] by the way [Music] comes to stay the last verse so man to do I've found they could not care about and sin [Music] they're broken hearts [Music] then Jesus Jesus hey dwell himself with it do you love them [Music] [Applause] [Music] is broken [Music] so
