[27:40] amen God bless you all this
[27:43] morning it's a pleasure to be in the
[27:45] house of the
[27:47] Lord before anything else let us go to
[27:49] the
[27:51] scripture you'd be so
[27:54] kind let us make it simple let's go to
[27:58] Genesis
[28:01] 1 that one's easy if we can't find
[28:04] Genesis Genesis
[28:09] 1 Genesis 1 verse
[28:14] one the word of God reads the
[28:18] following name of Lord Jesus
[28:22] Christ in the beginning God created the
[28:25] Heaven and the
[28:26] Earth
[28:35] and the Earth was without form and void
[28:37] and darkness was upon the face of the
[28:38] deep and the spirit of God moved upon
[28:40] the face of the
[28:44] waters and God said let there be light
[28:46] and there was
[28:51] light and God saw the light that it was
[28:53] good and God divided the light from the
[28:56] darkness
[29:01] and God called the light day and the
[29:03] Darkness he called night and the evening
[29:05] and the morning or the first
[29:08] day may God add the blessing to the
[29:10] reading of his word and be so kind and
[29:13] please take your
[29:17] seats tell him God bless
[29:19] you greet them
[29:22] bless give him a
[29:26] smile
[29:38] we referenced back to the pandemics and
[29:39] it was quite a divide in the history of
[29:44] humanity and many times it's before and
[29:50] after before we should greet ourselves
[29:52] in another way and after the pandemic we
[29:53] all greet ourselves in a different
[29:56] way
[30:00] maybe doing a fist one back then was
[30:01] maybe he doesn't want to greet
[30:05] me no it's like I'm thankful that he
[30:07] greeted me that
[30:10] way there's been quite a
[30:13] divide we're going to greet each other
[30:15] and we're going to bless each other
[30:17] doesn't matter in which way if it's like
[30:19] this if it's like this like
[30:23] that but we're going to bless our
[30:26] brother
[30:29] we're going to make sure that our
[30:30] brother has a prophetic
[30:32] word when we say God bless
[30:36] you desire all the bless in the life of
[30:39] our
[30:41] brother we say brother why do you say
[30:43] that because that's a
[30:47] revelation when you desire the best to
[30:49] your
[30:50] brother what do you believe is going to
[30:53] happen that's going to come back to you
[30:56] as well
[30:58] so be careful what you desire upon your
[31:04] brother glory to God this
[31:06] morning thank
[31:10] God before we continue I'd like to thank
[31:12] our pastor first for he finds himself
[31:15] outside
[31:17] [Music]
[31:20] town I'm thankful that he can still
[31:22] continue to
[31:24] travel and we're always supporting him
[31:27] in
[31:31] prayer trying to support him in anything
[31:33] we
[31:37] can so always remember our pastor in
[31:40] prayer may God give him the strength
[31:42] where
[31:44] find the Holy Spirit manifest itself in
[31:46] a powerful
[31:50] way he may fulfill the purpose for why
[31:52] he is in the place he's at amen
[31:56] amen
[31:59] I believe as brother bam says if anybody
[32:01] needs prayer it is
[32:07] me so our pastor each time we're
[32:09] elevating our prayer to
[32:10] God let us always remember our
[32:19] pastor we're continue with the topic
[32:21] that our pastor has established for the
[32:25] year the spoken word is the Original
[32:37] Seed he already laid down the
[32:46] foundation he already spoke two messages
[32:49] on
[32:51] this the last message from the past
[32:55] year and the first message of the New
[33:01] Year something so something I recommend
[33:04] to each one of
[33:06] us is to be able to go back and listen
[33:08] to what he spoke
[33:11] on many times I tell you it's happened
[33:13] to
[33:19] me I like to take the way I was raised
[33:21] up is I to take notes during the
[33:24] service and I'm constantly taking notes
[33:27] but now there's a
[33:29] problem that many times I don't go back
[33:31] to my
[33:32] notes and what I write down I
[33:36] forget so God is so good with
[33:41] us he says oh my poor
[33:43] children they're so they're so busy so
[33:47] preoccupied that I'm going to help
[33:51] them they don't have to go back to their
[33:53] notes if
[33:55] time
[33:57] I'm going to have them to have I'm going
[33:58] to allow them to have access to the
[33:59] service on their phone back once again
[34:01] so they can listen to it
[34:03] again and so when they're in their car
[34:09] driving instead of thinking things that
[34:11] they shouldn't be thinking
[34:15] on maybe they'll begin to hear the word
[34:17] of God in their
[34:19] car they're Drive 30 to 40 minutes to go
[34:22] to work or do this or the
[34:25] other
[34:28] they could take advantage to drench
[34:29] themselves in my
[34:31] word how good God is with
[34:34] us he gives us that
[34:41] opportunity and many times one says well
[34:43] how am I going to connect myself with my
[34:46] car and so God thought befor said don't
[34:49] worry my
[34:52] son I'm going to advance line so much so
[34:55] that your phone can connect your car
[34:58] you don't have to use Cable in which
[34:59] you're binding
[35:02] yourself I want to turn this way the
[35:05] stuck and now it's all the car's fault
[35:06] and so I'm not going to listen to
[35:08] anything no brother now you don't even
[35:10] need any
[35:16] cables all you have to do is just
[35:18] connect
[35:20] yourself and then you begin to
[35:23] listen the spoken
[35:25] word which is the Original Seed amen
[35:30] amen I don't know if God can make it any
[35:33] simpler than
[35:36] that let us wait on God God always has a
[35:40] surprise now later maybe you just get
[35:43] home you're just going to
[35:45] clap and the speakers will turn
[35:53] on so let us take advantage of what God
[35:55] has for us
[35:58] the spoken word is the Original
[36:03] Seed our pastor read the scripture but
[36:05] he also mentioned another Isaiah
[36:10] 55 this is a very special
[36:16] scripture I'll be reading from verse
[36:22] eight says for my thoughts are not your
[36:25] thoughts
[36:28] neither are your ways my way says the
[36:33] Lord for as the heavens are higher than
[36:36] the
[36:39] earth so are my ways higher than your
[36:45] ways and my thoughts than your
[36:51] thoughts for as the rain cometh down and
[36:53] the snow from
[36:55] heaven and turn not
[36:58] thither but WTH the
[37:02] Earth and make it bring forth and
[37:06] Bud and that it give may give seed to
[37:08] the
[37:10] swer and bread to the
[37:14] eater so shall my word be that goeth
[37:17] forth out of my
[37:19] mouth it shall not return unto me
[37:23] void but it shall accomplish that which
[37:25] I please
[37:29] and it shall prosper in the thing where
[37:31] to I sent
[37:32] it what a tremendous
[37:37] scripture in Isaiah
[37:44] 551 it speaks to that the word that goes
[37:47] forth out of my mouth shall not return
[37:51] void now in Genesis
[37:55] 1
[37:57] it says that the Earth was without form
[37:59] and
[38:01] void in Isaiah
[38:05] 5511 it says the word that cometh forth
[38:07] of my
[38:08] mouth it will not return
[38:13] void the Earth was without form and
[38:18] void the darkness was dominion over the
[38:22] Earth but the spirit of
[38:25] God and moved on the surface of the
[38:28] water and in that
[38:31] void in that
[38:33] Darkness there was absolutely
[38:36] nothing it was without form and
[38:41] void but then but then God spoke the
[38:44] word and said let there be
[38:49] light God began to
[38:52] project what he
[38:55] desired through his
[38:57] word because Isaiah tells
[39:00] us that each time God
[39:04] speaks it has a purpose for why he send
[39:07] that
[39:09] word the word of
[39:12] God it never goes without a
[39:21] purpose one of the translations of the
[39:23] Bible is God speaks
[39:25] today
[39:28] Isaiah 5511 says the
[39:32] following likewise the word that come
[39:34] out of my
[39:37] lips does not return to me without
[39:39] producing an
[39:41] effect but it does what I
[39:45] desire and fulfills the order which I
[39:49] give it fulfills the order that I
[39:54] give so what the word is telling
[39:57] that when we
[39:59] speak the word is not
[40:02] empty it
[40:04] automatically it will produce an effect
[40:08] because within the
[40:09] word there's a series of
[40:12] instructions within the
[40:14] word there's a series of
[40:18] orders and that word will produce inside
[40:21] of for which I have sent it
[40:25] for
[40:29] now the Earth was without form and
[40:31] vo and God is giving us the
[40:35] key that the spoken word is the Original
[40:41] Seed the prophet tells
[40:45] us in the message the spoken word is the
[40:47] Original
[40:52] Seed he says remember every word of God
[40:55] is the original
[40:58] seed God planted everything on Earth by
[41:01] his
[41:04] word and as long as you stay with the
[41:06] Original
[41:09] Seed she will once again reproduce
[41:12] exactly the
[41:17] same the breeding or mixing of that
[41:20] word produces
[41:23] death now
[41:25] note and this God saw
[41:29] previously he predestinated a world of
[41:32] of sons and
[41:34] daughters he predestinated them to be
[41:39] there the disbelief of the word of God
[41:41] caused
[41:44] hybrid but God has restored it as it was
[41:46] in the
[41:50] beginning so you would no longer have to
[41:52] be a
[41:55] hybrid you can return to the original
[41:58] word and be a Son of
[42:02] God just as it was supposed to be from
[42:05] the
[42:06] beginning so brother
[42:08] brandham when he speaks this
[42:12] message he begins to attack with
[42:14] everything he
[42:19] has over the word of God may be made
[42:23] hybrid the mixture of the word of God
[42:27] with human
[42:29] ideas with personal
[42:33] ideas he says each time the word of God
[42:36] is mixed
[42:37] up it would also produce a
[42:40] result because what the devil looks for
[42:44] is to take the word of
[42:46] God and use the same word of
[42:50] God because he knows that the spoken
[42:52] word is the
[42:54] original and he takes the promise
[42:57] the same word of God and he sends it and
[43:01] he begins speak because it will bring
[43:05] forth in the beginning he took the
[43:07] promise of
[43:08] God and that's how he deceived the
[43:14] woman 99.99% of the
[43:18] word small percentage was was was
[43:21] distorted and with
[43:23] that he brought death
[43:27] that's why brother brandham
[43:30] says the way the way which we will go
[43:35] [Music]
[43:36] back is being able to believe in the
[43:39] word of
[43:41] God not mixing it with our personal
[43:45] thoughts not mixing it with our
[43:48] emotions not mixing it with what we
[43:51] think we have to go to the source
[43:56] to the Eternal
[43:58] Fountain that's why in the
[44:01] beginning the Earth was without form and
[44:06] void God began to unravel the plan he
[44:10] had to wherever there is no order there
[44:13] can come
[44:17] order the only way to bring
[44:20] order in a family where there's
[44:23] disorder in a life that's out of order
[44:28] it's through the spoken word of
[44:30] God because that's the original
[44:33] SE so when God saw the Earth out of form
[44:37] and
[44:38] vo that did not limit
[44:41] God for
[44:42] so we have to
[44:45] understand the time we're living
[44:48] in we don't have to
[44:51] focus on the situation which we find
[44:53] ourselves
[44:54] in because we will never understand what
[44:59] God's plan
[45:00] is as long as we're
[45:04] focusing the situation or the problem in
[45:06] which we find
[45:09] ourselves when God allows for battles
[45:11] and trials to
[45:13] come and we focus on that on that test
[45:17] on that F
[45:19] fight then the purpose of God is not
[45:22] fulfilled because that
[45:24] trial that we may
[45:27] understand of who we
[45:30] are when the
[45:32] test and it looks
[45:35] disorganized it seems like everything is
[45:38] dark that is where we have to
[45:40] start put into practice what we have
[45:44] learned don't try to understand the
[45:49] situation try ask why am in the
[45:51] situation which I find
[45:53] myself because
[45:54] always
[45:56] whenever we look at the
[45:58] circumstances we will never have the
[46:01] revelation of who I
[46:03] am within their
[46:08] circumstance that's the way it
[46:10] is let us look at the
[46:12] problem we're going to see the problem
[46:14] bigger than it
[46:16] is instead of seeing the problem that's
[46:20] smaller
[46:23] that's says for my thoughts are not your
[46:27] thought God has hidden his
[46:31] thoughts so that no one can have access
[46:33] to them he has and he has
[46:39] protected my thoughts are not your
[46:42] thoughts my ways are not like
[46:45] your my thoughts are higher my ways are
[46:48] higher
[46:52] why because you can't walk higher than
[46:54] what you think
[46:57] your path reflects your
[47:00] thoughts if you see a person
[47:04] walking they will reflect in they will
[47:07] reflect their thoughts
[47:10] projected you can't live higher than
[47:12] your
[47:15] confession your confession will never be
[47:17] higher than your
[47:19] thoughts that is why God hid his
[47:24] thoughts
[47:26] and for a long time there was not access
[47:28] to the thoughts of
[47:32] God that's why God he began to
[47:35] condescend and hit and inside of Christ
[47:38] that's why in Christ the prophet
[47:41] came he spoke Christ is the mystery of
[47:44] God
[47:46] revealed because Christ is in the
[47:48] thoughts of
[47:52] God for not to see and understand the
[47:54] thoughts of God
[47:58] we have to see Christ revealed in front
[47:59] of us because
[48:02] Christ he's the mystery of God which
[48:05] have been revealed in this
[48:09] time so we can have access to the
[48:12] thoughts of
[48:14] God so now we can see and understand
[48:17] God's plan in this age in this
[48:22] time and for me as an
[48:24] individual
[48:28] while we focus in the
[48:32] disorder we will never understand God's
[48:35] purpose for our
[48:37] lives while we focus in the problems we
[48:42] have we will never understand what God
[48:44] wants to reveal in
[48:46] us God wants to reveal to Christ
[48:50] Christ the anointing of God Christ the
[48:54] word God wants to use us to reveal his
[48:58] power God wants to use us to reveal his
[49:03] glory but to reveal the word of God and
[49:07] word when we're in a contrary
[49:11] situation we have to go to this written
[49:15] word because that's where the mystery
[49:19] is the revealed word comes it takes the
[49:22] written word it brings it to our heart
[49:29] then the mystery of God begins to open
[49:30] up in our
[49:32] lives when we begin to
[49:35] see that the spirit of God
[49:37] moves on the face of the
[49:40] waters over the
[49:42] people in my situation in my
[49:46] problem God has not forsaken
[49:50] me God is there with
[49:53] me God is always there with us
[49:58] but we have to understand that we're
[49:59] under a
[50:01] test because God is watching our
[50:04] Behavior up to
[50:07] now well at least I have not seen maybe
[50:10] you
[50:11] have that a teacher during a
[50:14] test with the student like no you got
[50:16] that one 5 plus five is 10 not
[50:21] nine the teacher is never there with the
[50:24] student while the student does the
[50:27] test the teacher is
[50:30] just that's when he least
[50:36] speaks what God doesn't talk to me he
[50:38] never answers no God
[50:41] is because God already
[50:45] showed now he's waiting for me to show
[50:47] what I have
[50:50] learned he's given me an opportunity to
[50:52] display his
[50:54] glory I can display who he
[50:57] is that can display his
[51:00] love that can display his
[51:04] Pard I can display his power God is
[51:08] watching that he can manifest what he
[51:12] is what he
[51:14] is through
[51:16] us that's what the trial is
[51:19] for the test is not to destroy a child
[51:23] of is to build and
[51:26] to rest him
[51:28] to to restore him to his original state
[51:31] not to destroy him if you're in a trial
[51:35] if you're in a fight the spirit of God
[51:37] is there with you but what we have to
[51:40] do
[51:42] is is mix the mechanic with the
[51:45] dynamic bring the power of God to
[51:48] manifestation because within that
[51:50] seene there is hidden
[51:53] power will that power to
[51:58] manifest when we begin to use the power
[52:00] of the spoken word that's the only
[52:04] way because then Christ will manifest
[52:07] himself the Myst mystery will begin to
[52:09] be revealed because now it's no
[52:12] longer it is god in me
[52:15] speaking it's no longer me
[52:18] speaking word made
[52:21] flesh BR
[52:23] manifestation GL power of
[52:31] God that is why the prophet
[52:35] said that when the spirit of God would
[52:38] move even though it was out of order
[52:41] even though it was
[52:44] void but he already had within him his
[52:47] thoughts he had an
[52:50] image the only thing that he had to
[52:53] do was to release the
[52:58] that the image would come to
[53:00] manifest that the vision would
[53:03] fulfill he had to
[53:07] speak so the Earth would no longer be
[53:09] without
[53:10] for but God had a
[53:13] purpose because even in that
[53:17] disorder even in that Darkness the
[53:20] prophet
[53:21] say that there was
[53:24] seed was predestinated
[53:27] seed there was God working with a
[53:30] seed he had already created
[53:33] it now it was causing a
[53:35] process to bring the seed to
[53:42] life above our life or our
[53:45] situation it may seem that there's chaos
[53:48] that there's
[53:49] disorder that there's sadness that
[53:52] there's
[53:53] worry that there's
[53:55] loneliness there's
[53:59] incomprehension but in seeing all of
[54:01] that within that
[54:05] life which may seem alone sad
[54:09] again mixed
[54:11] up there is a
[54:15] seed and the spirit of
[54:19] God will bring that seed to
[54:22] life without mattering the conse the uh
[54:25] the the
[54:27] situation that's
[54:29] why within
[54:32] us there is something always crying out
[54:36] there's always a
[54:38] cry that's why in the messages we are
[54:40] listening to on
[54:43] Thursdays The Original
[54:46] Seed crying out for
[54:48] Perfection because within us there is a
[54:52] cry to be able to be perfect
[54:57] because we were
[55:00] perfect we're in a fallen State because
[55:03] of but we're crying out to go back to
[55:06] that
[55:07] Perfection constantly there is a cry
[55:10] within
[55:12] us but we need to make contact with that
[55:16] God have contact through
[55:19] Revelation to understand that this order
[55:21] that there's in our
[55:22] surroundings it's not to destroy us
[55:26] it's to reveal who we truly
[55:28] are Faith always reveals
[55:30] itself when the situation is difficult
[55:34] now when everything is
[55:36] well that's the way it
[55:47] is so the exterior circumstances cannot
[55:49] stop the
[55:52] seed they
[55:54] can't but the
[55:56] seed it has to
[55:58] fight against
[56:00] anxiety against
[56:02] nervousness against
[56:04] stress against
[56:06] depression against bad
[56:12] habits has to fight to get to work
[56:17] early has to fight with his
[56:21] family but the greatest thing he has to
[56:23] fight against himself
[56:27] to be able to manifest the
[56:32] seed
[56:35] now Isaiah 551 55
[56:39] 8-1 my
[56:44] words The New American Bible
[56:49] says in that way will be the word that
[56:51] comes out of my mouth it will not return
[56:54] empty
[56:55] [Music]
[56:57] without realizing what I
[57:01] desire and accomplished the purpose for
[57:03] which I sent
[57:06] it in the New Living Translation of the
[57:11] Bible that that way is my word I sent
[57:16] it and it always produces
[57:19] fruit it always produces
[57:22] fruit so it doesn't matter what you're
[57:26] speaking you're always producing
[57:34] fruits it says it brings forth what I
[57:38] want and prospers wherever I sent
[57:42] it that places a responsibility
[57:45] over to be careful what I
[57:52] speak but in order to know that to be
[57:54] careful of what I speak be
[57:57] careful because you can never speak
[57:59] higher than your
[58:02] thoughts your confession will never be
[58:05] higher than what you
[58:07] think to be able to speak a word with
[58:14] power my thoughts have to reach a level
[58:16] in which I can have the thoughts of
[58:23] God
[58:25] have to speak and be able to say Lord
[58:27] now I understand your
[58:31] thought the only way I can get there and
[58:33] understand the thoughts of
[58:38] God Is by knowing that God has expressed
[58:40] his thoughts throughout the
[58:42] word but the word
[58:45] kills but the spirit
[58:49] quickens so I need to look for the
[58:52] Revelation more than anything else
[58:57] so you may help me Quicken the word
[58:58] that's
[59:02] been so now this word that's been
[59:03] written may be engraved in my
[59:07] heart so now that it's a revealed
[59:12] word so now when you can see
[59:14] it and we can see in our
[59:18] surround now will be Christ speaking and
[59:20] talking through
[59:23] me that is why we need the
[59:27] Revelation because the first step to be
[59:29] able to get to that
[59:30] Lev is that we have to Humble
[59:33] ourselves we don't have to go up we have
[59:37] to go
[59:39] down and understand that each
[59:42] moment in life God
[59:45] will manifest the glory of God in our
[59:52] lives now with our thoughts and our
[59:56] worst that's said my ways are not like
[59:59] your
[1:00:01] ways because your thoughts are not like
[1:00:04] my
[1:00:07] thoughts and our actions will produce
[1:00:12] habits our habits will form our
[1:00:19] attitude our habits will form our
[1:00:23] attitude
[1:00:25] and our attitude will form our
[1:00:28] character and our character will take us
[1:00:29] to a
[1:00:35] destination Propet said that the Lord
[1:00:37] Jesus Christ only comes for one thing
[1:00:38] and that's what he's searching
[1:00:39] for it's a church with
[1:00:44] character but that character developed
[1:00:46] through having a good
[1:00:49] attitude last time we spoke about the
[1:00:51] challenge of the present
[1:00:53] hour is to be able to have a correct
[1:00:57] attitude towards any promise that God
[1:00:59] has
[1:01:05] spoken as we have our attitude we have
[1:01:07] to look at
[1:01:10] our our habits uh make up the structure
[1:01:13] of
[1:01:14] our we can think
[1:01:17] one when they become words and actions
[1:01:21] become you're forming a
[1:01:23] structure
[1:01:25] where the Holy Spirit can come and
[1:01:27] dwell that's why brother bam
[1:01:29] said when they created a beautiful
[1:01:32] building it was large it was wonderful
[1:01:35] and it was be a
[1:01:36] mum but they were never able to use it
[1:01:39] no one could go
[1:01:43] ins because they didn't have a strong
[1:01:45] enough
[1:01:48] Foundation the
[1:01:51] attitude our foundation to be deep
[1:01:55] our
[1:01:56] attitude the attitude that we
[1:01:59] have how do we look at
[1:02:04] things and we make an effort to look at
[1:02:07] things in a more
[1:02:09] POS make an effort to take the word and
[1:02:11] apply
[1:02:13] it that is only done through
[1:02:16] habits when they asked brother
[1:02:21] brandom one of the greatest things that
[1:02:23] a Christian could
[1:02:27] desire is to enter into the love of the
[1:02:30] Lord amen
[1:02:34] amen when they asked brother B said
[1:02:38] God it says what a simple
[1:02:43] question but so deep how can I enter in
[1:02:45] more into the love the
[1:02:47] Lord when I heard brother random answer
[1:02:50] that
[1:02:52] question I was like this and my JW
[1:02:56] dropped like they doing the cartoons
[1:02:58] that's that's the way I imagined
[1:03:01] it because the answer was so
[1:03:05] simple he says let's go to the next
[1:03:10] question he says read the word and
[1:03:13] pray said read the word and
[1:03:16] pray read the word and
[1:03:19] pray is a
[1:03:21] verb pray is also a verb
[1:03:24] they're verbs of action they're
[1:03:29] habits there are things that we have to
[1:03:32] do there are things that we have to
[1:03:35] form as part of our
[1:03:38] Lives an essential part of our
[1:03:46] Liv the brother's here so don't forget
[1:03:48] to
[1:03:50] pray pray for the food and give thanks
[1:03:52] for everything don't forget
[1:03:57] night when we
[1:04:00] SLE I'm you know I'm very sleepy amen
[1:04:07] amen it's a
[1:04:12] [Music]
[1:04:15] habit a habit is something that will
[1:04:17] lead you to always do the same thing
[1:04:20] over and
[1:04:23] over I have a
[1:04:25] coworker that he has the
[1:04:31] Habit he wakes up at midnight almost 3:
[1:04:33] in the
[1:04:37] morning and he has a treatment per se
[1:04:41] he's not
[1:04:44] sick but it's something he found that
[1:04:46] would benefit his
[1:04:53] health he goes into a a water tub every
[1:04:58] morning with ice cold
[1:05:02] water
[1:05:08] plch it's a cold plch and
[1:05:11] water he's in there six
[1:05:13] minutes six
[1:05:16] minutes all that sticks out is his
[1:05:21] head this morning I tried to do it when
[1:05:23] I was going to shower
[1:05:26] not go into the water but just turn on
[1:05:28] the cold
[1:05:30] water you could hear my yell throughout
[1:05:32] the whole
[1:05:35] house if anything was about 5 Seconds
[1:05:37] that was it that's something
[1:05:40] crazy but for him it became a
[1:05:45] habit it's something that's healthy he's
[1:05:47] happy and he's seeing the
[1:05:49] results so that's the way habits
[1:05:52] are and
[1:05:55] that that wakes him up at 3 in the
[1:05:57] morning of having a
[1:06:01] purpose that's why many times when
[1:06:03] people get up late for me that I
[1:06:06] see is that they don't have a purpose in
[1:06:10] life they don't have a reason for which
[1:06:12] to get
[1:06:14] up they get up at 10 in the
[1:06:17] morning and they say my day just doesn't
[1:06:21] last how's it going to last if you wake
[1:06:23] up almost at
[1:06:26] midday something else let us continue
[1:06:29] with the
[1:06:31] theme the prophet
[1:06:33] said I'll begin to
[1:06:36] close and everything under
[1:06:39] control in the message God's power to
[1:06:43] transform to bring forth its kind now
[1:06:47] remember to
[1:06:50] bring when he put the seed in the Earth
[1:06:57] the seed can only come forth with the
[1:06:59] power of life within
[1:07:02] it to transform it from a seed to a
[1:07:05] plant or whatever it
[1:07:07] was his transforming
[1:07:11] power now God put the seed in
[1:07:16] there with potentials that it would be
[1:07:18] what he said it would
[1:07:21] be and as long as it stayed in its right
[1:07:26] C it would be just exactly what God said
[1:07:28] it would
[1:07:30] be it had to be that
[1:07:34] way because he had made it that way and
[1:07:36] made a
[1:07:41] channel that anything that says in his
[1:07:43] channel in his line of
[1:07:49] word it will have to bring forth exactly
[1:07:51] like his word said it would do
[1:07:54] it cannot move from
[1:07:56] there it's channeled just exactly
[1:07:59] right so with
[1:08:02] everything and the trust in his own
[1:08:05] son that it would be that
[1:08:08] way then God
[1:08:10] said it's all
[1:08:12] good so I'll just
[1:08:15] rest and each one of those
[1:08:18] seeds has power in
[1:08:22] itself
[1:08:24] to transform itself into the species
[1:08:26] that I desire it to
[1:08:27] be each
[1:08:29] seed within
[1:08:31] itself has the
[1:08:35] power for itself to
[1:08:39] transform it doesn't have to wait for
[1:08:40] someone to come
[1:08:42] trans have the power in
[1:08:45] itself to begin to transform itself all
[1:08:48] it has to
[1:08:49] do is to understand
[1:08:52] position an eternal
[1:08:54] seed in this
[1:08:57] time to manifest the glory of God not to
[1:09:02] beest is to be
[1:09:05] restored any difficult
[1:09:07] situation it's not to
[1:09:10] destroy God in
[1:09:13] yourself have the
[1:09:15] opportunity to be part of the plan of
[1:09:19] God I say now I
[1:09:22] am walking in the age
[1:09:24] of I have heard the voice that tells me
[1:09:28] my son come up
[1:09:31] higher and I will show you other things
[1:09:34] which you have never
[1:09:36] heard I reveal something you've never
[1:09:38] seen I will tell
[1:09:41] you Christ is the mystery of God
[1:09:43] revealed I'm going to tell you my plan
[1:09:46] that I want to live within you I desire
[1:09:49] to be in your heart that I don't
[1:09:52] care simply listen
[1:09:55] and Obey what I have to tell
[1:09:57] you when Abraham
[1:10:02] received the benefit of the spoken
[1:10:05] word he was going to sacrifice his
[1:10:09] son he had to do what he did not desire
[1:10:12] to but his
[1:10:15] obedience took him to fulfill what
[1:10:18] God he was with pain he was with
[1:10:22] heartbreak but he had to obey the
[1:10:26] word which was spoken to
[1:10:28] him the word was spoken he God the
[1:10:34] Eternal
[1:10:35] God had required a sacrifice and
[1:10:39] Abraham he
[1:10:41] placed in the line of the word in the
[1:10:45] right
[1:10:46] channel I don't desire to do
[1:10:49] this but you are
[1:10:51] powerful you gave them to me
[1:10:55] you give him amongst the
[1:10:59] dead so I know you have the power to
[1:11:01] bring him back to
[1:11:03] life The Obedience of
[1:11:06] abrah he was about to sacrifice his
[1:11:09] son a ram
[1:11:12] appeared where there could be no
[1:11:15] Rams there was no
[1:11:18] way for a ram to appear in that place
[1:11:22] but the spoken word It
[1:11:24] produced through
[1:11:27] Abraham a manifestation of God and
[1:11:30] Abraham
[1:11:32] said now he will be
[1:11:34] Jehovah Jehovah will
[1:11:36] provide because the
[1:11:38] sacrifice
[1:11:41] obedience the power of the spoken word
[1:11:44] to be
[1:11:45] manifested The
[1:11:48] Obedience that goes against
[1:11:50] thought even against himself but he was
[1:11:55] loyal you say if God took it
[1:11:58] away God promised it he gave me a vision
[1:12:03] he told
[1:12:04] me that my
[1:12:06] descendant be like the stars in the
[1:12:09] sky he told me he says look at the
[1:12:12] vision can you see the
[1:12:14] stars can you count the the the sand in
[1:12:17] the
[1:12:18] sea no lord I can't so that where your
[1:12:22] lineage will be with your son with
[1:12:26] Isaac so then he
[1:12:29] knew that God could not go against his
[1:12:31] own
[1:12:32] word if he sacrificed his
[1:12:36] son his son would have to come back to
[1:12:38] life that's the power of the spoken
[1:12:41] word but to be able to bring it to
[1:12:45] manifestation there has to be a
[1:12:47] structure in the human heart there to be
[1:12:49] a desire a crying
[1:12:52] out to obey
[1:12:55] God against my own
[1:13:03] thoughts that's where the power of the
[1:13:05] spoken word
[1:13:06] manifest not in our complaints no
[1:13:10] no but in the
[1:13:12] Revelation that God is
[1:13:15] Almighty and he will bring it to
[1:13:18] manifestation what he promised that's it
[1:13:21] period i mix the word with my own
[1:13:25] thoughts mix the word with the anointing
[1:13:28] of
[1:13:29] L I will
[1:13:31] stay The Original Seed because the
[1:13:35] Original
[1:13:36] Seed is the spoken word in the spoken
[1:13:40] word has power it has
[1:13:44] power it has to manifest itself through
[1:13:48] Christ now I have to
[1:13:51] decide I'm going to let that word to
[1:13:53] manifest itself within
[1:13:56] me I'll be
[1:13:58] finishing if the musicians can come
[1:14:00] forward said brother Bram
[1:14:04] says in the
[1:14:10] message the future home of the Heavenly
[1:14:13] groom and the Earthly
[1:14:18] bride preached in
[1:14:22] 1964
[1:14:25] now talking about the Samaritan
[1:14:27] woman he says that
[1:14:30] woman she was a
[1:14:36] prostitute she was all
[1:14:40] stained but deep inside of
[1:14:44] her there was a little bit of
[1:14:50] understanding I know that when the
[1:14:52] Messiah comes
[1:14:54] that's all that she
[1:14:56] knew she was a
[1:15:00] prostitute brother Bram has
[1:15:04] said that from very young her parents
[1:15:06] had cast her
[1:15:08] out when she was 18 years
[1:15:11] old she had her personal Encounter With
[1:15:18] Jesus she was 18 years old in St John
[1:15:22] 4
[1:15:24] [Music]
[1:15:29] that was
[1:15:30] there but that little young
[1:15:33] lady even though she had that
[1:15:40] understanding she had nothing to offer
[1:15:42] or
[1:15:44] present she was a worldly filthy
[1:15:47] woman filthier than you can think
[1:15:52] of
[1:15:54] but notice said brother
[1:15:55] brandham within
[1:15:59] her she had
[1:16:03] representation in that
[1:16:06] disorder in that
[1:16:08] [Music]
[1:16:12] Darkness AC every
[1:16:17] C there was an eternal
[1:16:21] seed there was
[1:16:26] presentation she was Desiring in her
[1:16:31] heart that the promise of the Messiah be
[1:16:33] made
[1:16:35] flesh she
[1:16:37] said
[1:16:40] Lord you not be
[1:16:43] El like the religious
[1:16:48] say the religious had the same
[1:16:52] opportunity to have that experience with
[1:16:54] Christ the
[1:16:56] word access to the hidden thoughts of
[1:17:00] God through Christ the anointed the
[1:17:04] word but they rejected
[1:17:07] it the religious rejected
[1:17:12] it and this woman that had nothing to
[1:17:14] offer said
[1:17:16] Lord I perceive that thou are a
[1:17:19] prophet
[1:17:21] now now we know that the
[1:17:23] mes called the Christ shall come and
[1:17:27] when he comes he will do these
[1:17:30] things he
[1:17:32] said said I am and
[1:17:36] she she had no
[1:17:39] doubts she had no
[1:17:42] [Music]
[1:17:45] doubt he did not have to
[1:17:48] explain she saw him she believed it
[1:17:54] and she went with the word of the
[1:17:58] hour
[1:18:00] [Music]
[1:18:02] why why did she do Happ to her what is
[1:18:05] it that happened he redeemed
[1:18:09] her he came to be a
[1:18:12] redeemer and what does redeem
[1:18:14] mean it means to bring
[1:18:17] back heing he came to redeem
[1:18:21] her in her disaster and her
[1:18:24] disorder with an empty
[1:18:26] heart with a a life pie with a sick
[1:18:31] life was eternal
[1:18:33] seed when the Eternal
[1:18:37] seed contact with the Messiah the
[1:18:41] word anointing of God once again the
[1:18:44] spirit of God
[1:18:47] moving brought to
[1:18:51] manifestation etal seed that was inside
[1:18:53] of that
[1:18:55] woman he came to redeem that what was
[1:18:58] lost and that
[1:19:01] woman she had been binded
[1:19:05] up she got caught up in all the things
[1:19:07] of the
[1:19:08] Fall she was all caught
[1:19:12] up but God had her in his
[1:19:15] thoughts God had her in his
[1:19:20] thoughts before the foundation of the
[1:19:22] world
[1:19:23] and he
[1:19:24] came to cleanse her and then in that
[1:19:31] moment she had eternal
[1:19:34] life contact with the
[1:19:38] Messiah the eternal life that was
[1:19:40] within came out to
[1:19:45] manifestation please
[1:19:49] [Music]
[1:19:50] stand what made it happen
[1:19:54] the power of the spoken
[1:19:58] word not only did he forgive the woman
[1:20:02] he cleansed her He restored her and he
[1:20:06] placed
[1:20:07] her in the line with the channel of God
[1:20:12] now the vision that had been
[1:20:14] projected in the thought of
[1:20:17] God throughout the
[1:20:19] ages his thought
[1:20:21] travels his word was spoken even
[1:20:25] before that the
[1:20:28] Earth my daughter will be
[1:20:32] manifested my daughter will be
[1:20:34] manifested very at certain
[1:20:38] time Jesus never saw the condition of a
[1:20:42] woman he saw the Eternal representation
[1:20:44] that she
[1:20:46] had he saw her
[1:20:49] heart and even though she was caught up
[1:20:51] with life
[1:20:53] the spoken word of
[1:20:55] God brought her to her original
[1:20:59] condition if we can
[1:21:01] recognize what is our original
[1:21:05] condition and now we have the power to
[1:21:09] activate the spoken word we have to
[1:21:12] speak it with Revelation with
[1:21:16] confidence that whatever we say will be
[1:21:20] fulfilled because my word has sent it

[1:21:46] manifest because I have seen the
[1:21:48] vision of what I truly
[1:21:51] am
[1:21:53] Jesus Christ had opened
[1:21:55] his now Jesus told me ask whatever you
[1:22:00] need that believeth all things are
[1:22:05] possible he says you have to do these
[1:22:07] things he says if you believe you can't
[1:22:10] believe all things are possible because
[1:22:13] now we have
[1:22:15] access to the thoughts of God
[1:22:19] through through the prophet messenger
