[29:27] way
[29:28] I'll put in your hands
[29:32] [Music]
[29:34] perfect and divine will
[29:36] name the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
[29:41] foreign
[29:52] [Music]
[30:07] it's one of the last books it's a very
[30:09] short book
[30:11] s
[30:14] opportunity to take advantage of this
[30:17] time I think the Lord and my pastor for
[30:18] the opportunity
[30:21] it's a lot of trust that he's placed on
[30:23] me
[30:25] I hope that he's proud
[30:29] in the word of God reads
[30:32] is
[30:35] [Music]
[30:41] for this is the love of God that we keep
[30:44] his Commandments and his Commandments
[30:45] are not Grievous
[30:49] Al Mundo yesterday
[30:55] for whatsoever is born of God overcometh
[30:58] the world and this is the victory that
[30:59] overcometh the world even our faith amen
[31:02] Reynolds amen
[31:03] you may take your sheets Brothers
[31:08] I liked a lot when I read the scripture
[31:13] is
[31:24] when I heard that word Grievous
[31:28] it's almost as I understood but I also
[31:31] didn't understand at the same time
[31:34] it's like I knew where the word came
[31:36] from
[31:38] but I didn't understand how the word was
[31:40] being used
[31:43] when I want to go look what a man's or
[31:45] where they come from
[31:50] another word which is grave
[31:53] or something a word that means heavy
[31:57] [Music]
[31:59] the Commandments of God are not in that
[32:01] way
[32:07] that's a word that's usually used to
[32:08] talking something in a negative way
[32:13] so if you didn't know I can explain a
[32:15] little bit here
[32:18] I hope that helped you a little bit
[32:21] we're going to continue with how can I
[32:23] overcome
[32:25] and it's a very beautiful topic
[32:30] the more we read about the topic the
[32:32] more we learn
[32:35] more things are revealed
[32:39] when you think our everything has
[32:41] already been covered
[32:46] did you open a whole new point of view
[32:50] um
[32:54] how many are ready to serve the Lord
[33:00] sometimes we think well it's not my law
[33:02] to preach
[33:11] we all have to be at 100 when we come to
[33:14] church
[33:15] we all have a part in the plan of God
[33:20] we all have to be completely prepared
[33:23] we have to all be on the same page amen
[33:26] amen
[33:28] because we're like an army
[33:30] if one does not do his part or the other
[33:34] doesn't do his part
[33:38] that you can damage perhaps another
[33:39] department amen amen amen
[33:43] so we continue
[33:45] uh
[33:48] Hermanos when we come at church brothers
[33:51] [Music]
[33:53] and we're preparing ourselves
[33:57] maybe that same day or maybe the
[33:59] previous day
[34:10] [Music]
[34:15] we have to come to church
[34:19] that if it's healing
[34:23] spiritual if you don't feel that you're
[34:25] right with your spiritual life
[34:27] that we have to come with that in mind
[34:31] we have to come and believing that
[34:34] that's going to improve
[34:39] we have to come expecting that God is
[34:41] going to work on those things amen amen
[34:46] because even though God knows all things
[34:50] he likes when his children ask him
[34:54] he likes when you go to him in prayer he
[34:57] says
[35:00] and you ask him for what you need
[35:02] or you ask him for someone else
[35:06] because that is where God sees
[35:08] he sees your character
[35:14] he sees what stage you're on in your
[35:16] spiritual life
[35:19] and he can give you what you need in
[35:21] your life
[35:27] so I read a quote from Brother Benham
[35:29] speaking on this topic
[35:33] the message is led by the Holy Spirit
[35:36] from 1952.
[35:39] like what it says he says
[35:45] he says you get what you're looking for
[35:49] instance
[35:51] If You're Expecting tonight to get
[35:53] healed you're going to get healed
[35:58] have you come to the meeting tonight to
[36:00] say well I'll see what goes on
[36:02] yo
[36:07] okay
[36:08] if you say I know that's not right
[36:13] the devil will show you something that
[36:15] isn't right
[36:19] it depends on you
[36:22] what do you want in today
[36:25] do you want a blessing do you want to
[36:28] live better or do you want to leave
[36:30] worse man amen
[36:33] it's something that's just like
[36:34] everything else is
[36:36] something in which you need to practice
[36:39] something in which you need knowledge
[36:46] you don't just say I'm gonna overcome I
[36:48] have to know anything I'm just going to
[36:49] do it
[36:51] which is like an athlete or a teacher a
[36:54] doctor
[36:56] it's something you have to study
[36:59] it's something you have to learn
[37:02] something that requires practice
[37:04] Ben says Ben says Ben says
[37:07] you overcome overcome in the bacteria
[37:09] and the victories become bigger and
[37:10] bigger Allah
[37:15] maybe you say well brother I haven't
[37:17] seen any great miracle in my life
[37:23] I haven't seen God save me from a great
[37:25] accent or nothing has happened to me
[37:32] sooner than later
[37:34] but we're going to go through it
[37:36] [Music]
[37:39] and God's going to give us the trials
[37:41] that we need
[37:42] that we can withstandard
[37:47] he's not going to give us something
[37:48] bigger if we're already start barely
[37:50] starting off
[37:51] because he wants us to grow
[37:54] in the small victories
[37:58] then the next victims get larger
[38:01] and then you get the greatest one of all
[38:03] hello and then when you look back
[38:10] did you see that if it wouldn't have
[38:12] been for God you wouldn't have made it
[38:16] because it's something that has no
[38:18] explanations
[38:23] it's something that the human mind
[38:25] cannot comprehend amen Brothers
[38:29] are you throw
[38:31] uh
[38:33] there's another Court here quote here
[38:35] that I'd like to mention
[38:37] it's the the heart the door to the heart
[38:40] the uh
[38:43] hear them in the beginning of the
[38:45] message uh he said
[38:49] he says that's the way it is with the
[38:52] church
[38:56] God is painting a picture of a beautiful
[38:59] holy church
[39:03] and before it can ever be taken from the
[39:05] earth
[39:09] in the Palace of God
[39:13] a first must pass down the line of the
[39:16] critics amen Brothers
[39:22] here we're being compared to a painting
[39:25] or to a picture
[39:28] or drawing or whatever you want to call
[39:30] it uh okay
[39:35] foreign
[40:35] amen amen
[40:39] because there's things that only God
[40:42] himself can do yeah amen amen
[40:46] it's like if I was at work
[40:50] I've had the privilege to watch some
[40:53] surgeries
[40:56] let's say I start telling the doctor
[40:58] what don't do that oh stop doing that
[41:03] if I'm lucky they're going to tell me to
[41:05] get out the surgery room
[41:07] because it's something that you don't do
[41:12] is
[41:13] you let that person do it because
[41:15] they've done it for years
[41:21] and everything they needed in order to
[41:23] do that yes it's the same way with God
[41:25] yes
[41:27] and it's even more so with God
[41:31] because he knows all things
[41:35] everything we've seen and everything we
[41:37] haven't seen
[41:39] he already knows it man amen
[41:47] all that live Godly in Christ Jesus
[41:49] shall suffer persecutions
[41:52] also
[41:57] we're we're two parents the manner of
[41:59] evil about you falsely for my name's
[42:01] sake mintiendo
[42:03] he is
[42:08] and this artist painted the picture of
[42:10] Jesus knocking at the door
[42:14] when it went through the critics
[42:16] [Music]
[42:17] one rose and said
[42:24] sir there's just one thing that I can
[42:26] find wrong with the picture is
[42:31] that is you do not have any latch on the
[42:34] door
[42:36] and when I heard that word
[42:39] I've never heard that word used in that
[42:41] context
[42:42] I've heard maybe a doorknob pasadores or
[42:46] uh when you grab the door handle
[42:49] or any other names you have for a door
[42:51] handle uh
[42:54] all those words but I've never heard the
[42:56] word yes
[42:59] that's what's helped me in many
[43:01] occasions
[43:04] that I stopped and I find out what the
[43:06] word means is
[43:15] I painted it that way
[43:20] he said that door is a door to the heart
[43:22] is
[43:25] and the latch is on the inside
[43:29] you have to open the door I mean
[43:31] Hermanos amen brothers
[43:34] that's where you take control
[43:37] and you can open that door
[43:40] give all of our heart to God
[43:45] we have to do a hundred percent
[43:50] because that's not the way God works
[43:52] it's all or nothing man amen
[44:00] and there's many times in our lives
[44:02] [Music]
[44:03] that God wants the changes
[44:06] [Music]
[44:07] he wants to give us that peace that we
[44:10] desire
[44:12] he wants us to be better with him
[44:18] in the car in traffic
[44:21] that's right
[44:25] those are just excuses Brothers see
[44:54] and stand on the word of God
[45:00] we can't be at the right or on the left
[45:03] we can't we have we can't be in the
[45:06] middle
[45:07] we have to either be with God
[45:11] or we're going to stand on the other
[45:12] side with the devil
[45:15] God says he doesn't like lukewarm is
[45:21] hot or cold amen Amen
[45:26] on Saturday you can't be with your
[45:28] friends
[45:35] that's not how God works
[45:38] you have to make your decision
[46:27] amen amen
[47:28] so you
[47:50] our victories are becoming bigger
[47:53] in a moment I'll be closing
[48:00] one more quote from the message the
[48:03] deity of Lord Jesus Christ
[48:11] here he is praying
[48:15] he's finishing up a prayer
[48:21] he says if there are any lost in here to
[48:25] Santo any without the holy spirit
[48:31] for we ask in the name of thy dear
[48:34] beloved Son Jesus Jesus
[48:57] a few days after that uh
[49:03] 40 days later
[49:06] in Gloria he was received up in glory
[49:09] yes then 10 days later
[49:14] Santo came again in the power of the
[49:16] Holy Ghost
[49:18] and now living in the church
[49:21] so he's living here with us
[49:24] not in this building
[49:26] but in our hearts
[49:29] if he lives in us
[49:34] it is
[49:38] what he did when he was here on Earth
[49:41] we can do it as well
[49:47] we can do it as well but
[49:50] it depends on our faith
[49:54] saying
[50:24] the holy ghost in the church to take it
[50:26] out
[50:28] for we ask it in his name and Hermanos
[50:32] amen Brothers
[50:34] you could please stand
[50:37] with this I'll be closing
[50:40] [Music]
[50:42] the most important thing is
[50:46] that we have to get up
[50:50] there's a lot of the mistakes we've made
[50:53] but it matters that we're getting back
[50:55] up
[50:56] we'll continue getting back up
[50:59] then we continue in the path of God
[51:02] and we stayed down yes that's when we go
[51:06] out of sight yes
[51:09] that's when we're no longer on the side
[51:12] of God
[51:12] we put God to the side
[51:17] so it's so important to get back up
[51:20] [Music]
[51:22] because I can decide what's going to
[51:24] happen in our life
[51:26] it can bring healing
[51:29] it can bring any Miracles
[51:31] [Music]
[51:34] a miracle maybe doesn't come the next
[51:36] day
[51:38] maybe it doesn't come in a year foreign
[51:45] [Music]
[52:03] God is looking at your
[52:07] faith
[52:10] and he will take charge of everything
[52:12] else
[52:13] let us pray
[52:15] heavenly father
[52:17] thank you a lot
[52:21] you always give us more than what we
[52:23] need
[52:27] you always give us more
