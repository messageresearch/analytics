[Music] [Music] yeah that doesn't mean that we don't lose a battle but the end the end battle the final world we have a God who is a warrior and he's never fought in any of them sorry he's never lost a war a battle war s us to get a bit of hurt to see how what reaction we have almost as you're standing Uno the scripture is Ephesians we'll be reading from three to five brothers Ephesians 1 3-5 is the scripture reads blessed be the God and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us with the spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen before the foundation of the world and we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love until the adoption of children by Jesus Christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will by your heads or Jesus Christ Heavenly Father we give you thanks Lord be here once again at home for giving us health and life giving us everything that you have given us you have given us so much sometimes with our blurry vision that we have no pude we can't see the blessings that you do for all of us you do so much on the daily respiration even with a simple Act of being able to breathe is Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may take your seeds once again I greet you in the name Lord Jesus Christ I'm going to speak a little bit I don't know if you have the pictures ready like the majority of you know we went to the convention in Guadalajara I went supporting my pastor yes it's not easy sometimes but when God calls you it's not because you yourself want to go there's something within you that has to respond yes and that is the reason why we go it was in my own choosing I believe it was choosing on behalf of the Lord it also does not make me better than anyone else but each one has a different colors daily here whether we go out or we don't go out with our life we preach on The Daily what we believe you may not stand behind this is your very own life it is that shows who you truly are this is the only Bible that some people may only read which is the life of each one of you so here was an auto term that they rented out it's a very large Auditorium it was foreign it went up to 90 degrees so for one of us that's nothing a person who I knew came about a brother from church he says let's test out this car so you know what it does he lit up a marijuana cigarettes and I said well you know there's no problem you know you go you know what you're doing he says you're not going to scare me with that so everybody has to have their own burden because the theme the scripture here specifically to the individuals can each overcome that is the question is put the windows down because it smelled very bad like many of you know it tells me that he began to smoke he says tell me about the car I don't care about all that um you're holy because he is so we let him come into our lives from the inside reflection there was a Reflections as Christians are not perfect they're just forgiven to accept so how much do you accept that forgiveness of God in your life here is the church the service was done here as you know it is a small church because brother said they didn't give him the auditorium from Friday so this church brings back a lot of memories But as time goes on I'll let you know what happens in the first convention my mother passed away and the church is so each time I go to this church that moves the feelings Within Me browse at the same time I've realized from the beginning with each one of us when you think that God is Not By Your Side God is letting you be to see what you will do brother God loves to test his children or a daughter who go to a game like a baseball game or a soccer game or a basketball game something of those sorts opened up the service I like how he preaches because I'm up here I consider that he is my friend and I like how God is automatically my mind went to the message of brother Branham why are people so tossed about he said he asked a question and he gives an answer from here to there to another place sorry maybe I don't understand that word a toss about maybe you know what it means someone who's talked about someone who fluctuates is somebody who moves from here to there is a person who is that way is because they have not been here when you're born again not just here by coincidence it's not an accident that you were born foreign yeah you can know that there's something Beyond a representation it's the same thing when there's a representation of God in your heart it doesn't matter where you want to rise you will never escape from God has a plan for each one brother I don't care how young or how small or how big you are yes you may see brother well I'm already an old person I think I've already done everything God wants me to do but the reason you're still here on Earth because God wants to continue using it say brother I'm tired of this life I would like to go with the Lord already because you still have to fulfill the purpose you have it's so tremendous like brother Benham says he says God can prepare a person all of their lives let's say that they're almost 50 years old like myself young people might say well brother it's very old Century he's already an old man a person just tell me you're already an old man I tell them yeah when I get to work and what's the first thing I do I leave the walker in my car and then I walk normal God has a purpose that's all I want to tell you it's that simple Brothers God could prepare you all your life only to use you for five minutes don't think that you're not valuable to God each soul that is here it's worth more than ten thousand words if you're valuable in the eyes of God maybe in the eyes of the world or your girlfriends you're valuable in front of the eyes of God may God bless you thank you because Tabernacle and the brothers there brother Mark Castillo and the evening lights Tabernacles veterans I have another 25 years here has been with us uh services the unchangeable god in an unexpected way he fulfills his word we think we have everything figured but he continues the reason why I say this because we don't think we all have to go through the same past we are born but some birds are more complicated than others he is and the natural that's how it is but we're born again that's that's what the importance some struggled more than others others that take a little bit longer services that building foreign 807 they're actually waiting for him to take and we all know that he loves to pray for the people is he was trying to lift up the faith of the people so they could be helpful it would be impossible to see everything that got there among the people but I believe people were blessed foreign with this I want to tell you Brothers your prayers are greatly appreciated we had a good time with the family I was happy because my father was there in Guadalajara this is for the convention we were a small group there's Nintendo uh from the lighthouse people appreciated but your prayers not only for him for here foreign foreign God bless you this morning [Music] Del farro parque today we are and as long as we're part of the team what is what we did success and with that success it's only because the Lord Jesus Christ it's never the man it's always the spirit dwells I introduce brother Javier as our co-pester let me say it again um I'm not sure how many of you were uh in the message as I say Old-Timers they're young timers and we had a co-pastor first time I ever heard the word cold past 76. the Bible and the message brother Brennan brought us [Music] a lot of fits with the word but I wanted to address it yeah huh but then I I have the last say so if we go back we find the word uh with Lucifer Lucifer uh you're all aware well we should be aware that Lucifer was coal equal okay brother Branham said he was quote equals but then they inserted the word that he was and this is what started the battle Plato and it's always when there's a persona that wants to be something that is why people want power is so let me put it this way I think we all want pounds the Bible say and acts 1 8 I believe away until that power comes into us but what happens we uh seem to use the human nature with power [Music] the convention was a success way back in the 80s what did I learned the pastor prayed for me he prayed for my vocal cords I recall his words what he wanted it was for me to speak Spanish that was a prayer do I speak Spanish well let me put it this way the only one that knows the Spanish is please stand up she's the only one that knows me Espanol and the reason she knows is her husband her first husband in the Lord was a friend and I didn't speak Spanish did I if I spoke Spanish I didn't speak Spanish espanol NADA uh that was my Spanish I didn't speak nothing I understood but something happened that Spanish was not the Spanish that was spoken in my home my mother went to the third grade she understood English but only knew a couple cuss words and when somebody came over these words came out I'm giving you uh just a little taste of what I went through Juarez first time I met him and I understood 100 Espanol [Music] the person's name is say it at my house we talked and there was something about him some attraction attraction that just made me moved from Texas to Phoenix a phoenix and if I ever hated a city more than uh more than I did El Paso Phoenix it's too hot but that's a long time ago in Phoenix what I wanted you to do is stand up for a minute just share with you I know I had to stand up but I'm I have about an hour left and I need to take an hour now bless your brother or bless your sister and I think these are the best words that I know God bless you bless each other and I was in uh in Mexico something kept on bothering me how many of you sinned before don't be embarrassed if you don't put your hands the Bible is I've said it more than once that the Bible says all men are what words how many of us have sinned Nuevo but we've all fallen short Perot and I sinned and I fell shorts I'm happy I didn't say everything but if I ever met a person that was he followed me and missing you made it simple for me go to that person go to that person go to this person you gotta pray for them and the people we prayed foreign bajo every day so my sin was I preached I was all wet well went and had some soup with somebody I won't never mention names I had to come back to earth and uh I forgot I put on a shirt I still don't know the name of the soup I say Italian and the people look at me is this I just love to eat it it came so hard across the street I was drenched off my shirt I passed out this way my throat I was going to call Bill uh I don't have a voice my sin was I know that I'm supposed to take off I know I'm supposed to be warm out of the air conditioner so it was not only was the room cold but my throat was just close it was only God that saved me foreign so I've been troubled a lot um and there was a conflict between Ernie Montoya Spirit on Saturday night and look this way I'd see your spirit I saw over here it was like people were pulling away I don't want to serve God anymore I started telling myself have we lost our confidence have we still stooped so low that every time I see my wife this is what I was fighting the thoughts that were coming do they attack you yeah they attack all of us so then my thought was conflict between the sons of God I want you to say there is a conflict between between the sons of God the sons of God and Satan insane how many sons of God are here we're sons of God in other words and that struggle yes it's not against your brothers but it's against us spirit that hangs around lingers have you ever gone somewhere and all of a sudden you start acting differently because someone there before you and left an anointing but he said this sister hermana you stayed at a hotel the southern Brothers stayed at the same hotel room not at the same time but they both stayed at the same Hotel the same room a spirit was left there is I'm not going to tell you what the anointing was but there was anointing Brennan told the sisters father that was anointed with that Spirit lingers until it finds a horse say it again brother Brennan gave an advice yes see he looks at another person not gonna go into it many of you know the story but many times what happens we don't know what's behind the anointing one wanted this said okay the other one is the same things do the spirits go with Jesus Jesus or do the spirit stay here and when they stay here in order to have life a spirit needs a horse then it comes to you because of your your Fallen Spirit foreign okay that person left yeah if he would have taken a talk would govern him what we need to do we need to put it ISO because it will take you by surprise and I don't say it because somebody is doing this I was in Mexico some people had an anointing where they wanted power others wanted an anointing that they were something why do you want to be something okay God made us a nobody so that we could be somebody in his economy I don't care about the economy of the United States however I used it when I was in Guadalajara of what's Happening Here in America Trump a chosen vessel he claims the person that's going to make us great again well he has a surprise because like I said there's a conflict between and sons of God there's a conflict between the word of God I'm conflict between God it's a conflict good and evil there's a conflict are you conflicted because it grabs us and we're doing things we shouldn't be doing yes when the sons of God shouted for Joyce someone tell me where we were at shouting praise God we weren't troubled back then we didn't lose our confidence but today many of us are so worried what's going to happen tomorrow I can't do this I can't pay for that what about my kids brother Brennan said this is a rose what five six minutes because of this thing called trap there's a trap in every corner brother Brenham said it was preached in 1956. and if you notice I don't have a slight presentation and if you notice it's when you're discouraged the devil can really pour it on you when you lose your confidence that we're not worthy when we want to just throw in the towel he continues and he says does that happen to anybody here he says this he says if you come to church well I don't know I don't know whether I'll ever get any better or not brother raise your hand thank you gracias how's your wife any words spoken there no do we know what that means everything is all well all is well so brother Branham says better or not I've been prayed for twice how many of you have been prayed for and you're still not healed you might as well go home that's all but when you prayed excuse me but when you can cast aside I don't want you to be frowning how many of you from there he goes again I wish you'd just shed his mouth how many frowns are there I mean look at the time I gotta drive all the way down to um I mean I saw a lot of them Saturday night did the France leave finished they were gone listen to the human heart was made to be Feliz what makes you happy Feliz well there's some people like uh western music Tex-Mex Tex-Mex uh they hear a lot of tech semesters like instrumental music instrumental it relaxes me relax when I get back on course there's a list of books brother Branham read many of them Westerns and the reason I say it is because that all brother Brenham did was read his Bible it was a different side over here Billy brother Billy Paul anybody Paul uh put a list on all the books they're on online I believe will cause cancer cancer is it again and we don't understand that causes a sickness we need to be careful good cause cancer cancer how many of you have a temperature I want my cereal the way I want them that I can't put this on it um and I'm not I'm I point out my wife I don't want to point at anyone no no yeah I can't have those things I don't want to be diabetic you want to be diabetic yes put a lot of salt in your food do whatever you do to get sick but I don't want it I can't have it in my system I'm not diabetic I don't care if I get sick I want my cereal with a lot of sugar I don't want Brown Sugar Cafe what am I causing how's my temperature gauge inside my heart is it elevating is raise your hand how many of your husbands for silly reasons no let's turn it over there dirty socks in the corner your clothes in the corner you were told to do this everybody blows up nobody nothing nobody Nadine I mean absolutely sooner or later don't tell me they don't blow up more so when you go out and he has to pay yeah there's a feud you better go to work I teach my wife she works because she doesn't want to be around me no I'm a hard person to get along with I'm a different breed I would have brought up differently in other words I said I was a grouch I'm foreign thank you I'm very grouchy I think all Pisces but they're grouchy for whatever it is you've been born again if we've been born again again all signs are not perfect but once that flood came it did this two-thirds knocked everything out of scope that's why we're not focused that's why we get mad that's why we're dying everything had to do with the day she ate of that fruit so that and not like a joke people say it was an apple a green apple red apple I don't know what you have in your pocket and that Apple's a cell phone yes with the same original cyst not like didn't say God no they had the oil but I'm looking at what brother branham's saying the human heart was meant to be happy Feliz worrying causes cancer don't never be upset molesto drink some water get away then come back and you'll feel better
