[1:04:08] Bibles God bless each one in the name of
[1:04:12] the Lord Jesus
[1:04:14] Christ Jeremiah chapter
[1:04:20] 3 as we continue with uh
[1:04:25] what we were looking at Wednesday I
[1:04:27] wasn't able
[1:04:28] to to conclude or finish
[1:04:37] that
[1:04:41] um amen and there was things in there
[1:04:45] that
[1:04:50] uh had to
[1:04:53] be a little bit more
[1:04:57] clear and be able to
[1:05:01] see we saw a little
[1:05:04] bit but be able to see more
[1:05:09] clearly how that applies today more
[1:05:16] perfectly
[1:05:18] because these uh these areas here in the
[1:05:23] scripture
[1:05:25] is only a shadow to show
[1:05:28] us the reality of
[1:05:31] today of what was causing the
[1:05:36] shadow amen Jeremiah chapter
[1:05:41] 3 Allelujah verse
[1:05:45] one amen you all have it
[1:05:49] Hallelujah we we titled it
[1:05:53] Wednesday the glory was
[1:05:57] shaven and the glory has risen upon
[1:06:07] you so Jeremiah 3:1 says they say if a
[1:06:10] man put away his
[1:06:12] wife and she go from him and become
[1:06:16] another
[1:06:18] man's shall he return unto her
[1:06:21] again shall not the land be great
[1:06:25] polluted but thou has played the Harlot
[1:06:29] with many lovers yet return again to me
[1:06:33] sayth the
[1:06:50] Lord lift up thine eyes unto the the
[1:06:54] high
[1:06:55] places and see where thou Hast not been
[1:06:58] laying
[1:07:01] with in the ways has thou set for them
[1:07:06] as the Arabian in the
[1:07:08] wilderness and thou Hast polluted the
[1:07:10] land with thy whoredoms and with thy
[1:07:22] wickedness
[1:07:29] therefore the showers have been
[1:07:33] withholding and there have been no
[1:07:35] latter
[1:07:36] rain and thou had us a horse
[1:07:39] forehead thou refuses to be
[1:07:51] ashamed amen Jeremiah chap
[1:08:00] s and we're going to
[1:08:14] read verse
[1:08:18] 28 but Thou shalt say unto them this is
[1:08:21] a nation that obeyeth not the voice of
[1:08:23] the Lord their God nor receiveth
[1:08:26] correction truth is perished and is cut
[1:08:29] off from their
[1:08:41] mouth cut off thine hair oh Jerusalem
[1:08:44] and cast it away and take up a
[1:08:47] lamentation on high places for the Lord
[1:08:49] have rejected and forsaken the
[1:08:52] generation of his Wrath
[1:09:00] [Music]
[1:09:05] may be seated God bless
[1:09:14] you we go back
[1:09:17] to Jeremiah 3 just to pick
[1:09:21] up uh something there
[1:09:29] amen
[1:09:31] amen we have
[1:09:34] been now for some
[1:09:39] time I believe a month or
[1:09:44] so or a little bit
[1:09:47] more on U the study of
[1:09:52] Ezekiel and we have seen many great
[1:09:56] things and one thing that throughout
[1:10:00] the the series that we have looked
[1:10:05] at is how that
[1:10:08] Jeremiah is the major
[1:10:11] prophet that is prophesying at the same
[1:10:17] time and Jeremiah is also one that is
[1:10:21] taken into Babylon under the Captivity
[1:10:31] Jeremiah uh was given the prophecy
[1:10:37] first and he is the one that's giving
[1:10:40] the
[1:10:42] message and
[1:10:44] Ezekiel is the only one that is picking
[1:10:47] up with jermiah has already
[1:10:51] said and he is
[1:10:54] he is repeating
[1:10:57] it uh not only as we we said not only
[1:11:02] just
[1:11:05] repeating but also with the same
[1:11:09] vision with the same
[1:11:12] Revelation and with the same
[1:11:16] urgency and uh that is a perfect type of
[1:11:19] our
[1:11:21] day and there is a a
[1:11:25] tremendous tremendous uh Insight in this
[1:11:29] in this uh time
[1:11:34] yeah there's a there's a tremendous
[1:11:38] scene that you see during this
[1:11:42] time and it allows you to be able
[1:11:45] to to look at
[1:11:48] this type of this
[1:11:52] shadow and see more
[1:11:55] clearly certain things that the opening
[1:11:59] of the
[1:12:01] book allows you to
[1:12:03] see Hallelujah when the book is
[1:12:07] open the book is the
[1:12:10] Bible brother Bram said it wasn't no
[1:12:12] other
[1:12:14] book that was seal with Seven
[1:12:17] Seals the book that was sealed with
[1:12:19] Seven
[1:12:21] Seals was the Bible
[1:12:24] it wasn't another uh different book that
[1:12:27] God had in
[1:12:30] heaven there's only one
[1:12:33] book amen amen and that book where our
[1:12:37] names are
[1:12:39] written is the
[1:12:41] Bible that's why a lot of people say
[1:12:43] where is William Brandon's name in the
[1:12:46] Bible William Bram
[1:12:48] in it's
[1:12:50] there do you see William branham's name
[1:12:52] in the Bible
[1:12:54] will amen you see it by
[1:12:58] Revelation but it doesn't say William
[1:13:00] Bram
[1:13:01] will your name if you're a part of the
[1:13:06] Bride your name is in the
[1:13:11] Bible but you have to see it by
[1:13:16] Revelation and that's what the opening
[1:13:18] of the book
[1:13:20] does it allows you to see
[1:13:24] brother bam said the the book is not
[1:13:27] calling
[1:13:29] names like Orman Neville and
[1:13:32] Le he said what is it he said it's the
[1:13:37] mystery being
[1:13:39] revealed that calls your
[1:13:43] name each one of these
[1:13:48] characters is
[1:13:50] representing somebody amen but the first
[1:13:55] [Music]
[1:13:56] revelation that you
[1:13:59] must understand that's why Jesus said
[1:14:02] Upon This Rock I'll build my
[1:14:06] church because that's the first
[1:14:09] stone that must be
[1:14:12] laid and it has already been
[1:14:14] laid but in your life in your Christian
[1:14:19] walk if you want to be able to advance
[1:14:22] with God
[1:14:25] you have to have that
[1:14:27] Revelation and that is that the mystery
[1:14:31] of
[1:14:33] God being
[1:14:35] revealed it reveals Jesus
[1:14:38] Christ it doesn't
[1:14:41] reveal somebody else
[1:14:44] first if it doesn't reveal Jesus
[1:14:47] Christ you're not seeing it
[1:14:50] correctly because brother Randon
[1:14:52] preached
[1:14:54] Christ is the
[1:14:56] mystery of God
[1:14:59] revealed and then he preached
[1:15:01] Christ revealed in his own word amen
[1:15:06] amen and brother Bram said we must be
[1:15:09] able to see Christ
[1:15:13] first before you can see anything
[1:15:16] else and that's what is the
[1:15:20] foundation of the faith of the fathers
[1:15:24] and this message was to take us
[1:15:27] back to that faith and establish us upon
[1:15:32] the same
[1:15:33] Foundation that they had that's why the
[1:15:37] ministry of the son of man had to come
[1:15:41] back and
[1:15:43] reveal the same Ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:15:47] again amen amen and what do we see in
[1:15:50] that
[1:15:52] Ministry we don't see a man we see
[1:15:56] Christ
[1:15:57] revealed in a
[1:15:59] man the man is not
[1:16:03] Christ the man is not God the man is
[1:16:07] only revealing to the
[1:16:11] public the through the
[1:16:16] fullness of the
[1:16:18] manifestation of the son of
[1:16:21] man he is showing
[1:16:24] us
[1:16:27] Christ but brother Bram
[1:16:30] said we cannot
[1:16:33] Approach To
[1:16:36] God In The Name of William
[1:16:38] Bren those are the words of the
[1:16:41] Prophet we cannot try to come to
[1:16:47] God and
[1:16:48] say I'm coming on this
[1:16:52] behalf
[1:16:56] there's only one
[1:16:57] way to approach God and that way has
[1:17:01] been
[1:17:04] open the
[1:17:06] light shines the
[1:17:08] path amen amen and it shows you how to
[1:17:14] approach
[1:17:17] God and what people Miss many times
[1:17:25] is that the
[1:17:27] prophet wasn't to take us to some other
[1:17:33] thing
[1:17:35] outside of the
[1:17:38] word but because brother
[1:17:41] Branham was taught by the angel of the
[1:17:45] Lord it was the pillar of
[1:17:48] fire that revealed to
[1:17:50] him the Bible amen amen in the message
[1:17:55] the unveiling of
[1:17:57] God he says it was the pillar of
[1:18:01] fire over
[1:18:04] Moses while he
[1:18:06] wrote on Mount Si
[1:18:10] Genesis who knew all those
[1:18:13] things who knew that there was a a
[1:18:16] serpent in the beginning in
[1:18:20] Genesis a
[1:18:21] beast that spoke to
[1:18:24] Eve and deceived her and she ate of the
[1:18:29] fruit the pillar of fire over
[1:18:33] Moses had him
[1:18:35] WR in the
[1:18:39] beginning amen
[1:18:42] amen the heavens and the
[1:18:45] Earth
[1:18:47] right and God said let there be light
[1:18:52] and the the spirit of God moved upon the
[1:18:57] waters was Moses there to see
[1:19:01] that the pillar of fire over
[1:19:04] Moses is what revealed to
[1:19:07] him what that was then brother Bram said
[1:19:12] the pillar of fire over
[1:19:16] Paul revealed to him the Old
[1:19:20] Testament amen amen and that's why the
[1:19:23] New
[1:19:24] Testament was given by
[1:19:27] Paul not by Matthew Mark Luke and
[1:19:30] John they were only
[1:19:33] scribes
[1:19:34] observing the son of man
[1:19:37] Ministry and saying wow look at that
[1:19:40] Ministry and taking
[1:19:43] down what was taking
[1:19:47] place that that had a
[1:19:50] part because we can go back into Matthew
[1:19:53] Mark luk and
[1:19:55] John and see the life of the son of
[1:19:58] man then compare
[1:20:01] that to this day but brother bam tells
[1:20:05] us the one who brought the New
[1:20:08] Testament was Paul and the pillar of
[1:20:12] fire was the one that met him on the
[1:20:14] road to
[1:20:17] Damascus and then after that he went to
[1:20:21] the Arabian Desert
[1:20:24] that's in the book of Galatians chapter
[1:20:26] 1 right amen Paul tells us his
[1:20:29] testimony of his conversion and then how
[1:20:33] he went to
[1:20:34] Arabia and he he was there and Paul says
[1:20:38] I did not
[1:20:39] consult Flesh and Blood I didn't go to
[1:20:43] Jerusalem with the brothers with Peter
[1:20:47] and James and the rest of the brothers I
[1:20:51] didn't go see them
[1:20:53] he went by himself to the desert and the
[1:20:57] pillar of
[1:20:58] fire revealed to him the ministry of
[1:21:02] Jesus revealed to him he was the lamb he
[1:21:07] was the tabernacle he was the veil he
[1:21:10] was the ark he was all of the Old
[1:21:15] Testament Paul is the one that brought
[1:21:18] the
[1:21:19] Revelation to show us the old test was
[1:21:23] the
[1:21:24] shadow Christ is the
[1:21:28] substance right who taught him that the
[1:21:32] pillar of fire and in that same message
[1:21:34] that I'm
[1:21:35] quoting brother bam after he shows
[1:21:38] us that Moses by the pillar of fire
[1:21:42] wrote the Old
[1:21:43] Testament the pillar of fire over
[1:21:46] Paul gave him the New Testament he said
[1:21:49] and today that same Pillar of Fire
[1:21:53] has come to reveal to us Old and New
[1:21:59] Testament by the
[1:22:02] revelation of this
[1:22:04] message
[1:22:06] Hallelujah why why do I why do I start
[1:22:09] by saying
[1:22:11] that
[1:22:13] because the pillar of fire teaching
[1:22:16] William brandom the the Bible revealing
[1:22:19] to him the
[1:22:21] Bible from Genesis to
[1:22:24] Revelation that's the
[1:22:27] message amen you
[1:22:29] understand so what's the
[1:22:32] message amen it's the pillar of
[1:22:36] fire giving the message revealing the
[1:22:41] Bible to William brandham William BR and
[1:22:44] William brandham cannot speak Willi
[1:22:47] according to
[1:22:49] himself and according to the Bible
[1:22:52] cannot speak something outside of the
[1:22:57] Bible he said I used to
[1:22:59] think spiritual food in due
[1:23:02] season I used to think and I and me
[1:23:07] Diego a royal used to think
[1:23:10] too and a lot of you used to think
[1:23:14] too amen that there were that that the
[1:23:18] message was something more than the
[1:23:22] Bible
[1:23:24] and that there was things that weren't
[1:23:26] in the
[1:23:27] Bible that are in the
[1:23:32] message you might still think like that
[1:23:35] I don't
[1:23:37] know but that's okay because William
[1:23:41] brandham thought like that
[1:23:44] too amen amen we thought like that
[1:23:47] too at one time because people in the
[1:23:51] message influence
[1:23:55] that amen and they take away the
[1:23:58] essence of what the message really
[1:24:02] is and that's why people I don't blame a
[1:24:06] lot of
[1:24:08] people they think that we're a
[1:24:11] cult they think that we we we we we're
[1:24:14] we're like the
[1:24:18] Mormons right M the Mormons carry two
[1:24:21] books
[1:24:26] and really they only carry
[1:24:29] one they don't really care about the Old
[1:24:32] Testament they just want the New
[1:24:35] Testament and the Book of
[1:24:39] Mormon brother bam said that
[1:24:43] angel that comes to me he said it in the
[1:24:48] seals amen if that angel tells me one
[1:24:51] thing
[1:24:53] outside of the Bible I'll never listen
[1:24:56] to him
[1:25:00] again he said I don't
[1:25:02] doubt that that angel came to Joseph
[1:25:05] Smith in Upstate New
[1:25:10] York amen I don't doubt that brother
[1:25:12] Bram said but he wasn't
[1:25:16] scriptural that angel that spoke to
[1:25:20] Joseph Smith Joseph Smith not just one
[1:25:23] time time after time and begin to to
[1:25:27] teach
[1:25:28] him all that's in the Book of
[1:25:30] Mormon how many's heard or read or know
[1:25:34] a little bit about the Book of
[1:25:37] Mormon brother there's things in
[1:25:40] there they're
[1:25:43] strange amen very
[1:25:48] strange so the thing
[1:25:51] is
[1:25:53] Galatians
[1:25:55] 18 Paul who brought the New
[1:25:59] Testament and knew brother Ram
[1:26:02] said Paul knew that what he was
[1:26:06] preaching wasn't wasn't his
[1:26:08] own it was the
[1:26:11] revelation of Jesus Christ he says it in
[1:26:14] Galatians 1 he said the the the gospel
[1:26:17] that I preach is not of man because it
[1:26:21] wasn't given to me by
[1:26:23] man he says and what I preach I Don't
[1:26:27] Preach to please
[1:26:29] men amen a lot of people preach because
[1:26:33] they like to please
[1:26:35] men amen amen but we're not to please
[1:26:40] men we're to please
[1:26:44] God and if and if the elected
[1:26:47] seed loves God Amen and if God is
[1:26:53] pleased you will be
[1:26:56] pleased amen because you and him are
[1:27:01] one and without faith it's impossible to
[1:27:05] please
[1:27:06] him but Paul
[1:27:08] said I preached the revelation of Jesus
[1:27:12] Christ and brother Adam said he was so
[1:27:16] certain what he was preaching was not
[1:27:19] anything had to do with man
[1:27:23] that he said even if an angel from
[1:27:24] heaven comes
[1:27:26] down and preaches another
[1:27:29] gospel then what I have already
[1:27:33] established let him be a curse and Paul
[1:27:37] says even if
[1:27:39] I after so many
[1:27:43] years even if I he
[1:27:45] said turn around and preach something
[1:27:49] contrary to what I have already preached
[1:27:53] I'm cursed amen amen hallelujah that
[1:27:58] shows you that it wasn't
[1:28:02] his because if that would have been of
[1:28:05] human
[1:28:06] origin he would have said whoa I'm
[1:28:08] always
[1:28:12] right if I change I'm still
[1:28:16] right but no he knew that's the word of
[1:28:19] the
[1:28:20] Lord reveal red
[1:28:24] preached amen amen by the foolishness of
[1:28:30] preaching amen and that same Pillar of
[1:28:35] Fire right
[1:28:37] there that Pillar of Fire is what met
[1:28:39] Saul on the road to
[1:28:42] Damascus that Pillar of Fire was in the
[1:28:46] burning
[1:28:47] bush that spoke to Moses and said I am
[1:28:50] that I am
[1:28:54] am that same Pillar of Fire come back in
[1:28:58] this day to
[1:29:00] reveal the Old Testament and the New
[1:29:04] Testament not something outside of the
[1:29:09] Bible not Le come to brother
[1:29:14] Bram brother Bram tells us in the
[1:29:17] unveiling of
[1:29:18] God
[1:29:20] 1964 said brother Bram you can
[1:29:25] write another
[1:29:27] Bible with all the Revelation you've
[1:29:30] received he said
[1:29:33] brother I would be an
[1:29:36] antichrist
[1:29:39] am and brother bam said I always
[1:29:46] thought because the message is
[1:29:49] what the seventh angel
[1:29:52] sounding the trumpet is that the message
[1:29:56] amen amen okay but why do why does
[1:30:01] revelation 10:7 say
[1:30:04] that in the days of the voice of the
[1:30:06] seventh
[1:30:07] angel you know how that verse
[1:30:11] begins right you know how it begins
[1:30:13] right Revelation
[1:30:15] 107 how does that verse
[1:30:18] begin
[1:30:20] but in the days why why is it but in the
[1:30:28] days because before from verse one to
[1:30:33] verse three you see a mighty angel with
[1:30:36] the rainbow over his head clothed in a
[1:30:40] cloud coming down from heaven with the
[1:30:43] book open in his
[1:30:44] hand that's that Pillar of Fire but in
[1:30:48] Angelic
[1:30:50] form Hallelujah the angel of
[1:30:55] God the angel of the
[1:30:58] Covenant coming with the Revelation
[1:31:00] that's
[1:31:01] Christ not
[1:31:04] corporally but
[1:31:07] angelically do you have an
[1:31:09] angel amen does Christ have an
[1:31:15] angel yes see his Angel has
[1:31:19] come amen amen amen and it says and he
[1:31:24] put one foot on the land one on the
[1:31:26] sea and he roared with a loud
[1:31:29] voice as when a lion roared and seven
[1:31:34] Thunders uttered their voices and John
[1:31:37] said I was about to
[1:31:40] write what the seven Thunders
[1:31:43] UT and that angel said don't write
[1:31:47] it seal
[1:31:49] it Hallelujah
[1:31:52] but in the
[1:31:55] days amen but in the
[1:31:59] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:32:04] when he shall begin to sound the
[1:32:07] trumpet am the
[1:32:10] mystery of
[1:32:12] God will be finished am am brother bam
[1:32:17] said and and you you read messages from
[1:32:20] 1960
[1:32:24] 61 even
[1:32:28] 62 amen
[1:32:32] amen and brother
[1:32:34] bham because he he confesses it
[1:32:38] later that's why we
[1:32:40] know amen he confesses it
[1:32:44] later he says I used to
[1:32:47] think that those seven
[1:32:49] Thunders was something
[1:32:52] outside of the
[1:32:54] Bible and that was never
[1:32:57] written he says but it cannot be
[1:33:02] so amen amen he says but we found
[1:33:07] out by the grace of
[1:33:09] God that it was something
[1:33:14] hidden in the
[1:33:19] Bible it's there but it's
[1:33:25] hidden so that's what the message
[1:33:31] is we're not following some unscriptural
[1:33:37] thing amen this is this is what God
[1:33:40] promised for the end
[1:33:43] time amen
[1:33:45] amen that's just like when when Moses
[1:33:48] was back there with the children of
[1:33:50] Israel
[1:33:53] amen amen that was the word of the
[1:33:55] Lord hallelujah you believe it or you
[1:33:58] die that's
[1:34:01] it that's like when the days of
[1:34:04] Noah you either believed his
[1:34:06] message obeyed his message walked into
[1:34:09] the ark oh you're
[1:34:14] done amen oh that's it and that's what
[1:34:18] this
[1:34:19] is the message
[1:34:22] of the hour what we call the brother bam
[1:34:25] called it the message of the
[1:34:30] hour that's what it
[1:34:33] is is directly from
[1:34:37] God just like
[1:34:39] Paul brother bam said anointed ones at
[1:34:42] the end
[1:34:43] time I have nothing to do with
[1:34:49] this that's what he said he said it
[1:34:52] wasn't
[1:34:53] me that appeared at the River
[1:34:57] Ohio I was just a
[1:34:59] voice standing there when it happened it
[1:35:03] was he said it hasn't been
[1:35:05] me that has revealed these things the
[1:35:09] seventh angel is not the son of man the
[1:35:13] seventh angel is
[1:35:17] revealing to the public the son of man
[1:35:22] amen see and brother bam said with his
[1:35:26] words that's where people have a hard
[1:35:30] time
[1:35:36] separating
[1:35:38] amen you talk about the son of
[1:35:42] man and they and they're looking at the
[1:35:44] seventh
[1:35:47] angel see what I'm
[1:35:50] saying but but if you look at it
[1:35:53] correctly that's all
[1:35:56] right
[1:35:58] because a lot of people can't see
[1:36:02] that but it's a dangerous
[1:36:06] thing and then that's why
[1:36:09] others say no I don't want to get into
[1:36:12] none of
[1:36:13] that it takes too
[1:36:15] much no it takes
[1:36:19] God it doesn't take take a lot of study
[1:36:23] it takes God to reveal it to
[1:36:27] you Hallelujah you got to see it by
[1:36:34] Revelation amen
[1:36:36] amen but people don't want to do
[1:36:39] that because to do
[1:36:44] that you need to die out to a lot of
[1:36:48] thoughts you got to lay yourself before
[1:36:51] the
[1:36:53] son and let the Rays of
[1:36:57] light going to strike into the
[1:37:01] seed begin to
[1:37:04] ripen amen begin to see
[1:37:08] clear and it's all the the beautiful
[1:37:11] thing of
[1:37:13] it is that you
[1:37:15] know this ain't you making this
[1:37:18] up it's all right there in the word
[1:37:22] it's all right there in the message it's
[1:37:24] all right there in the Bible and and and
[1:37:27] you can see it in one one part
[1:37:30] here and God showing you that but but
[1:37:34] with that one with that Revelation there
[1:37:37] God can brother bam said this is the
[1:37:40] words of the Prophet when he dedicated
[1:37:42] the exposition of the church
[1:37:45] ages he dedicated the
[1:37:48] book amen thank you H Allelujah amen
[1:37:52] amen and in the
[1:37:55] introduction he wrote something that
[1:37:58] wasn't something he
[1:37:59] preached he dedicated it for that
[1:38:03] book and he
[1:38:06] wrote in the
[1:38:08] introduction this
[1:38:10] study of the seven Church
[1:38:12] ages is
[1:38:15] necessary for further
[1:38:20] revelation want to start over
[1:38:23] here he said you got to start
[1:38:26] here you see because from the church
[1:38:29] ages after the church Jesus come the
[1:38:33] seals after the seals come the
[1:38:36] trumpets after the
[1:38:38] trumpets come the
[1:38:40] vials that's what he wrote that's what
[1:38:43] he wrote and you look at look at it in
[1:38:46] the Book of
[1:38:47] Revelation what's at the first part of
[1:38:49] the Book of Revelation apocalypsis
[1:38:51] Church
[1:38:53] ages amen it was in chapter 4 and
[1:38:56] chapter
[1:38:57] 5 after church
[1:39:01] ages in chapter five the lamb takes the
[1:39:05] book opens the seals chapter six the
[1:39:10] seals you understand and then what
[1:39:14] chapter eight the
[1:39:17] trumpets right amen amen amen
[1:39:21] and then after the trumpets the
[1:39:26] vials brother Ram knew what he's talking
[1:39:29] about but he just says
[1:39:32] it because he's seeing
[1:39:35] it and if you hear what he
[1:39:39] says or read what he
[1:39:42] wrote and you say Church ages seals
[1:39:48] trumpets BS amen
[1:39:52] amen but you're not seeing what he's
[1:39:56] seeing you understand what I'm
[1:39:58] saying you're not
[1:40:00] seeing why he said it brother Adam said
[1:40:04] that's why
[1:40:06] today there's a lot of
[1:40:09] trouble why because there's too many
[1:40:12] directors that are not in the spirit of
[1:40:15] the
[1:40:16] composer amen you got to enter into the
[1:40:20] spirit
[1:40:22] of the
[1:40:24] composer Hallelujah he says if not
[1:40:28] you're looking at the at the sheet
[1:40:30] notes yes and you're saying g
[1:40:35] c amen amen
[1:40:39] if
[1:40:42] right but there's a certain
[1:40:45] way brother Bram said it Shalom message
[1:40:49] shom you got to know when to
[1:40:54] change how many strokes in
[1:40:59] G
[1:41:04] Strokes if you're playing the
[1:41:07] guitar amen amen you're not just going
[1:41:10] to be changing g c d e f f e
[1:41:16] e there's a
[1:41:18] purpose there's there's a time when
[1:41:21] change and brother bham said everybody
[1:41:25] must be in this in in the in the
[1:41:29] spirit is that what he taught
[1:41:31] us hallelujah so people just grab the
[1:41:34] sheet note spiritually
[1:41:37] speaking and they say
[1:41:40] GCF GCF
[1:41:42] right but they don't know when it change
[1:41:46] you got to enter into the spirit of the
[1:41:49] composer brother said it's like like
[1:41:52] like Peter and the
[1:41:55] Wolf right amen remember he told us he
[1:41:58] said the
[1:42:00] drums had to play a certain way
[1:42:03] everything had a a certain a certain
[1:42:06] thing to
[1:42:08] do but you got to enter into the spirit
[1:42:11] of the
[1:42:12] composer you got to learn the
[1:42:15] Rhythm you got to learn the
[1:42:18] changes when it goes High
[1:42:21] when it gets low when it stops when it
[1:42:24] goes when it starts
[1:42:27] again amen right who taught us
[1:42:32] that amen
[1:42:35] amen so is not just to look at
[1:42:38] it and repeat it or or read it it's to
[1:42:43] enter into that same
[1:42:45] channel and then when you go to the Book
[1:42:47] of
[1:42:48] Revelation oh wow
[1:42:51] that's why he said
[1:42:54] that and then he says and the whole
[1:42:58] revelation will open
[1:43:01] wide that's what he said will open
[1:43:05] wide before our wondering
[1:43:10] eyes amen amen amen it's a
[1:43:16] picture that's the reason
[1:43:18] why see I'm I'm doing this because I'm
[1:43:22] showing you the
[1:43:24] purpose how many understand I'm showing
[1:43:27] you the
[1:43:29] purpose in
[1:43:31] why when we study books like this in the
[1:43:37] Bible there's a
[1:43:39] purpose it's not that we're in some
[1:43:41] history
[1:43:45] lesson this is helping us to see more
[1:43:49] clear the picture
[1:43:53] and brother Ram told
[1:43:55] us
[1:43:56] Jeremiah is a type of
[1:44:00] Christ is Jeremiah type of
[1:44:04] Christ
[1:44:05] Jeremiah
[1:44:09] purchased an
[1:44:11] inheritance of his uncle ham
[1:44:16] ham right amen he bought
[1:44:21] he purchased the
[1:44:23] land and told
[1:44:26] Baro amen amen to keep the title deed of
[1:44:30] that
[1:44:32] property in an earn
[1:44:34] vessel for 70 years brother bam preached
[1:44:38] those
[1:44:39] things where did he get it from right
[1:44:42] here from the book of
[1:44:45] Jeremiah see but people just hear the
[1:44:48] prophet they don't go back to see where
[1:44:51] he got it
[1:44:53] from to see what he's
[1:44:56] reading you see what I'm
[1:44:59] saying that's that's the
[1:45:01] mistake a lot of us
[1:45:05] make amen amen but when we go back like
[1:45:10] this and we see oh look at this you
[1:45:14] begin to see the picture and then you
[1:45:17] see the message and and you look at the
[1:45:19] quotes
[1:45:21] and you see
[1:45:22] exactly what brother Bram was
[1:45:26] seeing you see what I'm
[1:45:28] saying then you understand
[1:45:31] why he said what he said his
[1:45:35] basis his his
[1:45:38] foundation from where he was getting
[1:45:41] that was from
[1:45:43] here he he says I I didn't go to school
[1:45:48] I didn't go to theology
[1:45:51] I didn't go study for years and years to
[1:45:53] the
[1:45:55] Seminary who taught him the Bible the
[1:45:59] pillar of
[1:46:00] fire hallelujah it's not about
[1:46:04] theology it's about
[1:46:07] understanding what we're looking at what
[1:46:10] we're hearing what we're
[1:46:15] reading and that is the spirit of
[1:46:18] wisdom that the Bible speaks of in the
[1:46:20] book of
[1:46:23] Ephesians the spirit of
[1:46:25] wisdom and
[1:46:28] revelation will
[1:46:30] illuminate the eyes of your
[1:46:35] understanding is that the Bible is that
[1:46:37] the
[1:46:38] scripture and preach on that he said
[1:46:41] that Spirit of wisdom and
[1:46:43] Revelation was going to come in the last
[1:46:46] days to open our
[1:46:49] eyes to the
[1:46:51] Revelation hallelujah
[1:46:54] hallelujah oh brother this is this is
[1:46:58] real this is this is
[1:47:04] sound Hallelujah that's why the Bible
[1:47:07] said in the last days there would be
[1:47:11] many with itching
[1:47:15] ears brother bam said that's how Eve got
[1:47:18] her eyes
[1:47:19] blinded
[1:47:22] they want to hear something El something
[1:47:26] new ain't nothing new outside of
[1:47:30] this amen outside of this ain't another
[1:47:35] light but the light has come to open
[1:47:40] this it shall be light in the evening
[1:47:44] time and there's a fountain that's
[1:47:48] flowing flowing
[1:47:51] flowing it does not stop and the spirit
[1:47:56] and the prophet and the bride it's
[1:47:59] saying come there's a
[1:48:01] fountain where is that Fountain it's in
[1:48:04] the
[1:48:06] word the fountain is open and it's
[1:48:10] flowing healing
[1:48:14] Revelation Holy
[1:48:16] Ghost joy peace hallelujah amen whatever
[1:48:21] you need is in this
[1:48:24] Fountain you say oh brother I don't know
[1:48:28] what to do come to the Fountain and
[1:48:31] drink from the
[1:48:34] water I'm sick come to the Fountain
[1:48:39] Jeremiah said to to the people of his
[1:48:42] day remember last Sunday night you have
[1:48:47] forsaken the Fountain of Living Life
[1:48:51] life and you have made for
[1:48:54] yourselves sisters broken
[1:48:58] sisters did Brother Bram preach broken
[1:49:03] sister Jeremiah was a
[1:49:06] shadow of William Bram William Jeremiah
[1:49:10] is a type also of Jesus
[1:49:15] [Music]
[1:49:18] Christ Jeremiah had the
[1:49:21] Ministry of the son of
[1:49:24] man
[1:49:26] amen he bought the
[1:49:30] land who paid the price for
[1:49:35] us Christ
[1:49:38] Jeremiah paid the
[1:49:41] price and then he told
[1:49:46] Baro the title of that property amen
[1:49:51] keep it in an earn
[1:49:53] vessel for 70
[1:49:55] years until after the
[1:49:59] Captivity what is 70 years remember we'
[1:50:02] preached on Daniel
[1:50:05] before what is the 70
[1:50:08] years it's 10 is seven
[1:50:13] decades amen what's a
[1:50:16] decade A decade is 10 years right
[1:50:20] is that right a century is 100
[1:50:26] years a
[1:50:28] decade is 10
[1:50:30] years so what's 70
[1:50:33] years seven
[1:50:38] decades what is the 70 years of
[1:50:41] captivity it's a type of the seven
[1:50:43] Church
[1:50:45] ages Jeremiah paid the
[1:50:48] price before for 70
[1:50:53] years and then he
[1:50:56] told keep the
[1:50:59] title
[1:51:01] and hide
[1:51:03] it preserve it in an earth and
[1:51:07] vessel until after the
[1:51:10] Captivity and after the
[1:51:12] Captivity take it out
[1:51:15] again hallelujah

[1:51:35] come back
[1:51:36] out hallelujah hallelujah but this time
[1:51:40] is not to purchase
[1:51:42] again Jesus Christ doesn't have to
[1:51:45] die he hasn't he doesn't have to come
[1:51:48] back and and be crucified
[1:51:51] again no that's already
[1:51:55] happened but now they crucify the
[1:52:00] word not the flesh the
[1:52:04] word not the flesh the
[1:52:08] word not the prophet the
[1:52:14] word amen but this time amen amen that
[1:52:19] same one that paid the

[1:53:51] Jeremiah you're not looking at Jeremiah
[1:53:53] like the denominations look at
[1:53:56] Jeremiah you're not looking at Ezekiel
[1:53:59] as somebody else looks at
[1:54:02] Ezekiel when you're reading Ezekiel and
[1:54:06] Jeremiah you you have that
[1:54:09] picture in your

[2:04:18] comes to the miracle of the
[2:04:21] word what's that I mean I don't know
[2:04:24] what that
[2:04:28] is brother brandham always taught
[2:04:31] us he always taught us the word is above
[2:04:41] everything and everything else has got
[2:04:44] to be judged by the
[2:04:46] word and who revealed the word the
[2:04:51] prophet there's no higher
[2:04:54] office to reveal the word than a
[2:05:00] prophet he reveals the
[2:05:02] word because he ain't
[2:05:05] speaking what he thinks the word
[2:05:09] means he is saying directly thus say the
[2:05:14] Lord why because the Lord speaks to the
[2:05:19] prophet in that
[2:05:24] manner you understand people don't know
[2:05:27] what the message
[2:05:28] is they just think it's you know another
[2:05:31] religion and we follow the message

[2:05:37] believe in the
[2:05:41] message

[2:05:47] word or it ain't the
[2:05:51] word this is either
[2:05:53] true or it's
[2:05:56] false this is either something to die
[2:06:01] for and live
[2:06:04] for or don't follow it at
[2:06:10] all brother brother bam
[2:06:15] said speaking to the critics
[2:06:19] he said if the
[2:06:23] apostles
[2:06:24] [Music]
[2:06:25] planned the death of
[2:06:28] Jesus he said why would they give their
[2:06:31] life for
[2:06:33] it if if it was
[2:06:35] false that's what the prophet
[2:06:38] said if they knew that it was just a
[2:06:44] play it was
[2:06:47] fake Jesus didn't really raise from the
[2:06:52] dead it was all
[2:06:55] fake brother B says then tell

[2:07:01] Fai why did they die for

[2:07:20] and you think it's right and it's not
[2:07:23] right you can die like that I'll die for
[2:07:26] this and it's false but you're
[2:07:32] ignorant but the critic was
[2:07:36] saying that they planned it all
[2:07:39] out amen he said they would never have
[2:07:43] died for
[2:07:46] that but each one of them
[2:07:49] gave their

[2:11:04] gods other
[2:11:07] idols and because of all of
[2:11:11] this verse three the showers have been
[2:11:17] withholden remember we touched that
[2:11:20] Wednesday if you want the reference of
[2:11:23] that Deuteronomy
[2:11:26] 11 verses 13 to
[2:11:29] 14 God in the
[2:11:32] law told the children of
[2:11:35] Israel by Moses when you enter into the
[2:11:39] land that I have promised you you got to
[2:11:42] follow my
[2:11:44] word if you don't follow my word and if
[2:11:48] if you don't do what I have
[2:11:51] commanded I will hold back the
[2:11:54] rain but if you do what I have
[2:11:58] commanded I will send rain in due
[2:12:02] season and and that rain is
[2:12:06] what Without
[2:12:09] Rain there's no
[2:12:14] agriculture Without Rain there's no
[2:12:17] prosperity
[2:12:19] Without Rain there's no
[2:12:22] corn there there's no there's no grain
[2:12:25] there's no
[2:12:26] wheat there's no wine there's no oil but
[2:12:31] he says I will send
[2:12:33] rain you will have wheat you'll have
[2:12:37] wine and you'll have
[2:12:39] oil amen amen I sin former
[2:12:43] rain what's the former
[2:12:45] rain it's Mor
[2:12:49] the brother B taught us the Hebrew word
[2:12:53] for former rain is Mor he said what is
[2:12:57] that sewing the
[2:13:00] seed it's teaching rain it's the seed
[2:13:05] going into the
[2:13:06] ground and the rain
[2:13:09] falling at that time that's former rain
[2:13:13] he says and then there's a latter
[2:13:16] rain that's for the
[2:13:19] Harvest after it has come out of the
[2:13:22] ground after it has
[2:13:26] budded after it's given the
[2:13:29] fruit and it needs the last
[2:13:33] rain brother bam said that's the latter
[2:13:37] rain the latter rain is for the
[2:13:41] Harvest it's the last rain before the
[2:13:46] Harvest former rain
[2:13:48] and latter R and we are
[2:13:51] promised in the Book of
[2:13:53] Joel chapter 2 that in this age we were
[2:13:58] going to be
[2:14:00] sent it was going to be sent to
[2:14:03] us amen amen former rain and latter rain
[2:14:09] in the same
[2:14:11] month and that month is the month of
[2:14:16] April and that month of April is the
[2:14:20] spring time and that and that spring
[2:14:24] time is a type of the
[2:14:28] resurrection and that
[2:14:30] Resurrection has come in the evening
[2:14:33] time to resurrect us out of dark
[2:14:38] denominationalism after the
[2:14:41] winter the cold has killed all of the
[2:14:45] botney
[2:14:46] life in the spring time the flower comes
[2:14:50] out
[2:14:51] again amen the
[2:14:53] trees amen give its fruit again in the
[2:14:57] spring time there's
[2:15:01] Resurrection
[2:15:03] amen so Joel chapter 2
[2:15:06] says I will send former rain and latter
[2:15:10] rain at the same
[2:15:12] time I will
[2:15:15] restore sayth the Lord so this
[2:15:18] message has those two
[2:15:22] rains the the message teaches us the son
[2:15:27] of man
[2:15:28] Ministry is the
[2:15:30] S who was the swer the son of man who
[2:15:34] SED the seed Matthew 13 the S is the son
[2:15:40] of
[2:15:41] man right so to sew the
[2:15:45] seed there was needed rain
[2:15:48] reain of
[2:15:51] teaching Hallelujah and that teaching is
[2:15:55] what Jesus taught the
[2:15:57] disciples he was teaching them the works
[2:16:00] that I do you shall do also that was a
[2:16:04] seed being planted he was teaching them
[2:16:09] I come from my father I'm here on the
[2:16:12] earth I'm going to leave the Earth and
[2:16:14] go back to the father he was teaching
[2:16:18] amen amen there's something coming I got
[2:16:21] to go so that this power can fill you
[2:16:27] amen amen and you can
[2:16:29] continue he was teaching
[2:16:31] them that's the
[2:16:34] teaching but then brother Adam said on
[2:16:37] the day of Pentecost what they had been
[2:16:41] taught what they had been
[2:16:44] planted amen now it was time in the book
[2:16:48] of Acts to give the
[2:16:51] fruits of what they had been taught in
[2:16:54] the book of Acts is the
[2:16:57] fruits of what Jesus taught
[2:17:00] them that's why I believe that this
[2:17:04] message has got to produce
[2:17:07] something in your
[2:17:10] life amen do you believe
[2:17:14] that do you believe this message has
[2:17:16] something in it
[2:17:19] that will take the
[2:17:21] church and Christ in the
[2:17:24] church will write another book of
[2:17:27] Acts is that what the prophet said
[2:17:30] Christ in the church will be another
[2:17:34] book of
[2:17:35] Acts
[2:17:36] amen hallelujah there will be a church
[2:17:40] without
[2:17:42] sin a sin-free
[2:17:45] church hallelujah amen that there's no
[2:17:48] three kinds of
[2:17:50] [Applause]

[2:17:53] believers do you believe that amen
[2:17:59] amen amen
[2:18:01] amen amen
[2:18:04] hallelujah because in the upper
[2:18:07] room Judas was
[2:18:09] gone amen amen the
[2:18:12] unbelievers didn't even get close to
[2:18:16] Judas
[2:18:18] they weren't in the picture no
[2:18:20] more amen amen and for 20 years
[2:18:25] after they still weren't in the
[2:18:28] picture he acts chapter
[2:18:31] 4 it says that when an ananas and Safara
[2:18:38] died because they tried to do some kind
[2:18:42] of false thing there lies and schemes
[2:18:46] and money
[2:18:49] hu they
[2:18:52] died Peter said why have you lied to the
[2:18:56] Holy
[2:18:58] Spirit see he knew what was inside of
[2:19:02] him but there were telling
[2:19:05] him they weren't telling Holy
[2:19:08] Spirit this is the money we
[2:19:11] have no they told Peter Peter we sold
[2:19:16] our property
[2:19:18] and this is our
[2:19:21] money amen amen Peter said why have you
[2:19:25] lied to the holy
[2:19:30] spirit amen
[2:19:33] amen and she died right he
[2:19:38] died amen amen and they buried
[2:19:41] him read the Bible they buried him
[2:19:46] before his wife wife could get to
[2:19:50] church that's how long she took to get
[2:19:53] to
[2:19:57] church she was running late that
[2:20:04] morning amen and by the time she got to
[2:20:08] church Hallelujah her husband was
[2:20:12] dead buried
[2:20:14] already didn't Peter say that
[2:20:17] when she got there she said what what
[2:20:21] happened where's my
[2:20:23] husband they said they the men already
[2:20:26] left to bury him and you have
[2:20:30] participated in the
[2:20:32] same and she died right there
[2:20:37] too they buried
[2:20:39] her and the Bible says that they were
[2:20:42] already on their way
[2:20:43] back they had already buried ananas
[2:20:48] they came
[2:20:49] back and Peter said bury her
[2:20:52] too so they took her but but the point
[2:20:57] is that the people heard
[2:21:00] this and they
[2:21:05] feared to be part of that little
[2:21:13] church they didn't want to get close to
[2:21:16] that
[2:21:18] it wasn't a a very inviting
[2:21:24] church but for the predestinated
[2:21:27] seed it's an
[2:21:29] attraction Hallelujah for the
[2:21:33] world if I go there and I have sin in my
[2:21:37] life I can die like this I don't want to
[2:21:45] go brother bam said
[2:21:48] thus sayith the
[2:21:49] Lord that same thing will come back to
[2:21:54] the church amen that's either truth or
[2:21:58] it's not
[2:22:01] truth there's going to be a free a
[2:22:04] sin-free
[2:22:06] church amen and that's why that's why
[2:22:10] we're we're
[2:22:13] contending amen amen that's why we got
[2:22:16] to keep the
[2:22:18] word before the
[2:22:22] people I can't change
[2:22:25] you I can't do something to change
[2:22:29] you but I can present the
[2:22:32] word and show
[2:22:34] you what the word has called us to do in
[2:22:37] this
[2:22:40] hour so latter
[2:22:43] rain is rapturing faith
[2:22:47] resume of the
[2:22:49] ages brother bam said what will happen
[2:22:52] to the true
[2:22:55] seed it
[2:22:57] will
[2:22:58] happen just as we have said the people
[2:23:02] of God are being made
[2:23:06] ready by the word of
[2:23:08] truth from the
[2:23:10] messenger to this age in her will be the
[2:23:15] fullness of
[2:23:17] Pentecost for the spirit will bring the
[2:23:21] people back to where they
[2:23:23] were at the beginning that's thus sayth
[2:23:27] the
[2:23:29] Lord and thus sayth the Lord is Joel
[2:23:36] 223 see and he reads the Scripture it is
[2:23:40] thus sayth the Lord for it is what Joel
[2:23:44] 223 to 26 says
[2:23:49] I will sin former
[2:23:52] rain and I will cause to come down the
[2:23:57] rain the former rain and the latter rain
[2:24:01] in the first
[2:24:03] month what's the first month for
[2:24:06] Israel in the book of Exodus chapter
[2:24:10] 12 that's when their calendar
[2:24:13] began in The Exodus not in captivity
[2:24:17] but in the time of The
[2:24:19] Exodus God told
[2:24:21] Moses this will be your first
[2:24:24] month abib hallelujah amen and this will
[2:24:29] be the time on the 12th day amen amen
[2:24:34] you shall
[2:24:37] leave so that's
[2:24:40] April so he says here I will
[2:24:43] sin former rain and lighter rain
[2:24:47] in the first month and the floor shall
[2:24:50] be full of
[2:24:51] Wheat and the vat shall
[2:24:56] overflow with wine and oil I will
[2:24:59] restore to
[2:25:01] you all the years that the Locust have
[2:25:05] eaten the caterpillar the Palmer
[2:25:08] worm all this corruption and
[2:25:10] sin that entered through the church
[2:25:13] ages after the church ages restore back
[2:25:19] that first church amen amen he's not
[2:25:22] going to he says it right here he's not
[2:25:25] going to plant a new
[2:25:27] church no no but he's going to bring his
[2:25:31] original
[2:25:34] plan back to the original
[2:25:37] seed he is doing it at is as it
[2:25:41] stated in verse
[2:25:44] 23 by the by the teaching
[2:25:47] former rain and next will come the
[2:25:52] Harvest
[2:25:53] rain the latter rain or the
[2:25:57] same as rapturing
[2:26:00] F hallelujah hallelujah so latter
[2:26:04] rain amen is rapturing Faith and the
[2:26:08] reason that
[2:26:10] Jeremiah is prophesying here telling the
[2:26:14] church you have no lad
[2:26:18] why because you're in
[2:26:21] prostitution there's no rapturing
[2:26:24] faith where their
[2:26:27] lovers is something other than the
[2:26:30] word who is God the word who is
[2:26:35] saying return to me God is saying that
[2:26:40] he's speaking to
[2:26:42] Israel
[2:26:43] Jerusalem as his wife because they are
[2:26:47] in Covenant
[2:26:49] relation amen amen is did God make a
[2:26:52] covenant with
[2:26:54] Israel did he
[2:26:56] swear by his word that he was going to
[2:26:59] keep them that they were going to be his
[2:27:02] people that's a covenant just like
[2:27:06] marriage amen amen amen For Better or
[2:27:10] For
[2:27:11] Worse and this is the
[2:27:15] worst amen still in the worst he's
[2:27:19] saying come
[2:27:20] back
[2:27:22] return and forsake all those
[2:27:26] lovers and I will receive
[2:27:31] you
[2:27:33] right but we showed
[2:27:37] Wednesday that God's
[2:27:40] patience God's
[2:27:43] longsuffering amen amen Runs Out
[2:27:47] how many know that that say we showed it
[2:27:50] Wednesday
[2:27:51] right the same thing Jesus with
[2:27:57] Jerusalem right oh Jerusalem oh
[2:28:00] Jerusalem the same thing with the
[2:28:02] prophet in this
[2:28:04] age oh United
[2:28:07] States Oh California Oh California
[2:28:15] oh
[2:28:17] how I
[2:28:18] tried amen amen to gather you as the
[2:28:22] hind of
[2:28:23] Brew hallelujah amen but you would not
[2:28:28] he said now judgment is
[2:28:31] Strike right didn't he say that we we we
[2:28:35] preached it
[2:28:36] Wednesday but I I wanted to start
[2:28:40] here amen amen but when we go to chapter
[2:28:44] seven remember God tells Jeremiah in
[2:28:48] verse
[2:28:50] 16 that no
[2:28:53] longer to pray for this
[2:28:56] people God is not accepting intercession
[2:28:59] for her no
[2:29:00] more there was a time that he was
[2:29:03] calling
[2:29:04] her but that time of calling isn't
[2:29:10] forever God
[2:29:12] calls return return return
[2:29:17] but she would not so what did Jesus say
[2:29:21] now the armies are going to Compass
[2:29:25] jerus and he told the
[2:29:28] elect when you see that Flee for Your
[2:29:32] Life Now judgment was going to
[2:29:37] strike and the prophet told us when this
[2:29:40] ecumenical
[2:29:41] council brings the
[2:29:43] squeeze that will be the time to
[2:29:46] manifest the
[2:29:48] testimony of the third pool amen am to
[2:29:52] preach to the eternally
[2:29:54] lost because there's no more Mercy there
[2:29:58] no more salvation he that is filthy
[2:30:00] filthy still he that is Holy be holy
[2:30:04] still amen amen they've crossed a line
[2:30:07] between mercy and
[2:30:09] judgment but God will keep the
[2:30:12] church after the door is closed for a
[2:30:16] little while
[2:30:17] as a
[2:30:18] testimony to the eternally
[2:30:21] lost amen
[2:30:24] amen amen not for
[2:30:27] salvation Jesus third had a third pool
[2:30:31] did he have a third
[2:30:33] pool yes what was his third pool
[2:30:37] preaching to the eternally
[2:30:39] [Music]
[2:30:40] lost amen am and brother Ram said the
[2:30:44] third pool will be man
[2:30:47] manifested in the
[2:30:51] squeeze but you got to understand that a
[2:30:55] third pool was in
[2:30:59] process first he spoke things into
[2:31:03] existence by that third pool amen
[2:31:08] amen he spoke to the storm did Jesus do
[2:31:12] the same that was the third pull in
[2:31:15] Jesus
[2:31:16] amen
[2:31:18] amen but that was just in
[2:31:21] portion and then what was the next thing
[2:31:24] brother Bram said the next part of the
[2:31:26] third
[2:31:27] pool after
[2:31:30] speaking into existence after the spoken
[2:31:33] word
[2:31:34] power there's a next step to the third
[2:31:38] po anointing on at the end
[2:31:41] time amen amen in The Sixth Seal he also
[2:31:44] revealed it he said what was that the
[2:31:48] opening of the
[2:31:51] word the third pool open the Seven
[2:31:56] Seals that was the third pool in
[2:32:00] operation the
[2:32:02] revealing of the
[2:32:04] mystery amen amen hallelujah and he said
[2:32:08] in questions and
[2:32:09] answers on the seals while he's
[2:32:13] preaching the seals in the Tabernacle he
[2:32:16] said there's something happening here
[2:32:19] nobody's catching it he said but if you
[2:32:22] can
[2:32:23] understand it's the third
[2:32:26] pool see but carinal people they don't
[2:32:31] want to take those things they just want
[2:32:33] to point literal literal literal
[2:32:37] literal it is not only
[2:32:39] literal it is
[2:32:43] spiritual yes sir the prophet shows you
[2:32:49] that and when that spiritual
[2:32:52] revelation of that third pool was an
[2:32:56] operation nobody caught
[2:32:58] it he said but this is going to come
[2:33:02] back
[2:33:03] around remember we' preached on that
[2:33:06] amen amen the cycle will return
[2:33:11] again he was in that
[2:33:13] cycle he says but it's going to come
[2:33:15] back
[2:33:17] and he says and when it
[2:33:19] does amen amen he said if you have a
[2:33:23] crystal if you have a
[2:33:26] gene in your soul if you're
[2:33:29] predestinated this is only for the
[2:33:31] seed it's ain't for nobody else it's a
[2:33:35] secret hallelujah hallelujah the angel
[2:33:38] told him don't reveal it
[2:33:42] publicly I will reveal it not you I will
[2:33:48] show the
[2:33:49] people I will teach the people what the
[2:33:52] third pull
[2:33:53] is because of this there's no
[2:33:59] impersonation amen amen and that's why
[2:34:04] amen amen anybody can
[2:34:07] impersonate laying on of hands Mark
[2:34:11] 16 first pool anybody can
[2:34:15] impersonate there's there's an old man
[2:34:18] here that that that his body
[2:34:21] hurts
[2:34:23] hallelujah what old
[2:34:26] man amen doesn't body doesn't hurt my
[2:34:29] body
[2:34:31] hurts and I ain't that
[2:34:38] old amen but there rose up a lot of
[2:34:43] impersonations amen oh my
[2:34:46] [Music]
[2:34:47] discernment so
[2:34:51] called but the angel told him I told you
[2:34:55] not to teach the
[2:34:59] people you can't teach Pentecostal
[2:35:04] babies Supernatural
[2:35:11] things is that right amen so that was a
[2:35:15] second part of the third
[2:35:18] pool what about what's the last
[2:35:21] part what's the last part of the third
[2:35:24] pool first part Jesus cursed the
[2:35:28] tree he stopped the
[2:35:31] storm amen amen spoken word second part
[2:35:36] Matthew 24 he told the disciples let's
[2:35:40] go to the Mount
[2:35:41] olives brother Bram said there Jesus
[2:35:46] preached the Seven
[2:35:48] Seals did Jesus preach the Seven
[2:35:51] Seals read read or listen the six
[2:35:55] seals and brother Ram says it right
[2:35:57] there in the six
[2:35:58] seal he preached the Seven
[2:36:02] Seals the opening of the
[2:36:04] word that's the second part of the third
[2:36:07] pool amen amen but what was the third
[2:36:10] souls in prison
[2:36:12] now Jesus is third
[2:36:14] pool
[2:36:16] after the
[2:36:18] crucifixion he went to hell and preach
[2:36:21] those
[2:36:22] souls in
[2:36:25] prison you understand
[2:36:28] that why am I saying that because this
[2:36:32] is right here in the book of
[2:36:35] Jeremiah but listen to
[2:36:37] something this this came fresh this
[2:36:41] Revelation came last
[2:36:44] night amen
[2:36:48] Jeremiah is seeing
[2:36:50] that don't God tells him remember we've
[2:36:54] already spoke on this but he tells him
[2:36:58] don't pray for this
[2:37:00] people Jeremiah
[2:37:05] 729 the same Prophet that was
[2:37:08] telling
[2:37:10] Jerusalem return
[2:37:12] return thus say the Lord you're in
[2:37:16] prostitution but return I'll still
[2:37:18] receive
[2:37:19] you but
[2:37:22] now he tells him in in verse
[2:37:25] 29 cut off thine hair oh Jerusalem and
[2:37:30] cast it
[2:37:33] away and take up lamentation on high
[2:37:37] places for the Lord have rejected and
[2:37:41] forsaken the generation of his
[2:37:44] Wrath
[2:37:49] he's
[2:37:50] done with that
[2:37:53] generation and William brandham this is
[2:37:55] what I'm trying to show
[2:37:57] you Jeremiah a type of Christ son of man
[2:38:03] and that same Ministry repeated again in
[2:38:07] the seventh
[2:38:08] angel
[2:38:10] right so Jeremiah is a type of
[2:38:13] Christ and a type of the seven
[2:38:17] Jeremiah sees that
[2:38:20] time
[2:38:22] hey Mercy is
[2:38:24] over souls in prison
[2:38:29] now but the last grp brother sister
[2:38:33] Hallelujah the other part to preaching
[2:38:37] to the Eternal
[2:38:39] lost he
[2:38:43] says that right there
[2:38:46] you see I hope you catch
[2:38:49] this that right there you find in the
[2:38:54] Book of
[2:39:00] Ezekiel you catch
[2:39:02] it he find you find it in the Book of
[2:39:09] Ezekiel because
[2:39:11] Jeremiah after
[2:39:14] this
[2:39:17] he steps
[2:39:21] back he doesn't
[2:39:25] continue he stops right
[2:39:28] there Jeremiah in the Bible you see that
[2:39:33] in the
[2:39:35] ministry of
[2:39:38] Jeremiah and he
[2:39:41] waits he only
[2:39:44] Waits
[2:39:46] but
[2:39:47] then at that time is when
[2:39:52] Ezekiel
[2:39:53] catches that
[2:39:56] Revelation I hope you're understanding
[2:39:58] this and Ezekiel
[2:40:02] becomes in the final voice to the final
[2:40:06] age
[2:40:09] Hallelujah you catch it Amen brother
[2:40:12] sister this is so
[2:40:14] perfect
[2:40:17] it's and it's right here in the
[2:40:19] Bible it's right
[2:40:22] here Jeremiah's
[2:40:26] Ministry is so
[2:40:28] perfect the shadow cannot cannot show
[2:40:33] something
[2:40:34] different of what the real thing
[2:40:37] is Amen brother bam said remember when
[2:40:41] he talks about
[2:40:42] Shadows he said if there's a shadow of
[2:40:45] an El
[2:40:46] elephant he said I can't expect a lion
[2:40:49] to come
[2:40:51] out right if I'm looking at the Shadow
[2:40:54] and I still don't see the the what's
[2:40:57] causing the shadow come
[2:41:01] out right and I see the shadow here and
[2:41:04] the thing that's causing is back
[2:41:07] there but I look at the shadow I see oh
[2:41:10] look it has a
[2:41:12] figure I can't expect what going to come
[2:41:16] out to be something different than what
[2:41:19] it's
[2:41:21] reflecting amen I got to expect the same
[2:41:27] thing right so it's the same thing here
[2:41:32] if this is the
[2:41:33] shadow I can't
[2:41:36] expect something different today
[2:41:41] o
[2:41:43] amen and people try to make up
[2:41:47] things because they have already fixed a
[2:41:51] way to see it and when something else
[2:41:55] comes up and they can't make it
[2:41:59] fit they make it
[2:42:03] fit but it it doesn't go
[2:42:06] there the the piece of the
[2:42:10] puzzle is too
[2:42:14] hard amen
[2:42:16] right how many know the word is a
[2:42:20] puzzle how many know there's pieces in
[2:42:22] the puzzle that look like it goes in a
[2:42:25] certain
[2:42:28] place and it has the same shapes and
[2:42:31] everything but you put it in
[2:42:34] there it's
[2:42:37] hard right and then you try to move it
[2:42:40] and it moves the whole
[2:42:42] thing right amen it doesn't go there
[2:42:48] doesn't go there and that's what people
[2:42:51] do with
[2:42:53] teaching why do I say
[2:42:55] that why do I say that because right
[2:42:58] here is showing us the
[2:43:01] shadow so when you come over here to the
[2:43:04] days of Jesus you say okay this is what
[2:43:08] people have made
[2:43:10] up then if that
[2:43:14] Ministry that stopped the
[2:43:17] storm that preached the
[2:43:20] seals then he has to go down to
[2:43:24] Hell speaking of this time he has to go
[2:43:28] to hell
[2:43:30] again in this
[2:43:33] ageu to go preach to to the ones that
[2:43:35] are in
[2:43:37] Hell
[2:43:39] see that's a that's a good human
[2:43:44] reasoning that's that's pretty good but
[2:43:47] it ain't the
[2:43:49] word that's why in that same
[2:43:52] message brother bam teaches us a
[2:43:56] revelation and what is that
[2:43:58] Revelation hell is being
[2:44:03] created right here on the
[2:44:06] earth so there's no
[2:44:10] necessity to go
[2:44:13] down amen understand
[2:44:15] like Jesus did because Revelation
[2:44:19] chapter
[2:44:21] n
[2:44:23] says that the bottomless
[2:44:26] pit was
[2:44:29] open and 200 million
[2:44:32] demons come out and the prophet said the
[2:44:37] preaching I'm I'm telling you what the
[2:44:39] prophet said not what I
[2:44:41] think I've already preached it in this
[2:44:44] series
[2:44:46] remember ezekiel's testimony to the
[2:44:49] Eternal
[2:44:52] lost right ezekiel's
[2:44:55] testimony to the eternally
[2:44:58] lost and I read the
[2:45:01] quotes amen where brother Ram said God
[2:45:04] will keep the
[2:45:06] church is that what he
[2:45:09] said God will keep the
[2:45:12] church here on the Earth
[2:45:15] after the door is
[2:45:18] closed and brother Bram
[2:45:20] prayed Lord give the
[2:45:23] church the
[2:45:25] ministry remember I read it of the
[2:45:29] testimony to the Eternal
[2:45:31] law and then later on he said she will
[2:45:36] remain to be a
[2:45:38] witness and to preach to the eternally
[2:45:43] lost here on the Earth
[2:45:46] is that is that third
[2:45:50] pool is that third
[2:45:52] pool that can't be
[2:45:54] impersonated how can you impersonate
[2:45:57] something that you're
[2:46:00] not in other words how can you be a
[2:46:05] witness Amen to the Eternal
[2:46:07] lost if you're Eternal
[2:46:11] loss Hallelujah if you're a deceived
[2:46:15] Church by the
[2:46:17] world amen amen if if you know that the
[2:46:22] door is
[2:46:24] closed and you don't have the Holy
[2:46:27] Ghost according to the Bible you're
[2:46:30] going to be looking for that oil you're
[2:46:34] not going to be
[2:46:36] testifying to the Eternal loss no the
[2:46:40] foolish virgin ain't going to be trying
[2:46:43] to
[2:46:44] impersonate
[2:46:45] and she if she knows she she ain't ready
[2:46:47] for the
[2:46:48] Rapture amen amen because of false
[2:46:52] teaching brother Ram said in the seven
[2:46:55] seal false
[2:46:57] teaching kept the foolish virgin
[2:47:00] here but she's of the same
[2:47:03] material of the
[2:47:06] Bride amen amen now I'm closing with
[2:47:08] this
[2:47:09] now but but I'm showing you something
[2:47:13] you amen this this is so
[2:47:17] beautiful this this is so
[2:47:20] beautiful
[2:47:22] because the foolish
[2:47:24] virgin according to Matthew
[2:47:26] 25 will be looking for the
[2:47:30] oil amen she'll be looking for the
[2:47:35] oil so she can't
[2:47:38] impersonate being a
[2:47:40] witness to the eternally
[2:47:43] lost you
[2:47:45] understand that's the foolish virgin
[2:47:48] what about the
[2:47:50] Lost they're lost they're looking for
[2:47:54] salvation right and there's only three
[2:47:57] classes of
[2:47:59] people so the only other group that's
[2:48:02] left is the
[2:48:04] bride you understand and she because of
[2:48:08] her
[2:48:10] life or should I say his
[2:48:13] life in her
[2:48:16] she will be a
[2:48:17] witness that will be a
[2:48:20] testimony that she's in the
[2:48:23] ark and not outside the
[2:48:27] ark brother bam said God closed the door
[2:48:32] not Noah not his wife not his kids God
[2:48:37] closed the door and when God Clos the
[2:48:39] door Noah and his family stayed in the
[2:48:44] ark
[2:48:45] with the door closed and it still did
[2:48:48] not
[2:48:50] rain I think it was seven or 10
[2:48:54] days right amen it didn't rain brother
[2:48:58] Ram said that that little part right
[2:49:01] there in the scripture in the shadow is
[2:49:06] to show you that that same thing will
[2:49:09] repeat
[2:49:10] again amen amen and there will be a
[2:49:12] little a little period of time
[2:49:16] before tribulation
[2:49:18] starts before the bride
[2:49:21] leaves that he will keep her here and
[2:49:24] show the people on the
[2:49:27] outside that she is
[2:49:29] sealed on the
[2:49:31] inside amen amen but the door ain't
[2:49:35] open for the people to come
[2:49:38] in that's not the purpose when Jesus
[2:49:41] went to preach to the
[2:49:43] souls he didn't went to to pull them out
[2:49:45] of
[2:49:47] purgatory and take them to Heaven no he
[2:49:50] went only to
[2:49:52] preach to the lost that had no more
[2:49:56] salvation it wasn't for
[2:50:00] salvation it wasn't for
[2:50:02] repentance that preaching was
[2:50:08] testimony amen you understand and
[2:50:11] brother Ram said just like Jeremiah
[2:50:15] now I see the
[2:50:18] picture he says I have to lay
[2:50:23] back I have to wait because he said if I
[2:50:27] continue in my
[2:50:29] Ministry his next
[2:50:32] step was to preach to the eternally
[2:50:37] L that was his next
[2:50:40] step and he knew that I already spoke
[2:50:43] the word created squirrels God did I
[2:50:48] stopped the storm
[2:50:51] God the seals have already been open my
[2:50:55] next step is to preach to the eternally
[2:50:59] lost so if I
[2:51:02] continue that's what's next but God told
[2:51:05] him don't
[2:51:08] continue wait
[2:51:11] Hallelujah brother that's
[2:51:13] precious that is
[2:51:15] precious

[2:51:22] feet but
[2:51:25] Ezekiel they caught the
[2:51:28] message of

[2:51:36] Was where he

[2:53:16] amen amen cut off your
[2:53:20] hair in other words the hair on the
[2:53:24] woman is a
[2:53:27] sign of

[2:54:04] woman without that
[2:54:07] hair or prayers are not

[2:54:49] generation I have
[2:54:51] rejected this
[2:54:53] generation the generation of my
[2:54:58] wrath rejected the voice of
[2:55:01] God through William
[2:55:04] Bram how did they reject the
[2:55:07] husband the bridegroom's
[2:55:10] voice was
[2:55:12] speaking through elaser
[2:55:16] brother Bram said the call of the
[2:55:21] bridegroom will come through Luke
[2:55:27] 1730 where did he say it proven his
[2:55:31] word the bridegroom
[2:55:34] call so the voice of the
[2:55:38] bridegroom amen amen and the voice of
[2:55:42] the
[2:55:43] Bride now
[2:55:45] watch brother bam tells
[2:55:47] us amen
[2:55:50] amen Oh
[2:55:55] my he
[2:55:57] says I want to get here and as we're
[2:56:02] standing the musicians may come
[2:56:06] please how many love the
[2:56:09] word how many
[2:56:12] see the picture here
[2:56:16] amen questions and answers on
[2:56:20] Genesis he said I had a hot
[2:56:22] one that down there the other
[2:56:27] day talking about the
[2:56:31] women how she should wear long
[2:56:34] hair and I said a woman that bobbed her
[2:56:38] hair her husband had a
[2:56:41] right and the Bible
[2:56:44] and a Bible right to divorce her that's
[2:56:49] right what the Bible said that's exactly
[2:56:52] right holy ghost woman sitting
[2:56:58] there just the way that she had been
[2:57:02] taught that's all
[2:57:05] Loosely he said now if if they would cut
[2:57:09] it there's something wrong they had to
[2:57:12] cut their hair
[2:57:15] the Bible said let her take a
[2:57:18] razor and shave it all
[2:57:21] off and make her real her hair real
[2:57:27] slick until it comes out her
[2:57:31] head that's right that's what the
[2:57:33] scripture said and it says if she cuts
[2:57:36] her
[2:57:37] hair she dishonors her
[2:57:39] husband and a woman that's
[2:57:43] dishonorable has a legal right to be put
[2:57:46] away in
[2:57:49] divorce but Brothers hear this next
[2:57:53] one but he can't marry again
[2:57:58] now but he can put her away in
[2:58:03] divorcement see
[2:58:06] so so that's that it goes both
[2:58:10] ways amen you see when we speak on
[2:58:12] things like this
[2:58:15] amen amen this little group here is full
[2:58:20] of marriage and divorce
[2:58:25] problems
[2:58:26] amen but is this preaching is not being
[2:58:30] directed to
[2:58:32] nobody you got to understand that don't
[2:58:35] get into the carnal
[2:58:37] mind amen we're speaking about
[2:58:40] Christ and his bride how many know that
[2:58:44] the mystery of Christ and his bride is
[2:58:46] in
[2:58:50] marriage now if we can get that
[2:58:54] correct then you can get this
[2:58:57] correct and you can get the pastor and
[2:59:00] the church
[2:59:02] correct because that's also a
[2:59:05] mystery of Christ and his
[2:59:08] bride amen amen that's what the prophet
[2:59:12] said
[2:59:14] so there there's no reason you
[2:59:18] know to get kind of nervous
[2:59:23] about we believe the word
[2:59:27] am hallelujah
[2:59:29] amen and God will will do the
[2:59:34] work is that right
[2:59:37] amen but brother Ram says that's the
[2:59:41] scripture oh brother what we need is
[2:59:44] some question
[2:59:49] nights then he goes
[2:59:52] on and he
[2:59:54] says I would have you to know that the
[2:59:57] head of every man is
[3:00:00] Christ and the head of the woman is the
[3:00:03] man and the head of Christ is
[3:00:07] God Amen that's the scripture and every
[3:00:11] man praying or
[3:00:12] prophesying
[3:00:14] having his head
[3:00:16] covered dishonors
[3:00:19] Christ right amen so that's why we have
[3:00:23] something and we're going to
[3:00:26] pray or or we're talking about the word
[3:00:30] amen amen we take off our hat
[3:00:33] right to honor Christ because he is our
[3:00:38] head and it
[3:00:42] says
[3:00:45] he says you that the the hair to the
[3:00:47] woman is her
[3:00:51] covering for that I'm reading the quote
[3:00:55] even all as if she was
[3:00:58] shaven that means she's going to cut her
[3:01:01] hair then shave it off brother R is
[3:01:04] reading First Corinthians
[3:01:07] 11 for if the woman be not
[3:01:10] covered let her also be
[3:01:12] Shor sh means
[3:01:16] shaven but if it be a shame for a
[3:01:23] woman if it's a
[3:01:25] shame for a woman to be
[3:01:28] shaven let her be
[3:01:31] covered now we're getting right down to
[3:01:33] the question he
[3:01:34] says it is wrong for a lady to cut her
[3:01:38] hair according to the Bible Now you
[3:01:41] listen right here and see if the Bible
[3:01:42] don't give a man a legal right to put
[3:01:45] away his
[3:01:51] wife see if it's right or not brother B
[3:01:55] saying
[3:01:58] scripturally this is
[3:01:59] correct for a man indeed ought to not
[3:02:02] cover his
[3:02:04] head have long hair for as so much as he
[3:02:08] is in the image and the glory of
[3:02:11] God but the woman
[3:02:14] is the glory of the man did you ever
[3:02:17] think of
[3:02:18] that and then brother B goes on and he
[3:02:21] brings it to the
[3:02:23] church see the woman's a type of the
[3:02:26] church if she cuts her
[3:02:29] hair that's the same thing happening
[3:02:32] with the
[3:02:33] church and this is Paul speaking and he
[3:02:37] said in Galatians 18 if a angel preach
[3:02:40] any other
[3:02:42] gospel already that you would you have
[3:02:44] already heard let him be a
[3:02:46] curse he says now don't blame me blame
[3:02:50] him and I say the same thing tonight
[3:02:53] today don't don't blame me BL blame the
[3:02:58] prophet for a man indeed ought not to
[3:03:01] cover his
[3:03:02] head for as much as he is in the glory
[3:03:05] in the image of God but the woman is IM
[3:03:06] a glory in image of
[3:03:10] man for the man is not of the woman
[3:03:14] but the woman is of the man neither was
[3:03:17] the Man created for a
[3:03:19] woman but the woman was created for a
[3:03:22] man so right there brother bam tells us
[3:03:26] scripturally if she
[3:03:28] dishonors it if the church which is the
[3:03:31] woman dishonors
[3:03:34] Christ what what did he do to
[3:03:37] her he divorced her in other words I'm
[3:03:42] done with you
[3:03:44] but when he says shave your
[3:03:48] head he is telling her in symbol
[3:03:52] form amen amen you can do that because
[3:03:57] I'm not your head no
[3:03:59] more you can do that because I have
[3:04:04] divorced
[3:04:05] you you shave your
[3:04:08] head I have rejected
[3:04:11] you that's what he say
[3:04:15] amen right according to
[3:04:18] this and brother
[3:04:20] Bram sh tells us there's a religious
[3:04:28] perversion
[3:04:30] today brother bam pointed us and told us
[3:04:33] he said look at Jacqueline
[3:04:36] Kennedy
[3:04:39] Kennedy right she was a type brother she
[3:04:43] wasn't
[3:04:45] Jezebel in the whole picture she was
[3:04:48] just one woman but she was a type
[3:04:52] because brother bam said
[3:04:54] Ahab is Washington is Washington is that
[3:04:57] what he said ahab's Washington United
[3:05:01] States Jezebel is
[3:05:03] Rome the
[3:05:05] church but when jacken Kennedy Kenedy
[3:05:09] which
[3:05:10] was John Kennedy's wife John Kennedy had
[3:05:14] her hair
[3:05:16] cut amen he said look that CS an
[3:05:22] epidemic amen all the
[3:05:25] wom going to cut their
[3:05:29] hair have short hair like jacine Kennedy
[3:05:33] Jac Kennedy right she was a
[3:05:37] representation of
[3:05:39] Jezebel because in the Bible in the
[3:05:43] Bible
[3:05:44] when Jezebel married
[3:05:46] Ahab brother Bram
[3:05:49] said Ahab was the
[3:05:55] head
[3:05:57] amen but Jezebel was the
[3:06:00] neck that turned the
[3:06:04] head any way she
[3:06:08] wanted in other words she's in control
[3:06:12] not him
[3:06:15] amen
[3:06:17] Amen brother Bram said the
[3:06:21] church has made a
[3:06:23] covenant behind the
[3:06:25] scenes Washington Washington and Rome
[3:06:29] have come
[3:06:31] together amen for economic
[3:06:35] reasons not for
[3:06:37] love economic
[3:06:39] reasons read the Bible and see why Ahab
[3:06:43] married
[3:06:46] Jezebel for economic reasons but when
[3:06:49] she come in she took
[3:06:52] control all those altars of
[3:06:54] Jehovah tear them down make some for
[3:06:58] baale amen amen all the prophets of God
[3:07:03] I say a
[3:07:04] law kill all those
[3:07:06] prophets kill him with the
[3:07:09] sword is that what Jezebel
[3:07:11] did what do you think she's done here in
[3:07:15] around the world the same thing
[3:07:19] brother hallelujah hallelujah that's the
[3:07:23] that's the that's
[3:07:26] God showing
[3:07:28] us what through the
[3:07:31] scripture but brother and sister if
[3:07:34] that's the glory and the glory left and
[3:07:37] departed the
[3:07:38] temple Ezekiel Saw The Glory come back
[3:07:43] but he was in a vision looking at the
[3:07:46] temple in the new heavens and the new
[3:07:48] Earth he wasn't looking at the Earthly
[3:07:51] Jerusalem no
[3:07:52] more because Galatians 4 Paul said the
[3:07:58] the
[3:07:59] Jerusalem of the earth is the Bond
[3:08:03] woman she received the law
[3:08:06] from her children are
[3:08:09] rebellious she can't produce children
[3:08:12] for the word
[3:08:14] none of her children can obey the word
[3:08:17] none of her children stand for the
[3:08:20] word no
[3:08:22] sir Hallelujah but the Jerusalem from
[3:08:27] above said that's the mother of
[3:08:31] us in other words Paul was saying I am a
[3:08:36] child of that woman Hallelujah glory to
[3:08:41] God and what kind of a son was
[3:08:44] Paul amen a child with
[3:08:47] Revelation a child that walked by the
[3:08:51] Light Of God amen amen hallelujah
[3:08:56] hallelujah and
[3:08:58] Ezekiel Saw The Glory leave the temple
[3:09:01] in
[3:09:03] Jerusalem but in chapter 40 41 42 all
[3:09:09] the way to
[3:09:09] 47 he saw the glory come back to the T
[3:09:14] hallelujah hallelujah but the real
[3:09:17] Temple not the Earthly Jerusalem the
[3:09:20] Heavenly
[3:09:21] Jerusalem and that's the Bride of Jesus
[3:09:24] Christ so that hair has come back not
[3:09:29] for the
[3:09:30] Harlock but for the bride the glory has
[3:09:35] risen upon
[3:09:36] you hallelujah hallelujah amen amen
[3:09:41] Heavenly Father we bless your holy name
[3:09:45] God because we
[3:09:47] realize that this is your grace Lord
[3:09:51] this is your This Is Your Love This Is
[3:09:54] Your
[3:09:55] Glory that has
[3:09:57] come and your Prophet
[3:10:00] said the glory of the Lord has risen
[3:10:04] upon
[3:10:05] you the elect
[3:10:07] lady bride of Jesus
[3:10:11] Christ riseing
[3:10:14] Shine for thy light has
[3:10:16] come and the glory of the Lord has
[3:10:21] risen over
[3:10:25] you oh god oh and he said
[3:10:28] Shalom unto the Bride of Jesus
[3:10:31] Christ The Glory has
[3:10:34] returned you
[3:10:38] divorced you
[3:10:41] divorc the Earthly carnal
[3:10:45] church but Lord there's a marriage
[3:10:48] taking
[3:10:50] place Hallelujah there's a union taking
[3:10:53] place the glory has
[3:10:56] returned the veil was put on the
[3:10:59] shoulder of the
[3:11:05] bridegroom hallelujah hallelujah as a
[3:11:09] sign that she is under the headship
