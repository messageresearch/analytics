[13:20] face we can see face to face why because
[13:25] the
[13:26] perfect has come
[13:34] let's go back to the Book of
[13:43] Revelation
[13:47] Oh chapter
[13:50] 5 we're going to read the first three
[13:54] verses I saw the right hand of him that
[13:56] sat on the throne book written within on
[13:58] on the back side Seven
[14:05] Seals I saw strong Angel Proclaim with a
[14:08] loud voice who was worthy to open the
[14:09] book and to loose the seals
[14:16] thereof now listen to this no man in
[14:19] Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the
[14:21] Earth was able to open the book neither
[14:23] to
[14:27] what look there
[14:36] they couldn't even look
[14:39] at they couldn't look at the
[14:44] book is R when the Old Testament is
[14:48] R there's
[14:51] ail but what happens the L
[14:55] comes
[14:56] open here's the BL
[15:00] Hallelujah that which is perfect is come
[15:04] there was a blast in
[15:14] Arizona and then
[15:17] look 6
[15:20] verse1 I saw when the lamb open one of
[15:22] the seals and I heard as it were the
[15:24] noise of a thunder one of the four be
[15:25] saying come and
[15:27] see
[15:38] now we're able to
[15:40] see now that the took the
[15:43] book come and
[15:45] see before there wasn't no one worthy to
[15:49] take it or to see
[15:52] it look upon it amen am second seal come
[15:58] and see
[16:00] third
[16:06] and in other words no one no one until
[16:12] the sea was open was able to
[16:16] understand what this what this
[16:19] Revelation under the altar
[16:23] was until a prophet came in this last
[16:26] day open it up
[16:29] by the
[16:30] L
[16:32] Christ reing
[16:36] the amen what did it say verse
[16:39] n he had open the fifth seal I
[16:44] saw be under the altar Souls of them
[16:47] that were slain for the word of God and
[16:49] for the testimony which they
[16:57] held and they cried with a loud voice
[16:59] saying how long oh Lord holy and Truth
[17:03] th thou not judge and avenge our blood
[17:05] on them that dwell
[17:14] on and white robes were given unto every
[17:17] one of them and it was said unto them
[17:19] that they should rest for a little
[17:21] season their fellow servants also and
[17:24] their Brethren should be killed as they
[17:26] were should be fulfilled
[17:40] is that right now notice what brother
[17:42] says concerning this fifth
[17:45] shal amen amen now I've already given
[17:51] you
[17:54] uh great majority of that there already
[17:59] but he says in the fifth seal notice now
[18:02] he says the ninth verse Souls under the
[18:06] altar now I'm going to get some I'm
[18:10] going to get some real disagreement on
[18:14] this but I want you to just watch for a
[18:18] minute I always thought that these Souls
[18:22] under the
[18:23] altar were the martyrs of the early
[18:27] church see and I thought so myself but
[18:31] when the Holy Spirit showed me the the
[18:33] vision to
[18:36] it it
[18:42] wasn't see and there when Lord show me
[18:48] those it isn't
[18:51] Souls now you say I don't know what
[18:55] about that well just a
[18:57] minute are not Souls of the Bride church
[19:02] not at all we thought that was a bride
[19:05] Church waiting
[19:06] there Soul under the altar crying how
[19:11] long how long let me read it again he
[19:14] say and when the fifth seal was
[19:16] open I saw under the altar
[19:19] Souls were slain for the word of God and
[19:22] for the testimony they
[19:26] held now notice to avenge their blood he
[19:31] said now at this time the fifth SE being
[19:34] open the church is
[19:37] gone it just it just can't be Souls
[19:40] under the
[19:42] altar of the
[19:44] church now please if you ever did give
[19:49] attention to this pay attention
[19:53] now CU this is great
[19:55] controversy so I want you to listen real
[19:57] closely
[19:59] you got your papers and things to write
[20:02] with these cannot be them
[20:05] Souls the righteous martyr and the
[20:08] righteous
[20:10] people the church the bride has done
[20:14] been took
[20:15] up so they wouldn't be under the
[20:18] altar they'd be in glory with the bride
[20:23] now watch for they are gone in the
[20:26] Rapture the fourth chapter of
[20:29] Revelations they was taken up then he
[20:32] says now you people who are followers of
[20:36] of these
[20:38] teachings UAH Smith theah Smith that's
[20:42] trying to support Soul
[20:46] sleep he says he he mentioned that that
[20:50] the soul
[20:52] sleeps and there's no altar of sacrifice
[20:55] in
[20:57] heaven the only altar that has spoke
[21:00] of that he believes that is is in
[21:04] heaven is the altar of
[21:06] Innocence but you dear
[21:09] people not to defer with my
[21:11] brother I hope to meet him on the other
[21:15] side just to show how this this proves
[21:19] that the opening of this
[21:21] seal in this last day it takes the soul
[21:25] sleeping PL out of the way
[21:29] they're
[21:30] alive if there's no altar of sacrifice
[21:33] in
[21:34] heaven where is a sacrifice for sin
[21:38] lady there has to be a place where the
[21:42] slain
[21:43] lamb is laying and now the
[21:47] incense the orders the stuff that they
[21:51] burned which the Bible said was the
[21:55] prayers of the
[21:56] Saints if there's no
[21:58] sacrifice on the altar then the
[22:02] prayers cannot be
[22:05] received so in other words he's saying
[22:08] how can there be an altar of
[22:10] incense if there's no altar of
[22:13] sacrifice we just got through preaching
[22:15] on is that right amen amen this then he
[22:19] says now notice how can there be an
[22:23] altar of
[22:24] incense there has to be a sacrificial
[22:26] altar that lets the prayers go through
[22:30] through to
[22:32] God but brother Smith was
[22:35] wrong not disagreeing with him I think I
[22:39] made my
[22:40] clear but the fifth
[22:42] seal has been open if you caught it see
[22:47] I'm waiting for my
[22:49] question where where was the ark the
[22:53] slain the wounded the
[22:56] bleeding see and the orders the
[23:01] prayers he wanted people to ask these
[23:05] questions but they they they weren't
[23:07] ready for
[23:08] that that's why when he's preaching on
[23:11] the seals he says please
[23:14] everybody I'm preaching on the seals
[23:17] we're going to have questions and
[23:18] answers Sunday morning he said please
[23:22] let all the questions be concerning this
[23:26] subject
[23:28] amen amen is that
[23:31] right could not ask about you know
[23:35] pajamas you know things like
[23:38] that but he wanted people to ask
[23:41] them about the alter incense and these
[23:44] different
[23:45] things he says if this Earthly
[23:48] Tabernacle be
[23:50] dissolved of our Dwelling Places disolve
[23:52] we have one already
[23:55] waiting that's where I seen those
[24:03] Saint and at the closing of the fifth
[24:06] seal I might inject this here I just
[24:09] read he said the ones the Lord showed me
[24:13] he said where I see these people we were
[24:15] under the
[24:16] altar but not under the altar of
[24:20] sacrifice not under the mo
[24:22] altar amen mind for waiting for the
[24:25] coming of the Lord glory to
[24:29] God is that right Church age look what
[24:34] he says now the question now
[24:38] arises why are these righteous ones in
[24:42] the Judgment there is no other place
[24:45] that they can come up but in in the two
[24:50] Resurrection they canot
[24:52] qualify for the first
[24:54] resurrection so they might come up in
[24:57] the second which is the
[25:00] resurrection unto judgment the ones who
[25:04] qualify for the first
[25:07] resurrection the bride
[25:12] are are not in the
[25:15] Judgment John John
[25:17] 524 very ver I say to you he that Hearth
[25:21] my word and believeth on him that sent
[25:24] me have everlasting life the believe is
[25:28] already
[25:31] received is already a
[25:33] recipient of eternal life which he
[25:37] has now in his
[25:40] possession now shall not come into
[25:44] condemnation shall not come into the
[25:47] Judgment what it really says but see as
[25:52] passed from Death unto life notice
[25:56] carefully Jesus must have yet another
[25:59] group in
[26:01] mind who at a certain
[26:05] Resurrection will receive eternal
[26:08] life they will receive it at this
[26:13] Resurrection not having previously
[26:16] received
[26:17] it as members of the
[26:20] Bride They will receive eternal life at
[26:24] the white Throne
[26:26] judgment amen they did not
[26:30] have eternal
[26:32] life because they weren't
[26:36] redeemable they are granted
[26:39] life at the day of
[26:43] judg is this what he just said amen then
[26:48] he quotes John 5 Mar not at this for the
[26:53] hour is coming in which all that are in
[26:57] the grave
[26:59] shall hear his voice and shall come
[27:01] forth they that have done
[27:04] good unto the resurrection of life and
[27:07] they that have done evilto the
[27:10] resurrection of
[27:12] damnation that's John
[27:14] 5
[27:16] 28 and
[27:18] 29 listen what he says here he teaching
[27:22] on this same subject that we just spoke
[27:25] of he's speaking of Matthew 2
[27:29] where Jesus said at that day amen he
[27:32] will
[27:33] separate the sheep from the
[27:36] goat
[27:39] amen the separation for the sheep of the
[27:41] goats is as the light Throne
[27:45] judgment amenu not like some brother
[27:48] told me amen Mex he said that that's
[27:55] here I said brother the books show
[27:59] us that the bride was separated yes see
[28:03] here but that's not the Fulfillment of
[28:06] that
[28:07] scripture fulfillment of that
[28:10] scripture says the
[28:14] white look at this then he says
[28:18] this and and then he when when he
[28:21] quotes St John 5 he says this is not for
[28:26] the rapture
[28:28] it is only the dead in
[28:31] Christ in Christ that will raise from
[28:35] the
[28:36] grave at that time and the living
[28:40] bride who is still on the earth will go
[28:44] in the Rapture first Thessalonians
[28:48] 4:16 the dead in
[28:51] Christ shall rise
[28:53] first in Christ see amen but it says
[28:58] here in St John 5 that all that are are
[29:02] going to come forth out of the
[29:04] Grave this is the very same
[29:07] resurrection that is spoken of in
[29:11] Revelations where in the
[29:14] dead were brought before the Lord who
[29:17] are judged according to their
[29:19] Works whose names were in the book of
[29:22] lives and were then cast into the lake
[29:24] of
[29:25] fire then he goes on and talks about
[29:28] this but then he says
[29:30] this now Paul said if by any means I
[29:36] might obtain the resurrection of the
[29:38] Dead see he was speaking that he wanted
[29:42] to be
[29:45] resurrected among the
[29:47] dead this is not attaining to the
[29:50] general or the second
[29:56] Resurrection second
[29:57] Resurrection this is
[30:00] attaining to the first
[30:02] resurrection blessed and
[30:04] holy is him that has part in the first
[30:09] resurrection the second death has no
[30:12] power over these but they shall be
[30:15] Priests of
[30:16] God and of Christ and shall re with him
[30:21] a thousand years the first
[30:24] resurrection has nothing to do and has
[30:27] no chance for the second
[30:30] death this is at the end of a thousand
[30:33] years when all the rest of the Dead come
[30:38] again and at that day there will be
[30:42] those who will come forth to eternal
[30:46] life and those others who are caught in
[30:50] the second
[30:51] death now we do not need to guess about
[30:55] those who are in the second Resurrection
[30:58] and are given life we are told it is
[31:02] given to them on the
[31:05] grounds that they have been
[31:09] kind or good to the
[31:12] brother those who are
[31:16] raised and cast into the Lake of
[31:19] Fire will be those who mistreated the
[31:24] brothers since this is the word of God
[31:28] we simply accept
[31:30] it there's no argument here just a
[31:33] simple statement of
[31:36] fact listen to this to further clarify
[31:40] this notice specifically the
[31:44] words of Matthew
[31:47] 25 31 to
[31:50] 46 it does not say that a
[31:54] Shepherd is literally separating sheep
[31:56] from
[31:59] goats but it is as a
[32:02] sheep or as a
[32:04] shepher
[32:06] dividing the
[32:09] BS see in other
[32:11] words this sheep fold or this sheep that
[32:15] he's talking
[32:17] about is not of the
[32:20] F of the
[32:23] elected of the
[32:25] Eternal see read the scripture in
[32:29] Matthew 18 a son of man came to save
[32:33] those which are lost
[32:35] right he leaves the
