bad and before I got up here I don't know what I did I didn't do anything I didn't do anything at all all of a sudden I had a sharp pain in my shoulder right and it's still I can feel just a little bit there but I'm not claiming it take that devil after I went up in the room and I laid on the floor and I spread myself out and I prayed and said God help I said I just feel I I'm nervous I'm worked up I said I can feel in my soul the devil just don't like this you see and he wants to stop the word from going forth you know why because if you hear the truth the truth will set you free that's

don't let him stop don't let him gain ground don't let him even have a word in 40,000 prepared for amen and when when all of a sudden now remember what I said word spreads word spreads what would happen if if God performed a miracle I'm talking about a big miracle raise the dead blinded eyes come open beyond the shadow of a doubt and a supernatural work begin to get done right here right here do you imagine how fast that spread all through the city and all through the state and by those listening in online on the internet all over the country the word would spread quickly people would see something's going on something's happening let's go see what it is let's check it out why cuz they know no man do these things except God be with you yes yes sir yes sir now in chapter five of Joshua when they passed over to the other side all of a sudden fear came on their enemies yes they said man we thought these just a bunch of slaves who got lost in the wilderness somewhere now all of a sudden we're hearing that Supernatural things are being by these people hallelujah these people superatural they went up to the river and they spoke and the [Applause] river anding on with the AR of theen and what it begins to St there's something happening in the the supernatural power that beinged come on sh of the kingar come on now come on the kings of the amorites and the Canaanites and the jebusites and all the other IES that were in the land the fear that Came Upon them for who the children of Israel yeah is that what it said Bible said that their heart melted and their Spirit wasn't in them anymore yeah they were fearful they were afraid oh my because they knew there was a God that dwelt among them yes yes brother that right yes sir there was no guessing at it no playing around no emotional workup they knew there was a god absolutely among them yes sir that's right brother I know see yeah yeah there's a video that he has you can find that on YouTube right right there's a video that TL Osborne speaking about how he went to Brother br's meeting one time and he brother TL said I went to be a missionary and I came up against some of the witch doctors in India M or Africa I'm not sure which one he was at said I came up against some of these and they could do Supernatural things brother talks about them doing that right said make a make a table float in the air remember that make a pencil pick up and wrting in unknown tongues and a witch would interpret it doing Supernatural thing impersonating right so brother Ben said when you go over there and you come up against those things you better know what you better know what he said you better know where you're standing with God you come against something like this you better understand understand something tonight the devil is just as real as God is evil spirits are just as real as the holy spirit is if you're going to go across and fight for what is yours you got to pre be be prepared for battle that's right brother you got to be prepared you got to know what you have and you have to have a fresh experience that's right in the realities of God that's right yes sir soor said I went over there and I came back as a miserable failure said I locked myself in my room and I wouldn't come out he said I told my life I'm going to stay here and I cried and I said God what happened you see and then his wife Daisy said hey I'm going brother B said tell I'm going to his meeting he said well you go ahead and go I'm not going to come and she tells the testimony she went he didn't but little did she know he came later on that night sat in a balcony somewhere and he said all of a sudden brother B called the prayer line and he said there was a little girl that come up in the prayer line I forget what her illness was whether she was blind or something maybe she was deaf but she had a certain illness and brother B told this little girl and he looked to the audience and brother BR says we're going to pray for her now there's an evil spirit that is on her and we're going to pray it offer and so TL Osborne says he says you know he says us Pentecostals yeah that's what he say he says we're afraid of
