[1:05:01] twelve
[1:05:20] remember we were speaking about how he
[1:05:22] delivers the names
[1:05:29] then verse three says the body shall
[1:05:32] shine as the blackness firmament and
[1:05:34] shall turn to the righteousness of the
[1:05:35] stars forever
[1:05:47] he says without that shut the words
[1:05:51] and seal the book
[1:05:54] even
[1:05:56] to the time of the end
[1:05:58] many shall run to enforce shall be
[1:06:00] increased
[1:06:16] the one on this side of the bank of the
[1:06:17] river the other on that side of the
[1:06:19] river back to the river
[1:06:21] i once said to the man clothed in linen
[1:06:25] otis abraham
[1:06:27] odin linen
[1:06:29] which was upon the waters of the river
[1:06:32] how long shall it be to the end of these
[1:06:34] wonders
[1:06:54] and i heard the man clothed in linen
[1:06:59] which is upon the waters of the river
[1:07:00] when he held up his right hand
[1:07:04] and his left hand unto heaven and swear
[1:07:06] by him that liveth forever and ever
[1:07:08] shall be for time times and
[1:07:11] when he shall accomplish to scatter the
[1:07:14] power of the holy people all these
[1:07:15] things shall be finished
[1:08:08] according to that very word verse 7
[1:08:12] when he had
[1:08:13] accomplished to scatter the power of the
[1:08:15] holy people
[1:08:20] that means that all the jews
[1:09:32] amen amongst many purposes
[1:09:39] amen
[1:09:42] does the angel of the lord have many
[1:09:43] purposes
[1:09:44] yes hallelujah
[1:10:00] and his vision to the bride
[1:10:03] he has
[1:10:04] a lot of purposes
[1:10:07] hallelujah
[1:10:08] one of the purposes is to anoint them
[1:10:26] is that one of the purposes
[1:10:28] of
[1:10:40] but i want to
[1:10:41] filter it through this
[1:11:10] ac
[1:11:35] this scene that daniel is seeing right
[1:11:37] here
[1:11:52] is
[1:13:30] hey what that book is illegal oh my god
[1:13:36] is that right but that was sent down to
[1:13:38] the seventh frame
[1:13:41] amen
[1:13:43] and then
[1:13:44] that same
[1:13:58] amen glory amen
[1:14:01] like our sister event the other day
[1:14:03] right
[1:14:05] in the bible
[1:14:12] amen come on glory glory
[1:14:16] hallelujah
[1:14:18] digest the book
[1:14:20] amen eat the words
[1:14:25] eat the bread
[1:14:54] is
[1:15:22] to preach to a certain people
[1:15:26] in the revelation of the entire thing
[1:15:31] you understand
[1:15:32] emotionally
[1:15:34] they're giving power
[1:15:36] to deal with 144
[1:16:01] but what pertains to them

[1:17:26] at the end of 1945
[1:17:39] is
[1:18:10] the
[1:18:39] see that's that that's what makes a
[1:18:41] difference
[1:18:43] as far as that
[1:18:45] but as far as the angel of the lord went
[1:18:48] down to the earth
[1:18:49] he's never left here
[1:19:20] upon the earth
[1:19:33] but as far as the fullness

[1:49:18] beautiful blue water
[1:49:22] and great fish in his face we're
[1:49:24] swimming around in it

[1:50:11] said i don't doubt
[1:50:13] though
[1:50:15] but he wasn't scripture
[1:50:18] and jesus said

[1:59:44] it's so perfect
[1:59:46] in the way of
[1:59:48] of of of the revelation
[1:59:51] because we have seen that
[1:59:53] this one
[1:59:54] is
[2:00:23] season
[2:00:52] same
[2:01:20] amen

[2:10:33] pressing
[2:10:36] the rapture
[2:10:42] because that's not all that's required
[2:10:47] you require that
[2:10:50] and more
[2:10:52] but people in this message become so
[2:10:54] traditional
[2:11:22] what
[2:12:16] hallelujah
[2:12:32] it's in there
[2:12:34] it's about to be revealed
[2:12:38] ain't gonna be revealed with no
[2:12:39] tradition
[2:13:14] that's the hard part is that it's like
[2:13:17] what the madame said is getting that
[2:13:18] dress from the bride
[2:13:28] if she can
[2:13:38] um
[2:13:55] tomorrow's president's day or something
[2:13:56] like that right
[2:13:58] now
[2:14:01] we got some more more important than
[2:14:02] that
[2:14:09] president of heaven
[2:14:22] you
[2:14:38] yes
[2:15:06] forever
[2:15:20] i love the way the prophet does that
[2:15:24] because if you follow him
[2:15:26] what he's doing
[2:15:27] people think these are errors of the
[2:15:29] prophet
[2:15:34] a prophet i've said this before remember
[2:15:37] the prophet is not sent to quote right
[2:15:40] now
[2:15:43] he's not as good and that's terrible
[2:15:46] amen
[2:15:47] he can say john
[2:15:48] you know 1812 and he's really meaning
[2:15:51] 1412.
[2:15:56] hey man oh man
[2:15:58] there's a lot of that
[2:16:02] oh yeah
[2:16:30] that's the only
[2:16:32] that's the only scripture
[2:16:34] from genesis to revelation
[2:16:37] that has the very
[2:16:38] terminology
[2:16:42] no other place
[2:16:44] in the
[2:16:58] other places
[2:17:12] happen in
[2:17:37] but the time of the mystery of god will
[2:17:39] be finished
[2:17:53] whatever that is
[2:18:36] that we're
[2:18:50] people
[2:19:04] the mystery of
[2:19:32] the
[2:20:14] you never give it back
[2:20:23] oh
[2:20:42] oh
[2:20:55] people think that in the mystery of god
[2:20:58] there's not instruction for the people
[2:21:00] there is through something
[2:21:01] that's where people get mixed up they
[2:21:03] don't know what the mystery is
[2:21:06] just mysteries
[2:21:09] it's showing us
[2:21:37] how
[2:21:39] the orders should be at home go and say
[2:21:41] lord to me
[2:21:42] how you should walk in life
[2:21:44] i mean what you must do
[2:21:46] what you must not do
[2:21:48] i reported it wednesday remember
[2:21:49] everything everybody
[2:21:51] let me take a look coming down from
[2:22:03] whether the word of god
[2:22:34] it doesn't work
[2:22:48] can say why don't do people know the
[2:22:50] mystery of god
[2:22:53] they've not been taught the mystery of
[2:22:54] god
[2:22:57] and people think that
[2:22:59] there was rumors that went around last
[2:23:01] year
[2:23:31] by the word
[2:23:34] i've been rebuked by the word
[2:23:36] nevertheless
[2:23:38] amen
[2:23:39] have we preached exhortations
[2:23:44] what did paul
[2:23:57] that's right
[2:24:13] what's it
[2:24:14] oh my goodness
[2:24:21] you know what i mean
[2:24:23] you know
[2:24:24] i don't know if you know what it means
