TRANSCRIPT
========================================
speaking to every believer to be ready always to give an answer of the hope that lies within you you understand so both scriptures are speaking of the same thing but one to ministers and other to every believer you understand so brother and sister to be instant as it says in second Timothy 4 verse it says to be instant amen amen in season and out of season now this it it it shows us something it shows us that Paul knew listen to me he was able to know that in our lives and in the lives of the church in the lives of the body of Christ there are seasons there are different changings of the Season amen amen just like in the natural there is changing of season you understand so he is letting Timothy know that whether it's the season or it's out of season you need to preach you need to reprove you need to rebuke exort with all longsuffering and Doctrine amen amen so the word uh instant or to be instant means to be ready it means especially of a person that is coming upon one suddenly suddenly suddenly right when if they come and say brother you know ready to preach the word oh brother I haven't prayed you know I got to study that's good brother I see see what I'm saying but Paul is saying be instant in season and out of season yes yes in other words there's time to get ready amen and sometimes there ain't no time to get ready and I can say Amen to that especially being out you know in different parts and sometimes I mean you know you're going to go Minister but sometimes you don't know the schedule right right so you have to be ready you have to be ready at all time Pastor going to say brother you're preaching tonight right oh um I ain't ready what are you doing amen amen like like brother brother Larry KH told me one time Larry I I got to his house and I was going to sleep there and I told computer I still got a few more things that I have to pull out and I already had my message but I needed some more quotes amen amen and he said you know brother he was just playing around but it was true he said you know a soldier when he's out in the field he's got to have all his artillery ready he said you you don't come out here in the field to you know get ready supped to come ready amen amen that's true so the thing is this is what Paul is saying even if you're called on suddenly be ready to be at hand amen am that's what that means and then he says in in season right in season in the in the season in the time right which means when the opportunity occurs or when it's convenient and out of season just simply means you're not ready it's not the time it's not the season amen but you have to be ready anyhow brother bam said if we don't have nothing to say as a minister or even as a Believer he said you can testify of what God has done in you amen he said just tell of how God lit your T amen hallelujah amen so if we're Believers if we the bride of Christ we always have to be ready to give a hope Amen to to to give an answer of the hope that lies within us if there's something in us we can sure say something from the abundance of our heart our mouth can say something of God Amen something of what he's done in us something of what What the Lord Has revealed amen it doesn't have to be some great you know prepared message it it could be something simple it could be a simple testimony can be speaking to somebody and somebody can ask you amen amen well what what do you believe or how how is your faith or how do you see this or how do you see that we always must be ready to give an answer and Jesus said when he sent his disciples amen not what you to say for in that hour the father will put words in your mouth hallelujah amen will put words in your mouth to say that's right brother is that right you know he even commanded him commanded them not to do this right he told the disciples don't write a script amen amen M of course all things have a balance sure but the thing is what we're looking at is that we have to be instant in season and out of season amen so in order to do that we need to discern the seasons amen amen am that's what we want to speak of tonight Discerning the seasons Discerning the seasons amen amen I going know what seasons are amen amen maybe in Spanish you have to use two words but in English it's the same word see amen amen there's winter there's summer there's spring there's fall amen amen so the thing is these are seasons in the natural let us go to the book of ecclesiastics ecclesiastics chapter 3 Discerning the seasons amen ecclesiastics East Psalms Proverbs Chapter yesah verses one to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven amen amen to everything there is a season a station a time to every purpose under the heaven amen a time to be born a time to die time to plant a time to PL that which is planted A Time to Kill a time to heal a time to break down a time to build up a time to weep A Time To Laugh A Time to mourn a time to dance Hallelujah a time to Cast Away Stones a time to gather Stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to get a time to loose a time to keep and a Time to Cast Away a time to R and a time to sue a time to keep silence and a time to speak amen amen a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of Peace amen amen verse 11 he have made everything beautiful in his time amen also he have set the world in their heart so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end hallelujah amen notice here that God's time is eternal yes he makes everything beautiful in his time amen yes he does what times he is amen amen what clock do he go by what what's his time his time is eternity his time is his purpose his time is his plan his time is his box his Plan of Redemption amen because even after the full Redemption comes and we go back to Eternity we will still be in his time Hallelujah because we have been accomplished the purpose of the Redemption plan amen amen now just to speak a little bit there's some people because we're speaking about Discerning the season amen there's some people that never is the right time they never seem to do anything because they procrastinate they do why do people procrastinate because they don't realize that they don't have forever to accomplish what they are here on Earth to accomplish amen amen they don't realize that they don't have forever to accomplish what they need to accomplish Moses was one who was once a great procrastinator amen amen he he would delayed too much is that right Amen to act to move amen amen is that right amen and the same one that was a great procrastinator he said this in Psalms 912 Psalms 92 he said teach us to number our days all right that we May gain a heart of wisdom amen teach us to number our days all right that we may gain a heart of wisdom now once that Moses knew amen the time on Earth of his life was limited he finally got under the way to accomplish what purpose of being here at 80 years old amen amen at 80 years old he finally got into the purpose of God for his life amen that's a long time but brother said it's never too late that's right hallelu hallelujah it's never too late he said look at Abraham 65 years old about 60 years old he began to be called from the Lord what about all the other years in his life he was a pagan he was an idol worshiper amen but it wasn't until the late years of his life that God called them you see so we're not to put that as an excuse because God already called us now and brother bam said the greatest thing that I regret in my life amen is not having serve the Lord at a younger age right amen so the earlier the better yes sir you can do more for God Amen that's right amen you can go through experiences Amen to bring you into growth amen and get there at a younger age to where you already been through certain things that God has taught you you God has revealed to you you know the plan you know your call and you have the strength to finally do it because a lot of brother bam says that the scripture teaches us Amen in Proverbs that one has the strength right but doesn't have the wisdom another one has wisdom but he doesn't have the strength what if you have both that's why the the the younger you start the more wisdom you obtain at a younger age and you'll have the strength to accomplish you understand yes oh brother you know I'm going to wait hallelujah hallelujah then by the time you finally get to that place Moses finally fully surrendered to God and he met the pillar of fire yeah Hallelujah Hallelujah and brother bam said 5 minutes Moses in that presence changed his life he anointed his faith why Christ speak he anointed his faith and he send him out say the Lord hallelujah amen amen amen hallelujah hallelujah but notice on the other hand Amen on the other side of the spectrum there are those who think that any time is right see there's two sides to it exem there some that are procrastinators there's others that just think any time is right right now fine right there two extremes said there's a center of the road what are those who think any time is right that's caral mentality the other is just laziness and procrastination but these is is car on mind let's look at an example John St John real quick we're going to be reading some scriptures tonight hope like reading the Bible amen St John 7 verse one after these things Jesus walked in Galilee for he would not walk in jewry because the Jews sought to kill him now the Jews Feast of Tabernacle was at hand and his Brethren therefore said unto him depart hence and go into Judea that they disciples Also may see thy works that thou doest for there is no man that doeth anything in secret and he himself seeketh to be known openly for thou do these things show thyself to the world then Jesus said unto them my time is not yet come but your time is carnal flesh Brothers is always ready because verse five said neither did hisen believe in him who is he speaking of his flesh Brothers his own family did not believe in him but look what Jesus rebuked them my time is not yet come but your time is always ready amen amen so there's some that procrastinate and there's some that oh it's right now right now is the time right always right now right now time now but we got to discern the seasons Hallelujah am do you understand so notice that Jesus rebuked amen his flesh brothers because they did not deserve the season in which Jesus Jus was to go to Jerusalem Jesus knew as soon as I go into Jerusalem that's it amen amen amen amen so that's why he had to wait for the right time to walk into Jerusalem and the Bible says if if you read there he went in there secretly amen without nobody knowing see amen but his brothers wanted him to make a triumphant entrance hallelujah amen right here he is see but the thing is this wasn't the season for that there was a season when he did come in that way is that right but this wasn't the season amen and his Brethren weren't able to deserve the difference and this is something that we must learn as Believers and I hope God will help us tonight that we can receive some of these things into our hearts to help us understand and discern the seasons the mystery of God's time God's seasons are to be revealed to his bride how many believe that how many believe that God doesn't keep no secrets from his bride but he tells her this is what I'm going to do this is what I'm going to do next then after that I'm going do this then after that I'm going do this amen he doesn't keep no secrets from the Bride of Jesus Christ he Reveals His whole plan to her why so that she could know according to the conditions according to the signs this is a season in which he must do this and then be ready and an expectation for what he's going to do in that season amen you understand hallelujah hallelujah why brother you must understand that everything in the plan of God Is by season we read it right there Ecclesiastes 3 is that right for everything under Heaven There is a season amen so now notice who made the natural Seasons who made winter summer spring and and fall made the seon you go back to Genesis and you'll find he made the moon the stars for Seasons that what the Bible says amen who's the creat creator of seasons is God Amen so God himself for the spiritual work of his hands hallelujah hallelujah for his spiritual creation he has Seasons how many know that Amen brother Adam taught these things brother Adam taught there is a season for the resurrection and I got the quote right there I don't know if I'm going to be able to get to it because we got to understand the seasons amen have conditions yes let's look God's timing in your life can be discerned by determining what season you're in Hallelujah when you find out the season that you are in you can act accordingly you can act in preparation and you can act in expectation but if you don't know the season you don't know what to expect you don't know how to act you don't know how to approach God this is very important because this goes from a a body level from the bride local church to the individual believer to a minister to to our lives in Christ we must be able to deserve the seasons of God's time in our Liv because if we don't do that brother We'll be asking God to give us a spring when he wants us in Winter yeah hallelujah amen and we'll be oh how come there's no spring because it's not that season that's good brother amen hallelujah oh how come I got to sweat it out how come I got a to because it's summer good amen amen and you can't do things that easy is that right it's good brother let's give some examples just natural if it's winter and it's cold outside then is it time for you to to wear a coat the seasons by the conditions by what you feel by what you see amen amen you know you don't have to get down on your knees and say Lord should I wear a Coke today amen amen the season tells you to wear a CO to get you don't cover yourself it's cold right that's simple amen am so just just what you feel what you look the conditions brother ra talks about this I'm just giving you some notes that are written down the conditions the atmosphere reveals the season that's good brother look what brother says what he say in the message inside 1962 ourons theal denote that God is with us he's talking about this and that God is here why because He commands nature amen if you never received that life that little leaf would drop off tonight this little leaf that you are here on Earth you know whether you never rise again if you're not born again because you haven't received your insign in your heart the evidence the holy spirit that if you die you'll raise back up so brother bam said my first Bible was nature amen amen hallelujah hallelujah he saw God in nature he saw God in the trees he saw God in the wilderness he saw God in nature he even wrote him a letter and tacked it on a tree Hallelujah because he believed that God was out there somewhere I know he's here there has to be a Creator a Divine being that has set all these things in order Hallelujah Amen brother says a testimony of a true witness there's other witness that we can call and one of them of a witness of God because brother bam is bringing Witnesses in this message that testify of God and he says another witness is the tree in the fall of the year when the autumnn time the leaf amen begins to fall and notice if we are born again we are a leaf on the tree of life and this tree that we look out here on the woods when life finally leaves out of the leaf it's because the season is over for the leaf and the life of the leaf leaves and it will drop down into the ground and we're all sure of that from our windows we can look the the leaves they turn different colors because the life has come out of the out of the leaf right so you look at it you see the climate change changes the atmosphere changes amen what you're seeing changes the leaves Begin to Fall life is leaving amen why because something cold is coming brother said that's why Cried Out said Lord God hide me under the Rock Hallelujah huj until thy wrath pass that's a type amen of the believer that hides himself in Christ and the Wrath the winter the cold weather that kills everything passes over but the life of that leaf goes down into the roots hallelujah hallelujah stays down in there in in in in a hidden place in a secret place until the Wrath passes Hallelujah and then after the Wrath passes he comes back out amen God is in nature friends and I read the first quote we can know that God is with us because of the seasons now listen and he says and today that gives us a great testimony hallelujah hallelujah as a witness of God of creation because that when we are in the season of mortal life raising our children marrying bringing forth am this is a life or the season of mortal life we have been born above from above but the body returns to the dust of the Earth the spirit goes up to where it come from the body goes back to where it come from hallelujah hallelujah to God who gave it there who come then there will come another season and that season will be in inmortal season Hallelujah when the Son of God Rises with healing in his wings it will be totally impossible to hold those bodies in the ground any longer they'll come forth in the brightness of the Son of God the very nature itself testifies of that so if we are a Christian if we are born of the spirit death can hold nothing but victory for us because this old corruptible body that Satan still has power over will drop into the dust of the Earth this is the wrong season of immort of moral season Immortal season is coming when the immortal one comes the immortal Spirits has returned from the earth come forth again in the resurrection for a great Millennium and shall shine in his glory everything on Earth gives testimony the sun rises in the East it shows the beginning of Life in the evening it sets down in the morning the birds awake and they're singing and they're happy and they're real they feel fresh and in the evening we're tired like tonight somebody say Amen when the sun sets they gives testimony that there is life and death the day was born a day is gone amen a tree lives a leaf drops God preserves The Roots the original life goes and stays into the roots that made leaves for shame it comes back again where did it come from only to rest and come another season the Little Flower that drops out the sea returns back to the ground somewhere that we don't not know where then it comes back up and it comes back out in another season it's life burial and Resurrection everything speaks of God gives testimony amen I have had the privilege of traveling around the world I've seen different religions I've heard different views and I've heard the Mohamad and the Buddhas and the SS and the James many hundreds of different views of religions and gods and goddesses and all those things but there's none of them not one of them not one of them that got one Speck of truth about it this Christian religion is the right religion because it speaks of death burial and resurrection and all nature Even Heaven itself testifies of this truth God's witness to his people every day that there is death burial and Resurrection each season passes over our heads that we see through the season death burial and Resurrection we know that is the truth Christianity basically is the truth and it gives witness you believe that hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah glory to God now brother if you would just pull with me tonight then we can see how this really comes down into us how it really comes down into the bride amen amen hallelujah because it is important to understand that throughout all the Scriptures it is teaching this Paul said in Galatians 4 Christ came in due season amen he says in Romans he died for the sinners in due time hallelujah hallelujah everything that Christ did he did in the season that God had and brother bam taught us spiritual food in due season Hallelujah there is a season for all things remember we preach amen rain in its due season so all of these things are showing us that the natural types of spiritual is that right so these Seasons Amen in our lives show us and reveal to us in the natural the tree does not reach maturity listen close the tree does not reach maturity in one season it has to go through seasons in order to mature hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you understand so in the spiritual we cannot expect maturity if we're always uh kind of expecting just one season no we must understand that there is spiritual winter amen hallelujah amen amen is there spiritual winter amen we we've been preaching about it lately amen amen hallelujah hallelujah and then there's spring where there's abundance Hallelujah when everything is just perfect everything is nice the atmosphere is perfect amen amen everything flows amen but if we're always expecting spring when we begin to see fall we don't understand that that's a season that we must go through so we we have to get into that atmosphere amen amen what is the atmosphere I just mentioned it the life has to go down into the amen amen sometimes it's up here with the fruits amen amen oh showing the fruits on top of the tree amen amen by their fruits you shall know amen amen the fruits and the flowers blossoming amen amen but sometimes it's down in The Roots where no one sees but there's still life deep down they can look at the tree I said a much there doesn't look too pretty amen amen but Life The Roots said Jesus Cur the amen amen you know why he cursed because it was the season to give F and it wasn't giving hallelujah amen amen I had a little lemon tree at our house a lot of brothers know stay like that for I don't know how many years right remember that one we pled itay little flowers now I think brother has it at their house happens there amen hallelujah but the thing is seasons and Seasons went by and the tree never grew how many know about bamboo studed about amen amen if you study bamboo when the they plant bamboo in the ground seed the one that SWS it the one that keeps it down there and plants it in the ground he has to fully trust amen amen upon God's power I mean they don't look at it that way but they already know because it shows no signs it could pass months how know like like bean sprouts or different ones when you know when you plant something within a few days amen you already see the little right the little the little thing coming out you see results quick right not with bamboo you got to wait wait and wait you don't see nothing this is powerful there's one thing about bamboo though in the moment the season that comes out of the ground within I believe a day or a couple days it grows eight fet amen amen so that's the thing sometimes amen it looks like nothing's happening hallelujah hallelujah but deep down in there something is taking place that it can grow quickly and quicker than others that show life more quicker it you understand Hallelujah so all in nature brother is speaking of God's spiritual work in his body amen amen now listen let us turn I don't let us go to Acts chapter one hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord verse seven and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father haveth put in his own power amen amen so now look this is the disciples asking Jesus will you restore the kingdom to Israel at this time brother I preached on this before brother mentions it how many how many know why they asked him that because the Jews were expecting that when the Messiah come he was going to come like he's going to come in his third coming amen hallelujah in his first coming they were waiting for him like he's going to come in his third coming not even his second oh no no they were waiting for the third coming hallelujah hallelujah yeah they were waiting for the kingdom of the Throne of the son of David Amen to be established Amen to come and Rule and Reign and push out the the Romans that's what the Jews were expecting amen they weren't able to deserve the season where Adam said they were waiting for Jesus to come to the temple amen hallelujah am and come down a great came from Glory with a crown on his head and great armies following him you see because that's how he's going to come in his third coming the thing is they weren't able to deserve the season hallelujah hallelujah and then even the disciples that had walked with Jesus for three years and a half they heard all his teaching they heard all his preaching they seen all the Miracles and then he dies he resurrects he speaks to them and now he's he's talking to them about going to Jerusalem to receive the holy power of God and they're worried about when are you going to restore the kingdom he said it's not for you to know the times and the season that God has put in his own power Hallelujah but go to the city of Jerusalem you shall receive power from on high you see brother to know the seasons and the time was going to be for a special people hallelujah to know the times and the season it was going to be for special people let's go to Matthew 24 verse 36 hallelujah hallelujah but of that day and hour no man know no man know not the angels of heaven but my father only you see he said of to you it is not given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of what the father has put in his own power there this right here is speaking of the seven seal amen amen how many you know Jesus preached the seven SE hallelujah amen amen how many listener read The Sixth Seal amen he preached Jesus preached the Seven Seals amen and when he got to the seven he omitted it glory to God he said it is not known not even the angels in heaven only my father amenu what did he tell the disciples it's not given to you to know amen these things but only my Father in Heaven whom has the power is that right oh Glory let's go to first Thessalonians then I'm going to read some quotes where you can see brother Bram mention these things to let us know about the season first Thessalonians 5 verse one but of the times and the seasons Brethren you have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night amen now this scripture I want you to listen close is a continuity first Thessalonians 4 amen amen verse 15 verse 16 and verse 17 Paul didn't write chapters and verses he wrote letters theologians put in verses and chapters amen he's writing a letter you understand it's continuity for the day of the Lord cometh the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with the Shout with the voice of Archangel with the Trump of God CH shall rise you see then he says but of the times and the seasons Brethren you have no need for me to ride oh that's powerful I don't know if you're catching it but that's powerful hallelujah it's powerful yeah if we fail to discern the season in our Liv will end up amen like many through the church ages like the Pentecostal church not able to to deserve the the the season in which the word is to be fulfilled for that hour and they're still wound up Amen in their own idea and their own condition and their own things and they're not able to discern the season has changed amen hallelujah hallelujah that's why Paul is saying here this day is coming Hallelujah the Lord himself is going to descend with a shout a message to prepare the voice of the resurrection and then top of God hallelujah hallelujah the dead in Christ shall rise first but of these times and these Seasons I'm not supposed to rise you don't have need to know the season Jesus told the disciples the same thing why because it wasn't to be revealed for that time hallelujah hallelujah but in the day Hallelujah Hallelujah from the Lord himself would come down he would make known the seasons and the times why because we have need for it now Hallelujah now we have need to understand the seasons and the times that's why the only one out of all the messengers that can preach about the church Ages was the last message because it was needful for us to know that there had been dispensations that there had been ages that there were Seasons that the church went through there was there was a time when the church went forth amen with power and then it died away and and the seed went in the ground is that right 6 Millions went into the ground during the Dark Ages and then they begin to come back up with Luther with Wesley he taught us season times amen and he even set time from this year to this year from this year to this year why did he do that did you know that some of those Messengers didn't even live in those years study it how in the world would brother R put those age those times and then put the messenger for that age hallelujah hallelujah because he brother was teaching us seasons time amen he was letting us know what the disciples wanted to know he wanted to know what that first church over there Ephesus wanted to know what Paul said of the times and the seasons there's no need that I write unto you because you're going in the grave you're going down hallelujah hallelujah but when this takes place there will be a people on the Earth that will know what season they're in hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah brother there's many examples in the scripture that fail to recognize the season like zaras in Luke chap 1 you don't have to go there but in verse 20 the angel Gabriel tells him you'll be deaf and dumb because you have disbelieved this word brother Adam said Zacharias had many scriptural examples that he as a priest should have known it was possible for God to do that he had Abraham and Sarah he had Hannah in the Bible he had uh uh uh Samson's parents they were old also amen and he being a priest should have known those scpt and brother says but the same Angel vised Mary and told her something that Wasing in the scripture oh my and she didn't doubt Hallelujah she said be it unto me in other words there wasn't an example of that ever having been done before tell me what virsion had conceived before that but she said be it unto me according to th word Hallelujah but because Zarah disbel in the promise of the word of the mighty angel that come down from heaven to give him a message glory to godu he said you'll be de and d and the scripture says until the seasons are accomplished amen amen amen even Gabriel spoke about season amen amenas see sometimes it don't sound the same in Spanish season the season amen now look these things is for a purpose for a Cause amen God matures by season is that right now look brother there are seasons in our lives that after Satan TS us he departs for a season yeah Luke 4: 13 after Satan tempted Jesus for 40 days the Bible says then the devil departed for a season yeah amen amen am for a station for a season of time yeah that's what I want you to understand The Seasons natural spiritual natural spiritual amen and then if you read Revelations 20 when the angel comes down binds the devil for a thousand years and then the Bible says brother talks about it questions and anwers is to be loose for a season it doesn't say much time it doesn't even give time it gives a time of a thousand years and then there's a season that is not eternity yet but it ain't the Millennium there's this little season where he's let loose hallelujah hallelujah look at these things in your life I mentioned it on Sunday brother said God will allow and he'll loose the devil in the church to see what you're going to do about yes amen yes the scriptures right there but brother bam was talking about here spiritually he loes the devil you know why he loses him Hallelujah am when he loses him in Revelations 20 There's a Great War we read in Ecclesiastes there's a time of War a time of Peace the time of Peace was a millennium the time of war is go and you understand but sometimes it's time of war and people don't realize that it's time to fight hallelujah it's time to get your sword and start fighting Hallelujah but that's when people that don't discern the season that the local church is going through am or the individual believer is going through or the bride in general is going through when you don't deserve the season you don't know what to do you don't know if to wear a coat or not wear a coat yeah that's good brother amen you don't know if to if it's time to pull out your sword or time to pray or if it's greatest battle ever fought or is it shalom shalom what is it Hallelujah is it the greatest battle ever fought or is it Shalom unto the bride of Christ which is it am you see there's a season for everything we have to understand that we're in a time of War brother Bram said amen it's a time to stand in this hour because the secret catching away of the Lord is at hand and he read the same scripture that we just read first Thessalonians and he said this is my text but you know how brother R read it just like we read we read first Thessalonians 5 and then he went back to first Thessalonians 4 just like we read tonight that's how he read the sudden secret going away of the church and then he reads this he says I want to take my text the subject the secret catching away sudden catching away of the church he reads the scriptures and then he says if you wish to look across the page it is so geographically arranged in your Bible to the 16th 17th and 18th verse of the verses of the fourth chapter of first Thessalonians for the Lord himself and then he reads then he said may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his holy word this is unusual thing to speak of the subject like this but that I come down to minister to the sick there's a greater sickness Than Physical sickness and it's much more essential then we be well for this great event that is fixing to take place than it would ever be even if we fall asleep in the Lord if we die before it happens it is much more better to be healed and whole be ready I'd rather be a sick man physically and ready for the L coming of the Lord then to be a a healed man and not ready to go with the Lord hallelujah amen amen hallelujah hallelujah I know you're tired but I'm going to finish quick if you help me wow amen amen I'd rather be a sick man than to be a a well man and not go with the Lord but however it be God is so willing that he we both be well and ready soul and body for he forgives our iniquities and he heals our sins he died for a compound purpose and I'm thinking of this subject the sudden and secret people live today as though just before the coming of the Lord that he was going to send a host of angels and down into all the newspapers and he was going to give us a year announcement in advance that he's coming on a such and such a J Jesus will arrive and broadcast it on the radio and put it on the television and everywhere just the day and just the hour that he's coming that's the way people live today in other words they're ready they're waiting for somebody to say brother you know it's this time is that time but he says the church must know the SE am hallelujah hallelujah Billy Billy Paul had the dream Billy and he said we're living in the morning we're leaving in the morning amen and Billy Paul told him daddy no one knows the day or nor the hour he says I didn't say the day or the hour I said we're living in the morning it's the season we have to know the season by what by the conditions by the atmosphere that must be created in order for those things to be there did you imagine the biblical days the Son of God passing through Hallelujah he would come to this notable place called betesda in the Hebrew Tong had five porches and a sheep it was a sheep market and there was a great phenomen of that day the people believed that there was an angel capital A that would come down out of Heaven A Certain season hallelujah amen let us turn in our Bible hallelujah hallelujah St John 5 oh St John 5 verse 4 and the scripture says for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and troubled the water whosoever then first after troubling of the water Ste and was made whole of whosoever disease he had amen amen season the angel would come down at a certain season now brother Bram said I'd rather be healed and made whole for the coming of the Lord for the Rapture spiritually and to be healed naturally and not go see it's Seasons he would come down Seasons this is the message Church of the Living God to trouble the water and this pool is where they would wash the Sheep was just around the pool the size of this building perhaps certain Seasons the the water become chopped and it had been said by someone that there was an angel which would do this chopping of the water the troubling of the water to some people it was only a Superstition it was not written in the scriptures that God was going to do anything anything like that so many people would not believe it but many people they believed it it was truth because it produced results the first person stepping into the water being with some ailment with faith the virtue of the water the angel the phenomena of it which people Tau was just the wind going around the wall a certain way the current would be flowing through the water it would make the choppy water but the strange thing is that when a person had faith and stepped into the pool amen The Chopping would cease and the person would get well of whatsoever disease they had see but they could see the results they could see the results so they believe that God has sent an angel down hallelujah hallelujah now as it is written in the scripture we believe that it was an angel we Christian people because the Bible said it was an angel amen this new testament wasn't written they just walk by Steps of Faith like we do today in another age Steps of Faith but when our Master come by it was God's provided way for Healing The Sick body God has Seasons he has provision for each season and he made for that certain generation when Charles finny to my way of thinking was one of the greatest ministers since St Paul he claimed to have one million souls to Christ Dwight moody in his day Charles finny was a lawyer educated man he was God's message to the world in his day educated man who got hundreds of lawyers together and read his biography all the people who read those things religious books it's a masterpiece then Along Came dght Moody which is a very illiterate unlearned man his grammar was very poor but he was God's message for that age in each age God has a message so there's Seasons Hallelujah in which God deals with the generation in a certain way Hallelujah huj and he use the example of this Ang coming down stirring the waters God send an angel down out of Heaven to come and stir the water in a certain season that whoever would go in there they would be made whole Hallelujah AMJ oh brother how tremendous it is today that the angel of the Lord the Lord himself has descended from Heaven to S the waters of the word to make a body whole in the ready for the Rapture Ready for the secret suddening going away Hallelujah but that Hess amen it's not all together just healing in the body but it's something spiritual it's being made whole being made ready for the coming of the Lord that's what this angel come down to do in this hour in this season he come out of Heaven to stir the water of the word to make us whole to make us ready for the coming of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord and the word there that is used make whole in the Greek is hug amen means a metaphor which means amen a teaching which does not deviate from the truth the very word that is used in St John 54 the person were made whole of whatsoever disease they had what does that mean that they were going to receive a teaching which does not deviate from the truth amen amen it's not Tate from the truth Psalms 104 Psalms 104 verse 14 verse 19 he appointed the moon for Seasons yes the sun knoweth his going downlu the son knoweth his going down amen he descends but he knows when the ministry of the son goes down the moon is made for Seasons amen hallelujah because from the beginning God said I'm make two those main star one give by day and the other to rule by Night the Moon made for Seasons the BR is made for season Hallelujah am know when it was going to go

know it's going down and the bride knows that she is appointed for Seasons she is appointed for season stand on your feet tonight all that God can do for you did it in Jesus Christ your work of redemption for your soul and body is completed even to your rapture is already complete amen hallelujah when Jesus rose from the dead God justifies justifies Us by faith believing that God Rose him from the dead we are waiting for the Rapture which will come but everything will happen in it SE amen everything will happen in It season the elect of God seen it in Noah's time and Moses Inus pcal because that was the seed that was on the Earth when this inspiration was being poured out while the inspiration poured out today to gather the bride together it's only those who are elected will see it now inspiration has to strike and we are not living in Luther's age pcal but we are living in the evening time in the time of the calling out of the Bride just as it was hard for the Catholics to see Luther for the Luthers to see wle for the Wesley to see PC so is it hard for the Pentecostals to see this age amen I say so it is hard for people in the message to realize what season we're in it's always been that way because it's poured upon an elected seed and that only amen amen the Bible teaches that they can't see it Jesus even prayed for them they was blind and they didn't know it but Revelation tells us this Lan age when he was put out of the church naked miserable blind don't know it can't understand it they're creeped up in Traditions but remember the promised word of God by the mouth of Jesus Christ the very God that spoke creation and to existence he was the one before the foundation of the world that spoke the word Let There Be and there was for he was in the world and the world was made by him the world knew him not but as many as did know him to them gave the power to become sons of God the very Creator the the very Creator himself when he raised up Lazarus from the dead he said think this not strange for the hour is coming when all that is in the grave will hear the voice of the son of man and shall come out Hallelujah the very God that said that let there be life said the voice of the son of man would wait those that are in the grave it has to happen in it SE am I guess we're tired tonight but if the musician would come
