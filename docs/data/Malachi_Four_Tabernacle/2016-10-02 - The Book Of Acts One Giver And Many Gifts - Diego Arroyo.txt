there's one spirit that he works through the whole body in us and through us remember remember Friday amen verse seven says but unto everyone of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of [Music] Christ there's measurements that God gives in the Book of Romans Paul said God has dealt unto each one a Measure of Faith amen amen hallelujah amen a certain Measure of Faith amen and we all have been given a certain measure amen wherefor he saith when he ascended up on high he left captivity captive and gave gifts unto men we understand this verse the seventh angel brother Bram the prophet has opened up this the scriptures to the spirit of Truth when it says he led captivity captive amen when he ascended on high B said that's when he took the Old Testament Saints out of the sh amen amen in which Samuel was when the witch of Endor called him back in which Abraham was in which when Lazarus died in the parable was taken to Abraham's bosom amen the Old Testament Saints they were in this place there was not a sixth Dimension yet like there is now amen amen amen we have preached that before the prophet revealed that so he led captivity captive Jesus rose amen from the dead amen he took the Testament Saints with him up into [Music] heavens and now notice he said now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first to the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all Heavens that he might F all things amen amen but did he stay up there see the Corporal body went to stay at the right hand of God but he's sitting back amen the pillar of fire Jesus said I have come from God and I am now in the world St John [Music] 16:28 again I'll leave the world and I'll go back to the father brother bam said after Jesus death Buri and resurrection and Ascension he met Saul on the road to Damascus amen the pillar of fire and the pillar of fire said I am Jesus amen hallelujah so he returned in the form of the angel of God the one that Moses followed in the wilderness amen who did he follow the angel of God who did he follow the pillar of Fire the Holy Spirit Christ then he says that he gave some he God gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of of the body of Christ each one is given a measure each one is given a certain part in the body but it has a purpose it has a purpose verse 12 and 13 is the purpose for the the perfecting of the [Music] Saints amen amen for the work of the ministry for the edifying the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith amen and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man yes unto what the measure measure amen of the stature of the fullness of Christ [Music] we all have been been dealt a measure but that is for a purpose so that we all reach the full measure amen heavenly father bless your word Lord God may your spirit lead us father God may your word flow with Liberty take away Lord every fear every doubt your spirit oh God Quicken your word to our hearts name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and as you're sitting taking your seat let us go to the Book of James the Book of James chapter one hallelujah hallelujah the Book of James chapter 1 and most of us know that we have been on this subject this theme we've been looking at this picture two three months now of the restoration of God through the ministry of the seventh angel according to Matthew 17 according to Acts chapter 3 the restitution of all things was supposed to be done before the Corporal body of Jesus Christ receives his bride in the air Acts chapter 3 says that the heavens must retain Jesus until the restitution of all things in other words when the restitution of all things happens then Heavens cannot retain him no more he can come down for his bride he came first to Die For His Bride Comes This Time for his bride then he comes with his bride so when we're think when we're looking at this this this book of Acts been very very beautiful showing us what the book of Acts means to us today because brother Bram said in the revelation of Jesus Christ Christ in the true church is the continuation of the book of Acts amenu also said many messages Christ is the mystery of God revealed in the seals he said it all through the message Jesus said in St John 15 I am the vine and you are the branches right and brother bam preached the restoration of the Bride tree that tree that he planted on the day of P wrote a book of Acts but that tree As We Know by the prophet was also cut down by the Roman Spirit the Roman system the Antichrist Spirit came into the church amen and it came down to a stump but he said in Jo chapter 2 I will restore say the Lord Brother preached the restoration of the Bride tree restore the covering the doctrine amen the fellowship the Clapping of the leaves the the fruits of the spirit Joy long suffering patience meekness amen restoring all of this back until we come to the to the to the final part of the restoration but what a lot of people don't understand and the prophet laid it out for us so that we wouldn't miss it is that the Pentecostal denomination or the people who started the Pentecostal denomination before the Revival began tells us in the resume uh uh the resume of the church ages that they knew by the scriptures there had there had to come a restoration and brother man calls it a final quickening for the Rapture and he said and they began to pray they begin to seek God for this final quickening and he said and what they thought was that came an anointing came and they began to speak in tongues they begin to operate in the spirit but brother bam said that was not listen close what the prophet laid out for us the restoration of the Bride tree said the same same thing he he said the same thing in many messages that was not the promise restoration that was not what the scriptures were in other words that wasn't the Fulfillment of Joel chapter 2 I will restore say the Lord that was not the Fulfillment of that because brother bam said order for it to come back in the full restoration of what the church was in Pentecost first the son of man Ministry has to come and reveal itself through the ministry of a prophet and laid out the doctrine of the word you see because brother what they thought was the restoration still to this day 2016 the Pentecostal denomination or the charismatic movement thinks they are fulfilling what Peter did and what Paul did and what Philip did and what happened in the in the upper room they're not fulfilling it I'm sorry but they're not fulfilling because if they fail in one part of it they fell in the whole thing they didn't have women preachers in the book of Acts they didn't have false gifts in the book of Acts they didn't have false teaching in the book of Acts brother they had straight direct Revelation from God why because the son of man Jesus Christ had laid out the word for them amen and they knew what they were believing in brother they they weren't going by emotions they weren't going by whatever thing everything has to follow the word and the continuity of the spirit we have been we have already spoke some prior Services two or three of the continuation how God is in the continuation of his program his program doesn't stop it's just interrupted and paused for a little bit but it continues with different people different scriptures being fulfilled but it's all one picture it's all one program understand that so brother bam tells us they didn't fulfill that restoration amen he says because they were so blind to see there was a lot of people he said participating in spiritual blessings and full of devu is that possible I have a demon in me and still receive and participate in spiritual blessings of the Holy Spirit yes amen and what shows us something now listen to me close what shows us that they didn't receive all of the gifts being restored to them his brother bam says one of the gifts is wisdom right we're going to get to that in a little B we're still trying to read James chapter 1 but brother bam said wisdom is a gift that is to be restored in the last days to the church in the Book of Revelation it says to him that has wisdom let them read the number of the Beast because it's the number of a man brother says see that scripture in Revelation that scripture is being directed to someone in the body of Christ that in the time of the restoration gifts were going to be fully restored what they had First Corinthians 12 it was going to be restored back into this restored church over here understand there's Gifts of wisdom there gift of faith there gift of Prophecy but brother said the gift of wisdom is wisdom to know the word amen so everybody says well the Pentecostals there were just the restoration of the gifts all the gifts were restored you know 50 years ago 60 100 years ago with with the Pentecost Street it was just the restoration of the don't take that light look at what the prophet said and he said it was not full restoration because if they would have had wish if the gift of wisdom would have been restored back there that gift of wisdom through the spirit would have said you women can't preach would have said in the service there can only be two or three amen prophesying and according to their course did that happen they had a bunch of stuff all over the place because the spirit the gift of wisdom had not been given you understand what I'm saying so just because some gifts were restored like tongues and interpretation and Faith and Healing langu interpretation Faith heal certain things like that was restored back there does it mean that they fulfilled the full restoration because the prophet tells us again I'm repeating again to get that deep into your heart let it settled in there that could not come until first God sent a prophet messenger amen bring the word tie in all the Loose Ends if the gift of wisdom would have been back there we're baptizing wrong in Jesus name that's wrong father son Holy Ghost it's wrong it's not just Jesus name there's many Jesus we have one in our church amen hallelujah you can't just baptize in the name of Jesus there's a lot of Jesus but the gift of wisdom set the thing in order Lord Jesus Christ father son holy spirit amen am this is this is what we have received we have received the ministry of a prophet to introduce us to the word pointing to the Messiah like we spoke Friday and then he stepped into the office of revealing what he was pointing to Amen to the and then after the ministry of Jesus when that Ministry was taken up left the scene amen then what was in him was divided among the body and that's the book of Acts so today I'm giving you my introduction today that's what we're going to speak on Friday we looked at Friday we looked at the book of Acts because brother bam said Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts everyone say Amen brother and I said this Friday I said we unconsciously interpret what the prophet said because that's how our mind thinks that's tradition when tradition refers to the book of Acts all you have in your mind is miracles signs wonders but but we showed Friday that the book of Acts not a chapter of the book not one verse of the book the book of Acts is what is in continuation today in other words not just chapter two just chapter three oh the book of Acts is not only signs and miracles and and shouting no no the book of Acts an the angel of the Lord coming to Peter and saying go here amen the book of Acts shows us jealousy amongst the church amen amen the Greek women said look at the apost churching that's in the book of that they think they're so the church is treating Widow that's amen there was a problem in the Church of read the Bible if we're talking about the book of Acts I would suggest for us to read amen amen and when you read that in the Bible Bible says the apostles came said okay there's a problem but you know what they said they said it's not our business the preachers are saying is not their business that's what the Bible says it's not our business to leave praying the ministry of the word to attend to issues choose among yourselves seven Men full of the Holy Ghost to attend to these things and we will dedicate ourselves to praying and the ministry of the word God and the Bible says in the book of Acts the word of God increased in those days in other words the word that they had received the Revelation was getting more and more and more isn't that what we're seeing today isn't that what we're seeing that the message that we have received spirit is not bringing another message it's not giving a different thing it's a continuation God dealt with Abraham right he called Abraham is that right but when Abraham left amen amen and the Bible says and Isaac was led by God to go back into the wells that his father had but after his father died the philes had come and they had covered all these Wells with dirt stuffed them all up Isaac let other spirit said this is where the well was let's dig it up again hallelujah hallelujah that the water start flowing again what does that tell you that God sent us a prophet but after he left amen demonic spirits cover up certain parts of the well of the word so that the word won't flow into the people and have its effect but there's got to be somebody let the spirit to find those places and dig in there dig into the word dig into the word amen and the water starts flowing is it something different no it's the same thing when died stop he met Jacob out there in the desert he wrest with this Mighty Angel he changed his name and he changed his walk hallelujah hallelujah amen he met God face to face and he said this is p I'll call this place pel means the of God we seen the of God CL and show his face amen but you got to meet him not looking at him in the picture you got to meet that person amen but God didn't stop there with Jacob amen he came to Moses is that right it wasn't a different message it wasn't a different program wasn't in a different Spirit it was the same word continuing on and on and on and he came to Moses he said I am the god of Abraham Isaac and of Jacob but now I'm your God to Hallelujah Hallelujah I wasn't just Abraham's God I was Isaac's God too I wasn't just Isaac's God I was Jacob's God too [Applause] amen I wasn't just Jacob's God I'm your God is that right and the and the prophecies continued and the word continued amen and then when God was going to take Moses he said now you Joshua you take this word and you keep going Hallelujah is that right and then when Moses died and when Joshua died we had all kinds of people I believe I believe brother told us in the message the absolute it was a time where everyone did what they thought was right in their but we need an absolute amen God continues friends then he called Samuel since a child heard the voice of God well we need to wait until the children grow brother they need to grow to have experience or it's your accountability it's your duty to train them in the Lord to take them like Anna and dedicate them to God not just in one service here Lord no that's a continual thing brother bam said lift your children before God In Prayer amen amen [Music] instu put them in service do let them do something like Samuel little boy serving there amen since a child serving in then he heard the voice of God that means that that means Joshua right here can hear the voice [Music] of we say it all the time Jesus Christ yesterday our con the way we look at reality is not that way amen those things come strange to us what no no no you know teenager yeah I can after he has smoked some weed drunk some beer scho a couple times then I can believe God something that's not that's not the Bible although that is the case also the scripture can identify children children teenagers like Mary 16 years old also heard the voice of the same Angel amen hallelujah young mened Allelujah heard fathers heard it mothers heard it amen amen so brother and sister what I'm saying is when we look at the continuation we find what God is doing right now when we find what he's doing now we we see it in the word we can say this is being fulfilled this day this is the word this is God in action his own word so let us read James 1 verse 17 every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of Lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning James 17 amen amen we read in Ephesians the same one that descended also ascended on high as he ascended on high he sent back the holy amen but this is what we got to understand let me read a port of the Prophet here because we're we're in the continuation of the book of Acts amen we looking at that but our inspiration our subject today is one giver and many gifts one Giver many gifts and these many gifts like we already said has been given a measure of that one Spirit to bring the unity of the Faith to bring all of us unto the fullness is that what we read in the Bible I'm not making this up this is the message am now watch this in the message The Works that I bear The Works that I do bear witness of me it's like the title of brother B's message 1951 he says so friends find Divine love and favor with God if he finds favor with you will give his gifts into you but first find The Giver in other words people think that if we're going to start preaching about gifts if we're going to start talking about the body and the many gifts that are in the body and God restoring that back then they think in their carnal mind that we're trying to make people do certain things just because we're preaching and that's not what we're saying we're showing you the the message and its purpose and what it's supposed to do in US is supposed to make us like that first church over there amen and that first church over there had all nine gifts that church over there just had pastors maybe one Prophet or two maybe one evangelist here one a fivefold Ministry see and in the book of Acts let me lay this out right here before it goes away in the book of Acts we read it uh we read it Friday remember in Acts three they that's Peter spoke the word he didn't have to cry he spoke and that's when all hell broke loose remember what we said Friday and we read the quote showing you that all the attraction was in the son of man that was the attraction and all the demons had their guns pointed at the son of man when the son of man come to gadar amen the demon Scream the demons and said oh th Son of God why Thou come before time to torment Us in other words all of them demons knew see but he wasn't the only one there Peter was with him John was with him the disciples were with him but show me in the scripture One Time Peter was thrown into prison when Jesus was alive show me one time Peter getting beat amen and persecuted when Jesus was alive no because the attention was on Jesus the demons wanted to kill Jesus amen the demons were after Jesus amen but when he left amen all of those guns that were pointing to Jesus said he left so who's left when Saul amen was persec in the church binding the church locking them up in prison amen the pillar of fire met him and said why you were persecuting me he didn't say why are you persecuting my church he didn't say why you persecuting the brother over there and the brother over here Jesus said through the pillar of fire why you persecuting me because I am in my body persecute them me is that right Amen brother and sister this is a continuation have we received the John the Baptist ministry have we received the son of man Ministry did he come to lay out the word establish and restore all things amen but notice this brother says don't start seeking for gifts I'll do this brother B said the Pentecostal Church failed miserably I make you a prophet I anoint this brother here with the gift of I said where is that in the scripture where is that in the Bible show me where Peter did that where Paul did that where James did that Paul told Timothy the elders laid hands on you Timothy when theyned ordination laying on of hands is not that we are ordaining him he say God has to call him God has to ordain him and he is already that in the mind of God nobody has made something be amen that's where the church because you had people trying to be something and do something that they called to do amen and because of that way they went then they got to interpret the scriptures a different way so don't seek gifts look for the SE The Giver amen then the gifts will come as God sees fit to give it to you he said do you believe that we pass over those things these great words that we learn and things that we do with gifts and everything that's fine but you better get the giver before you start after the gifts amen get the Holy Ghost oh brother but I want to know about this I want to understand more get the Holy Ghost he'll make you understand amen St John 16 the spirit of truth will teach you and brother mam said in the church ages it's the inside teacher amen hallelujah hallelujah that will teach us all things and it will remind us now watch brother says in the message gifts and callings are without repentance a man is just a man until he's fully submitted to God holy spiritu not the man but God in the man does the work now listen to this so Jesus when he come he was a man born of a virgin his mother was married his father was Jehovah God you believe that in that body God dwelt God was hidden Christ reconciling the world to himself Jesus said it's not me that do the works it's my father that dwelt in he does the work and that was God speaking through mortal lips that could raise the death steal the waters and so forth then he ascended on high and he gave gifts to men one man received a great gift of healing so the people that laid in his shadow brother bam tell us we don't need Peter or his shadow we need the God that was in us he says and then in the same he gave one another one and they taken a chest from his body and aprons and laid them upon the sick and every e and evil spirits went out of the people not because it was St Paul he was a man who lived in flesh like you and I and he died and he had to be Redeemed by the blood of Christ just like we do I'm quoting the prophet it wasn't the man that done the healing it was the spirit of God in the man that done the healing to the faith of the people is that right but the same holy spirit with us today amen Jesus said I'll be with you to you to the end of the world hallelujah amen believe that now watch this 1951 as I was with Moses he says when Jesus of Nazareth I believe the father was in him all that great things that the father that was the fathers was given unto his son all the great blessings and gifts for he was just the express image of the father and in him in Jesus dwelt all the riches of God dwelling in him he said I am my father one and my father dwelleth in me amen amen it's not me that does the works it's the father that dwelleth in me he does the works that's what Jesus said listen to this and he Jesus had all those fine gifts at his command amen but when Satan found him in the wilderness he didn't use those gift Satan said if thou be the Son of God change the stones to bread turn them into bread and eat you're hungry he said it is written amen use the word right now what watch faith without works is dead and listen this is the initial this is 1953 you know that the word of God will defeat Satan anywhere any time on any condition is that right when Jesus was here on Earth all the great gifts that was in heaven he had them right with with him amen now I'm trying to show you something I'm not making this up brother V is showing us that when the fullness of God was in Jesus are you listening what was that that was the revealing of the son of man in the ministry of Jesus Christ from Jord to the resurrection is the ministry of the son of man that is the fullness of God in one man Hallelujah you understand Hallelujah okay everyone got that look when that fullness was in Jesus all the great gift amen amen what did we read in James what do we read in James what do we read in James James what do we read James 117 every good gift and perfect gift amen that word that's used perfect is mature gift it's from above and cometh down all of these gifts come down from the father ofs amen where all those gifts come from from the father amen all those gifts that were in the father he poured everything into the son is that right listen to me so when Jesus was here on the Earth was the gift of faith in him amen was the gift of wisdom in him amen hallelujah was was was the gift of healing in him amen hello somebody was the calling of a deacon in him mother said when he took the ropes amen am and saw what was happening in the temple and he kicked everybody out brother said questions and answers we all know the but I'm trying to get you to look at a picture here not justs look at the at the image of what we're looking at amen amen amen this is the word that we're talking here amen amen it's hard in this age of Le people to see certain things amen amen AMU now watch in Jesus was when he kicked everybody El brother said Jesus was a treasur some might say well I'm just a treasur remember that was in Jesus too when he told Peter they said we need to pay our taxes right he said go under that find a was Jesus as a treasure Jesus as a pastor come unto me all you that are burdened and heavy La now give you rest The Shepherd of the sheep fold amen hallelujah hallelujah Paul in the book of Hebrews said the chief apost Jesus Christ amen hallelujah you know what Apostle means people get scared with that word because it's been misrepresented just like the Pentecostals misrepresented tongues which is a gift and you talk to a Baptist about tongues and say oh the same thing in the message because they have used the gift wrong people were now are afraid of it Apostle means one that is s amen who was the first one that amen he sent his son he's the chief sent one amen was he sent was he sent with the mission was he the First [Music] Missionary yes sir he had a mission and he completed the mission did he establish a church he said Upon This Rock I'll build my church he was a pastor he was an apostle amen he was a preacher you understand did he had gifts of [Music] healing did some woman just touch him and she got healed that same Spirit was inet when he walk and his shadow would come over people they get healed amen because all of those gifts when he left were divided you understand everything that was in him all of the gifts all of the Ministries I just read it to you were in himu so he ascended all that was in him poured into the church AMJ but he didn't make just one person with all of that in that no he divided he made one a deacon Hallelujah when it was time for it when little problems started to happen amen the holy spirit rose up and the Apostle said okay now choose among yourselves right Amen brother these things is showing us that today in this continuation of the book of Acts we are in the same amen because we have received the ministry of Amen let me show you something to show that that fullness was again revealing itself through the ministry of William BR he said when he preached Mar divorce this is only for my FL amenu he said Elijah was the pastor of the whole nation even of Jezebel yes amen did that fullness that was revealed to William B did it reflect all of the gifts like it did in Jesus Christ think about this now was there healing in his ministry was there wisdom in his ministry is that right did he do the part of a pastor Amen brother Bosworth when he was dying how many remember the testimony brother tells it he said brother brother you're a true apost of God that's in the message brother Bosworth told Brother BR said bill you go out into the field before all of these false go you get there first [Music] hallelujah amen amen and he actually established the church amen amen amen amen Amen brother sister the Holy Spirit come back to reveal that fullness in that [Music] fullness that little girl he talks about up in Sweden some European country say she came up to me didn't know my language smile tear I'm that after that Ministry is off to according to the message that is to be loosed amongst many members it not all [Music] be all be in or but each one is given a measure each one is given a calling you understand me let me read another quote so far I've read about four or five quotes one one two three here's another one four I read this one when Jesus was here on Earth all the great gifts that was in heaven God's great gifts always find their places 1963 he says all right anointed him with mer we find out now in in John 121 and seven and that's exactly what he done listen to talking about Jesus he was the perfect servant of God and had him Anointed with all of his Divine gifts God anointed Jesus with all his Divine GI he was anointed with all of God's gifts because he was Goden Hallelujah now when all of the when that anointing of all of the gifts come to anoint William brand it was to reveal that same God not that he was God was to reveal to us that that same God was here to fulfill his word you understand that amen now let me show I've taken about hour already and I finally laid something out you see Hallelujah you see that after the ministry of the son of man went up what was in him was divided in many gifts but it was all all in one Giver at one time the father and Heaven all that was in God he poured into Christ amen every good and perfect gift comes down from the father of light and it came down from the father of light in Jesus in him but when he went up Hallelujah all that was in him was divided into the body of many members a portion a measure in this one a measure in this one another measure in this one and that one but what's the purpose of that it's for the working of the ministry until we all come into the stature of the per of the perfect man the so if all of those gifts were restored to the Pentecostal denomination they would have came out with Christians in the St of a they would have came out with a thousand William brandom and said this is the evidence this is the sons of our Revelation that all the gifts are in their place this is the product men and women in the St of Christ but it's not so but let me tell you it's got to be so with this now because the first grain the first one has already got there and I believe there's been others have reached that place but it's not just when brother Bram gets there because he got there a long time ago it's not just when another brother over here gets there or another person over herei amen 13 says until we all get there and all is in God's definition not mine or anybody else all getting to that statue of a perfect man is the predestinated ones because he's not when he says all he knows what he's talking about that's in his context that's in his choosing amen amen because if if we say all and we want to include everybody then you're not reading it right but all that he predestinated to come to the Statue of a perfect man those are the ones whose names are Lamb's Book of Life those are the ones as we read the other day that if this church is expecting to be alive when Jesus comes to take his bride away she needs the token amen and the token hallelujah what will perform the paradox is what is needed in this hour for that per now watch to show you very perfectly through the word that we are in another book of Acts we are in the season for the full restoration of brive tree in the Rapture message brother said this is Luke 173 this is Malachi four time he said this is fruit bearing time hallelujah hallelujah this is the season that we're in amen amen and he told us in anointed ones at the end time that there's a lot of different branches that are have been grafted into the main Vine but they're not original amen they're just living off the name and the life and the source of the vine but they're giving different fruits he said but there is an original amen the ones that the vine puts out the vine didn't put out all the different uh uh tangerines and grapefruits amen mandarines no right the vine when it pushed out it pushed out a branch of oranges right that's the one that the vine pushed out but in that [Applause] tree theine got a branch from a different tree went in there and grafted into the tree now that branch is connected to this line and it's sucking life but the fruits can't be any other kind of fruit it's not oranges just because it's connected to this doesn't give oranges it gives the seed that it is the vine doesn't change the SE the rain falling on the tree doesn't change the fruit the seed is the seed Amen brother ever put out another brch it will write another book of Acts in other words it won't just have one chapter huj brother bam said that's the Pentecostal denomination Acts 2 and 4 Acts 2 and 4 Acts 2 and 4 he says and then the preachers turn into two by how many know what 24 is amen that's what brother said it says all they preach is Acts 2 and 4 Acts 2 and 4 the holy came down there Pentecost they were all the Holy Ghost they all begin to speak in tongu as the spirit gave them utterance 2 ands 2 and they turn into a 2 and they hit people head brother said okay Hallelujah just amen there's more than that Peter came to the gate beautiful John and he didn't pray he didn't stay there all night he spoke the word Silver and Gold Have I but I have I give it to you does that sound familiar I give it to you in the name of Jesus Christ yes sir said Peter didn't have to pray he spoke where did he get that from who was that that was Jesus that wasn't that was what was in that son of man when it was divided amongst his body you can see an attribute of that one of his members hallelujah hallelujah Jesus is the one that told the woman amen your daughter is healed he's the one that told the room amen go and your Serv will be well Hallelujah Hallelujah he's the one that says peace be still Hallelujah he's the one that said tree no one eat from thee hallelujah hallelujah that same Jesus was continuing his work amen the same one that brought Peter James and John into that room thereus all you believe you're not going to create an atmosphere amen amen of faith for this Jesus wanted those around him he said Peter you believe John you believe you believe come Brothers let create atmosphere Amen brother What Spirit was in this man Jesus Man shows us like a drama this he said that little girl Spirit already out there hallelujah hallelujah and past Dimensions his word past dimension hallelujah hallelujah was in theer came another little girl the book of The Same Spirit that was Jus I be Hallelujah and she came back to life that change Spirit was continuing the work through his many members but but the work the movement wasn't just about Peter oh he's he's the man no that's where people get it off when when they draw attention after the son of man has left the attention it's not a one man thing the message that we received was from one man amen it's a onean message amen amen amen but the continuation that message is divided in diversity but it's one Giver operating through many [Music] gifts and the attention is not just on one Minister look at the book of Acts why we said Friday God chose Luke that wasn't even alive when Jesus was alive wasn't following his ministry but yet he came under the ministry of Paul years and years after amen amen and he wrot L and he wrote the book of act God chose a doctor that studies the body to write about his body Hallelujah and and Luke didn't just focus in the book of Acts just the head no you go not just about one church he shows you the church in Ephesus he shows you the church in thessalonica he show he shows you the church in Jerusalem amen and he shows you Peter being the LED of the spirit preaching by the Holy Ghost people receiving the holy he shows you aach under the the holy brother Aon according to the Bible has to hold the mystery of the fath within in other words to speak it in English to you you got to know the revation he has to be at to teach brother look at look at Sten in the Bible was one of the seven that was chosen as a deacon brother he stood before priests he stood before all these all these well educated studied men he tore their doctrines and their to Pieces look at how God used Sten he took that word said God spoke to Abraham he took them through the whole Bible in one sermon God spoke to Abraham right and he gave him a promise and then 400 years later amen the angel came to Mo brother he through the whole Bible amenu and he said God said I will not dwell and a temple made by hand but a body has thou prepared me amen Heaven is my Throne Earth is my foot he was preaching under inspiration he took that Revelation from Genesis of Abraham all the way to the present time and he said right now you do like your fathers amen amen you stiff necking them circumcised of ears amen always to resist the Holy Ghost Hallelujah they knew he just out B of this man look at the spirit that was in the son of man while he was being crucified son of man that was in one of his members dying a slow brother being stoned is not immediate while he he was already in another brother bam said he wasn't even filling the Rocks no more he was in another dimension left body and he said iesus standing brotherus his arms and said come here hallelujah hallu amen hallelujah but before he against what is that the in one of you see what I'm talking it's a continuation all that was in goding to Christ amen this is my operation this is how I'm working and the devil doesn't like when that continuation is on look at the Spirit of the devil and priest they said it's okay Jesus came dead you guys about what the devil say no more preach we forbid you the message is that in the book of Acts let me say C is that [Music] same I'm not I'm you am and I'm showing you that right now whether you believe it or not we're in another book of amelu amen amen and what did Peter say PS and John read they had been persecuted and Peter was preaching directly you the ones that have crucified the Lord and remember that they forid them and they asked by what power by what Authority you in other words where're the great ministers here we're the high priest s other words they were saying who are you who gave you this this Authority this power to preach that's in verse amen amen but this is what uh verse 15 says but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council they conferred among themselves saying what shall we do with these men that indeed a notable Miracle have done by them is Manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem we cannot deny it it doesn't let but that it be spread no further among the people let us straightly threaten them they speak for that no man in this name they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus Peter and John answered and said unto them whether it be right I love this brother amen whether it be right in the sight of God to ARG unto you more than God judge youself for we cannot but speak the things that we have seen and heard when they had further threatened them they let them go finding nothing how that they might punish them because of the people for all men glorified God for that now that was [Music] persecution in a minor form in it's infant state in its Elementary State against the church against the continuation the program of God they forbid them to teach to speak in his name how many know that there's going to come a time brother bam says pergam in church age I believe according to Revelation 1316 that the bride the bride will have to stop preaching when does the bride have to stop preaching when Revelations 1316 begins to the bride will have to stop preaching for the is demanding the mark in the hand or forehead if permission to preach it is until then the bride will not stop hallelujah amen be right in the sight of God Amen to listen unto certain people rather than the message judge amen the reason I'm I'm touching this I'm going to be able to get fully into to show you how perfect the word is how perfect the message is and to show you where we're at right now are in the book of Acts did you know that the books of book of Acts covers more than 30 years and within those 30 years of the book of Acts is where Paul wrote all his Epistles is where James wrote his epistle is where Titus received his letter in other words what I'm saying is all of the New Testament except a few Epistles like John Revelations were all written and given within the book of act am listen to this I'm closing with this long enough but hold on to this right here when the son of man left the scene and this was divided First Corinthians 12 the diversity by one Spirit one Giver one spirit one father one baptism One Faith one spirit in all am and through all but many members and in them members many gifts am right the attention in the book of Acts not just our church is the best brother those days are over the days of following a certain Minister because he's the one that's got the Revelation he's the one that that that is succeeding brother br you know that Spirit still Liv amen it's not everybody rallying around one Minister it's the body operating what God called them to do amen not everybody is called for one thing specific not everybody's going to preach the same caral people will say I like how he preaches better than read the book of Corinthians said some say I'm of Apollo I'm of this one I'm nonsense childish things wake up grow up realize that we're in a program here we're in a continuation and it comes from the head all the way down to the feet Hallelujah but everything has to be in in connection with the mind of Christ was telling the brothers the sisters this morning just this week I found a minister on the internet preach this Wednesday this guess what it's time [Music] am another minister in Africa Afric amen he's there preaching amen am I am I copying them I didn't even know they were preaching but that's just showing you something that is the same amans tells Paul when he wasted went to the the pillar of fire revealed to him the scures he came out preaching baptism in the name of Jesus Christ came out preaching all these things and him and Peter met says preaching the same Amen on Amen need have this because we read the post Friday and brother those plain those qus are very clear the bride will know that it will have to be him in her finishing the by and through the members of the body you'll finish all prophecies amen is that right Hallelujah she has the mind of Christ she knows what he wants the head and the body not not Christ is trying is thinking something trying to get something across and the body's going all kinds of different direction did the head appear did the head come down 63 yes but now is the connection of that head with his body we see the head but where's his feet where's his hands amen you understand hallelujah it's here in operation a bride out of every country every nation and is that the Bible no just from our just from our movement just the ones that follow brother so oh my Amen brother sister brother B saw the vision of the of all Nations hallu stand your feet but the reason I touched this here at the end is because the book of Acts now take this with you the book of Acts is after the son of man Ministry and before the coming of Titus r l the book of is after the ministry of John and his son and before Titus the Roman what did Brother R came to Jerusalem surrounded the city starve them to death didn't let them go out of their own walls until they ran out of food until they ran out of water until they ran out of everything they ran out and when the last ones were in their last dying state amen the Roman army went ingh when did that happen where are we at see where we at did John the Baptist come again the spirit of el for the second coming did he reveal the second hallelu not
