[Music] [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Applause] Hallelujah foreign [Applause] and this is you you love this message look wait the fourth seal oh this is good amen yeah come on he says this he said paragraph 92. he says I was talking to a person not long ago he was trying to discuss with me insane because aren't you ashamed to say that God created Heavens in six days and things that's what the Bible says he said well I got evidence I can prove that the world is millions of years old I said that don't have anything to do with it Genesis 1 1 it said in the beginning God created him as an Earth but from that period so more than billions there's no measure to say oh two billion three millions like shine like what a man says about that man that's studying all his life all his life study in the bones don't know what's up and then he says there's and he's discovered that it was some million year old years old really he said you know it's common sense to let you know bone dissolves in the ground after so many years well I guess I gotta actually take billions notice the heavens in the earth period that's all he says this is now the world okay drum sauce words are blurry [Music] so the world without forming boy and I said it is I believe every seed was laying right in there from some other civilization Hallelujah where did the seed come from this Earth it didn't come no we know he said the city foreign amen because of the Fall it was room temperature because they were in the room in English okay [Music] notice easy I believe every seed of the classic was laying right there from another civilization the same thing with the human being oh yeah the same thing don't be small amen he says listen in all this mess is moved away Darkness Darkness he transforms he Transformers chaos because without forms right that's how the Earth was but deep down from another civilization it might look ugly it might look chaos foreign and the revealed truth right the transformation Powers already there she'll make the tree yeah it needs to say that the sun it needs the right time correct you know what some trees in different climates only in certain climates of certain trees yes it needs the right atmosphere Hallelujah notice [Music] foreign [Laughter] [Music] plan is in plain view just as others the word of God is [Music] the Anton if you sow seeds and just throw that out there on the ground it does no good no secret okay the scene has to fall not too deep I don't know how to plant it right you make like a 20-foot hole to plant the South all right or you put it like right on the ground just right yeah right not too deep not too up there right just right and and it's the dirt like hard you know [Music] oh come on oh if it's hard it's a Luna you got a soft enough all right put some fertilizers amen amen why brother why was the why does the word grow so fast in the predestinated ground and others foreign that's true now listen if you show it just throw the Sheep musicians you just throw the on the ground the birds he's talking about the parable of Jesus he says if you throw them on this was in thorns oh man [Music] this is Rich this is Rich what he says Jesus parable so the ground remember Jesus said he's only some fella [Music] was already prepared it's not prepared right here God already did the preparing his garden it's already prepared and the seed yes it's already there destiny [Music] comes in into the word so the word meets The Words the predestinated and the predestinated word written for the hour which is the message oh yes but we can also see it but that one was better we can also see it therefore that love that this message brother Adam says it is the rising yes and that that son yes it's all quickens the C is in the ground is that right but that he said the sun doesn't Quicken The Rock because it doesn't Quicken the dirt that's what he said he says what was that quote Oh here [Music] and he says this so the ground was made ready first God and sovereign [Music] [Music] foreign he foreign move if this ground isn't prepared beforehand it can't go nobody can say that's the reason the seed of faith when you're preaching Faith see the discernments of the Lord and see what takes place all the gifts of the Bible said oh Hallelujah pull it off and come up and find themselves disappointed it's okay the ground has to be foreign [Music] the whole week brother and sister that's why the emphasis Hallelujah hallelujah amen notice what he said I'm just gonna believe it he said then he said order Jesus has sued for just seeds has to have the ground prepared for us first then he says listen it should make you happy there is nothing Hallelujah there is nothing right now out of order forever we think it is but it's just hitting exactly on the way God's word said it would foreign [Music] [Music] he says all these things because of course are our ordained of God it should make you happy release that's the trouble with with we today so much difference in the Christians the Christians when the true revelation of Jesus Christ of those Congress they were rugged people foreign [Music] [Music] which is right and wrong has to have its ground of course all he foreign [Music] before the foundation under the definition of the world he says he says I hope I'm speaking to ground prepare yes this original Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] oh yeah [Music] [Music] all right [Music] okay and you will stand it in your Earth and so yeah that's your soul that's what he practices [Music] foreign [Music] somebody else when she heard the words [Music] [Music] [Music] whatever [Music] not marriage [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] it says that when she was coming back from the world she met the angel of the Lord [Music] shouldn't fear not married [Music] over this scripture [Music] your woman spoke of in the Bible [Music] today [Music] [Music] [Music] Hallelujah [Music] the prepared together foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foundations [Music] [Music] [Music] amen man raise your hands
