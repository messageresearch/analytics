[17:25] myself the Holy Ghost because I know he
[17:28] is the one that's riding these things
[17:40] upon the fleshly tables of the Lord
[17:49] because it's Revelation
[17:52] amen Supernatural storm yeah
[17:57] when Peter when available received the
[18:00] revelations

[20:59] when it comes
[21:03] foreign
[21:44] there's really bad words
[21:50] that means it was already here but it's
[21:52] the return
[21:56] amen amen
[21:58] when it returns
[22:01] it will take the bride
[22:04] Amen in the Rapture yes
[22:09] the Capstone will return
[22:12] the head of it all like I said oh and
[22:15] receive the bride unto himself
[22:19] he will receive the bride up to himself
[22:31] is that right
[22:33] in other words
[22:51] the Capstone returned

[44:48] December of 62. in 63 February
[44:53] I don't care what anybody says he was
[44:56] caught up into a cloud that's what he
[44:59] said amen
[45:46] a Ministry of the world
[45:50] why brother and sister animal when we
[45:53] see that Vindication

[46:50] oh yeah
[46:52] foreign
[47:52] you have to be baptized

[48:09] but now that is what Luke's the only
[48:13] movement
[48:16] you understand yes
[48:20] brother the Holy Ghost spectacular they
[48:23] wonder about these words
[48:29] yes sir amen it's after the church
[48:31] changes are over
[48:35] okay
[48:56] see why is it so hard for people in this
[48:59] day because amen
[49:04] that the word is continue
[49:08] that God is doing something now
[49:12] the Holy Ghost is here now
[49:14] amen amen yeah
[49:17] why is it
[49:19] Nehemiah raising up in the shower
[49:22] raise it up in this house
[49:25] raise it up in this house
[49:28] what does that guy mean listen we got
[49:30] help his name means festive Festival in
[49:34] other words he wasn't dead he was Jordan
[49:38] zachariah's name is the Lord remembers
[49:50] Hallelujah
[50:13] foreign
[51:04] amen
[51:18] amen
[51:21] it's only those who are elected
[51:27] Jesus said I thank you Father father
[51:37] now inspiration
[51:41] they're very
[51:43] inspiration strikes
[51:45] then it is shown and business is more
[51:49] style so shall it be at the coming of
[51:51] the son I mean
[51:53] see right what is revealed is a secret
[51:57] made known a revelation is to reveal or
[52:02] to make known as secrets
[52:09] with inspiration fell upon Nehemiah
[52:14] he took that inspiration and he began to
[52:18] do something
[52:20] we begin to fulfill the prophecya that
[52:23] was that the angel came to death the war
[52:27] will be built in Troublesome times
[52:34] what the inspiration is
[52:39] we have to retain that Inspirations yes
[52:43] you understand and then there is not
[52:46] just to get into The Inspirations
[52:57] oh no
[53:01] amen amen brother and sister we should
[53:04] know
[53:05] already god what the inspiration is
[53:08] foreign
[53:33] so what is it foreign
[53:43] amen
[53:44] everyone has their pleasure but when the
[53:49] inspiration is being given to us we
[53:52] ought to realize
[53:53] this is part of the Fulfillment of the
[53:56] words
[54:00] we see the opposition
[54:04] taking place
[54:09] have you heard brother Gabriel's
[54:11] testimony
[54:15] he had told me that is
[54:19] amen
[54:21] you think that's a coincidence
[54:26] the lady said he was born
[54:30] and he asked law to give him a scripture
[54:34] the reason he told me that is because I
[54:37] was telling him brother and sister we
[54:40] are seeing our names
[54:45] foreign
[55:11] foreign
[55:29] foreign
[55:57] amen
[56:04] amen but right when we look at this he
[56:07] alive
[56:08] amen after the prophecy of Daniel again
[56:20] I was given years
[56:52] stop this work
[56:55] any opposition that comes against you
[56:57] okay
[57:01] will not go too far
[57:05] amen that's the reason why we must
[57:08] realize
[57:10] things foreign
[57:24] foreign
[57:55] but the thing is
[57:57] we've got to realize whether look at the
[58:00] words
[58:21] that's what's happening
[58:24] amen hallelujah
[58:31] these things aren't here brother and
[58:33] sisters
[58:35] and we're under the inspiration he's
[58:38] talking about
[58:40] you want to hear some of those
[58:41] prophecies
[58:45] and answers
[58:48] number one 1964.
[58:51] he says the other day I'm not mixed up
[58:56] I'm happy to hear it
[58:59] we're not mixed up he's talking about
[59:02] when we preach please
[59:11] I'll probably hear from him when I was
[59:14] talking about the seven trumpets I was
[59:17] referring to the Pentecostal please
[59:27] to pass over to Pentacles is
[59:39] see
[59:45] that it should be because if I say the
[59:47] seventh month after
[59:50] that was brought in
[59:52] the streets of the trumpets which meant
[59:56] the seven churches
[1:00:02] if you listen to Future trumpets
[1:00:05] seven sabbaths and seven churches
[1:00:11] he says it's seven months
[1:00:14] see but now I didn't explain it on this
[1:00:18] brigade I said seven seven
[1:00:21] but then I carry that same spot
[1:00:25] when it's the seventh month after the
[1:00:29] Feast of Passover
[1:00:30] or or the three Supreme Court they come
[1:00:35] after the Feast of the Sheaf
[1:00:41] you remember the sheath turns into a
[1:00:44] loaf
[1:00:47] amen
[1:00:56] once it was a Sheaf and it all goes into
[1:01:00] one Loop he says oh it's a great teacher
[1:01:04] I didn't touch the edge of it
[1:01:10] but if you happen to catch that is
[1:01:13] on your teeth and so say remember
[1:01:16] regardless and look in the Bible in
[1:01:19] seven months after that count off seven
[1:01:22] months what they said the message which
[1:01:24] represents full seven churches
[1:01:27] some Minister a woman might pick that up
[1:01:30] and then you'll have it
[1:01:35] thank you
[1:01:42] According to some there's nothing for
[1:01:44] ministers to do now brother
[1:01:50] oh my God
[1:01:52] Minister might pick that up
[1:01:55] and then you'll have it
[1:02:02] thank you
[1:02:06] amen amen now someday I'm going to leave
[1:02:09] here
[1:02:10] questions and answers on Hebrews
[1:02:14] 1957. Someday I'm gonna leave here
[1:02:17] and I'm wondering what will be my end
[1:02:22] yes is it
[1:02:24] just about I'm 48 years old
[1:02:30] I wonder if it is
[1:02:33] why didn't the world
[1:02:37] why did they realize
[1:02:43] that picture there is
[1:02:46] why didn't they catch that right quick
[1:02:50] why don't they catch these other things
[1:02:53] why don't they catch these prophecies
[1:03:00] they can't do it now
[1:03:03] yes they can't do it now
[1:03:07] but one day when they are going to leave
[1:03:10] the world
[1:03:11] when I leave
[1:03:14] recognize
[1:03:22] will realize that
[1:03:25] after I'm gone
[1:03:27] that's what God wanted permitted to be
[1:03:31] done now remember
[1:03:34] amen
[1:03:39] yes
[1:03:45] but we got to get under inspiration
[1:03:53] Nehemiah got under the inspiration yes
[1:03:55] amen
[1:04:02] is
[1:04:10] and after my going away from this Earth
[1:04:19] many of you young children
[1:04:25] that is exactly the truth
[1:04:37] amen amen
