[1:40] 1962. he said the seed is in the ground
[1:44] amen he said Billy uh Billy Graham when
[1:48] Billy Graham has planted the seeds for
[1:51] the
[1:59] Pentecostal denomination
[2:01] he says
[2:40] in the resume
[3:03] shut up
[3:05] amen amen yes
[3:34] but it would be in the first month
[3:39] it would be in the same months in a
[3:42] measal mess it would be in the same
[3:44] season
[3:45] we understand that now right
[3:48] what is the first month yes it remembers
[3:51] for the Jewish calendar
[3:55] amen
[3:57] it's springtime
[4:00] see
[4:02] now
[4:04] that is
[4:06] their first Feast
[4:08] I Passover is to be celebrated
[4:12] last week
[4:14] amen is Feast of Tabernacles yes
[4:20] amen amen you see right what
[4:24] what that what that is showing us
[4:27] is that we're not dealing in the natural
[4:31] like the Jews
[4:35] preach the restoration of the Bride
[4:38] treatment
[4:41] amen speaking of job I will restore said
[4:45] the Lord the invasion of the locusts
[4:49] amen amen what did he say he said in the
[4:53] springtime
[4:54] it means resurrection
[4:57] and he said and through the churches
[5:01] there's been a cold winter
[5:04] amen
[5:09] now Express erections
[5:21] foreign
[6:31] he said
[6:53] which are the revelations foreign
[7:48] in the morning
[8:19] good morning
[8:42] and in the springtime yeah the spring
[8:46] sun is
[9:07] amen
[9:20] but notice do you say
[9:22] when the seat is
[9:27] foreign
[9:49] foreign
[9:57] be truly fulfilled
[10:01] until the openings
[10:06] in 1965
[10:08] he said this mystery it was the mistake
[10:12] of Matthew 24 24
[10:15] the two are so close
[10:22] this could not be made known as soon as
[10:24] I said he said because this is a sign it
[10:27] was an accident
[10:29] yes so therefore
[10:34] I'm not going to say it until the seals
[10:41] foreign
[11:06] you see only the prophet messenger of
[11:09] the age
[11:11] was given the seat to pray yes when he
[11:16] first went amongst the Pentecostals he
[11:18] couldn't understand
[11:21] and the other one was a genuine
[11:24] Christian
[11:25] amen amen
[11:29] and the Lord
[11:31] Hebrews chapter six
[11:34] amen amen
[11:38] and
[11:50] and and the righteous yeah
[11:53] the rain falls on the Justice
[11:59] it went back to Hebrews six and that's
[12:02] what everybody else says it is
[12:08] very simple it is impossible
[12:11] for you to receive and conceive us and
[12:14] then fall back you know guys that's what
[12:17] he that's what he brought
[12:19] so really he says he's seen a great
[12:22] picture
[12:29] is that right
[12:31] he says in there
[12:42] was a tears the same thing amen I mean
[12:47] why okay because if that's what happened
[13:49] exactly 50 years ago
[13:53] December of 64.
[13:59] Amen 50 years ago
[14:02] amen Harvest Time
[14:08] oh my God
[14:11] when but no that mystery is in these
[14:15] days
[14:16] it's the reason why because the sporting
[14:20] the rain is falling
[14:26] I mean
[14:27] you understand again
[14:29] that's the tremendous point is
[14:39] different so if only the message of the
[14:43] age
[14:50] Hallelujah
[15:18] hallelujah amen amen that's former rings
[15:25] but it's not a try Doctrine amen
[15:32] hallelujah it's got some more extra in
[15:35] there so the sea can fall on the eyes
[15:53] it's just like this yes I see
[15:55] you know the prophet of God is the Angel
[15:59] to the church
[16:04] amen amen we all believe that
[16:09] and then in every local assembly
[16:13] there's an angel of that church yes
[16:21] you see it's the same thing there's a
[16:24] head planter
[16:26] but this is what brother I am saying
[16:31] this is the way the light comes
[16:35] to a god-given message
[16:38] see in a certain area he said from that
[16:42] messenger
[16:43] there spreads the light through the
[16:45] Ministries
[16:48] who have been Faithfully talked you know
[16:50] foreign
[17:06] remember Paul warned me
[17:09] and he told them in First Corinthians
[17:45] I mean
[18:10] is no longer
[18:13] and the Revival dies down
[18:19] how careful we must be the only hear one
[18:23] voice
[18:28] which is
[18:31] words
[20:28] it is
[20:31] famous
[20:50] others who are Faithfully talked
[20:53] they have to continue
[20:59] holding that message
