[17:53] is where the seventh trumpet sounds
[17:57] to the jews
[18:53] revelations
[19:08] that's
[19:22] because

[19:27] those things
[19:28] you see what problems is going to do and
[19:31] look at this god's head you see what god
[19:32] has done
[19:34] if you can take those types of muscle

[19:40] people according to what the prophet
[19:41] interpreted
[19:43] and you'll see exactly
[19:46] amen then
[19:47] it shows it reveals
[19:50] those
[20:04] he's going to begin
[20:18] amen
[20:45] is
[21:00] that's where
[21:12] he said jesus preached the seals
[21:27] yes
[21:28] amen okay first seal you can find it
[21:31] there
[21:32] i say amen
[21:34] he opened the seals
[21:36] in symbol form information he said what
[21:39] will it be when it's open in reality
[21:41] forms
[21:56] is
[22:24] so jesus opened the seals in civil war
[22:28] 1924
[22:34] and foreign
[23:20] hey
[23:49] he even said it even before
[23:52] that they even asked a question
[23:54] in verse 2
[23:57] but in verse 15 the reversal of king
[23:59] mentions it again the way that there's
[24:00] another
[24:03] see the foreign
[24:04] of desolation spoken by daniel the
[24:06] prophet instead of the holy place who
[24:08] read it let him understand
[24:30] yes
[24:58] what is the sign
[25:12] yeah female movement look at verse 6 of
[25:15] faith
[25:16] and you shall hear of wars and rumors of
[25:18] wars
[25:20] see that he may not trouble
[25:22] for all these things must come to pass
[25:25] but the ending is
[25:51] and this gospel of the kingdom shall be
[25:53] preached in all the world
[25:56] and all the world amen for a witness
[25:59] unto the nations and then shall the
[26:02] income
[26:04] hello
[26:21] amen
[26:22] this message
[26:48] um
[27:03] look what he said
[27:18] oh
[27:22] how many remembers
[27:23] that it's right in there
[27:26] what is the copy of the son of man
[27:29] the lightning coming out of the east
[27:53] immediately after the tribulation of
[27:54] those days
[27:56] shall the sun regard
[28:42] the observatory
[28:53] he connected the cloud everybody's going
[28:55] to move

[29:38] we're not trying to repeat ourselves
[29:41] we're trying to clench the nails
[29:44] and make it whole
[29:46] where the devil can't shake that from
[29:49] you
[30:34] jesus omitted the seventh seal this is
[30:37] what we killed except he will say he
[30:39] teaches it in the sixth seal for exactly

[31:27] the
[31:27] when his branches get tender and put it
[31:30] forth leaves you
[31:58] oh

[33:07] i'm just going to go through the
[33:08] scriptures
[33:35] is
[34:16] what's in connection with them
[34:29] shall not pass till these things be
[34:31] fulfilled
