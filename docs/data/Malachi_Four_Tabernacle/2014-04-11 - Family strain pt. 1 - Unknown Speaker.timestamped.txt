[0:08] foreign
[1:08] controversial
[1:38] but you do have a choice
[1:41] in your humanistic realm
[1:45] but something inside of you is
[1:48] that Gene of God
[1:51] that you come predestinated
[1:54] from before the foundation
[2:03] you always had eternal life
[2:16] we don't receive eternal life
[2:19] amen yes we have eternal life because
[2:25] we are Sons
[2:38] because ye our son is
[2:42] God has sick foreign
[3:43] but that doesn't satisfy Son of God it
[3:45] is
[3:58] you know except the Creed of the church
[4:00] I say the apostles they were supposed to
[4:04] be baptized in waters
[4:10] the only thing that's satisfies
[4:31] Hallelujah
[4:35] and because
[4:39] she's something that I've sold something
[4:41] in our hearts
[4:46] there's already something there
[4:49] and potentially
[4:51] everything that we need
[4:55] for this life
[4:59] is already inside of us
[5:07] it has to be
[5:09] dermatized it has to be quick
[5:12] in other words
[5:15] that's something inside of you is
[5:18] to be
[5:20] brought out it has to be woke up
[5:24] realize that God always had a plan for
[5:29] your life
[5:33] but you see we we were born
[5:41] this body is
[5:45] come from
[5:48] yep
[6:03] my father and mother did make myself
[6:21] damn it
[6:25] so even that is
[6:28] all the potentials all of potentials
[6:32] that you need
[6:35] but it has to be quick and it has to be
[6:38] activated
[6:43] by the holy ghost power foreign
[6:47] that's why we read in Galatians 4 that
[6:49] we were already Sons but
[6:51] for that reason he sent it
[6:59] the spirit capital is
[7:04] the Lord Jesus Christ
[7:14] how many spirits of God
[7:27] how many Cummings of the spirit life
[7:32] foreign
[8:04] potato
[8:06] Hallelujah
[8:09] see so
[8:13] this is why Italian
[8:18] Church age
[8:24] he was talking about the baptism of the
[8:26] Holy ghosts
[8:32] he goes on to say
[8:36] upon whom did the Spirit fall at
[8:39] Pentecost
[8:44] upon the sons
[8:52] upon the sun foreign
[9:21] that can happen tonight
[9:35] amen amen
[9:37] he says what is the baptism of the Holy
[9:39] ghosts
[9:41] it is the spirit
[9:43] baptizing you into the body of Christ
[9:48] is the spirit of God coming in
[9:53] after you have repented
[9:55] having heard his word
[10:00] Hallelujah
[10:02] what we have look at the neighbors just
[10:05] set forth would be easier to understand
[10:10] if we all believe
[10:12] the doctrine of the Oneness of the
[10:15] godhead
[10:20] for there are not three persons in the
[10:22] godhead but one okay
[10:25] thus we are not born again listen to
[10:28] this I said yes
[10:30] while the spirit of Life foreign
[10:46] foreign
[11:24] Australian church I'm open here
[11:31] so
[11:34] there's not the Covenant of the Holy
[11:36] Spirit didn't have to work to give us
[11:37] power yeah
[11:39] if that were true
[11:43] we are dishonoring the father
[11:46] I've not giving him a part in our
[11:48] complete salvation salvation
[11:52] for salvation is of the lord
[11:54] and there are three Lords
[12:00] salvation is of the Lord
[12:09] salvation
[12:11] I believe it's chapter two verse
[12:20] of the Lord and there's three Lords yes
[12:28] foreign
[12:35] the word
[12:37] he says listen must
[12:41] then then he the father must have
[12:43] something to do with it too because
[12:46] surely it can be seen that Jesus made
[12:49] this very clear yes
[12:58] it is
[13:16] is
[13:31] Jesus
[13:46] Jesus dwellers in them
[13:50] he he was dwelling with them and was
[13:54] going to be in there
[13:58] see right
[14:01] okay when he was speaking to the decide
[14:05] speaking to the disciples he said
[14:08] we will come
[14:13] here is the Father the Son of the Holy
[14:16] Ghost
[14:19] at one time that's right foreign
[14:27] says
[14:36] there are two coming
[14:39] of the spirit
[14:44] uals
[14:56] that the people don't know the real
[14:58] truth
[14:59] they simply believe in Jesus
[15:13] before I close this subject I know there
[15:17] is a question in your mind
[15:19] you will want to know if if I believe
[15:24] and the doctrine of pre-existence
[15:27] I don't believe in that Mormon doctrine
[15:32] of the pre-existence of souls
[15:35] any more than I believe in reincarnation
[15:38] of trans
[15:40] Almas
[15:47] be careful here and see this
[15:50] it is not the
[15:53] Persona that comes predestinated
[16:00] the why then why do we try to act or say
[16:03] that
[16:07] president
[16:13] you understand again
[16:16] he says be careful here it's not the
[16:19] Persona that comes predestinated
[16:22] eternally from God
[16:24] it is
[16:26] or the sea
[16:29] yes that comes
[16:36] way back there
[16:38] ayatras too far back for the human mind
[16:41] to aggress the
[16:44] Eternal god with eternal thoughts
[16:51] Romans 9 13 Romans
[17:00] that neither was born
[17:09] there was a part of God
[17:12] became expressed in God brought Jacob
[17:16] back because
[17:19] Jacob alone was
[17:21] foreign
[17:30] amen
[17:40] but how come only take a machine and he
[17:43] saw us now
[17:46] but yet in the strain of the family
[17:50] I'm barely touching into this place
[17:54] what the strain of the family family
[18:11] well thank you Lord
[18:14] Timely
[18:19] you read the story in the Book of
[18:21] Genesis
[18:23] and you see Esau's character you see how
[18:26] he is
[18:34] Jacob was a shyster yes
[18:45] thank you
[18:47] amen amen
[18:49] a better man he said any device
[18:56] for their Church
[19:00] yep so what are you saying amen
[19:02] sad let's say Jacob be the one in here
[19:07] it's okay I'll leave
[19:10] come on
[19:12] because Esau was a better man okay
[19:16] bring
[19:21] me
[19:24] Vincent for his father
[19:26] amen amen take care of things
[19:32] come on amen amen and Jacob was just
[19:36] deceiving people all the time he wanted
[19:38] to see his own dad
[19:43] mama's boy
[19:51] um
[19:52] amen amen
[19:56] see Esau was so good of a person
[20:00] amen let his father
[20:05] say okay was ready to give him the
[20:08] Blessed seeds
[20:12] from God himself to pass that blessing
[20:15] on to eat something because
[20:19] he was a good man
[20:22] he deserved it
[20:24] and then Jacob comes and steals
[20:30] Hallelujah don't worry but now look
[20:36] let me say this here
[20:40] if you are a true sea
[20:43] you will hear the word
[20:46] the spirit the spiritual baptize you
[20:49] into the body of Christ
[20:54] and you will receive the words
[21:04] this is how clear the true evidence
[21:09] because when the word is revealed to you
[21:14] Jesus was the royal Seas
[21:17] when the spirit called to him
[21:20] the word manifested thoughts
[21:25] it was baptized in water
[21:28] upon obeying the words the Holy Spirit
[21:32] came upon him
[21:34] but the voice
[21:42] The Voice did not say this has become my
[21:46] son
[21:48] the voice said this is my son
[21:52] and I will dwell in here
[22:13] and all the way through
[22:16] he went in and demonstrated Powerade
[22:19] receiving the full revelation of God
[22:23] from God for that
[22:28] we have been constantly saved
[22:31] that the true evidence
[22:40] for the believer to receive the word
[22:41] foreign
[22:48] there's a way to receive it
[22:52] is
[22:59] amen amen Revelation Revelation is not
[23:03] intellectual information
[23:07] is an experience an experience
[23:13] when he quickens these this word that's
[23:16] in the Bible
[23:18] the promise for this
[23:22] real to you that's right man
[23:28] amen amen I mean it would start
[23:31] preaching them what's happening go ahead
[23:33] come on
[23:37] see
[23:41] now in the message paradox
[23:45] like this is he preached in 1963.
[23:50] I'm gonna read
[23:52] two quotes where he talks about family
[23:54] strength is
[24:00] Familia
[24:04] and in this one
[24:06] he talks about a young man very fine
[24:09] young man
[24:12] he was going with the little girl
[24:15] very fine little girl having a fine
[24:17] family because
[24:22] some kind of idea I walked away and he
[24:27] did something wrong
[24:30] and Manchester promised her to do a
[24:33] certain thing and do it
[24:35] and instead of him coming to the girl
[24:38] and apologize
[24:41] right felt like a real gentleman
[24:46] it just wasn't giving him to do it
[24:55] father and mother called me to the scene
[25:00] we would desire to know what is wrong
[25:03] with our boys
[25:06] it's not easy to do some time but we
[25:09] must be truthful and honestos
[25:14] the boy was a Christian as far as a
[25:17] Believer
[25:20] he has been baptized
[25:24] and had his position among the Believers
[25:26] in church
[25:29] have not received the baptism of the
[25:31] Holy Spirit
[25:41] amen
[25:43] he did it bad
[25:47] the thing about it is
[25:54] to take that family straight away
[25:59] and he just mentioned the academy
[26:02] what who bought this boy was right
[26:05] came to church
[26:10] he was a Believer remember
[26:19] somewhere on the other line
[26:22] yes listening
[26:30] we have not yet received the baptism of
[26:33] the holy of the Holy Spirit
[26:36] you thinking you have and having it with
[26:39] two different things
[26:45] you might be able to try to say you have
[26:48] it
[26:48] you might be able to show some evidence
[26:51] of some emotions
[26:57] inside of
[26:59] the area something
[27:02] something look at the controller yeah
[27:03] yeah no matter how many emotions you
[27:07] have you can jump up run Sensations
[27:30] something's got to control your life
[27:37] it's not you trying to control your life
[27:41] something's got to control yours
[27:46] granny Lord
[27:49] yeah
[27:52] if you have the Reigns of your life if
[27:55] you have the steering wheel of your
[27:57] lives
[28:04] yes see because if God
[28:11] verses
[28:19] amen
[28:23] the spirit raised Christ from the dead
[28:25] yes
[28:30] the spirit raised him from the day
[28:40] the Bible says the woman that lives in
[28:44] pleasure even the latest this is
[28:50] you've ever heard of terminology walking
[28:53] dead man
[28:56] that's biblical truth
[29:01] foreign
[29:05] so now this young fellow's parents
[29:11] his mother is
[29:16] no reflection on the journey
[29:20] in
[29:22] other words
[29:29] there is a stream
[29:35] that is they'll just sit
[29:37] down and you can talk to them
[29:40] they'll just stare you right in their
[29:43] face
[29:44] wow the girl's sister
[29:47] the mother of this boy her sister
[29:51] I've come down the street
[29:54] many many times in the morning and I
[29:59] would say to the young lady
[30:02] she would be sitting out in her yard
[30:13] fine morning isn't it
[30:16] you just stand and look at me
[30:25] you should come up to see us sometime
[30:36] and her brothers are that way too
[30:38] because her father and mother is the
[30:41] same way
[30:42] the father of the boys
[30:58] uh Mrs perado he says that's his whole
[31:02] family like that except one except out
[31:06] of that whole family
[31:10] have the whole family
[31:15] is someone that has
[31:18] converted
[31:20] this father and mother both are
[31:22] Christians
[31:25] filled with Holy Ghost and they have
[31:27] brought this young man yes
[31:33] the young man is about 17 18 years old
[31:47] mother's family
[31:50] do you think they've ever come there to
[31:54] church
[31:56] they know it's right there it's just not
[31:59] in there
[32:02] or ask for parts
[32:05] they just won't do it
[32:34] had a complex
[32:44] they will not apologize
[32:47] and that's where the boys stand yeah
[32:53] no matter how much you raise him up
[32:59] I love your family all of them drunken
[33:02] souls
[33:06] and so forth look at your family
[33:18] you know
[33:21] foreign
[33:49] so see
[33:52] you are a tree
[33:56] a part of that family tree
[33:59] but yet you have received the Holy
[34:02] ghosts
[34:04] that's the thing that made you change
[34:08] it's not your people anymore
[34:11] it's Christ
[34:14] man I said to the boy look at your
[34:17] family
[34:18] practically all of them are drugs
[34:38] now the same thing has happened to your
[34:41] son
[34:44] and after the father raised up and said
[34:46] yes
[34:48] my son went to the altario foreign
[35:27] to never marry a woman
[35:32] you'll make hell on Earth for her yeah
[35:44] sweet sweet Spirit forgiving Spirit of
[35:47] Christ comes in
[35:50] the Cristo internet then that will be a
[35:53] paradise
[35:58] to take the very nature of the boy
[36:02] that's been ready to him
[36:05] by his father and mothers
[36:08] intellectuals
[36:09] he is
[36:13] but he can't do it
[36:16] he'll never overcome
[36:19] Christ has to overcome
[36:22] David said
[36:30] it'll be a perfect paradox
[36:35] of the spirit of God
[36:41] I've seen critics stand off and make fun
[36:43] and carry on of the Holy ghosts
[36:48] and after a while God gets a hold of
[36:51] that same man
[36:54] and he stands right at the pulpit
[36:57] preaching
[36:58] the same thing that he wants him
[37:02] it's a paradox
[37:15] there's a strain in the natural family
[37:21] and those are things that genetically
[37:24] carry on
[37:27] foreign
[37:58] he says in the Next Generation
[38:02] worse that's right
[38:09] you may not want that because
[38:12] especially is familias
[38:16] yes the son let's say foreign
[38:24] foreign
[38:39] when I get my wife
[38:40] it's true and faithful to her because
[38:52] what happened he doesn't have the Holy
[38:54] ghosts
[38:56] runs in the family is here
[39:16] the thing that he hates amen
[39:20] all right that's right
[39:23] father father he's the he's my mom
[39:27] he used to beat her up I'll never do
[39:29] that
[39:32] strain in the family
[39:34] comes back around
[39:36] and you find the sun yes wow
[39:41] maybe the next Generation
[39:46] amen it's worse
[39:55] amen
[39:57] it's good diseases
[40:00] things you say oh I've had experiences
[40:03] with god brother that that don't exist
[40:04] no more
[40:06] I'm going to show you tonight
[40:11] amen
[40:16] spoken words The Original Seed
[40:20] see the thing is we have a way out
[40:28] we can break the family
