[0:00] now the Church of the
[0:05] firstborn in the
[0:08] Ephesians and for a subtitle
[0:14] or whatever you want to call it
[0:17] context like brother would do many times
[0:21] amen
[0:23] title he said my title is
[0:26] leadership and my subject is follow me
[0:33] Hallelujah that what he said hallelujah
[0:37] amen and we are Hallelujah
[0:41] so I believe
[0:44] uh there's something there's there's a
[0:49] something
[0:52] defined
[0:53] to what God
[0:56] gives and I believe that help helps us
[1:02] more to Define what we're speaking
[1:06] of when we give a subject amen or when
[1:09] we give a title
[1:12] something and the reason for
[1:15] that is because right here in
[1:17] Hebrews it speaks of a church of the
[1:24] firstborn Now who is the first
[1:28] born
[1:32] amen was there a
[1:37] firstborn son the first
[1:39] born Jesus
[1:45] Christ he was the first begotten of the
[1:50] father is that
[1:51] right and the first the Paul speaks of
[1:55] it two
[1:57] ways the first begotten of the father
[1:59] Father which was speaking of his
[2:03] birth and then you find him speaking of
[2:06] the first begotten amongst the
[2:10] dead you can even read Ephesians 5 in
[2:14] many scriptures even in
[2:17] Corinthians where he quotes quotes the
[2:21] scripture where God says Amen in the
[2:24] Psalms this day have I begotten thee
[2:28] amen and he's talking about his
[2:31] resurrection so he's showing you that
[2:33] not only is he the first begot or the
[2:36] first
[2:37] born amen as to
[2:41] say In the Flesh amen amen but the first
[2:47] to raise from among the
[2:49] dead
[2:51] amen you understand yes amen
[2:57] now there was a church of the
[3:01] firstborn in the early
[3:03] church amen
[3:05] amen our subject
[3:08] is a
[3:10] desire or our
[3:13] desire to maintain the father's
[3:18] name and obtain The
[3:22] Inheritance amen amen we we've already
[3:26] seen how they came into the land
[3:30] how they came into the Ephesians
[3:32] remember that establishment and all of
[3:36] that that made them the Church of the
[3:41] firstborn they were the ones that were
[3:44] carrying the
[3:46] name of Jesus Christ brother mam said in
[3:51] them that name
[3:54] lived and people
[3:56] today if you get too in
[4:00] ual and too
[4:02] caral about the Revelation that God has
[4:05] given us in this
[4:07] hour all you can think
[4:10] of when it comes to the
[4:14] name living in the church would just
[4:18] be that we have now the name of Jesus
[4:22] Christ when we baptize in that
[4:25] name and I'm not making light of it
[4:29] that's a great
[4:30] Revelation but that was something that
[4:32] even the Pentecostal Church
[4:35] received is that
[4:38] right but and then brother mam goes on
[4:42] to tell
[4:43] us there was Jesus only and there was
[4:47] this and there was that amen and then
[4:49] the true Revelation comes
[4:51] out how many knows brother bam said that
[4:55] even that was one of the revelations of
[4:57] the
[4:58] seals
[5:00] amen what he said amen the baptism in
[5:04] the name the Lord Jesus
[5:07] Christ yes he yes that's what he said he
[5:12] said serpent seed was one of the
[5:14] revelations of the
[5:16] seals and he preached that in
[5:19] 58 and then and then and then in
[5:24] 1965 he remember when we preached on the
[5:26] exposition
[5:28] book how many remembers defending the
[5:31] exposition
[5:33] book Hallelujah is what we titled it we
[5:36] preach the whole Sunday on Amen because
[5:39] of what was going on but remember we
[5:42] brought out brother said in
[5:45] 65 the lord gave me a a revelation
[5:50] yesterday just the other day about the
[5:53] serpent seed then I want to add it in
[5:56] that
[5:58] book so in that Exposition
[6:02] book in the Blue Book amen amen there's
[6:07] things that brother bradam was receiving
[6:10] from God even as late as
[6:14] 1965 and he was including those
[6:17] revelations in that
[6:21] book and you see what he's talking about
[6:24] when you read the Ephesian Church
[6:27] age something that had not said in 58
[6:33] but he said in the
[6:37] exposition hallelujah amen amen yes sir
[6:42] and what was
[6:44] that one of those things
[6:48] was if you
[6:53] remember he took us back to the
[6:57] scripture God made
[7:00] uh male and
[7:02] female and blessed him and called their
[7:11] name what name he said the early
[7:15] church only had one
[7:18] name
[7:20] before they were the church age of
[7:25] eph they were the
[7:31] manifestation of the name of Jesus
[7:34] Christ yes sir they were called
[7:37] Christian amen amen amen They Carried
[7:41] his name they weren't
[7:45] Ephesians they weren't this they weren't
[7:47] that they were the Church of Jesus
[7:51] Christ amen
[7:54] amen but then when the denomination ages
[7:58] began
[8:01] see it was after the
[8:04] departure but now look I want to get
[8:07] into all that I just say that to say
[8:11] this when we look
[8:14] at what God really restored that
[8:18] Revelation for
[8:22] us amen was not just to
[8:26] know water baptism
[8:30] and how to baptize in the name of the
[8:32] Lord Jesus
[8:34] Christ is all
[8:38] that it is is that the only
[8:42] thing that this message came to reveal
[8:45] to
[8:46] us about the name I'm talking about the
[8:50] name
[8:52] no it wouldn't have not been
[8:56] necessary for it to be
[8:58] revealed one of the revelations of the
[9:00] Hidden
[9:02] Mysteries
[9:05] hello if it wasn't something
[9:08] greater than what they had back
[9:12] there amen yes sir because Jesus said I
[9:19] came in the name of my
[9:21] father is that
[9:23] right and what did he say what did he
[9:26] say in St John 17
[9:30] when he's praying he said Lord I have
[9:35] manifested by name there much
[9:41] difference much difference between
[9:44] manifesting the
[9:45] name and just having the name or saying
[9:50] the name and saying I have the name and
[9:54] I baptize in the
[9:55] name and manifesting the name
[9:59] it's something
[10:01] different amen Jesus said I come to
[10:06] manifest the
[10:08] name and I got that scripture written
[10:11] down for further reference over
[10:15] here
[10:18] but to show
[10:20] you that this Revelation in this
[10:25] hour amen that come under the seals was
[10:29] to bring the name back to the
[10:33] church brother said the world is filled
[10:39] with Blasphemous
[10:43] name are you Christian no I'm
[10:47] Methodist are you
[10:49] Christian I'm
[10:52] Baptist
[10:54] I'm I'm this I'm
[10:58] that
[11:00] now we have to make these things really
[11:06] clear because you cannot say that there
[11:10] is not a church carnal and a church
[11:13] spiritual in this
[11:16] message the church caral and the church
[11:19] spiritual are in the
[11:22] message amen amen and the church
[11:25] carinal can take these things and apply
[11:29] it in a carnal
[11:33] mentality Amen in such a
[11:36] way in such a way that they'll even tell
[11:40] people don't name your
[11:43] church because it's a Blasphemous
[11:46] name tell me where brother bam said
[11:50] that amen amen then the Bram Tabernacle
[11:54] is a Blasphemous name
[11:57] too but no it was stayed and it it it
[12:01] was established that
[12:03] way just for the
[12:06] reference of the place that we
[12:08] gather amen amen but we are
[12:13] representing and we are to
[12:16] manifest a name on the earth amen
[12:22] amen and if the only thing that we're
[12:26] manifesting is the name of the church
[12:29] that we have not
[12:31] accomplished what the message come to do
[12:33] in
[12:36] us right amen amen we're just another
[12:42] church member like somewhere
[12:47] else the only way you can manifest the
[12:52] name is that you got to be first born in
[12:55] the
[12:57] family yes hallelujah
[13:01] amen when you were born in your
[13:04] family did you ask can I
[13:08] join the Hernandez
[13:11] Family can I join the Lopez
[13:14] family can I join the the the the Gomez
[13:21] family did you
[13:23] ask you were
[13:27] born
[13:29] Hallelujah and because of
[13:32] birth that
[13:35] name Hallelujah was represented in
[13:40] you is that right
[13:43] amen but
[13:47] then that doesn't settle
[13:51] it amen amen then you have to come
[13:57] forth and grow and
[14:01] mature and manifest that
[14:05] name to
[14:06] show I'm a chip off the old
[14:10] block I'm a
[14:12] chip off the old
[14:15] block
[14:18] amen
[14:20] am I'm of the
[14:23] same
[14:26] pedigree amen amen I'm same
[14:29] lineage
[14:32] amen has somebody ever told you you look
[14:35] in the natural you look like your
[14:41] father right you look like your father
[14:44] why because God is known by his
[14:50] characteristics and God's
[14:52] characteristics are superatural
[14:57] so in you
[14:59] you have certain
[15:00] characteristics you have certain
[15:03] features that resemble your
[15:06] father
[15:09] Hallelujah that's by
[15:11] birth his blood is in
[15:15] you amen and you were in your father and
[15:20] in your great
[15:22] grandfather the Bible taught us that
[15:25] when it spoke of Levi same ties in the
[15:27] Lo of Abraham
[15:30] to prove
[15:33] predestination
[15:34] Hallelujah is that right and Not only
[15:37] was Levi in there but so was Judah and
[15:40] Joseph and all the rest of
[15:43] them
[15:44] amen
[15:46] hallu but Levi was count to pay
[15:52] TI but now
[15:54] notice this here the scripture we read
[15:58] the church of the first
[16:00] born of the first
[16:06] born we're going to make it
[16:08] singular because that's the way it
[16:12] reads and
[16:14] that's you're going to see right
[16:17] now amen the Church of the first born
[16:20] who is the first born there was only
[16:23] one to start with is that right amen and
[16:28] then
[16:30] all the other ones that come off of that
[16:34] one were first
[16:36] born first first showing that they have
[16:41] to be born the same way how was Jesus
[16:46] born by the
[16:49] word and when the word was
[16:52] planted then the overshadowing of the
[16:54] Holy Ghost
[16:55] came and gave birth to that
[16:59] child and that's how every child was
[17:03] supposed to be born according to that
[17:07] birth Jesus said he must be born
[17:14] again Hallelujah and notice what the
[17:17] scripture
[17:18] says the Church of the first
[17:23] born which are
[17:26] written in heaven amen
[17:32] notice by the baptism of the Holy
[17:36] Ghost it
[17:38] proves what is the baptism of the Holy
[17:41] Ghost it's the earnest to your
[17:47] inheritance Ephesians
[17:50] 2 is that right Ephesians
[17:54] 1 is that right amen and Ephesians
[17:57] 4:30
[17:59] the
[18:00] seal until the day of your
[18:03] Redemption is the earnest of your
[18:07] inheritance so it
[18:09] shows that if you are
[18:13] born by the holy
[18:16] ghost that you
[18:19] have your name written in
[18:23] heaven before the foundation of the
[18:27] world amen hallelujah it wasn't put on
[18:32] there when you accepted the Lord it
[18:35] wasn't put on there when you receive the
[18:38] Holy Spirit but when you receive the
[18:41] Holy
[18:42] Spirit and you were born into the
[18:45] family
[18:47] Prov amen you can say all you
[18:50] want am you can claim all you
[18:54] want you can prove all you want but
[18:59] until you're born into the
[19:02] family there is no solid
[19:05] evidence that your name is written in
[19:09] heaven Hallelujah and the reason that
[19:13] you receive the holy
[19:15] spirit says Galatians
[19:19] 4 because you are
[19:23] Sons God has sent the spirit of his son
[19:28] to fill you so that you can cry AB
[19:32] father you were already a
[19:35] son and because you were a
[19:38] son he sent the Holy
[19:41] Spirit to do what what is it for people
[19:45] in the message don't believe in a in a
[19:50] in a in a
[19:52] experience the Holy Ghost get that come
[19:56] on when the Bible
[19:59] it
[20:01] openly and the message of the
[20:04] hour teaches it from 47
[20:09] 65 even invisible union he said that's
[20:13] the only
[20:15] kind that the word can
[20:19] produce he said in
[20:22] 1965 he said go in the scripture and
[20:25] find where they shook hands
[20:30] the
[20:31] scure said I'll join the message
[20:35] church and I'll believe what the
[20:37] preacher says and I believe what I read
[20:39] in the
[20:40] books yes I'm saying that even if you
[20:44] believe what's in the
[20:46] books have you received the Holy
[20:50] Ghost
[20:55] since hallelujah hallelujah
[21:00] said Paul would be certainly in
[21:04] disagreement with
[21:05] you that's what he said Hallelujah told
[21:09] Paul brother Paul I just believe
[21:14] it not good enough brother bam said
[21:18] that's all you can
[21:21] do but God has to accept your
[21:25] faith right and how does he AC your Fai
[21:29] he gives you the Seal of
[21:33] circumcision he's telling you I have
[21:37] accepted your faith in
[21:41] me I'm giving you a
[21:44] sign Hallelujah I'm cutting off the shpl
[21:49] rest sirj yes sir subject
[21:54] you subject you by the same spirit that
[21:58] raised Christ
[22:00] from Qui your mortal
[22:03] body hallelujah
[22:05] hallelujah so
[22:07] now here's the true church in Hebrews
[22:12] 12 in the
[22:14] establishment you believe that was the
[22:16] Ephesians that were
[22:19] establishing as we have previously
[22:22] seen placing of the
[22:25] church where were they where were
[22:30] they Heavenly
[22:33] Jerusalem wow where were they Heavenly
[22:38] places in Christ Jesus what's the
[22:41] believer's
[22:44] position his position in Christ is his
[22:49] Heavenly
[22:51] position what he is that right am
[22:54] hallelujah what he made you Christ
[22:59] before the foundation of the
[23:01] world it's your rightful
[23:06] position and that's why just like in the
[23:09] Old
[23:10] Testament Joshua the
[23:12] soldiers amen I'm saying this you know
[23:14] so that we can all understand when they
[23:17] ran when they crossed
[23:20] Jordan amen amen what do they begin to
[23:22] do fight right they begin to fight and
[23:26] their fighting was for what
[23:29] to move out the
[23:30] enemy that was in their
[23:34] land because that land was rightfully
[23:38] theirs it was already prophesied it was
[23:41] already written and
[23:44] numbers that that L was theirs
[23:48] Hallelujah and they were the
[23:50] lineage they were the L descendants from
[23:53] Adam brother they knew they were
[23:57] pedigree
[23:58] they could look through the five books
[24:00] of Moses and say I come from here all
[24:04] the way
[24:07] here hallelujah because Redemption parts
[24:12] and God
[24:13] sentes with two signs first and second
[24:17] pool but Joshua brought the people in
[24:20] with the third
[24:22] pool
[24:26] Hallelujah that's why
[24:29] people in this
[24:30] day see get all kinds of mixture in
[24:34] it
[24:36] because when you just bear
[24:39] down on one
[24:41] type amen
[24:45] amen
[24:47] types you have to
[24:51] know when to begin a type when to stop
[24:54] the
[24:56] type amen
[24:59] amen
[25:01] and how to apply
[25:06] it is that
[25:08] right what if you
[25:11] say the type of Abraham
[25:14] amen remember
[25:22] brotheris
[25:24] sanctification you separating himself
[25:28] and and then the P Fire coming down and
[25:31] the
[25:33] sacrifice the blood
[25:37] sacrifice then he
[25:39] met Hallelujah that's pcal power is that
[25:44] right then who he
[25:47] met God in flesh is that
[25:50] right A
[25:52] Sign amen
[25:54] amen is that right am and then what
[25:58] happened the type continues right all
[26:01] that speaking of us the type
[26:03] continue
[26:06] yeses you shall receive a promised
[26:09] son I shall
[26:12] return they receive the son Ti from
[26:15] receiving Jesus Christ in the
[26:16] air is that right
[26:19] amen but then if you're if you're in
[26:22] that line of
[26:24] thought that's where the type ends
[26:30] you say how come okay let's continue it
[26:33] then because after did did Abraham
[26:36] receive his body
[26:38] change to receive the promised son yes
[26:41] sir so after his body change he
[26:45] lied he
[26:47] backslid you got to know where to
[26:51] stop that's good brother
[26:54] amen you understand what I'm saying if
[26:57] you're if you're seeing a type I don't
[27:00] know this is the type this is where it
[27:02] fits amen amen and then it goes on
[27:06] another
[27:07] type not Mariah We preached on that you
[27:10] see how that typed out how that
[27:14] me how that's brought to our day the
[27:18] whole
[27:19] Bible is full of
[27:22] that Hallelujah there's not one thing
[27:26] you can't bring out of this
[27:28] that is not relevant and and applies to
[27:31] our
[27:33] Day Bible is a new
[27:36] Bible what he say hallelujah but the
[27:39] thing about
[27:41] types you got to run
[27:45] them time you'll be lying after your
[27:47] body
[27:49] change oh
[27:53] my oh
[27:56] wow
[27:58] amenah
[28:03] no
[28:05] oh where where is this
[28:07] at the church of the first born they
[28:11] were set in Heavenly places so when they
[28:14] come into the land they're pushing out
[28:16] the enemy because that land is
[28:18] rightfully theirs amen now look oh my
[28:23] why do I do
[28:25] this they they knew their
[28:28] names were WR were in the
[28:31] book did they know that then we read

[29:19] book were they were their names in the
[29:21] book yes
[29:24] sir their names are written in heaven
[29:28] they know their
[29:30] predestination by the baptism of the
[29:32] Holy
[29:33] Ghost is that what Paul was teaching to
[29:35] the
[29:37] Ephesians that's what he was teaching is
[29:39] that what brother taught
[29:44] us is that what he taught us did he
[29:46] teach us eternal
[29:48] security he said yes but only in the
[29:51] Holy
[29:54] Ghost is that right amen he said Baptist

[46:22] Moses to number or make a sentence
[46:26] whatever you want to call
[46:27] it of the people of the tribes of the

[49:28] it just like it was over there the only
[49:32] the only way their name can be recorded
[49:35] in the
[49:36] book is because of their

[1:02:42] wife and remember it was ephra and
[1:02:45] man that's what we
[1:02:48] read
[1:02:51] and
[1:02:52] then what happened
[1:02:58] why there's a
[1:03:01] scripture right here in verse
[1:03:07] 33 that didn't have no
[1:03:12] son but had daughters and gives the
[1:03:16] names
[1:03:18] specifically five daughters and this is
[1:03:21] not the only place where this is found
[1:03:25] this is something important hidden in
[1:03:26] the
[1:03:29] scripture because the very next chapter
[1:03:33] 27 speaks of them chapter 36 speaks of
[1:03:36] them first Chronicles 7 speaks of them
[1:03:40] Joshua 17 speaks of
[1:03:42] it so this is just a this a just
[1:03:45] anything there is something
[1:03:50] here amen amen look at this all their
[1:03:55] names in with
[1:03:58] a in with

[1:04:23] of God
[1:04:29] amen is a part of God's

[1:04:34] language that's right and all five of
[1:04:36] them have a part of the
[1:04:39] name is their name
[1:04:43] Hallelujah there are
[1:04:46] five
[1:04:49] virgins
[1:04:52] Hallelujah H and they WI because they're
[1:04:54] going to show you their
[1:05:00] wives yes they're five wise
[1:05:04] virgins and they show their wisdom of

[1:06:03] of them and they're
[1:06:05] wise does that sound kind of
[1:06:09] familiar like something relevant to
[1:06:13] us maybe you know Matthew 25 somewhere
[1:06:18] there Midnight

[1:06:46] what what was there what was the oil in
[1:06:48] their

[1:08:44] mean and these are the
[1:08:46] daughters of the the Church of the
[1:08:51] first and and and and and this father

[1:09:39] Christ y right to
[1:09:43] God and he
[1:09:45] represents the
[1:09:48] a see last week it was Lion now we're on
[1:09:52] ox
[1:09:55] oh Lord O yes sir the tribe of Joseph is
[1:10:00] the ox ephra and
[1:10:04] Manasses with the ban of

[1:10:09] west am
[1:10:14] Hallelujah means first
[1:10:17] born oh
[1:10:21] my now what is this
[1:10:24] their
[1:10:26] father
[1:10:29] died and when this
[1:10:32] numbering is taking place because
[1:10:35] they're taking
[1:10:37] record where's
[1:10:41] brother remember almost about a year
[1:10:47] ago maybe some of you remember if you
[1:10:49] were
[1:10:50] there we had a Bible study at his house
[1:10:55] and in this Bible study at his
[1:10:57] house we're dealing
[1:10:59] with
[1:11:02] with uh choosing of a
[1:11:05] bride you know young men looking for a
[1:11:09] girl or something like
[1:11:12] that Hallelujah remember
[1:11:15] that remember that
[1:11:18] brother and we read some quotes from
[1:11:20] choosing of a
[1:11:21] bride and we read
[1:11:25] specifically numbers
[1:11:29] 36 where spoke of the daughters of
[1:11:34] zop but at that time we just took it for
[1:11:37] the natural
[1:11:39] application because what numbers 36
[1:11:42] shows that these daughters were told do
[1:11:47] not marry outside of your
[1:11:51] tribe stay with your tribe
[1:11:55] remember
[1:11:56] that with your
[1:11:58] Tri world is not your
[1:12:03] tribe is not your
[1:12:07] Tri no sir brother said let it be a
[1:12:11] genuine
[1:12:15] believer first before looking for that
[1:12:17] you got to be looking for the Holy
[1:12:21] Ghost yes Lord yes Lord yes
[1:12:27] Lord and we taught on it and because
[1:12:30] back
[1:12:32] then almost a year ago the Lord led me
[1:12:35] to that scripture to the daughters of
[1:12:39] Z when I was reading Joshua
[1:12:44] 16 josua
[1:12:46] 1 Joshua 18 I read Joshua
[1:12:50] 17 and there they are
[1:12:54] of promise I said I remember
[1:13:00] them so you go back to the book of
[1:13:03] numbers and you find
[1:13:05] them and then God begin to open this
[1:13:10] up what is
[1:13:12] this this is
[1:13:17] powerful this is this is something real
[1:13:22] great know we've had a long
[1:13:25] day how many want to come
[1:13:28] back in the
[1:13:30] evening be a little more
[1:13:33] refreshed amen a little more
[1:13:37] energized and we can really bring this
[1:13:40] out does that sound good to
[1:13:43] you because this is something that is
[1:13:47] just real burning on my heart
[1:13:50] amen when God shows something like this
[1:13:55] especially showing exactly the hour that
[1:13:59] we're
[1:14:00] in something very
[1:14:03] great amen amen and when it comes into
[1:14:09] numbers 27 musicians
