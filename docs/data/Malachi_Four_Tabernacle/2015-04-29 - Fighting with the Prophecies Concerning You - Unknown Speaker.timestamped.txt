[4:01] uh let us open our Bibles this morning
[4:03] God bless
[4:05] you amen how you ready for God's word
[4:08] amen
[4:10] hallelujah we want to open our Bibles in
[4:13] 1 Timothy chapter
[4:17] 1 read a portion of scripture
[4:26] here from Verse 18
[4:43] First
[4:44] Timothy Chapter
[4:47] 1 Verse
[4:52] 18 this charge I commit unto thee son
[4:57] Timothy according to the
[5:00] prophecies which went before on
[5:05] thee that thou by
[5:08] them might as
[5:10] War a good
[5:12] Warfare amen you may be
[5:15] seated may the Lord add the blessings to
[5:19] reading of his
[5:22] word we'd like to speak on a
[5:27] subject fighting
[5:33] with the
[5:34] prophecies concerning
[5:36] you and uh we'd like to take for a
[5:40] subject he hath made us Kings and
[5:42] Priests
[5:43] amen he ha made us Kings and priest but
[5:46] just uh just to kind
[5:51] of give us a few things in which we kind
[5:56] of left off last night uh uh as I was
[6:00] telling the brother was kind of hard
[6:02] just to try to bring
[6:06] everything all in all in one service and
[6:10] uh we just tried to bring out a few
[6:12] points that would help us understand the
[6:14] season in which this Reign is promised
[6:18] to us and I believe that the Lord help
[6:20] us to see that and we can see by his
[6:23] grace that it's during the time of the
[6:25] opening of the seals the word of God
[6:28] becoming PL becoming known to us in this
[6:31] hour and that is what uh that is what
[6:35] this message really come to do amen it
[6:38] come to Quicken the scriptures to us
[6:41] things that were hidden things that were
[6:44] loose or loose sins he come to tie
[6:47] everything and come to show us that it
[6:50] is Christ revealed in his own word amen
[6:55] he come to show us that that Christ is
[6:57] the mystery that was hid but is now
[7:01] revealed amen he come to show us that he
[7:05] is the principal theme of this scripture
[7:09] this Bible and he said that that mystery
[7:12] is throughout the entire scripture and
[7:15] every personage and every character of
[7:17] The Bible we can see that mystery
[7:19] unfolding itself in types and different
[7:22] stories but when we look at it now
[7:25] Through The Eyes of this message it
[7:27] doesn't it's not just stories anymore no
[7:29] it's not just types anymore now it
[7:31] becomes a reality it becomes a shadow of
[7:35] what is taking place or what has taken
[7:38] place in this day and I believe that's
[7:42] the the the understanding that we should
[7:45] have when we look at things in the
[7:47] scripture we should always as brother
[7:50] bradam taught us bring that up to date
[7:54] bring it to the present hour that we're
[7:56] living in amen cuz God is is not a god
[7:59] of History the r preach lifting him up
[8:03] out of History right amen we have to
[8:06] bring him to the present tense that's
[8:08] right yes sir amen God did not leave
[8:12] amen you know 50 years ago he did not
[8:15] leave 40 years ago he is still here this
[8:19] morning amen and the thing is like
[8:22] brother R said it's it's we as uh human
[8:27] beings as people as the church as
[8:30] whatever we want to see individuals that
[8:33] get away from God get away from the word
[8:37] and that is what stops as we we saw last
[8:40] night it stops the rain it stops the
[8:43] Revival it stops the blessings of God
[8:45] but when we come back to the word that's
[8:47] right when we get in line with the word
[8:50] amen like that Vision brother randam had
[8:52] of the Bride marching he said she was
[8:54] from All Nations is that right that's
[8:57] something we must take uh uh very very
[9:00] very deep under consideration and Ponder
[9:03] and meditate on that because many times
[9:06] we can get in a and an idea that uh you
[9:09] know it's just just a little circle or
[9:13] just a little church here a little
[9:14] church there but brother bam saw a
[9:16] vision of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[9:19] around the world is that right remember
[9:22] that
[9:23] 1964 he saw that vision and he says she
[9:26] was made out of all Nations amen and
[9:29] were all dressed in their National Guard
[9:31] and they were all marching and they
[9:33] began to to to uh come off the ground as
[9:37] they were marching they begin to March
[9:39] to the air is that right and as they
[9:41] were going up uh some began to get out
[9:44] of line and brother brandom screaming
[9:46] the vision get back in line amen stay in
[9:50] line with the word amen and this is what
[9:53] uh I believe that we should echo in this
[9:56] hour is we should be that that voice of
[9:59] God echoing the same thing stay in line
[10:03] stay in the message of God this is our
[10:06] TI poost this is this is our absolute
[10:09] this is where we have our foundation
[10:11] amen and when we stay in line of this
[10:14] message and what the context of it is
[10:17] then is it's it's not hard to continue
[10:20] on marching towards the glory of God
[10:25] Amen then we'll begin to see his word
[10:27] have an effect we'll begin to see his
[10:31] Spirit fulfilling what he promised and
[10:34] that's what we want to see amen that's
[10:36] what my heart's desire is and I believe
[10:38] that's what your heart's desire is amen
[10:40] is we want to see what brother Bram said
[10:43] come to pass amen we want to see what he
[10:46] what he promised through the through
[10:48] thus sayith the Lord coming to pass in
[10:50] me coming to pass in you yes sir that's
[10:52] right there's promises there's
[10:54] prophecies concerning you amen that's
[10:57] what we want to speak of that's why we
[10:58] took this scripture here in 1 Timothy
[11:02] 1:8 because this is Paul the messenger
[11:05] of the age telling a young man in his
[11:09] day amen he's telling him in his day
[11:13] that there is prophecies that have went
[11:16] on on thee that by them by those
[11:20] prophecies thy might War a good Warfare
[11:24] amen so this is what we we want to speak
[11:27] on tonight but when we look
[11:29] at what we were uh this morning I'm
[11:32] sorry but we when we look at what we
[11:34] were uh looking at last
[11:38] night
[11:40] uh we see the season what what is the
[11:43] rain for is to is to Quicken God's word
[11:47] amen is as we said there at the end is
[11:51] to lift us up as it was in the days of
[11:54] Noah so shall it be at the coming of the
[11:57] son of man
[11:59] Amen in the days of Noah he knew the
[12:03] time in which that cloud was to come and
[12:06] that rain was to begin to fall down is
[12:09] that right and and and what what did
[12:15] that was brother R said God's promise
[12:19] for that hour to be
[12:22] given in which that
[12:26] R was going to transform
[12:29] amen that's what that did it was to
[12:33] transform
[12:35] that that uh that Ark of Safety from the
[12:40] ground to the skies this is from the
[12:42] message God's power to transform now
[12:44] we're just touching a few more things
[12:46] here to kind of close out last night and
[12:48] just get into enter in into you'll see
[12:53] how this connects right into what we
[12:55] want to speak this morning brother M
[12:57] says God's power to trans trans form he
[12:59] said now notice in Noah's time seeing
[13:02] the word being erected to
[13:06] float he calls the ark the word amen and
[13:10] the Word was being erected to float amen
[13:15] and he had put all this together and
[13:17] then he says now let me make a remark
[13:20] the word being put together for to be
[13:25] transformed from the ground to the skies
[13:29] amen amen from the ground to the skies
[13:33] amen so once the ark was put together
[13:37] yes Lord amen once he had laid
[13:40] everything in there yes sir come on now
[13:43] he had to
[13:44] wait for the promised rain yes sir of
[13:48] that time is that right now he had to
[13:50] wait okay God and and Noah Hallelujah
[13:55] was the only one that knew when that
[13:57] rain was about to fall because God told
[14:00] him get you and your family in the
[14:03] ark amen and how many know that brother
[14:06] brandham said in
[14:10] 1964 amen he said that this is the time
[14:16] where the door is being closed he said
[14:19] amen that's why we must
[14:22] get our families in we must get
[14:25] ourselves in is that right amen the door
[14:28] is closed brother this is a serious hour

[15:05] you know mid year
[15:08] already it's it's it's time that's
[15:10] prophecy the scripture being fulfilled
[15:13] but you know it's a glorious thing

[15:37] he said to get us under
[15:39] pressure he said that when we're under
[15:42] that pressure he said we make the wrong
[15:44] decision yes sir that's right we say
[15:46] things that we normally wouldn't say
[15:48] when we're not under pressure he said
[15:50] help us is that right that's true when
[15:53] you're under pressure you say things
[15:56] just in the in the Moment In the Heat of
[15:58] the Moment you wouldn't say he said if
[16:00] you would sit down and think about it
[16:02] and ponder it and say okay let me let me
[16:04] think about this see and then and then
[16:07] act it out but when you're under
[16:09] pressure you just do things yeah that
[16:13] you normally wouldn't do and brother B
[16:15] said that's why we should let off the
[16:17] pressure how many are here to let off

[19:54] telling it from the inside
[19:56] out when John was caught up
[19:59] he went straight into the holy of
[20:02] holies
[20:03] Hallelujah that's what God is calling us
[20:05] in this hour am the ark is lifting up
[20:08] brother let me tell you the ark is
[20:10] coming up and coming

[22:02] now he said they they begin to ask who
[22:05] is this what is this what is taking
[22:08] place when the people begin to come out
[22:12] and have a Revival a people that's
[22:15] called out separated people a people

[22:41] that seed was planted what is it going
[22:43] to produce yes it's got to produce
[22:47] according to its
[22:49] kind and if this is the message that has
[22:52] been planted in our hearts that's what
[22:54] it's got to
[22:55] produce produce what that same kind of
[22:58] life that same kind of that that same
[23:02] kind of
[23:03] Supernatural uh uh uh manifestation of

[23:09] amen you see it is not just for the
[23:12] ministry no it's for every
[23:15] believer when you need
[23:18] it that's where people go off and they
[23:20] try to make something happen they try to
[23:23] manufacture something that's right
[23:25] brother but brother B said just walk
[23:27] humbly with God be an expectation he
[23:30] said expect the Supernatural and you
[23:32] will see the supernatural amen right the
[23:35] truth but let me tell you yes there's
[23:37] going to be times when you need
[23:39] it you're sure I'm going to need it
[23:42] you're going to need it and in those
[23:44] times that's when you have to know what
[23:48] God has instilled in you that's right
[23:51] that's when you have to know who you are
[23:53] where you stand

[24:21] faith is in you amen amen it's Christ in
[24:25] you the hope of glory amen it's the Holy
[24:28] Spirit brother sometimes we minimize
[24:32] what God has put in our hearts that's
[24:34] right brother what is the Holy Ghost the
[24:36] third person in the Trinity I'm sorry
[24:39] but it's God himself it's
[24:42] deity the holy spirit is nothing less
[24:45] but God in you that's right brother
[24:49] Hallelujah that's what it is brother man
[24:52] I'm saying the message the deity of
[24:54] Jesus Christ he said the Holy Ghost in
[24:56] The Believer is the same power that
[24:58] spoke the world into
[25:02] existence in them people that's got the
[25:04] Holy Ghost amen amen yeah brother bam
[25:09] said there's untapped resources the
[25:11] church has never touched yet that's what
[25:14] he said there's things laying for you
[25:17] and me but we got to believe it
[25:20] brother Hallelujah we got to believe
[25:23] it's for me and reach out in faith and
[25:26] grab a hold of the promise of God amen
[25:29] hallelujah that's right too many in this
[25:31] day are trying to push the people down
[25:34] and trying to oppress the people to tell
[25:37] them these things and these promises and
[25:40] these Supernatural things are not for
[25:42] them yeah that's why the people live
[25:45] under expectation that's right that's
[25:47] right they they live far beyond their
[25:51] privilege and that's why people when
[25:53] they face their challenges when they
[25:55] face their problems when they face the
[25:57] devil that begin to bombard their homes
[26:00] and their families and their minds and
[26:02] their lives they don't know what to do
[26:05] yeah
[26:06] yeah why because we have not recognized
[26:10] what God has put in our
[26:12] hands amen
[26:16] hallelujah oh my what has God put in our
[26:19] hands he's put the most greatest and
[26:22] most powerful thing you

[26:48] sea yes

[26:54] I've seen it work amen
[26:58] yes glory and that's the
[27:01] thing we've got to believe and expect
[27:05] that amen that's why brother Ram said
[27:08] the voice of Jesus Christ after he
[27:11] resurrected how many believe he
[27:13] resurrected amen amen
[27:17] said fear
[27:21] not brother B says that he says you know
[27:24] why he said fear not he says don't fear
[27:27] for failure
[27:30] don't fear for failure fear not
[27:35] believe have confidence
[27:40] yes he says then that is what he
[27:43] promised and people are
[27:46] asking what is this why do they cry out
[27:51] that's why they can't hold their
[27:53] peace and the religious world looks on
[27:56] and says what's the matter with them
[27:58] [Music]
[28:00] who is this what's the cause of this may
[28:03] I say this what is the cause if they
[28:07] would only read the
[28:09] scriptures if they would only find out
[28:12] it's the spirit of Christ that has
[28:14] promised by God for the last days in the
[28:17] last days I pour out my spirit upon All
[28:20] Flesh there will be latter rain a rain
[28:23] of the spirit of God falling upon the
[28:26] people in the last days and he said
[28:29] there will also be latter and former
[28:31] rign in the same
[28:34] time now listen when the people
[28:38] separated themselves from sin things of
[28:40] the world to come out and be separated

[1:09:58] church says oh that can't
[1:10:02] be my modern events make clear by
[1:10:05] prophecy listen he says if you are Son
[1:10:08] of God daughter of God you were in God
[1:10:09] all the time amen he knew what bedtime
[1:10:12] you would be planted now you're made a

[1:10:23] hour say again but this one is
[1:10:28] stronger want to hear what he
[1:10:32] says he
[1:10:34] says the Son and Daughter of God to meet
[1:10:37] the challenge of the hour to vindicate
[1:10:40] the true and living God oh my goodness
[1:10:44] of this hour amen the message that's
[1:10:48] coming forth in this time
[1:10:56] do I understand that
[1:10:58] correctly do I understand that correctly
[1:11:02] you are here to vindicate yes sir that's
[1:11:07] right the
[1:11:09] message that's coming forth from the
[1:11:13] Propet that's good that's strong
[1:11:16] amen that's strong in other words you
[1:11:20] manifesting that word in you you are
[1:11:23] showing that what he said yes is
[1:11:29] true that's why you got so many people
[1:11:31] leaving the message right now cuz that
[1:11:33] message is never in

[1:12:00] promised being
[1:12:01] fulfilled that's

[1:12:09] interpretation he can interpret it all
[1:12:11] away from the true thing of God but how
[1:12:14] does God interpret his word he
[1:12:17] interprets it by bringing it to

[1:12:24] fulfilled
[1:12:26] amen that's why we need
[1:12:29] manifestation and that is the
[1:12:34] interpretation oh GL we can debate well

[1:13:00] pointing to is manifested in you amen he
[1:13:04] said now they can't if they do it's sin
[1:13:09] yes
[1:13:10] yes yeah to
[1:13:15] disbelieve that's true brother amen we
[1:13:19] can we can say well it's this well it's
[1:13:21] that you have a right sure you have a
[1:13:24] right to say well I don't know

[1:24:36] to verse
[1:24:39] 12 how many love the
[1:24:43] Lord 1 Samuel
[1:24:46] 16 verse
[1:24:51] 12 this is when Samuel

[1:25:20] into he made he have he hath made us

[1:25:25] how how there's an enemy wanting to stop
[1:25:28] that from coming to
[1:25:30] pass but he can't now listen verse 12
[1:25:34] and he
[1:25:35] sent and brought him in and he was Ruddy
[1:25:39] and with all the beautiful countenance
[1:25:42] and godly to look to goodly to look to
[1:25:45] and the Lord said arise anoint him for
[1:25:48] this is
[1:25:50] he then Samuel took the Horn of oil and
[1:25:53] anointed him in in the midst of his
[1:25:55] Brethren Hallelujah and the spirit of
[1:25:58] the Lord Came Upon David from that day
[1:26:01] forward so Samuel rose up and went to
[1:26:05] ramth
[1:26:08] now notice
[1:26:10] there what is this scene we we familiar
[1:26:14] with this story The
[1:26:17] Bible this is the
[1:26:20] time that Saul the great king
[1:26:25] had been rejected by God
[1:26:27] Amen and here Samuel the prophet of that
[1:26:32] hour

[1:26:47] anoint a king amen amen
[1:26:52] yes this is when he comes comes he he is
[1:26:56] anointing he came because God is going
[1:27:00] to set up his his
[1:27:03] kingdom when David is anointed king by
[1:27:06] Samuel he he doesn't come into His
[1:27:08] kingship right away does
[1:27:11] he no but he was already anointed
[1:27:15] king is that right now
[1:27:19] listen here's what we want to type out
[1:27:22] we want to look at this just for a few
[1:27:26] moments because in the message rejected
[1:27:30] King brother Raam says now he said
[1:27:36] Saul Saul
[1:27:38] [Music]
[1:27:39] sent the pieces of the ox to all Israel
[1:27:42] and said let every man that will not
[1:27:45] follow Samuel and Saul let him this be
[1:27:49] as this Ox is do you see how deceitful
[1:27:52] he tried to represent himself with the
[1:27:55] man of
[1:27:56] God how unchristian it was he's speaking
[1:28:00] of Saul the fear of the
[1:28:03] people was because of Samuel everybody
[1:28:07] hearing
[1:28:09] me the fear of the people was because of
[1:28:15] Samuel but Saul
[1:28:18] said whoever doesn't
[1:28:20] follow Samuel or me
[1:28:24] right will be like this ox and he cut up
[1:28:28] a an ox in pieces and sent them to all
[1:28:31] the people in other words we're going to
[1:28:32] chop them up
[1:28:35] right he says now
[1:28:37] notice but Saul got them all to follow
[1:28:42] him because the people feared Samuel let
[1:28:46] him come after Samuel and Saul how many
[1:28:50] times today have we heard we are the the
[1:28:54] great church the Church of God it makes
[1:28:57] the people get a fear and think that
[1:29:01] they really is where God is
[1:29:03] working they don't want the leadership
[1:29:06] of the Holy
[1:29:08] Spirit you understand they don't want
[1:29:11] the leadership of the Holy Spirit they
[1:29:13] rather they rather follow men because
[1:29:17] they like their own individual
[1:29:22] life they like to believe believe what
[1:29:24] they want to believe I'm
[1:29:28] quoting they like to believe what they
[1:29:31] want to believe do you see the holy
[1:29:35] spirit is our judge amen God never give
[1:29:38] us a pope or a bishop or anybody to
[1:29:41] judge he gave us the Holy
[1:29:45] Spirit Hallelujah that's why God told
[1:29:48] Samuel they haven't rejected you they've
[1:29:51] rejected
[1:29:52] me reject King The King theh rejected in
[1:29:57] the time of this of this hour when when

[1:31:58] denomination among you I don't care how
[1:32:01] sincere you are you take a man for your
[1:32:04] leader instead of the Holy Spirit to

[1:33:09] yes
[1:33:11] see he says how
[1:33:14] deceitful how unchristian it was the
[1:33:18] fear of the people was because of
[1:33:19] [Music]
[1:33:21] Samuel see trying to use the prophet
[1:33:24] name trying to use the message of the
[1:33:29] hour we should never use it for our own
[1:33:32] for our
[1:33:33] own
[1:33:36] fleshly motives and
[1:33:39] objectives we should never try to make
[1:33:43] that word fit us
[1:33:45] amen we should fit ourselves to that
[1:33:49] yeah right right is that righten he says
[1:33:54] in the rejected King he says he said
[1:33:56] what is the matter of God being our King
[1:33:59] well we don't see
[1:34:01] God said well I'm his
[1:34:04] representative have I ever told you
[1:34:06] anything wrong have I ever prophesied
[1:34:07] done anything has come to pass just as
[1:34:11] it said it would happen have I not told
[1:34:13] you the word of the Lord have I ever
[1:34:15] come to you and beg money from you I
[1:34:19] ever took anything from you have ever
[1:34:22] brought you anything straight but thus
[1:34:24] sayith the Lord God has Vindicated it
[1:34:27] every time that it was the
[1:34:29] truth amen he sent the thunderstorm and
[1:34:33] the
[1:34:34] rains you know the
[1:34:37] scripture there to prove the Samuel was
[1:34:39] God's mouthpiece as Samuel perfectly
[1:34:43] represented today the Holy
[1:34:47] Spirit the holy spirit is God's
[1:34:50] [Applause]
[1:34:52] mouth that speaks is exactly what the
[1:34:54] Bible
[1:34:56] said that believes just what he said
[1:34:59] amen am amen that won't vary from it but
[1:35:04] they wanted it with somebody who could
[1:35:05] tell them different the people could not
[1:35:09] say that Samuel's prophecy wasn't
[1:35:11] perfect they answered Samuel all that
[1:35:13] you have spoken in the name of the Lord
[1:35:15] has come to pass there's not one flaw
[1:35:18] you never did come to us and beg us for
[1:35:21] money you have supported your
[1:35:24] you''ve never asked us to do any great
[1:35:26] outstanding thing for you you've trusted
[1:35:29] in your god he has delivered you from
[1:35:31] all things and your words are true
[1:35:33] everything you spoke in the name of the
[1:35:34] Lord has been just as you said but we
[1:35:38] still want a
[1:35:39] king can you see the
[1:35:42] discrepancy the cunningness of the devil
[1:35:44] can work on a human being instead of
[1:35:47] yielding himself to the Holy Spirit to
[1:35:50] listen to what thus sayth the Lord is
[1:35:52] for a Pure Life undefiled character uh a
[1:35:56] see to be a a different life of peculiar
[1:36:00] people a holy nation and all acting
[1:36:03] people they'd rather they rather
[1:36:06] coincide with the world than act like
[1:36:08] the
[1:36:09] world Amen then to go to some church
[1:36:12] that says that's all right just act like
[1:36:15] that and go on can you see what it is
