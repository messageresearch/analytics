[0:12] Earth he is glorified of the
[0:15] father sits at the right hand of the
[0:19] Majesty to
[0:21] intercede is that right but he sends
[0:24] back the Holy
[0:25] Spirit to dwell in the
[0:28] church amen when
[0:31] John enters his
[0:33] vision amen Amen brother said the Book
[0:37] of
[0:38] Revelation is
[0:40] exactly in the correct place it's
[0:42] supposed to
[0:43] be it's the last
[0:46] book and it's the only book that Jesus
[0:49] wrote
[0:52] himself is that what he
[0:55] said amen that's the only book that he
[0:59] wrote
[1:02] himself
[1:04] Hallelujah that's
[1:08] tremendous he began to
[1:13] unfold that
[1:16] secret in the Book of
[1:19] Revelations through
[1:25] symbols John was seeing all of this he
[1:30] was hearing things and some of the
[1:32] things that he
[1:34] heard by this Angel by these Vision by
[1:38] this
[1:39] Revelation he wasn't allowed to
[1:43] write but he heard
[1:45] him he seen
[1:47] them amen you
[1:51] see the full
[1:54] Revelation was being
[1:56] given what was
[1:58] h in the father amen for all those
[2:04] years the mystery that was in the back
[2:07] part of God's
[2:09] mind that he could not give until the
[2:13] correct
[2:14] time oh brother but John saw our
[2:19] day John saw our mess hallelujah amen
[2:26] hallelujah hallelujah you see
[2:30] when you look at these
[2:32] things you begin to
[2:35] understand amen these
[2:38] Ministries were before the foundation of
[2:41] the
[2:43] world remember we spoke on the etern the
[2:46] seven SE coming from
[2:49] eternity brother these
[2:53] ministries predestinated of
[2:56] God they didn't start when they came to
[2:59] the Earth
[3:02] they already
[3:03] were amen amen so we can see that in the
[3:07] Book of
[3:08] Revelation amen that angel revealing
[3:11] that book to
[3:12] John and he is to be
[3:14] born 2,000 years
[3:20] later the one that's showing these
[3:22] things to John hasn't even come to the
[3:25] Earth
[3:27] yet amen
[3:32] amen amen amen the thing about it
[3:37] is when you begin to look you
[3:40] say this has to
[3:43] be
[3:45] divine you know revelation of
[3:48] God for for a man like this to take the
[3:52] mystery of
[3:53] God receive this
[3:57] amen and hold this
[4:00] mystery see and
[4:04] somehow by God's revelation and
[4:09] inspiration amen give this
[4:12] out and leave it in tapes and in
[4:18] books because he said take with Jesus
[4:22] this message will fall in the hands of
[4:24] the
[4:26] predestinated he knew there was coming a
[4:28] people that was going to take these
[4:31] things amen and the whole mystery was
[4:35] going to unfold to
[4:36] him when he was preaching those
[4:39] things he told the the Elder
[4:42] people amen amen that now we can look
[4:45] back and say they're they're they're the
[4:47] that old
[4:49] generation he said you're not supposed
[4:52] to
[4:53] give you're not getting it and you're
[4:56] not supposed to amen amen
[5:01] that's pretty hard words for the prophet
[5:03] to tell
[5:05] you but when he he's telling the people
[5:09] of that time that they're not supposed
[5:11] to catch
[5:12] it that's exactly what he
[5:16] means amen amen because there's coming a
[5:20] people amen a new
[5:22] generation see that's what people cannot
[5:25] accept people cannot accept the
[5:28] fact full revelation of
[5:32] God things that they could not tap
[5:36] into amen will just be
[5:40] open to the elect in the in the end
[5:44] time
[5:46] amen why because you're
[5:49] smarter no why because you study more
[5:53] than
[5:54] them no brother they they've had the
[5:57] message for 50 years and they've studied
[6:00] it 50
[6:03] years
[6:04] amen but how come somebody
[6:08] today can be catching a
[6:11] mystery in a few
[6:13] years amen hallelujah brother because
[6:17] this is the
[6:19] generation that he was looking
[6:24] for they will see they will recognize
[6:28] they will
[6:34] hallelujah it's such a
[6:36] privilege to live in
[6:41] this we can look back and see oh it was
[6:45] great
[6:46] times Amen
[6:49] brother what good would it have been to
[6:53] been in those great
[6:55] times and not have revelation that is
[6:59] open
[7:03] nowall you see when you're real close to
[7:08] something it's hard to
[7:10] distinguish what it is amen but once
[7:15] years go
[7:16] by amen once you look back and you check
[7:21] it through the
[7:23] scripture you you can see a a better
[7:28] panoramic of what what what was taking
[7:32] place amen amen that's why it's
[7:36] hard L the
[7:38] elders and they took a lot of
[7:40] things very
[7:42] caral very
[7:45] natural very Earthly
[7:48] minded brother but you had a prophet
[7:52] that was speaking things that he was in
[7:55] connection like we said this morning
[7:58] with another world
[8:00] hallelujah hallelujah he was uttering
[8:03] things says the book of Psalms that one
[8:08] day another
[8:10] day you know
[8:13] the and brother said
[8:17] amen I he said Luther walked in one
[8:21] life Wesley walked in another life
[8:25] amen he said Pentecostal walked in
[8:27] another l
[8:29] now here we're walking in another light
[8:34] he says that there's a
[8:36] generation after this one they'll have a
[8:39] greater
[8:45] light that's what I'm saying it's a
[8:49] tremendous time to live
[8:53] now we don't
[8:55] imagine that's why we we have to get we
[8:58] have to to get in tune
[9:02] connected with what the holy spirit is
[9:05] being it wants to give
[9:10] now another
[9:13] hours
[9:15] notice he said but as it was in the days
[9:19] of
[9:20] Noah amen how many
[9:23] know that this same scripture the same
[9:28] scene
[9:30] is given by Jesus in St Luke
[9:34] 17 when he is speaking of the son of man
[9:39] that was to come again and reveal
[9:42] himself as it was in the days of Noah
[9:46] and as it was in the days of
[9:49] L amen amen why is it then that when
[9:54] brother bam come on the
[9:55] scene and took those things he went to
[9:59] the the scripture and he brought out to
[10:01] us this is speaking of the ministry of a
[10:06] prophet that was not the son of man but
[10:10] the seventh angel was going to receive
[10:12] the
[10:13] ministry of Jesus Christ and he was
[10:16] going to reveal to the public the son of
[10:22] man is that right brother said there's
[10:26] where you have
[10:28] trouble separating the
[10:30] two and a lot of people do have
[10:33] trouble because they worship Him and
[10:36] they do all these
[10:38] othering his name then they end up some
[10:48] other
[10:50] amen the thing
[10:52] is when we look at this brother if Jesus
[10:55] is saying no man knows his
[11:00] secret
[11:02] but as it was in the days of
[11:05] no are what are you going to
[11:07] do if you hear him say
[11:10] that what are you going to
[11:14] do don't you think it would be a good
[11:19] idea to go back in the scripture because
[11:24] brother Adam said he was reading the
[11:27] same Genesis
[11:29] that you and
[11:31] I did Jesus read the book of Genesis
[11:34] that you and I
[11:39] read he read the same
[11:44] verses chapters the Same Book of
[11:48] Genesis he was reading he wasn't reading
[11:51] a different
[11:53] Genesis so when he said as it was in the
[11:55] days of
[11:56] Noah it's because he had been reading
[11:58] back there and knew that there was a
[12:02] mystery within that that was
[12:06] for the time of the
[12:10] revealing of this secret
[12:13] mystery is that right I read to you this
[12:17] morning amen the quote brother
[12:21] says a
[12:23] mystery of God
[12:26] revealed speaking of this scripture
[12:29] he says the great
[12:30] mystery of how it was a secret he kept
[12:34] it a secret nobody know nothing about it
[12:38] even the
[12:39] angels didn't understand it see he
[12:43] didn't reveal
[12:45] it that's the reason under our seventh
[12:50] mystery when the seven seal was
[12:53] open there was
[12:56] silence amen amen when the seven seal
[12:59] was open there was
[13:02] silence when Jesus was here on Earth
[13:06] they wanted to know when he would
[13:09] come he said it's not even the son
[13:14] himself don't know when he's when it's
[13:17] going to
[13:19] happen and God has all this to himself
[13:24] it's a secret and that's the
[13:27] reason
[13:30] that is the
[13:32] reason you understand for the
[13:40] silence what's the reason of the
[13:42] silence why when the seven seal was open
[13:46] in symbol form there was no symbol of
[13:51] it
[13:54] nothing why is it complete total
[13:57] silence because of this
[14:01] secret because of this mystery that the
[14:05] father had to himself and he says that
[14:08] is the reason there was silence in
[14:11] heaven for the space of half an
[14:13] hour seven
[14:16] Thunders ohu UT their
[14:20] voices wait a minute seven Thunders
[14:24] ain't in the book or they ain't in the
[14:27] chapter of Revelation
[14:31] seven are
[14:33] in yeah yep me another place where
[14:38] you'll find seven Thunders like
[14:41] that only chapter
[14:44] 10 the
[14:47] Earth
[14:49] Amen brother and
[14:51] sister brother is connecting this and he
[14:55] has showed us already we've preached it
[14:57] already
[14:59] amen amen but
[15:01] sometimes when the Holy Spirit wants to
[15:04] really get to
[15:06] something to prove amen by his word the
[15:11] hour we are
[15:13] in he has to bring it to us Amen in such
[15:17] a way that we're able to
[15:20] perceive what he is telling us and I
[15:24] hope that is that that's the
[15:27] case because brother this is this is
[15:30] really
[15:31] important when there was space of half
[15:34] an
[15:35] hour silence in heaven seven
[15:39] Thunders uttered their
[15:43] voes and John was forbidding to write
[15:47] it see it was the coming of the
[15:56] Lord so we see then
[15:59] hallelujah hallelujah that when you look
[16:02] at
[16:03] that and you and you come back to
[16:05] Matthew
[16:06] 24 we've never Ted this
[16:10] before Oh when you come back Matthew 24
[16:16] and you go into the seventh
[16:18] seal that Jesus
[16:20] preached he was in flesh amen
[16:25] amen you see what I'm saying
[16:30] amen was he in
[16:33] heaven oh no no he was on
[16:37] Earth speaking to
[16:40] disciples he said no man knoweth this
[16:44] great secret it's se but as it was in
[16:49] the days of
[16:51] no no was the
[16:54] sign
[16:57] before the
[17:00] destruction he is a sign before judgment
[17:04] the greatest sign that God send to the
[17:08] Earth before judgment how many know what
[17:11] it
[17:12] is it's
[17:15] Propet he is the
[17:19] sign of
[17:22] warning Hallelujah
[17:27] Jud dment is coming destruction is
[17:31] coming I've seen the
[17:35] vision great rain is coming it's going
[17:39] to destroy the Earth going to flood
[17:42] everything
[17:43] out he's going to destroy the whole face
[17:46] of the
[17:48] Earth people
[17:50] laugh people
[17:53] mock notice that while he is
[17:57] preaching there sons of
[18:00] God are in a backsliding
[18:06] condition Son of
[18:08] God yes and they drowned in
[18:13] the
[18:16] right sons of God backs chasing after
[18:21] half naked
[18:23] women
[18:25] amen amen amen they drowned in the FL
[18:31] Son by flesh
[18:34] mhm yeah yep is that
[18:37] right when you look at the
[18:42] mystery that's inside of there you find
[18:45] that brother tyes
[18:48] Noah in different
[18:51] ways amen amen you
[18:55] cannot enter into these things with the
[18:58] childish
[19:00] mind and only keep one
[19:04] type because
[19:07] then the types that he
[19:09] gave like for
[19:11] instance Mary is she a type of the
[19:15] Bride yes you see a type of the
[19:20] sh you see what I'm saying yes how can
[19:24] the same person in the scripture give
[19:27] two ties
[19:30] because that's how God's word
[19:36] is he said Mary is a type of
[19:39] bride receive the word from an angel she
[19:42] has to give birth to the second coming
[19:45] of Jesus
[19:46] Christ he typed it with Revelations
[19:49] 12 the bride giv him birth he Ted it to
[19:52] the
[19:54] Jewish Orthodox is that right amen amen
[19:58] and then he Ted it to the Pentecostal
[20:03] sh when when when she said your father
[20:07] and I have been looking for you said
[20:10] that's the
[20:14] shot the same person
[20:18] twoes look
[20:21] at what message that brother
[20:24] preached
[20:27] on I can do nothing about
[20:31] La will the church go before the
[20:36] tri and he said fire cannot fall from
[20:41] Heaven to destroy the Gentile
[20:45] World until the bride is taken in
[20:51] the did he type as
[20:54] bride there a lot of
[20:57] quotes you see but a childish mind will
[21:00] say no but he'll make that quote fight
[21:03] this
[21:05] quote that quot can't be right because
[21:07] this one says
[21:10] this no it all has its
[21:14] place
[21:16] amen you have to be careful when you're
[21:19] speaking on
[21:20] tipes yeah we spoke on this before amen
[21:24] amen for instance if you type
[21:27] Abraham amen you can type
[21:30] Abraham right he he came out of
[21:34] Babylon right justification
[21:38] sanctification baptism with the Holy
[21:40] Ghost is that right his name is changed
[21:44] he he he's he's taken
[21:47] elsh the breasted one he said that's
[21:50] Pentecost is that right amen and then
[21:54] what was the next thing he's visited by
[21:59] El inside of that body speaking to him
[22:03] by his new name is that right then his
[22:06] body
[22:07] Chang of is that right amen and then
[22:13] their body will change to receive the
[22:15] promised
[22:17] son said and we'll meet the promised
[22:20] son after our are
[22:23] changed in the air and right there the
[22:27] tight
[22:31] stops and then you keep going in the
[22:34] scripture and you go into ISAC and you
[22:37] find another
[22:39] type because if not if you continue the
[22:43] type then you're you're you're you're
[22:45] being
[22:46] told by God that in the in the in the
[22:50] wedding supper they got to grab Jesus
[22:54] from the table and go kill
[22:56] him
[22:58] right that's what you would be doing if
[23:01] you follow the Ty so you can't follow
[23:04] the typ and keep going and keep going a
[23:08] time has a beginning and it has an end
[23:11] and you stay within the
[23:13] tipe amen then and then you go into
[23:16] another time and you stay within the
[23:19] time you
[23:21] see so how come
[23:25] Jesus did not say as it was in the days
[23:30] of
[23:31] Enoch and as it was in the days of
[23:37] Abraham he could have said it he could
[23:40] have said it
[23:42] because and Noah were
[23:45] there and Abraham were there how Jesus
[23:49] didn't say as it was in the days of
[23:52] Enoch and as it was in the days of
[23:56] Abraham no you see it it's a
[24:00] secret but when the Prophet come he's
[24:04] the one that opened the
[24:05] secret he told us look Jesus said to
[24:09] look to the days of lot he said lot was
[24:12] inom amen but the elected group was out
[24:16] in the wilderness Hallelujah glory to
[24:20] God Amen they had nothing to do with s
[24:23] you see what I'm saying amen he said
[24:26] look at Noah type of the foolish bir
[24:29] that will go through the
[24:31] tribulation is that right he said type
[24:34] of the written of 144,000
[24:38] Jews amen that will go as a people
[24:42] through the
[24:43] tribulation amen amen he typed them that
[24:47] way they're types brother you can't get
[24:50] all pra about the
[24:53] types amen you just got to let the types
[24:55] speak for
[24:56] themselves because there's mystery
[25:00] secrets and let me say this every one of
[25:03] them T
[25:07] Christ if you can't find Christ in them
[25:11] types you're reading the Bible wrong
[25:14] that's right you can find Christ in a
[25:17] rock you can find him in a cloud amen
[25:21] you can find them in a
[25:22] rain you can find them in
[25:25] anything amen amen in nature God in his
[25:29] church God in his Universe amen you can
[25:34] see the first Bible written in heaven
[25:37] you can see the second Bible Enoch's
[25:40] pyramid and this is the third Bible
[25:43] brother said today people don't read
[25:47] their Bible so he's made you a
[25:50] Bible a
[25:54] WR Hallelujah
[25:56] Hu

[48:09] Sun advanced
[48:12] techology than what men have
[48:15] today amen you see and because of atomic

[48:28] of its
[48:29] orbit the same thing that will happen
[48:32] today said when these nuclear bombs go
[48:36] off it will shake it back to its

[50:46] the open those windows because when God
[50:50] first created the Earth he
[50:53] separated amen the waters

[1:03:13] life brought
[1:03:16] animals brought animals into the ark how
[1:03:21] much more the Holy Ghost is to bring men
