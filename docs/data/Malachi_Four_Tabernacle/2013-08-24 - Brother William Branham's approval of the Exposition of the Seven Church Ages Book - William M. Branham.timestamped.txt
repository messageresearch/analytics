[0:00] no blush walk if we draw the name of
[0:03] Lord Jesus Christ and this video wasn't
[0:06] done in spite any intention to should
[0:17] belittle anyone but it is an attack
[0:20] against Satan so this book is the entire
[0:23] exposition of the cemetery TV and I'm
[0:26] just gonna read quotes when are we to
[0:28] quotes and spread this in mind an adage
[0:32] befall at Ephesian Church age they were
[0:35] so in love with the message that if a
[0:37] man wasn't singing Paul said they would
[0:40] look at those false apostles and be like
[0:42] you're not single father therefore if
[0:43] your vows so how much more us who
[0:46] believe the message of the hour who
[0:48] follow the vindicated prophet brother
[0:50] branham right and I'm just gonna read
[0:53] two quotes and it's gonna blow
[0:58] the attacks against this book out of the
[1:00] water and because men and perhaps maybe
[1:04] women don't want to humble themselves to
[1:07] the Word of God that's the spirit of the
[1:09] age that's the spirit of the Antichrist
[1:10] it's to try to make try to make the word
[1:13] fit their doctrine and not make their
[1:16] doctor fit the word so we've always got
[1:18] to take it back to the message not take
[1:20] it back to what we believe what our
[1:21] pastor believes or what brother
[1:22] so-and-so believe what apostle so-and-so
[1:25] believes with teachers so-and-so all he
[1:26] knew brother drowned well he you know
[1:29] only the spread of administering for a
[1:30] long time well brother I don't care if
[1:32] it's not in line with what brother
[1:33] Branham said I'm sorry I don't want it I
[1:36] even have to test my own pastors
[1:38] revelation I gotta test my own
[1:39] revelation I gotta test my brother's
[1:41] revelation you know the pillar of fire
[1:42] overs that take photos and say oh I see
[1:44] I'm vindicated my brother if that light
[1:47] is not bearing a record to what this
[1:49] word says I'm sorry to differently as
[1:52] Paul says of an angel comes and preach
[1:54] another gospel then be cursed if anyone
[1:57] tries to bring anything outside of the
[1:58] message to be out here occurs rather
[2:00] random preach the pub preach but so in
[2:05] your clothes okay this is annoying ones
[2:08] Afghan time annoying the ones at the end
[2:10] time right so you can have all the
[2:12] emotion you can have all the anointing
[2:14] but what counts the most
[2:16] in this mess that she's telling them
[2:17] that's the word a worried the word the
[2:19] word this is our quote 1965 I know
[2:23] anyone's at the end time notice let me
[2:27] give you a little example look at those
[2:29] people who come under Moses prophecy
[2:31] come out of that organization and come
[2:34] out of everything under the prophecy saw
[2:37] the great works and wonders and things
[2:39] like that and come up to the borderline
[2:41] of going in now we pay attention is
[2:44] where the sisters now leave their it
[2:46] comes your name on the book see you've
[2:49] got it fixed down you've got to fix that
[2:51] okay you've got it free stuff and you
[2:54] that's not here
[2:56] and out in the on the up order the
[3:00] question about your name taken off the
[3:02] Lamb's Book of Life
[3:03] see it's puzzled a lot of Ministers but
[3:06] wait till you get the book so the way to
[3:09] get the book you'll understand it if you
[3:14] just got any lighting see so it's where
[3:20] the rent so if you got any lighting you
[3:21] you'll understand this book if not I
[3:25] guess you're in darkness I you know
[3:28] Donny that's brother branham's words
[3:30] it's harsh but the truth where the
[3:32] random says you can't feature the bright
[3:34] hard enough you can't so we got to make
[3:36] our revelation Fitness word not the word
[3:39] for us we're not trying to dress the
[3:41] word
[3:42] we're not dressing ourselves with
[3:44] ourselves or dressing ourselves with the
[3:46] word is where the word born bride right
[3:49] brother branham system this is powerful
[3:52] notice now you'll turn your head and
[3:56] won't even look at it if you don't want
[3:58] to see it he's telling you read this
[4:01] book
[4:04] I don't want to see it like my mother
[4:05] used to say you can't get blood from a
[4:08] turnip because there's no blood in it
[4:11] Wow now what's what's the blood it's the
[4:14] life of the Lamb
[4:15] Leviticus the life is in the blood so
[4:18] you can't Josh sorry
[4:21] oh I'm not sorry it's the word my last
[4:24] quote I try to do god is service without
[4:26] it being God's will
[4:27] sorry always it's right at the end of
[4:31] the church age we ve got the thing so
[4:33] the ecclesiastic still messed up until
[4:36] God sends a messenger which was our
[4:38] prophet brother branham revelation 7
[4:40] Malachi 4 luke 1730 okay and that's the
[4:43] message to that church then they take
[4:46] his message because he just gives a
[4:49] little while because he lives he just
[4:51] lives a little while and God then they
[4:54] take his message instead of carrying on
[4:57] with it with the rest of it
[4:59] carry on carrying it on with the rest of
[5:01] it they make a denomination you got to
[5:04] believe our belief I believe our
[5:05] doctrine my pastor stance my evangelist
[5:08] saw himself says brother so in those
[5:10] days I don't care what so in some sense
[5:14] this book is saying or what the message
[5:18] is saying
[5:22] okay
[5:24] and they make a denomination they make a
[5:27] denomination and then they come make
[5:29] another denomination another messenger
[5:32] take another one now when you take away
[5:34] the authenticity of this of this book
[5:36] and you take away its authenticity of
[5:40] this book your without even knowing
[5:43] you're making yourself the messengers
[5:45] engage his brother branham often just he
[5:48] he gave his approval on this book died
[5:51] years approval and what I'm about to
[5:52] read blows any doctrine any idea I
[5:58] didn't forget it awhile I'm sorry I got
[6:01] I got disabled or here my brother ran
[6:03] who said what I got what's the secret
[6:05] the word is in the bride she has the
[6:07] mind of Christ and she knows what to do
[6:08] with the word because we're anointed
[6:11] with the eagle anointing we can see the
[6:12] two spirits working in the church how
[6:14] the devil's against this book because it
[6:16] exposes them that's why it's called the
[6:17] exposition of the church ages it's
[6:19] exposing same from the church changes
[6:21] this is the consummation and the seven
[6:23] churches and the seals nor do you see
[6:25] the white horse rider being Christ here
[6:27] or rather random said that in the act
[6:29] and and when you preach there at church
[6:32] changes in the 60s and early sixties
[6:34] before the seals it talks about two
[6:36] Antichrist here not not the white was
[6:38] being writer being pressed okay
[6:43] you all seen in my book it'll be drawn
[6:46] out in the seven churches which he told
[6:50] me was he done that's capital H he told
[6:53] him Jesus Christ which I stand by as a
[6:57] witness to God to be judged at the day
[6:59] of judgment for you
[7:00] so the really Rams gonna be judged for
[7:02] this book it come from God not for my
[7:09] thinking hey that's it's my brother
[7:12] vales book I'm sorry brother the L will
[7:14] tell you he's probably never thinking
[7:16] like all brother Ram who's standing my
[7:17] brother branham announcing well better
[7:19] rarely think it's my book I just grandma
[7:22] ties it brother branham's likely but the
[7:25] Bragg will catch it
[7:26] I feel like speaking in tongues right
[7:28] now oh man
[7:31] not from I think he noticed you I
[7:33] thought I thought different from it if I
[7:36] was going to have my own thought
[7:37] my brother Jack told me about the angel
[7:39] there that that Christ was a glorified
[7:42] body but it wasn't it was showing that
[7:44] the message of being right the supreme
[7:46] being it was God see just the very thing
[7:50] I had been preaching from the word the
[7:52] word always bears record of the word
[7:56] hey let me read that again come from God
[8:00] not from Elkington it's that's a floor
[8:04] you gotta take the prophets word you
[8:06] need to take a man's word and like the
[8:09] Bible says to be carnally minded is that
[8:10] but to be spiritually minded it's
[8:13] liberating its life and I don't want to
[8:16] be carnal mind it that's what man-made
[8:18] interpretations ours to be karma Lena I
[8:20] want to be spiritually minded why is God
[8:23] as a providing place that's in Christ by
[8:27] the church by the pastor and it's in his
[8:29] word
