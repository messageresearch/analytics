TRANSCRIPT
========================================
woe woe to the inhabitant of the Earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpets of the Three Angels which are yet to sound you may be seated God bless reading of his word tonight amen how many you happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen amen I trust we come expecting to receive from him tonight his word be inspired by Revelation to our hearts amen amen we trust that if you in any way uh still have not understood what these trumpets are about or don't have a clue what it is I trust that the Holy Spirit give you that understanding it's just it's very simple it's just a subject that is uh not entered into to because of the statements brother Bron makes uh when he says that these seven trumpets have nothing to do with the church and it's concerning Israel so people immediately have nothing to do with it and it causes many to leave this subject alone or not even to look into it but when you look carefully you'll find that it is a mystery Amen in this great uh subject of the seven trumpets we want to begin by noticing here tonight and those of you who understand the difference between preaching and teaching you'll understand that this is teaching this kind of uh subjects it has to be brought in this manner that you would understand how exact the word is where exactly uh the scriptures tied together what brother Bram said concerning this subject and how it all ties in under a supernatural thing for the Bride of this last hour amen because it's always literal God deals with the Jews in a literal standpoint he always deals with him naturally he always dealt with him naturally he always will deal with him naturally but he deals with the Gentiles in a supernatural way he deals with us in a spiritual way he gave them a natural Temple he gave them a natural lamb gave him natural candlesticks gave him natural priests he gives us a spiritual Temple he gives us a lamb of God that was slave for the sin of the world understand he gives us a spiritual blood we don't have to be sprinkled by Blood literally we believe in the blood that was shed and that's the blood that cleanses us today it's a spiritual thing you understand and we Are Spiritual priests amen we are a spiritual House We Are Spiritual Temple we are the Temple of the holy spirit so all these things we can see that it is natural to the Jews and spiritual for the Gentile church so when we look when we're looking at this subject the seven trumpets we're looking at the literal thing that is has dealt and will deal with Israel and that in the natural standpoint then we are also seeing amen if you have by now already that this is dealing with the Gentile bride in the spiritual standpoint in this hour do you believe that say amen amen now just because this is teaching it doesn't mean that you don't have to interact amen we like interaction brother said shows that the holy spirit that is moving in your heart if you really believe that and you really have a conviction of that he said the holy spirit that wrote the word will say Amen to the word of God amen amen and it takes a real amen from the soul to show that evidence amen is that what the prophet said so God in his word amen God revealing his word and that same God is revealing the word if that Holy Spirit is in you it'll say Amen to his own word hallelujah hallelujah now we we want to see first of all how many know what the book of redemption pertains to the book of redemption is given to the human race in the beginning of Adam in the Garden of Eden because it is a title deed to the Earth you understand amen this is a whole purpose of how God is Redeeming the Earth he's redeeming his church by water blood and spirit he will redeem the Earth he's already brought water he's already shed blood upon the Earth and he will bring fire to cleanse it amen this is the same way the work of redemption he does to the personal believer amen so we see that the book of redemption it's a Plan of Redemption with three with a three-fold purpose amen and this book of redemption was lost in the beginning because Adam sin he disobeyed God amen so that book wasn't some literal book that he was carrying around amen it was a supernatural book because these is the thoughts this was is what was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world is is his Plan of Redemption so this went back into the hands of the original owner amen it was stayed there until the time that it was to be claimed back for Redemption purposes Hallelujah so first of all the Lamb of God Jesus Christ the son of God had to come to redeem us back to God by the blood of the Lamb there was no other way Redemption purposes but through the blood of God himself the book of Acts amen Paul says we are saved by the blood of God amenu and then we find that that was the very blood the very life of God himself it was zo that's what makes the blood of God and as we said earlier amen amen that is what cleanses us today not a literal sprinking of a blood it's the life of that blood that cleanses us from within hallelujah hallelujah and and what I just uh quoted to you that Paul says is the blood of God it's in the book of Acts chapter 20 amen verse 28 where he says take heed that to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers to feed the Church of God Amen which he had purchased with his own blood amen amen so it's the Church of God the one that he purchased with his BL it's the blood of God and it's the Church of God Amen that we're speaking of is that right so we see that then the blood of the Lamb God made man to pay the Supreme price Hallelujah and then when in Revelations chapter 5 you have to follow me quickly here amen then we see in Revelation CH 5 most of us know this but maybe there's a few here that would like to know what we're talking about have a clue but listen in rev chapter 5 we find that the the lamb John is crying and and he and he sees that there's one sitting on the throne and he has book in his hand brother tells us this was the original owner is that right the book went back to God and then John begins to cry and we see in verse four he weeps and he there's no one worthy to open the book then we see in verse five that one of the elders comes and tells him not to cry anymore because the lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David have prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals amen and then what he sees there is a lamb in the midst of the throne with seven eyes and seven hores of course this is symbolic but really it's the lamb that comes forth out of the intercessory throw to take the book out of the hand of the original said the lamb that took the book was the one that had been interceding for our sins for 2,000 years so it was not just a spiritual thing it was the actual body of the Lord Jesus Christ and have been interceed for me and you the church ages but now the time had come amen that he was to to come off of the throne Hallelujah after Serv Church changes and take the book Hallelujah and not only take the book but now he had to come down to the Earth to make claims of what's in the book in other words what's in the book amen needs need to be claimed because in there is his eternal box of redemption his attributes his children the Earth itself is in that book you understand not only people not only his church but the Earth also it's the title deed to the Earth amen and it's the book that's got the names of his people of his seed of his children I'm just trying to make it simple so we all can understand amen so then you see that now the lamb has to come down and begin this work on the earth you understand but he cannot come down in a physical form so then we come we come over now if you like to look there in Revelation 10 verse one then we find that it's a mighty angel coming down from heaven clo with the cloud and a rainbow is upon his head you understand and what does he have in his hand he has in his hand verse two a little book with the book is open and says it's the same book that was in rations 5 that was closed it was sealed and there was no one worthy to open it but the lamb came forth to take the book and broke the shields there but now we see that he had to come down to the Earth to make this work of redemption amen what he paid for 2,000 years in physical for now he's going to claim hallelujah amen in another form down here on the earth he is claiming his subject it's the ti amen not of paying the price for Redemption oh that's already been paid but now it's a time to claim what's in the book Hallelujah gory to God and not only that it's time to claim the Earth Oh Glory Hallelujah so he comes down in Angelic form this Mighty Angel brother Adam said is christu you say well I thought you just said that the lamb over there was Christ yes but this is his spiritual form hallelujah hallelujah this is him in the form of the great logos the the the the beginning of the creation of God amen Piller of fire amen coming down to do this work but then in this book in this form this angel had a a a mysterious way of speaking hallelujah amen amen and John heard what he was mysteriously saying and he was told not to write what this one says right here in verse three he cry cried with a loud voice that's when a lion roar amen am see amen amen and when he had Pride seven Thunders UT their voices and when the seven Thunders had out their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying to me seal up those things which the seven thund uttered it right them not see how simple that is hallelujah so he's not permitted to write these mysterious things that this Mighty Angel is speaking Christ himself John hears it amen amen he's in a vision but he's not permitted to write because in the whole book of Revelations he's just writing what he hears and what he sees understand so then what does the scripture say it says that this Angel put one foot on the lamb one on the sea lifted up his hand sweared by him that liveth forever and ever that time should be no longer then what is verse 7 say you see we in the message we just hear Revelation 107 Revelation 107 what is it mean it's not just a quot just a scripture it's not just like you hear everybody you know in Christian Church say John 3:16 John 3:16 amen M what is John 316 you see it's not just something to quote or learn or know it it it means something so Revelation 10:7 says that this that John wasn't permitted to write in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sh the mystery of God would be almost finished it doesn't say that right maybe I'm reading wrong it says the mystery of God would be finished as he have declared to his servants the prophets amen amen so you see then that's where the prophet of the age brother Bram his ministry was speaking these things that the angel was speaking and John heard and he wanted to write see but in the days that this message would begin to declare amen amen those hidden things amen amen because it would be the end time M amen would be finished because in there is where the the the power of Revelation is hallelujah hallelujah that's where there is something that was to come in the last days Jesus called it the spirit of truth and the spirit of Truth would lead us to all things it would show us all things it would reveal to us all things it would show us the plan of God it would show us the plan through the Earth would show us the plan for our Liv it would show us the The Plan of Redemption who we are and where we come from and what we're doing here and why were we born in this last day and why is the world going to end and why is there so much Evil all of these things are in the message of the hour amen but it must be received by Revelation it takes the same listen to me it takes the same spirit that was giving it through the prophet and takes that same power to reveal it to you Hallelujah it takes the same anointing it takes the same Angel it takes the same power it takes the same Revelation it takes the same anointing Amen to reveal it to you see and that's why we must look for that we must seek for that we must want to have a desire in our hearts amen a hunger to know these things amenu and that's why when we begin to understand a little bit we begin to hear a little bit of what this is then we want to know more amen then we want to know more then we want to know more and more because God begins to renew our minds says the Bible amen amen all his word so listen a part of that Plan of Redemption amen amen where where is the Plan of Redemption here in the book of redemption you with me tonight so part of that plan remember the book was seal with Seven Seals right part of that plan is called ages amen hallelujah part of what was in there is called ages but that's just a terminology that's just a name that is given to dispensations that have already passed from the days of Paul to now we know that because a Prophet come and showed us what that was but I want you to understand something tonight I want you to understand one thing that when you look at the ages you have to have you have to know this amenu what do you have to know that that is part of the Plan of Redemption and that part has already unfolded itself you understand that is something that was inside of the book amen part of the plan is called seals amen part of the plan it's called V amen see but just like you you might say well what's vies the same thing like someone else that don't know what ages is will say what's ages amen because they don't know you see what I'm saying but people it seems on the message all they all they want to know and all they know is just ages amen amen then when you then okay ages yeah I know ages I'll tell you messenger how many ages there is I'll tell you the dates I'll tell you what happened they know that you see what I'm saying but talk to somebody about seals see it's part of the plan no no that's too deep why too deep it's part of the plan the ages is deep for some people out there that don't know nothing about it amen amen they'll probably look at you like you some kind of you know Bible teacher in college or something if you begin to tell them see there's Church seven Church age look right here in the Book of Revelation two you know who that angel was Paul say what you talking how do you know how do you make that interpretation that doesn't say that Paul is there it doesn't say Paul's name there right how do we know how do we know a Prophet come to open that part of the mystery you understand I'm just trying to make this as simple as possible because it it seems as though when we mention seals B TR people oh what's that it's part of the plan Hallelujah see amen part of the plan what's part of the plan part of the Plan of Redemption Hallelujah and part of that plan is called Ages part of that plan is called seal that plan is called trumpets wow seven Thunder is what reveals the continent Hallelujah of the entire booku am did you get that am the seven pns is what reveals the entire continent what contained in the entire book Hallelujah so it takes those seven thund it takes that super natural Revelation Hallelujah to let you know amen the mystery is finished for many the mystery still ain't finished Revelations 10 says it would be finished but how come people are still waiting for something else because it ain't finished for them but yet the finishing is already finished it's the message of the Hallelujah did you understand you understand what I'm saying right how come people are still waiting the mystery of God to be consumed you see what I'm saying it's already consumed and then someone might ask them what is it well that's the thing amen what it is has got to be revealed to you right so hallelujah amen glory to God when God brings the full word full Revelation by the by that Holy Ghost Power the seven thund of God then you know you know not everybody you know Myst is finished hallelujah hallelujah amen amen to God you understand say amen amen but people get caught up with symbols they get caught up with terminology they get scared just when you mention Thunders oh what's that oh what's you see amen notice if we look back in the Old Testament in the life of Abraham in Genesis you'll find the church ages amen hallelujah how do we know that has the mystery been opened amen you can look at the life of Abraham in the Book of Genesis and you can read chapter 12 amen and you can know that's justification that's Luther you can read chapter chapter 15 hallelujah amen and you can know that that's Wesley Wesley that sanctification amen amen and then you can you can read in Genesis 17 and another as the great El sh the almighty the power of Pentecost the restoration of the blessings of Pentecost the restoration of the gifts amen amen but how come you can see that AMJ it doesn't say Pentecost in Genesis 17 it doesn't say Church ages from chapter 12 to to chapter 17 amen hallelujah but those things are terminologies ages is a terminology of an [Applause] occur right Hallelujah seal is a terminology it's a name that's given to something that has taken place Hallelujah so whether you call it what all that's taking place or you just call it ages see instead of having going through the whole description amen you just say Seven Ages and while you say Seven Ages it covers everything that happened within the Seven Ages hallelujah amen you understand hallelujah hallelujah then when we see in Genesis 18 God coming down in a man the form of a prophet so Abraham give him the last sign before the change they receive the body the change of their bodies to receive the promised son then you know there's brother R's ministry right there did you know that that we have to receive a change of our body Bible doesn't say they receive a change of their body but it does describe Sarah at 9 something years old going down there with Abraham to care and falling in love a king with a lot of money falling in love with an old granny she wasn't no old granny her body was changed Hallelujah again but it doesn't come out and tell you was an old granny or she was young she just tells you it just tells you how old she was but that's how the Bible is you little details that only by Revelation for you can pick those things up and see that it's in there amen so you can say change the body amen and then she had seven more children Abraham had seven more children after that amen amen yes see then you can type Isaac as when we will receive Jesus Christ in the air you understand it's the same mystery that's over here in Revelation is the rapture in Revelation it is the body change in the Book of Revelation yes it is is the church ages in the Book of Revelation you see what I'm saying it's the same thing that's over here in Genesis just with different Nam different stories different things that what it's speaking over here in Revelation it's the same thing it's the mystery this is what this message come to reveal to when you listen to the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother brandom says this great mystery is what God has showed through every type in the Bible every person in the Bible every story in the Bible was speaking of this see then you won't read it like some little Sunday School like a cute little story you'll read it by Revelation amen you see what I'm saying now look this is why it's types Shadows symbols examples amen hallelujah just like when we spoke of Joseph they get himself known to his brothers it doesn't say uh Feast of atonement right but that's what it was see Joseph's brothers being gathered back to him it's the Feast of the trumpets but it doesn't say that in the Genesis account no no but in Revelations it's called ages it's called seals it's called trumpets see it's part of the plan it's part of the mystery you understand say Amen all right so that's why since we've been on this subject of the seven Trumpets the seven trumpets seems to be very a very my serious subject to many because of the statements that brother Bram made when he said it has nothing to do with us that's what he said he said us then he also said it has nothing to do with the church Etc he said it pertains to Israel amen amen the people say Okay trumpets pertain to Israel has nothing to do with me although that's part of the mystery listen now trumpets is part of the mystery amen you see and the whole mystery has to be finished amen hallelujah to who to the one that is to be redeemed see amen then brother let me read those statements brother right here in the message Fe of the trumpets 44 he says he says now coming to this part here the preaching of the seven trumpets I thought well I'll not try to think anything I'll just wait till that time and let him reveal it to me then yesterday when I went into the room wondering why they before yesterday to try to understand it was there where the Holy Spirit open this opened up this to show me the reason that it it is not profitable even for the CH church at this time hello it's not profitable even for the church at this time it cuz it has nothing to do with the church at all Fe of the trumpets paragraph 145 now the reason that these seven trumpets does not apply to this church and this age is because it's to Israel only it's the calling the Gathering of the people now there's only one significance in here that I want to get to in a few minutes is where you'll see why this doesn't apply to this age that we're living in the seven trumpets amen amen you see so okay people say well it doesn't pertain to the church doesn't pertain to this age I care about this is why because of these statements amen amen it cause many to not even look at the subject it causes many not even to get into this subject Hallelujah but when you look carefully Hallelujah amen amen later on he says about a few months after he made those statement recognizing your day and its message Hallelujah he preached after the Feast of the trumpets and he said he revealed to me that the seven trumpets sounded under the six seal and I preached it supernaturally he said see it's the hand of God the whole thing it pertains to Israel and we picked it up under the Sixth Seal you all have that how the persecution of the Jews amen hallelujah so then he he brings in now that there's a supernatural Revelation Hallelujah within the Sixth Seal and this is why that statement alone is what is what moved me to look into this but then we F that was 64 then we find after returning from Africa from returning from Africa brother BR amen amen in 65 he wants to set up meetings now to speak on the Trumpets on the listen and the Thunders okay hallelujah what the bride is supposed to hear the Thunders so that her heart can be changed her house her heart ain't changed that's what the prophet said amen the only way that Malachi 4 can be fulfilled is for you to hear the thunder amen amen amen that's th say the prophet which is th say the lordu amen so he says I want to tith I'm going read it to you right now but he says I want to preach on the trumpets I want preach on the vs CU he hadn't preached on them or he did but Supernatural and he says I don't want to preach on the Thunders amen another Supernatural Revelation also and TI in together now he's going to tie in together the trumpets the vs and the Thunders I thought it has nothing to do with the church careful amen I thought it has nothing to do with this then why is he going to tie the Thunders for is the Thunders for the Jews careful how you answer amen look at the message the God of this evil age this is 65 he says now in doing this I have come here for a purpose of teaching the last BS seven BS the last seven trumpets and the last seven thunders of The Book of Revelation tying them together in this hour Hallelujah that we're now living oh in this hour that we're now living to follow the opening of The Seven Seals and the Seven Church in other words I already preached ages prach the the seals amen and this is what follows the introduction quote that I read to begin this subject with amen out of the Ages come the seals out of the seals amen come the trumpets out of the trumpets come the V right see am hallelujah what else did Brother Bram say the message of Shame he says so we will set up those VES and those trumpets and I want to place them in they come under another thing so does the vows come over the sounding of the trumpets but we want to take the entire course right straight through and bring it and tie it in together says it again hallelujah amen amen and the message thinking man's filter he says I'm anxiously waiting for the hour so we can all congregate in one place and preach on those seven PL which are in the vows and the trumpet and so forth they all happened right in a cluster that's the reason it'll take us about a week 10 days or more to get through it in one single meeting we can I think it's very sufficient all right so we see now amen amen that if we don't follow the further statements he made about the trumpets amen amen you'll stay with the idea amen that just leave it alone amen but catch what he said under inspiration is not profitable for the church at this time wasach that Revelation was not profitable for the church at that time amen but now it's profitable Hallelujah because they didn't even have a clue what the seven Thunders was he told them don't even try to get into it just live a good Christian Life and wait and then God will send it [Music] later amen those to show it had to be until this hour it had to be until this time he said when would it be revealed just before or right around the time that Jesus comes for his hallelujah hallelujah glory to God you understand now so brother looking into this now we have we have realized amen amen in the past Services now that there has been something [Applause] Supernatural taking place by revelation of the Holy Spirit stay exactly with the message of the hour we see the Holy Spirit taking the scriptures and making them so BL to us as he said the spirit of truth will lead you into all Truth at the opening of The Seven Seals that's Supernatural power brother regardless of what anybody else thinks whether they want to believe it or don't want to believe it whether they want to realize that God is still doing something Supernatural today the same anointing that made the prophet preach him supernaturally it's the same anointing that it's here to reveal it to you if you want in a supernatural way Revelation is not natural Revelation is Supernatural Hallelujah flesh and blood cannot give you Revelation it takes the spirit of God and the the spirit of God is in a realm that's not natural hallelujah it's a supernatural act of God to give you Revelation hallelujah hallelujah so regardless of what anybody else says thinks it's supernatural Hallelujah to see the revelation of what is in the things and this is to confirm to us that we have been called according to his purpose Hallelujah predestinated to be conformed into the image of Christ that's what the Bible say hallelujah hallelujah let's turn to the Book of Romans chapter 8 Romans chapter 8 and we read [Music] here 28 29 and verse 30 we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose for whom he didn't for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son amen that he might be the first born among many Breen [Music] for moreover hallelujah amen whom he did predestinate to be conformed to the image they be also called amen and when be called they be also Justified and whom we justifi and he also glorify so what is this showing us this is showing us something if God is revealing himself supernaturally to your heart and you really understand me amen amen I Supernatural Revelation not cuz you're some kind of smart intellectual I mean person I'm not trying to say you're not smart you understand what I'm saying amen but in other words you don't have to go to a Bible College and study the Greek language study the Hebrew study to see if the verses are right and that word's not right that word well it's all right but it's not that verse we don't even know if it was there in the original manuscripts just wasting time amen amen it takes Revelation hallelujah hallelujah God has put into our hands what finishes the mystery of this whole thing right here in the days of the voice the seventh angel we shall begin to sound the trumpet the mystery of God will be finished like I said earlier someone might ask what is it that's thing that's thing but we have in our hands we have it in book form in tape form we have it in all kinds of forms it's in our hands hallelujah hallelujah but that just by reading it intellectually ain't going to help you either because the Bible says Paul says when Moses is read the veil is still on their face he says but when ye shall turn to the Lord that ve that doesn't let you see amen a natural sight can see the letter but a supernatural SES got to see the meaning behind it the inspiration the Revelation amen hallelujah then when you turn to the Lord Paul said and be converted that Veil will be taken off amen it takes the Holy Spirit now notice hallelujah hallelujah amen that's Supernatural that power revealing it regardless of what anybody else thinks it's supernatural I believe that this is to confirm to us that we have been called according to his purpose so that there won't be a doubt in your heart Hallelujah that you have been called called according to his purpose it confirms to us the Covenant that God has made with this Plan of Redemption I have promised I have swore amen that I will do this and this and this and God's word will never fail hallelujah amen he's going to redeem a PR he's going to save a bride he's going to transform a bride amen he's going to have a church without SP he's determined he has SW he has promised glory to God and there's not enough power in this world or enough power in Hell or enough anything to stop that word from coming to pass amen and there's got to be somebody that's to receive it there got to be somebody that's knowing what God is doing in the last day that's got to be sbody that truly knows why God sent a prophet why God sent a message why God sent us Tes why God sent us books amen amen hallelujah to make some tradition it ain't to just make us some other denomination and just quot without understanding like everybody else hallelujah amen the only difference is that they quote say John 3:16 you quote Mali 4 R 10 but it's the same Spirit the bride ain't under that Spirit bride is under the spirit of Revelation under the spirit of Christ see under the revelation of what God is given through the message hallelujah amen glory to God and it ain't just one scripture or two scriptures it's the entire mystery that means that that doesn't mean you have to read the whole Bible now I don't even think I've done that amen I've read I don't know a lot of it hallelujah amen but I've never said well I'm going to read from Genesis Revelations I can understand it you know you need I had Brothers tell me I did that in jail didn't [Music] work still didn't understand amen not about reading everything it's about whatever you read you understand that's the difference that means that what everything you do read Spirit of Christ will reveal to you message of the hour hallelujah amen that's the difference that's why remember the book of Acts that un amen amen from queen Denise yes in the Bible he was one of her guards one of her security amen amen he was reading the book of Isaiah didn't know a clue what he was reading that right amen just reading reading then hallelujah amen Philip was translated in the spirit amen and then talked to him and said you understand what you're reading I'm reading it but I know what it means remember that story Hallelujah he says I have I I need someone to show me amen amen he said well that's speaking of Jesus Christ that was to come pay the Propet die amen for your sins see then he he commanded us to baptize Hallelujah in his name that whosoever shall be baptized shall be saved he said here's water to be baptized heaped see because someone had to show what was in there one that was under that Revelation preach that in the message of God amen amen and he said that God is the holy spirit now notice he says oh brother Bram says that this revelation of this mystery this thing that the angel was speaking in Revelation 10 that John wanted to write this thing that is called a terminology that the Bible uses seven Thunders just made it real simple for us say what that means means that God is speaking that's all it means the voice of God when Jesus was here on the earth he was praying he was getting ready to be crucified he said father I know that my time is coming amen for me to be turned into the hands of sinful men this ISS in the book of St John 12 he said my heart is troubled he says but I know I've come to the Earth for a purpose he said that's to glorify thy name I have glorified thy name hallelujah amen and he said Lord just be with me and he was praying and God answered back what God said to him he heard God's voice God said to him was I have glorified it and I will glorify it again simply what God Said but the people that were around there around the area they didn't hear that all they heard was some Thunder others said no no I didn't hear thunder what did you hear I heard like some blast go off mother said no I I think an angel spoke but I don't know what he said amen see everybody had their idea of what had happened but since it was only to Jesus only Jesus heard what he was really saying to others it was just a thunder noise or just something else and that's what this is the Bible calls it seven thund but what it really is is the voice of God speaking Hallelujah see amen hallelujah so notice when we understand them that it's by these seven Thunders that is what's turning our hearts back to the faith of the fathers brother Adam said so that the world can hear again directly from God he said the bride which is the believing Church in the last days after the prophet is off the scene he said the bride is to be the final voice to the final Hallelujah not my words prophet's words under her message in other words she can't say something outside that the message says when you're under something you got to be under it it's under Authority Under subjection amen amen so notice In This Very hour this great Revelation being made known to us breaking on us we are being caught up in the mystery of the seven SE which is the coming of the lord we are being taken spiritually into a perfect Face Paul said when that which is perfect is shall come that which is in part just a partial understanding CU Paul and he had he had a great a great amount of it but there were still some things that was still kind of dark them to him he said when that which is perfect is come we shall see face to face we shall know as we were known Hallelujah brother Ram said when you leave Hallelujah that old condition when you leave the things of the world said when you leave that denomination when you leave that chicken cop where they only feed you all

is God showing these things for why is he revealing the things that is already in there for he has a purpose and it's for you it's for you it's for me hallelujah it's for whoo will and when we hear that word we must know that's the word of God we must realize that word is being said for a purpose because my heart needs to be turned back God wants to bring it to an atmosphere he wants to bring you to condition he's trying to show me that judgment is coming that God is a god of Grace God is a god of love but he's a god of [Applause] wrath and this demonic generation don't know God Amen but they'll know his wrath one of these days when the Judgment begin to fall down and then the Bible says that they still will repent they blashe God because of the plags that fall on them amen that's is such a condition the world has got into but this is all by mind control Hallelujah this is all by what has been done amen preparation to send people into a spiritual prison they can't get out of the

bread that means rotten amen moldy upon mine Altar and ye say wherein have we polluted thee in that ye say the table of the Lord is contable brother God is speaking here to a people who just came out of captivity in Babylon we preached on that before showed you that Malachi and Zariah and Hagi and Nehemiah and all these men the Bible speaks of were contemporary in other words they were at during the same time living when Israel had come out of Babylon in the days of Daniel God revealed to Daniel there was only two years left Amen to come out of Babylon and he was reading the the Prophecies of Jeremiah Jeremiah had already prophesied be in Babylon before they were taken and they said they'll be there 70 years so Daniel begin to make some calculations amen from the prophecy that was given so when they were taken and he count and there was 68 years they begin to tell the church we're about to leave it's time to go back amen remember what I told you about reading stories and finding the mystery we'll find the mystery in it 70 years is seven decades which means seven Church agents and when the church agents is over to take a group of people out of captivity of mystery Babylon not natural Babylon mystery Babylon which is a denominational system which is the world going to bring us out of that spirit and bring us back to where we come from where we were taken away from which was Jerusalem from above Hallelujah they were taken to Jerusalem naturally we got to take to Heavenly places in Christ which Paul said in Galatians that Jerusalem from above Amen in the church amen which is mother of us all Hallelujah so when we come back to Jerusalem now God has brought us by this message out of out of Babylon and what happens now I'm trying to show you that this chapter right here it's not speaking of Baptist it's not speaking to Methodist it's not speaking to Pentecost it's speaking to people in this message that are no longer in Babylon the 70 years have gone we have been brought back now and the Babylonians had destroyed they had destroyed the temple amen amen when then they took him captive that's exactly what the Catholic Church did to the spiritual Temple when they took the church under that spirit and made it captive Hallelujah under a Babylonian spirit amen what did they do they destroyed the temple spiritually speaking amen Paul said I laid the foundation others are to come and build on it amen and that's what we began over there with the first church but what did Babylon do they destroyed it hallelujah hallelujah and they took the church captive so now when they come out of captivity back to Jerusalem the Temple's in Ruins not only Temple but their homes are in R nobody's lived in that City for 70 years there's grass R all over the place amen it's desolate it's in Ruins we understand imagine the condition of the city with people Haven lived there 70 years amen it's going to take some work it's going to take some dedication you understand it's going to take some cooperation amen hallelujah hello somebody knock knock who's there am you see what I'm saying hallelujah and they're supposed to come back to the same routine that was established to begin with but look according to the Book of Exodus and Leviticus when the priests how many know that we're all supposed to be preached according to the Bible amen hallelujah hello somebody if the priest that was to take the bread put it on the altar of God according to the law that was given to Moses they they they already knew that it's not that they didn't know they knew amen amen but they had lost dedication they had lost sincerity Hallelujah we know you know you know the message said we're supposed to bring clean bread have so and so bake it and keep baking it every day that to do this continue that was wasn't just every Sunday there had to be one in his place making bread forever had to be another in his place bringing bread to the altar amen there had to be another one that would like like the fire to be another one that did this another one that did that look at the condition they bring polluted bread to the altar why amen if you offer the blind for offer the blind for sacrifice is it not evil if you offer the lame and sick is it not evil offer it now unto thy Governor will he be pleased with thee or accept thy person sayith the Lord of hosts amen amen in other words try to do that to your boss accept amen amen but to God we don't want to give our best we don't want to give our best we know we can give our best but we just bring a a a blind sacrifice

bring from his flock or buy it amen amen and buy the best that he could see God don't ask you to buy anything God just ask you for you to be the sacrifice the Bible says to offer our spiritual sacrifice to God hallelujah a reasonable service reasonable not unal irrational Hallelujah stand your feet see verse n now I pray you beseech God that he will be gracious unto us this has been by your

try to produce in the house of God it's in [Applause] vain if it ain't from my heart brother Ram said formality is to conform yourself to some traditional way of worshiping God Pentecost made it a tradition to dancing service every day every time they come methodus made a custom to come and sleep in church every time they come both are wrong you understand it's invading to come that way sir brother said come to the house of God to sleep he said go stay home and sleep that's what the prophet said the prophet said if your children can't behave themselves in church home the prophet said we come to the house of God to worship God to hear the word to be in his presence amen hallelujah hallelujah everything else is in vain Hallelujah we've got to come with sincerity we've got to come with our Full [Music] Hearts hallelujah hallelujah see neither do you K fire on my Altar for not have I no pleasure in you neither will I accept an offering at your hand for from the rising of the sun oh

weariness it is it you have snuffed as at it sayith the Lord of host he brought that which was torn and the and the lame and the sick thus he brought an offering should I accept this of your hand say the Lord but cursed be the deceiver amen which hath in his flock of male and boweth and sacrifices unto the Lord a corrupt things for I am a great king says the Lord of hosts and my name is Dreadful is that right did not Jesus say amen amen there was a people that because of tradition amen they had made the word of God non effect yes is that right yes they make it a tradition and Jesus said well did Isaiah speak of thee he said there is a people amen amen who with th with their mouth they worship they honor me see but their hearts are far from Mark 7 verse he answered and said unto them well have Isaiah prophesied of you Hypocrites as it is written this people honor me with their lips but their hearts is far from me how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men it's a vain worship God don't accept that he only accepts the only worship he accepts is what comes by the way that he has provided he has provided a way for us to approach him and that's the way of the blood that's the way of of confessing our sins that's the way of repenting that's the way of confessing in the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah that when we come into the service those things are under the blood you understand anything outside of that I don't care what light fire you light what L you bring the lamb is blind the sacrifice is laid hallelujah hallelujah it's not whole it's got a blemish in it hallelujah hallelujah it's not pure it's not whole Hallelujah You' got to pay a price to bring a whole sacrifice and what price is that a money Hallelujah the price is surrendering the price is confessing the price is yielding to God hallelujah hallelujah that's the [Music] price are we willing to pay it Hallelujah are we willing to buy that kind of of sacrifice to bring to the house of God or we just here because we're supposed to be oh Lord oh we just here because well it's it's Sunday guess I have to be in church amen amen we've got to

yes sir am it's useless it's it's in vain amen amen and that's where we've got to we've got to realize that we all have a part amen amen we all have just like in the temple they all had a part yes sir one would bake the bread one would put it on the altar the other one would do this the other one would do that you understand Hallelujah and that's what we're here for yes sir that's what we're here for that's the reason why God is demanding this God is telling us God is speaking to us amen the purpose the reason the motive the objective what's behind all of this Amen Let Us bow our heads Hallelujah
