americans yes amen i want you to catch something what made jesus the body is amen acts chapter 3. he had to go to all the prophet is listen this is wrong what he's manifesting himself in a certain form it is god himself yes baseball in that foreign jesus did this is mhm you know what foreign see in union god was in christ god anointed christ to is whatever it might be all amen i mean there is nothing my nana that can make it run but him whether it's god the father that is the holy ghost whether it's angels he says because all things consists by him he is the head of the body the church he is the beginning the first born from the dead amen that he is in control of all oh yes is hello foreign is i want um amen that never happened at no other time you see what i'm saying because i was telling you this morning that these seven spirits of god says what is it yes brother said it's not that god has seven spirits spirit of god given a certain anointing for a certain age and those in that age live under that anointing and that is the portion of the holy spirit that god is giving to them for that age but i said ah and he gave seven of those of one spirit he gave seven anointing for seven church ages but when the church changed uh that's what we have to realize that in the body of christ in the bride and i know yeah there's no force i didn't make that up don't even think read christ is a mystery god reveal see what he says about when better peace and respect he says all fools with gloves in her mouth indeed could be that same formula amen amen is that right yes see you can be annoying amen for the lord just like he was anointed is manifesting itself through the body you're gonna have an attribute of display of gabriel all right you're gonna have an accurate display rock foreign is you see brother and sister anyone else listen oh twelve remember we were speaking about how he delivers the names then verse three says the body shall shine as the blackness firmament and shall turn to the righteousness of the stars forever he says without that shut the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to enforce shall be increased the one on this side of the bank of the river the other on that side of the river back to the river i once said to the man clothed in linen otis abraham odin linen which was upon the waters of the river how long shall it be to the end of these wonders and i heard the man clothed in linen which is upon the waters of the river when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever shall be for time times and when he shall accomplish to scatter the power of the holy people all these things shall be finished according to that very word verse 7 when he had accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people that means that all the jews amen amongst many purposes amen does the angel of the lord have many purposes yes hallelujah and his vision to the bride he has a lot of purposes hallelujah one of the purposes is to anoint them is that one of the purposes of but i want to filter it through this ac this scene that daniel is seeing right here is hey what that book is illegal oh my god is that right but that was sent down to the seventh frame amen and then that same amen glory amen like our sister event the other day right in the bible amen come on glory glory hallelujah digest the book amen eat the words eat the bread is to preach to a certain people in the revelation of the entire thing you understand emotionally they're giving power to deal with 144 but what pertains to them 144 pounds takes place now returned to their homeland that's when this mystery first mistake would be made in office when did they return at the end of 1945 is the see that's that that's what makes a difference as far as that but as far as the angel of the lord went down to the earth he's never left here upon the earth but as far as the fullness of seven seven spirits so this people's house are together we're not coming down of the lord amen that's great hallelujah what does he say anything amen first one and after this thing i saw another angel stand four angels standing in four corners of the earth that's standing like this on four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth anybody knows what point mean winds mean in the bible means warning oh oh he will meet jesus jesus millennium so within those 70 weeks for the jews gabriel gabriel has six purposes tennessee's propositions in the middle east that he had reconciliation reconciliation he is is also the temple of god is oh he it's all connected together amen it's on the earth to investigate to see if these things are going then he not only connects it to all these ones he connects us to genesis 18. he's killing them right i mean now look at ten and six automated ds6 dsa it's body what's right burrow space appearance of lightning eyes light supply arms feet cutter to polish brass voice uh as words like the voice of the movie behold a certain man clothed in what later rolling linen whose lines regard the fine full you pass but yeah it right i was thinking about it is it the same man 12. is it the same angel do you want him of revelation 7 amen blanco in a cloud amen oh my god brother what is the class it's the glory of god that's the word that's what he's trapped with the clouds perfection is hello money hallelujah oh amen six men live toward the north every man have a slaughtered weapon in his hand and one man among them cruel with linen with the riders equal by side and they went and stood beside the brazen altar camino de la puerta and the glory of the of the god of israel was gone up from the chair whereupon he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed with linen which had the writer's equine by his side and said and the lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of jerusalem on the floor is the men the sign cry for all the abominations that done in the midst thereof the holy ghost foreign no matter how much a member say was that no matter how many things they had done he said a man with the writers record dress in white linens which represented the amen he was near foreign and one other part of is his shoes there was it father was evil he says the angel of the lord he will not be listening taking me out you're taking me to a real bright stream of water the waters of life just like rebecca what's going on just like mary maria and he says it is it was the most beautiful blue water and great fish in his face we're swimming around in it he said i will make you official and he said now cast your lure into the water all right you believe that's the same jesus that after he rose from the dead he told is like joseph smith come on jose smith he said i don't doubt though but he wasn't scripture and jesus said amen all authority this bible is already sealed oh got the terminology from the angels but that was him speaking he says i don't know what was said but what was said was it true whatever yes it was your friend so you listen to what he said he'll take you at your word as but then he messes up what this angel i told you i read this quote last year hallelujah hallelujah wow they said that it was ways amen amen you messed up he said you're not supposed to get your lion tangled difference who did amen become later on jesus amen amen pillar of fire jesus said i've come from the father this is got to be what is that angel doing palestinian clothes anyway amen i noticed oh this really just gives me a lot of joy because we can see okay amen that it's so perfect in the way of of of of the revelation because we have seen that this one is season same amen so that's a redemptive covenant oh oh do you see it the revelation of jesus christ his power to where his comings sealed up until this time in other words until the time of the year everything is it shakes deer in the headlights oh my god is and all the other mysteries of god would be revealed in you'll never see this oh hey the angel of god scripture coming to pass hey but there's going to be a lot of holy pressing the rapture because that's not all that's required you require that and more but people in this message become so traditional what hallelujah it's in there it's about to be revealed ain't gonna be revealed with no tradition that's the hard part is that it's like what the madame said is getting that dress from the bride if she can um tomorrow's president's day or something like that right now we got some more more important than that president of heaven you yes forever i love the way the prophet does that because if you follow him what he's doing people think these are errors of the prophet a prophet i've said this before remember the prophet is not sent to quote right now he's not as good and that's terrible amen he can say john you know 1812 and he's really meaning 1412. hey man oh man there's a lot of that oh yeah that's the only that's the only scripture from genesis to revelation that has the very terminology no other place in the other places happen in but the time of the mystery of god will be finished whatever that is that we're people the mystery of the you never give it back oh oh people think that in the mystery of god there's not instruction for the people there is through something that's where people get mixed up they don't know what the mystery is just mysteries it's showing us how the orders should be at home go and say lord to me how you should walk in life i mean what you must do what you must not do i reported it wednesday remember everything everybody let me take a look coming down from whether the word of god it doesn't work can say why don't do people know the mystery of god they've not been taught the mystery of god and people think that there was rumors that went around last year by the word i've been rebuked by the word nevertheless amen have we preached exhortations what did paul that's right what's it oh my goodness you know what i mean you know i don't know if you know what it means you know what i'm saying it's not so much that we want you to you know jump and shout out is that's somebody's job
