[3:18] the

[5:52] certainly in the spirit of the Lord
[5:55] now now you see brother what that does
[6:00] the Holy Spirit the angel of God
[6:03] standing in the corner but after that is
[6:07] received after it begins to
[6:10] operate and the and the people see that
[6:13] it's there then their faith begins to
[6:18] draw that presence and that presence is
[6:22] no longer just standing in the
[6:24] corner it begins to get
[6:28] Misty it's
[6:31] milky hallelujah amen his presence is
[6:35] like a

[7:05] was the faith
[7:07] bank and then it gets real
[7:10] milky glory to God Amen Hallelujah
[7:15] Hallelujah so that's the same God that
[7:18] is here tonight that's the same angel of
[7:22] God that we're
[7:24] recommending and and we know that in
[7:27] Exodus uh 23
[7:30] that was the angel that was leading
[7:32] Moses right we got that straight right
[7:36] it was Christ right well Paul in Hebrews
[7:42] 11 speaking of
[7:44] Moses right what he says there is
[7:49] tremendous that we can apply to our
[7:52] lives and seeing how this same Angel is
[7:55] with
[7:57] us it was what the prophet
[8:00] it was with the
[8:02] prophet right it's with us
[8:06] tonight and Paul
[8:09] says uh and and you don't have to read
[8:11] it's okay but in verse
[8:15] 26 we know he's speaking of
[8:17] Moses since verse
[8:20] 23 but in verse
[8:22] 26 he says esteeming the reproach of
[8:24] Christ greater riches than the treasures
[8:26] in Egypt for he had respect un the
[8:28] recompense of the
[8:36] reward by faith he forsook Egypt not
[8:41] fearing the Wrath of the king for he
[8:43] endured as seeing him as seeing him who
[8:48] is
[8:58] invisible Exodus 23 who's he
[9:01] following who's leading him the angel
[9:05] behold I sent my angel before thee to
[9:09] lead you right Exodus 23 is that right
[9:13] what did God say my name is in him
[9:17] hallelujah hallelujah hallu well Paul
[9:21] knowing who that was because he met the
[9:24] same Pillar of
[9:26] Fire and he said Lord who are th
[9:30] and he said I'm Jesus whom you persecute
[9:34] he met the same angel that that
[9:37] Moses
[9:39] Hallelujah and and Sten in Acts 13 or
[9:44] Act 7 he he he preaches of this Angel
[9:49] and he said it was an angel in the
[9:52] burning
[9:53] bush right well look at this here Paul
[9:59] calls him
[10:02] Christ right he
[10:05] esteemed the reproach of Christ greater
[10:11] riches am he followed Christ but verse
[10:15] 27
[10:16] says as seeing him who is
[10:23] invisible you
[10:25] understand as seeing him who is
[10:30] invisible see the holy spirit is a
[10:33] spirit is
[10:35] God is that right but that
[10:39] invisible you can see by your eyes of
[10:43] understanding by your eyes of faith and
[10:46] even by your natural
[10:48] eyes
[10:50] am but your natural eyes can deceive you
[10:56] Satan put a counterfeit
[11:01] because Paul says
[11:04] angels of the devil demons appear as
[11:10] angels of
[11:12] light amen your eyes can
[11:15] deceive but your faith in the word eyes
[11:20] of understanding you can
[11:23] discern as Paul said even if an angel
[11:27] comes down from heaven
[11:29] and preaches something else contrary to
[11:33] what this gospel has been
[11:35] preached let him be a
[11:38] cur
[11:39] hallelujah hallelujah amen let alone if
[11:43] he comes from you know
[11:46] Washington or some other
[11:49] state
[11:51] amen Paul said if he come from
[11:54] Heaven amen but if there come one from
[11:57] somewhere else
[12:02] how much
[12:03] more amen but notice seeing him who is
[12:09] invisible to perceive Amen to to to
[12:15] understand John
[12:18] 33 Jesus told
[12:20] Nicodemus no one can
[12:22] see the kingdom of God if he's not born
[12:26] of the water
[12:27] of
[12:29] and to see is to
[12:31] understand but but Moses was seeing him
[12:37] who is
[12:40] invisible you cannot see something
[12:42] that's
[12:44] invisible amen if it's
[12:47] invisible it's not visible to the
[12:50] Natural
[12:52] Eye am but he was seeing
[12:55] him amen amen he
[13:01] amen
[13:02] rightall now now in Genesis
[13:07] 18 Abraham is sitting there what does
[13:12] the Bible say we've all read the
[13:14] scripture we've been talking about it
[13:15] lately a
[13:18] lot is that right it says and
[13:23] Abraham lifted up his
[13:27] eyes mhm
[13:29] Daniel 10 verse 5
[13:33] and he was
[13:36] praying by the
[13:41] river
[13:43] right and he's praying and the Bible
[13:47] says and lifting up his
[13:49] eyes saw a
[13:52] man his eyes flames of
[13:54] fire right amen his face shining like
[13:58] the sun voice like the voice of a
[14:03] multitude every time you see in the
[14:06] scripture that they're lifting up their
[14:09] eyes they're seeing a
[14:13] vision they're seeing an
[14:16] appearance they're seeing a
[14:19] manifestation of
[14:23] godu you understand remember we
[14:27] preached not too long
[14:30] look
[14:30] up for your Redemption
[14:34] draws we spoke about Jesus telling us
[14:38] when you see these things lift up your
[14:41] eyes cuz your
[14:45] Redemption but we're not looking up to
[14:47] this blue
[14:49] sky you see what I'm
[14:51] saying not looking up to these clouds
[14:54] here you're looking up until your
[14:58] Redemption
[15:00] coming you're looking up that
[15:04] dimension of the word to that upper
[15:08] civilization that's what you're looking
[15:10] up to amen is that right second
[15:14] Corinthians
[15:15] 4
[15:17] 18 uh uh Paul said we look not to the
[15:21] things that are
[15:23] seen but we look unto the
[15:26] Unseen amen because the things are seen
[15:30] are temporal but the things that are not
[15:32] seen are Eternal is that what Paul
[15:36] said amen so this is what we want to see
[15:42] tonight amen we we want to see this
[15:47] Mighty Angel we want to lift up our
[15:51] eyes and see him Hallelujah hallelu
[15:55] standing in the
[15:56] corn amen in our midst in his word is
[16:02] that right in this
[16:04] Revelation is that right so now turn
[16:09] with me to Ephesians
[16:12] 3 and I'm just
[16:15] happy
[16:19] excited of what God is
[16:23] doing amen and at the same
[16:27] time
[16:33] in
[16:37] responsibility that
[16:39] comes God giving Revelations like
[16:46] this
[16:49] because I believe his
[16:54] need the
[16:57] am
[16:59] and uh God doesn't just give a
[17:04] revelation to make the man
[17:09] big that's not what it's
[17:11] for it's to
[17:14] edify is to help is to
[17:18] build is to live
[17:23] fath Hallelujah and that's our that's
[17:26] our heart that's our purpose yes

[31:48] day hallelujah amen back to the
[31:51] beginning he says he shall restore the
[31:55] hearts of the children
[31:57] back to the faith of the fathers he's
[32:01] quoting
[32:02] Malachi but he doesn't take it to us
[32:06] being restored just only back to
[32:09] Pentecost back there 2,000 years
[32:12] ago no he's taking us farther
[32:16] back he says Malachi 4 to restore our
[32:21] hearts bringing a

[32:37] light and the same
[32:40] son that showed in the morning is
[32:45] Promised for this day now remember
[32:49] Adam's
[32:50] position and then brother says the same
[32:53] message it's
[32:56] only
[32:59] atmospheres the sin that is upon the
[33:03] Earth will be
[33:06] destroyed New heavens and new earth is
[33:10] that right so when people hear that they
[33:13] say well God's going to just blow to
[33:17] pieces this Earth is going to make a new
[33:21] one no he's not no he's only going to
[33:24] take the
[33:25] sin
[33:27] he's going to burn it with fire is that
[33:31] right Hallelujah he's going to
[33:33] renovate he's going to
[33:35] restor amen hallelujah and in the new
[33:41] Heavens you might say well what is
[33:44] heaven if there's going to be new
[33:46] Heavens it's probably not this
[33:49] Sky it's going to be a different kind of
[33:52] Sky see but that's not what it's talking
[33:55] about the heav
[33:58] he says is an
[34:01] atmosphere we realize that
[34:04] Heavens
[34:06] definition of Heavens means atmospheres
[34:10] of
[34:12] above now brother Adam is speaking of
[34:15] new heavens and new earth now I'm going
[34:18] slow so you can catch it now brother say
[34:23] all this that exists right here right
[34:26] now
[34:27] is evil
[34:31] spirits in the
[34:34] heavens in the
[34:37] atmospheres
[34:39] above but when God comes to destroy
[34:43] this there going to be new
[34:46] heaven why Ain going to be no more evil
[34:51] spirit in the
[34:54] heaven in the atmosphere
[34:57] amen Ain going to be no
[35:00] more old
[35:02] Heavens
[35:04] contaminated with
[35:06] principalities and Powers the the power
[35:09] of the prince of the
[35:11] air Ephesians 6 we wrestle not did our
[35:16] brother pray
[35:17] earlier amen Ephesians 6 we wrestle not
[35:23] against flesh and blood is that right

[35:32] the
[35:35] atmosphere above are
[35:38] contaminated with evil
[35:40] spirits brother
[35:42] says and then we
[35:44] have that condescends into the
[35:49] natural because that caus
[35:54] sickness it caused
[35:57] from the beginning when sin came in when
[36:01] Adam lost his position that he
[36:06] had he
[36:08] become
[36:10] subject to
[36:13] sin when he was one
[36:16] subject to the
[36:18] word amen once he was subject to the
[36:23] will and the plan of
[36:25] God but when he come out from under that

[37:21] deep all this that exists in the heavens
[37:25] and the atmospheres
[37:27] the Earth which is
[37:28] now it you see it holds the Earth right

[1:08:06] glory to God in the
[1:08:10] message is there anything too hard for
[1:08:12] the
[1:08:13] Lord
[1:08:16] 1960 says Abraham was sitting in the
[1:08:21] door of his tent on a real hot
[1:08:25] day it must have been real hot notice
[1:08:29] the
[1:08:31] weather you ever notice when it's real
[1:08:35] hot are you
[1:08:38] relaxed how beautiful the
[1:08:42] weather no you're not like that
[1:08:45] especially
[1:08:52] mewe real
[1:08:55] hot
[1:08:59] right look at
[1:09:02] this real hot
[1:09:04] weather he says perhaps a lot of
[1:09:09] complaints coming by
[1:09:13] the the
[1:09:15] grass was well
[1:09:20] gone the cattle was be coming very very
[1:09:24] th the water
[1:09:27] supply was about gone they found the
[1:09:30] water
[1:09:31] holes and they were digging and digging
[1:09:34] till the water was seeping through the
[1:09:36] rocks and they had not enough water
[1:09:39] supply for them you know sometimes when
[1:09:44] things are going wrong We Know by Nature
[1:09:48] that it's darkest before
[1:09:51] day and sometimes when when we see
[1:09:54] disastrous things
[1:09:56] happening especially to
[1:09:59] Believers we must bear in our
[1:10:02] mind that it's Satan trying to block the
[1:10:07] blessings that's on its
[1:10:11] Road talking
[1:10:15] about who was coming to him who going to
[1:10:19] come to
[1:10:22] him
[1:10:31] Hallelujah
[1:10:33] moving
[1:10:35] before you ever heard
[1:10:40] brother my first
[1:10:42] time hearing brother bam say on the
[1:10:45] message the Bible don't say that but he
[1:10:49] was by
[1:10:50] Revelation by Vision seen this
[1:10:54] Satan
[1:10:55] moving before the
[1:10:59] visitation
[1:11:06] hallelujah it's Satan trying to block
[1:11:10] the
[1:11:11] blessing that's on its Road he says that
[1:11:15] was the very much in this
[1:11:20] case Satan listen to Abraham AB Satan
[1:11:26] was trying to tempt
[1:11:29] them to feel that they had done
[1:11:34] wrong and was trying to
[1:11:38] block the oncoming
[1:11:41] visitation that God was going to give
[1:11:44] Abraham and
[1:11:48] Sarah what was Satan doing tempting them
[1:11:53] so that
[1:11:54] they could
[1:12:01] feel oh I F in this
[1:12:06] temptation I don't want to go to
[1:12:10] church I go hide in the
[1:12:14] corn that's his
[1:12:18] plan that's his
[1:12:21] plan don't listen to
[1:12:33] get it
[1:12:38] right because he is trying to
[1:12:40] block this
[1:12:42] visitation of the mighty
[1:12:46] Angel and that's why brother have you
[1:12:50] seen that before these Revelations begin
[1:12:53] to
[1:12:54] come how things begin to
[1:12:58] move that right
[1:13:01] brother a lot of you know what I'm
[1:13:02] talking about just before these things
[1:13:05] begin to open
[1:13:06] up about the angel of the Lord wasn't
[1:13:09] things a little tense wasn't things a
[1:13:12] little you know what I mean that's
[1:13:14] that's
[1:13:15] Satan it's not your brother not
[1:13:20] your Hallelujah
[1:13:24] amen well
[1:13:26] actually brother says 90% The Devil 10%
[1:13:30] him your
[1:13:35] brother so a lot of times the brothers
[1:13:38] have a little
[1:13:42] percentage that's what the prophet
[1:13:46] said and that
[1:13:49] 10% we have to Humble
[1:13:51] ourselves we have to say I was
[1:13:54] wrong amen but the 90% is the
[1:13:59] devil
[1:14:01] amen let's him
[1:14:05] out to
[1:14:08] God says before that
[1:14:11] visitation there was a lot of
[1:14:16] complaints lot of
[1:14:18] complaints I'm reading the
[1:14:22] cross
[1:14:24] he said try Satan was trying to block
[1:14:27] the blessing was on this road and this
[1:14:30] was very much in this case Satan was
[1:14:32] trying to Temp them to make them feel
[1:14:36] that they had done wrong he was trying
[1:14:38] to block the oncoming
[1:14:42] visitation that God was going to give
[1:14:44] Abraham and
[1:14:45] Sarah we have been taught in the
[1:14:48] scriptures that all things work together
[1:14:51] for good to them
[1:14:54] that love God no matter how bad it
[1:14:57] seems remember it must be working for
[1:15:01] your good and I'm so glad of that Satan
[1:15:06] been after me all
[1:15:08] day so I just believe that there's a
[1:15:11] blessing in
[1:15:12] stored here in this
[1:15:16] city
[1:15:18] hallelujah thank you Lord thank you
[1:15:22] somewhere and why in this city because
[1:15:26] in this city there is a prince there's a
[1:15:30] a power that is
[1:15:36] governing amen and then under that he
[1:15:40] has others ruling certain
[1:15:43] areas have you ever noticed when you go
[1:15:47] into certain places there's a certain
[1:15:50] spirit that moves in that area
[1:15:57] is that right amen
[1:15:59] amen there's a spirit of
[1:16:02] suicide always in a certain place people
[1:16:06] jumping off Coronado
[1:16:10] Bridge why the spirit is there and then
[1:16:14] the people that live there is that right
[1:16:18] there's some spirits come to anoint them
[1:16:22] and put those stocks in
[1:16:24] their amen amen yes people can confess
[1:16:30] it amen not to put anybody on the
[1:16:36] spot but those things
[1:16:40] come I don't want to live anymore I
[1:16:43] don't want to then you find out where is
[1:16:47] that
[1:16:50] anointing brother said when I go to a
[1:16:53] certain place he says when I flew into
[1:16:56] Phoenix Pho said I've been picking up a
[1:16:59] spirit here in this city said that
[1:17:03] spirit is
[1:17:12] of said that's the spirit that moves
[1:17:17] here and I know it
[1:17:22] personally
[1:17:25] when the Holy Spirit is supposed to be
[1:17:27] influencing the
[1:17:29] church other Spirits influence
[1:17:33] him amen amen oh my and those especially
[1:17:42] ministers little little young
[1:17:46] brother don't even GRE
[1:17:51] him amen amen
[1:17:56] amen whether there Spirits in different
[1:17:59] areas remember the demons that were in
[1:18:05] Legion he was going to cast them back to
[1:18:11] hell right but what did they say no no
[1:18:15] no no no leave us in the
[1:18:18] P they want to stay in the same area
[1:18:24] but the pigs had more
[1:18:26] sense than human
[1:18:28] beings they'd rather be dead than to be
[1:18:32] possessed
[1:18:35] by so they threw themselves in the
[1:18:40] water am they had more
[1:18:44] sense
[1:18:45] humans humans are demon possessed and
[1:18:48] they still want to keep
[1:18:51] living
[1:18:54] P but
[1:18:56] when but when the
[1:18:59] pigs killed
[1:19:01] themselves what happened next read the
[1:19:04] story of the Bible and then brother Bram
[1:19:07] the prophetic eye tells us he says those
[1:19:11] demons come out of them and they went
[1:19:14] into the
[1:19:15] people City very next part of that
[1:19:19] scripture the people of the herdsmen
[1:19:23] of of of the herdsmen not
[1:19:26] pastors
[1:19:27] herdsmen amen of the
[1:19:30] pigs they came
[1:19:32] out right and they said we don't want
[1:19:35] you
[1:19:36] here the people of the City come out and
[1:19:39] said get your
[1:19:41] disciples Jesus we don't want you here
[1:19:46] leave who was that the
[1:19:49] demon in the man in the pigs and from
[1:19:53] the pigs they went into the people of
[1:19:56] that
[1:19:57] City they stay in
[1:20:01] areas yes sir certain Spirits in certain
[1:20:05] areas but that's why brother said Satan
[1:20:09] has been after me all
[1:20:11] day so I believe that there's going to
[1:20:14] be a blessing in store for this
[1:20:18] city am when
[1:20:21] he and he Tri to block what he's trying
[1:20:25] to do is trying to get you to
[1:20:28] disbelieve if you that's the worst thing
[1:20:32] stand your feet that's the worst thing
[1:20:34] that you can do see is to disbelieve God
[1:20:39] but as soon as you get a little
[1:20:41] scared maybe I haven't done this listen
[1:20:46] maybe I haven't done this maybe I
[1:20:48] haven't done that he says right then
[1:20:54] Satan has got your blessing
[1:21:02] conquered Satan has got your blessing
[1:21:07] conquer that's why it's so
[1:21:10] important to not be in that
[1:21:15] condition when someone is in that
[1:21:17] condition
[1:21:18] brother it's
[1:21:21] horrible
[1:21:23] there's no
[1:21:24] Victory there's no there's no right it's
[1:21:29] just one trial and if you notice those
[1:21:33] type of
[1:21:34] people they go from one trial to another
[1:21:37] trial another Tri Tri and they never
[1:21:41] come out of the
[1:21:43] trial why because they're under that
[1:21:50] influence s we got to cut off for
[1:21:55] that amen if there's a
[1:21:59] curse the Holy Ghost C the
[1:22:03] curse amen there's a curse that is
[1:22:07] keeping the blessing of
[1:22:09] Goden get down to your
[1:22:13] knees Lord what is
[1:22:17] it I Surrender I confess my sin Lord I
[1:22:22] want to understand I I want to know my
[1:22:26] position and that's the only way I know
[1:22:30] that I can have real faith is to know my
[1:22:33] position in
[1:22:35] Christ that's faith is that right the
[1:22:39] believer's position in
[1:22:41] Christ now brother and sister when when
[1:22:44] you say I haven't done this I haven't
[1:22:47] done that right then Satan has got your
[1:22:52] blessing you
[1:22:57] come and then when when we
[1:22:59] preach against being in that
[1:23:03] condition people get
[1:23:05] mad and say oh you're just trying to
[1:23:07] show them
[1:23:10] Victory not
[1:23:17] defeat he says you can't get
[1:23:20] it the blessing
[1:23:23] as long as Satan makes you think
[1:23:27] that if we would
[1:23:29] listen such things as Temptations like
[1:23:33] that and would pay attention to them
[1:23:37] then it would be that we would miss the
[1:23:40] blessing and that shows you when Satan
[1:23:45] is trying to block you from
[1:23:46] something that's right keep on
[1:23:50] going regardless
[1:23:53] then he says Satan was trying to block
[1:23:58] Abraham and Sarah because he knew there
[1:24:02] was an Angelic visitation
[1:24:05] coming and and then when everything
[1:24:08] Rises out out of order then we know
[1:24:12] something's wrong I believe if we would
[1:24:16] have listen to Satan we might miss
[1:24:19] seeing it like Sarah
[1:24:21] did
[1:24:25] miss
[1:24:29] the you know why I read the quote some
[1:24:34] Services ago he said Sarah had a wrong
[1:24:40] attitude and brother M said if you come
[1:24:43] to church with the wrong attitude won't
[1:24:46] get
[1:24:49] nothing Sarah was in bad
[1:24:54] new now Abraham has
[1:25:02] me
[1:25:19] strangers that's right Abraham coming
[1:25:22] this is our
[1:25:24] visitation it
[1:25:32] good right Sarah was in a bad
[1:25:36] attitude and she
[1:25:41] missed and and brother
[1:25:46] brother when when Elohim says
[1:25:51] something o
[1:25:55] you see what I'm
[1:25:59] saying when I have a
[1:26:02] child he doesn't know I'm 19 years
[1:26:08] old you
[1:26:11] see it's the same
[1:26:16] thing
[1:26:20] huj I believe
[1:26:24] that same Angel is
[1:26:28] here he
[1:26:30] speaking he's
[1:26:31] saying but if you're not in the right
[1:26:35] Channel and you're and you're feeling
[1:26:37] condemned I haven't done this and I
[1:26:39] haven't done that and I'm this and I'm
[1:26:43] frustrated you're going to miss
[1:26:46] it going to miss it he's fighting the
[1:26:50] blessings every time we come to service
[1:26:53] he's fighting the
[1:26:54] blessing but what did Jacob do he fought
[1:26:58] for the
[1:26:59] blessing wrestled with the angel
[1:27:02] Hallelujah he said I will not let you go
[1:27:06] until you bless
[1:27:07] me Hallelujah and he took a hold of him
[1:27:12] he grabbed him he wrestled with him
[1:27:15] hallelujah oh brother that same Angel is
[1:27:20] here tonight you can clb a
[1:27:23] you can wrestle for life

[1:27:39] same Angel is here tonight and brother

[1:27:46] condition see she was kind of a little
[1:27:49] fussy that
[1:27:51] morning
[1:27:53] she might have said Abraham you know our
[1:27:56] supplies are getting
[1:27:59] low and our
[1:28:02] herdsmen all their pasture is dead dried
[1:28:07] up I think you have made the wrong
[1:28:12] decision when you chose to come up
[1:28:16] here look at Mrs
[1:28:19] lot and their family they are living in
[1:28:24] plenty
