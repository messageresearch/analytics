[11:41] is in another
[11:44] form he
[11:47] said the former
[11:49] rain the planting
[11:52] rain now what happened the former rain
[11:56] was being planted the latter rain fell
[12:00] and what happened when the latter r fell
[12:04] something
[12:05] happened
[12:07] Sodom and it
[12:09] sodomites were
[12:11] burned but Adam
[12:14] Abraham received the promised
[12:20] son the latter r fell
[12:24] brother in Genesis
[12:26] inis Hallelujah and when
[12:29] fell sodomites were
[12:32] burned and Adam Abraham received the
[12:35] promised
[12:38] son let me ask you something did our
[12:43] Abraham did he receive the promised
[12:47] word I'm talking spiritual now I'm
[12:50] talking about what's happening right now
[12:53] did he receive the opening of the
[12:55] seals Hallelujah did the promised son
[12:58] come Jesus Christ
[13:00] down from heaven the mighty angel with a
[13:03] book in his hand open and he come down
[13:07] who was that Jesus Christ who was that
[13:11] the promised son who was that God
[13:14] himself who was that El who was that the
[13:22] word did he
[13:25] come that shows you something that shows
[13:28] you
[13:29] something how this is in
[13:32] connection remember we said this
[13:36] morning remember we said this
[13:38] morning when Isaac was
[13:41] born is was 14 years
[13:45] old
[13:49] listen when
[13:51] Sarah
[13:52] spoke said cast out the
[13:55] b and her
[13:57] child it was and I gave you the
[14:00] scriptures this
[14:01] morning after Isaac was
[14:06] weaned from the
[14:09] milk which was about
[14:12] two
[14:15] years is what is
[14:18] known that's about the
[14:22] time for them in that time and I think
[14:26] even for Jews
[14:27] today that the mother wngs their child
[14:32] stops
[14:36] giving two years two
[14:39] years and why is that
[14:42] significant why is that
[14:44] significant
[14:46] because understand what I'm saying that
[14:51] came the promised son
[14:53] came when when the denominational
[14:57] ages had reached 14
[15:01] years reach 14
[15:05] ages and in
[15:08] 1963 when the word
[15:10] come and the book was open
[15:13] denominational Ages were
[15:17] over is that right but that's when he
[15:21] was
[15:22] born but two years
[15:26] later something happened M hallelujah
[15:32] hallelujah hello Hallelujah that would
[15:34] be
[15:36] 1965 at the end of
[15:43] 1965 something
[15:47] happened
[15:49] brother if the prophet ain't taken off
[15:51] to
[15:54] she we still have a bunch of babies
[15:57] today it's true brother that is true God
[16:00] had to take him off of the
[16:03] scene when that happens
