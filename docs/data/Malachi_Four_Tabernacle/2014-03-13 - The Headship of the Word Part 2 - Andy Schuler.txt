TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Hallelujah God can use you until then amen amen you've got to be connected to that word you've got to be submitted to the headship of the words if he is your head it doesn't matter what your family thinks the leadership of the word will take precedent over all of it amen amen amen Hallelujah okay praise the Lord come on go ahead I don't want to keep you too long oh go ahead let's read a revelation book of symbols he says that great water lily dirty frog scummy pond because and it winds its way up through the darkness through all the mud and scum and it becomes the finest thing that you ever looked at is you ever looked into the face with the radiance like sunshine so is the Church of the Living God it's been born in the mud of fanaticism and chaos but she's wound her way through the crime and so she's on top of the things just waiting for her wings for the flights many shall run to and fro and the people that know their God shall do excellent yes see God's Revelations to his church set still a little because traditionally stay where you are amen amen as sister Gertie and sister Angie used to sing Keep Holding On don't worry God is way crying and pressing to get at the mystery of God reveal to his church now catch this he says keep holding on God is waiting and trying impressive the mystery of God reveal to his church revealed to his church that mystery of God revealed to his church wasn't hidden it was hidden until the time Amen in the Book of Revelation he said John don't write it up because there's coming a time God is God is waiting for us he's been waiting for two thousand years to get it this mystery what's been hidden under that who the spirit of God has worked the justifications baptism of the Holy Ghost under Pentecost and here it is the very same things it did when it was in Christ the church and Christ has become one yeah and as now a lot of people leave that as in brother Branch right yeah and it's easy to see him in there because he did those things come on bro my brother sister it's not just one member but it is the body yes sir amen amen the church and Christ has to become one right now as soon as they connect together that last link is she'll go through this guy the holy ghost in the baptism of it a deeper Shadow yeah um they thought that was it that was just a deeper Shadow now the Holy Ghost it is because the final restoration oh it's very person this is the person Christ is the word the Holy Ghost by the restoration forming signs and wonders like he did at the beginning he says you're gonna call me a holy rolly why is it that we can recognize all the fullness amen what we missed all the fullness of the word the godhead like they died this is not the physical coming there are groups that run off with that yeah they say there's no physical coming and they mix it all up we're not talking about that but we are talking about his fullness of his nature healing himself amen glory to God oh I'm so glad praise the Lord I want to read uh from Psalm chapter 27. we're going to finish up this morning on this thought go ahead and turn in your Bible sister when brother Brandon preached the Rapture message amen he preached from Psalm 27. and he took this as his textbook amen amen but he really didn't say much about the scripture but he preached what was in the scripture without saying that's what it was amen this is what we're looking for someone it's the change of our body the fullness is that right look at that but right now we are living a life of overcoming that will just be the last step of it look at your type mess with people right I mean Enoch didn't just all of a sudden you don't know go from zero to being gone the Bible says he walked with God and we know that brother Graham talked about it Enoch walked with God only he got so close that God said well just come up a little bit we are in a Rapture cycle yes amen we are walking into a Rapture we're on an Enoch walk we are walking with God and then one day we're gonna come so close and something's going to be quick amen amen and it's going to be resurrection power and a change of our bodies amen amen amen so yes the key to this boys then I want you to get this morning is that our Enoch walked walking under the headship of the word is our Rapture in progress we are walking into it I believe that amen that's what we're doing we are possessing Our Land foreign Psalm of David the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid is you realize that you were an enemy of God your flesh was full of sins but God became your light and your salvation no you don't have to fear anyone the Lord is the strength of your life you must walk in this yes even my enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled oh yeah you don't fight against flesh and blood in this hour you don't have enemies like David did that are trying to run you through the spears are demon-powers your enemies are those uh demons that were loose from the river Euphrates religious Spirits don't try and twist the words try and convince you that the word is not for you try and talk you out of your promise I mean with those enemies and foes should encamp against me my heart shall not fear no war should rise against me in this will I be confident I don't care if it's a legion of demons should rise up against me brother sister when you ate this book amen yes sir it was sweet in your mouth but it was bitter in your belly amen when you came for this word amen you you a declared war on the host of hell why your testimonies for the words one thing have I desired of the Lord and that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the O Lord and to inquire in his temples in the secret place of his Tabernacle shall he hide me and he shall set me upon Iran Alto Hallelujah Amen brother sister this is how we walk into the Raptors hey man this is God it says building us in a secret place God hiding him hey man in your heart this is God taking you and hiding you come on Hallelujah adding you on a rock of Revelation amen verse six verses how shall my head be lifted up above my enemies amen round about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy Hallelujah have mercy upon me and answer me without satis seek my face my heart said unto thee thy face Lord will I see oh hide not thy face far from here put not thy servant away in Anger thou Hast been my help leave me not need to forsake me o God of my salvation you see he said without sinus es seek my face I said I will because Thy word came with correction I said I will because he I repented I was zealous for your words you see what he's expressing I I messed up I was wrong don't be angry with me you are my help don't forsake me for you amen and then in verse 10. when my father and my mother forsake me then the Lord will take me up um Hallelujah then the Lord will take me up he will lift you into Heavenly places 11 teach me thy way O Lord lead me in a flame path because of mine enemies he keeps us from false doctrines Deliver Me Not over the will of mine enemies for false Witnesses are risen up against me and such as breathe out cruelty is I had fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thy Hearts wait I say on the Lord and that is what I say this morning wait on the Lord be light of the spirit be subjected to the headship of the world he will give you the victory hallelujah amen I want to read you one last quote amen this is from Satan's Eden preached in 1965. how many believe we're in Satan's evening amen amen hallelujah notice how time of trouble amen thank you he got her to stop and to listen to him for a minute to his reasoning which we are commanded to cast down this is where it's being waged cast down reasoning foreign something that suited her reasoning he says I don't care what it is if it's against God's words him to be against God's word is Antichrist and brothers spirit and uh in the church in Iglesia right and withstand it the church will do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army amen he will do the opposite of what he did amen amen Eve rejected the headship of the word amen we submit to the headship of the word God's word be against it that's your enemy anything that's against the word is your enemy that is the spirit that's anointing amen your enemy is the devil and his minions it's not people no it's not flesh and blood it remember Jesus could stand there with Peter one moment Peter receives Revelation and Jesus says Peter Flesh and Blood did not reveal this to you in heaven has revealed it to you and the next moment you see the momentum Peter says oh Lord surely you're not going to go die when he says give me behind me that's right amen yeah yeah he's not talking about Peter it's the spirit he was anointing him to say this it was against the words you say Jesus that's not very nice this is your this is your right hand man what you're calling him and you didn't pull him aside and do it quietly you did it in front of everybody right in front of the whole church that's a hard word but it had to be something like I said and Jesus said if you're against that that's Satan's Spirit of course amen amen he says if it's against God's word be against it that's your enemies anything that's against the word is your enemy everything that's for the word is your brother she wanted to understand you know one time uh brother and I will sorry I'm keeping you standing here in a moment okay maybe not one time there was a brother we were talking about the moving of the spirit in the in the meetings and he was kind of trying to reason it out a little bit you know how mechanics of it worked and and how you know because there are things naturally we can do to create an atmosphere the spirit of God to move but he was taking it a little too far in thinking and reasoning out the mechanics of how God's spirit moves and I had done a similar thing sometime before and the Lord rebukes and said you don't have to reason it you just have to believe it wow amen amen and so I told the brother I said brother try to understand you're not made to reason out God no God by reason too often we try to know God by reasoning we can't know him that way we know him by Revelation by his word by the Holy Spirit revealing his word amen amen so she pulled the veil from her eyes she wanted knowledge and to know what it was all about she might have even had good intentions she wanted to understand maybe how to serve God better okay so she pulled off the veil to see what it was all about listen to the devil and notice what a place that put her in because and they have done the same thing in each age thereafter always taking the intellectual side and has now built a kingdom of satanas notice I guess he's talking about the churches taking the intellectual side coming out from under the headships yeah build a kingdom of satanic knowledge his seed that he serves and has took the world to be an Eden amen amen and that's what has happened around us we live in Satan's Eden Eve got from out from under the headship Of The World God is restoring a bride in this hour and she is willingly submitting to the headship of the world he's coming back into that place where God is placing the holy Veil over here she's rejecting reasoning she's rejecting man's thinking Satan came down and said and defiled his children and now God is coming into Satan's evidence Instagram Heavenly Father
