[6:45] the portions of the scripture that we've
[6:49] read Lord may you father Quicken it to
[6:53] our
[6:54] hearts pray in the name of the Lord
[6:56] Jesus
[6:58] Christ amen you may be
[7:00] seated
[7:03] amen we want to speak a little bit
[7:06] tonight
[7:09] identified with your
[7:12] sacrifice
[7:14] identified with your
[7:17] sacrifice we F first saw here in the
[7:21] Book of
[7:22] Genesis how that
[7:25] Abel amen the seat of
[7:27] God that came came with Revelation in
[7:31] his
[7:32] heart to bring this worship unto
[7:36] God brother bham tells
[7:39] us that if worshiping God is the only
[7:44] thing that God
[7:46] required then uh Cain was just as
[7:52] Justified abble
[7:54] was but that's not the only thing that
[7:57] God
[7:58] requires God requires us to worship
[8:01] Him Bible says he wor he seeks
[8:05] such to worship Him in spirit and in
[8:08] truth but that's not the only thing that
[8:11] he's asking
[8:12] for he he is he is warning us to come
[8:15] with
[8:17] Revelation and how many knows that
[8:20] Revelation does not lay in your
[8:23] mind and it does not lay in your flesh
[8:26] it lays in your heart a revelation from
[8:29] God does not stay in your mind it's in
[8:33] your heart it's something that is inside
[8:35] of you it's something that is part of
[8:38] you it's part of your makeup it's part
[8:40] of who you
[8:42] are amen it's something that is inside
[8:45] of you it's in your heart remember that
[8:49] because
[8:50] Revelation is upon which Jesus Christ
[8:54] Hadi his
[8:56] church said it would be the same
[8:58] Capstone
[9:00] that would Shield the church in the last
[9:02] days it would be
[9:04] Revelation amen The Shield of God Upon
[9:07] Our
[9:08] forehead amen that
[9:11] declares the name of God Amen so it's
[9:15] the same
[9:16] seal in the end time it's
[9:19] Revelation that God leads his church
[9:22] by it's Revelation by which it is
[9:26] edified and you have to remember that
[9:29] Revelation is not intellectual
[9:32] knowledge it's not your flesh Revelation
[9:36] is your soul connected with God in
[9:41] communication that he is giving you an
[9:44] understanding of the promised word for
[9:46] the
[9:47] hour amen Revelation is in your heart
[9:51] not in your mind not in your flesh not
[9:54] in what you want not in the desires of
[9:58] of the human being
[10:00] but the soul is that part that comes
[10:02] from
[10:03] God the soul is the one that comes
[10:06] predestinated and the word is the soul
[10:09] amen it's the gene is the part of
[10:12] God Amen that come from God it will
[10:16] return back to God Amen and that is the
[10:20] part that where Revelation
[10:23] lies how many can say Amen Revelation is
[10:27] in the heart it's in the soul amen so if
[10:33] God is Not only requiring
[10:35] worship but he's
[10:38] requiring amen Revelation he's requiring
[10:43] us to come with our
[10:45] hearts amen do you understand it is not
[10:50] simply that we try to work something up
[10:54] to worship God how many come to worship
[10:57] God tonight amen and brother Adam says
[11:02] it's our attitude that has to do a lot
[11:04] with it because Cain when he came to the
[11:09] Garden of Eden to the east side of the
[11:13] gate he buil an altar and he went to
[11:17] worship when he went to worship with the
[11:20] wrong Spirit he went to worship with a
[11:23] bad attitude and many times brother said
[11:27] in the message the voice of God brother
[11:31] said amen that same attitude that had
[11:36] many people bring the
[11:38] church amen it's the same attitude that
[11:42] came had this is the best I've had this
[11:45] is the best I can do this is all I can
[11:48] give you take it or leave it brother
[11:51] said that's the attitude that people in
[11:54] the church have Hallelujah God doesn't
[11:58] want what you want to give up God
[12:01] requires what he has
[12:04] demanded Hallelujah and that's your
[12:07] whole hearted
[12:08] worship hallelujah hallelujah amen amen
[12:13] it's not well this is what I this is
[12:15] what I can uh uh
[12:18] give this is all I have brother you if
[12:21] God is calling you to worship him then
[12:25] he that should give or provided
[12:27] something
[12:29] amen a
[12:31] revelation is
[12:33] provided amen but you've got to enter
[12:36] into the into the True Heart of a
[12:39] worshiper amen and the Heart of a
[12:42] worshiper seeks the will of God he wants
[12:46] to please God and when he is
[12:49] seeking in that manner to please God
[12:54] Amen then God will provide the
[12:57] channel of re
[13:00] for him to know how to approach God what
[13:04] to worship God for Hallelujah and this
[13:08] is why the Bible says that it is
[13:12] impossible to please God without faith
[13:16] and faith is
[13:17] revelation Hallelujah that's the only
[13:20] thing that pleases God it's a heart amen
[13:25] with Revelation a heart with faith a
[13:28] heart that believes God Amen and
[13:31] believes that he is a rewarder of them
[13:35] that diligently
[13:37] seek hallelujah hallelujah amen amen and
[13:41] that's the reason why from Genesis
[13:45] Revelation that's God's that's God's
[13:48] requirement for the
[13:50] worship notice what brother R says in
[13:54] the message Corinthians book of
[13:57] Correction then you say say oh
[13:59] Hallelujah he said they haven't got the
[14:02] spiritual
[14:03] blessings that we have they're cold and
[14:07] formal glory to God I ate the real man
[14:09] of
[14:10] God I know it's truth that's exactly the
[14:14] truth but what difference does that make
[14:17] in other words that can be true amen but
[14:22] the
[14:23] attitude is not
[14:25] correct says now the Holy Ghost
[14:29] really Falls in our
[14:31] church he said that's good but what
[14:34] difference does it does it
[14:35] make if you're not the right kind of a
[14:39] vessel that it's falling in remember you
[14:43] say I'm
[14:45] sincere I keep this in
[14:47] mind I'm
[14:50] sincere so were
[14:53] they they left their
[14:55] homes they went out they even put their
[14:59] neck out for death to
[15:02] follow they did not they did a lot more
[15:04] than we have to do
[15:06] today that didn't have one thing to do
[15:09] with
[15:10] it just think the Bible said in vain do
[15:14] they
[15:16] worship do they worship
[15:19] me listen absolutely true
[15:24] worship
[15:26] in Hallelujah where did it begin at
[15:29] from from the Garden of
[15:32] Eden he worshiped God just the same as
[15:35] able
[15:37] did but vain he worshiped yes sir
[15:43] brother he said absolutely true
[15:51] worship the worship is
[15:54] true but it's vain to God because of the
[16:00] heart we go to the Book of
[16:03] Mark amen I I believe I read this last
[16:07] uh
[16:09] Saturday either Wednesday I'm not
[16:12] sure but in the Book of Mark
[16:16] 7 amen amen
[16:22] verse verse
[16:25] six he answered and said unto them well
[16:29] have Isaiah's prophesied of ye
[16:31] Hypocrites as it is written this people
[16:34] honor me with their
[16:36] lips see again notice the focus again
[16:40] but their heart yes is far
[16:54] from see again it's
[16:57] speaking of the heart
[16:59] you understand where is revelation at in
[17:03] your mind in your flesh and how your
[17:06] body
[17:08] feels sir it's in the
[17:13] Heart Is that what abble had in in the
[17:15] Garden of
[17:18] Eden he had Revelation in his
[17:22] heart hallelujah hallelujah how be in
[17:25] vain do they worship me teaching for
[17:27] Doctrine the Commandments
[17:29] of
[17:31] [Music]
[17:33] men
[17:36] see amen
[17:38] amen
[17:40] now we see the is showing
[17:44] us he says again the message the results
[17:48] of
[17:50] decision he says can enable both of them
[17:52] Worship in the
[17:54] beginning see Cain wasn't an infidel
[18:00] my no no it
[18:05] wasn't brought a
[18:07] sacrifice they done everything that they
[18:09] could do both of
[18:10] them why did Abel why did Abel was
[18:15] accepted because Abel was spiritual
[18:22] minded spiritual
[18:24] minded not caral
[18:26] minded spiritual
[18:30] it was
[18:31] revealed to Abel that it wasn't fruits
[18:34] and
[18:35] apples that brought us out of the Garden
[18:37] of Eden it was the blood hallelujah amen
[18:42] and he offered a blood a
[18:46] lamb by spiritual
[18:49] Revelation and Jesus said that he would
[18:52] build this church on that spiritual
[18:56] Revelation bless blood has not revealed
[18:58] to you you never learned it in the
[19:01] Seminary you never learned it by being
[19:05] Orthodox but flesh and blood is not
[19:07] revealed this to
[19:08] you my father which is in heaven Upon
[19:12] This Rock will I build my church and the
[19:15] Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against you
[19:18] how are you going to stop it if it's
[19:21] spiritual
[19:23] Revelation hallelujah hallelujah now
[19:26] notice brother sister that this that
[19:30] comes from
[19:31] Genesis in the beginning of the book
[19:34] goes to the middle of the book
[19:37] Jesus brother bam said that Abel and
[19:43] Cain was the same as Jesus and
[19:47] Judas message the seat of
[19:51] discrepancy
[19:53] 1965 he says we can still preach Divine
[19:57] Healing
[19:59] and the baptism of the Holy
[20:01] Ghost and we still have power of
[20:04] God to separate us from the things of
[20:08] the world God said so the apostolic age
[20:13] has never cease and it will not cease it
[20:17] goes on we find that the same old
[20:24] s the same
[20:27] s of
[20:29] discrepancy amen Amen brother if it was
[20:33] never
[20:35] forgiven then what about now the real
[20:39] seat of all the
[20:41] ages is coming together now notice this
[20:45] this great thing that bam did it went on
[20:49] and on and finally it ended in the
[20:52] coming of Judas
[20:55] scariot and Jesus what was it
[20:58] Judas and Jesus was
[21:02] exactly a
[21:03] figure of Cain and
[21:06] Abel did you hear that J
[21:10] Jesus was exactly a
[21:12] figure of can for as Judas was
[21:17] religious so was Cain
[21:20] religious Cain built an altar he made a
[21:24] sacrifice he worshiped God he was just
[21:28] as
[21:30] sincere listen it was just as
[21:34] sincere in it as the other one was but
[21:38] you see he didn't have the
[21:40] revelation of what the word was now
[21:45] sincerity has something to do with
[21:48] it hallelujah amen but brother Adam said
[21:52] it's not all together just
[21:56] sincerity it's not sincity
[22:00] only there's got to be truth in that
[22:04] sincerity he says the people in
[22:07] Africa amen they
[22:10] worship amen crocodile
[22:13] gods and they feed their babies to the
[22:16] crocodiles
[22:20] sincerely that doesn't make it right
[22:23] amen there's got to be truth behind
[22:26] sincerity there got to be Revelation
[22:29] behind
[22:30] sincerity and Cain was
[22:33] sincere he was he was worshiping God
[22:37] sincerely in in other words with all
[22:40] that he knew with all that was in him he
[22:44] was sincerely worshiping God but he
[22:48] didn't have in him what God
[22:52] required sir Hallelujah yes sir
[22:55] hallelujah hallelujah now he says
[22:59] he thought it was Adam and Eve that eat
[23:01] some
[23:03] apples but Abel by Revelation knowed it
[23:07] was wrong it was blood that brought them
[23:10] out and he offered a lamb and God
[23:12] testified that his offering was
[23:18] right and then he got jealous and tried
[23:21] to kill his
[23:23] brother and as he killed his brother
[23:25] upon the same altar
[23:26] listen
[23:28] he killed his brother upon the same
[23:30] altar that his sacrifice died
[23:35] on did you get
[23:38] that Abel died on the same altar that
[23:43] his
[23:45] sacrifice died on the lamb
[23:48] died upon the Altar and so did abble on
[23:53] the same
[23:54] altar so did Judas ISU
[23:58] betrayed
[23:59] Jesus upon the
[24:02] altar of God and killed him just as Cain
[24:07] killed
[24:08] Abel because Cain was the seed of
[24:15] discrepancy now
[24:17] notice and brother continues to
[24:20] say the mess resurrection of
[24:23] Lazarus he says Abel LED his
[24:26] lamb by a grap
[24:30] Vine and sacrificed him on the
[24:35] Altar and
[24:36] Abel died on the same
[24:40] altar that he
[24:43] sacrificed
[24:45] lamb amen amen amen every believer that
[24:50] comes to
[24:51] Christ must die on the same altar with
[24:55] his dying lamb
[24:58] Christ and die in Christ to be a new
[25:04] creature die out of the things of the
[25:07] world and become a born
[25:10] again a new creature in Christ
[25:14] Jesus die on the same altar of self
[25:19] sacrifice hallelujah hallelujah again in
[25:22] the message the cruelty of
[25:24] sin he says listen friend remember Abel
[25:29] went out into his
[25:32] herd and he and he got a lamb and he
[25:36] killed it on the sacrifice
[25:39] block he says you better catch this
[25:42] now abble died on the same
[25:46] rock that his land died
[25:49] on are you willing tonight to die out to
[25:54] yourself are you willing to die out to
[25:56] all your thoughts
[25:58] of yourself just lay on the rock with

[27:51] all hallelujah hallelujah the sacrifice
[27:54] of the word amen amen and that same word
[28:00] sacrifice in this day amen is what we've
[28:03] got to be identified with not identified

[28:08] intellectual not
[28:11] identified by just knowing the quotes by
[28:14] just reading the messages by just
[28:17] repeating some
[28:18] history but
[28:20] identifi with the sacrifice of the
[28:23] crucified word because that same thing
[28:28] that same life that same word is been
[28:32] revealed in a briide in this last day
[28:36] and that same spirit of
[28:40] jealousy Hallelujah that same spirit

[30:40] altar that the lamb was

[30:49] presenting think about this the one that
[30:52] he was offering to
[30:56] God

[31:22] voice yes of his

[31:43] [Music]
[31:45] generation for the second
[31:47] crucifix of Jesus
[31:51] Christ amen amen hallelujah and he
[31:56] said I
[32:00] indict the
[32:03] denominations I
[32:05] indict orain
[32:07] ministers I
[32:10] indict denominational
[32:12] churches and the
[32:17] independent
[32:18] crucifying the
[32:21] effects of the word yes sir in the
[32:25] people that's what he said
[32:27] that's the
[32:29] crucifixion not one man when they
[32:35] crucify that the word is supposed to
[32:37] have in the
[32:39] people yes sir when you kill those
[32:46] promises the
[32:49] word Jesus said the same scripture we
[32:52] read in The Book of
[32:54] Mark you because of your your
[32:58] manmade
[33:00] Commandments you have made of none
[33:04] effect amen the word of God in the
[33:09] people because of your
[33:12] Traditions amen you have made the word
[33:15] of
[33:16] God not
[33:18] effect yes sir verse 13 making the word
[33:22] of God of non effect through your
[33:29] which ye are delivered in many such like
[33:31] things do
[33:34] ye so in the
[33:37] same uh uh sermon that Jesus is rebuking
[33:40] them because of their V
[33:46] worship he telling them that they are
[33:50] making the word of God not have an
[33:52] effect on the
[33:55] people because of their tradition
[33:57] ition here in Mark
[34:00] 7 amen amen the headline of that is
[34:03] Pharisees rebuke that's why
[34:07] said now
[34:09] notice when when you look at that and
[34:12] you
[34:13] realize that this is
[34:15] connected with the
[34:17] worship amen All Through the
[34:20] Bible that the
[34:22] worshiper has to be
[34:24] identified with his sacrifice
[34:27] how many know
[34:29] that that the
[34:34] disciples Jesus even told Jes uh
[34:38] Peter when you were a young man you did
[34:41] what you wanted you went where wherever
[34:42] you
[34:45] wanted the time will come they'll tie
[34:48] your hands you'll be led where you don't
[34:52] want to go how many know the scripture
[34:55] says right out after that he was
[34:58] speaking of the way that Peter was going
[35:01] to
[35:04] die amen how did they take
[35:08] Jesus amen amen was he as a
[35:12] lamb before his
[35:15] shears was he taken to one place and
[35:17] then to
[35:19] another how were his worshippers
[35:23] done amen how was Peter done
[35:27] how how was James how was
[35:30] Paul how was the
[35:33] ones that were
[35:35] identified with that
[35:37] sacrifice in that hour that the
[35:40] religious world had
[35:43] crucified
[35:44] physically the
[35:46] flesh amen then they
[35:50] received they were
[35:52] identified with that
[35:54] sacrifice amen and we are identified
[35:56] with that
[35:58] sacrifice is that right amen but that
[36:01] was
[36:03] natural and they suffered a natural
[36:07] death how many know that the bride in
[36:09] this
[36:10] hour amen is not to see
[36:14] deathu Hallelujah know that in this
[36:17] hour the word was
[36:19] crucified and the sacrifice that we're
[36:22] identified
[36:23] with was not that somebody's flesh was
[36:26] crucii
[36:28] it wasn't Willam R's
[36:31] flesh it wasn't somebody else's flesh
[36:34] being
[36:35] crucified it was the
[36:37] word rightall and if we're identified
[36:41] with that
[36:43] sacrifice we must Hallelujah in the same
[36:46] manner amen as that sacrifice was
[36:50] crucified we are
[36:53] identified that sacrifice because the
[36:56] problem
[36:57] of the word of God to be fulfilled in
[37:01] the revealing of the son of man that's
[37:04] the way the word was
[37:06] crucified like
[37:08] denominations Hallelujah glory to God
[37:11] and how do you think the word is being
[37:15] crucified or how how do you think that
[37:17] the
[37:18] worship is going to be
[37:20] identified with his sacrifice unless the
[37:24] same thing happens again
[37:27] for him to be identified with the
[37:30] sacrifice he must die on the same
[37:34] altar a
[37:36] sacrifice amen is
[37:40] sacrifice glory to God amen
[37:48] amen amen
[37:51] amen so Jesus was
[37:54] crucified his flesh was
[37:58] nailed to the
[38:00] cross look at
[38:03] Peter was he identified with the
[38:08] sacrifice did he die the same
[38:12] way amen but he said I'm not worthy turn
[38:16] me upside
[38:19] down you see what I'm saying that was
[38:25] natural this is
[38:30] spiritual so in other words expect the
[38:35] same that your sacrifice
[38:38] Reed
[38:40] hallelujah amen amen amen how was our
[38:47] sacrifice crucifying the
[38:50] effects of the word yes sir he said they
[38:55] stand from their pulpit
[38:57] and they
[38:59] crucify the effects of the
[39:06] word
[39:08] amen
[39:10] listen this is where this is where I
[39:16] believe that this has to become more
[39:20] real to
[39:23] us because it's not until after
[39:28] that was
[39:30] killed that his voice
[39:33] cries
[39:35] Hallelujah
[39:37] but today it's it's not our voice that's
[39:39] going to
[39:41] cry that's
[39:43] right it's not our blood
[39:46] anyways right
[39:49] amen when we read in Hebrews
[39:55] 12 the blood of the New
[39:58] Covenant Jesus the
[40:02] mediator the blood of the
[40:05] sprink that speaketh better
[40:09] things the blood
[40:14] of so there's a blood that's that has a
[40:20] voice amen amen is it expected say for
[40:25] the bride
[40:27] to be smitten and
[40:30] crucified is that a promise in the last
[40:35] day Isaiah
[40:37] 53 brother BR read it like this in the
[40:41] message
[40:42] Masterpiece she is
[40:44] smitten she is
[40:46] despised rejected of
[40:49] men we hit our
[40:52] faces from her she was
[40:57] despised and we esteemed her
[41:01] not she is
[41:03] smitten brother Ram says she is smitten
[41:07] from the church
[41:10] body she is smitten with her
[41:16] master amen hallelujah so our
[41:20] sacrifice was
[41:22] smitten but she is smitten
[41:27] with her
[41:30] sacrifice for the same
[41:33] purpose she is the
[41:39] wordu what he
[41:42] say she is the
[41:45] [Music]
[41:48] word just the same as
[41:52] Joseph was smitten from his brethren
[41:57] because he was the
[41:59] word amen Jesus was smitten from his
[42:05] Brethren because he was the
[42:09] wordu the bride is smitten from the
[42:14] church because she is the
[42:22] water The Living
[42:25] Word and in
[42:27] action the Bible
[42:31] bride not some
[42:38] man smitten
[42:40] and of God that's right she stands
[42:46] alone she is
[42:48] smitten from all
[42:51] denomination according to Revelations
[42:54] 3 smitten out of
[42:57] the
[43:00] church that she was raised
[43:06] up hallelujah amen amen amen he says
[43:11] according to Revelations
[43:13] 3 what is he talking about according to
[43:16] Revelations 3 they put Jesus on the
[43:20] outside and his wife amen is that right
[43:24] how how did they crucify Jesus in this
[43:27] age they had nothing to do with
[43:30] him they crucified the
[43:33] effects Hallelujah of the word of God
[43:38] being
[43:39] displayed through a prophet in this age
[43:43] that knew who he
[43:45] was William Bram didn't have to go ask
[43:50] somebody amen do you believe that I'm
[43:53] Malachi
[43:55] 4 have to ask
[43:59] nobody he knew who he
[44:03] was by
[44:05] Revelation he knew who he was he knew
[44:08] what his purpose was he knew what he was
[44:11] called
[44:13] for he didn't have to get the approval
[44:16] of
[44:18] somebody yeah on
[44:20] Amen and that everybody would agree with
[44:25] him
[44:27] hallelujah hallelujah but that's what
[44:29] they
[44:32] crucified
[44:34] amen and when they
[44:37] rejected the word that was being
[44:41] revealed amen amen when they
[44:45] rejected the first grain of
[44:48] wheat that reached

[49:10] hands who's the blood
[49:13] now

[49:17] blood of Jesus
[49:21] Christ by the
[49:23] spirit Hallelujah
[49:26] amen
[49:28] see so when you begin to
[49:32] identify what the blood
[49:36] is spiritually speaking then when you
[49:39] begin to
[49:41] identify where the voice is going to
[49:43] speak
[49:45] from because the the
[49:49] blood speaks
[49:52] Hallelujah the blood ofel had a
[49:57] voice and when he was
[49:59] identified with his
[50:03] sacrifice his sacrifice or his
[50:06] blood spoke
[50:10] amen
[50:11] amen when we are
[50:15] identified with our
[50:18] sacrifice the blood
[50:21] speaks amen better
[50:24] things the
[50:28] understand amen amen now
[50:33] notice the blood is on their
[50:38] hands what are they going to do
[50:41] with oh my they can try to wash it
[50:45] off yeah water it down they can try to
[50:49] wash it say no no it's not so
[50:52] no no no no oh no no no it's not so long
[50:58] iow they'll never be able to do it
[51:01] that's
[51:03] right when they play a
[51:06] tape somewhere in that
[51:09] message they'll hear
[51:12] brother say
[51:15] contrary to what they're
[51:18] saying when they read a book sooner or
[51:22] later that blood's going to speak
[51:29] but they'll all that
[51:31] time they they'll have to put it
[51:35] aside yeah they'll have to try to
[51:39] not just just skim over
[51:45] there you see what I'm saying the blood
[51:49] speaks whether they want to hear it or
[51:53] not that's what I'm I'm saying brother
[51:57] is that the voice that's speaking
[51:59] today is not a different voice than
[52:02] what's on the
[52:04] table am it's the same voice that's
[52:07] right
[52:09] amen hallelujah
[52:11] hallelu and the blood
[52:15] speaks when does it speak I
[52:19] you it speaks when the bride is being
[52:24] identif
[52:26] [Applause]
[52:29] she's being squeezed yeah
[52:32] brother that's when it begins to
[52:35] speak when the thing begins to come upon
[52:40] the
[52:41] pressure of religious
[52:45] power Hallelujah that's good upon the
[52:49] true
[52:51] worshiper after their
[52:53] worship has been Vindicated by
[52:58] God after their
[53:01] Revelation has been accepted by
[53:04] God after their
[53:08] Revelation Hallelujah has been
[53:12] Vindicated
[53:13] amen then the pressure
[53:16] comes
[53:20] amen then that comes
[53:24] against the bride so that she can be
[53:30] identified with
[53:34] her you
[53:39] understand what he says in the message
[53:42] see the
[53:45] discrepancy
[53:47] 65 this is hardest
[53:51] time in the beginning when God swed his
[53:54] seed upon on the
[53:57] earth gave it in the hearts of his
[54:00] children his family to keep that
[54:03] word that was their only
[54:07] defense that was their only
[54:11] defense and here come the
[54:13] enemy and broke that barrier by sewing
[54:16] the seat of
[54:18] discrepancy contrary to the word of
[54:21] God if that was discrepancy in the
[54:23] beginning it's it's
[54:27] still
[54:29] anything that will
[54:31] add anything to the word of
[54:34] God is still the seed of
[54:37] discrep I don't care where it comes from
[54:40] if it's from
[54:42] organization if it's from military
[54:44] sources if it's from political
[54:48] sources anything that's contrary to the
[54:50] word of God is the seed of
[54:54] discrep
[54:56] when a
[54:57] man stands and says he's a gospel
[55:03] preacher and says that the days of
[55:06] Miracles is
[55:08] passing that's the seat
[55:13] ofu when a man
[55:15] stands and says that he's a minister a
[55:19] pastor of a church
[55:21] somewhere and does not believe that
[55:24] Jesus
[55:26] is the same in every
[55:29] detail except the physical
[55:33] body the same yesterday today and
[55:36] forever that's the seed of
[55:40] discrep when he says that the
[55:44] Miracles and the apostolic
[55:47] age has passed that's the seed of
[55:52] discrepan when they say there's no such
[55:55] a thing as Divine
[55:57] Healing that's the seed of
[56:00] discrep the world is full of
[56:03] it and it crowds
[56:07] out and chokes out the
[56:10] wheat my goodness amen oh
[56:15] brother it's the same thing in
[56:19] this when the word of God is
[56:22] identified that's why brother Bram
[56:26] told us that the true
[56:28] church amen has to
[56:31] receive a
[56:34] revelation of the two
[56:36] Spirits within the framework of the
[56:39] Christian
[56:41] church
[56:43] outside
[56:45] within yes sir two
[56:48] [Applause]
[56:50] Spirits hallelujah hallelujah the spirit
[56:54] cist
[56:56] would come into the church and defile it
[57:00] making it luk
[57:03] War
[57:07] andless it
[57:11] exposes revealing his
[57:14] works the tempted destruction of God's
[57:17] people and discredited of God's
[57:21] word right down to the time is cast into
[57:24] the Lake of Fire
[57:27] he fights that he cannot stand
[57:29] it he knows that if the people get the
[57:33] true
[57:34] revelation of the true
[57:37] church amen
[57:39] hallelujah come on you got to get the
[57:42] revelation of the true
[57:45] church and what she stands
[57:50] for that what he said what she stands
[57:54] for
[57:55] and what she
[58:01] is what that c discrepancy is
[58:07] against it's
[58:09] against let the people know who they
[58:12] really are it's against it's a spirit of
[58:18] nism the Same Spirit listen to this that
[58:22] came in in the eent
[58:26] church when that true Alpha
[58:30] bride amen was there during that time
[58:36] Hallelujah there was a period of time
[58:39] amen we in the seat of
[58:42] discrepancy did not exist because it was
[58:45] a true
[58:47] rde amen from the day of
[58:49] Pentecost until 53
[58:52] ad it was a pure
[58:58] but then brother R said in the message
[59:01] SE of
[59:03] discrepancy he said notice
[59:06] amen 20
[59:09] years hallelujah hallelujah after that
[59:13] the Holy Ghost fell the seed of
[59:17] discrep
[59:20] fa oh
[59:21] my whether that was right
[59:25] that was right when that
[59:27] Spirit
[59:29] NM come in defile the church what did
[59:34] Paul
[59:35] say I'm
[59:37] afraid that as the
[59:42] serpent amen so you have
[59:47] turned to another
[59:51] gospel brother said in the message it is
[59:54] the rising of the
[59:56] sun he said they turn to a make belief
[1:00:03] God to a
[1:00:05] gopel
[1:00:09] ofic amen
[1:00:12] amen Gospel of
[1:00:16] fiction a Make Believe
[1:00:19] Gospel now

[1:00:27] church if they can

[1:00:33] Revelation the true
[1:00:35] church what she
[1:00:37] is what she stands
[1:00:42] for that she can do the Greater
[1:00:50] Works she'll be an
[1:00:53] invincible I get the true revelation of
[1:00:56] the two
[1:00:58] Spirits within the framework of the
[1:01:01] Christian
[1:01:03] church and by God's
[1:01:06] spirit
[1:01:08] discern and
[1:01:12] with the Antichrist
[1:01:17] Spirit
[1:01:18] Satan will be
[1:01:21] powerless before
[1:01:23] her
[1:01:25] he will be as definitely th today as
[1:01:27] when Christ with his every
[1:01:35] effort to gain power over him in the
[1:01:40] desert Satan hates
[1:01:46] Revelation but we love

[1:08:27] you out on
[1:08:28] something and I said when you get a
[1:08:32] chance he said he said when you get a
[1:08:35] chance I said this is the best chance I
[1:08:38] know come on over come on he said Mr
[1:08:44] brandom you're trying I believe you're
[1:08:48] sincere and honest but you're trying to
[1:08:52] introduce a world an Apostolic
[1:08:58] doctr he wasn't talking about the
[1:09:01] denomination he's talking about the book
[1:09:03] of
[1:09:04] Acts and he says and said the apostolic
[1:09:09] age ceased with the
[1:09:14] apostles I said the first thing I'd like
[1:09:17] to ask you my
[1:09:19] brother listen do you believe that every
[1:09:23] word of God is
[1:09:27] inspired you see what brother asked
[1:09:30] him oh yeah in other words you're going
[1:09:34] to come up with this
[1:09:36] idea you you have to
[1:09:39] deny a lot of
[1:09:41] scriptures my
[1:09:44] goodness but if you claim you believe
[1:09:47] all the
[1:09:48] word I'm going to show you some places
[1:09:53] in the word that this proves what you
[1:09:57] think you see what I'm saying brother
[1:10:00] it's the same thing
[1:10:01] [Applause]
[1:10:02] today what can we ask somebody in the
[1:10:05] message
[1:10:06] today that comes up with these
[1:10:09] ideas maybe they haven't read
[1:10:12] them sure then God would still forgive
[1:10:16] their
[1:10:18] ignorance yeah sure yes
[1:10:21] see one other thing is May they read
[1:10:25] them but they it doesn't fit what they
[1:10:27] what they
[1:10:29] believe so they
[1:10:31] discredited then they don't believe
[1:10:33] every
[1:10:37] word amen that's right who in the
[1:10:39] message because they hear Brother ra say
[1:10:42] it all the
[1:10:43] time who in the message doesn't say I
[1:10:46] believe all the
[1:10:50] word everyone say that yeah
[1:10:57] but the thing
[1:10:59] is when it comes to certain
[1:11:07] places see okay so he asked him do you
[1:11:11] believe every word of God is
[1:11:16] inspired he said yes sir I certainly
[1:11:20] do I said then when you show me in the
[1:11:22] word
[1:11:24] where the apostolic AG
[1:11:27] se you show me where where it
[1:11:30] is and I'll believe with
[1:11:34] you I said the writer of the apostolic
[1:11:38] age the
[1:11:41] writer the one that had the keys to the
[1:11:43] kingdom on day
[1:11:46] Pentecost when the apostolic age was
[1:11:50] introduced he said men and
[1:11:52] brethren
[1:11:54] they they they said what can we do to be
[1:11:57] saved you said repent every one of you
[1:11:59] be baptized in the name of Jesus

[1:13:00] apostolic age C but only for the
[1:13:04] Gentiles he'll continue with the
[1:13:08] Jews God hallelujah so he's still
[1:13:12] calling when he calls the last name in
[1:13:14] the
[1:13:15] book the
[1:13:18] resurrection and the Rapture will take
[1:13:20] place so until he calls the last one

[1:28:25] sacrifice now the reason is saying
[1:28:29] that we probably won't have uh time
[1:28:32] enough tonight
[1:28:35] but there's a whole lot more to this to
[1:28:38] be identified with his
[1:28:40] sacrifice because in the Old
[1:28:43] Testament when the
[1:28:45] worshiper would bring his sacrifice to
[1:28:47] the
[1:28:48] temple he had to bring his
[1:28:51] sacrifice had to bring it holy
[1:28:54] sacrifice amen and
[1:28:56] whole amen it had to be a perfect sacri
[1:29:01] it couldn't have blemishes in it
[1:29:03] Hallelujah he couldn't have defects in
[1:29:06] it amen it had to be pure Hallelujah it
[1:29:11] couldn't have a little bit of of
[1:29:14] something deformed in
[1:29:16] it and brother said when you take a
[1:29:20] word away from the from the word of God
[1:29:24] the word of God becomes
[1:29:26] deformed Hallelujah he said the body of
[1:29:29] Christ here the word of God and when you
[1:29:32] take a portion of that or you add
[1:29:35] something to it he said it becomes a
[1:29:38] freak
[1:29:40] body
[1:29:42] amen it's like somebody with another
[1:29:44] Toes
[1:29:45] or or something like with another eye or
[1:29:49] three
[1:29:50] ears it's a form
[1:29:53] money you can't add to it or you can't
[1:29:57] take
[1:29:57] away the the
[1:30:00] sacrifice has got to be whole hallelujah
[1:30:04] hallelujah
[1:30:05] amen so
[1:30:08] look when the
[1:30:10] worshipper it is strange
[1:30:13] because about a week ago or two
[1:30:17] weeks I've been listening to this
[1:30:19] message all things I I think I even sent
[1:30:23] out a
[1:30:24] text to
[1:30:26] everyone that I could to listen
[1:30:30] to and just medita listening on
[1:30:33] it then
[1:30:37] praying after service one
[1:30:41] day amen I was sitting right
[1:30:45] there I
[1:30:47] just remembering about
[1:30:49] that then I opened the scripture
[1:30:54] I can't even I can't even tell you where
[1:30:55] I open to but it was somewhere in
[1:30:57] Leviticus I
[1:31:00] think
[1:31:02] and uh my eyes fell right on the
[1:31:07] park
[1:31:09] where the Bible
[1:31:12] says and the
[1:31:16] worshipper or the
[1:31:19] offerer would bring his
[1:31:24] lamb to the
[1:31:26] priest
[1:31:28] amen and the Bible said right there and
[1:31:31] this is what brother R is talking about
[1:31:32] in this
[1:31:35] message many other
[1:31:37] messages he says they had the in the
[1:31:40] Bible says
[1:31:41] there and he shall lay his
[1:31:44] hand upon the
[1:31:47] sacrifice
[1:31:50] Hallelujah and when I I read
[1:31:53] that immediately I
[1:31:57] remembered in this
[1:32:00] message where brother Ram
[1:32:04] says that this the the worshiper was to
[1:32:06] lay his
[1:32:08] hand on his sacrifice to be
[1:32:13] identified listen I'm going quote first
[1:32:15] from the
[1:32:17] message the world is falling
[1:32:20] apart he says
[1:32:23] Israel when God told them to take a
[1:32:26] sacrifice and go offer
[1:32:29] it it was a great thing you can imagine
[1:32:32] a Jew going down to the road with a
[1:32:37] lamb a fat little
[1:32:41] lamb or a
[1:32:44] bulock now where did that come
[1:32:48] from how was sacrificing Lambs
[1:32:51] instituted into the
[1:32:55] law amen am who was the first one to do
[1:33:00] that it was
[1:33:02] able in the
[1:33:05] garden and then when the law come amen
[1:33:08] that was
[1:33:10] instituted as a part of
[1:33:12] worship and sin
[1:33:15] offering for the worshiper that would go
[1:33:18] to the temple because that's what able
[1:33:21] did
[1:33:22] as a true
[1:33:23] worshiper on his altar in the Garden of
[1:33:28] Eden and there was an
[1:33:32] act commanded by the law that he had to
[1:33:36] do and that was to put his
[1:33:39] hand upon the
[1:33:44] sacrifice amen amen and that was
[1:33:49] showing that he
[1:33:52] was
[1:33:53] identified with that
[1:33:55] sacrifice now now now listen and he
[1:33:59] says and he would bring
[1:34:01] it for whatever it was
[1:34:05] Passover and he goes down and he lays
[1:34:08] his
[1:34:09] hand upon the
[1:34:11] sacrifice listen to what brother Ram
[1:34:13] said that's connecting
[1:34:19] himself he's conect connecting
[1:34:23] himself
[1:34:26] identifying himself with the
[1:34:30] sacrifice amen hallelujah so when he's
[1:34:33] putting his hand on the
[1:34:34] sacrifice he's
[1:34:37] connecting with the sacrifice and he's
[1:34:42] identifying with the sacrifice then he
[1:34:45] says again when he puts his hand on
[1:34:50] it amen
[1:34:52] see the priest
[1:34:54] killed amen the the Beast of the little
[1:34:58] lamb whatever it was and as a little
[1:35:01] fellow
[1:35:02] di kicking and
[1:35:04] bleeding the blood splashes upon
[1:35:12] hiss
[1:35:14] amen see the blood spashes upon his
[1:35:20] hand and the
[1:35:22] worshiper in
[1:35:24] sincerity know that that should be
[1:35:29] him but the
[1:35:31] lamb was taking his
[1:35:34] place that's what Jehovah
[1:35:37] required because it was a
[1:35:40] type of Christ but one time that kept on
[1:35:45] going as a family
[1:35:47] tradition they offered the lamb just the
[1:35:50] same but there was no
[1:35:53] sincerity then God
[1:35:55] said those
[1:35:57] sacrifices
[1:35:59] stink in my
[1:36:02] nostrils Hallelujah and today years ago
[1:36:07] we used to find people in deep
[1:36:11] sincerity and
[1:36:13] worship
[1:36:15] amen
[1:36:17] see but now
[1:36:20] brother he says is some tight
[1:36:25] clothes skin on the outside
[1:36:29] almost dancing all all around
[1:36:32] platform no
[1:36:34] sincerity almost making it just an
[1:36:36] outright ridiculous
[1:36:39] shame
[1:36:41] Christianity professing it I wonder if
[1:36:44] our
[1:36:46] offerings hasn't become kind of a stench
[1:36:49] in his nose again
[1:36:53] our
[1:36:56] differences it's just the same that the
[1:36:58] enemy has taken our American women and
[1:37:00] stripped them
[1:37:04] down out in the streets is a
[1:37:07] disgrace no wonder little boys and girls
[1:37:09] and things in such a sh shape as they
[1:37:12] are
[1:37:15] today they're always trying to pattern
[1:37:17] after some woman out here in
[1:37:20] Hollywood hwood married four or five
[1:37:23] times she'll come out with some sort of
[1:37:26] new
[1:37:27] clothes all little girls in the country
[1:37:29] will pattern after
[1:37:31] that what a Pity that's too
[1:37:34] bad it's too bad it got into the church
[1:37:38] the beautiful virtue that God gave a
[1:37:39] woman to be a
[1:37:42] mother has been
[1:37:44] mared amen the message
[1:37:47] Investments he says the
[1:37:49] Jew put his his hand upon the
[1:37:54] sacrifice to connect
[1:37:57] himself with the
[1:37:59] sacrifice
[1:38:00] Hallelujah now you Believers that
[1:38:03] receive the holy
[1:38:05] ghost look who is standing up all around
[1:38:09] you lay your hands over them as a
[1:38:14] commemoration that you are a
[1:38:16] Believer touch their hand or something
[1:38:19] while we pray don't doubt believe now
[1:38:24] it's not an emotion it's the sweetness
[1:38:27] of the holy spirit that comes
[1:38:29] down and fills every life now you're in
[1:38:33] now they're in your
[1:38:35] hand you've made a contact with them
[1:38:39] just like when you put your
[1:38:41] hands when the Jew put his
[1:38:44] hand on the sacrifice to connect
[1:38:48] himself with the sacrifice what one day
[1:38:52] you laid your hands Upon
[1:38:53] Jesus connecting yourself with the
[1:38:57] sacrifice the life of the sacrifice has
[1:39:01] come back on
[1:39:03] you the
[1:39:05] blood I may be speaking
[1:39:09] tonight on the
[1:39:11] token amen it's got to be upon
[1:39:16] you see it's got to come on
[1:39:19] you you youve you've connected
[1:39:23] yourself with this man or woman who
[1:39:27] wants to
[1:39:29] believe just stand right up now and lay
[1:39:32] your hands on those who wish to receive
[1:39:36] it that's right God bless you what a
[1:39:38] wonderful
[1:39:39] time don't be in a hurry just remember
[1:39:42] pray for their for this
[1:39:46] person amen amen so here in the
[1:39:49] message amen the
[1:39:51] token he says we have to identify
[1:39:54] ourselves with our
[1:39:57] sacrifice we have to be
[1:39:59] identified in his
[1:40:02] death when a Jew plac his hand upon the
[1:40:06] sacrifice he was identifying himself
[1:40:09] transferring his
[1:40:11] sins to his sacrifice and the sacrifice
[1:40:16] died now we place our hands by faith on
[1:40:21] Upon Jesus Christ and are identified
[1:40:24] with him in his death not only in his
[1:40:28] death but if we are
[1:40:31] accepted we are identified not only in
[1:40:33] his death but in his
[1:40:36] resurrection but the life that was in
[1:40:39] him is sent back upon the
[1:40:42] believer as a token as a memorial that
[1:40:47] death has passed from it God has sealed
[1:40:51] you into the kingdom of God until the
[1:40:53] day of your
[1:40:55] Redemption Ephesians
[1:40:58] 4:30 real genuine
[1:41:01] gospel as clean as I know it I know it's
[1:41:05] true I've tried it there's no other ISM
[1:41:10] there's no other
[1:41:12] work there's no schemes or
[1:41:15] mimics no nothing it's just pure
[1:41:18] unadulterated faith in the word of God
[1:41:23] and the finished works that God required
[1:41:25] at
[1:41:26] Calvary knowing that there is nothing
[1:41:30] that we can do to save
[1:41:31] ourselves we must accept what he did for
[1:41:35] us let your hands on the
[1:41:39] sacrifice stand on your feet
[1:41:43] tonight it's
[1:41:45] strange hallelujah hallelujah how these
[1:41:49] things are taking
[1:41:52] place
[1:41:54] see that's the way it is tonight we can
[1:41:58] come and
[1:42:00] sympathize with everything that God
[1:42:04] does but that isn't what he
[1:42:09] requires you've got to apply
[1:42:11] it it's not sufficient until you apply
[1:42:16] it the blood must be
[1:42:18] applied and when it's applied
[1:42:22] on you it

[1:42:43] sacrifice Hallelujah the same thing we
[1:42:45] do

[1:42:49] sacrifice and identify ourselves with
[1:42:51] him he is the word we have to be
