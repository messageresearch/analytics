TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hour and a half or two hours like this morning but uh I believe the Lord really blessed to support it is uh I had a good time amen and really seen how heavy and Dave he wants all of these things come together the the book The Bible believer that he has become a new book okay now we can see at everything not as a as a little story or some history but we can see it as prophets amen and then it's all revealing Jesus Christ amen now we want to see tonight I know it's First beginning going back to First Corinthians oh afterwards the head clients you see no one else is given the job in every age but the messenger of that is you understand and that's why we read the books this morning from spoken word is the original see how many seen that it was very pleased 1962. he said the seed is in the ground amen he said Billy uh Billy Graham when Billy Graham has planted the seeds for the Pentecostal denomination he says in the resume shut up amen amen yes but it would be in the first month it would be in the same months in a measal mess it would be in the same season we understand that now right what is the first month yes it remembers for the Jewish calendar amen it's springtime see now that is their first Feast I Passover is to be celebrated last week amen is Feast of Tabernacles yes amen amen you see right what what that what that is showing us is that we're not dealing in the natural like the Jews preach the restoration of the Bride treatment amen speaking of job I will restore said the Lord the invasion of the locusts amen amen what did he say he said in the springtime it means resurrection and he said and through the churches there's been a cold winter amen now Express erections foreign he said which are the revelations foreign in the morning good morning and in the springtime yeah the spring sun is amen but notice do you say when the seat is foreign foreign be truly fulfilled until the openings in 1965 he said this mystery it was the mistake of Matthew 24 24 the two are so close this could not be made known as soon as I said he said because this is a sign it was an accident yes so therefore I'm not going to say it until the seals foreign you see only the prophet messenger of the age was given the seat to pray yes when he first went amongst the Pentecostals he couldn't understand and the other one was a genuine Christian amen amen and the Lord Hebrews chapter six amen amen and and and the righteous yeah the rain falls on the Justice it went back to Hebrews six and that's what everybody else says it is very simple it is impossible for you to receive and conceive us and then fall back you know guys that's what he that's what he brought so really he says he's seen a great picture is that right he says in there was a tears the same thing amen I mean why okay because if that's what happened exactly 50 years ago December of 64. Amen 50 years ago amen Harvest Time oh my God when but no that mystery is in these days it's the reason why because the sporting the rain is falling I mean you understand again that's the tremendous point is different so if only the message of the age Hallelujah hallelujah amen amen that's former rings but it's not a try Doctrine amen hallelujah it's got some more extra in there so the sea can fall on the eyes it's just like this yes I see you know the prophet of God is the Angel to the church amen amen we all believe that and then in every local assembly there's an angel of that church yes you see it's the same thing there's a head planter but this is what brother I am saying this is the way the light comes to a god-given message see in a certain area he said from that messenger there spreads the light through the Ministries who have been Faithfully talked you know foreign remember Paul warned me and he told them in First Corinthians I mean is no longer and the Revival dies down how careful we must be the only hear one voice which is words it is famous others who are Faithfully talked they have to continue holding that message because we don't have a message we must do away with man-made ideas foreign Hallelujah foreign foreign in the days foreign understanding the reason why when the seed is it must be only there is and then if I walk the police I thought of like we went there over he was one and then in our language he had been in the message amen and he didn't know you know that he had to receive the Holy Ghost amen that's right was that a polished testimonials some of ours too right man let him know hey man he said well he was he taught me I mean that was for for the Pentecostal lady we didn't have that anymore you know huh this is the age of maturity you know how to handle you know the words you don't control the Holy Spirit Holy Spirit got to control you amenities here we go Hallelujah now my goodness I promised myself I'd be quick amen don't laugh any right here amen now notice what is it what universe amen right here in the description we read what the seed oranges for for first and right in the air and after the corn before corn you know how many knows but instead of calling it the ear it was in my leg and the corner he called it the shop so the grain of wheat you got a table is in the shock see at the end listen this is what I want us to see right now verse 28. he says firstly then I get here after that the full corn in the earlier but when the fruit is brought forth immediately he put us in the circle because the harvesta is now we'll read some few things here about well of course but before we do that let us turn to Revelations 14 foreign foreign amen man verse 14. by the way Rachel uh we ain't going the way I thought um I just met I just finished saying it when I just said okay Revelation 14 14. this is and I look and behold a white clouds oh now remember we've already seen yeah what that cloud represented we read Luke 12 this morning when you see the cloud arising from the West foreign a great big clouds yoga when you look at this amen amen and upon the clouds one sat life under the son of man see somebody now is this Revelation 10-1 as well amen amen I saw my angel Christ peaceful coming down from Heavens is that also Revelation 19. coming down is that Revelations one is that what he says he said that's that's the clown song yes yes have it on his head a Golden Crown and in his hand a shark now pay attention to these to how it's worded here and another angel came out of the temple crying with the loud voice to him that sound the crowd for us in my sickle and reap for the time has come for thee to reap for the Harvest of the earth is right it is another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven we also having a shark sickness and another angel came out from the altar which had power over fire D allowed cry to him that had the sharp sickle save press in thy shot sickle and gather the Clusters the vine of the Earth for her grapes are fully right of the earth to gathers the vine of the earth and casted into the great white press of the wrath of God's laws and the wine press was trolling without the city the blood came out of the wine press given up to the horses riddles by the space of a thousand and six hundred furloughs foreign thank you to apply it in our days how many remembers how they're doing foreign amen I mean why do I say that okay we're back Revelations amen what this really mean foreign where the Seven Angels Live was once again amen amen amen you see the Angels remain for the Harvest time they are the Reapers they are the ones and you saw a letter to the floor what did this message read Luke Chapter 3. anymore I want you to understand and it's on the floor so Hallelujah Lord Jesus Christ foreign that's it right here you see what I'm saying true immediately when we think sometimes that's the harm foreign Hallelujah amen have another word see that's what it does it's awesome especially when I get these fresh quotes all right notice decent father if I don't see it you're gonna laugh the message he said Lord the Harvest the fields the samples are bloom social receivers and then he said something the devil's fighting me to get the quote amen amen but he said the message he leaves that's right in the message of prisoners foreign he says Lord give it to me brother and sister Hermanos that's what this is so when that separating time comes amenities who what is the field each other out of that foreign foreign okay Monday he saw me with eyes Fire coming out of my rose amen he says we were going up a hill remember the tree that was coming yeah a great Stone amen amen put brother Brandon in that message he didn't say an illegal like he said it literally foreign yeah we are talking foreign to ruin government and as I said he was brought down only to the five suits amen but before that that's all he would govern and we were not in a higher stage but that's when we come back Hallelujah where is the kingdom going to be established amen right he said the kingdom of God would come without observations amen and many were saved oh you know it's over here it's in the secret chains and it first comes Spirits because the same thing just like today the Jews wait a minute what is it first is spiritual we got to establish the kingdom because I said later in your sins yeah okay 800 miles foreign Hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah I guess we'll just leave it for some other time but the Harvest Time this is the Harvest Time amen man this is the hardest time amen that's right in the floor it's the individuals who's doing this separation do you understand the sequel now amen I mean it's the brain is the season together foreign he says this is masterpiece please through the three stages of organization the organization and this is where the separation comes the same seat that went in the Quran comes at the end and must be the seat again he says everything falls off the leaves everything else that add hung to it but the original was in the in the reformation and now yeah the stop but they're all that all the time they're becoming more like this now in the Harvest Time is Back to its original lives back to the Bible says yeah in the days of the message the seventh Angel's message the whole word of God what all of the stuff all of the rest of it we made manifested this time you see where we're at for the coming
