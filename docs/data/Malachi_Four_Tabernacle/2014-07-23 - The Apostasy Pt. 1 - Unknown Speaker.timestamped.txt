[4:10] Aristocrats

[4:14] changing the order of worship
[4:19] that was a rebuke for the first for the
[4:21] first church age
[4:30] the love you once had in America
[4:40] all right well we don't worship like
[4:42] that anymore

[4:48] that's right that's your personal
[4:50] revelation
[4:53] Hallelujah
[5:26] that Spirit was coming yes
[5:31] and he said the church with its Classics
[5:36] of his classicals and dignitaries person
[5:40] and personalities
[5:43] they've seen they were coming something
[5:46] the Holy Ghost was warning them
[5:49] of the last days I hope you remember how
[5:52] Jesus spoke of it
[5:57] to finally become a doctor
[5:59] in an organization
[6:03] we are not in darkness now
[6:06] remember
[6:10] saying this in 1961.
[6:14] he's saying that full Darkness
[6:17] has not come here yeah
[6:21] amen
[6:24] yes
[6:46] when he drew the seven moons
[6:48] and how they had a little bit of life
[6:51] and darkness a little bit of light all
[6:54] through the church ages
[6:56] but he said the last one I put the light
[7:00] in there but he says when I see the
[7:04] Visions
[7:10] he said I couldn't see past 1977
[7:16] it was total darkness
[7:21] the Holy Spirit came Jordan
[7:25] but that was in 1960.
[7:29] in 1961.
[7:31] amen amen
[7:35] 1964.
[7:40] amen amen where exactly
[7:44] we are exactly 50
[8:44] to get each other
[9:05] they went into a total darkness
[9:10] that's apostasis
[9:14] notice them he says we're not in
[9:17] darkness now remember that Brethren
[9:20] see here we are yeah
[9:24] organizations
[9:32] how that Spirit came in yeah
[9:35] people that put in more money
[9:40] because I put more money
[9:43] yes
[10:26] and brothers
[10:28] that's what that Spirit began to come in
[10:33] is that right yes amen Hallelujah
[10:40] neglect does it come in come on through
[10:44] the ministry
[10:46] no sir no go back and study the message
[10:54] yes and that spiritual amen Place
[10:59] ministers
[11:00] that did later on
[11:03] did what they did yeah
[11:05] but it began with the people
[11:09] losing sight
[11:11] of what they really were supposed
[11:18] the Pentecostal
[12:12] you see what it is
[12:15] now all right it's that's all that's
[12:19] called God is
[12:20] he sits in the temple
[12:23] it is
[12:29] in the last days
[12:32] here we are here right now
[12:35] we see the falling away
[12:38] we see it remember we see the church
[12:41] getting further and further away
[12:45] going right back again
[12:47] where we come from we're at the end
[12:51] times
[12:57] we read these scriptures here
[13:03] and we're going to see
[13:05] how these scriptures
[13:10] we read first Timothy chapter four
[13:14] where in the latter day in the latter
[13:17] times
[13:26] and doctrines
[13:29] but that literally means is
[13:39] Hallelujah
[13:41] amen amen
[13:44] but now all right the testimony of a
[13:47] true witness yes
[13:50] he testified
[13:53] his word testifies
[13:55] but in the last days there will come a
[13:59] falling away
[14:00] and there will come up a cold formal
[14:03] powerless churches
[14:09] yep that's what we're living in a church
[14:13] that had no power
[14:15] form of godliness
[14:21] from such turn away
[14:24] yes he give the sun there would be times
[14:28] when a man would sit in the temple of
[14:30] God Temple for himself
[14:32] showing himself that he was God
[14:34] he would come rule in the nation
[14:38] all these things how God's word has been
[14:41] perfect
[14:43] how the King Nebuchadnezzar right there
[14:48] and Daniel interpreted
[14:51] how those kingdoms for the Babylonians
[14:55] meet the Persians to the Greeks
[15:09] God's word is a true witness
[15:12] God's word said in the last days
[15:24] again the stress between the Nations
[15:27] there would come of falling away from
[15:30] the church men would rise up showing
[15:34] themselves
[15:37] and power and with power away from the
[15:41] church
[15:42] a form of godliness
[15:44] deny the real power of God
[15:47] just joining church he spoke of the
[15:51] church getting into that condition
[15:53] here we are at his house
[15:59] the church is in that very condition
[16:03] organization is in that same state right
[16:06] now
[16:10] any organizations are still on fire for
[16:14] God
[16:17] filled with the Holy ghosts
[16:22] there is no such a thing foreign
[17:24] Wars
[18:57] that's right
[18:59] notices
[19:15] it's all fallen in place
[19:27] come into her position
[19:38] types Hallelujah yes sir
[19:43] the following away
[19:45] it's also a sign according to the quote
[19:49] which is
[19:52] coldness yeah

[20:01] it's true
[20:03] hello hola yes
[20:06] hello yes
[20:10] amen amen
[20:14] so I guess if you don't want to be in
[20:17] the
[20:18] conditions
[20:20] we want the word of God burn in our
[20:22] hearts
[20:24] we want the Holy Ghost to keep on
[20:27] burning environment
[20:35] that's right hello amen

[20:52] now the time has come on
[20:57] foreign
[22:00] amen
[22:18] so that message people can see
[22:21] the same thing happening in our day
[22:24] people don't understand
[22:27] that there was
[22:29] there was something that was held back
[22:31] foreign
[22:44] amen
[23:21] he says can the program come up and pray
[23:25] for the boat so you're okay
[23:33] and
[23:35] the same man in his moment that was not
[23:38] only going to that church
[23:40] going around the world
[23:43] seeking this Unity
[23:45] for the economical accounts
[23:57] was that a judgment or foreign
[24:19] and the spirit continues it is
[24:26] hello
[24:34] amen amen deities
[24:45] but that Holy Ghost Power stays here
[24:53] foreign
[25:53] oh yeah
[25:56] it could not happen you know who else
[25:58] was there until the falling away
[26:01] until the church
[26:03] begins to get away from the spiritual
[26:07] feast
[26:14] and organize itself in the Revelation
[26:20] in the revelations
[26:25] with that church
[26:27] oh my goodness amen amen
[26:31] let it continue on
[26:34] Revelation did not continue on it did
[26:38] not stay with the church opening it amen
[26:41] amen they got away from the spiritual
[26:44] tweets
[26:46] and the message is
[26:50] talking about that great feast
[26:53] that was ready for us to come and sit at
[26:57] the Lord's table
[27:00] hallelujah amen and he said his servant
[27:02] one time two times and the third time he
[27:06] sent them out
[27:07] was to force something in Hallelujah
[27:10] foreign
[27:31] foreign
[29:00] oh help us chocolate
[29:10] sell bread amen how's your way Lord have
[29:14] your way Lord
[29:19] they got away from the spiritual peace
[29:26] and organize itself and the revelations
[29:46] without one mistake since the mark of
[29:50] the beast is a mark of a pastor says
[29:56] wow
[29:58] the mark of the beast is a mark in
[30:02] America of apostasis
[30:09] to reject the holy
[30:12] ghosts
[30:16] hanging to their church
[30:20] instead of walking in the wild
[30:26] instead of walking in my life
[30:32] and there's nothing left
[30:37] by Darkness 14 years
[30:40] that's right all right
[30:42] okay
[30:49] every evil
[30:51] of all the churches
[30:55] the evil
[30:56] evil that was in the first church age
[31:00] left over into this next one is
[31:04] just kept on going down
[31:07] until it finally ends up in complete
[31:10] apostasis
[31:21] in every church
[31:23] every little engine
[31:25] that started like in Genesis
[32:23] that's what the Bible says no man can
[32:26] say Jesus is the Christ
[32:29] foreign
[32:46] amen
[32:59] see them are true yes
[33:03] see the church says so that's true you
[33:07] don't know it yourself
[33:08] until the Holy Ghost has revealed it to
[33:11] you
[33:13] yeah
[33:22] not by intellectual
[33:25] yes amen
[33:36] when they as different as they use for
[33:40] night
[33:43] but the Jews know better than that
[33:46] so but I guess maybe it's the hour for
[33:49] it to come
[33:51] where it all has to go eat in this great
[33:55] Apostles
[33:59] amen amen
[34:01] City
[34:03] oh my brother and sister it matters
[34:06] Paul warned us
[34:08] he said the time was going to come
[34:11] when one will arise
[34:16] peace peace
[34:20] and then sudden destruction
[34:26] people are looking for someone to come
[34:29] and bring peace
[34:35] back in the Middle East
[34:44] amen
[34:45] and
[34:47] he said that the one that would come
[34:49] saying peace peace
[34:57] in that same scriptures
[35:04] he will come he said as a thief
[35:14] hey man
[35:18] brother and sister Hermanos
[35:21] the bride the Helga ain't gonna received
[35:24] her Thief in the Night
[35:28] amen amen
[35:32] he's gonna he's gonna come around
[35:43] of the Bride ain't in the night amen
[35:48] Hallelujah now I want to get something
[35:51] here because there's apostasy
[35:53] it is total darkness
[36:02] that lunar eclipse in 1964.
[36:06] he preached
[36:12] Hallelujah
[36:15] amen
[36:16] oh and he said that's a great sign yeah
[36:24] amen amen
[36:28] now all right the supposed to see is
[36:37] he says in the living to see a church
[36:39] age
[36:51] so this is a message
[36:53] of the last age this is a condition of
[36:57] the Liberty Church
[37:00] as it's in years
[37:04] it is not a personal message
[37:09] it is the spirit telling us
[37:12] where Jesus is
[37:16] left the church
[37:20] this is not the logical result
[37:25] if the word is put aside for Creeds
[37:31] the Holy Spirit
[37:35] been pose for popes Bishops presidents
[37:39] counselors Etc presidents
[37:45] Etc and the Savior set aside yes
[37:48] for a Works program
[37:53] Johnny Church some type of Conformity
[37:57] to a church
[38:01] what more can be done against him
[38:04] this is the apostasy amen
[38:10] Hallelujah
[38:13] amen a program of Works
[38:15] joining the church
[38:18] Conformity to a church system or foreign
[38:24] voting aside the word for agree I don't
[38:26] know what it is
[38:32] n't it
[38:34] counselors foreign
[39:39] I come in the name of my father
[39:43] and you receive me not you no matter
[39:49] Jesus prophesies
[39:55] to YouTube
[39:58] is going to come in his own name amen
[40:06] and here you'll receive yes
[40:19] oh
[40:21] Matthew 24
[40:23] mentioned signs in the heavens
[40:26] right after he says he says amen the man
[40:30] of sin of prediction is
[41:12] La Luna
[41:15] lose
[41:26] what are we at church
[41:36] I wonder if you notice
[41:39] such a sign recently
[41:44] fulfilled and portrayed to the very
[41:48] truth
[41:50] that we have been discussing
[41:56] is that Jesus has been steadily pushed
[42:00] aside
[42:04] until the last stage is put on the
[42:06] outside
[42:08] recall that in the first age
[42:16] or the Church of the truth
[42:19] yet there was a little air called the
[42:22] Deeds of the nicolete
[42:29] that kept the circle is
[42:37] North Korea
[42:39] or of light then in the next Age
[42:51] The Darkness covered more of the circle
[42:54] is
[42:59] Eclipse ages
[43:13] now click on this okay the church shines
[43:16] a reflection of the Light of Christ
[43:19] here's the son the church is the moon
[43:22] thus this orb of light is
[43:25] the Moon it had decreased from almost a
[43:29] full moon uh
[43:33] decrease I think
[43:35] in the first thing is
[43:39] in the fourth age
[43:58] and almost
[44:00] and nothingness
[44:02] so that instead of light it was
[44:05] Blackness of apostasis
[44:10] and at the end of this age
[44:13] to shine says
[44:20] and Christ is on the outside of the
[44:22] church
[44:23] here is the sign in the sky
[44:27] the last eclipse of the moon
[44:30] was a total eclipse
[44:33] it won from a total darkness in seven
[44:37] stages
[44:39] in the seventh stage
[44:44] that's the book of room
[44:46] went to Palestine
[44:49] Palestine to make a holy tour of
[44:52] Jerusalem
[44:54] he was the first pope to ever go to
[44:57] jerusalemate see
[45:00] okay
[45:02] now
[45:04] he went to Jerusalem all right foreign
[45:28] now what is being shown as
[45:32] a sign
[45:34] amen amen
[45:46] ities
[45:53] that is opening the way
[45:56] for that man of sin foreign
[46:19] amen
[46:29] it's the church
[46:41] he said oh no brother no no he's strong
[46:44] he didn't he's as strong as you make
[46:46] them
[46:51] yeah oh my God but if you keep on
[46:52] letting him
[46:54] push you around he'll be bigger than you
[46:58] oh amen amen what if you're fed up with
[47:02] that yeah
[47:47] that's right
[47:52] foreign
[48:07] have a father
[48:10] yes Lord the sons of God because
[48:28] amen amen it's Genesis Chapman which
[48:30] took Moses
[48:34] these would come
[48:36] resisting the truth
[48:41] second Timothy this turn foreign
[49:21] now therefore endure heartless as a good
[49:24] soldier of Jesus Christ
[49:29] no man worth
[49:32] entangle is himself with the Affairs of
[49:35] this life that he may displease him who
[49:38] have chosen him to be a soldier
[49:41] says
[49:48] for masteries yet he is not crowned he
[49:53] said he strive
[50:06] for thou will increase for they will
[50:10] increase unto more ungodliness
