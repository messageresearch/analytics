[15:25] he received his son
[15:47] it opens our blinded eyes
[16:07] and like I said at the beginning
[16:11] I was meditating last week
[16:15] and I was gonna bring this Sunday
[16:19] morning
[16:25] and that's what you preached that this
[16:27] Sunday morning
[16:31] I had been meditating on on this
[16:34] scripture
[16:54] for the game
[16:57] after receiving the Holy Spirit
[17:04] the reason I came back the Lord led me
[17:07] to the scripture last week
[17:28] so he mentioned that I said that means
[17:31] something brought that scripture back to
[17:33] my memories and
[18:04] so when that came to me I went back to
[18:08] my old notebook uh
[18:15] and I preached November the 8th because
[18:28] uh
[18:30] but what caught my attention we were
[18:34] just meditating because
[18:42] that was a Sunday morning
[18:51] Saturday
[18:53] it was my first time
[18:55] which will be November the 3rd because
[19:00] uh my first time I went to Sunset Mount
[19:03] you know I asked if we had one day that
[19:04] I thought they said and we had a
[19:06] tremendous experience there
[19:08] and then when I came back
[19:14] brother Robert West Robert Webster from
[19:19] Sacramento which is not in Sacramento
[19:21] anymore
[19:23] are attacked us and he was a brother
[19:26] there from the same church by the
[19:29] Sullivan
[19:30] yeah
[19:33] and I guess brother Solomon this was
[19:36] 2007 it was one of those we said
[19:39] brother Solomon I guess was just barely
[19:42] coming in the message
[19:45] he was
[19:48] attending the church
[19:50] and brother Robert Webster gave me a
[19:53] testimony he went on a Robert Webster do
[19:55] it this morning
[19:58] for that week
[20:06] foreign
[20:34] his mother
[20:36] died I guess so my favorite day and he
[20:41] prayed for it she came back
[20:46] amen
[20:53] so I was meditating on these things
[20:57] you know on on those things
[21:00] and then after you said Lord because you
[21:04] know I'm thankful for what you've done
[21:06] in my heart
[21:07] I still remember we went Sunday morning
[21:12] service

[21:20] he ministered that morning
[21:22] and he increased a real good message on
[21:25] having your personal Revelations
[21:30] not taking someone else
