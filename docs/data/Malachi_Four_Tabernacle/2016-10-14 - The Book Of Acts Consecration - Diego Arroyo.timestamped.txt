[4:45] Acts the first letter that Paul
[4:51] wrote was
[4:56] Thessalonians
[4:58] and this is a tremendous
[5:02] letter it's a tremendous
[5:05] book uh epist in which he brings a
[5:09] tremendous
[5:14] Revelations and We Know by the message
[5:16] of the
[5:17] hour that God has given to
[5:22] us that first Thessalonians chapter
[5:27] 4 speaks of our day

[5:33] there as we want to lay this scripture
[5:38] out the scene of chapter
[5:43] five you

[5:52] 4 uh it
[5:56] says verse
[5:58] 15
[6:04] for this we say unto you by the word of
[6:06] the Lord that we which are alive and
[6:09] remain the coming of the Lord shall not
[6:11] prevent them which are
[6:23] asleep for the Lord himself shall
[6:26] descend from heaven with the Shout with
[6:28] the voice of the archangel with the
[6:29] Trump of God and the dead and crash
[6:31] shall rise
[6:40] first then we which are alive and remain
[6:43] shall be caught up together with him in
[6:45] the clouds to meet the Lord in the air
[6:48] so shall we ever be with the
[6:58] Lord
[7:01] that's first
[7:06] Thessalonians we know
[7:08] that's this
[7:11] message simplified
[7:14] form it's the Lord
[7:16] himself that has
[7:18] descended Revelation

[7:25] Christ coming down from heaven with open
[7:29] book
[7:30] hand amen and he sent that book down to
[7:34] the seventh
[7:36] angel to open the
[7:38] seals and these seven
[7:41] Thunders these
[7:43] Mysteries begin to
[7:45] utter on the earth this
[7:48] Revelation is going to give a
[7:51] faith was going to give a Quicken

[8:26] Revelation Hallelujah was saying that in
[8:28] 62
[8:30] DEC he saw the vision the seven angels
[8:35] coming he was
[8:37] asking could this be if the vision was
[8:41] scriptural he said then it must be in
[8:43] the
[8:45] scripture if the vision is of god it
[8:49] must be
[8:50] scriptural and that's the first
[8:54] time his very

[9:02] revelation we know that Revelations is
[9:05] theeven
[9:07] SE this is the
[9:09] vision and when he receives this
[9:14] Revelation this great mystery begins to
[9:18] unfold well we know that that's for a
[9:21] purpose we know that that is to turn the
[9:24] hearts of the
[9:27] children back to the faith of the father
[9:30] we know that is to bring a loosing of
[9:33] the holy
[9:35] spirit because he brother said it had

[11:17] bride for
[11:19] rapturing it's the same
[11:24] thing mess open the word all this is
[11:33] synonymous so look this is what

[11:55] Thessalonians the same thing that Jesus
[11:57] told the disciples
[12:00] in
[12:02] one amen that times and
[12:06] Seasons you have no need to
[12:09] know well that's the seven
[12:14] SE spoke on that

[13:07] seal what is theeven SE the Lord himself
[13:12] is the Lord coming

[13:19] it
[13:23] up and and leave it in
[13:27] mystery and he speaks of the day when
[13:30] they will say peace and
[13:34] safety and then sudden destruction will
[13:38] come and he begins to talk about the
[13:40] children of the day and the Children of
[13:42] the
[13:45] Night those that are
[13:47] drunken the wine of her
[13:51] fornication
[13:53] sleep that's what the
[13:56] system of this Roman system has done to
[14:00] the whole world the Bible
[14:03] say they're all
[14:05] drunk they're all
[14:08] asleep they're all
[14:11] unconscious how does how are they
[14:14] drunken how are they
[14:16] asleep with all of the
[14:19] entertainment that has been put out
[14:22] there drunken
[14:25] with drunken
[14:27] with drunken with all kinds of social
[14:33] entertainment there
[14:36] sleep don't know it's all a great
[14:41] trap but the seven Thunders was going to
[14:44] aw
[14:48] the the Bible speaks a
[14:51] lot about people
[14:54] sleeping even from the book of
[14:57] Isaiah Jesus spoke of those who are
[15:01] asleep not asleep
[15:04] literally no human beings they live they
[15:07] eat they they work they do
[15:11] everything but in the spiritual
[15:16] realm amen amen
[15:19] hallelujah
[15:21] said take seven to
[15:26] wake Hallelujah while everybody's
[15:30] asleep there's somebody that is
[15:34] awake but I want to get to this here
[15:38] after he goes through all of
[15:41] that then he he sets this he begins to
[15:45] show us in the
[15:50] spirit
[15:52] amenu begins to show
[15:57] us
[15:59] Rejoice ever
[16:02] more pray without
[16:05] ceasing amen everything give
[16:08] thanks PR not the
[16:12] spirit despise not
[16:15] prophesy amen prove all things hold fast
[16:18] to that which is
[16:21] good see stain from all appearance of
[16:26] evil see sometimes
[16:29] brother Adam said it's not that we're
[16:31] doing
[16:33] evil but what we
[16:36] do has an
[16:40] appearance how many know that's the
[16:43] Bible how many know that's the
[16:46] message that's why brother
[16:48] Bram certain things in the
[16:51] message that people may want to
[16:56] ignore but they there
[16:59] maybe they're
[17:01] just
[17:05] don't it's not that sometimes we want to
[17:09] be
[17:11] religious is that sometimes we want to
[17:15] follow what the word
[17:17] says there's many things that socalled
[17:22] Christians or denominations
[17:25] do amen that have appearances
[17:31] ofil amen the word is calling
[17:36] Usain from all appearance
[17:41] of and then he says in verse
[17:44] 23 and the Very God of Peace
[17:49] amen how many know that this is the day
[17:52] when the God of Peace has made himself
[17:56] known amen didn't he say
[17:59] it is Shalom for the bride in this
[18:02] hour Shalom unto the Bride of Jesus
[18:06] Christ Romans

[18:11] Peace will
[18:14] quickly put Satan under your
[18:18] feet amen that's speaking to
[18:21] us of this last day the God of Peace
[18:25] brother bam said what was that cloud
[18:28] that
[18:29] appeared and the picture they
[18:32] took brother bam said that we preach on
[18:34] this
[18:35] before he said what was that what was
[18:39] that great that was
[18:41] Shalom that was
[18:45] jvh that was the one that
[18:47] told
[18:50] Moses I am that I am over there he was
[18:53] in a burning
[18:55] bush here he was in a cloud
[19:00] the God of Peace he said what was that
[19:04] shalom
[19:05] shalom so the God of
[19:10] Peace says sanctify you
[19:17] hold the scripture there

[19:23] Peace verse
[19:26] 23 sanctify you

[19:39] so that is what we're looking at
[19:42] tonight that word
[19:45] San
[19:48] means from from AEK
[19:56] word which means
[20:14] it means to be
[20:18] dedicated the very God of Peace
[20:23] Sanctified that word
[20:27] means
[20:29] to be
[20:30] dedicated to be set
[20:35] aside brother
[20:42] Saidi set aside
[20:45] for
[20:55] Hallelujah see the devil just likes to
[20:57] do that every every time I come up to
[21:02] preaches to restart the whole thing by
[21:25] itself so watch
[21:29] the very God of
[21:31] Peace sanctify you
[21:34] holy the word that is used there for
[21:39] sanctify is
[21:44] hag which means to
[21:47] hollow it means to be
[21:50] holy to render or
[21:57] acknowledge
[22:00] or to
[22:02] be vulnerable or
[22:08] H to separate from profane
[22:13] things to dedicate to

[23:10] inspiration because let us let us
[23:22] turn want to turn to Colossians chapter

[25:18] all
[25:20] amen now we got these scriptural
[25:23] [Music]
[25:25] bases to show us
[25:29] amen this inspiration
[25:32] tonight this is a a
[25:35] revelation of full
[25:39] surrenderance this is a
[25:41] revelation of full
[25:45] preeminence he is to have full
[25:49] preeminence in a in a bride in this
[25:52] hour the prophet taught us
[25:55] that if you want to really
[25:58] know more or hear more about this from
[26:01] the
[26:03] prophet listen to the message Christ is
[26:07] the mystery of God
[26:10] revealed you'll hear the prophet read
[26:12] the same scripture in
[26:16] Colossians you'll hear the prophet say
[26:19] God had preeminence in Jesus
[26:22] Christ and he is to have
[26:25] preeminence oversight
[26:29] leadership full
[26:31] control in his body the
[26:34] brother amen
[26:37] hallelujah hallelujah everything that
[26:39] was in God into
[26:42] Christ Christ said I do
[26:45] nothing except I see the father show me
[26:49] first amen amen he
[26:53] was fully
[26:56] surrendered to the of
[26:59] God would not go anywhere he would not
[27:01] do
[27:03] anything without God having
[27:06] preeminence amen amen see and this full
[27:12] preeminence that he wants to
[27:15] have in the bride in this
[27:18] hour remember we have spoke
[27:21] before on the burnt
[27:23] offering is that right how many remember
[27:27] that
[27:30] judges when Gideon was going to face the
[27:36] midianites amen amen after a prophet had
[27:39] came and gave his
[27:42] message the angel of
[27:44] God visited
[27:47] Gideon in the
[27:49] message have not I sent
[27:52] thee said's AE of the
[27:56] church
[27:58] and and if God be with us where be all
[28:00] his
[28:02] miracles brother bam said Gideon had
[28:05] been listening to the message of the
[28:10] Prophet amen hallelujah you have gone
[28:13] off the
[28:14] scene but the midianites the enemy was
[28:19] coming taking his
[28:21] Harvest taking everything they
[28:25] had amen amen amen M but
[28:30] before that Gideon could take and use
[28:33] the sword of the
[28:36] Lord because he's the one that
[28:39] screamed the sword of the Lord and
[28:44] the Hallelujah before you could say
[28:47] that there had to be a
[28:50] consecration had to be a burnt
[28:53] offering you had to tear down the
[28:56] altar
[28:57] that his father had for
[29:00] Idols amen and edify an altar for
[29:04] God and offer a burnt
[29:07] offering before he could handle the
[29:09] sword of the
[29:12] Lord
[29:13] amen we see that pattern I mentioned it
[29:16] the other
[29:18] day we see that pattern throughout the
[29:20] entire
[29:22] Bible from Genesis with
[29:25] Noah after came out of the
[29:29] Ark he gave a burn
[29:32] offering and then God showed him the
[29:36] token said in the token
[29:39] message and the Bible says in
[29:42] Genesis that rainbow was a token of
[29:47] God amen
[29:49] amen but before the
[29:53] token what is the token brother bam said
[29:58] the token is what made the tumor
[30:01] disappear to my
[30:03] wife what that third po power what's
[30:07] that the spoken
[30:09] word you
[30:11] understand but before the
[30:14] token Noah needed a burnt
[30:17] offering see a consecration that's what
[30:20] burn offering
[30:24] represents because it was to be given
[30:29] holy that's what the Bible said a burnt
[30:33] offering was holy given unto the
[30:37] Lord it wasn't just one part of it it
[30:41] was all
[30:43] given amen the the
[30:46] intros amen
[30:48] everything the body the meat the fat the
[30:53] strength amen the head the body
[30:57] everything was given fly given to the
[31:01] Lord that's why Paul is saying under the
[31:05] inspiration amen that the God of Peace
[31:08] May sanctify you
[31:12] holy amenu complete
[31:16] dedication amen a complete
[31:20] consecration is that right so the burnt
[31:24] offering is a sign to the bride
[31:28] this hour that there is
[31:32] need of complete death of
[31:36] self amen death to
[31:42] thoughts
[31:43] ideas
[31:45] Pride
[31:47] lust every halfway
[31:52] Christianity must be put on the altar of
[31:56] sacrifice
[31:57] to be burned by
[32:00] fire then comes the spirit of the
[32:03] Lord to be upon you if you read Judges
[32:07] chapter
[32:08] 6 until he did all of that with the burn
[32:12] offering until
[32:14] then the spirit of the Lord came upon
[32:18] Him amen hallelujah then he was able to
[32:23] go
[32:25] forth amen make the milites
[32:29] run is that right cause confusion in
[32:33] their
[32:34] Camp make them kill one
[32:37] another hallelujah hallelujah and
[32:42] run see giving them
[32:47] dreams about gide
[32:51] himself putting fear in your
[32:56] hearts
[32:58] why because he
[33:02] fully but before that brother said he
[33:04] was a
[33:08] scary he was
[33:09] hiding was running wasn't facing the
[33:14] challenge understand amen said full
[33:18] obedience entitles us to the
[33:23] Token brother said that before we can
[33:27] see the
[33:36] miracle before we can see the
[33:39] [Music]
[33:40] miracle we must be a miracle
[33:45] ourselves we must become a miracle of
[33:49] God then we can see the
[33:52] miracle brother Bram said that's the
[33:55] greatest Miracle there is
[33:59] is's a new
[34:00] birth amen amen in the message
[34:04] Paradox he spoke of many
[34:07] paradoxes stopping the sun opening the
[34:10] sea all these things he said but the
[34:13] greatest
[34:15] Paradox is the new
[34:20] birth amen
[34:23] amen
[34:25] so before we can see a
[34:29] miracle we must be a miracle
[34:32] ourselves we must become a miracle of
[34:36] God then we can see the
[34:38] miracle the token comes
[34:42] after of the burn
[34:45] offer the token is the power to fulfill
[34:50] the promises of the
[34:53] word amen it's the power
[34:57] for the
[34:58] Paradox it's in the
[35:02] token the
[35:03] token is the third PO is the power of
[35:07] the
[35:08] word is the power the
[35:13] Dynamics it's going to rise us out of
[35:15] here it's going to lift us up going to
[35:19] take us away catch us
[35:22] away amen amen hallelujah isn't that
[35:26] what we're looking for
[35:28] isn't that what we're all striving
[35:30] for
[35:33] amen see
[35:36] amen so as I've said we can go through
[35:41] many
[35:43] things Abraham on the
[35:47] mountain he offered he was going to
[35:52] offer I told him you you want to
[35:55] see spoken word
[35:58] power offer your son as a burn
[36:03] offer he did that amen amen he saw the
[36:08] creative power of
[36:11] God all right elah upon M
[36:15] carel had a burnt
[36:17] offering before the fire could fall from
[36:20] Heaven and burn the
[36:23] sacrifice and bring restore the rain
[36:26] back to his
[36:28] amen
[36:29] amen and he reped the
[36:32] altar see He restored to bring the
[36:35] hearts of the children back to
[36:39] the
[36:41] burn Jesus was the burnt
[36:44] offering offering killed on the on the
[36:48] north side of
[36:51] Jerusalem yes sir then the fire came
[36:54] down upon the 120
[36:58] is that
[37:03] right
[37:05] so the same thing
[37:07] Solomon in dedicating the
[37:10] temple before the
[37:13] glory could fill the temple he offered
[37:16] burn
[37:18] offerings hundreds
[37:20] of
[37:24] Amen see that's the pattern of the
[37:29] Bible burn offering
[37:32] first then the
[37:34] supernatural burn offering
[37:37] first then the the power to fulfill the
[37:40] promises of
[37:43] God burd offering first then the
[37:46] token and the token is the
[37:49] power to fulfill the promises of
[37:52] God and the Hebrew word for burnt
[37:55] offering
[37:57] is
[37:58] Ola which means that which Ascend and
[38:01] smoke to
[38:05] God being holy
[38:08] burnt reduced to
[38:11] ashes as a sweet smelling
[38:14] sa
[38:16] amen it could either be a
[38:19] bulock a her
[38:25] sheep
[38:27] fouls amen all of those things were
[38:31] offered in Burn
[38:33] offer bur bear
[38:37] sacrifice
[38:39] amen all of those
[38:42] things so in this
[38:46] hour that we live
[38:49] in brother
[38:50] BR became a burn
[38:54] offering his life
[38:58] amen and he said it
[39:03] himself we want to read tonight a little
[39:07] bit the message why Christ
[39:10] speak July
[39:13] 63 the B says lay aside everything
[39:17] else contrary to it remember this this
[39:22] is the truth regardless of how Financial
[39:26] how fin ially it
[39:28] seems everything
[39:30] else sometimes move right on with it
[39:34] it's the Holy Spirit the same God that
[39:37] raised up Jesus Christ from the
[39:40] dead the same one that can speak things
[39:43] into
[39:45] existence same one that lived in the
[39:47] days of
[39:49] Moses is the same
[39:51] today his call in this last
[39:54] day he's a vind
[39:59] as it was in the days of Sodom so shall
[40:01] it be at the coming of the son of
[40:03] man there is a Sodom down there there's
[40:07] a Billy Graham and an Oral Roberts out
[40:10] here and the church is moving
[40:14] on by the same signs that he
[40:17] promised both places there they are it
[40:21] is as he
[40:22] said oh Lord give me courage is my
[40:25] prayer
[40:28] help me oh Lord
[40:30] God I have to quit here it's getting
[40:32] late he
[40:34] say why cry to
[40:37] me why are you crying to me when I have
[40:41] proved to be with
[40:43] you haven't I healed your
[40:46] sick he' say brother bam is showing
[40:51] us that the message that he is preaching
[40:54] why Christ speak
[40:57] although this is
[40:59] 63 it's already seen things being
[41:02] created into
[41:05] existence he's already seen the opening
[41:07] of the
[41:08] word he's already seen Mighty things
[41:11] he's not praying for the Holy
[41:13] Ghost he already has it this is what
[41:17] people don't understand there is times
[41:20] when you need a
[41:23] rededication you need consecration
[41:27] you need to do something in your
[41:30] life amen to continue to
[41:34] advance if not you're going to be
[41:39] stagnant you're going to become
[41:42] still amen stale like bread that gets
[41:48] stale amen gets
[41:50] hard
[41:55] good you you you must
[42:00] realize that these things are
[42:04] necessary to advance with
[42:07] God that's why people become
[42:10] religious that's why people become
[42:13] bitter that's why people don't have no
[42:16] fruits of God in their
[42:19] life they have
[42:21] come to a certain point with
[42:25] God they have come to the word they love
[42:29] God they want to serve God but they
[42:33] don't know where to
[42:34] start they don't know what to do you
[42:38] understand what I'm saying this is what
[42:40] God is calling us he's trying to show us
[42:43] that we can see and understand
[42:46] this that this is needed in all of our
[42:50] Lives we we're not called to
[42:53] this just to come up to a certain point
[42:56] point in the
[42:58] message and then just stay
[43:02] stagnant there is need of a dynamic
[43:05] power in our
[43:07] lives and brother bam said the Dynamics
[43:11] for this
[43:12] bride is going to be a
[43:16] refilling he didn't say a filling in
[43:19] order to have a
[43:22] refilling you have to have first
[43:25] aill then a
[43:27] refilling amen so
[43:32] Dynamics to the mechanics a refilling of
[43:36] the Holy
[43:37] Ghost he said well rise this
[43:40] bride in
[43:42] the hallelujah amen amen this is the
[43:46] hour this is the time for that there's
[43:49] no time to
[43:50] waste so oh I'll consecrate my my life
[43:53] and I I'll get deeper with God
[43:59] when are you going to do it when are we
[44:02] going to come to that
[44:05] point God is calling our
[44:10] attention amen
[44:13] hallelujah watch what the prophet says
[44:17] here he said God give me
[44:20] courage to take the sword of the
[44:25] word he put in my hand about 33 years
[44:30] ago hold
[44:32] it March forward to the third pool my
[44:38] prayer he says let us bow our
[44:42] heads Heavenly
[44:44] Father the hour is growing
[44:47] late but the
[44:50] word is getting
[44:54] precious see
[44:57] although the conditions are getting
[45:01] worse in the world
[45:05] surroundings and brother bam said that
[45:07] in
[45:08] itself makes it
[45:11] hard for you to
[45:13] pray said questions and
[45:16] answers he said another reason
[45:19] why it's hard for people to get into
[45:23] prayer because there's no
[45:28] Ral
[45:33] pris not Pentecostal
[45:37] Revival they have an they have a
[45:39] different idea what a Revival
[45:42] is Prophet laid it out and showed us
[45:44] what Revival
[45:47] is
[45:49] rival people get back to the
[45:52] word
[45:54] hallelujah amen
[45:56] line themselves up with the
[45:59] word now
[46:02] watch he said the word is getting
[46:04] precious and we see it Lord Time After

[52:23] me I found myself not in the way that I
[52:26] thought I
[52:29] did but I found
[52:31] myself guilty of crying out all the
[52:36] time instead of

[52:42] on that I'll be a more consecrated
[52:46] servant not only me I pray
[52:49] for I pray for you

[53:42] humility walk in the
[53:44] spirit walk talk dress act like
[53:50] Christians humble and sweet don't let
[53:53] fail fail now
[53:56] the voice of God speaks through the
[53:58] word speaks through gifts as one gift
[54:02] comes another one expresses
[54:05] it that sure right with the word and
[54:08] right with the
[54:10] hour God is with us how we thank him for
[54:14] it with our heads
[54:16] bound he says a realization that Jesus
[54:21] said that Hearth my words believe on him
[54:24] that sent me
[54:26] have eternal life you shall not come up
[54:28] in the
[54:29] Judgment but has passed from Death un
[54:32] life knowing that we by the grace of
[54:35] God possess that within our
[54:38] bosom with a consecration to him this
[54:42] morning that our lives shall
[54:45] change from this day
[54:48] on will be more positive in our
[54:52] think we will try to live in such
[54:55] sweetness and
[54:57] humility believing that we ask
[55:00] God God will give it to each
[55:03] other and we will not speak evil against
[55:06] each
[55:08] other no shall pray for our
[55:12] enemies love them do good to them that
[55:16] do bad to
[55:18] us God is the
[55:21] judge
[55:24] right so after brother bam preached
[55:27] this amen and I believe that this is
[55:29] stimulating us
[55:37] to amen
[55:39] amen but after he said this in the
[55:42] morning why Christ
[55:45] speak speaking much about
[55:52] consecrating that
[55:54] evening he preached humble
[55:57] thyself and this is what he said as I
[56:00] brought that statement this
[56:03] morning the people was laying in the
[56:06] shadow of
[56:07] Peter they never even asked for
[56:11] prayer I have went into many
[56:14] homes watching this pray before I
[56:19] go and just go in there with the
[56:23] anointing don't even pray for the people
[56:26] walk out and they
[56:28] healing that's right I've seen it done
[56:31] so many
[56:33] times you've got to have you've got to
[56:37] have somewhere to place your
[56:40] faith you've got to believe it and I
[56:43] believe that the hour is
[56:45] approaching and now is says I realize
[56:49] that this is not a tape
[56:51] service might make a little one for
[56:54] themselves
[56:56] this is not a tape that goes on across
[56:57] the
[56:59] country this what I was speaking of this
[57:04] morning has brought us right up to a
[57:09] climax and that's the reason that I'm
[57:13] going to take next Sunday for healing
[57:18] service because since I have been
[57:22] home I told you about the visions and
[57:24] what's
[57:26] happened and everything and he brought
[57:28] it right
[57:29] up and why I have done all these
[57:32] things he says and this
[57:36] morning bringing it up now to the last
[57:43] pool now he says it's my time for
[57:48] consecration to
[57:52] God God's time to speak to me
[57:56] me I must just have a little change in
[58:00] my own
[58:02] life not as I think that I'm
[58:06] wicked but I want to feel a little more
[58:10] closer to
[58:13] people the people that I have tried to
[58:16] tell this gospel truth
[58:19] to you turn their back
[58:22] on walk away and laugh at
[58:25] not to me that seems like it's an
[58:29] insult I don't
[58:31] care but to the things that I've been
[58:34] saying is the truth trying to help
[58:38] them like shoving out a boat and say
[58:41] here it comes cross
[58:45] over get get out of the swelling stream
[58:47] you're going to
[58:49] die you're going to perish and they just
[58:53] laugh at you walk away
[58:55] well to me it feel like if you want to
[58:57] walk away there's nothing more that I
[58:59] can do about
[59:02] it see that I can do but I want to run
[59:05] down the bank
[59:08] now persuade them come
[59:11] back see I've got to have that feeling
[59:15] because I know there's somebody out
[59:17] there that hasn't come in
[59:20] yet and I'm going to fish he said until
[59:24] the last fish
[59:27] is I

[59:36] time amen for
[59:43] consecration

[59:51] time for consecration to God

[1:00:05] Bibles to the book of Jo chapter
[1:00:09] 2 we'll speak just for few more
[1:00:14] minutes I just wanted to lay just this
[1:00:17] thought
[1:00:22] out I believe
[1:00:26] God has given us a
[1:00:31] call chapter
[1:00:34] 2 we know that this
[1:00:38] is or it speaks of this
