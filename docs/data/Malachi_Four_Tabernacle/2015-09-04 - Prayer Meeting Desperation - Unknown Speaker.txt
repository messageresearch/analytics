TRANSCRIPT
========================================
if a man loves me keep my word we know that is true that God will meet a desperate Soul we all know that but it usually takes something to drive us into that into that despair into that desperation it takes something to do it and we find in James 515 that the effectual fervent prayer of the righteous man availeth much when a righteous man gets in travail or Soul travel see travail Soul travel Hallelujah you see what brother R is doing here Soul travel Amen brother it's connected with another realm your soul travels Amen to the throne of God to make your petition known boldly amen by Faith by the blood of Jesus Christ Paul said in Hebrews I make my petition known boldly Before the Throne of God amen amen hallelujah amen this is the reason why amen that we see here that the prophet is showing us what this is amen amen when we come the fervent prayer of a righteous man his soul gets in travail Soul travel I think travel is a better word amen a soul gets in desperation see in travailing an effectual fervent prayer of a man that can show the token you see that it can show that can show the token see brother and sister the token in prayer brother bam said every time that we're going to pray before God he said make sure you wave your token before God in every prayer amen what is the token that life inside of you brother that's the only thing that can pray in in the spirit like Jesus amen amen because brother Bram said when you pray like that in questions and answers on the seals they asked him that if Jesus was God how come he prayed to the father amen amen and he said you see he prayed to the spirit that was with inside of him amen amen and that Spirit Hallelujah within you will pray to the same spirit it's in contact Hallelujah the same way that the spirit was in Jesus praying to the father amen the spirit in you the holy spirit amen in the name of Jesus Christ well ask the father anything and it shall be given you and brother Bram say it isn't you praying no more it's the spirit praying inside of you the Bible says in Romans 8 that when we don't know how to pray or we what to pray the spirit itself maketh intercessions with groanings that cannot be uttered Hallelujah in other words it's not in your vocabulary it's not in your mind it's from your soul crying out to God in an unknown language that only the spirit realm knows Hallelujah your words can't express it your mouth can't say it it comes from your soul and God understands that kind of language Hallelujah God understands that kind of travail from the soul hallelujah hallelujah that kind of cry he said cry unto me and I will respond hallelujah hallelujah amen I will answer glory to God Amen and I will show you great things that you have not known hallelujah hallelujah that's the god that David said his ears are open to the prayers of the righteous and his eyes look down upon his Saints that's the god that we serve brother amen amen he says then there you are you're in prayer can confess Amen to me that you're wrong see and I love you well enough that I'll will pray for you and you pray for me and we'll stay with it with the effectual frent prayer until it's answered that's desperation amen hallelujah brother and sister whatever happened with praying till something happens does that does that nobody does that anymore you see what I'm saying that used to be brother Bram said amen the Church of old amen amen he said up in the hills of Kentucky they would pray till something happen hallelujah amen amen and brother Bram said that's the kind of thing that is desperation you stay with it until it's answered that's desperation that's what we should have listen what the prophet is saying all the time oh Hallelujah so what drives us into desperation love is that right and the reason we lack desperation because we lack love many times now notice he says let's he said let's take some scriptures here for example of this Jacob he was kind of a Carefree boy he thought his own mind that he knew the birth right meant everything to him and he didn't care how he got how how he had to get it but after he got it how many know what the what what the birth right represents it represents the Holy Ghost amen amen but listen to this sometimes once we get that we think that's it amen we think oh Hallelujah that's it I don't have to I don't have to be desperate anymore I was already desperate for it the night that I had my experience and now now I don't have to be desperate anymore that was Jacob amen amen once he got the birth right he thought everything was all right because he had the birth right he thought the thing was settled and he come up to his brother amen when he when he was hungry coming to the field from working and his brother needed a a a big pot of pottage we might have been tempting when a man is hungry working all day and his brother said I'm just ready to faint give me some of this he said well if he swear out to give me your birth right he didn't care how he done it he just got it and when when Jacob got the birth right he thought that settled it Pentecost that's where you failed thought because you were born of the spirit born of the spirit of God the birthright you thought that settled it but it only starts it you remember in the message hear ye him how that the child after it was born in the family he become a son it had rights to the birth right but it had to be proven it had to be child trained and if he did not prove out to be an obedient child to the father's will then well it didn't get what he didn't become Heir amen amen it it it it hired nothing yet it was a son but he hired nothing if he wasn't interested in the father's work and so when the Holy Ghost fell upon the Pentecostal people they began to restore back the gifts that was in the church and they thought because they were born of the spirit that settled it but you see there's got to be a placing of a son and after this to be a real son he was taken to a public place he was set up there and changed robes and sat there there was the placing of the son that he had heir of everything the father had now notice how the prophet is connecting he started off with Jacob then and then he says that's where Pentecost fell amen Amen brother it's not just the birth right the birth right brings you to the foundation of the P of the pyramid hallelujah hallelujah and without faith it is impossible to to please God but faith is revelation now get this don't miss this faith is at the bottom of the pyramid is that right amen amen and what is faith faith is a revelation is that right faith is a revelation a revelation something that has been revealed to you before it happened glory to God hallelujah before you come to Perfection you you have to have a revelation of perfection you understand so you're down here at the bottom of the P by faith you're seeing the Capstone of divine love hallelujah hallelujah and that vision of your faith is what's leading you to that climax it's what's leading you Hallelujah to that Perfection step by step hallelujah hallelujah amen faith upon Faith Revelation upon Revelation amen you're walking towards what you have before you you're walking walking towards your promise you're walking towards your full inheritance hallelujah hallelujah the huge portion of Heaven awaits you that's your inheritance hallelujah hallelujah it's the portion of Heaven that is granted unto you as a son that has come to be Heir hallelujah hallelujah doesn't the Bible say in genes in Revelations 21 that his son Jesus Christ is he he made him he of all things in the city is that right hallelujah amen brother he is showing that how that stature of a perfect man the fullness of Christ amen when he came to that positioning and the father gave him that Authority glory to God he became a with the father and he said all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth because he was given that Authority glory to God we become with Christ and coair hallelujah hallelujah amen amen amen that is the reason why this is about sunship hallelujah hallelujah it's not just amen am to have the life in you but the life in you is going to lead you it's going to it's going to show you every step of the way it's going to show you what you have to do in the father's business that's what the the spirit is for amen the spirit is not just to say I got the spirit that's what the Pentecostals did they got the spirit and they said I got the spirit that's good now that you got the spirit what is it going to do in you there it is you see what I'm saying the spirit in you will will fulfill the word for the hour spirit in you will bring to pass the predestinated scripture hallelujah hallelujah for the hour that you're living in and that's where they failed he says see there is an heir so when the Holy Ghost fell upon the Pentecostal people they thought that was it see but God did the same thing with his son amount Transfiguration and he trans figured before them said this is my beloved Son whom I'm well pleased Moses and the law failed but this is him hear ye him he was placed Jacob thought that the birth right made everything right so did the Pentecostals you see listen what he says and that's what got them fussing and pulling at one another it proved that the to token wasn't showing amen it proved that the token wasn't showing why listen brother because malice envy stri and these things but that's where it got to see the token wasn't showing it wasn't on display because they had malice because they had Envy because they had Strife see oh my amen amen hallelujah oh my Jacob thought the same thing in fear one night of his own life desperation took hold of him now what is brother Bram taking desperation to desperation why did Jacob get desperate to get the Holy Ghost no he already had it you understand he got desperate for adoption oh hallelujah oh my goodness you understand he got desperate for Perfection he he got desperate for the Capstone you understand amen you see he got desperate amen amen to come face to face with that angel hallelujah amen what happened with the prophet when he come to his adoption didn't he meet face to face with the same angel Hallelujah brother and sister it's a desperation you understand what I'm saying I hope you catch it glory to God Jacob got desperate for adoption he got desperate for Perfection that's a shadow that's a type hallelujah hallelujah of this day when adoption is available when perfection is here hallelujah hallelujah glory to God H oh desperation took a hold of him oh my the birth right wasn't enough amen amen amen the very Birthright was the thing that was going to cause his death and sometimes the very thing that you receive as the Holy Spirit it is and our Born Again of the spirit if you don't watch that same thing will condemn you at the end oh brother you understand I want you to get something before we get into prayer tonight amen amen I've just said it right now but I don't want you to miss it why is brother brandham after preaching the token amen amen he's showing that the Pentecostals when they had the birth right you understand amen they thought that that settled but they were not displaying the token the token brother is not at the bottom of the pyramid amen amen it's not no the token amen amen is up there Hallelujah the token is at the top brother and sister this is what the prophet is showing us in this message why did he preach desperation after he preached the token he told us the token did not come into existence amen amen until after the 14 days after the church ages are ended are you listening after the denomination ages from Ephesus are ended after the opening of the word that's when the token is available that's when a man amen came to Perfection hallelujah amen that's when he came to pel amen that's when he came face to face with that face that appeared in the heavens hallelujah amen amen he met God face to face he came to P desperation he already had the Holy Ghost he had already received the Holy Ghost in a little Shack amen amen and

already had the Holy Ghost Jacob already had the birthright are you getting it sisters Hallelujah you getting it Brothers amen amen sometimes we think amen that is just to get desperate for the Holy Ghost amen this is not what he's saying what did Jacob get desperate for amen amen he didn't get desperate for the birthright which is the type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost he got desperate for the token hallelujah amen amen he got he got desperate for Perfection amen he got desperate for adoption Hallelujah you see brother this is very important because the church gets relaxed amen amen and
