TRANSCRIPT
========================================
is that my father did not play foreign is holy ghost baptism he says don't resent that he said the rapture is in us now i will prove it by the gospel he justifies he justified is then god's the word that's what we're drinking amen hallelujah he said my word is meat and drink hallelujah very quickly because this amen so something like this keeps me up all night and then i come out of the office and i see daylight i don't even know where time went on so what time thank you lord into this you know especially here i am an hour later it's a lot of this quest and just being led to the spirit just just very few of those things was in our notes thank you lord amen do you believe in that that has to be something else of focus and uh not really um yes i don't really have to speak on this tonight but and i know i'm not gonna finish in other words the labels revelation 1 where the land had already opened six seals is that correct correct matthew 24. verse 1 and jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to shoot him the buildings of the temple all these things clearly i say to you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down it says he departed from the temple position amen that was making intercession amen john hadn't seen him because he was making intercession in the eternities this is the same man says to open the seals did jesus open the seals here jesus amen did jesus open the seals in matthew 24. amen yep yes see in the sixth seal sex will say just go in there by the way uh you can order the mp3s in spanish i'm studying something hallelujah the seals right here in 1924 so he's coming out of the temple to open the seals temple not all these should not be oh things will read verse three and as he sat upon the mount of olives see so he came out of the temple and he now he's on the mount of olives the disciples came unto him privately see saying tell us when shall these things be first question and what shall be the sign of thy coming second question and at the end of the world third question apart is three questions when they come when he came out of the temple it was in the morning he says here is that again he says now let us stop there these three verses it took place actually on tuesday afternoon taking place on tuesday evening this took place on he three questions oh foreign under the sixth seal foreign because if you say absolutely nothing you're wrong because in the sixth sex though amen is where the seventh trumpet sounds to the jews revelations that's because that's where the mystery live okay that's in the stadium when you look at those things you see what problems is going to do and look at this god's head you see what god has done if you can take those types of muscle people and tie it to the anti-toxic people according to what the prophet interpreted and you'll see exactly amen then it shows it reveals those he's going to begin amen is that's where he said jesus preached the seals yes amen okay first seal you can find it there i say amen he opened the seals in symbol form information he said what will it be when it's open in reality forms is so jesus opened the seals in civil war 1924 and foreign hey he even said it even before that they even asked a question in verse 2 but in verse 15 the reversal of king mentions it again the way that there's another see the foreign of desolation spoken by daniel the prophet instead of the holy place who read it let him understand yes what is the sign yeah female movement look at verse 6 of faith and you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that he may not trouble for all these things must come to pass but the ending is and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world and all the world amen for a witness unto the nations and then shall the income hello amen this message um look what he said oh how many remembers that it's right in there what is the copy of the son of man the lightning coming out of the east immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun regard the observatory he connected the cloud everybody's going to move on amen because we're not trying to repeat ourselves we're trying to clench the nails and make it whole where the devil can't shake that from you jesus omitted the seventh seal this is what we killed except he will say he teaches it in the sixth seal for exactly but look at this because okay verse 29 verse 18 see but like we just said but i want to mention that in within the mystery let me stay on the sixth season is the secret to the seventh i accept people right but this is where he really gets now to preaching on the seal itself verse 32 i learned a parable of the fig tree when the when his branches get tender and put it forth leaves you oh that is the fig tree i'm just going to go through the scriptures is what's in connection with them shall not pass till these things be fulfilled amen what did he say did he say but of that day an hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father amen no man he went over the day of the hour no there's no man hallelujah remember brother right here
