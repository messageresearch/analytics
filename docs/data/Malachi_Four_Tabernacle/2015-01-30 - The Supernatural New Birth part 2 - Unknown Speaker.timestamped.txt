[0:00] as we were looking
[0:02] at uh last
[0:04] Wednesday upon this
[0:06] subject we laid the
[0:09] foundation amen and those of you who
[0:11] were not here I don't know if our
[0:14] brother recorded it or
[0:15] not but
[0:18] anyway uh we laid the
[0:21] foundation for what we are speaking
[0:25] on the supernatural
[0:28] birth is something that you cannot
[0:32] receive unless you were in the mind of
[0:36] God as an
[0:38] attribute of him to be expressed in the
[0:41] hour which we are
[0:43] living and brother Adam
[0:46] said amen then it brings to us amen a
[0:51] supernatural
[0:53] birth amenu he said in the
[0:57] message lead not to your own
[0:59] understanding
[1:02] 1965 he says I got to try to
[1:06] explain how Paul speaking here he says
[1:10] who we in times
[1:13] P at one time we were dead in sins and
[1:18] trespasses who have God has quickened us
[1:22] God has made us
[1:24] alive and now
[1:26] seeing before
[1:28] anything before
[1:32] anything can be
[1:35] quickened amen amen before
[1:38] anything can be quickened there's got to
[1:41] be something
[1:43] there to be quickened
[1:45] by amen if you were in the for knowledge
[1:49] of
[1:50] God then you are becoming a part of
[1:53] God the only way you can be a Son of God
[1:56] or a daughter of
[1:58] God you have to be a part of
[2:00] God and God isn't
[2:03] complete without you Hallelujah that's
[2:07] right there is only one
[2:10] source of eternal life and that is God
[2:14] and him alone see so you were in his
[2:18] thinking in the beginning because he
[2:21] thought of you in the
[2:22] beginning it gives that little
[2:25] tug towards him when we're here on the
[2:29] Earth that's what it has to be
[2:32] quickened some of them will never be
[2:36] quickened they just don't have it that's
[2:40] all it's just like if you would put a
[2:41] grain of corn in the
[2:44] ground no ever how pretty it is if it's
[2:49] hybrid if it didn't have the germ of
[2:51] life in it it could never be
[2:54] quickened because the germ of life has
[2:58] to be there first
[3:02] and in order for that
[3:04] ger to come into a
[3:08] resurrection because that's what the
[3:09] power of quickening
[3:13] is the word
[3:15] quickening means to be brought back to
[3:18] life after being
[3:20] dead amen amen and what the
[3:23] seed that has the germ of life in it
[3:27] unless it falls in the ground
[3:30] and dies and rocks they cannot come into
[3:34] a
[3:36] resurrection that's exactly what Jesus
[3:38] was
[3:39] saying and this is what we spoke on last
[3:43] Wednesday amen just want to get you back
[3:46] into the
[3:48] channel that we were in on Wednesday so
[3:52] we can get into the furtherment of
[3:55] this and advance in this
[3:58] subject if you were here
[4:00] here and you
[4:02] remember amen the Bible said the spirit
[4:06] of Truth was going to show us things to
[4:10] come and he would bring to our
[4:13] REM what the word
[4:15] say now in the
[4:18] message M of
[4:20] Gilead brother man speaks of the new
[4:23] birth he said what it is is dying to our
[4:28] thoughts Dy to are thinking to receive
[4:32] the mind of
[4:33] Christ and when you approach him you
[4:36] cannot think your
[4:39] thoughts amen that's why many people
[4:42] when they want to receive something from
[4:44] God they fail to receive it because they
[4:48] were approaching God in the way they
[4:51] think it should
[4:52] be but that's not the way we are to
[4:56] approach God we are to surrender
[5:00] what we think what we want how we think
[5:04] and we must come to his
[5:06] presence full
[5:08] surrenderance only with the
[5:11] words only with his thoughts only with
[5:15] his
[5:16] ideas of that are in the word of how he
[5:20] wants me to receive from him amen and
[5:26] brother said that's why a lot of people
[5:30] don't receive nothing because they're
[5:33] not willing to die and rock to that kind
[5:37] of
[5:40] things they said well if I go I want him
[5:43] to do this I'm not going to act this way
[5:47] or I'll just you know
[5:50] scream when he touches me or I'll speak
[5:54] in
[5:55] tongues or someone else might say I
[5:57] won't do
[5:58] nothing
[6:00] I'll just receive it and be
[6:03] calm any of those
[6:06] things is your
[6:09] mind any of those things is what you
[6:13] think what you want and how you
[6:17] think you're already coming with your
[6:21] premeditated
[6:22] ideas of how you want to
[6:26] receive hallelujah hallelujah but
[6:28] brother M say
[6:30] you must get that out of your mind you
[6:33] must think his thoughts let the mind
[6:36] that was in
[6:37] Christ in you and he thinks God's
[6:41] thoughts brings God's
[6:43] blessing it brings God's power it'll
[6:46] make a mess out of you as far as the
[6:49] world is
[6:50] concerned but it'll bring life it bring
[6:54] resurrecting
[6:56] life it will bring new thoughts it will
[7:00] bring a new person it will bring a new
[7:02] faith it will bring you from death un to
[7:07] life hallelujah hallelujah the new birth
[7:10] doesn't matter how messy it
[7:12] is amen amen but you have to be willing
[7:17] to lay your pride down amen and then
[7:21] come to him but you'll come out from
[7:25] there a different
[7:27] person born of the spirit of God
[7:30] a new creature in Christ
[7:32] Jesus it'll do something to you no
[7:35] matter how meesy it
[7:37] looks you might fall and
[7:40] S and Carry On In The Altar whatever you
[7:44] have to do all the unnecessary
[7:48] things that you think you wouldn't do it
[7:53] will make you do
[7:56] it well that's not necessary well it's
[8:01] necessary that you
[8:03] surrender amen and whatever happens
[8:06] after that it was
[8:09] necessary hallu because it is
[8:12] necessary that you be born again it is
[8:17] necessary that you die out it is
[8:20] necessary that we rock to our
[8:23] mind and let his mind come living us
[8:28] hallelujah
[8:31] that's
[8:32] necessary to God so we we
[8:36] realize that we as the predestinated
[8:40] word how many remember that have to
[8:44] meet with the written word for the hour
[8:49] you are the predestinated word and the
[8:52] message is the written word for the hour
[8:57] amen when you meet that
[9:00] word when you meet this Living Word this
[9:03] message amen Ain alive this day for this
[9:08] hour the scriptures pertaining for this
[9:12] day those are the ones that Quicken
[9:16] what's in
[9:17] you we cannot be quickened by Luther's
[9:21] message we cannot go to a Lutheran
[9:24] Church and sit in the
[9:26] congregation and hear the pastor
[9:29] Lutheran preach a Lutheran message and
[9:32] be Quicken it cannot happen and if
[9:36] someone it's quickened by Lutheran
[9:39] message that's where they
[9:43] belong Hallelujah but not an of God for
[9:47] this hour amen that kind of Tommy Rock
[9:51] doesn't
[9:53] satisfy amen because it's rotten already
[9:57] glory to God amen that message is gone
[10:01] by amen there's something that the soul
[10:05] that is
[10:06] predestinated to receive the word of
[10:08] this house there there's a hunger in
[10:11] there to hear this
[10:15] message amen and when you hear it you
[10:18] know that that's what you
[10:20] want because God predestinated you for
[10:24] the foundation of the world that he knew
[10:28] you would come to a certain spot we read
[10:31] the the
[10:32] quotes in the message things that are to
[10:35] be amen what brother Adam said we we
[10:39] spoke this last
[10:40] Wednesday he said the day you were going
[10:44] to be born again God knew that before
[10:48] the foundation of the world that was an
[10:51] original thought in the mind of God so
[10:55] when the time comes for you to receive
[11:00] amen that quicking power in your soul
[11:04] that is that
[11:06] thought from eternity taking place in
[11:12] manifestation inside of you God knew
[11:15] that that's why we read right
[11:18] now in in lean
[11:20] not on your own understanding that
[11:24] unless you were a thought of
[11:26] God Amen in the mind of God
[11:29] to be born again you can't be
[11:33] quicked what he said when you're here on
[11:35] the earth and you are a thought then you
[11:39] feel a little
[11:42] Tong towards him Hallelujah and he said
[11:46] that little tug is what has to be
[11:50] quick so brother and sister you got to
[11:53] be
[11:55] drawn Amen to that word that's why Jesus
[11:59] said amen all that the father has given
[12:03] me will come to
[12:05] me hallelujah hallelujah there's a
[12:10] drawing and he said no one come come to
[12:14] me except my father
[12:18] draws so there has to be
[12:21] a there's got to be something drawing
[12:25] you pulling you hallelujah hallelujah so
[12:29] notice this when you come to that
[12:32] word that is the quickening
[12:35] power because the life is in the word is
[12:40] that right the life is in the word amen
[12:45] and that's the holy spirit for our day
[12:49] that's why brother R said the word that
[12:54] come on the day of Pentecost does not
[12:58] work for us today
[13:00] hu amen
[13:03] invisible
[13:05] 1965 the word that came on the day of
[13:09] Pentecost does not work for us
[13:13] today that's where he said it
[13:17] Union notice he never said the
[13:21] anointing he never said the quicking
[13:23] power he never said the spirit he said
[13:27] the
[13:28] word am that come on the day of
[13:31] Pentecost doesn't work for us
[13:36] today brother and sister this is what I
[13:40] just said you can only be
[13:43] quickened by the word of this hour
[13:50] huj amen because there is a
[13:54] many preaching what was given on the day
[13:57] of Pentecost
[14:01] and that ain't the message for this
[14:04] hour
[14:05] amen amen go to an Apostolic Church
[14:09] they'll tell you what Peter preached on
[14:11] the day of
[14:12] Pentecost but that message ain't quick
[14:15] in me
[14:17] brother hallelujah hallelujah is that
[14:21] right to God go to UPC
[14:27] Church amen they'll tell you
[14:29] what happened on day of Pentecost and
[14:32] what that word is and they're still on
[14:35] the same
[14:36] word but brother said amen that Malachi
[14:42] 4 glory to God was to
[14:45] restore back to the faith of the Father
[14:49] the original Faith the
[14:52] life amen in her will be the fullness of
[14:58] Pentecost is fullness time this is not
[15:03] portion Hallelujah this is the fullness
[15:07] of the
[15:08] manifestation of the word of God all
[15:12] amen that the prophets has spoke of all
[15:16] amen that the
[15:18] scriptures were
[15:20] announcing hallelujah hallelujah that
[15:23] Jesus was
[15:25] reflecting in the
[15:27] Fulfillment as the full
[15:30] of the word of
[15:32] God hallelujah that
[15:35] is the fullness of the
[15:41] manifestation of God's
[15:43] word in
[15:47] manifestation amen he was going to in
[15:50] this
[15:51] day make a
[15:54] formation of his
[15:56] bride amen amen be in the same
[16:00] image to be in the same
[16:03] Unity to be in the same
[16:05] connection to be in the same
[16:10] reflection of that mystery because Jesus
[16:15] was
[16:16] revealing the
[16:19] father amen Jesus was revealing the
[16:24] father and the bride is revealing Christ
[16:31] huj you
[16:33] understand that's why brother
[16:36] preached Christ is the
[16:39] mystery of God
[16:42] revealed amen and that was
[16:45] hidden until this day it was going to
[16:49] break to
[16:51] bring amen a new
[16:54] birth you say what does that have to do
[16:58] you're talking about the new birth
[16:59] brother
[17:00] Diego and now you're talking about the
[17:02] mystery that was hidden in
[17:04] God what does that have to do with the
[17:06] new
[17:07] birth that's what people today don't
[17:12] understand because in the message Christ
[17:15] is the mystery God
[17:17] revealed he said that
[17:19] mystery personally revealed to you is
[17:24] the new
[17:25] birth
[17:27] Hallelujah
[17:29] what's the new
[17:32] birth what's a supernatural
[17:35] birth that
[17:36] mystery personally revealed to
[17:44] youu how many has read that how many has
[17:47] heard brother say that Christ is a Myst
[17:52] revealed amen so brother and sister
[17:56] that's the reason why that has to come
[18:00] by the
[18:01] revelation of this hour to bring you a
[18:05] new
[18:07] birth and that mystery wasn't known
[18:12] until the seventh
[18:13] seal was
[18:15] broken that was the
[18:18] secret that Jesus
[18:20] mentioned in Matthew
[18:23] 24 where he said no one
[18:25] knows he omitted the Seven Seals
[18:29] when he was preaching did Jesus preach
[18:32] Seven
[18:35] Seals where your Prophet said in Matthew
[18:40] 24 amen that's where Jesus preaches
[18:43] seven
[18:44] SE and when he come to the seventh seal
[18:48] he
[18:49] omitted he
[18:50] said I don't know nothing about it amen
[18:54] not even the angels in
[18:56] heaven only my father has kept this to
[19:00] himself Hallelujah hu glory to God when
[19:04] brother
[19:05] preaches Christ is a mystery he says
[19:09] this was the
[19:11] secret that Jesus couldn't speak of when
[19:15] they asked him about that and he said
[19:18] only the father knew not even the angels
[19:21] in heaven Hallelujah hallu but he said
[19:25] this mystery GL to God he connected with
[19:29] the seven
[19:30] seal and he said it's the same mystery
[19:33] amen John was forbidden to
[19:36] write glory to God Amen he didn't make
[19:40] it
[19:41] known glory to God but in the days of
[19:45] the seventh Angels message when he shall
[19:48] begin to
[19:50] sound the
[19:52] mystery what
[19:53] mystery it doesn't say
[19:56] Mysteries read the Bible
[19:59] it says the
[20:03] mystery the mystery of God would be
[20:09] finished that mystery that was hidden
[20:14] secret would be made known hallelujah
[20:17] hallelujah at the
[20:19] sounding of the seven
[20:22] th and this is what
[20:24] brings a new birth into the soul
[20:29] of the predestinated
[20:32] seed Peter said born of The
[20:35] Incorruptible
[20:37] seed hallelujah hallelujah and the
[20:40] Original
[20:42] Seed was
[20:46] Incorruptible but when but when
[20:49] Satan amen injected
[20:53] himself
[20:55] injected into the human race
[20:59] amen amen if
[21:01] Adam sin come into the
[21:05] World by
[21:09] woman oh scripture doesn't say
[21:12] that it come in by
[21:15] man because Adam amen
[21:20] knowing amen he gave
[21:24] himself he
[21:26] participated amen amen Romans 8 he
[21:31] brought all
[21:33] nature into
[21:35] bondage yes is that
[21:37] right he brought all
[21:40] Humanity into
[21:42] slavery of
[21:44] sin amen because he was in
[21:47] control it was up to him what was to be
[21:51] done but he
[21:53] forfeited amen eternal
[21:56] life upon the Earth
[22:01] amen amen and when that took
[22:05] place then that
[22:09] race of Incorruptible
[22:11] SE fell into
[22:17] corruptable because now the
[22:20] sons were
[22:22] born
[22:24] corrupt Hallelujah but from the
[22:27] beginning they were going to be
[22:30] born from
[22:33] Incorruptible how many remember last
[22:35] Wednesday we spoke about
[22:39] Adam amen he come to the full
[22:45] manifestation of the thought of
[22:48] God is that right correct amen God
[22:51] didn't bring
[22:53] Adam through a
[22:55] process
[22:57] justification ification baptism of the
[23:00] Holy Ghost and then bring him to
[23:03] Perfection oh no Adam didn't go to no
[23:06] process he come from the
[23:09] beginning by the spoken word of God born
[23:13] by the
[23:14] spirit Luke 1 says he was the son of God
[23:20] Amen Lord of Incorruptible
[23:23] SE brought to the Earth in full
[23:27] manifestation
[23:29] of the etal
[23:32] God but he fell
[23:34] from amen and now all his
[23:39] children
[23:41] amen the Bible says if you read the
[23:45] generations of
[23:48] Adam in Genesis chter
[23:51] 5 he says he began to uh be he beg got
[23:57] children amen amen and he beg got
[24:01] Seth In His
[24:03] Image and his
[24:06] likeness amen
[24:09] hallelujah and what image did he
[24:14] have fallen
[24:17] image at one time at one time according
[24:22] to Genesis
[24:24] 126 he said the God said let us make man
[24:29] in in our image in our
[24:32] likeness and they made it
[24:37] Incorruptible but after the
[24:39] fall Adam had children by sex because of
[24:44] the Fall amen and the Bible says that
[24:49] they he had children and said was his
[24:54] was in his
[24:55] likeness and His image
[24:59] amen that's why no one can be born of
[25:05] The Incorruptible
[25:07] seed by the natural
[25:10] birth Hallelujah not just because they
[25:14] were sons of Adam oh we're sons of
[25:18] God we've been born by Incorruptible
[25:21] seed amen amen by natural
[25:26] image they were sons of God that's right
[25:29] right but not by
[25:33] Spirit how many
[25:36] understand because the Bible
[25:39] says in the very next chapter Genesis 6
[25:44] there was much sin
[25:48] corruption
[25:49] violence right God's
[25:53] heart amen was
[25:56] sadden he repented
[25:59] of making
[26:01] man and then he said that the sons of
[26:05] God saw that the daughters of men were
[26:09] fair and took unto them
[26:13] wiv and then they mixed and mingled the
[26:17] seeds amen amen that's the very reason
[26:20] why God brought the
[26:22] flood is that right Hallelujah cuz they
[26:25] mix the natural
[26:27] seed you see those that when the Bible
[26:29] speaks of the sons of God saw that the
[26:33] daughters of
[26:34] men brother tells you the daughters of
[26:38] men were those from the seeds of
[26:41] Cain and the sons of God were from the
[26:44] natural
[26:46] lineage of of Adam ofel is that right
[26:51] but those same sons of
[26:55] godish in the yes amen those same sons
[26:59] of God were in
[27:02] hell when Jesus went down there to
[27:06] preach to them that they had not
[27:09] repented in the days of
[27:12] Noah you say the sons of God went to
[27:15] hell
[27:17] natural flesh no true Son of God the
[27:22] Eternal thought of God predestinated of
[27:25] God will ever be in hell
[27:29] that's right there's no scripture for
[27:31] that there's no quote and there's no
[27:35] message it's not
[27:37] scriptural for a predestinated
[27:43] son to be in
[27:45] Hell how come those were sons of God and
[27:50] they went to hell they were sons of God
[27:53] by
[27:55] flesh because that that seed
[27:59] was now
[28:01] corruptible amen it was not
[28:04] Incorruptible no
[28:06] more it's the same way today just
[28:10] because your father is filled of the
[28:14] Holy Spirit does it mean that his
[28:17] children are born of of Incorruptible
[28:22] seed just because somebody was born in
[28:25] this message doesn't make them Son of
[28:29] God they've got to be born of
[28:34] Incorruptible they've got to be born
[28:37] again because that birth that they're
[28:40] born with is under bondage of
[28:44] sin and
[28:48] corruption that's what Jesus when he
[28:51] come he come by the spoken
[28:54] word he come by Supernatural birth
[28:59] hallelujah hallelujah and his first
[29:01] Doctrine was you must be born
[29:06] again hallelujah hallelujah of the water
[29:10] and of the spirit of the word and of the
[29:14] quickening
[29:16] power
[29:17] amen that's why each age was s an
[29:22] anointing to come back the Antichrist
[29:26] spirit and that anointing
[29:29] is what Picken the
[29:30] word for the hour which they were
[29:33] living the the the the
[29:36] anointing of the spirit of God that was
[29:39] sent in the days of Luther was the face
[29:42] of a man and it quickened the scripture
[29:47] in Romans the just shall live by faith
[29:51] what was that that was the Holy Spirit
[29:56] for that Hour Quick the word for that
[30:00] hour to the predestinated
[30:02] seat amen and they were sealed until the
[30:07] day of their
[30:08] Redemption because they were under that
[30:10] quickening power of the
[30:13] word having received all of the light
[30:18] for their age in the first seal brother
[30:21] Adam says they were sealed until the day
[30:25] of their
[30:26] Redemption and in the
[30:29] resurrection they will
[30:31] rise hallelujah hallelujah because they
[30:34] were part of the
[30:36] word amen before the foundation of the
[30:40] world they were a thought to fulfill the
[30:45] word in the age in which they live
[30:48] in but our
[30:50] anointing is different our anointing
[30:54] make the face of a man our anointing
[30:58] Hallelujah is the E power it's a
[31:02] prophetic
[31:03] anointing that
[31:04] quickens not only one word not only one
[31:09] scripture not only five scriptures it
[31:12] opens the whole
[31:14] Bible so open to the believer in this
[31:17] hour you see how it's a different
[31:20] anointing you see how this Birth has to
[31:23] do with the mystery that was in the
[31:27] might of God
[31:29] the foundation of the
[31:33] worldj because even Paul amen spoke of a
[31:37] day that Perfection was going to come
[31:41] Hallelujah Paul said when that day comes
[31:45] we shall see face to face glory to
[31:50] godu
[31:52] amen and you see in this
[31:56] fulfillment of the word of God there is
[32:00] a
[32:01] birth that has to take
[32:03] place amen and that's
[32:07] Supernatural
[32:10] Supernatural Oh Glory to
[32:15] godah notice in the message the word the
[32:20] world is again falling
[32:22] apart he says God only promised to to
[32:29] anoint his
[32:32] word amen
[32:35] amen I know that is
[32:38] scorchy but that's what it that's what's
[32:41] the
[32:42] truth God never
[32:44] changes he anoints his
[32:48] word yes sir the anointed promise
[32:53] word for that age is what God anoints
[32:58] did you hear that the anointed promised
[33:02] word for that age is what God
[33:07] ano word for
[33:13] the the message why little
[33:16] be says oh God anoint us with th
[33:22] word and bring Thy
[33:25] word
[33:26] promise to this day bring it to
[33:32] pass Amen in the message
[33:35] testimony he says I tell you this
[33:37] morning I bring you
[33:41] record have you ever seen the gift of
[33:44] God fail one
[33:47] time
[33:48] no read about it this
[33:51] morning no sir it's Jesus Christ it
[33:56] can't fail
[33:58] science has proved it the church knows
[34:01] it and he is here right now right at
[34:05] this minute he is here and the only
[34:09] thing it
[34:11] lacks is for your
[34:13] faith to pick up that
[34:16] word and anoint it to
[34:22] yourself amen that's the thing brother
[34:26] that's why people can't can't be
[34:28] quickened by the
[34:29] word because they don't have faith in
[34:33] what's being being
[34:34] preached they don't believe that what's
[34:37] being preached is
[34:42] God they don't believe the pillar of
[34:44] fire the holy spirit is right here right
[34:49] now they don't believe that there's a
[34:51] living
[34:52] voice of the blood that is speaking
[34:56] better things
[34:58] in the voice
[35:01] of they don't believe that there's a
[35:04] final voice to the final
[35:08] hallelujah
[35:10] hallelujah but when you can one see amen
[35:14] that is the word for this hour for this
[35:18] moment for this time that we're in then
[35:22] you can apply
[35:24] Faith Amen to that word
[35:28] anointed to yourself and he will bring
[35:32] it
[35:35] to Hallelujah Hallelujah he will heal
[35:39] you he will F you he will give you what
[35:44] you have need of but you got to
[35:47] believe truly the word of
[35:51] God hallelujah hallelujah am that's why
[35:56] Jesus do many mighty
[35:59] works because of
[36:01] unbelief Brother people don't
[36:03] realize that our faith towards the word
[36:08] can
[36:09] change the
[36:11] atmosphere can change the course of the
[36:15] service and change the preacher
[36:19] preaching
[36:21] amen yeah but also our
[36:26] unbelief our resist
[36:28] IST our funny
[36:30] feelings our little idea can also hinder
[36:35] the word from
[36:40] FL
[36:42] yes
[36:45] Amen to
[36:49] God Amen in the
[36:51] message
[36:55] expectations he says you're the sons and
[36:57] and Daughters of

[37:39] away
[37:43] from come on but until then amen amen
[37:48] watch
[37:48] out
[37:50] Satan hasn't got any legal rights right
[37:54] at all over a Christian every time a man
[37:58] gets

[38:44] can't be
[38:48] impersonated right did you get

[39:06] God by the word of your age and you
[39:10] receive a true
[39:11] birth then your soul Hallelujah that
[39:15] changes it from unbelief to Faith that's
[39:20] why that scripture Mark 11 says if you
[39:25] believe amen that what you say and don't
[39:31] doubt in
[39:35] where in your heart and don't
[39:39] doubt in your
[39:41] heart hello somebody is anybody
[39:45] understanding and don't doubt in your
[39:48] heart if there is doubt in your heart
[39:53] there can't be Faith at the same time
[39:57] either fa or die Hallelujah
[40:01] Hallelujah with the power of the Holy
[40:05] Ghost comes into the soul it changes you
[40:09] pushes out that unbelief and replaces it
[40:13] with faith so that's a new birth it's
[40:17] Faith the holy spirit in your
[40:22] soul and if that faith is in the soul
[40:27] then you can
[40:28] believe what you say and not doubt in
[40:32] your heart and what you
[40:34] say come to
[40:37] pass hallelujah

[42:24] see
[42:25] Messiah and he
[42:27] had been
[42:29] quickened by the word to fulfill that
[42:33] word in the hour in which he was living
[42:37] and he lived
[42:40] Malachi he lived Revelations

[43:07] Messiah remember how we said the other
[43:10] day now get this real good when brother
[43:13] B in the message
[43:16] influence he had been preaching the word
[43:20] speaking about the
[43:22] influence how the mighty Angel the Holy
[43:26] Spirit brought a coal of
[43:28] fire touch the lips of
[43:31] Isaiah amen he said that's the holy
[43:34] spirit amen because we are a people of
[43:38] unclean lips amen a man of unclean lips
[43:42] but what cleanses your
[43:44] lips what cleanses your life is the Holy
[43:48] Ghost brother said fire
[43:53] represented the baptism of the Holy
[43:56] Ghost
[43:57] then he he begins to talk about the
[44:00] word begins to talk about the opening of
[44:02] the
[44:03] word amen and then he says people you're
[44:08] not
[44:10] responding to the
[44:12] word and he says

[45:17] something more
[45:19] visible something more you see oh he can
[45:22] discern that's real that's
[45:25] this and people once they look at
[45:29] something like
[45:30] that they they get
[45:33] accustomed to that and when something
[45:37] when God gives something
[45:40] else further than
[45:42] that they can't go to
[45:45] that that's what's happened in the
[45:49] message people today you hear comments

[47:05] opening of the
[47:08] word how can
[47:10] Pentecostals only
[47:12] response Amen to a Pentecostal
[47:16] preacher and not when the message of God

[56:15] perform or
[56:17] vindicate his word when the church
[56:19] explains it
[56:21] away and says oh it's that it's it's
[56:24] that other thing for some other day how
[56:28] can God who wants to fulfill his
[56:32] word perform his
[56:35] word among the people and the people
[56:38] deny that he does it yet they go through
[56:42] all the
[56:44] rituals amen they go through all the

[57:43] birth
[57:48] Hallelujah brother and
[57:51] sister sometimes we fail to
[57:54] realize I've I've preached this a few
[57:57] weeks before maybe a month I don't
[58:02] know that when
[58:05] we when we are here in
[58:09] service we not only are here for
[58:15] ourselves amen
[58:17] amen cuz if we're here for
[58:20] ourselves then however you
[58:24] feel that's how you you will be in the
[58:28] service but when you have a
[58:31] revelation you're you're here also for
[58:36] others you want to create an
[58:40] atmosphere for other no matter how you
[58:45] right yes
[58:47] sir
[58:49] amen and brother Bram said that's what
[58:53] happened on the day of
[58:55] Pentecost
[58:57] when they came out of that Upper
[58:59] Room the others that were
[59:02] there they said what shall we do to be
[59:09] saved right because they they felt that
[59:14] atmosphere and they
[59:16] wanted the same thing that's good and
[59:19] they begin to cause a domino
[59:22] effect is that right
[59:25] amen let us go to St John
[59:29] 16 just for a few
[59:33] moments verse
[59:36] 21 this is the
[59:38] message or the
[59:41] text brother was looking
[59:45] for when he preached birth
[59:49] pain remember we mentioned
[59:53] this on last Wednesday
[1:00:01] Hallelujah St John
[1:00:03] 16 verse
[1:00:06] 21 a woman when she is in
[1:00:08] travail have
[1:00:10] sorrow because her hour is come but as
[1:00:14] soon as she is delivered of of the child
[1:00:18] she remember no more the anguish for joy
[1:00:22] that a man is Born Into the
[1:00:24] world
[1:00:39] amen
[1:00:40] amen so the thing
[1:00:43] is the woman is in
[1:00:47] travail amen she's in birth
[1:00:50] pain her hour is
[1:00:54] come so this is the
[1:00:57] thing that when a woman in order to give
[1:01:02] birth she has to be under a certain
[1:01:07] atmosphere even says that if you catch
[1:01:11] this this is also
[1:01:14] true for the supernatural
[1:01:18] birth because brother B says in the
[1:01:21] natural
[1:01:22] birth the last months
[1:01:27] of that woman's
[1:01:30] pregnan there comes a real sweetness
[1:01:34] about the
[1:01:35] woman no matter
[1:01:38] how you
[1:01:39] know bitter she might
[1:01:43] be but there's a certain sweetness about
[1:01:50] her
[1:01:51] says because there's an
[1:01:54] angel
[1:01:56] around
[1:01:58] her and it's the
[1:02:01] angel of that
[1:02:04] baby
[1:02:07] hallelujah amen
[1:02:09] amen and she becomes real
[1:02:13] sweet
[1:02:15] because said the
[1:02:17] moment that that baby is
[1:02:20] born there's a spirit
[1:02:23] there amen amen
[1:02:26] to go into that baby the spirit is not
[1:02:29] in the
[1:02:30] baby while it's in the mother's
[1:02:34] womb amen hallelujah the spirit is
[1:02:38] there once it comes
[1:02:41] out out of the mother's
[1:02:44] wom is that right
[1:02:47] amen when
[1:02:49] Jesus was in the womb of
[1:02:53] Mary amen he was not
[1:02:56] being
[1:02:58] fed of
[1:03:00] Mary he was not
[1:03:03] grown because of what Mary
[1:03:06] ate hallelujah amen he wasn't in any
[1:03:12] ways made out of her her
[1:03:16] amen is that right amen amen or Joseph
[1:03:23] se he was directly
[1:03:27] of a supernatural
[1:03:29] Purpose By The spoken word of
[1:03:32] God while he was in the
[1:03:37] development after he was
[1:03:40] begotten amen he was
[1:03:43] begotten then he had to be
[1:03:45] born is that right amen so in that
[1:03:51] process God had to have a woman
[1:03:57] to put that word
[1:04:00] inside who was prophesied in the
[1:04:03] scriptures amen so a supernatural
[1:04:07] birth amen if you're understanding
[1:04:11] correctly has to have amen a place where
[1:04:16] it takes place and there has to be an
[1:04:19] atmosphere to bring that
[1:04:23] birth brother B says this
[1:04:26] words he said Mary was the
[1:04:31] incubator how many know what an
[1:04:33] incubator
[1:04:36] is an
[1:04:38] incubator is when a child is born IM
[1:04:43] premature amen perhaps three months five
[1:04:47] months they're putting an
[1:04:50] incubator because that child has not
[1:04:54] developed until the time or the point
[1:04:57] where it is to be born in in the ninth
[1:05:00] month
[1:05:03] process is that right so until that time
[1:05:08] if it comes
[1:05:10] prematurely it has to be put in an
[1:05:13] incubator in that
[1:05:15] incubator there is the same
[1:05:19] temperature that was in his mother's
[1:05:22] womb and they know by science what
[1:05:26] temperature is in the womb of the
[1:05:29] woman while that child is in the womb
[1:05:34] developing and growing amen and it is a
[1:05:39] very high
[1:05:41] temperature amen
[1:05:43] hallelujah it's not a
[1:05:47] cold
[1:05:48] Hallelujah come on brother it it it it's
[1:05:52] not a freezing
[1:05:54] temperature it's a real hot
[1:05:58] temperature it's an
[1:06:00] atmosphere that that child has to be in
[1:06:04] in order to come to
[1:06:06] birth correctly you understand so when
[1:06:10] brother mam says that Mary was an
[1:06:14] incubator in other words
[1:06:16] Mary was the wound to have that
[1:06:21] atmosphere of that temperature of that
[1:06:24] heat to bring a supernatural
[1:06:27] birth of Christ to
[1:06:31] pass Hallelujah am so the blood of
[1:06:34] Christ is bringing forth
[1:06:36] children in this hour by the same way so
[1:06:41] there must be an
[1:06:43] atmosphere must be a
[1:06:45] temperature Hallelujah there must be
[1:06:49] amen a high
[1:06:51] temperature in the womb of the bride of
[1:06:54] Christ
[1:06:56] in order to bring forth a supernatural
[1:06:59] birth that's why the word without the
[1:07:03] power God hates a powerless
[1:07:08] church amen and we are to be
[1:07:11] giving amen bir to Children of the
[1:07:15] word is that right and when that word
[1:07:20] hallelujah hu it's given is got to be a
[1:07:24] spirit there
[1:07:26] there's got to be an
[1:07:27] atmosphere there's got to be a
[1:07:30] Vindication to that word that is been
[1:07:34] given that is also taking place in the
[1:07:38] lives of the people we cannot just
[1:07:41] preach your message and pre about how
[1:07:44] God does this and God does
[1:07:46] that and if that word is not coming to
[1:07:50] pass amen that means that the power of
[1:07:55] God
[1:07:56] is not there to Quicken that word to
[1:08:00] bring it to
[1:08:01] pass or the faith that is supposed to be
[1:08:05] in the people is not there to make that
[1:08:09] word come to
[1:08:11] pass you understand we have a
[1:08:16] responsibility as the sons of
[1:08:19] God Christ to bring
[1:08:22] bird to his name and his
[1:08:26] if not they were bringing
[1:08:29] cats and dogs instead of
[1:08:34] sons brother M said you want to see who
[1:08:38] the church is in love with her
[1:08:43] children yes they'll tell you who she's
[1:08:45] in love with and you are part of this
[1:08:48] local
[1:08:50] assembly amen it's not just up to the
[1:08:53] ministry it's up to all of us to create
[1:08:57] an
[1:08:58] atmosphere because if there's no bird
[1:09:01] there there there's got to be an
[1:09:03] atmosphere there not to be a word amen
[1:09:08] that's right huj we are creators of
[1:09:11] atmosphere hallelujah hallelujah and
[1:09:14] brother this word cannot fail but
[1:09:18] there's got to be an
[1:09:20] atmosphere there got to be fi in order
[1:09:23] for that word to come to pass
[1:09:28] Hallelujah to God so the woman is in
[1:09:32] travail she's in praying she's
[1:09:36] praying she's she she's asking God oh
[1:09:40] God touch that boy today touch that
[1:09:44] sister give her a real
[1:09:47] experience how many of us I've been
[1:09:50] praying for your brother praying for
[1:09:53] your sister I have a real experience
[1:09:56] instead of criticizing your brother and
[1:09:59] and and how many times how you got down
[1:10:02] on your knees and travail to say God let
[1:10:08] them receive something that will
[1:10:11] change the way they
[1:10:13] are hallelujah
[1:10:16] hallelujah when that when that
[1:10:19] trail begins to come into the people
[1:10:24] brother Adam said
[1:10:26] I'd rather have one thing in the BR
[1:10:30] Tabernacle if they were to give me to
[1:10:33] choose what do you want William in the
[1:10:37] to amen you want
[1:10:41] shouting yes I want
[1:10:43] sh you want you know joy and dancing and
[1:10:48] singing yes I want that amen am but he
[1:10:52] said the main thing that I would want is
[1:10:57] to have a people amen that have
[1:11:00] burden
[1:11:03] Trail amen for the others to see
[1:11:08] birth that's right A lot of people are
[1:11:12] burdened but for other things I'm not
[1:11:15] talking about that I'm talking about
[1:11:17] being
[1:11:18] burdened
[1:11:22] see he says because if that is there
[1:11:25] the rest will take place dancing will
[1:11:29] take place Joy will take place amen
[1:11:33] because when the woman delivers a child
[1:11:37] she doesn't remember no more of her
[1:11:41] anguish for the joy that a man is Born
[1:11:47] Into the world
[1:11:51] hallah do you
[1:11:54] understand oh my that's why the new
[1:11:59] birth is something
[1:12:02] Supernatural brother B says this we will
[1:12:05] never go back but we will go
[1:12:08] forward when you're born
[1:12:11] again amenu when you're born again you
[1:12:15] never go
[1:12:17] backward you always go
[1:12:20] forward this is the message birth
[1:12:24] pain and he says that's why I think
[1:12:27] today we have so
[1:12:31] many amen or not so many genuine new
[1:12:38] births is because the seed maybe will
[1:12:43] sympathize with the
[1:12:46] word or the person but they don't want
[1:12:49] to run
[1:12:50] away of the old system that they were in
[1:12:54] they don't want come out of it they want
[1:12:57] to stay in the old
[1:12:59] system and claim the new
[1:13:03] birth he says or the message of this
[1:13:08] age we found that under
[1:13:11] Lu W
[1:13:13] pcal and all the other ages they still
[1:13:16] try to hold to the old system but the
[1:13:20] old
[1:13:22] system Must Die
[1:13:25] rocked in order to bring a new
[1:13:29] one but people still want to
[1:13:32] clean with those things they know the
[1:13:35] old system is
[1:13:37] dead they know there's nothing there but
[1:13:40] they still want to
[1:13:44] clean when it really is done away
[1:13:48] with a claim is made that they are born
[1:13:53] again but a claim
[1:13:56] is only a begotten
[1:14:00] sign brings forth New
[1:14:03] Birth you've got to run
[1:14:07] away just as we did in all the
[1:14:11] ages amen through the wesle and all all
[1:14:14] so
[1:14:15] forth but the New Birth when Luther came
[1:14:20] for it was with one word the just shall
[1:14:24] live by faith
[1:14:26] then there come another one and another
[1:14:29] one the old system always has to die in
[1:14:34] order for the new one to come
[1:14:36] on when Wesley's age
[1:14:38] cease and all the little
[1:14:41] ages then
[1:14:43] Pentecost come out restoration of the
[1:14:46] gifts amen amen they had to come out of
[1:14:50] all the Baptist
[1:14:53] Presbyterian Pilgrim holiness
[1:14:57] had to come out of all of
[1:14:58] that right away to accept the new
[1:15:04] birth Hallelujah to
[1:15:07] accept the new birth that's why people
[1:15:10] don't understand that you can't be born
[1:15:13] again outside of the revelation of this
[1:15:17] hour there's no New Birth
[1:15:20] strings there might be confessions
[1:15:23] professions amen members of church but
[1:15:28] there's no new
[1:15:31] births outside of the revelation of this
[1:15:34] hour ain't no New
[1:15:37] Birth
[1:15:40] no hallu you believe that say
[1:15:44] amen
[1:15:46] amen
[1:15:50] hallelujah mes could not have brought no
[1:15:53] message
[1:15:56] neither could Jesus have brought Noah's
[1:15:59] message it was for another
[1:16:02] age it served his
[1:16:04] purpose it was dead and
[1:16:07] gone the transformation from the old to
[1:16:09] the
[1:16:10] new where the life was at what was
[1:16:13] worrying the
[1:16:15] people what worries them
[1:16:19] today we're not building a
[1:16:23] wall like we start off with with
[1:16:25] Luther's
[1:16:26] message if that was the case we would go
[1:16:30] straight down the
[1:16:31] line just building blocks and more
[1:16:33] blocks and blocks cuz it's
[1:16:36] straight keep following the same line
[1:16:39] that Luther was
[1:16:42] going but we're not building a wall
[1:16:46] we're building a
[1:16:48] building and when there's turns of
[1:16:52] Corners amen that's what you have to
[1:16:55] know God's
[1:16:57] blueprint that's his word anybody can
[1:17:01] just keep running a straight
[1:17:04] line but a true it takes a true
[1:17:07] Mason to turn the corner it takes the
[1:17:11] power of
[1:17:13] God in order to do that today it takes
[1:17:18] the power of
[1:17:20] God hallelujah hallelujah amen that's
[1:17:23] why many today
[1:17:25] even the message they take taking a
[1:17:28] certain
[1:17:29] line a certain line and they'll St on
[1:17:33] that
[1:17:36] line amen but it takes the power of God
[1:17:40] to turn
[1:17:42] the Hallelujah hallu it takes an
[1:17:47] anointed
[1:17:49] one from
[1:17:51] Heaven to
[1:17:52] God to bring
[1:17:57] turn and in the prophet's
[1:18:00] age word of the Lord comes to the
[1:18:03] prophets and they turn those
[1:18:07] Corners they made those
[1:18:10] difference but the builders want to
[1:18:12] build a
[1:18:13] wall but this is the building of
[1:18:16] God that the system was rocked in every
[1:18:20] age until she's brought
[1:18:23] forth that church
[1:18:25] out of the
[1:18:26] rockness come forth the word the word of
[1:18:30] the Lord comes forth and finally the
[1:18:34] word was born in human flesh the

[1:18:40] B rested in him he was the word the
[1:18:46] prophets is part of the word the word
[1:18:49] for their age
[1:18:51] amen but we notice he was the entire
[1:18:57] fullness of the word he when they was
[1:19:01] accusing
[1:19:02] him of making himself equal to
[1:19:07] God Amen am and brother and sister souls
[1:19:11] in prison

[1:19:21] them and they are the
[1:19:23] word to the people they are written
[1:19:27] epist of all men hallelujah hallelujah
[1:19:31] God again fulfilling in human
[1:19:34] flesh the scriptures for the age and he
[1:19:37] said could this be the third
[1:19:41] po yes in birth pains he says every
[1:19:45] believer that accepts God's word into
[1:19:49] their heart I don't care what system you
