Description:
1 Corinthians 13:9-11

9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.

10 But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.

11 When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.


First Corinthians 13 says this: "When that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away with." So all these little things of jumping up-and-down like a kid, trying to talk in tongues, and all these other things, when that which is perfect… And we do have today, by God's help, the perfect interpretation of the Word with Divine vindication. Then that which is in part is done away with. "When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child; but when I become a man, I put away childish things." Amen. I go to preaching and then don't get to these things.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
back in service again these Sunday evenings and we want to open our Bibles uh in the book of First Corinthians chapter 13 amen we'll read again from the ninth verse amen amen [Applause] [Music] First Corinthians 13 amen verse 9 you have it say amen amen for we know in part in part and we in prophesy part amen amen but when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away amen amen are we to prophesy in this hour hallelujah amen amen because remember Paul is saying in his age we prophesied in part but in this age Mighty Angel come down to say prophesy again amen amen so we are to prophesy but not in part amen because that which is perfect is come and that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I speak as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things now we see through glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known and now body of faith hope charity these three things but greatest of these is charity now uh the very next chapter First Corinth 14 we're going to read verse 20 Brethren be not children in understanding how be it in Malice be children but in understanding Amen Let Us bow our heads father we thank you again Lord for the reading of your holy word father we ask Lord that you would bless it tonight father Lord Quicken it to our hearts oh God bless your people father with the word give Lord that which is needed for each heart and each life according to the measure of Faith Lord according to the need according father as your riches in glory to give unto that which we have need of Lord fill our desire Lord for we know if our heart condemn us not then we can ask with confidence oh god father for the blood of Jesus Christ that cleanses us of all sin and we can have Fellowship around your word tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen may be seated hallelujah hallelujah as we were speaking this morning this is the age of adoption brother called it the dispensation of adoption he said there has been many dispensations the dispensation of the law dispensation of many different uh things he said this is a dispensation of adoption this is the season this is the time in which Paul is speaking of that we are to put away childish things amen amen this is what we want to uh take our text from today this evening amen amen from verse 11 of 1 Corinthians 13 amen put away childish things amen amen put away childish things amen amen or putting away amen because we're bringing it to the present T amen for us putting away away childish things now how many believe that this is that time according to brother Bram Amen in every age God dealt a portion is that right we were seeing that this morning and then when it come to this last day he gives a completeness just like he gave a portion in the prophets then when Jesus come it was the fullness he was the bridegroom then he said Through the Ages give portions but when this last day bright comes he is to give the fullness like he did in the brid to have the preeminence and the people in this last day to be anointed be filled with the fullness of God how many know that that's in the scripture Paul spoke of that of being filled with the fullness of God now in when we look at the stages of the church we have to realize something this is what I was trying to get at this morning morning but I I want to make it a little more clear tonight that when we look at the age that we're living in we have to understand the holy spirit for this hour is perfection amen the Holy Spirit giving given in this hour is not as it was given in the days of Luther the days of Wesley even in the Revival the Holy Spirit given today is to bring us to Perfection it's the spirit of Truth to lead us to all righteousness amen and that's the anointing of our hour that's the Holy Ghost given in our hour it's not a portion brother mam said it's not a gift of the Holy Ghost it's the Holy Ghost himself the person of Jesus Christ it's the token being King in this house believe now notice when we look then we we have to understand this brothers and sisters and that is that in this age is adoption time so as the as an age as a people as a body and even as individuals amen this is what we come to in this hour I I want to make it plain because we have to understand that in the days of Luther they only could get to justification they could only get to sanctification in the days of Wesley and that was all they could reach amen and the people that received the word in their day and see that life of the word that's what they would produce but this message produces adopted sons of God it produces the knowledge of the fullness of Christ in other words this message amen is what was needed for adopted son amen without the revelation of this message you cannot have an adopted son remember this morning we were speaking about how how that we can come to Perfection was only by a perfect message and the perfect interpretation but I want us to understand a little more in this because sometimes we look at it as though it's it's us as individuals wanting to get to the stature of a perfect man and in part that is true but it's not because as an aid is the anointing of the hour hallelujah hallelujah brother and sister we must come to the Holy Ghost in This Hour you get to the Holy Ghost in This that he comes into your soul that quickens you in this hour that is the Seal of the age brother R said that is the life given today so the Holy Ghost when it was when it was given into the hearts of the people in different ages it fulfilled the message for that hour Hallelujah amen that's why Paul says turn me to Romans 8 amen amen Romans 8 verse 14 for as many as L by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again the fear but ye have received the spirit s of adoption whereby we cry AB the father amen amen now notice something brother and sisters the spirit of adoption is the Holy Ghost yes there's nothing less we have not received a spirit of bondage again to fear amen amen we we have receive the spirit of adoption we go to the book of Galatians go to Galatians and we come to chapter 4 amen amen I mean Ephesians Gans gter 4 in verse one it says now I say that the heir as long as he is a child different nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but his under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father even so we we were children we're in bondage under the elements of the world now listen but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son Jesus Christ amen made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons now listen close speaks of this in the exposition Church ages that only the seat of God only elected of God only the predestinated of God that have a SE Gene in their soul can receive the Holy Ghost no one else amen hallelujah no one else can receive because he are Sons God have sent forth the Holy Spirit of his son into your hearts Hallelujah see into your hearts amen not on your flesh not in your spirit amen in your heart crying have a father see you are already a son when you were born in this Earth You Were A Son of God you had eternal life you didn't receive eternal life when you received the message when you came to the altar when you raised your hand you already had eternal life you were already a son Hallelujah but because you're a son he has to send Spirit into your heart notice what he says the spirit of his son the spirit of his son Glory brother that was the spirit that was in Christ that was the spirit that was obedient to the father that was the spirit that was can did nothing except he see the father do it hallelujah hallelujah that was the spirit John 59 amen hallelujah that was the spirit amen amen that was in Jesus Christ and that was obedient amen amen it was so obedient for that three years and a half amen it's all he took for God to adopt him Hallelujah and have a ceremony because that was the spirit of adoption and The Same Spirit of adoption was living inside of Jesus Christ he sends the spirit of his son amen into your hearts crying AB the father Hallelujah wherefore thou no more a servant but a son if a son than an heir of God through Christ is that right what does Ephesians 1 say having predestinated us amen unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will are we [Applause] predestinated amen remember last time I said if you're predestinated you have a destination predestinate right amen amen amen amen you're destined dination has already been pre-planned Hallelujah am glory to God in the mind of God the works you didn't display we spoke about the other day remember they were already finished before the foundation of the world Paul speaks of that also in Ephesians 2 amen amen listen to this Ephesians 2 verse 10 for we are his workmanship amen created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God have before ordained that we should walk in them amen these wordss are for ordained that we should walk in them Hallelujah predestinated to the adoption of sons brother and sister but we can talk about predestination all day long we can talk about it for years but unless the Holy Ghost comes into your heart quickens what's on the inside there's the evidence of predestination is not you believing in the doctrine of predestination the evidence of predestination is you receiving the spirit of his son in your heart because ye were son he sent the spirit of his son into your heart cry father it's the spirit of adoption Hallelujah the spirit of adoption not the spirit of bondage against Fe amen amen is that right but we receive says Romans 8:15 we receive 15 we receive the spirit of adoption where by we cry Father which means our God my God amen amen amen my father amen is that right so he has begotten us to be created into the very image of Christ amen let's go to Second Timothy 17 just real quick I didn't plan on doing this but had other plans Romans 8:15 then we we read that it says we have not been given the spirit of fear of bondage to fear and second Timothy 17 for God have not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of sound mind brother the spirit of bondage was in Egypt amen is that right when they were in Egypt of bondage was upon them and that Spirit of bondage held them in fear for 400 years but when they came out of bondage listen Into the Wilderness they still had the same spirit amen they still had fear they still had the spirit of bondage and they feared that they were going to die of thirst and they feared that they were going to die of hunger and they feared and they complained and they mured amen amen they still had the spirit of bage that came out of Egypt but Egypt never came out of Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah but brother and sister there was some elected predestinated seed that was walking alongside of Moses Hallelujah am Oh Glory to God and out of that generation one out of a million went into the promised land to receive the spirit of adoption to be placed Hallelujah Hallelujah by Joshua the holy spirit amen hallelujah when the Bible says in numbers 13 that when the spies brought back an evil report people feared people melted amen hallelujah the people fear of the Giants of the land amen the spirit of fear was still upon them the spirit of bondage was still upon them they were following a prophet yet they were under the Cloud yet they were following the pillar of fire yet they were eating Heavenly Mana oh know they were baptized in the Red Sea Paul said these things were written for our example amen amen but they had the spirit of bondage and they again feared amen amen but the spirit of adoption said we are more than able the spirit of adoption said the promise is given unto us amen and we shall take the promise amen hallelujah hallelujah it shows today that [Applause] theal yet under the spirit of bondage bondage AMU that's why Paul is telling Timothy you have not received amen Spirit fear of power [Applause] that word there power hallelujah hallelujah is dunam which means Dynamics Hallelujah not just mechanics dyamics Hallelujah [Applause] Dynamite that's what that word means we have not been given the spirit of fear but of power and of Love see is that adoption brother say perfect love he say that there is a great ocean of love agap did he say it amen why did he preach Ephesians after he came back from Beyond the C of time why did he preach adoption after coming back on the other side hallelujah it's tight amen he said right now we have a shadow of the Shadow of the shadow of but he said then that shadow gets less hallelujah hallelujah and then from the shadow he said it becomes a little a little sprinkle Hallelujah then it comes out greater he says and next to you know it's a great ocean nothing nothing but perfect love we'll be on the other side is that right Amen brother Bram said the message Christ revealed in his own words he said it ain't love Satan can personate everything God is God that's right you know what he said he said you can have love and even love God what he say and still be lost God you can still be lost amen amen so you can love God you can love the prophet you can love your brother you can love anybody it's going to be lost amen amenu ain't nobody greater than God so if you can love God it's still be lost where's everybody else fall amen but listen brother this is why we must receive a spirit of adoption into our hearts you understand this is where gives us the spirit of power gives us a spirit of love and of a sound mind how many know that brother said I predict that the whole world will go into Total Insanity amen Hallelujah got to be blind not to see that it's completely insane now amen amen or you think all that's normal that's people think it's Insanity brother said if the woman that was in the 60s if the women would have come out dressed the way they do now back in those days they would have thrown in an insan out amen she forgot to put on her clothes something's wrong with your mind he says now there's not enough s ones Amen to put the insane ones the insan amen amen so listen brother the sound M Hallelujah brother said amen they told Paul the same thing what did they tell Paul what did a gria tell Paul so much reading that's turn you crazy Amen brother man said said people claim that when you receive Christ you become crazy you're already czy God Resto you to your sound mind to be able to think right comprehend right amen hallelujah able to use the brain the way God intended it for to be used Hallelujah yes sir to be led by the word of God that right you say oh brother then what I feel in my heart Jeremiah says the heart is dece amen amen so it's not even what you feel in your heart because what you feel in your heart can be contrary to the word it's got to be the [Applause] word hallelujah amen so you know many times I feel it my heart remember you need to get that out of your [Applause] heart amen amen you see even though okay that's God's perfect amen amen amen it's in the third round but we always have to check it by the word not just because you feel it in your heart that means it's right [Applause] word now notice this is the thing that God has given us this mind this Spirit now remember Jesus said you do ear not knowing the power of God and the scriptures amen amen they were talking about how many wives this was going to have how many wives is that one going to have amen amen Jesus said you not knowing the power of God and the scriptures God is not a god of the Dead god of the living now notice Hallelujah Paul says in First Corinthians 2 First Corinthians 2 there's a little scripture here amen amen amen amen hallelujah verse 13 which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receive not the things of the spirit of God they foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judges all things yet he himself is judg of no man for who have known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him we have the mind of Christ amen hallelujah is that right notice here this is a spirit of adoption the spirit of adoption amen it's the mind of Christ it's the fullness it's the intelligence amen amen that's the greatest thing that God could ever give Amen to his children is to give them his own mind his own spirit because the mind of man is the spirit of man hallelujah hallelujah it's not these it's these brains up here that you got in your sko amen it's your spirit that's your mind hallelujah hallelujah and if we receive the spirit of Christ receive the mind of Christ and we let the mind that was in Christ in you Hallelujah where he bed not robbery to be equal with God hallelujah hallelujah but he made himself a form of a servant and he come down to be obedient to the father obedient to the word obedient to the command of God hallelujah hallelujah that's the reason why brother many people Ain getting to maturity to maturity why because they fail to recognize God has something promised amen that promise is his word for you for your life for the bride for the body in this last day and unless we obey that didn't brother say how can you receive the token people don't know brother that the token is connected with adoption because brother amen he said in order to get the token we know what the token is right it's the life of the blood right it's Holy Spirit right that's the Holy Ghost for this age see people are still trying to have a Pentecostal idea amen amen no sir the Holy Ghost in This Hour Amen to be given to a bride because in Pentecost the baptism of the Holy Ghost wasn't in the song amen amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah people understand that that's why brother say and then people take those quotes and they don't know what to do with them because they got a car mind when they read you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every day of your life and still be lost they go to hell amen what's he talking about he not talking about the baptism in the soul it's not talking about the spirit of adoption that's not what he's talking about he's talking about the Holy Ghost calling on you on your flesh into your spirit never coming into your soul hallelujah hallelujah and only the Bri rece it in the soul Hallelujah that's the evidence that you are there's no greater evidence hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah said only those with the Holy Ghost will go in the Hallelujah Hallelujah the others that will go in the rapture they had the Holy Ghost for their day and they were sealed until the day of redemption hallelujah hallelujah that's what we got to understand that as an age as a people as a body this is the age of adoption the spirit of adoption is here to fill your soul not the spirit of justification is here to fill your soul oh Spirit of adop because you are Sons you send the spirit of his son into your hearts to cry the father you understand now notice Paul is saying amen we are to put away child things is that right because the childish things amen is showing immaturity it's showing that the true revelation of his will has not been revealed yet to our hearts we can claim all we want brother but the proof is in that seed of God in what stage it is if it's been broken yet or is it still sealed as the holy ghost coming into the soul to Quicken the seed and raise it up you see what I'm saying or is is not saying that you're not a son of God just saying that the seed is down in there and it hasn't been quickened yet amen hallelujah when the seed is quickened it brings to life amen bring the Fulfillment of the word this age full stat of Christ now watch what brother Ram says he says Paul is addressing in Ephesians 1 directly straight to the shoulder to the church that's what we're doing tonight see little babies I got a little one back there that just learned how to walk he he bumped fall down and he thought he was doing something great I was that way one day but now I'm a man and I put away childish things we got to come to full doctr amen I like good old shouting meeting where we can clap our hands and shout and have a good time have a powerful service and things and dance on the bubble amen as it were but wait when The Showdown time comes you don't know where you're standing let's get back and find out what's making us do that let's get back to the foundation amen you believe that am what good would it do brother to have the Holy Ghost to make you do all those things and then you can't face the challenge that the devil is trying to put in your way so you so you won't come to the promise that God is predestined don't you understand that that has to be with every Son of God amen amen that's why David had to encounter goath to come to his position remember that that's why Jesus had to face his Giants the Pharisees of his day amen in order to be tested he had to face the Devil Himself and then he come out Transfiguration is that right that's why the prophet of God in this day had to face the giant of unbelief Amen in the Supernatural power of his ministry hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and this is why today you as a son and daughter of God has to face your giant has to face your issues you can't get away from it sometimes we try to put it under the rug sometimes we try to make like it ain't there and you know it's there Hallelujah yes sir I'm trying to act like it ain't there it's there help us hallelujah amen hallelujah when it was there the prophet you could tell when it was there is that right when he finally overcame that Hallelujah then God was able to lift him up he didn't have to wait till 63 in the 50s he was speaking speaking squirrels into existence why because they had already passed that trial in his lifeu you understand amen now notice brother the message what here is thou Elijah talking about Elijah being tired weary being depressed amen running from Jezebel he was tired and weary but God cared for his Prophet I think of that lovely kindness that God showed Elijah when he took him out under the tree went out on his of his own province into another province Hallelujah and there he left his servant then run out into the jungle way out into the Wilderness to a appointed place it was a juniper tree that was in the ground for that very purpose God laid him down under the tree the juniper tree and put him to sleep so he could rest a little while then he knew he was hungry woke him up the angel touched him B some cakes laying on the Coes and he ate the cak and went back to sleep again must have been really tired the Revival the Miracles and that he had performed the supernatural was upon him he was wore out and the angel that let him sleep a while woke up again and ate some more that the journey is very hard how that we need in this journey that we are in we find a place of rest to Feast on the word of God so it'll give us strength Amen brother and sister when you are in that condition the devil wants you to get away from the world he wants you to get away from fellowship he wants you to get away from church he wants you to miss a month of services that's what he wants you to do but you have to understand that is a Time amen amen to rest in his presence to rest in the word to take inventory of your life amen am I called of God how did God call me amen why am I here I have a purpose brother if these things don't make us do that then it's failing to wake us up to the realization amen amen there's got to come something I I've been hearing a lot of messages on Joseph and the Lord willing we're going to speak on that but brother shows us amen that once the father gave Joseph the coat of many colors amen the spiritual dreams and the visions and the different things began to come then the persecution began to come because of the Revelation brother said that brother said notice it was at that time that Joseph did not understand but God had a plan he worked it all out for good what seemed like a hard trial for Joseph's life put him in prison put him in slavery put him through the hard trial hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God oh Hallelujah little did he know that that was going to be to ascend him to a great position little did he know that he would sit at the right hand of pharaoh did he know that he was going to have his name changed Hallelujah did he know that he was going to wear a ring on his finger little did he know that he was going to ride the Chariot with the King Hallelujah hu we don't look at that all we look at as the prison all we look at as the condition all we look at is what we're in you got to understand if you are a son of God that has to be there if not then we'll just be lost and go to hell anyway so what does it matter amen you understand what I'm saying sometimes we we got to we got to make ourselves those questions because then if not amen as children we want to complain under the spirit of bondage the spirit of fear why and why and why and why you see amen hallelujah hallelujah we should realize and recognize no notice what brother says says we need this amen amen we need night after night to go into the room and rest and come back the next morning and eat more for this great journey a great battle that's ahead for the church I believe that we've been children long enough God's going to turn his church into manhood now we've played and Frolic as children but now we're going to have to put away childish things and take manhood amen maturity amen I believe it was Paul who said I was a child I speak as a child because he thought as a child but it's time that we begin to think like men women we've got to get down to business we must be about the father's business amen amen not your own business the father father's business Hallelujah are we about the father's [Music] business now notice questions and answerers 61 brother Bram goes on to say I'm sorry uh those questions in that church order Church order 63 says now notice the scripture when we was a child Paul said I acted as a child he told the Corinthians there I spoke like a child he had a child mind when I become an adult I put away childish things now telling you all a few years ago you were children with these gifts playing back and forth but you've been too long in school now wow it's time to be men Lord not use these just to play with these gifts they're sacred they're of God amen you don't play with them hallu let's let God use them that's what your ministry wants to be that's the way to put the brand Tabernacle in serviceu and if this is questioned anytime let this table stand as a witness that's the way is to be done in the amen Amen brother and sister that's that's exactly what Paul was speaking of in First Corinthians 13 and in First Corinthians 14 amen hallelujah we read verse 20 and it's right in the middle of him talking to them about the gifts Brethren be not children and understand how be it in be children but in understanding be men amen amen questions and answers in 64 he says First Corinthians 13 says when that which is perfect has come that which is in part shall be done away with so all these little things listen to the prophet so all these little things of jumping up and down like a kid trying trying to talk in tongues and all these other things when that which is perfect and we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word divine vindication am then that which is in part is done away with when I was a child I speak as a child I understood as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things amen amen I go to preaching and then I don't get to these other things amen I know this is what Paul is speaking of not only in the gift realm but in the gifts of every calling amen how many know that you as a Son of God you have a calling amen amen amen are you called to be the bride of Christ in this hour Hallelujah are you called to be without spotle are you called to be a perfect spotless pride of Jesus Christ a perfect bride with Victory amen overcoming every circumstance that knows what the anointing of God is for what of the anointing of God is for Amen to take Supreme control is to have perfect Faith amenu to be master of all circumstances brother Adam said then you're getting into bride material if you ain't even getting to that you ain't even Bri material yet according to the prophets amen people don't like this because they think we're talking about not jumping not shouting that just shows you don't understand that just shows that don't understand that it shows that you can't instruct a child and you're trying to instruct the child he don't understand you see what I'm saying when you instruct someone that's of age he understands that there's a purpose behind the instruction Hallelujah he understands that there's a purpose for the kingdom of God there's a purpose to fulfill the word it ain't about what I feeling how I feeling how I think there's a purpose it's for the kingdom this is what we got to understand we got to we got to man up and be men and be women shs of God recognize that the time is at hand amen hallelujah what good will it do us say oh God I'm ready Hallelujah I'm ready to go praise God and the first little test comes amen and we ble down we don't have what it takes to overcome the devil amen hallelujah but the weapons of our war [Applause] not the same demons come back again and attack us again and we still buckle down let it brother why we haven't been able to move forward why because unless you overcome that giant [Applause] that it that's the reason why many times bring the same trial again Tri again the same Tri again Hallelujah say why why why you know why right Hallelujah he that I love I and re and if you can't take the test a bastard child me Lord hallelujah hallelujah and the word of God has a purpose in which it is here to do but all we do brother is think about what we got to do how we feel what is it this about brother and sister we got to enter into the mind of Christ said all this people that believe the Full Gospel will come in this meeting under one mind under one objective under one Accord amen he said the great power of God would come upon the church and do greater things than what he did in the apostles he said that the message the angel of God Amen that's the reason why everybody's in their own idea everybody's in their own thoughts everybody's in their own feelings everybody's in their own Revelation but if your own Revelation a in line with the word a false [Applause] Revelation am hallelujah hallelujah because it's not working for the purpose of the edification of the body of Christ amen it's only working for now notice when we look that there's got to come a time to put away childish things amen then we don't have to keep learning ever learning and never coming to the knowledge amen second Timothy 3 amen we read it this morning verse seven ever learning never able to come to the knowledge of the truth amen amen this is the reason why that in this age God has showed us the knowledge of the truth and it has come to be revealed in the last days is that right is that the time that we're living and we know brother that all these signs are showing us how close the resurrection is how close the body chain is how close receiving the promised son how close we'll ride this Trail again yes amen hallelujah how close are we going to ride this Trail again [Music] see but yet brother we see it close you see it close and brother Bram said the only thing I got it right here oh we're waiting for this brother we're waiting for that we're waiting for something else we're waiting for something else waiting for this 65 August 15 65 no if it not 50 years ago this is 2015 August right oh my says that's the kind of a picture of the church today see I've got the the church age coming forth now in the books and that being the Le Church age look at the conditions I don't want to take any text or anything but look just talking casually we see to talk on whatever the Lord would lead us to do but something that would help us let's think of this age today as far as I know I don't see anything to hinder at this time the coming of the Lord outside of the Readiness of his church amen hallelujah amen amen outside of the Readiness of his church that's the only thing you say oh brother we're going to ride this Trail again yes do you know what he said you know what he said Just remember from the West will come a white horse rider we'll ride this Trail again that's right as soon as we're ready Hallelujah am amen amen the Readiness of the church the Readiness of the church you understand the thing is notice what the Prophet says here in the message the flashy red light of his coming our lord Jesus was asked this question he gave him the sign of his coming and immediately he said heavens and earth pass away but my words shall not pass away then he said learn a parable the F tree putting forth his branches you know that summer is nine so when you see these things come to pass or made manifest know that the time is at hand that this generation shall not be done away until all these things shall come to pass he says what generation the generation that's seeing the apostasy huah hallelujah amen so we think of my text red flashing light of his coming it reminds me of waiting at the railroad
