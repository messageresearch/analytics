TRANSCRIPT
========================================
as we were looking at uh last Wednesday upon this subject we laid the foundation amen and those of you who were not here I don't know if our brother recorded it or not but anyway uh we laid the foundation for what we are speaking on the supernatural birth is something that you cannot receive unless you were in the mind of God as an attribute of him to be expressed in the hour which we are living and brother Adam said amen then it brings to us amen a supernatural birth amenu he said in the message lead not to your own understanding 1965 he says I got to try to explain how Paul speaking here he says who we in times P at one time we were dead in sins and trespasses who have God has quickened us God has made us alive and now seeing before anything before anything can be quickened amen amen before anything can be quickened there's got to be something there to be quickened by amen if you were in the for knowledge of God then you are becoming a part of God the only way you can be a Son of God or a daughter of God you have to be a part of God and God isn't complete without you Hallelujah that's right there is only one source of eternal life and that is God and him alone see so you were in his thinking in the beginning because he thought of you in the beginning it gives that little tug towards him when we're here on the Earth that's what it has to be quickened some of them will never be quickened they just don't have it that's all it's just like if you would put a grain of corn in the ground no ever how pretty it is if it's hybrid if it didn't have the germ of life in it it could never be quickened because the germ of life has to be there first and in order for that ger to come into a resurrection because that's what the power of quickening is the word quickening means to be brought back to life after being dead amen amen and what the seed that has the germ of life in it unless it falls in the ground and dies and rocks they cannot come into a resurrection that's exactly what Jesus was saying and this is what we spoke on last Wednesday amen just want to get you back into the channel that we were in on Wednesday so we can get into the furtherment of this and advance in this subject if you were here here and you remember amen the Bible said the spirit of Truth was going to show us things to come and he would bring to our REM what the word say now in the message M of Gilead brother man speaks of the new birth he said what it is is dying to our thoughts Dy to are thinking to receive the mind of Christ and when you approach him you cannot think your thoughts amen that's why many people when they want to receive something from God they fail to receive it because they were approaching God in the way they think it should be but that's not the way we are to approach God we are to surrender what we think what we want how we think and we must come to his presence full surrenderance only with the words only with his thoughts only with his ideas of that are in the word of how he wants me to receive from him amen and brother said that's why a lot of people don't receive nothing because they're not willing to die and rock to that kind of things they said well if I go I want him to do this I'm not going to act this way or I'll just you know scream when he touches me or I'll speak in tongues or someone else might say I won't do nothing I'll just receive it and be calm any of those things is your mind any of those things is what you think what you want and how you think you're already coming with your premeditated ideas of how you want to receive hallelujah hallelujah but brother M say you must get that out of your mind you must think his thoughts let the mind that was in Christ in you and he thinks God's thoughts brings God's blessing it brings God's power it'll make a mess out of you as far as the world is concerned but it'll bring life it bring resurrecting life it will bring new thoughts it will bring a new person it will bring a new faith it will bring you from death un to life hallelujah hallelujah the new birth doesn't matter how messy it is amen amen but you have to be willing to lay your pride down amen and then come to him but you'll come out from there a different person born of the spirit of God a new creature in Christ Jesus it'll do something to you no matter how meesy it looks you might fall and S and Carry On In The Altar whatever you have to do all the unnecessary things that you think you wouldn't do it will make you do it well that's not necessary well it's necessary that you surrender amen and whatever happens after that it was necessary hallu because it is necessary that you be born again it is necessary that you die out it is necessary that we rock to our mind and let his mind come living us hallelujah that's necessary to God so we we realize that we as the predestinated word how many remember that have to meet with the written word for the hour you are the predestinated word and the message is the written word for the hour amen when you meet that word when you meet this Living Word this message amen Ain alive this day for this hour the scriptures pertaining for this day those are the ones that Quicken what's in you we cannot be quickened by Luther's message we cannot go to a Lutheran Church and sit in the congregation and hear the pastor Lutheran preach a Lutheran message and be Quicken it cannot happen and if someone it's quickened by Lutheran message that's where they belong Hallelujah but not an of God for this hour amen that kind of Tommy Rock doesn't satisfy amen because it's rotten already glory to God amen that message is gone by amen there's something that the soul that is predestinated to receive the word of this house there there's a hunger in there to hear this message amen and when you hear it you know that that's what you want because God predestinated you for the foundation of the world that he knew you would come to a certain spot we read the the quotes in the message things that are to be amen what brother Adam said we we spoke this last Wednesday he said the day you were going to be born again God knew that before the foundation of the world that was an original thought in the mind of God so when the time comes for you to receive amen that quicking power in your soul that is that thought from eternity taking place in manifestation inside of you God knew that that's why we read right now in in lean not on your own understanding that unless you were a thought of God Amen in the mind of God to be born again you can't be quicked what he said when you're here on the earth and you are a thought then you feel a little Tong towards him Hallelujah and he said that little tug is what has to be quick so brother and sister you got to be drawn Amen to that word that's why Jesus said amen all that the father has given me will come to me hallelujah hallelujah there's a drawing and he said no one come come to me except my father draws so there has to be a there's got to be something drawing you pulling you hallelujah hallelujah so notice this when you come to that word that is the quickening power because the life is in the word is that right the life is in the word amen and that's the holy spirit for our day that's why brother R said the word that come on the day of Pentecost does not work for us today hu amen invisible 1965 the word that came on the day of Pentecost does not work for us today that's where he said it Union notice he never said the anointing he never said the quicking power he never said the spirit he said the word am that come on the day of Pentecost doesn't work for us today brother and sister this is what I just said you can only be quickened by the word of this hour huj amen because there is a many preaching what was given on the day of Pentecost and that ain't the message for this hour amen amen go to an Apostolic Church they'll tell you what Peter preached on the day of Pentecost but that message ain't quick in me brother hallelujah hallelujah is that right to God go to UPC Church amen they'll tell you what happened on day of Pentecost and what that word is and they're still on the same word but brother said amen that Malachi 4 glory to God was to restore back to the faith of the Father the original Faith the life amen in her will be the fullness of Pentecost is fullness time this is not portion Hallelujah this is the fullness of the manifestation of the word of God all amen that the prophets has spoke of all amen that the scriptures were announcing hallelujah hallelujah that Jesus was reflecting in the Fulfillment as the full of the word of God hallelujah that is the fullness of the manifestation of God's word in manifestation amen he was going to in this day make a formation of his bride amen amen be in the same image to be in the same Unity to be in the same connection to be in the same reflection of that mystery because Jesus was revealing the father amen Jesus was revealing the father and the bride is revealing Christ huj you understand that's why brother preached Christ is the mystery of God revealed amen and that was hidden until this day it was going to break to bring amen a new birth you say what does that have to do you're talking about the new birth brother Diego and now you're talking about the mystery that was hidden in God what does that have to do with the new birth that's what people today don't understand because in the message Christ is the mystery God revealed he said that mystery personally revealed to you is the new birth Hallelujah what's the new birth what's a supernatural birth that mystery personally revealed to youu how many has read that how many has heard brother say that Christ is a Myst revealed amen so brother and sister that's the reason why that has to come by the revelation of this hour to bring you a new birth and that mystery wasn't known until the seventh seal was broken that was the secret that Jesus mentioned in Matthew 24 where he said no one knows he omitted the Seven Seals when he was preaching did Jesus preach Seven Seals where your Prophet said in Matthew 24 amen that's where Jesus preaches seven SE and when he come to the seventh seal he omitted he said I don't know nothing about it amen not even the angels in heaven only my father has kept this to himself Hallelujah hu glory to God when brother preaches Christ is a mystery he says this was the secret that Jesus couldn't speak of when they asked him about that and he said only the father knew not even the angels in heaven Hallelujah hallu but he said this mystery GL to God he connected with the seven seal and he said it's the same mystery amen John was forbidden to write glory to God Amen he didn't make it known glory to God but in the days of the seventh Angels message when he shall begin to sound the mystery what mystery it doesn't say Mysteries read the Bible it says the mystery the mystery of God would be finished that mystery that was hidden secret would be made known hallelujah hallelujah at the sounding of the seven th and this is what brings a new birth into the soul of the predestinated seed Peter said born of The Incorruptible seed hallelujah hallelujah and the Original Seed was Incorruptible but when but when Satan amen injected himself injected into the human race amen amen if Adam sin come into the World by woman oh scripture doesn't say that it come in by man because Adam amen knowing amen he gave himself he participated amen amen Romans 8 he brought all nature into bondage yes is that right he brought all Humanity into slavery of sin amen because he was in control it was up to him what was to be done but he forfeited amen eternal life upon the Earth amen amen and when that took place then that race of Incorruptible SE fell into corruptable because now the sons were born corrupt Hallelujah but from the beginning they were going to be born from Incorruptible how many remember last Wednesday we spoke about Adam amen he come to the full manifestation of the thought of God is that right correct amen God didn't bring Adam through a process justification ification baptism of the Holy Ghost and then bring him to Perfection oh no Adam didn't go to no process he come from the beginning by the spoken word of God born by the spirit Luke 1 says he was the son of God Amen Lord of Incorruptible SE brought to the Earth in full manifestation of the etal God but he fell from amen and now all his children amen the Bible says if you read the generations of Adam in Genesis chter 5 he says he began to uh be he beg got children amen amen and he beg got Seth In His Image and his likeness amen hallelujah and what image did he have fallen image at one time at one time according to Genesis 126 he said the God said let us make man in in our image in our likeness and they made it Incorruptible but after the fall Adam had children by sex because of the Fall amen and the Bible says that they he had children and said was his was in his likeness and His image amen that's why no one can be born of The Incorruptible seed by the natural birth Hallelujah not just because they were sons of Adam oh we're sons of God we've been born by Incorruptible seed amen amen by natural image they were sons of God that's right right but not by Spirit how many understand because the Bible says in the very next chapter Genesis 6 there was much sin corruption violence right God's heart amen was sadden he repented of making man and then he said that the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were fair and took unto them wiv and then they mixed and mingled the seeds amen amen that's the very reason why God brought the flood is that right Hallelujah cuz they mix the natural seed you see those that when the Bible speaks of the sons of God saw that the daughters of men brother tells you the daughters of men were those from the seeds of Cain and the sons of God were from the natural lineage of of Adam ofel is that right but those same sons of godish in the yes amen those same sons of God were in hell when Jesus went down there to preach to them that they had not repented in the days of Noah you say the sons of God went to hell natural flesh no true Son of God the Eternal thought of God predestinated of God will ever be in hell that's right there's no scripture for that there's no quote and there's no message it's not scriptural for a predestinated son to be in Hell how come those were sons of God and they went to hell they were sons of God by flesh because that that seed was now corruptible amen it was not Incorruptible no more it's the same way today just because your father is filled of the Holy Spirit does it mean that his children are born of of Incorruptible seed just because somebody was born in this message doesn't make them Son of God they've got to be born of Incorruptible they've got to be born again because that birth that they're born with is under bondage of sin and corruption that's what Jesus when he come he come by the spoken word he come by Supernatural birth hallelujah hallelujah and his first Doctrine was you must be born again hallelujah hallelujah of the water and of the spirit of the word and of the quickening power amen that's why each age was s an anointing to come back the Antichrist spirit and that anointing is what Picken the word for the hour which they were living the the the the anointing of the spirit of God that was sent in the days of Luther was the face of a man and it quickened the scripture in Romans the just shall live by faith what was that that was the Holy Spirit for that Hour Quick the word for that hour to the predestinated seat amen and they were sealed until the day of their Redemption because they were under that quickening power of the word having received all of the light for their age in the first seal brother Adam says they were sealed until the day of their Redemption and in the resurrection they will rise hallelujah hallelujah because they were part of the word amen before the foundation of the world they were a thought to fulfill the word in the age in which they live in but our anointing is different our anointing make the face of a man our anointing Hallelujah is the E power it's a prophetic anointing that quickens not only one word not only one scripture not only five scriptures it opens the whole Bible so open to the believer in this hour you see how it's a different anointing you see how this Birth has to do with the mystery that was in the might of God the foundation of the worldj because even Paul amen spoke of a day that Perfection was going to come Hallelujah Paul said when that day comes we shall see face to face glory to godu amen and you see in this fulfillment of the word of God there is a birth that has to take place amen and that's Supernatural Supernatural Oh Glory to godah notice in the message the word the world is again falling apart he says God only promised to to anoint his word amen amen I know that is scorchy but that's what it that's what's the truth God never changes he anoints his word yes sir the anointed promise word for that age is what God anoints did you hear that the anointed promised word for that age is what God ano word for the the message why little be says oh God anoint us with th word and bring Thy word promise to this day bring it to pass Amen in the message testimony he says I tell you this morning I bring you record have you ever seen the gift of God fail one time no read about it this morning no sir it's Jesus Christ it can't fail science has proved it the church knows it and he is here right now right at this minute he is here and the only thing it lacks is for your faith to pick up that word and anoint it to yourself amen that's the thing brother that's why people can't can't be quickened by the word because they don't have faith in what's being being preached they don't believe that what's being preached is God they don't believe the pillar of fire the holy spirit is right here right now they don't believe that there's a living voice of the blood that is speaking better things in the voice of they don't believe that there's a final voice to the final hallelujah hallelujah but when you can one see amen that is the word for this hour for this moment for this time that we're in then you can apply Faith Amen to that word anointed to yourself and he will bring it to Hallelujah Hallelujah he will heal you he will F you he will give you what you have need of but you got to believe truly the word of God hallelujah hallelujah am that's why Jesus do many mighty works because of unbelief Brother people don't realize that our faith towards the word can change the atmosphere can change the course of the service and change the preacher preaching amen yeah but also our unbelief our resist IST our funny feelings our little idea can also hinder the word from FL yes Amen to God Amen in the message expectations he says you're the sons and and Daughters of God a lot of times you're looking for something great to come but you already got it the greatest can be given to you the greatest can be given to you now we are the sons of God not we will be we are now we're seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus right now he says oh my When Faith like that gets into the church the devil moves away from come on but until then amen amen watch out Satan hasn't got any legal rights right at all over a Christian every time a man gets saved God just writes a out a whole big bunch of checks and puts his name at the bottom it says here you are fill them out are you scared to fill it out whatever things you desire When you pray believe that you receive it and it will be given to you mark 11:24 just believe it brother and sister that's why I understand more now of that scripture that the third pool cannot be impersonated why because the new bir can't be impersonated right did you get that the new birth brother Ram says cannot be in person you're either a of God from the eter and here you're Quicken by the power of God by the word of your age and you receive a true birth then your soul Hallelujah that changes it from unbelief to Faith that's why that scripture Mark 11 says if you believe amen that what you say and don't doubt in where in your heart and don't doubt in your heart hello somebody is anybody understanding and don't doubt in your heart if there is doubt in your heart there can't be Faith at the same time either fa or die Hallelujah Hallelujah with the power of the Holy Ghost comes into the soul it changes you pushes out that unbelief and replaces it with faith so that's a new birth it's Faith the holy spirit in your soul and if that faith is in the soul then you can believe what you say and not doubt in your heart and what you say come to pass hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallu glory to God and he says the world is falling apart what about the church what kind of a messiah is the church looking for today the church has cried the loudest so what we are hollering about a messiah what are we hollering for Revival in our time back this that and the other what are what are they looking for what more do they want what does the church want anyhow we've already got it Hallelujah we've already got it God gave it to us it's his promise for this hour we look in the Bible we see it everywhere Through the Bible anointed once come on and made the word live again right in the hour for that hour and again we've got the Messiah people want to see the Messiah oh if we can only see Messiah amen amen that's what they were saying in brother's day if we could only see Messiah and he had been quickened by the word to fulfill that word in the hour in which he was living and he lived Malachi he lived Revelations 10:7 he Liv Luke 1730 is that right many failed to see the Messiah what is the messiah word quickened for that hour and today many are are are wanting to see the Messiah remember how we said the other day now get this real good when brother B in the message influence he had been preaching the word speaking about the influence how the mighty Angel the Holy Spirit brought a coal of fire touch the lips of Isaiah amen he said that's the holy spirit amen because we are a people of unclean lips amen a man of unclean lips but what cleanses your lips what cleanses your life is the Holy Ghost brother said fire represented the baptism of the Holy Ghost then he he begins to talk about the word begins to talk about the opening of the word amen and then he says people you're not responding to the word and he says okay let me see if he can respond and he goes back to the second amen oh yeah yeah he says you sister you have such and such your name is such and such your address is such and such amen if you hear the tap you begin to hear people crying you begin to hear people sisters crying getting in the spirit and after brother does that on tap he says that's where you're deceived you see how can people only respond to first and second pool when it went to Second po oh yeah they responded oh they got the spirit oh yes they cried why because they were seeing something more visible something more you see oh he can discern that's real that's this and people once they look at something like that they they get accustomed to that and when something when God gives something else further than that they can't go to that that's what's happened in the message people today you hear comments all the time we used to hear it all the time amen preacher saying well if if you claim to have that power that third pool at this let me see you do the first and the second get well brother and sister I wasn't born under the first in second I'm not look for the first that's right brother that's right hallelujah hallelujah amen glory to God I don't have to do first and second because when I come to manifest the word in the age in which I'm living it ain't time for first and second hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's where that's where they're deceived the prophet himself said that's where you're deceived how can someone respond only to that but not to the opening of the word how can Pentecostals only response Amen to a Pentecostal preacher and not when the message of God is being preached because that's the kind of seed that's in so that's so they respond to that type of a message hallelujah hallelujah but brother they B this message this Ain a Pentecostal message this is the fullness of the word of God given in cricking to us in this hour so what they want to see in order for you to be a mature Son of God adopted they wanted they want you to to do first and second po they want you to discern the secrets and intents of the heart they want you to do the sign in the hand brother that's not my calling that's not my Ministry I goty that speaks of me that speaks of you say when they speak they shall create they speak am it shall come to pass when they speak amen it'll flash like that's what he and people today they they they want they're still wanting to see the same things that were done in the ministry of William BR 50 years ago but brother and if they don't see that they don't see a messiah if they don't see that they don't see the Messiah but let me tell you tonight by the very message itself the world is falling apart amen November of 63 he says we're looking in the Bible we're looking everywhere where is Messiah where is Messiah we want to see Messiah the church is crying we want to see Messiah where is Messiah he says we've got Messiah this is him the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and that word has to be flesh Hallelujah and he says this Hebrews 138 say yesterday today and forever we know what is supposed to take place in this day and we are wanting a messiah and God gave us the Messiah he promised the word for this day is just waiting for somebody with faith to anoint it and make it alive yes sir it's a real Messiah it's the word of God Jesus said heavens and earth will pass away my word shall never pass away and he goes on to say the Messiah of this day is the Bride of Jesus Christ want to see Messiah and God has a messiah upon the Earth but they can't see it a messiah is one that has been born by a supernatural Birth by the word of God for their hour quicking the word that pertains to them that's the anointed Messiah lord of the water and of the spirit hallelujah hallelujah oh my do you think they saw Messiah when they would look at Jesus they wouldn't see Messiah they said that's a son of Joseph you see my chairs in my table he made it she does real nice work amen you see this it's made out of wood over here he made that too amen you see my little coffee table he did that one too Hallelujah wow D it that's how they would look at Jesus Comming man yeah come on that's how they would see that's that's Jesus brother Jesus the brother see what I'm saying hallelujah and his own town is where he had his problems why okay cuz they're so catch it come on to see Jesus that's brother Jesus of birth hallelujah amen amen he could not have as much success and it was that uh next amen am because of the custom is that right the anointed word of the hour amen amen now listen this is why that there has to be a supernatural girl amen God hates a powerless religion amen amen the message all things God hates a powerless religion any religion today that hasn't got Christ in it is powerless but any religion Christ in is under his own blood it's got power in it you say God hates religion without power yes he said soln Feast is a stink and I guess he does hate it it makes him sick in this Le age he said you become lukewarm I'll speed you out of my mouth in other words it makes me sick you've come to that age and God sends Us in in Isaiah to chop the thing to Pieces lay it out before to the people to cry out to spare not spare not you you think he'd be accepted certainly notem Feast there speak God hates powerless religion it's got to have power it's got to have sincerity it's got to and sincerity brings sincerity brings real worship not forms but genuine po worship to know you've passed from Death God wants to perform his word by his power and when the church denies his power how can he perform or vindicate his word when the church explains it away and says oh it's that it's it's that other thing for some other day how can God who wants to fulfill his word perform his word among the people and the people deny that he does it yet they go through all the rituals amen they go through all the orders see M but solemn feasts are stink in the nostrils of God amen amenu the word without the quickening P cannot produce a birth brother Ram says the message broken sister preach in Phoenix pH 65 he says I am here in this beautiful atmosphere you know he was amongst Pentecost he says and I brought my daughter Amen to see to bring her into this atmosphere so she can have a new birth Hallelujah brother and sister sometimes we fail to realize I've I've preached this a few weeks before maybe a month I don't know that when we when we are here in service we not only are here for ourselves amen amen cuz if we're here for ourselves then however you feel that's how you you will be in the service but when you have a revelation you're you're here also for others you want to create an atmosphere for other no matter how you right yes sir amen and brother Bram said that's what happened on the day of Pentecost when they came out of that Upper Room the others that were there they said what shall we do to be saved right because they they felt that atmosphere and they wanted the same thing that's good and they begin to cause a domino effect is that right amen let us go to St John 16 just for a few moments verse 21 this is the message or the text brother was looking for when he preached birth pain remember we mentioned this on last Wednesday Hallelujah St John 16 verse 21 a woman when she is in travail have sorrow because her hour is come but as soon as she is delivered of of the child she remember no more the anguish for joy that a man is Born Into the world amen amen so the thing is the woman is in travail amen she's in birth pain her hour is come so this is the thing that when a woman in order to give birth she has to be under a certain atmosphere even says that if you catch this this is also true for the supernatural birth because brother B says in the natural birth the last months of that woman's pregnan there comes a real sweetness about the woman no matter how you know bitter she might be but there's a certain sweetness about her says because there's an angel around her and it's the angel of that baby hallelujah amen amen and she becomes real sweet because said the moment that that baby is born there's a spirit there amen amen to go into that baby the spirit is not in the baby while it's in the mother's womb amen hallelujah the spirit is there once it comes out out of the mother's wom is that right amen when Jesus was in the womb of Mary amen he was not being fed of Mary he was not grown because of what Mary ate hallelujah amen he wasn't in any ways made out of her her amen is that right amen amen or Joseph se he was directly of a supernatural Purpose By The spoken word of God while he was in the development after he was begotten amen he was begotten then he had to be born is that right amen so in that process God had to have a woman to put that word inside who was prophesied in the scriptures amen so a supernatural birth amen if you're understanding correctly has to have amen a place where it takes place and there has to be an atmosphere to bring that birth brother B says this words he said Mary was the incubator how many know what an incubator is an incubator is when a child is born IM premature amen perhaps three months five months they're putting an incubator because that child has not developed until the time or the point where it is to be born in in the ninth month process is that right so until that time if it comes prematurely it has to be put in an incubator in that incubator there is the same temperature that was in his mother's womb and they know by science what temperature is in the womb of the woman while that child is in the womb developing and growing amen and it is a very high temperature amen hallelujah it's not a cold Hallelujah come on brother it it it it's not a freezing temperature it's a real hot temperature it's an atmosphere that that child has to be in in order to come to birth correctly you understand so when brother mam says that Mary was an incubator in other words Mary was the wound to have that atmosphere of that temperature of that heat to bring a supernatural birth of Christ to pass Hallelujah am so the blood of Christ is bringing forth children in this hour by the same way so there must be an atmosphere must be a temperature Hallelujah there must be amen a high temperature in the womb of the bride of Christ in order to bring forth a supernatural birth that's why the word without the power God hates a powerless church amen and we are to be giving amen bir to Children of the word is that right and when that word hallelujah hu it's given is got to be a spirit there there's got to be an atmosphere there's got to be a Vindication to that word that is been given that is also taking place in the lives of the people we cannot just preach your message and pre about how God does this and God does that and if that word is not coming to pass amen that means that the power of God is not there to Quicken that word to bring it to pass or the faith that is supposed to be in the people is not there to make that word come to pass you understand we have a responsibility as the sons of God Christ to bring bird to his name and his if not they were bringing cats and dogs instead of sons brother M said you want to see who the church is in love with her children yes they'll tell you who she's in love with and you are part of this local assembly amen it's not just up to the ministry it's up to all of us to create an atmosphere because if there's no bird there there there's got to be an atmosphere there not to be a word amen that's right huj we are creators of atmosphere hallelujah hallelujah and brother this word cannot fail but there's got to be an atmosphere there got to be fi in order for that word to come to pass Hallelujah to God so the woman is in travail she's in praying she's praying she's she she's asking God oh God touch that boy today touch that sister give her a real experience how many of us I've been praying for your brother praying for your sister I have a real experience instead of criticizing your brother and and and how many times how you got down on your knees and travail to say God let them receive something that will change the way they are hallelujah hallelujah when that when that trail begins to come into the people brother Adam said I'd rather have one thing in the BR Tabernacle if they were to give me to choose what do you want William in the to amen you want shouting yes I want sh you want you know joy and dancing and singing yes I want that amen am but he said the main thing that I would want is to have a people amen that have burden Trail amen for the others to see birth that's right A lot of people are burdened but for other things I'm not talking about that I'm talking about being burdened see he says because if that is there the rest will take place dancing will take place Joy will take place amen because when the woman delivers a child she doesn't remember no more of her anguish for the joy that a man is Born Into the world hallah do you understand oh my that's why the new birth is something Supernatural brother B says this we will never go back but we will go forward when you're born again amenu when you're born again you never go backward you always go forward this is the message birth pain and he says that's why I think today we have so many amen or not so many genuine new births is because the seed maybe will sympathize with the word or the person but they don't want to run away of the old system that they were in they don't want come out of it they want to stay in the old system and claim the new birth he says or the message of this age we found that under Lu W pcal and all the other ages they still try to hold to the old system but the old system Must Die rocked in order to bring a new one but people still want to clean with those things they know the old system is dead they know there's nothing there but they still want to clean when it really is done away with a claim is made that they are born again but a claim is only a begotten sign brings forth New Birth you've got to run away just as we did in all the ages amen through the wesle and all all so forth but the New Birth when Luther came for it was with one word the just shall live by faith then there come another one and another one the old system always has to die in order for the new one to come on when Wesley's age cease and all the little ages then Pentecost come out restoration of the gifts amen amen they had to come out of all the Baptist Presbyterian Pilgrim holiness had to come out of all of that right away to accept the new birth Hallelujah to accept the new birth that's why people don't understand that you can't be born again outside of the revelation of this hour there's no New Birth strings there might be confessions professions amen members of church but there's no new births outside of the revelation of this hour ain't no New Birth no hallu you believe that say amen amen hallelujah mes could not have brought no message neither could Jesus have brought Noah's message it was for another age it served his purpose it was dead and gone the transformation from the old to the new where the life was at what was worrying the people what worries them today we're not building a wall like we start off with with Luther's message if that was the case we would go straight down the line just building blocks and more blocks and blocks cuz it's straight keep following the same line that Luther was going but we're not building a wall we're building a building and when there's turns of Corners amen that's what you have to know God's blueprint that's his word anybody can just keep running a straight line but a true it takes a true Mason to turn the corner it takes the power of God in order to do that today it takes the power of God hallelujah hallelujah amen that's why many today even the message they take taking a certain line a certain line and they'll St on that line amen but it takes the power of God to turn the Hallelujah hallu it takes an anointed one from Heaven to God to bring turn and in the prophet's age word of the Lord comes to the prophets and they turn those Corners they made those difference but the builders want to build a wall but this is the building of God that the system was rocked in every age until she's brought forth that church out of the rockness come forth the word the word of the Lord comes forth and finally the word was born in human flesh the fullness of the godhead B rested in him he was the word the prophets is part of the word the word for their age amen but we notice he was the entire fullness of the word he when they was accusing him of making himself equal to God Amen am and brother and sister souls in prison now said those that are born of the word of God the word of the Lord comes to them and they are the word to the people they are written epist of all men hallelujah hallelujah God again fulfilling in human flesh the scriptures for the age and he said could this be the third po yes in birth pains he says every believer that accepts God's word into their heart I don't care what system you know what it is it's a promise of God it was revealed to you by the Holy Ghost when you were overshadowed with his power you know where it's at no man has the right to preach the gospel until he's met God On The Backs side of the desert in a burning bush there's no ecclesiastical system in the world that can explain away from you you know where you are it happened to you I don't care what the system say you are a witness hallelujah hallelujah he says I feel like the old color man I ain't got enough room up here now I feel religious God himself revealed to you he says Now quickly in this stage beyond a shadow of a doubt in the age of Lea her messenger is promis in Malachi the fourth chapter he's promised to do it and the message is to bring back the word bring the people back to the word the birth is supposed to be she is she is to be delivered amen birth according Hallelujah did you hear that the new birth of the Bride is according to Malachi outside of that ain't no New Birth amen that's why when Mary come to the temple amen amen to find Jesus they thought he was with them but they found out he wasn't with
