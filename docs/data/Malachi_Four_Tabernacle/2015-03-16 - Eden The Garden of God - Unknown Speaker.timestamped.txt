[29:33] I noticed I guess we want to knowledge
[29:37] now
[29:42] amen
[29:44] [Music]
[29:49] Gloria hi remember when Adam had the
[29:54] title
[29:58] in the bridge between the ages and the
[30:00] seals
[30:02] every statement is important
[30:05] yes
[30:07] because I'm declaring what the prophet
[30:09] says
[30:13] because it fits in and makes it
[30:19] breaks between the ages and the seals
[30:23] Adam lost his Fellowship because
[30:26] right he broke a fellowship he lost the
[30:31] title I went back to the
[30:35] originals he says Adam lost his
[30:38] inheritance
[30:41] [Music]
[30:44] amen yeah
[30:46] Alice
[30:48] the other band said
[30:50] Jesus coming through some names
[30:53] but he really showed us for me amen

[31:10] yes
[31:19] which is will be in truth
[31:26] he said Son of Abraham
[31:31] to the land
[31:34] amen the Royal Branch
[31:39] wherever your eyes
[31:50] Paul says in Galatians it was Christ
[31:56] [Music]
[32:16] the spirit
[32:18] is that right
[32:19] but I purposely left the last the last
[32:24] because he said son of man is listen
[32:27] it's heir to the Earth
[32:31] amen
[32:35] notice
[32:37] Adam lost his inheritance
[32:42] it passed from his hand
[32:45] to the one he he sold up to again he
[32:50] sold his faith in God the order of
[32:52] Satan's reasoning therefore it is
[33:07] amen amen and it went
[33:10] notice here he says Satan's filthy hand
[33:13] he says
[33:36] [Music]
[33:45] because the other quote says Satan's
[33:49] Filthy Hands

[37:14] says it isn't
[37:16] dress the inner man
[37:19] you know they call it inner spirits
[37:22] he calls it inner man so the spirit is

[1:35:10] he says I was talking to a person not
[1:35:13] long ago
[1:35:14] he was trying to discuss with me insane
[1:35:17] because
[1:35:18] aren't you ashamed to say that God
[1:35:21] created Heavens in
[1:35:23] six days and things
[1:35:28] that's what the Bible says
[1:35:32] he said well I got evidence
[1:35:37] I can prove that the world is millions
[1:35:40] of years old
[1:35:42] I said that don't have anything to do
[1:35:45] with it
[1:35:47] Genesis 1 1 it said in the beginning God
[1:35:52] created him as an Earth
[1:35:55] but from that period
[1:35:59] so more than billions
[1:36:06] there's no measure to say oh two billion
[1:36:09] three millions
[1:36:11] like shine like what a man says about

[1:36:19] all his life study in the bones don't
[1:36:22] know what's up and then he says there's
[1:36:24] and he's discovered that it was some
[1:36:28] million year old years old
[1:36:31] really he said
[1:36:33] you know it's common sense to let you
[1:36:36] know
[1:36:37] bone dissolves in the ground
[1:36:40] after so many years well I guess I gotta
[1:36:43] actually take billions
[1:36:46] notice
[1:36:52] the heavens in the earth period
[1:36:55] that's all he says
[1:36:57] this is
[1:36:59] now the world
