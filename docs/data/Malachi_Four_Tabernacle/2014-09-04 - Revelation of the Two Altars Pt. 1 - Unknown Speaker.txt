huah because brother Ram said we heard it Sunday night what causes spiritual Amion when you're shock a great shock is that right amen is that right what does that make you do makes you lose your identity teach where you don't know who you are you begin to forget amen the purpose of God is that right brother saids me we heard it on T amen many times when we say it you see people might say well he's saying that because he wants to say it but when you when you hear it amen and I believe God really spoke to us Sunday night and you hear the prophet amen rebuking the church and saying you're fine people you're good people amen he says but you need you need a Revival in your soul he said you spiritual Amnesia he said it kills me when I go he says I go everywhere and I'm preaching he says and the people when they come hear the word they come with a certain attitude and they say Lord well I'm here you want to do lord lord it's your word whatever you want to do here I am said that kills me yes that's not the attitude we should come in he says that's what he said he says where's that enthusiasm where is that Faith towards the word amen where is that fire in our soul the word of God amen amen see and brother says that those symptoms upon us we don't want one bit of that amen hallelujah because that's why the age of blind naked amen wretched poor and she what she didn't know it amen called out of that by the word of God is that right not to know it spirit so now we want to speak tonight by the help of the Holy Spirit the revelation of the two altars amen hallelujah revelation of the two alts now this is something that God wants to bring personal make it personal to each one this is the hour where the promises of God to his bride to the believer amen are unfailing promises and those unfailing promises of his word amen is what is going to bring to pass amen what he has prophesied concerning our lives what we think amen is impossible to reach amen but With God all things are possible I can do all things Christ has Stranges amen amen hallelujah but the thing is we must know how to approach god brother mam said there is a Divine Way of how to approach Amen to God in his word that's the reason why he said many can come a certain way and they don't receive what they come looking for because we must come God's provided place and God's provided way is that right am Hallelujah now the two altars in the scripture this is a scene amen you can read it even from way back in Exodus uh 25 and if the Lord permits I want to continue on this subject because there's some tremendous things in here I'm not going to read this amen but in in Exodus 25 he begins to tell Moses amen how he is to fulfill the vision that God gave him upon the mountains when the cloud came to pick Moses up and In This Cloud amen Moses has a vision and what Vision does he have he has a vision of the Tabernacle of God he has a vision of what's in heaven and this great Tabernacle which is what he did when he came back to the Earth to to the children of Israel amen amen this great vision that he had the Tabernacle of the Lord was beginning to unfold itself because he then begin to give instruction and there was predestinated people amen that was going to fulfill these things the purpose of the vision amen first of all was a place so that the children of Israel could come to that place and worship God it was God's provided place for worship and the other thing is that he wanted to come in the Fulfillment of that Vision he wanted to come down and dwell in the midst of Israel did he dwell in the midst of Israel when the when the vision was fulfilled Israel was all around the Tabernacle and he was in their midst is that right was God himself there did he go behind the the veil in the sh Glory filled the whole house but it stayed in a certain place is that right amen so all that Moses see on in heaven amen he come back down and he pitched the tent that right and when he did that it was because there was a people there that had been called out is that right they were called out of Egypt they were called out by that message amen God had already come down and said I have come down with a shout to deliver my people amen I'm coming this way they were a called out people there were called out group so God had predestinated people elected men amen that were going to help Moses in the Fulfillment of the great vision the meeting place amen so what happened he begin to build this according to the vision and the pattern in heaven amen amen hallelujah and the thing is you can see many points of this but you know that God amen amen he had come down to Moses he had met him in a burning bush he had spoke to him different ways the children of Israel were following the pillar of fire following the cloud God would speak to him is that right all these different forms but then God tells Moses this is in the scripture Amen in Exodus 25 but it tells him you guys are going to build this amen and in and in the Holiness of holies you're going to build a Ark made out of wood and you're going to cover it with gold and in that there you're going to place amen what I'm going to give you upon the mountain what did Moses receive when God met up up on the mount and the unveiling of God 1964 brother says when Moses came on the scene he had the Revelation he had met the pillar of fire it was revealed to Moses how Genesis was he wrote the first four books of the Bible for he met God in the form of the pillar of fire the pillar of fire that veiled he was veiled in the pillar of fire is that right amen that's why brother said that Piller of fire is also the veil of God his Angel is his Veil is that right hallelujah amen see he he he can manifest himself in any form is that right he he can be a man he can be king MZ he can be a bum yeah amen hallelujah amen mhm did St Martin give half of his Coke to a bu that was laying there hungry starving the death with long beard and dirty bum laying there on Street say I'm cold who was that amen hallelujah God can become anything he wants amen hallelujah us look what he says and he says and Paul met him the disciples wrote what they seen the disciples wrote what they seen But Moses had the Revelation Paul had the Revelation he went down into Egypt for three years studi and see the Old Testament amen amen he's think of it the same Pillar of Fire come upon those men in the Bible is the same fire that's here today interpreting the Bible how we thank him for that the same what a comfort what a identification I'm so glad to be identified in that I don't know what to do you I'd rather be identified in that than all of everything else identify in that word the Shina Glory the Revelation leads where the sh glory and the Revelation lay the pillar of fire appearing visibly Among Us Again identifying that the message is right like he did on Mount remember before the true Messenger come forth Moses preached and he led them out of Egypt but before that was before the real Commandments was laid down the seals was brought in God come down before the people and Prov that Moses was sent from him in that Pillar of Fire mes said he had seen him in the burning bush talk to him in this last days same Pillar of Fire is Right Among Us speaking the same word not only that but interpreting it and making it manifest proving it is the truth and people has only has one way to disbelieve it least they just willfully want to disbelieve the word but he that sins willfully after having received the knowledge of the truth there remain no more s for that now notice when this scene unfold amen and God gave Moses hallelujah hallelujah amen there Commandments tables of stone is that right tables of St Hallelujah is what he brought down and he put inside of the Ark is that right is that is where he put what God gave him on the mountain where the prophet of God said here amen he was tying that he was speaking between the lines showing us the same thing has happened in this hour amen that's why Paul said in the scripture amen he prophesied and took the prophecy of Jeremiah and put the prophecy back into the future again just like Peter took the prophecy of Moses and in Deuteronomy 18 and put that prophecy Back to the Future again people don't catch that they just think it was fulfilled in Jesus but Peter in Acts three took the same prophecy Deuteronomy that had already been fulfilled and he said the Lord your God will raise up a prophet like unto me and whosoever doesn't hear that Prophet be cut from the midst of of their Brethren amen what did Paul do he took the prophecy of Jeremiah that said I will make my Covenant with these people I will write my law upon the tables of their heart amen that's why the scripture says I'll change Your Heart of Stone yes because in the Heart of Stone I can't write my laws anymore that was for Moses I wrote my laws upon tables of stone Hallelujah but eel glory to God said and prophesied I'll change your heart of soul and I'll give you a heart of Flesh because Jeremiah had prophesied that he was going to write his laws in the in the tables amen of his people's heart is that right amen and they shall be my people and I will be their God that what the scripture says hallelujah hallelujah so brother and sister that's the reason why this revelation of the open book it's not some literal book it's a revelation that comes into the person that is receiving the open book Hallelujah that's right that's why when brother came out of the mountain he didn't have tablets of stone he didn't have a book amen a scroll that had seven SE and was open oh no no he had a revelation and night after night in that room the angel would come and reveal to him this is the first seal this is the first seal and he would go back to the scripture and look at it through the Bible that what he said he says and I found that and then I would come out and preach it amen amen Revelation do not lay in the mind in the soul hallelujah hallelujah said this is a c I make with my people I will write my laws upon their heart am that right so what did Moses of our day what did he receive a on the mountain the seeds yes and what was to be put into the alt amen hallelujah true Commandments hallelujah hallelujah amen glory come on brother then we see hallelujah amen am we read the scripture here amen of one altar and exodus 29 38 to 46 that one alar he speaking amen amen you shall offer upon this one altar two Ls that righten and where is the second second altars and chap 30 and verse one says Thou shalt make an altar to burn in no sacrifice there no l there in in two altars amen Hallelujah two altars there was one of the altars was an altar of bronze that's the first one the other alt is the altar of amen hallelujah you want to read that look at Chapter 30 verse two a cub shall be the length thereof a cub the bread thereof Four Square it shall be so amen hallelujah for square see can't be lock side it's got to be even and it's four squ now listen verse three and thou shall overlay it with pure gold the top thereof the size thereof round about and horns thou sh make unto it a crown of gold round about he's not talking about the ark no no this is where the Revelation comes you keep reading it he shows you that this Al not the understand this altar is next to the AR the second altar is inside the Veil oh the first altar altar number one braz altar is before the H that's where they offer a lamb take the blood and the priest enters into the holy of holies with the blood of that L all right and then over here Beyond these veils he has in the center the Ark of the Covenant that right there is also of gold it has the cherubin it's a box amen Inside the Box amen of wood that's over with gold is the Commandments and above that is The Mercy Seat The Mercy Seat is where the ark is right up top of brother R preaches that you read in the Bible brother mentions that in the message the AR but if you notice it's the same place where the ark is the mercy se but the scripture says here that this altar number two altar amen am that is also made out of wood amen amen and it's overl with gold and verse six says Thou shalt put it before the veil that is by the Ark of the testimony before the seat that is over the testimony will Hallelujah woo glory amen amen it's by the AR of this is on this side one altar is on that side another altar is on the inside and upon this altar amen amen you offer in amen Hallelujah not blood the blood of the lamb from the Brazen altar is sprinkled upon the mercy seat seven times but there's another altar right there you in Hallelujah am yes if you understand amen what incense is amen yes Amen in the New Testament you you understand that we're talking about prayer yes pray yes prayer cannot be answer unless there sacrifice yes amen hallelujah there's a certain way to pray to God amen amen there's a certain provider way to approach the of God and God had a purpose and showing these two altars in the shadow type in the Old Testament you believe that you believe Moses seen these two altars in heaven and the Bible speaks of them in the Book of Revelation amen amen alter alar of sacrifice two altars upon the altar of sacrifice you offer two Lambs yes am not just one amen two of them one in the morning we read upon this one for two land two land in the morning one in the evening and after the evening sacrifice hallelujah amen then you can offer in you can now offer incense amen until the second L amen has been SL upon the bra Altar and after the braz altar after the braz altar amen and before the veil is seven golden candles right amen hallu so look and the same things that are given hallelujah hallelujah Oh Glory oh GL see for the first lamb is the same thing you you do for the second you have meal you have oil and you have wine the same thing it's the same sacrifice amen it's the same way of sacrificing amen so these two altars the one there the bra an altar and the altar of gold Amen in the mind of God they're Inseparable they're linked together notice brother prayer only has value if there's it has no value if there's no sacrifice token token has to be a sacrif for that's right amen come on the cannot come and offer incense in the holy of holies if he doesn't bring lamb or blood from the L that's right and when he brings the blood the ve opens by itself amen and he comes in and and he sprinkles the blood upon the mercy seat and then he can offer incense upon the secondar hallu he cannot offer incense which is prayer for us he doesn't bring blood brother there was a first lb in the morning Hallelujah Jesus Christ sacrific on the cross and that early church recognize now we can offer incense that's right because we have a lamb am did the Pharisees pray in the times of the church would they pray yes sure yes they pray amen oh my were their prayers received no sacrifice come on brother did God answer theay oh they pray yeah they pray but brother when the when the Believers when the alpha Bri that day when they would pray the building would sh Hallelujah yes when they would pray the pillar of fire come down Hallelujah and set Peter out of jail when they would pray things would happen it was incense going into the presence of God and their prayers were answered because they had a sacrifice that's good that's good brother that the whole Bible makes emphasis that's to be revealed that's right God himself not me not the prophet God himself entire scripture put more emphasis yes the that's right uhuh it's not interpretation out by saying that religious Spirits jump up and say you're making Jesus nothing no no you don't understand who Jesus is that's right J yeah Jesus is the word what was what is the same crci in theing it's the word that's right it's right it's the word hallelujah hallu and we have a sacrifice Omega Omega amen amen and Omega bride that's right and this Omega bride know amen that we can offer prayer unto God believing that we have the father's name revealed to us and he said anything you ask Hallelujah the father in my name and Jesus said I come in the name of my father I have revealed the name I have manifested the name I have glorified name to these that you have given me and the name is revealed that we know that when we ask we receive what we ask for believing amen that those things that we say we receive is that right yes hallelujah oh brother when there's a sacrifice then prayer is answered that's good brother under this message you got the Bible real quick under this message amen elij came and what did he do he came to restore the yes let's read first king over First Kings read verse 25 look at that and Elijah sent the prophet you one bulock for yourselves and dress it there are many and call on the name of your Gods but put no fire under and they took the bulock which has given them and they dressed and call on the name of Bale from morning until noon say oh hear us they hear us but there was no voice nor any that answered and they leap and jumped the altar which was made amen right now let's go down to verse 29 and it came to pass when midday was passed and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that there was neither voice nor any to answer nor any that regarded see I wonder why it doesn't say in the in the Spanish but verse 29 in the in the English it says that until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice so in the time of the evening sacrifice what did Elijah do said unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came near to him and he repaired Hallelujah the altar of the Lord that was broken down heed it because it was broken down amen he repaired The Altar and what did he knew when he repaired the altar amen amen hallelujah he took 12 ston if you read the Bible when Moses received that Revelation from the cloud and those 12 Stones were put on the on the ephod Amen on the breastplate of Aaron did you know that those 12 Stones have something engraven on them yes the names of the 12 tribes there was names engraving on Stone does that sound familiar the new names somebody repairing the altar amen he puts there the 12 Stones and with the with the stones he he built the altar in the name of the Lord right then he puts all the water and he know he does all that puts the water there amen amen verse 36 and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came near and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel let it be known this day that thou God in Israel that I thy servant that I've done all these things at Thy word when me oh Lord hear me this day may they know that thou are Lord God and that thou has turned their heart back to turn the hearts of the children to the faith of Abraham is is that what he was doing let it be known God these people here have been under the curse of jaell but this is the time of the evening sacrifice I want you to notice something and this is amen a good thing to to to to see what these religious Spirits are doing in the last days the morning sacrifice was being done and preached and given by B worship amen does that mean something to you H the morning sacrifice was being preached amen who worships B to is that just Old Testament is that only in the Bible or does the Book of Revelation speak of B worship was that done in the New Testament is that here today in the denomination the morning sacrifice but when Elijah comes time of the evening sacrifice to turn the heart to the children Hallelujah whe it's upon the evening am what happens there fire comes and vindicates amen that thing is that right what was the first lamb that was slain on the earth when was it slain the of on the earth the first lamb that was slain it was slain in the Garden of Eden when God would come down to speak to his children what time would he come down evening hey he would come down in the cool of the evening Hallelujah and when he came down that certain day he said where thou amen oh brother and what for would he come down to fellowship with him was it just a voice you see the denominational mind says the voice was speaking from the invisible and saying Adam where are th God already knows where ad was no no no no hallu it wasn't like that read the Bible Genesis 3 verse 8 the Bible says the voice walked amen hallelujah you ever notice that in the scripture how you ever seen a voice walk Genesis 3 says that when that happened The Voice brother say Amen what would come down to fellowship with them the pillar of fire right it was the L Hallelujah it was the lights there flashing in the great Cathedral of God and the lamb Hallelujah Hallelujah when he found it with fig leaves in the evening time took the Fig leaves off he spoke a l into existence and he SL it in the evening time it was the evening that he and evening in the evening is that right what did God command Moses before The Exodus in Exodus 12 slay a lamb without blemish perfect hallelujah hallelujah examine it for 14 days and slay it in the evening time yes amen amen all of the emphasis of the scriptures is a sacrifice in the evening time you see why this day the token could be applied am after the lamb was slave in the evening time now let's keep going now Ain the only braces no no no no in the Book of Daniel when the mighty angel Gabriel came down amen am to speak seven Thunders to to Daniel in the Book of Daniel the Bible says hallelujah hallelujah in chapter n of Daniel Amen you have the scripture there Daniel chapter 9 the scripture say hallelujah amen what was Daniel doing he
