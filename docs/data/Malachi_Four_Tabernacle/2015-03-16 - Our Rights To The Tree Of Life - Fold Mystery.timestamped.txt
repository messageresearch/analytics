[0:29] shall begin to sound the mystery of God
[0:32] should be finished you have declared to
[0:34] his servants the
[0:42] prophets you have to understand that
[0:44] John is in a
[0:46] vision and he seeing this unfold before
[0:50] himself brother mam said in the message
[0:53] revelation of Jesus
[0:55] Christ that it took John about two or
[0:59] three years
[1:01] to write the Book of
[1:02] Revelation
[1:04] Amen to write the Book of
[1:07] Revelation if you were to begin writing
[1:10] now from verse one of chapter one and
[1:15] write it all the way to chapter
[1:17] 22 the last verse it wouldn't take you
[1:21] three
[1:24] years is that right but the reason it
[1:26] took him many
[1:28] years because he was seeing
[1:31] this unfold before
[1:33] himself this was Revelation he was
[1:36] hearing
[1:37] things he was seeing things and he was
[1:40] commanded to write what he see what he
[1:44] heard but there was many things that the
[1:47] angel told him don't write

[1:53] have
[1:55] utter you understand so what how long

[2:06] us how long it took him to write the
[2:07] Book of
[2:10] Revelation you understand what I'm
[2:12] saying but in the days of the voice of
[2:16] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[2:19] sound what amen what he heard which was
[2:24] sealed and written in symbol
[2:28] form it is in the Bible it's in there
[2:33] but it is sealed is that right what's
[2:36] going to be made known the mystery of
[2:39] God is going to be finished is that
[2:42] right Hallelujah and we see then verse
[2:47] eight The Voice which I heard from
[2:49] Heaven spake to me again and said go and
[2:52] take the little book which is open in
[2:54] the hand of the Angel which standeth
[2:55] upon the sea and upon the
[2:58] Earth
[3:07] what are we speaking on this morning the
[3:10] right to the Tree of Life what do we
[3:13] read in Genesis
[3:15] 3 verse

[3:22] stretch forth his
[3:25] hand and take the little
[3:28] book let us Place
[3:31] Cher amen who's the book
[3:35] of am who's the Tree of
[3:39] Life who's the River of Life it's all
[3:43] the same
[3:45] person in different form different
[3:50] symbols there's only one
[3:53] source of eternal life and that's God
[3:57] himself he is the author of eternal
[4:02] life is that right so he is The Book of
[4:06] Life in the message it is the rising of
[4:09] the sun brother says the
[4:13] seals was
[4:15] Jesus taking the seals off of
[4:19] himself taking the
[4:21] seals off of
[4:24] himself he the
[4:28] book

[4:38] in revelation
[4:40] 22 amen he that know all his
[4:43] Commandments he has a right
[4:47] the so you
[4:49] see Revelations
[4:52] 108 I hope you're in the channel this
[4:55] morning you're supposed to come prayed
[4:57] and
[4:58] prepared amen singing and worshiping God
[5:02] so when the word is going forward you're
[5:05] in the
[5:11] channel Revelation
[5:15] 10 why is John a type of the
[5:19] Bride able to stretch forth his
[5:23] hand and take the
[5:26] book why revelation 22
[5:31] 14 those that have a right to the Tree
[5:34] of Life are those that does all his
[5:39] Comm
[5:41] Hallelujah but in order to fulfill
[5:45] that Revelation
[5:49] 224 the full revelation of the
[5:53] word had to
[5:55] come because
[5:58] Jesus as we seen
[6:00] Wednesday was the only one that was
[6:04] able to live by every
[6:08] word in the message Harvest Time brother
[6:12] mam showed us is that right that Moses
[6:17] live part of the
[6:18] word but he Smit The
[6:22] Rock and he got angry he wasn't allowed
[6:25] to enter into the promised
[6:28] land that was Moses
[6:32] failing though he was a great prophet
[6:36] though he was anointed though he had
[6:38] great
[6:39] Visions though he was one of the
[6:41] greatest prophets of the Old
[6:44] Testament he
[6:46] fail Noah a great prophet That Was
[6:51] preparing a people to go into the new
[6:55] world hallelujah amen the only way of
[6:58] Escape
[7:00] was through his message a great prophet
[7:03] is that right but yet once he come out
[7:07] of the Ark the Bible says he planted a
[7:12] Vineyard is that right and then he drank
[7:14] from it and got
[7:17] drunk said Noah
[7:20] failed glory to God hallelujah
[7:24] hallelujah so no matter how great these
[7:27] prophets were
[7:30] even John the Baptist brother bam
[7:33] said why did
[7:35] Jesus say that John the Baptist was
[7:39] greater than all the
[7:40] prophets amen it was not a man born of a
[7:44] woman as great as John the Baptist is
[7:47] that right glory to God he said because
[7:50] he was to introduce the angel of the
[7:53] coven amen that was the reason he was
[7:57] great he never even performed a miracle
[8:01] but he was greater than all the
[8:03] prophets but Jesus himself said
[8:06] Hallelujah huj but the least in the
[8:10] kingdom of God is greater
[8:14] than hallelujah hallelujah GL because
[8:18] brother and sister the Old Testament
[8:21] prophets never receiv the Holy Ghost in
[8:23] their
[8:25] soul amen they were never born again no
[8:29] sir it take the blood of the Lamb to
[8:34] take away sin in order for the Holy
[8:37] Ghost come back into the human
[8:40] heart there can not be a
[8:43] Pentecost without a
[8:47] Calvary hallelujah

[24:24] revealed hallelujah hallelujah the
[24:26] presence of God is only where he is
[24:30] revealed where he is
[24:32] accepted where his plan is

[24:39] believe that everything else
[24:43] is everything else the glory of the Lord
[24:47] has
[24:49] Departed the day inations took AED
[24:55] instead of the word of God fath
[24:58] the glory leaves and it never

[52:59] that presence and then once you come in
[53:03] have a desire to stay there to remain
[53:07] there and never come out of
[53:11] that let me read this to you without
[53:14] money without price I was preaching on
[53:17] this Friday night now notice I heard our
[53:21] beloved Pastor brother Neville make a
[53:26] remark on His Radio
[53:28] cast this morning it went over in my
[53:34] mind just I can't forget it I quoted it
[53:38] to a friend of mine last
[53:40] night and there after
[53:43] taking he said that the time will come
[53:48] where the taking
[53:49] away of the Holy Spirit out of the Earth
[53:52] how many know that how many know that
[53:54] there's coming a time that there will be
[53:57] no more Holy
[53:58] Spirit for the world for nobody though
[54:03] they can cry they can come to the altar
[54:06] they can bang on the door say open up I
[54:09] want to come in brother we won't have no
[54:12] more church
[54:13] services we won't have no more services
[54:17] you won't have a pastor up here
[54:20] preaching this message you won't have
[54:23] access to the life the door will be
[54:29] closed the way to the tree of life now
[54:34] it's
[54:35] open right before you right now Jesus
[54:38] said I am the way I am the I am the
[54:43] truth but the day is coming when the
[54:46] Holy Spirit will be taken and it'll only
[54:50] be given to
[54:53] 144,000 only
[54:56] no one else will be receiving the Holy
[54:59] Ghost except
[55:04] 144,000 brother I believe the greatest
[55:09] torment in the
[55:11] tribulation is that the presence of God
[55:15] is not
[55:16] there do you hear me
[55:19] today the day is coming when that Holy
[55:23] Spirit will be taken away
[55:26] from the Gentiles there will be no more
[55:29] Holy Ghost there will be no more
[55:31] preaching of this word
[55:35] no that day would have
[55:37] ended the
[55:39] testimony of the Bride will preach to
[55:43] the eternally

[1:02:05] they preach the
[1:02:07] word oh he preaches a message they all
[1:02:10] preach the word it's all the same it's
[1:02:13] all the same
[1:02:14] message they don't know the
[1:02:16] difference

[1:02:21] of God is there or not
[1:02:25] amen
[1:02:26] amen
[1:02:29] amen hallu God only visits his

[1:02:43] not everywhere it's only in one
[1:02:48] place and he says this he says he
[1:02:51] says they don't know not knowing the
[1:02:56] difference how many heard that
[1:02:59] congregation says amen wasn't that
[1:03:07] aound they don't know the holy
[1:03:12] spirit so they won't
[1:03:15] know when it's
[1:03:17] gone wow oh
[1:03:21] Lord they don't know pres today so when
[1:03:26] he
[1:03:32] leaves and he
[1:03:35] says that they won't know when it's
[1:03:38] gone they'll just be going right on just
[1:03:41] the
[1:03:42] same when the last
[1:03:45] one is sealed into the body of
[1:03:48] Christ they will still be going on
[1:03:51] trying to bring
[1:03:53] converts am because they won't know what
[1:03:56] it
[1:03:57] is and their formal
[1:04:00] religion will continue on just like they
[1:04:04] were it may not sink into you like it
[1:04:08] did to
[1:04:10] me that statement let it sink
[1:04:15] inlu it sink into
[1:04:18] the don't let it go over your
[1:04:22] head the holy spirit is speaking to
[1:04:25] you you're the one that's sitting
[1:04:28] here this is not being preached to that
[1:04:30] liquor store over
[1:04:32] there or to hosana
[1:04:34] fellowship or or or somewhere else to

[1:05:10] you now notice he says he says they'll
[1:05:14] go
[1:05:14] on they they'll still continue on they
[1:05:18] won't know when it's gone because they
[1:05:20] don't know what it is their formal
[1:05:23] religion
[1:05:25] will continue on just the same it may
[1:05:27] not sink to you like it did to
[1:05:31] me but that was really an astounding
[1:05:35] statement that they'll be so far
[1:05:38] away just in religious
[1:05:41] rituals until they won't miss the holy
[1:05:45] spirit because they don't know what it
[1:05:48] is to begin
[1:05:50] with God have mercy on us brother I'd
