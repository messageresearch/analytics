[0:00] the inspiration that we received of
[0:03] Sunday morning as we were preaching
[0:07] some things
[0:09] the Lord had to say that it wasn't
[0:12] really in our notes okay
[0:21] just meditating on that is
[0:33] a benefit to help amen
[0:36] because when we understand
[0:42] the one that
[0:44] that wants to bring these things to our
[0:46] attention
[0:48] then we can understand
[0:51] amen it is it's for a purpose and that
[0:56] purpose is
[0:57] that we might walk in that word
[1:01] we might manifest that comments
[1:05] so he wants to bring it to our attention
[1:09] he wants us to understand
[1:12] and he wants us to walk in there
[1:15] so we want to speak on the absolute
[1:18] tonight maybe
[1:23] touch a few things
[1:26] a bit not as we maybe have heard it
[1:33] before
[1:36] just in the way that brother
[1:39] brings it hear the message
[1:43] it's really something that uh okay this
[1:47] in connection with
[1:49] Unlimited
[2:33] I think
[2:35] it's an ultimate
[2:37] an absolute
[2:39] it's used many times
[2:42] it's the last word
[2:45] it's the amen you hear people say
[2:49] absolutely absolutely that's the last
[2:53] thing it's unlimited see right that
[2:58] takes from here
[3:21] tied to every great achievement
[3:24] has been an action absolutely to every
[3:28] person everything that's been there
[3:32] or done rather there has been an
[3:36] absolute connected with it
[3:38] there's got to be something for It's the
[3:42] final time folks
[3:45] and man cannot by no means
[3:49] achieve anything I get closer so there
[3:52] comes somewhere where they recognized
[3:55] that there is
[3:58] God has given us an absolutely
[4:02] this is the hour of the action
[4:05] because Revelations 3 14 says
[4:09] amen that he is the amen is that right
[4:17] he the beginning the creation of the
[4:19] creation of God foreign
[5:21] all right come in then brother Madam
[5:22] goes on to tell us
[5:24] he says in this crucial hour
[5:27] that's where they're like this
[5:30] we must have something that we are
[5:34] positive people some things
[5:38] to know whether how case the case is
[5:41] going
[5:43] amen amen and the absolutely hit itself
[5:47] and see it is Unlimited in power
[5:51] primarily is an ultimate is
[5:58] an amen
[6:03] that's everything amen amen he says
[6:06] you've got to you've got to have
[6:08] everything
[6:10] is all you've got to have somewhere
[6:13] where you can tie down how many believes
[6:18] that you have to stand for something in
[6:20] this house
[6:28] Hallelujah
[6:30] if you don't stand for something
[6:36] amen amen so you have to have some
[6:40] please
[6:41] where you can tie yourself too
[6:44] is that right I mean Paul says it in
[6:47] Hebrews it's the anchor of the Soul
[6:51] amen amen lies behind the veil is that
[6:56] right
[7:00] now we have to have somewhere
[7:03] especially in these times of time
[7:06] amen where he said in the absolute
[7:09] message
[7:10] that is like in the days of the judges
[7:14] amen when after the days of Joshua
[7:19] Joshua had left to see
[8:19] is here
[9:19] doesn't make
[9:51] remember this uh Sunday how we were
[9:54] reading the quotes and looking at how
[9:56] I'm
[10:02] giving this uh this testimony many many
[10:05] times all over the message
[10:10] how he spoke to a Catholic priest
[10:16] and then we're speaking about yeah the
[10:20] authority of the word and brother Venom
[10:24] said that this Catholic priests
[10:32] or debate with him to say
[10:35] God is in his church
[10:38] amen amen because the Catholic church is
[10:42] the one that has a right to you know
[10:43] move whatever thing the work says
[10:47] in other words whatever they say
[10:51] Amen that the Bible means
[10:56] saying well that's an heir person
[11:05] God's in his church
[11:14] but to see when you when you like we
[11:17] were saying Sunday many can take that
[11:19] and
[11:22] fail to see the Promise oh
[12:32] what he wants done with the word foreign
[13:34] back to the face of the father
[13:37] so welcome the Lord Jesus
[13:41] when he returns
[13:45] she'll be hearing from the spirit she
[13:48] said
[13:52] but the spirit give his life
[13:59] God made it in such a way that no matter
[14:02] how much man can study the letter of the
[14:05] word
[14:07] amen the letter of the word being
[14:12] fulfilled is always by the spirits
[14:16] fulfilling that word
[14:22] but it's so contrary
[14:27] it's in a way that when they would hear
[14:31] it there was coming a foreign
[14:59] oh great shaking taking place
[15:10] down there at the river
[15:13] Hallelujah foreign
[15:59] sound the voice of one pride in the
[16:01] wilderness
[16:03] he was in the Fulfillment of the world
[16:18] Amen of God to fulfilled the word
[16:23] hallelujah
[16:28] we were waiting for the Messiah to come
[16:31] down to the couriers of Heaven
[16:34] amen
[16:40] and a red carpet to fly down to
[16:43] Jerusalem
[16:45] and coming to the temple according to
[16:49] the prophecies amen and all these things
[18:06] and they were all
[18:08] you know marvelous the precious words
[18:12] that came out of his mouth
[18:24] hallelujah amen
[18:27] and they wanted to throw the Bible says
[18:39] but Jesus
[18:47] there's always a fulfillment of the
[18:49] words
[18:50] amen many times
[18:53] yes fulfilling that word
[18:56] in such a way that only the elected yes
[19:03] what is taking place
[19:07] they are connected foreign
[21:06] and they were redeemable
[21:28] to become the sons of God
[21:41] if we could stop here for a moment
[21:45] if it would be possible
[21:49] the message
[21:56] but he says that when Jesus Christ
[22:31] our names were put on the lamps Book of
[22:34] Life
[22:35] Hallelujah
[23:27] Hallelujah
[24:32] he wants to wear
[24:34] Hallelujah
[24:54] foreign
[25:54] son of Jesus had something to tell them
[25:58] you're gonna tell them now now you have
[26:02] to be the light of the world now you
[26:04] have to be the salt of the earth
[26:10] amen amen no continuation
[26:22] amen the father will sin the country
[26:25] Hallelujah
[26:45] it won't be you fulfilling the words
[26:54] foreign
[27:50] put it on the whole armor of God
[27:56] 1962.
[27:57] he said the word of the Garden of Eden
[28:01] spoken word
[28:03] Satan knocked it down
[28:06] is that right all right he said that the
[28:09] word become twitch
[28:10] and they crucified
[28:13] amen
[28:15] amen and he said but now there's a
[28:18] difference in the world
[28:23] right when he said that he said oh that
[28:26] was in the
[28:28] Farms amen
[28:43] has become the words
[28:56] so the church has become the word
[28:59] from the church
[29:03] that's always
[29:09] amen because
[29:13] the reason why God has made all this
[29:16] accessible to us
[29:26] but we have the privilege
[29:30] from Genesis to revelation
[29:34] do you have that privilege
[29:37] amen right there's a reason for it
[29:41] why do we have a message in this house
[29:47] why is it
[29:51] in letter forms
[29:53] and computers
[30:02] okay
[30:42] what's his word
[30:45] amen amen amen
[30:49] you see what I'm saying
[30:51] will pass away
[30:55] amen
[30:57] but his word
[30:58] never passed away
[31:02] it's gonna remain and he's coming for
[31:06] himself
[31:15] amen

[51:27] quick but I said he got a lot of
[51:29] the Holy Spirit when it's not the spirit

[51:47] every age only got a dip foreign
[52:03] foreign
[53:11] he says two or three hour message and I
[53:15] just got started
[53:17] but it was too tremendous I don't know
[53:19] whether the people got it or not
[53:22] I hope there was some good tapes on it
[53:25] so I can so it could be carried out to
[53:27] be known
[53:30] that I believe with all the message that
[53:32] I that I have ever brought to you
[53:36] that absolute that was absolute was
[53:40] ordained of God
[53:42] the regular commission
[53:45] seals and things that was directly the
[53:49] word of God what I'm talking about a
[53:52] message to preach I believe that that
[53:55] one was it okay the one that is needed
[53:59] to follow the seals
[54:30] it's capital
[55:29] spoke to that little boy you know called
[55:32] him and told him his condition
[55:34] and pronounced his healing
[55:38] the mother's parents whatsoever was
[55:41] taking him back to the doctor and the
[55:44] doctor said he had a new set alarm
[55:50] I understand that the parents are
[55:52] somebody called the long distance call
[55:56] to let it be known to the congregation
[56:00] notice he is the Creator
[56:02] and to make a new shed alone
[56:11] this is desperation
[56:16] we're on the verge
[56:19] of one of the most mightiest things that
[56:23] ever struck the Earth since the days of
[56:26] the Lord Jesus
[56:27] but now we can we can only be known
[56:31] needles it'll be so humble what man
[56:35] calls my idea
[56:37] calls Abominations
[56:54] if you're if you're not about the tokens
[56:57] you know to examine it if you don't have
[57:02] the tokens
[57:06] Hallelujah
[57:08] if you don't have the tokens
[57:23] let me read that again
[57:39] one of the most mightiest things
[57:53] in the days of the Lord Jesus
[57:55] the fullness amen yes
[58:00] the fullness of God that we do that he
[58:03] obstructed in the days of the Lord Jesus
[58:06] Christ
[58:23] because okay in this hour in this hour
[58:27] we are living
[58:29] amen is the Fulfillment of these things
[58:32] this is what the bride is to be
[58:36] fulfilled in this house
[58:38] and tell you the truth this is what she
[58:40] is
[58:43] but you can only see it
[58:46] if you're part of it
[58:49] you can only see it if you're about to
[58:52] talk
[58:58] amen I mean everybody else all of us
[59:01] cannot see them
[59:03] because they do not have that actually
[59:08] amen amen now notice
[59:11] we begin to see then that what was in
[59:15] Jesus Christ
[59:17] all that was in God important in Christ
[59:21] we read Saint John 14 20. it was
[59:28] and the message cries it's a mystery of
[59:31] God revealed
[59:32] he says God is making himself known
[59:37] not not we're not supposed to make
[59:40] converts to Christianity by government
[59:45] but by the revelations
[59:47] Christ in you the history as God of
[59:52] yours was in Christ
[59:58] what did God what God did in Christ
