[0:15] but i like to go to church with people
[0:16] who like to have church
[0:19] some people just come to go to church
[0:22] others come to have church
[0:24] i'm glad you come to have church tonight
[0:27] as long as the lord's here that's all it
[0:30] takes
[0:31] and i appreciate this kind of an
[0:32] atmosphere
[0:34] because it's this kind of an atmosphere
[0:36] when the supernatural can be done
[0:39] signs and wonders can follow the
[0:40] believers
[0:42] god's
[0:56] when you're in the spirit
[1:09] just a little part of my testimony
[1:24] i grew up in church
[1:26] but that didn't mean i was saved
[1:29] but it wasn't until i was 13 years old
[1:32] that i personally gave my heart to the
[1:33] lord
[1:35] and it was in a little house meeting
[1:38] where there was a preacher from phoenix
[1:40] who had come to have church
[1:43] and there was not an open door for him
[1:44] to come
[1:46] so he went to a house
[1:48] and they had service there
[1:50] and i sat there
[1:51] as a young boy
[1:53] and i don't remember what he preached
[1:55] i just remember being in the living room
[1:58] and i was sitting on the couch
[2:00] by the back door
[2:02] and right next to me
[2:04] the owners of the house
[2:20] and then it would start saying amen so i
[2:22] sat next to this bird
[2:24] which was worshipped
[2:27] and i thought how the bible says
[2:29] preach the gospel to every creature
[2:32] sometimes i wish i had that bird in my
[2:34] church
[3:00] i felt the presence of the lord begin to
[3:02] deal with
[3:15] and i knew god was worth dealing with my
[3:16] heart
[3:44] and he said that's what you need
[3:46] that night i surrendered to the lord
[3:49] and i got saved
[3:50] by god's grace
[3:52] about a year after that
[3:54] i was in church one night at the home
[3:56] church
[3:58] and i had been serving the lord now
[4:00] for about a year
[4:01] a little bit a little longer
[4:04] and that night there was a i had an aunt
[4:06] who was sick in the hospital
[4:09] she had uh she was in an intensive care
[4:12] unit
[4:25] and i began to pray for my aunt
[4:28] and then as i was praying for her
[4:30] i felt the the voice of the lord
[4:33] so you need to pray for yourself
[4:35] immediately i began to repent
[4:38] i said lord for everything i've ever
[4:39] done
[4:40] my faults
[5:22] back
[5:23] speaking in tongues
[5:25] i never know what was happening
[5:28] i had never spoken before
[5:31] and i don't know how long i was there
[5:34] it might have been an hour
[5:35] maybe two hours
[6:18] and i staggered out to my grandma's
[6:20] house
[6:21] my grandma lives right behind the church
[6:24] so when i walked out the parking lot
[6:26] everybody was gone
[6:28] so i must have been there a while
[6:29] because
[6:31] you know how people hang out in the
[6:32] parking lot
[6:38] so i staggered into my grandma's house
[6:41] and my old apache grandma
[6:44] was sitting there at the table
[6:46] and she saw me staggering
[6:48] so she just raised her hands like this
[6:50] and she started praising the lord
[6:52] for filling one of her grandsons with
[6:54] the holy ghost
[6:56] well as soon as she started that
[6:58] here come the spirit of god all over
[6:59] again
[7:09] that was my first time experiencing the
[7:11] holy ghost
[7:13] and i knew god had changed my life from
[7:16] that point on
[7:17] my desires were no longer the same
[7:20] about a year later
[7:22] i was about 15 now
[7:24] a brother had called me to the front of
[7:26] the church
[7:28] and he had prayed over me and he asked
[7:30] me a question
[7:31] he said has anybody ever told you you
[7:33] had a calling in your life
[7:36] to preach the gospel
[7:37] and i said i never heard that before
[7:39] he said i see the lord has a calling for
[7:41] you
[7:57] and stay with this word of the hour
[8:00] about a year later
[8:02] now i'm 16 years old
[8:04] one of my mom's cousins
[8:10] she was he was a uh a pentecostal
[8:12] minister mr pentecostal and he had heard
[8:15] about testimony
[8:17] so he had asked me to come preach for
[8:18] him
[8:19] he said i want i want to give you one
[8:20] night to the young people
[8:23] and he said come and preach for me
[8:40] which was near phoenix arizona
[8:42] arizona and i preached this night
[8:44] and it was an outside meeting of course
[8:47] and the sides of the tent were up
[8:51] and so i got my bible and i had all my
[8:54] notes
[8:55] and i was so nervous
[8:57] i wrote down every word i was going to
[8:59] say
[9:00] every single word
[9:02] hello my name is
[9:05] god bless you
[10:30] i said lord thank you for confirming
[10:32] your words
[10:33] at that moment
[10:34] god taught me a very important lesson
[10:37] he taught me i have nothing to do with
[10:39] it
[10:40] my words have failed
[10:42] but he'll never fail
[10:44] as long as i
[11:12] and bring souls to christ
[11:14] amen
[11:15] praise the lord
[11:17] so that's when i preached my first
[11:19] sermon
[11:21] and uh it wasn't too much longer after
[11:24] that
[11:27] i was 17.
[11:28] that was just a month away from turning
[11:30] 18.
[11:33] when the pastor before me
[11:35] had resigned the church
[11:38] and went to do his own thing
[12:07] until god brings one up raises
[12:36] so that's kind of how my fire got lit
[12:39] and i certainly appreciate it
[12:41] the warm invitation
[12:45] i'm glad to be among the part of the
[12:46] bride of jesus christ
[12:49] and to bring our licks of fire together
[13:04] i certainly believe
[13:17] and i certainly thank the lord
[13:20] uh bringing us here safely to san diego
[13:24] it was about a seven hour drive
[13:26] but we're happy to be here
[13:29] so now as we look to the word of god
[13:31] we're reading about warfare
[13:34] and i want to preach to you tonight
[13:37] by the help of the lord
[13:38] about spiritual warfare
[13:41] how many knows we're in a we're in a
[13:43] battle
[13:45] how many knows that brother brown said
[13:46] we're not on a
[14:00] we're
[14:28] that the enemy
[15:37] no matter how hopeless
[15:45] through jesus christ
[16:20] praise god we got to be prepared
[16:23] just like the children of israel
[16:25] they were prepared
[16:27] joshua
[16:28] let's read it again
[16:31] that the priests took the ark
[16:34] stood in
[17:30] what moses
[17:43] and now the time has come that the
[17:46] spirit is coming to us can you take that
[17:48] word
[17:49] and manifest it
[17:51] because that word
[17:52] needs to be brought to pass
[17:54] this world
[17:56] be fulfilled
[17:57] what moses had said
[18:11] how dark
[18:25] is
[19:08] by
[19:21] he always vindicates his word
[19:24] he always speaks his wife
[19:26] where the word is
[19:28] if the word is here
[19:30] will come
[19:32] hallelujah
[19:33] there was john
[19:35] and here come jesus
[19:50] he said john
[20:18] right
[21:15] i just got to believe
[21:17] god will take care of the interpreter
[21:19] because the bible says
[21:21] no scripture
[21:23] of the word
[21:24] of any private interpretation
[21:28] god is his own interpreter
[21:42] and god will bring you to pass when that
[21:44] word is brought to pass
[21:46] in your life
[21:54] which is the interpretation
[21:56] of the scripture
[22:02] amen i mean so i'm not going to try to
[22:04] figure anything out i'm just going to
[22:05] believe it
[22:08] that's all i got to do is just believe
[22:09] it
[22:10] i like there's
[22:24] the simple
[22:45] it says it came to pass
[22:47] when the people were acclaimed passover
[22:49] that the ark of the lord passed over in
[22:50] the priests in the presence of the
[22:53] children of israel
[23:01] the ark
[23:02] and the priests
[23:04] in the presence of the people
[23:15] half the tribe of manasseh
[23:17] all passed over
[23:19] and the bible says they were armed
[23:48] but they knew
[24:02] over the plains of jericho
[24:04] to claim their promises
[24:07] so to go and
[24:08] take what god has promised to give them
[24:12] in verse 12
[24:13] it said that they went according to
[24:15] moses had spoke to them
[24:44] it reminds
[25:11] the one who made the covenant
[25:26] 40 000 they were prepared
[25:29] they were ready
[25:31] they're prepared for battle
[25:33] prepared for war
[25:34] and when you go to chapter five
[25:38] i love this scripture here
[25:39] because it tells us that fear had came
[25:43] upon their enemy
[25:47] the supernatural began to be done among
[25:50] the people
[25:53] the god of israel
[26:08] and so people begin to talk
[26:11] and say hey have you heard
[26:13] there's a little church down there
[26:15] in a little storefront
[26:17] and they're just a little humble people
[26:18] there
[26:19] but man something's going on over there
[26:22] people in the streets are feeling it
[26:24] they're walking they're buying liquor i
[26:26] mean they call the presence of god
[26:29] they're getting saved on the streets
[26:31] they're sick of being healed
[26:33] or being delivered
[26:35] possessed are being set free
[26:49] that's exactly what happened
[26:57] praise god
[26:58] there's one thing that i love and that's
[27:00] to make the enemy nervous
[27:04] amen just think about it
[27:08] how many times has it made you nervous
[27:11] how many times has he stayed kept you up
[27:13] all night
[27:15] with pains
[28:14] but in
[28:42] to go in and to serve him an eviction
[28:46] notice
[28:48] diablo you squatted here long enough
[28:52] i have rights
[28:54] as a son in a diary
[30:45] jesus christ
[31:00] oh lord i wish you'd give me the victory
[31:14] now
[31:16] becky the the enemy had heard
[31:19] what was going on
[31:21] and they became they got afraid
[31:23] the spirit wasn't in them anymore
[31:26] and their heart melted
[31:28] they said hey
[31:30] haven't you heard you know either those
[31:32] people down there
[31:34] you know that group down there
[31:36] that one we didn't really know about it
[31:39] we laughed to make fun of these years
[31:42] there's something going on with those
[31:43] guys
[31:58] i believe
[32:11] is
[32:54] the gates
[33:08] and we
[33:23] then you'll leave out of here
[33:25] no matter what devil is ready
[33:27] i'm ready to face them all
[33:30] because greater is he that is in you
[33:33] you know brother ben says
[33:35] the message is victory day
[33:37] 1963
[33:40] he says but you know
[33:42] all along there's been all kinds of
[33:45] battles fought
[33:48] there's also been god's believing
[34:04] just as on the natural side
[34:06] in the natural world
[34:08] so is it uh in the word
[34:10] with the scriptures
[34:12] we've had many great battles against our
[34:14] enemy
[34:15] and god has had great men out there
[34:18] standing
[34:31] and we fight it every day
[34:35] this great battle
[34:36] spiritual battle
[34:38] prophet says
[34:39] we fight it every day
[34:41] every christian fights a battle every
[34:43] day
[34:45] are you christian
[34:46] probably god
[35:00] you
[35:29] bowed to the world
[35:31] shall we give up to the thought that
[35:33] we've got
[35:35] and what if we see the focus
[35:37] how god takes it from genesis to
[35:39] revelation
[35:40] thus save the lord each time
[36:10] and we find there's
[36:39] without a positive confession
[36:41] there is no victory
[36:43] so no matter how bad you feel
[36:45] you can't go by feelings
[36:47] what is the word of your testimony
[36:50] that's why the bible says
[36:52] the power
[37:06] even jesus
[37:20] you gotta receive
[37:33] we
[37:34] get stuck looking at the trials
[37:38] or the circumstances all around us
[37:41] how bad it looks
[37:43] how people are against me
[37:45] no i don't feel very good
[37:47] if we focus on that
[38:02] who the prophet says he believed
[38:05] what the word said he was okay
[38:07] he'd look to the world
[38:09] found his place
[38:11] in the scriptures
[38:12] and said this day
[38:14] this word has completely
[38:30] and i
[38:44] the
[38:58] no baptism in the name of jesus jesus he
[39:00] said uh we gotta focus right back to the
[39:03] word
[39:04] and nobody can say it's not there
[39:07] so we are in a warfare
[39:10] and god's heroes
[39:27] but look how he includes a little church
[39:30] he said you little church
[39:32] remember back here
[39:34] you are a part of that unit
[39:37] you are a part of the kingdom of god
[39:39] even if you're just a small part it's
[39:41] enough you're still a part of it
[39:44] even if you're just a little toe
[39:46] you're still a part of the body
[39:49] god's body
[39:50] is the most powerful body
[40:22] of a shadow
[40:34] just a little shadow
[41:04] when god looks at us
[41:47] so your little church you are a part of
[41:50] that unit
[41:54] he says here that you are an outpost
[41:57] back here
[41:59] so brother sister we got to stay true to
[42:01] our post of duty right
[42:03] amen
[42:04] because when you come to church and you
[42:06] serve god
[42:08] you're not doing it for the pastor
[42:10] you're doing it for jesus christ
[42:12] when you are faithful
[42:27] you're an outpost back here
[42:42] or the baptist
[42:55] he is the chief captain of
[43:09] and you turn around and do something
[43:10] better
[43:25] orders
[43:26] you gotta stay with the word
[43:28] i know people
[43:29] take some of these promises
[43:31] and they try to uh uh manufacture
[43:34] something
[43:35] they try to bring it on themselves
[43:38] but that's not
[43:51] is
[44:49] here becky once again brother said the
[44:51] same message
[44:54] we've had many great battles
[44:56] spiritual battles
[44:58] many great v-days
[45:00] which is victory days
[45:16] against an evil spirit maybe it was in
[45:18] your body
[45:20] maybe it was in your children
[45:21] in your home in your neighborhood
[45:25] you came up against the spirit
[45:27] or in opposition of the enemy
[45:30] by god
[45:44] god has brought
[46:12] when she
[46:37] and the whole blood of men upon the
[46:38] earth
[46:40] all the sin in the
[46:54] he cleans
[47:37] amen i mean you believe that okay now
[47:39] watch here becky as a prophet of god
[47:41] says
[47:42] that we've had many battles
[47:46] great victories as well
[47:49] when we think about the battle that is
[47:50] raging
[48:04] and those two
[48:18] and then in another
[48:59] that's how god fortifies you is by the
[49:02] spirit of god
[49:04] to keep you on the straight and now
[49:08] they're constantly pulled
[49:10] out by these two forces
[49:12] and whatever side
[49:14] you yield
[49:28] rather than the
[50:10] demon possession
[50:37] that is influencing us
[50:51] word of god
[51:21] david says
[51:23] he teaches my hands to war
[51:26] teaches my fingers to fight
[51:28] because god
[51:30] he doesn't just throw us in the world
[51:32] say here figure out yourself
[52:16] he knows your limits so brother bram
[52:18] says he said
[52:19] if god leads you in the battle
[52:21] he's got his confidence in you
[52:23] let me tell you god has confidence in
[52:25] this right
[52:26] he has confidence in this little bride
[52:28] no matter what god leads you up against
[52:58] let's go just a little bit further
[53:01] now notice bro
[53:07] but today
[53:08] people have substituted
[53:11] something else
[53:26] where there's one church or you got to
[53:28] submit an application for membership
[53:33] don't get me wrong
[53:36] according to them
[53:37] they welcome visitors
[53:40] but you can only visit for so many times
[53:43] then you got to submit an application
[53:45] then it's got to go before the board
[53:48] be reviewed
[53:50] i choose to accept you
[53:52] you've got to sign a contract
[53:54] i'm not making
[54:36] the old
[54:37] birth
[54:38] cement
[54:40] which is what births you into the
[54:41] kingdom of god
[54:44] and they've turned to institutions of
[54:46] men
[54:47] but look what the prophet says
[54:49] he says
[55:04] he chose not to stay with the word
[55:07] so the devil gave her his word
[55:10] and that's how the first bride fell yes
[55:13] and you gotta you gotta be careful
[55:15] that you stay with god's word
[55:17] and you gotta believe his word
[55:46] to
[56:15] roll up behind
[56:16] the opponent
[56:17] that's the truth
[56:19] and they can jump shout out to
[56:20] cartwheels down the aisle
[56:23] and make it seem like it's true
[56:26] but when you test it with the word
[56:28] it
[56:42] amen amen so we got to understand
[56:46] i like how one preacher said
[56:48] the people's reaction
[56:50] to the preaching
[56:52] doesn't always mean conversion
[56:55] come on now
[56:56] amen amen even politicians know that
[57:00] i personally know politicians
[57:03] who are very charismatic
[57:06] and they can
[57:08] talk in such a way
[57:10] people want to listen
[57:33] adolf hitler adolf hitler a very
[57:35] charismatic speaker
[57:38] was such
[58:15] amen
[58:16] so now getting back to this
[58:19] brother says they have substituted
[58:21] something else
[58:23] and uh the best way
[58:26] god could ever protect his army
[58:29] fortify his army
[58:34] and they got away
[58:44] if he can get you separated
[58:47] from your source of strength
[58:50] and isolate you alone
[58:53] you're an easier target
[58:55] this is why
[58:57] people start getting called on the lord
[59:00] what's the first thing they do
[59:02] they stop
[59:16] well
[59:45] get him out alone
[59:47] isolate him from the past
[59:49] from the church
[59:50] so he can have easy access to the
[59:52] facility so we have to understand that
[59:55] we can't take the devil's substitutions
[59:57] we can't take the things of the world
[1:00:10] at the beginning he gave us the very
[1:00:12] best
[1:00:25] is the best and only
[1:00:40] to get
[1:01:22] holy ghost experience that he can get
[1:01:24] you out alone
[1:01:26] become an easy target
[1:01:27] so we got to stay fast
[1:01:30] in the word of god
[1:01:31] and be in the holy spirit
[1:01:34] and among the brothers of sisters of
[1:01:36] christ
[1:01:46] hallelujah
[1:01:48] now
[1:01:49] and we're living in the day
[1:02:04] and more
[1:03:00] he was

[1:05:57] there is a people
[1:06:01] ready to fight
[1:06:02] they're not going
[1:06:49] is
[1:07:11] but there's still some in the lab
[1:07:14] there's still somebody somewhere
[1:07:16] i don't believe god's word
[1:07:19] who will not compromise
[1:07:21] that will stay true
[1:07:22] and fight to the end
[1:07:24] of the weapons of our warfare
[1:07:39] like the bible says
[1:07:54] some spiritual
[1:08:08] every
[1:08:22] they'll take god
[1:08:51] got one of the greatest anointings that
[1:08:53] any man has ever known we are the
[1:08:56] products
[1:08:58] messages
[1:09:17] is

[1:10:06] we're living in a great time of
[1:10:08] deception
[1:10:09] a great time of evil
[1:10:12] but it's also a great time
[1:10:27] because they can feel the atmosphere
[1:10:30] they know something's happening
[1:10:32] they know we're living in the last
[1:10:33] seconds
[1:10:35] even the catholics
[1:10:37] that's why when the pope came to new
[1:10:38] york
[1:10:39] he addressed the cardinals
[1:10:42] he made a statement
[1:10:56] he only knew what
[1:11:24] god is
[1:11:48] that's god's blue presence
[1:12:20] it's
[1:12:26] of the world

[1:12:48] pentecost really was
[1:12:52] oh brother sister
[1:12:54] wasn't that what elijah's message was
[1:12:55] about
[1:12:57] turn the heart of the children
[1:12:59] to the pentecostal prophet
[1:13:01] and restore the faith
[1:13:30] where are you
[1:13:44] identification
[1:13:57] final climax
[1:14:12] no matter what the
[1:14:21] by the grace of god

[1:17:40] you ought to do something
[1:17:42] speak
[1:17:57] more powerful
[1:17:59] but even if you have just a little
[1:18:00] portion of god
[1:18:01] that's all the power you need
[1:18:03] hey man
