[1:00:23] glory
[1:00:28] amen amen as we said this
[1:00:32] morning chapter 36 and
[1:00:35] 37 Ezekiel is in the same
[1:00:39] vision the chapters are just put
[1:00:42] there by the ones that formed the
[1:00:44] Bible but
[1:00:47] originally it is One Vision in
[1:00:51] itself and we know that one Vision can
[1:00:54] have more more than one part to
[1:00:57] it as brother bram's
[1:01:00] Visions many of
[1:01:04] them like the third pool
[1:01:07] Vision it had different
[1:01:09] parts and it was one
[1:01:12] vision and in this vision of
[1:01:15] Ezekiel he is in one
[1:01:17] Vision that is speaking of the same
[1:01:20] thing but is is giving him different
[1:01:23] parts to the
[1:01:26] Vision in this Ezekiel
[1:01:29] 36 as we seen this morning what he was
[1:01:33] prophesying
[1:01:35] of then when we go to chapter
[1:01:38] 37 we find that he finds
[1:01:41] himself in the valley of dry
[1:01:45] bones and then there is a
[1:01:48] process of
[1:01:50] restoration to bring them to their
[1:01:52] original condition
[1:01:55] and then in verse
[1:01:56] 11 he he is explaining the
[1:02:00] vision God explains to him the vision
[1:02:03] then he said unto me son of man these
[1:02:04] bones are the whole house of Israel all
[1:02:07] they are the bones are dead and our hope
[1:02:09] is lost and we are cut off from our
[1:02:23] parts
[1:02:25] see it's it's in connection with chapter
[1:02:28] 36 this is what I want to point
[1:02:32] out therefore prophesy and say unto them
[1:02:35] thus say the Lord God behold oh my
[1:02:37] people I will open your Graves and cause
[1:02:39] you to come out of your Graves and bring
[1:02:41] you into the land of
[1:02:52] Israel so you see see that in chapter
[1:02:56] 36 he said I will bring you out of the
[1:02:59] lands of the
[1:03:01] heathens into your own
[1:03:04] land amen amen chapter 37 he's saying
[1:03:07] the same
[1:03:09] thing amen but he's given it in another
[1:03:12] symbol that they were like dry bones in
[1:03:19] Graves amen amen and God is going to
[1:03:21] bring a resurrection power to bring them
[1:03:25] out of the
[1:03:26] graves and make a mighty marching
[1:03:29] Army to bring them back to their land
[1:03:33] Israel amen now watch verse 13 and you
[1:03:37] shall know that I am the Lord when I
[1:03:39] have opened your Graves oh my people and
[1:03:41] brought you out out of your
[1:03:48] Graves did you verse did you notice in
[1:03:50] verse
[1:03:51] 12 he said he was going to bring them
[1:03:53] out of of the the
[1:03:55] graves and bring them into the land of
[1:03:58] Israel brother said
[1:04:01] Redemption is in two parts is to bring
[1:04:04] you
[1:04:04] out and to bring you
[1:04:07] into amen amen and then he says in verse
[1:04:12] 14 and shall put my spirit in you and
[1:04:16] you shall live and I shall place you in
[1:04:19] your own land then shall you know that I
[1:04:21] the Lord have spoken it and performed it
[1:04:26] say the
[1:04:33] Lord you see how it's in connection with
[1:04:36] chapter
[1:04:38] 36 because he says in chapter
[1:04:41] 36 I'll bring you out of the out of the
[1:04:44] lands of the
[1:04:46] heathens out of all the countries and I
[1:04:49] will sprinkle clean
[1:04:51] water which is the word
[1:04:55] prophecy amen amen and they will be
[1:04:59] clean and that give you a new heart a
[1:05:02] new spirit and I will put my
[1:05:06] spirit in you it's the same it's the
[1:05:09] same vision but this
[1:05:14] symbols amen how many know that the
[1:05:16] Bible is full of
[1:05:18] symbols and the Book of
[1:05:20] Revelations reveals the
[1:05:23] symbols Revelation book of
[1:05:26] symbols amen it is being given by an
[1:05:31] Angel the
[1:05:33] interpretations of the symbols glory to
[1:05:36] God and that is the angel that we have
[1:05:40] received the seventh
[1:05:42] one now
[1:05:44] notice brother Bram in speaking of of
[1:05:48] this
[1:05:50] scripture Ezekiel
[1:05:52] 36 verse
[1:05:54] 26 he says this and this is where we
[1:05:58] want to pick it
[1:05:59] up everybody say praise the
[1:06:03] Lord amen amen want to make
[1:06:07] sure that that that we
[1:06:10] know amen that this word cannot fail and
[1:06:16] if whatever need you might have whatever
[1:06:19] situation it might
[1:06:21] be be assured that this word can can
[1:06:26] bring to
[1:06:28] pass and
[1:06:30] fulfill anything that you have need of
[1:06:34] and as the word is going forth no matter
[1:06:36] what it is the word has
[1:06:39] power now he says in Ezekiel
[1:06:43] 36 uh verse
[1:06:46] 26 brother ROM says watch the Bible he
[1:06:51] says he will take the old Stony heart
[1:06:53] away
[1:06:55] and give you a heart of Flesh then I'll
[1:06:58] give you a new spirit and put my spirit
[1:07:01] in you now his
[1:07:03] spirit is different from your new
[1:07:08] spirit how many people gets the new
[1:07:12] spirit and they think they get the Holy
[1:07:16] Spirit they get feeling happy they jump
[1:07:20] around maybe do a few things religiously
[1:07:24] and they think that they got the Holy
[1:07:27] Spirit oh no the holy spirit makes you
[1:07:30] act
[1:07:31] different the holy spirit makes you
[1:07:34] think
[1:07:36] different the Holy Spirit was put right
[1:07:39] in the
[1:07:41] middle of your new spirit and your new
[1:07:45] spirit was put right in the middle of
[1:07:49] your new heart and the new heart and the
[1:07:53] new spirit

[1:21:45] middle of the
[1:21:48] watch it

[1:23:16] emotion brother bam tells us what the
[1:23:19] evidence
[1:23:21] is Amen brother

[1:23:28] we're still in Ezekiel
[1:23:31] 36 but now brother Bram is bringing this
[1:23:33] Vision to us
[1:23:35] why because Ezekiel Saw this
[1:23:38] Vision glory to God what
[1:23:41] Vision the vision where God was going to
[1:23:45] make his
[1:23:46] clock to function
[1:23:50] right because he had tried to get this
[1:23:53] clock to work for a long
[1:23:55] time amen amen hallelujah but he he they
[1:23:58] they couldn't give the right
[1:24:00] time amen they couldn't give the right
[1:24:05] time amen amen but he the the master
[1:24:14] Watchman amen he knows all the parts he
[1:24:18] knows how to put it
[1:24:20] together amen am he knows what function
[1:24:23] each thing
[1:24:25] has he says
[1:24:27] this I'm saying this because if the holy
[1:24:32] spirit is in the middle of your
[1:24:35] spirit that watch
[1:24:38] spring makes all the rest of the
[1:24:40] movements take exactly to the
[1:24:43] place keeping perfect time when the Holy
[1:24:47] Spirit is in the middle of your spirit
[1:24:50] listen to this it makes
[1:24:52] every
[1:24:54] action of the holy spirit in you take
[1:24:59] off J
[1:25:02] exactly according to God's time
[1:25:06] piece the
[1:25:08] Bible amen
[1:25:11] hallelujah according to God's time
[1:25:13] piece the Bible he says right watch the
[1:25:18] order of the scripture I will take away
[1:25:21] the Stony heart
[1:25:23] give you a new a new heart and the Heart
[1:25:27] Is The Dwelling Place of the Holy Spirit
[1:25:31] and I will give you a new spirit I want
[1:25:34] you to watch the
[1:25:35] order how many people get mixed
[1:25:38] up they got and they think they got the
[1:25:41] Holy
[1:25:43] Ghost but when they only got a new
[1:25:46] spirit I'll give you a new spirit then
[1:25:50] I'll put my spirit but there is a new
[1:25:53] spirit that God gave you so that you
[1:25:58] could get along with the Holy
[1:26:02] Ghost because with the old Spirit you
[1:26:06] could get along with your
[1:26:09] neighbor you couldn't get along even
[1:26:11] with your own
[1:26:13] self so he has to give you a new spirit
[1:26:17] so that you can get along with
[1:26:20] God and God gives you a new
[1:26:23] spirit many times under
[1:26:27] enthusiasm if you'll Watch The Life I

[1:26:38] you have the Holy
[1:26:40] Ghost oh you said I
[1:26:43] sung I spoke in tongues certainly being
[1:26:47] that close to it you might do all of
[1:26:50] that but it is isn't the holy spirit
[1:26:54] yet the Holy Spirit Bears
[1:26:57] record of Jesus
[1:27:00] Christ and he taken what did he do he
[1:27:04] give you a new heart he give you a new
[1:27:06] spirit that he puts his
[1:27:09] spirit in you you don't have to go
[1:27:12] around and pretend that you're a
[1:27:15] Christian the new spirit brings new life
[1:27:20] and the Holy Spirit
[1:27:23] in your new spirit in your
[1:27:27] heart see and the Holy Spirit goes to
[1:27:31] the center of it he says here in another
[1:27:35] message what does it take to make a

[1:28:28] mainspring it is the
[1:28:30] will in the middle of the
[1:28:33] wheel as Ezekiel said amen hallelujah

[1:28:52] of a flash of

[1:29:04] behold one will upon the Earth by the
[1:29:06] living creatures with his four
[1:29:15] faces the appearance of the wheels and
[1:29:18] their work was like unto the color of

[1:31:10] voices and brother Bram says it is those
[1:31:14] seven
[1:31:15] Thunders that
[1:31:17] literally inside of the
[1:31:20] heart something is it's literally taking
[1:31:23] place it's not
[1:31:26] spiritual it's not all I think that's

[1:32:00] literally turn the hearts of the
[1:32:03] children back to the faith of the

[1:32:10] seven

[1:32:44] 16 brother Bram comes up to the
[1:32:48] pulpit amen amen and says I was thinking
[1:32:52] here one little
[1:32:54] illustration to back up what he
[1:32:57] said now look at this
[1:33:00] watch
[1:33:02] Hallelujah to find out what time it
[1:33:05] is unless that every
[1:33:09] instrument in that watch is
[1:33:13] coordinating with one with the other
[1:33:16] you'll never know the correct
[1:33:19] time is that right amen and that takes
[1:33:23] all of
[1:33:25] us together if we want to
[1:33:29] see the third
[1:33:31] pool really do something for
[1:33:35] God it's

[1:33:56] things brother sister now he's
[1:34:01] connecting this watch and these pieces

[1:34:42] hallelujah but it takes
[1:34:45] coordination it takes the
[1:34:47] wheel in the middle of the wheel how
[1:34:51] many know that brother Bram connected
[1:34:54] the seven seal with the seven Thunders
[1:34:58] and he connected the third pool right in
[1:35:02] there he said the angel told me years
[1:35:06] ago amen amen I will meet you in there

[1:38:40] time inside of him see it's happening in
[1:38:47] hereu but he is taking that clock as a
[1:38:50] symbol
[1:38:52] in here amen his ministry had changed

[1:40:28] darkness he sent the Bible to for tell
[1:40:32] us the events before they happened and
[1:40:37] nature and time would
[1:40:41] come it's something like looking on a
[1:40:45] calendar to see what date it
[1:40:48] is if you if if you say this is Saturday
[1:40:53] or Sunday what is it look at the
[1:40:56] calendar the calendar will tell you what
[1:40:58] day it
[1:40:59] is when when you see the
[1:41:03] action of the people maybe going to
[1:41:06] church maybe you hear the bells
[1:41:09] ringing you wonder what day it
[1:41:11] is look on the calendar it'll tell you
[1:41:14] what day it is and when you see the
[1:41:18] church getting worldly
[1:41:22] like it was in the days of
[1:41:24] Sodom you see what time it
[1:41:29] is the God of this evil
[1:41:32] age and then seeing a little minority
[1:41:36] group gathered under the inspiration
[1:41:41] of producing again the life of Jesus
[1:41:45] Christ by the scriptures that is what's
[1:41:48] supposed to happen then you know what
[1:41:52] hour we're living
[1:41:55] in amen hallelujah he says again in
[1:41:59] modern events made clear by prophecy San
[1:42:04] berardo Berard the Bible is a book of
[1:42:07] Prophecy it tells what time we're living
[1:42:10] in what kind of events ought to take
[1:42:13] place exactly to the letter for tells it
[1:42:17] it has never missed one age
[1:42:21] not one time has it ever missed it is
[1:42:24] perfect all the time and only those who
[1:42:29] are predestinated to see
[1:42:32] it will see it they AB they and they was
[1:42:36] absolutely contrary to God's
[1:42:39] will there was a prophet in the land
[1:42:42] amen trying to do God a service without
[1:42:45] being his will he didn't know the time
[1:42:49] amen amen see it wasn't thinking
[1:42:53] right he was doing the
[1:42:55] Motions he he was doing
[1:42:57] everything you did you know that that's
[1:43:00] not what God was
[1:43:02] against amen a lot of people in the
[1:43:04] message misinterpret
[1:43:07] that amen the dancing wasn't
[1:43:10] wrong in David's trying to do God a
[1:43:14] service that wasn't the part that was
[1:43:19] wrong amen the
[1:43:21] instruments and the
[1:43:23] playing and the worship all of that was
[1:43:28] okay but what was wrong is that he did
[1:43:31] not consult the
[1:43:34] prophet amen that was trying to do God a
[1:43:38] service without being his will and in
[1:43:41] this hour there's a lot of churches
[1:43:44] there's a lot of ministers there's a lot
[1:43:47] of Ley not Consulting the prophet
[1:43:51] amen and they're trying to serve God

[1:43:57] not giving the exact
[1:44:00] time the the
[1:44:02] wheels are they're crashing together
[1:44:05] it's not
[1:44:07] working but when the wheel is in the
[1:44:11] middle of the wheel and his spirit is in
[1:44:14] you brother you will consult the prophet
[1:44:18] you go to the message and it will be it
[1:44:21] will begin to
[1:44:22] move all the pieces working together
[1:44:27] giving the right time Glory then you'll
[1:44:31] know what time we're in what hour it is
[1:44:36] what I have to do

[1:44:43] that
[1:44:44] right brother bam says
[1:44:48] here for the newcomers
[1:44:52] this is the message voice of the sign
[1:44:55] for the
[1:44:56] newcomers this week we have tried to
[1:44:59] show that God from the beginning know
[1:45:04] the end that makes him infinite and if
[1:45:07] he isn't
[1:45:08] infinite then he isn't God he's got to
[1:45:12] be
[1:45:13] omnipotent
[1:45:15] omes
[1:45:17] omn omnipotent to be God that's all
[1:45:21] power knows all
[1:45:23] things if he doesn't then he isn't God
[1:45:26] so with him there's nothing really out
[1:45:29] of

[1:47:16] days of
[1:47:19] Jesus the disciples came to Jesus and
[1:47:22] said all the scribes
[1:47:25] say that Elias must first
[1:47:28] come even they missed the
[1:47:32] time because they because they didn't
[1:47:35] have the main
[1:47:37] spring inside
