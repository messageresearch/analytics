  260           A woman just called up another woman and said, "You know, I'm Episcopalian," said, "I--I--I spoke in tongues the other day; I believe I received the Holy Ghost, but sh, don't tell nobody." I doubt that very much. You might've spoke with tongues; but you set a man on fire, how is he going to set still? Yes, sir. They can't do it.
Could you imagine Peter, and James, and John, and them up in the upper room saying, "Oh, we got the Holy Ghost now, but maybe we better keep still." Brother, through windows, doors and everything they went out into the street, acting like a bunch of drunks. That's the real Holy Ghost.

  107           They had to leave the old haunts of life, or something like that, and--and cross over into a new land, with a new people that you never knew before. Is that what you done, you become a Christian? You left the pool room, you left the night clubs. You had to come over into a bunch of people that looked like had spasms, they quivered and shook and cried, and shook their head and jumped up-and-down, and, why--why, it was a--it was a--a--a "crazy bunch" to you. So you had to make a decision whether you would go or not. That's right. And you knowed that when you did, your own people was going to make fun of you, the ones you had left. Is that right? That's just automatically. You just... they ought to expect that to begin with, 'cause that's the way it is.
