TRANSCRIPT
========================================
in a supernatural form but it is a lean spirit that would want somebody else get the Revelation and wait for it to come in the future because they're too lazy for themselves to search in the message and see what really is already revealed it all comes down to that brother Ram said in Feast of the trumpets that the bride in order to know her husband must be constantly in the word of God amenu and if you caught the reason why the Holy Spirit has been exhorting the church and the last messages that we have been bringing it has all been in the same line of thought because of the condition that we see in the local church amenu and we see then that these different things is to put us in line with the word of God amen amen this is the reason why that when entering to this subject I wanted to give a little introduction I wanted to give you the purpose behind why we're entering into this subject and that you might begin to understand and see that we're not just getting into the subject just to know what it is there is a purpose behind it amen and brother brandham said in the introduction to the seven Church Ages which is in the exposition he is speaking of the reason or the introduction of why it's necessary to study and detailed study of the seven Church ages is necessary Amen in order to study and understand the rest of the Revelation he says because out of the sea out of the Ages come the seals and out of the seals come the trumpets and out of the trumpets come the vials like the first verse of a Roman Candle the seven Church Ages come forth with a mighty initial illumination without which there can be no further light but once the Brilliance of the seven Church ages is given by divine revelation then light upon light follows that until the whole of the Revelation open opens wide before our wondering eyes and we are edified and purified by its spirit and we are made ready for his glorious Superior even our Lord and savior the one and true God Jesus Christ amen amen hallelujah so this is the introduction brother ad is giving for the seven Church ages you understand what is the purpose for it to edify to purify by the spirit of God the church to be made ready for the Glorious appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ when we look into the message many people in a carnal mind or trying to interpreted by something that they can see with their natural eye they are looking for brother Braham to come out plainly and say this is what it is and it's not like that brothers and sisters I do say that there's many things in the message that he did come out out plainly and said this is what it is amen but there's many things in the message many truths many Revelations that are in the message that he did not come plainly out and say it but he pointed us to certain scriptures he pointed us to certain types he pointed us to certain revelation that the True Believer the Bride of Jesus Christ could take these messages could take these tapes and by divine revelation catch amen the mystery of what is within that and then you yourself as a believer that have a commandment to search the scriptures to search the message to look into the these things amen and shake off our l ly in spirit and really get into the word and really get into the message that God has given us then we would be able to dovetail all the scriptures all of the Bible with what certain key points that brother bam gave and that's why when we begin to talk and we begin to preach and we begin to maybe you too as as a Believer you begin to share many Revelations that you have received in the message the carnal believer knows not what you're talking about they don't even know if that came from the message or you're just making it up and they don't even know what the first part of what you're saying because it shows that they're not in the spirit of Revelation for the hour this message did not come to make us intellectual people this message is only for a prophetic class of people that already have the capacity inside of that Gene to receive the Revelation that is contained in this message it's not that we're trying to work ourselves up to know these things is that we're predestinated with the capacity to receive this Revelation by the grace of God Amen but it it takes some dedication it takes interest it takes disconnecting yourself from the things of the world and really getting into the to the message of God amen amen this is the reason why the church in that condition will never be able to understand the truths that are laying within the message rapturing faith is laying in the message the revelation of the of the vows is laying in the message the seven Thunders is in the message of God the new name of God is in the message Hallelujah all of these Revelations are laying right there but it takes the Holy Spirit to reveal that to your soul because Satan cannot know this it can't be said out plainly for him to hear what it is but it's only given to his seed it's only given to the children of God by Supernatural Revelation Hallelujah and if we the bride of Jesus Christ are living under the seven seal and we're receiving the mystery we're part of that mystery and we're being caught up in the mystery in the seventh seal that it is for you and me Hallelujah to receive Hallelujah these Divine truths Hallelujah people think amen that their hearts are being turned back to the faith of the fathers just by knowing amen that this message is true or that God sent a prophet yes God sent a prophet yes he sent Malachi for to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers but what is it what is going to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers what's going to do it is the supernatural Revelation that is in this message amen that's exactly what the prophet said he said that this messenger of the Le Church age was going to do two things he was going to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers and the second thing that he was going to do he was going to reveal the mysteries of the seven Thunders which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals and it will be these divinely revealed I want you to notice that how is it going to be it has to be divine revelation amen what kind of Revelation Divine that means it's not by human instrumentality that means is not by learning that means it's not amen by by uh uh uh your intellectual understanding hallelujah it's not by phonics is that right amen amen it's divinely reveal mystery truths that will literally turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers do you understand Mal will not be fulfilled if the people are not receiving divinely revealed mystery truths I don't care what they say what they testify what they claim their hearts are still in the same sinful condition if they have not not received Dively revealed mystery truths Hallelujah faith is revelation and it's impossible to please God without Revelation amen hallelujah hallelujah amen hallelujah so brother and sister I want you to understand the reason the purpose the burden amen the desperation of why we look into these things amen is for to fulfill in US exactly what this word was to fulfill do you understand he says it aan Church age the exposition of the church ages he says I have to hold to the word the way the Lord revealed [Music] it I did not cover it all this is the prophet telling you and me I haven't covered everything in other words I haven't gone through every verse in every chapter of the Bible see I haven't done that that's what the prophet is telling us can you say amen hallelujah hallelujah did he preach on every character in The Bible no he didn't did he did he preach from every chapter of the Bible no did he preach from every book in the Bible no no you don't find that in the message but how come we have the revelation of the whole Bible hu because there's a supernatural Revelation listen what he says this is the prophet telling you and me I did not cover it all amen amen that would take a separate book in other words he would have to write another Bible amen amen and that would be against the word itself amen but by the help of the [Music] Lord we will get many sermons and tapes and messages on all these points to help you understand and dovea all scripture amen hallelujah points see points key key points in the messages in the tapes in the sermons do you understand say Amen am I know you can say Amen in your heart but I like to hear it out loud amen amen well I don't have to say it out loud well brother R said the evidence of the Holy Ghost is for you to say it am amen so notice how many understand what we're saying amen he didn't cover it all but there's going to be tapes messages on all these points to help you understand and Dil all scripture hallelujah amen amen in the Feast of the trumpets he says let me say this right here every trumpet talking about the seven trumpets how many know that there's only one place in the Book of Revelation that these seven trumpets sound in other words there's not two places where there is a succession of seven Trumpets the seven trumpets begin in the eighth chapter of Revelation goes to the ninth chapter and then there is an interval or breach chapter 10 and then in chapter 11 you have the seventh trumpet amen amen now listen to what brother Bram says every Trum Lo under the Sixth Seal amen he says it again all the trumpets sounded under the Sixth Seal Hallelujah and he says the trumpet is to call together the people assemble themselves gathering together for something amen amen then he says what was the what was the trumpet Revelations 87 did we read that tonight says Revelations 87 we noticed the first trumpet there was scattered hail Blood Fire upon the Earth just exactly with Exodus with the book of EX when God was calling his people outu the ex you [Music] understand so he says all the trumpets sound under the six se souls in prison now he says remember in The Sixth Seal all seven trumpets all the seven of them sounds under the Sixth Seal every seven all seven trumpets took place in the six se Allelujah amen under the Sixth Seal were these trumpets open amen am and this is what I wanted to end with right here recognizing your day and his message 1964 brother Bram says paragraph 35 now seven sabbaths represented the seven Church ages to be called in the time of the Pentecostal Feast to call a people from the Gentiles for his name at the end of the seven Sabbath which has been there was to be the day of atonement which was seven trumpets and the Seven trumpets was to call a day of morning back to the sacrifice the atonement and we find out then that Israel the seven trumpets pertained only to Israel then why he wouldn't let me preach them seven trumpets I even was ready to announce it I had the Halls ready and everything ready to go into and preach the seven trumpets and I said there is something bothering me so bad we kept on working Billy and all of us trying to get everything ready for the air conditioned building for this next coming week for the trumpets having 10 days or eight days to preach them had the school auditor but the Holy Spirit would not let me do it for some reason am how many can say amen for some reason and I wondered why amen amen I wondered why and when I went in to pray Hallelujah you see brother brandom is showing us that when he was looking for this Revelation he goes to pray that God will show him the reason why how many know that he preached the Seven Seals by faith amen did he know all of it before he preached it did he say okay I already have the understanding now I can preaching no he said I'm going to preach the first seal tomorrow and I don't even know what it is is that Faith or not Faith Hallelujah then he preach the first seal then he says tomorrow I'm preaching the second seal don't know what it is amen amen amen then he preach the second seal by divine revelation and so on and so forth he preached all seven seal by faith is that right here he says I went into to pray and I told my wife I'm going in and sincerely I kneelt down before God to and he revealed to me that them seven trumpets listen now he revealed to me that them seven trumpets sounded under the six seal and I all had done preached Supernatural amen now here's brother Brandon wanting to preach the seven trumpets already had the halls for 10 or eight days he's praying to God to get the revelation then God reveals to him [Music] hey you already preached the seven Trump and he didn't even know did William BR the man did he know that he had already [Music] preached did he know that he had already he preached the seven trumpets no sir it took the Holy Spirit to reveal to him that he had already preached when he preached the SE six trumpet the six seal listen he revealed to me that them seven trumpets sounded under the Sixth Seal and I've done preached it supernaturally see it's the hand of God the whole thing it pertains to Israel listen and we picked it up picked up what the seven trumpets we picked it up under the six seal you all you all who have that have what the six seal the persecution of the Jews and tonight we want to play Just for few minutes the six seal that you would understand do we understand do we understand where are the seven trumpets where were they revealed under the Sixth Seal you see it is things that are supernaturally in the message supernaturally you're not going to hear brother random mentioned when you when you when you hear the six seal you're not going to hear Brother BR mention this is the first trumpet this is the second Trump this is the third Trump this is the fourth Trump this is the fifth Trump this is the sixth Trump this is the seventh Trump you won't hear him say that you won't hear it's a supernatural Revelation when you hear the Feast of the trumpets you won't hear them tell you what all seven trumpets are you'll just hear him tell you what the first trumpet is what the fifth trumpet is what the sixth trumpet is and what the seventh trumpet is that's the only trumpets here he tells us and he doesn't open fully on he only touches the first trumpet very very little he gets into the fifth trumpet the star that fell from heaven having the key to the bottom of his pit opens up the pit the locusts come out amen six trumpet is where those 200 million demons amen are loosed from the Great River eup fres then the seventh trumpet is the great trumpet Hallelujah to usher in the Millennium amen those are the only things that you'll find him touch but the Holy Spirit revealed that the seven trumpets sounded under the Sixth Seal and he had already preached it supernaturally we picked it up under the six seal you all who have that amen amen hallelujah you understand so if we listen to The Sixth Seal don't expect him to tell you what all seven trumpets H but do expect the Holy Spirit to reveal to your heart what is under the The Sixth Seal amen that reveals all seven trumpets amen do you understand you love the Lord hallelujah let's give the Lord a hand clap our brother we'll listen to it uh not not too long but just enough so we can get at least some of it amen this message the six seal by Brother William Marian brandom was delivered

night now oh I've been really enjoying this tremendously amen serving the lord under these you enjoyed this [Applause] amen we are now speaking from the fifth seal or The Sixth Seal rather and that takes down now from the um the 12th verse of the sixth chapter down to the 17th one of the long seal that's quite a bit of things happen here and now the uh a little review of last night got it back up each time and say I I want to say something to I found in that box four or five uh very uh uh important things to me uh I was told that and I certainly want to apologize is it tap song song uh want to apologize to my Minister Breen and to you people here they say other night when I was speaking of U of Elijah uh that hour of um when they was uh he thought he was the only one was going to be in the Rapture only one going to be saved I said 700 instead of 7,000 is that right I'm sure sorry of that folks I I know better than that it was just simply a Mumble of speech because I know it was 7,000 I just didn't say it right I I I thank you and that means that I'm glad that you're watching what I say and you see then uh that's because it it's it's 7 down I got two three notes on it it said brother Brandon uh I believe you were mistaken it said wasn't a 7,000 inad of 700 I didn't say 700 then I Billy and then first thing I picked up another note and said brother I believe you said and one person said brother BR was that a a spiritual vision that that there just going to be a tight and you're tight with the it puts people on age when you go thinking these same things and it's enough it puts me on the age something happened a day when this seal was revealed I had to walk completely out in the yard just walk right out the yard a little while that's right it just simply almost took my breath right away from it see so it's attention oh my for another thing see you're laying right on to what I say and God's going to only me responsible what I tell you see and so I I'm must absolutely be as sure as all sure can be sure of these things because this is a a tremendous time that we're living think the healing service for Monday night that they just make one a pattern it's a it certainly has been a a real Chum and friend to [Applause] me the Tabernacle now built got the Sunday School rooms everything ready and order here and some of you people that's around here right je want to come to church got a nice place and place to come Sund teacher and here for the adult class and a real Pastor I don't say after toate to him but I'd rather give him a little Rose now than a whole reap after he's gone and brother brother Neville I've know him since I was just a ball and he hasn't changed one bit he's still arming Neville just like he always I remember visiting even he had Grace to ask me to his P pit when he has a Methodist preacher now here in the city and U we had a nice ation down there in Clarksville I guess that's called the hard Park Harrison Avenue Methodist churchard Park Harrison I think that's where he must found you was I come back up I said to the church I said that was that's one of the nicest man and one of these days I'm going to baptize him in the name [Applause] of there he is and now he's my ch right along my side such an honorable respectable man he's always stood by me just like it's as close as he could stand whatever I say he just lays right with him along even when he first come in he didn't understand the message then but he believed that he stayed right with it that's honor that's respect to brother like that I can't say enough and now the Lord bless all right now a little preview of last evening and the breaking of the fifth seal we won't go all the way back tonight just back far enough to get the the fifth seal how we find out that there was the Antichrist that rode on and wound himself up from three powers all went into one power and rode the pale Hearts death into a botom into and then we find out when the the scripture says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God raises up a standard against it and we see it perfectly Vindicated in the word last night or there was four Beast that had answered to the the four uh times that this ride or Ro and he wrote a different horse each time a white horse and then a red horse and a black horse and a Pale Horse and we found out those colors and what they were and what they did then take it right back into the ages of the churches and exactly that's what it done just perfectly therefore you see when the word of God Blends together that mean it's correct you see yeah I believe anything that hooks with the word of God is always amen amen I like a person said they had a vision and said it uh it was all they know the Lord give it because it come with great power well that Vision might be all right but if it isn't with the word and contrary to the word right may be some bre or sister they may be some get these Tes now I don't want to say that some of the finest people I you want to meet being Mar people very fine type of people and then there their Prophet Joseph Smith that the Methodist people killed here in Illinois on the journey over and so then that that fine man and the vision I don't doubt at all but what he had the vision I believe it's a sincere man but the vision he had was contrary to the scripture amen therefore they had to have a mar Bible to make it see this is it here to me this just the word that's it Hallelujah uh a a minister came here from a foreign country and me I see him out with the riding around the car with which is not uh with a lady and uh they come to a meeting and I found out that drove to three days just he and she in the me to come the meeting together and uh the woman had been married three or four different times and this Minister walked up in the hotel lobby where was and Shu hands with I shook his hand raised up to talking to him I asked him I said um when your free could I speak to you in my room just a moment he said certainly brother BR talk him to the room and I said to the minister I said Reverend sir uh you're a stranger in this land I said but this lady has a quite a name I said are you come all way from such and such a place down such and such a place said yes sir and I said you aren't you afraid that that'll kind of I I I'm not doubting you but don't you think that'll reflect on your reputation as a minister don't you think we should put a little better example than that and he said oh this lady's a saint I said I don't that but I said but brother the thing of it is everybody looks at her and not a saint I look at what you're doing and I said I believe you got be careful about this one brother to another and he said I said the lady's been married four or five times now and he said yes I know that said you know I I I said you don't teach that in your church at home do you for that so said no but said you know I had a vision of it brother brand I said well that's fine I said he said you might I believe I can straighten out a little bit on your teaching about that and I said all right and I said I'll be glad to know it sir and he said well I said you know in this Vision he said I was asleep and I said yeah I seen that was a dream and he said uh my my wife said she had been living with another man and said running around on me and said then she come to me and she said to me oh darling forgive me forgive me that I I I I'm sorry I did it I'll be true from now said of course I love her so much I just forgive her said all right me and said and said you know what then I got the interpretation of this Vision so that was a woman said sure she's been married and so forth all these times and said that it's all right for her to marry because the Lord loved her so much she marri many times as she wants [Music] to I said your vision was mighty sweet but it off the beaten that's that's wrong see you shouldn't do that so that see but when you see scripture a doveet tailing with scripture making it a constant uh uh um continuity or they come together the scriptures or this one leaves off here this other over here comes and dve Tails in draws the whole picture out like putting a crossw word puzzle together like you find the piece that fits in there nothing else can fit it then you're getting the picture fixed and the only one can do that that's the lamb and so we're looking to him but we find that when these this Rider he was one Rider that rode these horses and then we chased him right down seen what he' done and everything and found out back in the church ages that's exactly what he did [Music] when he went out on a certain beast and done a certain thing we find out that there was one sent to comat what he did there's one sent for the first age of L of line was the word of course Christ next was the ox during a time of the Dark Age when when the church had organized accepted dogas instead of the word and remember the whole thing is based on two things one of antichrist the other of Christ it's still the same thing [Music] today there is no halfway Christians there's no drunk Silverman no black white birds no no no sinner Saints no you're either a sinner or Saint there no between you're either born again or you're not born again you're either fill with the Holy Spirit you're not fill with the Holy Spirit no matter how many Sensations you with the Holy Spirit you're not f [Music] [Music] with and if you have been f with it your life shows nobody yet tell anybody they see it's a seal now we find those beasts how they wrote each time one sat out on his ministry and political Powers United uh religious powers and and political Powers together we find out God sent out his power to combat it we go right back see what the church age was and look back and there it was just exactly that [Music] way and we find out another Age come along and the enemy sent out the Antichrist under the name of religion or the name of Christ or the name of the church yes sir when out the name of the church that the real church he said Antichrist is not Russia Antichrist is not that Antichrist is so close like real Christianity you know the Bible said it would fool everything that wasn't predestinated the Bible said that in the last days everything that wasn't predestinated the elect it says elect anybody take that word write it back in your Mar see what it means it says the elected predestinated it'll fool every one of them whose names are not on the Lamb's Book of Life from the foundation of the world on the lamb SL the names are put on the book he's standing in the Holy place tonight in glory as an intercessor making intercessions for every one of those Souls whose name is on that book and nobody knows that name but [Music] him he's the one got the book in his hand and he knows that last one comes in and his intercessing days is over he comes forth there to claim what he's interceded for he's doing the kinsman redeemer work now comes for to receive his own oh my God ought to set a Christian searching himself and holding his hands before God and saying cleanse me oh Lord look into my life and and let me let me see where my bad part is let me get it out of the way right quick for the rightous be scarely save where will the Sinner and the ungodly appear it's checking up time and if you would place it and want to give this word I don't want to ask me question on this because get me Plum over on another I mean and write your questions I think the questions this is the time of the investigation judgment amen that's right I will'll get that on the on the trumpets when we come to that whenever the Lord provil and we'll find out on that investigating judgment when this before the woes went forth we see that that is true and the Three Angels had struck the Earth crying you know whoo whoo whoo into the inhabitants of the [Music] earth and we're living in a terrific time a time that you see these things that we're in now that we're studying right now is after the church is done gone amen these things is the Tribulation period I think it be truly settled in every believer's heart that this church never takes a tribulation period amen you cannot put nowhere the church in Tribulation I you put the church there but not the bride the bride's [Music] gone for she she has not one sin not a thing against her the grace of God is cover over and bleach struck every sin of far away not even ever Rememberance of but Purity perfect in the presence of God oh they to make the bride get down on her knees Hallelujah and cry out to God I think of a a little story about I'm not taking too much of your time now it's preliminary I do this for a purpose that feel feel the spirit just right this stuff this is a this is a secret thing see who knows things there nobody but God and they're not supposed to be revealed and proved in the Bible that they would not be revealed to this day exactly they was was guessed at but now we're supposed to get it exactly the truth the truth now it was a little uh girl in the west that how should should uh fell in love with a man had fell in love with her a fire the cattle come out there for the armor company no armor and they had a a great the boss come one day the boss's son from Chicago and of course they put him on a regular western frontier the the girls there they dressed up each one was going to get this Bo sure you know as a main man's boy so they dress in their Western Front they do that out west they just got through all those episodes now brother Maguire I think he's here now they caught him downtown without his western clothes on and th him in the a kangaroo court pay par then made go buy a western outfit I seen the rest guns about that long hand on them they just go native out there they're trying to live in something in the back gone [Music] days and then Kentucky you're trying to live in a byone days of the Easter I can R for Valley and things you like to go back to the old days something cusing that but when it comes back to go back to a gospel in the you don't want to do that you want [Applause] [Music] something what makes a man do wrong what makes him drink and carry on or a woman do wrong is because she's trying to there's something in her thirsting something in him thirsting and they're trying to quench that Holy thirst for the things of the world when God ought to be that quench he made you that way too thirst that's the reason you thirst for something God made you that way so you turn up holy thirst to him but when you try to quench that how dare anybody to do that you have no right to do that God to quench that holy thirst that you thirst for something and and then and you turn it into the world try to satisfy it with the world you can't do it the only one thing to fill that up that's God and he made you that way this this young girls put on a a regular Western carryon for this boy when he he come out and each one of a should is going to get this boy there's a little cousin there on the ranch and she was an Oran and so she just done all the the work for these CU they had to have the fingernails fix know and they couldn't wash the dishes for the hands and things and she done all the real hard work and then finally one the boy came they went out and
