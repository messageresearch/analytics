soul lord in the name of the Lord [Music] Jesus let's open our Bibles Book of Genesis 49 we'll read verse 22 Genesis chapter [Music] 49 verse 22 says Joseph is a fruitful bow even a fruitful Bow by a wall whose branches run over the wall amen some time ago we spoke on Joseph Perfection adoption said Joseph is a type of Christ he also said in Joseph meeting his brother brother many message like Israel in the church many other messages that Joseph is a type of the spirit filled church amen let's turn to the Book of Psalms PSM the first Psalm of David Psalm one verse one blessed is the man that walth not in the counsil of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scor but his Delight is in the law the word of the Lord amen and in his law word do he meditate day and night and it shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season amen amen his Leaf also shall not wither yes whato ever he does shall Pros the ungodly are not so but are like the cha amen which the wind driveth away St John in the New Testament chapter 15 The Book of St John Eagle is giving us here in chapter 15 The Words of Christ verse one I am the True Vine and my father is the husband every branch in me that bearth not fruit he taketh away amen every branch that bearth fruit he purges it it may bring forth more fruit now ye are clean the word which I have spoken unto you abide in me I in you as the branch can not bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except you abide in I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing Hallelujah if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and Men gather them and cast them them into the fire and they are burned if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will it shall be done unto you herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall be mypl the Lord have the blessing the reading of his word may be seated now God bless each and every one of you we have seen very tremendously already how that we are in another book of Acts today we are in this time exactly in that position in that place according to the word after Elijah and the son of man and before the Roman system comes to destroy and kill everything that does not receive its Mark the number of a man sits in thatone Satan will be the head and as we seen this Friday that image to the Beast is given power to speak Revelation 13 42 months hallelujah hallelujah chapter 11 of Revelation speaks of us of the Gentiles trotting upon Jerusalem coming in that territory to bring persecution not only on the Jews the whole world Bible said it is given to the city and they shall tread underf foot 40 two months and then it says that God is going to give power unto Moses and Elijah for 1,260 days going to give power unto them that this Roman system be not able to interrupt God's program when they are finished with it when their time of prophesying has ended then they are killed and Slaughter that shows us that Satan brother bam said has no right to take you death has no more power over the Sons and Daughters of God unless God permits God ain't finished with you God has a work for you to do when they finish prophesying 1,260 days which is the same 42 months in the Hebrew calendar a month is 30 days amen so if it's 30 in one month 42 months is 30 * 42 30 * 42 is a00 200 amen two witnesses are going to be ministering during the same time at this Beast of Revelations 13 image to the speak that shows you we seen Friday brother bam said in uniting time and that when Titus the Roman general came this this book of Acts this Alpha bride was not CAU in that slaughtering that killing amenu Hallelujah was not they were not that's a perfect Shadow and tipe of this Omega bride in this hour amen that will not go into those 42 months it will not go into those 1,200 and 60 days amen it will not go into when that image to the Beast is given power to speak because Satan is just an imitator amen he makes his image and he gives his image breath and then that image that receives breath begins to speak amenu just anator because the bride is to be the image of Christ and she is to receive the Breath of God the Holy Spirit and when you and I as His Image receive that breath will begin to speak too it's just you see but the bride will not go through that time she'll be freed from that because the Holy Spirit the power of God not National Force but the holy spirit will force us upward amen to the Rapture that be the power of God take us away amen this Omega Bride of the book of act will not go or will not enter will not be C by this Roman system we seen how Titus he United the nation United the armies he had gained power he had come to destroy to annihilate this movement God had Rose amen and as brother Bram says behind every movement of God fanaticism he said it's not a a miracle how that Luther could protest the Catholic church amen but the miracle was the great thing was how he could hold his head above water with all the fanaticism that followed his message amenu because people in the name of Luther's message they killed Catholic priests in the name of Luther's message they burned Catholic churches in the name of Luther's message they did shameful disgraceful things that Luther's message did not teach them but fanaticism leads people to go into an extreme things I was just telling uh our brother last yesterday people they they don't balance the way the prophet carried himself conducted himself here the prophet on the blasting organizational system preaching in a very very strong and direct way and condemning Hallelujah last in women all of these things that he preached he had to preach it that he had to bring the message that well don't you for one second think that he was that way when he would talk to somebody in a personal convers people hear the tape and then when they're in a in a personal conversation with somebody they think they're on they're on the pulit preaching and they can show you look said it right here see what I'm saying but I want to know that the spirit that was in Christ amen the spirit that was in the how did he talk to people how did he talk to a woman that was painted up that was under the deceit of some denomination amen amen was there love to try to show her love that she's in the wrong try to bring her to the truth and show some light that she hasn't seen something that they haven't taught her but we forget that we were once in that condition am we forget that we were Catholics worshiping some stupid ID we forget that we were once ignorant am just because you know things by the message doesn't give you the right to put somebody down amen that's a condition like that's not the spirit of Christ you're pushing people away you're not bringing them Inu the attitude of a lot of people in the message amen that's not what I see in the prophet that's not what I see in Christ you understand what I'm saying amen hallelujah be what you believe got be the spirit now watch brother brandham has showed us exactly that again in this hour this ministry of Malachi 4 is to restore the hearts of the children back to this faith and bring us back into the place in the same position that same tree he planted that tree that was cut down by the Roman system just like Christ the Tree of Life was cut down by the Roman system amen the bride tree would be restored Again by Malachi brother Bram gives us this this truth this Revelation he shows us this the message the restoration of the [Music] Bride but one thing I want to point out to begin with as we are in this book of Acts series and today we're going to be speaking on the True Vine and the fruitful branches amen amen the True Vine and the fruitful branches so one thing we want to point out to begin with is that brother bam shows us that the tree that Christ planted he planted it in the book of Acts that's where that tree began understand but the restoration of that tree is not restored until Malachi 4 restores it back by word amen amen hallelujah because although Luther brought a truth to it he wasn't restoring the truth he was bringing a truth that this messenger was going to take as he was going to tie the loose end to bring this church again you see what I'm saying in other words the tree is not restored in Luther's age or Wesley's P brother Bram said the restoration of this tree amen had to be after the ministry Elijah and the son of man amen amen hallelujah amen but just like Jesus when he died that tree was cut down he said it took three days for the tree to rise up brother that to Luther's age see in that first day when he had first died that's Luther's age he's still in the grave the tree hasn't rose up yet see what I'm saying amen second day he's still in the grave Wesley's age he hasn't rose up yet amen third day he rose but brother bam said it was only a rumor why because that was a beginning the Pentecostal age there was a rumor that went around that the same Jesus that Liv 2 years ago alive again but he said that was the third day in the morning because Mary ran to tell the amen there was others like Luke 24 on the road to Damascus right Jesus appeared to them and then he made himself known to them and they ran back to Jerusalem to tell the disciples what they had seen see it was all rumors until Jesus according to John chapter 19 it's the Bible it's the prophet and St John chapter 20 he appeared to to them in the evening time that third day he made himself known and the Bible says he began to open up the word amen that's a type of this evening time when this even light was going to come to make himself known the ministry of Elijah the prophet and the son of man healing himself to open to us the word and show us and even the disciples that had walked with him and that had believed in him and that had been Justified Sanctified said Now understand amen Jesus didn't just rest when he I'm talking about his resurrection is his resurrected for he Tau yes and the Bible says and by many infall who he was then he gave him the promise then he breathe the Breath of Life on Amen as the father to [Music] the wait for the promise shall receive amen that shows you exactly that if this ministry has come to our hour to our age our day to our generation amen want to come out of this Resurrection Ministry amen amen is exact Hallelujah in other words what's to come out of this ministry that we have received this message of this Prophet was to come out of it brother tells us and the message it is the rising of the Sun that that first chief that reached maturity back there 2000 years years ago was the first one to rise amen and he was waved over the people and he said that waving of that sheath over the people was on the day of Pentecost Hallelujah and that's why that waving caused the mighty rushing wind to come into the upper room and fill them the pillar of fire all that was in Christ divided itself and set upon Hallelujah right amen he poured into the church but brother Bram says it's not poor like we poor he see because our thinking of pouring is that you pour and then this is empty after you pour the water from this this stays empty he says God can't do that amen he said the word is kenosis amen which means that he pours that doesn't mean that he's empty if he pours everything in US amen hallelujah see what I'm saying hallelujah hallelujah he divides a reprod so this is where we're at brother bam says the restoration of the brid tree now talking of restoring here in Joel God is speaking here in Jo listen to this God is speaking of his fruit tree that he had planted he on the day amen and he brought that tree there for a purpose amen right what's the purpose he wanted it to bear his fruit amen and what is that God's word amen the tree bearing fruit is God's amen he wanted a church that would keep his word all down through the age Eve had failed to keep the Jews failed to keep the law failed all had failed do you hear what the prophet is saying that the reason he planted this tree on the day of Pentecost is because he wanted it to bear fruit am fruit of the word that would not fail don't you know there's a promise don't you know there's a prophecy in the God of this evil a message and Christ is the mystery of God revealed message this bride will not fail why did the other churches fail because it was exactly that just a church Hallelujah you hear what I said amen then you might say then what are we supposed to be the word amen amen can the word fail can Christ fail that's why this is a time of Union it's a time to be one with him and that cannot fail because it's the word it's not man it's not man governing a church it's not man organized in a church his spirit in a body controlling overseeing amen he has the oversight he has the controlj Adam said the church is controlled by the Holy Spirit it should be anyway and the Holy Spirit directs us to the word to act out the word carry on the word and bring fruit fruit every Branch Through the Ages that didn't give says the restoration cut them off hallelujah amen cut them off Hallelujah but he said that original vine according to his word glory to God hallelujah amen according to God's promise in Jo chapter 2 I will restore all the year amen that the canor the Caterpillar p and the Locust e i rest not asking you can I restore he's telling you I will restore it hallu amen hallelujah hallelujah according to his prise yes amen amen and according to his promise that True Vine that original life amen that original spirit amen was going to come again to manifest the true everybody claims to be the true B everybody claims to be the Church of Christ the Church of God the Pentecostal Church the Apostolic Church they're all claiming what we're talking about they all claim to be that Amen brother say hallelujah and brother Ram said that same that same devu just Chang four stages amen amen see what people don't understand is that brother vam is preaching a message not just sermons he is preaching a message so when he speaks in restoration of the brid tree he speaks it in the seven Church you understand what I'm saying he showed you in the seven Church ages how the spirit of antichrist came in defiled the church and ran it all the way until com to this last and how in the lean Church age that he preached in 1960 he showed you there like he said Friday God is going to turn back go back to thew it's a message it's everywhere not just exclusive in one part brother is preaching a message amen then when he comes to the opening of The Seven Seals what does he show that the same Spirit of antichrist it's not a different writer it's the same Spirit of an just changing form from the White Horse to the red horse to the black horse to the you see what I'm saying am but to me that makes it more even more clear that the restoration can't be during the time are you hearing me during the time that these four stages havee up the tree I don't know if you got what I'm saying it's the White Horse and the red horse and the the what does that cover what is the locus Palmer worm caterpillar uh uh and Palmer worm cover what does it cover and when you see what it covers and what it it what is what did it affect who did it kill right who did destroy when you see that then you see the picture clear then you see that the restoration has to come after that amen amen amen although in every age was there was Bri in every age there was an elected group sealed with the light that God had given them for that time but let me clarify something that is still not although they're bride although there elect group that is not the full restoration book of it's a but the restoration comes caterpillar amen loc these four ins after they ate then the the restoration amen the restoration is not promised to start with Luther he brought a truth that is part of the restoration when the restoration is going to begin this messenger is going to take the Revelation that Luther received and and bringing in for the restoration he's going to bring the revelation of sanctification of Wesley bring it in tree you understand what I'm saying he's going to bring baptism of the Holy Ghost with Pentecost and he going to bring it into the tree hallelujah hallelujah the restoration begins begin with Luther to begin over there although they have truths that is part of this Resturant see what I'm saying all right see how clear that makes it see how see how it places it right there to show us where the where the bride tree is being restored at yes now let's see real quick what did these four brother told us these four insects they killed the tree that he planted in the book of Acts right what was the first thing that they that it ate amen amen what was the first thing that it did first thing amen amen that this ins the loc Joel 2 verse 25 eat the fruit amen amen amen so here's this big beautiful tree that he planted for a purpose what's the purpose we read it joh I am the life of this tree I am the Vine amen hallelujah and the very first thing that this Spirit of anly see what did he do what is the FR amen hallelujah in the message anointed ones at the end time brother said the fruit is the teaching of the season right in other words it's the message amen that's the first thing attack the fruit the word in his unadulterated form he's got to mess with that to mess everything else that's exactly what he did the B oful said after my departure Wes will come in even while he was alive there was some teaching and moving the faith of the church in a different direction Hallelujah he said I'm afraid that like yes amen turn from this gospel of Christ you know what he said amen and that you have turned to another Jesus which I have not preached hallelu amen denominations today preach of Jesus their imination it's not the same Jesus of the Bible they're preaching Jesus oh Jesus love Jesus claim the love God but they deny his word don't you know that he is the word how can you love God and not love his word how can you love Jesus and not love the word the beginning what's the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word came down to the Earth and was made flesh that is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah hallelujah so what did he eat he attacked the fruit the word and when when that is messed [Music] with the fruits of the spirit are are messed with what are the fruits of the spirit amen said rest of the Bride tree that's what that demon that devil that's what he ate those fruits because that that church that he planted had fruits amen amen those branches brother the book of act shows us they had fruits if stepen had fruits did he love them even when they were killing him he was you cannot tell me that that that was faake that either had being genu or says that first church the was the most deceived church amen if what they were following what they were believing is false and we're the most deceived people in the world amen amen like the little song says if this message is wrong I don't want to amen am hallelujah amen amen but it ain't wrong Gans 5 Hallelujah verse 22 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Hallelujah meekness Temperance against such there is no law and they that are Christ have crucified the flesh the affections us if we live in the spirit let us walk in the amen Amen brother says those were the [Music] fruits amen what was one of the fruits they had in the book of Acts that is to be restored to us in this age these things that we just read right how can we claim to be in the restoration and not have love and not have joy did that church have joy Hallelujah it had joy joy unspeakable and full of Glory but today brother we're the restored [Music] church that's part of the restoration amen that's part of the restoration Joy is a part of the restoration peace is a part of the restoration love is a part of the restoration patience is a part of the restoration yes sir Hallelujah hallu so brother dieo are we to have joy today yes sir joy unspeakable and full of Glory brother said a bunch of dignified group came into the church and said you know what we need to change this little because if you want to attract the nice people they won't like these type of servic people are shouting and crying amen amen and filling the alt Hallelujah so they wanted brother said they wanted to make it more appealing it says they wanted to conform to the people hallelujah hallelujah to attract the people is that what happened what else did he take said the fruits the nine fruits yes also speaks of the nine spiritual yes thaton of amen hallelujah that shows us this restoration gifts must be in their place all God's gifts not God's gifts they'll never find their but God's gifts do find their place the message has showed us the word shows us how those gifts go in their place brother Bram said there is a deception of Amen but there is a true gen you understand we're barely on on the first stage of there was four what was the next thing he ate he ate up the leaves brother says Fellowship among the mean fellow that's what that devil ate in that first church because that first church that book of Acts church had fruits and they had leaves the man said that give shame the leaves give shame a tree with no leaves doesn't give shame the shame is welcoming amen amen he says it cools you under that Hallelujah that's Fellowship the leaves clap their hands together amen it speaks of Fellowship it speaks of Revival yes sir and that's what that book of Acts church had amen that's what that Alpha bride had after the ministry of Elijah and the son of man he planted this tree a tree with fruits a tree with joy a tree with leaves hallelujah hallelujah are we to have brotherly kindness in this we have honey in this hour remember the the sister of the dream amen and Blas his names brother mam said she saw me amen pouring buckets of water into a basket with rocks amen he says that's brother said that was me preaching this message pouring in the water is the word and that's what happens many times even right here Among Us God pours out Revelation pours out word pours out Revelation but you don't see a lot of people retaining it that shows is not Cor re is not revealed when it's revealed to you it'll never go away you don't forget Revelation brother said water kept f filtering out coming out he says and all the water will just wash all the way down he said until [Music] took intock pour the ad said Hallelujah stat of a perfect man for his brotherly kindness that you can even bitterly disagree with your brother you don't have to be you can be in disagreement disagreement not agreement disagreement amen amen I have to agree with him so I can love him leaves understand and then what was the third stage of that the amen the doctrine brother that's the covering of that's the clothing of the tree that's the word that's the doctrine amen the church is built upon the doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets Ephesians is that right amen amen is that word hallelujah hallelujah brother and sister that shows us that that demon is still going to fight that today he's still gonna fight that Doctrine he's still gonna fight that brotherly kindness he's still gonna fight those fruits of the spirit he's still gonna fight those nine spiritual gifts he's gonna fight it but if this is a restoration amen that's got to be in the hallelujah hallelujah to God you see the book of act shows you those five Ministries iner it shows you James as aor amen Jem is that right it shows you phip as an evangelist amen then he called Peter and John after he went to evangelize and baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ amen Philip an evangelist with the Holy Ghost set Sam Samaria on fire Hallelujah and then Peter and John to lay their reive the holy is that right amen hallelujah you see teachers Gifts of teaching Gifts of Prophecy amen amen hallelujah he give Tong is that right amen book of five Ministries nine spiritual grsu and if this is the restoration if he said I will restore say not just oh amen amen everything that them demons ate I'm going to restore every single not just you know not just the gifts no I'm going to restore that I'm going to restore Joy too I'm going to restore nine spiritual gift Hallelujah I'm going to restore true Shepherds true evangelists amen true men called of God I'm going to restore true now brother bam says here he planted this tree on the day of Pentecost and he brought the tree for a purpose he wanted it to bear fruit he wanted a church that would keep his word he had failed Jews had failed the law had fail remember there was two trees in the Garden of Eden we know that you call them whatever you want I have my idea but anyhow one of those trees was defile the other other one wasn't defiled that was the Tree of Life from God out of Heaven he said your fathers eat mana and are dead and the angel guarded that tree of life from the Garden of Eden kept it in Eden that tree of life is in eeden now spiritually speak and when this tree that God planted it was to Bear nine different kinds of fruit the tree that he planted on the day of Pentecost was going to give nine different kinds of fruits which means nine spiritual gifts and nine fruits of the spirit to go with the nine spirit that's that was God's tree amen that he planted in the Earth on the day of now he said now let's go to Psalm the first Psalm David saw this tree a long time ago and in his writings of his songs for something joyful the first thing he wrote about he saw this tree it was planted by rivers of water he shall be like a tree God's tree planted where by the rivers plural rivers of water one water singular many rivers Hallelujah not a Methodist not a Baptist not AI so forth no no uhhuh just rivers of one water not spiritual gifts by The Same Spirit nine fruits of the spirit amen coming from the same channel right amen David saw and he spoke he said blessed is that man and he said he could not die hallelujah hallelujah brother this tree that he has restored in this hour cannot die David said I shall not die he hasn't given me over to death Hallelujah but I will live to declare the work the Lord we shall not all die amen but we shall all be changed and them that are alive that will remain until the coming of the Lord shall be changed in a moment in twinkling of the last TR yes Hallelujah notice you shall never die why because it's where he is planted he is planted by the rivs of water now notice David his roots won't die his roots won't Hallelujah now watch what brother said amen amen and the same message restoration of the Bride tree he says now think of that Perfect Tree David looked back and saw it standing by the rivers of water he bringeth forth his leaves in season and his fruit shall not be cast it won't wither whatsoever he does shall prosper he was the son of prosperity watch how brother Bram is connecting this tree Jesus said I am the vine you are the branch the day Pentecost takes it back to Psalm one amen connects that tree there and then it's going to connect this tree back to Joseph amenu that's why this morning we began with Genesis 49 Psalm one and St John 15 now the prophet is taking us back Amen in that same order understand amen he says David saw that tree it was planted by the rivers of water he bringeth forth his leaves and it seeds and his fruit shall not be cast it won't wither whatsoever he does shall prosper see he's the son of prosperity Joseph was a type of him and he was the antip Joseph and where Joseph went it prospered the same thing with Jesus his word my word will prosper it won't return to be void it will accomplish that which I purposed it for see he was the word and the Word was sent to the Earth by God remember I sent my word and it will accomplish exactly what God sent it he says listen close now this gets rich with cream on top God is a good husbandman he bred the tree that was all he cut off all the dead limb what's he going to do burn them up exactly God is the husband he takes care of it he watches over his Heritage what is his Heritage his own word he watches over his word to confirm it to watch it to see where he can get it he's going to restore so when these churches begin to organize and things like that he just prunes him amen and the church goes on when the Lutheran said we're going to become an organization yes we'll be as big as a Catholic all right he just pruned the branch off when Wesley took it raised up another as soon as Wesley see they organized it they died Pentecost as soon as she died he pruned that off it's raising right up to the top now he's going to restore it where does the fruit grow it doesn't start down here on the bottom it starts in the top where does the sun hit the tree first all glory in the evening light the top of the tree amen not down in the bottom branches but up there in the top of the tree is where the fruit ripens at amen so he going to start with the restoration glory to God he has to restore the fruit he has to restore the leaves he has to restore the bar but the life never died the life is Christ the vine was still there The Life of Christ never was taken from yes Glory although the church during the dark was almost complely Hallelujah there still some there amen amen they prob didn't have all the gifts like that first early church amen they probably didn't have all of these Ministries like the first early but there was still somebody hallelujah hallelujah amen give me Christ and give me death amen and they died at the state they died in Roman circus in the Roman Arenas Hallelujah they were F and today we don't even want to die to ourselves we don't even want to die to the world but there was men women and children that died physically for thisi hallelujah oh but this is the restoration God never did put an organization the church Gras what does God do cuts it off amen cuts off his Lifeline in other words it's not an original bran that Branch didn't come out of the life of the tree it was from another tree was cut off from there and brought to this tree and when the time was right the husbandman the father hallu hallelujah amen hallelujah why because it's put out another brujah I will put out another Branch Lord hallelujah these men these organizations have messed with my tree for they have been messing with for a long time and they have not allowed me to put out my Branch amen amen last that's why he said if that line ever puts out another Branch it will another book of he says I will restore let me do it we've heard enough from men brother we've heard enough doctrines of men already am let him do it hallelujah hallelujah that's what brother say stat a perfect man says what going to go in that not amen that's why there's a church natural there a church there's a Bond woman the free woman woman is those that are bound to the law carnal trying to fulfill the word the word says this let me try to do it said that never worked never work no one was ever able to itlu and without that one in you can't do nothing if you abide in me my word abide in you ask without me me you can do nothing am if this Branch ain't in the v i don't care what you do it ain't going to produce amen that's why when the Lord amen takes his bride amen amen rest down here just like when you saw that fig tree why did he curse didn't have leaves didn't cursed the thing Amen brother said when he cursed no one was able to notice anything after he cursed still noral like the same tree it LO like yesterday in the Unseen real down underneath the Earth the life of that tree amen what did Jesus say everye am I'm telling you iten that's why in the vision of the Prophet the first thing he saw was that first oral is that right he says and then after herble churches vision is because the first thing wasn't a horrible church first thing was an original after until finally saw Church amen amen in emotions being WIC see because after the book of Acts you had a churchi you understand horrible am am but after he saw amen says I looked and saw again that church come back around the second time I will restore was going to produce that first March of the Bride again Hallelujah said the free woman the Jerusalem from above go in thean amen yes amen amen see people today say brother you know we we want we want the the holy ghost old fashioned Holy Ghost that's true tolu but I want to see what that old fashioned Holy Ghost you call what does it produce what does it produce what does it give because brother Ram said the Holy Ghost will never deny any words and the Bible is wrote by that Holy Ghost amen the word is made Spirit dwelling in us I will be with you you to the brother Adam says anybody says that they got the Holy Ghost and denies one word this then it's not the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost wrote the Bible amen every word man shall not live by bread alone but by every word the ho ghost recognizes the word only because that's his word and he cannot go back on his word he has to keep his word hallelujah amen amen and then the message the the word is falling apart he says you want to know the secret where where the secret lies the power of visions and things is back to the word says He says people today they claim that they have great revivals oh brother we had a tremendous Revival oh yes there was a lot of this and a lot of that he says but what comes out of it who in that Revival was brought back to the word he said in the Ephesian church every true reviv is when people came back to the word to rev when people are beginning to line themselves up with that word that is a Revival taking place inside of individual am that's that tree being restored again hallelujah hallelujah brother remember some of you here may also our sister Rebecca testified of it in our last Service uh in the building amen testimony service first time I preached on the restoration of the Bri tree amen the pillar of fire showed up in the service confirming we are in that time fire didn't go away angel of God didn't leave the angel of God Christ amen amen with the rainbow over his head is still here hallelujah that's why we can go to we can still hear his voice that's the book of Acts he can still lead us and direct us and guide us amen he can still fill with the Holy Ghost got will you got to have we got to give our all amen said that is exactly what this restoration is now let's let's watch this are you still with mejah remember said I am the True Vine you are the branches but he said these branches if they're in the vine they are if you abide in me I abide in you you will bear you will produce much food amen is that right what brother in this hour we must abide in him we must abide word that's the trouble of today the people are not getting into the word the people are not getting into the message it's just superficial just little basic principles amen amen that's all right but that will never give you the power of the Mage amen message Anin message hasu you got to abide in that M because you say well Christ said abide in me what do you think this message what do you think this message is something other than Christ amen something other than the word brother this message Christ the so we got to abide in that are you hearing me church amen we got to abide in that word because there's a power amen and he said you shall [Music] receive they had already received they already been established in the four gospels who taught them now he after you have heard all of these things I have taught you it's time to receive this same word that I have taught you you see what I'm saying am brother bam said there's mechanic then there's dyamics to that mechanic amen and he got the word dynamics from the Bible he wasn't making it up that's why the Bible said in the last days there'll be those who have a form of godliness but they will deny the power amen power in that scripture and in many other scriptures is the Greek [Applause] word dunam which where we get our English word amen hallelujah see amen Dynamics is power you shall receive power then you be my Witnesses but we can never be a true witness of this message until you receive power he says in believe from the heart God showing his power not me I'm just a branch amen he energized the branch till I couldn't help from uttering them voices what would I ever have thought of a little fish laying there when we had even cut him up baited on the line the little fish hanging there laying dead and Mr wood and them sitting right looking at me now witness of that the spirit of God swept down through the valley until you thought the Rapture was coming even until Mr wood screamed out and said oh it's good to be here said brother we're so happy to be here the only expression they could give was to be being me being their brother see amen he said little fish in the name of Jesus Christ come back to life amen what was that I was just branch and heed the branch so I couldn't help but just utter them the Bible say in Revelation 10 that that Mighty angel came down from with the little book open in his and he roared like with a ro amen he cried with a loud voice and seven Thunders their brother said that name that new name will be raled every time he used that hallelujah hallelujah he said in the name of Jesus in the name of Jesus CHR I give you back your life in the name of Jesus Christ I give you your two children in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen he was uttering because brother bam said in the Ephesian Church the name of Jesus Christ is not just pronouncing the name it's having the life of that name inside of you he is divine and we are the branches we can produce the fruits amen by the name of Jesus Christ brother says that's why there was some in the book of Acts that by the name of Jesus Christ they tried to impersonate imitate yes they went against Spirit of epilepsy yes amen they said we adure you in the name of Jesus Christ prach amen amen Amen brother said in demonology the only thing that demons will recognize not screaming amen the louder you scream to the Devil he's gonna get scared scream all night amen said pour a whole gallon of oil on on the person that will make the demon leave not oil not although we believe in those we believe in anointing with o we believe in screaming but that's not what scar to be that's what we need around that what he saides and you can't help but uttering them voices it's the vine energizing the branches Hallelujah says thundering outet with the fruits with the leaves with the life amen bearing the fruit in you amen he says that's the Thunder shakes the not just because they used the name of Jesus Christ no no they used it brother the Bible says brother says they left running from that demon possess Hallelujah yes demon possess Hallelujah said they didn't have the the demons knew Jesus Christ did they know did they know who he was they were in in Legion and they say thou Son of God why have Thou come before time to torment us brother said religious blind people didn't even know who he was he said but watch demons know exactly who he to religious people brother they don't recognize but demons will have to recognize for of the word amen so Jesus we know oh we know who he is so you see how this connects the vine energizing the branch say is what anointed him the Third to raise this fish from that was the vine energizing the branch UT voice in the name of Jesus Christ I give you back your life brother Hallelujah fundamental foundation for Faith he says now if Satan's body can be operated by unbelief doubts and fears will produce what the scripture says it'll produce sickness it'll produce disaster it'll produce all those things Satan can come into our body right amen and give us a headache give us a pain give us a sickness and brother BL says in this message fundamental foundation for faith says we he says and that's the spirit of Satan yes working on and you recognize that something has come upon your body and isting you he says and then and people by unbelieving produce that shouldn't people believing with the power of God harness these things and bring them back to correction in other words healing shall also come from that vine on the inside of the inside heing is in you already if the vine is in and that fruit will be produced in your life if you let that vine produce that if you abide in him and his word abides in you ask what you will Lord I feel sick but I know you're the vine I'm your branch now let the fruit of healing is that one of the nine spiritual gifts well that's suppos to reflect in you Lord I need healing Lord I'm in the book of Acts Lord this is the restoration that fruit of divine come back in my life Hallelujah you understand what I'm saying brother let's bring it down so we can apply this to our personal life not leave it way up here it's for you it's for me it's for our everyday walk what I'm preaching is not just to show us the big picture but also to bring it down into our everyday life show us that he is the we are the branch not just today on Sunday we're the branches and and Monday we're not the branches and he he's no longer the line brother this is resident this is permanent this is abiding the spirit of God came in the form of a dove Upon Jesus and the Bible says say what does abide mean it abided in him made his home there amen hallelujah hallelujah if you abide in me and my word which is him brother Adam says have you ever thought what did he redeem us how many redeem we have here toight Hallelujah by the blood of the Lamb filled with the Holy Ghost amen did you ever think what he redeemed us for why did he just make you the the atonement and say now there's no need of giving them deep powers there's no need of giving them deep po there's no need in making this man a Son of God there's no need in doing that I'll just ask him to believe it write his name in the book of Heaven that's that's not it that's what Baptist preach that's what that's what Methodist preach a lot of people in the message preach but he gave us these redeemed blessings does he have seven compound names of redemption amen are those seven compound names of redemption for those that are in Redemption yes they're for the redeemed other people benefit from it but they're exclusively for the redeemed to God he is our healer he's our Shepherd he is with us he is our provider hallelujah hallelujah you see redemp bless in the person Jesus chist now watch what he says here but he gave us these redeemed blessings that we might operate the work of God by the energy of the ho the vine energizes the branches how many need more Holy Ghost energy he says in St John 15 he said I'm theine and you are the branches do you know that the vine cannot bear fruit although the fruit is in the vine the fruit cannot be brought forth from the vine it has to have a branch to Bear the fruit you are the branches and the Vine with all of its energy canot produce anything unless the branch is willing to receive did you hear what he said you got to be willing you have got to be willing Amen to receive the energy amen from the Vine so that the fruits can be produced he is powerful Hallelujah he can do Mighty things but you have got to be willing to receive that energy of the Holy Ghost to see those Mighty things in your life see those fruits being bured in your life amen God is depending on you as a member of his body Amen to bear fruit of his Spirit God is depending on you as a member of his body bear the fruit of his spirit and if he's depending on you let's open up our Channel let's let the Holy Spirit come in tonight today and energize us hallu and free us from all these fears and doubts and rival is coming someone said the power was only given to the apostles for those things I'm not a historian but I have read much church history and I have never seen a time in all the history of the world where there ever was waves of the Holy Ghost that ever struck the church without a Revival but signs and wonders Miracles foll God heal the sick in every age and he'll continue to do it in every age where people and the churches are willing to let loose and let the Holy Spirit take control of their amen is hallu let me close with this let's go back to Genesis 499 hallelu Hallelujah it says which is a type of Jesus a type of the spirit filled Church hallelujah amen this is the vine and the branches in one person in a Joseph is a fruitful bow bow means Branch fruitful Branch amen amen Christ in the true church is the continuation of the book of with me Christ in the true church is a continuation the book of so that is theine inside the life inside of the tree right and this Branch giving forth another Branch this original Branch the one that the vine produces is a fruitful Branch he is the vine and we are the branch but not just any branch this Branch or these branch anes of this restored bride tree has to be ACH hallelujah hallelujah a fruitful [Music] branches look it Joseph is a fruitful B Genesis 4922 Joseph is a fruitful BR even a fruitful Bow by a well whose branches run over the wall is being prophesied by his father is amen amen this is listen to this look at how perfect this is Jacob theeten amen Jacob the one who met the mighty angel that came down from heaven hallelu Jacob that wrestled with this Mighty Angel and receive nameall Hallelujah one who met this face of 30 miles high 27 miles across because Jacob called that place where he wrestled with the angel because he seen face amen amen in this hour when that face of God when that Mighty Angel come down from heaven book in his hand was a man on the Earth was a prophet on the earth that Reed that Revelation from him hallelujah hallelujah amen yes sir but notice how perfect the spirit of Revelation shows us that Jacob here is prophesying over his 12 sons why because this is his death bed Genesis 49 is Jacob just like today if a father of a family is in his death he's going away maybe in the hospital and the doctors are saying he's he's G and the father says call my son bring he begins to pray prophesy over each one of them starting with Ruben go [Music] hallu Hallelujah top of 11 hour worker this 11 hour when Jacob in the ministry of the Prophet Hallelujah hallu he going off the seene he's going to leave a prophecy over this this church amen amen he anoints Jose remember this is a prophet why do you think when it comes to Joseph he begins to prophesy is [Music] a he is speaking under inspiration propy he's not just praying a nice prayer with beautiful words this is a prophet amen amen that is in the real of vision he comes Toph as a Vine that it branches over the wall but but this Branch this Vine this tree is the same one that David saw David said a tree planted by rivers of water hallu Hallelujah you say well he didn't say Rivers here yes amen am brother Adam says this in thean church AG he says to understand of a born again and spirit fi many have misinterpreted being spirit filled and being born again as two different things in St John 7 verses 37 to 39 read now with understanding the prophet says on the great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any thirst let him come unto me drink he that believeth on me as the scripture have said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water and this he spake of the spirit which they that believed on him should receive the Holy Ghost for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus had not yet been glorified amen that's what the scripture says right there John so in other words when he said he that is a thirst come and I'll give him the drink and inside of him living he was speaking according to the Bible interpretation and the prophet of God in the SM and church age John chapter 7 amen he was speaking verses 38 and 39 but this he spake he of the spirit which they that believed on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified you see the Bible interpret itself in other words when Jesus said rivers of water he was speaking when they would receive the Holy Ghost the day of Pentecost you get that now so when David said I saw a tree planted by rivers of water brother says he was see R Tree God plant Hallelujah on the day of Pentecost why because there's the rivers of water and there's the tree the vine in the tree with the branches giving fruit hallelujah hallelujah but you say but Joseph is a fruitful and his branches amen run over the wall what look what the prophet says now keeping through keeping this thought in mind we read John 14 14 if thou would know the gift of God and who sayith to thee give me the drink thou wouldest have asked of him that he would have given thee Living Water but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him in him amen a wh of water springing up into everlasting life amen mother Madam said this same living water is mentioned but this time is not called a river or Rivers it is called in Aran well there is where people make their mistake because it is called a well and a river and they think that in one place they're given eternal life by the spirit and the next place is called the river implying a great D dynamism it has to be the spirit now given as an end of power but it's not so in other words two different things it is one one and the same thing it is the spirit that gives life and power and that came expence so what did Riv am what did Jacob see in hision when blessing amen amen a branch a Vine with branches fruit Branch those branches but where did he [Music] see the sameus it's the same the prophet saw amen is the vine the True Vine and the fruitful Hallelujah is that right if the first church was a product of that vine Jesus Christ wrote a book of Acts then the second Branch will have to be same thing brother the only time he's ever produced another Branch since that time amen hallelujah hallelujah I am the vine you are the branches if if the first Branch brought forth Joy love loyalty gifts of the Spirit casting out evil spirit Water baptis by Mercy In The Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah then the second Branch will have to do the same but all these others Pentecostals Baptist Methodist they cannot write a book of act behind their Church why because it's in the wrong L there's something wrong with it if Jesus was on the Earth today and I would walk up him and say Lord Jesus I go to a church that don't believe in Divine Healing he would say it wasn't so from the beginning if I went to Jesus and said Lord my church does not believe in speaking with other tongues he would say it wasn't so from the beginning if I went to the Lord Jesus and I have been sprinkled and my church says it's all right my pastor says if I sprinkle you with water it's just as good as immersing with water Jesus would answer wasn't so hallelujah oh brother he's the same yesterday forever this power Hallelujah and this is a full restoration am that original bride tree amen and these branches God this R amen is not going to be pruned off this ride is not going to be cut off Hallelujah brother this Branch will run over the wall because we're by the well is that right who is Joseph the spirit filled Church hallelujah hallelujah that book of Acts church amen where what is the whale represent you know where eler meta where wasca Hallelujah huj said the angel of the Lord lcca hallelujah amen
