[18:13] seat let us go to the Book of
[18:17] James the Book of
[18:20] James chapter
[18:23] one
[18:25] hallelujah hallelujah
[18:29] the Book of James chapter
[18:32] 1
[18:35] and most of us
[18:38] know that we have been on this
[18:42] subject this
[18:45] theme we've been looking at this
[18:49] picture two three months
[18:54] now of the
[18:57] restoration
[18:59] of God through the ministry of the
[19:03] seventh
[19:05] angel according to Matthew
[19:08] 17 according to Acts chapter
[19:12] 3 the restitution of all
[19:16] things was supposed
[19:19] to be
[19:24] done
[19:27] before the Corporal body of Jesus
[19:31] Christ receives his
[19:33] bride in the
[19:35] air Acts chapter 3
[19:38] says that the heavens must
[19:41] retain Jesus until the restitution of
[19:45] all
[19:46] things in other words when the
[19:48] restitution of all things
[19:52] happens then Heavens cannot retain him
[19:55] no
[19:56] more he can come
[19:59] down for his
[20:01] bride he came first to Die For His
[20:05] Bride Comes This
[20:08] Time for his bride then he comes with
[20:13] his
[20:16] bride so when we're think when we're
[20:20] looking at
[20:23] this this this book of
[20:27] Acts been very very
[20:30] beautiful showing us what the book of
[20:34] Acts means to us
[20:38] today because brother Bram said in the
[20:42] revelation of Jesus
[20:43] Christ Christ in the true
[20:47] church is the
[20:50] continuation of the book of
[20:52] Acts amenu also said many messages
[20:58] Christ is the mystery of God
[20:59] revealed in the seals he said it all
[21:04] through the
[21:06] message Jesus said in St John
[21:09] 15 I am the vine and you are the
[21:14] branches
[21:16] right and brother bam preached the
[21:20] restoration of the Bride tree that tree
[21:25] that he
[21:26] planted on the day of P
[21:29] wrote a book of
[21:31] Acts but that tree As We Know by the
[21:35] prophet was also cut
[21:38] down by the Roman
[21:41] Spirit the Roman
[21:44] system the Antichrist Spirit came into
[21:46] the
[21:48] church amen and it came down to a
[21:53] stump but he said in Jo chapter
[21:57] 2 I will
[21:59] restore say the Lord Brother preached
[22:02] the restoration of the Bride
[22:05] tree restore the
[22:09] covering the
[22:11] doctrine amen the
[22:13] fellowship the Clapping of the
[22:16] leaves the the fruits of the spirit Joy
[22:22] long suffering patience meekness amen
[22:26] restoring all of this back
[22:29] until we come to the to the to the final
[22:31] part of the
[22:33] restoration but what a lot of people
[22:35] don't
[22:37] understand and the prophet laid it out
[22:40] for us so that we wouldn't miss
[22:43] it is that the Pentecostal
[22:48] denomination or the people who started
[22:50] the Pentecostal
[22:53] denomination before the Revival
[22:56] began
[22:59] tells us in the
[23:00] resume uh uh the resume of the church
[23:04] ages that they knew by the
[23:08] scriptures there had there had to come a
[23:11] restoration and brother man calls it a
[23:14] final
[23:17] quickening for the
[23:19] Rapture and he said and they began to
[23:22] pray they begin to seek God for this
[23:26] final quickening
[23:29] and he said and what they
[23:31] thought was that
[23:35] came an anointing came and they began to
[23:39] speak in
[23:40] tongues they begin to operate in the
[23:44] spirit but brother bam said that was
[23:49] not listen close what the prophet laid
[23:52] out for
[23:53] us the restoration of the Bride tree
[23:57] said the same same thing he he said the
[24:00] same thing in many
[24:02] messages that was
[24:04] not the promise
[24:07] restoration that was not what the
[24:11] scriptures were in other words that
[24:13] wasn't the
[24:16] Fulfillment of Joel chapter
[24:19] 2 I will restore say the
[24:22] Lord that was not the Fulfillment of
[24:25] that because brother bam said
[24:29] order for it to come back in the full
[24:34] restoration of what the church was in
[24:38] Pentecost first the son of man
[24:42] Ministry has to come and reveal
[24:45] itself through the ministry of a
[24:48] prophet and laid out the doctrine of the
[24:52] word you see because brother what they
[24:56] thought was the restoration
[24:59] still to this day
[25:02] 2016 the Pentecostal
[25:05] denomination or the charismatic
[25:08] movement thinks they are
[25:12] fulfilling what Peter did and what Paul
[25:15] did and what Philip did and what
[25:18] happened in the in the upper
[25:20] room they're not fulfilling it I'm sorry
[25:23] but they're not
[25:25] fulfilling because if they fail in one
[25:28] part of
[25:29] it they fell in the whole thing they
[25:32] didn't have women preachers in the book
[25:34] of
[25:35] Acts they didn't have false gifts in the
[25:38] book of Acts they didn't have false
[25:40] teaching in the book of
[25:42] Acts brother they had straight direct
[25:45] Revelation from
[25:48] God why because the son of man Jesus
[25:52] Christ had laid out the word for
[25:56] them amen
[25:58] and they knew what they were believing
[26:01] in brother they they weren't going by
[26:05] emotions they weren't going by whatever
[26:08] thing everything has to follow the
[26:11] word and the continuity of the
[26:14] spirit we have been we have already
[26:17] spoke some prior Services two or
[26:21] three of the
[26:23] continuation how God is in the
[26:25] continuation of his program
[26:28] his program doesn't
[26:30] stop it's just
[26:32] interrupted and paused for a little
[26:35] bit but it
[26:37] continues with different
[26:40] people different scriptures being
[26:43] fulfilled but it's all one picture it's
[26:45] all one
[26:47] program understand that so brother bam
[26:51] tells
[26:52] us they didn't fulfill that
[26:56] restoration amen he says
[26:59] because they were so blind to
[27:02] see there was a lot of people he said
[27:07] participating in spiritual
[27:11] blessings and full of
[27:17] devu is that
[27:20] possible I have a demon in
[27:22] me and still receive and participate
[27:28] in spiritual blessings of the Holy
[27:33] Spirit yes
[27:36] amen and what shows us
[27:39] something now listen to me
[27:43] close what shows us that they didn't
[27:49] receive all of the gifts being restored
[27:51] to
[27:54] them his brother bam says one of the
[27:58] gifts is
[28:02] wisdom right we're going to get to that
[28:05] in a little B we're still trying to read
[28:07] James chapter
[28:11] 1 but brother bam said wisdom is a gift
[28:17] that is to be restored in the last
[28:19] days to the church in the Book of
[28:23] Revelation it says to him that has
[28:26] wisdom
[28:28] let them read the number of the
[28:31] Beast because it's the number of a man
[28:35] brother says see that scripture in
[28:38] Revelation that scripture is being
[28:42] directed to someone in the body of
[28:46] Christ that in the time of the
[28:50] restoration gifts were going to be fully
[28:55] restored what they had First Corinthians
[28:58] 12 it was going to be restored back into
[29:01] this restored church over
[29:05] here understand there's Gifts of wisdom
[29:08] there gift of faith there gift of
[29:12] Prophecy but brother said the gift of
[29:15] wisdom is wisdom to know the
[29:21] word amen so everybody says well the
[29:26] Pentecostals
[29:28] there were just the restoration of the
[29:31] gifts all the gifts were restored you
[29:34] know 50 years ago 60 100 years
[29:39] ago with with the
[29:42] Pentecost Street it was just the
[29:44] restoration of
[29:47] the don't take that
[29:52] light look at what the prophet said and
[29:55] he said it was not
[29:58] full
[30:02] restoration because if they would have
[30:04] had wish if the gift of wisdom would
[30:06] have been restored back
[30:09] there that gift of wisdom through the
[30:13] spirit would have said you women can't
[30:18] preach would have said in the
[30:21] service there can only be two or
[30:25] three amen
[30:28] prophesying and according to their
[30:31] course did that
[30:35] happen they had a bunch of stuff all
[30:38] over the
[30:39] place because the spirit the gift of
[30:42] wisdom had not been
[30:45] given you understand what I'm
[30:50] saying so just because some gifts were
[30:52] restored like tongues and interpretation
[30:55] and Faith and Healing
[31:02] langu
[31:04] interpretation Faith heal certain things
[31:07] like that was restored back there does
[31:11] it mean that they
[31:14] fulfilled the full
[31:18] restoration because the prophet tells us
[31:20] again I'm repeating again to get that
[31:23] deep into your heart let it settled in
[31:26] there
[31:29] that could not come until first God sent
[31:33] a prophet
[31:35] messenger amen bring the word tie in all
[31:39] the Loose
[31:40] Ends if the gift of wisdom would have
[31:43] been back
[31:44] there we're baptizing
[31:47] wrong in Jesus name that's wrong father
[31:52] son Holy Ghost it's
[31:55] wrong it's not just Jesus name there's
[31:59] many
[32:00] Jesus we have one in our
[32:05] church amen hallelujah you can't just
[32:07] baptize in the name of Jesus there's a
[32:09] lot of
[32:11] Jesus but the gift of wisdom set the
[32:13] thing in
[32:15] order Lord Jesus
[32:19] Christ father son holy
[32:22] spirit amen
[32:26] am this is this is what we have
[32:29] received we have received the
[32:32] ministry of a prophet to introduce us to
[32:36] the
[32:37] word pointing to the Messiah like we
[32:39] spoke
[32:41] Friday and then he stepped into the
[32:46] office of
[32:48] revealing what he was pointing
[32:51] to Amen to
[32:56] the and then after the ministry of
[33:00] Jesus when that Ministry was taken
[33:03] up left the
[33:05] scene amen then what was in
[33:09] him was
[33:11] divided among the body and that's the
[33:15] book of
[33:16] Acts so today I'm giving you my
[33:21] introduction today that's what we're
[33:23] going to speak on Friday we looked at
[33:28] Friday we looked at the book of
[33:31] Acts because brother bam said Christ in
[33:35] the true
[33:36] church is a
[33:40] continuation of the
[33:42] book of
[33:45] Acts everyone say
[33:47] Amen brother and I said this Friday I
[33:51] said we
[33:54] unconsciously interpret what the prophet
[33:58] said because that's how our mind
[34:01] thinks that's
[34:03] tradition when tradition
[34:06] refers to the book of Acts all you have
[34:10] in your
[34:11] mind is miracles signs
[34:16] wonders but but we showed
[34:20] Friday that the book of Acts not a
[34:25] chapter of the book
[34:27] not one verse of the
[34:29] book the
[34:31] book of
[34:34] Acts is what is in continuation
[34:38] today in other words not just chapter
[34:43] two just chapter
[34:45] three oh the book of Acts is not only
[34:50] signs and miracles and and
[34:53] shouting no no the book of Acts an the
[34:57] angel of the Lord coming to Peter and
[35:01] saying go
[35:02] here amen the book of Acts shows
[35:07] us jealousy amongst the
[35:11] church amen amen the Greek
[35:16] women said look at the
[35:21] apost
[35:25] churching that's in the book of
[35:32] that they think they're
[35:44] so the church is
[35:49] treating
[35:55] Widow
[36:04] that's amen there was a problem in the
[36:08] Church
[36:09] of read the
[36:12] Bible if we're talking about the book of
[36:15] Acts I would
[36:17] suggest for us to
[36:19] read amen
[36:23] amen and when you read that in the Bible
[36:26] Bible says the apostles
[36:28] came said okay there's a
[36:33] problem but you know what they
[36:36] said they said it's not our
[36:42] business the preachers are saying is not
[36:45] their
[36:49] business that's what the Bible
[36:51] says it's not our
[36:54] business to leave praying
[36:58] the ministry of the
[37:01] word to attend
[37:03] to
[37:06] issues choose among
[37:09] yourselves seven Men full of the Holy
[37:15] Ghost to attend to these
[37:18] things and we will dedicate ourselves to
[37:23] praying and the ministry of the word
[37:27] God and the Bible says in the book of
[37:30] Acts the word of God
[37:34] increased in those
[37:37] days in other words the word that they
[37:41] had
[37:42] received the Revelation was getting
[37:45] more and more and more isn't that what
[37:49] we're seeing
[37:51] today isn't that what we're seeing that
[37:53] the message that we have
[37:55] received
[37:57] spirit is not bringing another
[38:00] message it's not giving a different
[38:03] thing it's a
[38:07] continuation God dealt with
[38:10] Abraham right he called
[38:12] Abraham is that
[38:15] right but when Abraham
[38:22] left amen amen and the Bible says and
[38:27] Isaac was led by God to go back into the
[38:32] wells that his father
[38:36] had but after his father
[38:39] died the philes had come and they had
[38:43] covered all these Wells with
[38:45] dirt stuffed them all
[38:48] up Isaac let other spirit said this is
[38:51] where the well
[38:53] was let's dig it up
[38:55] again hallelujah hallelujah that the
[38:57] water start flowing
[38:59] again what does that tell you that God
[39:02] sent us a prophet but after he left amen
[39:06] demonic
[39:08] spirits cover up certain
[39:11] parts of the well of the
[39:13] word so that the word won't flow into
[39:16] the
[39:17] people and have its
[39:19] effect but there's got to be somebody
[39:23] let the spirit to find those places
[39:27] and dig in there dig into the word dig
[39:31] into the
[39:33] word amen and the water starts
[39:37] flowing is it something different no
[39:40] it's the same
[39:47] thing when
[39:50] died
[39:54] stop he met
[39:58] Jacob out there in the desert he wrest
[40:01] with this Mighty Angel he changed his
[40:04] name and he changed his
[40:07] walk hallelujah hallelujah amen he met
[40:10] God face to
[40:12] face and he said this is
[40:15] p I'll call this place
[40:18] pel
[40:19] means the of
[40:22] God we seen the of
[40:25] God
[40:27] CL and show his
[40:30] face amen but you got to meet him not
[40:34] looking at him in the
[40:37] picture you got to meet that
[40:40] person
[40:42] amen but God didn't stop there with
[40:45] Jacob amen he came to Moses is that
[40:49] right it wasn't a different message it
[40:53] wasn't a different
[40:55] program wasn't in a different
[40:57] Spirit it was the same word continuing
[41:00] on and on and
[41:04] on and he came to Moses he said I am the
[41:07] god of Abraham Isaac and of
[41:10] Jacob but now I'm your God
[41:13] to Hallelujah Hallelujah I wasn't just
[41:16] Abraham's
[41:18] God I was Isaac's God
[41:21] too I wasn't just Isaac's
[41:24] God I was Jacob's God
[41:28] too
[41:29] [Applause]
[41:30] amen I wasn't just Jacob's God I'm your
[41:35] God is that right and the and the
[41:38] prophecies
[41:40] continued and the word
[41:42] continued amen and then when God was
[41:45] going to take
[41:46] Moses he said now you Joshua you take
[41:50] this word and you keep
[41:53] going Hallelujah is that right and then
[41:56] when Moses
[41:58] died and when Joshua
[42:01] died we had all kinds of
[42:15] people I
[42:17] believe I
[42:19] believe brother told us in the message
[42:21] the
[42:23] absolute it was a time where everyone
[42:27] did what they thought was right in
[42:31] their but we need an
[42:36] absolute amen God continues
[42:40] friends then he called
[42:42] Samuel since a child heard the voice of
[42:47] God well we need to wait until the
[42:49] children grow
[42:52] brother they need to grow to have
[42:57] experience or it's your
[43:00] accountability it's your duty to train
[43:03] them in the
[43:06] Lord to take them like
[43:09] Anna and dedicate them to God not just
[43:13] in one service here
[43:16] Lord no that's a continual
[43:19] thing brother bam said lift your
[43:22] children before God In
[43:25] Prayer
[43:26] amen
[43:28] amen
[43:31] [Music]
[43:33] instu put them in service do let them do
[43:37] something like Samuel little boy serving
[43:43] there amen since a child serving
[43:50] in then he heard the voice of
[43:54] God that means that that means Joshua
[43:57] right here can hear the voice
[43:59] [Music]
[44:00] of we say it all the
[44:04] time Jesus Christ
[44:10] yesterday our
[44:11] con the way we look at reality is not
[44:14] that
[44:17] way amen those things come strange to us
[44:22] what no no no you know teenager yeah I
[44:25] can
[44:29] after he has smoked some
[44:31] weed drunk some
[44:34] beer scho a couple
[44:37] times then I can believe
[44:41] God
[44:45] something that's not that's not the
[44:48] Bible although that is the
[44:50] case
[44:53] also the scripture can identify children
[44:58] children
[45:00] teenagers like Mary 16 years
[45:04] old also heard the voice of the same
[45:09] Angel
[45:11] amen
[45:13] hallelujah young
[45:20] mened
[45:24] Allelujah heard
[45:26] fathers heard it mothers heard
[45:30] it amen
[45:33] amen so brother and
[45:37] sister what I'm saying
[45:40] is when we look at the
[45:44] continuation we
[45:46] find what God is doing right
[45:50] now when we find what he's doing
[45:54] now
[45:56] we we see it in the
[45:59] word we can say this is being fulfilled
[46:02] this
[46:04] day this is the word this is God in
[46:08] action his own
[46:10] word so let us read James
[46:16] 1 verse
[46:18] 17 every good gift and every perfect
[46:20] gift is from above and cometh down from
[46:23] the Father of Lights
[46:26] with whom is no variableness neither
[46:29] shadow of turning James
[46:44] 17 amen
[46:47] amen we read in
[46:52] Ephesians the same one that
[46:54] descended
[46:57] also ascended on
[46:58] high as he ascended on
[47:01] high he sent back the
[47:05] holy
[47:07] amen but this is what we got to
[47:11] understand let me read a port of the
[47:14] Prophet
[47:15] here because we're we're in the
[47:18] continuation of the book of
[47:21] Acts amen we looking at that
[47:26] but our
[47:29] inspiration our subject
[47:33] today is one
[47:36] giver and many
[47:39] gifts one
[47:41] Giver many
[47:43] gifts and these many gifts like we
[47:46] already
[47:47] said has been given a
[47:49] measure of that one
[47:52] Spirit to bring the unity of the
[47:56] Faith to bring all of
[48:00] us unto the
[48:04] fullness is that what we read in the
[48:08] Bible I'm not making this
[48:10] up this is the
[48:13] message am now watch
[48:15] this in the message The Works that I
[48:19] bear The Works that I do bear witness of
[48:22] me it's like the title of brother B's
[48:24] message
[48:33] 1951 he says so friends find Divine love
[48:37] and favor with
[48:43] God if he finds favor with
[48:49] you will give his gifts into
[48:53] you but first
[48:56] find The
[48:58] Giver in other
[49:01] words people
[49:03] think that if we're going to start
[49:06] preaching about
[49:08] gifts if we're going to start talking
[49:10] about the
[49:11] body and the many gifts that are in the
[49:14] body and God restoring that
[49:18] back
[49:20] then they think in their carnal mind
[49:25] that we're trying to make
[49:30] people do certain
[49:33] things just because we're
[49:37] preaching and that's not what we're
[49:40] saying we're showing
[49:43] you the the
[49:45] message and its
[49:47] purpose and what it's supposed to do in
[49:51] US is supposed to make us like that
[49:55] first church over
[49:57] there amen and that first church over
[50:01] there had all nine
[50:07] gifts that church over
[50:11] there just had
[50:14] pastors maybe one Prophet or
[50:18] two maybe one evangelist here
[50:24] one
[50:26] a fivefold
[50:29] Ministry see and in the book of Acts let
[50:33] me lay this out right here before it
[50:34] goes
[50:36] away in the book of Acts we read it uh
[50:41] we read it
[50:45] Friday remember in Acts
[50:50] three
[50:52] they that's Peter spoke the
[50:57] word he didn't have to
[50:59] cry he
[51:05] spoke and that's when all hell broke
[51:09] loose remember what we said
[51:12] Friday and we read the
[51:14] quote showing you that all the
[51:18] attraction was in the son of
[51:23] man that was the attraction
[51:26] and all the
[51:28] demons had their
[51:30] guns pointed at the son of
[51:33] man when the son of man
[51:35] come to
[51:38] gadar amen the demon
[51:42] Scream the
[51:44] demons and said oh th Son of God why
[51:48] Thou come before time to torment
[51:51] Us in other words all of them demons
[51:54] knew
[51:56] see but he wasn't the only one there
[51:59] Peter was with him John was with him the
[52:03] disciples were with
[52:04] him but show me in the
[52:07] scripture One Time Peter was thrown into
[52:12] prison when Jesus was alive show me one
[52:16] time Peter getting
[52:20] beat amen and persecuted when Jesus was
[52:24] alive no because the
[52:28] attention was on
[52:30] Jesus the demons wanted to kill
[52:34] Jesus amen the demons were after
[52:37] Jesus
[52:39] amen but when he
[52:41] left amen all of those
[52:44] guns that were pointing to
[52:47] Jesus said he left so who's
[52:51] left when
[52:53] Saul amen was persec in the
[52:56] church binding the church locking them
[53:00] up in
[53:01] prison amen the pillar of fire met him
[53:06] and said why you were persecuting
[53:12] me he didn't say why are you persecuting
[53:16] my
[53:18] church he didn't say why you persecuting
[53:21] the brother over there and the brother
[53:22] over
[53:24] here Jesus said through the pillar of
[53:27] fire why you persecuting
[53:31] me because I am in my
[53:36] body persecute
[53:39] them
[53:42] me is that right
[53:45] Amen brother and sister this is a
[53:49] continuation have we received the John
[53:51] the Baptist
[53:54] ministry
[53:55] have we received the son of man
[53:58] Ministry did he come to lay out the word
[54:01] establish and restore all
[54:06] things
[54:09] amen but notice
[54:13] this brother says don't start seeking
[54:17] for
[54:24] gifts
[54:25] I'll do
[54:27] this brother B said the Pentecostal
[54:29] Church failed
[54:36] miserably I make you a
[54:41] prophet I anoint this brother
[54:44] here with the gift
[54:54] of I said where is that in the
[54:58] scripture where is that in the Bible
[55:01] show me where Peter did that where Paul
[55:04] did that where James did
[55:07] that Paul told Timothy the
[55:11] elders laid hands on you
[55:14] Timothy when
[55:24] theyned
[55:26] ordination laying on of hands is not
[55:29] that we are ordaining
[55:31] him he say God has to call him God has
[55:35] to ordain him and he is already that in
[55:40] the mind of God nobody has made
[55:45] something
[55:49] be
[55:52] amen that's where the church
[55:56] because you had people trying to be
[55:59] something and do something that they
[56:00] called to
[56:04] do amen and because of that way they
[56:09] went then they got to interpret the
[56:11] scriptures a different
[56:15] way so don't seek
[56:19] gifts look for
[56:22] the SE The Giver
[56:26] amen then the
[56:29] gifts will come as God sees fit to give
[56:32] it to
[56:35] you he said do you believe that we pass
[56:39] over those
[56:40] things these great words that we learn
[56:43] and things that we do with gifts and
[56:48] everything that's fine but you better
[56:51] get the
[56:52] giver before you start after the
[56:57] gifts amen get the Holy
[57:02] Ghost oh brother but I want to know
[57:05] about this I want to understand
[57:09] more get the Holy Ghost he'll make you
[57:12] understand
[57:13] amen St John 16 the spirit of truth will
[57:18] teach you and brother mam said in the
[57:21] church ages it's the inside teacher
[57:25] amen hallelujah hallelujah that will
[57:27] teach us all
[57:30] things and it will remind
[57:34] us now watch brother says in the message
[57:38] gifts and callings are without
[57:42] repentance a man is just a
[57:45] man until he's fully submitted to
[57:53] God holy
[57:56] spiritu not the man but God in the man
[57:59] does the
[58:00] work now listen to this so Jesus when he
[58:04] come he was a man born of a
[58:07] virgin his mother was married his father
[58:09] was Jehovah
[58:11] God you believe that in that body God
[58:16] dwelt God was hidden Christ reconciling
[58:18] the world to
[58:20] himself Jesus said it's not me that do
[58:23] the works it's my father that dwelt in
[58:26] he does the work and that was God
[58:29] speaking through mortal
[58:31] lips that could raise the
[58:33] death steal the
[58:35] waters and so forth then he ascended on
[58:39] high and he gave gifts to men one man
[58:43] received a great gift of
[58:45] healing so the people that laid in his
[58:53] shadow
[58:55] brother
[58:56] bam tell us we don't need Peter or his
[59:02] shadow we need the God that was
[59:06] in
[59:11] us he says and then in the
[59:16] same he gave one another one and they
[59:20] taken a chest from his body and aprons
[59:22] and laid them upon the sick
[59:27] and every e and evil spirits went out of
[59:29] the
[59:30] people not because it was St Paul he was
[59:33] a man who lived in flesh like you and
[59:36] I and he died and he had to be Redeemed
[59:40] by the blood of Christ just like we
[59:43] do I'm quoting the
[59:46] prophet it wasn't the man that done the
[59:49] healing it was the spirit of God in the
[59:51] man that done the
[59:53] healing to the faith of the people is
[59:56] that
[59:57] right but the same holy
[59:59] spirit with us today amen Jesus said
[1:00:03] I'll be with you to you to the end of
[1:00:05] the
[1:00:08] world hallelujah
[1:00:10] amen believe
[1:00:13] that now watch
[1:00:15] this 1951 as I was with
[1:00:20] Moses he says when Jesus of
[1:00:23] Nazareth I believe the father was in
[1:00:27] him all that great
[1:00:32] things that the father that was the
[1:00:37] fathers was given unto his
[1:00:39] son all the great
[1:00:42] blessings and gifts for he was just the
[1:00:46] express image of the
[1:00:48] father and in him in Jesus dwelt all the
[1:00:53] riches of God dwelling in him he said I
[1:00:58] am my father one and my father dwelleth
[1:01:01] in
[1:01:02] me amen amen it's not me that does the
[1:01:06] works it's the father that dwelleth in
[1:01:09] me he does the works that's what Jesus
[1:01:13] said listen to this and he Jesus had all
[1:01:20] those fine
[1:01:23] gifts at his command amen but when Satan
[1:01:27] found him in the wilderness he didn't
[1:01:31] use those
[1:01:33] gift Satan said if thou be the Son of
[1:01:36] God change the stones to
[1:01:39] bread turn them into bread and
[1:01:42] eat you're
[1:01:43] hungry he said it is
[1:01:47] written amen use the
[1:01:51] word right now what
[1:01:55] watch faith without works is
[1:01:58] dead and
[1:02:00] listen this is the initial this is
[1:02:07] 1953 you know that the word of
[1:02:10] God will defeat
[1:02:12] Satan anywhere any time on any
[1:02:17] condition is that right when Jesus was
[1:02:21] here on
[1:02:22] Earth all the great
[1:02:25] gifts that was in heaven he had them
[1:02:30] right with with him
[1:02:32] amen now I'm trying to show you
[1:02:34] something I'm not making this
[1:02:40] up brother V is showing
[1:02:43] us that when the fullness of
[1:02:46] God was in
[1:02:48] Jesus are you listening what was that
[1:02:53] that was the revealing
[1:02:55] of the son of
[1:02:57] man in the ministry of Jesus
[1:03:00] Christ from
[1:03:03] Jord to the
[1:03:06] resurrection is the
[1:03:08] ministry of the son of man that is the
[1:03:13] fullness of God in one
[1:03:17] man Hallelujah you understand
[1:03:20] Hallelujah

[1:13:12] country say she came up to
[1:13:15] me didn't know my

[1:13:47] I'm that after that Ministry is off
[1:13:52] to according to the
[1:13:54] message that is to be
[1:13:58] loosed amongst many
[1:14:05] members it not all
[1:14:08] [Music]
[1:14:09] be all be
[1:14:11] in
[1:14:13] or but each one is given a
[1:14:17] measure each one is given a
[1:14:22] calling
[1:14:24] you
[1:14:25] understand me let me read another
[1:14:29] quote so far I've read about four or
[1:14:32] five quotes
[1:14:35] one one
[1:14:38] two
[1:14:43] three here's another
[1:14:47] one four I read this
[1:14:49] one when Jesus was here on Earth all the
[1:14:52] great gifts that was in heaven
[1:15:01] God's great gifts always find their
[1:15:05] places
[1:15:07] 1963 he says all right anointed him with
[1:15:12] mer we find out now in in John
[1:15:17] 121 and seven and that's exactly what he
[1:15:21] done listen to
[1:15:24] talking about
[1:15:25] Jesus he was the perfect servant of
[1:15:30] God and had him
[1:15:34] Anointed with all of his Divine
[1:15:39] gifts God anointed
[1:15:42] Jesus with all his Divine
[1:15:45] GI he was anointed with all of God's
[1:15:49] gifts because he was
[1:15:52] Goden
[1:15:54] Hallelujah now when all of the when that
[1:15:58] anointing of all of the gifts come to
[1:16:02] anoint William
[1:16:03] brand it was to
[1:16:06] reveal that same
[1:16:08] God not that he was
[1:16:11] God was to reveal to us that that same
[1:16:16] God was here to fulfill his
[1:16:20] word you understand that amen now let me
[1:16:24] show I've taken about hour
[1:16:30] already and I finally laid something
[1:16:34] out you
[1:16:36] see Hallelujah you see that after the
[1:16:40] ministry of the son of man went
[1:16:43] up what was in
[1:16:46] him was
[1:16:48] divided in many
[1:16:51] gifts but it was all
[1:16:53] all in one
[1:16:56] Giver at one
[1:16:59] time the father and
[1:17:01] Heaven all that was in God he poured
[1:17:05] into
[1:17:06] Christ amen every good and perfect
[1:17:10] gift comes
[1:17:13] down from the father of
[1:17:16] light and it came down from the father
[1:17:19] of
[1:17:20] light in
[1:17:22] Jesus in him but when he went up
[1:17:26] Hallelujah all that was in him was
[1:17:31] divided into the body of many members a
[1:17:36] portion a measure in this one a measure
[1:17:38] in this one another measure in this one
[1:17:40] and that
[1:17:41] one but what's the purpose of
[1:17:44] that it's for the working of the
[1:17:48] ministry until we all
[1:17:50] come into the stature
[1:17:53] of the per of the perfect
[1:17:56] man
[1:18:00] the so if all of those gifts were
[1:18:04] restored to the Pentecostal
[1:18:07] denomination they would have came out
[1:18:10] with
[1:18:11] Christians in the St of
[1:18:16] a they would have came out with a
[1:18:20] thousand William
[1:18:21] brandom
[1:18:23] and said this is the
[1:18:25] evidence this is the
[1:18:28] sons of our
[1:18:30] Revelation that all the gifts are in
[1:18:32] their
[1:18:33] place this is the
[1:18:35] product men and
[1:18:38] women in the St of Christ but it's not
[1:18:42] so but let me tell you it's got to be so
[1:18:46] with this
[1:18:49] now because the first
[1:18:51] grain the first one has already got
[1:18:56] there and I believe there's been
[1:19:00] others have reached that
[1:19:04] place but it's not just when brother
[1:19:07] Bram gets
[1:19:08] there because he got there a long time
[1:19:12] ago it's not just when another brother
[1:19:15] over here gets there or another person
[1:19:17] over
[1:19:21] herei amen 13 says until we
[1:19:27] all get
[1:19:31] there and all is in God's
[1:19:36] definition not mine or anybody
[1:19:38] else all getting to that statue of a
[1:19:42] perfect
[1:19:43] man is the predestinated
[1:19:48] ones because he's not when he says all
[1:19:51] he knows what he's talking about
[1:19:55] that's in his
[1:19:57] context that's in his
[1:19:59] choosing amen amen because if if we say
[1:20:04] all and we want to include
[1:20:07] everybody then you're not reading it
[1:20:10] right but
[1:20:12] all that he
[1:20:14] predestinated to come to the Statue of a
[1:20:17] perfect
[1:20:20] man those are the ones whose names are
[1:20:22] Lamb's Book of
[1:20:25] Life those are the ones as we read the
[1:20:29] other day that if this
[1:20:33] church is
[1:20:35] expecting to be alive when Jesus
[1:20:39] comes to take his bride away she needs
[1:20:43] the
[1:20:44] token amen and the
[1:20:47] token hallelujah what will perform the
[1:20:51] paradox is what is needed in this
[1:20:55] hour for that
[1:20:58] per now
[1:21:03] watch to show
[1:21:06] you very
[1:21:08] perfectly through the
[1:21:11] word that we are in another book of
[1:21:16] Acts we are in the
[1:21:19] season for the full restoration of brive
[1:21:22] tree
[1:21:24] in the Rapture message brother said this
[1:21:28] is Luke
[1:21:31] 173 this is Malachi four
[1:21:33] time he said this is fruit bearing
[1:21:38] time hallelujah hallelujah this is the
[1:21:40] season that we're
[1:21:42] in amen
[1:21:44] amen and he told us in anointed ones at
[1:21:47] the end
[1:21:48] time that there's a lot of different
[1:21:51] branches
[1:21:53] that are have been
[1:21:56] grafted into the main
[1:21:58] Vine but they're not
[1:22:03] original amen they're just living off
[1:22:06] the
[1:22:08] name and the life and the
[1:22:11] source of the vine but they're giving
[1:22:14] different
[1:22:16] fruits he said but there is an
[1:22:21] original amen
[1:22:23] the ones that the vine puts
[1:22:27] out the vine didn't put out all the
[1:22:31] different uh uh
[1:22:34] tangerines and
[1:22:36] grapefruits amen
[1:22:39] mandarines no right the vine when it
[1:22:45] pushed
[1:22:46] out it pushed out a
[1:22:49] branch of
[1:22:51] oranges
[1:22:53] right that's the one that the vine
[1:22:56] pushed
[1:22:58] out but in that
[1:23:01] [Applause]
[1:23:02] tree
[1:23:05] theine got a
[1:23:07] branch from a different
[1:23:10] tree went in
[1:23:12] there and grafted into the
[1:23:16] tree now that branch is
[1:23:20] connected to this line
[1:23:23] and it's sucking
[1:23:25] life but the
[1:23:28] fruits can't be any other kind of
[1:23:32] fruit it's not
[1:23:34] oranges just because it's connected to
[1:23:37] this doesn't give
[1:23:39] oranges it gives the seed that it
[1:23:43] is the vine doesn't change the
[1:23:48] SE the rain falling on the tree doesn't
[1:23:52] change the
[1:23:56] fruit the seed is the
[1:23:59] seed Amen
[1:24:05] brother ever put out another
[1:24:08] brch it will write another book of
[1:24:15] Acts in other words it won't just have
[1:24:19] one
[1:24:21] chapter
[1:24:23] huj brother bam said that's the
[1:24:24] Pentecostal
[1:24:26] denomination Acts 2 and 4 Acts 2 and 4
[1:24:29] Acts 2 and
[1:24:32] 4 he says and then the preachers turn
[1:24:35] into two
[1:24:39] by how many know what 24
[1:24:42] is amen that's what brother said it says
[1:24:46] all they preach is Acts 2 and 4 Acts 2
[1:24:48] and
[1:24:50] 4 the holy came down there
[1:24:54] Pentecost they were all the Holy Ghost
[1:24:57] they all begin to speak in tongu as the
[1:24:58] spirit gave them
[1:25:01] utterance 2 ands 2
[1:25:04] and they turn into a
[1:25:07] 2 and they hit people

[1:25:27] that Peter came to the gate

[1:25:59] pray he spoke where did he get that from
[1:26:03] who was that that was Jesus that
[1:26:08] wasn't that was what was in that son of
[1:26:11] man when it was divided amongst his body

[1:26:17] that one of his
[1:26:20] members hallelujah hallelujah
[1:26:22] Jesus is the one that told the
[1:26:25] woman amen your daughter is healed he's

[1:29:28] off when when they draw
[1:29:32] attention after the son of man has
[1:29:35] left the
[1:29:37] attention it's not a one man
[1:29:41] thing the message that we

[1:29:48] onean
[1:29:50] message amen

[1:44:15] to the bride will have to stop
[1:44:19] preaching for the
[1:44:22] is demanding the mark in the hand or

[1:45:31] of Acts covers more than 30
[1:45:35] years and within those 30 years of the
[1:45:39] book of Acts is where Paul wrote all his
[1:45:43] Epistles is where James wrote his
[1:45:46] epistle is where Titus received his
[1:45:49] letter
[1:45:52] in other words what I'm saying is all of
[1:45:55] the New
[1:45:59] Testament except a few Epistles like
[1:46:04] John
[1:46:06] Revelations were all
[1:46:09] written and
[1:46:11] given within the book of

[1:47:51] you know that Spirit still
[1:48:02] Liv
[1:48:05] amen it's not everybody rallying around

[1:48:15] body operating what God called them to
[1:48:19] do
[1:48:22] amen not everybody is
[1:48:25] called for one thing

[1:48:35] the
[1:48:37] same caral
[1:48:40] people will say I like how he preaches
[1:48:43] better
[1:48:48] than read the book of
[1:48:51] Corinthians said some say I'm of
[1:48:55] Apollo I'm of this one
[1:48:58] I'm
[1:49:01] nonsense childish things wake up grow up

[1:49:12] continuation and it comes from the
[1:49:15] head all the way down to the feet
[1:49:18] Hallelujah but everything
[1:49:20] has to be in in
[1:49:23] connection with the mind of

[1:49:34] morning just this
[1:49:36] week I found a

[1:50:28] same
[1:50:37] amans
[1:50:39] tells Paul when he
[1:50:41] wasted went to the the pillar of fire
[1:50:46] revealed to him the
[1:50:48] scures he came out
[1:50:50] preaching baptism in the name of Jesus

[1:50:56] things and him and Peter
[1:51:00] met says preaching the same

[1:52:23] something trying to get something across
[1:52:24] and the body's going all kinds of
[1:52:26] different
[1:52:29] direction did the head
