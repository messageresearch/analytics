[8:21] PR heavenly
[8:23] father thank you Lord
[8:26] God the reading of this second
[8:32] Psalm believe it's your Eternal
[8:37] Word as your Prophet has showed us Lord
[8:40] we can see it through the
[8:45] scripture it's impossible
[8:50] humanly for
[8:53] men that
[8:55] wrote
[8:57] scriptures holy men of
[9:00] God holy sages and
[9:05] Sears move Lord to write
[9:09] this hundreds and hundreds of years
[9:16] apart one from
[9:19] another and they all lived in their day
[9:22] and their
[9:24] generation they all Liv their time and
[9:27] lived out the word that you lot it for
[9:33] them but yet it's all in
[9:38] agreement it all comes
[9:43] together Lord It's Your Holy
[9:48] Spirit we can see that
[9:51] today after the prophet
[9:56] Liv years before us
[10:00] spoke
[10:03] things we can see that your holy spirit
[10:07] amen taking that word
[10:10] father quickening it to our
[10:13] hearts bringing us into the same
[10:16] channel of inspiration under the same
[10:19] anointing
[10:22] father this eternal
[10:24] word yes Lord we thank you
[10:27] for ask that you bless your word
[10:29] word to every
[10:32] heart and may this time Lord that you
[10:36] have exhorted us this
[10:41] Friday
[10:44] consecration as we Endeavor father
[10:49] today with your
[10:51] word May the people father your
[10:55] children receive it
[10:58] Lord
[11:00] through your Holy
[11:02] Spirit In The Name Of The Lord Jesus
[11:06] Christ
[11:07] amen May
[11:20] seated turn with
[11:23] me to the book
[11:27] ofs
[11:29] we mentioned
[11:33] Friday how
[11:37] that we were in the book of
[11:40] Acts is that right the Lord is leading
[11:44] Us in
[11:45] this in this line of
[11:50] inspiration and today we are speaking on
[11:54] the book of Acts
[11:57] again and this would be the second part
[12:00] of
[12:04] consecration we began
[12:07] Friday recorded it's on
[12:10] there and this would be the second
[12:13] part where I believe the holy
[12:16] spirit is really going to make it
[12:20] clear and see the
[12:23] connection and we have already spoke
[12:27] Friday what consecration has to
[12:30] do with us in this
[12:32] hour why it's
[12:35] needed and the pattern in the
[12:38] scripture has been
[12:41] always it was the consecration
[12:44] first before the miraculous can take
[12:48] place there was a
[12:51] consecration there was a burn
[12:53] offering there was something uh that was
[12:57] done
[12:59] that the
[13:00] people had to
[13:03] do they had to get in
[13:05] condition they had to get in line with
[13:10] God how many
[13:12] believe and
[13:14] know that one of the things that was
[13:18] revealed in the book of
[13:21] Acts it was revealed to Peter when he
[13:25] went to the
[13:27] Gentiles and that was that God is no
[13:29] respector of
[13:33] person that's a great
[13:36] Revelation that sometimes people
[13:39] think that just because they're the
[13:41] called out
[13:43] people just because they have received
[13:46] the message of a
[13:48] prophet just because they
[13:52] know certain things in the
[13:56] scriptures that denominations don't know
[14:00] and God has by his grace brought us out
[14:03] of
[14:04] that and has given us this word
[14:11] revealed sometimes we
[14:14] think that that makes
[14:18] us
[14:19] somewhat that
[14:23] God is
[14:26] obligated to us
[14:30] brother Adam said God is only obligated
[14:32] to his
[14:35] word
[14:38] amen and if you are part of that
[14:41] word you're going to line up with
[14:48] the that's why brother
[14:52] said the
[14:54] Dynamics to the
[14:57] mechanics said his husband and
[15:02] wife he said his head to the
[15:05] body I don't know if I'm going to be
[15:07] able to get to
[15:10] that we're going to
[15:12] try and it all
[15:15] depends
[15:23] reive because this is this is a serious
[15:27] hour
[15:32] and this
[15:36] consecration as we already made it clear
[15:42] Friday something that we read already in
[15:46] in the
[15:49] quotes and it's reported
[15:53] there where we see the
[15:57] prophet
[16:02] speaking of this consecration that is
[16:06] needed in his own
[16:10] lifeu even after he has seen God do many
[16:15] things even after he has given him the
[16:18] power to speak things into
[16:21] existence even after he has opened up
[16:24] the Seven Seals to
[16:26] him and has revealed to him amen the
[16:31] trumpets in The Sixth
[16:33] Seal even after he has opened up the
[16:35] whole
[16:37] scripture the whole revelation of the of
[16:39] the
[16:40] Bible after all of
[16:42] that he finds
[16:45] himself wanting a
[16:49] consecration brother brandom
[16:55] used many
[16:57] times
[16:59] a consecration
[17:02] [Music]
[17:03] service
[17:06] heu he called it in other
[17:10] times a time of
[17:16] consecration
[17:19] Church
[17:20] Hallelujah the Bible
[17:23] speaks of
[17:27] consecration
[17:28] in The Book of
[17:32] Leviticus the
[17:33] Levites were told by the word of the
[17:37] lordes the
[17:40] prophet
[17:41] amen that they were to consecrate
[17:48] themselves they had to consecrate
[17:54] themselves in order to come into the
[17:56] service of the Lord
[18:00] in the
[18:01] Tabernacle they had to
[18:04] consecrate that was a word that God
[18:09] gave to
[18:11] Moses so that those that would go into
[18:14] the
[18:15] temple to those that like
[18:19] us that are coming to
[18:22] service the service is for
[18:26] God the service that we're
[18:29] am is for
[18:31] God that's why brother said in church
[18:36] order amen am he says everything that
[18:39] you
[18:41] do in the
[18:43] Tabernacle don't do it like for
[18:46] me for
[18:49] brother amen it's for
[18:52] godu
[18:55] Hallelujah this is our service
[18:59] to
[19:00] God he has called
[19:02] us by his grace his word
[19:07] amen
[19:11] but when we lose
[19:15] sight and we don't know how to apply
[19:19] what God has given
[19:23] us apply it it amen to our lives and
[19:31] correctly amen because when we don't
[19:34] apply the word the message
[19:38] correctly listen to this you can be
[19:41] quoting
[19:43] scripture and you can be quoting
[19:46] messages but not applying it
[19:52] correctly remember some time ago we
[19:55] spoke on the law the laws of Revival
[20:00] how many remember
[20:01] that and we spoke about the days of
[20:06] Samuel
[20:08] amen and brother Ram said there's
[20:13] laws for
[20:15] Revival
[20:17] amen see you can do things without the
[20:21] law Lord has set laws in his
[20:24] word you can do it without following
[20:28] those
[20:30] things but it won't be the will of
[20:33] God it won't be the
[20:36] season you won't be the
[20:38] person and you not you're not Consulting
[20:41] the
[20:44] prophet
[20:46] see and
[20:49] therefore all going
[20:57] cause amen Amen brother said that has
[21:00] been the
[21:02] ccle of the
[21:06] church am that's
[21:09] the of Revival and
[21:12] death all through the
[21:14] church you see in the
[21:18] Bible
[21:20] same one time there serving God
[21:24] tremendous then they fall back down
[21:27] again and gods
[21:30] him come back
[21:45] again even this church right
[21:48] here the book of
[21:51] Acts said that's why that Ephesus
[21:56] Church was rebuked
[21:58] yes
[22:00] Christ amen amen go back to the first
[22:04] Works do the first
[22:07] thing amen you have lost your first
[22:13] love because they were at they were
[22:16] going in a certain
[22:19] speed they were going at a certain Pace
[22:22] with
[22:24] God amen amen being led by God
[22:28] God is in full
[22:30] control but then different
[22:34] interpretations different
[22:37] circumstances different
[22:42] ideas
[22:45] stop slow it
[22:49] down
[22:52] finally what they
[22:54] had no longer
[22:56] there yes
[22:58] Hallelujah but remember the days of
[23:00] Samuel just just to get into this just
[23:04] to get into this inspiration
[23:12] here when the
[23:17] Philistines
[23:19] had
[23:22] taken this power away from
[23:26] Israel remember
[23:35] El the man talks about the book of
[23:38] Samuel the message rejected
[23:43] King he talks about Samuel as a
[23:56] boyar
[23:59] before the the child could even know
[24:02] what that
[24:04] was God was already amen
[24:08] speaking hallelujah hallelujah he was
[24:11] born a
[24:13] prophet remember we went through that
[24:17] teaching showing how what time he was
[24:20] born Israel was in
[24:25] Wars when he would he begin to be
[24:27] brought up as a as a boy
[24:32] prophesy none of his
[24:34] prophecies brought allowed to fall
[24:39] to and then he prophesied as a
[24:43] child amen amen he
[24:47] prophesied as a older as older
[24:51] boy amen he saw the
[24:55] corruption that was happening with Eli's
[24:58] son
[25:01] amen we know what
[25:03] happened with one of their
[25:08] child with one of their
[25:10] children they
[25:12] had what his name
[25:15] was mentions that all the
[25:19] time but we just we just take it for
[25:22] granted and say ohab means the glory has
[25:26] Departed
[25:29] where does it where is that mentioned in
[25:31] the
[25:32] bible brother said this age of
[25:39] Le amen he said in the message know it
[25:42] not when God raises me up in the
[25:46] anointing and I look at the
[25:49] denominations I
[25:52] see the age of
[25:56] Le the nation
[26:01] but where is that where did he get that
[26:05] from where is the prophet where did he
[26:08] learn
[26:10] that in the book of
[26:13] Sam that's what one of the child's name
[26:18] was because that was the time the Bible
[26:22] says the
[26:24] candlesticks in the temple went out
[26:29] that's a type of the seven Church
[26:34] ages amen was passing away the glory
[26:39] departs from the Pentecostal Church
[26:43] from amen and the glory is with the
[26:48] prophet speaking the
[26:52] word we went through all of that
[26:56] amen
[27:00] in the laws of
[27:03] Revival but what I want to what I want
[27:06] you to see really
[27:08] quick is that in those
[27:17] days the Bible says that Israel tried to
[27:20] go against the
[27:24] philes and 3,000 died
[27:29] because the
[27:31] Lord was not
[27:33] with amen so when that
[27:36] happened the Bible says in the book of
[27:40] Samuel that the
[27:42] elders got
[27:45] together they weren't just
[27:47] anybody there were Elders of
[27:52] Israel they got together and they said
[27:55] what are we going to do
[28:00] this is
[28:02] why it doesn't
[28:07] matter what we know of the
[28:10] word how we
[28:12] app these these were
[28:16] Elders amen these were people that knew
[28:19] the word they knew the law of
[28:22] Moses these were the people that were in
[28:25] the
[28:26] land that Abraham had spoke
[28:30] of that
[28:32] Moses had brought them out of Egypt and
[28:35] Joshua had brought them into the
[28:38] land these people in the book of
[28:42] Samuel they weren't in
[28:45] Egypt they weren't in the
[28:47] desert no they were in the
[28:51] land Hallelujah they knew that God had
[28:54] sent a
[28:55] prophet they knew that God had brought
[28:57] them out of denominational
[29:00] systems they knew that the word had been
[29:03] open the Jordan had open to bring them
[29:07] into the
[29:09] land know that had already
[29:12] happened but they were in the
[29:15] land Amen in
[29:17] defeat in
[29:20] corruption
[29:22] fear
[29:26] deated
[29:28] and to try to bring that back oh we got
[29:31] to do
[29:34] something to try to revive
[29:38] that and get the people
[29:40] back in
[29:44] Victory got together said we got to do
[29:51] something and the Bible says that one of
[29:55] the elders
[29:59] said I got a
[30:02] revelation you remember that first
[30:05] Samuel
[30:11] 4 let
[30:19] us bring out the
[30:25] AR let us take you
[30:36] and surely brother just like
[30:41] today Brothers begin to get a lot of
[30:44] types and
[30:47] Revelations oh yeah yeah that's right
[30:51] the
[30:52] AR the word the
[30:56] message that's going to defeat the
[31:00] enemy but you got to know how to
[31:04] apply and you hear a lot of that
[31:07] today the message the
[31:11] message yes amen but the book ain't
[31:14] going to defeat the
[31:17] enemy the tape ain't going to defeat the
[31:21] enemy is what is contained in there
[31:25] applied in your heart by the holy spirit
[31:29] it's got to be
[31:32] anointed that's the
[31:37] difference when the word becomes spirit
[31:39] and
[31:41] life but because what
[31:45] happened
[31:47] the see there these are
[31:50] Elders they're supposed to
[31:52] know that Moses already
[31:55] said that
[31:59] can only be
[32:03] touched on the 10th
[32:09] day every year only once a
[32:14] year on
[32:24] the amen but here they
[32:28] are not caring what time of the year it
[32:33] is I don't care if it's to seventh month
[32:36] or
[32:39] not see they're not
[32:41] conscious of the
[32:44] season of the
[32:46] time they're trying to find
[32:48] [Music]
[32:49] ideas on how to do something without it
[32:54] being the will of
[32:56] God and they're using the the word
[32:59] they're using the
[33:01] message they're using the
[33:04] arc incre
[33:07] incre amen is that
[33:11] right because the Bible says that they
[33:14] took the
[33:15] ark and they ran towards the
[33:19] Philistines and the Bible says that they
[33:22] screamed and they shouted and they did a
[33:25] lot of emotion
[33:29] amen and theiles
[33:34] R then they said wait a
[33:42] minute let's go back and see what
[33:45] they're really
[33:48] about let's see if they really have what
[33:51] they're
[33:54] sh you know what the Bible says
[34:00] 30,000
[34:06] di s times more wow seven times
[34:14] more amen
[34:18] amen but they they had the
[34:25] ark they had
[34:27] word they had
[34:30] emotions it shows is not just
[34:34] that
[34:36] amen you got to have the laws of God in
[34:43] order amen amen and for that they
[34:50] need under the spirit of
[34:53] God tell them what they
[34:58] remember where did he take them to
[35:04] to said first need
[35:08] toate first we need a burn
[35:13] offering you need
[35:16] to get right with
[35:20] god oh but the ark
[35:22] brother the AR is not
[35:25] me no
[35:27] I'm nothing the AR is what's going to
[35:31] do do
[35:33] it you and the word have to be in L amen
[35:41] Connection by the spirit of
[35:44] God Amen oh but but in the days of
[35:49] Joshua the AR is the one that open the
[35:54] Jordan AR is
[35:57] no doubt a lot of them Elders talk
[36:02] about amen but did it work no no because
[36:06] they didn't know the time they didn't
[36:08] know the
[36:10] season the prophet
[36:13] Thomas now
[36:15] watch and when Samuel brought them into
[36:25] condition
[36:27] but we're Israel we're the people of God
[36:31] God will never leave us that's
[36:35] true but if you're not in
[36:39] condition you're going to
[36:46] stay but you just don't know
[36:51] your
[36:53] amen and when he brought him into
[36:56] conditions
[36:59] Samuel SL
[37:05] theing
[37:12] rightall remember
[37:14] that the
[37:19] Thunder put the enemy
[37:23] on is that right amen hallelujah and
[37:25] then God told
[37:28] Samuel name this place this
[37:33] Stone am
[37:38] Hallelujah
[37:43] Victory Stone
[37:52] of
[37:54] see so this is why
[37:57] God is wanting to show
[38:01] us again and we can retain
[38:05] this amen and know that it's not just a
[38:09] one time
[38:12] thing no brother B says it's got to be
[38:19] constant not just one
[38:21] time not just some services that we had
[38:24] maybe a year ago
[38:27] but we preach on laws of
[38:30] Revival no this is
[38:34] constant
[38:35] yes so now we come to Acts chapter
[38:40] 4 Everybody
[38:42] following
[38:44] amen Acts chapter
[38:47] 4 is after Peter and
[38:52] John have seen the power of the spoken
[38:55] word and raised a lame
[39:00] man and set all hell against
[39:07] him after they have
[39:10] went to prison for a little
[39:15] bit brought before the council the
[39:20] Sanhedrin and the council has already
[39:22] threatened
[39:25] them and has charged
[39:29] them not to
[39:31] speak not to
[39:34] preach in the name of Jesus
[39:38] Christ amen and then the council let him
[39:44] go with that
[39:46] threat and when they let them go this is
[39:48] what happened
[39:53] verse3 Acts chapter 4
[39:56] vers
[39:57] 23 and being let go they went to their
[40:01] own company and reported all that the
[40:04] chief priests and the elders had said
[40:06] unto
[40:16] them and when they heard that they
[40:20] lifted up their voice to God with one
[40:22] Accord and said Lord Thou Art God which
[40:25] has made Heaven and Earth and they
[40:27] seeing all that in them
[40:40] is so notice when they're let loose and
[40:44] they they come to their
[40:48] own they come and tell the
[40:55] churchil
[40:58] they begin to tell the church brothers
[41:00] and
[41:01] sisters we have just
[41:03] seen the power of
[41:06] God with the spoken
[41:09] word we have seen the Fulfillment of the
[41:14] word The Works that I do shall e you
[41:19] also and greater than this shall you
[41:22] do going to the father amen we have seen
[41:27] that but after that
[41:30] happened the
[41:32] devil has set all his forces against
[41:41] us now there's a
[41:44] threat now there's a challenge of the
[41:48] enemy against
[41:52] us when they tell when they told the
[41:54] people that
[41:57] they they had a prayer
[42:01] meeting they lifted up their voice
[42:08] God they to
[42:11] pray verse
[42:14] 25 who by the mouth of thy servant David
[42:18] has said why did the Heathen rage and
[42:21] the people imagine vain
[42:25] things
[42:30] the kings of the earth stood up and the
[42:32] rulers were gathered together against
[42:34] the Lord and against his
[42:44] Christ for of a truth against thy holy
[42:47] Child Jesus whom thou has anointed both
[42:50] Herod and Pontius Pilate with the
[42:54] Gentiles the Heathen yes
[42:56] and the people of Israel were gathered
[43:14] together see see how they're
[43:19] praying how to pray
[43:23] brother brother said when you pray pray
[43:26] according to the
[43:30] word that's how they're praying in the
[43:32] book
[43:36] of brother mam said be specific in your
[43:43] prayers Jesus
[43:49] his
[43:51] son as his
[43:55] father
[44:00] not if the child ask the father for a
[44:09] fish
[44:13] bef and
[44:15] direct what you're
[44:18] asking people don't know how to
[44:23] pray they're not focused they're not
[44:27] zero on one
[44:29] thing look at all the prayers in the
[44:33] Bible time a of God or People
[44:38] Prayed it was for
[44:42] a they weren't praying for million
[44:44] things at one
[44:47] time no
[44:50] specific because you're talking to
[44:53] God you're in connection with
[44:56] God and you're asking him for a certain
[45:02] thing
[45:04] amen amen
[45:08] amen they're praying with the
[45:12] word seeing what David said in the
[45:15] second
[45:17] PSAL it's right there taking
[45:21] place for to do whatsoever thy hand and
[45:24] thy counsel determined before to be done
[45:26] and now Lord behold their
[45:29] threatening oh my BR unto us thy
[45:33] servants amen that with all boldness yes
[45:37] they may speak
[45:51] word in other words we're not backing
[45:55] down
[46:03] enemy begins to attack and begins to do
[46:06] things against
[46:08] us that's not the
[46:13] time that's not the
[46:18] time to get
[46:22] weaker that's not the time to get
[46:28] discouraged that's not the time to say
[46:30] oh
[46:42] Devil's
[46:44] hallelujah it's not the time to do that
[46:47] it's the time to pray like
[46:54] this
[46:57] by stretching forth thine hand to heal
[47:00] and that signs and wonders may be done
[47:02] by the name of
[47:13] thy and when they had prayed the place
[47:16] was shaken where they were assembled
[47:19] together they were all filled with the
[47:21] Holy Ghost and they spoke the word of
[47:23] the Lord with
[47:24] B
[47:35] Hallelujah and the multitude of them
[47:38] that believe were of one heart and of
[47:40] one Soul neither said any of them that
[47:44] ought the things which he possessed was
[47:46] his own but they had all
[47:54] things
[48:05] amen how we want to
[48:07] see are we
[48:11] listen are we in the are we in the
[48:16] channel are we seeing what God is doing
[48:21] here
[48:23] why he put that in our heart
[48:31] Friday if we were on the series of the
[48:33] book of
[48:36] Acts why did all of a sudden he bring
[48:42] consecration now as I in my
[48:46] prayer he's wanting to show
[48:49] us
[48:51] connection why he has brought to our
[48:54] attention
[48:57] Friday
[48:59] cons if we're on the book
[49:04] of am Acts chapter
[49:08] 4 is the church that has already
[49:13] received the Holy
[49:16] Spirit it's the church that has already
[49:21] seen God in his power of the spoken word
[49:29] they're not praying for it to
[49:32] happen no they've already seen it amen
[49:38] and if you
[49:39] know but we have
[49:42] testified and if you have seen that in
[49:44] your own
[49:45] life then you know that those things
[49:49] have
[49:51] happened amen but the spirit is trying
[49:54] to show us something
[49:57] amen just because we have
[50:00] seen let's not
[50:04] presume Amen to advance without
[50:09] author Amen Let Us
[50:13] con and brother B shows us that these
[50:18] right here it's
[50:21] Peter John and it's the
[50:24] church has already received the
[50:27] spirit on the
[50:33] day you see the problem
[50:36] is that we
[50:38] think that we can be so filled with the
[50:48] spirit that's what consecration
[50:54] istion is
[50:58] rededication
[51:00] consecration is a
[51:03] refilling of the Holy
[51:06] ghid how we touch that
[51:09] there a
[51:12] refilling means that you've already been
[51:14] filled
[51:17] once and then you get a
[51:22] refill Amen brother mam said
[51:25] the
[51:27] dams
[51:31] is Dynamics is not the
[51:34] fing you need the
[51:36] feeling to know the
[51:38] truth to know the will of God to know
[51:42] the word to see his
[51:46] word
[51:47] manifest in sence and
[51:50] wonders and then after
[51:53] that amen get a
[51:58] refilling to
[52:00] stay in
[52:04] that to move
[52:06] you and
[52:10] Advance people get
[52:12] stuck people get
[52:20] stagnant
[52:22] yes amen there's no advantage
[52:30] we're still facing the same
[52:33] Temptations the
[52:36] samees the devil keeps beating them
[52:41] up they can't pass that
[52:46] test there's no
[52:48] Dynamics there's no prevailing
[52:52] power to advance amen
[52:56] not that you're
[52:57] lost it's not that you're you know going
[53:00] to go to
[53:01] hell but you're just
[53:10] stuck says
[53:17] take you see I believe that we have
[53:20] stressed so
[53:22] much we have put much
[53:26] emphasis and show by the
[53:29] scriptures on the Greater
[53:31] Works and proven that brother Adam
[53:35] said Christ in the true church is a
[53:38] continuation of the book of
[53:40] Acts
[53:44] right they can get a true
[53:48] Revelation the spirit of the
[53:51] Antichrist what it is and how it works
[53:54] within the framewor of the
[53:57] church will be
[54:00] in by the spirit of
[54:03] God they
[54:09] can
[54:11] Will yes amen but what the prophet
[54:20] said
[54:24] that
[54:26] need the prevailing
[54:31] power to
[54:34] overcome am
[54:38] hallelujah hallelujah and brother said
[54:42] this is what I was going to
[54:44] say because in that same
[54:48] quote
[54:50] says and that she may
[54:54] know
[54:55] that she can do the greater
[55:00] work and I believe we've proven that so
[55:05] much by the message of
[55:08] theot the
[55:10] scures that that is for
[55:15] us but the thing is brother said this is
[55:20] what the prophet
[55:23] said if you want to do the Greater
[55:26] Works the prophet said let me see the
[55:31] Lesser works
[55:35] first Hallelujah want do the Greater
[55:38] Works let me see the Lesser works first
[55:44] am what are the less
[55:48] Works
[55:50] consecration what are the Lesser
[55:52] words be right with God
[55:56] what the
[55:57] work love your
[55:59] brother what the
[56:03] work amen oh I'm going to do the greater
[56:08] work but I can't love my
[56:18] brother you ain't going
[56:21] nowhere
[56:23] yes you're going to stay stuck and
[56:27] stag we can't
[56:30] overcome and these little
[56:32] things and we plan to overcome the
[56:35] squeeze
[56:40] comes on see what I'm
[56:43] saying we can
[56:45] overcome little
[56:48] testings amen little
[56:51] trials and differences amen amen amen
[56:57] and we plan to overcome in the
[57:00] squeeze or somehow
[57:04] magically in the
[57:06] squeeze we're going to be able to
[57:08] overcome
[57:09] that being able to overcome
[57:13] this it doesn't work
[57:18] so amen amen amen so the spirit of God
[57:23] like I said Friday
[57:25] I pray to God and I have prayed to God
[57:29] that you take it in the right and
[57:31] correct
[57:33] spirit and that you know that it's the
[57:36] spirit of God exhorting
[57:39] us to see that we need all of
[57:43] us a
[57:46] consecration I read the quotes Friday
[57:49] brother said I need
[57:51] it and the church needs
[57:57] amen and then studying
[58:00] this before
[58:05] Friday I didn't even know what I was
[58:07] going to speak
[58:10] amen that same day I told you on Friday
[58:15] that came
[58:19] today and from Friday to
[58:23] today the spirit has shown us and is
[58:27] showing
[58:29] us how this is in
[58:32] connection and why is bringing this to
[58:36] our
[58:37] F
[58:39] understand amen now I just felt
[58:44] something now to open
[58:48] up see that's like I said at the
[58:51] beginning it all depends on how we
[58:53] receive it
[58:57] if we
[58:58] know that he is in
[59:00] control now
[59:05] watch we we read
[59:08] already those books hu but we want to
[59:12] read here in the message why Christ
[59:18] speak see Friday we read why Christ
[59:22] speak but from 1963
[59:30] July and in that
[59:32] evening he pre
[59:35] TBL brother

[59:43] Pooler but I
[59:46] need
[59:48] toate

[59:53] 63 why Christ
[59:56] speak and he said in
[1:00:00] Humble but now watch this this is
[1:00:04] powerful this is the spirit here
[1:00:08] connecting why Christ
[1:00:10] speak
[1:00:13] 59 brother bam is in clarsville
[1:00:18] Indiana and and he's going to preach
[1:00:20] there this message and he says I see
[1:00:24] some of the Tabernacle folks
[1:00:28] here I'm going to say this about the big
[1:00:33] sister he's calling Bram
[1:00:39] Tabernacle big
[1:00:41] sister to the church where
[1:00:45] he
[1:00:46] Church see one
[1:00:50] thing that the big sister
[1:00:53] needs
[1:00:55] the Tabernacle
[1:00:57] needs there at our
[1:01:00] church the Tabernacle at
[1:01:03] Jeff is a
[1:01:07] rededication and a
[1:01:10] refilling of the Holy
[1:01:14] Ghost he says that's right everyone to
[1:01:17] go down to the
[1:01:20] altar pray until they get a
[1:01:23] renewing
[1:01:26] of the Holy
[1:01:27] Ghost and the whole
[1:01:29] church be filled with the power of
[1:01:33] God that's what we
[1:01:35] need and then he says not only the
[1:01:38] Tabernacle
[1:01:40] there but the body of
[1:01:43] Christ
[1:01:45] Universal needs a
[1:01:52] refilling like David said one
[1:01:56] day restore to me the joy of my
[1:02:01] salvation he had not lost his
[1:02:04] salvation but the joy of when it comes
[1:02:08] to a place that I can't enjoy my
[1:02:13] religion my
[1:02:15] salvation there's something wrong somewh
[1:02:18] because it is joy
[1:02:21] unspeakable and full of Glory one of
[1:02:24] them said taste the Lord and see that
[1:02:26] he's
[1:02:28] good it tastes like Honey in the
[1:02:31] Rock I'm so glad that I tasted
[1:02:34] that the Lord is good and I love honey
[1:02:39] but I never taste it anything like that
[1:02:42] that's the best that I knowall and
[1:02:44] brother says now we're going to hurry
[1:02:47] right into the
[1:02:50] service
[1:02:52] and see if we can let the church out

[1:03:25] with his
[1:03:27] church amen with
[1:03:29] himself and with the whole body because
[1:03:33] as he's getting
[1:03:35] this he's saying we're
[1:03:40] anticipating a great
[1:03:42] meeting on the west

[1:12:38] privilege of
[1:12:41] knowing as a
[1:12:44] personal pass from Death life and that
[1:12:48] the spirit of Christ dwells in
[1:12:50] us around us among us and we are his
[1:12:55] people that called by his

[1:13:55] because that I am referring to an
[1:13:58] experience that you have given to
[1:14:01] me telling the
[1:14:03] truth that it might not be
[1:14:06] thought that it was meant

[1:14:14] for your
[1:14:18] people may all rejoice and all
[1:14:21] believe and all benefit
[1:14:24] by in the name of Jesus Christ we

[1:14:39] between I'm gonna read right now but
[1:14:42] this is what he said at the end of the

[1:28:09] place again where we're assembled
[1:28:14] together telling of the
[1:28:17] stories of the power of the
[1:28:20] Lord he is saying
[1:28:24] the same thing that Peter and John they
[1:28:28] had seen the spoken word is that right

[1:28:35] gold i i to
[1:28:40] the he didn't have to
[1:28:43] cry and pray all night

[1:28:49] done when they had seen that
[1:28:53] and the
[1:28:54] enemy raging came
[1:28:58] up and begin to fight against this and
[1:29:03] they threatened him amen when they were

[1:29:30] own said they didn't go back to the
[1:29:34] council they didn't go back to
[1:29:37] the they didn't go back to nowhere else

[1:29:42] own to tell them this is what the devil
[1:29:48] is you have seen his power but the devil
[1:29:53] doesn't
[1:29:54] like

[1:29:59] saying this to boast or to
[1:30:02] brag I want you to
[1:30:04] see the spirit of God is trying to lead
[1:30:09] us into a further
[1:30:13] advanc Hallelujah because we have
[1:30:16] already
[1:30:17] seen we have
[1:30:19] emphasized on the greater work

[1:30:26] works I believe we need more

[1:30:35] faith we we are seeing
[1:30:39] Apostolic says but we want to see more
[1:30:43] of
[1:30:44] it that it will
[1:30:47] flow in us here Among Us that it can
[1:30:52] flow out
[1:30:55] to that's what the
[1:30:59] prophet now when we follow the footsteps
[1:31:02] of the
[1:31:03] Prophet we see that what he is
[1:31:06] preaching is not just preaching a
[1:31:13] sermon no it's the spirit directing him
[1:31:19] in
[1:31:20] experiences and and he's finding his
[1:31:24] experience in the
[1:31:27] Bible amen that's why he's
[1:31:30] praying Lord the people are raging the
[1:31:34] heathens are

[1:32:30] church amen and the brothers in Mexico
[1:32:33] can testify of
[1:32:35] that this is being

[1:32:42] liar just to say things that weren't

[1:32:49] greater to try to say I'm good

[1:36:14] things open
[1:36:18] the Amen in the right
[1:36:23] hallelu but watch what the prophet says
[1:36:27] here so he prays exactly like Acts
[1:36:30] chapter
[1:36:31] 4 in the
[1:36:33] consecration service
[1:36:36] here he says let the rushing Mighty Wind
[1:36:40] sweep through every
[1:36:43] heart shake this
[1:36:46] place burn out all sin all iniquity all
[1:36:51] all fears and may every person become a
[1:36:54] consecrated Saint unto
[1:36:58] thee us Lord may we go from here with
[1:37:07] boldness this is what they
[1:37:16] pray that we go with a deep settled
[1:37:19] peace in our heart
[1:37:23] with a real faith that will shake
[1:37:27] Mountain because his message for the
[1:37:31] consecration is Mark
[1:37:35] 112 if you speak to
[1:37:38] this and don't doubt in your heart but
[1:37:41] believe what you asked will come to pass
[1:37:45] you can have what you said that's what
[1:37:48] he's dealing with in that message
[1:37:52] the
[1:37:53] ministry the power of the
[1:37:55] word amen something that Satan
[1:38:02] can something that
[1:38:04] only the seed of God the Bride of God
[1:38:10] the elected of God the chosen
[1:38:15] predestin Hallelujah anointed and
[1:38:19] commission of God
[1:38:22] to prophesy
[1:38:26] again he
[1:38:31] saysed you see how see how it connects
[1:38:34] now
[1:38:38] acts now I know
[1:38:40] why now you know
[1:38:42] why I didn't know
[1:38:45] why Friday I didn't know
[1:38:48] why I just said I told you
[1:38:51] the Lord wants me to speak on
[1:38:54] consecration here it goes amen amen amen
[1:38:59] but we're in the book of Acts
[1:39:01] brother now we see it this is
[1:39:10] consecration it's a
[1:39:12] refilling they have already been filled
[1:39:15] in that's chapter two and that
[1:39:18] filling that was in them is what made
[1:39:22] them
[1:39:25] speak because that wasn't
[1:39:28] Peter that was the Holy Ghost that they
[1:39:33] Reed in the upper
[1:39:35] room that spoke that wasn't the prophet
[1:39:40] that spoke the squs into
[1:39:42] existence that was the Holy
[1:39:48] ghoster and the prophet after that
[1:39:52] experience of speaking of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:56] in
[1:39:56] them they
[1:39:59] feel I need
[1:40:02] more you see what I'm
[1:40:05] saying not because they're in
[1:40:08] sin because they feel they lost oh I'm

[1:47:44] he said coming from home he says from
[1:47:49] Jeffersonville says I've hardly gotten
[1:47:51] any
[1:47:55] sleep
[1:47:59] amenallah
[1:48:03] thinking about
[1:48:15] this hallelujah amen
[1:48:18] hallelujah and after

[1:48:25] more
[1:48:27] messages that

[1:49:09] preaches
[1:49:15] what in the message what is the Holy
[1:49:19] Ghost to this little
[1:49:21] Tabernacle seeing that I believe it's
[1:49:24] one of the finest people that I believe
[1:49:25] that's on the
[1:49:29] earth that goes to this
[1:49:32] tabernac I never said all the finest
[1:49:35] people said some of the

[1:51:07] something that's not
