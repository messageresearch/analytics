[0:00] to me the angel of the
[0:03] Lord and many titles he
[0:07] gave of how this angel coming to
[0:11] him amen amen and as we have proved it
[0:15] by the scriptures
[0:19] books that the same
[0:22] Angel is in our midst
[0:27] tonight is the same angel
[0:31] that led the children of
[0:33] Israel through the
[0:36] Wilderness in which he
[0:38] said my name is in
[0:41] him will not pardon your
[0:45] transgression amen obey his
[0:49] voice this is the same
[0:51] angel that Paul the book of Hebrews
[0:54] called
[0:57] Christ this is the same angel
[1:00] brother Bram
[1:02] describes his
[1:05] visitation to him out of the light came
[1:09] a 200 lb
[1:11] man and he says that this
[1:16] light was later been
[1:20] photographed and he said that's what we
[1:23] have in that
[1:25] picture Hallelujah so the the man that
[1:28] came out of the light
[1:31] all of
[1:33] complexion 200
[1:35] lb came out of that
[1:38] life he calls it the same
[1:42] Angel you see with when we first look at
[1:47] this or we first come into the
[1:52] message and you hear different
[1:55] preachers I remember hearing a well
[1:58] Elder preacher speaking about that angel
[2:01] a long time
[2:07] ago and he said that
[2:09] angel can not be
[2:11] Christ because he said I'm sent from the
[2:14] presence of
[2:21] God and there's a lot of
[2:23] confusion on this as I said last uh
[2:28] Sunday there's a lot of critics even on
[2:31] the
[2:32] internet bringing these things out to
[2:36] the
[2:37] public and trying to
[2:41] prove from a critical
[2:44] standpoint that brother did not know who
[2:46] that angel
[2:49] was and they bring out the quotes he
[2:53] calls him Christ where he calls him the
[2:56] Holy Spirit calls
[2:58] Lord calls him the pillar
[3:00] fire and then they bring out the other
[3:03] quotes where he said there's a
[3:06] difference between the pillar of
[3:08] fire and this
[3:11] Angel amen you see but there is no
[3:15] confusion as I've been saying as we're
[3:18] going along this
[3:22] subject that this is same reasoning and
[3:25] confusion that comes into the minds of
[3:26] the
[3:28] trinitarian
[3:31] because they cannot
[3:33] comprehend the manifestation of
[3:37] God in more than one
[3:40] form whether it's
[3:42] theop whether it's Angel whether it's
[3:46] Pillar of Fire whether it's man amenu
[3:50] whether it's the invisible holy
[3:53] spirit that we fill in the building
[3:57] tonight amenah he reveals himself in
[4:00] many
[4:02] ways but yet is the same
[4:04] God he was a pillar of Fire by
[4:07] night and it was a cloud by day amen
[4:11] amen and that cloud has been revealed to
[4:15] us in this
[4:16] hour that is made out of seven
[4:19] angels is made out of seven
[4:23] spirits amen seven
[4:26] colors that the angel
[4:30] Mighty angel coming down from heaven
[4:32] closed
[4:35] himself Revelations
[4:37] 10:1 said this Mighty Angel was clothed
[4:40] in a
[4:42] cloud and as we finished up Sunday
[4:45] night this is the same thing that he's
[4:48] dressing the bride
[4:50] with in this last days the fullness of
[4:54] the
[4:54] word
[4:56] perfection in Joseph Hallelujah amen
[5:00] election in
[5:02] Abraham is that right amen but
[5:04] perfection in
[5:06] Joseph amen hallelujah and just seeing
[5:09] how tremendous this
[5:12] is if you've been following the spirit
[5:15] and seeing what he is
[5:20] emphasizing even a Sunday
[5:23] night uh how the angel of the Lord has
[5:27] come to anoint the bride you believe
[5:31] that you believe that
[5:34] amen the angel of the Lord has come to
[5:38] anoint thead of
[5:41] Christ in this last day the same
[5:45] angel that Anointed The
[5:48] Prophet and said I'll be with you amen
[5:51] wherever you go he said he promised to
[5:54] be with me in the
[5:57] meetings hallelujah amen that's that's
[5:59] why he would always
[6:01] wait for the presence of that
[6:04] angel and when he speaks of the presence
[6:07] of that
[6:08] angel he describes it in the same
[6:12] manner as when he was caught up in the
[6:17] vision sir is this is the time of the
[6:21] end he says the
[6:23] same
[6:26] testimony years before he says in the
[6:30] presence of this
[6:32] Angel amen it's a presence that
[6:35] paralyzes
[6:37] you he says after all of the
[6:40] times that he has visited
[6:43] me you would think that I would be
[6:45] accustomed or used to
[6:48] it he says but every time he
[6:51] comes it's the same thing Hallelujah
[6:55] when he was caught up into the vision of
[6:57] the
[6:58] cloud brother mam
[7:01] said it paralyzed
[7:03] me amen hallelujah because it was the
[7:07] same
[7:08] presence the angel of the
[7:10] Lord but now he was seeing the
[7:14] Revelation that it was in seven
[7:18] angels but there was one of the
[7:21] angels that would meant more to him it
[7:25] was the one with the point back
[7:28] wings
[7:29] it was the one that had his chest
[7:32] out is that right that was the one that
[7:36] meant more to
[7:38] me if you notice that was the one that
[7:40] was in
[7:42] action that was the one that had
[7:45] come amen because that was the anointing
[7:49] of the
[7:50] age hallelujah hallelujah and as we seen
[7:53] Sunday
[7:55] morning amen amen might have been a
[7:58] little too
[8:01] strong but I believe it's pretty plain
[8:05] amen am if you were able to
[8:09] catch amen what we brought there and
[8:12] just just brought out the
[8:17] quotes and showed how that
[8:20] was you can see very
[8:23] plainly what I said without saying
[8:27] it Hallelujah
[8:30] amen amen I said something without
[8:35] saying is that right am because I read
[8:38] the
[8:39] quotes and I showed you the
[8:43] comparison amen Amen brother mam in the
[8:46] fifth
[8:47] seal we've always quoted that
[8:50] quote we've always gave that quot
[8:54] to but now the light that God is
[8:58] shedding on this
[9:01] it just shows a whole whole another
[9:07] thing in the fifth seal brother said
[9:11] that
[9:12] angel was the seventh
[9:14] angel amen
[9:17] hallelujah amen
[9:21] amen you see Sunday morning we read two
[9:23] quotes
[9:25] remember we read the one where brother
[9:28] Madam said
[9:30] it was the angel of the
[9:32] Lord that
[9:34] right the angel that revealed the whole
[9:39] Revelation to John he said it was the
[9:42] angel of the
[9:44] Lord amen then we read questions and
[9:48] answers in
[9:51] 64 where they asked them why wouldn't
[9:54] Jesus accept
[9:58] worship
[9:59] in the Book of Revelation by
[10:01] John and brother said because it wasn't
[10:06] Jesus amen amen but in the other quote
[10:11] where he said he was the angel of the
[10:12] Lord he said notice it was the angel of
[10:16] the Lord and he said and John went to
[10:20] worship
[10:22] Him He says and he didn't accept
[10:25] worship he said because I am one of your
[10:29] brethren the
[10:31] prophets my fellow
[10:34] servants and brother bam said what was
[10:37] that that was the spirit of
[10:41] Prophecy that had that had been on the
[10:45] prophets All Through the
[10:47] Ages hallelujah amen brother Bram
[10:52] interpreted
[10:54] amen so that's the interpretation I
[10:58] want
[11:00] amen amen I want the interpretation of
[11:03] the Divine
[11:06] interpret said that was that
[11:08] Prophet was the spirit of Jesus Christ
[11:11] was the spirit of
[11:14] Prophecy because the same scripture says
[11:17] Spirit of
[11:18] Prophecy testimony of
[11:21] Jesus brother said that was the same
[11:24] spirit that was upon the prophets and
[11:26] made them
[11:27] prophesy
[11:30] is that right did not Moses say in
[11:35] Deuteronomy the Lord thy God raise up a
[11:39] prophet who he speaking of the god
[11:43] Prophet amen Jehovah Prophet the God of
[11:47] all the
[11:50] prophets so if he says he's I'm a
[11:54] prophet
[11:56] confused he
[11:57] is
[12:00] but he's the angel of the
[12:02] Lord did he anoint the
[12:05] prophet yes did he anoint brother Bram
[12:10] yes did he Veil himself in brother BR
[12:14] yes did he use him to reveal his
[12:19] ministry notice what I said he used him
[12:23] to reveal his
[12:26] ministry yes he
[12:27] did but you see when the Revelation
[12:32] comes it puts everything in its right
[12:35] place that's what Paul told
[12:38] Timothy to rightly divide the word of
[12:42] Truth is that right amen and in seeing
[12:46] these things Brothers is
[12:48] just so much we can talk
[12:51] about
[12:53] testify but we want to give you a
[12:56] thought
[12:57] tonight
[12:59] and that is how the angel comes to the
[13:04] bride and his commission hallelujah
[13:07] hallelujah amen how the angel comes to
[13:10] the
[13:12] bride and his
[13:15] commission and I want you to
[13:18] turn to the Book of Revelation
[13:22] 10 I know you all are familiar with the
[13:25] scripture we all know the
[13:27] scripture
[13:30] but if we're giving a statement like
[13:32] this
[13:34] tonight I believe it's in the
[13:38] scripture am amen it's in the
[13:44] message and Revelation
[13:46] 10 verse
[13:49] 8 this
[13:51] is Brother Ram said in the
[13:55] message what is the attraction on the
[13:57] mountain
[14:00] 1965 how many you remember that
[14:03] message in that
[14:05] message said Revelations 10
[14:10] 1-7 two years ago was prophecy he said
[14:15] now it's
[14:17] history that's his
[14:21] words but brother also preached a
[14:24] message lifting him up out of History
[14:30] amen so Revelations
[14:33] 10 1
[14:35] to was already
[14:37] history and then later on he
[14:40] preached or before that he
[14:43] preached this day this scriptures
[14:46] fulfilled amen amen and he said
[14:49] Revelations
[14:50] 10 1 to this day the scriptures
[14:55] fulfilled he said the day of judgment
[14:58] the day of of
[14:59] Vengeance has come the second part that
[15:04] Jesus didn't
[15:07] read amen amen this day this scripture
[15:10] is
[15:11] fulfilled Revelations 10
[15:13] 1-7 he said it's
[15:16] history but we must lift him up out of
[15:22] History that's what people are afraid to
[15:25] do to lift them up out of History
[15:29] according to the own prophet's words
[15:31] Revelations 10 1-7 is
[15:35] history but Revelations 108
[15:39] says and the voice which I heard from
[15:42] Heaven spake unto me again and said go
[15:44] and take the little book which is opened
[15:46] in the hand of the Angel which standed
[15:47] upon the sea and upon the
[15:57] Earth is the type of the
[16:00] Bride Amen brother M tells us in
[16:03] Revelation 4
[16:06] message now notice and I went unto the
[16:09] angel and said unto him give me the
[16:12] little book and he said unto me take it
[16:14] and eat it up it shall make thy belly
[16:16] bitter but it shall be in thy mouth
[16:18] sweet as
[16:27] honey so notice from verse
[16:30] 8 the same voice which spake in
[16:34] Revelation
[16:37] 101 amen amen
[16:41] 10
[16:43] amen 10
[16:46] 106 amen
[16:48] 107 amen the same voice now coming to
[16:53] him the second
[16:55] time see and he's telling them to take
[16:59] the book from the
[17:01] angel and verse 10 says and I took the
[17:05] little book out of the Angel's hand and
[17:06] ate it up and it was it was in my mouth
[17:09] sweet as honey and as soon as I had
[17:11] eaten it it my belly was
[17:20] bitter now here's the
[17:23] commission from that angel to who to
[17:27] John he is commissioning
[17:30] John and he said unto me thou must
[17:33] prophesy again before many peoples and
[17:36] Nations and Tong
[17:45] anding Hallelujah is that a
[17:50] commission oh
[17:53] my how the
[17:55] angel comes to the
[17:57] bride and his
[18:00] commission you might ask
[18:03] yourself why we read
[18:06] Genesis
[18:08] 48 amen perhaps
[18:10] tonight we won't get into the part of uh
[18:14] Genesis
[18:17] 48 might just touch a little
[18:20] bit but we read
[18:24] 49 verse
[18:27] 26 where Jacob
[18:33] says the
[18:34] blessings that the Lord has brought upon
[18:40] me have
[18:42] prevailed above the blessings of my
[18:48] progenitors
[18:50] hallelujah
[18:52] amen brother and
[18:56] sister why could Jacob say such a thing
[18:59] like
[19:01] that if you read Jacob's story and
[19:04] Jacob's
[19:07] life he had no great signs or
[19:13] wonders like
[19:16] Abraham or like
[19:19] Isaac or like when the angel of the Lord
[19:21] come to
[19:23] Moses and he opened the Red Sea and
[19:26] spoke things into existence
[19:31] or like when he come to
[19:33] Gideon and he fought the battle with
[19:37] 300 amen amen but when the angel of the
[19:40] Lord come to
[19:42] Jacob hallelujah amen it was to train
[19:46] him it was to school
[19:49] him it was to
[19:52] change the way he
[19:54] was yes sir because Jacob
[19:59] amen would dream about the
[20:02] angel and
[20:04] Jacob knew that his
[20:07] fathers amen had had great
[20:12] visitation but you we have to
[20:15] understand that you might not
[20:18] think what he just said right there you
[20:21] might not believe you might say well I
[20:24] believe God blessed Abraham more than he
[20:26] did Jacob
[20:30] he blessed Isaac more than what he did
[20:33] Jacob well then this verse is not
[20:37] inspired of
[20:38] God but it's permitted to be in the
[20:41] scripture and every scripture is
[20:45] inspired of
[20:46] God it's there for a purpose is that
[20:50] right it's there hallelujah hallelujah
[20:53] for
[20:54] Doctrine it's there to teach it's there
[20:58] there to
[20:59] exort every scripture is inspired of God
[21:04] hallelujah hallelujah so behind
[21:07] everything that God does there is a
[21:11] purpose we must understand that and I
[21:15] believe that the reason that Jacob could
[21:20] say that God had blessed
[21:23] me above my
[21:26] progenitors Hallelujah Hallelujah the
[21:29] blessings of God have prevailed in my
[21:33] life
[21:35] above what he blessed
[21:37] Abraham above what he blessed
[21:40] Isaac glory to God Amen Hallelujah he
[21:45] blessed Isaac oh yes how did he bless
[21:49] him oh brother there was no Supernatural
[21:52] thing like that in the Old
[21:56] Testament he come from the
[22:01] dead Paul said in
[22:06] Roman that what he
[22:08] said amen Abraham had received him as
[22:13] one from the dead why dead because
[22:17] Sarah's womb was
[22:18] dead her W her body was dead Hallelujah
[22:23] but from that
[22:25] deadness come Dam us
[22:28] come quickening power change your body
[22:32] Hallelujah and Isaac the promised son
[22:34] come
[22:35] forth is that right Abraham's body was
[22:39] changed amen he seen
[22:42] El he receive strength he saw the pillar
[22:46] of fire his body was changed he saw
[22:50] Elohim in human flesh he saw all these
[22:53] great things is that right amen but how
[22:57] come
[22:58] Jacob could
[23:00] say Amen that the blessings of the
[23:03] Lord upon Him have
[23:07] prevailed above his
[23:10] progenitors I believe amen it's because
[23:14] he
[23:15] understood the purpose of God in his
[23:19] life amen you see he is the
[23:23] father of the
[23:25] 12 tribes of Israel
[23:30] amen and he is the one that blessed
[23:33] them he's the one that prophesied over
[23:36] them what he prophesied over
[23:39] them that until this day still coming to
[23:43] pass and until this day it will come to
[23:48] pass amen this very scene that we
[23:52] read in Genesis
[23:55] 48 amen is coming to pass in in the in
[23:58] the
[23:59] Supernatural to the Gentile
[24:02] church is also happening and will
[24:06] happen Amen to the
[24:09] Jew to
[24:11] God he could say something like that
[24:15] because the angel of the
[24:17] Lord amen showed
[24:21] him you see in Jacob's
[24:24] life all you see is trial
[24:31] Tes
[24:33] training you see him in
[24:37] desperation you see his
[24:40] errors a lot of his errors are
[24:46] written is that
[24:49] right you believe God allowed the
[24:53] prophet to tell us of his errors
[24:59] abely or did he try to hide
[25:03] them you know what he
[25:05] said questions and
[25:07] answers he says I want my
[25:10] errors my
[25:13] mistakes to be a stepping
[25:16] stone for
[25:19] you amen I believe that's the
[25:22] reason why he was giving his his
[25:25] mistakes and his errors
[25:29] that's the reason why he would come
[25:31] publicly and tell us how he would
[25:34] disobey the
[25:37] Lord and not just say well you know I
[25:39] disobey the Lord
[25:42] today oh no no that's how we do it you
[25:46] know I I I was reasoning it and then God
[25:50] helped me that's how we
[25:53] say but he he would tell
[25:56] you the
[25:58] details he would tell you what he was
[26:01] thinking he would tell you where he made
[26:04] the
[26:05] mistake when he was in
[26:09] Africa remember yes yes amen the the
[26:13] Lord had already told
[26:15] him amen go to
[26:17] Duran go to South africaa is that right
[26:21] am but the
[26:22] ministers were telling him brother let's
[26:25] go over here is that right
[26:29] amen and and he asked Billy
[26:33] Paul what should I do bil Paul said he I
[26:37] suggest you do what the angel told
[26:41] you brother said just to go along with
[26:45] what the ministers told
[26:47] him he went that way is that right and
[26:51] he got sick then he got
[26:55] sicker to God yeah nothing come out
[26:59] right is that right because the angel of
[27:02] the Lord had led him to a certain
[27:06] place Hallelujah am but you see he told
[27:12] us those
[27:13] things for a reason is that
[27:17] right if you hear him one
[27:20] time in a meeting he says the last time
[27:22] I was
[27:24] here I was scheduled and everything
[27:28] he says I left somewhere
[27:31] else he says because I to be led by the
[27:34] spirit of the
[27:38] Lord that
[27:40] right do you know what he called
[27:43] those you can type that in the
[27:46] message Macedonian
[27:49] call amen amen he said Paul received the
[27:53] Macedonian call
[27:56] on amen he was in one place and the Lord
[28:00] called him to go to
[28:03] Macedonia he says when the Lord calls I
[28:05] cancel everything I go I follow the
[28:09] Lord amen amen even if the meeting was
[28:12] already
[28:15] scheduled even if you know everything's
[28:17] already ready waiting for Brother BR to
[28:21] come amen
[28:24] amen but you
[28:26] see this this is what we have to
[28:29] understand and I want to speak a little
[28:31] bit about this
[28:33] tonight maybe like a little
[28:36] platform
[28:37] for uh this this title this message that
[28:41] we the Lord has brought upon our
[28:44] heart how the angel comes to the
[28:47] bride and his
[28:49] commission you
[28:52] see so the
[28:54] reason I believe he could say that
[28:59] because he understood the
[29:01] purpose of God in his
[29:04] life
[29:06] amen how many scriptures can you think
[29:10] of in the Bible in the message where
[29:15] brother bam refers to
[29:18] him

[29:24] Shyer one that was a mama's boy
[29:29] one that would you know deceive
[29:33] people amen one that stole the birth
[29:38] right but all those things if you follow

[29:51] his his father
[29:54] Isaac and his mother helped him which
[29:57] was the bad thing to

[30:04] that
[30:07] anyway but she liked him
[30:11] and Isaac liked
[30:16] Esau that right so he put the Esau's
[30:21] perfume on
[30:24] him right amen Esau clothes
[30:28] esa's hairy
[30:31] arm right make him made him smell like
[30:36] es deceived his father in other words he

[30:42] disguise right to deceive his
[30:46] father Hallelujah did he reap what he
[30:50] so yes he did oh yeah that's exactly
[30:53] what his father-in-law
[30:55] did amen amen he
[30:59] disguised Leah and make him think it was
[31:02] it was
[31:04] Rachel amen and he failed for
[31:07] that is that right amen did did it did
[31:10] that come back to him yes and even even
[31:15] harder cuz he had to work seven more
[31:19] years glory to
[31:22] God so everything he
[31:25] done he reaped
[31:28] but the thing is there's a
[31:32] purpose in our Liv bam said in his life
[31:38] he done many
[31:40] mistakes is that right
[31:42] amen and in those
[31:44] mistakes it was the hand of the
[31:47] Lord bringing him to the perfect will of
[31:50] the
[31:52] father bringing him to the
[31:55] purpose upon which he had been born upon
[31:58] the Earth
[32:00] for amen amen with the sons of God are
[32:06] predestinated they're born in the Earth
[32:08] for a
[32:10] purpose everything that God
[32:13] does everything that God
[32:15] says all of his
[32:18] acts his
[32:20] program it's all for a purpose and we
[32:24] must
[32:25] understand amen the purpose of God in
[32:29] order to understand what we are going
[32:33] through and what purpose is in our
[32:36] life it's strange today how people they
[32:41] want to believe in
[32:43] God they want the blessings of
[32:46] God Amen but they don't want to
[32:50] learn and they don't want to know the
[32:53] purpose of
[32:55] God am
[32:57] and if you don't know the purpose of
[33:00] God Amen you will
[33:04] constantly will be in
[33:07] conflict with
[33:09] God though you want His
[33:12] blessings though you believe in him
[33:15] though you love him you will be in
[33:20] Conflict amen amen because you don't
[33:23] understand his
[33:25] purpose how many can say
[33:29] amen you see people want to believe in
[33:34] him they want the blessings of
[33:37] God but people don't want to
[33:39] know and they don't want to learn the
[33:43] purpose of God they don't want to learn
[33:46] his
[33:46] plan they don't want to learn or know
[33:50] the
[33:51] purpose you know why because to know the
[33:55] purpose to know the will of
[33:58] God God requires full
[34:02] surrendering amen God requires
[34:07] dedication God
[34:09] requires
[34:11] Revelation because without
[34:14] knowing the purpose of
[34:16] God revealed to your
[34:19] life amen you will walk as a blind
[34:23] man amen touching for things
[34:28] but in in your desire your
[34:30] heart you want to to serve God you want
[34:34] to please God but you're always bumping
[34:37] into
[34:39] things you're always
[34:41] falling you're always hurting
[34:43] yourself why because you don't see the
[34:46] purpose of
[34:48] God you're blind to his mind you're
[34:52] blind to his will for your
[34:55] life Hallelujah amen do you understand
[34:59] tonight so we are always in conflict
[35:02] with
[35:03] God that's why isah
[35:05] says amen sayth the
[35:09] Lord my thoughts are not your
[35:13] thoughts my ways are not your ways for
[35:17] they're much
[35:19] higher Hallelujah
[35:21] hallelu so we need the mind of
[35:24] Christ Paul says the natural
[35:28] man receiveth not the things of God for
[35:33] they are
[35:35] foolishness unto him and he can neither
[35:38] know
[35:40] them because they are spiritually
[35:44] Des amen amen but natural man cannot
[35:48] receive the things of
[35:50] God the Bible says to be a friend of the
[35:55] world is to have enity with
[36:01] God so we can be in
[36:04] Conflict we can be
[36:07] inity is that right because we need the
[36:12] mind of
[36:14] Christ so if we don't
[36:17] understand his purpose his progress
[36:21] you'll be in
[36:22] conflict with God you'll say why
[36:27] why can't God give me
[36:30] this because you don't understand his
[36:34] purpose you understand what I'm
[36:36] saying why is God doing this to
[36:39] me why am I going through
[36:42] this if you understand his
[36:45] purpose you'll know the answer to the
[36:50] why Hallelujah you see what I'm saying
[36:55] why can't he give me
[36:58] this why is God giving me this
[37:03] burden why do I do I have to go through
[37:08] this or or I want this and God has an
[37:14] answer or I I don't know what to do you
[37:20] see what I'm saying but to know the
[37:23] purpose of
[37:24] God is to understand
[37:27] that behind everything that God does
[37:31] that God says there is a
[37:35] purpose hallelujah amen amen as Paul
[37:39] said in Ephesians chapter 1 brother
[37:43] taught this in the adoption
[37:47] series amen we've preached on this amen
[37:52] years
[37:53] before the mystery of his will
[37:59] did Paul say in Ephesians 1 the
[38:02] mystery of his will that brother Ram
[38:06] comes down and tell
[38:08] us in
[38:09] adoption amen am he says what is the
[38:12] mystery of his
[38:13] will is the mystery of God's will for
[38:18] your
[38:19] life amen
[38:22] hallelujah amen and what else does Paul
[38:24] say in Ephesians
[38:28] according as he has
[38:32] purpose in
[38:36] himself so God has a
[38:38] purpose and he has already purposed
[38:41] these things in
[38:43] himself before the foundation of the
[38:46] world so what do we
[38:49] need Hallelujah huj we need the Eternal
[38:52] thoughts of
[38:55] God to be
[38:57] revealed to us amen so that the mystery
[39:02] of his
[39:03] will is a revelation of his
[39:08] will amen you understand God has a
[39:13] purpose for each and every one of
[39:19] us and I believe this is what the
[39:22] prophet of God
[39:25] understood
[39:27] Hallelujah why am I saying this do you
[39:30] understand why I'm saying
[39:32] this because when the
[39:34] angel came to brother
[39:37] BR what did he come to
[39:41] tell he say I'm here to show
[39:48] you the reason
[39:51] why you had a PEC
[39:55] birth reason
[39:57] why you've had a misunderstood
[40:02] life the reason
[40:05] why these
[40:07] ministers haven't
[40:09] understood the day of their
[40:13] visitation
[40:18] Hallelujah and he showed him through the
[40:23] scriptures what he was to reveal
[40:27] his purpose in
[40:31] life you
[40:33] understand Allelujah is that what the
[40:35] Angel is coming to tell us in this
[40:39] hour amen amen what is he coming to tell
[40:43] us why you were born on the
[40:48] Earthen why you been
[40:52] misunderstood am brother said God's
[40:58] sons have always been
[41:02] misunderstood amen did he
[41:06] preach God being
[41:09] misunderstood
[41:14] amen amen
[41:17] amen God has a
[41:19] purpose reaching every one of
[41:22] us according to
[41:25] election amen you believe his purpose is
[41:28] according to
[41:31] election
[41:35] amen amen
[41:38] amen you see brother when we don't
[41:42] understand God's purpose for our
[41:47] life we want to
[41:49] do what the next person
[41:54] does when we don't
[41:56] understand God's purpose for our
[42:00] lives amen
[42:02] amen we think God's
[42:07] unjust we think that
[42:10] God let one
[42:15] suffer you say let him
[42:19] suffer how many know that the purpose of
[42:23] God for some people's lives
[42:27] is to go through
[42:30] suffering
[42:32] am
[42:33] amen prove it to the
[42:37] scripture and we'll read in a little
[42:41] bit but how come that person if he
[42:44] doesn't
[42:46] understand see what he's going
[42:52] through he'll say while how come
[42:57] I
[43:02] haveall and someone else doesn't have to
[43:08] go because you don't
[43:11] understand his
[43:13] purpose your
[43:15] life hallelujah
[43:18] hallelujah you
[43:20] understand amen but Paul says is God
[43:25] unjust
[43:28] amen is he
[43:32] injust he's
[43:35] Sovereign hallelujah what he does he
[43:38] does for a
[43:39] purpose because he has that
[43:43] plan already in him he has that purpose
[43:46] already in
[43:47] him it's not that he's barely thinking
[43:51] of something to do

[44:28] lives amen we know the
[44:32] objectives we know what God wants to get
[44:36] us

[44:40] circumstances we're
[44:43] in we know that he has a purpose for our
[44:47] lives and whatever I'm going through is

[48:29] message when I much
[48:32] younger there a
[48:34] purpose
[48:36] amen probably would have been caught up
[48:38] in that
[48:40] nonsense and it would have been hard for
[48:43] you to get out of such a
[48:46] thing God knows what he's doing for

[49:00] standpoint you'll say I should have done
[49:03] this I shouldn't have done
[49:07] this if I should have done

[49:14] God's
[49:18] standpoint you know God allowed
[49:22] this God allowed this God allowed

[53:51] miss amen
[53:54] hallelujah
[53:56] see what I'm
[54:00] saying glory to God but the thing
[54:04] is we have to understand his purpose so
[54:09] Moses comes down and tells God I'm sorry

[54:14] Moses it's time for you to die that's
[54:17] what he tells him

[54:39] 31 says write a
[54:44] song before you

[54:51] 32 is a song that God told him to write
[54:54] before

[55:35] there amen amen of his own
[55:42] testimony so so God tells him it's time
[55:46] for you to die
