be drawn Closer to You Lord that's our motive Lord that's our purpose father Lord that your word as it goes forth we believe that it is Spirited in his life there's power in your word oh God there's power father as it was in the book of Acts that while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Spirit fell your Prophet said oh God that one day he come up to the platform knowing that there was a great need in the bodies many lay in cson but Lord you let him father to stand there and he said I did it purposely just preached the word not even laid my hands or did anything and while I was preaching the word the sick begin to be healed they begin to come off of those stretchers oh God you said your word and you healed our disease we believe there's power in the word we believe it's sufficient for all our needs oh God we believe Lord that it has yet life and power today Lord we believe in your Resurrection we believe that you are here alive God The Great I Am father the great Pillar of Fire leading your children in this hour amen so we pray oh God that you would have out of your way father just move me aside father and come oh God and have the pre amenties take total control father we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God bless every one of you this morning it's good to be in the house of the Lord It's get to come and receive it's refreshing amen the presence of God amen amen I I really enjoyed last night myself the presence of God as brother Frank said there at the end you know this kind of services that you just don't want to leave and I guess we started at 4: yesterday right brother Frank and service in at about 8:00 so amen amen uh I believe that if we can just unite our faith and pull together with the word that God would bring a great blessing to us this morning amen it's good to see our brother Chris Long bless you brother amen and just all the saints amen that here with us uh let us as we're standing God bless you let's open our Bibles in Psalm 105 then I I overheard a little bit of brother Bill was expressing there and we were talking last night there at the dinner table about the things that is prophesied in the scripture what R said concerning this this economic collapse that is coming and we I believe we're close to that back home we've been preaching on another subject of Joseph Perfection and amen we have gone into those areas of the word where Genesis 47 the Bible says that they all came to Egypt and their money they they declared our money fath right our money is worth nothing no more and they gave themselves as slaves to the system of Egypt and I believe that's exactly what is prophesied in the word for this last day but we have a promise in that hour amen that what we have seen temporarily will be manifested in the fullness of its power and that's the power that I believe that is to lead us and create in US amen that that Faith right now amen I believe that power has been loosed right yes and it's here now to create that faith in us amen that perfect Faith amen amen and this is why this is a time of preparation this is a time of preparation amen amen and as that quote uh in the message testimon brother Braham said my fear that this is coming is not because uh I'm scared of it but I'm afraid that many people are not ready they're not prepared and this is preparation time right yes this is time to get Amen in Connection in line with the word and with God Amen this is the time of preparation amen and many times as brother B says we don't we don't get into that desperation amen he says it's just in human beings to wait for the state of emergency right but I believe the bride of Christ has made herself ready amen she's preparing herself because we have been given something to prepare us amen right so God bless you uh I trust that we all come expecting this morning and and just allow him to minister to our hearts amen I really appreciate the fellowship and and the the time that we have had and just the open door and the invitation God bless everyone Psalms uh 102 Psalm 102 we begin reading from the 13th verse Thou shalt arise and have mercy upon Zion for the time to favor her amen yes amen yay the set time is come praise the Lord how many believe that Amen brother said who is the New Jerusalem it's the Bride of Jesus Christ amen she is the one that bears his name Bears his life and bears his children amen so the time appointed the set time to favor her has come amen this is this hour that we're living for thy servants take pleasure in her Stones amen amen oh my her Revelations amen that's right and favor the dust thereof oh my so the Heathen shall fear the name of the Lord and all the kings of the earth thy Glory yes amen when the Lord shall build up Zion he shall appear in his glory how many believe that he has appeared in this hour in his glory amen amen he said he would appear the second time without sin amen and the appearing of Our Lord Has Come amen when the Lord shall build up Zion he shall appear in his glory he will regard the prayer of the destitute and not despise their prayer isn't that wonderful amen amen this shall be written for the generation to come notice for the generation to come and the people shall which which shall be created amen hallelujah shall praise the Lord hallelujah see this is an hour of creation I believe in the spiritual realm amen what did the opening of the word do to the Bride of Jesus Christ it creates Perfection it creates a perfect atmosphere where the word can be manifested amen is that right didn't brother bam say not ones at the end time that the first pool was Divine Healing amen and the second pull was the discernment then he said third pull is the opening of the word amen we believe that part right there is that spiritual loosing of the holy spirit amen amen the spirit of Truth am to bring the children of God to Perfection to bring the children of God to that place amen where we are created like Christ Jesus amen amen Paul said in Ephesians we are created amen we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus amen to the good works that were already for ordained amen before the foundation that we should walk in them amen so this is this is what David under the inspiration of the Holy SP spirit is speaking here in Prophecy and then he says this for Heath looked down from the height of his Sanctuary from Heaven did the Lord behold the earth oh my I love this verse 20 and this is what we're focusing on right here verse 20 to hear the groaning of the prisoner to loose those that are appointed to death to declare the name of the Lord in Zion and praise in Jerusalem now let's go to let us go to Psalm 118 see to loose those who are appointed to death how many know that the Bible says it is appointed unto man once to die and after this the Judgment amen yeah so we are all appointed to death sentenced to death because of the Fall amen right so God has come down in this last day to loose us from that sentence Oh My hallelujah how many believe that how many believe that there's got to be a people living on the earth that will not see death right amen didn't he say didn't the bible say that that time would come that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord amen amen we'll be changed is that right so we see that this is what the scripture is speaking of we're loosed from that sentence of death and then again in Psalm 118 it says uh verse 17 I shall not die but live and declare the works of the Lord amen the Lord hath chastened me sore but he ha not given me over unto death open to me the gates of righteousness I will go into them and I will praise the Lord the Gate of the Lord into which the righteous shall enter amen there's ministered unto us an entrance amen amen is that right I will praise you for thou Hast heard me and art become my salvation the stone which the build Builders refused is become The Headstone of the corner yes this is the Lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes yes it is this is the day which the Lord hath made amen we will rejoice and be glad in it Heavenly Father we thank you Father for the reading of your holy and precious word we ask Lord that you bless it and give us the context of it father bless us together in Heavenly places now now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated I like this I'd like to for us to turn to the book of Hebrews chapter 11 how many believe that this is an hour of perfection brother says how many believe in dispensation yes he said there's been a dispensation of the law amen there's been a dispensation of Grace or of the churches he said this is the dispensation of adoption amen we are living in that time this is that age this is that that era whatever you want to call it amen this is that season in which the children must become right been mature this is the age when we saw one in our day as we were saying last night that came to full maturity when he came to that full maturity it reproduced Christ remember that again amongst human beings amen and that reproduction of Jesus Christ again is exactly what the scriptures tell us about that is promised for the Church of Jesus Christ to come to that Perfection until we all come unto the stature of a perfect man is that right and we cannot come brothers and sisters to Perfection and that's the very reason why God had to restore the word amen and give us a perfect word a perfect interpretation of the the word because how could we come to Perfection if the word wasn't perfected in its interpretation in other words how can we come to Perfection only with half of a gospel how could we come to Perfection only with Luther's message of justification how could we come to Perfection only with with Wesley's message of sanctification we needed a perfect word that's right we needed a perfect message amen we needed a prophet to rise and come on the scene to restore the word of God to us amen and he said in uniting time and sign to bring back the scattered word amen he sit down seven angels from heaven and he sent the book down to the seventh angel Amen to reveal it to his people you see this the very purpose and the reason why God has put this message it has come across our path has been put in our hands amen that's why brother bam said I believe these tapes will fall into the hands of the predestinated amen yes sir amen and it has fallen in our hands amen amen did it fall in your hands amen amen did it fall in my hands amen yes it has come for a purpose and this is God's for ordained Plan before the foundation of the world so when we when we look here in the book of Hebrews Paul is speaking of the great Heroes of Faith amen yes and here he is beginning with the very creation itself amen faith is the substance and we know what brother B taught us about that that's the logos amen that's the that's the very Holy Spirit itself that's the six sense the holy spirit amen it's a substance it's not imagination no it's not a feeling it's not it's something amen that is settled in the soul brother said that is connected with the word of God it has been revealed to you amen amen what is to come to pass before it does then we see that he he goes on with the Heroes of Faith and he talks about all these these these great these great Heroes of Faith amen and we want to go down we want to go down to verse 39 verse 39 and these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise see this is what he's talking about this is the Old Testament this is the Old Testament saints that did all these things yet without the holy Spirit right they didn't receive the promise the promise was this is what all they prophesy this is what they spoke of this is what was to come amen and that was the coming of the Holy Spirit and the last one to prophesy of that was John the Baptist you see and then Jesus told the disciples the spirit of Truth amen shall come it is with you now it is with you but it shall be in you amen yeah so that is the promise that yet with all that they did and and and performed manifested without the promise verse 40 God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect yes sir amen oh my now how many believe we have an absolute in this time how many believe that in the days of Ephesus in the Ephesian church amen anyone that would speak yes they PR prove those that called themselves Apostles amen and they found in Liars is that right Amen brother bams tells us how they did that right and they they checked whatever Minister would preach by Paul's message yes sir sir if if they weren't saying what Paul said they were Liars that's right sir is that right amen so I I believe we can all agree on that amen sir we have we have a perfect resting place yes we have a place amen I believe that this message is the fullness of Christ amen I believe that this message is the perfect interpretation of God Amen I believe that this is where we can lay our soul and rest on the word of God and truly have faith in what we are seeing and hearing and receiving in our soul am amen that's the beauty of of of of having amen an absolute that we can tie our soul to the word of God that's the beauty of it we don't have to rest on what somebody else thinks about it we don't have to rest on what somebody else interpretation is we can rest our soul upon the pure unadulterated word of God is that right amen and that's what I believe the bride of Christ is trusting in in this hour amen not what I can try to understand or or receive you know some kind of intellectual understanding amen hallelujah but the revelation of Jesus Christ brother said any Revelation amen must go from Genesis to Revelation what he say and and he said if it doesn't lay it on the shelf and leave it alone yes amen right so when we when we look at what brother man talked about Revelation he said Revelation is sovereignly given amen amen he said and who is this MZ re the Revelation itself is Sovereign amen he reveals to whom he will is that right he hides it from from the wise and the BR and reveals it unto bab such as with learn amen and brother said we can only speak and me what God has revealed to us yes sir that's right he said we must be inspired to speak the word of God Amen and we must speak under divine inspiration and Revelation that's why each one of us should have a testimony as as the scripture says to give amen a witness of the hope that lies within us amen is that right yes be ready if God has given us something he has placed something in our heart amen God is creating something inside of us that's that perfect faith in a perfect word amen for a perfection in this hour see so if we look at this scripture Hebrews 11:40 and we see that it's speaking of a a better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect we want to know what the Divine interpreter of the word said amen amen is that righten and brother Bram said the prophet is the Divine interpreter of the word amen amen no one has a right to to judge or question the authority of a prophet amen and it's not our job job to try to reason it out we just we just look at what he said about the word and we believe it then the Revelation comes you understand okay so this is what we're going to do today amen and I trust this will be a blessing to you amen and it'll help us in this Christian walk amen so in the message Christ is a mystery of God revealed paragraph 6:26 he says Hebrews 11 said they could not be perfect without us the hands the feet cannot be perfect without the brains the knowledge the head and so forth now brother Bram we see immediately that he is not taking it to the Old Testament Saints like Paul was you see what I'm saying y now he's bringing it to the Body of Christ those that are in Christ amen they he said just as uh the head or or the dream and the vision of Daniel and the dream of Nebuchadnezzar amen right as it traveled from the head of gold down to the feet he said so the body of Christ has traveled from the feet back up to the head of gold amen in Christ of course and we see that this this is where brother R is applying it now he says and the hands and the feet cannot be made perfect without the brains the knowledge amen remember brother ra said he said right now he said it has traveled from the feet amen yeah and it has come up and he says and then we see we're in the eye age we're in the eye of the we're in the age of the eye the prophetic the seen amen then he said the next is the intelligence is that right the next is the mind of Christ let this mind that was in Christ be in you amen hallelujah then he says here now he says notice it cannot be made perfect without the brains the knowledge the head and so forth see we're all perfected in him amen so by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body amen free from judgment pass from sin unto death from from Death unto life God's own son will be leading at the meeting in the air is that what he son that was my first quote brother Joe amen God's own son will be the leading one at the meeting of the air at the meeting of the a now notice amen it immediately connects with the Rapture now showing us what this is in connection with and I I trust amen I'm just going to go go along with the word of God here the United time and sign 1963 says we find now that the time comes when the trumpet sounds and those sleeping Saints back there that could not be made perfect without us they are depending on us Hebrews 11 amen that's right yes oh my they're depending on us he says and they can come together when they come together they Unite with the living ones yes sir the church United with the word here then the church and the and the word United together becoming one the dead Saints with the living Saints United together to be one also yes and all going together to unite with Christ Yonder for the wedding supper of the Lamb Hallelujah this is a time of United it's an invisible Union between bride and Christ in this hour amen the marriage is taking place hallelujah amen the minister glory to God that is uniting the bride of Christ has already come and said amen I will espouse you to Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah H he said this ministry of Luke 17:30 is to unite the bride to her head Hallelujah he said the same Ministry that rose up in the East Rises up in the West blest again to unite the bride with her husband sir glory to God I believe that with all my heart amen H we cannot deny it amen it's proven it's Vindicated Hallelujah yes so we see here that this is a uniting time then he says in the message the token he says the substitute see but the life of Jesus Christ has come now into you which is the Holy Ghost God's token that you have accepted the blood of his son Jesus Christ in the days of Luther it was thought to be in the days of Wesley the chemistry of the blood but this is the last day where the token is required and that makes together the whole unit for the rapture yes see do you see it congregation says amen water blood and Spirit come when a mother gives birth to the baby the first thing breaks a normal birth is water second thing is blood next thing is life there come from the body of our Lord Jesus Christ water blood and life and the whole church the bride together has been made up through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the token are you ready as Hebrews 11 says all these who wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins and was destitute in all these things that they done yet was not made perfect without us and the church in this day listen and the church in this day that's received the token of the baptism of of the holy spirit that the blood has been shed and the Holy Ghost is upon the church without us then they cannot rise that's right amen yes sir they're depending on us for God promised he would have it and somebody is going to be there somebody's got in other words somebody's got to fulfill that word somebody it's like a fulfill what David prophesy I shall not die I shall live am hallelujah amen there's got to be a people that has been loose from appointed death am Hallelujah Jesus Christ died that you and I wouldn't have to die oh my amen oh brother what a privilege it is to live in this hour thank you Lord amen they all long brother said to live in this day amen amen hallelujah what the greatest thing that was ever sent to the Earth amen come in its fullness again here in this last age yes sir and that's the very sign that he sold Hallelujah in 63 uniting time and sign the sign Hallelujah of the son of man appearing in heaven glory and what was it it was the head yes sir glory to God it was a head it was a cat's conone amen coming down for Perfection am why because a man on the earth a Son of God a redeemed vessel amen the messenger of the age had come to Perfection yes sir he had come to perfect love he had had these identifications in his life amen and he had he had shown that very that very agape love yes come on he loved the Hornets amen yeah he loved the bull amen Hallelujah glory to God he he he showed that atmosphere of love and when perfect love was projected Sovereign Grace took his place and the cast came down shouting Grace Grace Grace Hallelujah glory to God we have a message of Grace in this hour yes oh my brother said my whole makeup is Grace amen amen so when we see then that when this word brought the perfect interpretation is because there was perfect love my goodness in a man's heart that's very important there was perfect love in someone's heart that God can entrust to him he was for ordained for this so God had it prepare yes sir yes right yes and God can give him this book amen yes sir that's right and this is why this isn't this is a time brother Bram said nothing shorter than perfect love that's what he said will be on that other side yes sir yes sir help us he said Sublime canot describe it right amen it's Perfection you know abam said many people think well when I die I'll be perfect he said death don't change your death don't change who you are it just changes your Dwelling Place amen Perfection is here see so this is why for going to a perfect place we're the we're the age that is going to walk right into it while we're alive Amen brother Bram said this is the evilest of all ages how can I overcome he said this is the blending to Time and Eternity that's right amen and he said that Mighty Angel come down from heaven said time is no more brother and sister just just a little thought for you when could that angel come down and say time is no more you see when could Time and Eternity begin to blend together amen come on when that first grain of wheat reach maturity then God Amen God can say time is no more from here on out time is going to begin to blend in eternity from here on out amen I'm not dealing with Leo deia no more from here on out it's individuals from here on out amen it's not a church age anymore right come on it's a bride age am I'm dealing with my jeans now I'm feeling I'm dealing with my sons and my daughters oh brother and sister this is where we're at amen and those those genes of God hallelujah yes Lord they have that potential on the inside already amen we are those little iglet that we're in that chicken coop amen hallelujah and we didn't know that we can fly praise the lord we didn't know that we had already the potential inside of us but we had to hear the scream of the Mighty Eagle the eagil anointing amen when you hear that voice of the prophet of God telling you amen who you really are where you come from am amen amen what you have inside of you amen the potentials that are in there amen hallelujah GL glory to God you are now a Son of God yes Lord you are now amen in God's perfect eyes not we will be that's right brother B I'm said and I

that picture was taking right right Dr Bess was a Baptist preacher stood up and said where is that old Divine healer at I don't believe in no Divine healings come on brother Bosworth came up he

that Divine healer down here then he said well we'll have we'll have Divine Healing but we'll have it in the Millennium right what do we need Divine him the Millennium for yeah see what I'm saying

right amen hallelujah oh glory to God someone will say uh uh isn't isn't there a famine coming in the natural why are we going to need these things brothers and sisters see that's why God as I said last night he never is going to back up something that is only for sure that's right he's not going to back up something that is only to to say hey I'm a big shot here and you know no brothers and sisters it's in the line of duty amen when it's needed you already have it in you but you have to have the recognition that you have it in you amen and that's the thing we can't step out of boundary we can't step out of line amen we got to be in line amen didn't brother say get back in line we got to stay in line Marching In the word we can't get off the beaten path we can't get off track we can't get off Rhythm we got to be in the in the Rhythm amen that the director is giving it must be in the spirit of the composer amen hallelujah so when we see that we we're we're in step with the word amen we're marching but the B says she begin to get off of the earth begin to go up amen you see and when she begin to get off a step is when she was already in the air you ever thought about that surely you see how that's that that is speaking of a spiritual walk yes she was she was already in the air and she began to get off a step that ain't the Rapture friends come on now ain't nobody in in the Rapture going to be you know trying to go somewhere else you see what I'm saying oh that's happening now that's right you see what I'm saying oh that ain't in the Rapture that's right she's in the air now Hallelujah glory to God she's come off of the Earth come up here amen glory to God she's come up to that place see and this is where amen that's why when we fail to obey that Voice come on Amen remember in it is the rising of the Sun but Ram said my mother had this dream I remember one time when I first preached he said many years ago I was preaching right here at this church and she had a dream to dream that I was standing here by the side three steps I was standing preaching to everybody that they must walk up these three steps before they hit the highway on that highway there a little pearly light white line right run right into the doors of Heaven to the Pearly gate yeah and that Pearl had been stretched out to the top of three steps if that ain't my message exactly today amen justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and I was saying that a person has to come by these three steps to be able to walk on that highway there was a lady that came you know what kind of shoes people wore 35 years ago there was a lady come by that had a great big pair like they wear today he'll shoes come on sisters yes she come by and said wait a minute sister I said wait a minute sister you can't walk that Highway with that I said you can't do that see that's the voice of God to us that's right didn't he say I'm the voice of God to youen amen we've got to obey that voice amen amen obedience is better than sacrifice amen yes sir amen and she says here look wait a minut minute sister you can't do that she said ah she said look around at the rest of the women said don't believe him she said don't believe him oh brother is that Spirit around today a't that Spirit moving around today well she she's the top of the church come on that's right amen oh my that doesn't want perfection oh my goodness I'm going say it again that's the church in this last day that doesn't want Perfection right she said I don't need that all I need is justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost and I'm okay you see that was okay for another day sure Hallelujah but it ain't okay for now that's right come on this is another day brothers and sisters this is an age of perfection that God is requiring Perfection am he's demanding Perfection Hallelujah and he has something here for us to bring us into that Perfection hallelujah it's the perfect word that you can be created inside of you a perfect Faith Hallelujah and that perfect love to have the character with that perfect Faith that's right amen Authority power without character is satanic that's right God can't put us in a position amen of authority and power if we don't have that love if we don't have that character amen it gets to people's head many times amen it's not supposed to get to our head supposed to get to our [Applause] heart Hallelujah not to our head to our heart and because God knows it can get to our head he won't give us that he can entrust us with that that's true but what we're being created in the image of Christ Hallelujah when we're denying ourselves yes when he is made perfect in our weakness that's right that's right Hallelujah that's a perfection amen amen Perfection is not what you can do that's right Perfection is what you can allow him to do fre my works is as filthy rags Hallelujah I'm the cheapest of Sinners Hallelujah but by his grace he can lift up amen this dirty vessel out of the myy clay he can wash it he can sanctify it he can feel it and he can use it for his honor and Glory that's right see he says here she said don't listen to him don't believe him he's a mad man see don't believe him she said I'll show you see she's teaching she's teaching I'll show you other churches brother I'll show you other sisters you understand yes that I can be justified Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost and still walk like [Music] this he says I just let her go couldn't do no more about it couldn't stop her she jumped up on the highway she looked back at the sister and said see I told you she she started to run up you know as the Bible said in Isaiah 5 for the fifth chapter they would have outstretched necks they they pitch over like that mining mening they have to twist mening as they go making the the tinkling with their heels the daughters of Zion on the last days see she started up the highway just as hard as she could run and after a while the road got narrower yes glory to God that's right real narrow amen yep you have chosen the right choice amen the right path yes sir the right way this is my way amen the Bible say if you receive a prophet in the name of a prophet yes you receive a prophet's reward yes what is a huge portion of Heaven Brother come on you know what brother Tau about that huge portion of Heaven oh brother glory to God in Paradox 61 he said I always wondered about that huge portion of heaven then he said I got to thinking it's not over there on the other side that's right he said that's here before we go huge portion of Heaven brother Oh Glory is that positioning in Christ thank you Lord amen that's a huge portion of heaven when brother bam if you look up quotes on the word is settled forever in heaven brother bam says that Psalm remember the Psalm 119 amen oh Lord Thy word is settled forever in heaven that's right brother B teaches on that and he says if God's word is settled in heaven y amen he says and if a portion of Heaven if a little portion of Heaven is in our hearts he says then it's settled here a what a portion a portion of Heaven inside of you glory to God amen amen and he told the prophet of God amen under prophecy is that right a huge portion of Heaven awaits the amen not just a little portion you see a little portion was in Luther wow that's good A little portion was in West a little portion was in the Pentecostal amen but this is a huge portion this is perfection glory to God this is a huge portion of Heaven oh you yes on this side is that right and what happened it got narrower and she started reeling meaning like that and off she went and mother said the most horrible screams that I ever heard in my life was that woman falling into the Flames of smoke going down like that I turned around and I said see she just obeyed everything but one word one word everything but one word sure Pentecostal women can be saved Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost and then fail that's right absolutely man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God see see she failed it and as I said she would have went on all right but she failed to listen telling her what was ahead here's he's wrote the Gospel by the disciples Apostles and the doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets and so forth and they won't listen that's right you see Justified Sanctified fill with the Holy Ghost right oh brother it this is our Perfection amen we're required all of that plus amen every word glory to God how many believe that yes sir how don't you say Amen in this hour so when we look then at hold on at this scripture let's just go a little further here amen amen amen he says in the token without us they cannot raise their dependent on us for God promised he would have it and somebody's going to be there he says I don't know who it's going to be but somebody's going to receive it the only thing I'm responsible is to preach it it's God's business to look out for that predestinated seed because they're going to be there are you here amen hallelujah amen can you respond to this call that he's making in his word amen they're going to be there Hallelujah and he says because they're going to be there each one of them one with the other the water age the blood age and now the token age that's right Hallelujah this is the token age this is a Perfection age I'll be with you see didn't Jesus promise I'll be with you he says I'll be in the Lutheran age I'll be in the Wesleyan age I'll be in the Pentecostal age but

is in you already that's what the prophet said and oh my I wish I could run back that back there to my suitcase and grab brother R's notes on the Rapture message good stuff you know what brother bam said in his notes what he wrote about the rapture the way he wrote it down in his notes he didn't say it like that right what he said and when we know in the Rapture message he said the Rapture is a revelation y only for the Bride come on is that right that's not what he wrote in his notes he said the Rapture is a revelation of the Bride Church not to her of [Applause] her right that's right brother it's in no it's I hope this ain't out of order amen praise the Lord Brother Bill look the Rapture is in you brothers and sisters we have to get this idea out of us that it's an event come on now preach it we got to get this this this traditional way of thinking out of us we know that the come there's a literal coming of the Lord Brother B said you can't be a Christian and not believe in the literal coming of the Lord that's right that's right is that right that's right he said if you're a Christian You've Got to Believe In the literal coming of the Lord Jesus Christ here's where brother Drew this is his drawing of statue of a perfect man yes this is his notes on the rapure yes come on now it says the Rapture Psalm 27 says we are warn that the doctrine will be scorned in the last days second Peter he has his scriptures right there he said and he writes read then he then he draws a line and he says but it is the revelation of his bride church amen what is the rapture right what is the what is the rapture come on now the revelation of the right church is this all right without Revelation there cannot cannot be Faith that's right faith is something that has been revealed to you he says like Abraham amen the Rapture is a revelation is that right and where do Revelation lay brother does it lay in the air somewhere floating around Hallelujah does it does it lay up there in heaven come on where's Revelation in your mind in your flesh where's Revelation it's got to be in your soul that's the only res of the word of God and if that Revelation is in you Amen brother Ram said the Rapture is already in you right in the message the shows the father and suffices and he says I know that that kind of resent he says I felt a resentment in that that's right he says in other words people are not used to hearing that we're waiting for the Rapture you see what I'm saying brother the raptes inside of you amen hallelujah it's in you it's a power it's a life it's a person amen it's simply the Holy Ghost that's what hallelujah amen what is the resurrection he said I am the resurrection amen what is the rapture amen it's him it's him it's him Hallelujah Christ is a mystery of God revealed and the bride is what was hidden in Christ amen and is revealed also hallelujah amen Christ was hidden in God and he was revealed and we were hidden in Christ and we are revealed hallelujah amen GL to God Amen so the Rapture is a revelation of you Glory Hallelujah amen it's a revelation of you of your predestinated life Glory brother said it's only for the elected bride of Jesus Christ yes come on now amen that's right so what what would be the use of somebody having all this knowledge understanding about the Rapture and he ain't going that's right that's right what's the use of it over I can show you all over right here this is what the Rapture means you see what I'm saying yeah yes we can debate all day about the Rapture is but simply brother it's it's got to be in you or not that's right you're either going or not yes amen amen we're either going to make it or not we going to be changing a moment to in my or not that's right the show's coming Hallelujah glory to God but there's got to be a people in Perfection yeah or there won't be no Resurrection oh there won't be no rapure amen can you say amen amen oh my Bible says in m 2 three Witnesses amen 2 Corinthians 13 amen I've read a lot more quotes than that brother keep saying the same thing over and over amen look what he says stat of a perfect man I like this one because we have we have an idea and I I I want to hurry up here we have an idea many times that all we need and it's true we need faith we need a Doctrine amen right that's right yes sir but sometimes we think that's all we need look what brother says right here in the Statue of a perfect man is this okay come on amen he says remember what Paul says that's a perfect man said over here in Hebrews 11 he says let me read it for you so brother R reads Hebrews 11 32-40 the scripture we read and he follows it with this statement right here right after he reads it he says do you get it those people who died are depending and waiting on us so this church has got to come to Perfection that's right in order to bring the resurrection amen and there under Souls under the altar waiting for this church to come come to its Perfection that when Christ does come and this church you see is coming smaller in the minority that's right it's becoming smaller and smaller he says it's a whole lot sharper here at the top see then just like right down here it comes to a needle point until the church in the minority has got to get into a place until it's the same kind of a Ministry that this left that's that's right because when this headstone comes back it's got a little pocket like in here where it's going to sit right in there on the regular pyramid it just isn't a cat that sits across the top it's a little flange that's right and it's got to sit on there cuz it sheds the water Hallelujah and when it comes this church has got to be so home all these the rest of the stones in the pyramid are laying so perfect till you can't run a razor blade between them weighing Tong weighing laying in there how they got up them up I don't they don't know but they were built and up here when the pyramid cat does come the pyramid itself the body of Christ will have to be home not just some Creed or doctrine that's right or something other that we come through you see that's right not just having a Doctrine or a Creed or something not just that it will have to be perfectly like Christ when he comes he and that ministry will fit right smack together see then will come the Rapture and the going home Hallelujah can you say Amen church that stone questions and answerers 64 this one's a this one's a stinger watch out now come on questions and answer 64 y it will only fit on the top foundation that stone will not fit there on the bottom foundation on the second foundation on the third Foundation it'll only fit on the top foundation amen now listen to this brother Joe he says when the entire building has become fitted to the stone and Jesus cannot come until a church Church come on a body of Believers and the ministry that he once had will have to be the same as it was then amen and then that brings that's it them without us are not made perfect Paul said in Hebrews 11 without us they cannot be perfect that's right they this last day group they must have this ministry to raise up the Lutheran GL to raise up the Wesley and all of them down there Through the Ages W GL to God Amen when that come when that part of the word where the Eagles is gathered the where the car is is there the Eagles shall be gathered he said oh just perfect I hope that answered the question amen hallelujah oh glory to God Amen then it answer the question for you oh my glory amen brother and sister we believe in the future things sure yes yes yes we believe in what was that's right but we have to recognize now amen what is taking place now amen God is dealing the holy spirit is on Earth moving working perfecting a church yes is that right amen amen where is deity it's not in heaven it's in you but Satan is trying to keep you down trying to tell you your You're Something T down nothing that's right amen well you got to recognize Hallelujah God PR Destin to live in this last day for a purpose you can take that scripture and say I shall not die but I will live to declare the works of God Amen you can take that scripture Hallelujah and stand here this last day come on to say I'm one of them and Satan just like Paul had that revelation God had promised him you're going to room come on Hallelujah glory of God come on and he has promised us we're going to be in the Rapture we're going to live to that hour so nothing can stop that from taking place in your life until that is fulfill I don't care what it is don't be afraid of no cancer you can't die it's not God's perfect will for you to die on sickness no sir you got the authority to cast that thing down yes sir on Amen but if God is with you then he'll take you sure right and until then God or Satan can't touch you is that right oh my goodness so brother Paul knew I'm going to Rome that's right knew that ain't nothing in this world going to stop me from going there that's right hallelujah oh my agabus prophesied and told him when you go to Jerusalem they'll buy you that's right he said I'm going anyway right right stop me exactly brother he said the Holy Spirit has given me warning of this in every city that I go y he knew already is that right Hallelujah then he's on the he's on the boat boat crashes Glory oh my Hallelujah wrong amen hey what's going on Paul he said fear not be of good cheer for the angel of the Lord has still me tonight hallelujah amen glory I I can't die what are you talking about oh everybody in the PO we're going to die Paul we're about to die oh going to sink and drown Paul has that assur Glory I can't die I shall live to declare the works of the Lord hallelujah if God has promised you something and you know that promise is for you take a hold of it and nothing will hinder it from coming to pass Hallelujah is there going to be a people alive at the coming of the Lord that's right amen is there going to be a people no doubt some might Le before them the maybe some that are sitting here we don't know right brother said we're not promised tomorrow you can go out and have an accident right amen but somebody's going to fulfill the scripture yes somebody's got to be alive and I'm telling you we're so close to this thing brother that's right amen are that I believe brother Ram said this and this I was telling brother Frank just this recently and the message flashing red light of his coming he said the generation that sees the apostasy will not will not leave until the coming of the Lord here yes sir yes sir this is that generation yes sir that's right yes sir where's the falling away in the denomination sir no sir oh no the falling away has to be in the church in the call down Amen in those that have been called out by this message denominations that's the church that's the call out so brother and sister the generation that sees a falling away the apostasy they will not pass you see Jesus spoke that about the Jews and about the generation that would see the Jews being restored back Pig tree putting forth his butts brother B brought a little closer here that's right said the generation that's right has sees this falling away will not pass brother and sister we're here and we can see these things and we we we got to recognize now I'm closing here got a whole lot more to say but can't say it all in one service right amen how many love the Lord amen Amen brother we're in the heat the battle yes sir We're In the Heat of the battle that's right brother the battle is Raging amen but brother Ram said In the Heat of the battle why little Beth here something has got to be done that's right listen what he says we was boys once were a grown up being now am the fight is on right I remember the saw dust bow upon the floor people screamed shouted Y and you couldn't get around the place nowhere that's right here for the people but it's not that way today the battle is on that's right right this what he says oh it's not William Bram the little boy preacher anymore you've got to produce something y amen something's got to be produced amen there's got to be manifestation yes Amen brother said that's what the Holy Ghost is in your soul for that when he says speak you speak when he says go here you go that's what it's for it's to lead you is to control you is to do his will his work in obedience following the spirit following the word amen have have you caught what the spirit has been trying to say to us last night and today thank you Lord same thing be faithful to what God has called you to be be true that's right to what God has called you is that right just follow the leading of the spirit amen he'll lead you truth just stay there amen don't go don't follow the left to the right just follow him amen don't follow nobody else's ideas follow him and he'll lead you to the truth he'll lead you to the word he'll lead you to places that you never even thought existed right amen he'll need you to quote that you said where where was that all this time I read that message so many times never seen that before that right just follow him amen let him do the leading brother BR says sometimes in this walk amen we we we grab a hold of our brother we're walking together amen but he says sometimes our brother there begins to pull in a different direction he says we try to stretch as much as we can to still hold on to you remember brother ra say that oh yeah he says but then he keeps pushing that way and we have to let go right we try to hold on brothers and sisters but there comes a time that we can't pull we can't be pulled into that direction we have to let go and continue on is that right stand at your feet thank oh man we're about 3/4 of the way of this little message here but we we got to stop here hallelujah so notice God's word so perfect and so real we're going to a perfect place brothers and sister things that are to be he says he said be it's a perfect place calling you to that Perfection you have to be perfect to get there the Bible said be ye therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect it's a perfect Kingdom so it must be a perfect people that comes there because you have to stand and be married to a perfect Son of God and you must be a perfect Perfect Bride so how can you do it through anything else but the perfect word of God brothers and sisters Lord that's the reality of what God brought this message to us for in this day said you can't teach Supernatural things Pentecostal babies it has to be those who are we from the milk right amen that's right brother M said there's Pentecostal babies there's Methodist babies Nazarene babies but the angel told the prophet of God in the in the vision amen when he was at the lake trying to lace the baby shoe said you can't teach Supernatural things that's right to Pentecostal babies brother BR said and souls in prison now he said see the spirit of Judas he can live right up to that spot but then he shows his colors right he says when it comes to God speaking squirrels into existence yes that's what he said Judah says that's too deep that's what he said brother and sister this is the hour that we live in and the unveiling of God 64 he said I hope that you're spiritual enough that you can catch what has been said that's right without saying it right out amen so I hope today man we all understand what God is requiring of of us in this day Paul said in part we know in part we prophesy but when that which is perfect is come that which is in part shall be done away so all these little things are jumping up and down like a kid trying to talk in tongues and these are the things when that which is perfect and we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication yes amen then when that which is perfect is done away with when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child but when I became a man put away childish things [Music] brother said this is a place where the church got to come to maturity he said the reason why God can't place many times his sons says because they're always running around with every R of doct someone comes up with something and they're strayed that way someone else comes up with something else new and they're straight that way brother and sister let's just stay with this amen let's just stay with Lord forget about everything else stay with the word it's an immovable Rock it's a movable place [Music] and if something has been said today to challenge you amen it challenges me that's right it challenges all of us do you understand thank you perfect love perfect Faith a perfect word amen the stature of a perfect [Music] man a perfect Son of God that we're going to meet near a perfect body amen yes Lord It's all speaking of perfection amen perfect character like his that's what he's going to come looking for Rebecca had to have that character amen that's the that's the character of Christ and brother renam said something that always has stuck with me he said he won't settle for nothing else but his own life that's right he won't settle for nothing else but to see his own reflection that's right right that's all he's going to settle for brothers and sisters amen that he can say this is Flesh of My Flesh this is bone of my bone this is Isha yes amen amen this is my wife not just a bride anymore this is maturity time a bride has still got to learn some things about being a wife is that right brothers and sisters a bride is still not mature yet she she's still learning things but a wife she knows her responsibility right she knows her position amen yes and this is what brother Ram said you don't have to take my word for it the prophet of God told us when that bride recognizes who she is and her position in the word the Rapture will take place is that what he said brothers and sisters we have to recognize are we in unity with Christ are we coming into that intimacy with him are we come into that King's chamber Hallelujah to step into that place where only it's it's you and him there no one else there it's just you and him amen we can Fellowship around something where we all can gather around it maybe in the kitchen in the living room but in there it's in personal life with Christ brothers and sisters really what it boils down to is do you have that in you is that life there amen are we ready for that brother Ram said all those filled with the Holy Ghost will be in that rapture that's what the prophet said you see but the Holy Ghost in This Hour is given imp Perfection sanctification made way justification made way for sanctification sanctification made way for the baptism of Holy Spirit bapm of the Holy Spirit made way for the holy spirit in Perfection that's the prophet said the message Masterpiece the holy spirit in perfection [Music] and you are in a raptured condition already isolated from the rest of the world Hallelujah then you're getting into bride material now you're getting into rapturing condition now [Music] let us bow our heads and our [Music] hearts can you take God's promise can you take his word and even though if the if the Viper comes to bite you like it did Paul you can shake it off throw it in the fire amen you can bind it you can cast it in the fire you can take the promise and say I will not die but I shall live the Great Mighty Angel Christ has come down to loose me from the sentence of death Heavenly [Music] Father God your word is so precious and so real to us
