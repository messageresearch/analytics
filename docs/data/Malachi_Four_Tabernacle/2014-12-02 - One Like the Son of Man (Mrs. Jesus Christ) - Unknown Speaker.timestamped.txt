[13:18] world and try
[13:21] them that are upon the Earth brother
[13:24] says this this
[13:27] temptation is exactly like the
[13:31] Temptation Of
[13:33] Eden the same
[13:35] Temptation that happened in the Garden
[13:37] of Eden it's going to come at the end
[13:40] time upon all the world and what is this
[13:44] it's it's an inviting
[13:47] proposition held up in direct
[13:50] opposition of God's
[13:52] commandment but notice the very elect
[13:57] will not be fooled the Temptation will
[14:00] come as
[14:02] follows The ecumenical
[14:05] move that has started what seems a
[14:08] beautiful blessed
[14:11] principle Christ prayed that we all be
[14:16] one become so
[14:19] strong
[14:20] politically that she Bears
[14:24] pressure upon the government to cause
[14:27] all to join with
[14:30] her amen amen and
[14:34] adher to the
[14:36] principles enacted into
[14:39] law so that no people will be
[14:43] recognized as actual
[14:46] churches unless they are in direct or
[14:50] indirect
[14:55] denomination did you
[14:57] hear you will not be
[15:00] acknowledged as
[15:02] churches unless you are direct or
[15:14] indirect already in the message now that
[15:19] indirectly
[15:21] indirectly they're part of that
[15:24] already you say that can't be so people
[15:26] in the
[15:27] message
[15:31] right
[15:33] brother
[15:36] indirectly and the little
[15:40] groups yes will
[15:46] lose
[15:47] uh privileges amen until they lose all
[15:53] property and spiritual
[15:56] rights with the people
[15:59] unless the local Ministerial
[16:03] Association
[16:06] approves in most
[16:10] cities most
[16:12] cities one cannot rent a
[16:16] building for religious
[16:20] Services amen am unless you're part of
[16:23] the
[16:25] organization you cannot rent buildings
[16:30] unless you're part of the
[16:32] organization to become chapain of the
[16:34] Armed
[16:36] Forces or hospitals it is now
[16:41] mandatory to accept the trinitarian eal
[16:47] groups Prophet saying this in this back
[16:53] there eal
[16:55] groups this pressure will increase and
[17:00] increase harder and harder to
[17:04] resist is to lose
[17:07] privilege so many will be
[17:10] tempted and will feel that it is
[17:14] better to serve God
[17:20] publicly than not to serve God at
[17:23] all
[17:25] publicly but
[17:27] they
[17:29] to believe the devil's
[17:31] lie is to serve
[17:34] Satan even though you may want to call
[17:36] him
[17:37] Jehovah or whatever you want to call him
[17:41] but the elect will not be
[17:43] deceived furthermore the elect will not
[17:47] only be
[17:49] kept but as this move becomes the image
[17:52] Ed to the
[17:56] Beast the Saints will be gone in the
[18:00] Rapture hallelujah hallelujah they will
[18:03] be taken
[18:09] away brother there's to

[33:51] different a lot of people want to
[33:55] make want to make brother Adam
[33:58] seem like he wanted it
[34:02] all and he didn't want to share

[34:08] character
[34:11] ofu no brother he said Lord grant this
[34:16] to
[34:19] my
[34:21] prophesy that this was going to come and
[34:24] he says notice this is the message seven
[34:28] Church
[34:29] ages that's the way it is
[34:31] today listen he heard behind him a great
[34:36] trumpet voice of a
[34:38] trumpet amen a trumpet is an
[34:42] announcement Gabriel at the coming of
[34:45] the Lord shall sound The Trumpet Of God
