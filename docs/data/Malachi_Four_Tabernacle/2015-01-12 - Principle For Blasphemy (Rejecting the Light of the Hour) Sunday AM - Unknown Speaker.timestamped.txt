[3:37] yes
[3:39] that right
[3:40] whatever you buy on earth
[3:42] in heaven whatever you lose
[4:12] pay
[4:26] but they may have a chance
[4:32] but carrie writes children
[4:35] right
[4:40] you know why i'm okay because they're
[4:42] names
[4:53] and i just heard a testimony last night
[4:55] that comes between this one i know
[4:57] from brother kenny cats

[5:41] there was nothing really to look at this
[5:45] yeah like jesus
[5:47] amen in other words she was ugly that's
[5:49] what you were saying but that's not
[6:18] said that
[6:27] he said we're always here
[6:43] one of them has been married twice now
[7:00] come on
[7:10] that's right
[7:12] that's right
[7:21] okay i'll leave you alone
[7:41] oh
[8:10] because brother and sister for carmanos
[8:12] they
[8:14] were slicker than a laugh
[8:17] yes
[8:19] of what a prophet was saying
[8:22] here
[9:27] amen
[9:28] and she says
[9:30] she overrides their own free moderate
[9:32] agency yeah
[10:16] amen
[10:49] and i thank christ jesus our lord who
[10:52] have
[10:53] enabled me for
[10:54] that he counted me faithful putting me
[10:57] into the ministry
[11:06] who was before he's speaking of himself
[11:08] a blasphemer
[11:10] and a persecutor
[11:13] i'm curious
[11:14] that
[11:16] i'm curious but i obtain mercy because i
[11:19] did it ignorantly and unbelief
[11:40] yes
[12:36] it will
[13:18] because
[15:23] proverbs 18.
[16:13] and we can eat
[16:16] our own fruits
[16:22] and they that love it because
[16:24] shall eat the fruit thereof
[16:28] amen
[16:30] i'm nervous easy
[16:34] you understand now he did that
[16:36] paul did it in ignorance
[16:40] but he was he said himself
[16:42] it was a blast
[16:47] 1963 we know
[17:01] and after a while
[18:11] that's right
[18:26] the penalty of sin
[18:29] was death
[18:32] we're all balancing those almost a
[18:34] thousand
[18:35] thinking
[18:38] foreign
[19:50] and we're gonna
[20:04] he said if
[21:00] but satan
[21:41] because i do not believe
[21:56] i believe
[22:38] is
[23:05] amen then he brought angels with him
[23:10] is that right
[23:11] and that's what other man called fallen
[23:13] angels
[23:15] that's what revelations 12 speaks of
[23:18] which is that the final was between
[23:47] jesus christ
[24:44] bit i'll tell you about them the will of
[24:46] god
[24:48] in heaven and it's him and it was
[24:50] presented to him
[24:53] but he went against that
[24:55] foreign
[25:12] in other words the
[25:50] because when satan come to the earth
[26:08] hey
[26:37] the first verse
[26:41] amen i mean so when the angels fell
[26:44] brother
[26:45] all the angels that ever failed
[27:00] what is happening in this world
[27:18] that is what has
[27:29] foreign
[27:43] foreign
[28:28] yes
[30:20] foreign
[31:02] because
[31:15] that began in the beginning
[31:30] come
[32:08] a greater kingdom than michael christ
[32:11] yes
[32:40] is
[32:53] do you think we'll have automobiles
[33:33] they don't know what to do but to unite
[33:36] with a
[33:59] and they still need this
[34:17] the people didn't call me
[34:20] they know
[34:21] god called me
[34:22] up
[34:23] god called you
[34:26] if someone thought if someone called you
[34:28] into this mess
[34:30] then someone else can take you away
[34:44] amen amen
[34:46] that's why paul said they went from us
[34:48] because they wasn't us
[34:51] how many people are laying in the
[34:52] message what they're doing
[34:54] i'm leaving the message

[39:32] done and that should be done
[39:36] oh
[40:03] but just because it doesn't work
[40:36] see
[40:50] is
[41:02] building a christian economy
[41:45] and you see what they become
[42:42] there's only
[42:53] amen so that we can get a better
[42:55] understanding of what we're saying

[53:38] man's filter
[53:53] so why did you do
[54:08] and
[55:17] for the world
[55:30] for something that's not the word

[55:57] the days of miracles
[56:28] if they don't
[56:43] i don't condemn you
