come and drink father there there's a fountain open in the House of David for sin and [Music] uncleanliness there's a fountain open for those who are thirsting for the Living God as David said my soul panteth after the water Brooks I thirst for the Living God not a his hisorical God but a living God the great I am not I was or I will be but I am that I amen the everpresent never failing presence of the Lord Jesus Christ Lord that's what we want father that's what our heart's desire is God and we just ask you to come and take total control of each one father as we come Lord in your service we ask that you bless the word bless us together in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you this morning amen Give the Lord a hand clap of Praise love the Lord this [Applause] morning he wonderful amen God bless each and every one of you and I just like to say uh thank the church thank the group thank everybody for their efforts for their Hospitality just for making me and my family and and the group that came with us welcome we thank we thank you very much brother Frank God bless you thank you very much uh just for everything that you've done for us amen uh let us open our Bibles this morning God bless you amen how you ready for God's word amen hallelujah we want to open our Bibles in 1 Timothy chapter 1 read a portion of scripture here from Verse 18 First Timothy Chapter 1 Verse 18 this charge I commit unto thee son Timothy according to the prophecies which went before on thee that thou by them might as War a good Warfare amen you may be seated may the Lord add the blessings to reading of his word we'd like to speak on a subject fighting with the prophecies concerning you and uh we'd like to take for a subject he hath made us Kings and Priests amen he ha made us Kings and priest but just uh just to kind of give us a few things in which we kind of left off last night uh uh as I was telling the brother was kind of hard just to try to bring everything all in all in one service and uh we just tried to bring out a few points that would help us understand the season in which this Reign is promised to us and I believe that the Lord help us to see that and we can see by his grace that it's during the time of the opening of the seals the word of God becoming PL becoming known to us in this hour and that is what uh that is what this message really come to do amen it come to Quicken the scriptures to us things that were hidden things that were loose or loose sins he come to tie everything and come to show us that it is Christ revealed in his own word amen he come to show us that that Christ is the mystery that was hid but is now revealed amen he come to show us that he is the principal theme of this scripture this Bible and he said that that mystery is throughout the entire scripture and every personage and every character of The Bible we can see that mystery unfolding itself in types and different stories but when we look at it now Through The Eyes of this message it doesn't it's not just stories anymore no it's not just types anymore now it becomes a reality it becomes a shadow of what is taking place or what has taken place in this day and I believe that's the the the understanding that we should have when we look at things in the scripture we should always as brother bradam taught us bring that up to date bring it to the present hour that we're living in amen cuz God is is not a god of History the r preach lifting him up out of History right amen we have to bring him to the present tense that's right yes sir amen God did not leave amen you know 50 years ago he did not leave 40 years ago he is still here this morning amen and the thing is like brother R said it's it's we as uh human beings as people as the church as whatever we want to see individuals that get away from God get away from the word and that is what stops as we we saw last night it stops the rain it stops the Revival it stops the blessings of God but when we come back to the word that's right when we get in line with the word amen like that Vision brother randam had of the Bride marching he said she was from All Nations is that right that's something we must take uh uh very very very deep under consideration and Ponder and meditate on that because many times we can get in a and an idea that uh you know it's just just a little circle or just a little church here a little church there but brother bam saw a vision of the Bride of Jesus Christ around the world is that right remember that 1964 he saw that vision and he says she was made out of all Nations amen and were all dressed in their National Guard and they were all marching and they began to to to uh come off the ground as they were marching they begin to March to the air is that right and as they were going up uh some began to get out of line and brother brandom screaming the vision get back in line amen stay in line with the word amen and this is what uh I believe that we should echo in this hour is we should be that that voice of God echoing the same thing stay in line stay in the message of God this is our TI poost this is this is our absolute this is where we have our foundation amen and when we stay in line of this message and what the context of it is then is it's it's not hard to continue on marching towards the glory of God Amen then we'll begin to see his word have an effect we'll begin to see his Spirit fulfilling what he promised and that's what we want to see amen that's what my heart's desire is and I believe that's what your heart's desire is amen is we want to see what brother Bram said come to pass amen we want to see what he what he promised through the through thus sayith the Lord coming to pass in me coming to pass in you yes sir that's right there's promises there's prophecies concerning you amen that's what we want to speak of that's why we took this scripture here in 1 Timothy 1:8 because this is Paul the messenger of the age telling a young man in his day amen he's telling him in his day that there is prophecies that have went on on thee that by them by those prophecies thy might War a good Warfare amen so this is what we we want to speak on tonight but when we look at what we were uh this morning I'm sorry but we when we look at what we were uh looking at last night uh we see the season what what is the rain for is to is to Quicken God's word amen is as we said there at the end is to lift us up as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be at the coming of the son of man Amen in the days of Noah he knew the time in which that cloud was to come and that rain was to begin to fall down is that right and and and what what did that was brother R said God's promise for that hour to be given in which that R was going to transform amen that's what that did it was to transform that that uh that Ark of Safety from the ground to the skies this is from the message God's power to transform now we're just touching a few more things here to kind of close out last night and just get into enter in into you'll see how this connects right into what we want to speak this morning brother M says God's power to trans trans form he said now notice in Noah's time seeing the word being erected to float he calls the ark the word amen and the Word was being erected to float amen and he had put all this together and then he says now let me make a remark the word being put together for to be transformed from the ground to the skies amen amen from the ground to the skies amen so once the ark was put together yes Lord amen once he had laid everything in there yes sir come on now he had to wait for the promised rain yes sir of that time is that right now he had to wait okay God and and Noah Hallelujah was the only one that knew when that rain was about to fall because God told him get you and your family in the ark amen and how many know that brother brandham said in 1964 amen he said that this is the time where the door is being closed he said amen that's why we must get our families in we must get ourselves in is that right amen the door is closed brother this is a serious hour time is getting is Getting Thinner and thinner we feel the pressure don't we don't we see time flying by faster and faster all the time look how fast uh uh 200 what 14 went by is that right didn't that go fast oh I'm telling you go went by real fast yeah and in 2013 went fast and 14 went faster amen and here we are you know just beginning 2015 and S almost you know mid year already it's it's it's time that's prophecy the scripture being fulfilled but you know it's a glorious thing because the Bible said it's for the elect sake hallelujah it's for the sake of the elect amen amen oh my Hallelujah and and brother bam also said the message let off the pressure he said it's Satan pressing down on us he said it's Satan it's the enemy pressing down he said to get us under pressure he said that when we're under that pressure he said we make the wrong decision yes sir that's right we say things that we normally wouldn't say when we're not under pressure he said help us is that right that's true when you're under pressure you say things just in the in the Moment In the Heat of the Moment you wouldn't say he said if you would sit down and think about it and ponder it and say okay let me let me think about this see and then and then act it out but when you're under pressure you just do things yeah that you normally wouldn't do and brother B said that's why we should let off the pressure how many are here to let off the pressure brother we come to have church this morning Hallelujah said something let it off let off the pressure at the bar drinking my some let off the pressure they go out in the world they do all their their things amen but when he said we come to the house of God and we come to let off our pressure here right we shouldn't leave this building here today with that pressure in us we should come out praising God and that burden off of our shoulders amen give give our burdens to the Lord whatever you're worried about give it to the Lord Hallelujah you should come out free light how many knows what it what it is to feel like when you come out amen amen hallelujah true yes sir amen and that's the thing brother that in this time of pressure yes we have to find the Avenue in which God is wanting to direct us to bring us up higher and higher and higher am because the same water that saved Noah and his family condemned the world that's right the same water that was lifting up the word was drowning the unbeliever yes right right amen the same water that was lifting him up he says right here in souls in prison now he says Noah's Ministry all Ministries done the same Noah preached he said he went into the ark he went into the ark and it was there seven days and nothing happened his testimony preached to the Doom Noah had three pools and his third was to the Lost after the door was shut he said God let let it sit there where nobody could enter in or go out and they were inside see for on as on the seventh Mountain he says the highest mountain that's where he settled the ark where did the ark settle on the seventh Mountain amen amen see it went up up from the ground to the skies lifting up to that realm that we were talking about last night that realm of Revelation and vision yeah amen thus sayith the Lord amen that's why John heard the voice amen come up here come up hi John amen come up higher amen John's on top of the bride and I believe we're hearing that voice the same voice of a trumpet amen that's what this message is telling us come up higher get out of that that condition of Le miserable naked am come up high come to where I am Hallelujah come up to where I am amen amen and when John went up there oh he comes straight into the throne room Hallelujah he comes straight into where the throne was did you know that he didn't come to the outer court and he come to the holy place he went straight to the throne and then he be to look from the inside out that's right then he said and Before the Throne there was a seag glass then there was seven lamp uh uh lamps then he began to see but he was telling it from the inside out when John was caught up he went straight into the holy of holies Hallelujah that's what God is calling us in this hour am the ark is lifting up brother let me tell you the ark is coming up and coming out it's being it's being lifted up into the skies by what by the Water The rain that's pouring down the rain of God forming L rain it's pouring out it's water flowing from the Arian whales from the ground hallelujah it's coming down from heaven it's coming from everywhere am is that right the Arian Wells bubbling water Hallelujah the rain is fallen in the days of Noah it wasn't just rain it was water from underneath the ground and from the heaven is that right but brother says Noah was lifted above the judgments Hallelujah you believe the bride is going to be lifted up above the judgments of again a bride in this age will be lifted up Hallelujah above the judgments of God Amen and where where are we being lifted up to the seventh Peak according to what he said the seventh Mountain that's where the ark settled hallelujah amen that's where it settled you see that how many see that say Amen see so this is where we see then that that promise in this hour that's what it's doing it's lifting us up higher and higher amen yes sir amen amen that's taking us up higher and higher and this is why brother BR said in the message who is this 1959 he said now he said they they begin to ask who is this what is this what is taking place when the people begin to come out and have a Revival a people that's called out separated people a people that's free in their religion amen a people that shouts and screams and Praises God hallelujah a people that believes in signs and wonders a people that believes in the Supernatural yes sir we said yesterday at the beginning brother and sister if what was planted that seed was planted what is it going to produce yes it's got to produce according to its kind and if this is the message that has been planted in our hearts that's what it's got to produce produce what that same kind of life that same kind of that that same kind of Supernatural uh uh uh manifestation of God amen amen you see it is not just for the ministry no it's for every believer when you need it that's where people go off and they try to make something happen they try to manufacture something that's right brother but brother B said just walk humbly with God be an expectation he said expect the Supernatural and you will see the supernatural amen right the truth but let me tell you yes there's going to be times when you need it you're sure I'm going to need it you're going to need it and in those times that's when you have to know what God has instilled in you that's right that's when you have to know who you are where you stand amen that's where you have to step out in faith like brother R said uh works is Faith expressed amen if that faith is in you then your Works will Express what's in you amen that's right you're going to act out in faith upon the word of God Amen whatever the the the situation is whatever the circumstance is we got to know that that is instilled in us that faith is in you amen amen it's Christ in you the hope of glory amen it's the Holy Spirit brother sometimes we minimize what God has put in our hearts that's right brother what is the Holy Ghost the third person in the Trinity I'm sorry but it's God himself it's deity the holy spirit is nothing less but God in you that's right brother Hallelujah that's what it is brother man I'm saying the message the deity of Jesus Christ he said the Holy Ghost in The Believer is the same power that spoke the world into existence in them people that's got the Holy Ghost amen amen yeah brother bam said there's untapped resources the church has never touched yet that's what he said there's things laying for you and me but we got to believe it brother Hallelujah we got to believe it's for me and reach out in faith and grab a hold of the promise of God amen hallelujah that's right too many in this day are trying to push the people down and trying to oppress the people to tell them these things and these promises and these Supernatural things are not for them yeah that's why the people live under expectation that's right that's right they they live far beyond their privilege and that's why people when they face their challenges when they face their problems when they face the devil that begin to bombard their homes and their families and their minds and their lives they don't know what to do yeah yeah why because we have not recognized what God has put in our hands amen hallelujah oh my what has God put in our hands he's put the most greatest and most powerful thing you amen we should never take a backseat to the the devil step out in faith yes sir well what if it doesn't work we die trying yes sir step out believe God am and watch him come to work watch him move on the sea yes sir I believe that with all my heart I've seen it work amen yes glory and that's the thing we've got to believe and expect that amen that's why brother Ram said the voice of Jesus Christ after he resurrected how many believe he resurrected amen amen said fear not brother B says that he says you know why he said fear not he says don't fear for failure don't fear for failure fear not believe have confidence yes he says then that is what he promised and people are asking what is this why do they cry out that's why they can't hold their peace and the religious world looks on and says what's the matter with them [Music] who is this what's the cause of this may I say this what is the cause if they would only read the scriptures if they would only find out it's the spirit of Christ that has promised by God for the last days in the last days I pour out my spirit upon All Flesh there will be latter rain a rain of the spirit of God falling upon the people in the last days and he said there will also be latter and former rign in the same time now listen when the people separated themselves from sin things of the world to come out and be separated people the Holy Ghost was poured out on them they spoke with tongues they prophesied they done Miracles see it was the latter rain falling amen did you notice he didn't just leave it out without that but by that he said the former Reign also will come with the latter rain you notice what the first rain was it was his own rain amen amen let's turn to Hosea chapter 6 real quick just real quick is this okay just just to finish up what we were looking at last night and get into our message this morning Hosea chapter 6 hoseah chapter 6 verse 1 to 3 come let us return to the Lord for he ha torn and he will heal us he have smitten and he will bind us up after two days will he revive us and the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord his going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall listen he shall come this is speaking of God himself he shall come unto us as the rain amen as the latter and the former rain unto the Earth yes God is going to come to us as the rain am good good what is the rain is God himself being poured out it's his holy spirit you understand he comes to us as the rain this is a promise brother Ram read this scripture you know that you read the scripture and message recognizing your D his message yes and he said this is what's going to take place to Israel and under the seventh trumpet under the seventh trumpet to the Jews Moses and Elijah will bring them to the true atonement amen is that right and brother bam said a very key thing he said the the seventh trumpet to the Jews is the same as the seven seal to the Gentiles in other words what God's going to do for them in the future that's what he has to do with us now amen yes sir now right now under the seven seal we have him coming to us as the rain amen amen you understand for what purpose to fulfill his word to Quicken that word to bring it to pass to manifest it am amen so we see this is why he comes this way amen lifts us up brings us into that place we can come into the Fulfillment of that you believe that amen that's why we sing Let It Rain is that right now you know you you you can know with some understanding what this rign is is God himself yes it's the holy spirit amen but it it it's the dynamic power yes come on it's the quickening power what quickens to Quicken means to be brought back to life after being dead that's that's what the word Quicken means come on Amen when something's dead and a quickening power yes sir amen come on and that's what the rain is it's quickening power sir when the land is dry it needs rain amen hallelujah when the rain comes Hallelujah to to produce what has been planted is that right amen yes sir and this is what has been planted what been what's been planted is to message of God am it's the message of the hour amen and it should produce that amen and brother Adam said the the the rain was his own Reign the former Reign was his own Reign then he said that was the first Reign his own Reign after that come the reign of the Apostles yes book of Acts the book of Acts yes sir the reign of the Apostles the book of Acts come on bring it and in this last days both Reigns the reign of the Apostles and the reign of the Lord Jesus is falling it is that's what's making the people cry out hosana amen hosana remember when they were screaming and hollering because Jesus was coming into the city and he was coming into the old Jerusalem Hallelujah but now he's coming into the New Jerusalem he's coming into his bride and there's a people that's welcoming him welcoming his presence welcoming his coming to the city of Jerusalem the Bible says she shall be called the city of Truth amen because the city of the perversion of that is the city of the lie that's Babylon Hallelujah but the city of Truth amen is the bride of Christ hallelujah amen yes sir is that right yes sir Hallelujah the Bible says I put a wall of fire round about you amen hallelujah this Jerusalem has a wall around around her for protection it's a wall of fire god amen that's why brother said you you said he can't go in there he said Satan can't go in there he sealed out SE in he said if he comes in then it ain't the devil no more it's your brother probably thought it was the devil but that's a joke I'm just playing amen he said if he can if he can come in right he said it ain't the devil no more why because it got to pass through that wall of fire that's good Hallelujah the wall of fire to the Holy Ghost amen that's our protection what said not even the atomic bomb can touch that Glory what are we afraid of fear not little it's your father's Good Will to give you the kingom brother we should walk like sons of the king Hallelujah we ain't afraid we've been brought out of slavery Glory but though we're solders leers in a Strange Land we still act like children of the king amen hallelujah amen oh my yes sir you believe that amen amen and this is why this is why we must hunger and thirst expect and and with all of our hearts believe these things amen we should be under that expectation every day saying Lord you promised these things father you listen to them tapes listen to that prophet and you'll hear him tell you all the time that Faith needs to be in you you got to believe God you see that's why we we should we we should get in that atmosphere friends yes sir brother Bram said get away from unbelief he said when you start to hear that negative talk all that unbelief he said get away from come around people that's got faith come around people that talks about the word come on Amen brother we're creators we create atmosphere Hallelujah whether we can create an atmosphere in here this morning that the sick will be healed with the Holy Ghost the power God will out why because he put something in US amen but we need to let it flow out of us hallelujah amen Devil's got everybody scared trying to Corner everybody when you got the very thing that can defeat him that's right that's good you've been given very power and put them under your feet hallelujah amen sickness under your feet amen fear under your feet amen put those things under your feet amen hallelujah he says in the message be not afraid it is I I told you last time I was here there was a new ministry coming I spoke with some of the Brethren today and was telling them about what's happened just remember the first time I was here you remember the Lord had told me something was going to happen change in the ministry it happened now listen it's talking about his ministry okay said it change I told you it was going to change and it happened so it changeed from the first pool to the second pool right happen he said there's another one that's going to happen amen there's another one come a one greater far greater than all the rest of them yes put together already confirmed and ready I hope it happens tonight amen I just might say that I don't have time to explain it to you but Brethren who does know about it it's wonderful amen it'd be such a a great thing for the people now listen what the third pool's for you hear It'll be such a great thing for the people I'm grateful to God that the hour is soon at hand I believe it when God this 1960 remember when God is going to help his children especially it'll be for those who can't muster the faith to rise up and get a hold of God like they should I believe the Lord is providing a way for us now to take care of them also oh take care of them who can't muster up enough faith for themselves that's what the third pool is for that's what the opening of the word is for Hallelujah anointed was at the end time he said first pool Divine Healing second pool Discerning the spirit amen yes sir he said third pool the opening of the word what he say is that right n to ones at the end time brother that's what should give us faith amen amen even when we can't when we feel weak yes brother BR said don't never say that that's right don't never confess you don't have faith that's right that's what he say oh I'm weak I don't have faith you know I'm just I'm just ju just don't have it what it takes don't never confess that you're speaking the devil's language that's right that's right you got to confess profess he's the high priest of our confession [Applause] amen and he cannot bless you until you confess he has already done it for you say I've got faith hallelujah amen I believe God Amen I'm go I'm Healed in the name of Jesus Christ no matter how you feel amen how you doing brother I'm doing just F amen glory to God how's everything going with you oh God's in control yes sir we got to we got to walk and talk the way he wants us to glory to God is that right Hallelujah especially for those who can't muster up the faith to rise up and get a hold of God like they should I believe the Lord is providing a way for us now to take care of them also some of them runs into faith that they can just reach out and receive anything that's great faith but some of them has a mustard seed faith has to wait so long to get through I believe the Lord is making a way for those people now I don't know when it'll be but it will be Hallelujah just as certain as I'm standing here it will be yes Lord you believe that Amen brother I'm telling you that's in here yes that Tower is in here yes it's laying in there but we've got to we got to open up our hearts there got to be a revelation from God hallelujah amen amen Oh Glory now I thought I would just say a few things there to encourage us and I believe this message this morning will will help help us encourage her in our faith amen we all need encouragement amen did you know that brother Bram said uh he preached one morning come out of the church he said a sister shook his hand remember that he said God bless you brother BR he said I really enjoy your message this morning man said oh thank you thank you for compliment really encouraged me he said a lot of ministers won't admit they need encouragement that's right yep he says but we all need it yes amen some say well no don't C that was the Lord or something oh yes but we need encouragement amen amen so we're just here to help you and encourage you with what we can amen amen now he hath made us Kings and Priests amen he ha made us Kings and Priests you believe that amen let's turn in the scriptures to Revelation chap 1 verse five to8 and from Jesus Christ who was the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth to him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and has made us Kings and priest unto God and his father to him be glory Dominion forever and ever amen behold he cometh with clouds every eye shall see him they also who pierced him and all kindreds of the Earth shall whail because of him even so amen I'm Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end sayith the Lord which is which was and which is to come the almighty Revelation chapter 5 verse eight when he had taken the book The Four beasts and four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vows full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song saying thou worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and H has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred tongue people and nation and H past tense h made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth amen amen now he has made us Kings and Priests it's not that he will make us Kings and Priests he has made us Kings and priest yes sir in his mind we're already Kings and Priests by predestination we're kings and we're priest amen yes sir now we see that the the the kings in the Old Testament under the law they all had to come according to the law they had to come from the tribe of Judah amen is that right that was the lineage of Kings Hallelujah the Kings of Israel amen and when they wer from that lineage there was trouble huh mhm yes but the Kings come from the tribe of Judah the lion of the tribe of Judah amen we have David we have Solomon we have these Great Men of God that were from that tribe and Reign and Rule Israel as kings and the priests according to the law they all had to come from the tribe of Levites is that right it had to be the Levites it could not be any other tribe any other people any other lineage it had to be from they had to be sons of Levi amen amen and we see then that in this hour he has made us Kings and Priests this is the day when he has appeared and he has roared as a lion amen Shing Thunders utter their voices this is a time when his priesthood is given into the hands of his church of his bride amen the spirit of God God maketh intercession in our hearts with groanings that cannot be uttered yes that's priesthood that's yes pries Hood ship amen you intercede for others is that right that's intercession that's a priest amen you come into the holy of holies you touch God you contact God it's a spirit and God in you that does the interceding amen and then King pertains to rulership to government to having Dominion amen amen and how many know that the promise to the Overcomer of leoda how many know what that promise is remember it amen to him that overcometh Revelations 3:21 will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne amen and brother bam send the message how overcome he said to have a throne is to have a Dominion a kingship amen amen he said and this is from Everlasting to Everlasting this he said the kingdom is as far as his boundaries go amen that's what Dominion you have uh uh within those boundaries but brother said these boundaries is from eternity to Eternity amen these boundaries is from Everlasting to Everlasting now that is where God has placed us now just think about this amen it should make us feel a lot more smaller instead of a lot more bigger to think about how great God is and his great power and dominion and then give that over into our hands amen amen and make us coair with Christ amen amen Oh Glory to God Amen amen now notice that the scriptures are telling us in the past tense they're not saying you will be he have made us Kings and Priests amen now this is my predestination because everything in our life is pre-planned you believe that amen amen and the message things that are to be 1965 brother BR says your birth here was pre-planned amen amen every one of you knows that our birth was pre-planned oh my amen you didn't come here by accident even if your parents said you were an accident amen hallelujah it was replanned by God glory every one of you knows that your birth was replanned do you know that your being here never originated just as a myth or a thought everything was all pre-planned by God before the foundation of the world the infinite God know and to be infinite he had to know every flea that would ever be on the earth and how many times would B his eyes see infinite our little Minds cannot fathom what infinite means if we know the word of God we know where we are living we know the hour that we are living we know what lies ahead and we see what has passed now the book of God his revelation of Jesus Christ his Works Through the Ages revealing and showing what it was now God cannot speak any word without it being confirmed and every word that he says has to come to pass amen every word of God has to come to pass he says again you were all pre-planned by God nothing happens by chance with God he knows all things about it it's all PR plan plann for many generations back so that you could be here tonight that you could be here this morning yes just think he saids I'll repeat this again at one time you was you was in your father in the gene of your father in the natural he didn't know you at that time neither did you know him then you were put in the bedding ground in the womb of your mother through holy wedlock then you become a person expressed in the image like your father there's the fellowship he said now the only way you can be a son or daughter of God is because you have eternal life amen amen amen amen this is what we want to get you to see this morning that the real you amen is that gen of God that's in your soul that's who you really are amen this outside Pres this a perversion that's bornn in sin shap in iniquity that's right but that's what devil tries to make us think we are yeah come on Hallelujah yeah oh my but the real you is the inside of the inside not predestinated did you know brother Ram said the person doesn't come predestinated how many know he said he said it's not the person that comes predestinate he said it's the Gen of God that comes predestined right amen amen now listen he says here he says now you have to have eternal life but there's only one form of eternal life and that's God the gene of your life spiritual life was in God before the foundation of the world before there was even a molecule you're you are not nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God Amen you're expressed after his word has come in you now listen to this he says after his word has come in you to light up this age yes you are expressing God's life in you after God comes to you and quickens you Hallelujah that is what the purpose of that in you is to produce light for this age that's right brother yes sir what is light brother said what is what is light the mess there's a man here that can turn on the light amen he said it's the word made flesh that's right amen it's called in you that's light that's right Hallelujah that's why when the world was in Jesus he said I the light of the world amen amen but then he turned around and he told the disciples he are that's right yes sir because that word was going to come into them and manifest Hallelujah God for that hour that's right yes sir good on is that right now listen he says here he says now you are God's expressed life because you're a son and daughter of God therefore you see what I mean you are now made you're sitting in this church this morning because your duty is to express God to this nation and to this people and to this neighborhood where you associate amen that's your duty to express God Amen wherever you are God knew you would be here because you have to be one of his genes of his attributes if you got eternal life then it's always eternal life God was and God before there was a foundation of the world knew that you would be here when the word the water washing of the water fell upon you it expressed in a being now you have fellowship with the father you're a citizen of the king not citizens but you're not only that but you're you're children Sons and Daughters of the Living God eternal life dwells in you amen and if those are those attributes of God we cannot live by Creeds no we cannot live by denominationalism no we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride what is that word bride listen what is that word bride the manifestation of this hour yes sir what is that word bride the manifestation of this our the bride not a Creed not a denomination but a living Oracle of God yes a living attribute of God displaying to the world the attributes he put in them in the formation of the Bride that's being expressed in this hour that we're now living amen and he says Martin Luther could not express those kind of attributes oh my come on brother he didn't put those attributes in Martin Luther he put them in you that's what he said Glory yes sir Hallelujah because in the beginning see he wasn't in that expression in that predestination because that was in the beginning like the corn of wheat that went in the earth you see brother and sister what we want you to see is that that's already in me amen yes sir that little e that little eaglet in the chicken coup amen he didn't know he had the potentials already inside my my my come on BR all of the potentials was already in him the potentials to Fly Like an Eagle was already in him oh come on come on is that right the potentials to fly was in him already it wasn't in them chickens it was in him but he didn't know it as he was chirping around with the rest of them eating worms things of the earth amen he wasn't looking up brother B said he saw that great shadow of the mother Eagle huah saw the shout of the almighty amen and he looked up so that that looks like me Hallelujah is that right he began to look up he hadn't looked up like that before he wasn't topat in in the in the Barnard they didn't

age in the Heavenly Sor with God and from where the cry has coming that's where we're going Glory that's the height that we're reaching Hallelujah that's why when you look at the prophet his character in his motive he wanted the church to come up to where he was he was longing for the people to reach where he was he didn't have a nickan spirit to say no just me can be here you see and that's how they many put it I'm not talking about his ministry or his position I'm talking about his his his relationship with God Amen you can be on that same level yes sir no one can ever take his position no

you understand it that's what's happening today am he predestinated it to this by his forign knowledge when he predestinated in Malachi 4 it's got to happen when he come over and predestines anything to happen in his word he had to prove his word to be so it's got to happen amen amen amen when he predestines anything to happen what he says it will happen he knows that seed will be there just at that time amen amen he's talking about Sons and Daughters of God going to be there at that time he predestinated a bride I'm reading she's going to be there there's going to be a Rapture she's going to be there amen yeah he predestinated by his forign knowledge there's nothing going to stop amen nothing can stop that no there's no there's no political power that can stop it Hallelujah there's no religious power that can stop it there's no demonic power [Music] I just told you what the pil horse is amen and the pil horse can't stop it glory to God why cuz there's an evil anointing in this Oh Glory come up here John hear the voice of the evil cry out oh yes sir to believe in the impossible Amen to believe in the Supernatural to believe in what the church says oh that can't be my modern events make clear by prophecy listen he says if you are Son of God daughter of God you were in God all the time amen he knew what bedtime you would be planted now you're made a creature a Son of God a manifested son and daughter of God to meet the challenge of this hour say again but this one is stronger want to hear what he says he says the Son and Daughter of God to meet the challenge of the hour to vindicate the true and living God oh my goodness of this hour amen the message that's coming forth in this time do I understand that correctly do I understand that correctly you are here to vindicate yes sir that's right the message that's coming forth from the Propet that's good that's strong amen that's strong in other words you manifesting that word in you you are showing that what he said yes is true that's why you got so many people leaving the message right now cuz that message is never in there you can talk about science and Rockets and everything else I want to see manifestation yes sir I don't want to just I just I I don't just want to hear Debaters debate on quotes and debate on well I think this and I think that I want to see manifest I want to see what he said what he promised being fulfilled that's right that's what it's about brother and sister yes because if we go with man's interpretation he can interpret it all away from the true thing of God but how does God interpret his word he interprets it by bringing it to pass that's the interpretation what it's fulfilled amen that's why we need manifestation and that is the interpretation oh GL we can debate well I don't think it means that watch it manifest and that's what it mean said as long this is what brother R said he said as long as you quote the people look what it says right here look what it says he said they have a reason to doubt you yeah yes yes he said but when what you're pointing to is manifested in you amen he said now they can't if they do it's sin yes yes yeah to disbelieve that's true brother amen we can we can say well it's this well it's that you have a right sure you have a right to say well I don't know sure right but when you see it manifested amen When You See It fulfilled that's the interpretation that's what the word says I see young amen that's what it is hallelujah amen cuz God is the only one that brings his word to pass he has to do it through somebody amen you are his hand you are his eyes you are his feet than and that mind that was in him is to be in you Hallelujah that's what this mind of Christ come to do the mind the thoughts coming down to the body amen that's the head but where's the body at that's good you are amen that's right brother said when Peter James and John went out Transfiguration he said there they were it says and there appeared Moses Elijah and Christ was transfigured how did they know how did Peter James and John know that that was Moses come on brother Ram asked that question he said they had never seen a picture of Moses they had never seen Moses they didn't know what he looked like but when they seen him appear not so that's Moses that's Elijah and that's Christ transfigured brother ra said how do they know he said because from that cloud was there a cloud on man he said because from that cloud the omnipotence the the the the in infiny of God he said come down upon them and settle over them for just a few moments that infiny of God that knowledge of God would allow them to recognize men that they had never seen before in a moment says and without a shadow of doubt they said that's Moses and that's Elijah because that was that anointing that was in that cloud so can Supernatural come down the that they can recognize who that is and brother that's the mind of Christ coming down to us in this age to let us recognize what the word is let us recognize who you are am that's the mind of Christ let us recognize what's in the word what's promised for you what's promised for me in this house amen what The Great I Am is to fulfill today amen what that Prophet was C out for the church to come up to that place am Amen brother B said people always want somebody else to do their religion for them well I'll just not do nothing I'll wait for someone to do it for me no you got a promise God Gave You amen you got to step out in faith amen amen look it is the rising of the sun 65 he says he says he hunts for his mama he's an eagle to begin with he recognizes this real Eagle recognizes the call of God's word why he's an eagle it's an eagle to an evle amen amen the word before the foundation the word to the word the word to the word the eego to the eagle Amen brother you're the same family you're the same nature you're the same [Music] Hallelujah the word to the word amen then he says the word predestinated to the word written for the hour amen yes he says and then you realize your position that's he amen amen then you realize your position you believe that amen she does not arrow with the shut he says if there is someone here or listening in out Across the Nation if they're not ready and prepared at this hour to meet the challenge of the hour the message from God see for the kingdom of God is nearing we pray that it'll be so tonight with them that they will meet this hour's challenge we pray in Jesus name amen amen what is the challenge of This Ss what is that challenge he says your big muscles won't meet the challenge of this hour rapturing Faith to take the church out of this thing before judgment strikes you judgment is fixing to strike that's the challenge of the hour amen amen that's why he said in souls in prison now uh the word living there it is amen a man that's got the spirit of God in him a woman that lives the word live the word lives right out in them that's their heart beat the predestinated for the word of the Lord comes to them amen hallelujah the word of the Lord comes to them and they are the word to the [Applause] people who a man that's got the spread in them a woman that lives the word he got the Holy Ghost in you he's talking to you see they are the word to the people written a pistol right of all men amen and then he asks is that right could the third pool be on [Music] oh amen amen living Epistles The Living Word the interpretation is that right he said three is perfection the ministry come to his Perfection when it reproduces Christ again in the natural amongst human beings that's why brother B said Creeds they can't reproduce crisis he said they can give you a good moral life a good you could be a good church person and your moral is all right straight that's good we're supposed to have a stra amen amen but he said that's all that that can do for for you he says but to reproduce Christ it takes to know him in the power of His res amen said then Christ is reproduce am amen yes brother that's why people don't understand what truly the baptism of the Holy Ghost is it's not just a some little portion you know God is is he's great he's big but you know there's just little third person of the Trin is in here just that's how we make it we don't say it but that's how we make it amen you know just just a little there's a little holy ghost in here and there's a big Holy Ghost somewhere else you see but it's not like that he didn't teach us that he taught us that the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our age is the fullness is that what he taught us questions and answers on the seals he said every age had a dip of the Holy Spirit he said but in this age it's the fullness of the baptism he said that's why he had to come himself he had to come himself am he says that's why he had to send a prophet cuz the word was coming [Applause] himself that's what he said yes and brother B said he's he's pouring out the Holy Ghost the baptis of the Holy Ghost in its fullness he said the resum of the church ages Amen in her will be the fullness of Pentecost what he say amen amen we have to realize the baptism Holy Ghost Angel is going to make us a a church member just to stop lying and stop smoking and stop drinking it's more than that amen yes brother Bram said it's more than that he said he's got to feel every fiber of your being you've got to be Christ reproduced again on the earth amen hallelujah amen she is him he said amen she is him amen he said every scripture that spoke of the bridegroom speaks of the Bride every scripture amen yes Hallelujah glory to God Amen yes sir brother unless you're Jesus again in on two feet amen reproduced again that's what this Holy Ghost come to do in this hour did we see an example of that amen did we see Jesus Christ again on two feet amen oh yes we did Brother h Hallelujah that's what God come to do for every one of us amen oh my now let us go back in the scripture quickly here I know our time is going by quick just laying in these things in here that we can see how many how many have seen by the quotes we've read so far amen that there's things that he spoke of you and we'll to be reading some more but listen 1st Samuel chapter 16 1st Samuel chapter 16 and we'll get to verse 12 how many love the Lord 1 Samuel 16 verse 12 this is when Samuel was brought sent by God to Jesse's house amen now we're going to see how this this is a type now this is a type we want to get into everybody everybody with me amen we're going to see how this ties into he made he have he hath made us Kings of and pre and we're going to see how how there's an enemy wanting to stop that from coming to pass but he can't now listen verse 12 and he sent and brought him in and he was Ruddy and with all the beautiful countenance and godly to look to goodly to look to and the Lord said arise anoint him for this is he then Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed him in in the midst of his Brethren Hallelujah and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from that day forward so Samuel rose up and went to ramth now notice there what is this scene we we familiar with this story The Bible this is the time that Saul the great king had been rejected by God Amen and here Samuel the prophet of that hour amen is coming to anoint a king you understand amen he's coming to anoint a king amen amen yes this is when he comes comes he he is anointing he came because God is going to set up his his kingdom when David is anointed king by Samuel he he doesn't come into His kingship right away does he no but he was already anointed king is that right now listen here's what we want to type out we want to look at this just for a few moments because in the message rejected King brother Raam says now he said Saul Saul [Music] sent the pieces of the ox to all Israel and said let every man that will not follow Samuel and Saul let him this be as this Ox is do you see how deceitful he tried to represent himself with the man of God how unchristian it was he's speaking of Saul the fear of the people was because of Samuel everybody hearing me the fear of the people was because of Samuel but Saul said whoever doesn't follow Samuel or me right will be like this ox and he cut up a an ox in pieces and sent them to all the people in other words we're going to chop them up right he says now notice but Saul got them all to follow him because the people feared Samuel let him come after Samuel and Saul how many times today have we heard we are the the great church the Church of God it makes the people get a fear and think that they really is where God is working they don't want the leadership of the Holy Spirit you understand they don't want the leadership of the Holy Spirit they rather they rather follow men because they like their own individual life they like to believe believe what they want to believe I'm quoting they like to believe what they want to believe do you see the holy spirit is our judge amen God never give us a pope or a bishop or anybody to judge he gave us the Holy Spirit Hallelujah that's why God told Samuel they haven't rejected you they've rejected me reject King The King theh rejected in the time of this of this hour when when men are using the prophet's name you understand hello The Prophet's name to get people to come after them [Music] yes amen right yeah he is the ego prophet Samuel is the ego Prophet a type of our prophet of this day amen is that right sa is a type of a deceitful leadership that uses his name to get people after them you understand now listen he says God never gave us God never gave us am a pop anything to to lead us anything like that is that right so he gave us the holy SP spirit amen you believe that now let me read you a prophecy from the prophet himself concerning what we just read in this type about Samuel and sa we're we're typing this out that you can see what's taking place in this day and hour you understand with me tonight today amen amen now listen he says in the message God's only provided place of worship 19th 65 he says this now listen he says if I go in this generation May the people who believe this message amen the people who believe this message never stand still for denomination yeah yeah on he says you'll die right in your track he says remember that remember that the very hour that you mention denomination among you I don't care how sincere you are you take a man for your leader instead of the Holy Spirit to confirm this word that's the hour you die yes amen that's the hour you die he's not talking about denominations brother and sister he's talking about people who follow and believe this message amen am Hallelujah the hour you take a man as your leader in send of the Holy Spirit to confirm this word that's the hour you die the genuine seed cannot because it's there's nothing left after the seed Hallelujah see it's the bride that fell the ground coming back up again amen amen hallelujah Glory look at Saul in his day using the name of Samuel to put fear in the people yeah my goodness oh to put fear in the people yes see he says how deceitful how unchristian it was the fear of the people was because of [Music] Samuel see trying to use the prophet name trying to use the message of the hour we should never use it for our own for our own fleshly motives and objectives we should never try to make that word fit us amen we should fit ourselves to that yeah right right is that righten he says in the rejected King he says he said what is the matter of God being our King well we don't see God said well I'm his representative have I ever told you anything wrong have I ever prophesied done anything has come to pass just as it said it would happen have I not told you the word of the Lord have I ever come to you and beg money from you I ever took anything from you have ever brought you anything straight but thus sayith the Lord God has Vindicated it every time that it was the truth amen he sent the thunderstorm and the rains you know the scripture there to prove the Samuel was God's mouthpiece as Samuel perfectly represented today the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is God's [Applause] mouth that speaks is exactly what the Bible said that believes just what he said amen am amen that won't vary from it but they wanted it with somebody who could tell them different the people could not say that Samuel's prophecy wasn't perfect they answered Samuel all that you have spoken in the name of the Lord has come to pass there's not one flaw you never did come to us and beg us for money you have supported your you''ve never asked us to do any great outstanding thing for you you've trusted in your god he has delivered you from all things and your words are true everything you spoke in the name of the Lord has been just as you said but we still want a king can you see the discrepancy the cunningness of the devil can work on a human being instead of yielding himself to the Holy Spirit to listen to what thus sayth the Lord is for a Pure Life undefiled character uh a see to be a a different life of peculiar people a holy nation and all acting people they'd rather they rather coincide with the world than act like the world Amen then to go to some church that says that's all right just act like that and go on can you see what it is there's no such a thing as healing and all this other baptism of Holy Ghost was just a the framework of the church in other words then God took men took the Holy Spirit out of the church and let the denomination Build It Up never was there such a thing the Holy Spirit the truth of God was to guide you until Jesus comes Hallelujah Saul come into power he had a great following he had beautiful armors he had singers he had Shields he had Spears he outshined all the rest of the Nations he brought them into into a democracy that was beyond anything that anybody had ever heard of and that's exactly what our denominations and our churches has done today amen we have the biggest church buildings in the world we have the prettiest dressed people in the world we have the highest scholarships that that can be bought like Saul's trained men who could take the spear they could move it they could maneuver it to the Nations feared them they were traed people at all but one day there come a time that there was a challenger amen amen what what did we just read earlier the challenge of the hour right the challenge of the there's a challenge in this house is there a challenge amen and look at the type in the Old Testament the challenge over there at that time at that hour see he says a challenger come out and it was it was so excited the whole is isite Army till they stood trembling in their shoes Goliath had made a challenge now listen brother no matter with all their good thing that they had with all their training with all their theology with all their education glory amen they still with all of that could not meet the challenge of that hour amen yeah yeah Hallelujah oh brother you need more than just some B yes to meet the challenge amen you need more than just the support of the people to meet the challenge you understand you need more than that Hallelujah you need God God is the only thing that can be chall I can't meet the challenge you can't meet the challenge but God in Me can you hallelujah amen oh my thank you Lord and then what happens what happens oh this is good friend amen amen are you with me amen a few more minutes is that okay I trust is that this will help us let's go to 1st Samuel 17 look the very next chapter verse one now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle and were gathered together at sh sh which belongeth to Judah and Pitch between Shaka and azaka and ephes damn amen and so and the men of Israel were gathered together in Pitch by the valley of Elo and set the b in Array against the Philistines and the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side and there was a valley between them amen hallelujah notice remember in the message greatest battle ever fought brother B said there's got to be a mutual meeting place yes when this battle takes place amen he says where's that battle taking place now it's in our mind this is where David and Goliath meet right amen why because that's the valley amen where they fight in the valley amen you go over to the Book of Joel chapter 3 it speaks of the battle of armagon yeah amen amen in the valley of decision amen calls it Valley of decision why because that's where decisions are made it's all in the scripture amen it's in there amen amen it's in the Bible amen that's where decisions are made see that's where this battle is Raging amen whatever decision we make if they're script decisions if they word decisions yes that's right or if they carnal decisions amen see what decisions are we making decision making must be according to the [Music] word because that's what we're going to act out that's what we're going to plan out amen amen so that's where the enemy is gaining ground people are trembling sa and his army can't meet that challenge brother amen and he says here and there went out a champion of the of the camp of the Philistines named Goliath of G whose height was six cubits in a span and he had a helmet of brass listen helmet of brass upon his head and he was armed with the coat of M the weight of the coat was 5,000 shekels of brass Glory you got to recognize your enemy right he had that he had ribs of brass upon his legs and a and a target of brass between his shoulders and staff of his spear was like a Weaver's beam and his Spear's head weight 16 shekels of iron and one bearing a shield went before him amen then he comes and and what he begins to do is he begins to challenge the the armies of Israel amen amen amen he begins to say who will come out and fight amen said because when the devil knows he has the upper hand amen amen he will never do it he'll never challenge like he did right there when he sees conquering Faith amen amen but he will only do it when he knows he's got you cow down that's when the church can't move is when he's got the Weaver's needle over you amen when he's got the Weaver's needle over you amen see he's got

church members we we can't manifest the word the life is challenging us to come out and fight him on the Battlegrounds to overcome those unbelieving thoughts of doubt and fear to overcome those things to make you more than just a church member make you a son of the Living God hallelujah that you're more than just some some person that knows the message and some person that manifestes the man Hallelujah that's the challenge of the hour brother got too much intellectual in this just they just all the message but that message ain't manifest got to be manif that's the challenge of the it's got to be a people that's to live out this world Amen but you're predestinated to meet the challeng of Hallelujah Amen brother B said oh I love that quote I always I always love that quote when brother B says that it works his faith Express he said there was a difference between Saul and David 1965 Faith Works his faith Express he said Saul knew God could conquer your life that's right he said he knew that he said yes I believe that God can destroy your life that was s he said but not David David didn't just know God could do it he said David [Music] believed amen went out he says the faith that was in him the faith that was in him said I'm going down amen amen I ain't going to sit back here say yes God can do it God can do it God can do it that's how many of us stand sometime yes yes oh yes I see it in the Bible all the time God can do it he did in the days of brother R oh he can do it sure but brother we have to step out and say not only do I know yes by head knowledge God can do it but there's there's a faith I believe something inside of me knows it's possible today am am it's possible right now glory to God yes Ser this was the ch listen to me why are we bringing this out because look I showed you where Samuel the prophet anointed David the top of the Bride amen amen amen amen amen you understand what did he anoint him with the Horn of oil right yes how many

that's the restoration of this time amen you [Music] see Saul knew God could do it David believed God would do it that Hallelujah notice Saul had had the same anointing at one time he was anointed by the same source that David was anointed by by the same Prophet yet there was a difference amen amen God was persuaded that David was persuaded that God would back him up so he stepped out in faith what did David do he prophesied to his enemy he didn't even have nothing in his hand he said but this day I'll cut your head [Music] off amen he said this day I'll feed your [Applause] flesh you see

according to the scriptures if you read this story that that Saul had told Jonathan in the Army you'll have no food did you know that did you know that that Army right there was starving the death why do you think David went down there to take him some food amen cuz Saul had already said and Jonathan didn't agree with him Jonathan Saul's own son didn't agree read with Saul he said no D yeah we have to feed the soldiers how they going to fight they don't have no food my goodness my that's that's a type of the spiritual how's the church going to fight if they F we got to be fed amen what are we

anointed amen and he was place he said and so is the church did he type David to the church amen oh brother oh my let me just read something real quick you know he he Tau David to something else too amen oh my he says right here in the message Christ it says when Saul was rejected by God God told the prophet take this Horn of oil and go up to anoint one of Jesse's boys Amen in his carnal way Jesse wanted his oldest son the hamom looking one and all this other see and he will look like a nice uh he would look nice with a crown on his head and so forth but Samuel got his Cru of boil and went down he says and there was a scrubby looking fellow out yonder he's kind of a of a of a fellow that stays to himself out there on the back side of the desert God would put a crown on something like that what what is that a type of the little Mission down y [Music] Hallelujah Miss how's God going to Crown that oh I'm quoting says look that little Mission Down Yonder you know said he wouldn't put a crown on nothing like that glory to God he said I'd imagine they sng some him so they went and got little old David and brought him in a Ry looking fellow hallelujah amen amen dried up looking fellow they brought him in as soon as they brought him in I can imagine Jesse saying that won't work all the rest of them saying that won't work p it amen oh brother we might have been in Jesse's house at one time but God anointed us to bring us out of his house you know why because in that house of Jessie he had all seven spirits of all the church amen all seven brothers [Music] amen he had he had the evil of Ephesus in his house he had the evil of samura in his house he had bitterness you understand seven sons of Church all of the end of all the ages Brother David couldn't live in that house he had to have a Prophet come down God Amen I believe there a bride on the earth in this hour amen amen that's been called out of Jesse's house being anointed by the message of Amen what you know what anoints US let me tell you in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother says what Eve turned down amen it's what we receive he says amen he says and that is where the anointing comes from amen where does the anointing come from Brother Where are we getting anointed from from yes sir from this Prophet yes this Prophet is the one who anoints us amen amen he's anointing us with that horn he's pouring that horn of oil upon us hallelujah amen Oh Glory to God Amen yes sir brother is that right he said that little Mission Down Yonder now listen said the Holy Ghost spoke to the prophet said I've chosen him for man lookth on the outward appearance but God lookth on the heart no matter if you're in a cathedral that don't have nothing to do with it if you've got a mission listen or a prayer meeting in your house God looks to thee on his hearten that might be oldfashioned of FR but it'll sure stick to your ribs it's good with you certainly will God looking to the heart not on the outward appearance hallelujah amen he says as soon as David came forth little little Rudy looking fellow perhaps with with the with the Sheep coat wrapped around him Samuel run and poured oil on him said this is the king that's God's ch am man looks on the outside but God looks on the heart this is the message Abraham he says sometimes you get a great big church with a lot of crosses and statues around and plus sheets and $10,000 organ in it that don't attract God sometimes there's more salvation in a little Mission down on the [Applause] cor he D with the little Mission Hallelujah he said there's sometime there's more salvation Mission down in the corner that you can poke into the place amen that's right man looks on the outside God looks at the heart always remember that Hallelujah brother God didn't go to to anoint uh David because he was good glory because he was better no sir because he was predestined by forign knowledge of God Amen Hallelujah he was pre to meet the challenge of he was the only one that can meet the challenge let me say this in this hour the only one that can beet the challenge of this age is the bride there no to meet the challenge only the king and the priest who else could me Saul his army no brother but the one who was anointed the one that could say I'll cut your head off this amen hallelujah the one that could sa here it is he was anointed anointed by what he says accepting what Eve turned down what are we anointed by accepting what Eve turned down what did Eve turned out to be pregnated with the word spoke the word of God Amen that's how she turned down right she took Satan's reasoning and Satan's idea and was pregnated by that but what she turned down is what comes back to us us thank you we're anointed by a spoken word hallelujah amen oh my you want anointing get into this message you want anointing listen to that word that's where the anointing comes from that's what anointed David amen amen you see it's a perfect type because Saul's at Tope of the Pentecostals and dying out Samuel the Tope of the prophet and this David a type of the Bride as as we're bringing it out here there's we can type it different ways but this how we're typing it this time and then after that after David comes Solomon the top of the Millennium amen yes yes see so there was Son of God Church ages sa Son of God then son of man Prophet Eagle yeah yes amen and then Solomon the son of David in the Millennium in between in between there's something happening amen hallelujah there's something happening in Revelations 10 1 to7 amen and then after seven is 8 to 11 Glory Hallelujah the same angel that spoke with me the first time spake again and said John go to the the angel amen that has the book in his hand take the book eat the book amen prophesy prophesy again yes brother that's what we have to do we have to prophesy to our enemy prophesy to your enemy amen we've got to war this good Warfare with the prophecies concerning you that's why many many people can't have Victory yes you know why cuz they don't know where they're standing when they face the enemy and they can be pushed around any old way but brother when you know the prophecies concerning you when you know that God has promised you the word amen then you're standing upon that your faith is in what he made you in Christ and the message perfect faith brother said Jesus had faith in what the word said about him amen amen yeah Amen brother we we don't have to listen to what somebody else thinks about us we can listen to what the word thinks man's opinion somebody else's idea about you is different than God's yes sir that's right Hallelujah God thinks of you you're perfect you're holy you're my child you're an overcomer man tell you all kinds of things amen amen but we're closing our ear to that right and we're opening our heart to the word and yes it corrects us and yes it tells us where we're wrong yes it does but it also gives us what we need that fuel that fire to go onen I believe God is here to do that for each and every one of us hallelujah to anoint you for your position amen am you're already predestinated for it he has already made you King and priest but it's got to manifest brother you see David was already a king even after Sam uh Samuel anointed him he was King amen as far as God was concerned amen was King as far as Samuel was concerned David was King but it had to come to manifestation is that right right and and for that there's an enemy that's standing in the way between your anointing and your place amen amen between your anointing and your position yes before you been anointed and you come into the throne there's an enemy in between you amen amen but that enemy

to him Revelation struck him hallelujah amen the god that took me out of the paws of the bear took me out of the paws of the lion how much more would he deliver this uncircumcised Philistine into my hand his brothers were more able to do it Saul Head and Shoulders above his army but you see it wasn't revealed to them here there it is they believed it could be done but they believed that God could do it but it wasn't revealed to them but it was revealed to David there's a difference if it's absolutely revealed to you that God is going to heal you you're going to get it you're going to get it I don't care what's wrong with you what the odds is it may be worse than David and Goliath if it's revealed to you you will have it when it's revealed David become Fearless he said today I'll cut your head off amen quickly Our God by Grace in The crucial moment when decision had to be made that same God produced that the grace in that day dropped that seat of faith and the little Hunchback looking
