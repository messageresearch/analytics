[4:37] morning and look at verse 15 and verse
[4:40] 16 again with

[4:46] that you walk
[4:48] circumspectly not as fools but as
[4:54] wise and I would like this morning by
[4:57] the help of
[4:58] God take our message from verse
[5:02] 16 Redeeming the time because the days
[5:07] are
[5:10] evil let's just bow our heads this
[5:13] morning Our Father Again Lord a great
[5:17] privilege to be able to stand this
[5:19] morning in your divine
[5:22] presence and Lord to be able to speak
[5:25] the wonderful words of
[5:28] life now father as we have opened the
[5:30] word of
[5:32] God and we have read from its
[5:35] Pages we pray that the great author that
[5:38] wrote the
[5:39] word come now and speak it to our
[5:43] hearts may you speak to every individual
[5:46] this
[5:47] morning may we walk out of this
[5:50] place closer to our lord
[5:53] Jesus we give you the pre now in the
[5:56] remaining of this
[5:58] service in the name of the Lord Jesus
[6:02] Christ and the church
[6:04] says amen God bless you you
[6:09] seated if I was going to put a title on
[6:13] this this
[6:14] morning I would like to call it
[6:18] Redeeming the
[6:19] time now this morning I'm going to try
[6:22] my
[6:23] best to slow
[6:27] down so our brother can keep up with
[6:31] me he did a wonderful job last
[6:34] night but I felt like I ran off too
[6:37] much so you bear with me this
[6:40] morning but I want to say this on the
[6:43] onset of our
[6:45] message each one of us were born into
[6:48] this
[6:49] world we were not born with eternal
[6:53] life the prophet of God said that when
[6:57] Adam fell in the Garden of Eden
[7:00] brother Adam told us in the message
[7:02] called the
[7:03] breach that Adam fell from eternal
[7:08] life and when he fell from eternal life
[7:12] we understand that the property God
[7:13] taught us in marriage and
[7:16] divorce that the chasm was
[7:19] broken and that they came out of
[7:21] Eternity and stepped down into
[7:24] time one time brother bradam draw a
[7:26] circle like
[7:28] this at the bottom of the circle he put
[7:30] a little little spot here like
[7:33] this and he said the circle was
[7:37] eternity and this little drop here was
[7:39] what we call
[7:41] time he said this little time element
[7:44] here that happened because of the
[7:47] fall but one day time will blend again
[7:51] with
[7:53] eternity and this will go up and fit
[7:56] into the
[7:58] circle not be time as we know this
[8:02] morning but it will be
[8:04] eternity now brother bam says that we
[8:07] are all time
[8:10] creatures when we were born in this
[8:13] world we were born as time
[8:16] creatures not Eternal
[8:19] creatures our life is set by
[8:22] time each one of us have a certain date
[8:25] that we came into this
[8:27] world and God has alloted a time that
[8:30] we'll leave this
[8:32] world the scripture teaches us it's
[8:35] appointed of the de once to
[8:38] die then after this the judgment and if
[8:41] God
[8:42] should that each one of us will have to
[8:45] go by way of the
[8:47] grave and on our
[8:49] Tombstone they'll place a date that we
[8:53] came in the world they'll place a date
[8:56] that we leave the
[8:57] world and what those days
[8:59] are is our experience with
[9:02] time now many times people
[9:06] believe that we are time
[9:08] creatures trying to experience
[9:11] eternity but really we're not we are
[9:15] Eternal creatures who have experienced
[9:18] time because when time is over we'll go
[9:22] back in the
[9:23] eternity where we came from before the
[9:27] foundation of world
[9:29] now as I said our life is set by
[9:34] time a time we begin a time we end then
[9:39] in between those two
[9:41] days there's a little
[9:43] Dash and that little Dash is our life
[9:48] it's how we live it's how we conducted
[9:51] ourselves but most people only remember
[9:54] when we
[9:55] began and when we end because our life
[9:59] is marked by
[10:01] time everything that we do is by time we
[10:06] work by
[10:07] time we come today and we got here by a
[10:10] certain
[10:11] time I'll Preach Today by
[10:14] time we sleep by time we go to bed by
[10:19] time we wake up by time it's simply
[10:24] because that we are ti
[10:26] creatures but sometimes in time we come
[10:31] into a place like this we tried to
[10:34] forget about
[10:35] time and enter into what is
[10:39] eternal because really what matters to
[10:42] us it's not time and it's what is
[10:45] eternal right and the Most Blessed thing
[10:48] that God gave
[10:49] us is what is eternal now with land me
[10:55] he crossed that castle he went from me
[10:59] Eternal over the
[11:00] time Satan stole eternal
[11:04] life the Propet said we fail from it and
[11:08] we went into time and now that we're in
[11:12] time Satan wants to keep us away from
[11:15] what is
[11:16] eternal my brother I'm so glad this
[11:19] morning that we serve a God that by his
[11:24] grace come down in the time Hallelujah
[11:27] became a Time creature thank you Lord
[11:30] our
[11:31] sin defeated our
[11:34] enemies conquered death H the
[11:37] grave send it back to the father and S
[11:41] the Holy
[11:48] Ghost now when I think about time for a
[11:51] minute the Holy Spirit Dr the scriptures
[11:56] and let me just lay this out and say
[11:58] there the scriptures definitely speak to
[12:01] us of a concept of
[12:05] time it seems that God has prescribed
[12:09] time in the
[12:11] scriptures he has
[12:14] determined by his
[12:16] sovereignty a certain definite
[12:20] time in other words God would deal with
[12:24] Israel for a certain
[12:25] time he would turn from Israel and deal
[12:28] with the
[12:30] Gentiles and then he would deal with
[12:32] Gentiles for a certain
[12:35] time God brother said God aots
[12:40] time time is controlled by a sovereign
[12:44] God one day time as we know it will
[12:48] cease I want to watch closer this
[12:51] morning time as we know it will
[12:53] ceas so we only have an aoic time on
[12:57] this Earth
[13:00] because what is eternal we fell
[13:02] from now what we're trying to do while
[13:05] we're in
[13:06] time it's get back to what is
[13:09] eternal can you say Amen now I want you
[13:13] to watch as I preference verse 16 this
[13:18] morning where Paul tells us to redeem
[13:23] time that's a strange statement to me
[13:27] for a man to tell me to redeem
[13:30] time if I understand the word redeem as
[13:33] brother describ
[13:36] it means to buy
[13:38] back how can I buy that
[13:41] time something that was stole from me or
[13:44] from
[13:45] me how can I redeem it back let me
[13:49] preference that minute morning with
[13:52] verse 15 of Ephesians
[13:55] 5 where Paul tells us to walk
[14:01] circumspectly and then he says not as
[14:05] fools but as wise so Paul tells us
[14:10] number one that we are to walk
[14:14] circumspectly now there's a word
[14:17] circum it literally means to walk
[14:21] accurately to walk
[14:23] diligently to walk
[14:26] precisely then he tells us how we can do
[14:28] that
[14:29] he tells us to do that by not walking in
[14:32] this
[14:33] world as
[14:35] fools but as wise and how do we do that
[14:39] by redeeming our
[14:41] time now here's what's amazing for
[14:44] minut in the book of
[14:46] Ephesians Paul uses three
[14:49] words and these three words give a
[14:53] physical
[14:55] position of every believer he starts out
[14:58] the first chapter and tells us that we
[15:02] sit with Christ in Heavenly
[15:04] places the next place he tells us that
[15:08] we are to stand with the
[15:11] gospel then he uses the word that we're
[15:13] to walk in the
[15:15] life so he says one time we're to sit
[15:19] another time we're to stand another time
[15:22] we're to walk here he tells us that we
[15:25] to walk
[15:27] circumspect let me just describe this
[15:30] for when he talks about walking he's
[15:34] talking about something that is
[15:37] Progressive for example when man fell
[15:41] and as brother Adam said he fell from
[15:45] eternity fell from eternal life became a
[15:49] Time creature all of a sudden God comes
[15:52] down out of
[15:54] Heaven brother B said the cool of the
[15:56] evening he came down to man
[15:59] now by the way by the way man never shot
[16:02] for
[16:03] God God shot for
[16:05] man God wasn't never lost we was the
[16:09] ones that was lost and God had to come
[16:12] and find us do you believe that if God
[16:15] didn't find us we would have never been
[16:18] found man left to himself cannot find
[16:22] God God must seek
[16:25] us said man has never sought God
[16:29] God has
[16:31] always what Happ here ad is a fallen
[16:36] condition and the scripture says that
[16:40] Adam
[16:41] heard the voice of the lord god notice
[16:46] what it says
[16:48] walking it says the voice of the Lord's
[16:52] God was
[16:53] walking now look if you're going to
[16:57] identify with the voice voice of God you
[17:00] better be able to walk because that
[17:03] voice is going to unfold the
[17:05] word as the word is
[17:09] unfold said we must walk in the and he
[17:13] said we walk
[17:15] in the word will
[17:18] unfold let me show you
[17:20] this God voice was walking I don't know
[17:24] if youve ever noticed the pillar of
[17:26] fire you notice brother is very clear
[17:30] but the pillar fire is
[17:32] hazy because that pillar fire is
[17:34] constantly
[17:35] moving the picture was caught as the
[17:38] pillar fire is
[17:39] moving if you're going to follow this
[17:42] message you got to be
[17:51] moving the one pipe that brother used
[17:55] from the
[17:57] garden to represent the bride being
[18:00] translated was
[18:02] Enoch Adam heard God's voice walking in
[18:06] the
[18:08] of identified
[18:10] Ed it said he walked with
[18:13] God was not God
[18:17] took walked with
[18:27] God take Noah he was a prophet the Bible
[18:32] said Noah walked with
[18:34] God take Abraham the Bible says walk
[18:39] before me and be th
[18:41] perfect now when our lord Jesus was here
[18:45] he told the
[18:46] disciples while you have the light
[18:49] believe the light walk while you have
[18:52] the
[18:53] light Darkness come upon
[18:56] you when God's word unfold
[18:59] itself the bride has to walk with the
[19:03] word do you understand Lu
[19:07] had but when the light moved on the
[19:10] believer had to go with the light and
[19:13] those that to walk with the life their
[19:16] life
[19:21] became the W message became
[19:25] dark after the open S
[19:29] we don't
[19:30] have we
[19:41] have man
[19:52] here God told us to walk in the
[19:57] light as he is in the life then he say
[20:01] we have Fellowship one with another and
[20:03] the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us
[20:07] from
[20:07] all so
[20:09] walking speaks of the
[20:13] progressive activity of the holy spirit
[20:16] in a man's life he is consistently
[20:20] walking as God unfolds
[20:22] his that beli walks in the life now
[20:26] watch this he says that we are to walk
[20:31] circumspective
[20:33] that word literally
[20:35] means that we walk with
[20:39] accuracy we walk with
[20:43] carefulness we want to make sure that
[20:45] where we're
[20:46] walking is where the light is cuz
[20:50] remember anything outside of this
[20:53] message brother said there's no life in
[20:55] it and if there's no life in it there's
[20:58] no life in it in him was life and the
[21:02] life was the life of men yes sir amen
[21:06] now it tells us what how we can walk in
[21:10] the light how we can walk
[21:14] circumspectly he says not as
[21:17] fools but as
[21:22] wise he tells us in that same chapter
[21:27] verse 8
[21:28] for ye were sometimes
[21:33] Darkness but now you are light in the
[21:38] Lord watch he's not just saying you're
[21:41] walking in he says you are the
[21:45] light
[21:47] says is the manifestation of the spoken
[21:50] word of God now be said be a and you're
[21:55] here that is here you are
[22:02] the which is the life of the that's
[22:09] right you're the but now watch what he
[22:13] say you're the light but then he says
[22:16] walk as children of life you're the but
[22:21] walk as children life if you're the life
[22:25] walk as a child of life
[22:33] do you believe that yes
[22:35] sir I want I want you just see how this
[22:38] goes
[22:39] just he says awake thou the
[22:42] sleepest arise from the dead now he
[22:45] can't be talking about the grave out
[22:48] he's talking about us being dead in our
[22:51] trespasses
[22:52] our I'll just go further our
[22:55] denominational unbelief
[22:58] he said to rise from the dead and Christ
[23:02] shall give the
[23:04] light can you
[23:08] say
[23:12] slumbering foolish Christians we're
[23:15] going to unfold this in a second arise
[23:18] from the
[23:19] dead Christ shall give thee
[23:23] light here's an example of that fools
[23:27] why
[23:29] Jesus had come he died buried raised
[23:34] again walked on the earth for 40
[23:38] days one day he met two men on the road
[23:43] to and the Bible said they were sad they
[23:47] communed among
[23:49] themselves Jesus came up and he begin to
[23:52] ask him what Communications are these
[23:54] and you're
[23:56] sad and he says this what man of
[24:00] communicating with
[24:01] these that you have one with
[24:04] another as ye
[24:07] walk and they're sad do you understand
[24:11] these two men Believe In
[24:13] Christ but missed the interpretation of
[24:15] the scripture the now watch what Jesus
[24:19] Says by telling them they missed
[24:23] it oh yes yes yes
[24:36] the prophet SP sir do you understand
[24:40] these two disciples when they miss the
[24:43] man
[24:48] word not
[24:51] believe in the
[24:53] Prophet come
[24:55] brother matter if you understand
[24:59] you believe
[25:06] what Jesus called them
[25:09] fools and then the Bible said you know
[25:11] the rest of the story he entered into
[25:14] their home and then he opened the
[25:19] word the scriptures he was trying to get
[25:22] them to see the
[25:24] scriptures that was promised for that
[25:26] hour had already been
[25:29] interpreted and then the scripture said
[25:32] he broke the bread their eyes were open
[25:36] and they knew him and then the Bible
[25:39] says he opened their
[25:47] understanding
[25:49] seei word
[25:51] God that's what call walking
[25:55] circumspect now I want to unfold this
[25:58] next
[25:59] verse now a man would have to be a
[26:04] fool to start a journey and not know
[26:07] where he's
[26:08] going told me well Abraham didn't
[26:11] know
[26:13] Abraham met a king one
[26:16] day he met a man
[26:19] in and the only I can tell you is after
[26:24] he met that man and that man Departed
[26:28] the scripture says Abraham look for a
[26:32] city whose Builder and maker is
[26:36] God Abraham had a
[26:39] destination and it was that future home
[26:42] someone said why would Abraham look for
[26:44] a
[26:45] ship because he met the king of the ship
[26:49] when he
[26:51] met and Cath was a king he knew there
[26:55] had to be
[26:56] a had to be a land and Abraham sought
[27:00] for
[27:01] that now let's watch this Paul is simply
[27:05] telling us to walk in wisdom to walk
[27:11] circumspect to not walk as
[27:14] fools but to walk as wise now watch this
[27:18] closely here's how he teaches us to walk
[27:22] in
[27:24] wisdom number one redeeming the
[27:28] time now we we say redeon means to buy
[27:33] back but I want you to watch this
[27:36] morning to buy
[27:38] back something that's been lost we're
[27:42] going to buy it back I say if we lost it
[27:46] we can't buy back I'm going to prove
[27:48] that wrong you remember when man fa God
[27:52] told Adam the day you eat thereof that
[27:57] day you to surely die one day with the
[28:00] Lord is a thousand years with
[28:03] man and every man that ever came into
[28:06] the
[28:07] world he died within a day there was
[28:11] never a man that could live a thousand
[28:13] years on this Earth the oldest man that
[28:16] ever lived
[28:18] wasth he lived 969 years and he
[28:23] died there was no man that ever lived a
[28:25] thousand years because God said the day
[28:29] you eat thereof that day you should Sur
[28:32] die so no man will ever live
[28:35] without but did you notice when the is
[28:39] raptured three half years of
[28:42] tribulation we don't know the future
[28:44] home that Abraham looked
[28:46] for we sto come back to earth and we
[28:50] live 1,000
[28:51] years why do we live 1,000 years because
[28:55] God has given us back
[28:58] the day
[29:05] that upon this Earth and God is going to
[29:09] set in the
[29:11] Millen with Jesus Christ and live 1,000
[29:15] years not
[29:19] eternity said the seven days it's
[29:26] still
[29:38] Hallelujah tells us
[29:41] that that lufer is
[29:44] Bound for Thousand
[29:48] Years now a
[29:50] prophet does not teach us that Lucifer
[29:54] is bound by a long chain but he said a
[29:58] change of
[29:59] circum he said millenni Lucifer don't
[30:03] have anybody to work
[30:05] for everyone that's in that Mill is in a
[30:08] glorified
[30:09] form you understand so he's got nobody
[30:12] to
[30:13] work for 1,00 years Satan's got to
[30:17] twindle
[30:19] his
[30:26] Hallelujah nothing to do and for 1,000
[30:30] years Satan and all of the Devils is
[30:34] going to have to watch us live
[30:52] for you know that he called that a 1,00
[30:57] year
[31:08] Hy we
[31:12] we 10
[31:14] days they were really blessed two
[31:18] weeks Heaven come down with in three
[31:21] weeks but I'm talking
[31:26] a
[31:43] do you believe
[31:45] it now with that thought in mind list
[31:49] proceed to what Paul's
[31:52] talking he tells us that as
[31:56] Believers we we can
[31:59] redeem now we already know God will do
[32:01] it but he says we can do it now my
[32:03] question is brother how can I redeem
[32:07] time now listen this the
[32:11] word they
[32:13] go the word there
[32:16] means to buy up
[32:20] opportunities let me explain it to you
[32:22] the Latin word go look it up literally
[32:26] means towards the
[32:28] port like a ship going towards the port
[32:32] a destination so here's what he says you
[32:36] and I are heading
[32:38] somewhere and we're going to the
[32:41] destination we're trying to get to the
[32:45] port and we need to buy up every
[32:50] opportunity that would bring us closer
[32:52] to our
[32:53] destination now you say brother Luke we
[32:57] somewh
[33:02] believe
[33:05] CH toy every
[33:08] opportunity bring you closer to
[33:12] your here's the thought behind I got I
[33:15] got to lay this in here so you
[33:18] understand the quote I'm about the
[33:20] read the word suggest this to buy time
[33:26] it's a sh
[33:28] that takes
[33:30] advantage of every
[33:32] wind and every
[33:35] tide to safely to
[33:38] the let me
[33:40] expl if the time is coming out and the
[33:43] ship tries to get in he's wasting time
[33:48] because he has to fight the current the
[33:51] curent is pushing him out so he's
[33:53] wasting time but if that current flow
[33:58] out then as it flows back in he gets us
[34:02] that
[34:03] opportunity
[34:06] rise
[34:09] back that's called redeeming
[34:12] time buying up
[34:15] opportun brother let me say this every
[34:18] time the Holy Ghost comes into a
[34:25] me
[34:31] that's good brother that's
[34:38] good your OPP
[34:46] toall
[34:48] the the Holy Ghost you got to get in the
[34:52] Holy
[34:53] Ghost time redeem your offer J
[35:09] theot or
[35:11] the uses his
[35:14] skill to make sure that when that
[35:17] current goes
[35:19] out and as it goes back in it sets his
[35:24] saes and he sets his SA
[35:27] so he can use the wind and the current
[35:31] to bring him into
[35:33] his I see so many people day fighting
[35:38] God right when you stay at home on
[35:41] Sunday

[39:21] P

[40:08] they're not redeeming their
[40:11] time the preachers got to spend 30
[40:15] minutes trying to get over
[40:17] people's waste of time their minds are
[40:21] somewhere in the world their minds are
[40:23] thinking about what they got to do

[40:54] Need A Touch yes
[40:59] Lord shut yourself let the Holy
[41:16] Spirit you have to redeem
[41:19] time it's because you have to do it in
[41:23] the
[41:24] light that this opportunity could soon
[41:27] be
[41:29] gone listen when that s out in the
[41:32] ship and that way it comes and then it
[41:36] goes back if he hadn't redeemed his time
[41:40] and he don't know when that opportunity
[41:42] is going to come again that's why I
[41:45] don't understand about people every
[41:47] church service you can never get this
[41:50] back this Sunday morning will never
[41:52] return again you got to get everything
[41:55] you can out of this service
[41:58] we are to get to the place that we save
[42:00] the Lord I'm not even going home till I
[42:03] get what I
[42:05] need that's right brother you remember
[42:07] the man said went out there he wanted
[42:10] the Holy Ghost and the prophet said he
[42:12] went out there in the woods and he found
[42:14] the log and he got down and he said Lord
[42:18] you'll either give me the holy ghost or
[42:20] they'll find a pack of
[42:22] bones that man was going to redeem the
[42:24] time this was his
[42:27] God can't pass man that kind
[42:30] ofh that's right brother yes sir amen it
[42:34] just seems that people are not hungry
[42:36] for the way that's right that's true
[42:39] that's so true
[42:41] listen as it passes or what we say time
[42:45] by the
[42:46] clock you know brother R talked about
[42:48] time should be no more and in the breach
[42:52] brother says denomination ages have run
[42:55] out 2:00 3:00 4:00 5:00 the time that
[43:00] God deals with Gentiles
[43:02] about it's only going to be so long god
[43:06] Set 2,000 years seven Church ages that
[43:10] he would deal with Gentiles when that
[43:12] door
[43:13] shut it wouldn't matter how much a man
[43:16] be
[43:16] on if God ever shuts the
[43:19] door it's over my opportunity has passed
[43:24] can never be brought back
[43:27] that's right brother I believe
[43:30] predestination they won't be one that
[43:33] door what God has redeemed
[43:37] everyone but there's going to be people
[43:39] like es that's going to seek it that's
[43:42] going to want it and they let the
[43:45] opportunity to receive it passing by and
[43:48] never be able to redeem it back that's
[43:50] why Paul said redeem it
[43:52] now listen to this do you know
[43:56] there is no one ever saved
[43:59] tomorrow did you know no one your loved
[44:02] ones will never be saved
[44:05] tomorrow if you got a lost husband here
[44:07] this
[44:08] morning tomorrow he'll never be
[44:13] saved try if he ever gets saved it'll be
[44:17] today you said what if he comes
[44:20] tomorrow it'll be
[44:23] today today the salvation not tomorrow
[44:28] so if you had church tomorrow and
[44:30] someone come and got saved they been

[49:05] not the Assembly of yourselves together
[49:09] as the man of some
[49:15] is it got to the
[49:18] place that some people didn't believe
[49:20] they needed the local church
[49:23] anymore and Paul said you're not to do
[49:26] what some are already
[49:28] doing watch what he says but so much the
[49:34] more as you see the day

[49:44] you're enjoying something right
[49:47] now that is an opportunity that's going
[49:50] to pass you by one of these
[49:52] days Based On th sayth the Lord
[49:56] the prophet of God said one of these
[49:58] days I got it right here one of these
[50:02] days pretty soon they're going to tap a
[50:05] sign on our door out

[50:15] come to
[50:15] squees I personally don't believe
[50:17] there's coming
[50:19] one I believe we begin to feel the
[50:23] effect start to feel that pressure
[50:26] down Revelation 13 but I don't know how
[50:29] else to say Redeeming the time because
[50:33] the days are
[50:35] evil what he talking about the day the
[50:38] day when they bring that persecu you

[50:57] day ride down to the local church walk

[51:07] they're going to yearn for that that
[51:09] opportunity is going to
[51:13] pass
