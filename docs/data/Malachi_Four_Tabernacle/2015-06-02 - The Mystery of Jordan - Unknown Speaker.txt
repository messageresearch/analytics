Description:
05/31/15 The Jordan River can be typed with many things, but in this sermon it is typed as death and/or your flesh.  This flesh is our true enemy and it's really what's holding us back.  It's takes a complete dying out for us to cross from this flesh to a glorified state.  You must be born again, not good again.
