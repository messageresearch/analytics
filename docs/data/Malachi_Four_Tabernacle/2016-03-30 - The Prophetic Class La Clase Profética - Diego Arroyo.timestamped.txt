[1:04:39] shalt speak my words unto them whether
[1:04:41] they will hear or whether they will will
[1:04:45] forbear for they are most
[1:04:53] rebellious
[1:04:55] but thou son of man hear what I say unto
[1:04:57] thee be not thou rebellious like that
[1:05:00] rebellious house open thy mouth and eat
[1:05:04] that I give
[1:05:15] thee and when I looked behold in hand
[1:05:18] was said unto me and lo a row of a book
[1:05:21] was
[1:05:23] therein
[1:05:27] and he spread it before me and it was
[1:05:30] written within and without there was
[1:05:33] written therein Lamentations and
[1:05:35] mourning and
[1:05:46] wo hu Allelujah moreover he said unto me
[1:05:49] son of man eat thou that thou findest

[1:06:22] thee then did I eat it
[1:06:24] and it was in my mouth as honey for
[1:06:36] sweetness and he said unto me son of man
[1:06:40] go get thee unto the house of Israel and
[1:06:43] speak with my words unto
[1:06:50] them for thou art not sent to a people
[1:06:53] of a strange speech or of in hard
[1:06:56] language but to the house of
[1:07:05] Israel amen amen it's a prophecy to the
[1:07:09] church that's in the condition of
[1:07:13] Leia hallelujah hallelujah this is to
[1:07:16] those that are called
[1:07:18] out this is to
[1:07:20] Israel this is to the church amen amen
[1:07:24] and here
[1:07:26] Ezekiel amen is in this
[1:07:30] time and he has been called by
[1:07:33] God he has been called by the
[1:07:36] angel he has been called Amen to to take
[1:07:41] this
[1:07:42] word hallelujah and to
[1:07:45] prophesy amen and we want to
[1:07:48] speak on this
[1:07:52] subject the prophetic
[1:07:55] class amen amen the prophetic
[1:08:00] class and we find in
[1:08:04] 10 Revelation chapter
[1:08:07] 10 we know is the seventh
[1:08:11] seal and in this seventh
[1:08:14] seal we find that it's the coming of
[1:08:18] Christ hallelujah hallelujah and then he
[1:08:21] reveals
[1:08:22] himself through his seventh
[1:08:25] angel to the public he's revealing the
[1:08:29] son of
[1:08:30] man the seventh angel is not the son of
[1:08:34] man but he's revealing to the
[1:08:37] public the son of man that's the seventh
[1:08:41] seal then we see how that the
[1:08:45] Mysteries were going to be made
[1:08:47] known it was God
[1:08:50] himself unfolding and revealing
[1:08:54] his own
[1:08:55] mind to us through this message it's the
[1:09:00] coming of Christ is Christ being
[1:09:03] revealed from Heaven hallelujah
[1:09:06] hallelujah Christ has already come down
[1:09:10] to reveal
[1:09:11] himself and the Lord
[1:09:13] himself has descended with a shout
[1:09:17] that's a
[1:09:18] message hallelujah hallelujah and he had
[1:09:21] to do it according to
[1:09:25] 37 according to Malachi
[1:09:27] 4 according to Matthew
[1:09:31] 1711 according to Malachi 4 according to
[1:09:35] Revelations
[1:09:36] 10:7 he had to bring it through a
[1:09:40] prophet hallelujah hallelujah he had to
[1:09:42] bring a
[1:09:43] message to call out the
[1:09:46] bride and unite the bride in Heavenly
[1:09:51] places and prepare her
[1:09:54] for rapturing Faith Amen to call her
[1:09:58] unto a rapturing faith that's why the
[1:10:02] the messenger of Revelations 10 was
[1:10:06] going to do two things he was going to
[1:10:09] restore the hearts of the children to
[1:10:13] the faith of the fathers and he was
[1:10:15] going to
[1:10:16] reveal the
[1:10:18] mysteries of the seven
[1:10:21] Thunders which are the divine
[1:10:25] revealed mystery truths contained in the
[1:10:30] Seven Seals and it would be these
[1:10:33] divinely revealed mystery
[1:10:38] truths that were going to
[1:10:40] turn
[1:10:41] literally the hearts of the
[1:10:44] children back to the faith of the
[1:10:46] fathers so brother bam says in the
[1:10:51] breach between the ages and the seal
[1:10:54] it says what are these
[1:10:56] Thunders they're
[1:10:59] Revelations hallelujah what are these
[1:11:02] Thunders
[1:11:06] Revelations but those
[1:11:08] Revelations are
[1:11:10] contained within the opening of the
[1:11:14] book because the Seven
[1:11:16] Seals opens the book the book was sealed
[1:11:21] the Bible was sealed
[1:11:24] with Seven Seals but when when when
[1:11:28] Christ come down from heaven clothed in
[1:11:32] a cloud the book was already open
[1:11:36] hallelujah hallelujah and he gave this
[1:11:39] book to the seventh angel to reveal it
[1:11:43] to his people and the seventh angel
[1:11:47] begin to preach the mystery of
[1:11:52] God
[1:11:54] hallelujah
[1:11:56] hallelujah that the
[1:11:58] mystery would be
[1:12:02] finished brother Adam said when the
[1:12:04] seventh
[1:12:05] angel begins to
[1:12:08] sound not the years in
[1:12:13] preparation there was years of
[1:12:16] preparation like John the Baptist he was
[1:12:19] preparing the
[1:12:22] way but brother he said in the Rapture
[1:12:26] message he says I knew that all those
[1:12:30] years back there in the healing
[1:12:34] campaigns in in in those great
[1:12:37] meetings he says I knew that wasn't my
[1:12:42] Ministry that wasn't it there was coming
[1:12:45] a
[1:12:47] message in the message
[1:12:50] influence I believe he preached the one
[1:12:53] in in Bakersfield bersi or streetport
[1:12:56] Louisiana or streetport Louisiana but
[1:12:58] one of those
[1:13:00] influenceu at the end of the message
[1:13:03] brother Bram is trying to get the
[1:13:06] church which Mo no most of them were
[1:13:10] Pentecostal he was trying to get the
[1:13:13] church amen to to
[1:13:17] respond to the word of
[1:13:19] God and and they weren't responding to
[1:13:23] the
[1:13:24] call and brother Bram

[1:13:36] discern you come from such and such a
[1:13:39] place your name is such and
[1:13:43] such amen and he said and and and this
[1:13:47] and this and the people begin to
[1:13:50] respond brother bam stopped
[1:13:54] he said that's where Satan has deceived
[1:13:58] you that's strong brother but he said
[1:14:01] that's where Satan has
[1:14:03] deceived in other words they were only
[1:14:08] responding to the
[1:14:10] sign but they weren't
[1:14:12] responding to The
[1:14:15] Voice Hallelujah the sign was to get
[1:14:18] your
[1:14:19] attention to listen to The Voice
[1:14:24] Hallelujah huj and still today in this
[1:14:28] message people are only
[1:14:31] attracted to the sign I believe the sign
[1:14:36] but there was a group of people called
[1:14:39] believe the
[1:14:40] sign that believed the sh and they never
[1:14:44] believed the
[1:14:45] voice and now they're
[1:14:48] blasphemers that will burn eternally in
[1:14:51] hell for blaspheming the Holy
[1:14:55] Ghost

[1:15:03] of
[1:15:04] God we got to see it

[1:17:38] angels GL to
[1:17:40] God when the when the public service
[1:17:48] come that was a sign it's time to go
[1:17:53] hallelujah hallelujah brother and sister
[1:17:56] he was born for that purpose to come
[1:18:00] into the
[1:18:01] office of a
[1:18:04] prophet he wasn't born to be an
[1:18:08] evangelist he was born a
[1:18:11] prophet hallelujah hallelujah and his
[1:18:14] office was to be a prophet but in
[1:18:20] 1962 Tak con sides with he says I say
[1:18:24] many many
[1:18:26] times that I am not a prophet he says I
[1:18:29] say that not only to be
[1:18:32] humble but because I am not in the
[1:18:35] office of a
[1:18:38] prophet I believe what he said and I
[1:18:41] believe that he knew if he was in the
[1:18:44] office or not and in
[1:18:47] 1962 he says I am not in the office of a
[1:18:51] prophet
[1:18:53] amen amen but brother and sister he said
[1:18:57] the Lord told me do the work of an
[1:19:00] evangelist he said he never told me I
[1:19:02] was an
[1:19:04] evangelist but he told me to do the work
[1:19:07] of an evangelist you know that that
[1:19:10] scripture is in Timothy and that's the
[1:19:13] scripture that brother Bram put in the
[1:19:17] Cornerstone of the Bram
[1:19:21] Tabernacle amen amen you've seen the
[1:19:24] pictures brother Ram grabbing amen the
[1:19:28] quarterstone and he's he's going to
[1:19:30] place it there there's another picture
[1:19:33] where he's
[1:19:34] standing on the corner
[1:19:37] Stone amen glory to God Amen but you
[1:19:42] know that scripture was given by Paul to
[1:19:47] Timothy which was a pastor not an
[1:19:50] evangelist and he told him to do the
[1:19:52] work of an
[1:19:53] Evangel brother Bram wasn't a wasn't to
[1:19:57] be in the office of a of a
[1:20:00] pastor or the office of an
[1:20:02] evangelist he was born a prophet a major
[1:20:07] prophet a word Prophet amen amen to
[1:20:12] bring the message of
[1:20:14] God to bring the mystery of
[1:20:17] God Amen so he was to do the
[1:20:20] work of an evangelist
[1:20:23] until he come into the office of a
[1:20:26] prophet and when he went West hallelujah
[1:20:29] hallelujah in the first month that he
[1:20:32] went West a sword fell in his
[1:20:36] hand Hallelujah that was in
[1:20:39] January of
[1:20:41] 63 and then he begin to
[1:20:44] preach amen the
[1:20:48] way of a true Prophet amen amen he begin
[1:20:53] to preach about Amos and how what
[1:20:58] prophet amen how he was and how if
[1:21:03] Amos would come today to this day what
[1:21:08] would he say hallelujah oh
[1:21:12] my brother we know the
[1:21:14] story in February
[1:21:17] 28 glory to God he was caught up to meet
[1:21:22] Christ
[1:21:24] himself and seven
[1:21:26] angels amen amen and to bring the
[1:21:29] mystery of
[1:21:31] God and that is
[1:21:34] why we are here
[1:21:36] today that's why we have eyes to
[1:21:41] see amen amen that's why we we we are
[1:21:47] the
[1:21:48] fruits of this
[1:21:50] message got to produce
[1:21:53] a prophetic
[1:21:55] class that is going
[1:21:58] beyond the Realms of the
[1:22:01] ecclesiastical
[1:22:03] understanding amen amen that is going
[1:22:06] far beyond traditional way of
[1:22:10] thinking amen amen oh this is what the
[1:22:14] Bible
[1:22:15] means get next to
[1:22:17] yourself amen amen this is the mystery
[1:22:21] of God is Christ revealed in his own
[1:22:26] word Christ is the mystery of God
[1:22:33] revealed Christ is re revealed in his
[1:22:36] own word and we find in Revelations
[1:22:39] 10 that when he sounds the
[1:22:43] trumpet when he sounded the
[1:22:46] trumpet that's when his message
[1:22:49] began all the things that were in
[1:22:51] preparation
[1:22:54] goes with the
[1:22:55] message I believe the message from from
[1:22:58] from
[1:23:01] 1909 to
[1:23:05] 1965 amen amen because I believe that
[1:23:09] the sign in the
[1:23:11] heavens was announcing
[1:23:14] it hallelujah amen
[1:23:19] hallelujah and the angel spoke to him at
[1:23:23] six years
[1:23:25] old is that right Hallelujah and that's
[1:23:29] part of the
[1:23:32] message amen amen so
[1:23:35] notice that the years in
[1:23:39] preparation it it is it is part of it
[1:23:43] amen but according I'm not interpreting
[1:23:47] it in the message trying to do God a
[1:23:50] service without being his will
[1:23:53] brother bham said the seventh angel
[1:23:55] begins to sound the
[1:23:58] trumpet not the years in
[1:24:02] preparation he said but when the opening
[1:24:05] of The Seven
[1:24:08] Seals amen amen so when we see
[1:24:12] Revelations
[1:24:13] 10:7 then we read in verse
[1:24:17] 8
[1:24:19] 108 remember this is the seven seal
[1:24:23] and the voice which I heard from Heaven
[1:24:25] spake unto me again and said go and take
[1:24:28] the little book which is open in the
[1:24:29] hand of the Angel which standeth upon
[1:24:31] the sea and upon the
[1:24:40] Earth and I went unto the angel and said
[1:24:43] unto him give me the little book and he
[1:24:46] said unto me take it and eat it up and
[1:24:49] it will and it shall make thy belly
[1:24:51] bitter but but it shall be in thy mouth
[1:24:53] sweet as
[1:25:02] honey and I took the little book out of
[1:25:05] the Angel's hand and ate it up and it
[1:25:07] was in my mouth sweet as honey and as
[1:25:09] soon as I had eaten it it my belly was
[1:25:18] bitter and he said unto me thou must
[1:25:21] prophesy again before many peoples and
[1:25:24] Nations and tongues and
[1:25:35] Kings amen this is John Amen in
[1:25:39] Revelation chapter 4
[1:25:42] message brother Bram said that John in
[1:25:46] the
[1:25:47] vision though being one
[1:25:49] man he was representing
[1:25:53] the entire Church of Jesus
[1:25:56] Christ is that right he was representing
[1:25:58] the
[1:26:00] bride and we understand that in
[1:26:02] Revelations chapter
[1:26:04] 4 he was told come up hither brother
[1:26:09] Bram says that's when the
[1:26:11] bride will be called by the trumpet come
[1:26:16] up hither amen so John is the type of
[1:26:19] the
[1:26:20] Bride John heard
[1:26:22] the seven Thunders
[1:26:24] Roar hallelujah hallelujah brother bam
[1:26:27] said Daniel heard the
[1:26:31] Thunders amen is that right so when we
[1:26:35] look at
[1:26:36] this we understand that in this
[1:26:40] scene brother Adam said it shows
[1:26:43] us the
[1:26:46] mystery of the catching away of the
[1:26:49] Bride because he said the seventh
[1:26:53] seal is the
[1:26:55] mystery of the
[1:26:57] going of the Bride now he says that in
[1:27:00] Feast of the
[1:27:01] trumpets now listen to this when we
[1:27:05] begin to look at the seven seal
[1:27:07] brother amen am we begin to
[1:27:10] understand amen by the grace of God the
[1:27:14] seven seal was
[1:27:16] open amen amen amen that's a great thing
[1:27:21] the seven SE is
[1:27:24] open everybody say the seven seal is
[1:27:30] open amen amen hallelujah you see
[1:27:33] because
[1:27:35] today is a day where they where a lot of
[1:27:39] people say it's
[1:27:42] closed wow see and it's not
[1:27:45] open brother and sister when when we
[1:27:48] realize that the prophet of God amen
[1:27:52] begins to tell us what the seventh seal
[1:27:56] is then we know we got to understand
[1:28:00] that it is open hallelujah hallelujah
[1:28:03] but it's only for the bread of
[1:28:06] Christ Revelation chapter
[1:28:08] 10 is the seventh
[1:28:13] seal that's according to the prophet of
[1:28:16] God now when we see then that under the
[1:28:20] Seven Seals
[1:28:22] it was the coming of Christ himself in a
[1:28:27] spiritual
[1:28:28] form in an Angelic
[1:28:30] form Hallelujah in a form that he come
[1:28:35] to bring the
[1:28:37] Mysteries to reveal them but then he
[1:28:40] veils
[1:28:41] himself in the seventh
[1:28:43] angel and the seventh angel is the
[1:28:47] mouth is the trumpet that is sounding
[1:28:52] Hallelujah to speak to
[1:28:55] utter amen those
[1:28:58] voices amen why why had
[1:29:03] he brought the prophet to that
[1:29:07] place Amen in order for him to speak
[1:29:11] those
[1:29:13] things only until he come to that
[1:29:18] place he was able to speak those
[1:29:20] things
[1:29:23] amen hallelujah hello
[1:29:26] somebody all of his life he was in
[1:29:31] preparation God was leading him but when
[1:29:34] he comes to full
[1:29:37] adoption when he comes to
[1:29:39] maturity when he comes to the top of the
[1:29:42] pyramid brother Bram said the
[1:29:46] Capstone is seven
[1:29:50] Thunders
[1:29:52] but you see it's got to be
[1:29:55] connected with the
[1:29:57] individual because the pyramid it's not
[1:30:00] only
[1:30:02] dispensations but it's a man rising up
[1:30:06] an
[1:30:07] individual a a Seed of
[1:30:10] Abraham rising up hallelujah hallelujah
[1:30:14] unto the statue of
[1:30:16] Christ and when that comes to to the
[1:30:19] Capstone brother says it's
[1:30:24] Thunders so the prophet had to come to
[1:30:27] that
[1:30:28] spot to that place to
[1:30:32] utter these
[1:30:34] things see he
[1:30:38] entered into the
[1:30:40] office of a
[1:30:42] prophet hallu oh my you
[1:30:48] understand because he told us that in in
[1:30:50] 62
[1:30:52] taking s with Jesus 63 he comes into the
[1:30:57] office amen he reveals these these
[1:31:01] Mysteries and from there out he
[1:31:05] continues to reveal them these
[1:31:09] Revelations hallelujah hallelujah these
[1:31:12] Thunders what are Thunders
[1:31:16] Revelations he begins to he's he begins
[1:31:19] to bring out the m my that was under the
[1:31:23] fifth
[1:31:24] seal
[1:31:26] theophanies he begins to bring that
[1:31:28] mystery out who is this
[1:31:31] milc word
[1:31:33] bodies he begins to bring out these
[1:31:35] things Souls under the altar he begins
[1:31:39] to
[1:31:40] bring amen the world is falling
[1:31:44] apart he begins to bring out mystery
[1:31:47] under the Sixth
[1:31:48] Seal vials trumpets amen amen
[1:31:54] tribulation these these demons that are
[1:31:57] going to torment and hot
[1:32:00] women you understand he begins to
[1:32:04] unfold what was in those
[1:32:07] seals see and people just think it was
[1:32:10] just just that week of the
[1:32:13] seals no brother it's
[1:32:17] Revelations that are coming out so so
[1:32:21] when we see this
[1:32:23] if the bride in this hour must be a
[1:32:26] prophetic class of
[1:32:28] people she is being led by
[1:32:31] God under the
[1:32:34] headship of Christ the original
[1:32:38] headship which is under her
[1:32:41] message and through that she is being
[1:32:45] led amen Amen to that same
[1:32:49] spot amen amen to that same
[1:32:53] maturity to that same
[1:32:56] fullness of the stature of Christ she is
[1:32:59] raising up she's coming up Hallelujah to
[1:33:03] come into her
[1:33:06] position Hallelujah to come into the
[1:33:09] knowledge of him into the
[1:33:13] revelation of him hallelujah hallelujah
[1:33:16] remember when Paul in Hebrews chapter 5
[1:33:21] wanted to speak to the
[1:33:23] church uh about
[1:33:26] MDC he said uh I have a lot of
[1:33:29] things to speak to you about
[1:33:33] MDC but you cannot receive it all
[1:33:36] now because you still have need of
[1:33:40] milk and you should be teachers
[1:33:42] already amen amen and you should be
[1:33:46] teachers and you still need to be
[1:33:49] taught so that shows us something
[1:33:52] that shows us that the
[1:33:55] Mysteries that were in these
[1:33:58] Thunders do you understand amen cannot
[1:34:01] be given to somebody that's a babe from
[1:34:06] God to him through the
[1:34:09] messenger of that age so Paul could not
[1:34:13] give it to the
[1:34:14] church because yet they were
[1:34:17] babes amen so they needed to
[1:34:19] grow and the very next
[1:34:22] chapter chapter six he says let's lay
[1:34:26] aside amen the the the doctrine of
[1:34:31] repentance and of dead works and these
[1:34:34] things let's let's go on to
[1:34:37] Perfection amen let's go to the to the
[1:34:40] fullness the statue of
[1:34:42] Christ he was trying to get the church
[1:34:45] to rise up to move in the spirit of God
[1:34:51] but it was wasn't for him Hallelujah huj
[1:34:54] it was for the seventh
[1:34:56] angel to bring the church to that
[1:35:00] maturity so I say
[1:35:02] tonight that in in
[1:35:05] 1965 before the prophet left he said
[1:35:09] this in the message uh God's only a
[1:35:13] provided place of
[1:35:15] worship he said the church is hearing
[1:35:19] the
[1:35:20] message said but it's still
[1:35:24] too
[1:35:28] green he said it
[1:35:31] needs to lay under the
[1:35:34] presence of the sun to ripen listen 65
[1:35:40] he
[1:35:40] says that tells me that the prophet and
[1:35:45] his message is the same thing right
[1:35:49] prophet and Messengers the same message
[1:35:51] and messenger is the same
[1:35:53] thing is that right so that tells me
[1:35:57] that if he and this message was the one
[1:36:01] that was to bring the bride to maturity
[1:36:05] and when he left he said that the church
[1:36:10] that was listening to the message was
[1:36:13] not
[1:36:15] mature what does that tell you that the
[1:36:19] Holy Spirit has a word work in this hour
[1:36:24] through the
[1:36:25] message through the
[1:36:27] message is that right and what is that
[1:36:30] work to exactly to bring her
[1:36:35] up lift her up to
[1:36:40] maturity why because message and
[1:36:43] messenger the same
[1:36:48] thing and it's this message that is
[1:36:51] going to present to Jesus Christ a bride
[1:36:56] like none
[1:36:59] other did you know that when the Holy
[1:37:02] Spirit told him to pick up your pen and
[1:37:06] write he was writing about the Bride of
[1:37:08] this
[1:37:10] age not of the Bride of Wesley's
[1:37:14] agey not of the Bride of Luther's
[1:37:17] age not of the Bride of
[1:37:20] leoda
[1:37:23] Hallelujah you know why because when God
[1:37:27] wrote to those
[1:37:28] churches wrote to those ages he
[1:37:31] condemned them you're
[1:37:34] blind amen you're you're you're you're
[1:37:38] Jessel you you receive the doctrine of
[1:37:41] balam you have the Throne of Satan
[1:37:44] rebuke
[1:37:46] rebuke you lost your first love all
[1:37:49] these letters but when he told the
[1:37:52] prophet to write a letter for his bride
[1:37:56] in this last day he said you are the
[1:37:59] perfect precious bride of Jesus Christ
[1:38:03] you are a super
[1:38:07] race you are an invincible
[1:38:10] Army when she comes to The
[1:38:13] Headstone when she comes to The
[1:38:15] Headstone she will be in His
[1:38:19] image Hallelujah Hallelujah that's what
[1:38:22] he wrote about this bride in this last
[1:38:26] age and that's what this message is
[1:38:29] about but it
[1:38:31] takes hallelujah hallelujah
[1:38:34] this
[1:38:37] mystery to bring the
[1:38:40] bride into a Prof to
[1:38:44] become amen amen a prophetic
[1:38:48] class of people
[1:38:51] of the same
[1:38:54] caliber of Elijah
[1:38:57] hallelujah hallelujah was the Widow of
[1:39:00] the same
[1:39:02] caliber of Elijah brother Adam

[1:39:22] prophet in her
[1:39:26] house amen is that right and
[1:39:31] keep the prophet

[1:39:43] river amen or or the brook
[1:39:47] cheriff right amen he was being
[1:39:50] sustained
[1:39:52] by
[1:39:54] the by the
[1:39:58] pcal the
[1:40:00] Pentecostals were sustaining the
[1:40:03] prophet right but down here in the
[1:40:08] valley oh my come
[1:40:11] on did you know Jesus spoke of that
[1:40:14] woman in in Luke chapter

[1:40:39] was over here in the
[1:40:42] trial doesn't doesn't the scripture
[1:40:45] say that our our our fiery
[1:40:49] trials are more precious than

[1:40:55] fire amen amen she's over here in the
[1:40:59] refinery Hallelujah she's being tested

[1:41:08] struggling amen amen she can't pay the
[1:41:12] bills hallelujah oh she she's in in a
[1:41:18] drought but she doesn't know
[1:41:22] but God
[1:41:23] knows that he has predestinated
[1:41:28] her to keep this Prophet Al
[1:41:33] alive hallelujah
[1:41:35] hallelujah amen amen and God comes down
[1:41:40] and
[1:41:41] tells
[1:41:43] Elijah
[1:41:45] El I have
[1:41:48] ordained a
[1:41:49] widow to sustain
[1:41:52] you and when God tells that to
[1:41:55] Elijah amen she does even even
[1:42:00] know that she already has a
[1:42:03] commission she's in the trial she
[1:42:06] doesn't know nothing about no
[1:42:08] commission until Elijah
[1:42:11] comes and
[1:42:13] prophesies to her hallelujah hallelujah
[1:42:18] tells her feed me first
[1:42:22] glory to
[1:42:23] God

[1:42:27] know that that barrel of
[1:42:31] meal and that Cru of
[1:42:33] oil never went
[1:42:36] dry amen amen but the prophet tells us
[1:42:41] that every day it would
[1:42:44] empty
[1:42:47] Hallelujah but she had to believe and
[1:42:51] the very next day there was it was full
[1:42:54] again what is that
[1:42:59] multiplication is when there is a little
[1:43:01] bit of
[1:43:02] something and then it
[1:43:04] multiplies creation is when there's
[1:43:08] nothing
[1:43:09] there and then it
[1:43:11] comes into
[1:43:13] existence brother that's the power of
[1:43:17] the third pool when
[1:43:19] Elijah
[1:43:21] prophesied to that widow woman it was
[1:43:24] the third pool
[1:43:26] power hallelujah
[1:43:28] amen amen power of
[1:43:31] creation it was the opening of the
[1:43:34] word hallelujah hallelujah is that right
[1:43:39] and that is
[1:43:40] creation she didn't have nothing to
[1:43:44] eat but
[1:43:46] creation gives her something to
[1:43:49] eat
[1:43:51] that's what the bride has received today
[1:43:56] spiritually she was dead she was she
[1:44:00] didn't have nothing all she had was a
[1:44:04] little tiny
[1:44:05] Revelation glory to God but the third
[1:44:09] po speaks
[1:44:12] creation it brings
[1:44:16] Revelation from where there is none he
[1:44:20] creat
[1:44:27] Hallelujah
[1:44:28] [Applause]
[1:44:30] glory is that right Hallelujah so
[1:44:35] notice I said I said I didn't want to go
[1:44:39] to too long
[1:44:42] tonight but we're looking at this
[1:44:45] scene how that God has shown this in the
[1:44:50] scripture
[1:44:52] we can go we can go through through the
[1:44:55] whole Bible
[1:44:57] tonight and show you that every
[1:45:01] time there was a type of the prophet of
[1:45:05] the
[1:45:06] age on the
[1:45:08] scene there was a type of the Bride
[1:45:11] also and there was a type of
[1:45:15] Christ yes sir
[1:45:18] always Christ the seventh angel and the
[1:45:23] bride Christ the seventh angel and the
[1:45:27] bride that's Revelations
[1:45:30] 10 that's the seven
[1:45:32] seal Glory brother Bram said the seventh
[1:45:37] seal runs all the way back to
[1:45:42] Genesis and if Revelations 10 is the
[1:45:45] seven seal so this Christ the seven
[1:45:51] and the bride runs all the way back to
[1:45:55] Genesis is that
[1:45:57] right hallelujah
[1:46:00] hallelujah brother we
[1:46:03] see how tremendous this
[1:46:09] is Brother Ram tells us in the
[1:46:12] message mzc the great Prince and
[1:46:17] King there's three elements
[1:46:21] that that a man
[1:46:24] follows
[1:46:25] first is
[1:46:29] humanistic humanistic element El amen
[1:46:35] amen you're a human
[1:46:37] being that's natural that's this realm
[1:46:43] here
[1:46:46] natural
[1:46:47] second is divine
[1:46:51] Revelation brother this is William
[1:46:56] brandham right here this is
[1:46:58] William this ain't Benny hen and is
[1:47:01] Benny hen oh my this ain't uh you know
[1:47:05] Earl Roberts is or Roberts Billy Graham
[1:47:07] or Billy Graham this this is William
[1:47:09] Bram this is William
[1:47:12] Bram amen that's right no one of these
[1:47:17] men were able to produce
[1:47:22] Christ reproduce
[1:47:25] Christ in their
[1:47:28] life hallu
[1:47:31] Hallelujah
[1:47:34] brother wow I want to get too critical
[1:47:36] but you know
[1:47:40] what there's no
[1:47:45] comparison so when we hear from
[1:47:49] him we got to pay
[1:47:52] attention amen he's teaching
[1:47:54] us like
[1:47:56] Elijah taught
[1:48:00] Elija he's teaching us like Jesus taught
[1:48:04] his
[1:48:06] disciples he's teaching us that's what
[1:48:09] this message is to
[1:48:11] me when I when I'm hearing this message
[1:48:14] when I'm studying this
[1:48:16] message amen amen is Christ teaching me
[1:48:22] hallelujah
[1:48:24] amen are we sons of the
[1:48:29] Prophet has he birthed
[1:48:32] us hallelujah hallelujah has he has he
[1:48:35] gave us
[1:48:36] birth
[1:48:38] hallelujah hallelujah brother amen
[1:48:40] hallelujah did you know that
[1:48:44] Abraham he thought that
[1:48:48] Isaac was the son that God promised
[1:48:52] him and it was in the
[1:48:56] natural nothing against that amen amen
[1:49:01] but brother Bram tells
[1:49:03] us that the
[1:49:05] son that he was really speaking of was
[1:49:09] Christ he said the son of his
[1:49:12] faith hallelujah amen glory to God big
[1:49:16] difference the son of his faith how many
[1:49:19] sons of his faith we have here
[1:49:22] to amen he is our Hallelujah he is the
[1:49:27] father of rapturing
[1:49:30] Faith hallelujah hallelujah Abraham was
[1:49:33] the father of the
[1:49:34] faith Glory William Bram the father of
[1:49:38] rapturing
[1:49:41] Fai
[1:49:43] Hallelujah now notice he says first is
[1:49:49] humanistic
[1:49:50] second is divine
[1:49:54] revelation so brother and sister divine
[1:49:59] revelation is another
[1:50:02] element that follows the bride of
[1:50:05] Christ
[1:50:07] amen and the
[1:50:11] third the
[1:50:14] vision and that is thus sayith the
[1:50:19] Lord
[1:50:20] first
[1:50:22] humanistic
[1:50:24] second Divine
[1:50:26] Revelation
[1:50:28] Third the
[1:50:30] vision that's thus sayth the
[1:50:36] Lord now brother watch what he
[1:50:39] says he says many times we're down here
[1:50:45] humanistic
[1:50:46] realm
[1:50:47] never and never climb into
[1:50:52] this if you're not down in
[1:50:56] there cast your
[1:50:59] hopes through the
[1:51:01] veil that's up here to thus sayth the
[1:51:07] Lord though you don't see the
[1:51:10] vision though Revelation doesn't
[1:51:14] come
[1:51:17] see see amen amen so you might not go to
[1:51:22] the
[1:51:23] second or the third but believe cast
[1:51:27] your
[1:51:30] hopes see when you're prayed
[1:51:35] for you say I just wish I could
[1:51:39] believe that doesn't make any difference
[1:51:42] cast your anchor down there
[1:51:45] anyhow call it
[1:51:47] so amen call it so anyhow
[1:51:51] so brother Bram is telling
[1:51:54] us that we don't have to in order to
[1:51:57] come into this
[1:52:00] realm amen amen we don't have to start
[1:52:03] with
[1:52:05] it you understand we don't have to have
[1:52:08] the
[1:52:09] vision to go into that
[1:52:12] realm no we don't have to have the
[1:52:15] Revelation to enter into that realm we
[1:52:18] got to believe
[1:52:21] in these
[1:52:23] Realms and place our
[1:52:25] faith in this
[1:52:27] realm amen
[1:52:30] amen is that
[1:52:32] right now he
[1:52:34] says that the second
[1:52:36] realm is divine
[1:52:39] revelation and the third is a
[1:52:43] vision thus sayith the
[1:52:45] Lord now we
[1:52:47] know according the the prophet of God
[1:52:51] spoken words The Original
[1:52:54] Seed he said the
[1:52:56] bride this is the
[1:52:58] secret the bride
[1:53:01] has thus say the
[1:53:03] Lord
[1:53:06] amen amen or she keeps
[1:53:10] still is that
[1:53:13] right so that tells
[1:53:15] me that the
[1:53:18] bride
[1:53:21] is coming
[1:53:22] up or is
[1:53:24] now or will
[1:53:26] come hallelujah hallelujah to this Third
[1:53:31] Realm is that right amen of
[1:53:35] vision that's Prophet that's
[1:53:40] prophetic vision is
[1:53:44] prophetic amen amen open
[1:53:47] Vision in the days of Samuel the word of
[1:53:50] the Lord was
[1:53:51] precious because there was no open
[1:53:54] Vision brother ROM said
[1:53:56] Isaiah when his influence
[1:53:59] died King Uzziah he saw the open
[1:54:04] Vision amenallah open
[1:54:07] vision is the
[1:54:09] word
[1:54:11] open before you how many
[1:54:15] knows that the vision of the
[1:54:18] word is the highest thing there
[1:54:24] islu nothing
[1:54:26] higher than the vision of the
[1:54:30] word it's
[1:54:32] higher than a
[1:54:35] vision let's say a vision of
[1:54:39] something amen amen it's
[1:54:43] higher now in the message the revelation
[1:54:46] of Jesus
[1:54:48] Christ brother Ram says
[1:54:51] this this
[1:54:54] book is the most official
[1:54:57] book of any book in the
[1:55:00] Bible this is the only book that Christ
[1:55:03] put his seal
[1:55:05] upon it starts with the blessing and
[1:55:07] ends with the
[1:55:09] curse it's the only book that Christ
[1:55:11] wrote
[1:55:13] himself of the whole
[1:55:16] Bible amen the it's the
[1:55:21] Revelation Satan hates any book in the
[1:55:25] Bible if he hates any book in the
[1:55:28] Bible it's the
[1:55:32] Revelation see he hates all
[1:55:35] scripture the whole Cannon of
[1:55:38] scripture but he he he despises mostly
[1:55:41] Revelation and
[1:55:45] Genesis because Genesis tells the
[1:55:48] beginning Revelation reveals what's
[1:55:51] going to happen to him in the last
[1:55:55] day going to be bound for a thousand
[1:55:59] years and him and the false
[1:56:01] prophet the pope and the Beast is going
[1:56:05] to be thrown alive into the Lake of
[1:56:09] Fire he'll attack the Book of
[1:56:12] Genesis about it being
[1:56:14] authentic he'll stir the minds of the
[1:56:17] people watch where the devil
[1:56:20] lays see that book of Genesis or that
[1:56:24] book of
[1:56:25] Revelation the first and the last and
[1:56:29] the Book of
[1:56:30] Revelation has more
[1:56:32] symbols in it than all the rest of the
[1:56:35] books of the
[1:56:37] Bible it has more symbols because it is
[1:56:41] a
[1:56:42] book of Prophecy it is a prophetic book
[1:56:48] for it has to be
[1:56:51] understood by a prophetic
[1:56:56] class hallelujah it's got to be
[1:57:00] understood by a prophetic
[1:57:04] class amen that's what we're speaking on
[1:57:07] tonight prophetic
[1:57:09] class this book is not
[1:57:14] meant for
[1:57:16] everybody amen only
[1:57:20] for the prophetic
[1:57:22] class not for
[1:57:25] everybody for the prophetic
[1:57:29] class there's
[1:57:31] nobody that can understand it
[1:57:35] hardly but this book is made for a
[1:57:40] certain class of
[1:57:43] people hallelujah amen over in
[1:57:47] Deuteronomy it says the hidden things
[1:57:50] belong to the Lord that is right and he
[1:57:54] reveals to us his children where his
[1:57:58] children
[1:57:59] tonight Hallelujah where his children
[1:58:02] are tonight he reveals to us the hidden
[1:58:08] things amen glory to God
[1:58:11] GL the carinal
[1:58:14] Mind listen the caral
[1:58:17] mind the one that's in the
[1:58:20] humanistic Hallelujah the one that's in
[1:58:23] that Realm of the
[1:58:25] natural he cannot
[1:58:29] comprehend them great things of the
[1:58:32] scripture because it's foolish to
[1:58:35] them but to the
[1:58:38] ones who are lovers of the word of
[1:58:42] God that's who the book was written
[1:58:47] to to the church the
[1:58:50] revelation of Jesus Christ to the Church
[1:58:54] of Ephesus to the Church of to the
[1:58:58] churches on down on down the revelation
[1:59:01] of Jesus
[1:59:02] Christ to the
[1:59:04] church amen
[1:59:07] amen it's a prophetic
[1:59:09] class see I'm I'm giving you my
[1:59:14] introduction I love it to talk about
[1:59:18] Ezekiel
[1:59:20] that's okay because that's who Ezekiel
[1:59:24] is hallelujah hallelujah he's he's a
[1:59:27] prophetic
[1:59:29] class like John in the Book of
[1:59:32] Revelation John is the
[1:59:35] eag he's not the lion he's not the man
[1:59:40] he's not the ox John is the
[1:59:43] eag and he's a type of the
[1:59:45] Bride but there was bride in every age
[1:59:49] amen there was bride in every age but
[1:59:52] the Bride of every age didn't hear what
[1:59:56] John
[1:59:58] heard hallelujah hallelujah so he is a
[2:00:01] more perfect
[2:00:04] type of this bride of this last
[2:00:08] day hallelujah
[2:00:11] hallelujah
[2:00:13] Glory now
[2:00:16] watch I'mma I'll read this later but I'm
[2:00:19] going to come down
[2:00:21] here brother BR
[2:00:26] says watch
[2:00:29] this he says you will
[2:00:31] recall that I mentioned at the beginning
[2:00:34] of this
[2:00:35] message that this book The Book of
[2:00:39] Revelation that we are
[2:00:41] studying is the actual revelation of
[2:00:44] Jesus
[2:00:46] himself this is the revelation of Jesus
[2:00:48] Christ from the book that everyone
[2:00:53] hates and the bride
[2:00:56] loves Hallelujah say amen amen
[2:00:59] hallelujah this is from the
[2:01:02] exposition but he says
[2:01:06] here in the church listen this book that
[2:01:11] we are
[2:01:12] studying is the actual revelation of
[2:01:15] Jesus himself in the church
[2:01:21] and his work in the future
[2:01:26] ages amen and I
[2:01:29] mentioned that it takes the Holy
[2:01:34] Spirit to give us the
[2:01:38] Revelation or we will fail to get
[2:01:42] it listen to this bringing these two
[2:01:46] thoughts
[2:01:48] together you will
[2:01:50] see that it won't
[2:01:53] take just an ordinary
[2:01:57] [Music]
[2:02:00] study see oh brother I can study
[2:02:03] it I can study
[2:02:06] it see study it compare
[2:02:09] scriptures he's going to say it right
[2:02:11] here and that makes me the prophetic
[2:02:17] class no out it takes more than
[2:02:22] that watch what he
[2:02:27] says you will see that it won't take
[2:02:31] just an ordinary
[2:02:34] study and
[2:02:36] thinking to make this book
[2:02:41] real it is going to take the
[2:02:46] operation of the Holy Ghost
[2:02:50] that
[2:02:51] means this book can't be
[2:02:55] revealed to
[2:02:57] anyone but a special class of
[2:03:02] people it will take
[2:03:06] one a people with prophetic
[2:03:12] Insight hallelujah amen prophetic
[2:03:17] Insight if will
[2:03:21] require the
[2:03:23] ability to
[2:03:25] hear from
[2:03:28] God oh no no one can hear from God
[2:03:35] brother no one can hear from
[2:03:38] God if you want the
[2:03:41] revelation of this book you have to have
[2:03:45] the
[2:03:46] ability to hear from God
[2:03:50] it will
[2:03:51] require
[2:03:53] Supernatural
[2:03:57] instruction oh my
[2:04:01] Hallelujah this is
[2:04:03] powerful it will
[2:04:05] require Supernatural
[2:04:09] instruction not just a
[2:04:13] student comparing verse with
[2:04:17] verse though that is
[2:04:20] good but a
[2:04:23] mystery
[2:04:25] requires the
[2:04:27] teaching of the
[2:04:29] spirit or it never becomes
[2:04:34] clear how we need to hear from
[2:04:39] God and lay ourselves
[2:04:42] open and become
[2:04:46] yielded to the spirit to hear and know
[2:04:52] oh brother you hear those words of the
[2:04:55] Prophet you hear this oh my there's an
[2:04:59] anointing here
[2:05:01] tonight a
[2:05:03] mystery
[2:05:04] requires the teaching of the spirit or
[2:05:08] it never becomes
[2:05:10] clear we how we
[2:05:13] need to hear from God and lay
[2:05:17] ourselves open before him become
[2:05:22] yielded to the spirit to
[2:05:26] hear and to know stand your feet
[2:05:31] tonight hallelujah oh brother
[2:05:35] sister this is the
[2:05:39] class Hallelujah that this message
[2:05:45] produces this
[2:05:47] class amen this prophetic
[2:05:50] class is the
[2:05:53] class that he's going to present to
[2:05:55] Jesus
[2:06:00] Christ this class is the
[2:06:05] trophies of his of his
[2:06:09] ministry this
[2:06:11] class hallelujah hallelujah is the rest
[2:06:15] of the
[2:06:16] grains that will come to
[2:06:19] maturity hallelujah hallelujah this
[2:06:24] class there was one
[2:06:26] grain that come to
[2:06:28] maturity to be waved over the
[2:06:32] people hallelujah hallelujah to open a
[2:06:36] way so that the rest of them can also
[2:06:40] have a
[2:06:43] resurrection
[2:06:45] hallelujah amen amen it is the right
[2:06:48] rising of the
[2:06:50] sun glory to God the son has
[2:06:56] risen how did it
[2:06:59] rise how did it
[2:07:02] rise brother bam said what a
[2:07:05] resurrection that
[2:07:08] was but what a
[2:07:11] resurrection this
[2:07:14] is let me ask you how did the son
[2:07:21] rise
[2:07:22] again in the evening
[2:07:25] time it
[2:07:27] Rose in one
[2:07:31] grain coming to
[2:07:33] maturity the sun rose
[2:07:36] again because there was
[2:07:39] Darkness Hallelujah through all the
[2:07:41] church
[2:07:43] ages the darkest of
[2:07:46] all Hallelujah but but in that brand new
[2:07:50] day glory to
[2:07:52] God in that new
[2:07:55] age the bright age hallelujah hallelujah
[2:07:59] there there had to be one to rise
[2:08:03] first amen
[2:08:05] amen to
[2:08:07] come to that
[2:08:10] maturity that was the
[2:08:14] resurrection of
[2:08:16] Christ again
[2:08:22] how we
[2:08:24] need to hear from
[2:08:27] God lay
[2:08:30] ourselves before the
[2:08:33] son see you see how how powerful that
[2:08:39] is if the sun has
[2:08:43] risen the
[2:08:45] sun is shining down
[2:08:50] to
[2:08:52] ripen that's what the sun is
[2:08:55] for
[2:08:57] amen so what does that tell
[2:09:00] you if the
[2:09:02] sun had not
[2:09:04] risen there could not be no
[2:09:08] maturity but the reason that you and I
[2:09:13] today can come to
[2:09:15] maturity is because the Sun
[2:09:19] has
[2:09:21] risen and that's why I said
[2:09:24] earlier when the prophet
[2:09:28] left one of the last
[2:09:31] messages he preached in I believe it was
[2:09:34] November of
[2:09:37] 65 is where he said
[2:09:40] that the church has beginning to hear
[2:09:43] the
[2:09:45] message but oh he said oh how she needs
[2:09:50] to
[2:09:52] lay in the
[2:09:54] presence of the
[2:09:56] son to
[2:09:58] mature to
[2:10:00] ripen hallelujah
[2:10:03] hallelujah oh brother sister
[2:10:07] oh
[2:10:11] Ezekiel was told to eat the
[2:10:14] book and
[2:10:17] prophesy again
[2:10:22] again Hallelujah but he wasn't
[2:10:27] [Music]
[2:10:32] told to go to
[2:10:34] everyone he was told to go to the
[2:10:37] [Music]
[2:10:38] house of isra
