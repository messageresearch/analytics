when there's tremendous Faith like that uh there's great things that that are done great things that are done just like we were saying before we live we're creators of atmospheres amen hallelujah and faith is an atmosphere that creates and brings to pass the word of God amen amen we had a we had a tremendous a tremendous time uh felt my lot to speak uh one time and then another time Sunday night but we did something in short but uh that it was more uh strenuous because of other things that were involved besides the preaching and uh it was a tremendous tremendous this time that we had we also got to fellowship with some brothers that uh we visited before for the first time in in and the pastor brother forino and his son and his daughter visited Us in the meetings uh and we had a tremend mendous time of fellowship with with our brothers uh they said it's it's been very hard for many many years to find uh Fellowship uh like they have found now and uh it's a tremendous blessing and they're they're wanting to open their Church to for us to go and Minister there amen so keep that in prayer that God will continue to to bless them and uh and lift them up in the message the brother he's he's a he's an old he's a older brother uh and has really he's been in Generations past has many stories to tell knows the history about the message there inan knows many brothers that went from here uh and he he says it's not the same anymore amenl it's a different it's a different story today amen uh and uh he he was really blessed in our conversations in our Fellowship he was really blessed he was so blessed that I saw a man that old I don't know how old he is I didn't ask him I I saw a man that old jumped this High amen wow amen and uh Hallelujah he was definitely in the spirit and he said uh he said it's it's beautiful to see the sons of God and he said a lot a lot of that has been lost amen but this is the hour that the bride is and it's a Revival of the word and that word has to call something in our hearts it's not based on emotions it's the revelation of the word that stirs us brings us into a spiritual atmosphere where we're not wondering what the next person thinks we're we're in the spirit amen and that's what that's what counts amen and uh it's a it's a tremendous blessing uh just very briefly when we saw many things taking place in the services uh we we got to minister on the message influence uh king theophany and the Seven Stars and we got to kind of condense what we had preached here and bring it and then Sunday night uh our brother had already ministered and uh you know a little short message but the pastor felt led at the end and he said brother come up and and share some something so I got up in in in season and out of season amen amen hallelujah began to preach Hallelujah and the spirit of the Lord fell and then he said well let's have another brother come up and brother Jose went up and just greeted the people but then uh people began to come up for prayer uh they didn't want to leave they people were crying they came up for prayer and so the brothers formed a line and there goes two three more hours of service amen hallelujah praying for the people and uh tremendous tremendous deliverances there was a young man about 13 14 years old uh that had never his parents came up after we prayed for him uh he was delivered his parents his mother came up and testified that she had never seen her son in that condition because he was one that had some sort of spirit of depression on him and also he would go into some seizures and convulsions but the Lord delivered him and and he was he was uh even confessing before everybody that uh he wanted to give his heart fully to the Lord and he wanted the Holy Spirit and we prayed for him there the Lord really blessed him amen hallelujah am glor and uh and the mother come up happy and crying and and the pastor there our brother Israel Oles the the sister's Pastor uh of the mother she he was crying too and praising God and it was a tremendous time and that just opened up something and people begin to come up I I want want to get right with God too one sister went up and said i' I've talked bad about my brothers and I've had a bad attitude against my brothers and I want to confess him it and ask for forgiveness I want this root of bitterness to get out of me Hallelujah she was delivered right there and just tremendous things taking place uh and it begin to get more intense more strong the anointing and and uh people coming up and you know physically you feel like you're about to faint you know two three hours in the prayer line and you're not just praying some little you know carnal prayer you got to get in the into the the channel amen hallelujah and praying and more people and more people coming I don't know there was about 200 people I mean in the in the place I don't know how many came up uh but um we prayed for the people there people coming up for healing there was two young uh girls that were in a service for their first time they were brought from Guerero and they gave their hearts to the Lord hallelujah they accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as their savior amen repented from their sins and the father was very happy too amen a lot of great things were taking place amen amen hallelujah uh amen and then we we got to pray for a man the man since he got there and I had seen him through throughout the days uh he was a older man maybe in his 60s the man uh had some trouble in his in his ankles both of his ankles and in his knee I forget the disease but he was uh he had to use a cane and he he had he when he came up to the prayer line uh he told us first of all that he he has had this for years but it has gotten worse and worse and then he said that uh there about two years ago he he started to use the cane and he could could not give one step he could not walk he cannot walk or stand up without the can and uh and he said but he said but I have faith in the word of God in the word of God and I have faith in you all and uh and then he he said I'd like for you guys to pray so we begin to pray and uh I I began to pray just the Lord to heal him and uh begin to pray as Peter Silver and Gold Have I None but what we have this glorious message this life this token I give unto thee and brother not for my glory I say this before you and I know this is probably being uh recorded Mex see it uh they were there they were Witnesses when when we prayed that when we were praying everybody was silent but when we when that prayer was made something special dropped and and the people began to praise God and uh and uh we finished the prayer and uh and I felt something very very tremendous and and I backed up and I looked at the man I said you're I said uh according to your faith and and he began to cry and rais his hands and he gave the king to a brother he said I don't need it no more he began to walk Hallelujah he walked he and came back Brothers begin to praise and praise the Lord and uh and the brother that that whole night he didn't use it next day he was walking amen Monday he was still walking and uh later on I I heard heard what he he told his wife she was there and he he told his wife well you should sell you should sell the can amen say I'm not going to need it no more Hallelujah so praise the Lord that was just a little quick report of What the Lord Has Done amen amen amen let us open our Bibles tonight again in we'd like to open in the Book of Ezekiel 2 amen I don't want to go uh too long tonight but I just want to maybe open this scene to us here uh that is in the word of God and maybe open up a picture a little bit that if the Lord continues to lead us uh we'd like to to continue with it uh as far as the Lord would would want to lead us in this in this picture in this scene Ezekiel is a is a tremendous prophetic book amen how many believe that Ezekiel Saw our day amen hallelujah he saw brother B tells us he saw this this very Glory right here saw the four living creatures he saw the amber light from the loins up Ward and from the loins downward he saw the same thing that John saw and uh brother Bram tells us that Ezekiel amen was a a prophet amen that was uh how should I say uh a a contemporary with uh the Prophet Daniel amen and this is this is a tremendous a tremendous book and we find in chapter two uh verse three it begins to tell him about the rebellion of Israel and how it's a rebellious Nation how they have transgressed uh against the Lord amen and how they're they're they're stiff hearted amen amen and he and he's he's telling them whether they hear you or not amen they're they rebellious house you must go and prophesy against them and in verse six it says this and thou son of man be not afraid of them neither be afraid of their words though briers and Thorns be with thee and thou dust dwell among scorpions be not afraid of their words nor be dismayed at their looks though they be a rebellious house how many know brothers and sisters that this is an hour when these demonic Powers have come out like unto scorpions according to Revelation chapter 9 amen amen to influence the ecclesiastical realm yes sir this is a prophecy against the church this is a prophecy against those that know the law of God and have transgressed the word of God they're rebellious in verse seven says Thou shalt speak my words unto them whether they will hear or whether they will will forbear for they are most rebellious but thou son of man hear what I say unto thee be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house open thy mouth and eat that I give thee and when I looked behold in hand was said unto me and lo a row of a book was therein and he spread it before me and it was written within and without there was written therein Lamentations and mourning and wo hu Allelujah moreover he said unto me son of man eat thou that thou findest eat this roll and go speak unto the house of Israel so I opened my mouth and he caused me to eat that R see he caused me to eat that Ro and he said unto me said a man fill thy bows with this Ro that I will give thee then did I eat it and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness and he said unto me son of man go get thee unto the house of Israel and speak with my words unto them for thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech or of in hard language but to the house of Israel amen amen it's a prophecy to the church that's in the condition of Leia hallelujah hallelujah this is to those that are called out this is to Israel this is to the church amen amen and here Ezekiel amen is in this time and he has been called by God he has been called by the angel he has been called Amen to to take this word hallelujah and to prophesy amen and we want to speak on this subject the prophetic class amen amen the prophetic class and we find in 10 Revelation chapter 10 we know is the seventh seal and in this seventh seal we find that it's the coming of Christ hallelujah hallelujah and then he reveals himself through his seventh angel to the public he's revealing the son of man the seventh angel is not the son of man but he's revealing to the public the son of man that's the seventh seal then we see how that the Mysteries were going to be made known it was God himself unfolding and revealing his own mind to us through this message it's the coming of Christ is Christ being revealed from Heaven hallelujah hallelujah Christ has already come down to reveal himself and the Lord himself has descended with a shout that's a message hallelujah hallelujah and he had to do it according to 37 according to Malachi 4 according to Matthew 1711 according to Malachi 4 according to Revelations 10:7 he had to bring it through a prophet hallelujah hallelujah he had to bring a message to call out the bride and unite the bride in Heavenly places and prepare her for rapturing Faith Amen to call her unto a rapturing faith that's why the the messenger of Revelations 10 was going to do two things he was going to restore the hearts of the children to the faith of the fathers and he was going to reveal the mysteries of the seven Thunders which are the divine revealed mystery truths contained in the Seven Seals and it would be these divinely revealed mystery truths that were going to turn literally the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers so brother bam says in the breach between the ages and the seal it says what are these Thunders they're Revelations hallelujah what are these Thunders Revelations but those Revelations are contained within the opening of the book because the Seven Seals opens the book the book was sealed the Bible was sealed with Seven Seals but when when when Christ come down from heaven clothed in a cloud the book was already open hallelujah hallelujah and he gave this book to the seventh angel to reveal it to his people and the seventh angel begin to preach the mystery of God hallelujah hallelujah that the mystery would be finished brother Adam said when the seventh angel begins to sound not the years in preparation there was years of preparation like John the Baptist he was preparing the way but brother he said in the Rapture message he says I knew that all those years back there in the healing campaigns in in in those great meetings he says I knew that wasn't my Ministry that wasn't it there was coming a message in the message influence I believe he preached the one in in Bakersfield bersi or streetport Louisiana or streetport Louisiana but one of those influenceu at the end of the message brother Bram is trying to get the church which Mo no most of them were Pentecostal he was trying to get the church amen to to respond to the word of God and and they weren't responding to the call and brother Bram says okay he says let's go now into the second pool amen and he begin to discern you come from such and such a place your name is such and such amen and he said and and and this and this and the people begin to respond brother bam stopped he said that's where Satan has deceived you that's strong brother but he said that's where Satan has deceived in other words they were only responding to the sign but they weren't responding to The Voice Hallelujah the sign was to get your attention to listen to The Voice Hallelujah huj and still today in this message people are only attracted to the sign I believe the sign but there was a group of people called believe the sign that believed the sh and they never believed the voice and now they're blasphemers that will burn eternally in hell for blaspheming the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah brother when we see the word of God we got to see it clearly and when we recognize that the word of God tells us amen amen that this ministry of the seventh angel what was he going to do reveal healing no no he was going to reveal the mystery of God the Angel's commission amen wasn't to for him to stay in the in the in the healing campaigns hallelujah hallelujah it was to get the people to believe him amen that nothing could stand before him but he was born for the third pool hlu he wasn't born for the first he wasn't born for the second he was born for the third since he was a child amen he he would write poetry hallelujah hallelujah I am longing for a far away a far away Hallelujah on the Catalina Mountain on the Arizona line where the lion roars I can hear a lobo holler hallelujah hallelujah since he was in elementary he longed to go west the woman that saw him and knew that he was born under a sign he said you'll never she said you'll never have success uccess until you go to the West he was born for the third pool because when he went West it was by a vision and six dreams that all six dreams said I saw you go west I saw you go west I saw you going west and the seventh was a vision of seven hallelujah hallelujah yes sir amen and he said I wasn't ashamed to say that I was going west to meet with seven angels GL to God when the when the public service come that was a sign it's time to go hallelujah hallelujah brother and sister he was born for that purpose to come into the office of a prophet he wasn't born to be an evangelist he was born a prophet hallelujah hallelujah and his office was to be a prophet but in 1962 Tak con sides with he says I say many many times that I am not a prophet he says I say that not only to be humble but because I am not in the office of a prophet I believe what he said and I believe that he knew if he was in the office or not and in 1962 he says I am not in the office of a prophet amen amen but brother and sister he said the Lord told me do the work of an evangelist he said he never told me I was an evangelist but he told me to do the work of an evangelist you know that that scripture is in Timothy and that's the scripture that brother Bram put in the Cornerstone of the Bram Tabernacle amen amen you've seen the pictures brother Ram grabbing amen the quarterstone and he's he's going to place it there there's another picture where he's standing on the corner Stone amen glory to God Amen but you know that scripture was given by Paul to Timothy which was a pastor not an evangelist and he told him to do the work of an Evangel brother Bram wasn't a wasn't to be in the office of a of a pastor or the office of an evangelist he was born a prophet a major prophet a word Prophet amen amen to bring the message of God to bring the mystery of God Amen so he was to do the work of an evangelist until he come into the office of a prophet and when he went West hallelujah hallelujah in the first month that he went West a sword fell in his hand Hallelujah that was in January of 63 and then he begin to preach amen the way of a true Prophet amen amen he begin to preach about Amos and how what prophet amen how he was and how if Amos would come today to this day what would he say hallelujah oh my brother we know the story in February 28 glory to God he was caught up to meet Christ himself and seven angels amen amen and to bring the mystery of God and that is why we are here today that's why we have eyes to see amen amen that's why we we we are the fruits of this message got to produce a prophetic class that is going beyond the Realms of the ecclesiastical understanding amen amen that is going far beyond traditional way of thinking amen amen oh this is what the Bible means get next to yourself amen amen this is the mystery of God is Christ revealed in his own word Christ is the mystery of God revealed Christ is re revealed in his own word and we find in Revelations 10 that when he sounds the trumpet when he sounded the trumpet that's when his message began all the things that were in preparation goes with the message I believe the message from from from 1909 to 1965 amen amen because I believe that the sign in the heavens was announcing it hallelujah amen hallelujah and the angel spoke to him at six years old is that right Hallelujah and that's part of the message amen amen so notice that the years in preparation it it is it is part of it amen but according I'm not interpreting it in the message trying to do God a service without being his will brother bham said the seventh angel begins to sound the trumpet not the years in preparation he said but when the opening of The Seven Seals amen amen so when we see Revelations 10:7 then we read in verse 8 108 remember this is the seven seal and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it will and it shall make thy belly bitter but but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings amen this is John Amen in Revelation chapter 4 message brother Bram said that John in the vision though being one man he was representing the entire Church of Jesus Christ is that right he was representing the bride and we understand that in Revelations chapter 4 he was told come up hither brother Bram says that's when the bride will be called by the trumpet come up hither amen so John is the type of the Bride John heard the seven Thunders Roar hallelujah hallelujah brother bam said Daniel heard the Thunders amen is that right so when we look at this we understand that in this scene brother Adam said it shows us the mystery of the catching away of the Bride because he said the seventh seal is the mystery of the going of the Bride now he says that in Feast of the trumpets now listen to this when we begin to look at the seven seal brother amen am we begin to understand amen by the grace of God the seven seal was open amen amen amen that's a great thing the seven SE is open everybody say the seven seal is open amen amen hallelujah you see because today is a day where they where a lot of people say it's closed wow see and it's not open brother and sister when when we realize that the prophet of God amen begins to tell us what the seventh seal is then we know we got to understand that it is open hallelujah hallelujah but it's only for the bread of Christ Revelation chapter 10 is the seventh seal that's according to the prophet of God now when we see then that under the Seven Seals it was the coming of Christ himself in a spiritual form in an Angelic form Hallelujah in a form that he come to bring the Mysteries to reveal them but then he veils himself in the seventh angel and the seventh angel is the mouth is the trumpet that is sounding Hallelujah to speak to utter amen those voices amen why why had he brought the prophet to that place Amen in order for him to speak those things only until he come to that place he was able to speak those things amen hallelujah hello somebody all of his life he was in preparation God was leading him but when he comes to full adoption when he comes to maturity when he comes to the top of the pyramid brother Bram said the Capstone is seven Thunders but you see it's got to be connected with the individual because the pyramid it's not only dispensations but it's a man rising up an individual a a Seed of Abraham rising up hallelujah hallelujah unto the statue of Christ and when that comes to to the Capstone brother says it's Thunders so the prophet had to come to that spot to that place to utter these things see he entered into the office of a prophet hallu oh my you understand because he told us that in in 62 taking s with Jesus 63 he comes into the office amen he reveals these these Mysteries and from there out he continues to reveal them these Revelations hallelujah hallelujah these Thunders what are Thunders Revelations he begins to he's he begins to bring out the m my that was under the fifth seal theophanies he begins to bring that mystery out who is this milc word bodies he begins to bring out these things Souls under the altar he begins to bring amen the world is falling apart he begins to bring out mystery under the Sixth Seal vials trumpets amen amen tribulation these these demons that are going to torment and hot women you understand he begins to unfold what was in those seals see and people just think it was just just that week of the seals no brother it's Revelations that are coming out so so when we see this if the bride in this hour must be a prophetic class of people she is being led by God under the headship of Christ the original headship which is under her message and through that she is being led amen Amen to that same spot amen amen to that same maturity to that same fullness of the stature of Christ she is raising up she's coming up Hallelujah to come into her position Hallelujah to come into the knowledge of him into the revelation of him hallelujah hallelujah remember when Paul in Hebrews chapter 5 wanted to speak to the church uh about MDC he said uh I have a lot of things to speak to you about MDC but you cannot receive it all now because you still have need of milk and you should be teachers already amen amen and you should be teachers and you still need to be taught so that shows us something that shows us that the Mysteries that were in these Thunders do you understand amen cannot be given to somebody that's a babe from God to him through the messenger of that age so Paul could not give it to the church because yet they were babes amen so they needed to grow and the very next chapter chapter six he says let's lay aside amen the the the doctrine of repentance and of dead works and these things let's let's go on to Perfection amen let's go to the to the fullness the statue of Christ he was trying to get the church to rise up to move in the spirit of God but it was wasn't for him Hallelujah huj it was for the seventh angel to bring the church to that maturity so I say tonight that in in 1965 before the prophet left he said this in the message uh God's only a provided place of worship he said the church is hearing the message said but it's still too green he said it needs to lay under the presence of the sun to ripen listen 65 he says that tells me that the prophet and his message is the same thing right prophet and Messengers the same message and messenger is the same thing is that right so that tells me that if he and this message was the one that was to bring the bride to maturity and when he left he said that the church that was listening to the message was not mature what does that tell you that the Holy Spirit has a word work in this hour through the message through the message is that right and what is that work to exactly to bring her up lift her up to maturity why because message and messenger the same thing and it's this message that is going to present to Jesus Christ a bride like none other did you know that when the Holy Spirit told him to pick up your pen and write he was writing about the Bride of this age not of the Bride of Wesley's agey not of the Bride of Luther's age not of the Bride of leoda Hallelujah you know why because when God wrote to those churches wrote to those ages he condemned them you're blind amen you're you're you're you're Jessel you you receive the doctrine of balam you have the Throne of Satan rebuke rebuke you lost your first love all these letters but when he told the prophet to write a letter for his bride in this last day he said you are the perfect precious bride of Jesus Christ you are a super race you are an invincible Army when she comes to The Headstone when she comes to The Headstone she will be in His image Hallelujah Hallelujah that's what he wrote about this bride in this last age and that's what this message is about but it takes hallelujah hallelujah this mystery to bring the bride into a Prof to become amen amen a prophetic class of people of the same caliber of Elijah hallelujah hallelujah was the Widow of the same caliber of Elijah brother Adam said brother Adam said God had ordained this [Music] woman amen amen amen amen to maintain or keep the prophet in her house amen is that right and keep the prophet alive is that right because first when he was up there in the river amen or or the brook cheriff right amen he was being sustained by the by the pcal the Pentecostals were sustaining the prophet right but down here in the valley oh my come on did you know Jesus spoke of that woman in in Luke chapter 4 hallelujah hallelujah amen and of sidon amen which means the refinery where metals are melted hallelujah hallelujah brother she was over here in the trial doesn't doesn't the scripture say that our our our fiery trials are more precious than gold and it must be tried in the fire amen amen she's over here in the refinery Hallelujah she's being tested oh brother she don't have nothing to eat oh brother she's struggling amen amen she can't pay the bills hallelujah oh she she's in in a drought but she doesn't know but God knows that he has predestinated her to keep this Prophet Al alive hallelujah hallelujah amen amen and God comes down and tells Elijah El I have ordained a widow to sustain you and when God tells that to Elijah amen she does even even know that she already has a commission she's in the trial she doesn't know nothing about no commission until Elijah comes and prophesies to her hallelujah hallelujah tells her feed me first glory to God Amen and we know that that barrel of meal and that Cru of oil never went dry amen amen but the prophet tells us that every day it would empty Hallelujah but she had to believe and the very next day there was it was full again what is that multiplication is when there is a little bit of something and then it multiplies creation is when there's nothing there and then it comes into existence brother that's the power of the third pool when Elijah prophesied to that widow woman it was the third pool power hallelujah amen amen power of creation it was the opening of the word hallelujah hallelujah is that right and that is creation she didn't have nothing to eat but creation gives her something to eat that's what the bride has received today spiritually she was dead she was she didn't have nothing all she had was a little tiny Revelation glory to God but the third po speaks creation it brings Revelation from where there is none he creat Hallelujah [Applause] glory is that right Hallelujah so notice I said I said I didn't want to go to too long tonight but we're looking at this scene how that God has shown this in the scripture we can go we can go through through the whole Bible tonight and show you that every time there was a type of the prophet of the age on the scene there was a type of the Bride also and there was a type of Christ yes sir always Christ the seventh angel and the bride Christ the seventh angel and the bride that's Revelations 10 that's the seven seal Glory brother Bram said the seventh seal runs all the way back to Genesis and if Revelations 10 is the seven seal so this Christ the seven and the bride runs all the way back to Genesis is that right hallelujah hallelujah brother we see how tremendous this is Brother Ram tells us in the message mzc the great Prince and King there's three elements that that a man follows first is humanistic humanistic element El amen amen you're a human being that's natural that's this realm here natural second is divine Revelation brother this is William brandham right here this is William this ain't Benny hen and is Benny hen oh my this ain't uh you know Earl Roberts is or Roberts Billy Graham or Billy Graham this this is William Bram this is William Bram amen that's right no one of these men were able to produce Christ reproduce Christ in their life hallu Hallelujah brother wow I want to get too critical but you know what there's no comparison so when we hear from him we got to pay attention amen he's teaching us like Elijah taught Elija he's teaching us like Jesus taught his disciples he's teaching us that's what this message is to me when I when I'm hearing this message when I'm studying this message amen amen is Christ teaching me hallelujah amen are we sons of the Prophet has he birthed us hallelujah hallelujah has he has he gave us birth hallelujah hallelujah brother amen hallelujah did you know that Abraham he thought that Isaac was the son that God promised him and it was in the natural nothing against that amen amen but brother Bram tells us that the son that he was really speaking of was Christ he said the son of his faith hallelujah amen glory to God big difference the son of his faith how many sons of his faith we have here to amen he is our Hallelujah he is the father of rapturing Faith hallelujah hallelujah Abraham was the father of the faith Glory William Bram the father of rapturing Fai Hallelujah now notice he says first is humanistic second is divine revelation so brother and sister divine revelation is another element that follows the bride of Christ amen and the third the vision and that is thus sayith the Lord first humanistic second Divine Revelation Third the vision that's thus sayth the Lord now brother watch what he says he says many times we're down here humanistic realm never and never climb into this if you're not down in there cast your hopes through the veil that's up here to thus sayth the Lord though you don't see the vision though Revelation doesn't come see see amen amen so you might not go to the second or the third but believe cast your hopes see when you're prayed for you say I just wish I could believe that doesn't make any difference cast your anchor down there anyhow call it so amen call it so anyhow so brother Bram is telling us that we don't have to in order to come into this realm amen amen we don't have to start with it you understand we don't have to have the vision to go into that realm no we don't have to have the Revelation to enter into that realm we got to believe in these Realms and place our faith in this realm amen amen is that right now he says that the second realm is divine revelation and the third is a vision thus sayith the Lord now we know according the the prophet of God spoken words The Original Seed he said the bride this is the secret the bride has thus say the Lord amen amen or she keeps still is that right so that tells me that the bride is coming up or is now or will come hallelujah hallelujah to this Third Realm is that right amen of vision that's Prophet that's prophetic vision is prophetic amen amen open Vision in the days of Samuel the word of the Lord was precious because there was no open Vision brother ROM said Isaiah when his influence died King Uzziah he saw the open Vision amenallah open vision is the word open before you how many knows that the vision of the word is the highest thing there islu nothing higher than the vision of the word it's higher than a vision let's say a vision of something amen amen it's higher now in the message the revelation of Jesus Christ brother Ram says this this book is the most official book of any book in the Bible this is the only book that Christ put his seal upon it starts with the blessing and ends with the curse it's the only book that Christ wrote himself of the whole Bible amen the it's the Revelation Satan hates any book in the Bible if he hates any book in the Bible it's the Revelation see he hates all scripture the whole Cannon of scripture but he he he despises mostly Revelation and Genesis because Genesis tells the beginning Revelation reveals what's going to happen to him in the last day going to be bound for a thousand years and him and the false prophet the pope and the Beast is going to be thrown alive into the Lake of Fire he'll attack the Book of Genesis about it being authentic he'll stir the minds of the people watch where the devil lays see that book of Genesis or that book of Revelation the first and the last and the Book of Revelation has more symbols in it than all the rest of the books of the Bible it has more symbols because it is a book of Prophecy it is a prophetic book for it has to be understood by a prophetic class hallelujah it's got to be understood by a prophetic class amen that's what we're speaking on tonight prophetic class this book is not meant for everybody amen only for the prophetic class not for everybody for the prophetic class there's nobody that can understand it hardly but this book is made for a certain class of people hallelujah amen over in Deuteronomy it says the hidden things belong to the Lord that is right and he reveals to us his children where his children tonight Hallelujah where his children are tonight he reveals to us the hidden things amen glory to God GL the carinal Mind listen the caral mind the one that's in the humanistic Hallelujah the one that's in that Realm of the natural he cannot comprehend them great things of the scripture because it's foolish to them but to the ones who are lovers of the word of God that's who the book was written to to the church the revelation of Jesus Christ to the Church of Ephesus to the Church of to the churches on down on down the revelation of Jesus Christ to the church amen amen it's a prophetic class see I'm I'm giving you my introduction I love it to talk about Ezekiel that's okay because that's who Ezekiel is hallelujah hallelujah he's he's a prophetic class like John in the Book of Revelation John is the eag he's not the lion he's not the man he's not the ox John is the eag and he's a type of the Bride but there was bride in every age amen there was bride in every age but the Bride of every age didn't hear what John heard hallelujah hallelujah so he is a more perfect type of this bride of this last day hallelujah hallelujah Glory now watch I'mma I'll read this later but I'm going to come down here brother BR says watch this he says you will recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book The Book of Revelation that we are studying is the actual revelation of Jesus himself this is the revelation of Jesus Christ from the book that everyone hates and the bride loves Hallelujah say amen amen hallelujah this is from the exposition but he says here in the church listen this book that we are studying is the actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church and his work in the future ages amen and I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us the Revelation or we will fail to get it listen to this bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just an ordinary [Music] study see oh brother I can study it I can study it see study it compare scriptures he's going to say it right here and that makes me the prophetic class no out it takes more than that watch what he says you will see that it won't take just an ordinary study and thinking to make this book real it is going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people it will take one a people with prophetic Insight hallelujah amen prophetic Insight if will require the ability to hear from God oh no no one can hear from God brother no one can hear from God if you want the revelation of this book you have to have the ability to hear from God it will require Supernatural instruction oh my Hallelujah this is powerful it will require Supernatural instruction not just a student comparing verse with verse though that is good but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and know oh brother you hear those words of the Prophet you hear this oh my there's an anointing here tonight a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear we how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open before him become yielded to the spirit to hear and to know stand your feet tonight hallelujah oh brother sister this is the class Hallelujah that this message produces this class amen this prophetic class is the class that he's going to present to Jesus Christ this class is the trophies of his of his ministry this class hallelujah hallelujah is the rest of the grains that will come to maturity hallelujah hallelujah this class there was one grain that come to maturity to be waved over the people hallelujah hallelujah to open a way so that the rest of them can also have a resurrection hallelujah amen amen it is the right rising of the sun glory to God the son has risen how did it rise how did it rise brother bam said what a resurrection that was but what a resurrection this is let me ask you how did the son rise again in the evening time it Rose in one grain coming to maturity the sun rose again because there was Darkness Hallelujah through all the church ages the darkest of all Hallelujah but but in that brand new day glory to God in that new age the bright age hallelujah hallelujah there there had to be one to rise first amen amen to come to that maturity that was the resurrection of Christ again how we need to hear from God lay ourselves before the son see you see how how powerful that is if the sun has risen the sun is shining down to ripen that's what the sun is for amen so what does that tell you if the sun had not risen there could not be no maturity but the reason that you and I today can come to maturity is because the Sun has risen and that's why I said earlier when the prophet left one of the last messages he preached in I believe it was November of 65 is where he said that the church has beginning to hear the message but oh he said oh how she needs to lay in the presence of the son to mature to ripen hallelujah hallelujah oh brother sister oh Ezekiel was told to eat the book and prophesy again again Hallelujah but he wasn't [Music] told to go to everyone he was told to go to the [Music] house of isra Amen judgment begins in the house of God John the same the same type the same Revelation was told eat the book prophesy again amen hallelujah to every tongue to Every Nation Hallelujah huah Hallelujah brother and sister Heros that's the echo ech of that same voice going around the world today the Sons and Daughters of [Music] God echoing out that same prophecy not a different prophecy not a different message not another message not our own message prophesy again that means one prophecy had already went Hallelujah that's the only prophecy brother is the message of the hour so if he is commissioning us to prophesy again it means that the same prophecy must be retold hallelujah amen Oh Glory to God let's lift our [Music] hands [Music] amen there must be confession there must be cleansing Power by the fire of God the co from The Altar and then the commission who shall I [Music] send the bride can say here am I send me hallelujah hallelujah Heavenly Father tonight Lord God you know Lord you know our hearts father Lord God if all that we can present to you Lord as Ministers of the Gospel as sons of God when your Prophet saw the vision of the of the church in the condition that it was in he said oh

word being led by a witch amen oh God the World Council of churches yes yes Hallelujah but the one that was under the leadership of the Holy Spirit the prophetic class from All Nations the on that this message produces was marching oh God Amen father looking to the message the messenger and when one begin to to look a different direction she begin to get off of the step the voice in The Vision Cries Out get back in line hallelujah hallelujah where in the vision tonight Lord we are in that Vision tonight let us hear that voice get back in line if Lord we if we have tried to look any other
