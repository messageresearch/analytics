[0:00] come to the Judgment as brother BR would
[0:03] say it many times he could not come to
[0:06] the Judgment because he's already judged
[0:09] in Jesus Christ they took our judgment
[0:13] and Paul said in Romans 8 there is no
[0:17] condemnation to them that walk after the
[0:20] spirit and not after the flesh because
[0:23] they have been quickened by the power of
[0:25] God inside of their soul bringing their
[0:29] their mortal bodies a quickening power
[0:33] that one day will change it hallelujah
[0:37] hallelujah here we
[0:39] recognize the same life the same power
[0:44] has resurrected
[0:45] us from a dead condition from death and
[0:51] sin and corruption in our soul and has
[0:55] brought our soul un life quickening
[0:59] power
[1:00] has brought to life what God had put in
[1:04] you before the foundation of the world
[1:08] you already had eternal life you already
[1:11] had joy in you you already had the
[1:14] thought of God in you you already had
[1:16] the Gen in you you already had the soul
[1:20] that come from God and that Soul was an
[1:24] eternal thought that come out of God in
[1:26] the beginning and that show in there was
[1:29] in dead condition Hallelujah the soul
[1:33] that sin that Soul shall die amen but
[1:37] you were born in sin sh iniquity brother
[1:40] Adam said your soul is the nature to
[1:45] your spirit and your spirit controls
[1:48] your body so therefore from the soul
[1:51] there was a nature that was controlling
[1:54] your spirit and your spirit was
[1:56] controlling your body for your soul was
[1:58] in a dead condition
[2:01] but yet like the body of Christ it was
[2:03] in the Tomb the body was in a dead
[2:06] condition but that body was the spoken
[2:09] word of God from the mouth of the Angel
[2:13] it was a creation it was a seed it was
[2:17] the blood of God that had come into Mary
[2:22] and produced a son and just as that is
[2:26] the soul of the bride of
[2:28] Christ
[2:30] and in that Soul was in a dead condition
[2:34] but in the Third Day Life came into that
[2:37] soul and when life come into the body of
[2:41] Christ there was a
[2:43] resurrection and when life comes into
[2:46] the soul of the believer there is a
[2:55] resurrection hallelujah hallelujah
[2:58] that's why he said he that Hearth my
[3:01] word and believeth on him that sh me
[3:05] Adam said in the Easter
[3:07] seal he that heareth my word he said
[3:11] what does that mean he that
[3:13] understandeth his
[3:15] position in this
[3:20] hour hu has passed from Death life why
[3:25] because he has been brought to his
[3:28] position
[3:30] he was he was in death and
[3:32] sin but he has been brought to life when
[3:36] you're brought to life you're brought to
[3:38] your position when you're brought to
[3:41] life you're brought to where you always
[3:43] were supposed to
[3:46] be Hallelujah you weren't saved on a
[3:49] certain day you was always
[3:52] saved Hallelujah you just
[3:56] recognizing what you were supposed to be
[3:59] for the foundation of the
[4:04] world Satan did not stop God's

[4:14] what he says no matter what he tries to
[4:18] do you cannot stop God's program for God

[4:24] Prevail above the enemy
[4:28] Hallelujah
[4:30] and then Jesus says verily verily I say
[4:33] to you verse 25 the hour is coming and
[4:38] now
[4:39] is how many times did Jesus say that he
[4:43] said it in the chapter before
[4:45] this chapter 4 he told the woman at the
[4:49] well the hour is coming and now
[4:52] is when the true
[4:55] worshippers shall worship the Father the
[4:58] spirit and Truth
[5:01] why brother teaches us that God's
[5:04] provided place of
[5:06] worship why was he saying that because
[5:09] the pillar of fire that was in the
[5:12] temple in Jerusalem behind the veil the
[5:17] holy of holies the sh Glory was no
[5:20] longer
[5:22] there it had lift up and it had gone to
[5:27] another Temple huj
[5:32] amen
[5:35] amen
[5:36] amen hallelujah hallelujah when to come
[5:40] into another Temple turn temp hallelujah
[5:44] amen Jesus said the hour is coming and
[5:48] now is you will worship the
[5:51] father in
[5:54] Jerusalem amen M or in this
[5:58] mountain to worship the father in spirit
[6:03] and in truth thank you amen is that
[6:07] right hallelujah hallelujah and
[6:12] what he says the hour is coming and now
[6:16] is when the
[6:18] dead shall hear the
[6:22] voice The
[6:26] Voice Hallelujah of the son of God
[6:34] Hallelujah hallu of the Son of
[6:39] God and they that
[6:43] hear
[6:49] shall and then look at verse
[6:52] 28 he says Marvel not at
[6:55] this verse 28 for the hour is coming
[7:00] and then he doesn't
[7:02] say and now is he just says the hour is
[7:07] coming amen did you get that amen
[7:13] am verse
[7:15] 25 he said the hour is coming and now
[7:20] is
[7:22] verse says Marvel not at this for the
[7:25] hour is
[7:27] coming in which all that are in the
[7:32] graves shall hear his
[7:34] voice and shall come
[7:37] forth and they that have done good unto
[7:40] the resurrection of
[7:42] life and they that have done evilto the
[7:46] resurrection of
[7:53] damnation he's speaking something that
[7:56] is coming in the future now in the white
[7:59] Throne
[8:00] judgment after the Millennium after
[8:03] everything
[8:05] amen then in that
[8:08] judgment there will be
[8:10] some or all of those who weren part of
[8:14] the first
[8:16] resurrection will raise in the second
[8:18] Resurrection to come before the white
[8:22] throne and some will be
[8:25] condemned and some will be brought to
[8:28] life
[8:30] amen is that right amen oh brother but
[8:34] let's not look too far down the
[8:37] road because of this what Jesus was
[8:40] speaking has a compound
[8:42] meaning to the power that was to come
[8:46] when judgment was going to be
[8:49] executed by the son of
[8:53] man Hallelujah and that execut of
[8:57] judgment Hallelujah was going to come to
[9:01] bring
[9:02] resurrection and Life to
[9:05] some and and
[9:07] Resurrection to show and expose some to
[9:14] damnation but show what they're made out
[9:16] of but show what see they
[9:19] are hallelujah hallelujah he brings them
[9:23] to a
[9:25] realization that they're they're cross
[9:29] they're damned in their
[9:32] denomination hallelujah
[9:35] amen they can no more come out because
[9:39] they've been AED in the
[9:44] ear this is what he shows there is some
[9:49] shown by the word in this hour by the
[9:52] message amen when the son of man begin
[9:55] to execute
[9:57] judgment when he come down from heaven
[9:59] to
[10:00] investigate hallelujah hallelujah in the
[10:02] first phase am he used the shout to
[10:06] bring a spiritual
[10:09] Resurrection is that
[10:11] right brother bam said it is the rising
[10:14] of the
[10:15] Sun what a resurrection that was but
[10:18] what a resurrection this
[10:23] is hallelujah hallelujah the one that
[10:26] was over there is what he said
[10:29] the voice of the Son of
[10:31] God Amen they that hear shall live and
[10:37] only is his powerful Only The
[10:41] Dead that were in God the Old Testament
[10:46] Rose
[10:48] from Matthew
[10:50] 28 right but then he speaks of something
[10:52] else
[10:54] coming when the son of man executes
[10:57] judgment all judgment is committed to
[10:59] the
[11:00] son when he come with the white wig you
[11:04] understand hallelujah hallelujah then he
[11:07] says there will be some that will
[11:10] resurrect un
[11:12] life there'll be some that done
[11:14] evil and resurrect unto
[11:19] damnation amen amen why are we saying
[11:22] this oh myuj because there's a great
[11:27] thing in here in what Jesus is
[11:30] saying and then we noticed that he
[11:33] begins to
[11:35] say John bear witness of me my Works
[11:41] bear witness of me my father bear
[11:44] witness of me the
[11:47] scriptures they witness of me hallelujah
[11:51] hallelujah what he said when he was
[11:53] talking about
[11:54] John he was a burning and Shining
[11:57] Light
[12:00] and you were
[12:03] willing amen you were
[12:05] willing Glory how many people in the
[12:08] message amen are willing to rejoice in
[12:13] that
[12:14] light glory to God that God sent a
[12:18] forerunner that God sent a messenger is
[12:21] that right amen amen to forun the second
[12:25] coming of

[12:36] recognize the second coming Hallelujah
[12:39] huj is in Bride
[12:44] form oh

[12:50] brother the very messenger himself
[12:54] is
[12:56] GL they're willing to return
[13:00] in the
[13:01] light amen of the message for a
[13:07] season what season the season when it's
[13:12] not yet the
[13:14] season amen of
[13:17] Jesus to come and fulfill the
[13:21] word you see while it was the season of
[13:26] The Prophecy of the prophet
[13:29] they rejoiced in the life because that
[13:31] was the season when the prophecy was
[13:35] going forth and they rejoiced in that
[13:39] light for That
[13:41] season but when the season
[13:44] changed we're speaking about the Bride
[13:47] season in this
[13:49] hour then when the season
[13:52] changed hallelujah hallelujah and
[13:55] brother Ram said the works of God are to
[13:59] be made
[14:00] manifest glory to God that's the problem
[14:03] with many today still looking at the
[14:06] caral still looking at the flesh still
[14:10] looking at these things and they're

[19:37] chance of an of a
[19:40] Revival a
[19:42] chance at the word in the seventh seal
[19:46] he said when the seals open it was all
[19:51] together to bring and call out a group
[19:53] of
[19:56] people in the spoken words you Original
[19:59] Seed he says
[20:01] again he said a Revival is when the word
[20:05] is quickened when the spirit is poured
[20:07] out upon the
[20:09] people to call them
[20:11] out
[20:13] Hallelujah that is the
[20:15] chance that a generation
[20:19] gets to either
[20:21] receive or reject what God is giving in
[20:26] that
[20:27] generation
[20:30] Hallelujah and
[20:32] when it's being
[20:34] given it this is what brother bam
[20:38] called a
[20:39] predestinated
[20:42] season hallelujah hallelujah a
[20:45] predestinated
[20:48] season glory and the SM Church age he
[20:52] says this Amen in the Blue Book glory
[20:56] amen hallelujah but to go
[20:59] on these
[21:01] elect were not only Eternal thoughts of
[21:05] God which were to be
[21:08] expressed in flesh in their due
[21:13] season in their due
[21:16] season but these same elect are called
[21:21] by another name then he goes into the
[21:24] scriptures Romans 4 Romans 9
[21:28] 3ans 3 then he goes on to say
[21:32] this notice he identified the
[21:36] seed with
[21:38] Christ and he counted the Sheep
[21:42] children as children of the
[21:44] promise promise having to do with the
[21:49] election now get this church the
[21:52] choosing of
[21:54] God the election of God that is exactly
[22:00] what we have been saying these who are
[22:04] the Royal seed are the elect of God they
[22:08] are the
[22:10] predestinated they are the forn of God
[22:13] and they were in the mind of God and in
[22:16] his thoughts then he says in very plain
[22:20] language the true bride of Christ was in
[22:24] the mind of God eternally
[22:28] though not
[22:30] expressed until each
[22:33] came
[22:35] forth in the designated and decreed
[22:43] season as each member come forth it
[22:47] began
[22:49] expression
[22:51] expressed and it took place in the body
[22:55] the body of Christ thus
[22:58] this
[23:00] Bri is the
[23:02] literal spoken word
[23:07] she and though she is
[23:10] feminine in
[23:12] designation she is also called the body
[23:16] of
[23:18] Christ it is very
[23:20] apparent that she ought to be
[23:23] called for she was
[23:25] predestinated in him
[23:28] and come from the same Source you know
[23:32] like Eve from Adam then he says which
[23:36] was
[23:38] eternal with him and now manifesting
[23:44] God in a many membered
[23:49] body where as
[23:51] on God was
[23:53] manifested in one member our Lord Jesus
[23:57] Christ
[23:59] Christ he said in Christ is a mystery
[24:01] God

[24:49] showed us something in St John 5 what
[24:53] did he show us he said the hour is

[40:02] mountain he said three years ago

[40:15] history the prophet

[40:30] history oh my GL brother it's hard for
[40:36] people to come out of the
[40:39] Season amen of that light and comeing to
[40:42] another
[40:43] season why oh because it's brother so
[40:46] and so it's sister so and so that can't
[40:49] be the
[40:54] word that's the same thing they said
[40:56] about Jesus he's the son of
[40:59] the he's the son of Mary oh brother but
[41:03] I've been born
[41:06] again I've been born of the same word
[41:11] that Jesus was

[41:33] first word ain't the word
[41:36] yet oh not yet my second birth is the
[41:41] word
[41:44] made but one of these days my second my
[41:48] first birth will we
[41:51] change in a moment in a twin of an
[42:04] hallelujah oh brother this is why it's
[42:08] hard for people to turn the
[42:11] corner
[42:14] amen you cannot
[42:18] recognize what the
[42:20] season is that we're living
[42:24] in well season
[42:30] amen I just read the
[42:33] quotes amen amen hallelujah am
[42:37] Hallelujah so
[42:40] amen so the
[42:44] season that we're
[42:45] in what season is
[42:49] it it's the
[42:52] season hallelujah hallelujah of the
[42:55] Bride
[42:57] yes I hope people not
[43:02] offended because
[43:04] Jesus when the discip when some of his
[43:07] followers that still wanted to stay in
[43:09] that life they were
[43:11] asking what do we tell Jesus he says ask
[43:15] him if he's the one that was to come we
[43:19] wait for another
[43:20] one bring it on brother to the bride
[43:24] hallelujah amen
[43:27] is this the bra come
[43:34] on
[43:36] tell Isaiah
[43:38] 61 is
[43:44] being Isaiah
[43:46] 96 has been
[43:49] fulfilled that these scriptures that
[43:52] testify me have been fulfilled
[43:57] that's why John testified of but then
[44:01] afterward The Works testified of him and
[44:04] then after that the father
[44:07] testified and then for the
[44:09] end the
[44:18] scriptures look the
[44:22] season that we're in is the season for
[44:26] the
[44:27] bride to come to full
[44:30] maturity in her place in
[44:33] Christ and when the last
[44:36] member the bride which is that
[44:39] place in that position in
[44:43] thison the
[44:46] resurrection that's the
[44:48] word and
[44:50] easy you see because look what brother R
[44:54] says God's Got A Time
[44:57] for all things it's got a time we can
[45:00] plant a
[45:02] corn and we got a time to
[45:06] plow we have a time to harvest spring
[45:11] rains
[45:13] summer
[45:15] rainfall
[45:17] snow you can't just say I'll plant wheat
[45:22] today and tomorrow I'll
[45:24] Harvest
[45:26] God has
[45:28] times for
[45:30] Seasons he has
[45:32] seasons for his word he has times in the
[45:38] scripture where he said the presence of
[45:41] the Lord was present to heal the sick
[45:46] and Jesus was ministering to and the
[45:50] presence of the Lord was there to heal
[45:53] the sick maybe at other times
[45:57] the presence of the Lord wasn't there to
[46:00] heal the sick you see what I mean we
[46:04] find out that God
[46:07] works everything
[46:11] seasonally amen when
[46:14] Moses what he failed to
[46:16] find was the time limit of
[46:20] God see now when God revealed himself in
[46:25] the burning bush
[46:26] he found that the very thing that was in
[46:29] the burning bush is the thing that he
[46:32] lacked I think that's a whole lot of
[46:34] with us
[46:36] today many times we try to do the
[46:38] program
[46:40] ourselves and we fail to get what was in
[46:42] the burning
[46:44] bush the direct
[46:46] revelation of the will of God and the
[46:49] time of
[46:51] God what God would would it
[46:54] do you to
[46:57] plant what good would it do you if you
[47:00] plant corn out
[47:02] today and it
[47:04] rocks see nothing would happen if it
[47:08] happened to sprout in the corn
[47:13] weather in the cold
[47:15] weather it would kill the germ it
[47:19] wouldn't work so we have to come in the
[47:24] season brother was talking about in this
[47:27] message believer's
[47:30] position in Christ he said there is a
[47:34] season when God has said in his word
[47:38] Romans 8 Ephesians 1 and many other
[47:41] scriptures he has already prophesied
[47:44] that there would come a
[47:46] season Hallelujah a
[47:50] season when there would be sons of
[47:53] God believers that would come to their
[47:57] position in
[47:59] Christ but it has to be in the season in
[48:02] the time which has been
[48:05] decreed by the word of God that's why
[48:08] when brother Ram preached spiritual food
[48:11] and do
[48:12] season he never
[48:14] quoted a scripture but I believe that
[48:18] scripture was pertaining to him Matthew
[48:22] 24 verse
[48:24] 44 and 45 where Jesus said blessed is
[48:29] the man that the Lord has called as a
[48:35] steward a good Steward to feed his
[48:41] servants
[48:43] meat in due
[48:46] season and brother B was preaching the
[48:50] message spiritual food due season and he
[48:54] was saying
[48:56] that is the message that is going forth
[49:01] now you understand hallelujah hallelujah
[49:05] and brother that is
[49:07] still the fruit of God that we are
[49:10] feeding on for he said an anointed on at
[49:13] the end
[49:15] time it's the body word of the son of
[49:19] man that's what we're feeding on then he
[49:23] says this food was not for the
[49:27] denomination he said the world knows
[49:30] nothing of it it's secret there not
[49:34] known this secret place you see the
[49:37] goodness and the mercies of God if
[49:40] you're sick there's healing there like
[49:43] Jesus told the woman the the sosian
[49:48] woman it's not it's not meat to take the
[49:52] children's
[49:54] bread and give it to the dogs Hallelujah
[49:58] that's not right because he had not been
[50:00] sent to the
[50:02] Gentiles and now today he visits the
[50:06] Gentiles in their time in their season
[50:11] Hallelujah you say what is what is it
[50:14] that the
[50:15] message doesn't go in those big places
[50:20] like the big
[50:21] Crusades like amongst the
[50:23] denominations it's not there
[50:26] food it's not to the
[50:29] church amen what they call Food it's the
[50:33] bride
[50:36] food did you hear what he said whose
[50:38] food is
[50:40] it whose food is it whose food is it
[50:44] it's
[50:47] food Glory it's for a spiritual
[50:51] food for the bride in a certain
[50:56] season that's why when brother Adam had
[50:59] the dream that he was bringing in great
[51:03] big
[51:04] watermelons great big things and
[51:08] cucumbers and radishes and and melons
[51:12] right he was bringing into the
[51:14] Tabernacle and God told him amen record
[51:18] these
[51:19] messages store food because there is a
[51:23] people that is coming in the future that
[51:27] this is going to be their
[51:31] food their food the brid food
[51:38] embarrass God left things in this
[51:42] message for
[51:46] our God left things in the word for you
[51:50] and me I left things in this message the
[51:56] bride recognize this is my season she
[52:00] would go to the message and she would
[52:03] find yes he said it's my season yes the
[52:09] prophet said but that was the
[52:11] prophecy and this is the Fulfillment of
[52:15] the
[52:19] prophecy the bride would be the final
[52:22] voice to the final age
[52:25] Glory final
[52:28] Voice final
[52:31] Voice
[52:36] final did he say
[52:39] final did he say final did he say final
[52:44] did he say final the
[52:48] final under her
[52:51] messenger she is the final voice because
[52:54] the spirit
[52:56] and the bride say
[52:59] come the spirit and the bride are saying
[53:03] the same thing the
[53:06] prophet
[53:07] the and the
[53:10] spirit the prophet the
[53:14] spirit the bride and the spirit say the
[53:18] same thing why because it's the same
[53:23] spirit in the prophet it's the same
[53:26] spirit in the bride and it's the same
[53:29] Spirit Hallelujah hallu in the in the
[53:33] final listen Hallelujah are you with me
[53:38] now I don't get carried away
[53:41] here don't don't don't go off like in
[53:45] your mind somewhere else stay in line
[53:47] with the
[53:49] thought look look what he
[53:51] says he says the Rapture is already in
[53:54] you
[53:56] yes it's already
[54:01] completed we are waiting for the Rapture
[54:04] yes which will come but everything will
[54:08] happen in its
[54:13] season so the Rapture comes in a certain
[54:18] season
[54:19] God I just read to you that when the Bri
[54:23] comes to her season
[54:25] her season is getting ready to
[54:30] leave her season is the season of The
[54:36] Rapture is that right what he says it
[54:40] will happen in
[54:41] season then this is the
[54:44] message uh Serv we would see
[54:46] Jesus and the message I have heard but
[54:50] now I see he says this inspiration is
[54:54] being poured out gather the bride the
[54:58] elect only the elect will see
[55:01] it you have hit this from the eyes and
[55:05] wise
[55:06] anded to baby that you would
[55:08] learn inspiration is striking it's time
[55:12] of the calling out of a
[55:15] bride what did he say spoken words
[55:18] original SE and the Seven seal the
[55:22] Revival for a generation
[55:25] is a calling out of a
[55:28] people when the seals were open it was
[55:31] to call the people
[55:33] out to give them a
[55:35] chance at the word at the
[55:40] Revival hallelujah hallelujah he said
[55:43] what is the inspiration
[55:44] striking it's calling out a bride and he
[55:48] says it's always been that way it's only
[55:50] poured out upon the elected
[55:53] seed now listen
[55:55] but remember the promised word of God
[55:59] through the mouth of Jesus the very God
[56:03] in the beginning that spoke
[56:06] creation into existence before the
[56:09] foundations of the world that said let
[56:11] there be and there was he was in the
[56:15] world and the world was made by him and
[56:18] the world knew him not but as many as
[56:21] did know him he gave him the power to
[56:24] become the sons of God the very
[56:27] Creator himself when he raised up
[56:33] Lazarus when he raised up Lazarus from
[56:37] the
[56:39] dead what did he say he said we read
[56:45] it brother quot it right here think this
[56:49] not
[56:50] strange for the hour is coming when all
[56:54] that is in the grave
[56:55] we'll hear the voice we'll hear the
[57:02] voice of the son of
[57:07] man see how that is so
[57:10] perfect scripture doesn't contradict the
[57:12] prophet neither does the prophet
[57:14] contradict the
[57:16] scripture read
[57:18] correctly verse 28 and verse 25 and then
[57:22] read this quote and see what the prophet
[57:25] is saying
[57:27] right see what the prophet is
[57:29] saying in verse 28 Jesus said Marvel not
[57:35] for the hour is coming that
[57:39] all that are in the graves shall hear
[57:42] his
[57:43] voice some will rise to Everlasting
[57:47] condemnation some to
[57:51] life and brother bradam says that's the
[57:54] voice voice of the son of
[57:59] man but in verse
[58:01] 25 Jesus said the hour is coming and now
[58:05] is when the dead he didn't say all that
[58:09] are in the
[58:11] grave the dead shall hear the voice of
[58:15] the Son of
[58:16] God and they shall
[58:19] live you see the difference how many see
[58:23] the difference say Amen
[58:26] you see the difference verse 28 is the
[58:29] voice of the Son of Man voice 25 voice
[58:32] of the Son of
[58:34] God GL and the prophet ain't
[58:37] contradicting it because he's cling it
[58:40] exactly like verse 28
[58:42] says think is not strange for the hour
[58:46] is coming when all that are in the grave
[58:50] will hear the voice of the son of man
[58:53] brother Adam said
[58:55] denominational
[58:58] gra hallelujah hallelujah when he
[59:00] preached he let us know there was grav
[59:04] of
[59:05] denomination he quoted Ezekiel
[59:09] 37 Hallelujah he said they come out of
[59:12] the
[59:13] graves and then he said why do you seek
[59:16] for the living among the dead he said
[59:19] denominational
[59:21] tombs Jesus is not in there
[59:25] he is calling people out of the
[59:29] grave but some come out of
[59:32] denomination only to be
[59:36] condemned you know why they can be
[59:39] condemned because they heard the truth
[59:42] they knew the truth and they rejected
[59:44] the truth that is eternal
[59:48] damnation and some come out of the Grave
[59:52] unto life and Resurrection
[59:58] GL that's the voice of the son of man

[1:22:49] listen to this Enoch knew
[1:22:53] he was
[1:22:55] AE
[1:22:58] Hallelujah knew he was a type the only
[1:23:03] reason brother Bram says in these other
[1:23:06] three quotes that I have here the only
[1:23:09] reason that God took Enoch in a Rapture
[1:23:13] is because he needed a
[1:23:19] time brother that's what he says
[1:23:23] and Enoch knew he was a type amen and he
[1:23:27] says he didn't want to leave he told his
[1:23:31] his his family I got to go he said he
[1:23:35] kissed his wife
[1:23:37] goodbye he said darling I'll see you
[1:23:40] later he took up his children and he
[1:23:42] kissed them
[1:23:43] goodbye because he knew he was a type
[1:23:47] Hallelujah I said where you going father
[1:23:50] he said I'm taking a little stroll
[1:23:53] amen but he didn't want to leave but yet
[1:23:56] it was becoming to him to fulfill all
[1:24:00] righteousness because he was a type of
[1:24:03] the church
[1:24:05] today he was a type of the church that's
[1:24:08] going to take an afternoon
[1:24:10] stroll one of these days in the King's
[1:24:15] Highway huah Enoch knew he says he says
[1:24:19] again he knew he was a type he had to go
[1:24:23] that way Elijah had to cross over and be
[1:24:28] taken up because he was a Ty amen and
[1:24:32] then he says again Watch How clearly
[1:24:36] this is
[1:24:38] Elijah I believe that there will be a
[1:24:42] message in the last days something like
[1:24:45] the message of Elijah listen and the
[1:24:49] Elijah
[1:24:51] Church
[1:24:54] the Elijah
[1:24:57] church will not die but will be
[1:25:01] translated and be taken up why because
[1:25:05] he was a
[1:25:07] type hallah
[1:25:10] Hallelujah Enoch was a top of the Bride
[1:25:13] El was a top of the Bride Jesus was the
[1:25:19] the the the husband the bridegroom
[1:25:22] of the bride and we are part of him
