========================================
glory to God Amen how many love the Lord amen God bless our brother Donald amen each one our brother our brother Jesus amen may God bless our brother amen and his family amen it's it's good to be in the presence of the Lord tonight amen and I trust that we come to receive from him amen and I also iting the prayers of all of the saints that God will just make a way I believe he has I don't I don't believe uh we're being led by by what I think or uh it's it's the Holy Spirit and and the message has declared it amen so we're going under that Vision amen under that understanding and we believe that God is still Jehovah Gyra amen and he's going to provide he's going to make a way amen and there's there's there's no uh there's no sense in trying to figure it all out but like Abraham amen he was going somewhere brother bam said he didn't know where he was going but he knew but that God was leading him amen and when he got there amen it was God's provided provided way amen even though he set up a little tent and brother bham says Abraham's tent was a little ripped amen amen that's what the prophet says amen his his cattle was a little was a little skinny amen he his knives were a little rusty amen amen he was having a little hard time out there in the desert amen but it was he was in the will of the Lord amen so whatever the will of the Lord is Amen brother bam said that's the safest place in the world is that right amen the safest place place is to be in his will and I believe that his will is his word amen amen so we can say well I I think this is the will of God but let's see if it's the will of God by the word amen as anybody can say well this is the will of God Amen but God's will brother Ram tells us is his his word amen so we're trusting in that upon the word of God and tomorrow morning uh we'll be leaving to Kentucky flying out amen keep us in prayer we'll be back Saturday to be here Sunday amen trusting that God will just put everything together amen amen so God bless you amen as we open our Bibles God bless you brother Enrique amen precious brother that loves this message Ezekiel 37 as we continue uh I was uh touching on it there Sunday night at at at the end and uh maybe it was the heat amen amen uh we were all a little tired I came out of the service half dead and then uh but uh I believe God is opening this up to us to show us the hour that we're in so we read in Ezekiel 37 and we're going to read from verse n remember that the first part or the yeah the first part of the prophecy that went forth begins in verse seven and then in verse eight he is beholding what the prophecy is doing and after the Lord is performing this there is still a part that is unfulfilled and this is where verse n begins then said he unto me prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind thus sayith the Lord God come from the Four Winds oh bre and breathe upon these flame that they may live so I prophesied as he has as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived and stood up upon their feet in exceeding great Army amen you may be seated may the Lord add the blessing in reading of his word amen if you turn with me to Ezekiel chapter 1 how many have been enjoying this study of Ezekiel I believe it's a it's a real Precious book it's a very perfect type and really the the entire Bible uh in this hour has been revealed the book has been open to show us that the seventh seal which is what's going on now is here throughout the entire Bible in Shadows and types amen amen it's hi throughout the entire Bible in the seventh seal brother bam said this seven seal goes all the way back to Genesis so you can trace it all the way through the Bible but it's hidden in types and shadows amen amen can can we see our day here in the Book of Ezekiel we can see it because the book has been open the symbols have been revealed amen the prophet has come with thus sayeth the Lord the highest order to reveal the word which is the highest thing there is the word is the highest order there is and the prophet is the highest order to reveal that word amen and when that word is revealed brother benam said it took the third pool to reveal that word amen and we see that that power of that Revelation has opened the Bible to us has opened the scriptures amen where brother Bram said if you can't find Christ in every in every story in every chapter in every verse of the Bible he said go back and read it again because Christ is in there amen and where Christ is amen his bride is amen and where Christ is the messenger for the age that was going to introduce Christ is represented somewhere in there amen was was was Isaac a type of Christ was elzer type of the seventh angel was Rebecca type of the Bride amen amen was Boaz a type of Christ amen was the chief Reaper of of boaz's field a type of the seventh angel amen was was Ruth a type of the Bride see it's all over the Bible you can't miss it but it had it's hidden in there but in this day brother bam said all of that was speaking of this Hallelujah am and that's the beauty of getting into a book like this like Ezekiel and be able by the message and the hope of the Holy Spirit to see clearly what what prophecy is in there because the Bible is a book of Prophecy brother bam said other books like the Quran and other books he says there there's books of code of ethics amen there's books that that show you you know how to be a good person he said but there's no book like the Bible this book is a book of Prophecy hallelujah hallelujah and that book reveals Jesus Christ from Genesis to Revelation Christ is revealed in Genesis Christ is revealed in Exodus Christ is revealed in Leviticus amen amen It's The End entire revelation of Jesus Christ amen amen and it shows us that Christ is revealed in his own word didn't brother Brandon preach a message Christ revealed in his own word he says the way I got that some somebody gave me a a beautiful picture of Christ uh Hoffman's head of Christ at 33 he says but the painting was all of the Beatitudes of Jesus in Matthew 5 on on on on on the mountain The Sermon on the Mount he says and the artist that that made that he says wherever he wanted to make the outline of the the figure of Christ's head he said he would press on the on the pencil harder amen and and where he was outside of the head because he was writing all the scriptures but where he wanted to make Christ figure he would press harder and when it was outside of that he would make it light and brother bam says that's where I got the inspiration Christ revealed in his own word amen amen and that right there showed brother bam said in that message he says Christ in order to be revealed he says there had to be light to come and shine so that we could see Christ and that's what the message is amen it shall be light in the evening time amen that light was going to reveal amen Christ hallelujah hallelujah when we see that brother Braham says in that message he says for ages they've walked in darkness he says they they were touching around trying to get around am amen he says but when someone turns on the light you can see clearly he says maybe in the darkness you can't see what it is he says but when you turn it on you see exactly what it is and that's that's what this message come to do to reveal all of the hidden things amen they could they could read the Bible but they couldn't really understand it it was still dark it was still kind of blurry they couldn't really understand what it was all about but when light come shine on the Bible to show exactly what it was speaking of and it couldn't be until the last time as he promised amen amen so Ezekiel 37 we see that he prophesied for the second time only a recycling of the same prophecy going out again amen a repeat of the same prophecy going forth is that right we all know what that is right amen amen so Ezekiel chapter 1 we read here from verse two in the fifth day of the month which was the fifth year of King jeah Kim's captivity the word of the Lord came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest amen amen the son of boozy in the land of the Chans by the river chabar and the Hand of the Lord was there upon Him amen so we see that Ezekiel was not only a prophet he was a he was a priest amen are we Kings and Priests in this hour amen amen Ezekiel interceded as a priest for the whole house of Israel amen he was in intercession and as a prophet he gave warning of the Judgment of God is that right God cannot bring judgment without first warning and brother bam says amen the sign of God the greatest sign is a prophet on the scene giving warning that judgment is coming amen is that is that our message Malachi before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord I'll s Elijah amen and he's going to do something with his Prophecy with the seven Thunders he's going to turn the hearts of the children living in this day back to the faith of the the fathers because there's coming judgment but first the warning is a message to prepare the people and make a way of Escape brother bam says in the days of Noah there was a prophet as a sign that judgment's coming and the prophet was saying get in the ark judgment's coming get in the ark judgment is coming and those who obeyed that message found God's way of escape and were're safe from the Judgment of God and in this hour is no different amen amen before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord I'll send Elijah and that message is going to make a way of Escape for my children because the seven Thunder is going to give rapturing fith hallelujah hallelujah that's the only way out the only way to escape the judgments that are coming is a Rapture hallelujah hallelujah and God has given us a message with seven Thunders to raise our faith and get out of here in God's way of Escape before the Judgment stri brother bam says before one bomb can fall bride will have to be gone now I don't care if Putin's in Russia I don't care what the world is doing they cannot drop a bomb until this bride is ready to go hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glor so everything is waiting on the bride amen hallelujah glory to God hallelujah and God has given us a message behold I seen you I seen you I seen you Elijah the prophet amen amen he send it to the bride predestinated seed to make a way of Escape for his children Noah and his family amen no one else just his family how many are part of the family Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the family in heaven and the family on Earth has a name the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah and that family amen amen has different has has a great album amen and we can look in the family album and say well look at my brother Ezekiel hallelujah hallelujah he he he's he he's my he's my far away brother that lived a long time ago but but but he's part of the family glory to God he stood for the word amen amen I can see his example I can see his faith I can see his conviction I can see how God dealt with him and say that's my family Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah blessed be the God Amen so we see that Ezekiel was not only a a pre a prophet he was a priest and in verse four it says and I looked and behold amen a worldwind oh my came out of the North a a great Cloud amen amen and a fire infolding itself wow and a brightness was about it and out of the midst thereof the color of amber out of the midst of the fire look at Ezekiel the reason I turned to the scripture is because I want to continue a little bit tonight on the Four Winds it was it was maybe a little a little bit hard on Sunday to catch what what this what what the Lord is trying to show us in these Four Winds it is one wind remember that how many remember that Ezekiel 379 it says prophesy to the wind singular amen amen and the wind when it comes com it comes from the Four Winds see and it breathes upon the slain amen and they live and they raise up a mighty marching Army well when we go to Ezekiel 1 and we see this verse four right here he says that in this vision of God Amen verse one says he saw visions of God right but what did he see the heavens opened so in verse four it shows us that a whirlwind came out of the North see a whirlwind amen when Four Winds see meet in the same place amen coming from four different directions amen amen it creates a whirlwind amen hallelujah because the wind is coming from four directions from the north from the south from the East and from the west and it's coming in one place where this body that has already been restored up to a third phase of it by the prophecy it's already been scattered but it's been brought or United together the Bones have come together the Senus have come upon it the skin is upon it it's a body but it's laying dead there's no life in it there's nothing there amen amen so this this wind is coming from four directions in one place where the body is amen right M now notice it says and I looked and behold the Whirlwind came out of the North a great cloud and a fire unfolding itself now I was mentioning Sunday night what this Breath of God means according to the message according to the scriptures is that right how many remember that Hallelujah that that Breath of God Amen is a power of the fullness of God which is going to place the body in the mature stage of adoption which is the fourth stage which brother bam said is Son of Man justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Spirit and adoption there's a fourth stage how many remembers brother Bram telling his mother's dream in the message it is the rising of the Sun and he said that Pentecostal woman uh in the dream brother bam was preaching telling the people they must come up three steps amen amen and he said that he he says uh he was showing them there was three steps they had to come up and brother man said that's exactly my message I was preaching the three stages of Grace in the dream and he said in this in this Pentecostal woman amen came up with some big old high heels amen amen and said well I'm going to go up these three steps the prophet told her in the dream sister you can't go up those steps with those high heels on amen amen and she laughed turned around to the West rest of the churches I mean women amen amen and told the rest of the churches you don't have to listen to that crazy man that's right correct that's symbolic because a woman represents the church one Church telling other churches you don't have to listen to this crazy man and and she said I I'll show you that that I can go up to three steps with these high heels and I don't have to listen to him see and and brother B said in the dream she went one up step two steps three steps what did he say that represented amen amen the three stages of Grace that's what he said it represented and he said she come up to the top and turn around said see I told you all I can be justified sanctified and baptized with the Holy Ghost and not have to listen to him and brother said she began to walk and the and the path up on the on top of the three steps there was a great Highway amen and it began to get narrow and she couldn't walk no more with those high heels when it got real narrow amen amen and she fell off brother Braham said the most her mother told him the most horrible screams amen that woman falling into hell uh I don't think that needs any interpretation it's pretty plain so the fourth stage in this hour is required amen a lot of people in the message don't want to even get into that but the thing is perfection is required in this age maybe not in the amen amen maybe not in Wesley's day Wesley or Luther's amen amen but in this age there's got to be adoption this is that dispensation this is that hour amen amen well how is it possible there was a man in our day that showed us it was possible amen he reached maturity oh but he was a prophet but he was a son too and he had to grow too and he had to learn learn too amen and he had to come to a maturity too amen amen yes sir so when we see that three stages were already in these uh bones of Ezekiel or the vision then the fourth stage amen amen was still needed and according to the fourth stage as we have just mentioned what is it adoption right amen all right I'm making it simple like that so you can understand and brother bam tells us in restoration of the brid tree amen amen he tells us here he said four messengers of death amen destroyed it took it away killed it in dogas four messengers of righteousness Resto restore her back again then he says prophesy son of man can these bones live he says I wish we had time I got it wrote down here but I have to miss that so brother bam had notes that he wanted he he he wanted to bring out more of this ezekiel's bones watch he says I he says I got it wrote down here I wish I had time but I have to miss that amen prophesy can these bones liveu he says what's the four stages that coming forth of that church is that's what the four stages of ezekiel's dry bones coming for see four stages of the church coming to full maturity he is talking about the bride tree remember it was the same insect in four different stages how many know that the bride tree was born at Pentecost hallelujah hallelujah and when it was born it was the tree amen was for seven Church you got it right for seven Church ages hallelujah hallelujah there was a tree amen amen but brother bam said four insects or one insect in four stages he also was a a a metamorphosizing right amen amen amen from a caterpillar to a Palmer worm to a canker worm right but it was the same old devil brother and sister look at Revelation chapter 6 Amen brother bam said the spirit of antichrist John speaks of it in his epistle first John chapter 4 amen we have heard that the spirit of the Antichrist was to come and he says it's here now Amen brother Ram said first the Holy Ghost came and brought forth a brid tree amen amen he said but [Music] four and messengers of death The Same Spirit Antichrist Spirit changing in four different forms killed completely the tree is that right took away its leaves took away the fruit took away the leaves took away the bark amen amen and cut it down until it was just a stump left but Joel chapter 2 says I will restore sayth the Lord all the years 2,000 years that that these four messengers of death all of the years that the Locust caterpillar canker worm worm I will restore say the Lord amen amen so notice when the Antichrist Spirit went out brother said it was the Antichrist on the White Horse amen he had an arc but with no Arrow amen he had a bow but no no Arrow hallelujah amen amen glory to God brother said amen that's Matthew 2424 close they could dece the very elect he he he he represents Purity he's religious he's clean amen amen but then the same devil turned into his Doctrine and and and and if you didn't believe his Doctrine he killed you and the White Horse turned red it was the same devil amen but then it from Red he turned black glory to God and from black he turned pale and brother Bram said The Pale Horse killed the Pentecostal church and she's dead and brother Bram said thus sayith the Lord she'll never rise again killed the church but brother he didn't promise to resurrect the Pentecostal organization or to restore the organizational system he promised to restore a bride tree and brother Ram said you know what he said he said that's the Tree of Life Hallelujah Glory you can go over to the Book of Revelation and John was in the New Jerusalem he says I saw the Tree of Life one on one side of the river and one on the other side of the river one tree of life one on one side and one on the other side hallelujah hallelujah the two are one of God hallelujah now notice why why did we touch that there because there's four stages amen amen but what did God use to combat each one of those horse riders amen amen or each one of those Powers same horse rider amen amen amen same horse just changing color but what did he use amen the the lion right amen he used the ox he used the man and he used the eagle power is that right so the first four seals reveals to you the history of seven Church ages 2,000 years the first four seals the fourth seal is the same as the seven seal yes sir because it is in mystery form amen amen now watch when we see then that it was four powers of God four anointings of God to come against amen amen this Antichrist Spirit brother Bram says that Satan listen now how we're how we're dividing this that Satan is the prince of the power of the air amen amen and in Revelation chapter 7 there's an angel that rises from the East with the Seal of God in his forehead and he tells to the Four Angels hold the Four Winds brother Bram said Satan is the prince of the power of the he said in the message the Seal of God he says in those Four Winds I'm trying to separate so you can see something those Four Winds going to blow on the Earth are not the Four Winds of Ezekiel 37 the Four Winds of Revelation chapter 7 are four winds that are are coming together listen the Four Winds are going to blow all at once all four of them at one time brother bam said what does that create Armageddon amen he said those four wi have never blown on the earth they were hold back in the first World War I believe it was 1914 to 1918 something like amen I'm speaking to a a war historian here amen amen so brother bam said first world war ended in the 11th month on the 11th day on the 11th Hour glory to God and no one know how it stopped he says it was that angel Christ that held back the Winds of God I I mean the winds which is which is Wars and strife brother said if those winds wouldn't have been held back amen from the first world war wouldn't have been no second it would have went to Armageddon so that shows you that those Four Winds together combined not just one win not just two wins four together will make Armageddon you understand now notice Satan is an imitator he's an imitator because he he has used also four powers amen he's used the White Horse he's used the red horse amen the the black and the pale see it's one Spirit of the devil but he uses different forms he he he uses religious see holy white he also uses another form I'll kill you if you don't believe like me like C amen amen see he killed Abel why because he didn't worship like he worship that's the red horse but the White Horse was the serpent speaking to Eve seducing her you see the different stages amen and then you see the black horse with Nimrod Gathering the wealth all of those things are in Genesis amen White Horse red horse black horse and then the Pale Horse the angel of death in the days of Moses in Egypt a Pale Horse so so in Genesis and in Exodus you see the four horses you see the serpent you see Cain you see Nimrod and you see Pharaoh bringing the angel of death amen but every time there was a power of God to combat that is that right when the serpent begal Eve Jehovah came down and spoke a lamb into existence and covered them when Cain killed Abel he rose up set and they began to Worship the Lord hallelujah hallelujah when when Nimrod came oh brother he sent judgments glory to God hallelujah hallelujah and brother said God brought out Abraham out of that out of that system Glory he sent an earthquake the Bible says in Genesis 11 and he shook amen amen the Tower of Babel Hallelujah yes sir and in the days of the Pale Horse there was a prophet with the power of the spoken word Glory that he would speak amen and fleas would come to he would speak and frogs would come forth glory to God and then he spoke and he said place the token amen amen this is the spirit of the eagle the prophet Moses combating the spirit of the Pale Horse that's the Bible is't it the same thing in this hour yes sir amen so when you see that Satan too amen has used these four powers see but Armageddon see this tribulation that is coming three years and a half is that right but after that tribulation amen amen there's an Armageddon yes sir Armageddon is to usher in the Millennium amen amen this is where the great judgments of God are going to fall the Earth is going to be purged fire is going to burn amen from the earth from the heavens amen and from atomic fire yes sir amen volcanic lava is going to burst out of the earth amen amen Brimstone and fire is going to fall from Heaven all of these things is coming in that time but notice the four powers of God together is the same thing see but this is bringing a purging a cleansing to establish his kingdom in this earth Hallelujah you see the Millennium is going to establish a literal Kingdom hallelujah hallelujah but this these seven angels hallelujah hallelujah bring four anointing see because in each Church age there was sending an angel amen and out of the Seven Angels there was four anointings Amen to all Seven Ages you understand amen all right see two two two amen mhm and then one now notice those four powers those four four living creatures amen amen those that power of these Winds of God a North Wind which is the eagle power how many know that the eagle down the north where where did Ezekiel see this worldwind come from from the north because that's where they they meet together oh brother amen the Four Winds weren't going to meet in in in the South amen with with the with the face of a man the Four Winds weren't going to meet in the west with the ox amen amen in the days of Columbo and Martin right amen they weren't going to meet in the in the East with the lion with Paul and irus amen amen no sir brother these four living creatures these four anointings these Four Winds we're going to all meet in the age of the eagle in the north then there was going to come at the End of the Age amen the fullness of these four anointings together to bring the seven rainbow color not just one color of the rainbow amen amen seven hallelujah hallelujah the angel coming down from heaven with a rainbow over his head seven colors seven spirits four anointings hallelujah amen amen you getting it now amen a little bit okay amen so brother R says there's four winds oh amen amen but it's one wind when it comes together amen and it's a whirlwind what is this Whirlwind coming out of the North according to Ezekiel 14 it's a great cloud amen hallelujah is that right read it right there E4 and looked and behold the Whirlwind came out of the North see a great Cloud see when the fullness of those Four Winds meet see it makes a great great Cloud what's in this picture here how many know that after brother Bram was received the revelation of this and he and he saw it in the Life Magazine he told it to the Tabernacle and he told us what this was seven angels 63 he told us seven angels he kept telling us seven angels like this seven angels seven angels amen this is the earth we looking up and this is what you see seven angels seven angels amen 64 still saying seven angels and it's true seven angels but it wasn't until 65 amen amen two years later that the Holy Spirit one day told him turn the picture to the right two years later not in 63 no no no not in 64 in 65 he told him turn it to the right see he was seeing seven angels see it's correct but the third the seven the seven turn into one amen Christ in which was the fullness of the godhead body Hallelujah you understand Hallelujah the seven separated Through the Ages was a portion of the Holy Spirit each age but together they make they make the fullness yes of the godhead bod in him dwelt all fullness the mystery of godliness God was manifested in flesh is that right amen so the seven make one brother bam said in the beginning in the great invisible Elohim El self existing he said the first thing that come out of him was a rainbow he said seven spirits of God he said red come out amen amen he said then orange come out green come out Indigo purple all of these come out seven colors and he tells us what each color means he said red the love that's what he said he said blue is tress amen amen the truth is blue and he began to tell us what these colors were but he said the seven rainbows to the seven colors together make the pillar of fire Hallelujah and in that is the fullness of God that's the word you understand all right so watch this four stages right brother Bram says watch the four stages coming forth what's the four stages of ezekiel's dry bones coming forth in other words he he's he's connecting it God restoring the bride tree and four stages what putting the the the the bark back on right amen putting the leaves back on amen amen and then brother B said what's the third stage putting the fruit back on amen amen but the fourth stage is the fruit on the top of the tree receiving maturity always the fourth stage speaks of adoption maturity Perfection amen amen fullness see GL so then he connects it with the bones of Ezekiel he says that he tells us that there's four stages he says see the bones the S the skin was upon them but when the wind blowed upon them that's when come back the fourth message of life it's a message of life I will restore sayith the Lord when the wind came he says when the wind blew that wind is the fourth stage Hallelujah understand Amen brother what is the message is the sounding of the seventh angel's trumpet and brother Bram said Revelation 107 that when the seventh angel begins to sound the trumpet at the opening of The Seven Seals do you understand that the message he begin to sound the trumpet after that he receiv this anointing glory to God Amen four living creatures represented in here seven spirits of God represented in there but together it's the fullness of the godhead B and he had to receive this to bring the message of life the wind begin to blow out of his mouth hallelujah hallelujah to breathe the Breath of God into the slain to raise up a mighty marching Army an adoped hallelujah hallelujah you see it you see it amen hallelujah hallelujah glory to God because brother after this he said I've never seen this in my life I used to think the white horse rider was the Holy Spirit but when this come amen Satan couldn't hide no more he said wait a minute wait a minute that's the Antichrist hallelujah hallelujah glory to God amen amen he he us to say well you know it's the fruits of the spirit amen but brother when this come he said them Pharisees had more fruits of the spirit than Jesus my amen he says it's the word of the hour being revealed to your soul amen amen and of course you got to carry a life with that of course you got to love you got to have patience you got to have joy you got to have godliness don't take that away now no sir but brother you got to understand that that God would bring an Evidence and Satan would impersonate the evidence and then God would move forward bring another evidence Satan would come up and impersonate the evidence and then he come up speaking in tongues amen and then the Satan came up spoke with tongues too amen until brother bam said come to the word Satan can't become the word he can impersonate love he can impersonate tongues he can impersonate everything but he cannot become the word you got to be seen to become the word glory to God that's the highest evidence there is glory to God amen amen now notice I'm going slowly so we can understand Hallelujah might take a little more time but that's okay we're breaking it down so we can understand brother bam comes in the same message and he tells us the fourth was the message of Life the wind hallelujah hallelujah but you see one wind made out of four right four anointings in the in one wind is the lion didn't Revelations 10 say that in this day a lion roar and seven Thunders amen amen uttered their voices there's that lion power in there amen amen then we see brother bam said that Ox anointing was sacrifice amen amen giving your life for the gospel do you have do you still have to give your life spiritually so you you got to be Anointed with the ox to give your life and die hallelujah hallelujah spiritually see amen amen you and and you got to come with the anointing too amen of the of the man shrewd brother said intelligence of man amen in that age brother they they made dictionaries they made Bibles translations all these things amen great missionaries coming out in that age amen that that anointed is got still alive amen amen and then the eagle power amen a a prophetic anointing amen see the Seer the vision amen amen but all together makes the fullness amen amen can you see that in Jesus Christ all four of them glory to God Amen now notice brother says see look at that the fourth light is to come see justification brought back the P sanctification brought back the B see what brought back the leaf Pentecostals see rejoicing clapping their hands what was the fourth the word itself what is the word the word is God in the beginning was the seven colors all together Hallelujah in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God what's the fourth stage the word itself the word made flesh see Christ has again centered himself like the cap of the pyramid brother what's the Capstone is them seven thund what's the Capstone is Christ himself amen what's the Capstone amen it's Christ see justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and what's the fourth says it right here then the coming of the cap the fourth is the cap amen amen what is it the Holy Ghost Bunch being so honed that it will fit with the same kind of a Ministry he had when he went away son of man see amen son of man before he went away he was son of man when he went away he was Son of God in the Millennium he'll be son of David but in between Son of God Son of David he'll come back again as a son of man to God see and then when he comes back in that form son of man it'll catch the whole thing in the Rapture we're Justified we're Sanctified and we're filled with the baptism of the Holy Spirit the pyramid will stand again the house of God will live again the tree of life is growing again hallelujah hallelujah see that now watch we we see what that fourth stage is it's the it's the Four Winds it's the Breath of God you see that amen hallelujah now watch brother I got to close here because I'm I'm barely going to get into the message Revelation 4 part two and brother reads Ezekiel 1 and he reads about this Whirlwind and that the Whirlwind was a great Cloud amen amen the world wind was a great Cloud Hallelujah and what was it also it was also a fire enfolding itself when he led the children of Israel in the wilderness the same Jehovah would turn into a pillar of fire and he would turn into a cloud by day and the night he would turn like that and then the day he turned like this amen
