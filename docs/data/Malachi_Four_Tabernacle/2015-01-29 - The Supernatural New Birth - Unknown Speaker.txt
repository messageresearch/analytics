========================================
is that you amen you have come back to the place we're not written in the last and prove they do not have a true revelation knowledge of jesus christ now we cannot be baptized becomes part we must be born amen hallelujah so to the predestination right you can confess and confess amen it's got to be hallelujah amen amen now he says in the god of the civil age all right they said in ephesians 2 once dead and trespasses in sin already which is a you say how can she be virgin and still have children well she's bringing forth children for the world but notice she says at least how much more powerful of a deception and your great grandfather you were produced to your grandfather and then to your father and then you know that the bible said in hebrews 7. that when abraham returned from the father when now these messages have been happening i want to emphasize on these things that i have told you in the message of this evening that god said it would come upon the earth the beast was to come upon the earth whose name were not written in the last book of life before the foundation you see people don't even know what the definition of christian is you're saying these christ life yes you say the same thing but you can only be a christian if you got the holy ghost inside your souls amen because he is speaking of something that is not your first person amen that's who he's speaking up that's why because your party this is you're going to get a is five different times single differences why okay it's the spirit of god that is people in your feeling coming down and down a hand handle just as your natural life take your traits made me pay and now we are sitting with him but if you're not seated there you don't have to you don't have it if you're seated there and don't believe it you're not okay and are afraid to move you'll never be the prince and amen he can talk to the church now tonight speak to you the chosen one that he chose before the foundation of the world now for the foundation of the world before that you'd to prepare the hallelujah now this is my church oh this is me so i'm at home now hallelujah amen and put our god to know in the race who's the devil now he's just some stuff to bring children they don't know how good we los angeles really realized we must oh yes a revelation on the scene how could i have chosen no no he chose me hey let's go from me he says amen he chose us in him before the amen only to the predestination only to his thoughts i mean only those that were in him amen chosen in christ in the expressway in the thought express because the fullness because of that this is the reason why amen amen god has said in his word sardis in church age graham explain something here but this is what i want us to see tonight when you when you see amen the grace next hour something that you really are as a person you will always have just a conception of that but you as a person but what so the very fact of who you are in this present life amen by the quickening power of god amen i mean that's why i said to now look what amen says look what he said he says names are going to be blotted out of the book of life no names will be blotted out have and answers on genesis so if you don't have the words until it come comes up is uh do you understand and get the cloud you see in ephesians brought up to heavenly places is through my mistakes what is the holy spirit trying to do where his eternal hallelujah fulfillment didn't make and then teach them some more okay oh hallelujah and that's how when jesus come that's why when jesus comes with a little truth he was born by the incorruptable seed from the mouth of the mouth hallelujah that's why second timothy chapter 2 verse 13 if we believe not yet he abided faithful because he cannot deny himself hallelujah amen but he is one mind and who can turn him and what his soul desires even that he doesn't break i've got this one let me see let me see if we chose you say this for me can he unchoose you okay yes let's go ahead is is and trespasses just think amen how we not even hopefully amen amen the seed of god christ the cell of god have not been broken yet to give life so brother and sister if we were slain in him we were chosen in him amen amen lord of god we were elected in him when he come to the earth 38 hallelujah together foreign hasn't even stopped is is for that age amen he says sometimes he says we joined the church a lot of pretty things in it we try to do pretty ourselves that's good we should but if that's all church means to you and all your yes i'll of a pretty ecclesiastical birth you won't find them amen come on if you find it shown it that it's because of the word another thing is that something in you i would deep comes in and that makes you alive that i say people make you something different if i look i believe in what you want when a new birth comes in of the holy spirit as far as the world is concerned it'll carry on out of you but you come up from there a different purse order the spirit of god a new creature and christ jesus it'll do something to you that i don't what jesus came essence hallelujah they it's that hallelujah in which you are hallelujah amen amen oh my father and only the bride of christ yes yes yes oh this is the message the word is he says you see what i mean if it's spoke by the same thought that will materialize the bible it brings things that was in christ if they become expressions created the world you see what i mean crazy so that same spirit as you can see that said that let there be a letter that was in christ why do we have to be connected to the mind i mean let you say wait a minute he says jesus said have faith in god because he goddamn faith your fairly very i said to you if you say to this about me believe what you say will come to pass what you're saying you shall have it but they're not you should have it but if it becomes a real true revelation hallelujah hallelujah is um oh what's his mind the mind of christ is the spirit of christ amen hallelujah it begins to work he says you have the man of christ when we don't know what he wants to be done with the word we'll try to manufacture something but we're trying to do something or not do something but we have to know that we know that we know notice will become words of the resurrection it's on mankind is so away from their cells they don't see themselves any longer hallelujah hey man whether you got to look at the doctor yes yes he but he was the seed of god and when you come into the mind of christ he couldn't know if we are going to say what god look at the earth from his life what he was you don't have to do against i said that you understand if you know the god of god for your life if you don't and then you won't know what to do anymore see this is the reason why when we look to what his fulfillment is in the word that those things questions to us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit they have not been mixed with faith in them and heard for we which have believed do enter into rest as he says if sworn in my wrath if they shall not they if they shall not if they shall enter to my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world the foundation if he's making a certain place at the day on this lives that god did rest the seventh day from all his works and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest amen see therefore it remained that some enter therein and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief today after so long with time as i said today you shall hear his voice hiding out your hearts and if jesus had given them the rest then would he not afterward have spoken of another day um therefore remains there remaining there for a rest to the people of god for he that is entered into his race yet also ceased from his own works as god did from right now you no longer hide me but christ so it's not your works you understand you cease from your works it's the holy spirit amen quickening the germ the soul and it begins to unfold by the testimony and by the scriptures remember sunday night what did jesus say amen amen john what bear witness to me hallelujah when we say today the sons of god hallelujah he said the scriptures that is born hello
