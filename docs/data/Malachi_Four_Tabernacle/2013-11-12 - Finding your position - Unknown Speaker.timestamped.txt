[46:26] Amen. He has to area of our life. Amen.
[46:31] He has to flee from our family. We
[46:32] claiming that tonight. We're applying
[46:35] the token tonight.

[46:45] tonight. God bless you in the name of
[46:48] Jesus
[46:51] Christ. again
[46:54] a privilege just
[46:58] to be able to speak you to you tonight
[47:02] and Amen. I believe as you just preach
[47:06] with me. Amen.
[47:08] Amen. I believe God has something in
[47:10] store for us. Amen. Revelations chapter
[47:16] 12. Amen.
[47:33] Okay. The
[47:36] antenna going to be reading here in
[47:39] uh from verse
[47:44] 7. Amen.
[47:47] Revelations
[47:50] 12 verse 7. And there was war in
[47:55] heaven. And Michael,
[47:58] Amen. And his angels fought against the
[48:00] dragon, and the dragon fought in his
[48:02] angels, and prevailed not. Neither was
[48:06] their place found anymore in heaven.
[48:10] And the great dragon was cast out, that
[48:12] old serpent called the devil and Satan,
[48:15] which deceived the whole
[48:17] world. Notice the writing of this is
[48:21] showing something, amen, that we know
[48:24] happened before the foundation of the
[48:25] world, but also taking place and is to
[48:28] take place in this last day. Amen. And
[48:31] we see here that by this time he had
[48:35] already deceived the whole world.
[48:36] Brother Brandham said, Amen. in the
[48:40] fourth seal that
[48:41] when Satan comes down, amen, to make
[48:44] himself incarnate in the beast, we go
[48:47] up. Amen.
[48:49] Hallelujah. So, no
[48:53] says, "And I heard a loud voice saying,
[48:56] "In heaven, now is come salvation and
[48:58] strength and the kingdom of our God, the
[49:01] power of his Christ." And the power of
[49:03] his Christ.
[49:05] Amen. For the accuser of our brethren,
[49:11] amen, is cast down, which accused him
[49:15] before our
[49:16] God day and
[49:18] night. And they overcame him. Amen.
[49:22] Didn't say we was defeated. Amen. Glory
[49:25] to God. It said we already overcame him.
[49:29] Amen.
[49:30] Bible's already foretelling.
[49:33] Hallelujah. Is that right? He's already
[49:36] predicting your future. They overcame
[49:39] him. Amen.
[49:41] Brother Bam said when he when the devil
[49:43] points you to your past, you point him
[49:45] to his future. Hallelujah.
[49:48] Amen. He says, "Oh, you was this. You
[49:50] done this." Yeah, that's all right. But
[49:52] God's grace save me now. Amen. But let
[49:56] me point you to your future. Amen. The
[49:58] lake of fire. Glory to God. Total
[50:01] annihilation. Amen. But the sons of God
[50:04] will live eternally. Glory to God. Amen.
[50:08] I've always said this. We We was here
[50:10] before the devil was created and we'll
[50:12] be here after he's gone. Hallelujah.
[50:15] Glory to God. Amen.
[50:17] He's just part of the picture. Amen.
[50:19] He's just part of the great movie of
[50:20] God. Amen. We need him once in a while.
[50:23] Is that right?
[50:27] Amen. To give us a hard time so we can
[50:29] grow.
[50:31] Is that right? If he wouldn't give us a
[50:33] hard time, we wouldn't grow. We'd just
[50:35] be lazy.
[50:37] Amen.
[50:38] We just be spiritual lazies, you know.
[50:42] Amen. But once once he starts getting at
[50:46] us a little, Amen. then we start to get
[50:48] down on our knees. Amen. But brother
[50:51] Bram said, "The weakest Christian down
[50:52] his knees make heaven it makes hell
[50:55] tremble." Amen. Hallelujah. You believe
[50:57] that tonight?
[50:59] Amen.
[51:02] Hallelujah. So they overcame him, right?
[51:05] They weren't defeated. They overcame him
[51:08] by the blood of the lamb. Glory to
[51:11] God. And by the word of their testimony.
[51:13] And they love not their lives unto
[51:18] death. Amen. Let's bow our heads.
[51:21] Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[51:24] come tonight, Lord, with this evening,
[51:28] Lord, in our hearts, oh God, just
[51:31] desiring, Father, more of you, Lord.
[51:35] Lord, more of your revelation, Father,
[51:38] more of your power, oh God, to
[51:42] strengthen us, oh God, and just to
[51:44] refresh us tonight, oh God. Father, may
[51:47] your spirit move freely, Lord. And may
[51:49] your word, Lord, have its effect in your
[51:52] people, Lord. That it would become part
[51:54] of our lives, Lord. Part of our
[51:56] character, part of who we are, Father,
[51:59] because we believe that Elijah will come
[52:02] looking for character in Rebecca,
[52:04] Lord. And Father, we want to we want to
[52:08] have that attribute,
[52:10] Lord, of giving
[52:12] praise, Lord, to the power in which this
[52:16] message came to.
[52:19] We want to have the attribute, Father,
[52:20] of believing, Lord, and that inside of
[52:23] us, oh God, that you've placed there, oh
[52:26] God. So we ask now that you'd come,
[52:28] Father, and quicken your word, Lord.
[52:31] Bless your children, Father. May you
[52:33] bring, oh God, an anointing upon each
[52:35] and every one, Father, that those
[52:38] things, Lord, that perhaps, Lord, uh are
[52:41] are struggling with, Lord, and things in
[52:44] their lives are perhaps just uh uh uh
[52:47] needing something, Lord, from you
[52:49] tonight, Lord. I don't know, Father, but
[52:52] it's in your hands tonight, oh God. and
[52:54] we place ourselves in your hands asking
[52:57] the blessings upon the remainder of the
[52:59] service in the name of the Lord Jesus
[53:01] Christ. Amen. And
[53:04] amen. May be seated.
[53:08] Amen.
[53:10] Amen. Want to speak a little bit tonight
[53:13] about heavenly position.
[53:16] Amen. The heavenly
[53:19] position. Amen. How many love God's
[53:21] word? Amen. Amen. Heavenly position is
[53:26] something that God has Thank you. I
[53:29] forgot mine. Thank
[53:31] you. Heavenly
[53:33] position is something that God has
[53:37] given. Amen. To his children. these
[53:40] things
[53:41] uh we have spoke on there in church and
[53:45] we we've taken you know many services
[53:49] and things but we're just going to try
[53:51] to just hit some things here that I
[53:53] believe would would help us and
[53:55] encourage us. Amen. Cuz we're we're
[53:57] fighting the same devil in San Diego
[53:59] that you fight up here. See that right?
[54:01] He ain't a different devil. Right. It's
[54:03] the same one. Is that right? And that's
[54:05] our target. See that's our that's what
[54:07] we're shooting at. That's what we're
[54:09] aiming at. Amen. Amen. Because God has c
[54:13] called us into this great battle. Amen.
[54:17] And brother Bandham said, "I I call for
[54:19] warriors, Amen, to come stand by me and
[54:22] draw their swords." Amen. To fight,
[54:25] Amen. cut through this line of
[54:27] unbelieving Philistines, Amen.
[54:29] Hallelujah. And bring the the king a
[54:31] fresh drink of water. Amen. Pentecostal
[54:34] water from the well of Bethlehem, he
[54:36] said. Amen.
[54:38] So we understand that in God's
[54:43] economy, he always laotted out
[54:46] positions. Amen. Since heaven, it was
[54:49] always we have the angels and the
[54:51] archangels and the saraphims. There was
[54:53] always a positioning that God did from
[54:57] before the foundation of the world.
[54:59] Amen. And that is to resemble to
[55:01] manifest here on earth. those things
[55:03] have always been and and it doesn't
[55:06] change. Even when the devil and even
[55:08] when uh these angels fail, you know,
[55:11] they still hold ranks. Is that right?
[55:14] Because we see in the days of Daniel
[55:16] that when Gabriel was wanting to bring
[55:20] this message to
[55:21] Daniel, Amen. He said that the prince of
[55:24] Persia would not let him come through
[55:26] and he and he fought for 20 21 days. Is
[55:30] that right? See, so even though Gabriel
[55:33] was an archangel, an angel from heaven,
[55:36] there was still ranks to that dimension.
[55:39] Amen. That even though after these
[55:41] angels had fell, they still hold
[55:44] positions, but they kept not their first
[55:46] estate. Is that right? That's what the
[55:48] Bible
[55:49] says. But God had loted them in a state.
[55:53] He had allotted them a
[55:55] position. But when Michael comes, then
[55:57] things change a little, right?
[56:00] Amen. When Michael shows up, then it's
[56:03] it's a different story. Hallelujah.
[56:06] Is that right? When When Michael shows
[56:09] up, then things start getting done.
[56:11] Amen. Hallelujah. Because Satan don't
[56:14] want revelation to get to you. That's
[56:18] what he's fighting in this hour. If
[56:20] there's one thing that the devil's
[56:22] fighting, he's fighting revelation
[56:26] because that's our foundation and that's
[56:29] our capstone. Amen. Brother Vam said the
[56:32] rapture is a revelation.
[56:36] Hallelujah. Brother Vam said, Amen.
[56:39] Revelation is more important than what
[56:41] you think it is.
[56:43] He said we can never
[56:45] overemphasize on revelation.
[56:50] That's right. We can never
[56:52] overemphasize. And that's what the devil
[56:55] fights. And that's what he was fighting
[56:57] there with Daniel. He didn't want Amen.
[56:59] Daniel to receive the little booklet,
[57:01] you know, 70 weeks. He didn't want him
[57:03] to get that. I'm just messing with you.
[57:07] See? See? Because, you know, Gabriel was
[57:11] coming down with the little book, the
[57:13] Star of David on it. You know, the 70
[57:14] weeks. He was coming down there. see to
[57:18] show them you've you've read it, right?
[57:21] Daniel chapter 8, I believe there was
[57:24] one man,
[57:25] hallelujah. Yes, sir. That scream with a
[57:28] loud voice and told Gabriel, "Show
[57:30] Daniel the vision." Woo! My Show him, I
[57:34] don't want to get into that, but show
[57:35] him who that is.
[57:38] There was There was a There was an
[57:40] angel, Amen.
[57:42] Commanding Gabriel to show Daniel the
[57:44] vision and what it meant.
[57:46] See, so there's
[57:48] ranks. There's ranks. There's always
[57:50] been ranks. Amen.
[57:53] But when God was going to bring down his
[57:57] plan from heaven to earth, we find
[58:01] that in the future home message
[58:04] 1964, Brother Benham
[58:08] says he's speaking of different
[58:11] things concerning the the the new earth
[58:15] and how God's going to annihilate and
[58:17] all these things. You you you've heard
[58:19] it, right? You understand? And he
[58:22] says, he says,
[58:28] "Now, how do you know you're part of the
[58:31] word, the word of the hour promised for
[58:33] this day?" What is it? It's a
[58:35] restoration back to the first
[58:38] day. Back to the first. See, he will
[58:41] restore the hearts of the
[58:43] children back to the fathers. bringing a
[58:46] restoration of the Pentecostal
[58:49] genuine to bring us back into a
[58:53] restoration of
[58:55] position. Now, taking us back to the to
[58:59] to the beginning. Amen. Why? Because
[59:02] when God condescended, he came down and
[59:06] he made Adam. Is that right? And when he
[59:10] when he when he made him, he gave him
[59:13] full authority and
[59:14] control. Amen. I believe that Adam was
[59:18] the prince and the power of the air.
[59:21] Hallelujah. I believe he was the one in
[59:25] control, not only of earth, but in the
[59:28] dimension that he could he could control
[59:32] was a heavenly realm. It was a heavenly
[59:35] position. That's what we want to speak
[59:37] on tonight because I believe that time
[59:40] is here. Amen. And God has showed us how
[59:44] the restoration took place in one man
[59:47] and how he came back to that position.
[59:50] Amen. That male f male man fell from but
[59:55] amen. The first grain of re wheat to
[59:57] reach a maturity so that we could all
[1:00:00] reach maturity so that we could all come
[1:00:03] and take our position. And see that's
[1:00:05] the problem today that the church
[1:00:07] brother Ram said don't know his
[1:00:09] position. Amen. And you see it because
[1:00:13] if somebody wants to take somebody
[1:00:15] else's place or impersonate somebody
[1:00:17] else it shows you they don't know who
[1:00:20] they are or what their calling is or or
[1:00:22] what place they're to be in. Amen.
[1:00:24] Brother Benham said I he said I can't
[1:00:27] take brother Neville's position. Amen.
[1:00:29] And then brother Neville can't take my
[1:00:31] position. So you see today many trying
[1:00:34] to take brother Brad's position. Is that
[1:00:36] right? It shows you they don't know
[1:00:39] their own position because they're
[1:00:41] trying to take somebody else's.
[1:00:43] Is that right? But God gave you a
[1:00:46] position. God gave me a position. Amen.
[1:00:49] And it's not some kind of, you know,
[1:00:51] just any any position. It's a heavenly
[1:00:54] position. Oh my. Is that right? We are
[1:00:58] seated in heavenly places in Christ
[1:01:01] Jesus.
[1:01:03] Amen. We are now the sons of God. Amen.
[1:01:07] We are now in possession of the
[1:01:10] inheritance. Amen.
[1:01:15] See, and this is what we're fighting for
[1:01:19] now
[1:01:21] because he says back to the first day.
[1:01:23] And then he continues to say in the
[1:01:25] future home
[1:01:27] message, he says it's only the
[1:01:31] atmospheres around it and the sin that's
[1:01:35] upon the earth that will be destroyed.
[1:01:38] See, we
[1:01:40] realize that the heavens
[1:01:44] means atmospheres
[1:01:46] above. Now, get that. That's what
[1:01:49] heavens means. Not necessarily you have
[1:01:53] to go way up into the sky. See, this is
[1:01:56] a heavenly
[1:01:58] atmosphere. See, it's it's a heavenly
[1:02:01] place right here. Amen. Brother Bam said
[1:02:03] heaven. They're going to find out one of
[1:02:05] these days that it's not way out there
[1:02:06] somewhere.
[1:02:08] It's right here in another dimension
[1:02:12] faster than this. Amen. So, we got to we
[1:02:16] got to be in that atmosphere. Amen.
[1:02:18] We're creators. Is that right?
[1:02:21] We begin to create that atmosphere
[1:02:23] around it, around our lives, around our
[1:02:26] homes. Amen.
[1:02:30] Now,
[1:02:32] notice that in the
[1:02:35] beginning, the the serpent, the dragon,
[1:02:39] he he came down. Is that right? And he
[1:02:42] he infiltrated himself, got into the
[1:02:45] human race. And we know all about that
[1:02:47] and how that took place. And by God's
[1:02:50] grace, we can see it. Amen. But we see
[1:02:53] that God has shown a pattern through the
[1:02:57] Bible. And that pattern is that when the
[1:03:00] devil
[1:03:01] comes and and and and he he he gets into
[1:03:04] God's program to interrupt it, God has
[1:03:07] something there to bind it. Amen. God
[1:03:11] has something there to to stop it.
[1:03:15] See, so that his work, his will, his
[1:03:18] word could continue. Because when the
[1:03:21] serpent did that in the beginning, God
[1:03:24] himself came down. Amen. And what did he
[1:03:27] do? He he bound the serpent. See, this
[1:03:31] battle began in heaven.
[1:03:35] And in heaven, Amen. Michael and his
[1:03:38] angels fight. Why? Why does the Bible uh
[1:03:42] uh so plainly
[1:03:45] state in the book of
[1:03:48] Isaiah that the the the part that
[1:03:51] Lucifer was fighting for was the sides
[1:03:53] of the north? You ever thought about
[1:03:55] that? Because when Moses was caught up
[1:03:59] in that vision to see the tabernacle in
[1:04:02] heaven, when he came back down, what did
[1:04:04] he do? He positioned everything
[1:04:07] according to what he saw in heaven.
[1:04:10] And on the sides of the north of the
[1:04:12] tabernacle in the wilderness was the
[1:04:15] eagle. We know that. So that was showing
[1:04:18] you that in heaven, Amen. that that
[1:04:22] group, are you understanding me? Amen.
[1:04:25] That people Michael and his angels were
[1:04:28] on the north side.
[1:04:30] And since the devil was trying to take
[1:04:32] over that place, Michael and his angels
[1:04:35] fought against Lucifer and his angels.
[1:04:38] You understand?
[1:04:40] So when that brother said that same
[1:04:42] battle's come now down to down to earth.
[1:04:45] Is that right? And we're fighting this
[1:04:48] battle. But
[1:04:52] notice the dragon hid himself be he has
[1:04:55] hid himself behind mask of
[1:04:57] humanity just like a personation of God
[1:05:00] and
[1:05:01] Morphe. Amen.
[1:05:03] So since she
[1:05:05] fell to the earth in the beginning, he
[1:05:07] introduced himself into the womb of a
[1:05:10] woman representing the
[1:05:12] church. See, and by the
[1:05:15] serpent, but God bound the serpent. He
[1:05:18] came down to Eden in the evening time
[1:05:21] like he would usually do.
[1:05:24] Amen. And and he brought the
[1:05:27] judgment and Cain received the mark of
[1:05:30] the beast. Amen.
[1:05:32] Then from then on, we see how he bound
[1:05:35] the serpent. Brother Adam said of
[1:05:38] speaking of that scripture over in
[1:05:39] Revelations 20 and a mighty angel coming
[1:05:42] down with the chain in his hand to bind
[1:05:44] the serpent. He says it's not a great
[1:05:46] chain. Is that right? What is it that
[1:05:51] binds the devil, the serpent, the
[1:05:54] dragon?
[1:05:58] Circumstances. Circumstances. Is that
[1:06:01] right?
[1:06:03] Circumstances.
[1:06:05] Notice.
[1:06:06] So he cuts off the avenue, the channel,
[1:06:11] the vessel that the devil's
[1:06:13] using. So that puts him in a bind
[1:06:17] because he has no more way of moving
[1:06:19] anymore. He cuts off. See, because of
[1:06:22] circumstances,
[1:06:23] right? So when he come down, he cursed
[1:06:26] the serpent, right? And the curse cut
[1:06:30] off his hands, cut off his legs, brought
[1:06:32] it down. He bound it. He didn't have to
[1:06:35] come down and and grab it. He bound it.
[1:06:38] Amen. By circumstances. So the devil
[1:06:41] moved on into Cain,
[1:06:44] right? You can see the white horse, red
[1:06:47] horse, black horse, and pale in Genesis
[1:06:50] and Exodus. It's right there. Nickelism,
[1:06:54] the serpent speaking to Eve. Amen. white
[1:06:56] horse, red horse, Cain killing Abel.
[1:06:59] Amen. Then you can see the black horse,
[1:07:02] Nimrod bringing the wealth of the world.
[1:07:05] See, you can see it right there. And
[1:07:07] then the death angel in the days of
[1:07:09] Moses. See, coming the pale horse rider.
[1:07:12] It's it's right there. But notice God is
[1:07:16] constantly binding and loosing. See,
[1:07:20] like for
[1:07:22] instance, in the
[1:07:25] days of of Moses, Amen. God bound the
[1:07:30] devil that was working through Pharaoh.
[1:07:32] Amen. He plagged Egypt. He plagged it.
[1:07:35] So these circumstances bound Pharaoh to
[1:07:38] say, "Okay, I'll let the people go." Is
[1:07:41] that right, brother Madam said? Amen. We
[1:07:44] can He Moses, Amen. He he he got uh
[1:07:48] Pharaoh got so tired of Moses. All that
[1:07:50] he was doing, he just finally said,
[1:07:52] "Okay, go ahead and go." Amen. He said,
[1:07:56] "We can do the same
[1:07:57] thing." Amen. Let's get on on Satan's
[1:08:01] nerves tonight. Amen.
[1:08:04] So, you can just say, "Okay, let's I'll
[1:08:05] just let you go. Go in the rapture
[1:08:07] already. Get out of here. I don't want
[1:08:08] you here." See? Amen.
[1:08:12] But
[1:08:14] notice the reason I I say this brother
[1:08:17] is because God has brought that to our
[1:08:20] day. Amen. And you know the vision he
[1:08:23] was told you have been been given power
[1:08:25] to bind him.
[1:08:26] Amen. Is that right? I want to read to
[1:08:30] you a scripture in the book of St.
[1:08:32] Matthew chapter 12.
[1:08:37] We'll hit this here and then we'll
[1:08:38] continue on with this in
[1:08:42] connection. Matthew chapter 12 verse
[1:08:51] 25. Let me see if I got that
[1:08:55] right. Yes. And Jesus knew their
[1:08:58] thoughts and said unto them, "Every
[1:09:00] kingdom divided against itself is
[1:09:02] brought to desolation, and every city or
[1:09:05] house divided against itself shall not
[1:09:06] stand. And if Satan cast out Satan, he
[1:09:09] is divided against himself, how shall
[1:09:11] then his kingdom stand? But if I, by
[1:09:13] beelub cast out devils, by whom do your
[1:09:17] children cast him out?" He he was
[1:09:20] telling them Pharisees, "Now therefore,
[1:09:22] they shall be your judges. But if I cast
[1:09:25] out devils by the spirit of God, then
[1:09:27] the kingdom of God is coming unto you.
[1:09:29] Listen, look at this verse 29
[1:09:32] here. Or else, how can one enter in into
[1:09:36] a strong man's
[1:09:38] house and spoil his
[1:09:41] goods? Notice who he's speaking of. This
[1:09:44] strong man is the devil. That's what
[1:09:47] he's talking about. His kingdom.
[1:09:50] How can a how can one enter into the
[1:09:52] strong man's house and spoil his goods
[1:09:55] except he first
[1:09:58] buying the strong
[1:10:00] man and then he will spoil his house. Oh
[1:10:04] my. What is Jesus
[1:10:07] saying? The reason I'm doing this is
[1:10:10] because by my manifestation on earth,
[1:10:13] Amen. I'm cutting off Satan's
[1:10:15] circumstances. He's been deceiving the
[1:10:18] church so long by these Pharisees and
[1:10:19] all these Sadducees and all these all
[1:10:22] these things. But I've come to bind the
[1:10:24] strong men of the house to do what? To
[1:10:28] spoil. Amen. What is the devil? He's a
[1:10:31] thief. He's a robber.
[1:10:34] Amen. We sing it, right? We come to the
[1:10:36] enemy's camp. Take away what he stole
[1:10:38] from me. But you can't get into his
[1:10:41] house unless he's bound.
[1:10:45] You can't spoil his goods. Amen. Until
[1:10:48] he's bound. But the son of man ministry
[1:10:52] came to bind the serpent. Amen. I'm not
[1:10:55] talking about something future tense
[1:10:57] that will come. Amen. I'm waiting for
[1:10:59] that. Hallelujah. But I'm talking about
[1:11:01] right now.
[1:11:03] I'm talking about he already came. Amen.
[1:11:06] To bind the strong men of the house.
[1:11:10] Glory to God. So that what? so that you
[1:11:12] and I can have the liberty. Amen. To go
[1:11:16] into this strong man's house. Glory to
[1:11:18] God. And perhaps you see, imagine
[1:11:22] this. Someone runs into your house and
[1:11:25] steals all your goods,
[1:11:29] right? And you know where he
[1:11:31] lives. So you take the police, they
[1:11:35] handcuff him, and he tells you, "Go in
[1:11:37] to see what what he what did he get from
[1:11:39] you?" You go in there, you say, "Oh,
[1:11:41] God." Oh, you go in his house. There's
[1:11:45] my prayer life. Oh, I need that
[1:11:47] back. He stole I didn't even know how he
[1:11:50] stole that, but he stole that. I come to
[1:11:52] claim it now.
[1:11:54] Amen. You go over here say, "Oh, he's he
[1:11:57] stole a little of my joy here." Amen. I
[1:12:00] come to claim. Why? Why can you have
[1:12:03] that liberty? I'm telling you tonight,
[1:12:05] you can do that. Amen.
[1:12:08] Glory to God. Why? Because this message,
[1:12:11] amen, came come to bind the serpent.
[1:12:16] Revelations 10:1, a mighty angel coming
[1:12:18] down from heaven with an open book.
[1:12:21] Amen. And he said he sent it down to the
[1:12:24] seventh angel. What for? Amen. To reveal
[1:12:27] it unto his people. What for?
[1:12:30] Amen. To claim our inheritance. To claim
[1:12:34] what belongs to you and me.
[1:12:38] And what did he do when he come down? He
[1:12:40] put one foot on the land and one on the
[1:12:42] sea. He was binding the system of the
[1:12:45] antichrist.
[1:12:48] He was binding the beast that comes out
[1:12:50] of the water and the beast that comes
[1:12:52] out of the sea. Hallelujah to God. Oh
[1:12:55] my. Revelation 17 and Revelation
[1:12:59] 13. One foot on the land, one on the
[1:13:02] sea. What was that?
[1:13:05] He didn't have a chain in his hand. He
[1:13:07] had a book.
[1:13:10] And the book binds the devil.
[1:13:15] Amen.
[1:13:17] So that you and I can run into the
[1:13:20] devil's house tonight and say, "Give me
[1:13:22] back what's mine.
[1:13:25] You stole my family. I'm coming to get
[1:13:28] them." Amen.
[1:13:31] Hallelujah. Amen. Glory to God. I want
[1:13:34] my inheritance. I'm claiming it.
[1:13:37] Hallelujah. I'm standing on the promise
[1:13:39] of God tonight.
[1:13:46] Amen. And then, isn't it
[1:13:49] amazing that Jesus commisss them in Luke
[1:13:52] chapter 10 and he says, "I give you
[1:13:56] power over 1/4 of hell." He didn't say
[1:13:58] that,
[1:14:00] right? Give you power over half of hell.
[1:14:03] You
[1:14:03] know what did he say in Luke chapter 10
[1:14:06] said I give you power over
[1:14:09] all hell
[1:14:15] brother recognize what God's put in your
[1:14:17] hands
[1:14:18] tonight you might say it's just a little
[1:14:20] ox go if it's a ox go shamgard beat 600
[1:14:24] Philistines
[1:14:26] with hallelujah got to be convinced amen
[1:14:30] that you're a son of God be convinced
[1:14:33] God call you to this message for a
[1:14:35] reason.
[1:14:37] Amen. Hallelujah. God's people been beat
[1:14:40] around so much. Amen. It's time to stand
[1:14:42] up and fight back. Amen.
[1:14:45] This is the
[1:14:48] hour. Hallelujah. You believe that
[1:14:51] church tonight? Give the Lord a hand
[1:14:54] clap of praise.
[1:14:57] [Applause]
[1:15:03] Amen.
[1:15:07] Notice when he did this in in
[1:15:15] Eden, he made
[1:15:18] Adam forfeit his position. Is that
[1:15:21] right? He forfeited it.
[1:15:24] See, in other
[1:15:26] words, he
[1:15:28] deceived and pregnantated the
[1:15:32] church and said, "You you want her? You
[1:15:36] really love her." Amen. Forfeit your
[1:15:40] position. Think about this. He was cast
[1:15:42] out of heaven in the beginning. Is that
[1:15:44] right? How did he ever get back up
[1:15:47] there? Someone had to give him a way to
[1:15:50] get back up.
[1:15:53] Is that right?
[1:15:55] And that was
[1:15:56] Adam. Someone had to give him away
[1:15:59] because now he can go before the throne
[1:16:02] and accuse us day and
[1:16:04] night. In the book of Job, he was
[1:16:07] roaming the whole earth and then he
[1:16:08] comes before the throne of God. Why does
[1:16:11] he have
[1:16:13] access? Cuz someone granted him
[1:16:17] access. Do you see what I'm talking
[1:16:20] about? That realm did not does not
[1:16:22] belong to
[1:16:24] Satan. Amen. We're we're going to have
[1:16:27] to vacon it once again so that we can
[1:16:29] meet Christ there. Amen.
[1:16:32] In other words, the devil's just
[1:16:33] occupying the fourth dimension right
[1:16:35] now. Well, we got to cast him down.
[1:16:39] You think, listen to, you think the
[1:16:41] devil is going to come down to the
[1:16:46] earth because he wants
[1:16:50] to or be or or because somebody's
[1:16:52] casting them down like in the
[1:16:55] beginning, he's being forced
[1:16:58] to. See? And guess who's doing it again?
[1:17:01] Michael and his angels.
[1:17:05] Like in the beginning,
[1:17:08] Those two meet one another on the
[1:17:14] battlefield. You see it?
[1:17:17] He's not willfully coming down, brother.
[1:17:20] You and I got to kick him out of there.
[1:17:24] And as he comes down, we're going up.
[1:17:27] You understand what I'm saying? We're
[1:17:29] taking our position. Amen.
[1:17:32] Let think about this. God gave the devil
[1:17:35] a position in heaven.
[1:17:37] that didn't really really belong to him.
[1:17:39] He was God's right-hand man. Is that
[1:17:43] right? But that position had a great
[1:17:45] attribute that he didn't give to the
[1:17:47] devil.
[1:17:49] He couldn't
[1:17:52] create. But he was just filling a
[1:17:55] position.
[1:17:57] Amen. That really didn't belong to him.
[1:18:01] See, that's why brother Bam always say
[1:18:03] he wanted a greater kingdom than
[1:18:04] Michael. greater kingdom than Michael.
[1:18:07] Is that right? Greater kingdom than
[1:18:11] Michael. See, but look at
[1:18:15] this. You fell from that position. Is
[1:18:17] that right? And of
[1:18:21] course, Amen. The position is is
[1:18:25] covered. Amen. See, it's
[1:18:29] covered. But think about this. It's just
[1:18:33] like Judas. You believe Jesus elected
[1:18:38] Judas, right? Naturally, right? Chose 12
[1:18:42] of you. One of you's a devil. He knew
[1:18:45] who he was. Did he know who he was? He
[1:18:48] knew who he was. But
[1:18:51] Judas, w was taking a position that
[1:18:54] really wasn't his. You understand what
[1:18:56] I'm saying? He was using a position,
[1:18:59] amen, that wasn't his. Why do you say
[1:19:01] that, brother Diego? Because he
[1:19:05] fell. Is that
[1:19:07] right? And Acts chapter 1, if you read
[1:19:10] and you know, it says he fell by
[1:19:12] transgression and he returned to his own
[1:19:14] place. Is that what the Bible says? So
[1:19:18] he he went back to his representation,
[1:19:20] right? He fell back to where to where he
[1:19:23] his you know where he come from.
[1:19:28] And then brother Bam said the disciples
[1:19:30] made a mistake. They cast lots. They
[1:19:32] said Matias or right what was the other
[1:19:36] one?
[1:19:37] Forgot. But he said they made a mistake
[1:19:39] because the one they elected never did a
[1:19:44] thing. So that wasn't his position
[1:19:46] either. You understand what I'm
[1:19:49] saying? But whose
[1:19:51] position was Judas taken?
[1:19:55] You understand what I'm saying now,
[1:19:57] right? Amen. But when the pillar of fire
[1:20:00] met Paul, amen, on the road to Damascus.
[1:20:04] Amen. And took him there and Ananas
[1:20:06] prayed for him. He received the Holy
[1:20:08] Ghost. He commissioned him. He He told
[1:20:10] him, "This is your position." Amen.
[1:20:14] Amen. Oh my. You see, Judas was taking a
[1:20:18] position that wasn't his. And Matias
[1:20:21] carnally was taking a position that
[1:20:23] wasn't his. Even elected by the church,
[1:20:26] but it still wasn't his
[1:20:28] position. But when the man that that
[1:20:32] position was for came and manifest, God
[1:20:35] manifested it, and showed Amen. that
[1:20:40] that was his.
[1:20:44] Is that right? And it's the same thing,
[1:20:46] amen, with Michael's position. He sold
[1:20:50] that was his possession.
[1:20:52] Glory to God. God told him, "I've been
[1:20:54] I've already given you power before the
[1:20:58] foundation of the world to bind the
[1:21:00] serpent." Amen. And anything under it.
[1:21:06] Is that right?
[1:21:11] See, and he manifested.
[1:21:15] See, no matter what people would
[1:21:18] say, I got the third pool. I can do
[1:21:21] that. See, but they're trying to take a
[1:21:24] position that's not theirs. You
[1:21:26] understand what I'm saying? But the but
[1:21:29] but the proof is in the pudding there.
[1:21:31] Hallelujah.
[1:21:33] Amen.
[1:21:34] It's there. The vindication is there.
[1:21:38] There's no doubt in my heart. Amen.
[1:21:41] You see, but
[1:21:45] notice brother B didn't brother Bam say
[1:21:48] this look said if you got the Holy Ghost
[1:21:50] inside of
[1:21:56] you. Amen. He said you got the power. It
[1:22:01] is right
[1:22:02] here. Everpresent water from the rock.
[1:22:06] We are now in heavenly
[1:22:08] places. What did he say?
[1:22:11] We are now in the power of the
[1:22:16] resurrection. If there wasn't a law that
[1:22:19] sons and daughters of God would create a
[1:22:21] world out here and go live a private
[1:22:24] life on it, you have power to do
[1:22:27] it. Even if you've got a shadow of the
[1:22:30] power of God in you, you got power to do
[1:22:32] it. God is
[1:22:34] omnipotent.
[1:22:36] See, you ever thought about that?
[1:22:40] You ever thought about that, brother?
[1:22:43] You can do that right here. You can
[1:22:45] create an atmosphere around it. You can
[1:22:47] speak your own world into existence
[1:22:50] right
[1:22:51] here. This this is not craziness now.
[1:22:53] This is this is this is something. Amen.
[1:22:56] No matter where you are, you can be in
[1:22:59] the most craziest part of town, but you
[1:23:01] can be in your own world. Hallelujah.
[1:23:04] Glory to God.
[1:23:06] You can speak your own world into
[1:23:08] existence. your atmosphere around you.
[1:23:10] Amen.
[1:23:12] Glory to God. No matter. Amen. If we're
[1:23:15] in the very house of hell, Amen. And
[1:23:18] create that atmosphere. You can create
[1:23:20] your own world and live in it.
[1:23:22] Hallelujah.
[1:23:23] Amen. You choose what you live in.
[1:23:27] You choose what world you want to live
[1:23:29] in. Amen.
[1:23:31] Hallelujah.
[1:23:33] [Applause]
[1:23:34] You can create your atmosphere. You can
[1:23:36] create your own world and live in that
[1:23:39] world. That's not off of the word in the
[1:23:42] message. Perfect faith. Brother Brandham
[1:23:44] said Jesus lived in a world to himself.
[1:23:49] Amen. 1963 perfect faith. Jesus lived in
[1:23:53] a world to
[1:23:55] himself. He said he was isolated from
[1:23:58] all the world. Brother, that's that's
[1:24:00] his own world right there.
[1:24:03] That's your own world. So you got power
[1:24:06] in you right now to create your own
[1:24:08] world. Hallelujah. And live in that live
[1:24:12] in that
[1:24:13] atmosphere. Amen. Live in that victory.
[1:24:17] Live in that power. Live in that
[1:24:19] uncction.
[1:24:22] Amen. Yes
[1:24:24] sir. Brother Bam said it's done by the
[1:24:27] law of faith.
[1:24:30] You got to believe. Amen.
[1:24:33] But remember
[1:24:38] now, we can ram sack the devil's house
[1:24:41] tonight. Amen.
[1:24:44] Is that right?
[1:24:47] He's done it to us so so too long. Amen.
[1:24:50] But God promises a restoration in us.
[1:24:54] I will restore, sayeth the Lord, all
[1:24:57] that the devil stole from you, you can
[1:24:59] go back in his house and take it back.
[1:25:01] Amen.
[1:25:03] Why? Because he's
[1:25:04] bound. Is that
[1:25:11] right? He said the devil goes up there
[1:25:14] and the first seal he says in the
[1:25:17] fourth and he accuses you. He did this.
[1:25:21] He did that. Remember
[1:25:23] that? But brother said there there's a
[1:25:26] bloody
[1:25:29] sacrifice. Amen.
[1:25:31] an
[1:25:32] advocate. But the father says, "No, he
[1:25:35] did it. There's no record of him."
[1:25:37] Hallelujah. Amen. There's nothing there.
[1:25:40] What are you talking about? But he
[1:25:42] accuses and he accuses day and night.
[1:25:44] But one of these days, brother, his
[1:25:46] accusing is going to be over.
[1:25:51] His accusing is going to be over. Listen
[1:25:53] to this quote. Junction time or the
[1:25:56] junction of time 1956.
[1:26:00] There is people in the world today after
[1:26:02] 2,000 years of gospel preaching that
[1:26:05] don't know what it means to be born
[1:26:08] again of the spirit of God. This is a
[1:26:12] powerful quote. They don't know what
[1:26:15] omnipotence
[1:26:16] means and what that God in his great
[1:26:19] omnipotent power can transform a soul a
[1:26:22] street center to an angelic
[1:26:26] position. Did you hear that? He can
[1:26:29] transform a street sinner to an angelic
[1:26:32] position in God's kingdom.
[1:26:37] That's what it means to be born again.
[1:26:40] Hallelujah. Is to take your place in the
[1:26:43] land. Once you cross over, you got to
[1:26:47] fight to take your place.
[1:26:50] And that's what's taking place in this
[1:26:52] hour. Amen.
[1:26:54] I've heard your your pastor's been
[1:26:56] preaching to you about that. Amen. So,
[1:26:59] you know what I'm talking about, right?
[1:27:02] We're taking the land.
[1:27:04] We're taking our position. Amen. The
[1:27:07] others have went away. The borderline
[1:27:09] believers have they've sold their
[1:27:10] colors. They've crossed the line.
[1:27:13] They've rejected. Amen. The Holy Ghost.
[1:27:16] They've rejected to cross over into the
[1:27:19] new land.
[1:27:21] Brother Bam said, "Do we know what it
[1:27:23] means to crossing over to Jordan?" He
[1:27:25] says, "The opening of the
[1:27:29] seals."
[1:27:33] Amen. But
[1:27:36] notice, Brother Bam said we can't even
[1:27:40] really have
[1:27:41] faith if we don't know what our position
[1:27:44] is, right?
[1:27:47] says we are assembled now in heavenly
[1:27:50] places heavenly it means the position of
[1:27:53] the believer adoption part
[1:27:57] one that means that if I'm prayed up and
[1:28:00] you're prayed up and the church is
[1:28:01] prayed up and we're ready for the
[1:28:03] message when the Holy Ghost
[1:28:06] filled filled with the blessings of God
[1:28:09] called elected set together in heavenly
[1:28:11] places we are heavenly in our souls
[1:28:14] s and our spirits has been has brought
[1:28:18] us into a heavenly atmosphere. Oh,
[1:28:21] brother, there you are. A heavenly
[1:28:25] atmosphere. Oh, what could happen
[1:28:28] tonight? What could happen tonight if we
[1:28:32] would be sitting here in a heavenly
[1:28:33] atmosphere and the Holy Spirit moving
[1:28:35] over every heart that's been regenerated
[1:28:38] and become a new creature in Christ
[1:28:40] Jesus and all sins under the blood. See
[1:28:43] that imperfect worship with our hands up
[1:28:47] to God, our hearts lifted, sitting in
[1:28:50] heavenly places, worshiping
[1:28:53] together. What can happen? He said,
[1:28:55] "Anything is
[1:28:57] possible. Anything is possible." Why?
[1:29:00] Because we're in that we're taking our
[1:29:02] place.
[1:29:04] Amen. Now,
[1:29:07] notice he said that it takes us
[1:29:10] into angelic position.
[1:29:13] Amen. Now, notice
[1:29:16] that when
[1:29:19] Jesus, he commissioned the disciples.
[1:29:23] Amen. I'mma read I'mma read to you here
[1:29:26] a few things.
[1:29:28] Look, he
[1:29:29] says, "Oh
[1:29:40] my Israel and the church number
[1:29:44] four, I believe we're on the borderline
[1:29:47] tonight. I was wondering about all my
[1:29:50] meetings, how I had to cancel them out.
[1:29:52] I truly believe before the church can
[1:29:54] have the rapture has got to have
[1:29:55] rapturing
[1:29:57] faith. We can't even have faith for
[1:30:00] divine healing, let alone rapturing
[1:30:02] faith. Got to have a faith that'll
[1:30:04] quicken, change, and quicken this body
[1:30:06] and be taken away. I believe, listen to
[1:30:10] brother Brand's prophecy
[1:30:12] here predicting. I believe there's a
[1:30:15] church on its road tonight of power of
[1:30:17] the living God that men will speak the
[1:30:20] word here and there and it'll do what?
[1:30:23] Remember the
[1:30:24] quote. It'll
[1:30:26] flash like lightning. Now think about
[1:30:29] that. Keep that in mind. Keep that in
[1:30:32] mind. It'll flash like lightning.
[1:30:36] Amen. Can you say amen tonight?
[1:30:40] Okay.
[1:30:42] Look. Why did brother Bam say, "Amen,
[1:30:45] that men would speak the word and it'll
[1:30:47] flash like
[1:30:48] light." What was he talking
[1:30:50] about? Let's notice Luke chapter 10
[1:30:54] here. Luke 10 verse 18. It
[1:30:59] says 10:18.
[1:31:07] Luke. And he said unto them, I beheld
[1:31:10] Satan as lightning fallen from
[1:31:16] heaven. You with me?
[1:31:19] You with me? I beheld
[1:31:22] Satan as lightning falling from heaven.
[1:31:25] Now, you want to hear what the divine
[1:31:26] interpreter says about
[1:31:29] that? Want to hear what the
[1:31:33] You want to hear You want to hear what
[1:31:35] the divine interpreter says about that
[1:31:38] in the message. Thy
[1:31:41] house
[1:31:43] 1961. Thy
[1:31:45] house. Brother Jimmy reads the next
[1:31:47] question.
[1:31:48] Explain. I beheld Satan as lightning
[1:31:52] falling from
[1:31:53] heaven. Ask him this question.
[1:31:58] I beheld Satan falling from heaven like
[1:32:01] lightning. Now I'm just going to kind of
[1:32:03] outline this. He says if it doesn't if
[1:32:08] it doesn't do it just let me know and
[1:32:10] I'll go into detail. You remember
[1:32:13] now he says that was paragraph E69 thy
[1:32:20] house. That was immediately you can read
[1:32:23] it right here. Immediately after
[1:32:27] Jesus gave his disciples
[1:32:30] power against unclean
[1:32:34] spirits and they went out casting out
[1:32:37] devils and he sent them two by two and
[1:32:38] he said don't go to the Gentiles but
[1:32:40] rather go to the lost sheep of Israel
[1:32:42] and preach the kingdom of heaven heal
[1:32:44] the sick cast out devils and so forth
[1:32:46] and they come back rejoicing happily.
[1:32:50] Now you ask that the question knows
[1:32:53] where where is at and come back happily
[1:32:57] rejoicing. He said rejoice not that your
[1:33:00] that the devils is subject unto you but
[1:33:03] rejoice because your names are written
[1:33:05] in heaven. And he and he said I beheld
[1:33:07] Satan fallen from heaven like lightning.
[1:33:09] See the power of that church. Oh my
[1:33:13] goodness.
[1:33:15] The power of that
[1:33:17] church moving
[1:33:19] forward had just upset the whole kingdom
[1:33:22] of
[1:33:24] Satan. You see, and when he saw him,
[1:33:28] when he saw him, he was dropping from
[1:33:31] his
[1:33:32] places. Satan, brother, that's that's
[1:33:36] the alpha church that did that
[1:33:39] under the alpha ministry. Hallelujah.
[1:33:43] Amen. But we receive the omega ministry.
[1:33:48] He said, "I was an alpha. I am an omega.
[1:33:53] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:33:56] But now the omega church under this
[1:33:58] ministry that has bound the serpent."
[1:34:01] What are we going to do, church? Amen. I
[1:34:04] believe this is the hour that you and I,
[1:34:08] Amen, are upsetting this kingdom of
[1:34:11] Satan. Amen.
[1:34:14] Listen what he says. He
[1:34:15] says he saw him dropping from his places
[1:34:18] because God had to give power to his
[1:34:22] church and he beheld him falling like
[1:34:25] lightning from
[1:34:26] heaven. He was cast plum out of the holy
[1:34:31] places. Hear that? So he's he's
[1:34:36] assurpping.
[1:34:38] Amen. A place. He's a squatter in
[1:34:43] heavenly
[1:34:44] places. You know what that means? Amen.
[1:34:48] That you got to
[1:34:49] cast one of his imps out so that you can
[1:34:52] take your
[1:34:54] place. Judas have to Judas had to fall
[1:34:58] so that Paul could take his.
[1:35:01] Satan had to fall so Michael could take
[1:35:05] his. You understand?
[1:35:08] Glory to God. And we got to fight. Glory
[1:35:10] to God. Amen. Hallelujah. To take our
[1:35:15] position within the land.
[1:35:18] Amen.
[1:35:20] Hallelujah. And where is the land? The
[1:35:22] land's the word. He said the the new
[1:35:25] land, the son of man.
[1:35:28] Hallelujah. So, it's in the word. It's
[1:35:32] in there. And this is what we're doing.
[1:35:35] I believe we're doing it tonight. You
[1:35:36] believe that? Hallelujah.
[1:35:39] Amen. And I believe with your faith.
[1:35:41] Amen. Hallelujah. In God's word, just
[1:35:45] claim it for you.
[1:35:47] Amen. It's your place. It's your
[1:35:49] position. It's your inheritance. What
[1:35:51] God gave you as a son of
[1:35:56] God.
[1:35:58] Amen. So what was So now you know what?
[1:36:01] Why brother Bam said men will speak and
[1:36:04] it'll flash. Now you understand. See why
[1:36:07] why was he saying that? as it was
[1:36:11] scriptural. It all had already happened
[1:36:13] and he was saying it's going to happen
[1:36:15] again. I believe this is the hour.
[1:36:20] I believe this is the hour. You believe
[1:36:22] that? You believe this is the hour.
[1:36:25] We've come to that time. Amen. I
[1:36:27] believe. Hallelujah. How am I going to
[1:36:30] do it, brother? How am I just speak
[1:36:32] God's promise.
[1:36:35] Speak God's word. Amen. They they
[1:36:39] overcame him by the blood of the lamb
[1:36:41] and the
[1:36:44] word of their testimony.
[1:36:47] Amen. You got to confess that God
[1:36:49] already give you the victory. You got to
[1:36:51] confess. Amen. God already give you the
[1:36:54] promise. You got to speak the word and
[1:36:56] create your world own world and live in
[1:36:58] that world.
[1:37:00] And don't take nothing else.
[1:37:03] Hallelujah. Praise God. Glory to God.
[1:37:06] Amen.
[1:37:08] Don't take nothing as the devil says,
[1:37:09] "No, no, no, no. You're a seed of
[1:37:11] Abraham." Amen. You call those things
[1:37:15] that are not as though they were.
[1:37:18] You stand on the promise of God. You
[1:37:21] believe God.
[1:37:23] Amen. This ship of Z's been rocked from
[1:37:26] side to side, but we got to continue on.
[1:37:29] And the anchor's holding on. Hallelujah.
[1:37:34] Yes, sir. Amen. Amen. Glory to God.
[1:37:40] I believe, Amen. When Brother Bam comes
[1:37:43] back on the scene, he's going to find a
[1:37:45] victorious church.
[1:37:49] And I believe he's going to find a
[1:37:51] church in victory. He was waiting for
[1:37:54] this. He says, "I got to wait till this
[1:37:56] catches
[1:37:58] up."
[1:38:00] Amen. Amen. I got to wait, see, till
[1:38:05] this catches
[1:38:06] up and then what you've seen temporarily
[1:38:10] be manifest in the full. I believe that
[1:38:11] with all my heart, brother.
[1:38:14] Hallelujah.
[1:38:16] It's coming, brother. You better believe
[1:38:19] it's coming. It's coming.
[1:38:23] Amen. But he's got to find that church
[1:38:25] in their place. Got to find that church.
[1:38:28] Really? Amen. Hallelujah. Because we
[1:38:32] ain't just playing church tonight. We're
[1:38:33] we're fighting the kingdom of Satan.
[1:38:35] Amen.
[1:38:38] We ain't We ain't come here to play.
[1:38:39] We're fighting this thing. Amen.
[1:38:44] It's it's all out war. It's all out
[1:38:46] battle. But God give us the victory. Is
[1:38:49] that right? Brother Vam said we are his
[1:38:53] victory. Oh my. Glory to God. You say,
[1:38:56] "I need the victory, Lord." He's telling
[1:38:59] you, "Hey, hello. You are my
[1:39:02] victory. You're my victory. Christ in
[1:39:05] mystery God revealed. We are his
[1:39:07] victory. The church is his
[1:39:10] victory. We come forth in the last days
[1:39:12] with the glorious gospel showing his
[1:39:15] victory. He died for this
[1:39:19] purpose. We are proof of his victory.
[1:39:24] When we see him coming down and living
[1:39:27] among the church, that's that's his
[1:39:30] victory. Is that right? And what and
[1:39:34] what does the Bible say in 1 Corinthians
[1:39:35] 15? Death will be swallowed up in
[1:39:39] who? Swallowed up in
[1:39:42] who? There's there's only going to be
[1:39:46] one existing living church. Amen. That's
[1:39:49] going to fulfill that. Is that right?
[1:39:52] And that's victory.
[1:39:55] In one place she said her name's grace.
[1:39:57] You know grace. Grace
[1:39:59] who? Remember that?
[1:40:02] Grace who? Amen. So her name's grace.

[1:40:06] victory. Is that right? Death will be
[1:40:10] swallowed up in victory. You are that
[1:40:15] victory.
[1:40:16] [Applause]
[1:40:18] You are his victory, church.
[1:40:21] You're the reason of his death. You're
[1:40:24] the reason God sent a prophet.
[1:40:26] Hallelujah.
[1:40:28] He said, "If behold, I send you you,
[1:40:30] Elijah the prophet."
[1:40:33] Amen. We are his victory.
[1:40:37] And brother said, God's going to show
[1:40:39] the devil. God of this evil age, he's
[1:40:42] going to prove to the devil that this
[1:40:45] bride ain't like all the others.

[1:41:32] that's a recipient of the ministry of
[1:41:36] brother Brandham when it comes.
[1:41:39] Might as well be you and me. Hallelujah.

[1:42:16] deity is not in heaven. and he said it's
[1:42:18] in you.
[1:42:22] You said to think about it. The God that
[1:42:24] spoke this world into existence, the
[1:42:26] Holy Ghost lives in men and women. It's
[1:42:29] time that you find out who you are. The
[1:42:32] devil's trying to hide you back and tell
[1:42:34] you you're some little tro down
[1:42:35] something. You're not. You're sons and
[1:42:37] daughters of God.

[1:42:45] you got a right. Amen. To come to the
[1:42:48] camp of the enemy tonight and claim
[1:42:51] what's yours. Amen. What's the devil
[1:42:54] stolen from us?
[1:42:56] He doesn't realize, but God beat him to
[1:42:58] the punch in this hour.
[1:43:00] You see, in E in in Eden, Amen. He got
[1:43:05] into the church into Eve, the woman
[1:43:06] first.
[1:43:08] See, but not over here. And Christ is a
[1:43:12] mystery God revealed. Brother Bam says,
[1:43:14] remember that he
[1:43:16] said once that seed of the word is come
[1:43:20] into the womb of the church, he said the
[1:43:22] womb is sealed.

[1:44:00] your time. Amen. The the womb of my
[1:44:03] heart sealed already. Hallelujah.
[1:44:06] Amen. I don't want no other seat. I
[1:44:08] already I got the spoken word. is the
[1:44:11] original seed. Amen.
[1:44:14] Hallelujah.
[1:44:17] Glory to
[1:44:19] God.
[1:44:23] See, brother, this is that
[1:44:25] hour. You believe it? Stand to your feet
[1:44:29] tonight.
[1:44:38] You believe
[1:44:40] it's Michael and his angels
[1:44:46] again taking our place.
[1:44:49] Amen. Fighting for our position,
[1:44:52] heavenly position. What does it mean to
[1:44:55] be born again? What does it mean to have
[1:44:57] that Holy Ghost inside?
[1:45:02] see brings you to a heavenly position.
[1:45:09] Did you know brother Ram said God he he
[1:45:12] wrote the Bible right in the heavens
[1:45:14] first was his first
[1:45:17] Bible and I found that in the
[1:45:21] constellation you know brother Bam said
[1:45:23] it began with Virgo the virgin ended
[1:45:26] with Leo the
[1:45:29] lion but there is actually a
[1:45:31] constellation in the first Bible that's
[1:45:34] called Oias or Ouches
[1:45:39] I was showing with the David with a
[1:45:42] lariat. I got a book
[1:45:45] there, but it's actually a
[1:45:49] man in a constellation
[1:45:53] stars. It's in the constellation of
[1:45:56] Scorpio. See? And he he's
[1:45:59] actually treading a scorpion.
[1:46:03] book, but he's binding a serpent with
[1:46:06] his
[1:46:07] hands. It's called the serpent
[1:46:11] holder. That's it's a constellation in
[1:46:14] the heavens. Now, this is God's first
[1:46:16] Bible. He was already foretelling
[1:46:19] the ministry.
[1:46:22] You have been given power to bind. God
[1:46:24] wrote it in the in the heavens.
[1:46:30] It's already wrote there.
[1:46:34] See what do you do that
[1:46:36] for? So that you and me can have access
[1:46:39] and have have the
[1:46:42] liberty. This is reality, brother and
[1:46:44] sister. Amen. This is real. This is
[1:46:48] something that that that that we got to
[1:46:50] realize God's given us this. Amen.
[1:46:55] And he said he said if if that church
[1:46:58] over
[1:46:59] there I didn't finish reading to you the
[1:47:02] quote in the message thy house but he
[1:47:03] said by the power of the church of them
[1:47:06] having power. Jesus said I give you
[1:47:08] power over unclean spirits and they
[1:47:10] really upset the kingdom of Satan. He
[1:47:13] said what could we do with it
[1:47:16] today? What could we do with it? He
[1:47:19] prophesied. They'll speak and it'll
[1:47:21] flash like lightning.
[1:47:24] Amen. So, what's going to
[1:47:27] force Satan in his kingdom to fully come
[1:47:32] down?
[1:47:35] Amen. Is what's taking place
[1:47:37] now. So, he's coming down. So, the more
[1:47:40] evil you
[1:47:42] see, is is it getting more darker? Is it
[1:47:44] getting more evil?
[1:47:48] It's a bad thing, but it really ain't.
[1:47:50] It's really a good thing.
[1:47:53] You know why? Because they're coming
[1:47:55] down and we're going up.
[1:48:01] It's a good thing. So don't get
[1:48:02] discouraged when you see it's a good
[1:48:04] thing. That means that somebody's
[1:48:06] casting him down.
[1:48:09] Somebody's casting him down. Amen. God's
[1:48:12] bringing us up.
[1:48:15] Amen. Caught up in the mystery of the
[1:48:17] seven seal. Hallelujah.
[1:48:19] We're already caught up in it.
[1:48:22] Amen. We're in heavenly places already.
[1:48:26] Is that right? Brother Adam said, "Amen.
[1:48:29] He's already raptured us." Remember that
[1:48:33] in our souls, he's raptured us into
[1:48:35] heavenly places. Oh
[1:48:38] my. Oh my. Let's raise our hands to God.
[1:48:42] [Music]
[1:48:43] Like he said here in this quote,
[1:48:45] adoption one, he said, "If we lifting
[1:48:47] our hands, we're in heavenly places.
[1:48:51] regenerated by the spirit of God. Amen.
[1:48:56] The son of man ministry come to bind the
[1:48:59] serpent. Amen. To give us access unto
[1:49:02] these things that we can come with full
[1:49:05] authority, full
[1:49:06] confidence.
[1:49:08] Amen. Amen. Ain't nothing going to stop
[1:49:11] this church, brother. Ain't nothing
[1:49:13] going to stop the power of God's word
[1:49:17] moving. All hell can upset it. Amen.
[1:49:21] Like we were singing earlier, brother
[1:49:23] Ralph singing amen. We're Satan. We're
[1:49:26] tearing your kingdom down. We actually
[1:49:29] are, brother. We're not just singing
[1:49:30] [Music]
[1:49:32] that. We're tearing his kingdom
[1:49:37] down. You know why? Oh, glory to
[1:49:41] God. Because the same group that cast
[1:49:45] them out of heaven is the same group.
[1:49:47] Amen.
[1:49:51] the same group that'll cast them out
[1:49:53] now.
[1:49:56] And that's that's Michael and his
[1:49:59] [Music]
[1:50:01] angels that resisted the devil's lie.
[1:50:07] Amen. They asked him, "Is there is there
[1:50:10] an Irishman in heaven?" He says, "Yes,
[1:50:12] there's one. There's an Irishman. That's
[1:50:15] Michael." He
[1:50:16] said, "You know, Irish men, they're
[1:50:18] known for good fighting. They like to
[1:50:20] fight, you
[1:50:22] know." Amen. But he said, "I'm fighting
[1:50:25] another opponent now. It's the devil."
[1:50:29] Amen. We're fighting the same one
[1:50:31] tonight. The same group. Glory to God.
[1:50:34] Think about that tonight. It's already
[1:50:37] wrote in heaven. It's already wrote in
[1:50:39] the
[1:50:40] Bible. It's already wrote in your heart.
[1:50:42] You just got to believe it.
[1:50:45] The same group that cast them out of
[1:50:47] over there, the same group that's
[1:50:50] casting them down now. Then the Bible
[1:50:52] say cast down reasoning,
[1:50:56] vain imaginations, cast them down,
[1:51:00] pulling down the strongholds of Satan.
[1:51:03] That what the Bible says. God has given
[1:51:06] us weapons, amen, that are not carnal,
[1:51:09] but they're mighty in God.
[1:51:12] They're mighty, brother. God's giving
[1:51:14] you something tonight. Like I said
[1:51:16] earlier, if it's an ax gold, amen, if
[1:51:19] it's just a stone like David, whatever
[1:51:21] it is, whatever you got. Amen.
[1:51:25] Let's swing it at the devil
[1:51:27] tonight. Whatever God give you, you say,
[1:51:30] "Brother, I just know a little that."
[1:51:32] Use that.
[1:51:34] [Applause]
[1:51:36] Oh, I'm I'm weak.
[1:51:38] Use whatever you got,
[1:51:41] brother. Because the power ain't in you
[1:51:43] and me anyway. It comes from him.
[1:51:48] Amen. Glory to
[1:51:50] God.
[1:51:52] Hallelujah. Yes,
[1:51:54] sir. Amen. What God give you? Think
[1:51:57] about it. Did God give you
[1:52:00] something? Are you grateful for
[1:52:04] it? Oh my. What a privileged people.
[1:52:07] Brother, sister, he said this church
[1:52:11] will be an invincible army.
[1:52:14] [Applause]
[1:52:16] An invincible
[1:52:17] [Music]
[1:52:18] [Applause]
[1:52:19] army.
[1:52:20] Hallelujah. Why are we invincible?
[1:52:23] Because the story's already been told.
[1:52:27] Hallelujah. Amen. And they overcame
[1:52:32] him. We're casting down the accuser, the
[1:52:35] brother. We're tearing the kingdom of
[1:52:38] Satan down.
[1:52:41] Amen. This is the hour. This is the
[1:52:43] time.
[1:52:45] Amen. Just realize that and keep it in
[1:52:47] your heart. Whatever you do, if you
[1:52:50] remember something tonight, keep that in
[1:52:52] your
[1:52:54] heart. Heavenly
[1:52:56] Father, oh God,
[1:53:00] tonight the battle is raging. Oh
[1:53:04] God, many soldiers,
[1:53:08] Lord, have been wounded in war,
[1:53:12] Father. And your calling, Lord,
[1:53:16] for this generation to raise up,
[1:53:21] Lord, with all that you've given us,
[1:53:23] Lord, is more than enough,
[1:53:25] Father. Oh, God.
[1:53:31] And you
[1:53:32] told the disciples,
[1:53:36] Lord, when
[1:53:38] Peter
[1:53:41] received the
[1:53:45] revelation of the son of
[1:53:49] man. He said, "I give you the keys to
[1:53:51] the kingdom." Hallelujah. Whatever you
[1:53:54] bind on
[1:53:55] earth, I'll bind in heaven. Lord, we can
[1:53:59] bind tonight.
[1:54:00] [Music]
[1:54:04] Hallelujah. His circumstances can be
[1:54:07] cut.
[1:54:09] Amen. Oh God, we got a promise in this
[1:54:12] hour, Father, that you've given
[1:54:14] us. And we remind you tonight of your
[1:54:17] promise, Lord. You said there would be a
[1:54:19] church, Lord, that would speak the word
[1:54:21] and flash like lightning.
[1:54:25] And when you was here manifested in
[1:54:27] flesh 2,000 years ago, you gave that
[1:54:29] power to your church, Lord, and you come
[1:54:32] to reveal the son of man, and you bound
[1:54:34] that serpent, then that strong man of
[1:54:36] the house. But when you bound them,
[1:54:39] Lord, the church went forth and cast out
[1:54:41] devils, Lord, and brought down the
[1:54:43] kingdom of
[1:54:45] Satan. Oh
[1:54:47] God, no wonder Paul said in the word,
[1:54:50] you've brought us onto Mount Zion.
[1:54:52] Hallelujah.
[1:54:54] innumerable company of angels, the new
[1:54:56] Jerusalem, the heavenly
[1:54:59] places, Lord. But that has come in this
[1:55:02] hour, Father. And we're here. We're
[1:55:04] living in it, Lord. God, let us realize
[1:55:06] it, Lord. Let us believe it, Father,
[1:55:09] with all that's in
[1:55:10] us. Lord, I pray tonight, Lord. any
[1:55:14] hindrance Lord of the
[1:55:16] enemy, anything Lord that the devil is
[1:55:20] trying to hold against your children,
[1:55:22] Father, we cast it down in the name of
[1:55:24] Jesus Christ. And I declare them
[1:55:29] free,
[1:55:32] healed, oh God, it's your word, Father,
[1:55:36] and we believe it
[1:55:39] tonight. Oh, thank you, Lord God.
[1:55:44] Thank you for this great victory of the
[1:55:46] hour,
[1:55:47] Lord. The war is already won.
[1:55:53] Hallelujah. Oh, victory is
[1:55:57] ours. We're claiming the victory
[1:55:59] tonight,
[1:56:01] Father. Oh, it's ours for the claimment.
[1:56:05] Amen. Oh, we thank you, oh God. In the
[1:56:08] name of Jesus Christ, Father, send forth
[1:56:12] a refresh in the hearts of your
[1:56:13] children,
[1:56:14] Lord. May the power surge upon them, oh
[1:56:20] God. May they come forth, Lord, with new
[1:56:24] strength,
[1:56:26] Lord, with
[1:56:28] courage to continue to fight this
[1:56:31] battle.
[1:56:32] Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ, oh
[1:56:35] God, we cast Satan down. Father, any
[1:56:38] reasoning, any
[1:56:40] doubt, anything, Lord, in the mind where
[1:56:43] the battlefield is, we cast it down in
[1:56:46] the name of Jesus
[1:56:48] Christ. We cast it down by your word,
[1:56:51] Lord. We cast it down by faith, oh God.
[1:56:56] In the name of Jesus Christ, Lord, may
[1:56:59] victory set in Lord
[1:57:03] God. Oh, thank you,
[1:57:06] Jesus. In the name of Jesus Christ. And

[1:57:12] it tonight? Praise the Lord. God bless
[1:57:15] you. Amen, brother
[1:57:16] Ralph.
