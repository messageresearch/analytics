TRANSCRIPT
========================================
enter into these things as quickly as possible if you would help me again it's good to see our brother uh i know the devil was really fighting him to be in tucson to be in tucson and uh but he was able to be there anyways that was the thing that he regretted in his life was not served younger and you know he started pastoring about 18 years old so how much younger when he wanted and you'll see why we read genesis we want to speak this morning we're in the same we're in the same line amen of this of this tremendous subject that we've been on and how it's been combining amen how this mystery of christ christ desperation and how when that takes place is and then he begins that body grows from the feet and grows all the all that was it's the holy ghost people's hands from was cast shall be cast down can we get into those seals when jesus paid for it oh it actually got worse and it's getting worse yeah that's satan billiards hallelujah so is this is remember yes spiritual it's going that's why the resurrection yes sir get on that trail hey man the prophet the prophet said you have to be ordained get hallelujah now listen to his verse 31 jesus here saint john 6 our fathers delete man in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from heaven our fathers delete manna in the desert listen then jesus said unto them verily verily i say to you moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread for men for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world moses gave you not that bread from him is that right because why okay your father's ate amen i mean but the bread that my father gave sir if moses would give you the bread but he didn't give you that breath he gave you physical manner which is called angel's food and foreign this is a bread which come down from heaven that a man eat is that right what do we read in genesis 3. foreign yes hallelujah not one more person coming in yeah but i'm telling you right now the way it's open the the door is open straight is the gate is down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live forever amen the bread that i will give listen is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world me the jews therefore strong among themselves saying how can this man give us the unfailing body word the son of man that's a quote from the realm you know the message he said feeding then jesus said unto them very very i said you accept you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his is and i will raise him up oh my glory amen have sent me and i live by the father so he that what how does jesus live oh yeah jesus how does jesus live oh yeah this is the bread that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did he banner and are dead he that is of this bread shall live forever bread you live forever these things said he in the synagogue as he taught in capernaum all many therefore of his disciples when they had heard this said this is a hard saying who can hear it jesus knowing himself at his disciples murmured that and he said unto them what if he shall see the son of man were created they still remain yes his own glorious body all of a sudden yes happening on the earth see what i'm saying is this is what we're feeding on the flesh prophet is nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit they are right he wasn't looking at flesh he was looking at the beginning of the creation of and he said eleko the very first chapter sovereign times pass manners he speak to the father but in these last days and you say okay yeah he's talking about the body which to me as they will be not me commission me because i owe you a baby in different forms i've seen a rainbow pillar of fire angel yeah is oh yeah he says i'll give you this bread god had to become flesh a new creation human race the whole cuban race hallelujah was kinsmen redeemer that through the new blood the token in human flesh a new creation jesus christ the flesh i don't drink my blood what is yes hallelujah that's very paul preach the cross is that right i mean he met the pillar of fire we wrote the new testament amen same thing in the shop brother branham preached this coming of the lord this crucifixion amen i mean but you can't have this what about that this is the climax this isn't it see paul was preaching about jesus coming dying for us he paid the price has come hallelujah the same thing that jesus said and saint john 6 is the same thing the holy spirit is saying today to the pride hall of yours oh that's not how jesus taught us to eat okay amen you eat only by revelations to is yes see and she came to her husband you think there's contradiction in the message foreign is the knowledge no contradictions in the beginning he said you shall he slammed it yes god didn't want you to feel nothing you would make your wrath and it made you wrong it made you feel okay yes great i believe children what i think is it i'm gonna love the lord so it was all in him we were chosen in him but for the foundation of the world so in adam we die in christ yes amena that was in yes that was the birth of giving this uh as a little teaching here we're gonna get we're gonna hit some parts and if you're really in in line this morning oh brother they should strike deep into their souls i give the eat of the tree of god which is in the midst of god amen i'm not talking about you gotta buy an airplane ticket to go through this paradise amen it's not geography we foreign is hallelujah please ye no man after the flesh yeah though we have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know him no more that's why what is our subject today feeding on the unfailing body no more knowing him after the therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature all things are passed away behold all things and all things are of god who have reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and have given to us the ministry of reconciliation with that god was in christ reconciling the world and unto himself and repeating their trespasses upon them and have committed to us the words of reconciliation reconciliant you believe in that the same yes because in him was to be fulfilled the same ministry of the son of man everything the same only one except the purple body doesn't make him jesus christ that's a ministry for me to reveal the word again we're and this message has done the same thing i've brought it to you many quotes hey man i mean but sometimes the level of what we're receiving it it's not as looking at it in the same pattern over here i have this and then this and over here this and then this it says we don't look at it like that we just look at it like another quote amen i mean maybe they're anointed with that same spirit speech oh did less and we do this and we do that hallelujah hallelujah all they have is wow it's all in in iran how many how many know the brother on the tape that you hear saying hallelujah foreign but i don't is that's a is i got a little piece of this that's the rest of that game yes all the people that were with brother brown what was yours that's good you see what i'm saying that's good i like to hear i mean i heard billy paul and then because of that because they only knew him after the flesh they didn't really know him by revelation what they talked about the way they saw the brother foreign revelation build it upon hallelujah we've got more of a revelation than you paulo oh now you can't oh yes amen express himself in the pillar of fights because that's not right forever paul being the truth he receives a revelation by his experience he received a revelation your experience listening yesterday today he is that oh he'll make because he knows hallelujah that's what i said it might be strong for some questions there's many that know him only after the flesh i know i'm after this that's not i that is himself amen he says amen do you see it expressed by the word itself through jesus christ you can that means is has what hallelujah of oh if you can hear hallelujah and i am hallelujah for your he's already paid to eden is there a guess right there that's where the fullness of the word the fullness of the god is in that place is sometimes i feel like i'm saying things it's just just questions and answers questions 1964 there's quite a difference i believe jesus christ was the son of man the son of god the son of man the same thing i am not the anointed son of man but i say that sometimes because i want you to give it unless amen so the pillar of fire is what if it was king what is the pillar of fire an attribute of the fullness when the right hand means power through but now he's bottled and confined in the whole universal church of the living he is unless he knew it was the same logos himself now in the last day the lowest that was upon jesus has become from a back to the pillar of fire and has descended down on the earth you see the son of david he saw the son of man that's why we have to see what is the revelation in this hour right now i would have are we feeding on the son of man on the son of god i don't mean to be tricky but i'm just saying it's true we're feeding on the unfailing body word of man when john saw him said is this is something else this is hallelujah what i'm saying on upon jesus like an investigation that's why jesus knew exactly what he was saying he wasn't just in another mystical body today this is this is in jesus name it is yes is amen oh my are you doing what he says now this great pillar of fire is going to live without absolutely identified even scientific cameras i believe it's still there isn't it like that yes it's still there scientifically proven by the best we got george j lacy head of the fbi foreign jesus until it has come to be the hedge of man the son of god the son of david i am the rose of sharon the lily of the valley the morning star is do you understand be signing amen what are we reading saint john 6. i live in him do you want it in me he didn't mean in the very day the son of man is revealed is not the son of man himself but the seventh angel the seventh messenger is revealing to the public the son of man because it's left the shock you can't i wanted i was only standing there is a lot of times he didn't even know what he was saying it was i was just surrendering myself he spoke through it it wasn't me it wasn't the seventh angel he this time amen why was he the son of man so he was known as the the son of man the great prophet who in himself gathered together the his leadership again yes they will those dead in christ because when they will receive those things after they are raised up this is a living bride receiving these things in the spiritual he is oh hallelujah revelation at this time amen they receive their abortion yes amen they receive the words for their pain but we receive the word for their days and all that they didn't know gives us the morning star has he changed our arraignment i'm gonna understand let's heal are we closing white brain can he take our names out of the book of life all these promises to the overcomers amen are we a pillar in the temple of god amen yes sir are you preparing his name no number did he write it on us sitting on the throne with him as he is overcome when i didn't see him and he sit on his father's throat to be revealed again but it's still the second fourth oh hallelujah is the
