[15:56] that's you
[15:58] working
[16:01] I've had this for a while
[16:04] credit here
[16:07] really shows what a pasture
[16:11] the pastor's lot is about like a
[16:14] shepherd block he leads his sheep from
[16:17] day to day
[16:19] they know every Pitfall along the way he
[16:22] leads them through the valleys and the
[16:24] pastures green he guides him to the
[16:27] water of life-giving stream he knows the
[16:30] enemies of every attack
[16:33] he goes after The Lost Ones to bring him
[16:35] back the pastor of our church does the
[16:38] very same thing
[16:40] he guides us to God's life getting free
[16:43] he prepares us for the
[16:46] attack
[16:47] in the time of trouble he yells go back
[16:50] go back go back to the beginning of
[16:52] everything go back to the foundation
[16:55] that Paul did bring
[16:57] come to God's word and you will hear him
[16:59] say
[17:00] come to his light it will show you the
[17:04] way
[17:04] from the pulpit you can hear the pastor
[17:07] cry out danger ahead look out look out
[17:11] These are times when he thinks he stands
[17:14] alone he is the tool God uses to shape
[17:17] us into Lively stones
[17:19] he has chosen by God before the world
[17:23] began
[17:24] preach to us redemption's plan
[17:27] no thanks for man does he seek for his
[17:30] work
[17:31] for the love of God he does toil and
[17:33] work
[17:35] and when his people are sick
[17:37] he is always there
[17:39] to offer up to God's supplication and
[17:42] prayer
[17:43] he knows when we are weak and we are
[17:46] strong he knows
[17:48] when we're troubled or something is
[17:51] wrong
[17:52] God give him something special
[17:54] to know these things and to lead us to
[17:57] God's pastors ever so green
[18:00] he is the head of the local church body
[18:02] to us
[18:03] he tells us only in God's word to place
[18:06] your trust
[18:07] the devil hates him this I must say
[18:11] he doesn't want you to hear what your
[18:13] pastor would say
[18:14] he is out to get him at every turn of
[18:17] the way
[18:18] for your pastor and his family should
[18:21] always pray a good pastor is one of a

[46:20] time that we're living Father for I

[46:24] real battle
[46:25] Lord God is not against flesh and blood
[46:28] as you've told us in your word
[46:30] but oh God it's against powers and
[46:33] principalities oh God where your
[46:35] prophets said that all hell's been let
[46:38] loose oh God
[46:40] and 200 million demons are let loose
[46:42] against the bride under the seventh seal
[46:44] Lord

[47:04] and you said father when the enemy would
[47:07] come in like a flood that you would
[47:09] raise up a standard against it Lord
[47:11] and we believe Lord this message this
[47:14] word of the hour to be the standard that
[47:16] we are to lift up oh God
[47:18] and we ask so God that you would come
[47:20] and help me this morning Father may you
[47:23] may you help me Father anoint me oh God
[47:25] to speak your word to your children
[47:27] and may you anoint to hear also Father

[47:35] ask
[47:36] amen if I could get he may be seen if I
[47:39] could just a little more volume up here
[47:41] on the monitor is that okay
[47:43] man I'm trying to
[47:45] try and watch my voice hear how to do
[47:48] infection and
[47:50] we've been struggling a little with that
[47:51] but
[47:53] amen we're
[47:55] trusting in Him to help us amen
[47:57] now the revelation of the Blue Ribbon
[47:59] amen
[48:01] I don't know you know of
[48:05] I don't I don't want to be too long and
[48:08] you all wore out and we don't know what
[48:10] God might do this evening amen but
[48:14] uh
[48:17] we'll just go as
[48:19] as the Lord would lead us amen because
[48:22] this is a pretty
[48:24] extensive thing we have here
[48:26] by God's grace we just want to bring it
[48:29] out to you may it be a help here in the
[48:32] Book of Numbers
[48:34] chapter 15 amen as we see that God is
[48:37] speaking
[48:38] to The Exodus people
[48:41] he is speaking to those who have been
[48:43] called out by the message of a prophet
[48:45] amen he's not speaking to the Nations or
[48:48] the other kingdoms or the other people
[48:50] of other of other of other nations amen
[48:53] he is speaking to in a called out people
[48:57] you're speaking to somebody amen that is
[49:01] seeing the Vindication of God for their
[49:03] hour that the Deliverance of God had
[49:05] come and he'd promised what he told
[49:08] Abraham that they would be delivered
[49:10] amen
[49:12] after 400 years and
[49:15] what what the mighty and strong powerful
[49:18] arm amen and the arm of the Lord would
[49:21] be revealed in that hour amen the
[49:23] strength of power of the Lord to deliver
[49:26] them and bring them out amen
[49:28] and this is the people that he's talking
[49:31] to amen and I believe that we are that
[49:35] people in this hour we are the people
[49:37] that's been called out amen by this
[49:39] message we are the people that has
[49:41] received a Vindicated prophet of God
[49:44] Amen that came with thus saith the Lord
[49:47] to tell these denominations let them go
[49:50] amen just like he told Pharaoh let my
[49:54] people go amen we receive a message in
[49:57] this hour and a prophet amen with the
[49:59] same signs of Moses
[50:01] and if you notice Amen in the time of
[50:05] Deliverance he was speaking things into
[50:07] existence Hallelujah he was he was
[50:10] bringing the word of God but in order
[50:12] for this uh Deliverance to come amen
[50:15] there was the power of the spoken word
[50:18] and I believe that's what sets us free
[50:20] in this hour amen that power the spoken
[50:23] word amen and we've seen in our day that
[50:27] he could take he could create something
[50:29] out of nothing amen
[50:32] and this is who he's speaking to here in
[50:34] the scripture this is who he's he's
[50:37] speaking to in here in numbers 15.
[50:40] but if you notice something you know God
[50:42] had a hard time
[50:44] with the children of Israel is that
[50:46] right senator
[50:48] he he had a real hard time amen because
[50:52] you know they they they murmured they
[50:55] complain they saw the works of God
[50:58] they saw the power of God they seen what
[51:01] God could do for them amen and that God
[51:04] had promised not just to bring them out
[51:06] but to take him in amen because
[51:08] Redemption as brother Madam said is in
[51:10] two parts amen
[51:12] he has brought us out of Darkness to
[51:14] bring us into his marvelous life
[51:17] amen that's what he's bringing us into
[51:19] in this hour that's where we that's
[51:21] where we are amen
[51:24] amen but
[51:26] notice here
[51:30] he he's giving the people laws amen this
[51:34] is
[51:35] after the fact that God had come down
[51:37] upon a mountain if you're with me this
[51:39] morning
[51:41] he had already come down upon a mountain
[51:43] in a thick Cloud amen
[51:45] laughs amen
[51:49] and Moses was the only one that was
[51:51] caught up into that cloud Hallelujah
[51:54] favorite
[51:56] and he received something in that cloud
[51:58] amen
[52:00] and he came back down from the cloud
[52:02] amen
[52:04] Hallelujah and he said this is The
[52:07] Testament Hallelujah Oh Glory to God
[52:12] and then there was shedding of blood and
[52:15] all these things amen for the tester
[52:21] but notice those things had had taken
[52:24] place already and
[52:26] yet the people of God
[52:30] God is seeing something in the people
[52:34] he is seeing that there's some that sin
[52:37] ignorantly
[52:39] you're seeing that others
[52:41] sin presumptuously or willfully amen
[52:45] but now notice
[52:46] he's he's going to make a provision for
[52:49] them
[52:50] he's gonna he's gonna show him Grace
[52:52] during the time that he's given law and
[52:54] judgment
[52:55] because you know brother Madam said when
[52:57] God came down in Exodus 19. in that
[53:02] cloud he said that was judgment amen
[53:04] because God has showed them grace and
[53:07] grace had brought them out Grace said
[53:09] send them a prophet the pillar of fire
[53:11] amen what's leading them but yet they
[53:14] chose law brother bam said
[53:16] and here in Exodus 19 amen when brother
[53:19] Madden preaches Revelations 4 he
[53:22] preaches a throne of mercy and of
[53:24] judgment
[53:25] and he takes it back to Exodus 19 to
[53:28] show us
[53:28] what happened in our day and in our hour
[53:31] we're not talking about a historical God
[53:33] this morning we're talking about the
[53:35] great idea
[53:37] we're talking about what all these
[53:39] scriptures all these Prophecies of the
[53:42] Bible brother Adam said they all became
[53:44] new
[53:45] when the shields were open you believe
[53:47] that
[53:49] you believe this Bible is a new Bible
[53:51] amen this Bible has become new
[53:54] Hallelujah now it's not history anymore
[53:57] it's not just stories anymore it's not
[54:00] just some little children's story amen
[54:02] it's prophecy
[54:04] being fulfilled in our hour that was
[54:07] foretelling something amen
[54:09] every scripture
[54:11] of the Bible
[54:14] and that's what we see here
[54:17] that
[54:18] this was a prophecy this was something
[54:21] to show us that in the time that God has
[54:24] come down in judgment amen
[54:27] he's gonna he shows Grace into his
[54:29] people
[54:31] now think about this
[54:37] there's two sins that he that that he's
[54:40] speaking of here and in numbers 15 you
[54:43] can read if if you want to study it from
[54:46] about verse 22
[54:48] he's bringing the Commandments to the
[54:50] priests and to the people concerning
[54:52] their sins
[54:54] done in ignorance and sins made by
[54:56] presuming amen
[54:58] no brother Madam said to presume
[55:01] is to venture
[55:03] without actual Authority
[55:06] or he said this is what he also said
[55:08] about pursuing he said or it's to take
[55:11] it for granted
[55:15] see they had taken it for granted
[55:18] and that's what happens sometimes with
[55:20] us amen we take it for granted that God
[55:22] sent us the most powerful message
[55:25] amen we take it for granted that God
[55:28] Vindicated with the pillar of fire
[55:30] Hallelujah
[55:31] we take it for granted but God is still
[55:34] showing grace to the people
[55:36] amen this is amazing because
[55:39] brother Adam said this is an hour many
[55:42] are presuming
[55:44] many presume in their ways they presume
[55:48] he said ministers preach Doctrine amen
[55:51] of their denomination presuming
[55:55] and the message presumably 1962 that
[55:57] they're doing exactly what's right
[56:00] many of them no matter how contrary it
[56:02] is to the scripture
[56:03] they presume
[56:05] they're doing right when they preach
[56:07] that Doctrine see
[56:10] they think it's right but whether it be
[56:12] right or not they're pursuing
[56:14] that is just what God requires
[56:17] a certain Creed or a certain affiliation
[56:20] you get me
[56:22] they think that's all that just God
[56:24] requires they presume
[56:26] that they're taking people to Heaven by
[56:28] just joining Church
[56:30] and preaching the Creed
[56:32] see they're presuming
[56:34] and that's what is being done that's all
[56:38] you have to do but what a mistake that
[56:41] is it's a terrible mistake
[56:43] of presuming
[56:45] see
[56:46] and then God said those who sin that way
[56:50] they'll be cut off from among the people
[56:52] amen is that we read here in the
[56:54] scripture but now notice he said for
[56:57] those who sin ignorantly
[56:59] amen there'll be an atonement for them
[57:02] there'll be a sacrifice for the you
[57:03] believe that you believe there's still
[57:05] Grace amen you believe God is still amen
[57:09] interceding for his children
[57:12] and we could call upon the name of the
[57:14] Lord when we make a mistake many we we
[57:17] all make mistakes we all do things
[57:19] sometimes ignorantly and sometimes
[57:22] presumptuously is that right
[57:25] but yet God shows Grace to us hallelujah
[57:28] something to hold us something to keep
[57:32] us Amen brother Madam said this is a
[57:35] time where Christians and many people in
[57:38] churches and ministers don't know where
[57:40] they stand
[57:42] they're all wishy-washy amen
[57:45] he said there's no more Backbone in
[57:48] Christianity that's just jellyfish amen
[57:51] one day their bride next day their
[57:53] foolish virgin and next day they're just
[57:57] Chad and father you know
[58:00] is that right there's no stableness
[58:02] brother Adam said amen we gotta put
[58:05] these stabilizers on the on the ship of
[58:08] Zion amen
[58:09] Hallelujah stabilize ourselves in the
[58:13] word of God Amen
[58:15] amen this is what God has brought us
[58:17] amen a blue ribbon Amen to show us Grace
[58:22] because I can't do it brother
[58:25] amen and God seeing
[58:28] God see that his people weren't going to
[58:32] be able to fulfill this
[58:35] there was no one ever able to fulfill
[58:38] the law is that right
[58:41] he knew he is seeing their their
[58:43] vulnerable
[58:46] amen
[58:48] he knows
[58:51] these things he knows our challenges
[58:55] he knows what we're facing amen
[58:58] he knows
[59:00] what what time we're living in this is
[59:03] the most evil and darkest time there's
[59:05] ever existed
[59:07] and the children of Israel they they
[59:09] weren't facing things we're facing today
[59:11] Brother David
[59:13] is that right
[59:17] no no now it's multiplied
[59:21] sin and filth of this modern world
[59:26] how much more
[59:27] do we need
[59:29] a blue ribbon in this hour
[59:31] to look to amen
[59:34] to look to so that it would remind us
[59:37] now get that there
[59:39] get that there
[59:41] to remind us
[59:45] of the word of God
[59:47] to remind us amen
[59:50] that you're a child of the king
[59:53] to remind us that you've got to walk
[59:54] Amen in Victory and not in defeat
[1:00:00] amen
[1:00:04] how much more do we need this in the
[1:00:06] south
[1:00:07] see
[1:00:09] but you know what this is a time that
[1:00:11] brother Branham said
[1:00:15] there will be no excuses at the day of
[1:00:17] judgment you believe that
[1:00:20] God ain't going to leave no one in
[1:00:22] ignorance
[1:00:27] he ain't going to leave no one in
[1:00:28] ignorance
[1:00:31] and if they're ignorant brother Adam
[1:00:32] said they're well fully ignorant
[1:00:37] he said it's like a man in a basement
[1:00:39] remember that
[1:00:42] refusing to believe that there's
[1:00:44] sunlight amen oh we got so many of that
[1:00:47] today
[1:00:48] I'm not talking about natural sunlight
[1:00:51] but they refuse to believe that the son
[1:00:55] of man is revealed in this day and
[1:00:58] that's the evening light of this hour
[1:01:00] they refuse they locked themselves up in
[1:01:03] a basement and they said I don't believe
[1:01:05] that
[1:01:07] I stay in this Darkness but I of the
[1:01:11] rising of the sun I don't want to know
[1:01:12] nothing about that
[1:01:16] you understand
[1:01:18] but they are willfully ignorant
[1:01:21] brother but I've said something's wrong
[1:01:23] with that person in his in his mind
[1:01:30] let's turn to acts 17 30.
[1:01:34] God ain't gonna leave no one in
[1:01:35] ignorance
[1:01:36] this is the hour brother
[1:01:39] worth
[1:01:41] the full word of God is revealed
[1:01:49] and everyone
[1:01:51] somehow some way
[1:01:55] brother Madam said even
[1:01:57] at the day of judgment he said there'll
[1:01:58] be some there
[1:02:03] that they seen they probably
[1:02:05] they probably never was presented or
[1:02:08] something like that he said but they've
[1:02:10] seen the life of somebody remember
[1:02:12] brother I'm saying that
[1:02:14] it's at the day of judgment they'll be
[1:02:16] judged
[1:02:17] because they
[1:02:19] at one time or another seen a child of
[1:02:22] God
[1:02:23] at one time one another he said
[1:02:26] they've seen the life of Christ and
[1:02:29] somebody and they knew that tested that
[1:02:31] was you're a written epistle rid of all
[1:02:34] men
[1:02:35] is that right
[1:02:37] so no one had to had to give him a
[1:02:39] message book or a Bible for them to read
[1:02:41] they read you
[1:02:45] they read your life
[1:02:48] is that right Hallelujah brother Adam
[1:02:51] said in this day that we're living He
[1:02:53] said people don't read their Bible no
[1:02:55] more so what does he do he says he puts
[1:02:57] the word in me in you it makes you the
[1:02:59] walking Bible
[1:03:02] amen
[1:03:04] written a pistols read of all men he's
[1:03:06] to write these things in our hearts
[1:03:09] on the tables of our heart amen
[1:03:13] acts 17 30 says
[1:03:16] and the times of this ignorance God
[1:03:20] winked at that means he overlooked
[1:03:23] but now commandeth all men everywhere to
[1:03:26] repent
[1:03:29] so at one time God was okay with people
[1:03:32] being in ignorant but now it's judgment
[1:03:35] time brother Adam said
[1:03:37] you believe that you believe that cloud
[1:03:40] in 63 was showing a supreme judge amen
[1:03:44] but yet in the hour of law in the hour
[1:03:48] of judgment amen he shows mercy and
[1:03:51] Grace unto the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:03:58] brother Adam said this sinful world is
[1:04:02] ripe for judgment
[1:04:08] they're right for judgment
[1:04:13] there'll be no excuses man
[1:04:15] no excuses know that I didn't know I
[1:04:18] wasn't there
[1:04:20] God ain't gonna leave no one in
[1:04:21] ignorance
[1:04:22] but yet he shows Grace he shows this
[1:04:26] revelation of the Blue Ribbon to us amen
[1:04:30] might be a little strange title but
[1:04:32] you'll get it in the future
[1:04:35] amen
[1:04:37] don't worry I break you know funny
[1:04:39] things here just it's the word of God
[1:04:41] Amen
[1:04:47] see he ain't going to leave no one in
[1:04:50] ignorance
[1:04:53] see at one time God overlooked our
[1:04:55] ignorance but now now that Elijah has
[1:04:59] come Hallelujah
[1:05:01] now that the son of man Ministry
[1:05:04] has come
[1:05:07] amen
[1:05:08] it has been shown to Every Nation
[1:05:12] the mighty Angels come down with an open
[1:05:14] book
[1:05:15] the white wig shows that this world
[1:05:18] is right for judgment amen
[1:05:21] brother badham said
[1:05:26] that the lamb
[1:05:30] that John
[1:05:31] seen in Revelations 5 he said he had not
[1:05:34] seen this land before
[1:05:37] he had been
[1:05:39] way in the eternities interceding for
[1:05:41] our ignorance is that what he said
[1:05:43] he had been interceding for our
[1:05:45] ignorance
[1:05:48] but at the end
[1:05:50] of the ages the book had to be opened is
[1:05:52] that right
[1:05:54] so the intercession for ignorance
[1:05:57] is over
[1:05:59] see
[1:06:01] and now God brother bam said he's
[1:06:03] claiming his children
[1:06:05] this is a claiming hour remember when he
[1:06:08] spoke of Ruth
[1:06:10] Ruth deciding
[1:06:12] amen
[1:06:14] Ruth laboring
[1:06:15] Ruth resting
[1:06:18] and then afterward he said Boaz did the
[1:06:20] claiming work
[1:06:22] he said this is that Ally
[1:06:24] when the open of the seals come he comes
[1:06:26] to claim the names that were on the book
[1:06:33] so now notice
[1:06:35] because the Seven Ages brother Bantam
[1:06:38] said he was the son of God he was
[1:06:40] priests he was intercessory
[1:06:42] is that right
[1:06:46] but now he's Advocate I want to get into
[1:06:48] that
[1:06:52] he's our Advocate do we have an advocate
[1:06:54] with the father
[1:06:55] amen
[1:06:58] see but intercession for ignorance
[1:07:02] is over
[1:07:04] now he comes to claim brother Brown said
[1:07:06] in the breach between the ages and the
[1:07:08] seals 1963.
[1:07:11] he says here
[1:07:14] notice
[1:07:16] he raised there today as
[1:07:21] as intercessor
[1:07:25] and to make intercession
[1:07:28] upon the ignorance of the people but
[1:07:30] John had not seen him
[1:07:32] he had been making intercession
[1:07:35] he had been way back in the eternities
[1:07:39] see
[1:07:39] showing
[1:07:41] that this
[1:07:43] substitutionary offering
[1:07:46] causing to believe it
[1:07:49] point it to him and the blood had not
[1:07:52] been shed yet
[1:07:53] and now
[1:07:56] the Bible says in Hebrews 12 that we
[1:07:59] have been brought amen not into a
[1:08:01] natural Mountain but unto
[1:08:04] amen
[1:08:06] Mount Zion
[1:08:08] and to the congregation
[1:08:10] of the firstborn into a numerable
[1:08:12] company of angels is that right
[1:08:15] that he says that where
[1:08:18] these numerable company of angels dwell
[1:08:20] also where God the judge of all is
[1:08:24] see the evening light has come
[1:08:28] you believe that
[1:08:30] the son of man has been revealed
[1:08:34] but when people are not willing see to
[1:08:38] seek
[1:08:39] after the truth
[1:08:42] they won't find it
[1:08:44] but Jesus said blessed are they who do
[1:08:47] thirst and hunger after righteousness
[1:08:49] they shall be filled
[1:08:51] now let us let us notice verse 29 there
[1:08:55] are numbers and
[1:08:57] numbers 15 verse 29
[1:09:08] . you shall have one law for him that
[1:09:10] senteth through ignorance both for him
[1:09:12] that is born among the children of
[1:09:13] Israel
[1:09:15] that for the stranger that sojourners
[1:09:17] among them
[1:09:23] brother random said that
[1:09:27] Eve
[1:09:29] she didn't sin willfully is that right
[1:09:32] she was deceived into it
[1:09:36] she thought she was doing right when she
[1:09:38] did
[1:09:39] amen
[1:09:40] but Adam's sin he was through through
[1:09:43] one man sin came into the world Amen
[1:09:46] but Adam walked out willfully he fell in
[1:09:49] transgression he sinned
[1:09:51] see but here
[1:09:54] the Lord sees that Israel was is so
[1:09:58] vulnerable and knew that they weren't
[1:10:00] able to fulfill his law
[1:10:02] he sees our weaknesses he sees our
[1:10:05] faults
[1:10:06] he sees how we all fall short of the
[1:10:08] glory of God
[1:10:09] so he provides Grace for them by the
[1:10:11] Blue Ribbon
[1:10:13] amen God sees our our inability
[1:10:17] Amen to stay to stay in the word
[1:10:21] but that's why I really random said the
[1:10:24] Holy Ghost amen
[1:10:27] he said that quickening power amen the
[1:10:31] spirit that raised Christ from the dead
[1:10:33] if it dwells in you it will also Quicken
[1:10:36] your mortal body it'll subject you to
[1:10:39] the word
[1:10:41] that's the Blue Ribbon amen it's the
[1:10:43] spirit of Truth
[1:10:46] it's the Holy Ghost
[1:10:49] it's a token of the hour
[1:10:55] amen it subjects you to the word is that
[1:10:58] right
[1:10:59] brings this body into subjection
[1:11:01] Amen brother Adam said this is my worst
[1:11:05] enemy
[1:11:07] amen this is the one that gets in God's
[1:11:09] way
[1:11:10] this is the one amen
[1:11:13] but that that blue ribbon that Holy
[1:11:16] Ghost on the inside amen
[1:11:20] brother about them said it and you will
[1:11:22] never get it
[1:11:24] if your soul didn't come from God
[1:11:29] he said if your soul came from God you
[1:11:32] always had eternal life
[1:11:35] that chain of God what's inside of you
[1:11:38] amen
[1:11:40] from the very time you came to the Earth
[1:11:44] but it's just now coming to life amen
[1:11:47] it's just now the Pearl amen is being
[1:11:51] brought out of the mud glory to God
[1:11:54] amen is being polished Amen brother damn
[1:11:57] said he got to beat the gold
[1:11:59] he's got to put it through the fire amen
[1:12:03] and sometimes we wonder Lord why are you
[1:12:05] putting me through this
[1:12:07] Lord why is this happening
[1:12:10] why is there problems in the church why
[1:12:13] is there problems in my family why is
[1:12:16] there problems in me
[1:12:18] why is there problems at home Hallelujah
[1:12:21] but don't worry even if you do fall amen
[1:12:24] God is giving you a blue ribbon to look
[1:12:28] not with natural eyes
[1:12:30] not with natural ice
[1:12:32] but we see with our heart
[1:12:36] we understand something on the inside we
[1:12:39] have a revelation
[1:12:42] to see to see is to understand amen
[1:12:47] and over there they had to see naturally
[1:12:49] look at the blue rib and say okay yeah
[1:12:51] that that reminds me of all the word of
[1:12:54] God I gotta I gotta get you know you
[1:12:57] know what you know what they say about
[1:12:59] this blue ribbon
[1:13:01] some commentaries
[1:13:04] they say the the
[1:13:06] this blue ribbon
[1:13:08] of course blue is a Heavenly color amen
[1:13:12] and it was used upon the borders of the
[1:13:15] priest's garments
[1:13:17] and they're signified that the Servants
[1:13:19] of God
[1:13:20] were to be Heavenly minded
[1:13:25] they were to be in obedience Heavenly in
[1:13:28] obedience
[1:13:30] and character
[1:13:33] separated from Earthly Ambitions and
[1:13:36] desires
[1:13:38] that's what that was for that's what
[1:13:40] that blue Rhythm was for
[1:13:44] to separate them
[1:13:46] from Earthly Ambitions and desires
[1:13:50] and you know in the natural of any in
[1:13:52] any contest you know what the Blue
[1:13:54] Ribbon is right
[1:13:56] that's the first first place Hallelujah
[1:14:02] amen you got to put his kingdom first
[1:14:05] amen you got to put the Blue Ribbon
[1:14:08] first that's his place amen

[1:14:32] see
[1:14:33] that's what that was for to remind them
[1:14:35] so but now now it's in the spiritual
[1:14:39] Realm
[1:14:40] see we don't we don't have to have
[1:14:42] you know the role or take a wearing the
[1:14:45] blue ribbon on them so see
[1:14:49] right
[1:14:52] amen
[1:14:53] but each each and every one of you can
[1:14:57] see that
[1:14:59] amen with eyes of understanding
[1:15:02] was eyes of faith with eyes of
[1:15:05] Revelation
[1:15:07] amen it's something in the soul that
[1:15:10] that's got to keep us in this hour
[1:15:14] did you know brother Madam said amen
[1:15:17] that God put in you all that you need
[1:15:19] for this journey
[1:15:23] amen you say God I need this it's in you

[1:16:11] amen
[1:16:13] I noticed
[1:16:17] so he he sees these things amen
[1:16:21] but now he's by this he's given them
[1:16:25] he's giving them some help here
[1:16:27] see that that was just in the natural
[1:16:30] that they would look
[1:16:32] and live amen
[1:16:35] and when when they looked at it it would
[1:16:37] remind them of all the Commandments of
[1:16:39] God see
[1:16:40] this is the hour
[1:16:42] where God promised to reveal all of the
[1:16:45] world is that right
[1:16:49] you know what I saw a file brother Larry
[1:16:51] about this blue ribbon
[1:16:55] this Blue Ribbon is not like we would
[1:16:57] think you know
[1:16:59] a ribbon
[1:17:01] it was actually
[1:17:04] like we read there at the fringes or at
[1:17:06] the borders of the hymns of the Garment
[1:17:11] but what it was is that they were all
[1:17:14] their threading all their their loose
[1:17:16] ends are you with me
[1:17:20] amen all their loose ends this this is
[1:17:23] you can look this up here
[1:17:25] all these Loose Ends
[1:17:27] they had blue Loose Ends
[1:17:32] but what they would do is that they
[1:17:33] would tie all the Loose Ends
[1:17:36] together
[1:17:37] amen
[1:17:39] and that's that was actually all the
[1:17:41] loose ends tied together was the Blue
[1:17:44] Ribbon
[1:17:48] oh
[1:17:50] we're promised in the shower amen
[1:17:53] according to Revelation 10 7 glory to
[1:17:55] God
[1:17:57] that when the spirit of Truth would come
[1:17:59] he would tie up all the Loose Ends
[1:18:04] to give us a token amen
[1:18:15] see what is blue represent
[1:18:20] and the message Hebrews chapter 6 part
[1:18:22] 3.
[1:18:24] 57.
[1:18:27] he said
[1:18:29] this great Forerunner has gone before us
[1:18:33] making a way
[1:18:34] he become from Spirit the great
[1:18:36] Fountains of the rainbow of God
[1:18:40] who had no beginning or no end
[1:18:42] he was forever God this ray of light
[1:18:46] went forth it was a ray of love
[1:18:49] that's the main one red
[1:18:52] but notice the next color that follows
[1:18:56] which was blue
[1:18:58] and blue is the trueness
[1:19:03] blue is the trueness
[1:19:06] see the spirit of Truth
[1:19:09] was going to come Jesus promises is that
[1:19:12] right
[1:19:13] if you turn with me
[1:19:15] two I'm gonna do a little Sunday school
[1:19:18] this morning
[1:19:20] Saint John chapter 14 and
[1:19:24] we'll read verse 16.
[1:19:27] Saint John chapter 14.
[1:19:58] let's just read verse 26 amen
[1:20:01] amen but the comforter
[1:20:03] which is the Holy Ghost
[1:20:05] whom the father will sin in my name he
[1:20:07] shall teach you all things and bring all
[1:20:10] things to your remembrance
[1:20:12] whatsoever
[1:20:14] I have said unto you
[1:20:16] Saint John now 16th chapter
[1:20:20] in the 13th verse
[1:20:24] or 12th verse
[1:20:26] 16 12.
[1:20:29] I have yet many things to say unto you
[1:20:32] but you cannot bear them now oh my God
[1:20:36] is that right so so he had a lot of
[1:20:38] things within him amen that he that he
[1:20:40] cannot he could not tell them and
[1:20:42] neither through the seven Church ages
[1:20:44] there was no way that these things could
[1:20:47] be given amen
[1:20:48] but at the at the end time at the open
[1:20:51] of these Seven Seals amen the full
[1:20:54] mystery of God would be revealed and it
[1:20:56] would it would bring
[1:20:58] a token of the hour brother random said
[1:21:00] the token
[1:21:02] amen did not come into existence until
[1:21:06] after these 14 days amen
[1:21:10] but now notice he says how be it when he
[1:21:13] the spirit of Truth has come he'll guide
[1:21:16] you into all truth or he shall not speak
[1:21:18] of himself but whosoever
[1:21:20] but whosoever
[1:21:22] he shall whatsoever he shall hear that
[1:21:26] shall he speak amen
[1:21:28] and he will show you things that come
[1:21:30] glory to God
[1:21:33] he shall glorify me
[1:21:36] for he shall receive a mind and shall
[1:21:39] shoe it unto you all that the father
[1:21:42] have have our mind therefore said I
[1:21:46] that he shall take a mind and shall
[1:21:48] shoot unto you
[1:21:51] amen
[1:21:53] notice what mother Madam says about this
[1:21:56] Spirit of Truth now keep this in mind
[1:21:58] that we're speaking Amen on this
[1:22:01] on this Blue Ribbon because that's what
[1:22:03] I believe
[1:22:05] it is a representation that was a
[1:22:07] foreshadow
[1:22:08] of the token of the hour
[1:22:11] amen something to to be on display in
[1:22:14] the South something to be applied into
[1:22:16] our hearts into our lives
[1:22:21] in the message three Witnesses 1951.
[1:22:28] he says send your angel from heaven
[1:22:32] that he might anoint your servant with
[1:22:34] the spirit
[1:22:35] of the prophetic being
[1:22:39] that would show things which was
[1:22:43] and things to come
[1:22:46] that I might declare you before the
[1:22:48] people saying that you're the same
[1:22:50] yesterday today and forever
[1:22:52] same Lord who knew where Nathanael was
[1:22:55] how he prayed under the tree how that
[1:22:57] woman at the well and had the husbands
[1:22:59] and the fish
[1:23:01] the coin in his mouth
[1:23:05] you're you know all things father amen I
[1:23:07] saw God's omniscience amen the might of
[1:23:10] God coming down in the last days
[1:23:13] pray for that same Spirit to be here
[1:23:15] tonight in the midst
[1:23:17] and will help us Amen in the future hope
[1:23:21] 1964
[1:23:22] brother Madam is speaking amen here
[1:23:26] how that all scripture must be fulfilled
[1:23:30] he says see you can't die you got
[1:23:32] eternal life the only thing the Redeemer
[1:23:35] has made you recognize it
[1:23:39] and you were always that that's the
[1:23:41] reason you see the day you're living in
[1:23:45] how many seasons raise your hand
[1:23:48] oh that's powerful think about what he
[1:23:50] said
[1:23:54] that's the reason you see the day you're
[1:23:56] living in
[1:23:57] see thank you
[1:23:59] the day we're living in you recognize it
[1:24:03] goes on to say the same message
[1:24:06] if you are the bride the bride is part
[1:24:08] of the husband
[1:24:10] the only place that you'll ever
[1:24:12] recognize it
[1:24:14] is recognize what part of the husband
[1:24:17] the word you are
[1:24:20] you can't recognize being the bride how
[1:24:22] many sees that now
[1:24:24] you have to recognize your position
[1:24:30] you have to recognize that God can't do
[1:24:34] Tuesday's work can't be done on
[1:24:36] Wednesday
[1:24:37] and Wednesdays got to be done on
[1:24:39] Wednesday amen
[1:24:42] say he said if you'd note Moses you know
[1:24:45] me the word for the hour
[1:24:48] the Lord your God shall raise up a
[1:24:50] prophet like unto me see get the idea he
[1:24:53] says oh my
[1:24:54] then Jesus said in Saint John 14 when he
[1:24:58] the Holy Ghost is tough he will bring
[1:25:01] these things to your memory
[1:25:04] remember that blue really was to remind
[1:25:06] them of all the Commandments of God
[1:25:09] that's what the spirit of Truth is doing
[1:25:12] in this hour amen he's reminding us
[1:25:15] and he says when the spirit of Truth was
[1:25:17] to come it was to bring these things to
[1:25:19] your memory to show you what day you're
[1:25:23] living in
[1:25:25] and then another thing you'll know him
[1:25:28] by is that he'll show you things to come
[1:25:30] see
[1:25:32] it's right back to the prophetic again
[1:25:36] when he's come see
[1:25:39] now look at this
[1:25:40] in the message of God 1962.
[1:25:44] paragraph 35 he says the holy spirit
[1:25:47] always speaks of the word you believe
[1:25:49] that
[1:25:51] he says I've got so many things
[1:25:54] he's quoting we read this right now I've
[1:25:57] got so many things to tell you you
[1:25:59] cannot understand it now but when he
[1:26:02] comes he'll guide you to it
[1:26:05] and look what he says after
[1:26:07] that's the reason the coming of the
[1:26:09] seals
[1:26:15] when was the spirit of Truth to come
[1:26:18] you say it fell on the day of Pentecost
[1:26:20] yes it did not denied
[1:26:23] it it was through the seven churches yes
[1:26:25] the holy ghost in the church
[1:26:28] I'm talking about the Blue Ribbon this
[1:26:30] morning
[1:26:32] I'm talking about the token Hallelujah
[1:26:35] amen I'm talking about your day and its
[1:26:38] message
[1:26:38] I'm talking about the word for our day
[1:26:42] amen
[1:26:43] when that's the reason the coming of the
[1:26:46] seals
[1:26:48] marriage and divorce 1965.
[1:26:51] paragraph 233 he says but now that the
[1:26:56] seals are open
[1:26:58] the spirit of Truth directs us to the
[1:27:01] word
[1:27:03] you hear that
[1:27:05] now that the shields are open the spirit
[1:27:09] of Truth
[1:27:10] directs us see when they would see that
[1:27:13] ribbon it would direct them
[1:27:16] amen to the Commandments of God to the
[1:27:19] word of God to the full revelation of
[1:27:22] the hour
[1:27:23] is that right
[1:27:25] amen but now with eyes of faith of
[1:27:29] understanding we see that amen and God
[1:27:32] has increased in Revelation I believe
[1:27:35] amen that this Revelation must increase
[1:27:39] it must get higher and higher amen
[1:27:43] brother Venom said these broken sisters
[1:27:46] amen they got static water
[1:27:49] amen
[1:27:51] they say but this this Fountain amen a
[1:27:55] pouting open in the House of David amen
[1:28:00] for sin and uncleanliness
[1:28:03] he says in Artesian well it flows it
[1:28:07] bubbles Hallelujah all the time even if
[1:28:10] it's dark if it's sunny if it's winter
[1:28:13] if it's summer it bubbles amen
[1:28:16] Hallelujah that keeps you all the time
[1:28:19] no matter what's taking place
[1:28:22] amen you can have a bubble in your soul
[1:28:25] all the time
[1:28:28] it don't got to be Sunday amen and if
[1:28:31] it's Sunday it should be even more
[1:28:33] Hallelujah
[1:28:34] Lord of God but Monday Tuesday Wednesday
[1:28:38] Thursday Friday amen it's bubbly it's
[1:28:42] bubbling
[1:28:44] something on the inside amen Hallelujah
[1:28:48] though his flesh get sick and tired
[1:28:51] though the mind is struggling you don't
[1:28:53] know what to do but something deep down
[1:28:56] inside it's pushing
[1:29:01] expression amen
[1:29:08] now that the seals are open
[1:29:10] the spirit of Truth directs us to the
[1:29:12] word ain't that powerful
[1:29:15] he says that explains why all the
[1:29:17] mistakes has been done
[1:29:19] Through the Ages
[1:29:21] because the seals was not open
[1:29:25] the Blue Ribbon had not come yet
[1:29:34] amen remember he said he'll show you
[1:29:37] things to come
[1:29:38] he'll show you things that are to be
[1:29:40] didn't he preach one like that
[1:29:42] things that are to be
[1:29:46] Sean use the spirit of Truth
[1:29:49] and he not only spoke back to Genesis 1
[1:29:51] 1. he went to the mind of God he'll
[1:29:53] remind you what is that he'll bring you
[1:29:56] back to God's memory
[1:29:58] he'll bring you to the mind of God
[1:30:01] to the memory of God
[1:30:04] to the thoughts of God so that you can
[1:30:06] recognize you were in his mind
[1:30:12] you were one of those Scots amen but now
[1:30:15] you've been expressed amen
[1:30:22] it'll remind you didn't Malachi didn't
[1:30:25] Malachi 3 said
[1:30:27] that he was going to write a book of
[1:30:28] remembrance
[1:30:31] it's memory of God you believe God has
[1:30:34] memory
[1:30:36] you believe God has a memory
[1:30:40] amen
[1:30:41] you can testify of this amen preachers
[1:30:44] can testify this you're preaching the
[1:30:46] Norton comes you just remember things
[1:30:50] is that right remember things you
[1:30:52] remember what is that the period of
[1:30:54] Truth
[1:30:55] reminding you I don't know if I'm crazy
[1:30:57] but sometimes I I even hear Brother
[1:31:00] Brown's voice in my head
[1:31:04] that's probably just me I'm just crazy
[1:31:06] like that I don't know
[1:31:09] amen but I hear his voice just like just
[1:31:12] like he screams on the tape that's how I
[1:31:14] hear it on here
[1:31:16] amen
[1:31:19] see brings it to your memory why amen
[1:31:23] because when these seals open brother
[1:31:25] Adam said it's calling the names out of
[1:31:28] the book
[1:31:30] that's the mystery being revealed the
[1:31:33] mystery being revealed it's not only
[1:31:35] revealing
[1:31:37] the written word
[1:31:39] but it's revealing the predestinated
[1:31:42] word
[1:31:46] yes sir he said in the message it is the
[1:31:49] rising of the Sun
[1:31:51] 1965 he said the word predestinated
[1:31:54] comes to the word written for the hour
[1:31:59] he said the word to the word that's what
[1:32:02] he said
[1:32:04] the word comes to the word the word
[1:32:06] predestinated to the word written of the
[1:32:09] hour
[1:32:10] and there's a United amen that's an
[1:32:14] invisible Union between Christ and his
[1:32:16] bride
[1:32:18] there's something taking place amen
[1:32:27] see to show you things that are to be
[1:32:31] it's prophetic
[1:32:35] is that right
[1:32:37] look what he said in Christ revealed in
[1:32:40] his own word
[1:32:41] paragraph 158.
[1:32:43] he says what's Malachi 4 to do to do the
[1:32:46] same thing
[1:32:47] what was the opening of the seals to do
[1:32:51] is to reveal and bring out if you
[1:32:53] haven't got eyes
[1:32:56] then what's the use to reveal
[1:32:59] there's got to be Eyes First is that
[1:33:01] right to reveal Malachi 4. to reveal
[1:33:05] Saint Luke 17 30 to reveal Saint John 14
[1:33:09] 12 and also Saint John 15 24 and then he
[1:33:13] says
[1:33:14] and Saint John 16 13. isn't that where
[1:33:17] we read
[1:33:21] 1613.
[1:33:23] prayer the truth
[1:33:26] in Revelation was 10 1-7
[1:33:29] see it's to illuminate Paul said it
[1:33:32] in Ephesians
[1:33:34] to illuminate
[1:33:36] the eyes of our understanding
[1:33:40] you said unless you're born again
[1:33:43] cannot see the kingdom of God to see is
[1:33:45] to understand
[1:33:47] amen
[1:33:49] Harvest Time 1964 he said but
[1:33:53] when the spirit of Truth has come he'll
[1:33:54] bring these things that I have taught to
[1:33:57] your memory
[1:33:59] he'll also show you things to come so
[1:34:02] the real
[1:34:03] Spirit-filled church now stays with the
[1:34:06] word
[1:34:07] and reflects the word
[1:34:10] it's God on Earth
[1:34:16] brother bam said deity's not in heaven
[1:34:21] hey man
[1:34:22] deity's not in heaven see they criticize
[1:34:25] us
[1:34:25] you believe in you know that deity stuff
[1:34:28] of course I do
[1:34:31] amen
[1:34:33] the whole the whole the whole words
[1:34:36] deity amen
[1:34:38] you believe this is God
[1:34:40] imprint for
[1:34:42] you so it's got to be dead amen this
[1:34:44] deity
[1:34:46] see
[1:34:49] amen
[1:34:52] but oh my
[1:34:55] now
[1:35:04] I believe just like this
[1:35:06] red Scarlet rope or the line
[1:35:09] that Rahab had to hang out her window
[1:35:12] as a sign as a token
[1:35:14] this has the blood on the doorpost
[1:35:17] I believe this blue ribbon the type of
[1:35:19] the token also amen
[1:35:23] has to be on display
[1:35:27] but Abraham said each time you come
[1:35:29] before God In Prayer got to present your
[1:35:31] token is that right
[1:35:35] how are you going to ask for something
[1:35:37] amen
[1:35:39] how are you going to claim something
[1:35:41] if you don't believe your names on the
[1:35:44] claiming book
[1:35:47] amen
[1:35:49] but when you believe amen by faith you
[1:35:51] can come with confidence and boldness
[1:35:54] Before the Throne of God said Lord I'm
[1:35:57] not worthy of this but by your grace
[1:36:00] amen
[1:36:02] you you've gave me this inheritance
[1:36:06] and I come to possess it this morning
[1:36:09] I come to take it amen
[1:36:12] why because the Blue Ribbon amen is
[1:36:17] putting me as something that I I know
[1:36:20] that I know amen
[1:36:22] Hallelujah that I come from the loins of
[1:36:25] Elohim
[1:36:28] that when he told Joe where was you
[1:36:31] before I lay the foundations of the
[1:36:33] world
[1:36:34] amen when the bomb of Gilead
[1:36:37] comes it begins to cure your Amnesia
[1:36:42] amen your spiritual Amnesia begins to go
[1:36:45] away and memory starts to come
[1:36:50] memory of God
[1:36:52] the spiritual will remind you amen of
[1:36:56] these things
[1:36:57] he said our human minds are they're dark
[1:37:00] into that
[1:37:01] amen Jesus he could go back and say
[1:37:04] glorify me with the glory we had before
[1:37:07] the foundation of the world he said but
[1:37:09] our minds are human minds they're dark
[1:37:11] into that
[1:37:13] amen but he said these that are
[1:37:16] possessed with the spirit of God they
[1:37:20] resisted the devil's lie in the
[1:37:22] beginning there's something on the
[1:37:24] inside amen that connects
[1:37:27] with the revealing of the word and when
[1:37:30] that connection happens brother ain't
[1:37:32] nothing that can break your elusia
[1:37:36] from the tie of the Blue Ribbon
[1:37:40] this is what we got to do in the shower
[1:37:42] we gotta hold on to that Hem of His
[1:37:46] Garment
[1:37:49] because it's on the fringes of of His
[1:37:51] Garment amen is he the high priest
[1:37:53] Hallelujah is he the one that can be
[1:37:56] touched by the feeling of our
[1:37:57] infirmities
[1:37:59] amen but that woman what does she do she
[1:38:02] knew that was the word for her hour
[1:38:06] she knew amen that was caught in human
[1:38:09] flesh walking around there
[1:38:13] amen and she had an issue
[1:38:16] amen
[1:38:17] isn't that amazing we all got issues
[1:38:19] amen
[1:38:20] she had a blood issue but I got
[1:38:23] different issues amen
[1:38:27] Hallelujah no matter what your issue is
[1:38:30] amen draw virtue for all virtue
[1:38:36] amen are we here to draw a virtue this
[1:38:39] morning
[1:38:40] amen I need virtue amen you need virtue
[1:38:44] amen
[1:38:45] Hallelujah
[1:38:47] but brother Adam said in order to give
[1:38:50] out virtue you got to First have virtue
[1:38:52] amen
[1:38:53] but it's not your virtue he said the
[1:38:55] virtue of Jesus Christ
[1:38:57] it's the patience of Jesus Christ it's
[1:38:59] the faith of Jesus Christ amen so it's
[1:39:02] the Holy Ghost Inside of You amen
[1:39:06] is that right
[1:39:10] amen
[1:39:12] notice
[1:39:15] notice this
[1:39:17] see
[1:39:19] you believe the spirit of Truth has come
[1:39:22] directing us to the word
[1:39:25] it's keeping us in line with the word
[1:39:26] see that was Israel's problem
[1:39:29] amen God saw their inability to stay
[1:39:31] with the word they were always going one
[1:39:33] side go another side
[1:39:35] see
[1:39:37] but amen when he
[1:39:39] gives him something to hold on
[1:39:41] we got to hold on to that what God has
[1:39:44] given us
[1:39:45] we can't pursue take it for granted we
[1:39:48] can't Venture without Authority we got
[1:39:50] to know what we're doing
[1:39:53] brother Brown said don't take one step
[1:39:55] without first knowing what you're doing
[1:39:58] amen
[1:40:00] Hallelujah and footsteps are possession
[1:40:02] we're possessed in this thing
[1:40:04] amen this is ours Hallelujah
[1:40:07] God has given it to us by grace
[1:40:11] you believe every promise in the book is
[1:40:13] yours
[1:40:15] every chapter every verse Every Lie
[1:40:17] amen
[1:40:19] oh my
[1:40:21] God so we gotta draw from this word
[1:40:23] amen God give us a message not only to
[1:40:26] read it it had knowledge intellectually
[1:40:28] but to draw virtue from it
[1:40:33] see to draw a virtue from
[1:40:40] it let me read something to you
[1:40:44] is in the message

[1:40:58] I wanted to do it bigger and
[1:41:02] brother Larry already had the font real
[1:41:04] big so look how big that came out
[1:41:08] real big
[1:41:11] I liked it
[1:41:13] how the angel came to me in his
[1:41:15] Commission
[1:41:16] 1955.
[1:41:21] he says in the beginning
[1:41:28] the first thing that I could ever
[1:41:30] remember is a vision
[1:41:33] the first thing that I can recall to my
[1:41:35] mind is a vision that the lord gave me
[1:41:37] and that was many many years ago I was a
[1:41:39] little bitty boy and I had a rock in my
[1:41:41] hand he said now I beg your pardon
[1:41:44] I can remember
[1:41:47] what I was wearing a long dress
[1:41:53] this is the first thing Brother Band can
[1:41:55] remember
[1:41:56] now I can hardly remember I was three
[1:41:58] years old
[1:42:00] right probably four years old some
[1:42:02] running
[1:42:03] can you remember
[1:42:05] some things maybe a little bit
[1:42:08] but he remembers when he was crawling

[1:42:14] something like that
[1:42:17] right
[1:42:19] first thing he can remember is what he
[1:42:21] was wearing a long dress
[1:42:25] he says I don't know where the interview
[1:42:27] old enough to remember when little boys
[1:42:29] used to wear long dresses how many here
[1:42:31] remember when children wore yes long
[1:42:33] dresses he says
[1:42:35] well I I can remember in my little old
[1:42:37] Hut there where we lived I was crawling
[1:42:40] on the floor
[1:42:43] and it was someone I don't know who it
[1:42:45] was that come in and Mama

[1:43:45] his in his mind

[1:44:00] revelation of the Blue Ribbon

[1:46:10] not only the woman after not only the
[1:46:13] woman with the blood issue touched Jesus
[1:46:17] but in Mark chapter 6 The Bible says
[1:46:20] that
[1:46:21] many
[1:46:23] came unto Jesus
[1:46:26] amen
[1:46:27] and they just all they wanted to do was
[1:46:29] touch him
[1:46:31] amen brother
[1:46:34] that same thing
[1:46:37] happened in our day
[1:46:41] listen to me and under the first and
[1:46:44] second pool brother Branham
[1:46:46] you had people just wanting to get just
[1:46:48] close enough
[1:46:51] to touch them
[1:46:53] I can go through quotes I got quotes
[1:46:55] here
[1:46:55] but Brother Band tells testimon little
[1:46:57] girl in Finland
[1:46:59] he tests testimony of different ones he
[1:47:01] said the little girl just came
[1:47:03] didn't say a word

[1:47:33] and she said Thank you in her language
[1:47:37] you had people just coming to the
[1:47:39] meetings just to get into prayer line
[1:47:41] This is under first and second pool I
[1:47:44] don't know if
[1:47:45] anybody here was
[1:47:47] in the prayer line or something like
[1:47:48] that maybe
[1:47:51] but brother
[1:47:53] that doesn't mean that you and I can't
[1:47:55] draw a virtue from him now
[1:47:58] because now
[1:48:00] by the spirit of Truth the opening of
[1:48:02] the word of the seals
[1:48:04] that was done under the third pool you
[1:48:06] believe that

[1:48:26] know it's that way
[1:48:28] amen I just believe it all
[1:48:32] right but you see we got to draw a
[1:48:34] virtue from
[1:48:37] it that's what this is about amen
[1:48:39] draw virtue from this
[1:48:41] we gotta grab a hold amen the Hem of
[1:48:44] this garment amen
[1:48:46] and this garment is the word is that
[1:48:48] right revelation 19.
[1:48:51] garment's the word
[1:48:54] but notice
[1:48:55] that's what we're holding on to see not
[1:48:58] under the first and second pool but God
[1:49:00] has brought us to the most glorious part
[1:49:04] of this not to touch his coat physically
[1:49:07] amen
[1:49:08] but to draw virtue
[1:49:10] from the revealing of the word so what
[1:49:12] because first poor dealt with Divine
[1:49:14] Healing that was in the flesh
[1:49:17] sicknesses and things in the flesh first
[1:49:20] pool second pool is deserving the spirit
[1:49:23] second round

[1:49:38] Hallelujah the Mysteries calling your
[1:49:41] name the revealing of the wire the third
[1:49:43] pull amen is calling your soul and
[1:49:47] you're being drawn to this amen and you

[1:49:51] to draw a virtue being a draw Revelation
[1:49:55] for your life
[1:49:57] if it's all wisdom and understanding
[1:49:59] amen
[1:50:00] you believe that in the south
[1:50:02] God has brought us to the most glorious
[1:50:04] part
[1:50:06] of this of of this of his ministry
[1:50:10] amen
[1:50:11] to draw a virtue from it to pool like
[1:50:14] that woman amen and touch the hymn of
[1:50:16] His Garment she had a revelation brother
[1:50:19] she had a revelation because brother
[1:50:22] random said it's your attitude towards
[1:50:24] God's gift
[1:50:27] he said one Roman soldier spit in his
[1:50:30] face and socked them amen
[1:50:33] he didn't get no virtue out of it
[1:50:36] and that's what they're doing to this
[1:50:38] Blue Ribbon brother that's what they're
[1:50:40] doing to this message and that's why
[1:50:42] they say well I don't get none out of it

[1:50:50] it's your attitude towards this garment
[1:50:52] it's your attitude towards the Blue
[1:50:54] Ribbon amen

[1:51:02] you know
[1:51:04] but I believe the bride's got absolute
[1:51:06] in the shot
[1:51:08] I believe we got a tide post to hold on
[1:51:10] to
[1:51:11] amen I believe we got an anchor of the
[1:51:14] Soul that's beyond the veil amen
[1:51:17] hallelujah it's in the soul amen that's
[1:51:20] where it is
[1:51:26] that right
[1:51:28] and what happens
[1:51:30] we come to draw from this
[1:51:32] and you know that woman with the blood
[1:51:34] issue
[1:51:35] she had a revelation
[1:51:38] all she did was touch him and everybody
[1:51:40] was pressing them touching them
[1:51:44] but he says somebody touched
[1:51:46] I perceive it strength virtue holy ghost
[1:51:51] power has come out of me

[1:51:59] amen and she she saw she came out she
[1:52:02] said that wasn't me amen Hallelujah
[1:52:06] oh my God
[1:52:08] look at this scripture with me
[1:52:10] Leviticus 15.
[1:52:18] what time we have
[1:52:30] Leviticus 15.
[1:52:34] verse 25
[1:52:41] if a woman have an issue of her blood
[1:52:43] many days out of the time of her
[1:52:45] separation
[1:52:46] of it run beyond the time of her
[1:52:49] separation
[1:52:50] of the days of the issue of her
[1:52:52] uncleannessia shall be as the days of
[1:52:54] her separation
[1:52:55] she shall be unclean
[1:52:58] every bed we're on she lieth all the
[1:53:01] days of her issue shall
[1:53:03] be in her as the bed of her separation
[1:53:06] and whatsoever she sitteth upon shall be
[1:53:09] unclean
[1:53:10] as the uncleanliness of her separation
[1:53:13] whosoever touches those things that
[1:53:16] shall be unclean
[1:53:19] shall wash his clothes
[1:53:21] and bathe himself in water and be clean
[1:53:23] until they're even
[1:53:26] see cleansing
[1:53:30] our notices
[1:53:32] cleansing always come in the evening
[1:53:34] time
[1:53:37] then he says
[1:53:39] what if she be cleansed of her issue
[1:53:42] then shall
[1:53:44] then she shall number to herself how
[1:53:47] many days
[1:53:50] seven days
[1:53:53] and after that
[1:53:55] she shall be cleaned
[1:53:59] see
[1:54:00] you believe Jesus Christ took care of
[1:54:02] our issue
[1:54:04] two thousand years ago
[1:54:07] but still
[1:54:09] the church had to count seven days
[1:54:12] think about it Seven Days Seven Church
[1:54:15] ages
[1:54:16] amen
[1:54:18] now remember the one with the blood shoe
[1:54:20] she touched some of His Garment she was
[1:54:23] healed that was a tight
[1:54:25] the church then
[1:54:27] amen
[1:54:30] getting there and cleaning the issue
[1:54:32] taken care of but seven days
[1:54:35] and after that she shall be clean and on
[1:54:37] the eighth day
[1:54:42] see
[1:54:44] on the eighth day
[1:54:46] she shall take unto her two
[1:54:49] Turtles
[1:54:50] two young pigeons and bring them into
[1:54:52] the priests of the door
[1:54:55] of the Tabernacle the congregation
[1:54:58] oh my
[1:55:01] I'm bypassing a whole lot of things here
[1:55:04] and the priest shall offer the one for a
[1:55:07] sin offering and the other for a burnt
[1:55:10] offering and the priest shall make an
[1:55:11] atonement
[1:55:12] for before the Lord for the issue of her
[1:55:15] uncleanness
[1:55:19] see
[1:55:20] if you study this the Bible actually
[1:55:22] says that the woman was not even allowed
[1:55:25] into the congregation
[1:55:28] she wasn't allowed to approach anybody
[1:55:30] to touch anybody that's why this woman
[1:55:33] in order to do that in the days of Jesus
[1:55:35] she had to have understanding and Faith
[1:55:37] she wasn't going to go try to see if she
[1:55:40] was going to get healed she was going to
[1:55:42] get healed amen
[1:55:45] she was going to go touch amen and draw
[1:55:47] a virtue out of it Hallelujah
[1:55:51] but it was showing us amen
[1:55:53] that after these seven churches glory to
[1:55:56] God
[1:55:57] when the rising of a new day brother
[1:55:59] random said

[1:56:04] turn he starts to blend in with the Son
[1:56:08] of God Amen this issue would be taken
[1:56:10] care of
[1:56:12] why because there would be something
[1:56:14] here Amen to give us that virtue that
[1:56:17] overcoming power that's why he said this
[1:56:20] bride will not fall Hallelujah

[1:56:41] to go into
[1:56:42] formalism and
[1:56:44] organization and
[1:56:46] then God would have to raise up another
[1:56:48] one
[1:56:51] did you know brother bam said
[1:56:53] Church ages he said that cycle is ended
[1:56:56] he said this cycle
[1:56:58] is going into eternity

[1:58:38] brother bam said they're worshiping the
[1:58:39] devil
[1:58:43] in this hour thinking they're worshiping
[1:58:45] God but there's only one place where God
[1:58:47] accepts worship
[1:58:49] as soon as provided please
[1:58:52] it says the word for your day amen the
[1:58:55] message of the hour
[1:58:59] that's where God accepts worship amen
[1:59:01] and God has allowed us to enter in
[1:59:03] because
[1:59:04] our blood issue has been healed is taken
[1:59:08] care of
[1:59:09] amen
[1:59:10] you believe that
[1:59:13] now let me let me close up here
[1:59:26] now notice that
[1:59:31] this is
[1:59:34] the eyes to see brother bam said is in
[1:59:36] the heart
[1:59:38] the message the door inside the door
[1:59:41] 1958 he said
[1:59:46] on the inside of the heart
[1:59:48] is the eyes
[1:59:51] the eyes of understanding
[1:59:54] so what we're seeing with eyes of
[1:59:57] understanding the sound
[1:59:58] to see is to understand
[2:00:03] we understand with the heart amen as we
[2:00:05] said
[2:00:06] and
[2:00:10] so notice that
[2:00:13] remember you remember
[2:00:15] Simeon
[2:00:18] Simeon had he had been promised by the
[2:00:20] Holy Spirit
[2:00:23] that that his that he would see
[2:00:26] amen
[2:00:28] the Messiah the savior of Israel
[2:00:31] amen before before he would go
[2:00:34] is that right
[2:00:37] and according to the promise of the Holy
[2:00:39] Ghost one day he
[2:00:41] he rose up by the spirit brother bam
[2:00:43] said he was in a study room
[2:00:45] the spirit of God Rose him up
[2:00:48] led him straight to the Christ amen
[2:00:51] you know what what day that was
[2:00:55] you know what he said
[2:00:57] he said my eyes
[2:01:00] have seen thy salvation thou let thy
[2:01:03] servant depart in peace amen
[2:01:05] in Shalom amen
[2:01:09] but that was the Bible says that was on
[2:01:12] the eighth day that they brought Jesus
[2:01:14] to the temple
[2:01:16] it was on the eighth day that his eyes
[2:01:17] seen the salvation
[2:01:20] is that right according according to the
[2:01:22] law they had to bring
[2:01:24] the children for circumcision on the
[2:01:26] eighth day
[2:01:28] and I believe that's what is taking
[2:01:30] place
[2:01:31] see
[2:01:33] we can also see when
[2:01:41] we remember a man in Saint John chapter
[2:01:43] 9 that was born blind remember that
[2:01:48] and the disciples asked Jesus whose sin
[2:01:51] his mother his father
[2:01:53] who sinned he said no one no one's
[2:01:56] sinned
[2:01:58] but that the glory of God
[2:02:03] oh so that the works of God could be
[2:02:05] made manifest
[2:02:07] brother Benham said that this man had no
[2:02:10] eyeballs in his socket
[2:02:13] amen he had no eyeballs in his socket is
[2:02:16] that right
[2:02:19] but Jesus amen
[2:02:21] he's spat on the ground
[2:02:24] made some mud
[2:02:25] is that right
[2:02:26] I remember one brother I first went out
[2:02:29] to Arkansas and
[2:02:31] he said brother we believe it all here
[2:02:33] he said
[2:02:35] he said I believe when brother Ram spit
[2:02:38] on the ground it was thus said the Lord
[2:02:44] he said that's scriptural because Jesus
[2:02:47] put on the ground one time and made some
[2:02:49] mud and
[2:02:51] man received his eyes
[2:02:59] but when he put the mud on his eyes amen
[2:03:03] what did Jesus tell this blind man
[2:03:06] said go wash
[2:03:09] in the pool of Siloam
[2:03:12] Siloam amen
[2:03:15] oh
[2:03:17] you see if you study it that pool of
[2:03:21] shalom
[2:03:22] it was in Solomon's Temple amen and then
[2:03:26] Solomon's Temple
[2:03:27] they had a water a water uh Aqueduct or
[2:03:32] work set
[2:03:33] that field
[2:03:35] these pools in the temple amen
[2:03:38] and the water came from the mountains of
[2:03:41] Judea
[2:03:42] from a spring
[2:03:44] called The Virgin Spring
[2:03:47] amen I'm making this up this is a
[2:03:51] h
[2:03:51] is in the Lexicon you just hit Siloam
[2:03:54] and you find them
[2:03:56] but what's interesting about this is
[2:03:59] that that water flowed from The Virgin
[2:04:01] Spring and wrote down some channels
[2:04:04] there float flowed down
[2:04:06] went into the temple
[2:04:08] and there was a first initial pool
[2:04:12] that would get filled with water amen a
[2:04:15] pool of water
[2:04:16] and then when that was filled it would
[2:04:19] overflow
[2:04:20] and it dropped into a second pull you
[2:04:23] you understand
[2:04:25] and in that
[2:04:27] that pool that pool of water would get
[2:04:31] filled amen with water
[2:04:34] and then when that was filled up
[2:04:37] it would it would overflow into a
[2:04:41] third pool
[2:04:47] and guess what
[2:04:50] when Jesus told this blind man
[2:04:53] and put mud on his eyes said go wash
[2:04:57] your eyes
[2:04:58] in the third pool amen
[2:05:03] that was actually the the spool of
[2:05:06] Siloam was the third pool in Solomon's
[2:05:10] Temple
[2:05:11] the poor of Shalom was also called The
[2:05:15] King's pool amen
[2:05:19] Lord of God when that sword dropped in
[2:05:22] his head he said this is a sword of the
[2:05:24] king amen
[2:05:27] it's the third post of indication of
[2:05:29] your ministry
[2:05:31] amen and that was the type of the book
[2:05:33] The open book coming into his hand to
[2:05:36] open the seals so that our eyes can come
[2:05:40] open amen
[2:05:43] because you and I we were born blind
[2:05:47] amen we were born blind we were born in
[2:05:51] sin shaped in iniquity when we were born
[2:05:54] into this world we're blind as a bat not
[2:05:57] naturally but spiritually
[2:06:00] our eyes could not see the Blue Ribbon
[2:06:03] Hallelujah
[2:06:04] glory to God
[2:06:06] but now that we've washed our eyes in
[2:06:09] the third pool amen
[2:06:11] our eyes come open
[2:06:14] our eyes come open amen and we see the
[2:06:18] Blue Ribbon
[2:06:19] amen
[2:06:22] Lord of God we wash our eyes in the
[2:06:25] king's pool amen
[2:06:27] Hallelujah
[2:06:30] Because by the time we got there the
[2:06:32] first and second we're already field so
[2:06:37] amen and our eyes are open now
[2:06:40] our eyes have been opened and we see
[2:06:44] and when we see
[2:06:46] hey man we remember
[2:06:55] and you know what that reminds me of
[2:06:57] brother brother Billy Paul telling that
[2:06:59] testimony

[2:07:03] our day
[2:07:05] see that little girl come up with no

[2:09:12] he said that the great messenger
[2:09:14] Among Us now the great Christ the Holy
[2:09:17] Spirit
[2:09:18] he's he's made Vivid he's made
[2:09:20] understanding
[2:09:22] see
[2:09:23] eyes of understanding
[2:09:26] he also said in the future home
[2:09:29] the evidence
[2:09:30] of the Holy Ghost is when you can
[2:09:32] receive the word not some system
[2:09:34] would have a clear understanding
[2:09:37] how do you know the word is clear
[2:09:40] you understand it you watch it vindicate
[2:09:43] itself
[2:09:45] it's eyes of understanding Brethren
[2:09:46] sound something within us that can see
[2:09:51] these things amen
[2:09:54] but notice
[2:10:00] I want to finish with this year
[2:10:03] I won't read the scripture I'll just
[2:10:04] quote it to you
[2:10:07] a whole lot of other things we can talk
[2:10:08] about also
[2:10:10] the garments priests the priest garment
[2:10:13] and
[2:10:14] the inner veil of the Tabernacle had
[2:10:17] four colors to it
[2:10:20] is that right
[2:10:22] those four colors they were purple
[2:10:25] red Scarlet white linen
[2:10:28] and the fourth color was blue
[2:10:31] and the type of the four gospel four
[2:10:33] living creatures
[2:10:35] Matthew was pertaining to the lion the
[2:10:38] king the royalty
[2:10:40] purple color amen
[2:10:42] Mark was the ox the sacrifice the red
[2:10:45] blood the Scarlet amen Luke was the man
[2:10:50] without sin faultless spotless clean
[2:10:52] white
[2:10:53] Jesus Christ coming to the Earth perfect
[2:10:56] man white
[2:10:58] but the fourth the eagle John amen
[2:11:02] his color was the blue
[2:11:05] see Spirit of Truth The Blue Ribbon The
[2:11:08] Eagle anointing amen showing us
[2:11:11] that the eagle he flies into the into
[2:11:13] the blue amen he goes to the highest
[2:11:15] part he dwells in blue amen he dwells in
[2:11:20] the Blue Area Hallelujah
[2:11:22] is that right
[2:11:26] see it's a Heavenly age it's a Rapture
[2:11:28] age brother bam said
[2:11:31] amen wordage amen
[2:11:35] it's the age of the Blue Ribbon amen
[2:11:37] Lord of God
[2:11:40] but
[2:11:49] oh yes stand on your feet amen
[2:11:54] like I said we
[2:11:56] get into many things
[2:12:06] I'll quote to you the scripture
[2:12:13] first Samuel
[2:12:16] chapter 15.
[2:12:20] verse 26 to 28.
[2:12:22] speaks of Saul
[2:12:26] Saul he had he had the word for his age
[2:12:30] he had a Samuel the prophet
[2:12:33] is that right
[2:12:37] Samuel had it
[2:12:39] anointed him as king
[2:12:44] he had the word for his days Saul did
[2:12:50] but in that scripture that I just quoted
[2:12:52] to you
[2:12:55] something happened
[2:12:57] or so
[2:13:02] he began to go astray
[2:13:05] begin to listen to the people
[2:13:07] remember
[2:13:09] Samuel told him to kill everything amen
[2:13:12] and he didn't obey he said obedience is
[2:13:15] better than sacrifice you remember the
[2:13:16] scripture
[2:13:19] but what's tremendous about that
[2:13:20] scripture is
[2:13:24] the Bible says there first Samuel 15
[2:13:27] 26-28 that
[2:13:30] because of that
[2:13:32] Samuel the prophet
[2:13:36] he told song
[2:13:39] he said this this day
[2:13:43] God is taking the kingdom away from
[2:13:47] that right
[2:13:49] he's giving it to another
[2:13:51] the Bible says that Saul
[2:13:56] grab a hold of Samuels
[2:14:00] garment
[2:14:03] the Hem of His Garment the skirt
[2:14:07] that's what we're talking that's where
[2:14:08] that blue ribbon is
[2:14:11] but what was different about this is
[2:14:13] that
[2:14:15] the Bible says that it ripped
[2:14:22] that was symbolizing
[2:14:25] of what Samuel had just prophesied to
[2:14:27] him
[2:14:30] so
[2:14:36] after he went his own
[2:14:38] after his own understanding
[2:14:41] he lost
[2:14:42] the grip of this garment
[2:14:45] you understand
[2:14:48] he lost grip of His Garment
[2:14:52] I believe God has given us this God I
[2:14:54] believe God has given us
[2:14:56] to grab a hole
[2:14:58] of the hymn of the Border The Fringe
[2:15:00] where this Blue Ribbon is amen
[2:15:04] you believe that
[2:15:06] and just like Saul many today
[2:15:10] have lost grip of it amen
[2:15:13] have tore it
[2:15:17] and what happened
[2:15:18] he lost his position
[2:15:23] he fell away from his place
[2:15:30] it's the same thing today
[2:15:32] many are they're losing this sight
[2:15:35] they're losing their Grit
[2:15:38] of the Garment
[2:15:41] they're they're tearing the Blue Ribbon
[2:15:43] apart amen
[2:15:45] they're tearing these things at God
[2:15:48] has done he's tied all these loose sins
[2:15:50] for us to grab a hold of him not to tear
[2:15:52] it not to do what we want with it but to
[2:15:55] hold on to it to draw virtue from it
[2:16:00] amen
[2:16:05] and he lost his position
[2:16:08] and I believe there's a bride in this
[2:16:09] hour
[2:16:11] amen
[2:16:13] that'll hold on right to the end
[2:16:16] she knows amen
[2:16:19] as long as I'm
[2:16:21] holding on to this
[2:16:23] see not hanging in somebody's coattail
[2:16:25] no I'm not talking about that
[2:16:28] I'm talking about holding on to the word
[2:16:33] is the Garment the word
[2:16:37] that's what we're holding on to in this
[2:16:38] hour
[2:16:41] you believe that
[2:16:43] musicians were played please Softly
[2:16:51] God has opened Our Eyes by the system
[2:16:56] sometimes brother random says
[2:17:01] the church begins to lose their Vision
[2:17:04] you know what the scripture said
[2:17:07] the individual also begins to lose his
[2:17:10] vision
[2:17:14] our vision becomes dim
[2:17:19] so he said anoint your eyes with Isaacs
[2:17:21] you may see
[2:17:23] so we can look amen with our heart
[2:17:28] unto the blue ribbonate
[2:17:31] something to hold us in this hour
[2:17:35] something to keep us amen
[2:17:40] and he said a people
[2:17:44] without Vision they perish
[2:17:46] and you see that
[2:17:48] you see a great Falling Away taking
[2:17:49] place in the south in the message
[2:17:54] they're losing their grit amen
[2:17:58] tearing this
[2:18:01] this Blue Ribbon apart they they have it
[2:18:04] there just like Saul did he had it
[2:18:07] all you had to do was just obey amen
[2:18:10] obey the voice
[2:18:14] Samuel the prophet there the word for
[2:18:17] his hour
[2:18:23] instead of holding on to the Garment he
[2:18:25] tore it he ripped
[2:18:30] that's what happened to the Pentecostals
[2:18:32] they had brother Bradham amongst them
[2:18:34] they had them right there
[2:18:39] just like Saul had Samuel
[2:18:44] but when he gave them certain orders and
[2:18:46] began to preach the word to him
[2:18:49] they couldn't hold on any longer
[2:18:54] amen
[2:19:01] in the Garment to him it was ripped
[2:19:04] it's given to another amen and I believe
[2:19:06] that's you and me in this hour
[2:19:10] but there's still many today
[2:19:14] you know they're losing it they're
[2:19:16] ripping
[2:19:19] falling from their place amen
[2:19:22] there's a there's a bride in this hour
[2:19:24] there's a church that's called to take
[2:19:26] her position and take her place in
[2:19:28] Christ
[2:19:30] he said she'll not follow amen she'll
[2:19:33] hold on
[2:19:35] so let's draw from the fountain this
[2:19:37] morning
[2:19:38] or this day amen
[2:19:41] let's draw virtue for whatever needs you
[2:19:43] have brother sister
[2:19:45] with our eyes closed amen and our hearts
[2:19:48] surrendered to him
[2:19:51] don't you just want to touch him
[2:19:54] don't you just want to draw
[2:19:56] virtue for your life
[2:20:00] we want something to hold us amen
[2:20:03] something to really keep us amen
[2:20:06] when all else has failed

[2:21:00] as your Prophet said in the Statue of a
[2:21:03] perfect man that
[2:21:05] men like Oral Roberts they would have
[2:21:07] people lay their hands on them
[2:21:11] on the stereos to have a point of
[2:21:13] contact so their hand could touch
[2:21:14] something

[2:51:28] brother Diego

[2:51:32] business as a dog grooming business
[2:51:35] so we're here off of Brad Sean Folsom
[2:51:36] I'm not giving you a plug I'm just
[2:51:38] telling you
[2:51:39] but
[2:51:41] I was about to bust with that message
[2:51:42] brother Diego
[2:51:44] I'm telling you
[2:51:45] about seven weeks ago
[2:51:49] a soldier an ex-soldier a veteran
[2:51:53] he was they were working next door
[2:51:56] and he comes over
[2:51:59] and he gives me something out of the
[2:52:01] blue
[2:52:04] on my counter
[2:52:06] at my my shop I have a little paper
[2:52:09] there it hangs like this I stapled it
[2:52:12] there
[2:52:13] and it's a paper that tells the people
[2:52:15] what is acceptable for
[2:52:19] for the payment
[2:52:21] of the work we do
[2:52:23] right there hanging
[2:52:25] this Soldier
[2:52:27] walked in
[2:52:29] and he gave me a blue ribbon
[2:52:34] fourth it was from 1930
[2:52:38] and you know we're just Gentile dogs
[2:52:40] that's what I do I watch Gentile dogs
[2:52:42] for a living
[2:52:45] and it was a blue ribbon
[2:52:47] for first place in the world
[2:52:52] for
[2:52:54] a dog competition that somewhere
[2:52:56] somebody was in
[2:52:58] and I don't know why but I thought

[2:53:09] blue ribbon brothers and sisters
[2:53:11] Blue Ribbon first place

[2:53:26] and look at it
[2:53:29] all glory to God brothers and sisters
