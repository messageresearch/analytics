TRANSCRIPT
========================================
pause thousand but it's here already there's people that don't believe that the Holy Ghost is deity as they die that the Holy Ghost today it is Jesus Christ he said first the anointed man now the anointed people Anointed with Eve turn them down what did he turn down the spoken word in that same message foreign amen glory to God amen hallelujah the 70th week what is it yes they see they felt the coming of a pope the holy man amen amen worldliness Aristocrats that treat them to the church changing the order of worship that was a rebuke for the first for the first church age the love you once had in America all right well we don't worship like that anymore you probably don't worship that's right that's your personal revelation Hallelujah that Spirit was coming yes and he said the church with its Classics of his classicals and dignitaries person and personalities they've seen they were coming something the Holy Ghost was warning them of the last days I hope you remember how Jesus spoke of it to finally become a doctor in an organization we are not in darkness now remember saying this in 1961. he's saying that full Darkness has not come here yeah amen yes when he drew the seven moons and how they had a little bit of life and darkness a little bit of light all through the church ages but he said the last one I put the light in there but he says when I see the Visions he said I couldn't see past 1977 it was total darkness the Holy Spirit came Jordan but that was in 1960. in 1961. amen amen 1964. amen amen where exactly we are exactly 50 to get each other they went into a total darkness that's apostasis notice them he says we're not in darkness now remember that Brethren see here we are yeah organizations how that Spirit came in yeah people that put in more money because I put more money yes and brothers that's what that Spirit began to come in is that right yes amen Hallelujah neglect does it come in come on through the ministry no sir no go back and study the message yes and that spiritual amen Place ministers that did later on did what they did yeah but it began with the people losing sight of what they really were supposed the Pentecostal you see what it is now all right it's that's all that's called God is he sits in the temple it is in the last days here we are here right now we see the falling away we see it remember we see the church getting further and further away going right back again where we come from we're at the end times we read these scriptures here and we're going to see how these scriptures we read first Timothy chapter four where in the latter day in the latter times and doctrines but that literally means is Hallelujah amen amen but now all right the testimony of a true witness yes he testified his word testifies but in the last days there will come a falling away and there will come up a cold formal powerless churches yep that's what we're living in a church that had no power form of godliness from such turn away yes he give the sun there would be times when a man would sit in the temple of God Temple for himself showing himself that he was God he would come rule in the nation all these things how God's word has been perfect how the King Nebuchadnezzar right there and Daniel interpreted how those kingdoms for the Babylonians meet the Persians to the Greeks God's word is a true witness God's word said in the last days again the stress between the Nations there would come of falling away from the church men would rise up showing themselves and power and with power away from the church a form of godliness deny the real power of God just joining church he spoke of the church getting into that condition here we are at his house the church is in that very condition organization is in that same state right now any organizations are still on fire for God filled with the Holy ghosts there is no such a thing foreign Wars that's right notices it's all fallen in place come into her position types Hallelujah yes sir the following away it's also a sign according to the quote which is coldness yeah those are signs of apostasy yeah it's true hello hola yes hello yes amen amen so I guess if you don't want to be in the conditions we want the word of God burn in our hearts we want the Holy Ghost to keep on burning environment that's right hello amen amen amen is your life worthy of the Gospel yes now the time has come on foreign amen so that message people can see the same thing happening in our day people don't understand that there was there was something that was held back foreign amen he says can the program come up and pray for the boat so you're okay and the same man in his moment that was not only going to that church going around the world seeking this Unity for the economical accounts was that a judgment or foreign and the spirit continues it is hello amen amen deities but that Holy Ghost Power stays here foreign oh yeah it could not happen you know who else was there until the falling away until the church begins to get away from the spiritual feast and organize itself in the Revelation in the revelations with that church oh my goodness amen amen let it continue on Revelation did not continue on it did not stay with the church opening it amen amen they got away from the spiritual tweets and the message is talking about that great feast that was ready for us to come and sit at the Lord's table hallelujah amen and he said his servant one time two times and the third time he sent them out was to force something in Hallelujah foreign foreign oh help us chocolate sell bread amen how's your way Lord have your way Lord they got away from the spiritual peace and organize itself and the revelations without one mistake since the mark of the beast is a mark of a pastor says wow the mark of the beast is a mark in America of apostasis to reject the holy ghosts hanging to their church instead of walking in the wild instead of walking in my life and there's nothing left by Darkness 14 years that's right all right okay every evil of all the churches the evil evil that was in the first church age left over into this next one is just kept on going down until it finally ends up in complete apostasis in every church every little engine that started like in Genesis that's what the Bible says no man can say Jesus is the Christ foreign amen see them are true yes see the church says so that's true you don't know it yourself until the Holy Ghost has revealed it to you yeah not by intellectual yes amen when they as different as they use for night but the Jews know better than that so but I guess maybe it's the hour for it to come where it all has to go eat in this great Apostles amen amen City oh my brother and sister it matters Paul warned us he said the time was going to come when one will arise peace peace and then sudden destruction people are looking for someone to come and bring peace back in the Middle East amen and he said that the one that would come saying peace peace in that same scriptures he will come he said as a thief hey man brother and sister Hermanos the bride the Helga ain't gonna received her Thief in the Night amen amen he's gonna he's gonna come around of the Bride ain't in the night amen Hallelujah now I want to get something here because there's apostasy it is total darkness that lunar eclipse in 1964. he preached Hallelujah amen oh and he said that's a great sign yeah amen amen now all right the supposed to see is he says in the living to see a church age so this is a message of the last age this is a condition of the Liberty Church as it's in years it is not a personal message it is the spirit telling us where Jesus is left the church this is not the logical result if the word is put aside for Creeds the Holy Spirit been pose for popes Bishops presidents counselors Etc presidents Etc and the Savior set aside yes for a Works program Johnny Church some type of Conformity to a church what more can be done against him this is the apostasy amen Hallelujah amen a program of Works joining the church Conformity to a church system or foreign voting aside the word for agree I don't know what it is n't it counselors foreign I come in the name of my father and you receive me not you no matter Jesus prophesies to YouTube is going to come in his own name amen and here you'll receive yes oh Matthew 24 mentioned signs in the heavens right after he says he says amen the man of sin of prediction is La Luna lose what are we at church I wonder if you notice such a sign recently fulfilled and portrayed to the very truth that we have been discussing is that Jesus has been steadily pushed aside until the last stage is put on the outside recall that in the first age or the Church of the truth yet there was a little air called the Deeds of the nicolete that kept the circle is North Korea or of light then in the next Age The Darkness covered more of the circle is Eclipse ages now click on this okay the church shines a reflection of the Light of Christ here's the son the church is the moon thus this orb of light is the Moon it had decreased from almost a full moon uh decrease I think in the first thing is in the fourth age and almost and nothingness so that instead of light it was Blackness of apostasis and at the end of this age to shine says and Christ is on the outside of the church here is the sign in the sky the last eclipse of the moon was a total eclipse it won from a total darkness in seven stages in the seventh stage that's the book of room went to Palestine Palestine to make a holy tour of Jerusalem he was the first pope to ever go to jerusalemate see okay now he went to Jerusalem all right foreign now what is being shown as a sign amen amen ities that is opening the way for that man of sin foreign amen it's the church he said oh no brother no no he's strong he didn't he's as strong as you make them yeah oh my God but if you keep on letting him push you around he'll be bigger than you oh amen amen what if you're fed up with that yeah that's right foreign have a father yes Lord the sons of God because amen amen it's Genesis Chapman which took Moses these would come resisting the truth second Timothy this turn foreign now therefore endure heartless as a good soldier of Jesus Christ no man worth entangle is himself with the Affairs of this life that he may displease him who have chosen him to be a soldier says for masteries yet he is not crowned he said he strive for thou will increase for they will increase unto more ungodliness
