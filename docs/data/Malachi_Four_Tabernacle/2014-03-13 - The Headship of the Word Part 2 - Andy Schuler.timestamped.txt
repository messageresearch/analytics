[1:35] ever looked at is
[1:37] you ever looked into the face
[1:40] with the radiance like sunshine
[1:44] so is the Church of the Living God
[1:48] it's been born in the mud of fanaticism
[1:51] and chaos
[1:54] but she's wound her way through the
[1:56] crime
[1:59] and so she's on top of the things
[2:03] just waiting for her wings for the
[2:05] flights
[2:08] many shall run to and fro
[2:10] and the people that know their God shall
[2:14] do excellent yes

[3:05] reveal to his church
[3:08] revealed to his church
[3:11] that mystery of God
[3:13] revealed to his church
[3:16] wasn't hidden
[3:20] it was hidden until the time Amen in the
[3:25] Book of Revelation he said John don't
[3:26] write it
[3:29] up because there's coming a time
[3:36] God is
[3:38] God is waiting for us he's been waiting
[3:42] for two thousand years
[3:47] to get it this mystery
[3:51] what's been hidden under that who
[4:25] the spirit of God has worked the
[4:28] justifications
[4:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost under
[4:36] Pentecost
[4:38] and here it is
[4:43] the very same things it did when it was
[4:47] in Christ
[4:51] the church and Christ has become one
[4:55] yeah
[4:58] and as now a lot of people leave that as
[5:02] in brother Branch
[5:05] right yeah and it's easy to see him in
[5:09] there because he did those things
[5:14] come on bro my brother sister it's not
[5:16] just one member
[5:18] but it is the body yes sir
[5:21] amen amen the church and Christ has to
[5:25] become one right now
[5:29] as soon as they connect together
[5:34] that last link is
[5:37] she'll go through this guy
[6:07] the holy ghost
[6:13] in the baptism of it
[6:18] a deeper Shadow yeah
[6:21] um they thought that was it that was
[6:24] just a deeper Shadow
[6:28] now the Holy Ghost it is because the
[6:32] final restoration
[6:33] oh it's very person this is the person
[6:39] Christ is the word
[6:45] the Holy Ghost by the restoration
[6:53] forming signs and wonders like he did at
[6:57] the beginning
[7:01] he says you're gonna call me a holy
[7:03] rolly
[7:37] why is it that we can recognize
[7:41] all the fullness
[7:48] amen what we missed
[7:51] all the fullness of the word
[7:55] the godhead like they died
[8:03] this is not the physical coming there
[8:08] are groups that run off with that yeah
[8:09] they say there's no physical coming and
[8:12] they mix it all up we're not talking
[8:15] about that but we are talking about his
[8:18] fullness of his nature
[8:26] healing himself
[8:30] amen
[8:32] glory to God
[8:35] oh I'm so glad
[8:47] praise the Lord
[8:51] I want to read uh from Psalm chapter 27.
[8:56] we're going to finish up this morning on
[8:58] this thought
[9:01] go ahead and turn in your Bible
[9:05] sister when brother Brandon preached the
[9:07] Rapture message amen
[9:12] he preached from Psalm 27. and he took
[9:16] this as his
[9:17] textbook amen amen
[9:19] but he really didn't say much about the
[9:21] scripture
[9:25] but he preached what was in the
[9:27] scripture
[9:28] without saying that's what it was
[9:32] amen
[9:37] this is what we're looking for someone
[9:40] it's the change of our body the fullness
[9:44] is that right look at that but right now
[9:48] we are living a life of overcoming
[9:51] that will just be the last step of it
[9:55] look at your type mess with people
[9:58] right I mean Enoch didn't just all of a
[10:02] sudden you don't know go from zero to
[10:06] being gone
[10:07] the Bible says he walked with God
[10:10] and we know that brother Graham talked
[10:13] about it
[10:15] Enoch walked with God only he got so
[10:18] close that God said well just come up a
[10:20] little bit
[10:22] we are in a Rapture cycle yes
[10:27] amen we are walking into a Rapture
[10:32] we're on an Enoch walk
[10:34] we are walking with God and then one day
[10:38] we're gonna come so close
[10:43] and something's going to be quick
[10:46] amen amen and it's going to be
[10:48] resurrection power and a change of our
[10:51] bodies amen amen amen so yes the key to
[10:55] this boys then I want you to get this
[10:58] morning
[10:59] is that our Enoch
[11:04] walked
[11:05] walking under the headship of the word
[11:09] is our Rapture in progress
[11:14] we are walking into it
[11:18] I believe that amen that's what we're
[11:21] doing we are possessing Our Land foreign
[12:03] Psalm of David the Lord is my light and
[12:06] my salvation

[21:35] hallelujah
[21:36] amen I want to read you one last quote
[21:43] amen this is from Satan's Eden
[21:46] preached in 1965.
[21:48] how many believe we're in Satan's
[21:50] evening
[21:52] amen amen hallelujah notice how
[22:53] time of trouble amen
[23:55] thank you
[23:56] he got her to stop and to listen to him
[23:59] for a minute
[24:02] to his reasoning
[24:05] which we are commanded to cast down
[24:10] this is where it's being waged cast down
[24:14] reasoning
[24:18] foreign
[25:13] something that suited her reasoning
[25:19] he says I don't care what it is
[25:22] if it's against God's words
[25:31] him to be against God's word is
[25:33] Antichrist
[25:35] and brothers
[25:43] spirit and
[25:44] uh in the church in Iglesia right and
[25:48] withstand it
[25:50] the church will do the Greater Works she
[25:54] will be an invincible Army amen he will
[25:58] do the opposite of what he did
[26:00] amen amen Eve rejected the headship of
[26:04] the word amen
[26:07] we submit to the headship of the word
[26:12] God's word be against it
[26:16] that's your enemy anything that's
[26:19] against the word is your enemy
[26:23] that is
[26:24] the spirit that's anointing amen
[26:30] your enemy is the devil and his minions
[26:35] it's not people no it's not flesh and
[26:38] blood
[26:40] it remember Jesus could stand there with
[26:44] Peter
[26:45] one moment Peter receives Revelation
[26:48] and Jesus says Peter Flesh and Blood did
[26:51] not reveal this to you
[26:53] in heaven has revealed it to you and the
[26:57] next moment you see the momentum Peter
[26:58] says oh Lord surely you're not going to
[27:00] go die
[27:01] when he says give me behind me
[27:04] that's right amen yeah yeah he's not
[27:08] talking about Peter it's the spirit he
[27:12] was anointing him to say this it was
[27:15] against the words
[27:17] you say Jesus that's not very nice
[27:20] this is your this is your right hand man
[27:23] what you're calling him
[27:25] and you didn't pull him aside and do it
[27:28] quietly you did it in front of everybody
[27:33] right in front of the whole church
[27:56] that's a hard word
[28:00] but it had to be something like I said
[28:03] and Jesus said if you're against that
[28:05] that's Satan's Spirit of course
[28:09] amen amen
[28:12] he says if it's against God's word
[28:14] be against it that's your enemies
[28:18] anything that's against the word is your
[28:20] enemy
[28:21] everything that's for the word
[28:25] is your brother
[28:56] she wanted
[29:05] to understand
[29:08] you know one time uh brother and I will
[29:10] sorry I'm keeping you standing here in a
[29:13] moment okay maybe not one time there was
[29:15] a brother we were talking about the
[29:16] moving of the spirit in the in the
[29:17] meetings
[29:22] and he was kind of trying to reason it
[29:25] out a little bit
[29:26] you know how mechanics of it worked
[29:31] and and how you know because there are
[29:34] things naturally we can do
[29:37] to create an atmosphere the spirit of
[29:40] God to move but he was taking it a
[29:43] little too far in thinking and reasoning
[29:46] out the mechanics of how God's spirit
[29:49] moves
[29:51] and I had done a similar thing
[29:55] sometime before and the Lord rebukes and
[29:59] said you don't have to reason it you
[30:02] just have to believe it
[30:04] wow amen amen and so I told the brother
[30:07] I said brother
[30:08] try to understand
[30:11] you're not made to reason out God
[30:16] no God by reason
[30:19] too often we try to know God by
[30:22] reasoning we can't know him that way we
[30:26] know him by Revelation
[30:29] by his word by the Holy Spirit revealing
[30:33] his word
[30:34] amen amen
[30:36] so she pulled the veil from her eyes
[30:43] she wanted knowledge and to know what it
[30:47] was all about
[30:48] she might have even had good intentions
[30:51] she wanted to understand maybe how to
[30:54] serve God better okay
[30:57] so she pulled off the veil to see what
[31:00] it was all about
[31:02] listen to the devil and notice what a
[31:05] place that put her in because
[31:07] and they have done the same thing in
[31:09] each age thereafter
[31:12] always taking the intellectual side
[31:16] and has now built a kingdom of satanas
[31:22] notice I guess he's talking about the
[31:24] churches taking the intellectual side
[31:28] coming out from under the headships yeah
[31:32] build a kingdom of
[31:35] satanic knowledge
[31:37] his seed that he serves and has took the
[31:41] world to be an Eden
[31:45] amen amen and that's what has happened
[31:48] around us
[31:50] we live in Satan's Eden
[31:53] Eve got from out from under the headship
[31:56] Of The World
[31:58] God is restoring a bride in this hour
[32:02] and she is willingly submitting to the
[32:05] headship of the world
[32:07] he's coming back into that place where
[32:11] God is placing the holy Veil over here
[32:13] she's rejecting reasoning
[32:17] she's rejecting man's thinking
[32:20] Satan came down and said
[32:24] and defiled his children and now God is
[32:28] coming into Satan's evidence
[32:32] Instagram
[32:52] Heavenly Father
