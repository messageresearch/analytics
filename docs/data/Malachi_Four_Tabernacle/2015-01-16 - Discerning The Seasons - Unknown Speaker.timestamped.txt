[0:00] speaking to every
[0:03] believer to be ready
[0:07] always to give an
[0:09] answer of the hope that lies within
[0:12] you you understand so both
[0:16] scriptures are speaking of the same
[0:19] thing but one to
[0:22] ministers and other to every
[0:26] believer you understand so brother and
[0:29] sister
[0:31] to be
[0:33] instant as it says in second
[0:36] Timothy 4
[0:39] verse it says to be
[0:44] instant amen amen in
[0:48] season and out of
[0:51] season now
[0:53] this it it it shows us
[0:56] something it shows
[0:58] us that Paul
[1:00] knew listen to me he was able to know
[1:07] that in our
[1:08] lives and in the lives of the church in
[1:12] the lives of the body of
[1:14] Christ there are
[1:17] seasons there are different changings of
[1:21] the
[1:23] Season amen amen just like in the
[1:27] natural there is changing of season
[1:30] you understand so he is letting Timothy
[1:35] know that whether it's the
[1:39] season or it's out of
[1:43] season you need to
[1:46] preach you need to
[1:49] reprove you need to rebuke
[1:52] exort with all longsuffering and
[1:56] Doctrine amen amen so the word
[2:00] uh instant or to be
[2:03] instant
[2:05] means to be
[2:08] ready it
[2:10] means especially of a
[2:13] person that is coming upon one
[2:19] suddenly suddenly
[2:21] suddenly right when if they come and say
[2:24] brother you
[2:25] know ready to preach the
[2:28] word oh brother I haven't prayed you
[2:30] know I got to
[2:32] study that's good brother I see see what
[2:35] I'm saying but Paul is
[2:39] saying be
[2:41] instant in season and out of
[2:45] season yes yes in other words there's
[2:48] time to get
[2:50] ready amen and sometimes there ain't no
[2:53] time to get
[2:54] ready and I can say Amen to that
[2:57] especially being out you know
[3:01] in different
[3:02] parts and sometimes I mean you know
[3:06] you're going to go
[3:08] Minister but sometimes you don't know
[3:10] the schedule
[3:12] right right so you have to be
[3:15] ready you have to be ready at all time
[3:19] Pastor going to say brother you're
[3:20] preaching
[3:21] tonight right oh um I ain't ready what
[3:27] are you doing amen amen like like
[3:31] brother brother Larry KH told me one
[3:33] time Larry I I got to his
[3:36] house and I was going to sleep
[3:39] there and I told
[3:43] computer I still got a few more things
[3:45] that I have to pull
[3:47] out and I already had my message but I
[3:50] needed some more
[3:52] quotes amen amen and he said you know
[3:56] brother he was just playing around but
[3:58] it was true
[4:01] he said you know a
[4:03] soldier when he's out in the
[4:05] field he's got to have all his artillery
[4:12] ready he said you you don't come out
[4:15] here in the
[4:16] field to you know get ready supped to
[4:20] come
[4:22] ready amen amen that's true so the thing
[4:27] is this is what Paul is saying
[4:31] even if you're called on
[4:33] suddenly be ready to be at
[4:38] hand amen am that's what that means and
[4:41] then he says in in
[4:45] season right in season in the in the
[4:50] season in the
[4:51] time right which
[4:55] means when the opportunity
[4:58] occurs
[5:00] or when it's
[5:04] convenient and out of
[5:06] season just simply
[5:09] means you're not ready it's not the time
[5:14] it's not the
[5:15] season amen but you have to be ready
[5:19] anyhow brother bam said if we don't have
[5:23] nothing to say as a minister or even as
[5:27] a Believer he said you can
[5:30] testify of what God has done in
[5:33] you amen he said just tell of how God
[5:38] lit your
[5:41] T amen hallelujah amen so if we're
[5:45] Believers if we the bride of Christ we
[5:48] always have to be
[5:50] ready to give a
[5:52] hope Amen to to to give an answer of the
[5:57] hope that lies within
[5:58] us if there's something in us we can
[6:02] sure say
[6:04] something from the abundance of our
[6:07] heart our mouth can say something of
[6:11] God Amen something of what he's done in
[6:14] us something of what What the Lord Has
[6:17] revealed amen it doesn't have to be some
[6:20] great you know prepared
[6:22] message it it could be something simple
[6:26] it could be a simple
[6:28] testimony can be speaking to somebody
[6:31] and somebody can ask you amen amen well
[6:36] what what do you
[6:37] believe or how how is your faith or how
[6:42] do you see this or how do you see that
[6:46] we always must be ready to give an
[6:50] answer and Jesus said when he sent his
[6:54] disciples amen not what you to say for
[6:59] in that hour the father will put words
[7:02] in your
[7:03] mouth hallelujah amen will put
[7:07] words in your mouth to say that's right
[7:11] brother is that right you know he even
[7:14] commanded him commanded them not to do
[7:18] this right he told the disciples don't
[7:22] write a
[7:25] script amen
[7:28] amen
[7:30] M of course all things have a
[7:34] balance sure but the thing is what we're
[7:38] looking
[7:39] at is that we have to be
[7:42] instant in season and out of
[7:46] season amen so in order to do
[7:50] that we need to
[7:53] discern the
[7:57] seasons amen amen am that's what we want
[8:00] to speak of
[8:01] tonight
[8:03] Discerning the
[8:06] seasons
[8:09] Discerning the
[8:11] seasons amen amen I going know what
[8:14] seasons
[8:17] are amen amen maybe in Spanish you have
[8:21] to use two words but in English it's the
[8:22] same word
[8:25] see amen amen there's winter there's
[8:28] summer there's spring

[11:09] the work that God maketh from the
[11:12] beginning to the
[11:24] end hallelujah

[11:46] does what times he

[12:18] full Redemption
[12:21] comes and we go back to
[12:23] Eternity we will still be in his
[12:27] time Hallelujah because we have been
[12:31] accomplished the
[12:33] purpose of the Redemption
[12:36] plan amen amen now just to speak a
[12:40] little
[12:41] bit there's some
[12:44] people because we're speaking
[12:47] about
[12:48] Discerning the
[12:51] season amen there's some
[12:55] people that never is the right time
[13:02] they never seem to do
[13:06] anything because they
[13:12] procrastinate they do why do people
[13:17] procrastinate because they don't
[13:20] realize that they don't have
[13:22] forever to
[13:24] accomplish what they are here on Earth
[13:27] to accomplish
[13:31] amen amen they don't
[13:34] realize that they don't have
[13:36] forever to accomplish what they need to
[13:40] accomplish
[13:43] Moses was
[13:45] one who was once a great
[13:52] procrastinator amen amen he he would
[13:55] delayed too
[13:57] much is that right Amen to act to
[14:01] move amen
[14:04] amen is that right
[14:07] amen and the same
[14:10] one that was a great
[14:14] procrastinator he said this in Psalms
[14:19] 912 Psalms
[14:23] 92 he said teach us to number our days
[14:26] all right that we May gain a heart of
[14:36] wisdom amen teach us to number our days
[14:40] all right that we may gain a heart of
[14:47] wisdom now once that Moses
[14:51] knew
[14:53] amen the time on Earth of his life was
[14:59] limited he finally got under the
[15:03] way to
[15:06] accomplish what purpose of being here at
[15:11] 80 years
[15:14] old amen amen at 80 years
[15:19] old he finally got into the
[15:23] purpose of
[15:25] God for his
[15:27] life
[15:29] amen that's a long time but brother said
[15:33] it's never too late that's right hallelu
[15:36] hallelujah it's never too late he said
[15:39] look at
[15:41] Abraham
[15:43] 65 years
[15:45] old about 60 years old he began to be
[15:49] called from the
[15:50] Lord what about all the other
[15:53] years in his life he was a pagan he was
[15:57] an idol worshiper
[16:00] amen but it wasn't until the late years
[16:03] of his
[16:05] life that God called them you see so
[16:10] we're not to put that as an
[16:12] excuse because God already called us
[16:15] now and brother bam said the greatest
[16:20] thing that I regret in my
[16:24] life
[16:26] amen is not having serve the Lord at a
[16:30] younger
[16:32] age right amen so the earlier the
[16:36] better yes sir you can do more for God
[16:40] Amen that's right amen you can go
[16:43] through
[16:44] experiences Amen to bring you into
[16:49] growth amen and get there at a younger
[16:52] age to where you already been through
[16:55] certain
[16:56] things that God has taught you you God
[17:00] has revealed to you you know the plan
[17:03] you know your
[17:04] call and you have the strength to
[17:08] finally do it because a lot of brother
[17:11] bam says that the scripture teaches us
[17:14] Amen in
[17:16] Proverbs that one has the
[17:20] strength right but doesn't have the
[17:23] wisdom another one has wisdom but he
[17:26] doesn't have the
[17:27] strength what if you have
[17:31] both that's why the the the younger you
[17:36] start the more wisdom you
[17:40] obtain at a younger age and you'll have
[17:43] the strength to
[17:45] accomplish you
[17:47] understand
[17:49] yes oh brother you know I'm going to
[17:52] wait hallelujah hallelujah then by the
[17:56] time you finally get to that
[18:00] place Moses finally fully surrendered to
[18:05] God and he met the pillar of
[18:09] fire yeah Hallelujah Hallelujah and
[18:12] brother bam said 5
[18:15] minutes Moses in that
[18:17] presence changed his life he anointed
[18:21] his faith why Christ
[18:23] speak he anointed his faith and he send
[18:27] him out
[18:29] say the Lord hallelujah amen amen amen
[18:33] hallelujah hallelujah but
[18:36] notice on the other
[18:38] hand Amen on the other side of the
[18:44] spectrum there are those who think that
[18:49] any time is
[18:54] right see there's two sides to it exem
[18:58] there some that are
[19:02] procrastinators there's
[19:04] others that just think any time is
[19:08] right right
[19:11] now
[19:13] fine
[19:17] right there two
[19:20] extremes said there's a center of the
[19:23] road what are those who think any time
[19:26] is right
[19:31] that's caral
[19:35] mentality the other is just laziness and
[19:40] procrastination but these is is car on
[19:45] mind let's look at an
[19:47] example John St John real quick we're
[19:50] going to be reading some scriptures
[19:53] tonight hope like reading the
[19:57] Bible
[19:58] amen St John 7 verse
[20:02] one after these things Jesus walked in
[20:05] Galilee for he would not walk in
[20:09] jewry because the Jews sought to kill
[20:19] him now the Jews Feast of Tabernacle was
[20:22] at hand and his Brethren therefore said
[20:24] unto him depart hence and go into Judea
[20:27] that they disciples Also may see thy
[20:29] works that thou
[20:41] doest for there is no man that doeth
[20:44] anything in secret and he himself
[20:45] seeketh to be known openly for thou do
[20:48] these things show thyself to the
[20:57] world
[20:58] then Jesus said unto them my time is not
[21:01] yet come but your time is carnal flesh
[21:06] Brothers is always
[21:18] ready because verse five said neither
[21:21] did hisen believe in
[21:24] him who is he speaking of his flesh
[21:29] Brothers his own
[21:32] family did not believe in him but look
[21:35] what Jesus rebuked
[21:38] them my time is not yet
[21:41] come but your time is always
[21:47] ready amen amen so there's some that
[21:52] procrastinate and there's some that oh
[21:54] it's right now right now is the
[21:57] time right always right now right now
[22:01] time now but we got to
[22:04] discern the
[22:06] seasons Hallelujah am do you
[22:10] understand
[22:12] so
[22:14] notice that Jesus
[22:16] rebuked amen his flesh
[22:19] brothers because they did not
[22:23] deserve the
[22:25] season in which Jesus
[22:28] Jus was to go to
[22:32] Jerusalem Jesus knew as soon as I go
[22:36] into
[22:37] Jerusalem that's
[22:40] it amen amen amen amen so that's why he
[22:44] had to wait for the right time to walk
[22:48] into
[22:50] Jerusalem and the Bible says if if you
[22:53] read there he went in there
[22:56] secretly
[22:59] amen without nobody
[23:01] knowing see amen but his
[23:04] brothers wanted him to make a triumphant
[23:09] entrance hallelujah amen right here he
[23:15] is see but the thing
[23:19] is this wasn't the season for
[23:22] that there was a season when he did come
[23:26] in that way
[23:28] is that right but this wasn't the
[23:32] season amen and his Brethren weren't
[23:35] able to
[23:37] deserve the
[23:39] difference and this is something that we
[23:42] must learn as
[23:45] Believers and I hope God will help us
[23:47] tonight that we can
[23:50] receive some of these things into our
[23:54] hearts to help us understand
[23:58] and discern the
[24:00] seasons the mystery of God's
[24:03] time God's
[24:05] seasons are to be
[24:07] revealed to his bride how many believe
[24:10] that how many believe that God doesn't
[24:13] keep no
[24:14] secrets from his bride but he tells her
[24:18] this is what I'm going to do this is
[24:21] what I'm going to do next then after
[24:23] that I'm going do this then after that
[24:25] I'm going do
[24:26] this amen he doesn't keep no secrets
[24:30] from the Bride of Jesus Christ he
[24:32] Reveals His whole plan to her why so
[24:36] that she could know according to the
[24:40] conditions according to the
[24:42] signs this is a season in which he must
[24:46] do
[24:47] this and then be ready and an
[24:50] expectation for what he's going to do in
[24:53] that
[24:54] season amen you understand
[25:00] hallelujah hallelujah why brother you
[25:03] must
[25:05] understand that everything in the plan
[25:08] of God Is by
[25:13] season we read it right there
[25:14] Ecclesiastes
[25:17] 3 is that right for everything under
[25:21] Heaven There is a season
[25:25] amen so now notice
[25:28] who made the natural
[25:31] Seasons who made winter summer spring
[25:34] and and
[25:37] fall made the
[25:39] seon you go back to Genesis and you'll
[25:43] find he made the moon the
[25:49] stars for
[25:52] Seasons that what the Bible
[25:54] says amen who's the creat creator of
[25:59] seasons is
[26:01] God Amen so God
[26:04] himself for the spiritual work of his
[26:09] hands hallelujah hallelujah for his
[26:12] spiritual
[26:14] creation he has
[26:18] Seasons how many know
[26:20] that Amen brother Adam taught these
[26:23] things brother Adam taught there is a
[26:26] season
[26:28] for the
[26:30] resurrection and I got the quote right
[26:32] there I don't know if I'm going to be
[26:34] able to get to
[26:35] it because we got to understand the
[26:40] seasons amen have
[26:44] conditions yes let's look God's
[26:48] timing in your life can be
[26:51] discerned by
[26:54] determining what season you're in
[26:58] Hallelujah when you find
[27:00] out the
[27:02] season that you are in you can act
[27:08] accordingly you can act in
[27:11] preparation and you can act in
[27:14] expectation but if you don't know the
[27:17] season you don't know what to expect you
[27:20] don't know how to act you don't know how
[27:23] to approach
[27:24] God this is very important because this
[27:28] goes from a a body
[27:31] level from the bride local church to the
[27:36] individual believer to a minister to to
[27:40] our lives in Christ we must be able to
[27:46] deserve the
[27:48] seasons of God's time in our
[27:53] Liv because if we don't do that brother
[27:57] We'll be asking God to give us a
[28:01] spring when he wants us in
[28:06] Winter yeah hallelujah amen and we'll be
[28:10] oh how come there's no
[28:15] spring because it's not that

[30:53] here on
[30:55] Earth you know whether you never rise
[30:59] again if you're not born again because
[31:02] you haven't received your
[31:05] insign in your heart the evidence the
[31:09] holy spirit that if you die you'll raise
[31:13] back
[31:15] up so brother bam
[31:18] said my first Bible was
[31:23] nature amen amen
[31:25] hallelujah hallelujah
[31:27] he saw God in
[31:29] nature he saw God in the trees he saw
[31:32] God in the
[31:33] wilderness he saw God in
[31:36] nature he even wrote him a letter and
[31:39] tacked it on a
[31:40] tree Hallelujah because he believed that
[31:45] God was out there
[31:46] somewhere I know he's here there has to
[31:50] be a
[31:51] Creator a Divine being that has set all
[31:54] these things in order Hallelujah
[31:57] Amen brother says a
[32:01] testimony of a true
[32:03] witness there's other
[32:06] witness that we can call and one of them
[32:10] of a witness of God because brother bam
[32:14] is bringing
[32:16] Witnesses in this message that testify
[32:19] of God and he says another witness is
[32:23] the
[32:24] tree in the fall of the year
[32:28] when the autumnn
[32:29] time the
[32:31] leaf amen begins to
[32:34] fall and notice if we are born
[32:37] again we are a leaf on the tree of
[32:42] life and this tree that we look out here
[32:45] on the
[32:46] woods when life finally
[32:50] leaves out of the leaf it's because the
[32:55] season is over for the
[32:58] leaf and the life of the leaf
[33:03] leaves and it will drop down into the
[33:06] ground and we're all sure of that from
[33:09] our windows we can
[33:11] look the the
[33:13] leaves they turn different
[33:16] colors because the life has come out of
[33:20] the out of the leaf right so you look at
[33:23] it you see the climate change
[33:28] changes the
[33:29] atmosphere
[33:31] changes amen what you're seeing changes
[33:36] the leaves Begin to
[33:37] Fall life is
[33:40] leaving amen why because something
[33:44] cold is coming brother said that's
[33:49] why Cried Out said Lord God hide me
[33:55] under the Rock Hallelujah huj until thy
[33:59] wrath
[34:01] pass that's a type amen of the believer
[34:06] that hides
[34:07] himself in Christ and the Wrath the
[34:12] winter the cold
[34:15] weather that kills
[34:17] everything passes over but the life of
[34:22] that leaf goes down into the roots
[34:27] hallelujah hallelujah stays down in
[34:29] there in in in in a hidden
[34:33] place in a secret place until the Wrath
[34:37] passes Hallelujah and then after the
[34:40] Wrath
[34:41] passes he comes back
[34:46] out
[34:48] amen God is in nature
[34:50] friends and I read the first
[34:54] quote we can know that God is with us
[34:57] because of the
[34:58] seasons now listen and he
[35:03] says and
[35:05] today that gives us a great
[35:08] testimony hallelujah hallelujah as a
[35:10] witness of
[35:12] God of creation because that when we are
[35:15] in the
[35:19] season of mortal life raising our
[35:23] children
[35:25] marrying bringing forth am this is a
[35:28] life or the
[35:31] season of mortal life we have been
[35:36] born above from above but the body
[35:40] returns to the dust of the
[35:43] Earth the spirit goes
[35:45] up to where it come from the body goes
[35:50] back to where it come from hallelujah
[35:53] hallelujah to God who gave it there who
[35:56] come then there will come another
[36:00] season and that season will be in
[36:04] inmortal
[36:06] season Hallelujah when the Son of God
[36:09] Rises with healing in his
[36:12] wings it will be totally
[36:15] impossible to hold those bodies in the
[36:18] ground any longer they'll come forth in
[36:22] the brightness of the Son of
[36:24] God the very nature itself
[36:27] testifies of that so if we are a
[36:30] Christian if we are born of the
[36:34] spirit death can hold
[36:37] nothing but victory for us because this
[36:41] old corruptible
[36:44] body that Satan still has power
[36:49] over will drop into the dust of the
[36:52] Earth this is the wrong
[36:55] season of immort of moral
[37:00] season Immortal
[37:02] season is coming when the immortal one
[37:06] comes the immortal
[37:10] Spirits has
[37:12] returned from the
[37:14] earth come forth again in the
[37:18] resurrection for a great
[37:20] Millennium and shall shine in his
[37:22] glory everything on Earth gives
[37:26] testimony
[37:27] the sun rises in the East it shows the
[37:30] beginning of Life in the evening it sets
[37:34] down in the morning the birds
[37:37] awake and they're singing and they're
[37:40] happy and they're real they feel fresh
[37:44] and in the evening we're tired like
[37:50] tonight somebody say
[37:52] Amen when the sun
[37:55] sets they gives
[37:57] testimony that there is life and death
[38:00] the day was born a day is
[38:04] gone amen a tree
[38:07] lives a leaf
[38:09] drops God preserves The
[38:12] Roots the original life goes and stays
[38:16] into the
[38:17] roots that made leaves for
[38:22] shame it comes back again where did it
[38:25] come from only to rest and come another
[38:30] season the Little
[38:32] Flower that drops
[38:34] out the
[38:36] sea returns back to the
[38:39] ground somewhere that we don't not know
[38:42] where then it comes back up and it comes
[38:46] back out in another
[38:48] season it's life burial and
[38:52] Resurrection everything speaks of God
[38:56] gives
[38:57] testimony amen I have had the privilege
[39:02] of traveling around the world I've seen
[39:05] different
[39:06] religions I've heard different
[39:08] views and I've heard the
[39:11] Mohamad and the Buddhas and the SS and
[39:14] the
[39:15] James many hundreds of different views
[39:17] of
[39:19] religions and gods and goddesses and all
[39:23] those things but there's none of them
[39:26] not one of them not one of them that got
[39:29] one Speck of truth about
[39:32] it this Christian
[39:35] religion is the right
[39:38] religion because it speaks of death
[39:41] burial and
[39:44] resurrection and all
[39:46] nature Even Heaven itself
[39:50] testifies of this truth God's witness to
[39:53] his
[39:54] people every day
[39:57] that there is death burial and
[40:00] Resurrection each
[40:02] season passes over our heads that we see
[40:06] through the
[40:08] season death burial and
[40:10] Resurrection we know that is the truth
[40:14] Christianity basically is the
[40:17] truth and it gives
[40:20] witness you believe that hallelujah amen
[40:24] hallelujah hallelujah glory to God
[40:27] now brother if you would just pull with
[40:29] me
[40:31] tonight then we can
[40:33] see how this really comes down into
[40:38] us how it really comes down into the
[40:43] bride amen amen hallelujah because it is
[40:48] important to understand that throughout
[40:51] all the
[40:52] Scriptures it is teaching this Paul said
[40:57] in Galatians 4 Christ came in due
[41:02] season amen he says in
[41:05] Romans he died for the
[41:09] sinners in due
[41:12] time hallelujah hallelujah everything
[41:15] that Christ did he did in the season
[41:19] that God
[41:21] had and brother bam taught us spiritual
[41:25] food
[41:27] in due
[41:28] season Hallelujah there is a season for
[41:32] all things remember we preach amen
[41:37] rain in its due season so all of these
[41:41] things are showing us that the natural
[41:45] types of
[41:47] spiritual is that right so these
[41:51] Seasons Amen in our lives show us and
[41:55] reveal to us
[41:57] in the
[41:58] natural the tree does not reach
[42:03] maturity listen
[42:05] close the tree does not reach
[42:09] maturity in one
[42:13] season it has to
[42:16] go through
[42:19] seasons in order to
[42:25] mature
[42:27] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you
[42:32] understand so in the
[42:35] spiritual we cannot expect
[42:39] maturity if we're
[42:42] always uh kind of expecting just one
[42:48] season no we must understand that there
[42:52] is spiritual
[42:55] winter
[42:57] amen hallelujah amen amen is there
[43:01] spiritual
[43:03] winter amen we we've been preaching
[43:07] about it
[43:09] lately amen
[43:11] amen hallelujah hallelujah and then
[43:15] there's
[43:16] spring where there's
[43:19] abundance Hallelujah when everything is
[43:23] just
[43:25] perfect everything is nice the
[43:28] atmosphere is perfect amen amen
[43:31] everything
[43:34] flows
[43:37] amen but if we're always expecting
[43:42] spring when we begin to see
[43:47] fall we don't understand that that's a
[43:51] season that we must go
[43:54] through so we we have to get into that
[43:59] atmosphere amen amen what is the
[44:02] atmosphere I just mentioned
[44:05] it the life has to go down into
[44:11] the amen amen sometimes it's up here
[44:16] with the
[44:18] fruits amen amen oh showing the fruits
[44:23] on top of the
[44:24] tree amen amen by their fruits you shall
[44:29] know amen amen the fruits and the
[44:33] flowers
[44:35] blossoming amen amen but sometimes it's
[44:40] down in The
[44:42] Roots where no one
[44:47] sees but there's still
[44:49] life deep
[44:52] down they can look at the tree I
[44:58] said a much
[45:02] there doesn't look too
[45:06] pretty amen amen but
[45:11] Life The
[45:14] Roots
[45:17] said
[45:19] Jesus Cur
[45:23] the amen amen
[45:26] you know why he
[45:30] cursed because it was the
[45:34] season to give
[45:38] F and it wasn't
[45:43] giving
[45:45] hallelujah
[45:47] amen amen I had a little lemon
[45:52] tree at our house a lot of brothers know
[45:58] stay like that for I don't know how many
[46:01] years right remember that
[46:05] one we pled
[46:13] itay little
[46:19] flowers now I
[46:21] think brother has it at their
[46:24] house happens
[46:28] there amen
[46:30] hallelujah but the thing is seasons and
[46:34] Seasons went
[46:36] by and the tree never
[46:38] grew how many know about
[46:43] bamboo studed
[46:48] about amen amen if you study
[46:54] bamboo when the they plant bamboo in the
[46:58] ground
[47:01] seed the one that SWS it the one that
[47:04] keeps it down there and plants it in the
[47:08] ground he has to fully
[47:12] trust amen amen upon God's
[47:17] power I mean they don't look at it that
[47:19] way
[47:20] but they already know
[47:24] because it shows no
[47:29] signs it could pass
[47:32] months how know like like bean sprouts
[47:36] or different
[47:39] ones when you know when you plant
[47:41] something within a few
[47:43] days amen you already see the little
[47:47] right the little the little thing coming
[47:51] out you see results quick
[47:54] right not with
[47:57] bamboo you got to
[47:59] wait wait and wait you don't see nothing
[48:03] this is
[48:05] powerful there's one thing about bamboo
[48:10] though in the
[48:12] moment the
[48:14] season that comes out of the
[48:17] ground
[48:19] within I believe a
[48:22] day or a couple
[48:24] days it grows eight
[48:29] fet amen amen so that's the
[48:34] thing
[48:35] sometimes amen it looks like nothing's
[48:39] happening hallelujah hallelujah but deep
[48:42] down in there something is taking place
[48:45] that it can grow
[48:47] quickly and quicker than others that
[48:51] show life more
[48:53] quicker it you understand
[48:56] Hallelujah so all in nature brother is
[49:00] speaking of God's spiritual
[49:03] work in his
[49:06] body amen amen now listen let us turn I
[49:10] don't let us go to Acts chapter
[49:14] one hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[49:17] blessed be the name of the
[49:24] Lord

[49:35] for you to know the times or the seasons
[49:38] which the father haveth put in his own
[49:51] power amen amen so now look

[50:07] kingdom to Israel at this
[50:11] time
[50:12] brother I preached on this before
[50:15] brother mentions it how many how many
[50:19] know why they asked him
[50:21] that because the
[50:24] Jews were
[50:26] expecting that when the Messiah come he
[50:30] was going to come like he's going to
[50:32] come in his third
[50:35] coming amen hallelujah in his first
[50:39] coming they were waiting for him like

[51:07] Reign and push out the the
[51:09] Romans that's what the
[51:11] Jews were

[51:18] deserve the season where Adam said they
[51:22] were waiting for Jesus to come to the
[51:27] temple
[51:28] amen hallelujah am and come down a great

[51:45] third
[51:47] coming the thing is they weren't able to
[51:53] deserve the season
[51:56] hallelujah hallelujah and then even the
[52:00] disciples that had walked with Jesus for
[52:04] three years and a half they heard all
[52:06] his
[52:07] teaching they heard all his
[52:10] preaching they seen all the
[52:12] Miracles and then he dies he
[52:16] resurrects he speaks to them and now
[52:19] he's he's talking to them about going to
[52:23] Jerusalem to receive the holy power of
[52:26] God and they're worried
[52:29] about when are you going to restore the
[52:34] kingdom he said it's not for you to know
[52:39] the times and the
[52:41] season that God has put in his own power

[56:28] 17 Paul didn't write chapters and
[56:33] verses he wrote
[56:36] letters
[56:37] theologians put in verses and
[56:42] chapters amen he's writing a
[56:46] letter you understand it's
[56:51] continuity for the day of the Lord
[56:54] cometh
[56:56] the Lord himself shall descend from
[56:59] heaven with the Shout with the voice of
[57:03] Archangel with the Trump of God CH shall
[57:07] rise you see then he says but of the
[57:12] times and the
[57:14] seasons Brethren you have no need for me
[57:18] to
[57:20] ride oh that's powerful I don't know if
[57:23] you're catching it but that's
[57:28] powerful hallelujah it's
[57:32] powerful yeah if we
[57:35] fail to discern the
[57:40] season in our Liv will end
[57:44] up amen like many through the church
[57:50] ages like the Pentecostal
[57:53] church not able to to
[57:56] deserve the the the season in which the
[58:00] word is to be
[58:02] fulfilled for that
[58:06] hour and they're still wound
[58:09] up Amen in their own
[58:13] idea and their own condition and their
[58:16] own things and they're not able to
[58:19] discern the
[58:20] season has
[58:23] changed amen
[58:26] hallelujah hallelujah that's why Paul is
[58:28] saying here this day is
[58:31] coming Hallelujah the Lord himself is
[58:35] going to
[58:37] descend with a
[58:38] shout a message to
[58:42] prepare the voice of the
[58:46] resurrection and then top of God
[58:50] hallelujah
[58:51] hallelujah the dead in Christ shall rise
[58:55] first but of these times and these
[59:00] Seasons I'm not supposed to rise you
[59:03] don't have need to know the
[59:06] season Jesus told the disciples the same
[59:11] thing why because it wasn't to be
[59:15] revealed for that time hallelujah
[59:18] hallelujah but in the day Hallelujah
[59:21] Hallelujah from the Lord himself would
[59:24] come down
[59:25] he would make known the
[59:28] seasons and the times why because we
[59:32] have need for it
[59:34] now Hallelujah now we have
[59:38] need to understand the
[59:42] seasons and the times that's why the
[59:45] only one out of all the
[59:48] messengers that can preach about the
[59:51] church Ages was the last message
[59:56] because it was
[59:58] needful for us to know that there had
[1:00:01] been
[1:00:03] dispensations that there had been ages
[1:00:06] that there were Seasons that the church
[1:00:09] went through there was there was a time
[1:00:12] when the church went forth amen with
[1:00:15] power and then it died
[1:00:18] away and and the seed went in the
[1:00:21] ground is that right 6
[1:00:25] Millions went into the ground during the
[1:00:29] Dark Ages and then they begin to come
[1:00:31] back up with Luther with Wesley he
[1:00:36] taught us
[1:00:38] season times
[1:00:41] amen and he even set time from this year
[1:00:45] to this year from this year to this year
[1:00:48] why did he do that did you know that
[1:00:51] some of those
[1:00:52] Messengers didn't even
[1:00:55] live in those
[1:01:01] years study it how in the world would
[1:01:05] brother R put those age those
[1:01:09] times and then put the messenger for
[1:01:12] that
[1:01:15] age hallelujah
[1:01:18] hallelujah because he brother was
[1:01:21] teaching us seasons
[1:01:25] time amen he was letting us know what
[1:01:29] the disciples wanted to
[1:01:31] know he wanted to know what that first
[1:01:34] church over there Ephesus wanted to know
[1:01:39] what Paul said of the times and the
[1:01:41] seasons there's no need that I write
[1:01:45] unto you because you're going in the
[1:01:48] grave you're going down hallelujah
[1:01:51] hallelujah but when this takes place
[1:01:53] there will be a people on the Earth that
[1:01:56] will know what season they're
[1:02:00] in
[1:02:03] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:02:06] hallelujah brother there's many examples
[1:02:09] in the
[1:02:10] scripture that fail to recognize the
[1:02:15] season like
[1:02:17] zaras in Luke chap 1 you don't have to
[1:02:21] go
[1:02:22] there but in verse 20
[1:02:25] the angel Gabriel tells him you'll be
[1:02:30] deaf and dumb because you have
[1:02:34] disbelieved this
[1:02:36] word brother Adam
[1:02:39] said
[1:02:40] Zacharias had many scriptural
[1:02:45] examples that he as a
[1:02:47] priest should have
[1:02:49] known it was possible for God to do
[1:02:53] that he had Abraham and Sarah he had
[1:02:57] Hannah in the Bible he had uh uh uh
[1:03:01] Samson's
[1:03:03] parents they were
[1:03:05] old also
[1:03:08] amen and he being a
[1:03:11] priest should have known those
[1:03:15] scpt and brother says but the same Angel
[1:03:20] vised Mary and told her something that
[1:03:23] Wasing in the scripture oh my and she
[1:03:27] didn't doubt Hallelujah she said be it
[1:03:31] unto me in other words there wasn't an
[1:03:35] example of that ever having been done
[1:03:41] before tell me what virsion had
[1:03:43] conceived before
[1:03:48] that but she said be it unto
[1:03:51] me according to th word
[1:03:55] Hallelujah but because Zarah
[1:03:59] disbel in the promise of the word of the
[1:04:04] mighty angel that come down from heaven
[1:04:08] to give him a
[1:04:09] message glory to
[1:04:11] godu he said you'll be de and
[1:04:16] d and the scripture says
[1:04:19] until the
[1:04:22] seasons are accomplished

[1:05:02] brother there are seasons in our
[1:05:06] lives that after Satan TS
[1:05:11] us he
[1:05:14] departs for a season yeah Luke 4:
[1:05:19] 13 after
[1:05:22] Satan tempted Jesus for 40
[1:05:25] days the Bible says then the devil

[1:05:53] understand The Seasons natural spiritual
[1:05:56] natural

[1:06:05] 20 when the angel comes down binds the
[1:06:10] devil for a thousand
[1:06:13] years and then the Bible says brother
[1:06:16] talks about it questions and
[1:06:18] anwers is to be
[1:06:22] loose for a
[1:06:27] season it doesn't say much
[1:06:30] time it doesn't even give time it gives
[1:06:34] a time of a thousand
[1:06:36] years and then there's a
[1:06:38] season that is not eternity
[1:06:42] yet but it ain't the
[1:06:45] Millennium there's this little
[1:06:48] season where he's let

[1:07:45] was a
[1:07:46] millennium the time of war is go
[1:07:51] and you understand

[1:08:04] fight
[1:08:07] hallelujah it's time to get your
[1:08:10] sword and start
[1:08:14] fighting Hallelujah but that's when
[1:08:17] people that don't discern the
[1:08:20] season that the local church is going
[1:08:23] through
[1:08:25] am or the individual believer is going
[1:08:28] through or the bride in

[1:09:16] everything we have to understand that
[1:09:19] we're in a time of
[1:09:22] War brother Bram

[1:09:26] amen it's a
[1:09:28] time to stand in this hour because the
[1:09:32] secret catching away of the
[1:09:35] Lord is at hand and he read the same
[1:09:40] scripture that we just read first
[1:09:47] Thessalonians and he said this is my
[1:09:50] text but you know how brother R read it
[1:09:54] just like we read we read first
[1:09:57] Thessalonians
[1:09:59] 5 and then he went
[1:10:03] back to first Thessalonians
[1:10:07] 4 just like we read
[1:10:10] tonight that's how he
[1:10:12] read the sudden secret going away of the
[1:10:18] church and then he reads this he says I
[1:10:21] want to take my
[1:10:22] text
[1:10:24] the
[1:10:26] subject the secret catching away sudden
[1:10:30] catching away of the
[1:10:32] church he reads the scriptures and then
[1:10:35] he
[1:10:37] says if you wish to look across the
[1:10:41] page it is so geographically arranged in
[1:10:45] your
[1:10:47] Bible to the 16th 17th and 18th
[1:10:52] verse of the verses of the fourth
[1:10:55] chapter of first
[1:10:57] Thessalonians for the Lord himself and
[1:10:59] then he
[1:11:01] reads then he said may the Lord add His
[1:11:04] blessings to the reading of his holy
[1:11:06] word this is unusual thing to speak
[1:11:10] of the subject like
[1:11:12] this but that I come down to minister to
[1:11:16] the
[1:11:17] sick there's a greater
[1:11:20] sickness Than Physical sickness and it's
[1:11:24] much more
[1:11:25] essential then we be
[1:11:28] well for this great
[1:11:31] event that is fixing to take place than
[1:11:34] it would ever
[1:11:36] be even if we fall asleep in the
[1:11:39] Lord if we die before it
[1:11:43] happens it is much
[1:11:46] more
[1:11:47] better to be healed and
[1:11:51] whole be ready
[1:11:54] I'd rather be a sick
[1:11:56] man physically and ready for the L
[1:12:00] coming of the Lord then to be a a healed
[1:12:05] man and not ready to go with the
[1:12:09] Lord hallelujah amen
[1:12:14] amen hallelujah hallelujah I know you're
[1:12:17] tired but I'm going to finish quick if
[1:12:19] you help
[1:12:21] me wow amen amen I'd rather be a sick
[1:12:27] man than to be a a well man and not go
[1:12:32] with the Lord but however it be God is
[1:12:36] so willing that he we both be well and
[1:12:41] ready soul and body for he forgives our
[1:12:47] iniquities and he heals our
[1:12:49] sins he died for a compound purpose and
[1:12:54] I'm thinking of this subject the sudden
[1:12:57] and
[1:12:59] secret people live today as though just
[1:13:03] before the coming of the
[1:13:05] Lord that he was going to send a host of
[1:13:08] angels and down into all the
[1:13:13] newspapers and he was going to give us a
[1:13:16] year
[1:13:18] announcement in
[1:13:20] advance that he's coming on a such and
[1:13:23] such a
[1:13:24] J Jesus will arrive and broadcast it on
[1:13:27] the
[1:13:28] radio and put it on the television and
[1:13:32] everywhere just the day and just the
[1:13:34] hour that he's
[1:13:35] coming that's the way people live
[1:13:39] today in other words they're ready
[1:13:42] they're waiting for
[1:13:44] somebody to say brother you know it's
[1:13:47] this time is that time but he says the
[1:13:51] church must know the SE
[1:13:56] am hallelujah hallelujah Billy Billy
[1:13:59] Paul had the dream Billy and he said
[1:14:03] we're living in the
[1:14:04] morning we're leaving in the morning
[1:14:09] amen and Billy Paul told him
[1:14:11] daddy no one knows the day or nor the
[1:14:14] hour he says I didn't say the day or the
[1:14:17] hour I said we're living in the
[1:14:21] morning it's the season
[1:14:24] we have to know the season by what by
[1:14:27] the
[1:14:28] conditions by the
[1:14:30] atmosphere that must be
[1:14:32] created in order for those
[1:14:35] things to be
[1:14:38] there did you imagine the biblical
[1:14:41] days the Son of God passing
[1:14:44] through
[1:14:46] Hallelujah he would come to this notable
[1:14:49] place called
[1:14:51] betesda in the Hebrew Tong
[1:14:54] had five
[1:14:55] porches and a sheep it was a sheep
[1:14:59] market and there was a great phenomen of
[1:15:01] that
[1:15:02] day the people
[1:15:04] believed that there was an angel capital
[1:15:08] A that would come down out of Heaven A
[1:15:12] Certain
[1:15:14] season hallelujah amen let us turn in
[1:15:17] our
[1:15:18] Bible hallelujah hallelujah St John
[1:15:22] 5 oh St John 5 verse
[1:15:28] 4 and the scripture
[1:15:34] says for an angel went down at a certain
[1:15:38] season into the pool and troubled the
[1:15:41] water whosoever then first after
[1:15:43] troubling of the water Ste and was made
[1:15:45] whole of whosoever disease he
[1:15:52] had
[1:16:00] amen amen
[1:16:03] season the angel would come down at a
[1:16:07] certain
[1:16:09] season now brother Bram said I'd rather
[1:16:12] be
[1:16:13] healed and made
[1:16:16] whole for the coming of the Lord for the
[1:16:20] Rapture
[1:16:22] spiritually
[1:16:23] and to be
[1:16:26] healed naturally and not
[1:16:30] go see it's
[1:16:33] Seasons he would come down
[1:16:36] Seasons this is the message Church of
[1:16:38] the Living
[1:16:41] God to trouble the
[1:16:43] water and this
[1:16:46] pool is where they would wash the
[1:16:52] Sheep
[1:16:53] was just around the
[1:16:55] pool the size of this building perhaps
[1:16:58] certain Seasons the the water become
[1:17:04] chopped and it had been said by someone
[1:17:08] that there was an angel which would do
[1:17:11] this chopping of the
[1:17:12] water the troubling of the water to some
[1:17:16] people it was only a
[1:17:18] Superstition it was not written in the
[1:17:21] scriptures that God was going to do
[1:17:22] anything anything like that so many
[1:17:25] people would not believe it but many
[1:17:27] people they believed it it was truth
[1:17:31] because it produced
[1:17:32] results the first person stepping into
[1:17:35] the
[1:17:36] water being with some
[1:17:39] ailment with faith the virtue of the
[1:17:43] water the angel the phenomena of it
[1:17:47] which people Tau was just the wind going
[1:17:50] around the
[1:17:52] wall a certain way the current would be
[1:17:54] flowing through the
[1:17:56] water it would make the choppy
[1:17:59] water but the strange thing is that when
[1:18:02] a person had faith and stepped into the
[1:18:07] pool amen The Chopping would
[1:18:10] cease and the person would get well of
[1:18:14] whatsoever disease they
[1:18:16] had see but they could see the
[1:18:20] results they could see the results
[1:18:23] so they believe that God has sent an
[1:18:25] angel
[1:18:27] down hallelujah hallelujah now as it is
[1:18:30] written in the
[1:18:31] scripture we believe that it was an
[1:18:35] angel we Christian people because the
[1:18:38] Bible said it was an
[1:18:40] angel amen this new testament wasn't
[1:18:45] written they just walk by Steps of
[1:18:48] Faith like we do today in another age
[1:18:53] Steps of Faith but when our
[1:18:56] Master come by it was God's provided way
[1:18:59] for Healing The Sick
[1:19:02] body God has
[1:19:05] Seasons he has
[1:19:07] provision for each season and he made
[1:19:10] for that certain
[1:19:13] generation when Charles
[1:19:15] finny to my way of thinking was one of
[1:19:18] the greatest
[1:19:20] ministers since St Paul
[1:19:23] he claimed to have one million souls to
[1:19:27] Christ Dwight moody in his day Charles
[1:19:30] finny was a
[1:19:32] lawyer educated man he was God's message
[1:19:35] to the world in his
[1:19:37] day educated man who got hundreds of
[1:19:40] lawyers
[1:19:43] together and read his
[1:19:46] biography all the people who read those
[1:19:48] things religious
[1:19:50] books it's a masterpiece
[1:19:53] then Along Came dght
[1:19:55] Moody which is a very illiterate
[1:19:58] unlearned
[1:19:59] man his grammar was very poor but he was
[1:20:04] God's message for that
[1:20:06] age in each age God has a
[1:20:09] message so there's
[1:20:11] Seasons Hallelujah in which God deals
[1:20:14] with the
[1:20:16] generation in a certain way Hallelujah
[1:20:19] huj and he use the example of this Ang
[1:20:23] coming down stirring the waters God send
[1:20:26] an angel down out of Heaven to come and
[1:20:29] stir the water in a certain season that
[1:20:34] whoever would go in there they would be
[1:20:36] made whole
[1:20:39] Hallelujah AMJ oh brother how tremendous
[1:20:43] it is today that the angel of the Lord
[1:20:47] the Lord himself has descended from
[1:20:50] Heaven to S the waters

[1:20:57] the ready for the Rapture Ready for the
[1:21:01] secret suddening going
[1:21:04] away Hallelujah but that Hess amen it's

[1:21:10] healing in the body but it's something
[1:21:13] spiritual it's being made whole being

[1:21:20] that's what this angel come down to do
[1:21:24] in this hour in this season he come out

[1:21:35] the coming of the
[1:21:39] Lord blessed be the name of the Lord and
[1:21:43] the word there that is used make
[1:21:46] whole in the Greek is
[1:21:50] hug amen means a
[1:21:55] metaphor which
[1:21:57] means amen a
[1:22:00] teaching which does not deviate from the
[1:22:06] truth the very word that is used in St
[1:22:10] John
[1:22:12] 54 the person were made
[1:22:17] whole of whatsoever disease they
[1:22:20] had what does that mean

[1:26:31] season the elect of
[1:26:33] God seen it in Noah's
[1:26:36] time and
[1:26:38] Moses
[1:26:45] Inus
[1:26:47] pcal because that was the seed that was
[1:26:51] on the Earth when this inspiration was
[1:26:53] being poured
[1:26:56] out while the inspiration poured
[1:27:00] out today to gather the bride
[1:27:04] together it's only those who are
[1:27:08] elected will see
[1:27:12] it now
[1:27:15] inspiration has to
[1:27:17] strike and we are not living in Luther's
[1:27:21] age
[1:27:24] pcal but we are living in the evening
[1:27:28] time in the time of the calling out of
[1:27:30] the
[1:27:32] Bride just as it was
[1:27:34] hard for the Catholics to see Luther for
[1:27:39] the Luthers to see

[1:27:51] age amen I say so it is hard for people
[1:27:56] in the
[1:27:57] message to realize what season we're
[1:28:01] in it's always been that way because
[1:28:05] it's poured upon an elected
[1:28:09] seed and that only amen amen the Bible
[1:28:13] teaches that they can't see it Jesus
[1:28:17] even prayed for
[1:28:18] them they was blind and they didn't know
[1:28:21] it but Revelation tells
[1:28:24] us this Lan age when he was put out of
