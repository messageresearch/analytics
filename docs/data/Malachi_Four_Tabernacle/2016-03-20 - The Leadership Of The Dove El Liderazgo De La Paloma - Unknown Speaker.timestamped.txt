[15:04] days that Jesus
[15:06] came from Nazareth of
[15:08] Galilee and was baptized of John in
[15:20] Jordan and straight away coming up out
[15:22] of the
[15:24] water he saw the heavens
[15:27] open and the spirit like a dove
[15:31] descending upon
[15:39] him and there came a voice from Heaven
[15:43] saying Thou Art my beloved Son in whom I

[16:08] confess he says and and one of the
[16:11] reasons while why God was
[16:15] pleased with Enoch he had a
[16:18] testimony before he
[16:20] left that he pleased God in Hebrews says
[16:25] without
[16:26] faith it is impossible
[16:29] to please God Enoch had faith brother
[16:33] bam said it was his
[16:35] confession that pleased God Amen that
[16:39] was his
[16:40] testimony his
[16:43] confession amen amen and brother B said
[16:46] he his his

[24:22] reality of the message of the

[24:32] beginning he cursed the
[24:36] Pharisees amen God hates
[24:40] religion he hates the

[24:52] the message as a religion to just come
[24:56] to church and just do our duty and just
[25:01] be there brother bam said the reason
[25:04] people are
[25:05] dying in the
[25:07] pews where they're sitting it's because
[25:10] they don't want to take the
[25:14] prescription amen why is the daughter of
[25:17] my
[25:18] people how why is she not
[25:21] recovered there is bomb in

[25:47] die on the very
[25:49] doorstep of the
[25:51] doctor that has the
[25:53] medicine for your cure it's no good just
[25:58] to get to the
[26:00] doorstep of the doctor or just to go
[26:04] into his office and sit there you've got
[26:07] to take the
[26:10] prescription that he gives you and it's
[26:13] the same thing when we come here it's
[26:16] not enough just to come through those
[26:19] doors and sit down and and sing a little
[26:22] song and hear the word a little bit not
[26:26] enough you got to take the
[26:29] prescription amen hallelujah and I
[26:32] believe that the prescription for this
[26:35] hour for this day for this time is the
[26:39] message of the
[26:43] hour hallelujah amen amen that's the
[26:48] prescription amen hallelujah what do I
[26:50] need brother let me look at the
[26:54] prescription let me see what it

[27:09] that right amen amen amen that's what it
[27:13] is it's the truth
[27:15] am hallelujah
[27:18] hallelujah we believe that the
[27:21] dove has come down in this day
[27:23] also is that
[27:25] right amen
[27:29] and the
[27:30] dove come
[27:32] upon the prophet in this
[27:35] day
[27:37] amen and begin to lead
[27:40] him to many
[27:43] things amen as the first grain of wheat
[27:47] he was leading him to that faith for
[27:51] this hour amen amen hallelujah brother
[27:56] sister let's look at this for a little
[27:59] bit the dove descended Upon
[28:04] Jesus amen
[28:07] amen God and man become
[28:10] one it was a uniting
[28:13] time how many know that brother bam said
[28:15] in the Easter
[28:17] seal that Jesus had to go to the
[28:21] Jordan he had to go to the
[28:24] Jordan amen amen to receive the Holy
[28:27] Ghost
[28:31] amen Oh my he had to go to
[28:35] Jordan to receive the Holy
[28:40] Ghost we have to understand
[28:45] something and this is what we got to
[28:48] understand when we look at the life of
[28:51] Jesus
[28:52] Christ he is not only showing
[28:55] us or revealing to us
[28:59] God right but he is also showing
[29:03] us the
[29:05] way that
[29:09] God the way that God redeemed
[29:13] him he was to redeem the rest of the
[29:17] sons he's also showing us that the way
[29:20] he was
[29:21] born the rest of the sons must be born
[29:24] the same
[29:26] way
[29:28] he is showing us that the way he was a
[29:32] son we are to be Sons
[29:36] also the way that he pleased the
[29:40] father he is our
[29:42] example to show us how to please the
[29:47] father you
[29:49] understand he is showing
[29:51] us amen and this the same thing when we
[29:55] look at that same same Ministry in our
[29:59] day we got to understand that we got to
[30:03] understand that the way God
[30:06] dealt with the prophet of
[30:09] God he he he was setting an
[30:13] example for the rest of the
[30:16] seed in this age because he is the first
[30:20] grain to go through that
[30:23] process and come to
[30:26] maturity and come to the
[30:28] fullness of the stature of Christ and
[30:32] then from there amen be taken off the
[30:35] seene because there's no need for him to
[30:40] be here until the rest of the
[30:43] seed come up to the same
[30:45] place he has
[30:48] reached the limit as as Abraham's
[30:54] seed it's full Redemption
[30:57] it's
[30:58] Perfection it's it's
[31:03] adulthood amen
[31:05] amen and when we look at that it's the
[31:08] same
[31:09] thing amen what God did to brother
[31:14] brandham he is showing
[31:17] us he not only come to reveal to
[31:20] us who God was how Jesus was but he's
[31:25] also showing us through his life how God
[31:30] was going to deal with his seed in this
[31:34] age amen amen how amen he was GNA we
[31:38] were going to come under that prophetic
[31:42] anointing how he was how he was going to
[31:44] be
[31:45] dealt be led through the
[31:48] word how he would see one thing but then
[31:52] the Lord would open the
[31:54] word and show him the fullness
[31:57] of the
[31:59] Revelation how all of those
[32:02] things that he went through were there
[32:06] for our
[32:08] example he let his
[32:11] life he let his
[32:14] life go through certain
[32:17] areas he let his life amen amen to
[32:23] certain
[32:24] places amen made them pass through
[32:27] certain
[32:28] things and then show us how God's power
[32:33] how God's
[32:35] leadership during those times brought
[32:38] him out amen With Victory showed him a
[32:43] lesson and brother randam was
[32:46] one to come and tell us what he went
[32:50] through his
[32:52] experience and how God was dealing with
[32:56] him was training him was bringing him
[33:01] Amen to that place how many understand
[33:05] that to show us how to be a faithful
[33:09] servant to show us how to be a son in
[33:14] this age to show us how to please the
[33:19] father in this age amen
[33:23] amen don't just look at him as one that
[33:27] come to reveal to us
[33:30] God but look at him also as one that
[33:34] come to show
[33:35] us how to walk as Sons as Daughters of
[33:41] God and be led of the
[33:43] spirit in this age do you believe
[33:47] that Romans 8
[33:52] says in chapter
[33:55] 8 verse 14 we know the
[33:59] scripture for as many are as are led by
[34:02] the spirit of God they are the sons of
[34:07] God so Jesus in the scripture that we
[34:12] read said was led of the
[34:15] spirit amen amen to the
[34:19] Wilderness what did we
[34:21] read all that are
[34:23] led by the spirit these are the sons of
[34:29] God so he is showing us this is the
[34:32] point I'm trying to make that he is
[34:34] showing us how he was led as a
[34:39] son amen amen because we as Sons must be
[34:45] led
[34:47] to do you
[34:49] believe that that same
[34:52] do that led Christ Into the Wilderness
[34:56] was lead leading the prophet in this
[34:59] day amen he says it
[35:05] himself so when I read the
[35:08] scripture verse
[35:11] 14 what I read is that the
[35:16] Eagles are led by the
[35:20] dove
[35:21] amen all those that are
[35:24] eagles shall be led by the
[35:29] Hallelujah is that
[35:31] right when we go to St John
[35:37] 16 verse
[35:40] 13 St John
[35:46] 16 let's read the
[35:50] scripture St John
[35:53] 16 verse
[35:55] 13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth
[35:59] is come he will guide you amen into all
[36:04] Truth for he shall not speak of
[36:08] himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[36:10] that shall he speak and he will show you
[36:13] things to
[36:25] come so the spirit of
[36:28] Truth is the
[36:31] dove Allelujah is the
[36:34] guide
[36:36] amen that's always been the
[36:39] dove it's always been the
[36:43] guy it's always been the pillar of
[36:46] fire in every age in the first Exodus it
[36:51] was the dove leading
[36:54] Moses the eagle amen amen amen in the
[36:59] days of Noah it was the dove leading the
[37:05] ego Noah into a new
[37:08] world Hallelujah and brought back the
[37:12] evidence of the new
[37:15] world Amen it's always been the
[37:19] dog but we are
[37:22] promised in this hour the spirit of
[37:26] Truth
[37:27] how many understand
[37:28] that we got to understand that the
[37:31] spirit of Truth was promised for this
[37:35] days in the message a guy brother bam
[37:39] said there was many things that were
[37:43] left undone there was a lot of
[37:46] confusion on marriage and divorce there
[37:50] was a lot of
[37:51] confusion on on on uhhh the Trinity
[37:56] there was there a lot of confusion on
[37:58] many things of the
[38:00] scripture amen amen but he said that is
[38:04] the
[38:04] reason that God had to
[38:07] open the
[38:09] seals to loose the spirit of
[38:13] Truth amen there is a
[38:18] loosing of the holy spirit in this last
[38:22] day and that
[38:24] loosing of the Holy Spirit
[38:27] is the
[38:29] message the revelation of the
[38:32] word
[38:34] loing the same
[38:36] anointing that led the prophet to the
[38:40] people amen so that the people not be
[38:45] bound by denominational
[38:48] rivers

[38:54] denominational Rivers
[38:57] you see you cannot no
[39:02] denomination can
[39:04] actually bind the Holy
[39:07] Spirit impossible but you got to
[39:11] understand how the prophet for what he
[39:14] is saying in Feast of the trumpets he
[39:18] said the Holy Spirit has been
[39:21] bound for 2,000 years almost 2,000 years
[39:26] at the door of Creeds and
[39:29] dogmas that the Holy Spirit can't work
[39:33] in the
[39:35] church but then he
[39:37] says but now the
[39:39] clouds have fade away the sun has risen
[39:45] again the same light that shine in the
[39:49] East with Jesus Christ has shined again
[39:53] in the west it shall be light in the
[39:56] even
[39:58] even he says and now the same light the
[40:02] same
[40:03] gospel the same
[40:06] Ministry has come back he says and that
[40:10] brings a
[40:12] loose of the holy spirit so that it can
[40:16] work and lead the Church of
[40:20] God Amen that's what this message has
[40:23] come to

[50:57] the mighty Angel come down and put one
[51:00] foot on the land and one on the

[51:07] in Revelations
[51:09] 13 there was a
[51:11] beast that come out of the
[51:15] Earth in Revelation
[51:18] 17 there was a Beast come out of the
[51:22] water and when this Mighty angel
[51:26] Christ the angel of the Covenant come
[51:29] down he put one foot on the Beast that
[51:34] comes out of the earth one foot on the
[51:37] Beast that comes out of the
[51:39] water that's
[51:41] Dominion that's

[52:13] when when he does that that's it brother
[52:17] it's full
[52:18] Dominion it's full
[52:20] control and then Christ comes down and
[52:23] says I have come down
[52:26] to do this to
[52:28] claim what I died for to claim what I
[52:34] paid the price
[52:36] for come out of her my

[52:57] Christ and those great Powers those iron
[53:01] bars begin to break amen it's the time
[53:05] of

[53:10] Freedom Satan has no more
[53:14] power upon the Bride of Jesus
[53:20] Christ what are you afraid of brother no
[53:24] no doubt
[53:26] in the natural if you would be walking
[53:28] through a
[53:29] Wilderness like Jesus not just for one
[53:32] day not just for two days walking
[53:36] through the
[53:36] Wilderness amen
[53:39] fasting walking through the
[53:42] Wilderness walking and walking amen amen
[53:46] and you see all of a sudden there comes
[53:49] a wild
[53:51] beast Hallelujah there Jesus is walking
[53:55] he says
[53:56] Lord you are leading
[53:59] me that John he saw that Dove come up me
[54:04] and now you're leading me I don't know

[55:05] Jesus God is leading you no I'm by
[55:09] myself in this trial in this temptation
[55:14] no one knows what's going in my
[55:17] mind I'm looking at those
[55:19] stones and I'm imagining some warm
[55:23] bread I'm looking at this at this great
[55:26] uh uh uh
[55:28] Temple and I want to jump off no one
[55:31] knows my
[55:32] battles no one knows what I'm going
[55:35] through but the angels are ministering
[55:39] to
[55:42] me glory to God amen
[55:47] amen glory hallelujah how many believe
[55:54] that
[55:56] amen that's right
[55:58] Amen brother
[56:01] sister when we look at this we must
[56:05] understand the spirit of Truth was to
[56:08] lead
[56:09] us to guide
[56:11] us into all
[56:14] truth brother
[56:17] sister no matter what thing you're
[56:19] facing in
[56:23] this you have to understand
[56:26] understand if you have
[56:28] done what God
[56:30] requires like we heard this morning if
[56:33] you have
[56:35] confessed if you have put it under the
[56:38] blood amen amen things in your
[56:43] life that he has
[56:47] come to attack you to bring in your
[56:52] mind this fear this doubt these things
[56:58] to try to bring you to a
[57:04] weakness and in that
[57:06] weakness once he sees that he says now I
[57:10] got
[57:12] it now I've got him now I know where to
[57:15] hit
[57:17] him and be
[57:19] sure that that's where he's going to hit
[57:22] you but brother Ram said
[57:25] God wants to take our
[57:29] weaknesses and he wants to use
[57:32] that to
[57:34] overcome the
[57:36] enemy
[57:38] amen are you hearing
[57:40] me
[57:42] hallelujah
[57:46] amen brother and
[57:48] sister how many
[57:50] believe that the dove is leading us
[57:57] since the beginning where this where the
[58:00] Bible says in Genesis 1 the spirit of
[58:03] God moved upon the
[58:06] waters how many
[58:08] know that that very word in in the
[58:14] original
[58:15] means the spirit of
[58:18] God
[58:21] fluttered over the
[58:23] waters and I confirmed it with a
[58:27] message every time brother Bram talks
[58:29] about
[58:30] that brother Bram
[58:32] says God had planted the
[58:35] seeds in the Earth but it was without
[58:38] form and
[58:40] void it was it was just a
[58:44] chaos amen amen power of
[58:47] transformation remember
[58:50] chaos
[58:52] Darkness like this age he said but then
[58:56] the spirit of God he says like a
[59:00] dove begin to come over the
[59:09] waters he said it begin to call
[59:13] forth what he had
[59:15] planted he had to create this
[59:18] atmosphere so that the
[59:20] seed that he had planted the word had to
[59:25] come forth and brother that's what we
[59:27] got to
[59:28] realize that that dog
[59:32] fluttering over the seed in this hour
[59:35] will bring you to your
[59:38] manifestation to the
[59:40] manifestation of the sons of
[59:43] God that's why he said in Isaiah
[59:46] 60 the glory glor amen amen of the Lord
[59:52] the glory GL of the new new and Unseen
[59:57] World is shining Upon
[1:00:00] Us brother Bram said from
[1:00:03] Mortal to
[1:00:06] immortality amen amen such that are
[1:00:10] dead by
[1:00:12] the amen
[1:00:14] amen they are
[1:00:18] quickened amen amen there's quickening
[1:00:22] power you believe that dove
[1:00:25] was with
[1:00:26] Abraham L
[1:00:28] Abraham out of of the
[1:00:32] calans and that D was leading him to the
[1:00:37] land amen and kept leading him and when
[1:00:41] he met
[1:00:43] MDC hallelujah hallelujah it was the
[1:00:45] dove that led
[1:00:46] him when he met
[1:00:48] Elohim them human flesh it was the dove
[1:00:51] that led him when he went to mount
[1:00:55] to sacrifice his son it was the do that
[1:01:00] led
[1:01:01] him yes
[1:01:03] sir is that right how many know that the
[1:01:07] dove amen was leading
[1:01:11] no is that right the dove LED
[1:01:15] John and revealed to the E the dove
[1:01:21] revealed himself to the eag to declare
[1:01:25] the word for that
[1:01:27] hour to Noah in the
[1:01:30] ark amen the prophet the eego he led him
[1:01:34] into a new world by the dove he was sent
[1:01:40] through the

[1:01:47] Hallelujah and when he came on the day
[1:01:49] of
[1:01:50] Pentecost he came in through the
[1:01:53] window
[1:01:56] and brother Bram said I have seen but
[1:01:59] now I heard he said Junior jackon had

[1:02:04] dream that I was preaching from this

[1:03:10] blessing watch
[1:03:13] this we know that
[1:03:15] also in this
[1:03:18] time when brother Bram was
[1:03:21] born in a l cabin just like the ark was

[1:03:32] fire also come through the

[1:03:42] window and it sat over the little
[1:03:49] baby hallelujah
[1:03:52] hallelujah why does it come through the
[1:03:57] window because brother Brown says in the
[1:03:59] message the
[1:04:03] comforter he says Noah in the
[1:04:05] ark on the third
[1:04:09] story was the only place where there was
[1:04:13] a window he says and the
[1:04:16] light was shining through the
[1:04:19] window the light of the new
[1:04:23] world they never
[1:04:25] seen it had all been

[1:04:55] on the seventh
[1:04:57] Mountain the third pool the
[1:05:01] light brother in order for us to begin

[1:27:10] new
[1:27:11] Ephesians that when Joshua led the
[1:27:15] people into the new land amen he told
[1:27:20] them every place
[1:27:23] that the SES of your feet shall tread
[1:27:26] upon the same is your possession how
[1:27:30] many believe that tonight brother bam
[1:27:32] said I I stepped on that snake in Sabino
[1:27:37] Canyon in that Wilderness he saw the
[1:27:41] dead enemy there it was all a type
[1:27:45] showing us in this hour what God had
[1:27:48] come to do for the systems of religion
[1:27:53] he put his foot over it for the systems
[1:27:55] of the world he put his foot over it for
[1:27:59] the systems of the carinal nature in

[1:28:05] sicknesses and death he put his foot
[1:28:08] over it amen amen and in this hour
[1:28:12] brother when we realize that these
[1:28:15] things have been done and how much faith
[1:28:19] we we have lacked to believe God's
[1:28:21] promise
[1:28:24] we hear the word we hear this revelation
[1:28:27] we hear these things but it does not
[1:28:30] have an effect in us to the to the point
[1:28:34] that we can act upon the
[1:28:37] word profess the word amen and bring all
[1:28:42] enemies under our feet because
[1:28:46] Footprints are
[1:28:48] possession in this hour you got to claim
[1:28:51] your promise
[1:28:53] and when they went in the Bible says in
[1:28:56] Joshua 8 amen that Joshua after that
[1:29:02] there was sin in the
[1:29:03] camp he told the Army to hold up that
[1:29:09] something was going wrong God promised
[1:29:12] us certain
[1:29:14] Victory amen not one of the armies of
[1:29:20] Israel was going to was going to die in
[1:29:23] battle but when Joshua begin to see that
[1:29:27] taking place said there's something
[1:29:30] wrong in the church there's there's a
[1:29:34] golden W
[1:29:35] somewhere brother Bram said an adoption
[1:29:38] message if people come up here to be
[1:29:42] prayed for and they're not healed and
[1:29:45] you're in sin it's your fault that that
[1:29:50] person not healed and that
[1:29:53] responsibility is on you that's the word
[1:29:56] of the Lord brought to us through a
[1:29:59] prophet so when we come brother we must
[1:30:03] come the way of
[1:30:05] faith not with sin in our life not with
[1:30:09] anything in our
[1:30:10] mind amen we must come ready under the
[1:30:16] leadership of the do because that same
[1:30:19] Dove is leading you
