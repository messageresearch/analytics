Revelation 10:8-11 The Angel telling John to take the Book and eat it.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
to me the angel of the Lord and many titles he gave of how this angel coming to him amen amen and as we have proved it by the scriptures books that the same Angel is in our midst tonight is the same angel that led the children of Israel through the Wilderness in which he said my name is in him will not pardon your transgression amen obey his voice this is the same angel that Paul the book of Hebrews called Christ this is the same angel brother Bram describes his visitation to him out of the light came a 200 lb man and he says that this light was later been photographed and he said that's what we have in that picture Hallelujah so the the man that came out of the light all of complexion 200 lb came out of that life he calls it the same Angel you see with when we first look at this or we first come into the message and you hear different preachers I remember hearing a well Elder preacher speaking about that angel a long time ago and he said that angel can not be Christ because he said I'm sent from the presence of God and there's a lot of confusion on this as I said last uh Sunday there's a lot of critics even on the internet bringing these things out to the public and trying to prove from a critical standpoint that brother did not know who that angel was and they bring out the quotes he calls him Christ where he calls him the Holy Spirit calls Lord calls him the pillar fire and then they bring out the other quotes where he said there's a difference between the pillar of fire and this Angel amen you see but there is no confusion as I've been saying as we're going along this subject that this is same reasoning and confusion that comes into the minds of the trinitarian because they cannot comprehend the manifestation of God in more than one form whether it's theop whether it's Angel whether it's Pillar of Fire whether it's man amenu whether it's the invisible holy spirit that we fill in the building tonight amenah he reveals himself in many ways but yet is the same God he was a pillar of Fire by night and it was a cloud by day amen amen and that cloud has been revealed to us in this hour that is made out of seven angels is made out of seven spirits amen seven colors that the angel Mighty angel coming down from heaven closed himself Revelations 10:1 said this Mighty Angel was clothed in a cloud and as we finished up Sunday night this is the same thing that he's dressing the bride with in this last days the fullness of the word perfection in Joseph Hallelujah amen election in Abraham is that right amen but perfection in Joseph amen hallelujah and just seeing how tremendous this is if you've been following the spirit and seeing what he is emphasizing even a Sunday night uh how the angel of the Lord has come to anoint the bride you believe that you believe that amen the angel of the Lord has come to anoint thead of Christ in this last day the same angel that Anointed The Prophet and said I'll be with you amen wherever you go he said he promised to be with me in the meetings hallelujah amen that's that's why he would always wait for the presence of that angel and when he speaks of the presence of that angel he describes it in the same manner as when he was caught up in the vision sir is this is the time of the end he says the same testimony years before he says in the presence of this Angel amen it's a presence that paralyzes you he says after all of the times that he has visited me you would think that I would be accustomed or used to it he says but every time he comes it's the same thing Hallelujah when he was caught up into the vision of the cloud brother mam said it paralyzed me amen hallelujah because it was the same presence the angel of the Lord but now he was seeing the Revelation that it was in seven angels but there was one of the angels that would meant more to him it was the one with the point back wings it was the one that had his chest out is that right that was the one that meant more to me if you notice that was the one that was in action that was the one that had come amen because that was the anointing of the age hallelujah hallelujah and as we seen Sunday morning amen amen might have been a little too strong but I believe it's pretty plain amen am if you were able to catch amen what we brought there and just just brought out the quotes and showed how that was you can see very plainly what I said without saying it Hallelujah amen amen I said something without saying is that right am because I read the quotes and I showed you the comparison amen Amen brother mam in the fifth seal we've always quoted that quote we've always gave that quot to but now the light that God is shedding on this it just shows a whole whole another thing in the fifth seal brother said that angel was the seventh angel amen hallelujah amen amen you see Sunday morning we read two quotes remember we read the one where brother Madam said it was the angel of the Lord that right the angel that revealed the whole Revelation to John he said it was the angel of the Lord amen then we read questions and answers in 64 where they asked them why wouldn't Jesus accept worship in the Book of Revelation by John and brother said because it wasn't Jesus amen amen but in the other quote where he said he was the angel of the Lord he said notice it was the angel of the Lord and he said and John went to worship Him He says and he didn't accept worship he said because I am one of your brethren the prophets my fellow servants and brother bam said what was that that was the spirit of Prophecy that had that had been on the prophets All Through the Ages hallelujah amen brother Bram interpreted amen so that's the interpretation I want amen amen I want the interpretation of the Divine interpret said that was that Prophet was the spirit of Jesus Christ was the spirit of Prophecy because the same scripture says Spirit of Prophecy testimony of Jesus brother said that was the same spirit that was upon the prophets and made them prophesy is that right did not Moses say in Deuteronomy the Lord thy God raise up a prophet who he speaking of the god Prophet amen Jehovah Prophet the God of all the prophets so if he says he's I'm a prophet confused he is but he's the angel of the Lord did he anoint the prophet yes did he anoint brother Bram yes did he Veil himself in brother BR yes did he use him to reveal his ministry notice what I said he used him to reveal his ministry yes he did but you see when the Revelation comes it puts everything in its right place that's what Paul told Timothy to rightly divide the word of Truth is that right amen and in seeing these things Brothers is just so much we can talk about testify but we want to give you a thought tonight and that is how the angel comes to the bride and his commission hallelujah hallelujah amen how the angel comes to the bride and his commission and I want you to turn to the Book of Revelation 10 I know you all are familiar with the scripture we all know the scripture but if we're giving a statement like this tonight I believe it's in the scripture am amen it's in the message and Revelation 10 verse 8 this is Brother Ram said in the message what is the attraction on the mountain 1965 how many you remember that message in that message said Revelations 10 1-7 two years ago was prophecy he said now it's history that's his words but brother also preached a message lifting him up out of History amen so Revelations 10 1 to was already history and then later on he preached or before that he preached this day this scriptures fulfilled amen amen and he said Revelations 10 1 to this day the scriptures fulfilled he said the day of judgment the day of of Vengeance has come the second part that Jesus didn't read amen amen this day this scripture is fulfilled Revelations 10 1-7 he said it's history but we must lift him up out of History that's what people are afraid to do to lift them up out of History according to the own prophet's words Revelations 10 1-7 is history but Revelations 108 says and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is opened in the hand of the Angel which standed upon the sea and upon the Earth is the type of the Bride Amen brother M tells us in Revelation 4 message now notice and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey so notice from verse 8 the same voice which spake in Revelation 101 amen amen 10 amen 10 106 amen 107 amen the same voice now coming to him the second time see and he's telling them to take the book from the angel and verse 10 says and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it it my belly was bitter now here's the commission from that angel to who to John he is commissioning John and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and Tong anding Hallelujah is that a commission oh my how the angel comes to the bride and his commission you might ask yourself why we read Genesis 48 amen perhaps tonight we won't get into the part of uh Genesis 48 might just touch a little bit but we read 49 verse 26 where Jacob says the blessings that the Lord has brought upon me have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors hallelujah amen brother and sister why could Jacob say such a thing like that if you read Jacob's story and Jacob's life he had no great signs or wonders like Abraham or like Isaac or like when the angel of the Lord come to Moses and he opened the Red Sea and spoke things into existence or like when he come to Gideon and he fought the battle with 300 amen amen but when the angel of the Lord come to Jacob hallelujah amen it was to train him it was to school him it was to change the way he was yes sir because Jacob amen would dream about the angel and Jacob knew that his fathers amen had had great visitation but you we have to understand that you might not think what he just said right there you might not believe you might say well I believe God blessed Abraham more than he did Jacob he blessed Isaac more than what he did Jacob well then this verse is not inspired of God but it's permitted to be in the scripture and every scripture is inspired of God it's there for a purpose is that right it's there hallelujah hallelujah for Doctrine it's there to teach it's there there to exort every scripture is inspired of God hallelujah hallelujah so behind everything that God does there is a purpose we must understand that and I believe that the reason that Jacob could say that God had blessed me above my progenitors Hallelujah Hallelujah the blessings of God have prevailed in my life above what he blessed Abraham above what he blessed Isaac glory to God Amen Hallelujah he blessed Isaac oh yes how did he bless him oh brother there was no Supernatural thing like that in the Old Testament he come from the dead Paul said in Roman that what he said amen Abraham had received him as one from the dead why dead because Sarah's womb was dead her W her body was dead Hallelujah but from that deadness come Dam us come quickening power change your body Hallelujah and Isaac the promised son come forth is that right Abraham's body was changed amen he seen El he receive strength he saw the pillar of fire his body was changed he saw Elohim in human flesh he saw all these great things is that right amen but how come Jacob could say Amen that the blessings of the Lord upon Him have prevailed above his progenitors I believe amen it's because he understood the purpose of God in his life amen you see he is the father of the 12 tribes of Israel amen and he is the one that blessed them he's the one that prophesied over them what he prophesied over them that until this day still coming to pass and until this day it will come to pass amen this very scene that we read in Genesis 48 amen is coming to pass in in the in the Supernatural to the Gentile church is also happening and will happen Amen to the Jew to God he could say something like that because the angel of the Lord amen showed him you see in Jacob's life all you see is trial Tes training you see him in desperation you see his errors a lot of his errors are written is that right you believe God allowed the prophet to tell us of his errors abely or did he try to hide them you know what he said questions and answers he says I want my errors my mistakes to be a stepping stone for you amen I believe that's the reason why he was giving his his mistakes and his errors that's the reason why he would come publicly and tell us how he would disobey the Lord and not just say well you know I disobey the Lord today oh no no that's how we do it you know I I I was reasoning it and then God helped me that's how we say but he he would tell you the details he would tell you what he was thinking he would tell you where he made the mistake when he was in Africa remember yes yes amen the the Lord had already told him amen go to Duran go to South africaa is that right am but the ministers were telling him brother let's go over here is that right amen and and he asked Billy Paul what should I do bil Paul said he I suggest you do what the angel told you brother said just to go along with what the ministers told him he went that way is that right and he got sick then he got sicker to God yeah nothing come out right is that right because the angel of the Lord had led him to a certain place Hallelujah am but you see he told us those things for a reason is that right if you hear him one time in a meeting he says the last time I was here I was scheduled and everything he says I left somewhere else he says because I to be led by the spirit of the Lord that right do you know what he called those you can type that in the message Macedonian call amen amen he said Paul received the Macedonian call on amen he was in one place and the Lord called him to go to Macedonia he says when the Lord calls I cancel everything I go I follow the Lord amen amen even if the meeting was already scheduled even if you know everything's already ready waiting for Brother BR to come amen amen but you see this this is what we have to understand and I want to speak a little bit about this tonight maybe like a little platform for uh this this title this message that we the Lord has brought upon our heart how the angel comes to the bride and his commission you see so the reason I believe he could say that because he understood the purpose of God in his life amen how many scriptures can you think of in the Bible in the message where brother bam refers to him Jacob as one that was a Shyer one that was a mama's boy one that would you know deceive people amen one that stole the birth right but all those things if you follow his life you see that he reap what he sold amen because just like he deceived his his father Isaac and his mother helped him which was the bad thing to do amen amen mother shouldn't been doing that anyway but she liked him and Isaac liked Esau that right so he put the Esau's perfume on him right amen Esau clothes esa's hairy arm right make him made him smell like es deceived his father in other words he put on a disguise right to deceive his father Hallelujah did he reap what he so yes he did oh yeah that's exactly what his father-in-law did amen amen he disguised Leah and make him think it was it was Rachel amen and he failed for that is that right amen did did it did that come back to him yes and even even harder cuz he had to work seven more years glory to God so everything he done he reaped but the thing is there's a purpose in our Liv bam said in his life he done many mistakes is that right amen and in those mistakes it was the hand of the Lord bringing him to the perfect will of the father bringing him to the purpose upon which he had been born upon the Earth for amen amen with the sons of God are predestinated they're born in the Earth for a purpose everything that God does everything that God says all of his acts his program it's all for a purpose and we must understand amen the purpose of God in order to understand what we are going through and what purpose is in our life it's strange today how people they want to believe in God they want the blessings of God Amen but they don't want to learn and they don't want to know the purpose of God am and if you don't know the purpose of God Amen you will constantly will be in conflict with God though you want His blessings though you believe in him though you love him you will be in Conflict amen amen because you don't understand his purpose how many can say amen you see people want to believe in him they want the blessings of God but people don't want to know and they don't want to learn the purpose of God they don't want to learn his plan they don't want to learn or know the purpose you know why because to know the purpose to know the will of God God requires full surrendering amen God requires dedication God requires Revelation because without knowing the purpose of God revealed to your life amen you will walk as a blind man amen touching for things but in in your desire your heart you want to to serve God you want to please God but you're always bumping into things you're always falling you're always hurting yourself why because you don't see the purpose of God you're blind to his mind you're blind to his will for your life Hallelujah amen do you understand tonight so we are always in conflict with God that's why isah says amen sayth the Lord my thoughts are not your thoughts my ways are not your ways for they're much higher Hallelujah hallelu so we need the mind of Christ Paul says the natural man receiveth not the things of God for they are foolishness unto him and he can neither know them because they are spiritually Des amen amen but natural man cannot receive the things of God the Bible says to be a friend of the world is to have enity with God so we can be in Conflict we can be inity is that right because we need the mind of Christ so if we don't understand his purpose his progress you'll be in conflict with God you'll say why why can't God give me this because you don't understand his purpose you understand what I'm saying why is God doing this to me why am I going through this if you understand his purpose you'll know the answer to the why Hallelujah you see what I'm saying why can't he give me this why is God giving me this burden why do I do I have to go through this or or I want this and God has an answer or I I don't know what to do you see what I'm saying but to know the purpose of God is to understand that behind everything that God does that God says there is a purpose hallelujah amen amen as Paul said in Ephesians chapter 1 brother taught this in the adoption series amen we've preached on this amen years before the mystery of his will did Paul say in Ephesians 1 the mystery of his will that brother Ram comes down and tell us in adoption amen am he says what is the mystery of his will is the mystery of God's will for your life amen hallelujah amen and what else does Paul say in Ephesians according as he has purpose in himself so God has a purpose and he has already purposed these things in himself before the foundation of the world so what do we need Hallelujah huj we need the Eternal thoughts of God to be revealed to us amen so that the mystery of his will is a revelation of his will amen you understand God has a purpose for each and every one of us and I believe this is what the prophet of God understood Hallelujah why am I saying this do you understand why I'm saying this because when the angel came to brother BR what did he come to tell he say I'm here to show you the reason why you had a PEC birth reason why you've had a misunderstood life the reason why these ministers haven't understood the day of their visitation Hallelujah and he showed him through the scriptures what he was to reveal his purpose in life you understand Allelujah is that what the Angel is coming to tell us in this hour amen amen what is he coming to tell us why you were born on the Earthen why you been misunderstood am brother said God's sons have always been misunderstood amen did he preach God being misunderstood amen amen amen God has a purpose reaching every one of us according to election amen you believe his purpose is according to election amen amen amen you see brother when we don't understand God's purpose for our life we want to do what the next person does when we don't understand God's purpose for our lives amen amen we think God's unjust we think that God let one suffer you say let him suffer how many know that the purpose of God for some people's lives is to go through suffering am amen prove it to the scripture and we'll read in a little bit but how come that person if he doesn't understand see what he's going through he'll say while how come I haveall and someone else doesn't have to go because you don't understand his purpose your life hallelujah hallelujah you understand amen but Paul says is God unjust amen is he injust he's Sovereign hallelujah what he does he does for a purpose because he has that plan already in him he has that purpose already in him it's not that he's barely thinking of something to do now oh I think because he he he he's like this then I'm going make him do this I'll make him go through this oh no that's already pre-planned didn't brother mam teach us and the message things that are to be your life has been pre-planned pre so when we understand stand God's purpose for our lives amen we know the objectives we know what God wants to get us to amen amen regardless of the circumstances we're in we know that he has a purpose for our lives and whatever I'm going through is for that purpose amen yes sir if I'm going through bad things it's for that purpose if I'm going through good things for that purpose amen amen hallelujah hallelujah it's all for a purpose oh brother and sister if we can understand what the angel of the Lord is trying to let us know just like when he to brother Brown he showed him you've been born for this purpose hallelujah hallelujah the reason you were born is for this for this and for this this is his purpose in life since he was born that light come over his crib hallelujah amen since he was a little boy The Voice spoke to him and said said don't defy your body don't drink don't smoke amen don't defy your body in any way because when you get older there's a work for you Hallelujah is that right what was the angel showing brother Brom hallelujah hallelujah and then his commission he shows him more you see that what the angel was showing hallelujah hallelujah amen amen reveal to him his purpose in life amen if you don't understand God's purpose that's saw a lot of people caral minded in the world you'll hear them say why does God this M why does God permit that why did God make the devil you don't know his purpose if you know his purpose you know why and this is not to try to show oh I know everything no not I'm saying oh no that's not what I'm saying is to know the purpose of God for your life you're part of the Bride of Jesus Christ if you're part of the elected one in this hour God has a purpose for your life and you were born when you were born because of a purpose hallelujah amen you were born in a certain year and you're a certain age because of a purpose how many when we were younger we wish we wanted to be older amen but now I say thank you God amen amen because now I'm part of a generation hallelujah amen whose mind is being revolutionized hallelujah it's being regenerated GL to God Hallelujah by the power of Revelation amen you see it's all the purpose and plan of God some of you might say how come I didn't come to the message when I much younger there a purpose amen probably would have been caught up in that nonsense and it would have been hard for you to get out of such a thing God knows what he's doing for you don't never look at your life from a human standpoint when you look at your life from a human standpoint you'll say I should have done this I shouldn't have done this if I should have done this right but when you look at it from God's standpoint you know God allowed this God allowed this God allowed this amen and I am where I am today because God has a plan am Hallelujah if we don't understand this we'll say how come God I'm not going to read the scriptures you can write them down if you numbers 11 14 to 17 Moses tells God kill me Lord I can't take this bur no more Hallelujah kill me God comes down tells them no call 70 elders and the spirit that is upon you put on them glor so that they'll bear bear the burden of the people with you so you won't be it alone amen amen was there a purpose for that are and then in numbers 27 12 to 14 is the same as Deuteronomy 31 14 and 19 God comes down and tells Moses go up Upon This Mountain cuz it's time for you to die Hallelujah when he wanted God to kill him take it I said no Hallelujah I have a purpose thank you Lord hallelujah how many times we want to give up how many times we say Lord I can't go on any further amen amen hallelujah but the angel of the Lord is wanting to show you something thank you Lord Brother said God cannot take until he's finished with has a purpose in your life Lord and this is what he's trying to show you I believe that's what the angel of the Lord is in our mid just like when he come to the prophet he show him this is what you're born for this is why you're like this this is why when you hunt you have to hit right on the dark Hallelujah and brother would get mad why did you make me like this oh yeah is that right amen he says how come others the other brothers they can as long as they kill it kill the hunt enough you know he says but for me if I can't hit it in the eye so many yards I get you know upset something's wrong with my gun right I got to change it get a new one right cuz I want to hit the thing in the eye that's right that's how God made him Hallelujah but don't you try to impersonate God didn't make you like that see what I'm saying God has a purpose for you if I hunt I'll get a machine gun that way I won't miss amen hallelujah see what I'm saying glory to God but the thing is we have to understand his purpose so Moses comes down and tells God I'm sorry God comes down tells Moses it's time for you to die that's what he tells him Deuteronomy your time's up mes go up to the mountain look at the land your eyes that's it you're done you know what God tells Moses 31 says write a song before you die amen amen in Deuteronomy 32 is a song that God told him to write before we preach on that when we preach on the latter rain2 that's the song remember where we tyed ites at the end of his ministry amen amen singing this song God gave him the song that right brother Bram it's 1965 singing on the wings of a snow and he to put a verse in there amen amen of his own testimony so so God tells him it's time for you to die now good brother and then if you look at Second Kings CH 20 God tells amen the king through the prophet Isaiah you're going to die say the Lord God is coming down to tell him die Prophet praise amen I mean the king prays and he and he spares his life he gives him 15 more years why because he had a purpose put his house in order Hallelujah and as soon as he put his house in order he die what was the purpose why did God spare him 15 more years to put his house in once he put his house in order God was finished with amenu it wasn't the same purpose amen amen for someone else that was a purpose for his life why would why would God let Steven be stoned to death and then go and get Peter out of prison so they won't kill him amen amen amen oh why Lord why they St maybe Sten got to the throne a little angry why you kill why' you let them kill me Lord see why do how come they still preach amen how they can preach the gospel until the end of the world wasn't I in that same commission amen wasn't I part of the ministry also you see but we have to understand God's purpose see let let's read Hebrew 11 real quick Hebrews 11 32 and what shall I say more more say for the time will fail me to to tell of Gideon and of barck and Samson and jeffi uh je jeffa and David also and the Samuel and of the prophets who through faith kingdoms WR righteousness obtain promises look at all these great things subdued kingdoms prom of lions great things right Supernatural things subd kingom the mouth of lions right amen the violence of fire through HEB children escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong wax Valley and F turn to fight the enemy the armies of the aliens women receive their dead raised to life again others were were tortured see others others amen others so here's this category of all these ones that did great things are you reading the same scripture I'm readen there's two categories here something that did great thing subdued kingdoms and all the supernatural things others glory to God others were tormented not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better Resurrection others had a trial of cruel mockings and scourgings Y moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were saw aunder they were tempted they were slain with the sword see some escaped the edge of the sword some were slain with the sword 37 amen amen some were killed by the sword some escaped the sword why why has a purpose see they wanted in sheep skins goat skins being destitute Afflicted tormented amen amen destitute living caves all these things dens wander in the deserts and mountains of the earth here's David in the palace amen eating grapes fruits and lamb bread wine thousand wives 500 wives see amen is heaven going to be full of these type of people amen amen some that didn't have nothing to God C and destitute and running about others in palaces of God for your life huah David couldn't try to say well I have to be humble Brethren I got to be humble you know El in the cave maybe I go find me a cave you weren't called for that see what I'm saying if you don't understand the purpose for your life and the time that you are in the mystery of his will for your life you're going to be in conflict with God you're going be reasoning against God you're going be fighting against being against the pre like he told Paul amen amen hallelujah that's why David when he when when he understood this what did he say let's turn to Psalm 84 David understood this Psalm 84 verse for a day in thy courts is better than a thousand I'd rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of the wicked yes Hallelujah i' rather be a door man I'd rather be a doorkeeper that's what David just said amen amen what if someone else offer him said David you're not a door keep amen Oh no you're something else got it in you amen amen there something great I see feel it oh watch out if you don't understand that purpose you'll fall for any that's right brother that's good brother you'll fall for for for any little spirit amen come offering you all kinds of things that's good that's why Peter said make your calling and election sure if you do these things you shall never fall is that right amen glory to God let us turn quickly to Romans chapter 8 remember we're just laying a foundation for this subject verse 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose all all all for whom he did for know he also did PR predestinate to be conformed into the image of his son that he might be the first born among many Brethren moreover when he did predestinate him them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and then who Justified them he also glorified am what shall we say to these things if God before us who can be against us he that Spar not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifies who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died y rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation distress persecution famine nakedness Peril or as it is written for thy sake are we all killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slot n in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us am for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord is that right amen hallelujah hallelujah so all of these things yeah and all these things even if we're going through all these things we are more than conquer because there is a purpose in our Liv that is eternal brother bam said in the future home message 1964 you were made for an eternal purpose Hallelujah you w saved on a certain day you were always saved but you have to come to the realization of what God has made you in Christ what you were in him before the foundation of the world that's what you shall be hallelujah hallelujah there's not a demon in Hell there's not a mistake that I can make that will stop that purpose from coming to pass Hallelujah am you think Jacob could do something according to election that would change God's purpose for his life oh brother and sister brother according to election even before Jacob or Esau was born God said I love Jacob and I hate es glory to God why why did he say that because he already had a purpose upon Jacob's life he already had a pre-planned life Hallelujah huj for the foundation of the world what Jacob was going to be and in due time at due time the angel of the Lord come to Jacob and began to take them to certain places begin to take them to certain experiences Hallelujah begin to reveal to him certain things he visited him in angels Hallelujah yes sir and then after that he revealed himself to him in dream in the desert and and he dreamed about this ladder and how Angels came up and

that angel is here that's right I try to be sincere but in the room that night when he came to me he appeared to me many times in the form of a star I have seen it many times but it but it came visible it was a man that would seemingly weigh about 200 lb a little over two years ago now I was sitting in my room I was reading my scoffield Bible and I saw a light and I thought it was an an automobile that turned the corner but it got brighter and I looked out the door there was no automobile I heard something coming like this brother knocks walking and it looked that light got greater just above me hung a great star and that light was kind of a more of a green green and yellow shining on the floor and coming walking through the light come a man to 100 lb huge man he did not have a beard on over his face like Christ's picture does he was shaved he was more of an olive complexion he had dark eyes he walked as close to me as the microphone is right here yes it's true friend I couldn't speak he said fear not I'm sit for the presence of God to tell you that this life of yours your peculiar birth you were born with the gift of Divine Healing to the peoples of the world if you'll be sincere and get the people to believe you there'll be no disease that can stand before your prayer not even cancer said it will come to pass that you'll tell the people their diseases by a vibration over your hand then if you'll be reverent you'll tell the people their sins of their life and the things that they have done amen amen I said sir I'm uneducated I couldn't go he said if you'll get them to believe you nothing shall stand in your prayer amen amen I said I bet they wouldn't believe me sir he said you'll be given two signs as Moses the prophet given two signs to get the people to believe you is the really the issue one of them was detecting diseases by holding the right hand in your left then if you'll be sincere it will come to pass you'll tell the very secrets and things that they're doing wrong to build the faith in the people to be in faith and to vindicate that I God will send it to you I said I'm uneducated I couldn't go he said I will be with you the light began to catch up and the angel went into the light and it started off I started off and healed a lot of sick amen amen he said one night sitting right in my little church my piano player was playing I had never heard it before the little song only believe as I walked in my church something struck me amen amen then brother says Puerto Rico in Ohio God revealing himself to his people he says the light begin to get greater and it it gathered up to the angel and it got into the Angel and the and the angel went into that light the pillar of fire the one you've seen tonight it it went out of the room I didn't know know what to do Hallelujah he said I have I have appeared other words from God to tell you your peculiar birth which I had he says there sets my mother and I can tell you my peculiar my peculiar life no one has ever understood me has been to indicate that you're to take a gift of Divine Healing into the people of the world even with the seventh grade education how could I ever Feed the World a local Baptist preacher in the city he said if you'll be sincere when you pray remember the gift was born here and I had nothing to do with it coming no friends don't never let no one deceive you gifts are sent from God alone it's his for knowledge and I've seen that light coming to the room it appeared visible they have it on pictures back there that was taken scientifically proven and when I've seen that light come in the room it's been through the critics and everything that picture scientifically proven in the government Affair has been checked and so forth he comes in the meetings many times when when we're having the meeting like this see I just seen a light shining on the floor and it come across the floor walking to me it was a man some 200 lb dressed in a a white Rob had dark hair to his shoulder very pleasant sort of a man and I could not move I was just shaking I Heard a Voice oh ever since I was a little boy I but I had never seen nothing only something a whirl withg or a pillar of fire but he got real close to me it the man when he spoke to me he said do not fear and I knew it was the same man the same voice that talked to me since I was a little boy and he said I'm sient from the presence of almighty God to tell you that your peculiar birth is to indicate that you to pray for the sick in all the world if you can get the people to believe you nothing will stand before your prayer because for this cause you was born amen how the angel came to me in his commission brother mam again explaining his visitation how the man the same one that he had heard in the world with that he had seen in light form but he had never seen the image of it he walked up to me real close and he says brother says it make you feel the same way you're maybe farther along the road than I am but it would make you feel that way because after the hundreds and hundreds of times of visitations he par it paralyzes me when he comes near it sometimes he even makes me almost completely pass out so just weak when I leave the platform if I stay too long it'll go completely out I've had them ride me around for hours not even know where I was at I can't explain it read down here in the Bible it will explain it the scripture say so hallelujah amen fear he said just as quiet he said I'm sent from the presence of God tell you that your peculiar birth you know what my birth was that same light hung over me when I was first born your misunderstood life has been to indicate that you're to go into the world you see regardless of what they have said as I have designated ated God who's my judge he he he designated cancer see said if you get the people to believe you sincere nothing will stand before your prayers not even cancer amen if you need the people to believe you then I seen he wasn't my enemy he was my friend hallelujah amen why because the ministry had told him this was of the devil brother in Puerto Rico says this the man was there just as I am here he was looking at me he looked right down at me he said do not fear as soon as he said that I knew it was the same voice that spoke to me since I was a little boy i' never seen him before but it was his voice it was deep and he said he said fear not I have been sent from God to tell you that you peculiar birth and life no one understood me my ministerial Brothers didn't understand me my father my mother didn't understand me my girlfriends my boyfriends they didn't they don't yet neither do I understand myself I cannot make it out I don't want to be different I want to be like someone else but you can only be what God makes you he's the Potter and we are the clay that's exactly what Romans 9 finishes to say after he speaks of the promise of God according to election he says and I listen to him and this was all to indicate what I was to do a local Baptist pastor amen and I looked at him again and he was very kind seemed like the fear begin to leave me now and I said sir I'm educated I could not do such things he said you'll begin to pray for Kings fakes and monarch amen I have never received the Holy Ghost yet I was just a local Baptist pastor these things are strange to me and I know nothing about them and said if they won't believe the first sign they'll believe the second sign like Moses it will come to pass it'll it'll keep growing greater and greater Hallelujah huj don't you understand friends that he had to take them back to the scriptures to show him the ministry of Moses to show them the ministry of Jesus in the scriptures hallelujah amen what was the angel doing showing him the places in the scriptures where his purpose his life his ministry was connected in those scriptures Hallelujah in the same things in the same calling and the same principles do you understand what is the Angel of the Lord what is he doing to the bride today is it he revealing us the mystery of Esther isn't he showing us the ministry of Esther what was she was to do her responsibility her call in the time of persecution isn't that what the angel of the Lord has come to the bride to let her know what she is here for and her commission has he showed us what seph means in the Bible what Sarah she was visited by the angel receive dunamas that the ministry of the Bride is the same as the ministry of Jesus christu hallelujah hallelujah notice what he says and I want you to catch something tonight as we close that this Angel when he comes to brother Bram he lets him know no matter what what the ministry says there is a purpose Hallelujah huj in your life well they teach it this way they teach it that way they teach it all kinds of ways but brother brother mam says right here this was not a vision this man was here like I am standing here and he told me what I was to do as Moses I was to be sent out not even know the secrets of their hearts I said that is what has puzzled me because my Minister Brothers has said it's wrong and when he spoke straight then he spoke straight right to me and he said as it was in the first coming of Jesus this is what the angel is telling brother BR and people yet message don't even believe that as it was in the first coming of Jesus so it is at the second the the ministers do not know their days of visitation that's what the angel told the prophet of God hallelujah amen then he referred to many scriptures in the Bible and he begin to show me what Jesus did oh brother is that right how many how many know the testimony he said he referred to me to the woman at the well Hallelujah how Jesus revealed to her she had five husbands is that right who was showing him that that he had to reveal that part of the scripture amen did he reveal it amen that that angel was there

didn't he take him to the Sea amen when Philip called Danel is that right and he said behold a true Israelite in whom there's no who took him to those scriptures that brother BR would always preach about that he would always used for his ministry because that is what he was to reflect that was what he was born for hallelujah hallelujah glory to God what he he show him Moses Ministry two signs is that right to bring the people out in an exodus is that right to bring them out of captivity bring them out of bondage you see and he said there's been 10 thousands and thousands of people if I die tonight and this is my last night on earth my words has been true then he says speaking of the same Angel the scientific world has took the picture of it and we have it here it's been proved to in Washington DC it hangs in the Hall of art religious art the only supernatural being that was ever photographed with the machine and the church know the world open your heart and you shall see it too hallelujah hallelujah that's the way it is today it's always been we've only know if we only know the day of visitation but the visitation goes right through and the people are looking way over here something else first thing you know the visitation is over and there it is no man can come to me except my father draw him first and all the father has given me will come to me stand on your feet tonight amen are
