[0:11] on the other side and there was a valley
[0:14] between them you know
[0:18] is
[0:27] a little bit of
[0:34] Battleground
[0:36] where both forces of God and the Devils
[0:42] can meet in fact
[0:45] amen amen and right here in the shadow
[0:49] in the Old Testament here in the story
[0:52] of David he was the Bible speaks of the
[0:57] valley of decisions
[1:00] that's exactly where the battle is
[1:04] because that's he said is where
[1:07] decisions are made
[1:12] remember last Sunday we spoke about the
[1:15] pressure
[1:18] I believe it's the devil
[1:22] the enemy that presses down
[1:25] to make us be in that state of pressure
[1:30] to make the wrong decision is
[1:35] because when you're in that state you do
[1:38] things you wouldn't normally do because
[1:40] where
[1:59] and there without a champion
[2:03] out of the capital of philistine named
[2:05] Goliath the god of God whose height was
[2:08] six cubits in the spine
[2:11] is
[2:18] upon his head and he was almost voted
[2:21] now
[2:22] and waiting on the coat was 5000 shoes
[2:25] of Brass
[2:33] Bridge upon his legs and talking to
[2:36] friends between the shoulders
[2:42] the staff of the spirit was like a
[2:45] Weaver's being an experienced head
[2:47] weighed 600 seconds of iron and one
[2:50] pairing
[2:51] a shield went before it
[3:06] Israel heard those words of the
[3:08] Philistine they were dismayed and
[3:10] greatly afraid

[5:30] had a part of mind
[5:32] he put his eldest son it was the last
[5:35] week and he said surely this one will be
[5:37] here
[5:38] amen amen the crowd will look nice on
[5:42] him
[5:43] Hallelujah man but God told Samuel
[5:48] I don't look at the outward appearance
[5:57] God always testified
[6:00] he was a man a little bit after his own
[6:04] thoughts
