[0:03] how many knows that the bride in this
[0:06] hour has been called up
[0:11] to
[0:13] amen
[0:15] amenu said there's been three showdowns
[0:19] in the
[0:20] scripture or there's three showdowns in
[0:23] the
[0:24] Bible the message spoken where the
[0:26] Original
[0:28] Seed said the first was on Mount
[0:32] carel amen he said the second was on
[0:34] Mount
[0:37] Transfiguration he said and then the
[0:40] bride amen there will have there will be
[0:43] a
[0:44] showdown for the Rapture and Jesus Will
[0:49] Be The
[0:50] Showdown among the
[0:53] denominations said and the third
[0:57] Showdown is on Mount
[1:02] or the
[1:02] Rapture of the Bride so the bride has
[1:07] been called to Mount
[1:09] Zion she will be
[1:12] raptured from Zion how many know where
[1:17] physically or literally Zion
[1:21] is it is in the city of
[1:26] Jerusalem but it's a special mount
[1:30] that is close to the
[1:33] temple that is supposed to be
[1:38] there and I believe will be
[1:42] rebuilt on the temple
[1:45] Mountain
[1:47] amen so that's where M Zion is
[1:53] literally but Mount Zion spiritually is
[1:56] Heavenly places in Christ
[1:58] am
[2:00] amen hallelujah hallelujah and with him
[2:04] 144,000 now
[2:07] notice this is speaking of these elected
[2:10] seed
[2:13] Jews whose names were in the Lamb's Book
[2:16] of
[2:17] Life for the foundation of the
[2:20] world because notice they have the
[2:25] revelation of the father's
[2:27] name amen they have received that
[2:31] Revelation brother said in the message
[2:33] 10 virgins and
[2:37] 144,000 that the mark in the
[2:41] forehead means you have received a
[2:45] revelation amen hallelujah now verse two
[2:49] and I Heard a Voice from Heaven as the
[2:52] voice of many Waters and as the voice of
[2:55] a great Thunder amen and I heard the
[2:58] voice of Harpers harp with their
[3:09] hearts amen amen and they sung as it
[3:13] were a new song before the throne and
[3:16] before the four beasts and the elders no
[3:19] man could learn that song but the
[3:22] 144,000 which were redeemed from the
[3:28] Earth
[3:35] [Music]
[3:39] these are they which were not defiled
[3:43] with women amen they are
[3:47] virgins these are they which follow the
[3:50] lamb withs soever he goeth hallelujah
[3:53] amen these were redeemed from among men
[3:57] being the first fruits unto God and to
[4:00] the
[4:13] lamb and in their mouth was found no gu
[4:18] Hallelujah for they are without fault
[4:20] Before the Throne of
[4:28] God amen heavenly father thank you Lord
[4:33] God reading of your
[4:36] word we ask that you bless it give us
[4:39] the context
[4:42] father remove Lord everything contrary
[4:46] to your
[4:47] word father if we have come here
[4:50] tonight we hear from you oh God let our
[4:55] hearts Lord reflect that here
[4:58] tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus
[5:02] Christ amen you may be
[5:06] seated
[5:14] am what a tremendous
[5:18] scripture we see
[5:21] here again going back to the seventh
[5:26] trumpet a little bit
[5:28] tonight
[5:30] because we have
[5:32] seen that brother bam says in the Feast
[5:35] of the
[5:36] trumpets paragraph
[5:39] 155 he says the continuity of the
[5:43] scripture is exactly the same under the
[5:47] seventh
[5:48] trumpet is to
[5:50] Israel the same as the seven
[5:54] seal was to the church so we see that
[5:58] the seventh trumpet to the
[6:00] Jews as we were seeing
[6:03] Sunday is the same as the seventh
[6:06] seal the revelations
[6:08] 10 to the Bride of Jesus
[6:11] Christ we see how that ties in perfectly
[6:15] with the
[6:17] word amen and we want to continue on
[6:20] this thought tonight just to strike
[6:22] another portion of
[6:26] it brother ROM goes on to say his
[6:30] well Feast of the trumpets paragraph
[6:34] 270 he says as soon as this
[6:38] church the
[6:40] bride uh and is is draw
[6:45] together she has taken
[6:47] up and that
[6:49] mystery of the seven seal the mystery
[6:55] going he says the
[6:57] Jews is called
[7:00] by The
[7:01] Mystery of the seventh
[7:03] trumpet which is two
[7:07] prophets Elijah and
[7:10] Moses now notice again he is
[7:14] comparing amen the seventh
[7:17] seal is what is the
[7:19] mystery that's going to take the
[7:22] bride amen that's the mystery of the
[7:25] Rapture amen hallelujah so that's
[7:28] another another
[7:31] portion showing us what the seven seal
[7:34] is
[7:36] about amen we know that there was
[7:39] silence but seven Thunders under of
[7:41] their voices on the
[7:43] earth amen amen so we see then
[7:47] hallelujah hallelujah that the seven
[7:49] seal will Rapture the the Gentile
[7:52] bride then he says then the
[7:55] Jews are
[7:57] called by the m
[8:00] of the seventh
[8:02] trumpet see so the bride receives a
[8:06] mystery of the seven seal and the Jews
[8:12] 144,000 receive the mystery of the
[8:15] seventh
[8:16] trumpet Hallelujah he says that that is
[8:19] two
[8:20] prophets Elijah you find that
[8:23] Revelations
[8:24] 11 amenu and then as we seen Sunday the
[8:29] seventh trumpet continues
[8:32] on even after they are
[8:35] killed and they're
[8:37] slaughtered amen after the three years
[8:39] and a half of mos Elijah's
[8:43] preaching so the seventh
[8:45] trumpet amen is in mystery
[8:49] form Amen in Revelations
[8:52] 11 by Elijah and
[8:55] Moses amen the
[8:58] mystery the seven trumpet it's two
[9:01] prophets then they fulfill the three
[9:04] years and a
[9:05] half hallelujah amen we we were speaking
[9:08] of this Sunday just picking it up back
[9:11] right there so notice once the three
[9:15] years and a half are
[9:17] over then God can pour out his complete
[9:21] wrath and Destroy them that destroy the
[9:25] Earth is that right that's where the
[9:28] seven trumpet
[9:30] continues amen it connects with the
[9:33] Vib and that's what we seen on
[9:36] Sunday but we want to get into the
[9:38] mystery part
[9:40] now in other words we're backing up to
[9:43] Moses and
[9:45] Elijah within the three years and a
[9:48] half and then at the same time that
[9:52] Revelation
[9:53] 14 now listen to this this is powerful
[9:57] right here amen amen you got to catch
[10:01] how it's being placed here Revelations
[10:05] 14 is
[10:08] 144,000 amen and they're on Mount
[10:11] Zion I'm going to read you a quote right
[10:13] now and brother bam says that joh that
[10:18] John saw him in Revelations
[10:21] 14 amen and he said here they had come
[10:26] to the
[10:27] temple amen amen which is already
[10:30] rebuilt and he said they come to worship
[10:34] Jesus hallelujah hallelujah so brother
[10:37] this has to be here and if you follow
[10:40] the reading of it if you follow the
[10:43] context of it Hallelujah and other
[10:47] statements that brother Ram
[10:49] made brother said Jesus will meet the
[10:55] 144,000 in the the the millennial Temple
[11:00] Hallelujah that's where he will meet
[11:03] them glory to God that's why it don't
[11:06] make
[11:07] sense Hallelujah the millennial Temple
[11:11] is some
[11:13] person how's Jesus going to meet 144,000
[11:16] people inside
[11:21] somebody my goodness hello
[11:24] somebody amen am well you see the
[11:29] that that Millennial Temple will be
[11:32] rebuilt hallelujah amen amen now notice
[11:37] in the message G's instructions to
[11:40] Daniel paragraph
[11:43] 118 he said John couldn't
[11:46] understand but then he
[11:50] looked he looked back and he saw on
[11:56] M Glory
[12:00] see the scripture here shows
[12:03] us he saw
[12:06] 144,000 that had not been
[12:09] defiled with
[12:12] women
[12:13] Jews that had not been
[12:16] defiled with women and brother R says
[12:22] churches yes sure amen amen so they had
[12:25] not been
[12:26] defiled with with church church he said
[12:30] they hadn't
[12:32] joined to
[12:34] organization of Lutheran Methodist
[12:38] Baptist and
[12:40] Presbyterian but they had been
[12:42] Jews from the beginning amen the
[12:47] Orthodox amen and had their
[12:52] Temple and they
[12:55] worshiping on
[12:57] Zion
[12:59] hallelujah amen amen so notice brother
[13:04] Revelations 14 is showing you that where
[13:07] these 144,000 are
[13:10] worshiping they're singing a song that
[13:13] no one else can sing but
[13:15] them Hallelujah they had the father's
[13:18] name on their
[13:20] forehead that means they already
[13:22] received the
[13:23] Revelation that was given to them it's
[13:26] the same Revelation that the bride Rees
[13:30] that seals her for him is the mighty
[13:33] Angel it's the holy spirit that comes
[13:37] sealing Hallelujah and that is under the
[13:40] seventh seal to the bride of Christ to
[13:44] the Jews amen the seven trumpet and they
[13:48] are sealed according to
[13:51] Revelations
[13:53] 11 they are sealed according to
[13:56] Revelation 7 they are sealed

[14:11] killed they cannot be killed until
[14:14] they're not
[14:16] sealed
[14:18] amen it's when they're sealed within the
[14:21] 3 years and a
[14:23] half amen hallelujah the slaugh comes
[14:28] but there will be a
[14:30] resurrection hallelujah amen in other
[14:34] words Revelations

[14:41] worshiping Jesus in the millennial
[14:46] [Applause]
[14:47] Temple hallelujah hallelujah Oh Glory

[14:56] word's being
[14:57] placed oh in Elijah is a s trumpet in
[15:00] mystery
[15:03] form amen that's why they're getting
[15:07] sealed three years and a half are
[15:09] over then the Wrath comes they're
[15:12] killed but after that they're
[15:16] resurrected it's in the same
[15:18] chapter
[15:20] 11 Hallelujah
[15:23] hu this is where there's there on Mount
[15:27] Z brother Rapture spiritually where we

[15:47] God you
[15:51] understand now hold on maybe that was a
[15:56] big state to begin

[47:10] other night in
[47:13] apocalypse apocalypse means a sculpture
[47:17] it was done down here making
[47:21] something and then what he does he takes
[47:24] the curtain out
[47:26] and says there it
[47:28] is what was he
[47:31] redoing he was revealing
[47:34] himself he's talking about Matthew
[47:38] 17 what was he
[47:40] doing redoing he was revealing himself
[47:45] in another
[47:46] fashion if you want to read those very
[47:49] words is in the Book of Mark in The Book
