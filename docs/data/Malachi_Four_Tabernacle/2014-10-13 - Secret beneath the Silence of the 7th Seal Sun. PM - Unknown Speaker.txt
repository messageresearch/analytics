TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hallu true simple he didn't know it he was in flesh here on Earth he goes finishes his ministry on Earth he is glorified of the father sits at the right hand of the Majesty to intercede is that right but he sends back the Holy Spirit to dwell in the church amen when John enters his vision amen Amen brother said the Book of Revelation is exactly in the correct place it's supposed to be it's the last book and it's the only book that Jesus wrote himself is that what he said amen that's the only book that he wrote himself Hallelujah that's tremendous he began to unfold that secret in the Book of Revelations through symbols John was seeing all of this he was hearing things and some of the things that he heard by this Angel by these Vision by this Revelation he wasn't allowed to write but he heard him he seen them amen you see the full Revelation was being given what was h in the father amen for all those years the mystery that was in the back part of God's mind that he could not give until the correct time oh brother but John saw our day John saw our mess hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah you see when you look at these things you begin to understand amen these Ministries were before the foundation of the world remember we spoke on the etern the seven SE coming from eternity brother these ministries predestinated of God they didn't start when they came to the Earth they already were amen amen so we can see that in the Book of Revelation amen that angel revealing that book to John and he is to be born 2,000 years later the one that's showing these things to John hasn't even come to the Earth yet amen amen amen amen the thing about it is when you begin to look you say this has to be divine you know revelation of God for for a man like this to take the mystery of God receive this amen and hold this mystery see and somehow by God's revelation and inspiration amen give this out and leave it in tapes and in books because he said take with Jesus this message will fall in the hands of the predestinated he knew there was coming a people that was going to take these things amen and the whole mystery was going to unfold to him when he was preaching those things he told the the Elder people amen amen that now we can look back and say they're they're they're the that old generation he said you're not supposed to give you're not getting it and you're not supposed to amen amen that's pretty hard words for the prophet to tell you but when he he's telling the people of that time that they're not supposed to catch it that's exactly what he means amen amen because there's coming a people amen a new generation see that's what people cannot accept people cannot accept the fact full revelation of God things that they could not tap into amen will just be open to the elect in the in the end time amen why because you're smarter no why because you study more than them no brother they they've had the message for 50 years and they've studied it 50 years amen but how come somebody today can be catching a mystery in a few years amen hallelujah brother because this is the generation that he was looking for they will see they will recognize they will hallelujah it's such a privilege to live in this we can look back and see oh it was great times Amen brother what good would it have been to been in those great times and not have revelation that is open nowall you see when you're real close to something it's hard to distinguish what it is amen but once years go by amen once you look back and you check it through the scripture you you can see a a better panoramic of what what what was taking place amen amen that's why it's hard L the elders and they took a lot of things very caral very natural very Earthly minded brother but you had a prophet that was speaking things that he was in connection like we said this morning with another world hallelujah hallelujah he was uttering things says the book of Psalms that one day another day you know the and brother said amen I he said Luther walked in one life Wesley walked in another life amen he said Pentecostal walked in another l now here we're walking in another light he says that there's a generation after this one they'll have a greater light that's what I'm saying it's a tremendous time to live now we don't imagine that's why we we have to get we have to to get in tune connected with what the holy spirit is being it wants to give now another hours notice he said but as it was in the days of Noah amen how many know that this same scripture the same scene is given by Jesus in St Luke 17 when he is speaking of the son of man that was to come again and reveal himself as it was in the days of Noah and as it was in the days of L amen amen why is it then that when brother bam come on the scene and took those things he went to the the scripture and he brought out to us this is speaking of the ministry of a prophet that was not the son of man but the seventh angel was going to receive the ministry of Jesus Christ and he was going to reveal to the public the son of man is that right brother said there's where you have trouble separating the two and a lot of people do have trouble because they worship Him and they do all these othering his name then they end up some other amen the thing is when we look at this brother if Jesus is saying no man knows his secret but as it was in the days of no are what are you going to do if you hear him say that what are you going to do don't you think it would be a good idea to go back in the scripture because brother Adam said he was reading the same Genesis that you and I did Jesus read the book of Genesis that you and I read he read the same verses chapters the Same Book of Genesis he was reading he wasn't reading a different Genesis so when he said as it was in the days of Noah it's because he had been reading back there and knew that there was a mystery within that that was for the time of the revealing of this secret mystery is that right I read to you this morning amen the quote brother says a mystery of God revealed speaking of this scripture he says the great mystery of how it was a secret he kept it a secret nobody know nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it see he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seven seal was open there was silence amen amen when the seven seal was open there was silence when Jesus was here on Earth they wanted to know when he would come he said it's not even the son himself don't know when he's when it's going to happen and God has all this to himself it's a secret and that's the reason that is the reason you understand for the silence what's the reason of the silence why when the seven seal was open in symbol form there was no symbol of it nothing why is it complete total silence because of this secret because of this mystery that the father had to himself and he says that is the reason there was silence in heaven for the space of half an hour seven Thunders ohu UT their voices wait a minute seven Thunders ain't in the book or they ain't in the chapter of Revelation seven are in yeah yep me another place where you'll find seven Thunders like that only chapter 10 the Earth Amen brother and sister brother is connecting this and he has showed us already we've preached it already amen amen but sometimes when the Holy Spirit wants to really get to something to prove amen by his word the hour we are in he has to bring it to us Amen in such a way that we're able to perceive what he is telling us and I hope that is that that's the case because brother this is this is really important when there was space of half an hour silence in heaven seven Thunders uttered their voes and John was forbidding to write it see it was the coming of the Lord so we see then hallelujah hallelujah that when you look at that and you and you come back to Matthew 24 we've never Ted this before Oh when you come back Matthew 24 and you go into the seventh seal that Jesus preached he was in flesh amen amen you see what I'm saying amen was he in heaven oh no no he was on Earth speaking to disciples he said no man knoweth this great secret it's se but as it was in the days of no no was the sign before the destruction he is a sign before judgment the greatest sign that God send to the Earth before judgment how many know what it is it's Propet he is the sign of warning Hallelujah Jud dment is coming destruction is coming I've seen the vision great rain is coming it's going to destroy the Earth going to flood everything out he's going to destroy the whole face of the Earth people laugh people mock notice that while he is preaching there sons of God are in a backsliding condition Son of God yes and they drowned in the right sons of God backs chasing after half naked women amen amen amen they drowned in the FL Son by flesh mhm yeah yep is that right when you look at the mystery that's inside of there you find that brother tyes Noah in different ways amen amen you cannot enter into these things with the childish mind and only keep one type because then the types that he gave like for instance Mary is she a type of the Bride yes you see a type of the sh you see what I'm saying yes how can the same person in the scripture give two ties because that's how God's word is he said Mary is a type of bride receive the word from an angel she has to give birth to the second coming of Jesus Christ he typed it with Revelations 12 the bride giv him birth he Ted it to the Jewish Orthodox is that right amen amen and then he Ted it to the Pentecostal sh when when when she said your father and I have been looking for you said that's the shot the same person twoes look at what message that brother preached on I can do nothing about La will the church go before the tri and he said fire cannot fall from Heaven to destroy the Gentile World until the bride is taken in the did he type as bride there a lot of quotes you see but a childish mind will say no but he'll make that quote fight this quote that quot can't be right because this one says this no it all has its place amen you have to be careful when you're speaking on tipes yeah we spoke on this before amen amen for instance if you type Abraham amen you can type Abraham right he he came out of Babylon right justification sanctification baptism with the Holy Ghost is that right his name is changed he he he's he's taken elsh the breasted one he said that's Pentecost is that right amen and then what was the next thing he's visited by El inside of that body speaking to him by his new name is that right then his body Chang of is that right amen and then their body will change to receive the promised son said and we'll meet the promised son after our are changed in the air and right there the tight stops and then you keep going in the scripture and you go into ISAC and you find another type because if not if you continue the type then you're you're you're you're being told by God that in the in the in the wedding supper they got to grab Jesus from the table and go kill him right that's what you would be doing if you follow the Ty so you can't follow the typ and keep going and keep going a time has a beginning and it has an end and you stay within the tipe amen then and then you go into another time and you stay within the time you see so how come Jesus did not say as it was in the days of Enoch and as it was in the days of Abraham he could have said it he could have said it because and Noah were there and Abraham were there how Jesus didn't say as it was in the days of Enoch and as it was in the days of Abraham no you see it it's a secret but when the Prophet come he's the one that opened the secret he told us look Jesus said to look to the days of lot he said lot was inom amen but the elected group was out in the wilderness Hallelujah glory to God Amen they had nothing to do with s you see what I'm saying amen he said look at Noah type of the foolish bir that will go through the tribulation is that right he said type of the written of 144,000 Jews amen that will go as a people through the tribulation amen amen he typed them that way they're types brother you can't get all pra about the types amen you just got to let the types speak for themselves because there's mystery secrets and let me say this every one of them T Christ if you can't find Christ in them types you're reading the Bible wrong that's right you can find Christ in a rock you can find him in a cloud amen you can find them in a rain you can find them in anything amen amen in nature God in his church God in his Universe amen you can see the first Bible written in heaven you can see the second Bible Enoch's pyramid and this is the third Bible brother said today people don't read their Bible so he's made you a Bible a WR Hallelujah Hu amen so what when we look at Noah within the mystery that Jesus is speaking here he T he T messenger with his family hallelujah hallelujah God Amen a prophet Waring the people the AR the door is open a messenger preaching there's only one door there's only one door there's not many doors one door to get in this and once you come in there's three stages justification sanctification and baptism of the Holy is our message is that our prophet in the people Before Destruction come notice when we look at these points Jesus points us back to Genesis Genesis is the book of beginning Genesis is the seed chapter amen Genesis is where it's in seed form Revelation it's yes amen amen what was planted as a seed in Genesis is fully matur in the Book of Revelation harest time and this is planting is that right the prophet show us that did he show us Eve being deceived by The Serpent and when he preached seven Church ages he said look at the first church age look at Ephesus Paul said as the serpent beg so has heow you amen when he preached Revelations 2 he said look the tree of life is there the promise to the Overcomer what was over there in the garden of EG what was in the Garden of Eden the river euphrat and there was a tree of knowledge of evil the serpent got into that Beast is that right and the river EES was there amen glory and who else was there the Tree of Life Jesus Christ was there that he who eats of him the bread of life that come down from heaven shall never never die look at Revelations look at Revelations 9 the river Euphrates and what comes out of the bottomless pit that sets with a Triple Crown is that tree of Good and Evil yes sir the devil will incarnate himself in the beast but there you have the the Tree of Life Jesus Christ come down with the book in his head to give us the bread of life Hallelujah he that eats of this shall never die hallelujah hallelujah you can look at the tower of Assemblies of God inesis am is that what he said the Baptist Church that in Genesis is that what he said but it didn't have the name assem of God it was a se but over here is the full maturity there's a deceived church that had illegitimate children that produce false religion amen and they produce worship and roots and Nimrod buil the Tower of B a center to bring all the wealth of the world to that place and begin to to bring taxation upon the Earth to bring all the wealth of the world into Babylon he was inspired of Satan to build the city like what he saw in heaven amen Prophet teaches those things and look over here in the Book of Revelation Rome Seven Hills a woman setting upon Seven Hills riding a beast that's the same thing all the world for the world back to her is that right she governs the world she controls the world Amen politics demonic power and religion she CS the world you see but there is a bride like Abraham hallelujah oh we had a family that were Idol amen but we come out of that ID we come out ofon Bei amen receive a change and receive the ministry ofes and the next these bodies will change Hallelujah glory to God oh brother we can look at those types all night because what isce in Genesis is full matured in Revelation amen when we look at Noah he the type of the end time prophet and his family look at this Noah amen amen Keeping a Secret of the seven seal mystery amen look look Noah the ark amen see he is showing in the days before the flood came there was a flashing red light of his coming is that right before the flood amen how many know that Noah and his family's life are from chapter six of Genesis to chapter 10 amen and in there he is the only Prophet amen of the old test that takes the people into a new world when the whole world is destroy by himself but Noah takes a people with him above the Jud into the new world you see he doesn't go by himself he has an ark to people in that God told him to build with certain measurements amen th say the Lord with with mechanic hallelujah hallelujah oh brother there's something there's some tremendous things in here the mystery of the seven seal no my God help me let's go back to Genesis Genesis 7 amen from chapter six amen God speaks to Noah and he shows that there's an andian civilization that is a seed of The Serpent and they're sons of God that are in a backsliding condition amen amen and there's signs of his of flashing red sign of his coming these things are taking place brother preached it he said women in these days were so pretty amen that the sons of God were falling for that mhm Beauty was at it yeah the same thing is taking place now said look at old pictures of Grandmother amen look at women of 40 years ago 50 years ago he said they weren't so pretty he said look at him today Beauty is on an increase he said in marriage and divorce Satan is her designer what he what he said is that right yeah he is the designer to make the most beautiful woman that brings more souls to Hell than anyroom that's right that's right this was taking place right here in the Book of Genesis before but right there brother only Noah was found worthy Hallelujah only Noah was found at that time this look at Genesis 7 and we see that uh we can read right here what Jesus was speaking on and I want to get straight to the point right here and chapter 7 amen verse 11 it says in the 600th year of Noah's life in the second month the 17th day of the month the same day were all The Fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of Heaven were open see the windows of brother and sister do you understand that the rain for Noah wasn't judgment understand that the rain for Noah and his family those that were in the ark it was Dynamics hallelujah hallelujah was waiting God had already told him the rain is coming the rain is coming the rain is coming get in the AR prach for years he preached but when the time come brother when when God told him it's time to go into the ark he went in the ark oh brother that was a testimony to the world something is taking place you think I've just been preaching and preaching and preaching and preaching now I'm going in said the will be forced to stop preaching amen hallelujah brother the time is coming that we ain't going to be able to preach get in the ark oh Lord the time is going to come we ain't going to be no Minister true Minister there going to be a lot of false still preachers going to be no true minister with the door open telling you that's true amen the door to the AR hallelujah it's the Holy Ghost it's himself that is coming this hour revealed this that's what he said God provided place of worship but we got to recognize that what he said is real and genuine where there two seeds of God sitting together and they're quickened by the spirit amen in the word age they've been lit off by a spot they're set it in Heavenly places in Jesus he there's the door where he his name hallah is that what he said he said that makes manifest entire fullness of Jesus Christ am that makes manifest enti body of Jesus Christ open where the seed is where the seed is the door is open amen notice this oh brother bear with me I I just want to hit something tonight I'm not going to be able to get through all of it but if you will pull with me amen I believe his word is Rich and pure hallelu it's so real amen Amen brother these things that just look like little bible stories straight Mysteries under the seven sece notice amen that Noah

eternal soul in prison now Noah's Ministry all Ministries have done the same Noah preached he went into the ark and when he went into the ark there was seven days that nothing happened his testimony

there was people and he said 300 ministers they were given us space to repit l prison now he said there's people still going to church very religious cross the line amen he souls in prison now he was serious Brother it wasn't a guessing game like this the time it might look like that but a no amen amen you have to understand that something changed that time when the cloud come amen he had to be inside so that the Dynamics could come because for 120 years God no was preaching there's coming something there's coming something there's coming something and what was he doing he was laying Foundation he was laying piece by piece to God he was saying Daniel the he was saying amen revelation of Jesus Christ he was saying 70 weeks of Daniel message of Grace amen Blasphemous name he was

building an ark what is the ark it's Christ word amen I'll be real with you it's the message of the Hallelujah the is the message of the and Noah built it the prophet amen the AR every piece together he would say oh God showed me this he gave me another me amen piece of wood Amen to put it here here it and hotch inside of the messages would come before the message and it would come after the message on on the god do he was building something for a people that was going to escape chch hallelujah hallelu hallelujah Oh Glory to God and what do we see that Noah he was a prophet that was the word of the Lord now watch this watch this real Clos amen the Lord was showing him no the world is falling apart false is at his greatest amen the Bible say violence the Earth wow yeah g a lot of vence women science was at his best true Atomic Power Cell pH electric Atomic power to build things that you can't even build today there's nothing new Under the Sun advanced techology than what men have today amen you see and because of atomic power they shift the Earth off of his orbit they shook it off of its orbit the same thing that will happen today said when these nuclear bombs go off it will shake it back to its orbit and he said because of the ozone layer that will burn it will be closer to the Sun it will burn the that's youres Hallelujah where the fourth V is poured upon the Earth the men scorched being p on the earth Atomic power is going to shake the Earth back into its place because it's been shook off is that imagination that's the word amen amen that's the reason why our calendars are not straight anymore it's supposed to be 30 days to the you know how Jews would tell their calendar every full moon was the entrance into another month that's how they followed it but when the earth sh off his now we have 28 days 31 days and all these kinds of things amen am because it was shooken off you tell time by the stars align with the first Heaven science was at its best technology was at its vience was at it worse amen religion was at its worst you understand all these things taking place and God is fixing to destroy the Earth amen amen the the very man himself was going to destroy himself with his own technology because those things being shot up into the air is what caused the heat by the open those windows because when God first created the Earth he separated amen the waters from the waters and there was Waters above the fir and there was Waters below the fir and the waters above the firmament had never come down but with these Atomic Powers explosions in the atmosphere they ripped that that area and brother mam said when the Earth was shook even from underneath and all over top underneath amen from the rain all these things flood but in this day volcanic fire will come from out of the earth fire will fall from Heaven fire and brim will fall now it's fire ultraviolet rays of the sun will burn me on the earth yes siru it's causing cancer now wait until it shook back into a amen am brother you're worried about global warming it's going to be some real warming pretty soon it ain't going to be warming it's going to be burning amen but we're trying to ese a hotter Place brother am what is it brother God listen to me is fixing to destroy all flesh from the face of the Earth but he was preparing a way of Escape for a specific people elected of God it was a scientific world God's word came to his Prophet Bu The Ark let me read you a quote and God's power to transform this is a powerful quote I've never seen this this way before 1965 B power to transform he said notice in Noah's time he was seeing the word being erected he Noah was seeing the word being erected being construct so what was the word the AR in the word was being erected to Hallelujah who was who was building no line upon line precept upon precept here a little there a little word amen he he put more than than ,200 pieces of wood Hallelujah GL Glory 1200 pieces of said now let me make a little remark the word being put together see the word being put together who put the word together today that's mechanic putting things together it's all all like this but when you put it together it's mechanics who put the the mechanic of God the word being put together for to be transformed listen to this the ark was going to be transformed from the ground to the SK let me assure you that the ark went as high higher the highest of the earth Hallelujah that how high is M Everest that's that's something like that right Hallelujah Glory that's hallelujah praise the Lord is that the look what the prophet is saying the ark was transformed from the ground to the sky what lifted it the prophet was by God hallu hallelujah from a great cloud of mystery to appear and saw mystery Cloud God told him have to be inside the AR because is going to fall hallu let me read theot that the the AR of Noah was the mechanics but the rain the rain glory god is that right brother the rain is the mechanics look what he says here amen amen what shall I do with this Jesus call the Christ what somebody would have said no I want you to explain the mechanics how the AR is going to float he couldn't do it you don't have to know the mechanics it's the Dynamics the Dynamics is what you want to know when that come the art floting hallelujah hallelujah when that home the ark Flo and it took the Ark in a transformation from the ground to the one of these days and I believe it's now that supernaturally and spiritually the bride that is sealed inside of the Ark she is being lifted up into Heavenly place in Christus what isting her up the Hallelujah teaching amen Holy Ghost R what was the light of rain what was the light of rain Church Exposition he said rapturing faith is hallelujah ruring is a type of rapturing Fai and rapturing Faith come when the Thunder sounded let me read you something brother said how did the animals how did they know that it was time to get into the AR brother the animals had more s than the am animals have more s to escape the Judgment hallelujah hallelujah oh my then the backsliding sons of God in the message God's provided way brother says as it was listen to this in the days of Noah he says what happened the first Thunder blasted oh my brother when they knew it was time to get in the ark there was a clap of Thunder Lord there was a BL Bo that sounded like a rocket breaking the sound there you understand what I'm saying when did they know that it was time to go into the ark there was the first Thunder blast he says now I can look up there and I can see the city begin to scoff at it saying wonder what that was a blast went on off somewhere a blast went off somewhere great blast that he thought it was the end of his life he was taking the C off of his and are you with me look at this he says he said the blast went off but look let's look at the animals I can see the the mother bird she's chirping the father is happy and when they heard the Thunder the old mother bird said that's just what Noah said that's coming it's time to go now let's go Hallelujah were they listening to Noah's message hu the camel said that mother come on that's exactly what no said I can see the monkey in the cut tree he said come on mother let's go away they went two by two into the ark something has got to hear the gospel the spirit of God upon the animal life brought animals brought animals into the ark how much more the Holy Ghost is to bring men and women today who believe God and when they hear what the scripture is say when they hear the word and they see this is God's way they run to the ark as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be at the coming of in the message the comforter brother says look at look this there was other boats in the days of Noah amen no wasn't the only Ark amen but he was the only Ark God God the measur God gave this m there's a lot of other denominations but there's only one AR that Judgment of God hallelujah hu every other denomination is going to face the judgments of amen amen there's only one that takes us out of here from the ground hallelujah hallelujah notice what he says then he says but here it is so they said amen so they needed not a boat but here he is building a freak looking thing it's strange to them it's OD the way he's building Hallelujah brother didn't preach like Billy Graham and Oral Roberts he had a different way build Hallelujah huj he had a different way to teach the scriptures go by types and shads amen he would go by every story in the Bible have you noticed how brother man preached he would go back to Noah M Daniel Jesus apost amen amen Lu wesleyy p and now amen every time to preach this message he would go back said let's look back there amen let's look at Noah amen let's look at MES look at Isaiah look at Jesus is that right he had a different way of preaching because that is where the mystery of the whole book in the in in the spoken words of the Original Seed he said this messenger of Malachi 4 was to plant the SE of the that's what he said he was to plant the seed of the whole Bible amen amen amen he says now it was enough he was building a house it looked like a house amen but notice watch this Ark it's kind of fanatically the way he built it did you ever noticed it was made of real light wood amen amen but notice he put three rooms inside of the Ark a beautiful type justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost three rooms he says remember but remember he said he put a window in it he put a window in it where was the window it was in the third story amen Amen brother let me let let me show you something right here in the scripture we we we don't have to you know go into something else but verse six of chapter 8 shows you when that window was open the window was open until the ark fell on the settled on the that's when the window was open Hallelujah the whole time even when he was inside for 40 days water was falling the window was closed amen but when the AR settled down that's when the window was open what was the window look what brother R says here what is that he put He put a window in it the window was not in the side it was in the top justification sanctification Wesley B the Holy Ghost and then the light itself then the light shines that's God's sunlight that we must walk in walk in the light brother that light was from another world he says remember in the bottom floor it was for the creepy things in the second floor they they got off the Earth they they got off of the earth is that right PC got off the Earth amen amen but there was another story above there above above the little B bird Amen brother say first pool little b birds angs so above the birds there was something greater Hallelujah Angelic being connecting with with the elect inside of the Ark amen amen look at this he says but I'm top it was Noah and his family you know why because it wasn't Noah by himself and the ones who listen to his message the ones who received his message the ones that said I'll go in I'll listen this czy man amen I know he's telling the truth I'll go in here hallelujah hallelujah glory to God Amen but all of those who rejected the message of the Prophet died in that destruction brother the same thing is coming in this everyone who rejects this message will have to face tribulation there a way to escape tribulation without without listening hallelu no you'll face tribulation if you don't listen to Noah amen amen hallelujah amen that's how it is brother that he says Oh my he says again he said look what he says right here he says the ark this is the message signs of his coming had one floor two floors three floors is that right where did the light come from where was the window upstairs on the third floor that's where the power of God will come to a church amen amen that's where the power of God will come to a church amen the son shine through there but the way church that God is holding out getting ready bringing in a Ministry to the church that will bring a restoration right because what the P need with the loc with the caterpillar eaten brother that's Malachi that's I will restore is that right amen oh brother let let let me bypass some things here amen amen try to bring this oh my goodness I'm telling you there's so much in here Amen Let us look right here in Genesis Amen in verse 18 and the waters prevailed the word prevailed amen and were increased greatly upon the earth and the Ark went upon the face of the waters Waters prevailed exceedingly upon the Earth and all the high hills were under the whole Heaven were covered upward did the waters Prevail and the mountains were covered is that right Hallelujah and the Ark was above it amen amen the ark was lifted above the Earth says verse 17 is that right let's drop down to chapter8 amen amen verse four and the Ark rested in the seventh month on the seventh day of the month upon the mountains of aror how many knows what means means Holy Ground Hallelujah am what are we seeing we are standing on Holy Ground Amen brother the waters the Dynamics lifting the ark the message with the people inside hallelujah hallelujah lifting it up lifting it up lifting it up higher and higher the same water that lifted Noah destroyed the people brother the
