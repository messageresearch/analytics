[33:03] message and and he talks about the
[33:04] meetings he had there in St Carlos which
[33:06] he had two of them uh in St Carlos one
[33:09] at the Assembly of God church and then
[33:11] one at the church that we're at today
[33:13] the very same building that exist in
[33:15] today and if you've seen any pictures of
[33:17] brother Brandon preaching on the Apache
[33:19] reservation and you see the building
[33:20] that he's standing uh in front of well
[33:22] that building is the building we're in
[33:24] today and that front door is still there
[33:26] today and uh that that's that's where we
[33:28] come from and by the grace of God
[33:30] there's a little group of people who
[33:31] certainly love the Lord and and I
[33:33] believe God has a bride there and uh by
[33:36] his grace we're doing what we can to
[33:38] just keep pressing the battle amen but
[33:40] uh I'm I'm 26 years old and the first
[33:43] time I was here in Sacramento I think we
[33:45] figured it out it was about I was 18
[33:47] years old at the time and uh when I
[33:49] first came to Sacramento it was the this
[33:52] was 2005 it was the very first time I
[33:55] had ever preached anywhere outside IDE
[33:57] the State of Arizona and it was actually
[33:59] really the one of the first times there
[34:00] ever really preached anywhere else
[34:02] besides the local church and uh the Lord
[34:05] called me to preach uh when I was about
[34:07] uh about 15 years old I believe I was
[34:09] and I gave my heart to the Lord when I
[34:11] was 12 and it was in a little house
[34:13] meeting there was a brother uh brother
[34:15] who believed this message and preached
[34:17] this message real solid brother and he
[34:19] wanted to come preach and San Carlos but
[34:21] at that time there was some issues going
[34:23] on with the church and the pastor that
[34:25] was before me he didn't want nothing to
[34:27] do with this message and so he he
[34:28] wouldn't allow any message preachers
[34:30] there so the brother come into town his
[34:32] brother lived in the city of globe which
[34:34] is right next to us and we had service
[34:36] in a in a house in a living room and
[34:38] it's the first time I ever been in a
[34:39] service like that I was raised in church
[34:41] brought to church drugged to church
[34:42] drugged to Sunday school but that didn't
[34:44] mean I was saved because even though I
[34:47] was drugged to church I didn't have a
[34:48] born again experience I had been birth
[34:51] into the family of God just yet you see
[34:53] so just because you're drugged to church
[34:55] don't mean you're safe on sitting in a
[34:57] church warming a Pew doesn't mean you're
[34:59] safe and so that's what I had as a young
[35:02] as a young boy as a kid growing up I was
[35:04] brought to church raised in a church in
[35:05] a Christian home and Christian family
[35:07] firm Believers my grandpa was the pastor
[35:09] who uh started the church that we're at
[35:12] and so uh but this one time we went into
[35:14] this house meeting right and we were
[35:15] sitting in the living room and I
[35:17] remember very clearly I was sitting next
[35:19] to a a bird in a cage whether it was a
[35:22] parrot or peroke or whatever whatever
[35:24] kind of birds talk right so this bird
[35:26] would say a few words like he knew how
[35:28] to say
[35:30] tamali I don't know how but he knew how
[35:32] to say tamali but this bird he also had
[35:34] chrisan parents because he know how to
[35:36] say hallelujah and praise the Lord and
[35:39] so I remember the preacher get up there
[35:40] and he start preaching and that Bird Go
[35:42] hallelujah praise the Lord and I made a
[35:45] statement several times I said you know
[35:46] there's many times that I'm preaching in
[35:48] my church I wish that bird was in there
[35:50] in the church it's more responsive many
[35:52] times than some of the people
[35:54] are and so as I sat next to that little
[35:57] bird and that little Bird's praising the
[35:58] Lord and I'm sitting there and I can't
[36:00] honestly I can't honestly tell you that
[36:02] I remember what the brother preached on
[36:04] I don't I don't remember what he
[36:05] preached on I don't know what songs were
[36:07] sung I don't know who was all there I
[36:09] know I was there my family was there all
[36:11] I knew that the Lord was there because
[36:14] he dealt with me personally and I sat
[36:17] there on the couch at the back of the
[36:18] room as a brother was up here in the
[36:20] front of the room and I sat there
[36:22] weeping uncontrollably I didn't know why
[36:23] I was crying I was just weeping I felt
[36:25] such a sweet presence of a loving
[36:29] merciful compassionate God that was
[36:32] making his love known to me he was
[36:35] letting me know he loved me despite all
[36:39] my mistakes all my sin all my hypocrisy
[36:43] all my failures and shortcomings he was
[36:46] manifesting love to me Hallelujah and I
[36:50] sat there and I wept and I just cried
[36:52] and and the brother was finishing up his
[36:54] sermon and he said is there anybody here
[36:56] who wants prayer and I don't know why
[36:57] but I got up and I ran to the front of
[36:59] the room and I said I need prayer I
[37:00] didn't know what I needed prayer for I
[37:01] just know I wanted him to pray for me he
[37:04] said you ever gave your heart to the
[37:05] Lord I said no I never have he said well
[37:07] let's pray right now and I gave my heart
[37:08] to the Lord in that little house meeting
[37:10] there and I was about 12 years old at
[37:11] the time and then shortly after that so
[37:14] I began to serve the Lord because I
[37:15] wanted to serve the Lord right and so
[37:17] and God was his grace he began to to to
[37:21] deal with me and I remember being in
[37:22] service one time about a couple years
[37:24] after that and uh but maybe a year or so
[37:27] after that service and I remember being
[37:29] in a church service in a meeting and I
[37:31] remember that that the there was an
[37:33] altar call given that night and uh I
[37:35] went down to the altar because I wanted
[37:37] to pray for one of my aunties who was in
[37:39] a hospital sick she was in a uh was a
[37:43] she was a victim of trauma and she was a
[37:45] on life support and it was just a very
[37:47] bad case and so I went to the altar
[37:49] because I wanted to pray for her ask the
[37:51] Lord to heal her and deliver her so I
[37:52] got there and as I started to pray for
[37:54] her all of a sudden there was a small
[37:56] still voice spoke to my heart it wasn't
[37:58] an audible voice but a small still voice
[38:00] spoke to me and said you need to pray
[38:02] for
[38:03] yourself and immediately I began to
[38:06] repent of my sins I said Lord will you
[38:08] forgive me of everything that I've ever
[38:10] done Lord and I I began to cry out and I
[38:12] begin to repent of my sins as I was on
[38:14] the oldfashioned Altra bench with just a
[38:16] homemade Altra bench with a couple of
[38:18] boards and nails and paint splattered on
[38:20] it and uh and I was there praying and I
[38:23] began to pray I began to repent and all
[38:25] of a sudden there came
[38:27] what I had heard people talk about
[38:29] before but I've never experienced before
[38:31] but that night I I experienced it and
[38:34] what was it it was the baptism of the
[38:36] Holy Ghost and the and the and if I
[38:38] could just share for the glory of God
[38:40] how it happened to me you know it may
[38:41] not have happened the same for you but
[38:43] God deals with us differently is that
[38:44] right he know because he in brother bam
[38:47] tells us that God deals with us as
[38:49] individuals is that right it's an
[38:51] individual Affair between you and Jesus
[38:54] amen with Israel he dealt with her as as
[38:56] a nation with you he deals with us as an
[38:59] individual is that right and so as I got
[39:01] on my knees that night and I was down on
[39:02] my knees praying and all of a sudden I
[39:04] felt what I heard people talk about that
[39:06] warm sensation right that feeling they
[39:09] say oh I just F I can't explain it they
[39:10] can just that's all they know how to
[39:12] describe it as well I know what they
[39:13] mean now okay that night there it came
[39:15] and it started it was it started right
[39:17] here at the top of my head and I just fa
[39:19] to take control of my body it literally
[39:22] felt like somebody was covering me with
[39:24] something but there was nothing there I
[39:26] felt like I was being covered you know
[39:28] and as I prayed it started here in my
[39:30] head and and it went through my entire
[39:31] body and as it got down to my feet I
[39:34] begin to cry out to the Lord and speak
[39:36] in tongues and then before I knew it I I
[39:38] had lost control of my body and and I
[39:40] found myself laying flat on my back and
[39:42] and I don't know how long I was there
[39:44] but when I finally come to myself and I
[39:47] woke up and I looked around church was
[39:50] over even parking lot service was over
[39:53] there's nobody talking in the parking
[39:55] lot anymore
[39:57] and I looked around and there was only
[39:58] my aunt who had raised me sister Roa
[40:00] some of you know Sister Roa and she was
[40:02] there and one of the deacons was there
[40:04] and they were just sitting there in the
[40:05] Pew waiting for me and and church was
[40:07] over so I got up you know and I rubbed
[40:09] my eyes and I know how long I don't know
[40:10] I was there an hour 30 minutes two hours
[40:12] who knows and so he come up to me and
[40:15] and he he helped me up you know and I
[40:16] stood up and he said God bless you he
[40:18] patted me on the back said well sure
[40:19] good to see God deal with a young man
[40:21] with a young man and and so he prayed
[40:23] for me and he said okay now now go so I
[40:24] can turn the lights off and close the
[40:25] door everybody's gone so so my
[40:28] grandmother lives right behind the
[40:30] church you see and her it was her
[40:31] husband my grandfather Hansen Bendle who
[40:34] had started the church she lives right
[40:35] behind it so I just you know waddled
[40:38] over to her house right because I'm
[40:39] still a little bit stimulated at this
[40:41] point anybody ever been drunk and any of
[40:43] you ever been drunk on the Holy Ghost
[40:44] you know what I'm talking about and so
[40:46] as I kind of staggered over to her house
[40:48] I walked into her living room and my my
[40:51] my my old patchy Christian Godly
[40:53] grandmother she saw me walking in she
[40:55] was sitting at the table and she just
[40:57] lifted her hands like this and she began
[40:58] to praise the Lord she was just happy to
[41:00] see one of her grandsons get filled with
[41:02] the Holy Ghost so as she just lift her
[41:04] hands began to praise the Lord all of a
[41:06] sudden here it goes started all over
[41:08] again and a spirit of the Lord came down
[41:10] to that house that night and and what I
[41:13] did in the church there it happened all
[41:15] over again right in the living room God
[41:16] gave me a confirmation and I that night
[41:19] God filled me with the Holy Ghost now
[41:22] was I perfect from that point on no no I
[41:24] made a lot of mistakes I try to go my
[41:26] own way I try to figure things out on my
[41:28] own you see it didn't mean I was perfect
[41:31] but you know what something on the
[41:32] inside held me something deep with
[41:35] inside even though I may have try to
[41:37] drift off here drift off there there was
[41:40] something that always pulled me back to
[41:42] my typos back to my absolute right back
[41:45] to Jesus Christ hallelujah oh praise God
[41:50] and so my desires changed I wanted to
[41:52] serve the Lord I wanted more of him well
[41:54] that same brother that preached theight
[41:56] I gave my heart to the Lord he came up
[41:57] to me with a big old box it was like a
[41:59] computer box remember how you used to
[42:00] buy those computers and they weren't
[42:01] flat screens they were wide screens
[42:04] right there were big old cubes well he
[42:06] had a box and it was full of tapes
[42:09] brother Ram's tapes and there was man
[42:11] there was some good one there Christ
[42:12] mystery of God revealed three types of
[42:14] Believers and all these Med he says here
[42:17] brother Kevin he said these are extras
[42:18] you can have them so I started listening
[42:20] to the tapes for myself I had heard of
[42:22] brother brandom I've heard you know of a
[42:24] prophet of God I'd heard of the message
[42:25] I heard of Bri I used to always wonder
[42:27] about these things and there it was boom
[42:28] he said here get into it for yourself
[42:31] and that's exactly what I did I took
[42:33] those tapes and I went my room and I
[42:35] listen to them and listen to them listen
[42:36] to them and I just and I began to eat it
[42:37] all up the Lord would just he was he was
[42:39] opening my eyes and my understanding and
[42:41] and then it was shortly after that about
[42:43] a year after that now by this time I'm
[42:45] about 15 years old from 12 to 15 and and
[42:48] in the space of that time so then I'm in
[42:50] church one night and we used to go to
[42:51] brother Carpenter's church because there
[42:53] wasn't a church at that time there in St
[42:55] Carlos so we were there for the morning
[42:57] service and we drove back to the home
[42:58] Church usually we'd stay for both
[43:00] services for some reason we didn't stay
[43:03] for the evening service at the Mesa
[43:05] church we decided to go home so we had
[43:07] went home which was odd and you know we
[43:08] didn't hardly do that we'd always stay
[43:10] all day and so we went went back to to
[43:13] that home church and as we pulled into
[43:15] the parking lot we noticed that church
[43:17] was still going on even though we were
[43:19] kind of late so we said why don't we go
[43:20] in and see you know what's going on and
[43:22] who's preaching and what's happening you
[43:24] know it seems to be a lot of cars out
[43:25] there for a Sunday night
[43:28] service and so we you know we pulled up
[43:31] and I walk in and the pastor that was
[43:33] before me the one who kind of drifted
[43:34] away from the message he he had a guest
[43:36] speaker there and he was you know I
[43:39] think his name was brother Evans that's
[43:40] all I remember he wasn't he wasn't
[43:42] associated with the message at all I
[43:44] don't know if he believed it if he knew
[43:46] about brother brandom or not but I know
[43:47] that this brother before me wouldn't
[43:48] allow no message preachers in there so I
[43:50] knew he want a message preacher but but
[43:52] come to find out later on now this is
[43:54] after the fact later on I come to find
[43:56] out he was a non-
[43:57] denominational uh Christian minister you
[44:00] see he wasn't associated with any sort
[44:02] of denomination but he had a gift of
[44:04] discernment this brother did and so he
[44:06] was there preaching in the church for
[44:08] this other pastor we walk in and I'm
[44:10] sitting and I walk in and I sit in the
[44:11] back right because I'm late for service
[44:13] anyway we walk in the guy's done
[44:14] preaching so he starts to call the
[44:16] prayer line and he's praying for these
[44:18] people there's about two or three come
[44:19] up see because we're not a big group at
[44:21] all and so just a few come up for prayer
[44:23] he prays for them to be healed and then
[44:24] he looks back to me and he says here
[44:26] there's a young man sitting right here
[44:27] he said why don't you come up here he
[44:29] says so I said all right so I got up he
[44:31] said and bring your mom with you that's
[44:33] your mother right I said no this is my
[44:35] aunt but she is like my mom because she
[44:37] raised me since I was two so he said
[44:39] well yeah that's your mother bring her
[44:40] up so we went up there went up to the
[44:42] front he took me by the hand and he just
[44:44] talked to me that's all he did he
[44:45] started talking how old are you are you
[44:47] in school and he as he was holding my
[44:49] hand talking to me and then he looked at
[44:51] me and he says do you know that you have
[44:53] a call in your life to preach the gospel
[44:56] and I said I've never heard that before
[44:57] and keep in mind I'm 15 years old right
[44:59] and I never heard this before he says
[45:01] yeah he says I see you got a call in
[45:03] your life to preach the gospel he says
[45:05] but he said well I want to tell you
[45:06] something he said he said uh God put
[45:09] this gift in you he said if you'll just
[45:12] read your Bible and stay humble he said
[45:15] God will use you in the right time
[45:17] that's all he told me then he prayed for
[45:18] me you know nothing happened I didn't
[45:20] you know the heavens didn't open up I
[45:21] didn't feel no sensation come over me he
[45:23] just simply prayed for me told me that
[45:26] and that has never left me stay humble
[45:29] and stay in the word and and then he
[45:32] prayed for me I went and sat back down
[45:34] and that you know and so in my mind oh
[45:35] I'm going to be a preacher okay well
[45:37] I'll be 30s something if not 40s I'll
[45:39] have a wife and family first I got to do
[45:41] this first I got to do that first you
[45:43] know that's just your human mind right
[45:45] no wonder why the Bible said my thoughts
[45:47] are not your thoughts neither are my
[45:49] ways your ways sayith the Lord so that
[45:51] was 15 so a year after that now my mom
[45:53] has a first cousin whose name is Johnny
[45:56] Curtis and he is a a prominent uh uh
[46:00] Pentecostal Minister among Native
[46:02] American people now he resides on the
[46:05] fort mcdal Indian Reservation which is
[46:07] on the outskirts of Phoenix Arizona and
[46:10] so he heard about my testimony he called
[46:12] me up one day and said brother I want
[46:14] you to come preach for me for my young
[46:15] people he said I'm having Tent Revival
[46:18] and one night on a Tuesday night is
[46:20] going to be young people service I want
[46:21] you to come and preach so I said well
[46:24] let me pray about it so I prayed I took
[46:25] one day I fasted and then I called them
[46:27] up the next day I gave him an answer I
[46:29] said I'll go ahead and do it I feel led
[46:30] of the Lord to do it I hadn't preached
[46:32] before then you see I had witness a
[46:34] couple of time gave my testimony a
[46:35] couple time witness in the jail house a
[46:37] couple of times before that but I never
[46:39] got up behind the pulpit and preached so
[46:41] at 16 years old I go down to this uh
[46:44] Revival one night and I'm so nervous oh
[46:46] man my knees are shaken my stomach is
[46:49] turning and I and I I got a notebook and
[46:52] I wrote word for word everything I was
[46:54] going to say

[47:01] it's good to be here tonight literally
[47:04] I'm I'm not kidding I wrote down
[47:05] everything I was that's how nervous I
[47:07] was and man I was such a nervous wreck
[47:09] and I got up there because I was never a
[47:11] type you know I was never loud and
[47:12] wanted to be in front all the I was a
[47:14] very shy person I never like giving
[47:17] presentations in front of the my class
[47:20] at school I don't think anybody does how
[47:22] many likes to do that right you see
[47:25] don't mind
[47:26] But but so so I I I got my notes and I
[47:28] got my Bible and he calls me up and keep
[47:30] in mind this is an outdoor ten Revival
[47:32] right and so I get up there and I'm so
[47:35] nervous and I'm shaking and as I get up
[47:37] behind the pulpit you know and I'm
[47:38] greeting everybody all of a sudden from
[47:40] one side of the tent there comes
[47:42] a this wind comes blowing in right it
[47:45] takes my notes and it throws it on the
[47:47] outside of the
[47:49] tent and I look and I say oh now what am
[47:53] I going to do right everything thing I
[47:56] had written down the wind just come in
[47:57] and took it and tossed it on the other
[47:59] side and so I said and I said Lord and I
[48:02] at that moment I said God you're going
[48:03] to need to take control here and and
[48:06] what I did was I I let go and I let God
[48:09] have his
[48:10] way and and I preached a sermon that
[48:13] night uh I took it from the message let
[48:15] your light shine the Brother Band
[48:16] preached and in that message he talks
[48:18] about being Billboards for Jesus and so
[48:20] I preach on being Billboards right
[48:22] advertising the grace and the Salvation
[48:24] that we have and I preach for the young
[48:26] people after I was done preaching I had
[48:28] youth leaders and pastors come up to me

[48:35] time no Brother come on how long you've
[48:37] been preaching brother I said this is my
[48:39] first time they wouldn't believe me but
[48:41] it was I was lying to them right and and
[48:44] but but and I say that for a reason at
[48:45] that moment I knew then God confirmed to
[48:48] me then you have nothing to do with this
[48:52] is that right gifts and callings are
[48:54] without repentance
[48:56] and God taught me and I'm so thankful to
[48:59] my Lord Jesus that he taught me this at
[49:01] a very young age that it's not nothing
[49:03] we can do we can put on I have nothing
[49:05] to say tonight I got no great message to
[49:08] bring to you but if I just simply get
[49:09] out of the way as a yielded surrendered
[49:12] vessel the Holy Ghost will come down and
[49:14] he'll speak to the heart of each one
[49:15] that is ready to receive it and believe
[49:18] it tonight amen then he confirmed
[49:21] because hey anybody can prophesy
[49:23] anything right oh God show me this over
[49:25] you God show me that over you right so
[49:27] so what God did for me was he taught me
[49:28] a lesson to see and wait for that
[49:31] confirmation to confirm it and then I
[49:33] knew oh Lord you know I knew then what
[49:35] the brother was talking about stay
[49:37] humble and stay in the word and from
[49:39] that point on I always tried to to do
[49:41] that to stay humble in the word but I
[49:43] give my testimony for the honor and the
[49:45] glory of God tonight if God can do that
[49:48] for me now so I was 16 years old now
[49:51] after all that being saved giving my
[49:52] heart to the Lord baptized of the Holy
[49:54] Ghost and then started pre preacher when
[49:55] I was 16 years old brother the Bible
[49:58] tells us God is not a respector of
[50:01] persons I said God is not a respector
[50:04] persons if he could do that for me at a
[50:06] young as a young man what can he do for
[50:08] all the rest of the young people tonight
[50:11] the young people that are here the young
[50:13] people that are listening on the
[50:14] internet tonight the young people that
[50:15] are tuned in around the world around the
[50:17] country wherever they might be if God
[50:19] can do that for me he can do that for
[50:22] some other young people is that right oh
[50:24] Hallelujah
[50:26] oh brother and sister the grace of God
[50:28] is so real it's so real I can't walk
[50:31] away from this I can't turn my back on
[50:33] my merciful Lord savior how many times
[50:36] did he not turn his back on me when I
[50:38] failed him oh praise God isn't he so
[50:42] good to
[50:43] us so shortly after that I was a month
[50:46] away from turning 18 years old my
[50:48] birthday's in December and
[50:51] November um the brother that was before
[50:53] me he resigned he said I quit I'm giving
[50:56] the church back to sister Rosie because
[50:57] it sits on her property she can do

[53:51] this in verse 11 of John 1 and he came
[53:54] unto uh he came unto his own and his own
[53:57] received him not but as many as received
[54:01] him to them gave he power to become the
[54:06] sons of God even to them that believe on

[57:34] and we all said amen and amen God bless
[57:37] you you may be
[57:49] seated praise the
[57:52] Lord all right now a powerful church
[57:57] amen I want to start out tonight by
[57:59] reading you something that brother Bram
[58:02] says here from the message called the
[58:04] revelation of Jesus Christ in the church
[58:06] ages now brother bam says here now
[58:09] remember
[58:10] this Christ in the true church is a
[58:15] continuation of the book of Acts but the
[58:18] Book of Revelation shows how that the
[58:21] Antichrist Spirit would come into the
[58:24] church and defile it making it lukewarm
[58:28] formal and
[58:30] Powerless did you catch that I why you
[58:33] stay with me now see look how the
[58:35] prophet of God says now remember that
[58:37] Christ Jesus in the true church what
[58:41] Church the true church well how can you
[58:44] be a part of the true church you got to
[58:45] be born into it as we heard last night
[58:47] right you must be birth into the family
[58:51] of God now that's what the Bible just
[58:52] got done saying in John 1 that he came
[58:55] to his own right and his own received
[58:58] him not that's what happened today in
[59:00] this day in this leod Dean age he has
[59:03] come to his own and the ones who should
[59:05] receive him the ones that should believe
[59:07] him he come to his own and his own
[59:10] receives him not what do they do to him
[59:12] they kick him out right they kick him
[59:15] out of the church and that's why he is
[59:17] pictured in Revelation three knocking on
[59:20] the door trying to get back in right is
[59:23] that right amen so they kicked him out
[59:25] of the church with their ideas with
[59:27] their own uh interpretations with their
[59:29] own doctrines with their own Creeds and
[59:31] and and all these manmade ideas they've
[59:33] kicked Christ out worldliness and and
[59:36] modernistic demons as brother Ram says
[59:38] that has crept into the churches making
[59:41] it lukewarm formal and Powerless luk
[59:46] formal and Powerless right formal
[59:49] lukewarm and Powerless that's what the
[59:52] the leoan spirit has done to the church
[59:54] church now watch this and this is from
[59:56] the testimony of a true witness in 1961
[1:00:00] brother B says here now his word
[1:00:02] testifies in the last days where we at
[1:00:05] today the last days his word testifies
[1:00:08] in the last days that there will come a
[1:00:11] falling away and there would come up a
[1:00:15] cold formal powerless church that's
[1:00:19] where we're living in that's what he
[1:00:21] said now I'm quoting him that's where we
[1:00:23] are living in a coold formal powerless
[1:00:26] Church a church that had no power the
[1:00:30] Bible says having a form of godliness
[1:00:33] but denying the power thereof from such
[1:00:36] turn away now what are some of the
[1:00:39] biggest what they call mega churches in
[1:00:42] the country today are those who won't
[1:00:44] preach against sin they won't preach be
[1:00:46] born again they won't preach clean your
[1:00:48] life up right they only preach blessings
[1:00:51] and prosperity and peace and all these
[1:00:53] wonderful things things to make
[1:00:55] everybody have little warm fuzzy
[1:00:56] feelings right oh they got all these
[1:00:58] warm fuzzy oh I come to church and man
[1:01:00] the pastor's dress nice and stand so
[1:01:03] politely behind the pulpit he doesn't
[1:01:06] slobber he doesn't move around he
[1:01:07] doesn't sweat he doesn't get on to us he
[1:01:09] just stands so nice and so polite and
[1:01:12] everybody's going to heaven and I can't
[1:01:15] condemn the homosexual I can't condemn
[1:01:17] the Muslims I can't condemn these other
[1:01:20] religion oh only God knows what it'll be
[1:01:22] and they don't take a stand they become
[1:01:25] jellyfish a cold formal and thousands
[1:01:29] upon thousands have flocked to these
[1:01:32] churches and and get their funny
[1:01:34] feelings and think that they're going to
[1:01:37] heaven never been born again never
[1:01:39] repented of their sins shame on the
[1:01:42] church shame on the so-called preachers
[1:01:45] who dare stand in the pulpit and not cry
[1:01:48] out against sin it leaves the chur whole
[1:01:52] formal powerless
[1:01:55] condition Hallelujah I wonder why
[1:01:58] brother B said we need this oldfashioned
[1:01:59] Hellfire Brimstone preach it because
[1:02:02] this is what will keep the church clean
[1:02:04] it'll keep the church on fire for the
[1:02:07] glory of
[1:02:09] God people today they just want a pat on
[1:02:12] the back they want everything's going to
[1:02:13] be okay just just sit down pay your ties
[1:02:15] keep coming and everything will be all
[1:02:17] right oh my my my but the word said it
[1:02:20] would be that way in the last days there
[1:02:22] would come a falling away cold formal
[1:02:24] form of godliness it looks good on the
[1:02:27] outside looks good sounds good seems
[1:02:30] good it might be all right having a form
[1:02:33] of godliness but they deny the power
[1:02:36] thereof from such turn away now what let
[1:02:39] me read you another here this is this is
[1:02:41] here brother REM says now in the message
[1:02:43] called All Things in shareport
[1:02:46] 1962
[1:02:48] amen God hates a powerless
[1:02:53] religion come on let it go let it soak
[1:02:57] in that's all right go ahead it's okay
[1:02:58] to be quiet go ahead as long as you're
[1:03:00] thinking about it God hates a powerless
[1:03:05] religion oh Lord help me
[1:03:07] tonight and any religion today that
[1:03:10] hasn't got Christ in it is
[1:03:13] powerless any religion that has not got
[1:03:17] Christ in it is powerless but any
[1:03:21] religion that Christ is in under his own
[1:03:24] blood and it's got power in it you say
[1:03:28] God hates religion without power the
[1:03:31] Bible says your solemn Feast is a stink

[1:03:49] conquer and overthrow the leoty for
[1:03:51] these so-called Shepherds to destroy and
[1:03:54] and Scatter God's precious flock he said
[1:03:57] I will visit upon you pastors the evil
[1:04:00] of your doings because you have an
[1:04:02] obligation as a man of God to preach the
[1:04:05] word gun barrel
[1:04:07] straight not to compromise with the
[1:04:10] spirits of leoda but to take a stand for
[1:04:13] what is right and keep on the fiery
[1:04:18] line if you fail to do so in your church

[1:07:06] you but that's me Hallelujah woo praise
[1:07:09] God that's me right and in that message
[1:07:12] there pick up your pen and write he says
[1:07:14] that that the bride of Christ shall
[1:07:16] become the Living Word of God on display
[1:07:19] it says that she has thus sayith the
[1:07:20] Lord or she keeps still because the
[1:07:23] Bible said that we're not easily tossed
[1:07:26] about with every wind of Doctrine by the
[1:07:28] SLE of men right we're anchored we have
[1:07:30] an absolute we have a typos we're
[1:07:33] anchored down in Jesus Christ by the

[1:07:40] keeps still shall only move under
[1:07:43] leading of the Holy Ghost amen oh praise
[1:07:46] God and it goes on to say that she has
[1:07:47] the mind of Christ well that's what the
[1:07:49] Bible says let this mind be in you that
[1:07:52] was in Christ Jesus
[1:07:54] and by having the mind of Christ she
[1:07:56] knows what God wants done with the word
[1:08:00] he don't want us to debate and argue
[1:08:02] fuss fight this that and the other he
[1:08:04] wants the word to become living

[1:08:25] this Rich leodan church because you're
[1:08:28] lukewarm I'll spew you out of my mouth
[1:08:32] and we've come to that age God sent us
[1:08:35] an Isaiah to chop the things to pieces
[1:08:38] and lay it out before the people cry out
[1:08:41] spare not you think he'd be accepted
[1:08:45] certainly not he'd cry just the same you
[1:08:48] see God hates a powerless religion he's
[1:08:51] got to have power in it he's got to have
[1:08:54] sincerity and sincerity brings power let
[1:08:59] me say it again in case you missed it
[1:09:01] sincerity brings power God don't want a
[1:09:04] bunch of Hypocrites God don't want a
[1:09:06] bunch of makeb Believers he wants
[1:09:08] sincere children of God that'll believe
[1:09:12] every word I didn't say that they could
[1:09:16] understand they could interpret every
[1:09:17] word no they can believe every word you
[1:09:20] know the Bible tells us in the Book of
[1:09:21] Proverbs that the simple Bel believe
[1:09:24] every word I'm not ashamed to say I'm
[1:09:27] simple I'm simple-minded I don't have an
[1:09:29] education I don't understand a lot I was
[1:09:32] never good in school I'm not highly
[1:09:34] educated I'm a simple-minded man but I
[1:09:37] tell you this tonight I believe every
[1:09:39] word of
[1:09:41] God
[1:09:43] hallelujah I believe Genesis to
[1:09:45] Revelation I believe 1947 to
[1:09:48] 1965 everything in between I believe
[1:09:51] this message so much I believe the ones

[1:10:27] oh you simple you're just simple-minded
[1:10:29] you just believe anything no I I don't
[1:10:30] believe anything but I believe the
[1:10:32] Vindication of
[1:10:33] God people today telling us a brother
[1:10:36] man made mistakes or telling us his
[1:10:37] Visions fail they got websites G Lord
[1:10:40] about all the mistakes in this message
[1:10:41] which has caused a falling away and
[1:10:43] shown the people who don't have a birth
[1:10:46] but I tell you what tonight what is done
[1:10:48] for me is it made me search and it just
[1:10:50] made me believe even
[1:10:52] more
[1:10:57] Hallelujah and all these smart and
[1:10:59] highly educated people there the mistake
[1:11:02] here mistake there this one here where
[1:11:04] and what I ask him is where your V
[1:11:05] where's your
[1:11:06] Vindication when did the pillar of fire
[1:11:08] hang over you when did God ever come and
[1:11:11] speak on your behalf show me some
[1:11:14] Vindication I might believe what you
[1:11:16] have to say I don't just believe
[1:11:18] everything that people say to me I don't
[1:11:21] just go out and assume any old thing I'm
[1:11:23] not tossed about by every wind of
[1:11:26] Doctrine by the sweet of men but I watch
[1:11:28] the Vindication of the pet of fire and I
[1:11:32] see the hand of
[1:11:37] God now that's something I can
[1:11:39] follow I don't know about the rest of
[1:11:41] them amen W praise God Almighty amen but
[1:11:45] don't worry it's just all promised in
[1:11:47] the word they'll be a falling away
[1:11:49] falling away right now the minute look
[1:11:52] what brother B said now this is just
[1:11:53] going on a little bit further here I'm
[1:11:55] not going to be too much long but in
[1:11:58] Samarian Church age he says here the
[1:12:01] minute that the church moved toward form
[1:12:05] and ceremony toward the priesthood by
[1:12:08] organizing the ministers into a group
[1:12:11] and decided that leadership would be on
[1:12:13] them instead of the holy spirit that
[1:12:16] moment death entered in and she the
[1:12:20] church she's a church right she is
[1:12:22] always a church
[1:12:24] hello because a bride is always a woman
[1:12:27] right just like the moon represented a
[1:12:29] woman it's a type of the church right I
[1:12:32] know in this sick twisted world today
[1:12:33] men want to be Brides but this is
[1:12:35] because they're possessed with an evil
[1:12:38] spirit is that right but a bride is
[1:12:41] always a type of a woman Jesus is
[1:12:44] referred to as the bridegroom well if
[1:12:47] he's going to be a bridegroom that must
[1:12:48] mean there's a bride somewhere that he's
[1:12:50] a groom
[1:12:51] too hello
[1:12:55] and so she is also the church you me we
[1:12:59] are we are all part of the Church of the
[1:13:03] Living God we are the church we are the
[1:13:05] body right because that is the True
[1:13:07] Church of Jesus Christ she is the body
[1:13:10] of Jesus brother B says it like this all
[1:13:13] that God was poured into Jesus all that
[1:13:16] Jesus was was poured into the
[1:13:18] church Jesus Christ Jesus of Nazareth
[1:13:22] was God God in a
[1:13:24] body the church the bride today is Jesus
[1:13:28] in his
[1:13:30] body doesn't the Bible say at that day
[1:13:34] what day the day of Pentecost at that
[1:13:36] day you shall know I'm in my father my
[1:13:39] father's in me I am in
[1:13:42] you
[1:13:43] hallelujah praise God that'll make you
[1:13:47] shout should at least make you smile at
[1:13:50] least put a smile on your face tonight
[1:13:54] amen you are the body isn't that what
[1:13:57] Paul teaches us we are the body we're a
[1:14:00] body whose body Jesus's
[1:14:03] body praise God and the minute that the
[1:14:07] church moved into formalism and
[1:14:10] ceremonies and religion and she took the
[1:14:13] leadership of the Holy Spirit and put it
[1:14:15] on man that's when the body started to
[1:14:18] get sick brother REM even goes on to say
[1:14:21] in another message that the sickest body
[1:14:22] I know is the body Jesus Christ remember
[1:14:24] that she began to get sick and as she
[1:14:27] got sick she changed into a powerless
[1:14:29] group of people whose only weapon was
[1:14:33] argument wow only weapon was argument
[1:14:38] wow she could produce nothing in the
[1:14:41] spirit her hopes were built on a program
[1:14:45] and not on faith in his word they sold a
[1:14:48] program they reaped a program they sold
[1:14:51] perversion they reaped per perverted
[1:14:54] children no sincerity now look what he
[1:14:56] says in pardon in Tucson 1963 see we're
[1:15:00] moving up no sincerity no real sorrow
[1:15:05] for
[1:15:07] sin Brother people today they can sin
[1:15:10] and not even feel guilty about it they
[1:15:12] can cut you off on the freeway pull out
[1:15:15] a gun and shoot you and not even feel
[1:15:17] remorse about doing it not even thinking
[1:15:20] that this might be some some you know
[1:15:22] some child father some some uh some
[1:15:25] wife's husband right that that's
[1:15:27] providing for them they don't think
[1:15:28] about they just R away just kill you
[1:15:30] look at them wrong look at them funny
[1:15:31] they'll just flat out kill you and not
[1:15:34] think about it you there's so much of
[1:15:35] this going on today there's violence
[1:15:37] there's there's there's murders there's
[1:15:39] rapes there's uh perverts that are doing
[1:15:42] just horrible things and not been
[1:15:44] feeling guilty about it oh they don't
[1:15:45] care you see it's a sign of the times
[1:15:48] where we're living at today there's no
[1:15:50] real sorrow for sin you see and the
[1:15:53] saddest thing is that when the church
[1:15:54] begins to get in that condition she has
[1:15:58] no real sorrow for sin he said that he'd
[1:16:01] hide his face from their rituals you see
[1:16:03] their prayers were powerless they prayed
[1:16:05] oh sure they prayed they went up and
[1:16:07] they said their prayers and they offered
[1:16:09] sacrifice but it all became a
[1:16:11] form it wasn't honest it wasn't sincere
[1:16:14] and remember he said brother B said
[1:16:16] sincerity brings power without the
[1:16:19] sincerity we become
[1:16:22] powerless but we're not supposed to be
[1:16:24] powerless we're supposed to be
[1:16:27] powerful and if you don't believe me let
[1:16:29] me give you another quote from what does
[1:16:31] it take to make a Christian amen Chicago
[1:16:35] Illinois 1957 he says now if the Church
[1:16:38] of the Living God which is the Pillar of
[1:16:41] Truth God intended this church that's
[1:16:45] you that's me God intended this church
[1:16:50] to be a powerful Church of a glorious
[1:16:53] Church a church that the whole world can
[1:16:56] look upon as the bride of Christ well
[1:17:00] expected an espouse to live in such an
[1:17:04] atmosphere and to conduct itself in a
[1:17:07] way that God would be proud of this
[1:17:11] church to present it to Christ at the
[1:17:14] coming of the
[1:17:16] Lord that scripture Ephesians Paul said
[1:17:20] she'll be a glorious Church
[1:17:23] right without spot without
[1:17:27] wrinkle you missed it it was a shout
[1:17:29] moment for you right there you missed it
[1:17:31] a
[1:17:34] church without
[1:17:36] spot without wrinkle come on oh that
[1:17:40] that's good brother Kevin but you don't
[1:17:41] know what I did that's good brother
[1:17:43] Kevin but you don't know my life you
[1:17:44] don't know the struggles you don't know
[1:17:45] let me tell you something right now we
[1:17:47] are real human
[1:17:51] beings hold on hold on hold on hold on
[1:17:53] hold on okay wait
[1:17:55] wait right here I don't see any angels
[1:17:59] in this room tonight I mean they're here
[1:18:01] but we can't see them in the flesh we
[1:18:02] see them in the spirit sure the angels
[1:18:04] of the Lord are around about them that
[1:18:06] serve in fear God right so sure there's
[1:18:08] mtps by the angels of God here but
[1:18:11] here's you tonight as human we are real
[1:18:13] life humans who deal with real life
[1:18:14] problems why do we hide from it why are
[1:18:16] we ashamed to preach against these
[1:18:18] things to talk about marriages to talk
[1:18:20] about families to talk about troubles in
[1:18:22] the home to talk about what's going on
[1:18:23] in the church I'm sorry but I'm being a
[1:18:25] little bit of a pastor right now but why
[1:18:26] do we hide from these things if you just
[1:18:28] excuse me for a minute and one then
[1:18:30] wonder why all the victory's gone out of
[1:18:32] the church right where's all the joy
[1:18:34] where's all the victory at you see we
[1:18:35] are real life people who deal with real
[1:18:37] life problems and we can't just hide it
[1:18:39] under the rug and pretend this don't
[1:18:41] happen around here we're the bride of
[1:18:42] Christ we don't do those things no we
[1:18:44] are real life people who deal with real
[1:18:47] life problems and real life situation
[1:18:50] but the difference of us and the world
[1:18:53] is is there's a present help in the time
[1:18:56] of
[1:19:01] trouble when I'm in trouble I'll run to
[1:19:04] the rock for the rock is higher than
[1:19:09] I that's what separates us from the rest

[1:19:16] watching over
[1:19:21] me you make make your life a you make
[1:19:24] your life a broken mess and there's a

[1:19:37] nothing but Brokenness and
[1:19:41] strife and a

[1:19:50] Brokenness and strife but he made
[1:19:52] something beautiful out of my life oh

[1:20:01] my life many times and God rich in his
[1:20:04] Mercy said Bring Me The Broken

[1:20:12] the potter's
[1:20:15] wheel he told
[1:20:17] Jeremiah he said can I not do with
[1:20:20] Israel as this Potter does with his clay
[1:20:23] take these little broken pieces bring
[1:20:26] them to the master and the master says I
[1:20:29] know exactly what form is supposed to be
[1:20:31] in so he'll take it in his arms of
[1:20:33] tender love and mercy he doesn't throw
[1:20:36] them away he doesn't smash it throw to
[1:20:37] Pieces he takes him and he puts him on
[1:20:40] the wheel and the wheel begins to spin
[1:20:42] he melts him down and he begins to heat
[1:20:45] it up and it gets hot and it gets
[1:20:47] intense but don't worry little bride

[1:33:14] promise of God will bring it to
[1:33:16] pass we must have the right attitude we
[1:33:19] going to have the right thinking the
[1:33:21] right attit to we would be perfect in

[1:33:29] belief put on artificial emotional
[1:33:32] workup it'll be a

[1:33:39] of the sweetness of the oil of gladness
[1:33:42] Hallelujah the precious oil of the Holy
[1:33:45] ghosts brother there there there might
[1:33:48] be a lot of counterfeits yes but you
[1:33:49] know what there is also a
[1:33:52] genuine the only reason why there is a
[1:33:54] fake is because there is a genuine
[1:33:56] somewhere right now now now there's a
[1:34:00] there's a there's a there's a
[1:34:01] counterfeit $100 bill right there is
[1:34:03] there's out they're out they're out here
[1:34:04] and that's why every store you go to
[1:34:06] they got those little markers right if
[1:34:08] you give them a $100 bill they got to
[1:34:10] check it they got to hold it up to the
[1:34:11] light you know because they don't trust
[1:34:12] you they don't they don't trust you
[1:34:14] you're probably making fake money
[1:34:15] somewhere huh so they you give them a 20
[1:34:18] you give them a 50 you give them 100
[1:34:19] they got to mark it they got to test it
[1:34:21] why because there's a fake out there
[1:34:22] right but just because there's a fake
[1:34:24] doesn't make him afraid of the real
[1:34:26] thing that right are you understand what
[1:34:29] I'm saying it it doesn't it doesn't it
[1:34:31] doesn't make him afraid of the real
[1:34:32] thing so they'll accept it right they
[1:34:35] just got to check it
[1:34:40] first check it first that
[1:34:44] right oh brother there might be
[1:34:46] impersonation but don't let that
[1:34:47] distract you from the real true genuine
[1:34:49] that God has available to the bride of

[1:36:52] serve a God who can be right here and
[1:36:55] there at the same
[1:37:00] time one day a woman came running to
[1:37:02] Jesus a gentile woman she said Lord my
[1:37:05] daughter is vexed with a devil I need
[1:37:07] your help Jesus didn't even answer just
[1:37:10] kept right on walking the disciples got
[1:37:12] annoyed they said Lord send her away she
[1:37:14] cries after us he just kept walking and
[1:37:18] uh and she kept crying she kept begging
[1:37:22] asking Jesus said it's not meant to take
[1:37:24] the children's bread and cast it to a
[1:37:26] dog called her a
[1:37:28] dog you would think she' have left the
[1:37:30] church you would think she'd have walked
[1:37:32] out slammed the door throw a rock in the
[1:37:33] pastor's car but she didn't do
[1:37:37] that she said yes
[1:37:40] Lord I am a
[1:37:42] dog but even dogs eat of the crumbs from
[1:37:46] the master's
[1:37:50] table
[1:37:52] and Lord if I could only get a crumb
[1:37:54] tonight if I could just get a crumb I
[1:37:57] just get a little
[1:38:01] taste praise
[1:38:04] God I didn't read it to you but I have
[1:38:07] it right
[1:38:08] here I I didn't read it
[1:38:12] tonight but brother Brandon
[1:38:14] says God doesn't have any weak
[1:38:18] Parts there's no weak Parts in God he is
[1:38:24] all together
[1:38:27] strong he says if you only have a little
[1:38:31] speckle of God in you you have power to
[1:38:36] create a
[1:38:37] world and go out and live on it a
[1:38:40] speckle a
[1:38:42] speckle maybe you feel so far maybe you
[1:38:44] feel separated from God you know those
[1:38:47] feelings come around us human beings we
[1:38:51] we
[1:38:52] feel we feel like failures we feel like
[1:38:55] we've done sin away our day of Grace and
[1:38:58] that Old Devil he don't make it no
[1:38:59] better because he comes along and when
[1:39:02] he comes along he says yeah you messed
[1:39:04] up yeah you failed yeah and he just
[1:39:06] pushes and plugs at you right that's
[1:39:08] what that Old Devil does you see but
[1:39:12] remember how Jesus said he is a liar and
[1:39:14] a father of it right he's a liar and
[1:39:17] he's a father of Lies there's not one
[1:39:20] reason we have to believe anything that
[1:39:23] the devil says to
[1:39:26] us I started to say just a minute ago
[1:39:29] that he cannot possess
[1:39:32] you you are God's Property
[1:39:36] tonight he has no rights on you as a son
[1:39:41] as a daughter of God no rights on God's
[1:39:46] properly brother bradam says he's
[1:39:49] nothing but a squatter he's nothing but
[1:39:52] a
[1:39:53] freeloader he's nothing but a
[1:39:56] bluff call his bluff
[1:40:01] tonight the spirit of God is here
[1:40:05] exposing the
[1:40:08] Devil he's exposing him because when
[1:40:12] he's exposed he is
[1:40:14] weakened
[1:40:16] Hallelujah that's why the devil hates
[1:40:19] Revelation that's why he's fighting you
[1:40:21] even now but don't you let him have his
[1:40:24] way you're a conqueror start living like
[1:40:27] one you are a child of God you're a son
[1:40:30] and a daughter don't let the devil push
[1:40:32] you around

[1:40:39] longer he has no rights on you he can't
[1:40:42] possess you he can't he can't do it he
[1:40:45] fights he tries but he has no way to
[1:40:48] possess you so you know what he does
[1:40:49] instead he tries to put oppression on
[1:40:52] you he tries to squeeze the life of God
[1:40:55] out of you he tries to squeeze it out
[1:40:58] but he has no
[1:41:04] right oh he puts that oppression he puts
[1:41:07] that discouragement he puts those
