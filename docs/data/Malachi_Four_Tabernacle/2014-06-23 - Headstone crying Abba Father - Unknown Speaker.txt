TRANSCRIPT
========================================
did you know that there's things that we can do amen if there's something between you and is you expect this is what we say do we see that speed don't be seen right yeah amen that's why because the spirit the order in the church but we must unite our faith together and we together are an agreement but it's not collectively being given it's not because i receive a revelation you all receive it at the same time with him it's got to be god it's got to be the holy spirit the new birth is a revelation revelation and then we're going to have a fire show hallelujah and he said they waited until the fire show was going to be and he said then the man announced to the speakers because at least we gotta wait till that hour let's get ready for the fire falling time the thing to do is separate yourself from all sin separate yourself from anything that pertains you stay right straight then it's not the word amen hallelujah this is for the bride going home the growing home of the bride we got something different the pentecostals represented that again the same holy spirit would you the secret rapture you see there in the scriptures became but what was supposed to be to the jewish bride what was supposed to be the headstone became the cornerstone amen the foundation stone i because is rejected wow jesus christ peter says is become this is serious this is life and death it'll be like just preaching a good sermon about the hedge fund and then going home came and slaughtered them all corinthians remember brother ram said everybody you read the story over in the book of chronicles when they were building the temple of solomon they could not finish building according to the grace of god which is given to me as a wise master builder that lay the foundation and another building thereof but let every man take heed how he builded their homes corinthians 3 10 to turn to receive the coming of christmas that's exactly what appeared yes i believe the holy ghost we have to wake up to the reality but the has been rejected is illegal was a temporal gift is is amen hallelujah oh you oh just the holy ghost is is he's got his from you know how i shake the church ages that's what we will forgive against he goes is is that's exactly what's taking place ministry to the world is amen but we all know that it's a glorious time for the church what a horrible time for the unbelief amen is just a sign in the end sir it's a horrible time for the unbeliever but it's a glorious time we're living in one of the most dangerous times all it ever was since the world began no problem no pasta this is the end of the thing it's written in the skies hallelujah it's written over the face of the earth it's written in every newspaper the reason done back there when he comes first time why okay because it did not come or if it go how many were here we seen exactly jesus go knocks that message out of the church they go off into a deep end amen and then make grace with this phrase is to make him what god be destinating him to be hello to reach all right amen that was in god's mind says the message turn on the line is taking her and showed her those things and in those days went into a room it opened the door a yesterday is okay um baptism see he says he said the church has become closer in the minority his name that the ministry has got to be the same kind of ministry that he had this is you take that for what it's worth yes sir that oh is it's here but i think it's like it's like this and it's like that yes it's happening it's open but it's is it open or not visit us you know

like that kind of ministry see that will bring and the church has come coming of the lord oh don't be the rough part on it brother see my pentecostal brethren don't be the oh into these issues and things like that that we see going on today you see what he's connecting with in order hallelujah is my father crying man my god my god you'll feel your spiel yes see i believe that with all my heart you see what i mean it's christ now it's all about taking the rags is having the same image that's going on the paper right now one in union it reminds me right but of this great welsh life they went tell me what building the headstone come on is some father said you'll be they're still waiting for the dynamics to come up is because he was rejected see wait that's right all right that fit around the headstone hello is you see what it is it's predestinated sons and daughters of god there are hallelujah romans are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for we have not received the spirit of bondage against the fear but we have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry have a father foreign is foreign adoption oh no bro we gotta wait this mentality that's the way it's been taught we're waiting in the statue of a perfect man it says we're waiting for that to come the eternal church amen we're divine love of god amen grace brings to you divine love it was what had always been looking for the where that had always been like i said come to be revealed to him to bring him in the presence of the angel of god actually amen he thing but they rejected brother yeah they reject it see what happens when that come but that's the legal he says he said sailors why well why okay why okay after this it's for this who's gonna go preach what that revelation brought down what was taking place while he was preaching hallelujah back to express hallelujah how he had reached maturity um what about what he said in the fourth steel they know how to handle the word where's that
