[0:00] if a man loves me keep my word we know
[0:05] that is true that God will meet a
[0:07] desperate
[0:11] Soul we all know that but it usually
[0:14] takes
[0:16] something to drive us into that into
[0:20] that
[0:21] despair into that
[0:24] desperation it takes something to do
[0:27] it and we find in James
[0:32] 515 that the effectual fervent
[0:37] prayer of the righteous man availeth
[0:41] much when a righteous man gets in
[0:45] travail or Soul
[0:49] travel see
[0:51] travail Soul
[0:54] travel Hallelujah you see what brother R
[0:57] is doing here Soul travel
[1:00] Amen brother it's connected with another
[1:04] realm your soul travels Amen to the
[1:09] throne of God to make your petition
[1:12] known
[1:14] boldly amen by Faith by the blood of
[1:18] Jesus Christ Paul said in Hebrews I make
[1:22] my petition known boldly Before the
[1:24] Throne of
[1:26] God amen amen hallelujah amen this is
[1:29] the reason why amen that we see here
[1:34] that the prophet is showing us what this
[1:38] is amen amen when we
[1:41] come the fervent prayer of a righteous
[1:45] man his soul gets in
[1:49] travail Soul
[1:51] travel I think travel is a better
[1:57] word amen a soul gets in
[2:01] desperation see in
[2:04] travailing an effectual fervent prayer
[2:07] of a
[2:09] man that can show the
[2:12] token you see
[2:14] that it can show that can show the
[2:19] token see brother and sister the token
[2:23] in
[2:24] prayer brother bam said every
[2:26] time that we're going to pray before God
[2:31] he said make sure you wave your
[2:35] token before God in every prayer amen
[2:41] what is the token that life inside of
[2:45] you brother that's the only thing that
[2:48] can
[2:49] pray in in the
[2:52] spirit like Jesus amen amen because
[2:56] brother Bram said when you pray like
[2:59] that
[3:00] in questions and answers on the seals
[3:04] they asked him that if Jesus was God how
[3:08] come he prayed to the
[3:10] father amen amen and he said you see he
[3:14] prayed to the spirit that was with
[3:17] inside of him amen amen and that Spirit
[3:21] Hallelujah within you will pray to the
[3:26] same spirit it's in contact
[3:30] Hallelujah the same way that the spirit
[3:34] was in Jesus praying to the father amen
[3:38] the spirit in you the holy spirit amen
[3:43] in the name of Jesus
[3:45] Christ well ask the father anything and
[3:49] it shall be given you and brother Bram
[3:52] say it isn't you praying no more it's
[3:55] the spirit praying inside of you the
[3:59] Bible says in Romans 8 that when we
[4:02] don't know how to pray or we what to
[4:06] pray the spirit itself maketh
[4:10] intercessions with groanings that cannot
[4:13] be uttered Hallelujah in other words
[4:17] it's not in your
[4:19] vocabulary it's not in your mind it's
[4:22] from your
[4:23] soul crying out to God in an unknown
[4:28] language that only the spirit realm
[4:33] knows Hallelujah your words can't
[4:36] express it your mouth can't say it it
[4:40] comes from your
[4:41] soul and God understands that kind of
[4:46] language Hallelujah God understands that
[4:50] kind of
[4:52] travail from the soul hallelujah
[4:55] hallelujah that kind of
[4:57] cry he said cry unto me
[5:00] and I will
[5:01] respond hallelujah hallelujah amen I
[5:05] will answer glory to God Amen and I will
[5:09] show you great
[5:10] things that you have not
[5:13] known hallelujah hallelujah that's the
[5:16] god that David said his ears are open to
[5:22] the
[5:22] prayers of the
[5:25] righteous and his eyes look down upon
[5:30] his
[5:30] Saints that's the god that we serve
[5:34] brother amen amen he says then there you
[5:39] are you're in
[5:41] prayer can
[5:43] confess Amen to me that you're wrong see
[5:50] and I love you well enough that I'll
[5:54] will pray for you and you pray for me
[5:58] and we'll stay with it
[6:00] with the effectual frent
[6:03] prayer until it's
[6:05] answered that's
[6:08] desperation amen hallelujah brother and
[6:11] sister whatever
[6:14] happened with
[6:16] praying till something
[6:18] happens does that does that nobody does
[6:22] that
[6:23] anymore you see what I'm saying that
[6:26] used to be brother Bram said
[6:30] amen the Church of
[6:32] old amen amen he said up in the hills of
[6:35] Kentucky they would pray till something
[6:40] happen
[6:42] hallelujah amen amen and brother Bram
[6:45] said that's the kind of thing that is
[6:50] desperation you stay with it until it's
[6:54] answered that's
[6:57] desperation that's what we should have
[7:01] listen what the prophet is saying all
[7:03] the
[7:04] time oh Hallelujah so what drives us
[7:07] into
[7:09] desperation
[7:11] love is that right and the reason we
[7:14] lack desperation because we lack love
[7:16] many
[7:19] times now notice he says let's he said
[7:23] let's take some scriptures here for
[7:25] example of
[7:28] this
[7:31] Jacob he was kind of a Carefree
[7:34] boy he thought his own
[7:37] mind that he knew the birth right meant
[7:41] everything to
[7:42] him and he didn't care how he got how
[7:46] how he had to get
[7:48] it but after he got
[7:50] it how many know what the what what the
[7:53] birth right
[7:56] represents it represents the Holy Ghost
[8:00] amen amen but listen to this sometimes
[8:04] once we get that we think that's
[8:08] it amen we think oh Hallelujah that's it
[8:12] I don't have to I don't have to be
[8:14] desperate
[8:16] anymore I was already desperate for it
[8:20] the night that I had my
[8:22] experience and now now I don't have to
[8:25] be desperate
[8:27] anymore that was Jacob
[8:30] amen amen once he got the birth
[8:33] right he thought everything was all
[8:36] right because he had the birth right he
[8:40] thought the thing was
[8:42] settled and he come up to his
[8:45] brother amen when he when he was hungry
[8:48] coming to the field from
[8:50] working and his brother needed a a a big
[8:54] pot of
[8:56] pottage we might have been
[9:00] tempting when a man is
[9:02] hungry working all day and his brother
[9:05] said I'm just ready to faint give me
[9:07] some of
[9:09] this he said well if he swear out to
[9:12] give me your birth
[9:13] right he didn't care how he done it he
[9:16] just got
[9:18] it and when when Jacob got the birth
[9:21] right he thought that settled it
[9:25] Pentecost that's where you
[9:28] failed thought because you were born of
[9:30] the
[9:31] spirit born of the spirit of
[9:34] God the
[9:36] birthright you thought that settled it
[9:39] but it only starts
[9:41] it you remember in the
[9:44] message hear ye him how that the
[9:48] child after it was born in the
[9:51] family he become a son it had rights to
[9:55] the birth right but it had to be proven
[9:59] it had to be child trained and if he did
[10:02] not prove out to be an obedient
[10:05] child to the father's
[10:07] will then well it didn't get what he
[10:11] didn't become
[10:13] Heir amen amen it it it it hired
[10:18] nothing yet it was a son but he hired
[10:23] nothing if he wasn't
[10:26] interested in the father's work
[10:30] and so when the Holy
[10:31] Ghost fell upon the Pentecostal
[10:35] people they began to restore back the
[10:38] gifts that was in the church and they
[10:41] thought because they were born of the
[10:44] spirit that settled it but you see
[10:48] there's got to be a
[10:50] placing of a son and after this to be a
[10:54] real
[10:56] son he was taken to a public place
[10:59] he was set up there and changed
[11:03] robes and sat there there was the
[11:07] placing of the son that he had heir of
[11:10] everything the father
[11:12] had now notice how the prophet is
[11:17] connecting he started off with Jacob
[11:20] then and then he says that's where
[11:23] Pentecost
[11:24] fell amen Amen brother it's not just the
[11:27] birth right
[11:29] the birth right brings you to the
[11:32] foundation of the P of the
[11:34] pyramid hallelujah hallelujah and
[11:36] without faith it is
[11:39] impossible to to please God but faith is
[11:44] revelation now get this don't miss this
[11:47] faith is at the bottom of the
[11:50] pyramid is that right amen amen and what
[11:53] is faith faith is a revelation is that
[11:57] right faith is a revelation
[11:59] a
[12:00] revelation something that has been
[12:02] revealed to
[12:04] you before it
[12:07] happened glory to God hallelujah
[12:10] before you come to
[12:12] Perfection you you have to have a
[12:15] revelation of
[12:17] perfection you understand so you're down
[12:21] here at the bottom of the P by faith
[12:25] you're
[12:26] seeing the Capstone of divine love
[12:31] hallelujah hallelujah and that vision of
[12:34] your faith is what's leading you to that
[12:39] climax it's what's leading you
[12:42] Hallelujah to that Perfection step by
[12:45] step hallelujah hallelujah amen faith
[12:48] upon Faith Revelation upon
[12:51] Revelation amen you're walking towards
[12:55] what you have before
[12:57] you you're walking walking towards your
[13:00] promise you're walking towards your full
[13:03] inheritance hallelujah hallelujah the
[13:06] huge
[13:07] portion of Heaven awaits you that's your
[13:12] inheritance hallelujah hallelujah it's
[13:14] the portion of Heaven that is
[13:18] granted unto you as a son that has come
[13:24] to be
[13:26] Heir hallelujah hallelujah doesn't the
[13:29] Bible say in genes in Revelations
[13:33] 21 that his son Jesus Christ is he he
[13:38] made him
[13:39] he of all
[13:41] things in the city is that right
[13:45] hallelujah amen brother he is
[13:48] showing that how that
[13:51] stature of a perfect man the fullness of
[13:55] Christ amen when he came to that
[13:57] positioning
[13:59] and the father gave him that
[14:02] Authority glory to God he became a with
[14:07] the father and he said all power is
[14:11] given unto me in heaven and in Earth
[14:15] because he was given that Authority
[14:19] glory to God we
[14:22] become with Christ and
[14:25] coair hallelujah hallelujah amen amen
[14:29] amen that is the reason why this is
[14:32] about
[14:34] sunship hallelujah hallelujah it's not
[14:38] just amen am to have the life in
[14:41] you but the life in you is going to lead
[14:46] you it's going to it's going to show you
[14:50] every step of the way it's going to show
[14:53] you what you have to do in the father's
[14:57] business that's what the the spirit is
[14:59] for amen the spirit is not just to say I
[15:03] got the
[15:05] spirit that's what the Pentecostals did
[15:08] they got the spirit and they said I got
[15:11] the spirit that's good now that you got
[15:14] the
[15:15] spirit what is it going to do in you
[15:19] there it is you see what I'm saying the
[15:22] spirit in you will will
[15:24] fulfill the word for the
[15:27] hour spirit in you will bring to pass
[15:32] the predestinated
[15:34] scripture hallelujah hallelujah for the
[15:37] hour that you're living in and that's
[15:39] where they failed he says see there is
[15:42] an
[15:43] heir so when the Holy Ghost fell upon
[15:45] the Pentecostal
[15:48] people they thought that was
[15:50] it see but God did the same thing with
[15:54] his son amount
[15:57] Transfiguration and he trans figured
[15:58] before them said this is my beloved Son
[16:02] whom I'm well
[16:04] pleased
[16:05] Moses and the law failed but this is him
[16:11] hear ye him he was placed Jacob thought
[16:16] that the birth right made everything
[16:19] right so did the
[16:21] Pentecostals you see listen what he says
[16:25] and that's what got them fussing and
[16:27] pulling at one another
[16:30] it
[16:31] proved that the to
[16:34] token wasn't
[16:37] showing amen it proved that the token
[16:42] wasn't
[16:44] showing why listen brother because
[16:49] malice envy stri and these
[16:53] things but that's where it got
[16:57] to see the token wasn't
