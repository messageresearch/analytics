the Temple of the Holy Ghost is that right and if there's anybody tonight in this world who has the right to rejoice and to be glad it ought to be the Bride of Jesus Christ if anybody has a right to worship Him it ought to be us tonight amen the Bible tells us that God is a spirit and they that worship must Worship in spirit and in truth but it also says that the father seeketh such to worship him which tells us that the father wants to be worshiped and it's it's amazing to think in your mind that God the creator of Heaven and Earth who has everything at his hands would have a desire yet he does being our father amen has a desire to be worshiped and as he looks across the world tonight I wonder if he Search and say who will worship me tonight who will get themselves out of the way throw

leading Us in the praising and worshiping tonight uh I just want to take a moment and greet you tonight in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ it's good to see all of you here tonight it's good to see some familiar faces amen and it's good to see some new faces as well amen but uh for those you don't know me I'm uh brother Kevin from s Carlos the Apache reservation Kevin cador and I've been pastoring the little Church in St Carlos this November on the second the same day as my wedding anniversary will be 10 years since uh I've been pastoring the little church there and uh the very first time now if I just give you a real brief testimony of how my fire got lit if I could just share that for the glory of God tonight those of you who may not know me and wonder who I am and where I come from but uh brother Dave uh introduced me last night as being from Phoenix that's all right brother David he say a reservation in Phoenix I said no it's actually about 90 miles or two hours East of Phoenix so but uh anyhow we're there in San Carlos aache reservation some some of you may have heard of San Carlos or you may have heard of the Apaches brother brand mentions it several times throughout the message and and he talks about the meetings he had there in St Carlos which he had two of them uh in St Carlos one at the Assembly of God church and then one at the church that we're at today the very same building that exist in today and if you've seen any pictures of brother Brandon preaching on the Apache reservation and you see the building that he's standing uh in front of well that building is the building we're in today and that front door is still there today and uh that that's that's where we come from and by the grace of God there's a little group of people who certainly love the Lord and and I believe God has a bride there and uh by his grace we're doing what we can to just keep pressing the battle amen but uh I'm I'm 26 years old and the first time I was here in Sacramento I think we figured it out it was about I was 18 years old at the time and uh when I first came to Sacramento it was the this was 2005 it was the very first time I had ever preached anywhere outside IDE the State of Arizona and it was actually really the one of the first times there ever really preached anywhere else besides the local church and uh the Lord called me to preach uh when I was about uh about 15 years old I believe I was and I gave my heart to the Lord when I was 12 and it was in a little house meeting there was a brother uh brother who believed this message and preached this message real solid brother and he wanted to come preach and San Carlos but at that time there was some issues going on with the church and the pastor that was before me he didn't want nothing to do with this message and so he he wouldn't allow any message preachers there so the brother come into town his brother lived in the city of globe which is right next to us and we had service in a in a house in a living room and it's the first time I ever been in a service like that I was raised in church brought to church drugged to church drugged to Sunday school but that didn't mean I was saved because even though I was drugged to church I didn't have a born again experience I had been birth into the family of God just yet you see so just because you're drugged to church don't mean you're safe on sitting in a church warming a Pew doesn't mean you're safe and so that's what I had as a young as a young boy as a kid growing up I was brought to church raised in a church in a Christian home and Christian family firm Believers my grandpa was the pastor who uh started the church that we're at and so uh but this one time we went into this house meeting right and we were sitting in the living room and I remember very clearly I was sitting next to a a bird in a cage whether it was a parrot or peroke or whatever whatever kind of birds talk right so this bird would say a few words like he knew how to say tamali I don't know how but he knew how to say tamali but this bird he also had chrisan parents because he know how to say hallelujah and praise the Lord and so I remember the preacher get up there and he start preaching and that Bird Go hallelujah praise the Lord and I made a statement several times I said you know there's many times that I'm preaching in my church I wish that bird was in there in the church it's more responsive many times than some of the people are and so as I sat next to that little bird and that little Bird's praising the Lord and I'm sitting there and I can't honestly I can't honestly tell you that I remember what the brother preached on I don't I don't remember what he preached on I don't know what songs were sung I don't know who was all there I know I was there my family was there all I knew that the Lord was there because he dealt with me personally and I sat there on the couch at the back of the room as a brother was up here in the front of the room and I sat there weeping uncontrollably I didn't know why I was crying I was just weeping I felt such a sweet presence of a loving merciful compassionate God that was making his love known to me he was letting me know he loved me despite all my mistakes all my sin all my hypocrisy all my failures and shortcomings he was manifesting love to me Hallelujah and I sat there and I wept and I just cried and and the brother was finishing up his sermon and he said is there anybody here who wants prayer and I don't know why but I got up and I ran to the front of the room and I said I need prayer I didn't know what I needed prayer for I just know I wanted him to pray for me he said you ever gave your heart to the Lord I said no I never have he said well let's pray right now and I gave my heart to the Lord in that little house meeting there and I was about 12 years old at the time and then shortly after that so I began to serve the Lord because I wanted to serve the Lord right and so and God was his grace he began to to to deal with me and I remember being in service one time about a couple years after that and uh but maybe a year or so after that service and I remember being in a church service in a meeting and I remember that that the there was an altar call given that night and uh I went down to the altar because I wanted to pray for one of my aunties who was in a hospital sick she was in a uh was a she was a victim of trauma and she was a on life support and it was just a very bad case and so I went to the altar because I wanted to pray for her ask the Lord to heal her and deliver her so I got there and as I started to pray for her all of a sudden there was a small still voice spoke to my heart it wasn't an audible voice but a small still voice spoke to me and said you need to pray for yourself and immediately I began to repent of my sins I said Lord will you forgive me of everything that I've ever done Lord and I I began to cry out and I begin to repent of my sins as I was on the oldfashioned Altra bench with just a homemade Altra bench with a couple of boards and nails and paint splattered on it and uh and I was there praying and I began to pray I began to repent and all of a sudden there came what I had heard people talk about before but I've never experienced before but that night I I experienced it and what was it it was the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the and the and if I could just share for the glory of God how it happened to me you know it may not have happened the same for you but God deals with us differently is that right he know because he in brother bam tells us that God deals with us as individuals is that right it's an individual Affair between you and Jesus amen with Israel he dealt with her as as a nation with you he deals with us as an individual is that right and so as I got on my knees that night and I was down on my knees praying and all of a sudden I felt what I heard people talk about that warm sensation right that feeling they say oh I just F I can't explain it they can just that's all they know how to describe it as well I know what they mean now okay that night there it came and it started it was it started right here at the top of my head and I just fa to take control of my body it literally felt like somebody was covering me with something but there was nothing there I felt like I was being covered you know and as I prayed it started here in my head and and it went through my entire body and as it got down to my feet I begin to cry out to the Lord and speak in tongues and then before I knew it I I had lost control of my body and and I found myself laying flat on my back and and I don't know how long I was there but when I finally come to myself and I woke up and I looked around church was over even parking lot service was over there's nobody talking in the parking lot anymore and I looked around and there was only my aunt who had raised me sister Roa some of you know Sister Roa and she was there and one of the deacons was there and they were just sitting there in the Pew waiting for me and and church was over so I got up you know and I rubbed my eyes and I know how long I don't know I was there an hour 30 minutes two hours who knows and so he come up to me and and he he helped me up you know and I stood up and he said God bless you he patted me on the back said well sure good to see God deal with a young man with a young man and and so he prayed for me and he said okay now now go so I can turn the lights off and close the door everybody's gone so so my grandmother lives right behind the church you see and her it was her husband my grandfather Hansen Bendle who had started the church she lives right behind it so I just you know waddled over to her house right because I'm still a little bit stimulated at this point anybody ever been drunk and any of you ever been drunk on the Holy Ghost you know what I'm talking about and so as I kind of staggered over to her house I walked into her living room and my my my my old patchy Christian Godly grandmother she saw me walking in she was sitting at the table and she just lifted her hands like this and she began to praise the Lord she was just happy to see one of her grandsons get filled with the Holy Ghost so as she just lift her hands began to praise the Lord all of a sudden here it goes started all over again and a spirit of the Lord came down to that house that night and and what I did in the church there it happened all over again right in the living room God gave me a confirmation and I that night God filled me with the Holy Ghost now was I perfect from that point on no no I made a lot of mistakes I try to go my own way I try to figure things out on my own you see it didn't mean I was perfect but you know what something on the inside held me something deep with inside even though I may have try to drift off here drift off there there was something that always pulled me back to my typos back to my absolute right back to Jesus Christ hallelujah oh praise God and so my desires changed I wanted to serve the Lord I wanted more of him well that same brother that preached theight I gave my heart to the Lord he came up to me with a big old box it was like a computer box remember how you used to buy those computers and they weren't flat screens they were wide screens right there were big old cubes well he had a box and it was full of tapes brother Ram's tapes and there was man there was some good one there Christ mystery of God revealed three types of Believers and all these Med he says here brother Kevin he said these are extras you can have them so I started listening to the tapes for myself I had heard of brother brandom I've heard you know of a prophet of God I'd heard of the message I heard of Bri I used to always wonder about these things and there it was boom he said here get into it for yourself and that's exactly what I did I took those tapes and I went my room and I listen to them and listen to them listen to them and I just and I began to eat it all up the Lord would just he was he was opening my eyes and my understanding and and then it was shortly after that about a year after that now by this time I'm about 15 years old from 12 to 15 and and in the space of that time so then I'm in church one night and we used to go to brother Carpenter's church because there wasn't a church at that time there in St Carlos so we were there for the morning service and we drove back to the home Church usually we'd stay for both services for some reason we didn't stay for the evening service at the Mesa church we decided to go home so we had went home which was odd and you know we didn't hardly do that we'd always stay all day and so we went went back to to that home church and as we pulled into the parking lot we noticed that church was still going on even though we were kind of late so we said why don't we go in and see you know what's going on and who's preaching and what's happening you know it seems to be a lot of cars out there for a Sunday night service and so we you know we pulled up and I walk in and the pastor that was before me the one who kind of drifted away from the message he he had a guest speaker there and he was you know I think his name was brother Evans that's all I remember he wasn't he wasn't associated with the message at all I don't know if he believed it if he knew about brother brandom or not but I know that this brother before me wouldn't allow no message preachers in there so I knew he want a message preacher but but come to find out later on now this is after the fact later on I come to find out he was a non- denominational uh Christian minister you see he wasn't associated with any sort of denomination but he had a gift of discernment this brother did and so he was there preaching in the church for this other pastor we walk in and I'm sitting and I walk in and I sit in the back right because I'm late for service anyway we walk in the guy's done preaching so he starts to call the prayer line and he's praying for these people there's about two or three come up see because we're not a big group at all and so just a few come up for prayer he prays for them to be healed and then he looks back to me and he says here there's a young man sitting right here he said why don't you come up here he says so I said all right so I got up he said and bring your mom with you that's your mother right I said no this is my aunt but she is like my mom because she raised me since I was two so he said well yeah that's your mother bring her up so we went up there went up to the front he took me by the hand and he just talked to me that's all he did he started talking how old are you are you in school and he as he was holding my hand talking to me and then he looked at me and he says do you know that you have a call in your life to preach the gospel and I said I've never heard that before and keep in mind I'm 15 years old right and I never heard this before he says yeah he says I see you got a call in your life to preach the gospel he says but he said well I want to tell you something he said he said uh God put this gift in you he said if you'll just read your Bible and stay humble he said God will use you in the right time that's all he told me then he prayed for me you know nothing happened I didn't you know the heavens didn't open up I didn't feel no sensation come over me he just simply prayed for me told me that and that has never left me stay humble and stay in the word and and then he prayed for me I went and sat back down and that you know and so in my mind oh I'm going to be a preacher okay well I'll be 30s something if not 40s I'll have a wife and family first I got to do this first I got to do that first you know that's just your human mind right no wonder why the Bible said my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are my ways your ways sayith the Lord so that was 15 so a year after that now my mom has a first cousin whose name is Johnny Curtis and he is a a prominent uh uh Pentecostal Minister among Native American people now he resides on the fort mcdal Indian Reservation which is on the outskirts of Phoenix Arizona and so he heard about my testimony he called me up one day and said brother I want you to come preach for me for my young people he said I'm having Tent Revival and one night on a Tuesday night is going to be young people service I want you to come and preach so I said well let me pray about it so I prayed I took one day I fasted and then I called them up the next day I gave him an answer I said I'll go ahead and do it I feel led of the Lord to do it I hadn't preached before then you see I had witness a couple of time gave my testimony a couple time witness in the jail house a couple of times before that but I never got up behind the pulpit and preached so at 16 years old I go down to this uh Revival one night and I'm so nervous oh man my knees are shaken my stomach is turning and I and I I got a notebook and I wrote word for word everything I was going to say good evening God bless you my name is it's good to be here tonight literally I'm I'm not kidding I wrote down everything I was that's how nervous I was and man I was such a nervous wreck and I got up there because I was never a type you know I was never loud and wanted to be in front all the I was a very shy person I never like giving presentations in front of the my class at school I don't think anybody does how many likes to do that right you see don't mind But but so so I I I got my notes and I got my Bible and he calls me up and keep in mind this is an outdoor ten Revival right and so I get up there and I'm so nervous and I'm shaking and as I get up behind the pulpit you know and I'm greeting everybody all of a sudden from one side of the tent there comes a this wind comes blowing in right it takes my notes and it throws it on the outside of the tent and I look and I say oh now what am I going to do right everything thing I had written down the wind just come in and took it and tossed it on the other side and so I said and I said Lord and I at that moment I said God you're going to need to take control here and and what I did was I I let go and I let God have his way and and I preached a sermon that night uh I took it from the message let your light shine the Brother Band preached and in that message he talks about being Billboards for Jesus and so I preach on being Billboards right advertising the grace and the Salvation that we have and I preach for the young people after I was done preaching I had youth leaders and pastors come up to me and they say oh praise God brother Ken how long you been preaching I said this is my first time no Brother come on how long you've been preaching brother I said this is my first time they wouldn't believe me but it was I was lying to them right and and but but and I say that for a reason at that moment I knew then God confirmed to me then you have nothing to do with this is that right gifts and callings are without repentance and God taught me and I'm so thankful to my Lord Jesus that he taught me this at a very young age that it's not nothing we can do we can put on I have nothing to say tonight I got no great message to bring to you but if I just simply get out of the way as a yielded surrendered vessel the Holy Ghost will come down and he'll speak to the heart of each one that is ready to receive it and believe it tonight amen then he confirmed because hey anybody can prophesy anything right oh God show me this over you God show me that over you right so so what God did for me was he taught me a lesson to see and wait for that confirmation to confirm it and then I knew oh Lord you know I knew then what the brother was talking about stay humble and stay in the word and from that point on I always tried to to do that to stay humble in the word but I give my testimony for the honor and the glory of God tonight if God can do that for me now so I was 16 years old now after all that being saved giving my heart to the Lord baptized of the Holy Ghost and then started pre preacher when I was 16 years old brother the Bible tells us God is not a respector of persons I said God is not a respector persons if he could do that for me at a young as a young man what can he do for all the rest of the young people tonight the young people that are here the young people that are listening on the internet tonight the young people that are tuned in around the world around the country wherever they might be if God can do that for me he can do that for some other young people is that right oh Hallelujah oh brother and sister the grace of God is so real it's so real I can't walk away from this I can't turn my back on my merciful Lord savior how many times did he not turn his back on me when I failed him oh praise God isn't he so good to us so shortly after that I was a month away from turning 18 years old my birthday's in December and November um the brother that was before me he resigned he said I quit I'm giving the church back to sister Rosie because it sits on her property she can do whatever she wants with it that's my grandmother and uh so we decided what are we going to

Church a powerful Church in the book of St John we want to go to chapter number one amen praise the Lord Jesus amen now keep in mind what our our brother Caleb brought to us last night about the birth right we got to be born again now watch what this scripture says here now it goes right good together now you see you take them both and you'll see what the Lord is bringing across to us in this late hour in the book of St John chapter number one we read here starting at verse number 11 now watch this in verse 11 of John 1 and he came unto uh he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of God is that right as many as received him he gave him what power to become Sons and Daughters of God now let's turn also to the book of Acts chapter 1 the book of Acts The Acts of the Apostles the uh the book in which the Holy Ghost was was given or that we read about rather that was written by Luke um part of it uh Luke in in the book of Acts chapter number one notice how in verse number eight this is quoting Jesus himself now if you have that type of a Bible that has Words of Christ in red you'll see this is in red here right and so this is quoting Jesus himself in Acts chapter 1 verse number 8 but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and uh un uh in jerus J Alem and unto all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the Earth right now one more scripture if you while you're standing and that's 1 Corinthians chapter 4 verse 20 amen how many love the word of God Amen thank you Jesus how many appreciate that teaching last night wasn't that wonderful amen praise God to see the new birth in the Old Testament now now in the book of 1 Corinthians chapter 4 1 Corinthians chapter 4 verse 20 I just want to read that one verse look what Paul says for the kingdom of God is not in word but in power for the kingdom of God is not in word but in power let's bow our heads and pray our most gracious Heavenly Father you're so good to us Jesus you've done so much for us Lord we thank you for the wonderful privilege of being in the house of God tonight on this Saturday night Saturday evening Lord when the rest of the world is parting it up Lord what they consider what they think is life to them but Lord is only death for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord and we pray tonight help us to draw from the inexhaustible Fountain of Life Lord help us father to open up our spiritual eyes to see our spiritual ears and may our hearts be softened by the Holy Ghost to receive the word of the Lord father I pray that you would speak to us tonight out of your word as your humble unworthy servant that I am I ask that you would move me aside Lord may I not hinder the moving of the spirit tonight but I pray God that you would Grant to to your children Lord that which they desire tonight Lord whatever their needs are I pray that you minister to them Lord in the name of Jesus Christ as we give you all the honor and the glory that you're worthy of in Jesus mighty name we pray and we all said amen and amen God bless you you may be seated praise the Lord all right now a powerful church amen I want to start out tonight by reading you something that brother Bram says here from the message called the revelation of Jesus Christ in the church ages now brother bam says here now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless did you catch that I why you stay with me now see look how the prophet of God says now remember that Christ Jesus in the true church what Church the true church well how can you be a part of the true church you got to be born into it as we heard last night right you must be birth into the family of God now that's what the Bible just got done saying in John 1 that he came to his own right and his own received him not that's what happened today in this day in this leod Dean age he has come to his own and the ones who should receive him the ones that should believe him he come to his own and his own receives him not what do they do to him they kick him out right they kick him out of the church and that's why he is pictured in Revelation three knocking on the door trying to get back in right is that right amen so they kicked him out of the church with their ideas with their own uh interpretations with their own doctrines with their own Creeds and and and all these manmade ideas they've kicked Christ out worldliness and and modernistic demons as brother Ram says that has crept into the churches making it lukewarm formal and Powerless luk formal and Powerless right formal lukewarm and Powerless that's what the the leoan spirit has done to the church church now watch this and this is from the testimony of a true witness in 1961 brother B says here now his word testifies in the last days where we at today the last days his word testifies in the last days that there will come a falling away and there would come up a cold formal powerless church that's where we're living in that's what he said now I'm quoting him that's where we are living in a coold formal powerless Church a church that had no power the Bible says having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away now what are some of the biggest what they call mega churches in the country today are those who won't preach against sin they won't preach be born again they won't preach clean your life up right they only preach blessings and prosperity and peace and all these wonderful things things to make everybody have little warm fuzzy feelings right oh they got all these warm fuzzy oh I come to church and man the pastor's dress nice and stand so politely behind the pulpit he doesn't slobber he doesn't move around he doesn't sweat he doesn't get on to us he just stands so nice and so polite and everybody's going to heaven and I can't condemn the homosexual I can't condemn the Muslims I can't condemn these other religion oh only God knows what it'll be and they don't take a stand they become jellyfish a cold formal and thousands upon thousands have flocked to these churches and and get their funny feelings and think that they're going to heaven never been born again never repented of their sins shame on the church shame on the so-called preachers who dare stand in the pulpit and not cry out against sin it leaves the chur whole formal powerless condition Hallelujah I wonder why brother B said we need this oldfashioned Hellfire Brimstone preach it because this is what will keep the church clean it'll keep the church on fire for the glory of God people today they just want a pat on the back they want everything's going to be okay just just sit down pay your ties keep coming and everything will be all right oh my my my but the word said it would be that way in the last days there would come a falling away cold formal form of godliness it looks good on the outside looks good sounds good seems good it might be all right having a form of godliness but they deny the power thereof from such turn away now what let me read you another here this is this is here brother REM says now in the message called All Things in shareport 1962 amen God hates a powerless religion come on let it go let it soak in that's all right go ahead it's okay to be quiet go ahead as long as you're thinking about it God hates a powerless religion oh Lord help me tonight and any religion today that hasn't got Christ in it is powerless any religion that has not got Christ in it is powerless but any religion that Christ is in under his own blood and it's got power in it you say God hates religion without power the Bible says your solemn Feast is a stink right a stink in the nostrils of God you see somebody say oh God hates you better believe it amen if you don't know God hates you better go read your Bible again right I hate the Deeds of the nicians is that what he says right to conquer and overthrow the leoty for these so-called Shepherds to destroy and and Scatter God's precious flock he said I will visit upon you pastors the evil of your doings because you have an obligation as a man of God to preach the word gun barrel straight not to compromise with the spirits of leoda but to take a stand for what is right and keep on the fiery line if you fail to do so in your church it ends up powerless cold and formal you see don't get mad at me I'm just cing him that's tonight that's all I'm doing you see he hates a powerless religion amen the Bible says that leod DEA was lukewarm cold right and uh and and and they they they were rich and increase with Goods but they have need of nothing right didn't know they were naked poor miserable blind and did not know they were that condition that is a sign of the deception where we're living today our day right right now this minute a deception from the enemy to make the people think I got it all I don't need nothing else no you're not you're poor naked miserable and blind he said you're not hot you're not red on fire and you're not totally backslid you're just in the middle lukewarm God said I will spew thee out of my mouth it makes me sick to see the Church of God in a lukewarm condition hallelujah praise God Almighty preaching brother Kevin amen I yes I will amen quieter you get the harder I'm going to preach amen oh Hallelujah you want Revival here it is you want the moving of God here it is tonight clean the Church of the Living God up get rid of these worldly things get rid of these modernistic demons the Philistines are upon thee let's call it out let's make it right amen oh Hallelujah then we'll move on with the power of God you see to be in a lukewarm condition you know what brother bam says let me just stop for a minute brother bam says in the church ages about the lukewarm condition he said what made him lukewarm they had an abundance of the word what he says check up on it he they the church they have an abundance of the word is that right message books MP3 players websites abundance of the word right you don't got to buy the tapes no more right you can just get them on MP3 format you want that right I've got every message on an MP3 plus the uh the the the the Deep call to the Deep videos on a little on a little thing like this an abundance easy access just right here readily available to the church brother B said they have an abundance of the word but they don't do anything with it that's what he said Hallelujah an abundance of the word but they don't do nothing with it it left them in a lukewarm condition and pick up your pen and write you remember that one pick up your pen and write which was what the spirit of the Lord came to the prophet and said pick up your pen I have a message of uh from Christ to the church I don't know about you but that's me Hallelujah woo praise God that's me right and in that message there pick up your pen and write he says that that the bride of Christ shall become the Living Word of God on display it says that she has thus sayith the Lord or she keeps still because the Bible said that we're not easily tossed about with every wind of Doctrine by the SLE of men right we're anchored we have an absolute we have a typos we're anchored down in Jesus Christ by the word of the Living God and the bride will have thus sayeth the Lord or she keeps still shall only move under leading of the Holy Ghost amen oh praise God and it goes on to say that she has the mind of Christ well that's what the Bible says let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus and by having the mind of Christ she knows what God wants done with the word he don't want us to debate and argue fuss fight this that and the other he wants the word to become living manifested written Epistles read of all men that's what the Bible said right oh praise God okay well let's move on then leod deia because now here I'm going back to brother B here in all things in shreport 196 to now remember he told this Rich leodan church because you're lukewarm I'll spew you out of my mouth and we've come to that age God sent us an Isaiah to chop the things to pieces and lay it out before the people cry out spare not you think he'd be accepted certainly not he'd cry just the same you see God hates a powerless religion he's got to have power in it he's got to have sincerity and sincerity brings power let me say it again in case you missed it sincerity brings power God don't want a bunch of Hypocrites God don't want a bunch of makeb Believers he wants sincere children of God that'll believe every word I didn't say that they could understand they could interpret every word no they can believe every word you know the Bible tells us in the Book of Proverbs that the simple Bel believe every word I'm not ashamed to say I'm simple I'm simple-minded I don't have an education I don't understand a lot I was never good in school I'm not highly educated I'm a simple-minded man but I tell you this tonight I believe every word of God hallelujah I believe Genesis to Revelation I believe 1947 to 1965 everything in between I believe this message so much I believe the ones I haven't even heard yet that's how much I believe in hallelujah praise God without any private interpretation right you say well explain this explain that I may not be able to explain it but if he said it I believe it explain this explain that get your Hebrew series get your seven seal get this and explain I may not be able to explain every single thing to the letter but if he said it then I believe it now somebody says somebody you know we we I get criticized for that they say oh you simple you're just simple-minded you just believe anything no I I don't believe anything but I believe the Vindication of God people today telling us a brother man made mistakes or telling us his Visions fail they got websites G Lord about all the mistakes in this message which has caused a falling away and shown the people who don't have a birth but I tell you what tonight what is done for me is it made me search and it just made me believe even more Hallelujah and all these smart and highly educated people there the mistake here mistake there this one here where and what I ask him is where your V where's your Vindication when did the pillar of fire hang over you when did God ever come and speak on your behalf show me some Vindication I might believe what you have to say I don't just believe everything that people say to me I don't just go out and assume any old thing I'm not tossed about by every wind of Doctrine by the sweet of men but I watch the Vindication of the pet of fire and I see the hand of God now that's something I can follow I don't know about the rest of them amen W praise God Almighty amen but don't worry it's just all promised in the word they'll be a falling away falling away right now the minute look what brother B said now this is just going on a little bit further here I'm not going to be too much long but in Samarian Church age he says here the minute that the church moved toward form and ceremony toward the priesthood by organizing the ministers into a group and decided that leadership would be on them instead of the holy spirit that moment death entered in and she the church she's a church right she is always a church hello because a bride is always a woman right just like the moon represented a woman it's a type of the church right I know in this sick twisted world today men want to be Brides but this is because they're possessed with an evil spirit is that right but a bride is always a type of a woman Jesus is referred to as the bridegroom well if he's going to be a bridegroom that must mean there's a bride somewhere that he's a groom too hello and so she is also the church you me we are we are all part of the Church of the Living God we are the church we are the body right because that is the True Church of Jesus Christ she is the body of Jesus brother B says it like this all that God was poured into Jesus all that Jesus was was poured into the church Jesus Christ Jesus of Nazareth was God God in a body the church the bride today is Jesus in his body doesn't the Bible say at that day what day the day of Pentecost at that day you shall know I'm in my father my father's in me I am in you hallelujah praise God that'll make you shout should at least make you smile at least put a smile on your face tonight amen you are the body isn't that what Paul teaches us we are the body we're a body whose body Jesus's body praise God and the minute that the church moved into formalism and ceremonies and religion and she took the leadership of the Holy Spirit and put it on man that's when the body started to get sick brother REM even goes on to say in another message that the sickest body I know is the body Jesus Christ remember that she began to get sick and as she got sick she changed into a powerless group of people whose only weapon was argument wow only weapon was argument wow she could produce nothing in the spirit her hopes were built on a program and not on faith in his word they sold a program they reaped a program they sold perversion they reaped per perverted children no sincerity now look what he says in pardon in Tucson 1963 see we're moving up no sincerity no real sorrow for sin Brother people today they can sin and not even feel guilty about it they can cut you off on the freeway pull out a gun and shoot you and not even feel remorse about doing it not even thinking that this might be some some you know some child father some some uh some wife's husband right that that's providing for them they don't think about they just R away just kill you look at them wrong look at them funny they'll just flat out kill you and not think about it you there's so much of this going on today there's violence there's there's there's murders there's rapes there's uh perverts that are doing just horrible things and not been feeling guilty about it oh they don't care you see it's a sign of the times where we're living at today there's no real sorrow for sin you see and the saddest thing is that when the church begins to get in that condition she has no real sorrow for sin he said that he'd hide his face from their rituals you see their prayers were powerless they prayed oh sure they prayed they went up and they said their prayers and they offered sacrifice but it all became a form it wasn't honest it wasn't sincere and remember he said brother B said sincerity brings power without the sincerity we become powerless but we're not supposed to be powerless we're supposed to be powerful and if you don't believe me let me give you another quote from what does it take to make a Christian amen Chicago Illinois 1957 he says now if the Church of the Living God which is the Pillar of Truth God intended this church that's you that's me God intended this church to be a powerful Church of a glorious Church a church that the whole world can look upon as the bride of Christ well expected an espouse to live in such an atmosphere and to conduct itself in a way that God would be proud of this church to present it to Christ at the coming of the Lord that scripture Ephesians Paul said she'll be a glorious Church right without spot without wrinkle you missed it it was a shout moment for you right there you missed it a church without spot without wrinkle come on oh that that's good brother Kevin but you don't know what I did that's good brother Kevin but you don't know my life you don't know the struggles you don't know let me tell you something right now we are real human beings hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on okay wait wait right here I don't see any angels in this room tonight I mean they're here but we can't see them in the flesh we see them in the spirit sure the angels of the Lord are around about them that serve in fear God right so sure there's mtps by the angels of God here but here's you tonight as human we are real life humans who deal with real life problems why do we hide from it why are we ashamed to preach against these things to talk about marriages to talk about families to talk about troubles in the home to talk about what's going on in the church I'm sorry but I'm being a little bit of a pastor right now but why do we hide from these things if you just excuse me for a minute and one then wonder why all the victory's gone out of the church right where's all the joy where's all the victory at you see we are real life people who deal with real life problems and we can't just hide it under the rug and pretend this don't happen around here we're the bride of Christ we don't do those things no we are real life people who deal with real life problems and real life situation but the difference of us and the world is is there's a present help in the time of trouble when I'm in trouble I'll run to the rock for the rock is higher than I that's what separates us from the rest of the world I have a savior who's watching over me you make make your life a you make your life a broken mess and there's a merciful god that says bring me the broken pieces and I'll put it back together my love my grace my Mercy I got nothing but Brokenness and strife and a beautiful of my life all I had to offer him was Brokenness and strife but he made something beautiful out of my life oh hallelujah oh man you I made a mess in my life many times and God rich in his Mercy said Bring Me The Broken Pieces I'll melt them down and put it on the potter's wheel he told Jeremiah he said can I not do with Israel as this Potter does with his clay take these little broken pieces bring them to the master and the master says I know exactly what form is supposed to be in so he'll take it in his arms of tender love and mercy he doesn't throw them away he doesn't smash it throw to Pieces he takes him and he puts him on the wheel and the wheel begins to spin he melts him down and he begins to heat it up and it gets hot and it gets intense but don't worry little bride your father is just molding you he's just shaping you into His Image into his likeness hallelujah oh praise God oh thank you Jesus Oh Hallelujah bring me those broken pieces I'll mend them all back together again is that right oh thank you Jesus a glorious Church you see what makes us different sure we have shortcomings we have failures we have mistakes we have all these faults in our lives but you know what it is if we could just learn to look at each other the way God looks at us when God looks at us he doesn't see me in my present messed up condition are you foll me is there anybody can help me preach tonight God doesn't see you in your current position all messed up bruised bloody battered he doesn't see those things when when God looks at you he looks through the red blood that covers the earth and all he hears is the voice of Jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do he doesn't look at you right now some of you are away from the Lord but he ain't looking at that right now some of you have gotten cold in your spirit he ain't looking at that right now some of you had backsliding but he ain't looking at that right now that right right whom I have called I have Justified who I have Justified I have glorified when when when was your name put in the Lamb's Book of Life when was your name before you even had a chance to do right or roong before you even had an opportunity to accept him as Savior he already knew you and he put your name there your name written in heaven no wonder why Jesus says Rejoice not that the devils are subject to you you remember that is that right there's a lot of impersonators today Rejoice not that the devils are subject to you but rather Rejoice for your name is written in heaven Hallelujah and when was it written there before the foundation of the world when was the Lamb of God slain for you before the foundation of the world whom I have forn I have predestined right predestinated seeds Hallelujah all that is in my hand I will not lose one why can why can God say things like that you know why God can say things like that because whom he has forn right he's predestined right he knew you before you were even in your mother's womb before you even had an opportunity before you were born before you and your mother womb before Mom and Dad even met before they were in their mother's wombs he already knew you would be here he had already predestined he was already destined for you to be do you understand Church of God that you have a Divine Purpose in your life don't let the devil tell you that you're worthless you have Divine Purpose in being here there's Divine Purpose for you existing and that's why the devil is trying to oppress you because he can't possess you so he to oppress you are you following me oh I'm going to preach now brother the devil has no rights on you that's right that's right unless God gives permission he can't even put nothing on you unless our father says so that right Hallelujah he's just a tool in the hand of God right he's like a little puppy dog on a leash right that's all he is he he has no Authority he has no power and he can't do anything unless my father knows about it first right now who started that whole thing with job who started that God did there's a perfect and upright man in the land they say yeah it's cuz you bless him so much but you let me get a hold of him I can make him curse you to your face go ahead touch him do whatever you want but don't touch his life family cattle money finances Bank even his own physical body everything the hand of Satan went and destroyed it all but his life was reserved purpose for God God said go right ahead but he knows what he's doing the Bible says he is able to comp complete the work that he has started if he started something in you he's going to finish it all the way why because he's the author and the finisher of our faith glory to God oh man that song comes to my head I wish somebody's Soul would catch on fire burning with the Holy Ghost let the devil know that you know who your are who you are right he's got no claims on us because brother B says that God intended the church to be a powerful church church let me see what time is it it's almost time to quit so now look what he says here this is from okay okay now Redemption by power look what he says 1954 Redemption by that's a powerful title right now you're always now look at this look at this you're always pointing out how Wicked the world is getting I've been guilty of that I have I'll be honest I'll be honest I've been guilty of always talking about how bad everything is yeah right oh oh man you know then I'm talking about me back home oh the the tribe is bad the tribal council is bad bad the state of Arizona's bad now the government's bad look what they're doing can't get their heads together Sacramento's bad California's bad the governor's bad everybody bad everything just bad bad bad bad right the world's bad Syria's bad everything just going bad you're always pointing out how Wicked the world is getting but you fail to see how powerful the church is getting at the same time she's rising up standing on the field oh she's a little flock but brother God's with her we may not got some kind of a $5 million TV program where everybody's watching us she might be a little flocked but brother God's with her and and she's going to Triumph just as certain as Christ rose from the dead she's going to Triumph I don't know about you but I want to be there I I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them huh to Triumph we are going to Tri amen God's Church shall never fail that's scripture that's scripture that is Jesus said the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against F right Upon This Rock what was the rock the revelation of the deity of Jesus Christ upon that rock of the Revelation I will build my church don't wonder why brother B said that Revelation means more to the believer than what we realize sometimes right he said because Revelation it brings faith it brings love it brings Assurance it lets us know who we are where we came from and where we're going amen now brother B says it showed that they would be against it the gates of hell would be against it I had one brother get up you know and he gets up and he talks about all the riv frates right 200,000,000 demons oh they're loose upon us we got it coming we got it coming that's all he would say brother something wrong with your testimony talking about how bad how we're going to get it we got it coming come on now that don't sound like an overcomer that don't sound like a conqueror I don't know about you talking about the devil's going to get you he's not going to get me cuz I'm built on a rock and Upon This Rock the church will be built and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against it that's what he says right so you can talk about how bad it's going to it's going to get but you know what at the same time the church is getting more powerful hallelujah oh the church is going to Triumph through the blood of Jesus Christ to the victory march amen the victory march you ever see the victory march done in church yeah used to see it done in cam all the time right victory march could you imagine one day we're all doing that and we just begin to march on up to Glory Hallelujah oh hallelujah oh I am positive he says I am positive of one thing that God will have a church without spot without wrinkle without blemish and I'm so happy about that oh prophet of God says I'm so happy about that right brother sister why could God say these kind of things a church a glorious Church Without spot without wrinkle you know why that is you know why brother B was inspired preach inv visible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ and in that message say you are The Virtuous glorious bride of Jesus Christ am you know why that was because God knew you and ordained you and covered you with the blood brother when the token is applied and God doesn't see you he looks through the red blood he doesn't see those sins he only sees his children his seeds of God that are there that he knows that they'll come to that age of maturity and then one day we'll be caught up with the rest of them to meet the Lord in the air is that right oh brother Hallelujah that that you know that that ought to make us jump shout and dance about Amen Let me let me close with a couple more all right just a couple more I'm positive sure of this this morning that if men and women could only get in the position where their soul and their thinking and their attitudes would be perfect in the sight of God it would be one of the most powerful churches that ever existed sir the powerful churches how how he says it right here he said only if we can get our in our position placed positionally in the body of Christ and that we can have our soul and our thinking and our attitudes there it is our attitudes our attitude we have to have the right attitude right brother B said the right mental attitude toward any promise of God will bring it to pass we must have the right attitude we going to have the right thinking the right attit to we would be perfect in the sight of God we would be one of the most powerful churches that ever existed amen and it won't be some kind of a make belief put on artificial emotional workup it'll be a genuine experience a genuine outpouring of the sweetness of the oil of gladness Hallelujah the precious oil of the Holy ghosts brother there there there might be a lot of counterfeits yes but you know what there is also a genuine the only reason why there is a fake is because there is a genuine somewhere right now now now there's a there's a there's a there's a counterfeit $100 bill right there is there's out they're out they're out here and that's why every store you go to they got those little markers right if you give them a $100 bill they got to check it they got to hold it up to the light you know because they don't trust you they don't they don't trust you you're probably making fake money somewhere huh so they you give them a 20 you give them a 50 you give them 100 they got to mark it they got to test it why because there's a fake out there right but just because there's a fake doesn't make him afraid of the real thing that right are you understand what I'm saying it it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't make him afraid of the real thing so they'll accept it right they just got to check it first check it first that right oh brother there might be impersonation but don't let that distract you from the real true genuine that God has available to the bride of Jesus Christ shall be the most powerful church that ever existed and that's what God desires from us tonight do you believe that so do I amen God intended us to be this powerful church not not powerless powerful amen not being pushed over run over by the devil but to to to live as a conqueror more than a conqueror through Jesus Christ which is our strength amen God bless you let the musicians come tonight let us all stand I'm not done but I have to quit anyhow and uh we'll pick it up again the Lord willing tomorrow night amen oh thank you Jesus Oh don't you just love him all this the wonderful thing about it church is all this has nothing to do with me or you or what we can do or what we can't do right it's all all what he has already done for us now will you just accept it tonight stop fighting it stop pushing it off stop running from it just surrender surrender to it accept it a pardon is not a pardon unless you'll accept it as a pardon but I oh brother sister if we can only let go tonight and let God have his way we just surrender to the sweetness of Jesus Christ and experience the real reality of a loving merciful god the way he did for me Theon night I gave my heart to the Lord and I felt the reality of Jesus brother he's the same yesterday today and forever you believe that tonight there's not nothing that he can handle there's not one sin that's too big his blood cannot Wash It Away Hallelujah there's not one of your loved ones tonight that's too far gone he can't reach out to where they're at tonight we serve an omnipresent God we serve a god who is omn presentent we serve a God who can be right here and there at the same time one day a woman came running to Jesus a gentile woman she said Lord my daughter is vexed with a devil I need your help Jesus didn't even answer just kept right on walking the disciples got annoyed they said Lord send her away she cries after us he just kept walking and uh and she kept crying she kept begging asking Jesus said it's not meant to take the children's bread and cast it to a dog called her a dog you would think she' have left the church you would think she'd have walked out slammed the door throw a rock in the pastor's car but she didn't do that she said yes Lord I am a dog but even dogs eat of the crumbs from the master's table and Lord if I could only get a crumb tonight if I could just get a crumb I just get a little taste praise God I didn't read it to you but I have it right here I I didn't read it tonight but brother Brandon says God doesn't have any weak Parts there's no weak Parts in God he is all together strong he says if you only have a little speckle of God in you you have power to create a world and go out and live on it a speckle a speckle maybe you feel so far maybe you feel separated from God you know those feelings come around us human beings we we feel we feel like failures we feel like we've done sin away our day of Grace and that Old Devil he don't make it no better because he comes along and when he comes along he says yeah you messed up yeah you failed yeah and he just pushes and plugs at you right that's what that Old Devil does you see but remember how Jesus said he is a liar and a father of it right he's a liar and he's a father of Lies there's not one reason we have to believe anything that the devil says to us I started to say just a minute ago that he cannot possess you you are God's Property tonight he has no rights on you as a son as a daughter of God no rights on God's properly brother bradam says he's nothing but a squatter he's nothing but a freeloader he's nothing but a bluff call his bluff tonight the spirit of God is here exposing the Devil he's exposing him because when he's exposed he is weakened Hallelujah that's why the devil hates Revelation that's why he's fighting you even now but don't you let him have his way you're a conqueror start living like one you are a child of God you're a son and a daughter don't let the devil push you around Hallelujah don't let him push you around no longer he has no rights on you he can't possess you he can't he can't do it he fights he tries but he has no way to possess you so you know what he does instead he tries to put oppression on you he tries to squeeze the life of God out of you he tries to squeeze it out but he has no right oh he puts that oppression he puts that discouragement he puts those failures those sins those mistakes what you need to do tonight is apply the blood just apply the blood apply the blood of Jesus apply god father simple faith
