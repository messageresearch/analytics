amen forget about the man you know that's just the brothers but brother we gotta look unto Jesus they mean us Look Away to Jesus amen amen Look Away to Jesus is it the revelation of a man on the boat no he said it's a revelation Jesus amen amen it's not the revelation of the man of the pulpits it's a revelation of Jesus Christ that when we look at these things in such detail and and when they tell you as Isaiah because when Isaiah they were crying out amen what does he say did he say with plainly covered his face with 20 covered his feet with Twain he could fly for those Koreans to another it

is used to influence how they look how they wear their pants they can't even breathe and all these other things but you begin to see the ones that call under that influence yeah it's religious foreign conscience or unconscious amen questions and answers what's his questions because I've often said I believe in the church here and there's a role right here and and here lives a mortal being I hear it yet even says and each one here had this great congratulations of Blackness and darkness and they are either influenced yes without having an influence questions and answers he says you cannot be a mortal being because hypocritical uh your Celestial body is down here or how much do you think of it it's up there he says because the fruit of that you bear people prove where you come from if you're influenced his influence so you are here what you are somewhere else your life will be like you live here it's like it's reflecting what your inheritance is located that they're not going okay why
