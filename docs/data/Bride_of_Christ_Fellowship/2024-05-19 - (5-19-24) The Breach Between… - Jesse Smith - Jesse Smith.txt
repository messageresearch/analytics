TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and I heard recognizing your day serpent seed and perfect Faith the breach and the message of Grace and Lord I Thank thee you know that song brother William do you know that song okay so uh I preach through recognizing your day serpent seed perfect faith we preached on Wednesday night so today I want to look at the breach by God's grace the breach between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals so Revelation 5 verse one Hallelujah Revelation 5 vers one brother Brandon reads 1 through 7 uh when he preaches this so I think uh I'll read 1 through four and then we can all read verse five by God's grace verse 5 is of course um where John gets some encouraging words Hallelujah Revelation 5 verse1 and I saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside seal with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor on Earth nor under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon couldn't even look at the book and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and read the book neither to look thereon let's read verse five ready 1 two three and one of the elders saith unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah and the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof now I'll just keep reading a little bit and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes brother Ram says those seven horns are the seven Church ages brother Ram said it's the church who protects the gospel or defends the Gospel of Jesus Christ as a horn is a defense for an animal so the seven horns are the seven Church ages so Church see what we are in the eyes of God we're a horn Hallelujah we've got power Hallelujah the church is power when God leads us to the power Hallelujah brother man tells us the seven eyes of course are the seven spirits uh which run upon the face of the whole earth he even says there are seven seers in one place he calls them those are the seven Church age Messengers Hallelujah and uh now the the scripture goes on to say which are the seven spirits of God sent forth in all the Earth verse 7 and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated praise God well by God's grace this should be a happy sermon today Hallelujah you know summer more cutting and uh you know call bringing us to repentance and so forth and you as I told you you know I I often preach a lot of sanctification messages and how many know we need him by God's grace how many know in this leoan church age you know we need sanctification of the Holy Spirit constantly uh by the grace of the Lord but this should be a happy joyful message you know brother brandom I've listen to this numerous times now brother brandom says this is the most Sublime thing in the scripture did you know that I just read you the most we read together the most Sublime thing in the scripture praise God so of course Sublime means like a perfect like a state of just wonderful uh ecstasy you know blessing Paradise almost this is the most beautiful portion of scripture brother R say in the whole entire Bible and that's no doubt why the author put that song in there uh the breach and the message of Grace Lord I Thank you that I get to hear your word hallelujah and I can say you know being raised in denomination that's true this is the most suim place Hallelujah because we didn't know anything about the seven seal book this is all connected of course to the Seven Seals by the grace of the Lord hallelujah uh now uh this is a over 2hour and uh 36 minute sermon from brother Brandon preaches this um this is the second sermon of that week of of of the Seven Seals you know in the morning brother R preached God hiding himself in Simplicity that was the morning service this was the Sunday evening service on the week of preaching the Seven Seals of course Monday night would have been the first seal there in March of 1963 and the word breach uh means a gap now of course it means numerous other things too like you can breach a contract it means to break a contract and just it was just a strange choice of words here uh maybe to our understanding you know because God's not breaking anything in Revelation 4 and 5 uh but brother ram calls you know Revelation 4 and 5 the breach between the church ages Revelation 2 and 3 and the Seven Seals Revelation 6 and then Revelation 8 by God's grace he calls it a breach so this is a gap there's a gap between the church ages and the Seven Seals Hallelujah and brother baham starts I like to read his opening prayer as before he takes his text he said now just before we approach the book let's talk to him he says with our head bows Lord Jesus we are altogether insufficient I love I love the humility of this prayer and we should feel that way every service hallelujah we're insufficient we need God to come we would not try by no means to approach this sacred book in this most holy hour which Souls hang in the destination of time without asking Lord that the only one that can reveal the book that he came forward now blessing the feeble efforts of thy servants bless the word as it goes forth May It Go in the power of the spirit and may the spiritual ground of those who are hungry and thirsting to know righteousness and to know the will of God may it fall in there and bring forth of its kind Hallelujah Grant it Lord all praise shall be thine May the hungry and the Thirsty find food and drink tonight from the word we ask it in Jesus name of whom the Revelation is of Amen then he says now we're going to Revelation 5 this is not the Seven Seals it's the breach between the church ages and the Seven Seals he says now he said now in in the fourth chapter of Revelation he said it kind of reveals something that would take place after the church is going up he said that the church goes up on the third chapter of Revelation and does not return unto the ninth chapter of Revelation therefore the church misses the tribulation so I'll just pause there for a moment you know uh brother Ram taught that brother Bram taught that the church goes up in Revelation 41 so let's read that now I might have a I have a different idea on this you know as far as uh certain the order of events uh there's numerous scriptures I've got videos on it uh brother Ram sometimes thought that the book of re Revelation went chronologically and of course I believe he grew in Revelation and by the end he knew that was not exactly right uh the church wouldn't go through uh or the sorry the Revelation doesn't go through chronological order uh it's easy to see that uh you know you can look at uh Revelation chap 10 right Revelation 10:7 is brother am's Ministry how many believe that by God's grace he finishes the mystery of God well that happens that happens there in Revelation 10 but if the Rapture is revelation 4 this is out of order brother Williams smiled because he's heard the word for all these decades see that's why I always look at him for confirmation is that right brother does that sound right with everything you've heard all these years so it's something brother Ram grew in he got that actually from Lin I have Lin's book my wife got it from my birthday a couple years ago and I I love that book I love the illustrations he does brother brand pulled numerous thoughts from Lin that were very helpful for the ministry but in that case you know Lin had it wrong he said the Book of Revelation was chronological now what I believe is revelation 4 is a type of the Bride going up after the leodan church age it's a type but it's not a literal not literal happening because if you if you place Revelation if you place the rapture Revelation 4:1 well then brother bram's Ministry hasn't even happened yet okay so I hope you're listening on spiritual levels no wonder we sing that song listen closely today Hallelujah Revelation 4 vers1 after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne so here in Revelation 4:1 John is caught up up to the throne of God and so that's why it's a type of the Rapture because we go from Earth Hallelujah to the meeting in the air and then from that that place we go to the marriage supper of the Lamb Hallelujah in the highest Dimension it have to be the seventh Dimension praise God so we can see how this is a type of the Rapture but uh I I personally you know growing in understanding of brother Ram's Ministry I I don't believe it's the literal Rapture of the church Hallelujah so uh it's a beautiful portion of scripture but what what what is true as brother Ram taught us um you know we there's C there's a certain section in the Book of Revelation where we don't hear anything about the church right and so that proves the church misses the tribulation I've had a man uh reach out to me these last few weeks on Tex and boy is he ferocious and aggressive trying to tell me the Rapture is uh after the tribulation boy he's ferocious but uh I said brother I said uh you know if you look at the tribulation text the there's no mention of the church right so I'm just flipping over here uh in Revelation chapter 7 with 144,000 where you know uh the 144,000 have to be H sealed by the Holy Ghost before the Earth gets hurt by the plagues and the vials and so forth Hallelujah and then in Revelation chapter 8 after the Seven Seals open in the reality form brother Bram tells us he said uh then the trumpets are blown the the first four trumpets are blown in Revelation 8 there's no mention of the church in Revelation 9 you have the fifth trumpet and the sixth trumpet there's no mention of the church Hallelujah so while the most awful judgments are coming upon the Earth there's no mention of the church right because she's already been raptured Hallelujah she's been taken out of Harm's Way by a snatch or a catching up Hallelujah of the church and then we get get to this uh proof where there's no chronological order right because Revelation 10 we see a mighty Angel come down he has the open book he reveals this to the seven Church age messenger and then there's a Ministry that must go forth to every Kindred tongue nation and people hallelujah so there we see there's still Ministry for the seven Church ages or the Gentiles but then Revelation 11 is the ministry to the Jews and of course this is during the time of the tribulation period because it's three and A2 years the Bible tells us there in Revelation 11 and Revelation 12 now the Beast out of the earth uh and anyone who knows the message in Revelation 13 the Beast out of the sea in Revelation 13 1-10 brother random said is papal Rome turning into papal Rome from five about 500 AD so you have that so that's not in the right order right as far as chronological and then if you know your bible really well and the message Revelation 13 the Beast out of the earth is the United States verses 11 to 18 in Revelation 13 so that wouldn't be in the right order if this is a chronological book Hallelujah then chapter 14 the 144,000 get sealed so that ties in closely with Revelation chapter 7 the 144,000 being sealed and Revelation 15 of course is the seven vials these are the last plagues poured out upon the Earth and thank God the bride won't be here hallelujah God promised us a a a uh uh a an escape from the wrath of God hallelujah God promised us to escape the wrath of God in 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 and then we know uh chapter 16 of course is the seven vows poured out there and then 17 of course is the mystery Babylon Hallelujah 18 is Mystery Babylon and 19 we get back now to the marriage supper of the Lamb Hallelujah so we see how it cannot be chronological praise God it's just it's it's just it's just not right but God gives us Grace and God gives us Mercy it reminds me of Joel chapter 2 I don't know if we read that you read that recently brother William but even Joel chapter 1 and Joel CH chapter 2 have events that are out of order Joel chap Joel chapter 1 uh talks about when Jesus comes back to the Jews 144,000 that's Joel chapter 1 and the beginning of Joel chapter 2 it's the mighty Army right uh Jesus comes down to Mount Zion and then Joel chapter 2 the beginning uh I'm sorry the Joel chapter 2 the middle is the day of Pentecost which Peter quotes uh I'm sorry that's the middle I'm sorry the end of Joel chapter 2 is the day of Pentecost the middle of Joel chapter 2 brother Bram tells us is rapturing Faith Joel 223 to 26 I'll restore all the years the cankerworm has eaten Hallelujah so even Joel 1 and two is completely out of order it's just it's God's hiding it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and revealing it unto babe such as we learn Hallelujah so we can see it plainly amen I didn't wasn't really in my notes but I just thought I'd lay that in there by God's grace my love what brother R says next the church misses the tribulation I know that's contrary to pretty near every teacher I talked to and church that's how we are we are contrary to every person almost that goes to other churches but look at brother man's attitude I love this he says and I don't mean to be disagreeable Hallelujah we don't mean to be disagreeable on these things I mean to be your brother and that's what I've tried to be right you've tried to be that you've tried to be a brother or a sister in Christ to people that we differ with with he said but I must teach it just as I can see it if I don't if I can't put it together you see now whether the church goes up before the tribulation or after the tribulation I want to go up with it that's the main thing praise God so I love brother raam's humility here and just being a Christian you know I want to be a brother to all these churches Hallelujah that that differ with us but the main thing is I want to go up in the Rapture Hallelujah now brother B reads uh as I said Revelation 5 1-7 here I'm get my text in and then immediately after reading this he goes to Revelation 10 Hallelujah a few months ago brother I preach on the seven Thunders as a kind of review he goes right to Revelation chapter 10 and this is Brother Man's first statement he says this seven sealed book is revealed at the time of the seven thunders of Revelation 10 10 if you're marking it down so thank God we marked it down Hallelujah we took down his quotes we searched the scriptures Hallelujah and of course I could be wrong in this but I believe when brother R preached each of the Seven Seals that was each seal was a thunder each Thunder was a voice of God speaking to us the true revelation of the Seven Seals and there's my quote that backs me up Hallelujah that's just one of them I think I showed you what I do I think I did 13 or 14 I can't remember now the number it's on the videos I put it out there but brother Adam says it he says notice the book is revealed at the time of the seven Thunders if you're marking it down and then he reads about the mighty Angel Revelation 10 he said if you notice that's Christ he said because he has the same attributes as Revelation chapter 1 Hallelujah now if I'm going to get anywhere I'm I just can't go through I just can't hit all these things brother man said you could spend a uh U you could spend a sermon on each one of these thoughts so there's no way I can get through this whole sermon uh just you just can't cover it but uh I'm just reading these because it supports what I've taught I've tried to wrly divide the word of God all these 18 years of ministry by God's grace he said brother said it's wrote mysterious because no man nowhere knows it God Alone Jesus Christ it's a mysterious book it's a book of redemption we'll get into that in a little while and we now we know that this book of redemption will not be thoroughly understood isn't that the truth my goodness people just they don't thoroughly understand it it's it's a mystery to them it's been probed at through six Church ages but at the end when the seventh angel begins to sound his mystery he winds up all the Loose Ends that these fellows probed at and the Mysteries come down from God as the word of God and reveals the entire revelation of God and then the godhead and everything else is settled all the Mysteries serpent seed whatever more is is to reveal hallelujah amen oh I'm glad today that the Mysteries are settled in our hearts Hallelujah they've been settled for a long time that's why I started the YouTube channel in 2013 you know 2012 was a year that um the accusers of brother brandom really stepped out publicly and made it known and so in that year I was so bombarded you know with all these accusations and and lies and uh uh reviling and so forth and slander I said I just want to make a YouTube channel and I want to prove to everybody that what we believe is the Bible truth I'm not believing the Bible said I'm not believing false uh fa fairy tales and things I'm not saying the exact King James word but we're not given under we're not given under fables we're not given under wives tales we we've been given thus sayith the Lord hallelujah we've been given the word of God hallelujah the uh the the the ministry of Paul has been restored to us the message of Paul has been restored to the church hallelujah amen so brother R says all these things uh was brought down to the seventh angel and brother R said now you see I'm just not making that up how many appreciate preachers that don't make things up brother I'm not making that up this is thus sayith the Lord he says I'll read it to you out of the book it's the sounding of the seventh Angel's message the mystery of God should be finished that's been declared by his holy prophets that's the prophets who's wrote the word at the sounding of the seventh Church age at the last Church age all the Loose Ends that through these Church ages has been probed at will be wound up together amen hallelujah so that's what we see now just so you're you're aware in Revelation five the lamb comes and takes the book in Revelation 6 the lamb breaks the six of the seals Hallelujah and then in Revelation 8 he breaks the seventh seal and then in Revelation 10 an angel comes down and a book is open Hallelujah and then it says all the mysteries of God are finished hallelujah praise God Amen so we can see how this book in heaven is a book of redemption and it's got to be broken by the lamb and then it's got to be brought to Earth and then it's got to be taken to the entire Earth Hallelujah and think church that think that you are one of the privileged ones that gets to feed on the open book hallelujah oh my Hallelujah you could be sitting in a Catholic church or 7day Adventist Church or Christian Missionary Alliance or Delta assembly of or Assembly of God Church that's my home church house raon uh you could be sitting in these churches this morning but God allowed you to sit and hear the open book The revelation of the Seven Seals hallelujah amen now I want you to uh listen to this quote brother B says and when the seals are broke and the Mysteries revealed down comes the angel the messenger Christ that's the mighty angel in Revelation 10 and he sets his foot upon the land and upon the sea with a rainbow over his head a covenant now remember this seventh angel is on the earth at the time of this coming Hallelujah did you catch that the seventh angel so brother random is on the earth at the time of Jesus coming down as a mighty Angel Hallelujah all right so now this is why some people and I want to this might this might uh Lydia told me stor this might play into Lydia's story that she told me here this is why some uh message people say the raptures already happened because of this quote because the mighty Angel comes down okay and so so in in a lot in some message churches Minds The Mighty angel came down revealed the revelation of brother brandham and now the mighty Angel's here here and so we the raptures already happen is what they say now that's not true right what happened was Christ came down glory in a son of man Ministry Hallelujah in brother man's Ministry to give the sign of the Messiah Hallelujah to discern the thoughts and intents of of these people's hearts Hallelujah that and and that that's why all these people even the his historical writers of uh of the 1940s 50s 60s that's why all these writers about the dictionaries of the Pentecostal churches they all can point back to brother brandom and say it all started with him because he had a gift of God that it remains unmatched nobody can match the gift of God and that's because this this Mighty angel came down and visited brother brandom hallelujah it's it's Christ amen Christ came down and was in brother's Ministry hallelujah hallelujah but see they'll take this quote and they'll say see the rapture's already happened the Bible said that destroys the faith of many and it's a canker when you say the resurrection's happened already or the raptures happened already the Bible said it causes a canker it destroys people's Faith see because now they're not looking for anything now they don't live as close to God as if they would if they felt he was coming church I say like this he's coming like a thief in the night we need to be ready hallelujah amen every other generation of Christians live their lives like he was coming in their life and the Bible said don't let anybody deceive you telling you he already came already he's coming like a thief in the night he's coming at the right time and we must be faithful and as a minister I must give the people the meat in due season Hallelujah that's what Jesus Commissioned I must feed you the meat in due season now how can I feed you unless God's feeding me hallelujah praise God that's why I love feeding on the word of God because what God shows me it's a proved unto God I can give it out to you hallelujah amen and if you receive it it'll bless you like it blesses me Hallelujah and of course that not just me that's all of the fivefold ministry coming in here whatever God shows them they bring it to us we receive it we feed on it and it blesses our soul it keeps us strong it gives us spiritual nourishment Hallelujah blessed are they which hunger and thirst after righteousness they shall be filled but I tell you the deception of today is church that we got to be bereans and if we don't do Berean work we're not going to stay on fire for God so go to acts 1711 just to remind you this ties in with the King and Priests unto God this struck me this week I think I was studying yesterday it kind of struck me like that's right you have got to study the word every day you've got to search the scriptures every day that's what Jesus told the Pharisees he said I just read this morning search you the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me Hallelujah right but if we're not careful we just let all the preachers do the studying for us but that's not how it was in the early church the bans were more noble than those in thessalonica in that they received the word of God with all Readiness of mind and search the scriptures daily whether these things were so see every day we got to search the scriptures don't just take my word for you go find it in fact I think it's in the previous sermon God hiding himself in Simplicity where brother Ram says uh you go listen this and listen to this tape in the quietness of your own home and see what God will reveal to you he wasn't saying well I'm the only one that can get Revelation he said you go study you go have some time with God and God will reveal something to you hallelujah amen amen and church if we're a book of Acts church this is what the book of Acts Church did right amen they search the scriptures every day Hallelujah see it's just plain and this is why people get deceived and they'll just take quotes instead of scriptures and so forth you know they'll what I mean is they'll Mis they'll Mis construe quotes they'll misunderstand quotes like this one remember the seventh Angels on the earth at the time of his coming so somebody told Lydia recently uh Lydia just forgive me if I get this wrong but the story was was Jesus isn't coming Jesus is here that's what they told Lydia Lydia was talking about the Rapture you'd be surprised the churches that teach this I'll tell you in the privateness of our fellowship on Sunday nights I'll tell you then if you want to know just you can have your your W your guard up always have your guard up with some of these message people some of them not all of them some of them but that's just a misunderstanding so Christ came down in Revelation 10 in brother's Ministry helps him finish the mystery of God then of course Christ goes back up but the holy ghost is still here I'm not the son of man you're not the son of man but the comforter is here the Holy Ghost is here amen Jesus said if I go away the comforter will come hallelujah amen and even Jesus came to brother Ram in the form of the comforter because it wasn't jesus' physical body it was the Holy Spirit praise God are you with me that's a little deeper there by God's grace if you can catch that it wasn't the Corporal body it was the Holy Spirit but it was the spirit of Jesus Hallelujah of course which is the Holy Spirit but it was in a special way where he had the gift to see to see visions and to prophesy and to foretell things in the name of the Lord hallelujah now here's one just to help out Lydia maybe we can maybe I can share this with your friend wink wink uh the last sermon brother B preached was leadership and he said we've turned a corner we're looking towards heaven not towards a building or something like that watching for his watching for the coming the cap on the pyramid as we would say he's coming back the church M Church Must Be resurrected soon and we must get ready Hallelujah so there lyia we can say brother Ram also said this well brother R said this brother Ram also said this hallelujah amen so I thought that might be a blessing there but that this is why uh this is why people get confused they don't search the scriptures there still has to be a literal Corporal body coming of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and really church I found this if somebody's really got the spirit of Christ they're humble enough to be corrected if they're wrong on something they won't fly off the handle and be aggressive towards you if they've got the spirit of Christ they're willing to Humble themselves and repent Hallelujah that's right now I spent a little bit of time on that now the next section brother BR after laboring there in Revelation 10 he goes to the idea of the book of redemption through a kinsman redeemer Hallelujah now we can see it's a book of redemption Casa would you pull up uh Revelation 59 Revelation 59 and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and Hast what redeemed everybody say redeemed redeem that means to purchase and buy back as your own that's what Redemption means Hallelujah I purchased it and bought it back I think I read it a few months ago when I was preaching on the book of Romans redeemed it means to take out of the pawn shop or the slave market in would in those days it would have been a slave market to buy out of the slave market so if someone bought a slave which would be awful Wicked it's a wicked thing God in the Old Testament God said it was worthy of death but if someone like in the case of Hosea amen with his wife Hallelujah which represented Israel and God Amen God by God bought Israel back with the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah he redeemed her she was lost but she became his possession by a purchase he purchased her back and he could say I paid the price She's Mine Hallelujah she's redeemed amen the price has been paid amen she doesn't belong to anybody else She's Mine Hallelujah amen and that's what Christ did to us that's what Christ did to you Hallelujah you're his you're purchased you're bought nobody can take you out of his hands amen the price has already been paid you've already we've got God's receipt it's the resurrection hallelujah amen I feel like it's Easter time amen we've already got God's receipt it's the resurrection that Jesus Christ is alive and his spirit is here today in the church hallelujah amen it's a book of redemption this book that no man could even look at think about that couldn't even look at it what's so important to you that you wouldn't even let somebody look at it unless they had they were in the right conditions and God's like no one's even looking at this book except one only one can look at this book maybe I'll preach on Wednesday but brother said all the celebrity in heaven was there brother amen which is this is interesting thought but he said Elijah was standing there brother man said Moses was standing there all the celebrities in heaven were standing there and God said nobody can even look at it and that's why John wept brother R said John didn't just weep because he was unworthy brother said he he wept for more than that he wept because the whole creation was lost unless somebody was worthy to come and take this book of redemption Hallelujah in other words we'd be slave M we'd be slave to sin we'd have no hope we'd still be in the slave market if somebody doesn't come and take this book Hallelujah we'd have no future we be lost and go to hell unless somebody comes and prevails and takes the book of God hallelujah oh my and we're redeemed we're purchased what out of every blood so I don't care what blood you are I don't care what nation you come from Jesus purchased all of them Hallelujah heyen every Kindred tongue people and Nation Hallelujah every I love that word every every single one he paid the price for All Nations Hallelujah so the gospel is for every nation it's for every person Hallelujah the Bible also said in Galatians 3:13 Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law so just some more verses about being redeemed we're redeemed from the curse of Law and now there's a book of redemption that's so important uh it was so important to John it was so important to all of us uh God of course also foretold the Redemption of Israel in Psalm 13624 and has redeemed us from our enemies for his mercy endureth forever and of course that was natural Redemption right as as Moses and David and different ones down through the the oldest they would have physical battles of natural Wars and they would rejoice and say God redeemed us right God delivered us God brought us out of Egypt God brought us out of bondage amen God brought us out of spiritual Egypt Hallelujah we've been baptized under Moses amen we've been baptized under Paul's gospel Hallelujah in our spiritual way Hallelujah and so we can see all throughout the Bible it's a book of redemption Nehemiah even said in in Nehemiah 5:8 and I said unto them we we after our ability have redeemed our Brethren the Jews which were sold unto the Heathen and will ye even sell your brethren or shall they be sold unto us then they held their peace and found nothing to answer so God had a way for even Israelites to redeem one another right if a brother man would say if a family got in in bad times and they made some bad Investments or there was a famine the family might have to sell themselves to be slaves or I'm sorry not slaves indentured servants they might have to sell themselves but then every seven years there' be a a there' be the seven-year release and then every 50 years it was a year Jubilee all properties go back to the original owners praise God God always had a way of redemption Hallelujah if something been lost God always had a way to get it back amen didn't cam preach on that Hallelujah the law of restoration last time that's right it's a law God always has a way to bring back back what's been taken Hallelujah now brother raham goes in this deep and long he spends most of his time on this idea of the kinsman redeemer I'm just going to read this is Brother R's uh summary of all these Bible verses I'm going to read in just a moment get ready okaya he said now the forfeited title deed is now in the hands of the original owner almighty God that's quite a statement so this book there Revelation five was a title deed right a title deed is you own something right we have we have the title to our cars thank God we finally got the title to our cars H only takes how long you know if you buy a used one you can have it right away he said the title deed is to the Earth and eternal life when Adam forfeited it so what was that brother Jesse that was Genesis 1:26 and 28 God gave Dominion to Adam and Eve that means they had control they had rule over the Earth and they had eternal life amen they had the title deed they had ownership over the Earth but we we know what happened Adam and Eve sinned and the Bible said pull up second Peter 2:19 this is a very familiar verse uh well I should say very familiar but it's very helpful for this this teaching Adam had eternal life okay for of whom a man is overcome of the same as he brought into bondage Adam purposely sinned Eve was deceived into it but Adam purposely plunged the whole human race into sin and because he was overcome before he because he purposely gave into sin now the whole humanity is under the corruption of sin we're under the bondage to sin Church you know that if you can make it through a whole day without sinning it's about time to shout and praise God and have Revival Hallelujah of course you'd be having Revival if you didn't sin all day you know you made it through a day there's not many mind battles you like Hallelujah I'm walking on clouds amen amen or I'm really sitting Heavenly places Hallelujah because we because we know what it's like almost every day we're under bondage how can I get out of this where when can this end why does it have to be like this I don't lie I don't want any of this but yet it happens right Adam sold us under that but at first Adam had dominion and he had eternal life in other words he had the he had the rights to the Earth he had control of the Earth with eternal life but then he sold it out and brother R said then that book that title deed to the Earth and Dominion went back to God but then some of you know God let Satan become God of this world 2 Corinthians 4:4 let's read that by God's grace and that just means a judge or ruler doesn't mean Satan's a God right there's only one God God we need to read Isaiah sometime and God says I don't see any other God beside me I'm the only one I made Heaven and Earth I was before the earth I was before all things I order the number of days I I'm Ancient of Days hallelujah praise God there's no one beside me if there is I don't know them Hallelujah he's being factious in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not so when Adam lost his Dominion Satan took part of that Dominion right because he's got he's got influence now over them with sin he can tempt them and deceive them into sin so he's like a a ruler over the sin nature oh but we but he don't have to rule over us hallelujah because God gave us a different nature there it is amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and that could only happen because Jesus was a new creation hallelujah amen he came a new creation and he lived such a life that when he died he raised and then he sent his life back upon the church amen he sent his Spirit deeper into the church not just the flesh not just the mind but into their very Soul Hallelujah so we can see this now brother Ram said but the whole title deed of it the ownership of it didn't go to Satan the ownership went back to God the book I don't know if there's a book on the earth or not I'm sure preachers have dramatized it and it'd be okay drama you know that'd be a fine drama to me it wouldn't father me because Adam did have dominion we can see it by the scripture but brother maram said when uh when God created Jesus the body to dwell in he was the fullness of the godhead bodily that's right Hallelujah and brother Adam said he was a son back in his rightful position like Adam was that's why when the storms come up Jesus could just talk to the storms amen hallelujah peace be still Hallelujah brother said that's what Adam and Eve originally had but Jesus now that he comes not now that he comes on the scene he has the authority and I just read this morning Jesus said I only do what the father shows me oh church if we could just do that amen if we could learn to do that just do what God tells us to do not what we want to do he says as I see I do it as I hear I judge as I hear I teach so in other words Jesus only relied on the father for every action that he ever did God help us to do that hallelujah oh so true so beautiful Hallelujah but there was a few things even though he was a full Son of God we'd say there's a few things he still had to conquer he had to possess every gate amen he had to possess every one of the enemy's Gates he had to possess Temptation he had to uh possess sickness and disease hallelujah praise God Amen depression he battled depression in the Garden of Eden he had to possess the Gate of anger sinful anger by not sinning when he was angry Hallelujah and brother R said he possessed every gate he conquered the sin of anger he conquered the sin of Temptation he conquered every single gate Hallelujah and the last gate brother amen he had to C conquer was death hallelujah oh but he went down to Hell and he conquered and took the keys of death and hell and then he said I live and I'm I'm alive forever more Hallelujah now I've got the keys of death hallelujah amen so straight Satan is stripped of his keys right you've heard preachers say it you know it's true Satan don't even have the keys of his own house he's the house of Hell he's the house of death and he don't have the keys Jesus has the keys Hallelujah he's he's got Dominion praise God he's a he's the true Son of God hallelujah the only begotten son of the Son of God hallelujah oh my so we can see what brother manam is trying to bring it to us he said when Adam forfeited it then Satan's dirty hands could not take it so it went back to the original owner God himself that dominion and eternal life couldn't go to Satan because he'd already sinned he can't have eternal life it's got to go back to God who gave it that's what that book represents eternal life and Dominion hallelujah praise God the full rights as a son or daughter of God Amen it's a book of brother Ram tells us amen all your rights are in that book hallelujah amen he says now there he sits on the throne with the book in his hand the title deed brother claps his hands twice oh that makes me feel religious the title deed to eternal life the abstract title deed to eternal life when Adam forfeited it for wisdom not not God's wisdom but sinful wisdom instead of faith it went back to the hands of the owner almighty God what a great thing he says he says what is it doing it's in the hands of God waiting for redemption's claims to claim Redemption he said he made a way of redemption he made a way back and someday the Redeemer is to take it back you see what we're getting at now we watch this fellow sitting upon the throne of course that's Jesus right all right waiting for redemptions claims its Redemption he says what is this book of redemption it's a title deed it's an abstract title deed what does abstract mean it means it searchs all the way back to its beginning Hallelujah so this book Hallelujah in heaven it has all the truths all the way back to the beginning amen amen that's right Hallelujah so it has all the rights that God gave to Adam and Eve at the beginning plus eternal life hallelujah it's got all that it goes all the way back to the beginning the position and the power of a son or daughter of God hallelujah oh my brother it's like that little drop of ink we preached this morning when the ink strikes the bleach it search all the way back to its original condition right goes back to its original uh molecules right he says and When sin has been confessed and fallen into the blood of Jesus Christ oh my it gives an abstract right straight back to the crater again you become a son or daughter of God he said an abstract title deed is held in the hands of all almighty God oh it's beautiful he said it's Redemption means all legal possession that was lost by Adam and Eve oh my we ought to do that he said what ought it do to a born again Christian so if Redemption brings back all the rights right what should it do to a born- again Christian Hallelujah it should make us enjoy and recognize the rights God has given to us like brother said it should make us live to our privileges how many enjoying those privileges Hallelujah I haven't got all of them brother Austin but I got a lot of privileges Hallelujah I've been enjoying them the last 20 some years by God's grace last 23 years amen I've enjoying the Privileges of being a Son of God a child of God hallelujah but I know there's more privileges for me hallelujah amen amen oh it's beautiful all that was lost he said it's a legal possession to that abstract deed title deed of eternal life that means you can possess everything that Adam and Eve lost of course but we have to balance that according to the will of God whatever God has for your life because remember 1 Corinthians 12 do all are all Apostles are you sisters going to say well I got all the rights I can be an apostle now you just broke the you just broke the title deed Hallelujah right or brothers say well I'm going to be a prophet I know I can be a prophet and you weren't even called to be a prophet you don't dream dreams you don't see Visions uh sorry you just just broke the title deed you don't have those rights so we got to understand with that understanding all the rights that God has for my life God wants me to possess amen he's going to bring me back to them Hallelujah that's what this book represents the title deed the eternal life uh Hallelujah it represents the Dominion that Christians have and it represents that Jesus is giving us a portion of that now he gives us a portion but remember we don't get the fullness of the adoption until we get a body change hallelujah amen that's right Hallelujah the body change amen that's when we get the fullness of this purchase possession Hallelujah am that's right no I'm really loud today I don't know why I'm so loud I guess I'm just stirred up by God's grace he said it's a legal possession it's the Eternal I'm sorry the title deed of eternal life it means you possess everything Adam and Eve lost sorry I'm reading that again what is it brother the possession of that deed that right or that decree sorry Adam could not meet the requirements of the Redemption after he found he lost it he'd sinned and he separated himself from God was on that side of the chasm so he could not redeem it he just couldn't do it because he needed Redemption himself so he could not do it so when a man falls to uh into bondage he can't redeem himself Glory think about your life you might have been in some addiction you might have been in some slavery to sin and you couldn't redeem yourself somebody had to redeem you hallelujah oh thank you Jesus amen for redeeming me Hallelujah and yeah I use brother Simon to do some of it too Hallelujah right Simon brought me the message Hallelujah but it was all Jesus amen Jesus sent Simon Hallelujah Jesus sent Cam and all the different ones that God placed in my life God sent different ones in your life Hallelujah but it was all Jesus Hallelujah bringing you back redeeming you back from what you lost hallelujah what Adam had lost and what you didn't even most of us didn't even realize he had those rights Hallelujah my goodness he said he Adam couldn't do it he needed someone to redeem himself he said but the law required a kinsman redeemer he said you want to mark that down he said Leviticus now other where's my scriptures here yes is Leviticus 25 we're not going to read all those but brother BR mentions it Leviticus 25 because I want to at least get to a certain spot before we have to close here by God's grace Hallelujah brother B says we won't have time to thoroughly search this because you know each text would take a night see now I love what he says next let's get in this kinsman redeemer and we'll finish with this thought by God's grace next few minutes here he says but God's law received a substitute for The Sinner now what if God had not offered to take a substitute think about that what if God didn't accept substitute how could you ever have you ever had a maybe two days in a row where you felt like you could have earned God's love you would have failed you you you just would have failed right so brother R says there's no way back there was no way for him to get back he was gone he said but love constrained God to make a way back amen humans couldn't bring themselves back they couldn't muster up enough strength or courage or discipline to obey all the word of God and earn it back so God in His Grace law I love this God's a god of contrast God has law but he also has Grace amen he's got male and female heaven and earth right complete balance in the universe right Maly right he's got all these night and day he's got male and female he's got all these great balances amen so many times we just see law but that's true God has love but God also has Grace amen yes God has judgment but he also has Mercy amen and brother said I'm not hoping in the Judgment of God I'm trusting in the mercy of God Amen Hallelujah because that law and that judgment would judge me every time I'd have no hope I couldn't be brought back I needed God to have another way to bring me back to him Hallelujah hey thank God he did Hallelujah what if God didn't have a substitute but love constrained him to do that but the grace of God met this kinsman redeemer in the person of Jesus Christ law required it Grace met its requirements amen amen hallelujah in other words the law was demanding brother amen your soul is is uh you need to pay for the sins of of your soul right the law required it and a Amen to me we're like well we can't pay it we don't have any money I really don't have any money Hallelujah he's like I can't pay it but God had another way well there's another way somebody else can pay it for brother amen hallelujah oh I like that amen somebody who's got the money amen someone who's got the ability hallelujah hallelujah and then Jesus Christ comes himself as the Lamb of God Amen God had another way I know we couldn't for it we couldn't do it so God has a substitute and brings him in and Jesus drops the charges because he paid the charges amen he's both judge jury and attorney Hallelujah ah it's his legal system Hallelujah he's the one that set up kinsman redeemer he's the one that set up that somebody can bring you back amen you've been lost or you've gone astray but I've got a way to bring you back into the fold Hallelujah it's impossible for you to do it but I'll make a way where you can come back by a substitute Hallelujah Grace met the requirements of the law amen like that's why I like that song back to life because it's that second verse I just I shared it with you you know a few months ago when something says I'm not worthy I point to the price he paid what's the other line when something says I'm guilty I point to that empty grave oh Hallelujah that's my worthiness my worthiness is that somebody got me out I don't have any worthiness somebody stepped in and made a substitute and paid my fine Hallelujah that's my merits I have no merits the merits is that somebody paid my merits Hallelujah it wasn't me that's what I boasted that's what Paul said I don't boast in anything I boast in the cross of Jesus Christ my Lord oh thank God W Glory he said Oh Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound God's law required an innocent innocent substitute brother ramam said he was preaching on this so much he said when you get over to Heaven he says when you get to Heaven someday he said look over there beyond the river in a little cabin out towards the the woods he said and look out there and you'll hear somebody singing Amazing Grace amaz Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that Sav a rich like me I'll stop right there but brother said he said you look over you hear that and you say oh brother Brandon made it to Heaven hallelujah amen church that's what we'll be saying hallelujah I'll hear I'll hear This is Amazing Grace that's brother amen made it hallelujah thank God I hear Amazing Grace brother William madeen hallelujah thank God Amen we're all going to be singing about Amazing Grace God taking our place Grace meeting laws requirements amen what do you mean you can't make Heaven somebody already made the requirement so you could make it hallelujah what do you mean you can't get to heaven the price has already been paid and You' already been purchased it's already been bought you've got God's receipt hallelujah what do you mean it's already it's already a done deal hallelujah amen it's already finished it is finished Hallelujah it's finished the transaction's already taking place oh my we ought to be happy today Hallelujah God's grace met God's law requirement amen hallelujah I'm going to save some of this for Wednesday it's already 11 I want to be done 11:30 now that's a shocker but I want to be done 11:30 hold on to your chairs there when hold on God's grace you might be shocked let me um let me look at the kinsman redeemer I'm going to try to finish up with this here by God's grace notice it required a kinsman redeemer and the kinsman redeemer must be born of the human race he says here that leaves us on a limb so all all Humanity has fallen in sin and God's law said a Kinsman someone near to Kin had to come and restore you and he said we're out on a limb who's worthy the Bible said nobody was worthy brother said Mary was standing there Elijah was standing there Moses Noah you name it he said all the celebrity of heaven and nobody was worthy Hallelujah he said but let me sound the trumpet to you the Virgin birth prod produce the product amen hallelujah praise God the Virgin birth produce your kinsman redeemer hallelujah oh so true amen so true I like that gospel trumpet don't you Hallelujah I've got no hope I've got no I got no hope for the future nothing all of a sudden the trumpet sounds a virgin Birth has Pro been provided for you and now you can go free Hallelujah you don't have to be a Slave you don't have to be in fear of death and Hell a virgin birth produced the product It produced a kinsman redeemer he's bought you back you are his property amen the Bible even says you are not your own you're bought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen you're not your own the Bible says let's read that I think that's First Corinthians uh three me pull it up there and the remaining fragments of my memory here by God's gra bought with the price you're not your maybe it's chapter six yeah I'm sorry 619 69 what know you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and ye are not your own I want you to say that out loud say I'm not my own ready I'm not my own that means you belong to somebody oh if there's somebody I belong to God let it be Jesus amen hallelujah let it be Jesus amen amen hallelujah I don't want to belong to Satan I don't want to belong to anybody else and these uh politicians down here I don't want to belong to them I want to belong to one person the Son of God hallelujah that's who I want to belong to and the Bible said we do not belong to anyone else we belong to Christ Jesus Hallelujah I'm not my own I belong to Christ now what we heard it recently uh did we hear that where was that we heard that oh that that I it might have been at bible Club but we sing that song I Am My beloveds and he is mine His Banner Over Me Is Love but in the real reality of it church we are really his property praise God because you didn't pay a price to buy Jesus right Jesus Paid the price of his blood Hallelujah he shed his blood to purchase you and I and so we are bought with the price verse 20 you're bought with the price therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are Gods notice it didn't say soul because if you're born again you already glorified God in your soul because your soul is filled with the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah so that means the battle to glorified God is going to be in our body and in our minds our spirit that's where we got to say every day Lord help this day was it May 19th help this day to glorify you Jesus help me to remember today that you bought me I belong to you and today I'm going to glorify you today in my thoughts in my body thank God you're in my soul hallelujah praise God hallelujah you are not your own you have been bought with the price you've been bought by kinsman redeemer church amen hallelujah it's a beautiful example now I want to read uh what E's Bible dictionary says about the kinsman redeemer it means to redeem the kinsman redeemer was the nearest male blood relation alive okay so in the case of Ruth as we'll look at here her husband died so there was a nearer blood relation than even Boaz Boaz wasn't the nearest one there was another so her husband Rose uh husband who passed away must had a brother or some type of a relation that was nearer than Boaz right says certain important obligations devolved upon Him toward his next of kin so if you were a man and you had Brothers you know uh and sisters and so forth and they got in difficult situations if you were the closest one to them you could buy them out as long as you had the finances thank God Jesus had the finances Hallelujah he had the all the riches of Heaven amen he created the heavens and the Earth amen thank God by and it says if anyone from poverty was unable to redeem his inheritance it was the duty of the Kinsman to redeem it for him that's Leviticus put up oh she left okay that's fine Leviticus 25 25 we'll just read that one and 28 Leviticus 2025 Leviticus 2528 If thy brother be wax and poor and has sold away some of his possession and if any of his kin come to redeem it then shall he redeem that which his brother sold let's say he sold away today his car something well the nearest kin to you could come and buy it back I'll buy that back I'll redeem that back I'll pay the price for him since he can't afford it I'll pay it to bring it back now church this this is to magnify Jesus here now have to think about who can get me a whatever you know how can I get back that chair that I wanted I got to get back that couch that's not what we're talking about here we're talking about salvation Hallelujah Now read 28 2528 but if he be not able to restore it to him then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it under the year of Jubilee until the year Jubilee so that wait 50 years for this one and in the Jubilee it shall go out and he shall return unto his possession so he has to wait a long time but you're going to get it back eventually by God's grace hallelujah thank God thank God we'll get everything back eventually amen hallelujah I better not go there because that a little thought I don't want to go there also the Kinsman was required to redeem his relation Who Sold himself into slavery 254 48 Lydia 2548 and 49 28 25 4849 Glory so Church search can we see this is what Christ did for us Christ saw us we lost our possession we lost our rights right we lost our land we lost who we are but he said I can pay for it I can bring it back to them amen hallelujah that means God always knew I was going to be a pastor right and that's la land that I had lost long lost Hallelujah but God paid the price to bring me back to my possession and he brought me a gave me a wife my wife my family everything everything spiritual in my life God saw that and Jesus said I'm going to buy it back for him oh hallelujah amen it wasn't I I didn't do it it was God doing this Hallelujah each one of our lives whatever God's called us to be in in in in our in our our individual lives God has ordained that and he gives it back to us hallelujah Satan tries to steal those dreams away those hopes away but I'll tell you if that's a Bible dream if that's a promised dream of God you're going to get restored hallelujah amen oh my what it say 48 49 yes and after that he sold he may be redeemed again one of his Brethren May redeem him verse 49 either his uncle or his Uncle son may redeem him or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him or if he be able he may redeem himself of course we know that's impossible for us I don't what's the type in there brother that's a good question what is the type in there how can a man redeem himself he can't but notice even an uncle so if that's the closest male relative you have and you've lost some possession even your uncle so your dad's brother or your mom's brother the nearest male to you can restore what you've lost Hallelujah now let's go to the Book of Ruth we'll try to finish up here how am I going to finish I gotta do it Ruth Ruth is right before Judges Ruth and judges now we see the first mention in in Ruth 2 verse 20 now if you got a scull field Bible I don't know how many you have this but brother brandom preached the kinsman redeemer in the 50s I forget which year it was and he preached right out of here he pulls these exact words right out of the right out of Scofield's uh outline here oh that's the wrong one Ruth and judges I was pointing to the wrong book there it is scoffield puts four steps or four stages in the Book of Ruth and brother R preaches all four stages I'm just going to preach it to you today brother Bram said the first step is Ruth deciding to follow Jehovah that's justification this second Ruth serving that's sanctification amen she got to serve out there in the hot Fields am where it's really Burns some on your flesh breaking all these bad habits Church said and third is Ruth resting that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen you find rest for your soul amen and the fourth is Ruth reward of course that's eternal life right that's we get those rewards at the marriage supper of the Lamb oh but brother preaches these four stages of Ruth out of the right out of Scofield's notes Here am amen praise God and this is a beautiful type because Ruth was a Mobius Ruth was a gentile Ruth had no hope the Bible said no moias can enter into the congregation for 14 years remember we preached that a few weeks ago not one of them can enter in but no doubt God let Ruth in Hallelujah because she came in by marriage she came in by Blood she came in by the kinsman redeemer Hallelujah God's law amen God's law of Grace amen the law required moabites couldn't come in but Grace met the requirements hallelujah oh I feel good now amen I can preach for another two hours but I'm not going to Hallelujah I better not Ruth 220 I'd be in big trouble then i' think I'd be stranded here is what would happen that'd be that'd be I would be stranded here hallelujah verse 20 and Naomi said unto her daughter-in-law Blessed Be he of the Lord who ha not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead and no said unto her the man is near of kin unto us one of our next Kinsmen okay so so Naomi is telling Ruth you know this guy Boaz he's pretty close to our Kinsman you need to go you need to go see him that's what happens in chapter 3 right let's go go to chapter 3 verse 10 now you know the story she goes down there she initiates it now look at this church she initiates this marriage but the only way she could do that is because the word of God initiated her to do that amen now don't don't start spreading the doctrine brother Jesse says sisters can start choosing husbands no no no I didn't say that I didn't say that I know you wouldn't say that I'm just talking about the internet people you know how crazy they are but look what he tells her she tells her Naomi says no you go lay down there and lay at his feet and when he make sure make sure he's eat and drank a lot make sure he feels real good he's had a lot to eat and a lot to drink make sure he's fully satisfied church I didn't know this till today but Boaz was 80 years old 80 80 remember they were healthier longer right so even though he's 80 I mean he still still had good life left now verse 10 what I say verse 10 well actually wakes up let's go to verse n and he said who art thou and she answered I am Ruth thine handmaid spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid for thou art a near Kinsman so he B she basically says spread your skirt over me take me in to be your wife right what does he say and he said never you never ask me you know no that's not I'm just adding that to the Bible for a drama he said blessed be thou the Lord my daughter for thou has show more kindness in the latter end than that at the beginning in as much as thou Foust not young men whether rich or poor so instantly Boaz realized you could have ran off and got a more rich husband than me even but if you done that you would have broke the word of God you would have denied the kinsman redeemer law in other words you're a word woman you're a sister that keeps the word you believe the word that's right and you know God will back up his word amen hallelujah you're trusting in the word in other words you trusted the word back there in Moab Hallelujah you trusted the word to follow Naomi you trusted that and you trusted uh Naomi when you got here and you gleaned to my field Hallelujah you trusted her all the way and she represents the Old Testament Hallelujah she represents the word of God hallelujah and Boaz represents Jesus Christ hallelujah amen you're blessed because you followed God's provided way hallelujah oh my Hallelujah John Gil says this he says instead of calling her an immodest woman for laying herself down at his feet and a bold impudent woman she being poor to ask marriage of him instead of being angry with her and chiding and reproving her for disturbing disturbing and frightening him in the night how many you like to get W woken up in the night I don't we got woken up last night sadly but who likes to get woken up in the middle of the night nobody so this shows the spirit of God was on this man Hallelujah instead of being frightened He blesses her and prays to God to bless her bless this woman and prosper her in what she has engaged and in a kind and loving manner calls her his daughter for thou has showed more kindness in the latter and than the beginning that is she showed kindness to her husband's family so she's respecting her husband's family who died she's still respecting them see it would have been disrespect to go to some other man right she had to follow God's law because God wants that man's seed to be continued amen God wants to honor that family honor that seed line don't go chasing somebody else stay in the family God gave you so she he recognizes you showed kindness to your deceased husband and she'd shown much love to her husband living and dying and her mother-in-law she could have walked away like orpa but she stayed with the word of God hallelujah I love that she said where you live I'll live where you die I'll die amen that's real dedication right there I want to live with you I want to die with you hallelujah boy said you show great kindness to your family you show great kindness to your deceased husband and your mother-in-law this woman Ruth she left her country and Kindred to come with her into a strange country and labor to support her her mother-in-law as she had done all which was great kindness and she was a proelite as well she showed kindness toward God right she showed a good spirit toward God but the kindness she showed now exceeded all the former and that she was desirous according to God's law to build up her husband's family this is how much God respects marriages and families this was the greatest of all respects because she's going to build up her husband's family look at the headship right there my goodness Hallelujah she didn't run to a different headship she stayed under the same headship and the right says this was the greatest respect of all to honor the headship you were placed under H to Mary the next near Kinsman even though an old man to raise up seed to the name and reme and memory of her husband my so in doing this and trying to marry into her husband's family she's honoring her husband and she's going to ra up raise up seed Hallelujah and we all know what come out of Ruth Hallelujah ohed Jesse and then all the way down to David and out of that comes Jesus Christ hallelujah amen amen God was pleased with this decision to be a kinsman redeemer praise God hallelujah I got to close here so let me just read brother RS quote he says now the Book of Ruth gives a beautiful picture Boaz and Naomi had lost the estate you you know you heard me preach on it haven't you raised your hands if you heard me preach on it so you understand Boaz had to become a redeemer and he was the only one that could he had to be a Kinsman a near Kinsman and in redeeming Naomi he got Ruth that was Jesus Boaz typing Christ and when he redeemed Israel he got the Gentile bride so then you see so very beautiful we have it on tape I'm I'm sure here somewhere you'd like to have it amen oh that's wonderful Hallelujah now I'm going to read this last part and then we'll finish up here Boaz said in as much as thou didn't follow the young men whether rich or poor she didn't go after she didn't go after the The Young and the rich and the famous there's a lot of other younger men she could have stronger men but she chose to marry an old man why because of respect to her husband and her husband's family the phrase of following young men is not to be understood as just committing fornication but marriage to them she shunned their company and conversation and did not put herself in the the way of being caressed and addressed by those young rich men and she refused everything of that sort so she just stayed away from the world Hallelujah no matter how glamorous it looks no matter how much they got to offer me I'm going to stay away from that I'm going to stay with the word oh what a character of the Gentile bride Hallelujah I don't care how beautiful the church is I don't care how rich the church is I don't care how much buildings they got I'm going to stay with God's word hallelujah he said she didn't put herself she refused all that she did not to choose she did not choose to follow any young man rich or poor as a bride follows her husband when married to him now Boaz mentions this as an instance of her virtue and of her great respect to her husband's family that a woman of such amiable qualities virtuous Young and Beautiful who doubtless might have been married to a young man in her own country or in Israel but might choose to marry the nearest of kin in her husband's family to perpetuate his name and his memory the Jews say Boaz was now 80 years old and Ruth was 40 half his age oh my and she was able to turn down any all the Rich Young strong men for this old man and God said because you've done that I'm GNA I'm going to bring the seed of the Messiah right through you let's stand to our feet Hallelujah musicians can come it's a beautiful story church I haven't I haven't scratched the surface as brother Ram said I couldn't scratch the surface of it there's there more scriptures in there I trust you can see it Church how Jesus Christ became a kinsman redeemer for you and I how many know he did it how many remember when
