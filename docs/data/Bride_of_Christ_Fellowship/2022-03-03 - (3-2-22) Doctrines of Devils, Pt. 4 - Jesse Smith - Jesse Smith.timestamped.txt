[0:00] second peter three
[0:07] yeah second peter i'm sorry second peter
[0:09] 2 18 please second peter 218.
[0:12] i'll be cautious of the time here i know
[0:14] uh we just
[0:17] gotta be
[0:18] careful here you know people are
[0:20] people need some good rest you know
[0:21] tonight so i'm gonna try to be careful
[0:23] on the time
[0:26] second beater 2 18 and 19.
[0:31] i like to look at doctrines of devils
[0:32] again tonight and
[0:34] the reason we're doing that is to expose
[0:36] the enemy
[0:37] you know satan hates to be exposed right
[0:40] he hates to be called out he hates to he
[0:42] likes to hide where nobody sees him but
[0:43] when we preach these things it brings us
[0:46] a reality when we're battling those evil
[0:47] spirits then we can expose the enemy and
[0:50] cast him down in jesus name
[0:52] amen that's why we're preaching on this
[0:54] by the grace of god and also to give us
[0:56] discernment for the future and also for
[0:58] the present
[1:00] so i trust these sermons have been a
[1:01] blessing to you i believe this is the
[1:03] 11th part on just doctrine we started
[1:05] with all the good doctrine jesus
[1:06] doctrine all these wonderful things and
[1:08] now we've kind of been looking at these
[1:10] evil doctrines
[1:11] to give us discernment in this last day
[1:13] here this this final age we'd say before
[1:16] the rapture second peter 2 18-19
[1:27] second peter 2 18 and 19.
[1:31] let's read 18 together and i'll just
[1:33] read 19 by myself so let's eight do 18
[1:36] together and i'll do student 19 by
[1:37] myself
[1:39] verse 18. let's read that on three ready
[1:41] one two three
[1:42] for when they speak great swelling words
[1:45] of vanity they allure through the lusts
[1:49] of the flesh through much wantedness
[1:52] those that were clean escape from them
[1:55] who live in error what a scripture
[1:59] so they use these great swelling words
[2:02] but they're vain they don't mean what
[2:04] they say
[2:05] right and how do they attract people
[2:07] with these through lust of the flesh so
[2:10] they say these great things and they use
[2:12] lust of the flesh to make it make life
[2:14] more easy right
[2:15] uh to make it seem like uh you got to be
[2:18] rich or you gotta if you're spiritual
[2:19] you'll be rich right
[2:21] verse 19 i'll read verse 19
[2:23] while they promised them liberty so
[2:25] these preachers always promising people
[2:27] liberty
[2:28] but they themselves are the servants of
[2:30] corruption that's why you must watch the
[2:32] fruit of any preacher jesus said a tree
[2:34] is known by its fruit
[2:37] watch the uh watch the results of
[2:39] someone's life and that will tell you if
[2:40] they're a real christian or not
[2:43] he says uh moving on uh they are
[2:46] servants of corruption for of whom a man
[2:48] has overcome of the same is he brought
[2:50] into bondage let's have a word of prayer
[2:52] here as we approach the throne of grace
[2:54] if you have any on your heart just make
[2:55] an owner to god and we just trust the
[2:56] lord will speak to you tonight heavenly
[2:58] father we just come again reverently
[3:00] lord our hands are high heart full of
[3:02] praise or my heart is full of praise you
[3:04] are so good you're so great you're so
[3:05] merciful thank you jesus i was lost and
[3:08] could not see but you did not give up on
[3:10] me lord god hallelujah to save me from
[3:13] my guilt and shame hallelujah thank you
[3:15] god hallelujah you rose from the grave
[3:17] thank you god for lord conquering my sin
[3:20] paying for my sin lord and delivering me
[3:22] and setting me free imputing unto me
[3:24] your righteousness in each one of us
[3:26] here tonight lord that are believers by
[3:29] faith through grace lord god we just
[3:31] thank you god and we ask you to minister
[3:32] here to the needs in the congregation
[3:34] please heal our sick and afflicted we
[3:36] pray and we pray your gran every
[3:37] blessing upon your people tonight that
[3:39] they have need of in jesus christ's name
[3:41] and the saint said
[3:42] amen god bless you as you're being
[3:43] seated praise god
[3:54] okay we'll try to just be
[3:56] right on the word here as we can upset a
[3:58] little time as a reminder
[4:00] god bless you and appreciate everybody
[4:02] pressing out to the house of god tonight
[4:04] so we want to just briefly just look at
[4:06] these you know uh sunday we just looked
[4:08] at really one doctrine on sunday but um
[4:11] these doctrines of devils i hope that
[4:12] was a blessing
[4:13] sunday we basically looked at god always
[4:15] wants you to be healthy and wealthy
[4:16] right we kind of looked at that one
[4:18] the main one on sunday there
[4:20] but we now preach on six of them these
[4:22] are these two are definitely called
[4:24] doctrines of devils by the bible
[4:27] and of course we know this i'm sorry
[4:28] this one is the third one is as well
[4:30] uh the third one is kind of talked about
[4:32] with gluttony and so forth like that
[4:34] because the bible speaks of gluttony as
[4:35] a sin
[4:36] saying the rapture's already happened or
[4:38] we're living in the millennium or
[4:39] something like that
[4:40] uh and then once saved always say we see
[4:42] how that was uh that's a doctrine of a
[4:44] devil lets people live in sin and and
[4:47] try to think that they've actually
[4:48] repented when they haven't and church i
[4:50] was thinking about this uh this week did
[4:52] you know that god told moses that god
[4:54] would blot out names in the old
[4:55] testament
[4:56] did you know that
[4:58] in the old testament god said he would
[5:00] blot names out god was going to destroy
[5:02] israel and moses said god take me
[5:04] kill me instead of the people.
[5:06] and god said no moses he said i'm going
[5:08] to he said i'll blot out whoever sinned
[5:10] against me. so what i'm trying to show
[5:12] you is that in the old testament there
[5:13] was an ames blotted off the book of life
[5:15] and the new testament there's names
[5:17] blotted off the book of life
[5:18] and jesus christ is the same yesterday
[5:20] today and forever hallelujah but if you
[5:23] remain in the faith if you confess your
[5:24] sins if you walk in the light as he's in
[5:26] the light then nothing will remove your
[5:27] name off the book praise god because
[5:29] you've just met god's requirements
[5:31] you've done what he said you told he
[5:32] said repent and be baptized you shall be
[5:34] filled with the holy ghost you've done
[5:35] that praise god and then your name
[5:37] remains on the book amen hallelujah
[5:39] praise god amen well let's look that up
[5:42] if you got a minute let's go to i think
[5:43] it's uh exodus 34. or not exodus 33.
[5:47] but let me exit out of here and we'll
[5:48] see we can look it up real quick here
[5:50] his name will i blot out
[5:53] him will i blotter i believe the
[5:54] scripture says
[6:00] i'm sorry exodus 32 there it is yeah if
[6:01] you want you can just look up there
[6:03] maybe
[6:04] uh no no i don't like that view okay
[6:06] that's a good view okay
[6:12] okay look at verse 31 32 31 and moses
[6:15] returned unto the lord and said oh this
[6:17] people have sinned the great sin and
[6:18] have made them gods of gold
[6:21] yet
[6:22] now if thou wilt forgive their sin and
[6:24] if not look at this blot me i pray thee
[6:27] out of thy book which thou hast written
[6:31] talk about love for the people
[6:34] wishing yourself to be cursed
[6:37] wishing yourself to be lost rather than
[6:39] the people and the church said
[6:41] i mean you couldn't have any greater
[6:42] love than that that you would have your
[6:44] name off the book of life so that other
[6:46] people could be saved jesus said no ma
[6:48] no greater love hath have this than a
[6:50] man give his life for someone else
[6:52] praise god
[6:54] so and now look what god says god said
[6:56] well does god say well no i never blot
[6:58] out names off the book no that's not
[7:00] what god says god says the lord said to
[7:02] moses whosoever sinned against me him
[7:04] will i blot out of my book
[7:07] praise god so if god blotted out names
[7:09] in the old testament won't he do in the
[7:10] new
[7:11] of course well now we since we said that
[7:13] scripture let's read this one
[7:15] did you know paul said the same thing as
[7:17] moses
[7:23] i believe he said
[7:24] okay it's not wish
[7:29] i think he said uh yeah go to romans 11
[7:30] i believe it's there romans 11.
[7:38] for some reason i don't have it uh right
[7:40] on the uh right on my mind here
[7:47] well it's not coming up there
[7:49] oh
[7:59] oh maybe it's a cursed maybe a cursed
[8:03] any bible reader know which what i'm
[8:04] talking about where paul says he wishes
[8:06] he was accursed for israel's sake
[8:09] there it is yep i found it okay
[8:12] sorry about that sometimes these things
[8:14] just come to me and i want to just show
[8:15] it to you right now because we're
[8:16] talking about it
[8:17] now moses said curse me and put me off
[8:20] the book of life so that people could be
[8:21] saved paul said the same thing amen
[8:24] moses was the writer of the old
[8:25] testament paul wrote the majority of the
[8:27] new testament amen both writers praise
[8:29] god we're able to say lord he said for i
[8:32] wish i wish i could be a curse from
[8:34] christ for my brethren my kinsmen
[8:37] according to the flesh see there's
[8:38] something about every believer that you
[8:40] want to see people save so bad that
[8:42] sometimes you wish you could be lost so
[8:44] that they could be saved
[8:46] amen that's what the bible says twice i
[8:48] just showed you and the mouth of two or
[8:50] three witnesses let every word be
[8:52] established
[8:53] that's why when they were martyred
[8:54] brother when stephen was martyred and
[8:55] jesus died on the cross they said father
[8:57] forgive them
[8:59] then say father send them to hell
[9:01] right they had a merciful spirit they
[9:03] had a gracious spirit praise god
[9:05] father forgive them they don't know what
[9:07] they're doing amen
[9:09] okay now let me show you where jesus
[9:11] said if you don't overcome he blots the
[9:13] names out but i'm glad we got overcomers
[9:15] here tonight praise god
[9:16] never never think yourself a judas never
[9:18] think yourself a failure always know i
[9:21] do fall short but that's why the blood's
[9:23] there amen
[9:24] hallelujah because other people they
[9:26] blaspheme the blood but you love god and
[9:28] you thank god for the blood amen
[9:31] this red letter words right so jesus
[9:32] said he that overcomes the same shall be
[9:34] clothed in white raiment and i will not
[9:38] so that means those who don't overcome
[9:40] will be blotted out
[9:42] i will not blot out his name out of the
[9:44] book of life but i will confess his name
[9:46] before my father and before his angels
[9:48] and the church said so i've just showed
[9:50] you plain proof while people can have
[9:52] their name on the book of life but god
[9:53] can blot it off
[9:55] and that real believers wish they could
[9:58] uh you know be be cursed so that other
[10:00] people could be saved amen
[10:02] which is really divine love that's holy
[10:04] love praise god
[10:06] amen
[10:08] all right well that worked out pretty
[10:09] good i found that pretty quick so i'm
[10:10] thankful to lord thank you jesus for
[10:11] helping me find that
[10:13] okay
[10:14] so everybody can see that now we looked
[10:16] at the healthy and wealthy thing on
[10:17] sunday god doesn't always make you a
[10:19] wealthy if you're a christian
[10:21] god doesn't always make you healthy if
[10:22] you're a christian
[10:24] right you can pray see god but god has a
[10:26] specific testimony for everyone
[10:29] amen now i've said it like this before
[10:31] but also i've said god wants to heal 99
[10:33] of the time
[10:34] right because think about think think of
[10:36] in our lives every time we got sick do
[10:38] we normally get well
[10:39] yeah but does it take a few a few months
[10:41] or a few days or hopefully not months
[10:42] but yes usually takes a little time so
[10:46] in most cases god does want to heal now
[10:48] maybe 99 is a little bit of a stretch
[10:50] i'm not saying that's gospel
[10:52] i'm just saying it seems like the most
[10:53] time we get sick we pretty soon get well
[10:55] by god's grace
[10:57] right
[10:58] so it seems like god most of the time
[11:00] wants to heal
[11:02] but it depends it's his will on how that
[11:05] happens whether it's miracle or divine
[11:06] healing miracles instant divine healing
[11:08] takes time and they're two separate
[11:10] gifts brother that's a good good good
[11:12] study for us one day we'll have to hit
[11:14] that one day miracles are instant
[11:15] happens right now like johnny well no no
[11:18] no that would be uh that'd be divine
[11:19] healing too because it took two weeks
[11:20] for that little uh that cyst on his
[11:22] wife's foot to vanish two weeks so
[11:24] that's divine healing that's not a
[11:25] miracle that's divine healing slow
[11:27] healing
[11:28] okay now getting to tonight uh now
[11:30] remember i preached on these remember
[11:31] these 18 or 19 fierce sins remember
[11:34] these i'm not going to go over this
[11:37] but any doctrine that teaches the
[11:39] following are doctrines of devils so any
[11:41] church that allows you to love yourself
[11:44] i mean worship yourself and live live
[11:46] luxuriously
[11:48] right you should take care of yourself
[11:49] you should be healthy right you should
[11:51] get good sleep you should eat good food
[11:53] you should exercise you should do that
[11:54] that's not self-love that's just using
[11:56] wisdom
[11:57] that's just taking care of the body god
[11:59] gave you because your body member is not
[12:00] your own your body's the temple of the
[12:02] holy ghost amen
[12:04] and if i'm healthier then that means god
[12:06] can use me more than if i'm laying the
[12:07] bed sick
[12:09] amen hallelujah if i take care of my
[12:12] temple then god can use me more for his
[12:13] glory
[12:16] now any any church that teaches you you
[12:18] can be covetous that's
[12:19] that that's a lie that's the doctrine of
[12:21] a devil
[12:23] right like you hear those uh tv
[12:24] preachers say oh you drive by a house
[12:26] and you speak to that house and that's
[12:27] going to be yours oh come on that's
[12:30] that's just
[12:31] that's such borderline covetousness it's
[12:33] different if god inspires you to say
[12:35] that but just because you want a bigger
[12:37] house or want a better car doesn't mean
[12:39] that's god's will all the time
[12:41] amen
[12:43] god doesn't always reward people with
[12:44] all kinds of money or all kinds of
[12:46] natural blessings
[12:47] right
[12:49] so uh well i'm not gonna i'm gonna go
[12:51] through these faster right so anyone
[12:53] that teaches you to boast and how great
[12:54] you are we're gonna get to that tonight
[12:56] uh that's a doctrine of a devil anyone
[12:58] that teaches you to be proud and know
[13:00] everything that's a doctrine of a devil
[13:02] now that song we just saying we proudly
[13:03] stand and say that's i guess i should
[13:06] change that word we should probably say
[13:07] humbly stand and say or boldly that
[13:09] would be a better word
[13:10] yeah i got to get that song we got to
[13:11] change those lyrics somehow
[13:13] uh but what we're saying is we're not
[13:15] ashamed of the gospel that's basically
[13:16] what we're saying we're not saying we're
[13:18] filled with sinful pride but we're
[13:19] saying we're thankful to be christians
[13:20] and we'll stand for jesus amen
[13:22] he said if you confess me before men
[13:24] i'll confess you before the angels amen
[13:27] anyone that teach you to blaspheme the
[13:29] truth that's a doctrine of a devil
[13:31] anything that teaches children to
[13:32] disobey parents is a devil
[13:35] right anyone that teaches you to be
[13:36] unthankful is a devil
[13:38] unholy right uh without natural
[13:40] affection truce breakers false accusers
[13:44] anything that teaches you not to have
[13:45] self-control is a devil
[13:47] amen
[13:49] anything that teaches you to be fierce
[13:51] instead of tame that's a devil
[13:53] despisers are those that are good that's
[13:54] a devil to be teaching you to be a
[13:56] traitor is a devil to be heady unst or
[13:59] unstable reckless that's a devil
[14:01] something that teaches you to be
[14:02] prideful high minded anything that
[14:04] teaches you to love pleasures more than
[14:06] god is of the devil
[14:08] amen that's a doctrine of a devil
[14:10] right uh anything that teaches you to
[14:12] just have an outside religion but not a
[14:14] real religion that's a doctrine of a
[14:16] devil
[14:16] okay i told you i was gonna go through
[14:18] fast okay
[14:19] now now
[14:20] now so-called message churches and
[14:23] uh use great swelling words of vanity so
[14:25] that's this is our scripture that we
[14:26] read
[14:28] so it's preachers that use these great
[14:30] words that seem so great but are they
[14:32] true
[14:34] most the time they're not right when
[14:35] they're using great swelling words of
[14:36] vanity because vanity is uselessness
[14:38] they're useless words
[14:41] okay now
[14:42] here's the one i want to look at tonight
[14:44] now um
[14:45] i'm going to look at this one right here
[14:46] tonight
[14:48] there's a movement around churches that
[14:50] believe our truth that we are the
[14:52] greatest
[14:53] uh
[14:55] christians of all time that if you live
[14:58] in this day and you follow
[15:00] the rebel the bible revelations that
[15:02] were the greatest of all time i disagree
[15:04] with that
[15:05] i believe that's a doctrine of a devil
[15:08] i do not see any scripture that teaches
[15:11] that and i'm open to correction
[15:14] i'm i'll be corrected by anybody i'm
[15:15] gonna reach out to brother william for
[15:17] that other issue there
[15:18] uh yes sister of faith
[15:29] right and so there's a great bound
[15:30] that's a great question great question
[15:32] that's it uh so if you have your bible
[15:34] um
[15:37] first uh
[15:38] corinthians 11
[15:41] verse 1.
[15:43] first corinthians i'll just pull it up
[15:44] here so you can see a sister yeah god
[15:45] bless you take care hannah
[15:47] god bless you hannah may god heal you
[15:48] soon in jesus name
[15:50] first corinthians
[15:52] 11 1. that's a great question fantastic
[15:55] now here here sister why we we feel like
[15:57] it's okay
[15:59] and as long as we say with the right
[16:00] spirit okay
[16:02] just uh hope you understand what i'm
[16:03] saying paul said be follower be
[16:05] followers of me even as i also am of
[16:08] christ
[16:10] okay
[16:11] now that
[16:13] um
[16:13] i want to i want to balance that out too
[16:15] though because uh brother branham didn't
[16:17] write the bible paul wrote the bible
[16:21] so there's a huge there there's to me
[16:22] there's a big huge difference
[16:25] god had brother or god had paul write
[16:27] the bible and then said if anybody adds
[16:29] to or takes away they're cursed
[16:32] that's quite that's quite a uh that's
[16:33] quite an amen to that that writing
[16:36] okay
[16:37] and so yes i would agree um
[16:41] i would agree uh
[16:42] you know maybe the following maybe is
[16:44] not the best word but
[16:46] we we around here we've been in this
[16:48] long enough that we understand when we
[16:50] say we're following brother branham we
[16:51] mean the scriptures that he's pointing
[16:52] to
[16:54] yeah the scriptures that he's pointing
[16:55] to
[16:56] because the bible uh he says follow me
[16:58] as i follow follow christ
[17:00] and then the bible also says be
[17:02] followers of other churches
[17:04] okay so it all depends how you use that
[17:05] word follow that's a great question
[17:07] um
[17:08] let me pull that up here so you can see
[17:11] that
[17:13] yes yes yes
[17:17] yes the scripture that brother bram
[17:19] yes amen the scripture is brother i'm
[17:21] pointing to you so here paul said be
[17:23] followers of god he also said be
[17:24] followers of me what do you mean we got
[17:25] two people we're following well in one
[17:28] way well because god's the one that gave
[17:29] paul the bible
[17:31] now um
[17:34] yeah here's let me do this one here so
[17:35] you can see that one this will be a good
[17:36] one for you
[17:39] in other words
[17:40] paul told the thessalonicans okay
[17:42] they're also that's a church in turkey
[17:44] as well for ye brethren became followers
[17:46] of the churches of god well i thought we
[17:49] were only supposed to follow god i
[17:50] thought we were supposed to follow paul
[17:51] well we can follow churches too
[17:54] it all depends how you define follow and
[17:57] that in this case it means
[17:59] and
[18:00] i think everybody understand this no
[18:01] church is perfect
[18:03] because we always have sin right here in
[18:05] our bodies and you follow me around long
[18:07] enough you're going to see me make a
[18:08] mistake i'm going to sin i'm going to
[18:09] fall short of god's glory i'm going to
[18:10] let you down
[18:11] so it doesn't mean follow like worship
[18:14] but it just means watch the godly life
[18:16] that they live and then imitate that
[18:19] okay
[18:21] because
[18:22] the ultimate following is following
[18:23] christ
[18:24] and that that's what paul said we're
[18:26] followers of god but in other words but
[18:28] also god has true believers the bible
[18:31] said god will not leave himself without
[18:32] a witness on the earth amen so at all
[18:34] times in history there's always been at
[18:36] least one or two or maybe more believers
[18:38] that people can follow and know they
[18:40] were true servants of christ i believe
[18:41] i'm one of them
[18:42] i believe you should follow my bible
[18:44] teaching as i point to the bible too
[18:46] right
[18:47] you should follow the churches
[18:49] right you should follow their godly
[18:51] example now we have lots lots of other
[18:53] scriptures on that one but that's a
[18:54] great question
[18:55] the bible says obey them that have the
[18:57] rule over you that doesn't mean
[18:59] everything i tell you to do it just
[19:00] means everything that i point to in the
[19:02] bible that you obey
[19:04] fantastic question that is just a great
[19:06] great question sister great question
[19:09] and yeah i could uh you know i could
[19:10] reword that and that's why i need help
[19:12] like i i need feedback like that you
[19:13] know i want to word it the right way but
[19:15] if you look at those other scriptures
[19:16] you know you'll see that
[19:19] okay
[19:20] amen praise god thank you now
[19:23] satan will use that though as you know
[19:24] sister you've seen another turn you've
[19:26] seen it in bad churches right where they
[19:27] use that follow me like you got to
[19:29] worship me basically right so
[19:31] as long as the person has the holy ghost
[19:33] and their obedience holy ghost that
[19:34] follow will only mean imitate the bible
[19:37] imitate the bible
[19:39] doctrines that i live
[19:41] but a sinful person will say you gotta
[19:43] follow me and do everything i say and no
[19:44] matter what don't question me fear me
[19:47] you know if you if you're you're against
[19:48] me you're against god i mean
[19:50] that's nonsense
[19:51] okay amen great question
[19:53] amen thank you yeah great question
[19:55] now here's why i'm bringing this out
[19:58] i believe it's a doctrine of the devil
[20:00] to say that we're the greatest
[20:01] christians of all time i believe any
[20:03] holy ghost-filled christian
[20:05] is all the same
[20:07] now there'll be different levels of
[20:08] rewards
[20:10] but only god knows who's the greatest of
[20:13] those
[20:14] but i don't think just because we lived
[20:16] in the year 2022 that we will be we'll
[20:19] have the greatest reward in heaven i do
[20:20] not believe that
[20:22] but see there's a lie coming through and
[20:24] this was this was a two three months ago
[20:28] that uh the leaders in jeffersonville
[20:30] put this out
[20:31] they said dear perfect word bride see
[20:33] how they're exalting the people it's the
[20:35] greatest age of all time with the
[20:36] greatest messenger of all time who is
[20:38] gathering the greatest people of all
[20:40] time that's worship
[20:42] that's idolatry that's pride
[20:46] and they just put this all over the
[20:47] internet
[20:48] see i found some of these things i'm
[20:49] like i gotta share this with the church
[20:51] because i don't want us to think we're
[20:52] better than anybody else
[20:56] if you are saved tonight it is by grace
[20:59] which means it's an unmerited favor amen
[21:02] and everything you do after that just is
[21:04] because you appreciate god saving you
[21:06] amen
[21:08] right but brother brother man said by
[21:09] the blood of jesus uh the person that's
[21:12] been saved ten years is no different
[21:13] than the person who got saved five
[21:14] minutes ago amen because god just washed
[21:16] away all of his sins amen
[21:19] now the one who served god longer will
[21:20] have rewards if they're faithful right
[21:22] and the other one can you know he can
[21:23] serve god more
[21:25] but it's not like it's a competition
[21:28] it's not like that and we should never
[21:30] prop ourselves up like like my wife was
[21:32] saying you know i was talking here
[21:33] before service
[21:36] who knows anyone who suffered more than
[21:38] paul for the gospel of jesus christ
[21:40] he was shipwrecked three times he was
[21:42] beaten five times whipped you know five
[21:45] times 39 times for five times
[21:48] so almost 200 times he was whipped with
[21:50] a cat of nine tails can you imagine his
[21:52] back would look like hamburger five
[21:53] times
[21:55] he was constantly getting robbed he was
[21:57] constantly being beaten he was stoned to
[21:58] death and god raised him up amen
[22:01] who do you know who's gone through just
[22:03] half of those things i don't know
[22:04] anybody
[22:05] i don't know anybody
[22:07] so who do you think is going to get a
[22:08] greater reward
[22:09] us or paul well i think paul that's what
[22:12] i would say i think i think a mind of
[22:14] wisdom would say that
[22:16] but a prideful mind would say we're the
[22:18] greatest of all time and what have you
[22:19] ever suffered in your life
[22:22] that can compare anything to the bible
[22:24] like these by that the bible said they
[22:26] wandered around in sheep skin can you
[22:27] imagine just having sheep skin to wear
[22:30] that's all the clothes you got is
[22:31] sheepskins
[22:32] you have nothing else
[22:34] the bible said they had to wander around
[22:35] in caves brother austin they didn't have
[22:37] their own home just just to survive they
[22:39] had to wonder just from the standing for
[22:41] the message of their days they'd go hang
[22:43] out in caves do you think they had
[22:45] running water and toilets in there of
[22:47] course not
[22:48] and we get discouraged if we have a
[22:49] little mind battle right and these
[22:51] people are you know battling for their
[22:53] lives amen
[22:55] so see i believe that's a lie i believe
[22:56] that's a doctrine of a devil to say
[22:58] we're the greatest christians of all
[23:00] time
[23:01] i'll be that's a lie
[23:03] i can't see that in the bible and he
[23:05] closes the sermon by saying this and
[23:07] then these are the scriptures he uses to
[23:08] say these but they these scriptures
[23:10] never say we're the greatest of all time
[23:12] they never say that
[23:14] i checked
[23:16] i've read those
[23:18] for years none of those talk about
[23:20] saying we're greater than anybody else
[23:24] all we can hope to is be the same
[23:27] praise god and yes there'll be little
[23:29] variations like jesus said some will
[23:30] bring a hundred fold some will bring
[23:32] sixty some will bring thirty so there's
[23:33] at least three levels of rewards but
[23:34] listen we all got eternal life amen
[23:37] we all get to see jesus amen
[23:40] right uh malachi read that scripture
[23:41] your brother austin if you're faithful
[23:42] with 10 talents jesus said i'll make you
[23:44] rule over 10 cities
[23:46] there's i mean there are certain rewards
[23:47] for a different amount of faithfulness
[23:49] but we're all going to be in heaven amen
[23:50] we're all going to have new bodies amen
[23:52] we're all going to live for all eternity
[23:54] amen
[23:56] hallelujah and just because we live in
[23:58] the last day doesn't make us any greater
[24:02] it just means we live in the last day
[24:04] that's all it means
[24:05] see this is such vanity even jesus
[24:07] listen even jesus wouldn't say who would
[24:10] be the greatest
[24:11] yet this man thinks he can choose who's
[24:13] the greatest
[24:15] so this man is either putting himself on
[24:17] the same plane as jesus right because he
[24:19] he says now i know who the greatest is
[24:21] or he's putting himself above jesus like
[24:22] he knows more than jesus he don't know
[24:24] more than jesus
[24:26] jesus was humble in his humanity this
[24:29] man must not be
[24:30] i know that's rough but that's the truth
[24:34] jesus said to john and uh james's mother
[24:36] i'm sorry yeah james and john ye shall
[24:39] need drink of my cup which was
[24:41] martyrdom and be baptized with the
[24:43] baptism baptized with the holy ghost
[24:44] baptism but to sit on my right and left
[24:47] it is not mine to give but it should be
[24:49] given to them for it is whom prepared to
[24:50] my father even jesus didn't know who
[24:52] gets the closest the best reward would
[24:54] be sitting right next to jesus
[24:56] i don't know amen you imagine the person
[24:58] who sits right next to him they can
[24:59] reach over sister naomi and put their
[25:01] finger in his nail scar palm amen
[25:04] hallelujah
[25:06] that's the reward they get hallelujah
[25:09] they can they can look down and put
[25:10] their hand right on the uh of the holes
[25:12] in his feet hallelujah that's what he
[25:14] told thomas he said feel me touch me see
[25:17] that i've really said amen
[25:19] hallelujah the one closest to him can
[25:21] lead to this muslim like john amen
[25:25] that'd be the greatest reward to me but
[25:27] jesus doesn't even know who's going to
[25:28] be there because the father didn't make
[25:30] it known to him
[25:31] it wasn't his for the flesh to give it
[25:33] was for the holy ghost inside of him to
[25:34] give
[25:36] that's a deep thought but remember jesus
[25:37] was both fully man and fully god
[25:44] and brother ram said this is the worst
[25:45] age they're saying it's the greatest age
[25:47] now i know what they're saying it's it'd
[25:48] be the greatest to live to live until
[25:50] jesus rapture so you don't die i know
[25:52] what they're saying but brother ham
[25:53] never said this what they're saying
[25:56] i understand what they're saying
[25:58] now here's a second blog post with more
[26:01] great see how these are swelling words
[26:03] of vanity
[26:06] like how would you feel if someone's
[26:08] trying to tell you're the greatest
[26:09] christian there ever was
[26:11] would you feel prideful would you accept
[26:12] that or would you would you cast that
[26:14] down
[26:16] i would cast it down i'm like i'm only
[26:17] 41. what have i ever done i've never
[26:19] done a missionary trip i've never i've
[26:21] never saved souls like 3 000 at a time i
[26:23] mean three thousand souls in the day of
[26:25] pentecost one sermon three thousand so
[26:27] three thousand baptisms amen
[26:30] i've never walked on water
[26:32] right
[26:33] i've never had anybody get healed just
[26:35] from my shadow
[26:39] and yet this lying devil is exalting us
[26:42] where a lot of times i wonder how much
[26:43] time they're spending on their phone
[26:44] instead of praying or reading their
[26:45] bibles i wonder how much money they've
[26:47] sent over to missionaries that really
[26:48] preach amen that really preach
[26:51] and by the way just let you know i
[26:52] reached out to a real missionary this
[26:54] week and i said do you know any
[26:55] missionaries that are out on the field
[26:57] so i can send them money he's like i
[26:58] don't know any
[26:59] and this is a guy who's gone to egypt
[27:01] iran
[27:03] and he don't know anybody that's
[27:04] traveling missionary work so i'm a
[27:06] little bit uh
[27:07] uh well what i know is we need to pray
[27:09] for more missionaries amen the bible
[27:11] said pray that the lord of the harvest
[27:13] will send laborers into the harvest amen
[27:16] hallelujah like i'm trying to give away
[27:17] money sister
[27:18] brother i'm trying to give away money to
[27:20] missionaries but nobody's going
[27:22] he said the doors are open now some of
[27:23] the covert restrictions have uh relaxed
[27:27] but we'll have to wait praise god we
[27:29] have to wait i just thought that was
[27:30] interesting nobody's going
[27:33] ah so that's a great swelling words oh
[27:36] you're the greatest christians of all
[27:37] the greatest of all time that's a lie
[27:40] that's a lie we thank god for the blood
[27:41] we're all under the same blood we're all
[27:42] in the same grace
[27:44] but let us not be exalted
[27:46] remember it's just like jesus's
[27:47] disciples remember before they got the
[27:49] holy ghost they were arguing who's the
[27:50] greatest
[27:52] oh my there who i'm greater than you
[27:53] you're greater no no i'm greater than
[27:55] you i'm great at you here we are today
[27:56] these these people around the same truth
[27:59] around the message arguing about who's
[28:01] greater than who
[28:04] if you're arguing about or trying to say
[28:05] who's greater than others you're you got
[28:07] your eyes off the rock the real thing
[28:09] you got your eyes off christ
[28:12] you're trying to worry about who's
[28:13] greater than anybody else just serve
[28:15] jesus get your eyes on christ get your
[28:17] eyes off everybody else amen and get
[28:18] your eyes on jesus amen
[28:21] here's another blog post with uh
[28:24] they're basically telling you you can go
[28:26] speak a world and go live on it
[28:28] which that we know there's a quote there
[28:30] there's a quote where brother adam says
[28:32] that but he's just talking about the
[28:33] power of the word of god
[28:36] but see i always take the other side the
[28:38] devil takes that quote and tries to puff
[28:40] people up with that and i always say the
[28:42] other side instead of speaking the world
[28:45] and going living on it why don't you
[28:46] speak to your life right now and live a
[28:48] godly christian life right now in this
[28:50] world amen
[28:51] why don't you change some instead of
[28:53] running away from all these people why
[28:54] don't you get into their lives and try
[28:55] to win some souls amen
[28:58] you know what why would you want to go
[28:59] live on another world and abandon
[29:01] everybody why don't you want to be here
[29:02] and try to get souls to save out of hell
[29:05] amen see how the enemy takes that quote
[29:07] and he makes it he just
[29:09] puffs people up with it oh you have so
[29:11] much power you can go speak in a world
[29:13] and live on it well yeah you might but
[29:15] that's not god's will right now god
[29:16] don't want you to run from the world god
[29:18] doesn't want you to isolate yourself
[29:19] from the world he wants to be the salt
[29:21] of the earth amen
[29:26] so here's another uh
[29:28] deer stimulated bride letter
[29:31] he says we can close the heavens we can
[29:33] shut this and i said no the two prophets
[29:35] do that
[29:39] and if so if i'm wrong somebody show me
[29:41] where the people in jeffersonville have
[29:43] shut the heavens and it don't rain
[29:45] or don't snow we just went through
[29:47] winter has it anybody shot the heavens
[29:48] and it didn't snow
[29:50] see there it's all this great swelling
[29:52] words of vanity
[29:54] like they're
[29:56] like they're doing all these
[29:56] supernatural works they're they're
[29:58] they're misunderstanding the scripture
[30:00] the scripture says the two prophets shut
[30:02] the heavens so it doesn't rain for three
[30:04] and a half years during the days of
[30:06] their prophecy
[30:08] amen
[30:09] or do that or listen look you can do
[30:11] whatever you want to you can speak
[30:13] whatever you want to no you can't
[30:15] anybody with any bible discernment would
[30:17] know that's wrong you can't do anything
[30:20] you want you just do what god wants you
[30:21] to do
[30:23] like we're talking about we can't even
[30:24] speak our own healing unless god tells
[30:26] us to do it
[30:27] amen
[30:28] oh whatever we want to do no that's a
[30:31] selfish prideful spirit
[30:34] a real christian doesn't say my will a
[30:36] real christian says thy will be done
[30:39] see this is what the spirits were
[30:40] battling today
[30:41] prideful spirits
[30:44] the enemy will be slayed by the word
[30:46] that proceeds from our mouth for a
[30:47] sharper than two-edged sword now that's
[30:49] true we could even call for a hundred
[30:51] billion tons of flies if we wanted to
[30:53] call them no you couldn't
[30:54] no there's only if not if you wanted to
[30:56] if god wanted to send them they're
[30:58] talking see they're talking about the
[30:59] two moses down in egypt and they're
[31:01] saying well we could do that well no you
[31:03] can't unless god tells you to do it
[31:06] and if so what have you ever what have
[31:08] you spoken have you spoken one ton he's
[31:11] talking about 100 million tons have you
[31:12] ever spoken one ton of flies
[31:15] no
[31:15] how about one pound of flies have you
[31:17] ever spoken that
[31:19] see it's these great swelling words of
[31:20] pride and vanity
[31:22] it's getting people to off the mark of
[31:24] just doing a simple living a simple
[31:26] humble christian life loving your
[31:28] neighbor forgiving those that have
[31:29] sinned against you praying and repenting
[31:31] amen trying to win souls of jesus draw
[31:34] closer to god it gets their minds way up
[31:36] on these vain things instead of getting
[31:38] on the real gospel of jesus christ
[31:41] amen
[31:43] just vain
[31:45] that's not going to help anybody speak
[31:46] flies into existence
[31:49] ridiculous
[31:51] the prophets will do that amen because
[31:53] they're anointed to do it hallelujah
[31:55] that's their ministry that's not our
[31:57] ministry
[31:59] see they're trying to make
[32:00] they're trying to make their church feel
[32:02] like they're the two prophets
[32:06] i could say something i don't i don't
[32:07] know if that'd be the right thing to say
[32:10] i just got a little bit zeal right now
[32:11] here so whatever now look whatever we
[32:13] say now see again we it's about us see
[32:16] it's about them instead about christ
[32:18] it's not whatever we say it's whatever
[32:20] god says
[32:21] it's going to happen because it's the
[32:22] word of god coming from the mouth of god
[32:26] we will have complete supreme control of
[32:28] the earth for we are an amateur god i
[32:30] don't think we're going to have complete
[32:31] control i think jesus is going to have
[32:32] complete control
[32:36] see it's just it's this puffed up thing
[32:38] where it's you you you we we got the
[32:41] power we can speak anything we can do
[32:42] whatever we want no you can't do
[32:44] whatever you want
[32:45] even jesus said i don't do my will but i
[32:47] do the father's will
[32:49] god is the god of universe everywhere
[32:51] but we'll have earth control under our
[32:52] own control when only only if god gives
[32:54] it to us we can speak we can name we can
[32:57] say we can stop nature we can do
[32:58] anything we want it is our inheritance
[33:00] that has been restored i said perhaps
[33:02] but we don't know what that for sure
[33:04] these are swelling words of entity
[33:09] can you believe that people swallow this
[33:10] down they say amen they shout and scream
[33:12] at this why because it's it's
[33:13] self-worship
[33:14] it's pride they love that pride
[33:18] we're not now here's i want to bring
[33:20] this out too we've not been with
[33:22] anything but his original word we've not
[33:23] flirted or even looked at anything else
[33:25] now this i'm going to get to this a
[33:26] little bit these people do not look at
[33:28] anything else except tapes
[33:30] now there's nothing wrong with enjoying
[33:31] the tapes there's nothing wrong with
[33:33] feeding on the tapes and receiving
[33:34] revelation from the tapes but this goes
[33:36] far as worshiping the tapes and looking
[33:38] at nothing else
[33:40] nothing else is that how brother braham
[33:42] did it
[33:43] no brother read books by women brother
[33:45] branham read books by preachers
[33:48] brother ram looked for sources of
[33:50] inspiration outside of his own preaching
[33:52] amen
[33:54] in order to find the truth and then
[33:56] preach us the truth when he found it in
[33:58] the bible amen
[34:00] gloria
[34:03] church this is called behavior there's
[34:04] my 30 minutes can you believe that oh my
[34:06] goodness wow
[34:07] i'm just shocked every time
[34:10] uh they say we say with the voice of god
[34:12] this is cult behavior you can't look at
[34:14] anything else you know that's what cults
[34:15] do
[34:16] they say cut off your family
[34:18] they say don't look at anything else
[34:20] just do our stuff our stuff our stuff
[34:22] our stuff
[34:24] total fear-based control
[34:26] fear-based control that's the only way
[34:28] they're going to keep them that's the
[34:28] only way they're going to keep their
[34:29] money coming too
[34:31] because that's what they're really after
[34:32] money
[34:35] like i said they won't even return my
[34:36] feedback on on their website if they
[34:38] care so much about me to help me why
[34:40] don't they why don't they answer my
[34:41] questions
[34:42] they stop doing that because they don't
[34:44] have any answers
[34:49] now look here now here's a clear example
[34:51] of how they misinterpret the bible look
[34:53] at our sister at the well remember in
[34:54] john chapter four the woman at the well
[34:56] remember that
[34:58] uh brother brown said she didn't have to
[35:00] tarry all night
[35:02] she got the holy ghost then
[35:04] so in other words they're saying the
[35:05] woman at the well when she met jesus got
[35:07] the holy ghost at the well well she
[35:09] didn't get the soul holy ghost she got
[35:11] anointing in the mind of the holy ghost
[35:13] or the human spirit because jesus said
[35:14] the holy ghost cannot be given until
[35:16] what he was glorified
[35:18] so here how they they're misinterpreting
[35:20] quotes
[35:21] without the bible they're saying now oh
[35:23] we can have it we're just like the woman
[35:24] at the well we just got to hear a tape
[35:26] and now we're we're all filled with the
[35:27] holy ghost ridiculous
[35:29] ridiculous
[35:30] no you've got to repent of your sins
[35:32] especially of your pride amen that's
[35:35] what they got to do and so do we pray if
[35:37] we get prideful we've got to repent too
[35:38] all men have to repent for all men and
[35:40] women have fallen short of the glory of
[35:42] god but thank god for the grace of
[35:44] christ amen
[35:45] thank god for that burning fire we
[35:47] talked about that burns you and convicts
[35:49] you and points you to confession and
[35:51] repentance and gets you right back on
[35:53] the straight and narrow
[35:55] amen
[35:58] see misinterpreting the bible vain words
[36:00] all puffed up aren't you glad that we
[36:02] have a sound simple humble godly church
[36:05] aren't you glad
[36:08] i'm so thankful for that
[36:10] i will gladly worship with one two three
[36:12] four five six
[36:13] twelve people on a wednesday night i'd
[36:14] rather have twelve than twelve hundred
[36:16] that believe lies
[36:18] amen
[36:19] and worship tapes and worship men and
[36:22] when it's wickedness amen ah i'm just
[36:26] like just like the old saints of the old
[36:27] days amen we're just we're just a small
[36:29] little number praise god we might be
[36:31] small in number but we're uh but we're
[36:33] by god's grace we're saved and we have
[36:35] our eternal assurance we have blessed
[36:37] assurance jesus is mine over the
[36:39] foretaste of glory divine amen
[36:42] we have glory divine praise god
[36:45] hallelujah
[36:49] now look what it says would you like to
[36:52] have the same spiritual stimulation he's
[36:53] talking about the woman at the well you
[36:54] can but there's only one place to get it
[36:56] and they're basically saying you can't
[36:57] get it from a local church you can only
[36:59] get it from a tape
[37:02] that's what they're saying
[37:04] what's that i'm like what is that
[37:07] well it's it's wonderful sermons of
[37:09] brother branham
[37:10] but they're saying in other words
[37:11] they're saying we don't need living
[37:12] preachers say we just gotta press play
[37:14] and and listen to the tape
[37:17] and that deny that breaks ephesians
[37:19] chapter four which says the preachers
[37:22] the five preaching gifts will preach
[37:23] until we all come in the unity of the
[37:25] faith
[37:26] which means the rapture
[37:28] all right a great question
[37:30] come and drink the best wine and receive
[37:32] the best stimulation by revelation uh as
[37:34] we listen to the tapes
[37:36] yes you're gonna get stimulation
[37:37] revelation on the tapes but it's if
[37:39] you're not careful you're gonna get a
[37:40] simulation of pride amen there it is
[37:42] right there you're gonna get a
[37:43] simulation of uh idolatry if you're not
[37:46] careful
[37:48] and you exalt those tastes and worship
[37:50] and make every of those shapes perfect
[37:51] if you do that you're going to get a
[37:53] spirit of pride
[37:57] now saints this is encouraging cult-like
[38:00] behaviors where you isolate
[38:02] you don't answer questions see they they
[38:04] say we don't even we won't even look out
[38:06] to answer questions
[38:08] and then they deny
[38:10] first peter 3 15 which says to always
[38:12] have an answer for all the questions
[38:14] and the bible says prove all things now
[38:16] i wrote that wrong two s's
[38:19] the bible said prove all things in other
[38:21] words for everything you believe prove
[38:22] it by the bible
[38:26] but they seem content sitting in a
[38:28] bubble they just sit in their cult
[38:29] bubble
[38:30] and never take any criticism this is
[38:33] completely opposite of jesus amen
[38:36] hallelujah remember we looked at the
[38:37] beginning where did jesus go every day
[38:39] brother he went to the temple to teach
[38:41] the people publicly
[38:43] and when he was arrested he said when
[38:44] did i ever hide from you when did i say
[38:46] anything in secret everything i've
[38:47] taught i've taught it before everybody
[38:49] amen
[38:51] and jesus took the hardest questions
[38:53] that's what i love about jesus amen he
[38:55] wasn't scared of that devil amen
[38:57] he wasn't scared to take a question from
[38:59] the audience right
[39:01] he wasn't afraid to take a question from
[39:03] the pharisees or the sadducees either he
[39:05] was not afraid of any questions because
[39:07] god did not give him the spirit of fear
[39:09] but a power love and a sound
[39:12] mind he took the hardest ones
[39:15] and then the only reason he stopped
[39:17] getting questions because they got tired
[39:19] of asking him because jesus embarrassed
[39:21] them
[39:24] is that what the bible said
[39:26] the pharisees were gathered together and
[39:27] jesus asked them saying see they've
[39:29] asked him all these questions he says
[39:30] well say who who uh what do you think of
[39:32] christ whose son is he they say unto him
[39:34] the son of david
[39:36] oh oh the messiah is the son of david
[39:40] and he saith to them how does david in
[39:42] the spirit call the lord
[39:47] if the messiah his son how does
[39:50] the messiah's david's son how how can
[39:52] the how can father david call the
[39:54] messiah's son i'm sorry i'll call him
[39:56] lord i'm sorry lord
[39:58] if he's his son how can he call him lord
[40:02] and the lord because then he quotes the
[40:04] book of psalms the lord said unto my
[40:05] lord sit thou on my right hand so i make
[40:07] thine enemies thy footstool if david
[40:10] then call him lord how is he his son
[40:14] if david calls the messiah lord how is
[40:17] he his son
[40:18] because the the messiah had two parts to
[40:20] him he had a human side and he had a
[40:22] divine side
[40:24] hallelujah amen
[40:26] it was god and god sent the son as a
[40:29] perfect human man praise god with no sin
[40:32] amen no sin nature hallelujah praise god
[40:35] that's why david can call him lord
[40:37] because he had no sin he was the lord
[40:39] made flesh amen
[40:41] hallelujah
[40:43] and look after this question
[40:45] they didn't have any more questions left
[40:46] but we can't figure this guy out he's
[40:47] just
[40:49] that's what i found too but i answer
[40:50] people's questions pretty soon i don't
[40:51] even hear from them i answered all their
[40:53] questions well are you going to come
[40:54] back and ask me a question they got done
[40:55] asking me questions because they don't
[40:57] have the answers the bible's got the
[40:58] answers
[41:01] see no man was able to answer him a word
[41:03] neither durst any man from that day
[41:05] forth ask him any more questions
[41:07] because i asked jefferson i said well
[41:09] who's the real joseph is billy paul or
[41:11] joseph and nobody answered me
[41:14] they said we just believe every word as
[41:15] thus saith the lord that's a lie
[41:18] they can't give me an answer
[41:20] i said is the third person burning in
[41:22] your heart because here's what happened
[41:23] brother rahm grew in his understanding
[41:25] at first he thought god was three
[41:26] persons but then god showed him god as
[41:28] one person
[41:29] so they worship every word on tape so
[41:32] brother brahm said isn't it great the
[41:33] third person's burning in our hearts
[41:35] tonight so i used that quote and i said
[41:37] well is the third person in your heart
[41:39] because later brother adam said the lord
[41:40] told him he's not three persons he's one
[41:42] person
[41:44] and i said there's a third person in
[41:45] your heart and they said we just leave
[41:46] everything on the tape so they don't
[41:48] know if a third person's inside of them
[41:50] or the one person but we know amen
[41:54] we know not a second person's in our
[41:56] souls not a third person but the one
[41:58] person amen
[41:59] because god is the holy ghost amen
[42:02] there's only one person praise god yeah
[42:04] brother awesome
[42:09] well
[42:10] if it's understood with catholic thought
[42:13] yes
[42:14] it's basically idolatry at the very
[42:16] least it's the spirit of error
[42:19] because they've added to the bible the
[42:20] bible never calls god three persons the
[42:22] bible does say father son only goes but
[42:23] never says there are three persons
[42:26] yeah right there's one name to the
[42:27] father and holy ghost that's what the
[42:28] bible says that's what jesus said
[42:30] and jesus said i come in my father's
[42:32] name so what's the father's name jesus
[42:33] right the lord jesus christ
[42:36] good question brother good very good
[42:37] question very good question
[42:39] see and now they don't even return my
[42:40] emails now
[42:43] okay um
[42:44] i got
[42:46] six minutes here to go 45 minutes okay
[42:47] so bible proof on who is the greatest
[42:49] really
[42:51] yeah i'll try to finish with this
[42:53] what did jesus say jesus said don't be
[42:55] called masters
[42:57] for one is your master even christ
[42:59] but he that grace among you shall be
[43:01] your
[43:03] servant
[43:04] so the greatest ones are the ones who
[43:05] serve other people
[43:07] not wait to be served but the ones who
[43:09] get up and serve other people
[43:12] now what do most preachers do today they
[43:14] get
[43:15] they get
[43:16] people open the doors for them they get
[43:18] people giving them water they get people
[43:20] uh
[43:21] doing everything for them
[43:24] but if that becomes a lifestyle then the
[43:26] people serving are actually greater than
[43:28] the preachers
[43:29] and not that we're trying to be you know
[43:30] it's not a competition like i said but
[43:32] the fact is those who serve others are
[43:34] greater
[43:37] that's why brother makes a strange
[43:38] statement and i've never understood it
[43:40] but brother branham says he says women
[43:42] may receive greater rewards than many
[43:44] men
[43:46] because who's the one that really serves
[43:48] a lot
[43:49] so it could be that way now i'm not
[43:51] saying that's bible doctrine but i'm
[43:53] just saying that's such a strange
[43:54] statement to make but then if you look
[43:56] at this you could see it like i'm
[43:58] talking about a lazy man he might go to
[43:59] work but then he gets home and he's all
[44:00] lazy he's watching tv and sports and the
[44:03] woman's constantly cleaning praying
[44:06] taking care of the kids you know who's
[44:07] the one really serving
[44:09] and the guys at work being lazy yeah
[44:11] he's getting paid but he's lazy on the
[44:12] job you know who's the one really
[44:15] serving
[44:16] and the church said amen
[44:18] amen
[44:19] now i'm not saying that's
[44:20] i'm not saying that's absolute but it's
[44:22] just strange
[44:23] why would abraham say that
[44:25] now what we need is strong men and
[44:27] strong we need both of them to be
[44:28] servants and the bible says you serve
[44:30] one another amen
[44:32] hallelujah serve one another
[44:34] we must serve one another
[44:36] okay and now look whosoever shall exalt
[44:38] himself like call himself the greatest
[44:40] christian of all time is that what you
[44:41] mean jesus
[44:44] jesus said whosoever shall exalt himself
[44:46] or call himself the greatest christian
[44:47] of all time shall be humbled
[44:51] see i don't want to call myself the
[44:52] greatest christian because i'm not i
[44:53] know i'm not there's no way i am no way
[44:55] not even close
[44:57] i as long as i'm just one of the
[44:59] christians
[45:01] right
[45:02] i know i'm not the greatest never will
[45:04] be not even close not even close
[45:08] right exactly right yeah
[45:10] we haven't seen jesus and visions and
[45:11] spent hours in his presence writing the
[45:12] bible
[45:15] yeah exactly right
[45:16] yeah and all those men did and jesus
[45:18] said those 12 men will judge the 12
[45:20] tribes of israel
[45:22] now we might have cities brother but
[45:23] they got tribes
[45:25] and tribes do many cities
[45:28] so that's why i believe the 12 apostles
[45:30] will have the greatest rewards and i
[45:31] could be wrong i'm just saying that's
[45:33] what the bible says
[45:34] yeah because they they left everything
[45:36] and they they died as martyrs brother
[45:39] each one of them gave their life except
[45:40] john he was only one that didn't have to
[45:42] because whatever god had the god to have
[45:44] him god had to have him write the book
[45:45] of revelation
[45:48] but jesus said if you exalt yourself and
[45:49] call yourself the greatest you'll be a
[45:51] base he said but if you humble yourself
[45:53] god will make you great amen hallelujah
[45:58] these lies see these doctrines of devils
[46:00] you're the greatest of all time you're
[46:01] the greatest like i've heard that man
[46:02] say give yourselves a round of applause
[46:04] why would i praise myself
[46:06] why would i have nothing worth a praise
[46:08] for if anything good comes out of my
[46:10] life it wasn't me it was christ amen
[46:13] it was just that i finally surrendered
[46:15] and said god help me to crucify this
[46:17] selfishness help me to crucify my lust
[46:19] and help me to do what's right what you
[46:21] told me to do so he gets all the glory
[46:23] amen
[46:24] all i did was just surrender finally
[46:28] and remember like i told you that i
[46:29] think austin well yeah we're going to
[46:31] get crowns but you know what we're going
[46:32] to do we're going to cast some out in
[46:33] jesus feet praise god you take the crown
[46:36] you're it's your spirit that conquered
[46:37] all this for me you're the one who died
[46:39] for me amen it's your name that casts
[46:42] out the devils it wasn't my name it was
[46:44] your name amen
[46:46] hallelujah
[46:48] i get that uh
[46:50] fiery indignation when i start preaching
[46:51] on this
[46:52] all the pride and all the swelling great
[46:54] swelling words of vanity people accept
[46:56] today
[46:58] brother ramsay you want to get closer to
[46:59] god he said humble yourself more
[47:02] he said say he said say i there's so
[47:04] much i don't know instead of how much i
[47:06] know
[47:07] that's he said that's how you get close
[47:08] to god
[47:09] humble yourself
[47:11] don't tell everybody how much you know
[47:13] he said go with the attitude of how much
[47:14] more i want to learn about god
[47:21] okay i'm going to skip down and close
[47:22] with that here i had a whole lot but i'm
[47:25] i'm not going to get to all that see i'm
[47:26] not going to get out
[47:30] let's look at a few quotes from brother
[47:31] brahma and we'll take it back to the
[47:32] bible
[47:33] yeah go to he go to hebrews 11 hebrews
[47:35] 11.
[47:37] we'll close with this thought
[47:39] i mentioned it earlier just you know
[47:40] because it was on my mind and in my
[47:42] notes here
[47:43] hebrews 11
[47:46] right at the end of the new testament
[48:01] go down to verse 35 hebrews 11 35
[48:05] it says women receive their dead raised
[48:07] to life again these are the hall of fame
[48:09] of faith
[48:11] believers from the old testament
[48:14] and others were tortured not accepting
[48:16] deliverance when have we ever been
[48:17] tortured for the faith
[48:20] yeah we have my battles but that's not
[48:21] the same as physical torture
[48:24] that they might obtain a better
[48:26] resurrection
[48:27] in other words when they were being
[48:28] tormented they had the choice do i want
[48:30] to be resurrected with the believers or
[48:31] do i want to be resurrected and judge
[48:34] and go to hell
[48:35] that was their test
[48:37] verse 36 and other had trial of cruel
[48:39] mockings and scourgings
[48:41] yay moreover a bonds and imprisonment
[48:43] see how many of you have gone to jail
[48:44] for your faith just for being a
[48:45] christian none of us have
[48:48] verse 37 they were stoned which one of
[48:50] you have had stones thrown at you
[48:52] physically to kill you
[48:54] they were sawn asunder they were cut
[48:56] with sauce till they died
[48:58] cut in pieces isaiah was cutting pieces
[49:00] till he died
[49:02] yes
[49:04] they were tempted they were slain with
[49:06] the sword they wandered about in
[49:07] sheepskins and goatskins being destitute
[49:09] afflicted tormented of whom the world
[49:12] was not worthy amen
[49:15] they wandered in deserts and mountains
[49:17] and dens and caves and these all having
[49:19] obtained a good report through faith
[49:21] received not the promise
[49:23] in other words they didn't receive the
[49:24] baptism holy ghost and they didn't
[49:26] receive the rapture
[49:28] god having provided some better thing
[49:30] for us that they without us should not
[49:32] be made perfect
[49:34] let's stand to our feet
[49:35] you can come
[49:40] let's look at this quote from other
