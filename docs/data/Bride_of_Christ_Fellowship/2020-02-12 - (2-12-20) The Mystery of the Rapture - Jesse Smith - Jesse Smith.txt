God's Word like use it deeply let's go to first Corinthians chapter 15 as you see by the title kind of had a just waiting in the the balances here to preach on the rapture mystery kind of goes along with the book I'm writing this is a chapter I finished a while ago but I like to have preached down through the chapter and then see about the inspiration that comes to me if I want to add anything else or willing to it I'll be taking it from a perspective as it's new to people and then trying to use as much scripture as we can by God's grace so maybe it Lord willing it'll feel like little Bible study I like to look at this thought here tonight first Corinthians chapter 15 verse 51 and 52 first Corinthians 15:51 and 52 all right let's read let's read fifty one together and then I'll read 52 here at the house 51 all of us in the children on three one two three behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed I'll read verse 50 to myself in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed that's that one more word of Prayer if you have a need on your heart to make it known unto God let's have weird they were grateful to be gathered here Lord through livestream father we ask God that your Holy Spirit would bless us here that we could receive your word rejoicing and father claimant quoted as a promise Lord God and knowing that Lord will either be changed while we're living or changed as the dead in Christ so Lord that's a great promise and father we believe that with all of our hearts Lord God quicken your word to us afresh sure tonight in Jesus Christ's name no reason amen god bless you I'll try to set our timer so we can be timely here tonight Lord willing also brother Jose it has to be one time recently too to look at the the order of kind of the body change so Lord willing at the end of the service or the end of the teaching here tonight I'll stop and do that and read some quotes and then show the the related scriptures that show the order of the body change and we know it's a great thing where Paul says he's showing us a mystery what a blessing too to be able to know a mystery straight from the Apostle Paul and in the book this will be the last chapter out of the twelve mysteries this will be the last one and I think it was very fitting that it would be the last one because the rapture is the last event of the Gentile dispensation so we know the New Testament right now is given over to the Gentiles of course there's a few Jews there's a remnant in every age just like in Paul's day Romans 11 says there's a remnant according to the election of grace so even in Paul's day all the way up to today there are a small group there always has been a small group of Israelites who had their eyes open to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we're filled with the Holy Ghost they're called the remnant of Israel those who can receive Christ now the rest were blinded the rest of the nation were cut off and the Bible says we were grafted in the Gentiles were grafted in to the holy tree so I think this is very fitting to be the last of the mysteries because it is the last event we believe also it is the literal happening of the seventh seal because there's only seven seals and we know they're given the open book and when it's it's open it's given to the Gentiles according to revelation 10 11 is taken to every people a nation and kindred and tongue Gentiles so this is a mainly a Gentile event but as we said it dude does include a remnant so it's the final event of the Gentile dispensation and as you know immediately after the Gentile rapture God cuts off the Gentile people from having access to the baptism of the Holy Ghost at that moment he grafts back in Israel and they get to hear two prophets preached to them the same message we believe right now that Jesus Christ is the Messiah don't do great signs miracles and wonders so much so that we believe those two prophets will be literally Moses and Elijah because they're described as having the same ministries as revelation 11 teaches but let's get back to the rapture it's the unknown day an hour that Jesus Christ seek early and physically comes back to earth he doesn't touch the earth though because the Bible says we will see Christ in the air so as he descends he stops in the middle of the air and he doesn't touch this sin soaked earth and there he receives his bride what we would call their wedding day praise God so we know the rapture is our wedding day it's the day that the Bride of Christ physically is given to the groom the other bridegroom rather and so when the bride comes face-to-face with the groom we know that's the wedding day praise gods that's what we're living for most events in life the happiest are the wedding days right and the birth of children but God has designed his his Redemption story the climax of it would be the rapture of the New Testament church the wedding praise God and we know he has a marriage supper and a honeymoon and then he has a future home which is the happily ever after praise God so that's what we're describing tonight the rapture and I'm sure this would be good for our young children as well and a good review about the Scriptures for the adults so specifically it's called a rapture I'm sorry so the rapture is called a mystery in 1st Corinthians 15:51 specifically called a mystery and we know that the mysteries of God are all to be finished according to revelation 10 7 that just excites my heart to know that if Paul calls something a mystery and I am someone who knows the revelation of the mystery that excites me because I see that I'm part of prophecy being fulfilled in other words I'm not on the outside looking in trying to understand the mystery I'm on the inside I know a revelation in this revelation of a mystery the mystery of a rapture and it's by God's grace it's an open invitation to all but it's wonderful to be a part of that to know that we are a part of the fulfilling of revelation 10 7 the mysteries are finished and then they're taken around the world it's a great blessing to know that praise God now God is currently fulfilling the prophecy of Revelation 10 11 by sending apostles and evangelists all around the world teaching the revelation of the rapture mystery and of course all the other mysteries as well but these are all part of the finished mystery of God and they're all being taken and preached around the world right now we're happy to do our part but as I've said before I'm sure many people have this desire at some point I desire to take the revelation of the mysteries overseas myself by God's grace in fact I've got another email today from a brother and Kenya asking me when are you going to come and preach these revelations to us as I said well now's not the season the Paul said I'll come to you at the convenient season and I can see this is a season of my life to Shepherd my family to Shepherd or the Saints and Akron I believe there will be a season Lord willing that I can take the revelations God has revealed to us through his prophet and now here through the the fivefold ministry more even more scriptures all the same revelation just more scriptures and I'd like to take it around the world to fulfill revelation 1011 let's just read a since I keep mentioning it revelation 10 11 revelation 10 1 to 7 is the open book of the seven sealed book coming down to earth verse 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets so all the prophets the Old Testament looked for a time when God would reveal all his mysteries like for example you think of Ezekiel you know and you think of Isaiah and I say I said a virgin shall conceive and Isaiah said there'll be a new heavens and a new earth Ezekiel said dead bones will rise and the breath of God will come into them well really that hasn't happened yet that's the 144,000 and then Ezekiel said a new heart a new spirit and then my spirit speaking of the three works of grace these are all mysteries these are all great things that they were looking forward to coming to pass but the Bible says in Revelation 10 7 there's a time when all these mysteries are made known and they're finished praise God and then they're finished because the book is open the mysteries are made known and then it's taken around the world verse 11 and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings now we know John himself couldn't accomplish that because he was already 92 95 years old at the time of this vision on the Isle of Patmos so this was speaking of a spiritual John a spiritual group that way at the end time will eat the revelation of the open book and then prophesy and take it around the world so we're happy to be fulfilling that I'll say like this we're prophesying again in this nation amen fulfilling verse 11 where it says and nations praise God we're happy to do that by the grace of the Lord now next though as you know the word rapture is not in the King James Bible but many of us use it because it's a it's a common term that we all can understand like we like yesterday we were at the middle school and even these middle schoolers understand from the movie left behind or the book series left behind every they know even living in Christian homes they know there's going to be a taking away of God's people at some point we believe we have the true revelation of that but a lot of people that know anything about God or the New Testament or Jesus Christ know there's going to be this momentous future event where God is going to take his people away and we just refer to it as the rapture the scripture word is caught up which means a snatching away quick snatching away in the Greek another name you might call it if people don't want to use rapture they can call the catching up experience or they can call the first resurrection that's what it's called a Revelation 20 verse 5 you can call the rapture the catching up or the first resurrection there's other names you can use now something argue that we shouldn't use it and some people even will say like like we say since the word Trinity is not in the Bible we shouldn't use it but that's not exactly the right thinking because with the rapture the definition of the event is in the Word of God but with the Trinity neither the the word or the definition is in the Bible the Bible never says God is three persons so it can't be that and in fact last week church I heard I don't know if I shared this with you or not but the group that one of the groups that left the message now believes God is three persons and they asked a friend to describe it and they described the Godhead as three persons and they said maybe person isn't the best word so they said three minds now to me that was really surprising they believe in one God who has three different minds but yet one God not to me that would be a great confusion like a God that had three different minds would be very confused because we the Bible says we must have a sound mind I know that speaking of humans but we're in the image of God and so see that's just one example when people leave the revelation of the hour they will go too far extremes they will go to our erroneous extremes trying to understand God and it will always be wrong because they'll add their own words but we are to be the group that stays with the word of God we only say what the word says we live by every word we do not add to the word of God and I just want to share that just as a warning to someone also has encouragement to us to stay with the word it doesn't even make sense to say God has three minds but does make sense to say God is manifest as father he his father manifests himself in the flesh as a son first Timothy 3:16 and then the manifestation of the Holy Spirit and first Corinthians 12 is given to every man to profit withal so we can say God is one God in three manifestations we can say that because that's not a man's word or it's not a denominations word that's a word of st. Paul praise God that's part of Paul's doctor so I just want to share that that there is a difference between Trinity and rapture because rapture definition is right in the scripture now what's the confusion in the book I'm starting with a little introduction and that's the introduction I just talked about and then I have to show this is a book of revelations of mysteries I have to first show what is the confusion about the rapture so the confusion about the rapture centers around when it will occur most people admit there will be a rapture most people can see that in 1st Thessalonians 4 and first Corinthians 15 most people can admit that I know there are small groups that believe the rapture already took place and they're wrong I mean you could say Jesus's rapture already took place that's true you could say the Saints the Old Testament that were resurrected with Jesus were then raptured to heaven you could say that raptures already taking place but you can't say that the rapture of the dead in Christ has happened yet the one that Paul was talking about even twenty or thirty years after Jesus ascended and went to heaven there was he was looking for a future rapture that hasn't happened yet and it would be the first resurrection not the second resurrection it would be a separate resurrection a separate rapture so the confusion is when will it occur most Bible students as you could read online well leave it'll be one of three different future times somebody even will either be pre-tribulation or in the middle of the tribulation or at the end of the tribulation so the rapture is always connected to tribulation and that's because the Bible speaks of judgment falling right after the tribulation I'll try it right after the rapture okay so the Bible speaks of Sun and destruction so let's go to that first Thessalonians 5 verse 1 let's go there and just show you that now first ice loadings for 13 to 18 is the rapture then verse 1 says but of the times and seasons brethren you have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that's the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night now that's perfectly describing the catching up the snatching away as a thief would snatch away something in the night verse 3 for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape so the rapture comes like a thief in the night then write for that sudden destruction I think I read this a few weeks ago we're told to watch your prey and verse 6 we're not children of the darkness will not be will not be surprised by the rapture because we'll know the season of the rapture but verse 9 is what we look at for God hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ amen so we can't say the sudden destruction will come upon the raptured Saints because the Bible said we're not appointed to wrath were appointed to salvation or deliverance praise God so that's the confusion now there's a so there's three groups there that believe that anything pre-trib mid-trib or post-trip but I do want to say there is a small group that says the rapture has already taken place we know for sure it's not happened yet and it's still a future event because pause last letter before his martyrdom Paul condemned those who said the rapture was passed already saying their false doctrine was overthrowing the faith of some that's in 2nd time 2nd Timothy 2 17 and 18 Paul condemned them because they were saying the rapture was already taken place so Paul said their false doctrine was like gangrene there's like a flesh-eating virus so we know false doctrine eats away at people's spiritual lives and when they teach and believe false doctrine it opens the door to sin and the evil spirits and if not repented of instead of growing in grace they're gonna grow in unbelief or grow in a growing sinful habits so Paul also wrote in Titus saying Christians should deny worldly lusts in this present world looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the Great God and Savior Jesus Christ in Titus 2 12 and 13 this is the glorious event Saints were still looking for 2000 years later praise God the appearing of Jesus Christ so there's also confusion about who will be in the rapture is it for everyone on earth there's people that believe that everybody will be raptured or is it for a smaller group a faithful spirit spirit-filled group of remnant Christians so I believe you'll find the scripture will answer these questions the scripture takes away all confusion the scripture shows the rapture is a pre-tribulation event and it's only for the Holy Ghost filled Saints those who have the born-again experience the baptism of the Holy Ghost [Music] praise God now let's go back if we can the 1st Corinthians 15:51 let's read verses 53 and 54 to get the full understanding here now we read verses 51 and 52 for our text notice we're all changed our bodies are all changed not everyone will die corn numbers 51 not all Christians have to die but all Christians will be changed when they'll be changed at the last Trump now we'll get to that a little bit how there's a shout voice Trump that's a crucial part of the revelation of the rapture there's three phases to the rapture of the shout voice and Trump verse 52 says the rapture happens so fast happens in the twinkling of an eye just back dry and that's how fast the rapture will take place so children will we have time if we're not ready what we have time to have a long prayer meeting to get ready for the rapture yeah no you just have to be ready you just have to be sealed you just have to have oil like the parable of the ten virgins you just have to have it ready you don't have time to go and try to get more oil or you have to have the oil ready you have to be living in the victorious power of the baptism of the Holy Ghost you got to be living more than a forgiving life you have to be more than justified if to be more than sanctified you have to be filled with God's Holy Spirit praise God and if they have that oil in your soul the Holy Spirit in your soul ready to leave in the moment of the twinkling of an eye verse 53 actually let me read fit to 52 again in the moment wink of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall put on incorruption and this mortal shall put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory praise God let's go back and read that the children you know which prophet said that Paul is quoting a prophet who mentioned the rapture this was about 900 800 years before Jesus any guesses those Isaiah let's go to Isaiah 25 Paul is quoting Isaiah I shared that this week with a good friend it's amazing how the paul quotes isaiah where when we read isaiah 25:8 try to imagine you're a jew and see you see if this scripture reminds you of a rapture a body change let's actually start at verse 6 and in this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things a feast of lines on the leaves of fat things full of marrow of lines on the leaves well refined just speaking of a great festival right wine festival verse 7 and he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people and the veil that is spread over all nations so this is a feast where all nations will have the veil taken off now the Bible talks about that in Corinthians Paul says right now there's a veil over Israel and they can't recognize Christ but he said when they see Christ that veil is taken away so this is speaking of a time when all nations will have the veil taken away verse 8 he will swallow up death in victory so this is what Paul is quoting and the Lord will wipe away tears from off all faces and the rebuke of his people shall be taken away from off all the earth for the Lord has spoken it now children just by reading those three scriptures you see you read anything about a trumpet sounding no.32 anything about shouting no so see God hid the rapture scripture in this Jewish scripture this is what I was telling the brother God hid a Gentile scripture in a Jewish scripture because God loves to hide things from the eyes of the wise and prudent but reveals them unto babes such as would learn this just looks like a feast it looks like a feast after all nations have been saved and everything that all we're just coming to Israel to have a feast and it may be that it may be that because it sounds like that it speaks of a holy mountain and it speaks of all nations having a great feast it looks like the Millennium right it looks like or we say even maybe the future home one of those but here in the middle of adversity he says he shall swallow up death and victory and then Paul says death will be swallowed up in victory so we can clearly see children that in our bodies is death right you all don't feel it yet wait to get my age wait to get to be an adult then you'll start feeling death I can't jump as high or run as fast as I used to I can't lift as many weights as I used to I can feel it I can feel I'm getting weaker not as fast I'm not getting I used to always get stronger stronger stronger now I'm just getting weaker weaker weaker matter how much I exercise death is in our bodies but the Bible says that the rapture death gets swallowed up in victory that's a great promise that we're looking for not all of us will have to go to the grave some of us will have our death inside of our bodies swallowed up in eternal life so I just want to share with everyone that's where the rapture scripture comes from hidden in there just like the resurrection of Jesus Christ was hidden in Psalm 16 at the very at this second half of the verse in Psalm 16 where David said he'll not leave my soul in hell neither will he let my body see corruption praise God the greatest event that ever happened the resurrection of Jesus Christ pinin in one scripture in Psalm 16 he received the same thing the same type of thing God hiding his revelation inside of a scripture that even goes to the Jews praise God now let's go to first Thessalonians 4:15 first item is 4:15 let's read 15 through 18 for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord so this is a Paul prophesied some person disagree with me recently and and said that Paul wasn't a prophet and this is what I mentioned Paul says this is by the word of the Lord I just read it earlier today in 1st Corinthians 7 Paul says this is I speaking speaking of marriage and divorce but then he says now this is I not the Lord and other times he says we say this by the word of the Lord so the same thing is true for our prophet brother Branham there be times he'll say his opinion but there's other times he says this is not me this is the will of the Lord and so that's how you have to operate with every prophet you have to recognize when God speaking or when man is speaking so Paul says clearly this is the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God there's a Trump that Paul mentioned earlier in 1st Corinthians 15:51 and 52 and the dead in Christ shall rise first so we know more about the order here dead Christians their bodies are gonna rise first before our bodies are changed and we believe if this rapture is anything this resurrection is anything like Jesus resurrection then we believe we'll see the dead in Christ rise first according to Matthew 27 the Bible said the Saints in the Old Testament that resurrected with Christ were went to the city of Jerusalem and were seen by many after Jesus's resurrection so we believe the Lord willing that we'll see the resurrected Saints now if we saw that what our faith be low or would our faith be high our faith would be extremely high and then we would feel oh this is the rapture season we would we would not only just have the word we would have spiritual supernatural experiences to base our faith upon right and so that's that's what we believe that that's what we believe will be the faith of the father's restored right because the early fathers they saw Jesus Christ resurrected to the nut they saw a dead man raised again and he was alive and he would come there in the room he disappeared he come and disappeared and that raised their faith and raised her face so much that they would be crucified for Christ so I believe our faith of our faith has to match the original Saints God will give us those same experiences we'll see the dead raised again and that will help raise our faith to produce or to be ready for the rapturing grace for the changing of a moment and a tweet coming I believe that will be part of the latter rain in other words when God's anointing is falling upon us we'll reverse ship and rejoice but we'll also because that anointing will see the dead in Christ rise as well and the reason we'll have the ability to see them is because the Holy Spirit will give us eyes to see praise God amen hallelujah so that's why Jesus said ask of me for the ice out and I'll give you that ice out praise God amen now verse 17 then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore comfort one another with these words everybody no matter how many times you heard about the rapture you ought to be comforted by hearing these words read tonight I'm comforted my children you should be comforted for a Scott because we know Christ will bring all those that were in him in the Holy Spirit baptism go bring them back with him and we'll meet them in the air and you have to worry about will I recognize them or not you won't worry about that because you will recognize them the anointing of the Holy Spirit will be upon you and that's proven in Matthew 17 because Peter James and John member went up into a mountain to pray did they wonder who was talking to Jesus or did they know right away they knew Peters like we know Lord there's Moses and Elijah did they ever see those men alive on earth no how did they know it was the anointing of the Holy Spirit let them know praise God so see we don't have to worry about anything God is the one who's gonna accomplish the rapture and isn't gonna be you and is that gonna be our effort it's gonna be God's leadership in the rapture it's gonna be God's grace in the rapture we're just going to keep walking one day at a time just like Enoch but then one of those days will be the last day that'll be the day we walk close with God God sends that latter rain and that will cause it so annoyed us to see the dead in Christ it annoyed us to be able to be ready for that last Trump so our bodies can be changed in a moment and a twinkling of an eye praise God praise God thank you Jesus so we want to be caught up together with them in the clouds and we won't have to wonder who they are we'll know who they are because Peter James and John knew them men that lived I think it was they lived 1,500 years Moses was 1,500 years before Christ and Elijah was I believe nine hundred eight hundred years before Christ so there's no way Peter James and John could have known them they had have known them by the Holy Spirit praise God wonderful so now after reading these scriptures now you know who will be in the rapture there's two groups of people that will be in the rapture the dead in Christ and the living Christians the dead in Christ were the Holy Ghost field Christians who died over the past 2,000 years this group is resurrected first in immortal bodies Paul said the dead shall be raised incorruptible and they rise first John correctly describes the rapture as the first resurrection because the dead in Christ are being resurrected right they're actually being resurrected from the dead the living Christians of the group Lord willing we hope to be a part of if God chooses that we live to see the rapture this group will be changed from mortal bodies to immortal they'll be like Enoch and Elijah the only two people who never had to die everybody else had to die Paul says the bodies are swallowed up in victory now this is the group that received the oil of the baptism of the Holy Ghost or eternal life during their lives and they're called wise virgins in Matthew 25 1 to 13 by Jesus Christ so those are the only two groups that will be in the rapture of the dead in Christ the dead Christians Holy Ghost field and then the living Holy Ghost field Christians and that's why the Bible calls the baptism Holy Ghost a mystery in Colossians chapter 1 verses 25 to 27 he said the mystery that was hid from ages Paul calls it a mystery he said that mystery is Christ in you the hope of glory praise God now this might be shocking to some but the rest of the entire world population which is a huge population right because right now we're getting close to I think either seven or eight billion people on the earth might be closer 8.now so the rest of the world population who denied Christ as unbelievers and also along with the foolish version who didn't have the oil ready to go they'll have to suffer and die during the tribulation period or at the Battle of Armageddon and they'll miss the one thousand year millennial reign with Christ now the foolish version our virgin right to the word they they don't they don't try to marry the world they stay living a life separated unto the Word of God but they're just missing the oil they're missing the baptism of the Holy Ghost so they missed that thousand-year millennium because they were foolishly avoiding getting a closer deeper walk with God they didn't want the full walk with God they stopped short of having a really deep and sincere loving walk with God revelation 20 verse 5 explains us the Bible said the rest of the Dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished that's an important major Scripture when it comes to the revelation of the the rapture the rest of the Dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished so the bodies of the rest of the world population the foolish virgin remained the graves according to Jesus and after the thousand-year millennium though be raised for their judgment at the great white throne judgment which is called the second resurrection and that's found in Matthew 25:31 246 and revelation 20:11 215 now I believe the souls of those foolish virgin go to the heavenly dimension to wait for the resurrection and I believe they go under the altar just like the saved blinded Jews go under the altar according to the fifth seal okay because we know the Jews under the altar don't do not have white robes okay which represent eternal life they can't go to hell because they lived faithful they had a testimony they had the testimony of keeping the Word of God well the foolish version has a very similar testimony they kept the Word of God they were virgin to God's Word to what they knew but they were just foolish to going further into the baptism of the Holy Ghost so that's where I believe the foolish virgin goes because I don't see how they can go down because Jesus took paradise up from the heart of the earth he changed paradise from Abraham's bosom the heart of the earth and I believe he took it up near the throne of God because remember in heaven there's one altar spoken of in heaven and that's the altar of incense and that's spoken of in numerous scriptures but there's one altar of incense in heaven and if there's an altar of incense then Hebrews the sixth chapter I believe says there's also a veil in heaven there's a very similar setup as it was in Moses tabernacle as there is in heaven there's an altar of incense a golden altar it's got four horns on it the Bible says and then there's a veil and then there's must be Christ's throne right there and so the Bible says our hope is behind the veil it's entered in behind the veil in the holiest in heaven so I believe by God's grace the foolish virgin and the the faithful Jew are there under the altar of incense in heaven because I do not believe they could go to hell's prison house if they're indeed virgin now let's look at as we get ready to finish up here you got about 20 more minutes by God's grace let's look at that word caught up again in 1st Thessalonians 4 17 this word supports a pre-tribulation rapture it's the Greek word harpazo which means to cease to carry off by force to claim for oneself eagerly to snatch out or away so that means the rapture is Jesus eagerly seizing or snatching away his bride his wife so that he may take these Christians to heaven or the father's Kingdom with him for a wedding in the sky followed by a marriage supper praise God so at the very same moment so simultaneously simultaneously his Christ snatches away his bride takes in the heaven the inhabitants of the earth are left behind and go through a temporary torment and judgment sudden destruction the Bible calls it for their sins in the great tribulation period for rejecting the gospel now there are six reasons let me go through these six reasons I'll just go through them quickly so the children know there's also a video on YouTube of this that I have that lays out there's six reason the rapture is pre-tribulation so let's kind of hit these and maybe just read one scripture in each one and then after that I want to show just a quick order of the rapture and then we'll be finished up here tonight by God's grace I hope you're comforted tonight praise God God's Word is such a comfort praise the Lord so the first reason the rapture has to be a pre-tribulation cuz now when we looked at the when when is it and who is it for we we looked at the who is it for now when is it it has to be before the tribulation the first reason is the Great Tribulation is described as trouble for Israel the foolish virgins and sinners but not for Holy Ghost filled Christians Holy Ghost filled Christians are already washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and do not need any purifying they don't need any purging they don't need any trouble because all their troubles have been washed away by the precious blood of Christ amen now where do we get this word trouble it's from Daniel 12:1 it literally says there's a time of trouble and notice it's for Daniel's people or thy people Israel so knowing the trouble Israel must endure teaches us Jeremiah 30 verse 7 is speaking of the same event so Daniel caught it trouble and Jeremiah calls it trouble he calls it Jacob's trouble in Jeremiah 30 verse 7 both clearly reference Israel ok Daniels people now the foolish virgin experienced trouble because there's two parables Jesus tells about Christians having trouble the first one is the foolish versions being locked out of the marriage in Jesus's parable of the the parable of the ten virgins in Matthew 25 verses 10 and 12 10 11 and 12 they missed the marriage supper spoken of in revelation 19:7 they missed the marriage in the parable which is the marriage supper according to revelation 19:7 because they didn't have the oil or the baptism the Holy Ghost and that's taught in a Zechariah chapter 4 where the Bible says not finding the might not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord how are those two olive trees causing the light to burn it was through the oil and God said that's my spirit saith the Lord a second parable is Matthew 22 verses 10 through 13 it describes those invited to a marriage but don't have a wedding garment which represents the Holy Ghost baptism because Jesus said you'll be clothed or endued with power in Lu 24:49 and noticed these without the the wedding garment are cast into outer darkness with weeping and gnashing of teeth that has to be the tribulation period so C so the tribulation is trouble for Israel and now we've seen two scriptures where it's trouble for the foolish virgin that didn't have the born-again experience sinners get the most trouble because Jude 1:15 says the tribulation is going to execute judgment upon all that's Jude 1:15 so it's a great time of trouble it's a great time of judgment executed upon the unbeliever reason number two there's no mention of Christ's bride or church in the Great Tribulation text in the book of Revelation the word church appears 19 times in Revelation but it's absent from revelation 3:20 2 - revelation 22:16 the the church is not mentioned in revelation 8 during the four trumpets or revelation 9 during the fifth and sixth trumpets and the first woe when the second woe passes in revelation 11 the bride is not mentioned during the final harvest of Revelation 14 there's no mention of the bride there's no mention of the bride in Revelation 15 and 16 when the seven last plagues and seven last vials are poured out the reason Christ's bride is not mentioned in those tribulation texts is because she's with her bridegroom Jesus Christ in heaven enjoying the three and a half years of the marriage supper of the Lamb thank God for that the next time the bride is seen in the book of Revelation once she's seen a couple times she's seen in Revelation 10 but she's still doing her earthly ministry she's seen in revelation 6 with the first four seals because she's got the anointing of the first I was heard of the four beasts yeah that surround the throne of God but after those times the next time she's seen is in Revelation 19 verses 5 to 21 she is the army that's riding white horses behind God's own son who is the leading one right there at the Battle of Armageddon which takes place at the very end of the Great Tribulation Period reason number 3 the brighter true church is specifically promised a pardon from God's divine wrath we already read that in 1st Thessalonians 5:9 there's numerous other scriptures all of them point to Jesus's bride escaping wrath so the other scriptures that say that our first Estonian is 5 4 1st Thessalonians 1:10 Romans 5:9 revelation 3:10 all of those scriptures say that the true church escapes wrath and tribulation thank God for that Luke 21:36 says the same will be accounted worthy to escape all those things that shall come to pass David also says will escape he said in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion and the secret of his tabernacle he shall hide me and set me up upon a rock the word wrath is used 13 times in Revelation and each time it's connected to the great tribulation text listed under the second reason brother Branham uses the symbolism of a physical husband like myself with a physical husband like myself ever put my wife through a time of purging or great persecution in order just so we could be married of course not that's because she's already found grace in my sight already love her already know she's as a pure heart so it is with Jesus Christ his bride is already washed in his blood through repentance and sanctification the batson Holy Ghost she doesn't need to go through a tribulation period to be purged or go through trouble because she's already confessed her sins all the wrath of Christ has passed and she stands before her husband with no condemnation because she is in Christ Jesus she's already found favor in his sight the Bible causes a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing in Ephesians 5:20 7 praise God we're called blameless harmless without rebuke in Philippians 2:15 Jesus blood forgives all of our trespasses in Colossians 2:13 hallelujah Christ wife has no condemnation and no man shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect corner Romans 8:1 and 833 Christ bride is the wife of his own choosing and Christ chooses a bride who is blameless without spot wrinkle or blemish praise God that got 10 minutes left here and I'll finish up here reason for the true churches foreshadowed to receive a pardon from God's divine wrath we see three examples of this Enoch who is namings dedicated in Hebrew was raptured and he didn't taste death the Bible said he walked with God he was not for God took him he was the seventh generation from Adam which is a type of the seventh Gentile church age called the Laodicean Church in Revelation chapter 3 so like Enoch escaped the wrath of the flood of Noah's day so will the seventh church age escape the destruction the worldwide destruction of fire won't be water this time it'll be fire this time alright now there's two other scriptures that speak up believers escaping the wrath of God Noah escaped the wrath of God and then lot escaped the right wrath of God so we see all righteous people escape the wrath of God another parable of Jesus oh yeah the parable rear efference of jesus shows that we escaped the wrath of God as well if we have the wedding garment according the parable of the wedding garment we escape the outer darkness and then the parable of the ten virgins we escape the trouble or the the tribulation of being outside the marriage house in Matthew chapter 25 as well okay reason number five almost ever two more to go Jesus and Paul taught the rapture was eminent at an unknown day just like an approaching thief so in other words we don't know the day or the hour but all the other views can could calculate the exact day where it might take place Jesus taught this on four occasions and Paul taught it twice Jesus said no man knows the day or the hour no not the Angels but my father only later in the same chapter Christ said this that if the good man of the house had known in what watch the thief would come he would have watched it would not have suffered his house to be broken up therefore be ye ready for in such hour as you think not the Son of man cometh that means we must make every hour an hour where we think the Lord may come back that will make us ready for the coming of the Lord Matthew 25:13 is another one where Jesus says watch you therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh in Revelation 3:3 jesus says if therefore thou shalt not watch I will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee so that's quite striking five times Jesus says that we don't know the day or the hour meaning we have to be ready at all times Paul twice says Christ comes as a thief in the night first Thessalonians 5 verses 2 & 3 part 2 through 4 Paul says it twice that he comes as a thief now the mid tribulation which is a false view of the rapture and the post tribulation rapture which is another false one they could potentially count or number the day of Christ's coming the mid Tribulation Period could just count 1260 days in order to figure out when the rapture would be because that would be the halfway point of in your period and of course the post tribulation people would have to double that to have seven years of days and if they counted all those days then they could know the day of Christ's coming see the rapture must remain a secret for two reasons Satan could do great damage if he knew the timing of Jesus's Second Coming just think about the awful things they did the Devils did at Jesus first coming they knew the time of his first coming so what did they do they anointed Herod and he slew all those poor precious Hebrew boys right from two years old under so that's why Jesus has to hide that day an hour from Satan because Satan could do great damage he would try to stop people from being raptured and secondly a seeker rapture reveals good and evil hearts according to Jesus's own words he said a good faithful wise servant will be ready for the rapture and he'll be serving spiritual meat in due season but the evil serpent or evil servant rather he behaves as though the raptures delayed he starts getting into it we call a spiritually drunken state so a real Christian has the love of God in their hearts motivating them to be ready at any time or season for Christ's company all right in the last one here before we do the order the sixth reason the rapture is the removal of the grace of God for Gentiles in preparation for the Antichrist and this has taught multiple scriptures Romans 11 mostly teaches this and second Thessalonians 2 2 to 13 so let me stop there because I need a couple minutes here to go through the order by God's grace I'll stop there but let's look at one more scripture one more little order here so here's the order brother Jose asked me to preach this and I hope this is the right one brother Jose if not forgive me and let me know which one it was now here's what brother Ram says in who is this Melchizedek he said therefore the theophany if you have died and entered in that theophany speaking the dead in Christ he says what happens the theophany comes down to the earth to pick up the Redeem body so that when the dead in Christ rise first they rise because that theophany comes down and it picks up that glorified body but the glorified body is the dead body of the saints that was swallowed up in life so it's a resurrected life but then that theophan has to come down and meet the glorified body and then those with the three bodies the dead in Christ now alive in Christ they'll rise right we'll see them but that happens first the theophanies have to come down to get the glorified and the natural body that's now swallowed up in the glorified body that's the first thing that happens he says and then if you're here in the air you take the body to meet the theophany there you are and caught up to meet the Lord in the air so I'll just go real slow as I close here first Christ descends from heaven the Bible said the Lord himself shall descend in 1st Thessalonians 4:16 so the Lord himself shall descend and first the dead in Christ rise first there theophanies descend and they join up with the physical body and the glorified body of course the glorified swallows of the physical first and then the theophany and glorified all unite into one body and then Lord willing we'll see them in our physical bodies right and then we'll stop seeing them because they'll race with Jesus in the air and then the Bible says at the last Trump now that Trump already sounded rights because that's when the dead in Christ rise after we see them we which alive and remain shall be changed in a moment and caught up to meet the Lord in the air so our physical bodies get swallowed up in a glorified body so we'll go from feeling tired and maybe you know worn out or something instantly having a brand new body no more pain and then this glorified body will rise to meet our theophany in the air praise God and once that happens the scripture will be fulfilled death will be swallowed up in life and then first Thessalonians 4:17 comes the past so shall we ever be with the Lord praise God remember there's three kinds of bodies there's terrestrial or flesh bodies the ones we haven't see now this is called the earth the house of our tabernacle there's the second theophany body which is called a celestial body it's waiting for us it's an eternal body waiting in the heavens it's a house not made with hands and it's our house from heaven yet it doesn't eat it's a very similar to an angelic body that the Angels have and then the third body is a glorified body which is this body glorified or made eternal or perfect and then that glorified body can eat and drink as well just like Jesus's body could eat fish after his resurrection and brother Branham says through those three bodies so once you have the understanding of those bodies he says we see plainly through those bodies you plainly see the complete secret of our lives not in journey and death and where we go after we die so those three bodies tell the whole story of our lives physical body right theophany waiting but then this body's got to be swallowed up in a glorified and meet that theophany and then those three bodies combine to one and then we are ever with the Lord so that's such a beautiful quote there he says the state ages of eternal purpose he had in a secret has now been revealed these three stages of our bodies what a great revelation and we'll stop right there so children let's stand here let's that word prayer here Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for tonight we thank you for the word that we heard Lord it's a little bit of review but Lauren we're comforted
