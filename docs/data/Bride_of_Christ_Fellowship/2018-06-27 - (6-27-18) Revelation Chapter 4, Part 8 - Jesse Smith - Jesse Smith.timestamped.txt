[18:55] [Music]
[19:08] praise the Lord Amen let's take a few
[19:10] prayer requests and announcements here
[19:12] by the grace of the Lord okay let's do
[19:19] an ounce monsford by God's grace I don't
[19:23] know if you saw it but there was about
[19:25] 25 postcards returned that were
[19:28] undeliverable to this zip code it was
[19:31] sent to the for for three one two zip
[19:33] code the church's nip code missed minute
[19:35] darden and there's about 25 so it's
[19:38] about two percent out of the twenty five
[19:39] hundred we're not deliverable so they're
[19:42] out there on the prayer request table
[19:43] you can take a take as many as you want
[19:45] pass them out I've only passed one out
[19:47] so far so I meant to pass them more out
[19:49] by God's grace but they're free to pass
[19:51] out so there's they just got that yellow
[19:53] sticker on the back they were I guess
[19:55] there was no one living at that location
[19:56] where they tried to deliver so that's
[19:59] the first announcement a second I
[20:02] believe next Wednesday is July 4th so
[20:04] the children were concerned about
[20:06] fireworks so I may shorten song service
[20:10] a little bit next Wednesday so we can
[20:12] get out a little bit earlier we'll see I
[20:14] for example like they might have
[20:16] fireworks on when or I'm sorry on
[20:18] Tuesday or Thursday I don't know so I
[20:20] know that children care about that it's
[20:22] kind of like Father's Day you know and
[20:23] Mother's Day like I usually cancel
[20:25] second service I'm not gonna cancel
[20:26] service but I'll probably let out a
[20:28] little earlier by God's grace we'll see
[20:30] we'll see how it turns up but I do want
[20:33] to be mindful I know the kids love that
[20:35] it's a special day for them anyways we
[20:38] may end up low early okay I'll be that's
[20:41] the only announcements prayer requests I
[20:44] got numerous prayer requests here
[20:47] brother bender rod asked for prayer
[20:49] requests he traveled out to Trinidad no
[20:51] I'm sorry Africa today
[20:54] Africa I forget which country was it
[20:55] remember what it was anybody remember
[20:57] was it Congo yeah it was a Congo okay
[21:00] thank you I can't remember and then I
[21:02] think his next trip is Trinidad so
[21:04] anyways he asked for prayer so let's
[21:06] pray for brother Ben Simon Randy and
[21:08] Esther are still in Thailand so let's
[21:10] pray for them a third request a woman
[21:14] named I'm sorry say her name
[21:16] I shouldn't say her name but anyway she
[21:19] asked me would you pray that I would
[21:21] overcome wearing earrings and I said yes
[21:23] I'll pray for that so we'll pray for
[21:25] this unspoken I should not have said her
[21:27] name forgive me I said her name but she
[21:30] don't go to this church so this I don't
[21:31] think it's an embarrassment but anyways
[21:33] I got to be careful she wants to
[21:35] overcome earrings so she saw our YouTube
[21:37] videos and she emailed me and she said I
[21:40] want to be in the rapture where you
[21:41] prayed I can get over earrings I said
[21:43] yes we'll pray for that the last one is
[21:46] I just saw this today one of the Supreme
[21:49] Court justices are stepping down let's
[21:52] pray that a judge will be appointed in
[21:54] there that will get rid of abortion
[21:57] because there's how many thousands of
[21:59] lives are taken every day because of the
[22:03] Supreme Court ruling so it's just on my
[22:05] heart to pray that I don't know if it's
[22:06] possible but Christians want to get rid
[22:09] of as much sin as possible remember the
[22:12] Bible said Christians are supposed to
[22:13] sigh and cry for any abominations done
[22:15] murder is absolutely an abomination so
[22:18] it's been a prayer on my heart for years
[22:20] to get rid of abortion since they
[22:22] started it in the 70s or late 60s rather
[22:25] so let's just pray that was just on my
[22:27] heart I don't know if it's possible but
[22:29] I know with God all things are possible
[22:30] so those four requests any other
[22:33] requests this evening by God's grace
[22:35] Haven okay yeah we'll pray for them by
[22:42] God's grace any other prayer request

[38:56] branham's this was the sermon where the
[38:58] pillar fire came down and made the seven
[39:01] different shadows for the seven
[39:02] different Church ages a three hour and
[39:05] three minutes sermon from the time he
[39:08] took the pulpit to the time they stopped
[39:10] recording it he was there at the
[39:11] standing at the pulpit for three hours
[39:13] and probably longer cuz that a prayer
[39:15] meet what an amazing amazing message man
[39:19] thank God for the Word of God so
[39:21] revelation 4 verse 6 and before the
[39:27] throne there was a sea of glass like
[39:28] unto crystalline in the midst of the
[39:30] throne and round about the throne were
[39:32] four beasts full of eyes before and
[39:33] behind and the first beast was like a
[39:35] lion and the second beast like a calf
[39:37] and the third beast had a face as a man
[39:40] and the fourth beast was like a flying
[39:41] eagle let's all read verse eight if we
[39:44] can one two three and the four beasts
[39:47] had each of them six wings about him and
[39:50] there were full of eyes within and they
[39:54] rest not day and night saying holy holy
[39:57] holy Lord God Almighty which was and is
[40:02] and is to come

[40:04] you have a need on your heart just make
[40:05] it only to God as we bow our heads
[40:07] Heavenly Father this is your holy word
[40:09] Lord this was a we'd say a red-letter
[40:12] day for your prophet this was a day
[40:15] where you came down and put your own
[40:16] stamp of approval on the church ages
[40:19] Lord God and now into the fourth chapter
[40:23] Lord we thank you Lord God for your
[40:25] grace and mercy Lord it means so much to
[40:27] us to the world they laugh at it they
[40:29] say it never could have happened but
[40:31] Lord we know it could happen because the
[40:33] word has been vindicated to us Oh God
[40:36] the word we received is a perfect word
[40:38] it's a pure word and father the life the
[40:41] Prophet lived in front of us lo God on

[40:46] Christian life dear God we thank you
[40:48] Lord for the sweetness of the Holy
[40:49] Spirit we feel tonight we will cherish
[40:52] the old rugged cross we will cherish the
[40:55] blood of Jesus our minds picture each
[40:58] one of us clinging to that cross as
[41:00] blood is poured down that cross and our
[41:03] tears pouring down our eyes in our faces
[41:06] o God
[41:07] we will forever cherish the cross it
[41:09] will be our crown it will be our reward
[41:12] it will be our treasure Oh God it'll be
[41:15] our trophy that old rugged cross Oh God
[41:18] thank you for your son oh God thank you
[41:20] that he came to die for us to redeem us
[41:22] Lord destruction we give you all the
[41:26] glory in this endtime Lord inspire us
[41:29] anoint us with that flying and go noin
[41:30] ting that we heard last week O God that
[41:32] we can fly high above the cares of this
[41:35] world and the things of this world we
[41:37] thank you for in Jesus Christ's name and
[41:39] the church said Amen god bless yous be
[41:41] Necedah praise the Lord
[41:46] well I'm gonna try to be mindful the
[41:48] time tonight just like like I said next
[41:50] week you know is July 4th I don't know
[41:52] if everybody heard it but we'll try to
[41:53] be short next week so the kids can see
[41:55] the the fireworks Lord willing we'll try
[41:59] to be a little shorter and so see if you
[42:02] want I can preach longer the next Sunday
[42:04] so if I shorten Wednesday I can just go
[42:06] a little longer wait if that upsets
[42:08] anybody it's ok with me I'm ok you know
[42:11] it's like with Mother's Day and Father's
[42:13] Day you know I'm okay with that
[42:15] but we'll see we'll see how it goes so I
[42:19] listen to the rest of this read through
[42:21] the rest of the sermon this morning as
[42:23] we're us preparing so brother Brandon
[42:26] gives us a little more information on
[42:27] the cherubims and how they guard God's
[42:29] throne so we'll look at these remaining
[42:32] thoughts here and I'll try to be mindful
[42:34] of time by the grace of God so remember
[42:37] again brother Branham cause these four
[42:39] beasts or living creatures rather he
[42:42] calls them throne guards because they're
[42:44] guarding the throne in heaven and we
[42:47] know if there is directions in heaven if
[42:49] there is they would be moving from east
[42:52] to west because that's the same
[42:54] direction they move when they would
[42:56] approach the Holies of Holies and as the
[42:59] Moses or Solomon or even David David had
[43:02] a temporary tabernacle in Jerusalem as
[43:04] well not as great of course as Solomon's
[43:06] but temporary and so bro Graham said
[43:09] guarding this gate he said Cain and Abel
[43:10] came up here to worship so now bro Bram
[43:14] talks about the gate and the how the
[43:15] there was a altar on earth and days of
[43:18] Cain and Abel so it must have been
[43:21] that they guard so when Cain and Abel
[43:23] came to worship there must have been an
[43:25] altar there must have been a throne is
[43:27] that right these cherubims and another
[43:29] thing notice here's another evidence
[43:31] Cain went out Cain went out from the
[43:33] presence of Lord from the gate at the
[43:34] garden so the presence the Lord must
[43:36] have been at the altar and the altar was
[43:40] at the gate and brother madam says glory
[43:42] it's God's dwelling place at his altar
[43:45] now Cain went out from the presence of
[43:47] the Lord from this place you want to put
[43:48] it down it's Genesis 4:16 so remember
[43:52] when Adam and Eve were kicked out there
[43:54] was still a gate and there were still
[43:56] cherubims guarding the gate to the way
[43:58] of the Tree of Life while Cain and Abel
[44:00] must have been when they made their
[44:02] altar they must have approached coming
[44:05] from the east heading west
[44:07] they must have approached the throne of
[44:09] God amen which would have been an altar
[44:11] where there would have been cherubims
[44:13] the program tells us this so this is
[44:15] kind of the most modest picture I could
[44:17] find I'm sorry about the there showing
[44:19] off a little bit of skin there I hope
[44:20] that won't cause any sisters of stumble
[44:21] if so let me know I won't use it next
[44:23] time so here is a skis coming West
[44:27] they're facing the west because they're
[44:30] coming from the east and they're coming
[44:32] in the Friends of God so there must have
[44:33] been the cherubims or maybe at that
[44:35] point perhaps but must've been a gate
[44:37] and must been the Tree of Life brother
[44:39] Branham tells us so we see again another
[44:42] example of there's throne guards
[44:44] guarding the way back to the Tree of
[44:47] Life amen buh-bam tells us that and so
[44:51] next and remember so remember they were
[44:52] in the east they had to go through the
[44:54] eastern gate and they're heading west to
[44:56] the holiest of holies so again adamant
[44:58] I'm sorry Cain and Abel Adam and Eve
[45:00] anyone who was approaching this gate
[45:02] this eastern gate where the cherubims
[45:04] were they would have been coming the
[45:05] same direction it was a place of worship
[45:08] how many glad that you have a place of
[45:10] worship today praise God you don't have
[45:12] to go to a physical Church although we
[45:14] do worship here Church our authors in
[45:16] our heart amen
[45:17] and everywhere we go we can worship
[45:19] Jesus everywhere we go amen you can have
[45:21] an altar on your job altering your home
[45:23] you have an altar and giant eagle you
[45:25] can have an altar wherever you want to
[45:27] list up the Lord amen because it's a
[45:28] it's changed now now it's in the heart
[45:31] of man amen
[45:32] now by medicine Moses
[45:34] take it up into heaven take it up from
[45:36] the earth and having an assault the
[45:38] altar of God is that right each I'm
[45:39] trying to prove my point here y'all you
[45:42] know what I'm trying to do don't you
[45:43] he went through the presence of God he
[45:45] descended and when he descended from the
[45:47] presence of God God told Moses make
[45:49] everything on earth as pattern after
[45:51] heaven is that right now when he did
[45:53] when he made the Ark of the Covenant he
[45:55] put two Chairman's to guard the ark see
[45:57] what it is
[45:58] it was the altar the throne guards so
[46:01] now wrote em says there's two more
[46:04] guards as well the two chairman's he
[46:07] said mold them out of brass and put
[46:09] their wings touching like this because
[46:11] that's exactly what he saw in heaven
[46:13] that's exactly what John saw in heaven
[46:15] these four cherubims on the four sides
[46:18] of the Ark of the throne in heaven they
[46:22] were the guards of the Ark cherubims
[46:25] guards at the mercy seat now I'm not
[46:27] sure why Moses saw only two by the
[46:30] throne but John saw four I don't I
[46:32] looked in some quotes I didn't find the
[46:34] revelation so if you know it tell me
[46:36] after service I like to hear
[46:38] but the main point brother Rams making
[46:40] is that there are throne guards wherever
[46:43] God's throne is there's a guard to the
[46:45] throne that's the point brother bands
[46:48] making here now you remember the Bible
[46:50] said thou shalt make two cherubims of
[46:52] gold beaten work shalt thou make them in
[46:54] the two ends of the mercy seat and make
[46:56] one cherub on one end and the other
[46:58] cherub on the other even the mercy seat
[47:00] how you make the chair bones on the two
[47:02] ends thereof and the cherubim shalt
[47:04] stretch forth their wings on high
[47:06] covering the mercy seat with their wings
[47:08] and their faces shall look one to
[47:09] another toward the mercy seat shall the
[47:12] faces of the cherubims be and now shall
[47:16] put the mercy seat above upon the ark
[47:18] and in the ark thou shall put the
[47:20] testimony that I shall give thee I love
[47:22] this and there will I meet with thee and
[47:25] I will commune with thee from above the
[47:28] mercy seat from between the two cherubim
[47:32] which are upon the Ark of the testimony
[47:34] of all things which I give thee in the
[47:37] commandment unto the children of Israel
[47:39] praise God so God was saying I'm going
[47:42] to meet you between the two cherubs amen
[47:45] and again brother am says
[47:48] he has thrown guards now what's
[47:49] interesting is in the holiest there was
[47:52] thrown guards but remember outside the
[47:54] tabernacle the tribes were thrown guards
[47:56] as well that's interesting
[47:58] I don't know what the revelation is
[48:00] behind that but God had two sets of
[48:02] thrown guards he's gonna preach it later
[48:04] and he's gonna share this as well the
[48:06] the the tribes were four guards and then
[48:09] when he got into the holiest of Holies
[48:11] Aaron or the high priests brother Aaron
[48:14] he had throw cards there as well and God
[48:18] said that's the place I'm going to
[48:20] commune with you is under the blood I'm
[48:22] sorry above the blood amen that's where
[48:25] I'll talk with you I'm gonna meet with
[48:27] you in one place and that's where the
[48:29] blood of the Lamb is shipped amen
[48:31] aren't you glad you can worship under
[48:32] the blood of Jesus tonight
[48:34] amen not a natural lamb but as a lamb
[48:38] that was in the Lamb of God in heaven he
[48:40] was natural but now he sits on the
[48:41] throne of God with a glorified body amen
[48:44] hallelujah and there he is sprinkling
[48:47] the blood and there's the guards to the
[48:49] throne where the RAM tells us now he
[48:52] says this now they guard the mercy seat
[48:55] when God is initially kind of glory
[48:57] where was a shiner she kind of glory at
[48:59] the mercy sees that right they guard
[49:01] that Shekinah glory he said woo listen
[49:04] friends then it goes to show that every
[49:07] scallywag can't come there and take of
[49:10] that he says you've got to be prepared
[49:13] before you come into the presence of it
[49:16] let me believe that so just like Aaron
[49:19] here had to be prepared he had to be
[49:21] washed he had to be clothed he had to
[49:24] have the blood the people had to be
[49:25] forgiven that before you had to be
[49:27] prepared he had to go through all the
[49:29] preparations
[49:30] buh-bam says that's how we are with God
[49:32] and so I'm going to extend we're halfway
[49:34] through the year so I'm going to
[49:35] cordially invite everybody to come pray
[49:37] 30 minutes before services because I
[49:40] invited everybody back in January I'm
[49:42] inviting everybody again if you want to
[49:44] come I believe it's the best way for us
[49:46] to be prepared to come into the presence
[49:48] of God let me believe that but it takes
[49:51] a sacrifice it takes time to learn my
[49:53] family's been doing it for eight months
[49:54] now it took a little struggle we got it
[49:56] good for Sunday but I'm still working on
[49:58] it for Wednesday because there's just so
[50:00] much pressure in the week and I've got
[50:01] overcome that and I'm quoting it and I'm
[50:03] quoting that my prayer closet I'm
[50:05] quoting this in my prayer closet I'm
[50:07] returning to my first love that's what
[50:09] I'm quoting I quoted this morning my
[50:11] prayer closet I'm returning and God's
[50:13] going to help me return all the way amen
[50:15] so remember I preached this before but
[50:18] we have three witnesses that we should
[50:20] pray before we hear the preaching or the
[50:22] say at the Lord during the preaching
[50:24] service it's Joshua 6x is 27 and mark 11
[50:27] let's go through them remember when they
[50:30] when they were surrounding Jericho the
[50:32] Bible said it came to pass when Joshua
[50:34] spoken the people that the seven priests
[50:37] bearing the seven trumpets of rams horns
[50:39] passed on before the Lord everybody
[50:41] knows that the message the worship comes
[50:43] before the preaching right and they blew
[50:47] with the trumpets and the Ark of the
[50:48] Covenant Lord found them but a lot of
[50:49] people don't know this verse 9 and the
[50:52] armed men went before the priests that
[50:55] blew the trumpets most people don't know
[50:57] that right and the reward came after the
[51:02] ark and the priests going on and blowing
[51:04] with the trumpet so most people know
[51:06] this most people know the priests with
[51:07] the horns went before the ark
[51:09] but a lot of people don't know before
[51:11] the priests the Bible said you had armed
[51:13] men that had armor are you with me
[51:17] church amen
[51:19] that word armor don't forget that word
[51:21] armor because the Bible said we put on
[51:22] the hole and once you have the armor on
[51:26] what do you do oh the whole time you're
[51:28] praying always with all prayer and
[51:30] there's the six pieces I told you
[51:33] remember six is a good number when
[51:34] you're a Christian one two three four
[51:36] five six there are six pieces you put
[51:38] them all on and then someone who's fully
[51:40] armored with the sword of the Spirit and
[51:42] the shield of faith they're ready to
[51:44] pray all the time amen that's what I'm
[51:46] saying there's a witness in the Bible
[51:48] that our men we're ready to fight they
[51:51] have the armor of God on they go before
[51:53] this the singing which is the prayer the
[51:56] prayer before the service which can be
[51:59] done in your home or here but I'm
[52:01] inviting everybody that's thought we can
[52:02] do it here if we want to by God's grace
[52:03] I know if it encourages me when I see
[52:06] people here on their face and praying
[52:07] and crying out to God reading their
[52:09] Bibles before service don't you love
[52:11] that Amen when people are being prepared
[52:13] for thus saith the Lord I think that's
[52:15] beautiful
[52:15] but with something we all got to grow
[52:17] into we got to grow into that now here's
[52:20] the second witness the Bible said and
[52:21] thou shalt command the children of
[52:23] Israel that they bring the pure olive
[52:25] oil beaten for the light to cause the
[52:27] lamp to burn always in the tabernacle of
[52:30] the congregation without the veil which
[52:32] is before the testimony Aaron and his
[52:34] sons shall order from evening to morning
[52:36] before the Lord it shall be a statute
[52:38] forever unto their generations on the
[52:40] behalf of the children of Israel so the
[52:43] lamp only burned if the people brought
[52:46] beaten oil from their homes how many
[52:49] believe that Amen the ministers the
[52:52] priests couldn't do any work they
[52:54] couldn't have any light in the holy
[52:56] place unless the people brought the oil
[52:59] with them to church amen and you Eve
[53:02] I've got to do it my wife's got to do
[53:04] we've all gotta do we've all got to pray
[53:06] before church and bring in anointing
[53:08] with us to church
[53:10] it's scriptural no light from the seven
[53:13] churches let me say this the Holy Ghost
[53:15] light for Laodicea won't shine here
[53:18] unless we bring the oil right because
[53:21] the oils for the light for the
[53:23] candlesticks so the Holy Ghost anointing
[53:25] for the bride of Jesus Christ living in
[53:27] Laodicea
[53:28] they need to bring oil if the priests
[53:30] are going to work with that oil and
[53:32] produce light amen oh it's so true you
[53:35] know it you know it the more times you
[53:37] come prayed up before service the better
[53:38] service is amen hallelujah and then you
[53:42] add fasting with that it gets even
[53:44] better but that's grace but we know we
[53:46] have to be led into that as well now
[53:48] this is a newest one to me and they
[53:50] brought the Colt to Jesus this was on
[53:52] the Sunday before the crucifixion here
[53:56] good no sorry a Palm Sunday and they
[53:59] brought the cult of Jesus and cast their
[54:01] garments on him and he sat on him and
[54:03] many spread their garments in the way
[54:05] and others cut down branches of the
[54:08] trees and strawed them in the way and
[54:10] they went beef and they that went before
[54:13] and they the followed cried saying
[54:15] Hosanna blessed is he that cometh in the
[54:18] name of the Lord this is just like
[54:20] Jericho you have people worshiping
[54:22] falling down worshiping shouting
[54:25] praising worshiping before the Ark
[54:27] Jesus Christ was the Ark amen and so you
[54:31] have people worshiping before falling
[54:33] down and putting their palms putting
[54:35] their palms on the ground right putting
[54:37] their palms on the ground praying before
[54:40] service are you with me you can see all
[54:43] these types in the Bible though prayer
[54:45] and worship and the palms and the
[54:46] sacrifice always goes before the
[54:49] anointed word all we need to be a church
[54:51] is dedicated to prayer amen and I said
[54:54] this before that's one thing I feel like
[54:55] our church can learn if that if we're
[54:57] not learning anything else which we
[54:58] should be but if we're not that's one
[55:00] thing we should be able to learn is to
[55:01] pray more to pray more before service
[55:04] amen so see we have to be prepared for
[55:07] the prints of the Lord it's all through
[55:08] you know Joshua it's all through it's
[55:11] all through the scripture Moses bring
[55:13] down to Jesus day you always have to
[55:14] have worship and praise and preparation
[55:16] before getting in the presence of God
[55:18] glory now I want to bring this out to
[55:21] you just to encourage us look at byron
[55:23] says how many ever sigh and cry for the
[55:25] abominations done in Akron or your
[55:27] family or your friends
[55:30] he said the sign cry for the
[55:32] abominations that's in the city where
[55:34] mother said where do you see that now
[55:36] suppose I know Naomi's visit other
[55:38] churches lately I spent a while since I
[55:40] visited a church but think about the
[55:42] last time you visit a church did you see
[55:44] anybody sighing and crying for the
[55:46] abominations brother Branham hadn't for
[55:49] a while so he said where do you see that
[55:52] because memorize Eko 9 says it those who
[55:56] are sighing and crying for the
[55:57] dominations are the ones who won't get
[55:58] slayed but RAM said I can show you
[56:01] 10,000 people that speak in tongues and
[56:08] to one ten thousand to one that that's
[56:11] really burdened for sin don't get me
[56:15] wrong we should be burdened for gifts
[56:17] I'm burdened for gifts I'm burdened for
[56:18] more of the Holy Ghost that's part of
[56:20] the reason why I come to pray you know
[56:21] before service but look brother I'm
[56:23] saying here that can't even pray an hour
[56:27] but did you know the Bible said to mark
[56:29] only those who side and cry for the
[56:31] abominations of the city how am I never
[56:32] read it sure that was the Holy Spirit
[56:34] come forth to mark the people and said
[56:36] the destroying angel go forth and
[56:37] destroy everything that doesn't have the
[56:39] mark upon them and the MA
[56:41] of God is the Holy Ghost is the seal of
[56:42] God now I love this now where is them
[56:47] people that's that interested how many
[56:52] people are that interested brother have
[56:54] said to come and pray and sigh and cry
[56:56] for the evil that's done in this nation
[56:58] the evil has done in this city the evil
[57:01] has done in our families so see
[57:03] sometimes Church we just love how the
[57:04] Lord is just directing us back to what's
[57:06] most important what's most important is
[57:09] sighing and crying for the abominations
[57:11] being burdened for sin and asking God to
[57:13] deliver because he that wins Souls is
[57:15] wise that's what the Bible says and
[57:19] that's the point I just want to linger
[57:21] on a little bit you know we and I've
[57:25] seen this before I've gone to special
[57:27] meetings you know and and people are
[57:29] getting saved and baptized but I wonder
[57:31] you know if you go back in a few years I
[57:33] wonder how many of those people that got
[57:35] saved and baptized that the special
[57:37] meetings or the Easter meetings or or
[57:39] whatever meetings a family camps
[57:40] whatever they are I wonder how many of
[57:42] them really haven't experienced with
[57:44] Jesus that they love Jesus so much that
[57:47] they continue to pray before all their
[57:49] services in their home church and
[57:51] because they're so interested in God and
[57:53] when seeing God save somebody who's that
[57:57] interested that's what mother I'm saying
[58:00] here who is that interested that we have
[58:02] to be prepared to come in the presence
[58:04] of God and I preached on this over and
[58:06] over but it's another reminder for us we
[58:09] need we all need reminders can you say
[58:11] Amen we all need reminders but man says
[58:13] I can show you people that jump up and
[58:15] down and cry in the church I can show
[58:17] you people that shout and run all over
[58:18] the building I can show you people that
[58:19] prophesy and it comes to pass I can show
[58:21] you those who speak in tongues and run
[58:22] up and down the buildings and say things
[58:24] that actually interpret and it comes to
[58:26] pass but where is that person that sighs
[58:30] and cries for the abominations that's
[58:32] did in the city where is that burden
[58:36] soul you could turn some new leaves on
[58:39] that see what I mean in that powerful
[58:43] where's the people that are that
[58:45] interested in coming in the presence of
[58:47] God that they'll come in they'll sigh
[58:50] and cry and they'll they'll say god save
[58:53] sinners Oh God
[58:54] just hate the seed like I said earlier
[58:56] abortion abortion just breaks my heart
[58:58] and and homosexuality breaks my heart I
[59:01] just want to see people delivered from
[59:03] that see that's the kind of desire that
[59:05] we all need a men and I believe it's in
[59:08] each one of us but we got a stirred up
[59:10] we got to refresh it by God's grace we
[59:13] got to bring it back to the the surface
[59:16] of our lives because that's what a real
[59:20] Christian desires that's what he's
[59:22] interested in and then when I was
[59:24] talking about gifts in the church and he
[59:25] said then you brethren should be just
[59:27] and the key word I'm looking at here is
[59:28] interested you brethren should be just
[59:31] interested in getting your ministry in
[59:33] the place in the house of God as the
[59:36] pastor isn't getting his because it's
[59:39] just essential that you do it so
[59:42] preparation for church shows how
[59:44] interested we are in it we've got to
[59:46] become more interested in the Word of
[59:47] God we got to be more interested in
[59:50] getting the oil to church bringing the
[59:51] oil getting finding our place what's my
[59:54] position in the church or what can I do
[59:56] in the church that's what we should be
[59:58] very interested in about is if I
[59:59] understand I say all that with love of
[1:00:02] God in my heart I know I got to just
[1:00:03] keep repeating it because just the
[1:00:05] vision number the vision of our church
[1:00:07] is the restoration of the original
[1:00:09] church and the original church got
[1:00:11] together every day they prayed they had
[1:00:13] miracles they had communion all the time
[1:00:16] they were always together that's the
[1:00:18] vision ax2 is the vision of where we're
[1:00:19] going we're going back to that before we
[1:00:22] go up that's the prophecy we're going
[1:00:24] back to that remember that original
[1:00:26] church will be restored he said it's the
[1:00:28] saying the Lord
[1:00:29] but she won't stop there Pentecost
[1:00:31] because she'll take a rapture after that
[1:00:33] amen but we the church has got to go
[1:00:35] back to the beginning and I know it may
[1:00:38] be a vision I know the rapture may be 10
[1:00:40] years off maybe 5 maybe 20 maybe 30
[1:00:43] maybe 40 I don't know how many years the
[1:00:45] rapture is off but I know the vision
[1:00:48] that we have is to become more like the
[1:00:50] book of Acts amen and that church that's
[1:00:53] fully restored we'll take a rapture
[1:00:55] that's exactly the scripture that's and
[1:00:57] Bob Arum said thats thus saith the LORD
[1:00:58] that is I preached on that numerous
[1:01:00] times so you know that examples of the
[1:01:02] throne guards so now if other Branham
[1:01:04] has given us six examples of throne
[1:01:06] guards
[1:01:08] the cherubims at the Tree of Life when
[1:01:09] Adam and Eve got kicked out Cain and
[1:01:11] Abel at their altars or Thrones it was
[1:01:13] the same gate where Adam and Eve got
[1:01:15] kicked out the two cherubs at the ark in
[1:01:18] the days of Moses and the the Ark of the
[1:01:20] Covenant the four sets of tribes around
[1:01:22] the Ark we'll look at that again tonight
[1:01:23] that's kind of the next thought we're
[1:01:25] gonna look at the four living creatures
[1:01:27] that John saw and then the four
[1:01:30] cherubims that Ezekiel saw so can
[1:01:32] everybody see this is a true teaching
[1:01:34] all the way down through the Bible God
[1:01:36] always protects his word and at the end
[1:01:39] of this service I believe you understand
[1:01:40] why he's got to protect his word I'm
[1:01:42] trusting by the grace of God so but I am
[1:01:45] reviewed the mercy seat is in the heart
[1:01:47] now we know the mercy seat is there's a
[1:01:50] mercy seat in heaven we know that but
[1:01:52] God wants to work on mercy seats on the
[1:01:54] hearts of the people in other words God
[1:01:55] wants to save all this children that's
[1:01:58] that's the hour we're living in right
[1:01:59] now our hearts our souls our
[1:02:01] representations of the throne of God and
[1:02:04] that's the throne God's working out
[1:02:05] right now trying to sit upon the throne
[1:02:07] of every heart of every believer amen
[1:02:10] but I said now the mercy seat the mercy
[1:02:14] seats in the heart the seat where the
[1:02:16] shining forth of his glory and all his
[1:02:18] children amen the Shekinah glory in the
[1:02:20] human heart here's the human heart is
[1:02:22] that right is that the mercy seat how do
[1:02:24] you come through into that through these
[1:02:26] different systems through self will self
[1:02:30] will comes into here and there through
[1:02:33] there comes out what she kind of glory
[1:02:35] what is she kind of glory is God's
[1:02:36] presence and when a man's walking or
[1:02:39] woman's walking he's reflecting this
[1:02:41] should kind of glory so one of the
[1:02:43] goodest thought program again here's the
[1:02:45] ears there's the Holy Place heading in
[1:02:47] the holiest of all ways I added this
[1:02:49] that's that you can tell the words are
[1:02:50] different the font is different on these
[1:02:52] all the other ones were you know from
[1:02:54] the picture I borrowed online but the
[1:02:56] veil above them keeps saying this veil
[1:02:58] is yourself will and brother have said
[1:03:01] this throne is on each one of our hearts
[1:03:03] and we've got to come through the we got
[1:03:06] let God come through the veil of our
[1:03:08] self will we have to let God tear our
[1:03:11] will right we got to say not my will but
[1:03:14] thy will be done and then when we say
[1:03:16] God take all my life and there are the
[1:03:19] veil of ourselves
[1:03:21] every and every day we got to keep doing
[1:03:23] it right we got to do it to forgot to
[1:03:25] get into the baptism Holy Ghost and
[1:03:27] every day we got to die daily and
[1:03:29] haven't be a living sacrifice unto Jesus
[1:03:31] so by me I'm saying again the veil is
[1:03:34] self-will if we want to live from here
[1:03:37] if we want to see Christ more in our
[1:03:39] lives we've got to make sure this veil
[1:03:41] is rent and we got to make sure that
[1:03:43] it's not all well being done but we're
[1:03:45] doing what Christ wants us to do Laurie
[1:03:48] just thought I'd review that that's a
[1:03:50] good thought I love that thought so beau
[1:03:53] graham says when you really got the veil
[1:03:54] rent he said you don't go into gambling
[1:03:56] dens you don't carry on and go out there
[1:03:59] and deny the word so he thought so see
[1:04:01] when you've really gone beyond the veil
[1:04:03] you don't deny the word in your daily
[1:04:05] life every day in your life you
[1:04:07] acknowledge the word you do the word
[1:04:10] you'll read the word that proves the
[1:04:12] veil this the veil of self-will has been
[1:04:15] rent and God's will is being done and
[1:04:17] you're walking in the Shekinah glory of
[1:04:19] God oh yes he said no matter what people
[1:04:24] says he's got his heart set on one thing
[1:04:26] God amen and if he's truly caught of God
[1:04:31] then Jesus Christ reflects himself
[1:04:33] through him with the Shekinah glory
[1:04:34] doing the same things he did back there
[1:04:36] manifest the same gospel preaching the
[1:04:38] same word saying we're being made
[1:04:40] manifest and the same measure was then
[1:04:42] just like it was at Pentecost it's
[1:04:45] measured back again oh my oh thank you
[1:04:48] Jesus amen
[1:04:49] now brother Aaron breaks in this thought
[1:04:52] of Israel camp with four throne guards
[1:04:54] he gets into a more detailed no doubt
[1:04:56] most of you have heard this before but
[1:04:58] bear with me I think it gets it gets
[1:05:00] better I think by God's grace program so
[1:05:03] once you notice this is beautiful he
[1:05:05] says oh my let me get over here and skip
[1:05:07] some minister I can get down to this get
[1:05:08] your pencils now he says maybe I better
[1:05:10] make that a little smaller now Israel in
[1:05:12] their journey when they can't watch us
[1:05:14] they can't one two three four and he's
[1:05:17] counting on the blackboard behind him
[1:05:19] now on the east side I'll put it down
[1:05:21] east the east side was always Judah the
[1:05:25] gate Judah Judah was the head of three
[1:05:27] tribes with the banner on the west side
[1:05:30] he says was Ephraim three tribes within
[1:05:34] Efram on the south side was Ruben three
[1:05:37] tribes and their banner on the north
[1:05:39] side was Dan Dan with three tribes and
[1:05:41] three tribes and their banner now here's
[1:05:45] where the Bible says it in numbers two
[1:05:47] verse three on the east side was the
[1:05:49] camp of Judah so this is all scriptural
[1:05:52] and there's a point I'm going through
[1:05:53] this I'm not doing this to be smart I'm
[1:05:56] doing this to show you this is why the
[1:05:58] Holy Ghost came to put himself on the
[1:06:01] wall in the seven the seven shadows of
[1:06:04] the church ages because it was proving
[1:06:06] brother Branham was a word based prophet
[1:06:08] that's why I'm doing this so you know
[1:06:11] whether man was even rushing to try to
[1:06:13] get through this service but the Holy
[1:06:15] Ghost was in no rush he knew he was
[1:06:18] going to come amen now I'll tell you
[1:06:20] like this the people weren't in any rush
[1:06:21] or either and I'll show you some quotes
[1:06:23] on that the people they're like okay
[1:06:25] they're like preach about man they said
[1:06:26] one one guy yelled out said preach all
[1:06:28] day preach all day now off the way if I
[1:06:32] hear that any time soon
[1:06:33] I'll have to keep my ears open if I say
[1:06:36] can I go a few more minutes I want to
[1:06:37] hear some brother sister shout preach
[1:06:39] all night brother yes oh my
[1:06:43] maybe we'll grow into that too on the
[1:06:46] left side should be the standard of the
[1:06:48] camp of Ephraim on the south side will
[1:06:52] be the camp of Reuben this is all
[1:06:54] scripture huh that's why I'm taking time
[1:06:55] to show because I want you to know he
[1:06:57] was a word brace prophet on the standard
[1:07:00] the camp of Dan shall be on the north
[1:07:02] side now I love this picture again this
[1:07:05] is to me the most beautiful picture
[1:07:07] because I see God looking down of course
[1:07:09] that's men but God is higher than those
[1:07:12] men and God is looking down and he's
[1:07:13] seeing across traveling and he's taking
[1:07:16] that cross and that cross is symbolizing
[1:07:18] Redemption wherever that cross goes
[1:07:20] there's blessing amen just like today
[1:07:23] wherever the blood of Jesus Christ flows
[1:07:25] into there's blessings for those people
[1:07:27] amen
[1:07:28] and he looks down from heaven and
[1:07:30] there's my there's my Redemption there's
[1:07:32] my group of believers there's a little
[1:07:34] bride there's that little cross and
[1:07:36] Akron amen where they've got the Ark
[1:07:38] there they've got the throne there
[1:07:39] they've got the word there and I've got
[1:07:41] my angels there as well amen
[1:07:44] I've got my throne guards guarding the
[1:07:46] Lord that's being preached accurate amen
[1:07:49] God always guards his word that's a
[1:07:53] beautiful picture remember even a man
[1:07:55] that went to hell Balaam was up there
[1:07:56] and said all that's beautiful you're
[1:07:57] beautiful like a unicorn a star arise
[1:08:00] out of Jacob even a man who went to hell
[1:08:02] couldn't deny the beauty of God's
[1:08:04] artistic ability right here to draw a
[1:08:07] cross in the wilderness only man God is
[1:08:11] so great
[1:08:12] amen brother Anderson now what was then
[1:08:17] dan was the eagle now we got to prove
[1:08:20] he's by the Bible this is Dan is the
[1:08:22] only challenging one really to prove by
[1:08:24] the Bible that Dan represents eagle
[1:08:26] because when jacob bless him jacob said
[1:08:28] you're gonna crawl around like a snake i
[1:08:30] remember that and so a lot like believe
[1:08:32] the sign attacks brother branham and
[1:08:34] they say all see you know the Bible said
[1:08:36] Dan was a snake he's not an eagle but
[1:08:38] you got to dig a little deeper than that
[1:08:40] you got to dig a little deeper in the
[1:08:42] scripture for that and history because
[1:08:44] every Jewish encyclopedia other thing I
[1:08:46] looked at two or three today every
[1:08:48] Jewish encyclopedia I read said that Dan
[1:08:51] had the standard of an eagle not a
[1:08:53] serpent you think God's church would
[1:08:56] have marched around like just just with
[1:08:57] the serpent now they did watch her on
[1:08:59] with a serpent on a pole
[1:09:00] but that represented that sin was
[1:09:02] already judged and that they were
[1:09:04] forgiven amen
[1:09:05] that sin was crucified hallelujah you
[1:09:07] know sins been crucified amen
[1:09:10] thanks to the old rugged cross
[1:09:11] hallelujah amen now I found this online
[1:09:16] and there's the website it was I thank
[1:09:18] God for that website because I was
[1:09:19] really having a hard time finding that
[1:09:20] Dan representative evil but I like what
[1:09:24] the Jewish website said in relation to
[1:09:26] the Eagle being associated with the
[1:09:27] tribe of Dan
[1:09:28] we note that Dan means judge that's a
[1:09:31] good idea right there that's beautiful
[1:09:34] Jacob said your judge that's not the
[1:09:37] mother of Dan when she when he was born
[1:09:40] ember she said God has judged me
[1:09:42] remember that might have been Leah or
[1:09:43] Bildad I came right which one us he said
[1:09:45] God has judged me and given me a son so
[1:09:48] dan means judge and the symbolism of an
[1:09:51] eagle is often connected with judgment
[1:09:53] that is beautiful right there so if you
[1:09:56] got your Bibles I don't have the
[1:09:57] scripture here let's turn your
[1:09:58] I was there let's go to the one in I
[1:10:02] read a couple today that were pretty
[1:10:05] easy to understand let's go to
[1:10:08] Deuteronomy 28 49 we'll try that one it
[1:10:14] was really easy to understand how an
[1:10:15] eagle represents judgment Deuteronomy 28
[1:10:21] 49 so I appreciate the wisdom that's why
[1:10:30] the Internet can be a blessing I'll tell
[1:10:31] you it sure can be a curse but it can
[1:10:33] sure be an awesome blessing as well 28
[1:10:35] 49 it says this the Bible says it's 28
[1:10:40] ports are one page way yeah here it is
[1:10:43] the Lord shall bring a nation against
[1:10:45] thee from far from the end of the earth
[1:10:47] as Swift as the Eagle fly ahthe a nation
[1:10:50] whose tongue thou shalt not understand
[1:10:52] of course who is he speaking of Babylon
[1:10:54] amen and God is warning Israel but Moses
[1:10:58] warning Israel before it even happens
[1:10:59] you're gonna get in the Promised Land
[1:11:01] but then you're gonna fall away and then
[1:11:02] God is gonna send Babylon as a eagle to
[1:11:05] judge you and then scatter you around
[1:11:07] all the world some would go down to
[1:11:10] Babylon some go to Syria some would be
[1:11:12] spread even further than that all right
[1:11:14] go to Jeremiah 4:13 now those are the
[1:11:15] two I thought would be a help to you to
[1:11:17] see how an eagle represents judgment and
[1:11:20] the named Dan does mean judge
[1:11:23] Jeremiah 4:13 all right
[1:11:29] behold he shall come up as clouds in his
[1:11:32] chariot shall be as a whirlwind his
[1:11:34] horses are swifter than Eagles woe unto
[1:11:36] us for we are spoiled o Jerusalem wash
[1:11:39] thine heart from wickedness that thou
[1:11:41] mayest be saved
[1:11:42] amen wow what a beautiful portion of
[1:11:44] Scripture remember Jeremiah was one of
[1:11:46] the last prophets that was warning
[1:11:47] Israel before the northern Earth's are
[1:11:49] the southern kingdom was completely
[1:11:51] taken in captivity so you could go
[1:11:53] through other scriptures but those are
[1:11:54] the only two I want to hit and so I
[1:11:56] believe you have enough Bible evidence
[1:11:58] because you have Genesis 49 Dan's the
[1:12:01] judge and you have all these scriptures
[1:12:03] that prove Eagles are associated with
[1:12:04] judgment I believe you can place Dan's
[1:12:08] banner as an eagle and the church said
[1:12:10] but you will not find
[1:12:12] I challenge you look it up you will not
[1:12:13] find a scripture that says Dan is a
[1:12:14] eagle you won't find that but you have
[1:12:16] to put it together with all the other
[1:12:18] scriptures then you find it alright next
[1:12:21] program said Reuben was the man now why
[1:12:23] was he was the man he was the firstborn
[1:12:25] of Jacob he was the strength but like
[1:12:27] water he went up on the couch and
[1:12:29] defiled my couch in other words he lived
[1:12:31] with his father's concubine see that's
[1:12:33] the morals of a human being the animal
[1:12:36] don't have their morals the lion none of
[1:12:37] these things has that but the man does
[1:12:39] run with the next man's wife and so
[1:12:41] forth just the same thing everything is
[1:12:43] completed so Reuben represents a man
[1:12:46] because of his immorality because the
[1:12:49] but this is where the bible quotes
[1:12:51] Reuben thou art my firstborn this is
[1:12:54] Jacob speaking I'm skipping down
[1:12:56] unstable has water thou shall not Excel
[1:12:59] because that when is up to thy father's
[1:13:01] bed then then defiles thou it so he
[1:13:05] represents man so man isn't so low he
[1:13:08] would defile his own father's concubine
[1:13:11] so that's why Reuben represents man
[1:13:15] Judah represents line this is the
[1:13:17] easiest one to see joke have said Jacob
[1:13:20] said Judah is a lion's whelp and then
[1:13:23] all the Jewish historians say yes Reuben
[1:13:25] was a man Dan was a eagle and then Judah
[1:13:29] is a lion so that's their flag is the
[1:13:32] line it's all through the scripture
[1:13:35] Ephraim he says is the ox now this is
[1:13:39] beautiful
[1:13:39] Moses is speaking about Joseph about
[1:13:45] Joseph's yeah his yeah his prophecy
[1:13:48] about him he said his glory the tribe of
[1:13:51] Joseph rather his glory is like the
[1:13:54] first thing I was Bullock and his horns
[1:13:56] are like the horns of unicorns with them
[1:13:58] he shall push the people together to the
[1:14:00] ends of the earth and they are the ten
[1:14:02] thousands of Ephraim and they are the
[1:14:05] thousands of Manasseh because who were
[1:14:06] Joseph's sons Ephraim and Manasseh and
[1:14:08] so Joseph has a connection to the
[1:14:11] Bullock right and so his son who got the
[1:14:14] blessing Manasseh Ephraim Manasseh I'm
[1:14:17] sorry Ephraim was the oldest right he
[1:14:19] was doing but Manasseh got the blessing
[1:14:20] but eat from here was the one that
[1:14:23] spoken of he was the one that was lead
[1:14:25] the other three tribes and so there's a
[1:14:27] connection with Ephraim from the ox or
[1:14:30] the Bullock it's also called the calf in
[1:14:32] the New Testament does anybody
[1:14:34] understand hope you can see that so now
[1:14:36] we have scripture so you know if you
[1:14:38] ever talk to anybody about that you can
[1:14:39] say it's actually it's fully in the
[1:14:41] Bible you can teach this straight from
[1:14:42] the Bible so there's you know just like
[1:14:45] a picture I found on a Jewish web site I
[1:14:47] liked it you know you have Dan you have
[1:14:49] Reuben you have Ephraim and you have
[1:14:52] Judah and they're still like that today
[1:14:54] the original tribes but BAM said just
[1:14:58] exactly the tribes of Israel camped
[1:15:00] around guarding their earthly guards of
[1:15:03] the right to the ark don't you see it he
[1:15:06] said mercy see nothing come here
[1:15:08] anywhere around it without crossing
[1:15:09] those tribes crossing what the lion
[1:15:12] crossing the man the intelligence of the
[1:15:14] man crossing the work horse as an ox or
[1:15:16] crossing the eagle the swiftness of it
[1:15:18] see the heaven the earth in between and
[1:15:21] all around you you see they were guards
[1:15:23] and above it was the pillar of fire hey
[1:15:26] boy think about that if Satan won to try
[1:15:30] to attack the camp of God he's got to
[1:15:32] get through a lion he's got to get
[1:15:34] through an ox he's got to get through a
[1:15:36] man or any enemy you name it though the
[1:15:39] Canaanites the Philistines you name it
[1:15:42] to get to God's presence God always
[1:15:44] protected it with powers and thank god
[1:15:47] we've got the power of the flying eagle
[1:15:48] today amen its power and that's the
[1:15:52] power that's protecting us amen is the
[1:15:55] Holy Ghost power amen that's right God
[1:15:58] always protects his word so I'm just
[1:16:01] adding to the picture so I covered up
[1:16:02] the man over here just so you can see it
[1:16:04] again so there's there's Dan the north
[1:16:06] there's Ephraim the west there's Reuben
[1:16:09] the south and there's Judah in the east
[1:16:11] does that help by God's grace it's just
[1:16:13] simple you know you can find these on
[1:16:14] you know a Google search and everything
[1:16:16] like that I just thought it might be
[1:16:18] handy to see it like that now this is
[1:16:22] one that the brother from the
[1:16:24] Philippines he's a real good preacher
[1:16:26] pastor he's a missionary brother Ron
[1:16:29] malabo I mean I follow him on Facebook
[1:16:30] but this is a picture he made I like it
[1:16:33] you know but it just shows how there's
[1:16:36] the four anointings those four
[1:16:37] anointings around the throne
[1:16:39] I don't know if that's the right picture
[1:16:40] like I said but there are thundering and
[1:16:42] lightnings and there's a rainbow round
[1:16:44] about the throne member because the half
[1:16:45] has not been told there's the seven
[1:16:48] candlesticks there's it's four and
[1:16:49] twenty elders so just another idea
[1:16:52] showing you that there's a connection
[1:16:54] between these four different anointings
[1:16:56] and the throne of God amen now at this
[1:17:00] point brother man is preaching he says
[1:17:02] these words he says now brother now
[1:17:05] here's a brand new one brother listen to
[1:17:09] this then we'll go anybody ready for a
[1:17:11] brand new one no it's probably not brand
[1:17:13] new to you but if you haven't heard in a
[1:17:16] while it'll feel like new okay and
[1:17:18] there's a great there's great
[1:17:20] understanding in this too he says here's
[1:17:23] a brand new one brother listen to this
[1:17:24] he says I was sitting the other day and
[1:17:26] I saw this and I just jumped up and run
[1:17:28] around and around and around the chair
[1:17:30] saying glory to glory glory glory around
[1:17:32] and around
[1:17:34] he said Charlie Hayek worse than I do up
[1:17:37] in the woods sometimes sister Nellie if
[1:17:39] I'd act like that you'd run me out of
[1:17:40] your house pretty quick he said I just
[1:17:43] had a glorious time
[1:17:44] now watch whether it was what the Lord
[1:17:46] did so the Lord did something and Lord
[1:17:49] showed him a revelation so the
[1:17:52] revelation the brand-new revelation that
[1:17:54] God showed brother Branham was that the
[1:17:56] book of Acts is a type of the holiest of
[1:17:59] Holies
[1:18:00] how many heard that before that's the
[1:18:02] brand I was a brand new revelation in
[1:18:04] 1961 I never heard brother had preached
[1:18:06] it before that so it seems really like
[1:18:08] it definitely was he said after
[1:18:12] Pentecost they wrote a book of what acts
[1:18:15] of the Holy Ghost he's that right what
[1:18:17] does the Acts start off with the first
[1:18:19] thing to enter into salvation acts 2:38
[1:18:21] here's the last one around what is it
[1:18:23] they was filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:18:24] began to speak with other tongues and
[1:18:26] Peter stood up and preached them a
[1:18:27] sermon they said what can we do how are
[1:18:30] we going to get that and he said acts
[1:18:31] 2:38 repent and be baptized every one of
[1:18:34] you in the name of Jesus Christ that
[1:18:37] Scripture was so important to me when I
[1:18:38] first heard it I in the old days before
[1:18:40] we had smartphones I had those little
[1:18:42] voice recorders member those voice
[1:18:43] recorder machines you put a little tape
[1:18:45] in and there was like little plastic
[1:18:47] tape I was so fired up when I heard acts
[1:18:50] 2:38 I had my little tape recorder you
[1:18:52] know my to-do list
[1:18:53] and I would drive in the car and I'd
[1:18:55] play it acts 2:38 and Peter saith unto
[1:18:58] them repent and be baptized every one of
[1:19:00] you in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:19:02] remission of sins and you shall receive
[1:19:03] the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:05] I was just list that over and over and
[1:19:07] over because it meant so much to me and
[1:19:09] now I understand why it meant so much to
[1:19:12] me it was the way to God amen it is
[1:19:15] still the way to God today it's the only
[1:19:18] way to God today amen
[1:19:20] it is the hoist of Holy's for the bride
[1:19:23] today ha ha hey man I never knew why it
[1:19:26] meant so much hallelujah but now I know
[1:19:29] he said now remember God has got some
[1:19:32] guards for that mercy seat so if ax is
[1:19:35] the holiest of holies then God has four
[1:19:37] guards around it
[1:19:39] he says Matthew on the east Luke Mark
[1:19:42] and John all their four Gospels
[1:19:44] vindicate the book of acts to come they
[1:19:47] guard it anywhere you want to look at it
[1:19:50] he said just take one he said I got
[1:19:52] twenty or thirty wrote down here but
[1:19:53] let's take one on the subject of
[1:19:55] salvation I'm gonna have time to pray no
[1:19:58] it's one o'clock now they do have time
[1:20:00] to pray later so I guess we won't have
[1:20:02] it unless you want to pray for the sick
[1:20:03] now program said I just got plenty of
[1:20:06] time see a brother says take all day I
[1:20:11] think they started church at 10:30 if
[1:20:14] I'm not mistaken now the reason I think
[1:20:16] that is because the Bible believers
[1:20:18] church why we used to go to brother Tom
[1:20:20] Browns Church him and he used to go to
[1:20:22] brother Branham Church they started at
[1:20:24] 10:30 so I think Branham Tabernacle you
[1:20:25] should start at 10:30 so let's say they
[1:20:27] did 10:30 11:30 12:30 1:00 so it's
[1:20:30] already a two and a half hour service
[1:20:32] and they were still an hour left to
[1:20:33] preach this would have been at least a
[1:20:36] three and a half or four hour service
[1:20:38] but look the people after two and a half
[1:20:41] hours they're still crying out take
[1:20:43] older brother rhythm now what if we were
[1:20:47] at 9:30 tonight we're at 8:20 right now
[1:20:49] what if at 9:30 tonight say can I take a
[1:20:51] few more minutes and you said take all
[1:20:53] night brother Jess you see I'm just
[1:20:56] trying to show you like how much they
[1:20:58] were enjoying the word and that's what
[1:21:00] we want to do we want to enjoy the word
[1:21:01] now we don't know where people out we
[1:21:03] don't want to make people upset but if
[1:21:05] the Holy Ghost wants to go a little
[1:21:06] longer we
[1:21:07] be flexible with that you see but I just
[1:21:10] want to show you and notice this is the
[1:21:12] pole for the Christ the word this is so
[1:21:14] important because later the Holy Ghost
[1:21:16] shows up not just by somebody feeling it
[1:21:18] but they saw it they literally saw the
[1:21:22] Holy Ghost they saw the pillar of fire
[1:21:25] and this is the kind of attitude they
[1:21:27] had when he came take all day
[1:21:30] preach all you what we're just here to
[1:21:32] hear God's Word I think you know it
[1:21:36] makes me happy Church because I believe
[1:21:37] God has taken us back to that as no
[1:21:40] matter I don't even look at numbers I
[1:21:41] don't care how small we are no matter
[1:21:43] but I believe God is going to keep
[1:21:44] making us love the word so much more
[1:21:46] that we're going to fall more in love
[1:21:47] with Christ as time goes on our battles
[1:21:50] will get harder but God will raise up a
[1:21:52] standard against it amen because that's
[1:21:55] the prophecy in the hour and we've got
[1:21:57] to fulfill the Word of God but RAM said
[1:22:01] we don't have time to pray but they
[1:22:03] actually do pray for the sick so by Ram
[1:22:06] was saying this and now I would look at
[1:22:08] Scofield this was the revelation I found
[1:22:10] that the Holy Spirit does represent lion
[1:22:15] mark does represent ox Luke represents
[1:22:17] the man and John represents the eagle
[1:22:19] the Holy Spirit showed me this years ago
[1:22:21] because I used to study the Scofield
[1:22:23] Bible so much and then when I heard this
[1:22:24] sermon I'm like yeah that's right I did
[1:22:27] read that a few months or whatever it
[1:22:29] was it was really striking the Holy
[1:22:31] Ghost revealed this to me now look look
[1:22:32] what Scofield said now Mathew represents
[1:22:35] lying because Scofield said the focus of
[1:22:38] Mathew is on how he's the king of Israel
[1:22:40] and he came out of that king of Dave his
[1:22:43] lineage look what Scofield wrote now
[1:22:46] don't tell me you can't tell me that
[1:22:47] Rembrandt wasn't a prophet after this
[1:22:49] after reading this this should be
[1:22:50] another proof that he was a genuine
[1:22:52] prophet because this man lived way
[1:22:54] before a brother random now look what he
[1:22:57] says he said this connects he's taught
[1:22:59] you to has a theme of the book of
[1:23:01] Matthew he said this Matthew's the book
[1:23:04] of generation of Jesus Christ the Son of
[1:23:06] David the son of Abraham this connects
[1:23:08] him at once with two of the most
[1:23:09] important of the Old Testament covenants
[1:23:11] the Davidic given a covenant of kingship
[1:23:15] there's King and the Abrahamic covenant
[1:23:17] of promise of Jesus Christ
[1:23:20] in the twofold character than Matthew
[1:23:22] writes filing the order indicating the
[1:23:24] first verse
[1:23:25] he writes first of the king the son of
[1:23:27] David so this book starts off with
[1:23:30] showing the Dini ology of the King of
[1:23:32] Kings the Lord of lords amen
[1:23:34] but it shows his genealogy back to the
[1:23:37] king of David amen
[1:23:38] King David but the prominent character
[1:23:43] of Christ and Matthew is that of the
[1:23:45] covenant of King amen
[1:23:50] look what Scofield says about mark this
[1:23:53] is beautiful and I I just I was
[1:23:55] rejoicing over this this is powerful
[1:23:56] right here but let's get hold on to that
[1:23:58] in the book of Mark Jesus is seen as the
[1:24:01] mighty worker rather than the unique
[1:24:03] teacher he's the Jehovah's servant the
[1:24:08] branch everywhere the servant character
[1:24:11] of the Incarnate son is manifest the key
[1:24:14] verse is mark 10:45 for even the Son of
[1:24:17] man came not to be ministered unto but
[1:24:19] to minister the characteristic word is
[1:24:23] straightway because that's a servant's
[1:24:26] word in other words you do it right now
[1:24:28] you tell a servant do it right now get
[1:24:31] on that right you tell your children do
[1:24:32] it right now immediately do it right now
[1:24:34] you don't tell you don't tell your
[1:24:35] husband and wife that honey make me
[1:24:38] those steak and eggs right now you
[1:24:40] shouldn't act like that right that's
[1:24:45] what you that's how you talk to a
[1:24:46] servant straightway Jesus straightway to
[1:24:49] their straight way to that now this is
[1:24:51] the verse this is the idea I love
[1:24:52] there's no genealogy of Jesus in mark 4
[1:24:56] who gives the genealogy of a servant if
[1:25:01] that ain't inspired Holy Ghost thought I
[1:25:03] don't know what is amen proving that
[1:25:06] mark is the Scriptures the the gospel of
[1:25:09] the ox
[1:25:10] who cares who is where a servant came
[1:25:13] from he's just a servant oh my
[1:25:17] the distinctive character of Christ in
[1:25:19] mark is set forth in a Philippians
[1:25:21] sweetie he came in the form of a servant
[1:25:23] but this lowly emptied himself and
[1:25:26] became a form of God amen beautiful
[1:25:30] that's the most inspired one to me I
[1:25:32] think
[1:25:34] now look in the Luke Scofield says this
[1:25:36] in Luke he is the gospel of the human
[1:25:38] divine one but John is divine human one
[1:25:43] right the key phrase is the Son of Man
[1:25:46] so the Son of Man is expressed over and
[1:25:49] over in the Book of Luke and this book
[1:25:52] demonstrates how entirely human Jesus
[1:25:55] was his genealogy is traced to Adam the
[1:25:59] first human amen and then this this is
[1:26:03] the only book of the Gospels that shows
[1:26:06] what he was like as a child the only one
[1:26:08] because it shows his human side the Amen
[1:26:12] his infancy and boyhood when he up to
[1:26:14] twelve years old so Luke is the book of
[1:26:17] his human side or the man anointing oh
[1:26:20] my and John represents the ego because
[1:26:24] the Eagles happen to heavenlies and John
[1:26:27] starts off with in the beginning was the
[1:26:29] word the Word was with God and the Word
[1:26:31] was God
[1:26:32] it doesn't stay on the starts by
[1:26:34] starting in the heavenlies amen where
[1:26:37] Eagles rule right they ruled the sky
[1:26:39] hallelujah and this book starts in the
[1:26:42] heavenlies and shows he's the I am come
[1:26:45] down to hit from from heaven down to
[1:26:47] earth
[1:26:47] he's the incarnation of the Eternal Word
[1:26:50] the Sun of life honey believe Schofield
[1:26:54] had some inspiration he sure did now of
[1:26:57] course he believed in the Trinity so
[1:26:58] don't don't believe everything he said
[1:27:00] now let's update this a little bit so
[1:27:02] Luke is the man the line is Matthew the
[1:27:06] Ox is Mark and John is the ego did
[1:27:08] everyone understand that hey brother man
[1:27:10] said the holiest of holies is the book
[1:27:12] of Acts does that make sense everybody
[1:27:15] got that he said that was a brand new
[1:27:17] one in 1961 brand new one now bro Graham
[1:27:22] says let's take just one now this
[1:27:25] subject for salvation and remember the
[1:27:28] earthly number for the four Gospels so
[1:27:32] that's these let's see if these four
[1:27:33] Gospels are deliverers of the Word of
[1:27:36] God so if there's an attack on on the
[1:27:40] prends of God if there's an attack on
[1:27:42] the life of God the throne of God then
[1:27:44] God has to have protectors all around
[1:27:46] him
[1:27:48] he actually does now here's what brother
[1:27:51] branham preaches program preaches us I
[1:27:53] just did it my own illustration for you
[1:27:55] brother branham said let's take the
[1:27:57] subject of salvation through acts 2:38
[1:28:02] that is the life of God how many know
[1:28:05] that's the life of God brother him said
[1:28:07] if the disciples had a Creed it was acts
[1:28:09] 2:38 if it had a credo we believe
[1:28:13] statement it was acts 2:38 oh they have
[1:28:17] said that's the only way to salvation is
[1:28:19] acts 2:38 and he said if that's true
[1:28:23] then all four Gospels will guard that
[1:28:26] truth amen
[1:28:28] and Motum gives us three scriptures now
[1:28:32] he doesn't go to John but we could go to
[1:28:35] John and we could show scriptures in
[1:28:37] John about baptism in the name of Jesus
[1:28:39] I know we can show scriptures here and
[1:28:41] we can show scriptures there about Jesus
[1:28:43] said he that believes in his baptized
[1:28:45] shall be saved that's right and the
[1:28:48] scripture here is you know repentance
[1:28:49] and remission should be preached in his
[1:28:50] name as a witness to every nation amen
[1:28:53] how to think of one on John I can't
[1:28:55] think of one right now but think you
[1:28:57] understand what I'm saying this Matthew
[1:28:59] does the book of Matthew protect that
[1:29:02] salvation comes through acts 2:38 in the
[1:29:05] book of Acts does it protect it now so
[1:29:09] Bertram's question is do all four
[1:29:10] Gospels support or guard the way to the
[1:29:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost through acts
[1:29:15] 2:38 well the answer is yes that is so
[1:29:19] see the Gospels do not support a
[1:29:21] Trinitarian approach to God so see the
[1:29:26] the Trinitarians put Matthew 28:19 in
[1:29:29] there but you can't that's not the life
[1:29:32] of the church the life of the church was
[1:29:34] the book of Acts Amen brother Branham
[1:29:38] says it in this sermon - he said the
[1:29:40] preachers say that you know Acts is the
[1:29:42] framework and the Gospels are are the
[1:29:45] real core and bro-down said no but after
[1:29:48] the Gospels are the framework and the
[1:29:50] book of Acts is the life of God hey man
[1:29:53] what's eternity is put act on Matthew
[1:29:57] 28:19 there but that's not the life the
[1:30:00] life was in the church
[1:30:01] but life isn't the church today amen
[1:30:04] it's still a New Testament church we're
[1:30:06] under the blood of Jesus Christ amen
[1:30:09] it is the New Testament so now let's
[1:30:13] show how brother and improve this
[1:30:15] brother Brahim said now Matthew 28:19
[1:30:17] 28:19
[1:30:19] he said now that's where you Trinitarian
[1:30:20] brethren are going and then he reads the
[1:30:23] scripture he said but here comes around
[1:30:26] Pentecost and Peter said repent me
[1:30:28] baptize the name of Jesus he said
[1:30:30] something's wrong here he says Matthew
[1:30:32] are you that eastern gate guard so he
[1:30:36] starts talking to the guards Matthew are
[1:30:39] you guarding the eastern gate and
[1:30:41] brother Aaron said how's the gate
[1:30:43] where's the gate and the Bible said in
[1:30:46] Matthew 7 Strait is the gate and how is
[1:30:49] it spelled str AIT Strait means water
[1:30:52] water is the gate Amen how do you come
[1:30:56] in repent every one of you be baptized
[1:30:58] in the name of Jesus Christ that unlocks
[1:31:01] the gates amen so see that's that's what
[1:31:04] we're saying here that's that scripture
[1:31:06] right there Strait is the gate narrows
[1:31:08] the way and it's the strait is the gate
[1:31:10] strait is the waterway you've got to
[1:31:13] come through the water and the water
[1:31:15] that they talked about here was through
[1:31:17] baptism in jesus christ's name that
[1:31:19] unlocks the gate to get to acts 2:38
[1:31:22] amen hallelujah can you see it
[1:31:25] now hope it makes sense now but I God's
[1:31:27] grace in other words every doctrine we
[1:31:30] hold if we are the true Church of the
[1:31:32] Living God
[1:31:33] every doctor we hold can be supported by
[1:31:35] all the four Gospels in other words
[1:31:38] everything we believe will not be
[1:31:41] contradicted in any of the Gospels
[1:31:43] how many appreciate that God set it up
[1:31:46] God set it up so the book of Acts was
[1:31:49] the life the holiest of holies for today
[1:31:51] is the baptismal ghost
[1:31:53] and the framework of the guards around
[1:31:55] it are the four Gospels amen
[1:31:59] glory so that's what brother Branham
[1:32:02] teaches us he says so that unlocks the
[1:32:05] gates when you come through Matthew oh
[1:32:06] I'm reading Matthew 7 Strait is the gate
[1:32:08] oh I got to be baptized not sprinkle
[1:32:11] baptize that will unlock the gate
[1:32:15] get to the holiest Amen Larry to get to
[1:32:18] the book of Acts here's another one
[1:32:21] oh but brother Brandon you got Matthew
[1:32:24] 28:19 down there on your on your chart
[1:32:27] but man said that's exactly right but
[1:32:30] Matthew are you guarding it he said sure
[1:32:34] I'm the full guard so did you catch that
[1:32:37] brother branham on the chalkboard drew
[1:32:39] this
[1:32:39] he drew baptize them in the name of the
[1:32:41] Father Son Holy Ghost he drew that on
[1:32:44] the board and said that scripture
[1:32:47] protects acts 2:38 you and I are not
[1:32:51] scared of extra Matthew 28:19 that
[1:32:54] doesn't make me shake in the boots when
[1:32:56] people say that I say yeah read it the
[1:32:58] way it says it says baptized in the name
[1:33:01] there's one name to the father son Holy
[1:33:03] Ghost
[1:33:04] it's a guard protecting the fact that
[1:33:06] everybody was baptized by one name in
[1:33:09] the book of Acts amen it's guarding it
[1:33:12] acts up sir Matthew 28:19 guards the
[1:33:15] truth that we find in the book of Acts
[1:33:17] glory
[1:33:19] I know simple but that's the truth and
[1:33:22] this is the new revelation brother
[1:33:24] Graham gave out 1961 so see he said now
[1:33:28] get Matthew 1:18 now I didn't write down
[1:33:32] Matthew 1:18 but you know it was when
[1:33:34] Gabriel visited Joseph and told him take
[1:33:36] a name in his name will be called the
[1:33:38] Messiah Emmanuel and call his name Jesus
[1:33:41] amen so you go back there the name of
[1:33:46] the son is Jesus you have to come by the
[1:33:50] straight water gate the way of baptism
[1:33:52] and there's one name to the father son
[1:33:54] in the name of the son is Jesus there's
[1:33:56] one name to the father only ghost you
[1:33:58] get to the book of Acts and they always
[1:33:59] baptized the name of Jesus Christ Lord
[1:34:01] Jesus our Lord you put them all together
[1:34:03] it's one name the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:34:07] they're all protected by the grace of
[1:34:09] God all the acts scriptures are
[1:34:12] protected by the Gospels amen aren't you
[1:34:15] glad Church oh I love that don't you
[1:34:18] hallelujah we're been said does he
[1:34:20] garden does Matthew garden or not he
[1:34:24] said yes it's just this so this is the
[1:34:27] thought title
[1:34:29] to that one name fathers a title sons a
[1:34:32] title Holy Ghost is a title that's what
[1:34:35] I was telling that brother the at the
[1:34:37] hospital two weeks ago I said I'm a
[1:34:39] father son brother teacher pastor I got
[1:34:43] deacon trustee song leader of all these
[1:34:46] things I have all these titles but I got
[1:34:47] one name I signed my check with Jesse
[1:34:49] Smith they those are all titles and
[1:34:52] that's the revelation that guards the
[1:34:54] Prince of God the Prince of God is
[1:34:56] through the name the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:34:59] see here it is Matthew's a guard he
[1:35:03] guards it so Matthew 29:19 doesn't
[1:35:06] attack us
[1:35:07] it doesn't defeat us it actually
[1:35:09] protects us does it make us sad it makes
[1:35:13] us stronger and that's what I told the
[1:35:17] same guy - I said there you will not
[1:35:19] find any other scripture in the book of
[1:35:20] Acts or in the entire New Testament
[1:35:22] where anyone ever said father son Holy
[1:35:24] Ghost in one scripture ever again God
[1:35:27] gave that Jesus gave that one statement
[1:35:30] in order to reveal the mystery that
[1:35:32] there was one name to the father and
[1:35:34] Holy Ghost the Lord Jesus Christ that's
[1:35:37] in that that's in Matthew 13 the Bible
[1:35:39] said he was going to come and reveal
[1:35:41] mysteries how we know that let's go
[1:35:43] there real quick we go to Matthew 13 let
[1:35:44] me find that there was prophecy that
[1:35:47] said Jesus Christ would reveal mystery
[1:35:49] and when Jesus said father and Holy
[1:35:51] Ghost he was revealing a mystery but
[1:35:56] sure let me pull it up there yeah
[1:35:59] Matthew 13 11 there it is well I'm sorry
[1:36:02] no that's not the one let me look again
[1:36:12] I thought the Bible said Jesus would
[1:36:14] speak to them in mysteries just a moment
[1:36:21] here well I'll have to look for that
[1:36:36] late
[1:36:36] I can't find that one right now I
[1:36:37] thought for sure it was prophesied that
[1:36:40] Jesus would speaking of them in the
[1:36:41] mysteries let me just look there my real
[1:36:45] Bible real quick here I was trying to
[1:36:46] find out on the concordance mystery I
[1:36:50] thought that was the word now this could
[1:36:54] be one time I could have to have to
[1:36:57] follow up with you on this one here I
[1:36:58] thought for sure said that oh there it
[1:37:02] is right there merci yeah this Matthew
[1:37:03] 13 you're right there I'm sorry I got
[1:37:05] the wrong word I got looking for the
[1:37:06] wrong word here it is it's Matthew 13 35
[1:37:09] forgive me Church I knew it was in there
[1:37:11] I was get a little nervous there though
[1:37:13] like I thought it was mr. Matthew 13 35
[1:37:17] now this proves it beyond a shadow of
[1:37:18] doubt look what it says here that it
[1:37:20] might be fulfilled which was spoken by
[1:37:21] the Prophet saying I'll open my mouth in
[1:37:24] parables I will utter things which have
[1:37:26] been kept secret from the foundation of
[1:37:29] the world amen
[1:37:30] the Bible said Jesus would utter secrets
[1:37:33] that were hidden from the foundation of
[1:37:35] the world and when he said Peter you
[1:37:37] baptized in the name of the Father Son
[1:37:39] Holy Ghost ten days later Peter got the
[1:37:42] revelation that Jesus was the father son
[1:37:45] Holy Ghost
[1:37:45] although the Godhead bodily dwelt in
[1:37:48] Christ they meant all that God was was
[1:37:50] bought up in Christ and this was the
[1:37:53] secret that was kept from everyone to
[1:37:56] the foundation of the world and revealed
[1:37:58] in Matthew 28:19 matthew 28:9 19 doesn't
[1:38:01] attack us it helps us it guards us
[1:38:05] hallelujah well praise God and now
[1:38:10] programs switches subjects like I told
[1:38:11] you he didn't show Mark Luke or John
[1:38:14] with salvation or baptism he only didn't
[1:38:16] Mathew Branham says now I've got a whole
[1:38:18] bunch of other for salvation but take
[1:38:20] these others so he skips salvation and
[1:38:23] he skips to divine healing let's see if
[1:38:25] Matthew up here guards it for divine
[1:38:28] healing now you list all these
[1:38:33] scriptures now he said now there's John
[1:38:35] 14:12 John 15:7 he said mark 16 he said
[1:38:39] see if they're guarding divine healing
[1:38:41] around the throne of God oh this is
[1:38:45] beautiful
[1:38:46] he said let's run a few of them and see
[1:38:49] if they guard see if
[1:38:50] guard the right to divine healing the
[1:38:52] same as they guard the gate for Jesus's
[1:38:55] name baptism amen to see every every
[1:38:59] apostolic truth of the gospel of Jesus
[1:39:01] Christ is protected by Jesus's guards
[1:39:04] his four Gospels his four throne guards
[1:39:07] protect everything that was going to
[1:39:10] continue in the book of Acts it was
[1:39:12] protected and preached and taught inside
[1:39:14] the Gospels amen
[1:39:16] now brother Graham said do you think
[1:39:20] that God don't put a guard around his
[1:39:22] work you think God just puts his word
[1:39:23] out there and doesn't guard it see you
[1:39:26] see that ox line man eagle it still
[1:39:29] isn't setting up these gates right here
[1:39:30] on earth right now so look it's right
[1:39:32] here on earth right now brother Graham
[1:39:33] says here's the Gospels the four Gospels
[1:39:35] and notice everywhere they went they
[1:39:38] went straight forward they don't
[1:39:39] contradict one another amen they stay
[1:39:44] with one another one goes with the
[1:39:47] shrewdness of a man the other one goes
[1:39:48] to the swiftest of an eagle the other
[1:39:50] one's a pastor at the auction one's an
[1:39:53] evangelist to fly like the evangelists
[1:39:54] and see the other ones like a pastor
[1:39:56] though other ones are sturdy the other
[1:39:58] ones a shrewd see guarded on every side
[1:40:00] got God guarding this holy ghost gospel
[1:40:03] believe it brother all right
[1:40:06] now one time can I just stop a moment
[1:40:08] one time brother Jose and I were talking
[1:40:11] some people have taken that quote and
[1:40:13] they've made these five they made them
[1:40:15] the five preaching offices but I said I
[1:40:18] don't know about this but you know some
[1:40:23] people said this is the apostle because
[1:40:26] they produce real life they produce new
[1:40:29] life in different cities the Ox I'm
[1:40:32] sorry the Ox
[1:40:33] yeah the Ox would have to be a pastor
[1:40:35] John would have to be the prophet
[1:40:37] because remember the highest office I
[1:40:39] know that offends people but the highest
[1:40:40] office is actually an apostle it's
[1:40:43] actually higher than a prophet I know
[1:40:45] some people don't like that but the
[1:40:46] Bible said first our apostles because
[1:40:49] they're scared you're hurting brother
[1:40:50] Brandon but we're not hurting brother
[1:40:51] branham you're helping brother Brandon
[1:40:52] by staying with the word ok now Matthew
[1:40:55] the King I'm not sure which of those is
[1:40:57] the king and then the man that must be
[1:41:00] teacher so that must be evangelist
[1:41:03] I don't know uh but see I couldn't never
[1:41:05] figure it out perfectly to make it fit
[1:41:07] but that's a thought some preachers have
[1:41:08] said because brother branham he says the
[1:41:12] axe is like the pastor so there's five
[1:41:14] of them which there's a fivefold
[1:41:15] ministry so just a little nugget for you
[1:41:17] I don't know maybe God will give us more
[1:41:19] revelation on later but I can see a lot
[1:41:21] of its rec and see all these true but
[1:41:23] you know seeing evangelist as a king I'm
[1:41:25] not sure about that you know I don't
[1:41:27] know interesting all right so I'm sorry
[1:41:31] let's stay on this one so for now we're
[1:41:33] at divine healing so now let's get off
[1:41:35] the fivefold ministry let's get out and
[1:41:36] divine healing but a man said the divine
[1:41:40] healing of the book of Acts is supported
[1:41:42] by all these scriptures in other words
[1:41:44] it's guarded by the entire four Gospels
[1:41:46] if God wants divine healing in the book
[1:41:49] of Acts he's got a guard it in Matthew
[1:41:51] Mark Luke and John and he does but man
[1:41:55] said see that guard sitting at the gate
[1:41:57] the gospel guard to back up the word of
[1:41:58] Acts that was wrote now let's go to John
[1:42:01] 14:12 and see if John's gonna back up
[1:42:04] and guard the precious things at
[1:42:05] Pentecost now let me just quote these
[1:42:08] this is the works he that believeth on
[1:42:11] me the works that I do should do also so
[1:42:14] this is the signs wonders and miracles
[1:42:16] right this is if you abide in me and by
[1:42:19] to my word ask what you want to be given
[1:42:21] unto you so more divine healing Matthew
[1:42:24] 10 that's where Jesus gives the
[1:42:26] disciples power over every unclean
[1:42:29] spirit divine healing same thing here
[1:42:32] power over divine healing these are
[1:42:34] parallel passages about the Apostles
[1:42:36] giving power given power by Jesus I
[1:42:38] don't remember that one
[1:42:41] mark 11 I don't remember that what I do
[1:42:43] remember that one that was when Jesus
[1:42:44] ascended and Jesus said he that
[1:42:47] believeth in me he said those speaking
[1:42:48] tongues that lay hands on the sick and
[1:42:50] they shall recover a head so see every
[1:42:52] one of the guards protects the Word of
[1:42:55] God for divine healing aren't you glad
[1:42:57] and you can turn to any book any book of
[1:43:00] the Apostles er need any book of the
[1:43:02] Gospels and you can find encouragement
[1:43:04] that God is your healer today how many
[1:43:07] thankful God's your healer just got to
[1:43:09] turn the Bible and we'll find it now I'm
[1:43:11] gonna skip that because I've already
[1:43:12] gone to our so program said see all four
[1:43:15] guard
[1:43:16] the book of Acts he says again and again
[1:43:19] and again now see this program said
[1:43:21] God's guards will stop the approach to
[1:43:23] God by the way the Methodist and Baptist
[1:43:25] Creed's right like a Baptist will say
[1:43:29] you just got to be baptized in water you
[1:43:32] already got the Holy Ghost that won't
[1:43:34] work God doesn't have guards to back
[1:43:36] that up that won't work because the
[1:43:38] Bible said you got to repent be baptized
[1:43:40] and be filled with the Holy Ghost amen
[1:43:44] hallelujah he said boy the South gates
[1:43:49] guarded by the ox so he he just gives he
[1:43:51] just reads the scriptures that I showed
[1:43:52] you now in closing he said every
[1:43:56] generation must receive the sign of the
[1:43:58] Resurrection you talk about Jonah's
[1:43:59] resurrection the days of Jesus they had
[1:44:01] to receive a resurrection see the sign
[1:44:03] of the resurrection will be done in a
[1:44:05] wicked and doctors generation it was
[1:44:07] done in the book of Acts Jesus raised
[1:44:09] from the dead coming to Peter James John
[1:44:11] the Apostles and they did this book of
[1:44:13] Acts it wasn't the Acts of the Apostles
[1:44:15] it was the Acts of the Holy Ghost
[1:44:17] working in the Apostles it's not a man
[1:44:21] today now I hope never to get this here
[1:44:23] it's not a man today it's the Holy Ghost
[1:44:26] working through a man or men see brother
[1:44:29] Graham doesn't say it's all about me
[1:44:31] today it's just about the Holy Ghost
[1:44:33] anointing me and no one else he says no
[1:44:35] it's through men see that does the work
[1:44:39] it's not the man the man just the vessel
[1:44:41] see but the Holy Ghost is the oil that's
[1:44:44] in the vessel and look what they did
[1:44:46] look at the signs that they done for
[1:44:48] Jesus they had to take notice of them
[1:44:50] because they were ignorant learned Peter
[1:44:52] and John but that they noticed them that
[1:44:54] they been with Jesus they done the
[1:44:56] things that he did how many want to see
[1:44:58] the sign of the Resurrection more in
[1:45:00] your life oh I do I want to see more
[1:45:02] Living Christ in my life well we just
[1:45:04] got to be more devoted to Christ we got
[1:45:06] to pray more we got a love of God more
[1:45:08] read our Bibles more love each other
[1:45:10] more we've got to be more in love with
[1:45:11] the word all the time God is gonna bring
[1:45:14] his bride to that position so see that
[1:45:16] this doesn't discourage me this has
[1:45:18] encourages me because this is where
[1:45:19] God's taking us amen so you see every
[1:45:24] book in the Bible the four books the
[1:45:26] four Gospels guard the Pentecostal
[1:45:29] blessing we
[1:45:30] every scripture to back up exactly what
[1:45:32] they said
[1:45:33] and now the Acts of the Apostles
[1:45:35] vindicate today with the four Gospels
[1:45:37] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:45:39] today and forever do you love him now he
[1:45:42] gives one more thought and let's stand
[1:45:44] to our feet here in a Santa Fe
[1:45:45] Malek I get that a remote ready for the
[1:45:48] TV because I'm gonna try to play this
[1:45:49] now brother Ram starts the prayer line
[1:45:52] after preaching three hours so if he
[1:45:56] preached at 11:00 it's our eleven twelve
[1:45:57] one two it have already been two o'clock
[1:45:59] in the afternoon brother brings one more
[1:46:03] thought he says the cherubims they're
[1:46:06] out here today trying to run people
[1:46:08] guard them to the throne trying to bring
[1:46:11] them through the gate back to the Tree
[1:46:13] of Life again that they might take of
[1:46:15] this the bread of life and then brother
[1:46:21] branham applies it to the sick did you
[1:46:23] know angels are here if you're sick did
[1:46:25] you know angels are trying to push you
[1:46:27] to the throne of God did you know that
[1:46:28] but Ram said in the book of Genesis they
[1:46:31] were trying to keep them out but brother
[1:46:32] Han said today the angels of God the
[1:46:34] anointing of God is trying to push you
[1:46:36] into his presence oh so what do we need
[1:46:40] up tonight whenever in need of if it's
[1:46:42] God's will God's Spirit is here to push
[1:46:44] us to that it might happen tonight next
[1:46:47] week next year
[1:46:48] it don't matter but God is pushing you
[1:46:50] there and if it's God's will you'll get
[1:46:52] there amen because that's what they're
[1:46:55] doing now they're push it's the angel no
[1:46:57] it's an eagle anointing pushing us I'll
[1:46:59] say like this lifting us up into
[1:47:00] heavenly places lifting us up with more
[1:47:03] faith more healing more deliverance more
[1:47:05] victory more love a whatever you need up
[1:47:08] God's Spirit is here to lift us up into
[1:47:10] that atmosphere and then oh I love a
[1:47:13] good rain shower amen
[1:47:15] and then church at the end of this
[1:47:18] recording three hours and three minutes
[1:47:20] into this recording after three weeks
[1:47:24] remember brother Ram preached the last
[1:47:26] two weeks of December all of the church
[1:47:27] ages and then he preaches the first week
[1:47:30] of 1961 about Revelation chapter 4 after
[1:47:34] three weeks God vindicates the church
[1:47:36] ages by sending the pillar of fire
[1:47:39] to back it up so let's listen this let's
[1:47:42] turn it up all the way maokai can you
[1:47:43] turn up all the way
[1:47:44] oops it's are you up all the way thank
[1:47:45] you sir now this might be mm so be
[1:47:47] prepared to turn it down now it's going
[1:47:50] to start off you're not going to hear
[1:47:52] these words at first you're going to
[1:47:53] hear a few words before that and then
[1:47:55] you're going to hear people screaming
[1:47:56] because they're seeing a pillar of fire
[1:47:58] so in other words Church this is what it
[1:48:00] sounds like when the Holy Ghost is in
[1:48:02] here too and the church said people will
[1:48:05] be screaming people will be shouting
[1:48:07] people are rejoicing or crying or
[1:48:09] glorifying God something's gonna happen
[1:48:11] to you because God's anointing you amen
[1:48:13] hey man just encourage us tonight God
[1:48:17] thought so much of all this Bible based
[1:48:19] teaching your the four Gospels the
[1:48:21] throne guards all these things the
[1:48:22] cherubims God thought so much of it he
[1:48:25] sent the Holy Ghost to do seven
[1:48:26] different shadows on the wall
[1:48:28] amen we know who he served tonight hear
[1:48:33] this yes it's gonna work tonight
[1:48:38] you're gonna hear the tape cut off and
[1:48:40] it's going to pick up right when the
[1:48:41] Holy Ghost is there okay cut it off
[1:49:17] right there

[1:49:21] colors they actually saw the shading it
[1:49:24] got brighter and then it made the exact
[1:49:26] same shapes of the seven moons the seven
[1:49:29] church ages and the Pete let's hear it
[1:49:31] again let's hear it again listen to this
[1:49:36] they're actually seeing it and brother
[1:49:38] man is all comfortable because he's used
[1:49:40] to it oh we should be used to the Holy
[1:49:43] Ghost amen
[1:49:44] sorry
[1:49:53] here it is whoo see that you see that so
[1:50:16] brother BAM he's in a prayer line in the
[1:50:18] bran tabernacle there's a woman here the
[1:50:20] lights over her but the reflection is on
[1:50:23] the wall and people are seeing the
[1:50:26] reflection of the church ages but the
[1:50:28] Holy Ghost is actually over the woman
[1:50:30] and brother rams all under control
[1:50:32] because he used to see in the pillar
[1:50:34] fire oh that's how I would it be hey men
[1:50:36] I'm used to seeing the power of God now
[1:50:39] he keeps going this is the same quote
[1:50:41] there's no break here sorry so see that
[1:51:01] the people cannot see the Holy Ghost
[1:51:04] over the woman the pillar of fire they
[1:51:06] could only see the reflection on the
[1:51:07] wall that's what brother BAM saying and
[1:51:09] now notice what does the Holy Ghost do
[1:51:11] when he gets there he starts discerning
[1:51:14] their hearts don't you love it when God
[1:51:17] speaks to you in a church service that
[1:51:19] lets you know that the Holy Ghost is
[1:51:21] here it's the same Holy Ghost not a
[1:51:24] different one it's the same Holy Ghost
[1:51:26] discerning the thoughts intents of our
[1:51:28] heart I'm not going to play the rest of
[1:51:30] it because you know it he actually says
[1:51:32] it there's a man out here along this
[1:51:34] line it struck him so the light went
[1:51:36] from her to him he's from Seymour
[1:51:38] Indiana he's had a stroke if you believe
[1:51:41] sir god I hear that stroke believe now
[1:51:43] look he just sees his name and calls him
[1:51:45] out the Holy Ghost move him oh don't you
[1:51:47] want the Holy Ghost to move here amen
[1:51:49] brother Branham said this the next week
[1:51:52] he said this he said we've had a
[1:51:56] constant revival on the outpouring of
[1:51:58] the Holy Ghost he said back at the
[1:52:01] tavern we've had one at the Tabernacle I
[1:52:03] had a series of subjects I was telling
[1:52:05] you on the seven last Church ages
[1:52:07] finish up last Sunday on the fourth
[1:52:08] chapter revelations my congregation was
[1:52:10] about 400 people or 350 something like
[1:52:12] that while I was speaking and it called
[1:52:15] the prayer line the speaking of the
[1:52:17] reflection from the Shekinah glory to
[1:52:19] the Stars to the sea of glass where the
[1:52:21] sacrifices was wash you know which
[1:52:23] represents sinners the water separation
[1:52:25] and while I was speaking on that then
[1:52:27] turned to pray for the sick the Ainge
[1:52:29] Lord came right down before them all
[1:52:31] went right over and stood in the corner
[1:52:33] here or there and 300 more people stood
[1:52:37] there looked at it for 15 minutes
[1:52:38] screaming and crying and praising God
[1:52:40] all of them look the first time I ever
[1:52:43] come like that before our church just
[1:52:44] come right in and moved right over there
[1:52:47] and stood there and you just had the
[1:52:49] privilege to hear it Amen let's get the
[1:52:52] Lord round of applause amen
[1:52:54] now I better stop right there it's
[1:52:56] almost 9 o'clock but the point I want to
[1:52:58] make behind that as all these truths
[1:53:00] that we learned about church this is not
[1:53:02] knowledge this is not just for knowledge
[1:53:04] this is to show us that God's Word is
[1:53:06] absolutely true and the message we've
[1:53:09] heard is thus saith the Lord and we can
[1:53:13] have confidence that the Holy Ghost
[1:53:14] Eagle anointing is here for you and I
[1:53:17] and that anointing is pushing us for
[1:53:19] more of the anointing are you with me
[1:53:21] Amen that's about our heads for where to
[1:53:23] prayer now how you come to the piano
[1:53:25] here by the grace of God let's just bow
[1:53:29] our heads as we think about this God is
[1:53:31] pushing us into his presence Oh God

[1:53:40] tonight but why don't you pray for as we
[1:53:42] close this service here in prayer just
[1:53:44] believe with all your heart how many
[1:53:46] will try to do it believe with all your
[1:53:47] heart if the Holy Spirit spoke something
[1:53:51] to your heart tonight or discerned a
[1:53:52] need or discern the situation we should
[1:53:55] take that as God backing up his word

[1:54:20] pillar of fire coming down in a church a
[1:54:24] humble little church it's shining your

[2:01:05] thought it was striking as I prepared
[2:01:08] this sermon it ended with the pillar of
[2:01:10] fire and then this Sunday we start our
[2:01:12] pillar of fire services when the pillar
[2:01:14] fire saved this generation by God's
[2:01:15] grace I thought it was striking so on
[2:01:18] Sunday at 4 o'clock we'll be preaching
[2:01:20] on the save the Lord for today we don't
[2:01:23] have to guess well this is program's
[2:01:25] opinion we know this is God's opinion
[2:01:27] because the Holy Ghost protects all of
[2:01:30] his word
[2:01:31] he guards office word if no
[2:01:33] contradictions in the message of God
[2:01:36] because God's message is the Word of God
[2:01:39] amen
[2:01:41] also thank you aren't you glad the
[2:01:43] pillar fire came and vindicated his
[2:01:44] message more gives me such a confidence

[2:01:51] I know one thing that God loves this
[2:01:53] word that we pray amen
[2:01:55] no matter we know it's gonna be less and
[2:01:57] less I just heard it today brother says

[2:02:03] less with me fewer and fewer people but
[2:02:05] I'm telling you you and I are one of
[2:02:07] those feeling that we have to be one of
[2:02:10] those few fewer fewer are you willing to
[2:02:13] hold on if you're one of the few
[2:02:14] absolutely I'll hang on if nobody else
[2:02:17] does amen we'll hang on if nobody else
