lord god for your glory for we're gathered here not in vain not to be seen a man or woman but we're here to be seen by god that we might seek after him and feel after him and touch him lord and

all these october birthdays you'll bless them god for your glory and bless our servants tonight in the prepares for a communion on sunday should you tarry in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god you can switch over here to my uh ipad i want to share some quotes and everything by the grace of the lord so uh i just want to again start with this here briefly by the grace of god oh each of us have a spiritual land we're supposed to possess not brazil this is brazil's map but you're not supposed to go take over brazil i just use the map okay but you need to possess your relationships for the kingdom of god hallelujah your ministries whatever ministries you've been called to uh your vocation your job your gifts of the holy spirit and the location you're to live in each one of these areas is gonna have to be a battle and you're gonna have to fight it by the word of god okay so let me just give an example go to ephesians since we're already in there go to ephesians chapter five so this would be for relationships with the married people uh single people should read this and then pray god help me to have this character uh when it comes time for me to be married praise god and our young people should be thinking about that too and i mean i have the love of jesus christ because i think it goes fast it goes real fast so uh look at uh verse 22 wives submit unto your own husbands as unto the lord so for a sister then she's got to possess that she has to submit to her own husband not somebody else's husband right but her own husband as long as it's an obedient uh request right as long as it's a godly request right now of course you should submit to the preaching as well as long as it's in the word of god right but she's supposed to love and respect her husband first she's got to possess that now i'm sure we all know a lot of women that don't respect their husbands because they're not christians or they're they're not born again right right so see they have not possessed that land right they haven't possessed it okay but they have to but they can because remember we just read all spiritual blessings are yours right so we know god will help you do it if you want to do it amen but you just gotta want to praise god right now let's get to those men let's not forget about those men right uh uh go down to verse 25 husbands love your wives as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it so we need men that will of course they got to provide and you know the bible said the woman guides the house and everything and we know you know sometimes women can have jobs outside the home if there's a there's a need for that but in the most case the man has to he has to provide but then when he gets home he's got to love his wife like christ loved the church in other words support his wife a husband's job is not all about himself it's about providing for the kids and then loving his wife notice it sometimes it's hard for men to love but men can learn to love because you can possess your land brothers well i think i'm just women are the only married men here tonight you know i'm sure there's some listening over the you in the live stream right or we'll listen later on but we need men that will love and we need wives that we'll submit but we need a godly man who's not going to ask his wife to do something that's outside the word that's what we need praise god and we need wives that if their husband asks them to do something they'll say yes honey i'll do it by god's grace right and not argue not fuss we need a man a husband that won't argue and fuss either right so we need we need holy ghost-filled saints that are gonna possess these promises praise god like i told the brothers that uh i preached six marriage banquets right i preached six so i always tell them the brothers i said i said when you get home that's your time to serve your wife and kids it's not your time to go play your games or do whatever you want to do you need to get home and love and try to make life a little easier for your wife praise god and then the preachers will get up the pastors go back to her and say brothers we got a lot of work to do don't we but that's true he has to love her his wife like christ love how did christ love the church he gave himself amen every everything he could do he did it for praise god amen anyway he could help the bride he helped his bride his people his church and so the husband should be the same way any way a husband can help his wife he ought to be able to do it praise god now i know there's a balance church i understand that uh but that's the anointing of the holy ghost if you're ever going to be a holy ghost-filled husband right praise god or a holy ghost-filled wife amen she's got to learn to submit because the bible said in verse 23 the husband is has the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he's the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject in the christ so let the wise be to their own husbands in everything that's a tough spill that's a tough pill to swallow right but sisters have to submit to everything that's godly right so whatever the husband would ask you to do the wife's got to do it but the man equally has to love like christ loved amen he's got to be such a selfless person where he's not worried about himself so much he's worried about his wife and the children praise god and be able to see how can i serve my family when i get home not how can i serve myself and watch monday night football because that that is serving yourself right that's a vain that's a vain thing there's going to be no reward in heaven how many super bowl trophies they win in fact that take them to hell right because we found the last year the super the super bowl win quarterback last year admitted his wife was a witch last year did you see that he admitted he said but my wife's a good witch there's no such thing all witches are abominable and they'll be destroyed in the lake of fire if they don't repent see how see how they're so deceived they think well winning uh these things uh are have some have some eternal impact well not godly but could have an eternal impact of going to hell right eternal judgment not eternal punishment eternal judgment god will not punish someone unending eternally for only 20 or 50 or 70 years of disobedience he will not do that he's too merciful he won't he won't punish them that long but the judgment will last for all eternity in other words at some point that person will cease to exist and thank god at some point satan will cease to exist amen hallelujah praise god amen there come a time where he can't tempt you anymore amen he can't make you fall anymore he can't trick you or deceive you there will be a time that jesus throws him in the lake of fire bye bye devil amen hallelujah looking forward to that time praise god christ will do it by the word of his mouth so that's just one example and then remember it's also uh marrying one person right a holy gospel person will marry one person right now if they if their spouse dies yes they can marry again but adulterers uh the bible tells that plainly adulterers were now inherit the kingdom of god now can they be forgiven yes they can be forgiven but someone can't say well i just want a new wife so i'll divorce my wife and i'll marry a younger one you cannot be a holy ghost-filled christian and possess that land you're not in the land if you do that you're still in egypt praise god right you're so you're still in the world because then they'll marry two three times four times like like like we said with billy graham's daughter being married four times and thinking it's okay it's not okay you can't be in that land unless you're obeying the law of that land amen hallelujah the word of god hallelujah because the holy ghost will not guide you outside the bible it'll guide your life to obey with the bible to live the bible amen and then ministries now this this is what it is prayer fasting and alms are ministries will guide you to some type of ministry so think about that there's some people that can just pray more than others and they get better results that's the ministry and then there's some people that can fast and when they fast mind many times god will hear that prayer that's their ministry yours might not be so much in that or almsgiving there's some people they just give in secret they just give and they don't really care to store up all their treasures on earth they want to storm treasures in heaven amen and they're just really gifted at giving there's some people that make clothes like tabitha remember peter raised her from the dead by the power of the holy ghost her testimony after she died was look at these clothes she makes for all the poor people that was her holy ghost ministry was clothing the poor but then jesus raised her up amen i think jesus thinks a lot of a person that wants to clothe those people that don't have clothes he thinks so much of her he raised her from the dead amen that's beautiful and then your gifts the gifts of the holy ghost you're able to keep those in obedience to the word of god okay such as wisdom and knowledge and miracles uh and speaking in tongues and interpretation and prophecy and discernment of spirit and all the gifts of the holy spirit you're able to keep those in line praise god now i believe that's what happened church on saturday night my my brother was sick with coven i felt led of the holy ghost after service i said brother amen i forgot to pray for him i said brother amen come in here anoint me with oil i'm standing in the gap for my family praise god and i think i missed a couple meals that day and i was just trying to focus on the word of the lord and then the next day i get i'm sorry two days later i get the news that they were healed on sunday morning by god's grace so that's that's healing right that's a gift of healing because i just felt led to do that i just forgot about it let felt let it do it we talked about different people we prayed for them to heal the glaucoma and the ankle infection and all these things like that that's just this year and so we're thankful that when we pray god answers amen but we've got to be able to take our gifts back to the word of god we can possess all things everybody say all ready we can possess all things all spiritual blessings in christ jesus let me go back to that you're blessed with all spiritual blessings as you sit in heavenly places okay now i want to get to some quotes i didn't get to these quotes earlier so i want to get to them i meant to preach them about two weeks ago so brother barron says when you are born again which is the bible preaching when you're born again you eat mature foods so go to hebrews 5. i i guess i could pull it up here um yeah if i got my bible app here is that too small yeah i kind of saw anyways go to hebrews chapter five when you are born again you can handle really deep uh lessons the word of god look at verse 12 13-14 for when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again the first principles of the oracles of god and are become as such have need of milk and not of strong meat so there's some people that are in here today and they're just drinking milk all they can drink is the milk that i preach which is fine if that's where they are but it's not fine if you should be able to handle greater things right if you've been around longer and you know some of these things uh like the bible says there comes a time when you get a god you've got to get off milk and you've got to take some meat praise god he says for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he's a babe okay so using the in chapter six chapter six goes over uh the the kind of baby principles which they're important they are very important but if you just stay on those a long time you won't grow to maturity now finishing this now look at 14 14 is where that if you want to be a mature christian look right here but strong meat belonging to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil so paul says the meat-eating christian amen the eagle meat-eating christian praise god his life or her life is spent many of the time deciding is this evil for me or is this good for me now look that's not legalism it's wisdom amen and actually the word is discernment the word discern means a judge you have a judging spirit judging this will be evil for me but this will be good for me that's a mature christian not just all i can do i can act like everybody else everybody else in the church can do that i'm sure i can do it too well you want to be you want to be more spiritual praise god not critical and not prideful and not legalistic but when you're eating on the meat of god's word you take in the word and you say holy spirit am i pleasing you in this area or am i not i want to be able to discern good and evil i want to do what's right i want a feast on the meat of god's word that's why like with that statement about the super bowl uh that that's milk that's milk right you should be able to discern if they have half naked women dancing at halftime and they have cussing going on and they have their filthy commercials i mean that's milk you shouldn't watch that that's baby stuff right but then what can you watch now we're getting to some meat now now we're getting to some meat praise god because there are there are some things that don't hinder you right you but then you got to be careful because there could be commercials there could be cuss words there could be some type of contrary spirit right so that's what a mature christian is interested in he's interested in eating the meat of the word not just the milk but church let me let me say uh i'm thankful for milk how many like milk i know where's victoria she ought to be raising her hand most days she'll walk up and say daddy can i whisper in here i'm like wha what do you need you got me some milk yeah i'll get it cause i'm tired you know i gotta serve her better hey man victoria i'm gonna serve you better sometimes there's a good time when i get home there it is a husband wants to love his wife and children help me lord to do better praise god but church milk is good i like milk every now and then nice drink of milk so what is milk milk is repenting from dead works you need to repent and get baptized right faith toward god you need to believe god that's a milk doctrine right but it's good we need that right we need reminders of that baptisms you need a water baptism and a holy ghost baptism just knowing that those milk just knowing that laying on of hands if you're sick the bible said lay hands on the sick they shall recover that's great that's it that's what happened this weekend amen uh resurrection from the dead the saints are gonna write resurrect praise god there's two resurrections right the rapture is the first resurrection and the resurrection to the great white throne judgment is the second resurrection that's milk though and then eternal judgment those that are lost are going to be judged eternally they're going to be eventually annihilated and forgotten that judgment will last for all eternity that's milk but how many appreciate the milk that milk helps prepare me for the meat that's right praise god amen i gotta have that milk to build me up so later i can receive the meat praise god amen now later this chapter goes into some real meat right here the bible says in verse four you can partake listen you can partake of the holy ghost and the good word of taste the good word of god and then fall away and crucify the son of god afresh now that's a meat church hallelujah we just went through all the milk oh i love these things are the baptisms and repentance and salvation but now we get down to some meat there's some people that taste of that and they backslide and they crucify jesus afresh or they put him to an open shame so they go out in public and they live a sinful life now they've just partaken of it they've drank the meat i'm sorry they drank the milk but now they're crucifying the very one who gave him the milk praise god that's the meat right there if you can receive that but beloved brother william but beloved i'm persuaded better things of you i know you are persuaded better things than me too right i'm persuaded we're not that kind praise god we're there's better things for you and i things that accompany salvation we're not crucifying the son of god today we're crucifying the five gates of our our flesh praise god we're crucifying the five inlets to the mind praise god that's what we're crucified and we're exalting jesus christ amen in other words i'm the one being crucified not the word the word is living amen i'm crucifying my will my desires my sinful temptations are the sinful uh the sinful things pulling on me i'm crucifying those effects and i'm choosing to obey the word of god that's the meat of god amen hallelujah so don't let anybody fool your church these are uh these are mature things it takes a real mature christian to have all your relationships obedient to the word and ministries because a lot of people don't even know what their ministry is and the church said they don't even know should i fast should i pray should i alms give shall i make clothes what should i do some people don't even know but you need to know praise god brother braham said in one place he said if you're not sure just try it he said just go try witness to somebody see maybe witnessing your ministry it's not preaching it's witnessing right just witnessing and trying to win so that's a ministry but you got to be obedient just like a preacher i can preach but i want to be preaching what jesus wants me to preach amen not that what i want not some of my own personal vendettas or something like that revenge tour or something like that i don't want to be on a revenge tour i want to be on a salvation tour amen i'm going to be on a victory tour where people can get victory and we can break the curses of the past amen and live in the blessings of god living all those spiritual blessings in christ jesus amen hallelujah that's the one we got to make sure we got to make sure that we're doing the right job god wants us to do like that one guy said brother branham can i own uh can i own a jukebox remember this is back in the 60s when they had jukeboxes i was born in 1980 so i remember i remember some jukeboxes at the pizza shop i don't know i used to put quarters in the jukebox and play rock and roll before i was a christian that's sinful right but they asked brother branham in 1964. brother brown can i own a jukebox and let the teenagers come in there and play rock and roll he said no i'd either sell it or get the jukebox out isn't that wisdom that sounds like meat to me well i gotta make money we'll make money some other way you should never make money off the devil right don't let the devil pay you let god reward you amen work for god honor god in church i promise you if you honor god god will pour out the blessings he'll open up the windows of heaven if you just honor him praise god make sure you're living and you possess that land hallelujah amen everything i put my hand to god is blessed as long as i've honored him financially whatever my job everything i put my hand to god has blessed it hallelujah like i was telling sabrina except for the principle i try to get three principal jobs and each time they turn me down but after i saw what happened to covet i'm glad i wasn't a principal those guys averaged about 20 percent more white hairs last year i want to keep all the black i got no i'm just kidding no it really was a lot of pressure a lot of stress way too many they basically didn't have a family life for a whole year i'm glad i wasn't a principal so i think it was god protecting me also i don't think i'm smart enough either that's just my that's just my honest opinion honestly church you can ask my wife i'm not that smart no and then location church location is god calls you to akron or not are you running from the past are you hoping to leave but god wants you to stay or does god want you to go you got to know thus saith the lord in other words god's got to guide you and lead you and bless you and show you you're in the right place to live praise god and where you live is just like abraham said god told abraham you'll be blessed and you'll be a blessing whenever it's god's will when you're in god's will you'll see god bless you through other people and then you will bless other people amen just like father abraham praise god how many children of abraham do we have here tonight that have faith in jesus christ amen that blessing still pertains to you amen he said the blessing of abraham will impact every nation all nations that includes the us we're blessed because of abraham amen so we keep god's word and that's just a quick review now brother says we're talking to spiritual canaanites he says that the spiritual israelis possess the land aren't you glad you come out of egypt's guard so you don't eat the world's foods anymore i'm talking about lusts and sin and smoking and drinking and cussing and like i used to do all those movies and i used to do all that right we don't eat that anymore we got a holy diet i've got a holy man's taste now i can't stomach those old things like that they'll corrupt you he said aren't you glad you come out of egypt's garlic aren't you glad you're out of the wilderness ah i'm touched we're not wandering around where am i going where am i going am i in the right place should i go over here shall i go over there i know right where i'm at praise god i know right where god wants me to be i know exactly what i'm doing i possess god's inheritance for me praise god i'm not wondering from one church to the next or one idea to the next or what if this is right i wonder if that's right we're not wonders the bible said cain was a wandering star he wandered around because he was mocked by the beast but we're people that know their position they know where god's called us and we're doing exactly like abraham we're taking the land that god gave us amen that's right and remember they had to eat manna angels food out of heaven until they crossed over in the land and when they crossed over the land the man has ceased to fall they were fully matured then and they eat the old corn of the land now now that you're not babies anymore now that you're not desiring the sincere milk of the gospel you don't have to be babied and patted and persuaded to come to church now that you're really fully mature christians you're ready to eat some strong meats now hallelujah you're ready to come into something he said you're ready to understand something that's deep and rich hallelujah also when you're born again you have a clear understanding brother bram said how many received the holy ghost aren't you glad you're in the land over here now eating the old corn eating the strong things of god and you got a clear understanding your spiritual mind is all unmuddled up in other words it's all cleared up muddled is dirty so unmuddled is clear it's all cleared up you know exactly now look you know exactly who god is it's not buddha it's not allah amen praise god it's jesus christ that's who god is amen like we talk with those hindus it's jesus christ praise god there's only one holy book praise god there's only one god amen there's only one media between god and man there's only one high priest in heaven that's god's son jesus christ amen all these other gods are false in their lives and their devils amen disguised as angels of light but we know exactly who god is amen we got a clear understanding and you know exactly where you're going i'm going to eat more meat praise god hallelujah i'm going to possess all those areas of my land that's where i'm going i'm going up yonder to the rapture too i'm going to heaven as well praise god i know exactly where i'm going i'm not going to ecumenical council and just so sabrina knows i don't know if she's ever heard this the bible tells us thus saith the lord there's going to be a one world religion at the end time so just so sabrina knows now and it's going to be headed up by the pope so you and i we all need to stay a million miles away from denominations because the pope is going to unite all the denominations together you can see it now look at all the people caving to the vaccine mandates that's just a vaccine that's a natural thing what about the spiritual mark what about the spiritual mark when they touch your bank account now it's just you lose your job you can go get another job but it's coming to the spot where you can't not get another job and you can't even buy food unless you have their mark but thank god the bible said that those who have the seal of god jesus will rescue them he'll keep them from the day of wrath praise god he will rescue them he'll meet them in the air jesus christ will meet his wife in the air praise god amen jesus said because you kept the word of my patience in revelation 3 10 he said i will keep you from the our temptation that comes upon the whole face of the earth amen in other words we will not be here if we're born again we will not be here when they lay down that mark we're gonna miss it praise god say thank you lord amen hallelujah so we're just seeing all this vaccine stuff it's just prefigured to the mark of the beast that's all it is so we got to be able to know what god's calling us to do i'm still not getting that vaccine you've heard about it people their body parts are messed up a woman died last week a healthy woman died after getting the vaccine last week i don't know why all my friends nobody gets sick i don't know i don't understand that but it's just it's awful that these things happen i'm not going to get it he says you wouldn't know exactly where you're going you know exactly all about it so you can tell me a lot about where you're going praise god you know in whom you believed and persuaded that jesus is able to keep that which you've committed to him against the day in other words you and i have committed our souls to god for that day lord i just want everything to be right on that day i've committed all my all my past all my present on my future i put all of me my soul is in your hands and i'm trusting that you'll receive me on that day praise god you know all about it you remember when you did it you remember when it happened praise god you know where you're going you know who god is praise god you know all about it when you're born again hallelujah oh that's the one that paul is talking to now these mature believers they feast on mature food and they have a clear understanding now this is the scripture where paul says i'll just skip down here for i he says he's not ashamed of jesus right for i know whom i have believed he knew he believed jesus and i'm persuaded he's able to keep that which i have committed unto him against that day what did paul have to commit to him all the murders that he was responsible for he was guilty of all those murders all the beatings of all those christians he had to commit that to god lord i i still feel guilty at times i know you've forgiven me but i'm committing that to you that your word is true your word says you'll forgive all my transgressions amen come under your blood and all unrighteousness will be taken away from me and your righteousness you've given it to me praise god you have to commit that to god my past glory my past i committed to jesus amen i'm not going to worry about it i'm not going to stew over i've committed to him i put it in the hands of the nail scarred hands amen amen and that proves he died to forgive my past amen my past is in his head but thank god my future's in his hands i don't know you praise god amen that's exactly right church so that's what you should be as a mature christian you know where you come from you know all about it you know where you're going you know you're god that's right the only way to know god though is know his word so that means we're bible readers praise god also when you're in that land church you are subject and ready to serve god in any way that's why you should be open to a prayer ministry that's why you should be open to a clothing ministry that's why you should be open to a fasting ministry right because when you're in there you can you're so in love with jesus you'll do whatever he says you should do praise god remember brother said he said friday is my fast day brother bran would not eat on fridays because that was the day leading into his weekend services right saturday night sunday sunday morning sunday night services he had a day where he had to consecrate that was a ministry of his fasting hallelujah so you got to be subject to that praise god brother man says if you want a successful ministry you got to pray for the preachers that's right and then the preachers got to pray for you right we pray for one another praise god so we have to be so in love with each other that we pray for one another hallelujah see my when i get in this land it's mine i'm home now i'm in canaan it may not look like canaan but brother william i'm in canaan hallelujah i'm subject to anything god wants to use me for if god wants me to make youtube videos i'll make youtube videos now it's easy to say that because i've already made about 80. but if god would want me to stop that i can do something else right whatever god would have me to do we want to be subject lord what are you leading me to do now i want to hear your voice and church the way you know remember again brother explained it the way you know it's god's will is if it aligns up with all the word of god and you have a burden to do it and it's the right timing as well you kind of narrowed it down to those in that that quote with brother uh perry green he said make sure it lines up with those three it's got to be in god's right timing and if he calls you to do something that involves money then god will already provide it you want to beg nobody for nothing right how many emails do i get of people begging me for money overseas all the time i get them all the time so i send them a little bit and i never hear back from them anymore like one guy told me recently he said i want you to mentor me i want you to do all these things i said well how much money do you want well i'm sorry i didn't say i just said i'll just send you a hundred dollars i never heard back from after after got the money he never wanted me to mentor him anymore because he wasn't after the mentor and he's after the money praise god but jesus said let yourself be used he said pray for those who despitefully use you amen amen bless those who curse you amen now we're talking christianity amen be good to those who are bad to you oh yeah now we're talking about real maturity now we're talking about some meat now brother william shoot on that one for a little bit i love that one yeah they they cussed me out they said all these things i'm say god bless you anyway right and pray for them and mean it god's able to do it praise god because he's got supernatural strength you'll feel the power come upon you amen just crucify that flesh crucify those old feelings and talk to them if they hurt you talk to them but then you'll feel the love of god come over your heart praise god and you'll be able to say that i love you i forgive you i i'm not going to look at that anymore god bless you hallelujah i'm subject to anything god wants to use me for praise the lord whatever god would want me to use me for he said i'm walking on holy ground i'm a child of the king i'm all robed and ready to go that means my garments are white that means i just repented of all my sins right i got nice clean garments they're not wrinkled they don't have blood stains on them or my sins they're not dirty they're fresh out of the cleaners amen they just wash them in the blood of jesus amen hallelujah just got them fresh back from the cleaners amen i've come out of egypt i'm coming through the promised land i stood the trials i passed over jordan into this blessed promise oh how did i get it by one spirit the same way paul got it acted on me the same way it did on him same way it did on you by one spirit we're all baptized not sprinkled just a little sprinkle of it feel pretty good but immerse under all made to swim under in the holy ghost that's the promise amen hallelujah we're swimming in it we're enjoying being a christian is that how you feel your life you're just swimming in god's blessings you're just like a dolphin under there or something like that you're like a dolphin and you're just enjoying the waters and just breezing through here it's so wonderful i'm just in god's land and i'm thankful wherever god wants to take me he can take me because i'm a child of the king amen hallelujah i do whatever my daddy says amen whatever pop of god tells me that's what i'll do praise god amen that's right if god give you a can i just say this if god give you an orphanage ministry do an orphanage ministry right or adoption ministry there's preachers that uh in pennsylvania in the message that did adoption ministry for like 20 years they would take they would just adopt kids in and fill up their houses and take them to church they weren't allowed to spank them they had to obey the laws of man but they some of them got saved had they not been in the house who knows maybe they not what i would have got saved i think i know my god pretty well i think my god put it on their heart to have a ministry for foster children hallelujah so they could hear the word of god because i know my god pretty well he don't do anything haphazardly he always planned he's got everything planned out oh he he's always on time there's no mistakes with god amen he's ordered your step he's ordered everything in his word amen hallelujah that's right now here's one i like creating the atmosphere of heavenly places this is what we did this past weekend right when you clap when you smile when you praise god when you cry when you feel god and you respond to god that's creating an atmosphere this is the same holy spirit tonight he said is ministering to us the same blessings here we're blessed with all spiritual blessing that's ephesians 1 3 right in heavenly places oh let's just stop here for one minute in heavenly places now just not out anywhere but in heavenly places we are assembled in heavenly it means the position of the church of the believer now look then if i'm falling asleep no then if i'm so stuffed from overeating at the buffet nope no if i'm prayed up you're prayed up or the church is prayed up we're ready for the sermon see sometimes we're not ready praise god but we're ready this weekend hallelujah sometimes we're not ready the way to get ready is to pray and ask god to forgive all your sins and church remember that you're only going to be full if you pull it's not fake it till you make it it's pulled to your foe praise god one time a preacher told me that he said what are we supposed to do just fake it till you make it i'm like no i said you're supposed to bring your body into subjection i mean you got to move your body your body doesn't want to move you got to move your body but that's called pulling that's not called faking it it's making your body the sin nature obey the holy nature amen right so pull till you're full don't leave here half empty or half full don't leave here with nothing leave here full on god's love and his power and his word leave here with the heart that loves christ it's up to you it's up to me if i'm prayed up you're afraid of we're ready for the preaching we have assembled ourselves together as saints called out baptized with the holy ghost filled with god's blessings called elected set together in heavenly places now in heavenlies in our souls cam said that three times i listened to his sermon he said it three times on saturday night he said i'm just in heavenly places because he was that was the most excited i've seen him in a long time that means you guys were singing you were praying you're ready you're pulling on the word a lot like tonight amen see our spirits has brought us into a heavenly atmosphere oh brother there you are a heavenly atmosphere this ain't a work atmosphere this ain't the ballpark atmosphere which i was used to right this ain't a bar atmosphere this ain't a party atmosphere this is a heavenly atmosphere and what do you see in heaven you see angels crying holy holy holy lord god almighty which was and is and it never stops the praises never stop that's our life as a christian we keep praising god we exalt jesus we worship jesus now we're talking about heaven when we come to church and everybody wants to praise god amen i don't want to stop i just want to keep praising the lord i'm going to keep saying amen to his word i'm going to keep thanking jesus i'm going to keep praying for people i want to keep singing now we're getting there now we're getting to heavenly places in christ jesus hallelujah oh brother there you are a heavenly atmosphere remember don't take an hour prayer it don't even take 30 minutes of prayer although that's a good number i mean you just got to come prayed up your faith has to be up and not down and the church said you want your faith up like i know god's going to move i know god's going to speak to me i know god's going to bless me i know god's gonna do something special tonight i know he's gonna just minister to me i know he's gonna be with me he's gonna show me his love i want to worship him too your faith is up and then the blessings come down hallelujah heavenly places in christ jesus he said oh what could happen tonight see that's why last week was so beautiful brother benjamin brought those uh sabrina and chrissette it was so beautiful it was totally led of the holy ghost because i think it was the first time chrissette really heard the gospel right it was so led in the lord naomi was telling me how the holy spirit was working on the girls and how she was praying about her girls wanting to be baptized for a while and just had to let the holy ghost work it out so see last week all these we had visitors and everybody was pulling and the heavenly atmosphere dropped down and three souls were saved amen last wednesday night we ought to we ought to shout praise the lord ready praise the lord three souls officially gave their hearts to jesus christ and now there's a place in heaven for them now it was always there right but now they know now they know they know exactly who their god is they know exactly where they're going praise god now they know they've got a place in heaven because they met god's requirements amen repent and be baptized hallelujah in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost amen how often does that happen don't happen to her like that on wednesday night so see we got into heavenly places last week people were sincere they were really listening they were pulling they were saying amen people were praying that's how we get a heavenly atmosphere see it doesn't have to always be a supernatural miracle although we thank god for those those are awesome but there's no greater miracle than a soul being saved because you could be healed and you could get sick again you could die but then you're just dead right but when your soul is saved you go from death to life and jesus said when you believe in me you passed from death unto life and there's no going back praise god when you get born again you're sealed to the day of your redemption brother you were here to see it too brother that's the that that's how i know it was led to the holy ghost you were here to see it brother all right on time right on god's time peace he's always right on time praise god what does it look like church the holy spirit spirit's moving over just a preacher's heart no you know you don't believe that every heart that's been regenerated and become a new creature all sins are under the blood jesus forgive me my thoughts forgive me of my words forgive me if i mistreated that brother sister he said we're in perfect worship with our hands up to god our hearts lifted setting together in heavenly places in christ jesus worshiping together in the heavenly places did you ever set in one i like to hear a response did you ever set one yeah we were there last wednesday night yeah we're there last sunday we're there last saturday night it's so wonderful you don't even want to leave because you're just enjoying all this holy heavenly atmosphere we're singing the hymn of heaven hallelujah we're singing songs of heaven heaven has come down and we're in the prance of god and we enjoy the blessings of god in this presence did you ever set one oh i love sitting there oh i've sat till i would weep for joy and say god never let me leave here just heavenly places in christ jesus when randy was here i i think naomi remembers this i mentioned it i thought to mention this last week randy was here i don't think he preached two hours something like that it felt like five minutes and then i think eden had a fever was it eden okay eden had a fever and sister didn't know me brought her up brought her up for prayer would you bring her up or did did she stay back there okay yeah she brought her up my brother randy you know he's preached two hours it was just a heavenly atmosphere i was i remember i was weeping and crying i think it was on a friday night it's on a friday night i was weeping and just rejoicing it was kind of like this i think i said after service i don't want to close this service this is so wonderful it's hard to close it i i like this i'll say can we sing another how about just one more one more let's just do one more right is that how you feel sometimes somebody like come on jess let's just sing another song brother come on but that's how it was that night well eden was sick and naomi brought her up and prayed for her and we were concerned right we're concerned i was and mrs naomi said as soon as they got out i think was on the parking lot no right there as soon as they got done praying the fever broke now that's jesus material that's jesus works right there because jesus laid his hands on peter's wife and the fever went ah who visited us there was more than brother randy that visited us amen heaven visited us amen jesus christ visited us and instantly cast that demon out in jesus christ's name where are we sitting tonight the same place heavenly places in christ jesus praise god when all of our hearts are in one mind we're prayed up we're one accord all the sins are confessed saints we are in the presence of the king and that don't prove it to you i don't know what will praise god sometimes we're looking for such big things we miss god putting it right in our face and god's like this we're like i like to see i like to see like a tornado or something god's like i just heal the fever come on church we got to open our eyes praise god did you ever send one i send them all the time that's why i'm a christian because i want to live in heavenly places i don't love this world the bible said if you love the world and the things of the world then the love of god is not even in you we love jesus so jesus's presence is here heaven is here you should love it praise god amen where do we get blessings of what he says blessings of what divine healing we had that for knowledge god will foretell us something to come i don't see that one too much but i'm sure we get we've had it before i know we've had with dreams dreams and foretold things that are going to happen revelation out of the word we get them all the time cam brought a great revelation on zion that's a revelation from the word that's beautiful saturday night he says visions right i don't see many visions but i've seen maybe one i think in my life powers any supernatural blessing of power tongues we don't see many of those that's okay it's not the evidence of the holy ghost a christian life is the evidence of the holy ghost a life that lives just like jesus that's the evidence of the holy ghost because that's what he was filled with i've seen a lot of people speak in tongues and go get divorced and marry again and cuss and swear and live in the world that proves that they're the ones crucifying the son of god afresh they just got enough anointing to get a gift operating but then they didn't get their soul saved they just sat under that and said oh this is good and then they did something supernatural yeah god did it but if god doesn't get in their heart then they're not saying praise god they gotta let god all the way and you gotta love god with all your heart soul minded strength amen hallelujah wisdom interpretations knowledge all the heavenly blessings joy unspeakable and full of glory every heart filled with the spirit walking together setting together in heavenly places not one evil thought among us not one evil thought among it if you got one just cast it aside say forgive me jesus i'm focusing on you right now not one cigarette smoked not one short dress right not one this or other because a short dress where they're trying to they're trying to tempt men that's what that's why they got him up so high they're trying to tempt the men right they're not trying to glorify god with that they're trying to attempt the men just like a man that i walked in the giant eagle yesterday no kidding this man had arms that were about this big i was taller than him and he's got his shirt off and his big muscles bulging out i'm like well who's he trying to impress i mean he's trying to catch the ladies i mean come on dude see same thing a man or woman can have that love spirit on him right but not among us amen not among us amen we put all the focus all the attention is on loving jesus amen right you don't want other people's attention you want their attention on jesus that's why we dress holy right no but look at this not one evil thought nobody got anything against one another that's right hallelujah that's how you get heavenly places that's right and remember if they hurt your church just go to them let's go to them i told you about a brother i was mentoring he went and talked to one person this week that that he had offended for years and apologized and he said the person wouldn't receive it so he kept saying no i am sorry i've done this and that and finally they received it and he said he felt so much better that's the way to be clean church that's like taking a bath right because your mind you feel all dirty because you've got this against that person you're so upset but if you go make that right now you just took a bath i'm clean i'm walking the blessings of god and he thanked me he said thank you for your mentoring it's leading me into more love i said well that's exactly what the bible is supposed to do praise god you'll know they're my disciples because their love one for another praise god see that takes real christianity that's meat though that's me that's that's real meat right there going to a person who's offended you or you've offended them that's real meat everybody speaking in love and harmony everybody with one accord in one place then suddenly they're coming from heaven a sound like a rushing mighty wind there you are has blessed us with all spiritual blessings amen hallelujah praise god so we got to get all prayed up we got to get all of our sins confessed we got to live right we gotta have all the right motives and objectives and then when we're together we're all happy loving and then the holy ghost will fall praise god amen hallelujah like last week i'm trying to remember when it fell right right at the end i think i think everybody was really amen really hard at the asher's blessings right and i felt the holy ghost fall and that's why i said i got a cast in that do they want to be baptized whenever we have guests i always ask them if they want to be baptized well this time it was nature and virtue right and then chrissette came up so he waited till that holy spirit fell at church i've done that many times i've offered many times for people to be baptized and they don't respond well how come they respond this time because the people love god heavenly laces they want these hearts already the hearts have been prepared to receive the seed seed of preaching from good ground it wasn't waste ground it wasn't stony ground it wasn't cares of the world ground it's the good ground amen which means an honest and good heart and then when it falls on that it'll produce good fruit thank you jesus now here's here's the maturity right here this is a real church this is what i believe we're growing to i believe that for all 15 years i've been a pastor i'm going to keep believing as long as i'm a pastor then the holy spirit will fall on somebody and say thus saith the lord go to a certain place do a certain thing watch it happen just like that that is real christianity right there thus saith the lord do a certain thing in a certain place watch it happen like that bless us together in all heavenly places in christ jesus i've seen that in my life i've seen that maybe three or four times in a church three or four times in a church i've seen that once here but i wasn't here i heard about it on the tape when i was out right we had a brother come in 2011 and he said thus saith the lord he said the holy spirit i remember he said the holy spirit says some of you are spiritually dying you better repent and get right so i went up after that he did a tongue interpretation i went through the church and i texted everybody and said was anybody spiritual spiritually dying and i found three people that said they were spiritually dying and they were gonna get their hearts right with god and all three not all three are here anymore but all three are still in the message church see they took heed to the warning it was thus saith the spirit they were spiritually dying and if they don't do something they're going to die that means go to hell that's right right and all three obeyed and all three are still serving the lord amen so that's one of the closest i've seen i've also seen at the lima church there was a sister that got the holy ghost on her and she said thus saith the lord she called this brother's name allahu allahu you did this this and that and he come up crying and he repented of his sins that was a long time ago that's probably 2005 2006 called him by name and there's because he was out pardoning or something the night before and that sister called it out she didn't even know nothing about it and he come up crying now he don't serve the lord right now but he he's tried before but he just gets in the world so see church how we want to be more mature see if we come to church expect something like that we probably see more happen right but that's why that's why god gives us grace to grow amen that's why it's good to pray before the service amen that's why it's good to pray for the servants to pull during the service praise god you don't know what's gonna happen you never know when those little lambs are to come back into the fold amen you never know when god's going to call the lambs and go get the lambs he puts you on his shoulder that's what the bible says when you got saved last week jesus you were wandering away jesus picked you up put you on his shoulders and he carried you back to all of us same thing for virtue and nature they jesus picked you up put put you on the strongest spot his shoulders and carry you now with all the spiritual blessings in christ jesus amen you're not wondering girls you made it home praise god amen hallelujah jesus brought you home i didn't hear you i remember when he brought me home too that was a glorious day oh hallelujah thank god amen 19 years of wandering away but finally before the 20th year jesus saved me he redeemed me and he carried me back to the fold amen thank god and i've been here ever since hallelujah i haven't left i'm staying i'm a sheep praise god and he's my shepherd praise god let me try to finish here one time i one time i didn't say thus saith the lord but i was preaching on saul it was actually in this room right here right when we moved in here i was preaching on king saul he was how he was denominational and he disobeyed god and a brother crying in that parking lot right out there he grabbed me and said jesse you just preached my whole life he said i was just arrested for child abuse and i'm going to the jail he said i did exactly what you said what uh what king saul did and so i prayed for him i know he got out eventually he's out now i haven't had much contact with him but that was thus saith the lord to him because in prison he could have chose the wrong way right a lot of people do that right but if god's grace is with you he'll be with you in the prison too his grace don't fail in the prison hallelujah because we were all in a spiritual prison amen and jesus never left us he never forsook us but it goes to show many times we receive the word of god we just got to be humble enough and prayed up enough to receive it that's right as i guess you know i could think of more and more times like that or some of those things have happened now let me close with this church right now you see it you know there's just amongst our churches sometimes there's just differences right and some brothers don't fellowship with other brothers some sisters don't fellowship with other sisters and brother william we appreciate this i'm sure brother brahm said thus saith the lord god is going to break down denominational barriers before the rapture before he raptures the bride okay i'm not going to read all this we talked about solomon didn't need any tools he says god see that but god is cutting out everywhere born again children of god to bring them together he says someday those denominational barriers and ideas that fanatics has got up there scooped around separate the people will be taken away god will bring his church together and take it home just as certain as anything in the world that's gonna it's gonna come that's prophecy remember i spoke that i spoke that in the name of the lord you can write that down in your book now that was true now it's a very general prophecy but it's still prophecy that means god has holy ghost-filled saints that have some denominational thoughts among them can just admitted he had some i'm sure i've had some there can be holy ghost-filled people and get a denominational thought all denominational thought is is the thought of man instead of god that's all it is oh we're gonna do this because man says this is good right cam was given examples about like young people's nights which it's okay to have that but you better make sure it's a letter of the lord amen not just copying the world right because some of those churches came talked about they have those uh young people nights some of those young people slip away and they commit sexual sin while everybody else is you know at the media or the game or whatever they'll slip off and they've had problems with that over the years how is that led of the lord let's not let the lord because it was led the lord god would bless it amen amen god would bless it so it's the thought of man it's denominational but not a church and he says long now look how many ever heard of preachers argued and fussing if you as long as you argue and fuss you're in kindergarten he says god will just keep you there till you learn enough to get out in other words you're going to drink milk you're not going to eat the meat of god's word if you're just going to argue and fuss and just try to be smarter try to be better than somebody else instead of saying you're sorry or saying you know what's okay you believe different that's fine i love you anyway god's gonna keep you in kindergarten remember and he used the example in the bible days jesus disciples saw people casting out devils he said you can't cast out devils you're not part of our group and jesus said forbid them not so the preachers had denominational spirit if you're not in my group you shouldn't be doing it right that's brother brahma's example he said if they won't join up don't forbid him go on that's the way to do it so see denominational spirits are trying to control people and make them do what you want them to do instead of letting them do what god has called them to do so denominational spirits are trying to control you that's what all the denominations do they control you we've seen it they control you in a church service right we've he and i have visited 11 churches over the last two months and they control everybody you can only do what they say only do what that's it that's all you can do just what the creed says do what the creed says do what the the flyer says right just stay with that you can't do anything else outside of that that's a creed that's a denominational spirit now how many member polycarp polycarp was a student of john the divine the one who wrote first john 2 john 3 john and then book of revelation he wrote the book of revelation john wrote the book of revelation but his disciple under him was polycarp he was such a godly man church look what history says about him when they killed him he was killed for being a christian they didn't even have the time to the stake he was such a man of god he just stood there by the stake and said set me on fire they set him on fire the fire moved away from his body because he was such a holy man and it refused to touch him because god was showing i've got i got my anointing on this man he was then pierced through with a sword as this was done water gusts from the side drowning the flames so that water put out the flames his spirit was actually seen to depart in the form of a white dove released from his bosom what a saint yes he said you don't have to tie me just burn me i'll die for jesus whether you're tying me down or not what a saint he was such a man of god everybody saw the miracles around him and yet and then he had a dove fly out of his body praise god in other words his soul left like a dove amen just like it came down as enough on jesus christ amen yet for all this testimony the student of john the revelator was not militant against nicolaitan for he himself leaned towards organization not realizing the desire for fellowship would appear like a good plan to foster the work of god was really a trick of the enemy in other words he said a pastor has more authority than over just his local church let's stand to our feet i'm gonna stop right there and i'm gonna tell this story you can stop the livestream here now this is quite
