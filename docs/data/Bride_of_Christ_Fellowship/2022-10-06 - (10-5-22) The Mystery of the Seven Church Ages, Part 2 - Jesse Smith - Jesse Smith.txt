TRANSCRIPT
========================================
it looks like we're live by God's grace want to read our live streamers whenever they get on information one verse 20. you know Sunday night we looked at how the Bible says the history of God must be finished praise God yeah so we're grateful we're living in a time that we know the revelation of the mysteries of God but we also know the great responsibility Paul says you can understand all Mysteries but without love you're nothing so we're reviewing these because they're so crucial because Jesus revealed them so we want to have both we want to have both Revelation and want to have the love of God in our hearts praise God so that's our great desire Hallelujah Revelation chapter 1 verse 20 let's read that one together and we'll have a short word of prayer I could be seated here by God's grace let's read that on three one two three of the Seven Stars which a thousand stars in my right hand and the Seven golden candlesticks the son of the Stars Are Not Angels of the seven churches and the Seven candlesticks which thou saws are the seven churches amen the smart heads for one more word of prayer we know faith comes by here and hearing by the word of God so if you have a need on your heart let's just make an honor to God let's pray together here by the grace of God Heavenly Father it feels so good to be in your house here tonight Lord away from the things of the world we are shunning with God in a secret place here in the spirit be holding your face to your God hallelujah we want to gain new power to run in this race oh yes how we long to be shutting with God thank you God for this opportunity thank you God for for giving us our sins hearing our prayers here tonight but we know you are faithful we know you keep your word Lord yeah we're so grateful for that despite our fails or when we confess Lord God you forgive us our sins and Lord you will help us to walk in the light as you're in the light we thank you for this opportunity tonight Lord bless each and every one here Lord God our visitor brother Randy Lord and and father all the saints and oppressed they were to the house of God minister to each and every one may Faith come by here and Lord you speak through our hearts here tonight just use me Lord you can take me off my notes God uh I prepared Lord the best I know how father we just ask God that he would speak to us here tonight in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said praise God looking at Revelation chapter 1 verse 20 is where we started here I'm just going to briefly review uh uh last night or last week rather so in case you're the dots on there like two or three dots is that a lot do you know is that okay not really okay so I guess well it's probably got to be better than Sunday's service there's hardly any volume on that at all so praise the Lord so we just started this short series last Wednesday night I'm gonna try to Be watchful all the time here by God's grace as well I got to get some good rest of them I'm gonna rest my throat it all back uh pretty bad thing when you get you know a throat issue you're a school teacher and a preacher and you just talk all day so you know I really need God's grace amen you saw last week uh the Lord Jesus uh here gives John The Book of Revelation which means a book of disclosure it's a book of unveiling in other words so he's unveiling uh the the true leader of the world the lord Jesus Christ and the true bride Hallelujah the true groom and the true bride Hallelujah and then also in the Book of Revelation we have we have Satan he's the false god of this world and he has a false bride mystery Babylon right Hallelujah and our brothers said he's Protestant so I'm sure he knows who mystery Babylon is because we're protesting mystery Babylon hallelujah we're protesting the pope of Rome Hallelujah because we are Protestants by the grace of God so uh we saw how uh Revelation is a laying bear and it's making known prophecy Hallelujah and so we saw the confusion is a lot of people wonder about the Book of Revelation but Jesus leaves no confusion about it it's just that people are confused they want to know are the seven angels literal Angels or people or men and then they Wonder were these letters to the seven churches were they just applying to those churches only or did they have other applications well the Revelation is is that the Angels were actually men that Jesus would send to preach to Future ages amen praise God and the application though of the seven churches is threefold the letters of that that Jesus wrote and gave to John they were literally to those seven churches right at that time right but they were also prophetic of the future ages and if you look real closely they also apply to your my individual walk with God that's right true okay which we'll get to tonight by the grace of God so some people only will say Well they're only for those churches uh in 95 or 180 with what they miss out on actually what Jesus Was preparing the church for Jesus Was preparing the church for 2 000 years of battles he was preparing he was saying this is what's going to happen and I'm going to give over I'm going to give all the Believers oh power to overcome Satan at the gates of hell would not Prevail against them because in each of the seven letters he said to the Overcomer I promise then that's right the the star Hallelujah uh the North Star praise God the North Star I promised the star where the star was it morning sorry sorry I'm a little tired too as well so we're getting I promise you the Morning Star all right a new name praise God hallelujah there's so many rewards he said rules are out of iron uh to sit on my throne and judge as Jesus as my father has given me Jesus the opportunity to judge and each age would have a group that would overcome Satan and they would be the true examples of Christianity for their age praise God right right and so we looked at uh we looked at a number of proofs last week we saw uh the first proof that these Angels were not Heavenly Angels because Jesus said unto the Angel Church of Ephesus right why would Jesus have John write a letter to Heavenly Angels when he just can he could just address that they all got to present themselves Before the Throne right so he would not uh tell John write a letter to Gabriel right it doesn't make any sense right write a letter uh to gate to Wormwood right or Mark Michael write a letter to Michael that makes no sense right you don't find that in the scripture true second though you do see men are called angels in the King James version amen we believe we say with love but all the other versions are corrupt right because they've all either either added to the Bible or taken away from the Bible right we can prove that by the scripture there's a lot of a lot of many examples there um David is called an angel praise God yes uh numerous times um let's see uh Paul's called an angel in Galatians 4 14 and John actually gets this Revelation from an angel or one of the servants the prophets praise God so that's where John gets us from also God always uses men to save men God doesn't use angels to save men God uses men to save men to save their souls to preach the word of God true fourth nor is the location where are the Seven Stars located in the hand of Christ praise God and that's his power and authority and angels are not given that right hand of power but the Bible says it's not given to angels in Hebrews 1 verse 13. Hallelujah but we know he would give that power to redeemed son and daughters of God humans Jesus said when you receive the Holy Ghost you'll receive power to be my Witnesses right amen and then lastly we ended with this last Wednesday night so here's the end of my review here uh Abraham's seed are referred to as stars in Genesis 15 verse 5 and Daniel 12 3 Likens the saved unto stars as well he says they'll turn many to the righteousness as the Stars forever and ever and Jesus called John the Baptist a burning and shining star a burning and Shining Light in John chapter 5 verse 35. so there's five Vindicated proofs that when when Jesus told John to write letters to and tell these angels it wasn't Heavenly Angels it was Messengers that God would send through uh through their mothers through the womb and they be they be they come out to the world and speak in lies and they be sinners from the room but then they would experience the salvation of Jesus Christ they'd be redeemed and when they were redeemed it would be like Isaiah the coal fire would touch their mouths and then they could be God's Messengers on the Earth Isaiah said who will go for us uh and and then he then he gets the call on his on his lips and the Bible says I'll go then John or Isaiah said I'll go for you praise God Amen I'll go for us praise God thank the Lord now part two tonight uh Jesus interprets these seven golden candlesticks as seven churches and notice they're all Gentile churches they're not Jewish cities they're Gentile they're Gentile cities and Gentile churches that's because about 50 years prior the Bible said God blinded the Jews and now he was getting a bride from the Gentiles amen hallelujah that's wrong 50 A.D you can find that in Acts 13 and Romans 11. God had to Blind the Jews so he could save the Gentiles Hallelujah and Jesus calls this in Luke 21 24 the times of the Gentiles we are living in the times of the Gentiles in other words this is your time that's right this is my time it's our time to know God it's not somebody else's time don't look at your neighbor saying oh it's your time don't look at yourself and say it's my time amen this is my time church is going to come to an end and we don't know what's going to come to an end so we have to make the best use of our time and you did tonight by coming to the house of God because the Bible says in Luke 4 Jesus was always in the synagogue every time the synagogue was open it was his custom he was always in the house of God and remember Hebrews 10 24 25 Paul said gather more with Saints as you see the day approaching praise God remember Jesus specifically said he was going to take the Kingdom from Israel and give it to the Gentiles in Matthew 12 41. okay so can you pull it up there for us honey I appreciate your Labor of Love Tonight here for us here always diligently helping me out here foreign because they've repented at the preaching of Jonas and behold a greater than Jonas is here that's not the one I wanted here oh it's Matthew 21 you have 12. sorry about that I thought Matthew 21 41. uh says he will miserably destroy those wicked men and will let out his Vineyard unto other there you go yeah other sorry I lost my spot there other husband and there we go which shall render him the fruits in their season now notice did you catch that Seasons right he's going to give the kingdom to other people but they're going to be they're gonna have seasons of that time period that's good we went through a season of Ephesus right went through a season of Smyrna and pergamos and viratira and Sardis of Philadelphia now we're in the season of laodicea and Hallelujah Church isn't wonderful to know that you are the ones bringing forth fruit to God in this season right A lot of people claim to be praying forth first to God but if their hearts are not right they're not bringing forth the right fruit they're actually bringing forth corrupt fruit praise God and Jesus said you'll know them by their fruits right all the preachers that fall in sin all the false Doctrine they're bringing their fruits they're corrupt fruits prove they have corrupt lives amen but when we live a holy life praise God when we Let Jesus clean out our words when we Let Jesus clean out our homes and our habits and our families praise God and we see the power of God moving Our Lives we know we've got the right fruit praise God we know that the the Kingdom's been given to us we've been faithful stewards in the vineyard and Jesus will receive the fruit because it's our season to bring forth fruit praise God Hallelujah and remember what's the fruit of today the fruit of course is the fruits of the spirit but it's also having a hot walk with the Lord we're not lukewarm we're not cold we're hot we're on fire for Jesus hallelujah hallelujah and we have a Zeal to repent in other words I don't have to beg you to repent I'll preach it the holy spirit will deal with you and then you'll repent of it amen is that right that's what Jesus said as many as I love and Revelation 3 14-21 Ivory puke and Chase in Hallelujah we don't Church let's be honest let's not let's not make a that's why we don't have to repent let's repent quickly all the time let's be hot for Jesus let's be on fire let's give him all of our Lives let's bring forth fruit unto God in this season amen Hallelujah now remember Jesus and Paul say the times of the Gentiles have an ending point uh we let's go to Pope Romans 11 25. we already showed you Jesus's uh well we'll probably do that again but let's do a Romans 11 25 first for I would not brother that he'd be ignorant of this mystery unless he should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part is happening to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles become in so every Christian has a desire Lord let the let the gospel be spread to Every Nation let let all those those Saints finally come in all the ones that you know that are going to be saved let them come in Hallelujah so you can be finished and then we can go home and we can be with the Lord praise God see that's our desire we want all the Gentiles that will be saved we want all them to come in praise God that's why we that's why we have to send missionaries praise God that's why we put the videos uh online so they can go all around the world praise God they can minister to people and countries where we don't have money to travel we don't have time to travel but God uses it God's directing his word and God's word is being preached in every nation Hallelujah so there is an end to it uh Pope Luke 21 24 again huh Jesus says Jerusalem shall be trodden down right of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled okay and actually Rome Revelation 11 gives us a better picture about when that's fulfilled so I didn't have this in my notes but let's go to revelation 11. because you'll see you get another clue in Revelation 11. when is this going to be we're all wondering that right Wesley Rapture when's coming to the Lord when's all these things the Bible gives us little Clues no man knows the day or the hour I'll say like this foolish men have tried to predict it down Through the Ages and foolish they're trying to predict it that's true because no man knows today or the hour praise God hallelujah but you know what church what we need today is a dose of wisdom praise God Amen that's what we need today to just trust the Lord to look at the season of The Rapture not worry about the day and the hour but see the season see all the signs with Israel or the signs with earthquakes on the signs with pestilence see all those signs and that just make sure that you're ready to go see men exalt themselves and they try to predict the year or try to predict certain things like that let's not get into that let's be concerned with making sure our lives are lined up with God's word our land for Trend amen amen and they're filled with the oil praise God true all right now it's in Revelation 11 here I didn't didn't have in this amendment or didn't have one in this one in my notes here so I'm gonna look for it real quick here the Bible speaks that uh they'll have access here to the court oh yeah it's verse two sorry staring at the whole time sorry but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure enough for it is given unto the Gentiles and the holy city shall they tread under foot forward in two months or three and a half years so Church it looks like from this I could be wrong I don't know how long uh uh it will take to rebuild the Jewish temple but Jesus said Jerusalem we trotted down until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled and then here once the temple is rebuilt they actually only have control over the temple or the Temple Mount that's what the Bible says now that's during the tribulation we don't know if the building is going to happen before the Rapture or after the Rapture we don't know but Jesus gives these little Clues here when Israel starts getting control over that Temple Mount something's going to happen by God's grace we may see it we may not that's why I said just be ready praise God Amen if you love Jesus you'll be ready Hallelujah okay all right so God is going to keep dealing with us the Gentiles non-jews until the last person comes in now another way to describe the times of the Gentiles is seven Church ages because Jesus lists seven churches not more and not less right right there's only seven churches and he calls the Gentiles his bride on at least three occasions okay you should get ready here honey you got some typing to do Romans 16 16 if you got your Bible Romans 16 16. you can see it there I guess we got to see how fast she can go and we'll see how fast she can turn that's pretty fast salute one another with an holy kiss the Churches of Christ salute you they're Churches of Christ praise God Ephesians 3 21. Ephesians 3 21. I don't know you're getting fast then unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages World Without End Amen in the church everybody say Church ready church church means called out yes to him be glory in the church throughout all ages that means there was ages before Paul that means Paul lived in an age and there's ages after Paul throughout all ages Hallelujah be glory to Christ in his church Hallelujah that's beautiful amen that's good Ephesians 5 23 let's do that one nice for the husband is head of the wife even as Christ is head of the church and he's the savior of the body in this text Paul calls the Believers the church numerous times in fact that's one of the Mysteries I believe it's verse 30 if I'm not mistaken no 32. this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and his church amen you are Christ called out people you are called out Christ sent his voice to call you out of sin that's correct amen the fact you've left sin makes you a part of the real Church of Jesus Christ because a lot of people remain in churches but they remain in sin so it shows they never became a part of the spiritual church it's not so much a natural church it's a spiritual church praise God who's led by the Holy Spirit and Jesus said they're led by the spirit into all truth of the word of God Amen amen that's right so can we call it seven Church ages yes we can see how the the bride the Gentiles are called a church now is the word age in the Bible definitely uh Ephesians 3 500 Ephesians 3 5. which in other Ages was not made known into the sons of men as is now revealed unto His Holy Apostles and Prophets by the spirit okay ages so Paul says this Revelation that the Jew and Gentile or one church was hid from other ages so there's ages past and we just read how there's Asia's future praise God so if there's ages past age is future there must be ages now praise God there always is ages Hallelujah anybody can see that in the natural anybody heard anybody ever heard of the Industrial Age yeah where they got gasoline-powered machines it's egg there's all kinds of Ages praise God the Dark Ages there's all these ages that man Ned recognize it naturally but spiritually there's the same praise God we have spiritual ages Hallelujah and we're able to bring forth fruit to God in our age amen Colossians 1 26 if you go with your cautions 126. I passed it already she's so fast even the mystery with Jeff Beckham from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints praise God Hallelujah and then again we already read Ephesians 3 21 but it said be glory to Christ throughout all ages World Without End so that means there's going to be ages all the way throughout eternity because the world will not have an ending because God's going to bring Eternal quality to his creation to the world so we can live on this Earth eternally praise God that's right now I'm going to say something here and I don't mean to be critical but on the debate you know I was criticized a little bit uh I was told uh brother you add to the Bible and say there's Church ages and I said brother it's right there in the Bible we're called a church and the Bible says there's ages right and he said well bro Jesse you're adding to the Bible I said you're wrong but he was accusing me of adding to the Bible when I wasn't and he was actually the one adding to the Bible because he calls God three persons foreign if you don't know I don't know if Randy knows but the Bible never calls God three persons the word Trinity is not even in the Bible we deny nothing about the fathers and Holy Ghost we just deny the Catholic dogma that changes God's name and his power and his identity it makes him really powerless is what it does by changing his name he loses his power he loses he loses his authority but there's one name above all names there is one name to the father son Holy Ghost that's the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen so the man accusing me of out of the Bible when I'm not is the one adding to the Bible true see I'm saying is he accuser of the brother he's accusing you but he's the one who's guilty watch that now their tires were wrong and we do we do need accusing if we're wrong because we're human but that time I wasn't wrong there's been times I'm wrong I'm human I'm not mistakes God's word is never wrong I'm wrong that's right right I make mistakes I'm human true but you know they they accused me oh Church ages are in the Bible I just showed you where the church I just showed you there's past ages future ages and there's always ages praise God so it's a it's a biblically acceptable term to say times in the Gentiles or seven Church ages Hallelujah all right how am I doing okay good praise the Lord now the church Ages were foretold in numerous ways in the Old Testament of course we know they were foretold by the menorah how many candlesticks had the menorah seven not eight not six no seven praise God and Jesus said Jesus had those seven uh candlesticks the menorah in heaven and he said these seven candlesticks are the seven churches praise God Hallelujah and remember remember there were seven ages in the Old Testament you preached on that you only preached one or two sermons on it I know it's a while ago there were seven ages from the time of David all the way to John the Baptist Seven Ages you can find it right through them right if you just look carefully you can find it right through the scriptures there he was foreshadowing what's going to happen with the Gentiles and now we've had seven Church ages for the Gentiles so it's foreshadowed there it was also foreshadowed in the scripture uh let's see Hosea 6. so if you brought up Hosea 6 verses 1 2 and 3. Come and Let Us return unto the Lord Israel us Israel Hosea is an Israeli Prophet for he hath torn and he will heal us he has smitted and he will bind to some now church if you read them Jeremiah and Ezekiel the Reason God tore them and smoked them because they wouldn't repent in other words we don't we don't go we don't get mad at God when God does something we know God is doing it to chasten us God is trying to get us to repent God's trying to get us to Humble ourselves praise God in other words God does no wrong God has only done us right the Bible says I found it last week in Jeremiah God has done to us less than what we actually deserve in other words we've got less spankings than we actually deserve how we can say Amen to that amen hallelujah he's so merciful he's so gracious mess up I'm sorry he will revive I'm sorry will revive us in the third day he will raise us up and we will live in his sight then we shall know if we follow on to know the Lord his going forth and prepare it as the morning he shall come unto us as the rain as the latter and former Reign unto the earth now we know rain represents the falling of holy spirit amen right on the day of Pentecost Hallelujah the rain fell uh Peter said this is that which Joel spoke of Hallelujah in the last days I'll pour my spirit upon All Flesh aren't you glad Church it got poured out on you praise God hallelujah you might have danced you might have shot and screamed you might have wept your your eyes out you might have spoken tongues you might have prophesied but one thing's for sure the rain fell on you you went from dry to being thoroughly uh purged and saturated or thoroughly saturated with the water of God with the life of God hallelujah amen preaching too loud here for my voice so the two days after two days now a day can represent a thousand years in the Bible second Peter 3 8 you don't pull it up uh because these other one day with the Lord it says a thousand years and a thousand years is one day so in other words God is going to revive Israel that 144 000 Remnant with the Seal of the Holy Ghost after he spends two thousand years with the Gentiles yeah in the third not the second after two days after two thousand years Hallelujah remember now pull up Acts 2 17 honey Peter says the spirit will be poured out in the last days 2 000 years praise God one day is a thousand two days is two thousand I'll pour out my spirit in the last days God has not stopped pouring out his spirit for the last two thousand years praise God he's put it on women he's put it on children he's put on grandmas he's put on Grandpa's he put on you he put on young people hallelujah he's pouring it out all those who want a fresh drink he'll give a fresh drink pouring it out today Hallelujah thank you Lord Paul said it again in the last days perilous times shall come second Timothy 3 1. in the last days days two thousand years has it how many understand the last two thousand years have been a dangerous time for Christians sure right just from the time of Saint Augustine unto the 1800s 68 million Christians were martyred by the Roman Catholic church and that's just what they were able to record that's just what they were able to record and not just one small section of this 2000 year history where Christians have given their lives this has been 2 000 years of trouble sometimes for Christians Hallelujah so we see it in numerous places there in the scripture no Jesus said the churches are I'm sorry the seven candlesticks speak of seven churches we're not going to turn there but uh Exodus 25 shows the menorah seven candlesticks praise God and each one all had Wicks that flowed into the same reservoir of oil oh it's a great lesson right there praise God Amen in other words if we got the Holy Ghost today we got the same holy ghost that Peter had praise amen the same holy ghost that Martin had an iranius praise God hallelujah and John Wesley we got the same Holy Ghost because all seven Church cages were drawing from the same Reservoir the same spirit of God in other words God Is With Us praise God and we've got to call him on the scene praise God amen all seven churches were drolling on the same power right the same oil praise God hallelujah is that what Peter said in Acts 2 verses 38 and 39 he said This Promise is to you your children them that are far off and even as many as the Lord Our God shall call praise God and the gospel must go to all until the fullness of the Gentiles we come in praise God that's the all he's talking about all that are far off I love about Ephesians chapter 2 says or Ephesians chapter 3 the Bible said we were far off from God but what brought us not what brought us out to God was it our church no was it your intellectualism was it my smartness no no the Bible said there's one thing that true is closer to God it was the blood of Jesus Christ amen by the blood of Jesus Christ we have brought we have been brought nigh to the promises of God to the covenants of God thank God we have a savior who sacrificed himself shed his blood and now we're not far off now we're right in the prince of God the Bible said by prayer we can come into the very presence of God almighty the Throne of God hallelujah that's how that's what the blood of Jesus Christ does it takes somebody who's far off it's kind of like bang how he went to get see him praise God she was far off but now she's not hallelujah praise God like honestly they were far off in Arizona but now God brought him not Hallelujah that's what God did spiritually for each and every one of us we were born far from God but God has brought us into the promise of God we are a partaker of the inheritance of the states in line praise God Glory let's read uh Zechariah 4 1 honey Zechariah 4 1. is he oil resents the Holy Spirit we're going to go to Zechariah 4 1 but remember of course Matthew 25 1-13 the parable the ten virgins five had extra oil five didn't so that shows those with the Holy Ghost those with the Holy Spirit go into Jesus's wedding reception praise God true but here's here's where we get the meaning of that symbol the angel that talked with me came again and wake me as a man that's waking out of his sleep verse two and said to me what see us thou and I said I've looked and behold a Candlestick of all gold with a ball upon the top of it and his seven lamps there on and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top they're out verse three and two olive trees behind one upon the right side of the bowl and the other up on the left side of thereof verse four so I answered respect to the angel talked with me saying what are these my Lord verse 5. then the angel had talked with me answered and said to me knowest thou not what these be and I said no my Lord verse 6. then he answered and his fake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zeruba will say not by might not by power but by my oil saith the Lord of hosts did I read that right no but was that what it means yes olive trees Hallelujah producing olives that produce oil praise God oil represents the Holy Spirit we will we will not make the Rapture by our might or our power you didn't make it here tonight by your power amen you didn't become a Christian because of your power or your mind you became a Christian by the holy spirit's power amen God dealing with you drawing with you praise God he's too by Grace not by human effort praise God so the least we can do now that we're saved is give God our effort praise God Peter said give all diligence to make your calling an election sure and Jesus says love me with all your heart soul mind and strength give me all your strength tonight praise God healed all your strength to the Holy Spirit Hallelujah that's what that shows your real love for Jesus Christ given everything you've got Hallelujah that shows you really love it yeah you're saved by grace but then he says he said if you love me keep my commands exactly yield yourself to the Holy Spirit praise God now you know this has numerous types right this the two Olive branches God was speaking to his roomable he said this was haggai and Zechariah but then we know of course later uh it's going to be Moses and Elijah or two men with the spirit of Moses in Elijah right in Revelation chapter 11. these are two olive trees which stand and preach to the whole earth praise God so that's where we understand oil in this Menorah oil in this Reservoir represents the spirit of God in every age we must draw from the spirit of God hallelujah Church whatever you're facing tonight draw on God's oil tonight soak up some of God's oil so your light can shine in your situation praise God that that's that's the secret to all these uh all these victories of all the churches down through the years no matter what they were facing we're facing a One World Government right we're basing the world that wants us to get covered shots every year right and have covered cards and wants to lock us down another lockdown another list we're facing these things but we we don't have to worry because we're drawing on something that's greater than us we're drawing on the same thing Peter and Paul Drew on when they went to be martyred we just got to draw another because that is we just got to soak in God's presence and if you're soaking in God's presence and if he's lit your fire and if you trim your lamps you're gonna glow with the power of Jesus Christ so humble it may be like James where James did not get rescued for prison Peter got rescued from prison but James did not but did he still glow with the power of the Holy Ghost absolutely do you think the Saints prayed for James when he got arrested yeah absolutely remember they were shocked when Peter come out of there they were shot like this can't be Peter you must wrote it you must be a little confused you got you're a little beside your stuff you saw an angel you saw a vision right see God has a story he's writing and church we don't know the end of the story whether it's death by martyr or death by the grave we don't know the story but one thing we know is that we can soak in the oil of God and we can burn brightly and we can manifest the life of Jesus Christ we can have the same power they had the beginning in fact we know the same part of the beginning will be the same power at the end praise God it's been the same power down Through the Ages hey friends I could come to you tonight and tell you my biggest obstacle my biggest struggle in my life and you can say brother Jesse just soak in that presence of the Lord I say thank you brother will you you could come to me and say brother Jesse here's my biggest problem tonight I would say you know just soak in God's presence of the Holy One
