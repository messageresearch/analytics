[30:48] let's stand here and take our Bibles
[30:50] here tonight by God's grace like to go
[30:53] to mark chapter 16 verse 15 I like to
[30:57] preach on purpose part 32 tonight so
[31:01] mark 16:15 over the week and you heard
[31:10] me say that I felt like brother Simon
[31:11] picked up where I left off and I do feel
[31:14] like that we had some wonderful thoughts
[31:16] and a tremendous weekend of services and
[31:20] Lord willing I'm gonna listen to all
[31:22] those I listen to two of them already by
[31:24] God listen to more and I would I just
[31:26] kind of reiterate and maybe expound on
[31:30] the some of the thoughts that the Lord
[31:32] brought to us last weekend is such a
[31:34] tremendous wonderful weekend of the Word
[31:37] of God but I like to look at this
[31:40] thought tonight on purpose and then more
[31:45] willing we'll go into some more of the
[31:46] thoughts on Sunday
[31:54] Bible says and he said unto them go into
[31:57] all the world and preach the gospel to
[31:58] every creature he'd that believe that
[32:00] his baptized shall be saved he that
[32:02] believeth not shall be damned now
[32:04] children us I'll read verse 17 he got it
[32:06] there let's read up on three one two
[32:08] three and these signs shall follow them
[32:11] that believe in my name shall they cast
[32:14] out Devils they shall speak with new
[32:18] tongues are we to eighteen they shall
[32:20] take up serpents and if they drink any
[32:22] deadly thing it shall not hurt them they
[32:24] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[32:26] shall recover so then after the Lord had
[32:29] spoken unto them he was received up into
[32:31] heaven and sat on the right hand of God
[32:33] and they went forth and preached
[32:35] everywhere the Lord working with them
[32:37] and confirming the word with signs
[32:39] following amen I'll read one more
[32:42] scripture first Corinthians 12 27 I
[32:56] think everybody can hear me okay I
[32:58] already got a couple of texts from Amen
[33:00] and Hosea Thank You brothers for
[33:02] confirming that everything seems to be
[33:04] okay praise God now Lord willing we'll
[33:10] be looking at little more on gifts
[33:12] tonight kind of pick up where I left off
[33:15] and I want to just read this little
[33:19] portion of scripture because it again
[33:22] shows we read in mark 16 how these signs
[33:25] follow but then this text says not all
[33:29] the gifts not or each person does not
[33:32] receive all the gifts so kind of get
[33:35] brings man I get brings balance to what
[33:36] we read in mark 16 verse 27 now ye are
[33:40] the body of Christ and members in
[33:42] particular and God hath set some in the
[33:45] church so to our church we know and
[33:48] hopefully it'll be made real to you
[33:51] again tonight that God has set you in a
[33:55] certain position to do his will and to
[33:57] use the gifts that he gave you God has
[34:01] sent you to do some
[34:02] he's positioned you to do something
[34:04] first apostles secondarily prophets
[34:08] thirdly teachers after that miracles
[34:11] then gifts of healing helps government's
[34:13] diversities of tongues here's where I
[34:17] want to get to are all prophets I'm
[34:19] sorry are all apostles are me are all
[34:22] prophets are all teachers are all
[34:24] workers of miracles have all the gifts
[34:27] of healing do all speak with tongues do
[34:29] all interpret of course we know the
[34:31] answer to all these questions is no but
[34:34] covet earnestly the best gifts are the
[34:36] gifts that edify the most people like
[34:39] wisdom knowledge prophecy and yet no
[34:46] more accurate way that's that one more
[34:49] word appending on your heart just make
[34:50] it honor to God here today showing us
[34:52] how word of Prayer inspiring it's
[34:53] Heavenly Father we thank you again for
[34:55] your mazing grace or take this word now
[34:57] break it to our hearts teach us from the
[34:58] message from the Bible from your prophet
[35:00] Lord God we love you so much we just
[35:03] want to stay right in tune with the Holy
[35:04] Spirit what I truly felt like Lord
[35:07] you've indicated everything you've led
[35:08] me to preach this year on purpose and
[35:10] supernatural and gifts and Lord you just
[35:13] have indicated it this weekend so thank
[35:15] you Lord for that
[35:15] teach us from here on out Lord and then
[35:18] move us Lord in the next class Lord that
[35:20] we can we can realize where you set us
[35:24] and what you've called us to do we know
[35:26] we're not called to do everything we
[35:28] can't do everything but we want to do
[35:30] exactly what you've called us to do
[35:31] teach us now I pray in Jesus Christ's
[35:34] name never said all right everybody may
[35:36] be seated by God's grace so we're so
[35:43] thankful for the testimonies sister
[35:46] Connie and brother Simon shared with us
[35:48] also Lord willing Sunday we'll look at
[35:51] some of the thoughts from last weekend
[35:52] and expound on him but also we'll show
[35:55] the the Trump video where he talks about
[35:57] 28 evangelical leaders coming to the
[36:00] White House and expressing tremendous
[36:03] unity churches starting to back the
[36:07] government and then we're willing on
[36:08] Sunday I'll just reiterate some of the
[36:10] quotes brother brand talked about the
[36:12] boycott where the government is going to
[36:15] boycott churches
[36:16] like ours when church is when the false
[36:20] churches unite with the government it'll
[36:24] cause a boycott brother ban said that
[36:26] happens when the spirit Falls so that we
[36:28] believe that to be the latter rain and
[36:32] so we don't know how close it is but
[36:35] it's just another sign that we're on the
[36:37] way and that the prophecy is right
[36:40] by God's grace so just real briefly the
[36:44] last few services we've been looking at
[36:45] the purpose we looked at program quote
[36:49] from works is faith expressed you must
[36:51] be learning more about our gifts or
[36:53] something's wrong so I'm like look at
[36:55] Malachi and Lydia and and if they're not
[36:57] learning more about piano after a while
[36:59] something's wrong or their guitar means
[37:04] they've lost interest in it that they've
[37:06] lost desire for and so it is for my life
[37:09] if I see healings in my life or if I see
[37:11] wisdom or knowledge or if you see
[37:14] speaking in tongues or prophesying or
[37:18] interpretation and if we don't see
[37:20] ourselves growing in these things
[37:22] something's wrong we've lost interest in
[37:24] them we've stopped praying about those
[37:26] things we've maybe somehow we've just
[37:28] got distracted with all the cares life
[37:31] and the duties of life which are good we
[37:32] have to do things but we can't let cares
[37:36] of life take a higher priority than the
[37:39] Word of God because jesus said seek ye
[37:41] first the kingdom of God and His
[37:44] righteousness and all these things more
[37:47] about our gifts by the grace of the Lord
[37:49] then we saw how God's have got a variety
[37:51] some men are more prayer warriors some
[37:53] are more scholarly some are more
[37:55] firebrands some are more quiet some are
[37:58] more blusterous some are more dogmatic
[38:01] but God likes a variety of people some
[38:04] are more gentle and kind and then we
[38:07] were born to do something each person
[38:08] was born to do something for God like
[38:11] Samson was born to defeat beginning to
[38:13] defeat the Philistines Jesus was born to
[38:16] destroy death the Bible said and save us
[38:18] from our sins so each person was born to
[38:22] achieve some purpose some ministry then
[38:25] we were saw we saw how we were ordained
[38:27] by God to do something but were still be
[38:30] I mean that Moses wasn't always the
[38:32] meekest man but he became the meekest
[38:35] man and David wasn't always a man after
[38:36] God's own heart but he learned to grow
[38:39] to be a guy a man after God's own heart
[38:41] through obedience now I left off the
[38:44] court I left off was a quote brother
[38:50] Simon mentioned about he about brother
[38:53] branham saying he was going to give the
[38:56] people a little twister and I'll get to
[38:58] that in a little bit but it was a quote
[39:00] about signing crying for the
[39:01] abominations and I ended with that quote
[39:05] on the Sunday morning before last
[39:07] weekend so I want to read that entire
[39:10] quote that probably the longest quote
[39:13] I'll ever read as a pastor but it's such
[39:17] an important quote and as I meditated it
[39:19] and pray it prayed about it and read it
[39:20] over I thought I just got to read this
[39:22] whole quote so it's from questions and
[39:24] answers 64 part 3 if you want to listen
[39:27] to how to encourage you to listen to it
[39:29] but I just feel that I thought you know
[39:31] be a good time I'm on this topic we just
[39:34] had the vindication about the
[39:35] supernatural and getting in the spirit
[39:37] on bringing back the Ark bringing back
[39:40] revival I thought it would be important
[39:43] to read this entire quote so it's
[39:45] question number 328 in the co D and I'll
[39:50] just be stopping and making comments and
[39:52] trying to balance out with other quotes
[39:54] I've been preaching over the years and
[39:57] then if you want those quotes you know
[39:58] feel free to email me or text me or call
[40:00] me or whatever leave me a voicemail and
[40:03] I can get back to you so here's the
[40:06] question says brother Branham is it
[40:08] possible for one to have the baptism of
[40:11] the Holy Ghost and not have the signs
[40:15] following
[40:16] at least not until some future time and
[40:19] conditions appointed by the spirit now
[40:22] that's a beautiful question brother
[40:24] Graham says that he says now that might
[40:27] sound like a mixed up question but
[40:29] that's a good one
[40:29] very good he gives me a little chance I
[40:33] find that's working with my family here
[40:35] now I mean you my family and the family
[40:38] out in the world where our tapes go so
[40:41] see we're part of a band of spiritual
[40:43] family
[40:43] he's got now a great part of my
[40:45] congregation is made up of Pentecostal
[40:47] people because Pentecost is the latest
[40:50] message that we have in the
[40:52] denominational ranks and to me I
[40:54] certainly agree with them more than any
[40:56] other denominational Church I hang
[40:59] towards the Pentecost so because it's
[41:00] the later message and all my converts
[41:05] that I bring to Christ I try to direct
[41:06] them to some Pentecostal church but I
[41:10] have condemned them in every way that I
[41:12] note how that they were wrong in the
[41:15] scripture by being a denomination and
[41:17] not willing to walk in light when lights
[41:20] presented to them yet if I had to take
[41:23] my choice today to take any Church in
[41:25] the world
[41:25] I take Pentecostal when it comes to
[41:28] denomination but when it comes to
[41:30] individuals as men and women there's
[41:33] genuine Christians and all them
[41:34] denominations Methodist Baptist
[41:36] Presbyterian Luther's but I'm talking
[41:39] about the systems that these people and
[41:41] not never the individual but the system
[41:45] that these people has been caught into
[41:47] their denomination they clearly
[41:49] understand now if the Roman Catholic
[41:53] Jehovah's Witness Orthodox Jew whatever
[41:55] they are that doesn't matter to me but
[41:57] they're individuals to which Christ died
[42:00] to save so brother Brahim here is very
[42:02] kind to anyone who's outside his type of
[42:04] church and realizing that these are
[42:09] souls that Christ died to save let me
[42:13] just say you know the the if we're gonna
[42:15] point someone to denomination today we
[42:17] would point into the latest message I
[42:18] would even go maybe a step further and
[42:20] say poem to a oneness Pentecostal church
[42:23] right because they have even more truth
[42:26] they know that God's not three persons
[42:28] but at least they believe in the
[42:30] supernatural and being baptized in the
[42:32] literal name of the Lord Jesus Christ or
[42:34] at least Jesus at least they believe in
[42:37] healings now though many of them of
[42:40] course do the tongues is evidence but
[42:42] that's still you're getting more bread
[42:44] you're getting more word than you would
[42:46] at a denominational church that doesn't
[42:47] believe in supernatural or doesn't
[42:50] believe the gifts of the Spirit or
[42:51] believes God is three persons now he
[42:55] says
[42:55] neck's he says I believe there's just as
[42:59] many Christians out there in the baptist
[43:00] as there are the Methodists or the
[43:02] presbyterian or whatever more there are
[43:04] Christians real believers now this is
[43:06] 1964 after the seals
[43:08] he says there's real believers and
[43:10] denominations and right out in the Roman
[43:14] Catholic Church there's genuine people
[43:16] in there that's real men and women that
[43:18] love the Lord they don't join that
[43:21] church to be wrong they join that to be
[43:23] right but it's a system in there that
[43:26] directs their mind the wrong way and it
[43:29] ever comes to a time I'd make a
[43:31] denomination I've deceived you and
[43:33] brought you into a system he said far be
[43:36] it from me and may God keep me in the
[43:39] right mind to direct you to Jesus Christ
[43:41] the word stay with that that's what we
[43:44] are that's what message churches are
[43:45] we're not denomination no one lords over
[43:47] me no one tells me what to preach except
[43:49] the Holy Spirit and so we're free from
[43:52] all denomination and we're staying with
[43:54] Jesus Christ the word
[43:56] now that's programs intro to answer the
[43:59] question now he gets to the question but
[44:02] now this person here is asking the
[44:04] question about the possibility of having
[44:05] the baptism of Holy Ghost without signs
[44:08] following them now watch this answer
[44:11] this is quite a long but beautiful
[44:14] answer and you'll see how he deals with
[44:18] it he tries to bring the balance to it
[44:21] because all Christians should have signs
[44:23] following them at some point but brother
[44:25] Graham never says when he says but we
[44:28] should be growing into that we should be
[44:30] growing an understanding and power a
[44:33] growing and obedience growing in
[44:35] submission and for us that means growing
[44:37] in prayer growing and more obedience to
[44:40] the Word of God he says if you're born
[44:45] again see if you're born first as a
[44:47] human being a normal human being he says
[44:52] you'll actually do the things that are
[44:53] normal human being would do so but man
[44:55] uses a natural example to help us
[44:58] understand the spiritual you're born
[45:00] again the Holy Ghost you'll be a Holy
[45:02] Ghost fell believer if you're born again
[45:04] of a mother right in the natural way
[45:07] you'll be yo new natural things
[45:09] a child or young young infant us he says
[45:16] if you're born as a human the natural
[45:18] traits of a human being will follow you
[45:19] you won't live in a tree and try to fly
[45:22] with wings like a bird or something like
[45:26] that that wouldn't be in a normal human
[45:28] being normal human being would to work
[45:31] to marry have family do these things
[45:33] that's natural
[45:34] normal human beings because you're born
[45:36] that then when you're born to Christian
[45:39] born in the Spirit of God you naturally
[45:41] take up the attributes of Christ he said
[45:45] if we took here this morning in this
[45:47] congregation where you people sit here
[45:49] and listen day after day and so forth to
[45:51] the teaching you'll find out you'd be
[45:53] different for another because you're
[45:54] different
[45:55] you're makeup different your appetites
[45:57] are different you eat different but you
[45:59] all eat food one individual just like
[46:03] the other one you're different one from
[46:05] another Christians do the same thing now
[46:09] you can't say now all he said do all
[46:12] speak with tongues do all prophesy see
[46:14] why I use that scripture when we started
[46:15] see you have to watch these things
[46:18] because a Christian just takes up the
[46:20] habits of a Christian and they live like
[46:23] a Christian Jesus said these signs shall
[46:26] follow them that believe that's my other
[46:28] text for tonight praise God notice in my
[46:32] name they shall cast out Devils they
[46:34] shall take up serpents and drink if they
[46:36] drink any deadly things and not hurt
[46:38] them they'll speak with new tongues then
[46:40] things just actually follow Christians
[46:42] now the person has a very good thing
[46:45] here so by man that says it's a very
[46:47] good question because it's talking about
[46:49] timing timing in your life he said or do
[46:54] we wait unto the future time or the
[46:57] conditions appointed by the Holy Spirit
[47:00] well the man said I like that now you
[47:04] get the idea when it's appointed by the
[47:07] Holy Spirit God
[47:12] points things so apparently God appoints
[47:14] miracles and God appoints all the gifts
[47:17] of the Holy Spirit he said there if if
[47:21] the Pentecostal people would try to
[47:23] listen this tape you'll understand me if
[47:25] you'll get here why different with you
[47:27] pressing the idea that they must all
[47:30] speak with tongues I cannot see that
[47:32] right he said I like cherry pie but
[47:34] there's no need and I'm a human being
[47:38] there's no need of me trying to tell you
[47:40] if you don't eat cherry pie you're not a
[47:42] human being see but eating cherry pie is
[47:45] just one of the habits of the human
[47:47] being you might disagree with me upon
[47:49] that but it's true now one will eat this
[47:51] and the one will do something else now
[47:53] the Holy Spirit appoints these offices
[47:56] but when you try to force yourself into
[47:59] it so now he's going to get down tongues
[48:02] people that have the tongues speaking
[48:05] doctor and they're trying to they're
[48:07] trying to force the idea that God set
[48:09] them to speak with tongues but remember
[48:10] the Bible said God sets you in your
[48:12] position he says but what if I said you
[48:16] had to eat cherry pie but cherry pie
[48:18] made you vomit and he said see you're
[48:22] hurting yourself and that's the way you
[48:25] try to do when you try to force yourself
[48:27] to do something that's contrary to the
[48:29] cherry to the spirit he's got your life
[48:33] lotted for a certain thing that we can
[48:35] all should all shout Amen on that on the
[48:37] shout amen amen
[48:38] God has given you a certain lot in life
[48:41] you're supposed to do a certain thing
[48:43] you have a certain lot a certain gift
[48:46] you're supposed to do you can't force
[48:48] yourself to try to do something you have
[48:50] to get under the anointing of the Spirit
[48:52] Ram taught earlier man taught us and can
[48:54] preach it first get in prayer so you can
[48:57] get under the spirit and then when
[48:59] you're in the spirit God will give you
[49:01] revelation revelation of your gift but
[49:03] you got to pray first pray for
[49:06] revelation and then when you're in that
[49:08] spirit of revelation God will show you
[49:10] his will God will show you your gifts he
[49:17] said in when your
[49:18] with the spirit here's one of the best
[49:20] sides I know of of the evidence of the
[49:22] Holy Ghost he says you're so in love
[49:24] with Christ and believe every word that
[49:27] he says to be the truth that's the
[49:29] evidence that you have the Holy Spirit
[49:30] and your life's full of joy
[49:35] oh my everything is different than what
[49:36] he used to be that's the Holy Spirit now
[49:38] these are the gifts in the Spill Holy
[49:40] Spirit now if every person in here was
[49:46] imperfectly harming with harmony with
[49:48] the Holy Spirit every one of you was
[49:52] filled with the Holy Ghost and in
[49:54] harmony with the Holy Ghost these signs
[49:57] would just be multiplying among you all
[50:00] the time it'd just be constantly going
[50:02] now cam mentioned this quote earlier
[50:05] this weekend I thought it was inspired
[50:06] so see cam and Simon not even realized
[50:09] what they were doing
[50:10] we're hitting on the same quote I was
[50:11] getting to before I got to it so that's
[50:14] why I wanted to get to it tonight by
[50:16] God's grace so see that's why it's
[50:19] important you know for our church
[50:21] you know any church if people say
[50:23] they're born again the Holy Ghost they
[50:26] got to live right we got to keep
[50:27] ourselves from the cares of the world a
[50:29] lust of the flesh part of life all these
[50:30] things if we do that then we'll see the
[50:33] gifts of the Spirit multiplying or
[50:35] growing in our life it's hard to do
[50:38] brother Ram said it's the hardest thing
[50:39] for a preacher or any church to do is
[50:42] stay under the anointing of the Holy
[50:44] Spirit so that we can see God moved
[50:47] through gifts and signs and supernatural
[50:50] manifestations of the Holy Spirit he
[50:55] said but where there's confusion where
[50:57] there's difference where we set up the
[51:00] Holy Spirit can't move itself you can't
[51:05] see it can't operate through the people
[51:07] and if I said now each of you did you
[51:10] speak with tongues yeah well you got it
[51:11] did you speak with tongues no you
[51:14] haven't got it
[51:14] he said now I'm making myself a judge
[51:16] God is the judge of these things so see
[51:19] what denominations have done whether
[51:20] it's oneness Pentecostal
[51:22] trataron Pentecostal anyone who has the
[51:24] tongues as evidence doctrine has made
[51:27] themselves the judge and they're judging
[51:29] something that they can't see they can't
[51:31] know
[51:32] like I've told you this I had a good
[51:33] college friend who in college he he
[51:36] joined a oneness pentecostals search he
[51:41] got married to one of the girls in the
[51:42] church and they spoke with tongues all
[51:44] the time I went to a couple of their
[51:45] services they spoke tongues that
[51:47] throughout the song service after the
[51:49] preaching and all the time they're
[51:51] speaking in tongues and they all said
[51:52] they had the Holy Ghost well my friend
[51:55] got into this insurance business he
[51:57] stopped spending time with his wife she
[51:59] got better she went and committed
[52:00] adultery had an affair and they broke up
[52:04] and they got divorced and moved on to
[52:07] other people
[52:07] now obviously those people were never
[52:10] born again but their church and their
[52:13] denomination their Creed tried to judge
[52:16] them and say yes you're born again
[52:17] you're sealing the kingdom of God but we
[52:19] know if Christ gets sealed into you all
[52:21] those sin major sins like that will be
[52:24] sealed out we know that because that's
[52:26] what the Bible says if you're a part of
[52:28] the kingdom of God you won't commit
[52:29] adultery fornication homosexuality
[52:33] thieves and all these things all these
[52:35] major sins the Bible talks about in
[52:38] Galatians 5 and 1st Corinthians 6 but
[52:41] that's one clear common example that I
[52:44] can show how that false doctor makes a
[52:48] person a judge and they're judging
[52:49] something they don't even understand
[52:50] they can't even see right even you and I
[52:53] in one case brother Branham says he said
[52:56] you'll never know if a person is born
[52:57] again the Holy Ghost and then another
[52:59] quote he said you can tell in five
[53:01] minutes if they're born again with the
[53:03] Holy Ghost
[53:03] so there's quotes on both sides so we're
[53:06] not really sure but the main thing to do
[53:09] is look for fruits jesus said by their
[53:10] fruits you know them now fruits
[53:13] obviously only come the real fruits of
[53:15] the Holy Spirit only come from people
[53:17] who have been serving God a long time
[53:19] and are born again that's how you see
[53:22] fruits of the Holy Spirit so we know
[53:25] in order to really have a good feeling
[53:27] if someone is born again you've got to
[53:30] give it a lot of time they got to be a
[53:32] faithful witness they got to have
[53:33] time-tested memorials praise God amen
[53:39] so now Baron says but watch Jesus said
[53:42] these signs shall follow them that
[53:43] believe the groups that believe I like
[53:46] this now the whole nature of the Holy
[53:48] Spirit flows through them
[53:50] and they're full of love and joy and a
[53:53] great bundle of real godly filled people
[53:56] that's the Holy Spirit and in there they
[53:59] speak with tongues on the occasion that
[54:01] tongues arise why or necessary for that
[54:06] they speak with tongues if there's a
[54:08] prophecy
[54:09] it speaks and oh it's just exactly
[54:12] perfect every time to see we all of us
[54:15] have to get in harmony with the Holy
[54:17] Ghost and see if we have the gift of
[54:18] prophecy in our church like we said it
[54:20] may come through dreams may come through
[54:22] something just spoken out loud we don't
[54:25] know how it'll come but we want to be in
[54:27] harmony with the Holy Spirit in case god
[54:29] does wondering for tell us the future
[54:34] then Brennan talked about how he had 15
[54:37] interviews before this service and
[54:39] everything came out perfectly through
[54:41] the discernment so that was another
[54:43] vindication that the Holy Spirit is
[54:45] perfectly right every time
[54:48] the Holy Spirit dig right down in there
[54:51] get them things and bring them out and
[54:52] tell it to them see there's no mistakes
[54:54] to it tells it just exactly what this
[54:57] and what that was and what it what that
[54:59] is and what is to be done things like
[55:00] that what they should do set it right in
[55:03] order now they've got to act on that the
[55:07] other night I was talking to a couple at
[55:09] a home he's having a meeting talking
[55:10] around the table and all once the Holy
[55:13] Spirit dropped among us so what I
[55:14] watched this this is something we can
[55:16] grow as a church to brother Mannis fill
[55:18] with the Holy Spirit right he's got the
[55:19] oyster right here but yet he felt the
[55:21] Holy Spirit drop down in the room okay
[55:25] so see it shows there's you can feel the
[55:28] Holy Spirit in another realm you can
[55:30] feel the Holy Spirit and your flesh you
[55:32] can feel the Holy Spirit in your mind
[55:34] anointing your mind where he just brings
[55:36] a thought to you right you working
[55:38] through your conscious memory reason
[55:40] affection imagination so see you can be
[55:42] filled with the Holy Ghost and feel the
[55:44] Holy Ghost come down in the room praise
[55:46] God
[55:49] so programs are the host
[55:51] and I said I see a certain man here the
[55:52] vision he's confused in his mind about
[55:55] some things and I said now it's right
[55:58] here now I said I know what you're
[56:00] thinking and he said he went back and a
[56:02] roundabout way and answered every
[56:03] question the man had in his mind and
[56:09] nobody know what my man was talking
[56:10] about except the man that he discerned
[56:12] in that room so he said it was showing
[56:15] to him that the Holy Spirit was
[56:17] revealing to me what was on his mind and
[56:19] I didn't have to tell it to the rest of
[56:21] the man's listen at me right now so
[56:22] someone right there in the tabernacle
[56:25] confirmation now if the whole church
[56:29] would work in harmony like that then
[56:31] among us we'd be casting out Devils
[56:33] taking up serpents drinking deadly
[56:35] things all kinds of things going on so
[56:41] that's why we should strive for harmony
[56:43] get our lives in harmony or pleasing to
[56:46] the holy spirit as brother can talk
[56:48] walking in the spirit is denying sin
[56:51] denying our fleshly lusts so if we come
[56:54] to church like that if we come to church
[56:56] denying our fleshly lust denying
[56:58] ourselves and coming with the anointing
[57:00] like we talked about then we're gonna
[57:02] see more of the sort of God move amongst
[57:05] us but he said when you try to force
[57:09] that on individuals that's Pentecost so
[57:12] again like the tongues when you try to
[57:14] force tongues on someone that's
[57:15] Pentecostal then you got Babylon
[57:17] confusion you can't judge that our
[57:21] hearts he said our hearts are full of
[57:23] joy and happiness all my the birds are
[57:24] saying everything is wonderful not just
[57:27] full the Spirit of God we're so in love
[57:28] with Jesus we want to pray all night now
[57:32] would it no I wouldn't embarrass this
[57:35] crowd he says or even my cell
[57:40] but I wonder if I could ask this morning
[57:43] which one in this crowd and this people
[57:45] had the Holy Ghost probably 95 percent
[57:47] would raise their hands that they had
[57:49] the Holy Ghost then I turn around and
[57:53] give you a Bible evidence just one now
[57:56] here's a good quote that proves there's
[57:57] more than one evidence of the Holy Ghost
[58:00] right the evidence of the Holy Ghost is
[58:02] living the word for your day but what we
[58:04] mean by that there's more than one
[58:06] scripture about different things you'll
[58:08] do if you're born again you're gonna
[58:10] sigh and cry you're gonna have the
[58:12] fruits of the spirit you're gonna pay
[58:13] your tithe you're gonna go to church
[58:15] you're gonna live a clean life
[58:16] you're not gonna cuss and swear you're
[58:18] not gonna commit adultery you're gonna
[58:19] live a chaste pure life so that's what
[58:24] he's saying here it's a good quote for
[58:25] that he says he said I doubt whether one
[58:33] or two hands would go up
[58:37] he says but you've got to get your
[58:39] church out of that baby hood and get
[58:41] them into manhood okay now he goes into
[58:46] this thought about how people in his
[58:48] church were name calling people from
[58:50] another Church I think about that even
[58:52] brother Branham Church had people that
[58:54] were carnal that didn't like people from
[58:56] other churches and would name call them
[58:58] call them deadbeats
[59:00] that's what the quote says so there was
[59:01] people in Brannon tabernacled name
[59:03] calling other churches and call them
[59:05] dead beans like they're dead Christians
[59:08] it was actually brother junior Jackson's
[59:11] congregation and the reason they were
[59:16] calling him dead beans was because
[59:19] brother Jackson let them speak with
[59:21] tongues in the church service but
[59:23] brother Branham didn't want that he
[59:26] wanted the tongues interpretation in a
[59:28] room before the church service he says
[59:32] well that's brother Jackson's shirt
[59:33] that's perfectly all right
[59:34] I haven't got nothing against that jr.
[59:36] Jackson is one of my best friends a real
[59:38] godly man filled with the Spirit of God
[59:40] he don't have to eat my cherry pie he
[59:43] says I don't have to eat his apple pie
[59:46] but we're both eating pie we both
[59:48] believe this message exactly so c-minor
[59:52] doctrines like how to operate the gifts
[59:54] but apparently to brother Branham didn't
[59:56] represent what the message was the
[59:58] message was the full restoration of the
[1:00:00] Word of God on these major doctrines on
[1:00:02] these major mysteries right because he
[1:00:05] said yes how you operate the gifts isn't
[1:00:08] part of the message that they believe
[1:00:10] exactly he says that's the order the
[1:00:14] church I want my church to try to come
[1:00:16] together and come in the
[1:00:21] now I'm gonna skip a little bit but come
[1:00:23] in the room before the service and pray
[1:00:24] before the service all right now he says
[1:00:33] let the tongues go on he said for a
[1:00:36] while and then let the word be presented
[1:00:38] on it then watch it if it's the Holy
[1:00:40] Spirit it copes right with the word if
[1:00:43] it doesn't it won't so in other words
[1:00:45] let people speak in tongues he says but
[1:00:48] if it gets wrong bring the word and try
[1:00:50] to correct it if the person obeys the
[1:00:52] word than it then they're there right
[1:00:54] with the Holy Spirit the person disobeys
[1:00:56] the correction they're not right with
[1:00:57] the Holy Spirit he said if it's the Holy
[1:01:01] Spirit it'll just meekly follow right in
[1:01:03] line because that's what it is it's the
[1:01:05] Holy Spirit going right to its own order
[1:01:10] he said brother Graham said now was
[1:01:12] speaking in tongues I wish every one he
[1:01:14] spoke with tongues I sure do and he says
[1:01:20] many times good Christians now he's
[1:01:22] talking about an interview he had I
[1:01:23] think it was with sister Bruce he said
[1:01:27] this person the genuine person her for
[1:01:31] me say the evidence of the whole
[1:01:32] eastcoast wasn't speaking in tongues and
[1:01:34] it isn't but I advised that person to
[1:01:36] ask God to let them either speak in
[1:01:38] tongues or prophesy
[1:01:39] because it's in their nature so Graham
[1:01:42] saw someone the church who really wanted
[1:01:45] know if they had the Holy Ghost and so
[1:01:46] he prayed ask God God we let them speak
[1:01:49] in tongues of prophesy because this
[1:01:50] person their mind they needed that in
[1:01:53] order to feel like they were born again
[1:01:57] in church if you feel that same way it's
[1:02:00] okay to do that I mean everybody needs
[1:02:02] everybody needs a sign Pope's you can
[1:02:05] put down and a spot where you say I
[1:02:08] believe I received the Holy Ghost at
[1:02:10] that moment
[1:02:12] Thomas remember time is desire I just
[1:02:14] want to put my hands and his side I just
[1:02:17] want to touch his feet and God was
[1:02:19] merciful and gave it to him and we were
[1:02:21] not going to criticize Thomas because
[1:02:22] we've all had our doubts we some of us
[1:02:25] maybe still doubt but we got to be
[1:02:27] honest enough with Jesus and ask him and
[1:02:30] like Gideon put a fleece out before the
[1:02:32] Lord and see if God will answer there's
[1:02:33] nothing wrong with that even for the
[1:02:34] children
[1:02:35] okay to get down into business with God
[1:02:37] get serious with God
[1:02:38] ask God say God if you do this then this
[1:02:40] means this and if you don't do that it
[1:02:42] means this but makes you write it down
[1:02:44] makes you remember make sure you're
[1:02:46] serious enough enough about it you have
[1:02:48] enough business with God that's enough
[1:02:51] honestly with God that you'll do what
[1:02:53] he's asking you do or you'll do what you
[1:02:55] you say and promise God you'll do okay
[1:03:02] now then brother Graham goes into
[1:03:04] interviews and how he'll he'll look
[1:03:06] under which sign
[1:03:09] astronomy sign a person was born under
[1:03:12] when he's counseling with that I'm not
[1:03:16] gonna get much into that I'd like to
[1:03:17] study that maybe at some point and get
[1:03:19] into that later but I'm not ready to
[1:03:21] preach on that right now
[1:03:25] all right so he says don't let Satan
[1:03:29] stand anywhere in your mind so don't let
[1:03:31] him make you doubt he says that's his
[1:03:34] duty to stand there and pound at you
[1:03:36] like that but don't you listen to him
[1:03:38] so church if you have any doubts in your
[1:03:40] life go to God and prayer get serious
[1:03:43] with God ask God for a sign fast and
[1:03:46] pray read your Bible more read
[1:03:48] scriptures talk to me whatever you need
[1:03:51] to do find a gifted person ask me about
[1:03:53] a gifted person I know that may be able
[1:03:55] to help you but don't let Satan pound
[1:03:58] you and keep you defeated by doubt right
[1:04:01] we shouldn't live lives of doubt we
[1:04:04] should live lives of faith right lives
[1:04:06] of hope remember walking in the spirit
[1:04:08] is life and peace a camera that
[1:04:10] scripture from Romans the Holy Spirit is
[1:04:12] joy life and peace not doubt and
[1:04:15] discouragement and fear and frustration
[1:04:18] right so we got to go to God and ask him
[1:04:21] to minister to us and help us to get out
[1:04:24] of doubt if we're doubting but Rahab
[1:04:27] said but I told that person if I could
[1:04:31] just be sure if having the Holy Ghost a
[1:04:33] dandy person but man said a real loyal
[1:04:35] person I told her it'd be good for her
[1:04:39] to say father just give me this for
[1:04:41] something to stand on that's what I'd
[1:04:45] used in my life like I always tell
[1:04:46] people I got the Holy Ghost a day after
[1:04:47] my wedding which I'm still claiming that
[1:04:50] because like a week later a preacher was
[1:04:53] preaching on it and I was really
[1:04:54] battling in my mind whether to go up to
[1:04:56] pray for the Holy Ghost or not but I
[1:04:58] just decided that moment Lord I'm gonna
[1:05:00] believe right now I have to I got the
[1:05:02] Holy Ghost for something supernatural
[1:05:04] happened to me that day I never felt
[1:05:06] like that before and I prayed and said
[1:05:08] God if it's if that wasn't the Holy
[1:05:10] Ghost
[1:05:10] prove it let me see it my life that my
[1:05:13] life would fail but my life never failed
[1:05:16] it always got closer to God so that's
[1:05:20] what every person has to do right every
[1:05:22] person has to sent down a snake and say
[1:05:24] I'm gonna believe that if my life
[1:05:26] doesn't tally up to God's Word after
[1:05:27] that and that wasn't the baptism of the
[1:05:29] Holy Ghost
[1:05:30] that's what brother Graham says every
[1:05:32] person has to do that now recently I've
[1:05:35] talked to a few people that told me they
[1:05:37] wanted to be remapped
[1:05:38] or they had to be reburied at rebaptised
[1:05:40] a second or third time and we've always
[1:05:43] found that to be a good thing because if
[1:05:45] there's any doubt in your mind it's a
[1:05:47] good idea to go back and make sure if
[1:05:50] you want to be rebaptised repent of your
[1:05:53] sins seek God fast and pray do whatever
[1:05:56] you need to do in order to know that
[1:05:59] you're truly saved well you're you're
[1:06:01] truly serving God with all your heart
[1:06:03] this time if there's any doubt you were
[1:06:05] before this will eliminate it because
[1:06:08] you saw God you pray you talk to me your
[1:06:11] pastor you're ready to solve all doubts
[1:06:15] right like the Bible says the Holy
[1:06:17] Spirit will dissolve all doubts so I've
[1:06:20] we found recently I've talked to
[1:06:21] different ones one in Albion and went
[1:06:23] over there now another one was from a
[1:06:24] few years ago my brother cams church
[1:06:26] someone felt led to do that and they've
[1:06:28] got victory ever since they've been very
[1:06:30] faithful ever since so you found that to
[1:06:33] be a good thing it's Satan's job to
[1:06:35] pound you with doubt and fear and an
[1:06:38] anger and unbelief or new questions but
[1:06:41] it's our job to get so close to God that
[1:06:44] we draw nigh to God that God gets so
[1:06:46] nice to us he gives us some experience
[1:06:48] and then from that experience we just
[1:06:51] hold on to that as our evidence that was
[1:06:53] the time God surely did something in my
[1:06:55] life and then we just stay in harmony
[1:06:58] with the Holy Spirit afterwards amen now
[1:07:03] brother Branham says now the reason he
[1:07:06] doesn't teach everybody to seek tongues
[1:07:10] or prophesy like this woman he says it
[1:07:12] like this he says now if I taught it
[1:07:14] like that to everybody people would
[1:07:16] reach out and get a hold of that tongue
[1:07:18] or prophesy without having the character
[1:07:21] that this person's got so this woman had
[1:07:23] a real godly character but man thought
[1:07:25] she had the Holy Ghost but he wouldn't
[1:07:28] advise everybody to do that who was
[1:07:30] doubting about the Holy Ghost only
[1:07:33] someone with real godly holy ghost
[1:07:35] character would he advised to seek some
[1:07:39] manifestation the Holy Spirit he said
[1:07:42] the Holy Ghost does speak with tongues
[1:07:43] but you got to have the Holy Ghost first
[1:07:45] before it can speak with tongues
[1:07:50] now do you get it he says he said now
[1:07:53] that could be a genuine gift that could
[1:07:54] be the Holy Ghost speaking in you with
[1:07:57] unknown tongues he said and you could be
[1:07:59] lost and go to hell same thing with a
[1:08:00] miracle you can do a miracle but then be
[1:08:03] lost and go to hell
[1:08:04] the Bible says so and it's been then bro
[1:08:08] Graham quotes 1st Corinthians 13 you can
[1:08:10] speak with tongues right you can move
[1:08:12] mountains you got mountains of faith and
[1:08:14] still have not love it profits you
[1:08:16] nothing you don't get any closer to God
[1:08:19] because it's just an outward anointing
[1:08:21] on the the flesh or on the human sphere
[1:08:23] but not in the soul of man he says I'm
[1:08:30] Paul says I'm nothing unless the other
[1:08:33] goes with him so unless love goes with
[1:08:35] the gifts were nothing he says you have
[1:08:41] to have this love first so don't reach
[1:08:43] out after that gift without this get
[1:08:46] this first love and then that will
[1:08:48] actually follow it
[1:08:49] amen now the rain falls on the just and
[1:08:52] the unjust the Sun shines on the wicked
[1:08:54] the good the rainy follows to ripen the
[1:08:56] crop it ripens the weed also the same
[1:08:58] rain the Holy Spirit can fall in a group
[1:09:01] of people speak in tongues and make it
[1:09:02] exactly true sprawling amongst the
[1:09:05] people make a prophesy and be exactly
[1:09:07] true but sometimes a witch or medium
[1:09:10] they can say something that's exactly
[1:09:11] the right right but the Witch of Endor
[1:09:14] to solve mine it could be exactly true
[1:09:18] this still isn't it they're witches
[1:09:20] they're speaking in tongues I've seen
[1:09:22] devil speak with tongues writing on no
[1:09:23] tongues
[1:09:24] that don't mean anything but the real
[1:09:26] thing is that word again back to that
[1:09:28] word in other words living the word no
[1:09:31] matter what manifestation no matter what
[1:09:33] you can produce supernaturally whatever
[1:09:35] supernatural miracles we've got to get
[1:09:37] back to living the word praise God he
[1:09:42] said you can do all these gifts without
[1:09:44] the word when you get the word it does
[1:09:47] it then watch it just exactly come to
[1:09:49] pass exactly the right thing then you're
[1:09:52] in exactly in line yes the Holy Spirit
[1:09:55] uses these people as it's appointed by
[1:09:58] his own wisdom he said but the first
[1:10:01] thing is now what
[1:10:03] now let me give you a little twister
[1:10:06] here just a minute this is the quote I
[1:10:08] wanted to read lat two Sundays ago and
[1:10:11] the Sunday morning service I didn't have
[1:10:13] time for him he said let me give you a
[1:10:18] twister here how many here has the Holy
[1:10:19] Ghost he said all of you raise up your
[1:10:21] hand I say all right I'll see if you
[1:10:23] have the Bible said they that had the
[1:10:27] Holy Ghost sighed and cried day and
[1:10:29] night for the abominations done the city
[1:10:31] now how many hands would go up praise
[1:10:36] God
[1:10:40] how many of you can't rest at night so
[1:10:42] full of joy the power of God and so sad
[1:10:45] for the people that's lost that day and
[1:10:47] night you weep and cry for the
[1:10:49] abominations see who would that be in
[1:10:52] the city how many is that's in the
[1:10:55] church that's what the Bible said the
[1:10:57] Holy Spirit evidence was he told the
[1:11:00] sealing a John Ezekiel 9 right Simon
[1:11:02] preach in on Friday nights the hours it
[1:11:04] was all tied together I feel like it was
[1:11:06] just a continuation of the thought he
[1:11:14] said go through the city and set a mark
[1:11:15] upon those who sign cry for the
[1:11:16] abominations the rest of them left the
[1:11:19] destroying angel destroy them no matter
[1:11:23] how much church members they was how
[1:11:25] many things they done a man with an
[1:11:27] income Rider dressed in white which
[1:11:28] represented the Holy Spirit came forth
[1:11:31] and put a mark on all them that side and
[1:11:32] cried for an abomination ton the city
[1:11:34] and watch what he said they're also slay
[1:11:36] utterly
[1:11:39] little children all women babies come on
[1:11:41] he's a little children yes when Joshua
[1:11:44] entered the land of Canaan don't let one
[1:11:46] of them live he says remember the little
[1:11:49] ones they grow up to be an Amalekite
[1:11:51] he'll pollute the camp when those little
[1:11:54] things come back like that disagree with
[1:11:56] the Word of God get rid of that thing so
[1:11:59] so you know the judgment upon little
[1:12:04] ones in the Old Testament was a shadow
[1:12:07] of what we should do we should not let
[1:12:09] any little sin rise up in our lives he
[1:12:15] said it looks cute it looks innocent it
[1:12:17] looks like it's all right but don't have
[1:12:19] anything to do with it you stay away
[1:12:20] from it you just remember any Amalekite
[1:12:24] anything that denies the word stay away
[1:12:27] from it have nothing to do with it how
[1:12:30] many believe that's the truth sure it is
[1:12:31] stay away from it
[1:12:32] then he guys goes back to zq9 who sighs
[1:12:36] and cries for abomination that's in the
[1:12:37] city where do you see that okay so think
[1:12:43] about that think of all the church
[1:12:44] service do you bend the different Church
[1:12:45] of you been where have you seen people
[1:12:47] sigh and cry for all the evils done in
[1:12:49] their family or their City now you see
[1:12:52] it from time to time but there's not a
[1:12:53] whole lot of it right he said I can show
[1:12:57] you 10,000 people speaking in tongues to
[1:13:00] one that's really burden for sin so the
[1:13:03] RAM says like 10,000 to one you see
[1:13:05] people that will speak in tongues or
[1:13:07] shout or for us you know clap or scream
[1:13:11] 10,000 those for one person that's
[1:13:13] really burden for sin he said that can't
[1:13:16] even pray an hour so that's why I did
[1:13:20] those our prayers because I wanted to
[1:13:22] start getting the church but after that
[1:13:24] we got to get our churches out of
[1:13:25] babyhood in the manhood so we had 4
[1:13:29] hours of prayer that I scheduled for
[1:13:33] those who could make it and wanted to be
[1:13:34] a part of it 4 hours of Prayer because
[1:13:37] that this quote is what I had in my mind
[1:13:38] but man have sent someone that's really
[1:13:40] mature in Christ was sigh and cry and
[1:13:43] pray sometimes more than an hour so when
[1:13:46] does the church and my family to start
[1:13:48] learning and start seeing how we got to
[1:13:51] be more sincere
[1:13:52] should we get to Christ the more we're
[1:13:54] gonna love his spirit and more we're
[1:13:56] gonna hate sin and the more it's gonna
[1:13:58] make us sad when we see people not serve
[1:14:00] God okay he said but did you know the
[1:14:06] Bible said mark only those who sighed
[1:14:08] and cried for the domination than the
[1:14:10] city sure that's the Holy Spirit come
[1:14:13] forth to mark the people and the mark of
[1:14:17] God is the Holy Ghost the seal of God
[1:14:19] amen and I'm almost done here with this
[1:14:24] quote here and it's almost I think about
[1:14:26] an hour since I've been preaching here
[1:14:28] so this quote takes a long time to read
[1:14:30] here now where are some people that's
[1:14:34] that that's that interested I can hear
[1:14:37] you people that jump up and down and cry
[1:14:39] in the church I can show you people that
[1:14:41] shout ran all over the building I can
[1:14:43] show you people that prophesied comes
[1:14:44] the past I can show you those who speak
[1:14:46] with tongues we're up and down the
[1:14:47] buildings and say things that actually
[1:14:48] interprets comes the past but where's
[1:14:51] that person that sighs in Christ for the
[1:14:53] abominations that's done the city now
[1:14:57] we're at a time today where we don't see
[1:14:59] a lot of the other ones either we don't
[1:15:01] see a lot of speaking in tongues and
[1:15:03] crying and we don't see a lot of people
[1:15:05] running around the church our church is
[1:15:06] so small but you can still run around it
[1:15:09] so see that's because the Bible said at
[1:15:12] the end time because iniquity abounds
[1:15:16] the love of many shall wax cold so see
[1:15:19] how Nick witty tries to get into our
[1:15:21] lives and into our church is so
[1:15:23] influencing all of us and we gotta we
[1:15:26] got to get rid of any iniquity get rid
[1:15:28] of any sin and live in harmony to the
[1:15:29] Holy Spirit it's gonna be a great
[1:15:31] challenge but greater is He that's in us
[1:15:33] and he that's in the world from Anderson
[1:15:37] where's that burden soul he said you
[1:15:40] could turn some new leaves on that see
[1:15:44] what I mean so that
[1:15:47] or the RAM Carter the twister he said
[1:15:49] how many got the only ghost 95% he said
[1:15:51] now let me give you a proof who's who's
[1:15:53] signing crying for abominations and he
[1:15:56] said that would turn a new leaf well at
[1:15:58] some point we got to turn a new leaf
[1:15:59] right at some point we've got to grow up
[1:16:01] and I believe God will bring us to that
[1:16:04] maturity as the rapture gets closer it
[1:16:06] has to because the fullness of Pentecost
[1:16:09] will be in the bride that's thus saith
[1:16:10] the Lord we got to have the same desires
[1:16:13] they had in the book of Acts we got to
[1:16:16] live the same life have the same love
[1:16:17] for Jesus the same zeal for Christ he
[1:16:24] said I tried my best to tell you people
[1:16:26] and lead you like a daddy with his
[1:16:28] children you're my children I'd be
[1:16:31] getting begotten you to Christ through
[1:16:32] the gospel that I preach I want to raise
[1:16:34] up fully matured kids or children now I
[1:16:37] want to present you to Christ that day
[1:16:39] as Paul said a chaste virgin that's
[1:16:41] anger things 11 there isn't a thing in
[1:16:44] that word but what your heart will
[1:16:46] punctuate amen to it see we've got to
[1:16:50] get to the spot Archer says get this
[1:16:52] where we don't have to have special
[1:16:54] meetings to want to come early and pray
[1:16:57] before service that's a burden on my
[1:16:59] heart that's what I want to see other
[1:17:01] people do where we're just growing up
[1:17:03] into Christ that we we so desperately
[1:17:06] want harmony in our church that every
[1:17:08] church service is important every church
[1:17:10] service is special so we're going to
[1:17:12] come and pray and get our hearts and
[1:17:14] harmony with the Holy Spirit so we can
[1:17:16] see God moving among us multiplying
[1:17:19] among us and manifesting is great power
[1:17:22] among us now
[1:17:28] of course you'll do things wrong so
[1:17:31] here's where he brings the balance yes
[1:17:32] where our lives are full of joy we're
[1:17:33] happy we're so we're praying sine cry
[1:17:36] for dominations but then he says of
[1:17:38] course she'll do things wrong but when
[1:17:40] the other the first thing that condemns
[1:17:42] you you'll say Father forgive me so we
[1:17:46] got a we got to grow in quick repentance
[1:17:48] right where daddy for my children daddy
[1:17:51] doesn't have to correct you
[1:17:53] you'll hear the Holy Spirit say you need
[1:17:55] to make that right or you'll feel it
[1:17:57] right and for me that my wife doesn't
[1:18:02] have to bring something to my attention
[1:18:03] that I'll hear the Holy Spirit say Oh
[1:18:05] Jesse that's not right go say you're
[1:18:08] sorry see we we have to grow a woman
[1:18:13] that to be more sensitive to the harmony
[1:18:16] of the sphere of God brother Evan gives
[1:18:21] an example of this sensitivity to the
[1:18:24] Holy Spirit he saw a young boy a
[1:18:26] teenager he was hunting with recently
[1:18:29] and he says we was hunting squirrels a
[1:18:32] fine boy that morning I got five I left
[1:18:35] one of them for that afternoon you only
[1:18:37] get six in the state of Kentucky that's
[1:18:40] the limit says so that certain person
[1:18:42] said I got nine the limit was six but
[1:18:45] this young boy got nine and I said
[1:18:49] you've done wrong you did wrong see I
[1:18:54] said well I had five that morning I say
[1:18:57] one for the afternoon when I got that
[1:18:58] one squirrel looked in a tree and kind
[1:19:00] of five or six of them sitting right
[1:19:01] there where I could look at them walked
[1:19:03] out and left them I said I walked up in
[1:19:06] a tree here not long ago and there was
[1:19:08] about 15 or 20 sitting there I just took
[1:19:10] the limit and walked away I let the rest
[1:19:13] of them there so but brother time just
[1:19:16] gives a simple example he's choosing to
[1:19:19] obey the limit of the hunting season the
[1:19:22] legal limit he's choosing to obey the
[1:19:25] law the young boy didn't but he was
[1:19:28] obeying he said you did wrong my
[1:19:31] breaketh in the law because was sensible
[1:19:33] holy spirit
[1:19:40] he says and I said if I come to this
[1:19:45] country and preach to you boys and you
[1:19:47] people hear that that's right I've got
[1:19:49] to live that example
[1:19:50] now listen Christianity ain't what you
[1:19:53] say it's what you live what you do it's
[1:19:58] an example you're the salt of the earth
[1:20:01] amen so see no matter what people say in
[1:20:06] our church when we talked about to
[1:20:07] church before church during church it
[1:20:10] doesn't matter what people say it's what
[1:20:12] people live right it's what people do
[1:20:15] with their actions my man said then he
[1:20:21] told the boy the law says Jesus Christ
[1:20:23] said give them to Caesar what belongs to
[1:20:26] Caesar you break the speed laws there
[1:20:29] what are you doing you're doing wrong
[1:20:31] you sinned give Caesar what Caesar's and
[1:20:33] God what's God so even to driving over
[1:20:37] the limit you gotta be careful with that
[1:20:40] say well that's laws wrong I can't help
[1:20:44] what what's wrong it is it's wrong to
[1:20:47] break Jesus commandment if you don't
[1:20:49] give Caesar the thing that Caesars then
[1:20:51] you did what Jesus told you not to do
[1:20:53] and the transgression of the law is sin
[1:20:56] that's right we're all guilty we do it
[1:21:00] but when you see yourself wrong stop it
[1:21:02] in other words stop sinning it's not
[1:21:05] breaking the law people are watching you
[1:21:08] people won't go to church but they'll
[1:21:10] read you and see what you do I'm almost
[1:21:14] done you're almost just too
[1:21:19] two more paragraphs here so get Christ
[1:21:22] in your heart Christ and the Holy
[1:21:24] Spirit's the same thing the Holy Spirit
[1:21:27] Christ means The Anointed One and the
[1:21:28] Holy Spirit is that anointing and you
[1:21:30] are the one that's anointed it's Christ
[1:21:33] and you anointing you see what I mean
[1:21:35] then you've got the right thing then he
[1:21:37] can use you to anything he wants to use
[1:21:39] you in because you're in the body and
[1:21:41] subject to any of those gifts but see to
[1:21:45] have one of the gifts outside the body
[1:21:47] it would do you no good that's why we
[1:21:51] say always seek the baptism Holy Ghost
[1:21:53] first make sure you're born again first
[1:21:55] and then after that live in such harmony
[1:21:58] with Christ until you can wait until
[1:22:00] it's God time to use you for a certain
[1:22:03] gift it equals first Corinthians
[1:22:09] thirteen again if I give my body to be
[1:22:11] burned without love it profits me
[1:22:14] nothing he says although I give all my
[1:22:15] goods to feed the poor I fake to move
[1:22:18] Mountain had nothing see don't depend on
[1:22:21] those things the gifts the holy spirits
[1:22:26] of being it's God it's gotten you the
[1:22:27] person God that's lit your whole entire
[1:22:30] being your change you're a new creature
[1:22:33] any little thing that's wrong he'll tell
[1:22:35] you what's wrong then quit don't do it
[1:22:37] father I didn't mean to do that you
[1:22:39] forgive me see that's the Holy Spirit
[1:22:42] see we can recognize the Holy Spirit
[1:22:45] clearly when he's trying to correct our
[1:22:47] lives and get us to repent from the
[1:22:50] wrong that we may have done I don't care
[1:22:55] how much
[1:22:56] Antone's how much you run how much you
[1:22:58] jumped how much you did this that or the
[1:22:59] other
[1:23:00] whenever you done it wouldn't mean a
[1:23:01] thing if the Holy Spirit wasn't in there
[1:23:04] to condemn you on the things that's
[1:23:06] right and wrong so well Holy Spirit will
[1:23:10] condemn you on thing that's wrong now
[1:23:14] that's the reason this person hears
[1:23:15] right let the Holy Spirit do it what
[1:23:18] signs miracles wonders
[1:23:19] let the Holy Spirit do the supernatural
[1:23:21] through you but now you see what's
[1:23:26] causing this let me say with love
[1:23:27] sprinkled with love and anoint do with
[1:23:30] the word if the genuine Holy Spirit was
[1:23:33] in you you wouldn't question that you
[1:23:35] know it yourself it's an individual
[1:23:37] thing between you and God you know that
[1:23:39] some things happened you know that
[1:23:42] there's a change whether anything else
[1:23:45] you yourself you're the change you're
[1:23:47] the one that's done the changing inside
[1:23:49] of you and you know you have it
[1:23:51] whether you spoke with tongues whether
[1:23:53] you jump see you said jumping you might
[1:23:55] jump when you get the bat Suzanne holy
[1:23:56] ghost shouted or anything else you know
[1:24:01] that God lives in you that you don't
[1:24:03] walk with your own mind it's the mind of
[1:24:06] Christ that leads you with the word just
[1:24:08] exactly the way it goes let me add
[1:24:10] something real quick from God's
[1:24:18] from God high up within simplicity from
[1:24:20] Albuquerque New Mexico at the end of
[1:24:23] that sermon brother Graham saw the Holy
[1:24:24] Spirit baptize people the Holy Ghost and
[1:24:26] one of them he said the woman had her
[1:24:28] hands down and he said she was praying
[1:24:30] the Holy Ghost Baptizer in her soul
[1:24:32] brother Anderson all she did she shot
[1:24:34] her hands up in the air started praising
[1:24:36] God that's all she did and she had a
[1:24:38] chequered colored dress on you can look
[1:24:40] that up in the message so he says you
[1:24:43] might speak in tongues you might jump
[1:24:45] you might shout you might just throw
[1:24:46] your hands up and start praising God it
[1:24:50] doesn't really matter what you do you'll
[1:24:52] do something emotional right because on
[1:24:54] the day of Pentecost I thought they were
[1:24:55] drunk we've never seen a drunk person
[1:24:57] you sit there and just not and do
[1:25:00] nothing like a drunk person acts drunk
[1:25:02] there aren't they look like they're out
[1:25:03] of control when the Holy Ghost comes
[1:25:05] upon you you look like you're out of
[1:25:06] control
[1:25:07] praising God jumping shouting raising
[1:25:10] your hands crying screaming something
[1:25:13] prophesy falling down
[1:25:16] something will happen where someone
[1:25:17] would think you're drunk a sinner would
[1:25:20] think you're drunk all right now it says
[1:25:32] in G no we said what if people say well
[1:25:37] then brother brandy you don't believe we
[1:25:38] ought to speak with tongues see then you
[1:25:39] get exactly backwards what I just said
[1:25:42] so my brother said yes it's okay to
[1:25:44] speak with others as long as you got the
[1:25:45] Holy Ghost first and as long as you line
[1:25:48] that gift up with the Word of God
[1:25:50] sure I believe you should speak with
[1:25:52] tongues but you get the e see I get
[1:25:54] these back here this 1500 month okay
[1:25:57] nice talking about other questions
[1:25:59] people don't understand from the
[1:26:00] questions and answer series he says but
[1:26:06] if you don't understand it then ask me
[1:26:07] write it to me if you don't understand
[1:26:09] see just just what I say I I say here
[1:26:13] Paul said follow me as I follow Christ
[1:26:15] and what his brother Graham's
[1:26:17] what is this brother man's example he
[1:26:19] says take everything back to the Word of
[1:26:21] God take the gifts back to the Word of
[1:26:23] God take your life back to the Word of
[1:26:25] God take everything back to the Word of
[1:26:27] God
[1:26:28] he said you see then then you see I'm
[1:26:31] wrong then get away from me see because
[1:26:33] I'd be the wrong person see all right no
[1:26:39] I just want to read one more scripture
[1:26:41] proverbs 4 verse 20 my son attend to my
[1:26:49] words incline thine ear unto my sayings
[1:26:52] so we've got a really listen to the Word
[1:26:54] of God even the sermon deny and the
[1:26:56] sermons were last weekend every sermon
[1:26:58] let them not depart from thine eyes keep
[1:27:02] them in the midst of thine heart for
[1:27:06] they are life unto those that find them
[1:27:08] and health to all their flesh keep thy
[1:27:11] heart with all diligence for out of it
[1:27:14] are the issues of life okay so in other
[1:27:17] words gifts are gonna flow out of your
[1:27:19] heart if gifts are going to flow out of
[1:27:21] your life if keep all this word that
[1:27:24] we've heard in front of our eyes
[1:27:25] keeping it in our hearts see we stay
[1:27:28] under that harmony stay in that
[1:27:29] anointing then the life of God will flow
[1:27:32] out of us the Bible said we keep our
[1:27:34] hearts with all diligence okay god bless
[1:27:37] you we'll close with a word of Prayer
[1:27:39] here now I want to come to the piano
[1:27:41] and worship the Lord a little bit I
[1:27:44] trust that was a blessing like I said
[1:27:46] that's the longest quote I think I've
[1:27:47] ever done as a pastor but it was so
[1:27:50] important see cam brought that up Simon
[1:27:53] brought that up and didn't even know I
[1:27:54] was reading that to me that's a very
[1:27:56] inspired quote because it brings a
[1:27:58] perfect balance on the on gifts and when
[1:28:03] they happen they happen at the timing
[1:28:05] that God wants them to happen but they
[1:28:07] happen more if we were more in harmony
[1:28:09] with the Holy Spirit so we got to keep
[1:28:12] that in mind too and we got to grow up
[1:28:14] out of babyhood into manhood or to
[1:28:17] womanhood into adulthood with our gifts
[1:28:20] but we can't just be a baby with
[1:28:23] miracles we can't be a baby with divine
[1:28:25] healing or a baby with knowledge or
[1:28:27] tongues or prophecy or interpretation we
[1:28:30] can't be a baby with that we got to grow
[1:28:33] up and recognize sin keep sin out of our
[1:28:35] lives
[1:28:36] draw closer to God meditate on the
[1:28:39] things of God keep God's Word in our
[1:28:41] heart
[1:28:42] and then out of our heart will flow out
[1:28:44] the issues of life the gifts and the
[1:28:47] manifestation of the Holy Spirit all
[1:28:49] right we love you God blessed us that
[1:28:50] word of Prayer here one day father we
[1:28:54] thank you for your mercy love thank you
[1:28:55] for this word Lord we read your prophets

[1:29:02] lot of these scriptures we know but we
[1:29:05] need to hear the Prophet bring balance
[1:29:06] to it he's challenging us he's
[1:29:10] challenging your bride his church at
[1:29:11] that time and now he's challenging our
