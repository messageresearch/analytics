thank you Jesus God well brother side we're in America yeah but God has blessed America in such a way but we know those blessings are going to start uh Falling Away by God's grace but it is for our it is for our benefit so uh I'm not going to sing a song today thank you as talented as these individuals are and talent untalented as this is I better not uh you know maybe brother cam was here and he could sing something for you guys but um I'm trying to um maybe get a power point I got a lot of quotes I want to read this just a kind of like a culmination of the last couple things the Lord's uh dealt with me with and maybe some things that brother Cam's been preaching at home and just striking out I'll tell uh uh striking my heart you know and as I see you know time go on and the sermons that are being brought forth in the revelations it's it's really honing down to what our end goal is I mean I I as you see it it's being made more and more plain and we're grateful for those things uh we want to be ready we still want to be ready no matter what and and the Beautiful Thing is God gives you little by little you know as they went to the promised land he said to give you little by little in case to give you all of it and then you know things will get out of out of disr or however but as he gives you little by little that hungering and thirsty guy after the righteousness he just gives you enough to to keep it going you know enough to keep it going enough I I'll say like this sometimes uh I'll just being honest being back uh back home everybody came will be ministering and he'll just say something in one sermon and that that one thing I can chew on that for an entire week even Beyond W not even Wednesday service but just something you would say on like a Sunday I can eat it and just she want just and just uh be sustained I'll say like that that Mana will keep us so anyhow so I don't want to keep you standing here but uh let's jump here to the word of God uh let's go to acts two and verse one good to to be here by God's grace good to see all the saints still Preston brother Austin's uh brother Austin's on the internet making videos my wife was like showed me this video and I'm like it was one of them little ones it's like they call this short or whatever I mean who knows about being short right so um and I watched it I'm like okay well what's the deal you know and she's like well listen to The Voice and what name of that dog I'm like and I still didn't click brother Austin's making these videos and I was like oh man I I hope the Lord continues to bless that and maybe we can get you or they the Lord will bless you to where you be like International Dog star or something I don't know trainer master trainer 2000 I don't know uh so let's go to uh Acts 2 so that was really that was really neat to see something online in here we know the brother that's that to me that's that's cool I don't know I don't that's that's nice you know it's really yeah yeah right I see that I you know I was yeah okay acts Acts 2 verse one uh and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clo tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance amen so this is where we this is and I trust we've all had that experience amen amen okay this is our this is our Genesis right this is that's right uh so now I want to jump to acts n or sorry Revelations 19 the book of the revelation of Jesus Christ chapter 19 and I would like to start at Revelations 197 through uh eight sorry we'll start at verse six 7 through eight and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many Waters and as the voice of Mighty thunderings saying Allelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed and fine linen clean and white for the white linen is the righteousness of saints amen amen let's bow our heads here as we say a word of prayer dear Lord Jesus Lord we love you Lord we're so grateful Lord to be here this morning God and Lord even more grateful that we're still standing God lord and the the Ws of the devil the allurement of the world has not taken us Lord God but Lord You've held that at Bay God you placed a spiritual hedge Lord Lord You've sealed Lord our souls till the day of the Redemption Lord God Lord by that sealing power Lord that's how you keep us Lord and Lord God lord we're so grateful for these things Lord strengthen the assembly here God Lord bless the pastor God give them give us all Lord a double portion of thy Spirit Lord of Grace God and of strength God and of all that we need Lord God lord and we don't know what we have need of for tomorrow Lord for tomorrow is Lord just a uh 24 hours away Lord the future is unknown God but Lord Jesus Lord thou knowest all things Lord and Lord you are preparing us now Lord God Lord help us Lord to enter into that uh into that act or that uh mindset that mode that spiritual mode of preparation greater than we were today God Lord give us strength Lord bless the Saints in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated by God's grace we trust all as well good to be here by God's grace amen the Lord's been faithful at home he's he's kept us uh he uh he just uh corrected me in something just this week this last week here and I was going to try and uh move into something greater as far as uh I already had the certification but I lost it and I wanted to get recertified on something and uh so I went and signed up with it and here it was going to cost me four Wednesday Services I'd have to miss in fact I'd have to go it'd be two times a week it'd be a Monday Wednesday for four weeks and I kind of felt checked in my heart about doing that because you know we're we're a small assembly as well and not too many me members uh um and you know every person when you're at the house of God it counts amen you really pack an anointing you really pack strength and we really really noticed that when uh brother Freddy uh H Hayes there started coming to our church on Wednesday nights he was back on first shift finally and he started coming on Wednesday nights so now and then having him giggling and and laughing at the revelations and that not a not a haha giggling but like an giggling excitement the joy of the Revelation he would and he just kind of Giggles to me on the left there and just that strength of him hearing the word and it affect him in such a way to where it you know it moves his emotions towards God so but that has been such a strength to me and then you say say brother Cam's up preaching and know pray say something I'm just going and I look back like this and he'll be like you know someone I can look to you know just uh so I signed up nonetheless KN it was no was probably going to cost me four Wednesday services and um and then uh I was back in the back there delivering a a letter to brother cam there and uh here it was uh brother Dave has been working late on Wednesdays he's not able to sing on Wednesday so brother Dustin had been doing it then uh when I was back there brother Dustin said Hey Brother cam I won't be here on Wednesday and brother Cam's like well who's going to lead songs and I'm like well I I'll lead songs so that the day afterwards I canceled my certification and just uh I said well Lord this is a correction so it's important to be at the house of God so and I had a feeling I had that check in my heart I said well Lord as the Lord's will and he provided a way out to I had to make a choice and I had I made the right choice I believe so we always want to be faithful at the house of God so am anyhow as we get into this by God's grace everyone feeling all right this morning awake I'll tell you what the time change was a little rough me and my wife we had planned about getting up early and it was the hand of God that she woke up right at 8:00 and we barely just made it here by God's grace but thank God she's a morning more of a morning person than I am and uh you know I was born you know guess when I was born 2:55 p.m. and I let you you let me sleep on Saturday that's when I'm about to wake up right there that's I'm just being honest that's just the truth is my wife my son that's right sure so I don't know if that's always affected me but that's just how the Lord has designed me uh for whatever reason uh but God knows all things so uh in this topic here this study it's good seeing all of you and uh we trust that this morning will be a blessing to you we're going to uh dive into some things here and we want to be a blessing to the house of God we want to be edifying to the bride I when I come uh and I get you usually I pretty pretty much believe my my little Ministry whatever God's called me to teach here is pretty much for my two brothers I mean that's who uses me and uh literally the few that actually do and uh so I believe that when I approach you that you are the bride of Christ and I want to stay with the word the very best that I can and will say what the Lord would has shown me and and I trust that God will will bless it by God's grace so amen amen but Mal I like the suit I really like that suit that's a nice suit so um so this morning I would like to uh Minister on this by God's grace Beyond Pentecost what is beyond Pentecost and what are we aiming at what is the end result and I'll say like this for those that have heard have heard the word of God and we all have testimonies we all have uh our paths that we had to walk through in life and some of us came up uh uh you know the young ones here grew up in the message a lot of us the majority of us have not and the path if we could give testimony of testimony brother Austin is an amazing testimony of here and there and this and this brother amen has his his testimony brother Malachi is like the lord gave me parents my dad's a my dad's a bishop I'm a bishop uh uh the BL the bishop lamb right so everybody's got their testimony everybody's got their thing on how God has brought them to the truth and I'll say like this you know brother B was was talking about uh uh brother brother da there one time and he said he said he said that light flashed before brother da one time and it struck and he was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ at an old man and and God healed him then even as he was getting sick and then uh uh then of course then he went on to be with the Lord but it all it took was that one time to strike and God did something it did something to his soul it affected him in such a way that he had to get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ so here we all have that same testimony something about the word that was spoken something about the way it was presented maybe the way a brother or sister walked or what they said or a sermon that was preached or a life that was lived how something has affected your life in such a way that here you are right now and we all and baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and believe saints of God that we're moving into greater things and and the key obviously the the whole key is I was able to share with uh a man um I've been trying to meet with him on on Tuesdays right after work we'll go and sit at Subway there I have to go right from my job right to Subway wait there for him for an hour and then we get there and we start talking I was trying to emphasize to this man this brother and I'll say he's Justified I'll say like that he is Justified uh but I said brother you've got to move on and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost BN that then you are a new creature in Christ Jesus and that is the only thing that availeth anything right there amen so pray for him he's a fine man been through a very rough life had a very rough life and uh but God is faithful and he's very appreciative when we meet and at the end he said Simon he says you don't know what this means to me and just letting him talk letting him talk for the majority of time about this and rehash things uh of his life and things that scars that the the bind him scars that just just affect him in such a way but then I try and sew in the word of God you know just this and this and he'll he'll then sew some word to me and we'll just speak and we're just kind of just just trying to be a brother to him right amen so um God bless you uh in this first quote here I want to say now notice uh the prophet of God and I'll say like this when I first come and heard this word and I realize the importance of it I realize the impact that this could have and I heard this mystery and I heard the god and I heard the the servy and I heard about the Prophet this this and I thought my goodness I'm move I'm going to come to a church that has the book of Acts operating in it right and uh so when I first started coming then to uh the the word of God and I was like wow this is amazing but then I found out that uh we're not quite there yet they get guess what we're all just regular people we're all have the same faults and failures that the world has absolutely that's right there's no great ones Among Us there's no one high there's no one I can say just wow this one stands out a little bit more than the other though some you know however you want to say it maybe you're a little biased towards this brother or this sister however just because the love and the fellowship or the the connection that you have with them but all in all we're all still pressing towards that High Mark right we're all just striving to get closer to the Lord God Almighty and uh so um when I was in Pentecost there and you know brother Jesse knows all about that about how it was there and there was a hungering for something greater there was always just S as soon as I when I got saved really saved I said man I'm all in started rolling rolling with the with that assembly and however and then there was just something that called for something has got to be more to this word and what God sent it right amen so that's where and I had that same feeling uh years and years and years and years back about even this message I see I see where it is I see how great the word of I see God doing signs on his miracles which we had back in Pentecost uh we see all those things but I think there's just I believe that there's a greater even a higher level right that we can move on to now in uh this one right here he says I'm going to try and give you my text while you're turning he's my uh my tonight is uh text is uh desperations and I and I in desperations now you know what desperation is and now we're going to read from Jeremiah 29 ver verse 10 he says for thus say the Lord that after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you and perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this place no has there be a restoration or returning back to what they were at the beginning right he says for I know the thoughts that I have towards you he says isn't that sweet that God knows your very battles the very things in your life the the church fell in in the Ephesian Church age the whole church fell right there in that first age but he's going to bring us back to the beginning why because that was in his thoughts to bring you back to the start right he says he says the Lord though thoughts of peace and not of evil and not of evil but he's brother Sai he said we're gonna have the bride is goingon to have a rough time at the end yeah but it's not going to be evil you're not going to taste you're not gonna you're not going to see the effects of what we are supposed to go through we're going to be withheld from the Great Tribulation right amen and you know we do not want to be here God granted that none of us Lord that de bride no no one would miss this that they would enter right into the Holy Ghost and receive it and then be caught up together with you Lord God when that great shout voice and Trump come amen he says he says for the thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you the accepted he says and accepted and right he says then shall you call upon me and you shall go and pray pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and you shall seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart he says and I will be found of you sayeth the Lord and I turn away your captivity and I will gather you from All Nations and from all the places where I've drove you sayith the Lord and bring you again back unto the place which I caus you to be carried away captive and then the prophet says what he says back to Pentecost he says I put that in myself it doesn't say that that's what I was meaning to the church right he was applying Something Old Testament he's looking at the scripture the old prophesying of the Jews but then he's applying it what to the Gentile bride and he says we got to go back to Pentecost well this was in 1963 after the seals he said we've got to go back to Pentecost right that was my entire thought for years was going back to Pentecost he says now notice he we got good churches we got good churches we built good churches and better churches than we used to have that's all right there's there's nothing against that I'd like to see the church proper but brother I'd rather see it prosper in the power of the Lord than be prosper in worldly things amen so where is the true word what is true riches the true riches is in spiritual Revelation I'll say that amen because remember the UN search the un uh uh The unsearchable Riches of God Amen so the real riches are what the revelations contain in the Bible amen which are supposed to be given to the bride that are to be revealed to her amen and to have not only that not only the revelations but the very Life of Christ The Joy the peace I'll say it like this the who's the richest man the one that's at peace in great great trials and great tribulations and great this this this it's the one that's in peace that has the fruits of the spirit operating through them in the worst time in their life amen hallelujah and I would say that would be the richest man amen someone that can rejoice and be thankful for all things amen yet being tried very toughly amen amen those in persecution I'll say it like that he says get back he says he says get back to the gospel again get back to the power of God back to Pentecost like the original was but you see the trouble is we don't want to take that beating so there's a price we have to pay to get back there I say like that uh we just had a minister preaching and then uh and he was saying he says he says what we've got to do is gotta get more sincere then as I was speaking to another brother right there he says not only he says sincerity is correct he said but if we're off on the word sincerity will do you very little see so because brother said you can be you can be sincere but you can be sincerely wrong so what we want to do is not only that but we must pray for Revelation first that we are that the truth is being preached the truth is being revealed and then what then pray then what become more sincere and these things will start then to elevate us higher and higher in the word of God Amen so he says but we want don't want to take that beating in other words there's to get back to this there's a sacrifice yes in in the major things that I've sought the Lord for I've had the sometimes I've had to fast three to four days to get the very answer that's burning on my heart and I've only done it a few times maybe three or four but in that time there was such a burden and there was such a fire in my heart that I said Lord God I've got to know this answer Lord God and I'm going to lay down food I'm going to lay it all down I'm just going to wait on you with in within those three or four days he always gave me the answer by God's grace amen now so let's continue on here he says now I heard a great teacher not long ago say uh one great man fine man met me shook my hand and Define brother but he said the but the Acts of the Apostles was just the framework of the church huh in other words he had the framework out here see when the Acts of the Apostles was inside he says and these gospels are the framework to hold it together and protect it so the entire thing that was the whole purpose of God back then 2,000 years ago was to build a church and he built that church and that church was the book of Acts and that was the entire thing but the gospels he said he says these gospels which is Matthew Mark Luke and John he says these are the he said the framework in another quote he says these are the the uh what do you scaffold he called the scaffold anyone know what a scaffold is when you're building on a building a building like putting off this wall and you have the uh let's see a brick brick layers they start at the bottom they lay their their Foundation there and they start piling the bricks there but they get too high for their legs to actually be able to reach it then they put a scaffold up and that's actually just the elev you hire to be able to put more bricks up in other words those uh they have the two sides they have the platform and they have the the uh the oh my goodness the pins not pins but Stakes or however you want to say it uh anyhow they have those little cross cross braces right there that's what they call cross braces so but he said these gospels he says are the uh uh framework that holds it up in other words these gospels are trying now if we apply these gospels these gospels here will actually is what God is still using right now now it fell back then at that as if it was builded and it fell it had to be rebuilt again right so as as as the as we're trying now striving to produce the book of Acts we need these scaffold he says he says or these framework to what rebuild this church right he's pointing back to the book of Acts he's pointing back to the gospels right so it takes these gospels to hold it and he work it together pull it together and protect it amen now notice he says the framework Pentecost isn't the framework of the Gospel the four gospels are the framework back to Pentecost so how are we going to produce this Pentecost that they were talking about and I'll say it like this not just the feeling of one man or one sister at different times or however but a coming down of the Holy Ghost all in one service filling us all at one time where the Shina of glories just continually just moving in waves and waves speaking in tongues and worshiping God and all those sort of things that kind of a service amen and not only that but a spark a Revival that to tore that entire that Revival is what has called us is still look how far that initial burning at actx in Pentecost in Jerusalem is what we are literally the T you ever you ever start a fire in your backyard you ever see fire the there's an initial place where you start that fire and it starts heating up sometimes a little beit pieces of grass or a stick or some leaves and it'll start burning out past your original firepl pit or fireplace whatever and that's exactly what we are this morning amen we're just another burnt little area up here where God is trying to what to get us back to there amen but it's still the same Holy Ghost burning with inside of us amen sure I remember brother I know brother justess remembers when we used to go to grandma smiths and we have big leaf leaf piles and then we burn them and then we have to stomp out all the other fires From the Start Spreading this that that kind of channel that kind of however but God didn't do that he didn't stop the fire he just kept them let on burning all the way through the world amen amen praise be to God and we're in that same channel tonight amen or this morning he says now notice the four gospels are the framework back to Pentecost after they had this framework up he says Pentecost come into existence so literally to bring forth Pentecost it took the very Life of Christ to be lived out and the Very words that he spoke the Miracles the sence Wonders Miracles all that he spoke had to be lived out first before acts could come into into Play Amen so the very things that Matthew heard and recorded the very things that Luke and Mark and John heard recorded were very very important in producing the book of Acts sure and now brother B said not only were they very important producing but they also protect that life right we know the throne guards up in heaven the zoons one's an eagle one's a man one is an ax and then the other one is a lion right and those are four C around the guard the Throne of God protecting God's presence God himself amen he says and down here it's the same way that very book of Acts presence which what is God in his people is protected by those four gospels right so we are very grateful for having eyes to see and ears to hear because if we had if we have those eyes to see and ears to hear we are able that now to look at these gospels and then find the way because Jesus said what straight and narrow is the gate and and straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leadth into life right sure amen he says he says the apostles Jesus walked along doing works and predicting what would come and Matthew Mark Luke John them four guards come and was writing everything they some seemed to come to pass telling it just like it is how is going to happen he says what was going to take place and all of a once they framed it around and here it comes right so notice these gospels are very very important even you tell a new believer you tell a new believer what they come to you with their Bible the brand new fresh Bible it's probably NIV or nsva or whatever The Message Bible or who knows what kind of crazy thing they got out they come say brother sister what what do we read first and he just just read the gospels first because what these are the not now all scriptures given by inspiration of the Holy Ghost but something about those red letters amen something about how if they can just read and try and get get in the spirit of what Jesus was experienced right there and God will lead them and show them what kind of spirit Christ was fighting what kind of spirit was on Christ and I like this in Christ amen and all the fullness of the godhead body dwelt within him amen sure that's right exactly now notice he says he says it is the spirit that speaketh to the churches that is plural not singular Spirit did not have John write this down for a local Ephesian church he says nor uh for the first church age only it was for all Church ages but this is the Church of the beginnings and thus it is like the Book of Genesis what started in Genesis holds true through the entire word he says and finally Clos out in Revelation thus the church beginning in Acts is God's blueprint for all ages until she closes out lives in other words all every age every church is striving to be what back to acts our goal is back to acts right our goal is to produce this and such a way way sure yes and that was my mindset for a long time amen was going back to this and producing this right now uh and I'll say it like this we have the blueprint here we have this blueprint right here which is the book of Acts which we have the whole entire word of God all the Epistles all the revelation of Jesus Christ we have all this information here this is our blueprint right here say like that right we know this and we have to go back to the blueprint and I'll say like this I'm on jobs all the time where they have blueprints or we know they're not blue anymore they're just white they're just prints we just call them prints right they're not blue anymore but maybe in the original draft how they do it now but now it's just white big long pieces of paper with all laid out you got 20 30 40 50 sheets and you got to go through this you got to check this with this got to check this you're laying your plumbing in you got to check your submittals you got to look at this then you got to go what's the ceiling Heights what's the floor Heights what's this this you got to get dialed all in so you can set your Fisher perfect right right but it's all contained in the blueprints in other words when I get done with my plumbing and I had the prince right there guess who's got to come behind me and I I just worked for my brother-in-law brother Dustin now he doesn't know much about Plumbing but now I think he does now he said S I need you to do this for my on on this job I said sure I come in this is this he's like well brother s what about this I said no do it this way what about this I do it this way this way this way this way this is how you do this he's like ah okay okay now I'm teaching him right on these Revelations on the the prints on Plumbing prints right how do you exactly look at these prints and what do you do with them now he had order he had made a parts list and he had this this this and I said brother that print according to that prce he said that's to me I consider that a suggestion because they do everything to minimum code I said if you do it minimum code he says it's gets confusing and then you start ordering this fitting with this thing and I said just order everything this kind of way and he's like okay okay so I had to go get my own parts and that sort of thing right but he seen you know when I got stressed out the day before every inspection because when that inspector and as I'm prepping for the inspector I see it as a type of the Holy Spirit coming through my life amen and if he says if that if that test doesn't hold if he sees that gaze drop one little micrometer he said or millimeter whatever you want to say it is he says there's something leaking I'm like now I got an issue but we were able by the grace of God to find any leaks we're able to find this find that make sure everything was in the walls you had to put your strike strike plates up you got to put your boa plates up you got to make sure everything's tied in everything's pressurized then the inspector comes in okay looks good signed off here's your ticket we'll see you at second rough okay oh you only get one inspection no there's three or four inspections in plumbing I said said guess what after the first inspection you think I was celebrating no cuz I got two more you don't celebrate until that can hols buddy I don't care how good this looks I don't care how I like this even in our churches we have victories we have testimonies but SS of God I'm not fully celebrating until what we make it over amen but I'll say like this if we can catch the Revelation that we've already made it we can celebrate right now amen because who are you trusting on I like this are they trusting in a plumber to get this thing done no I'm this plumber right here is trusting in God to help me get that can to float amen and saints of God if you could see God in your life you are trusting in Him to make this in this Rapture amen praise be to God sure now notice he says thus this church beginning is in Acts is God's blueprint for all ages until she closes out SS of God and when the inspector comes we've got to be lined up exactly according to the beginning Hallelujah when the inspector comes what is the inspector the Holy Ghost is here right now the Bible says wherever two or three he is here right now and Lord God forgive us all yes L all of our iniquities secret faults everything Lord God just place on the blood but when he comes here this morning are we in condition are we looking just like the original blueprint are is is our assemblies like the blueprint it's humbling I know I said like this I'm I'm not I don't see what I want to see in my life amen but I hear I say like this when I hear the prophet talking when I hear him preaching those things I hear the very love that he has for Jesus Christ and one of the studies I just taught brother said he say he says I cannot have my love marred by anything but it must be for the Lord Jesus Christ he goes my love for my wife could Mar my love for Christ my love for my children could Mar my love for Christ my love for my hobbies my love for the the church my love for this this anything outside of Christ he says can Mar your love for Christ right he says he says a lot of times he goes I don't even get to express my love for my own family he says because it would Mar my love for Christ and I read that and I'm just like gosh I said Lord God you got to help me Lord I want every I want my and I I was like this if we could we would change ourselves to be exactly I was like this if we could do it physically I would just like hold this over here and just let it drop and I just clothe right into it I just turn right into it [Laughter] but it's a daily walk it's a it's based on your trials did you pass the test this week Saints did you pass this then when someone pul you down or tried your nerves or this this did you say praise the lord well God bless you brother God bless you amen or did you let something or this kind of you know oh God help me amen now now if God has a blueprint Satan has a blueprint as well oh yes in Revelation 17 he said that old had many daughters these daughters just like their mother he says they sat they set the word aside I'll say like this if I get a bill come up and I just got my check and I'm GNA be short on I have to make let's say I gotta pay my I got you gotta pay your T ties right but what if what if you don't make enough money to pay your ties and make that bill what do you choose ties we pay our ties let the bill collector come and I was like and and the Bible says what a soft answer appeases the I'm like sorry sorry guys I uh I I'll send it next week for sure I I I'll do my best by God's grace to pay that bill this this this they're like well sir you know you're like I know I know but let's just give me a little time and just talk real soft gentle maybe to the bill man bill collector he said now notice he says what did they the first thing in God's or Satan's blueprint is what they set the word aside deny the work of the spirit of God subject subjugate the Ley and make it impossible for the Le to worship God unless they come through their own pattern well this is how we worship without getting a little too Pentecostal or maybe getting too much too excited or too can be fanatical saints of God a little fire is better than no fire somebody just told me brother Jess had a powerful service here so we're all dancing and shouting and screaming saints of God that's exactly right get excited for Jesus amen thank God for it amen and just worship why because God inhibits the praise of his people amen sure absolutely what CU God loves to see a people excited about him I say like this if I would come home from a hard day of work my wife was like at the front door got my dog all primmed and this guy got his jacket on and everything and then she's all dialed in and this and that and she's got food there and just like wel some welcomes me in like a king I'd be like whoa what's today what name Mr our anniversary birthday I would be like well I guess I'm the king of the house I guess I am the man but notice just something similar just something like that towards God worshiping him praising him just thanking him for everything every for every trial for every for every mind battle that he delivers us out of and he keeps us and he keeps us he has kept us how what about your mind battles have they have you had some where they're so intense you feel like giving up have you had him so intense it's like what am I doing I should just leave and go back but God has kept you amen he has kept you all the way amen I've had so many mind battles just and I'll say like this I literally have spoke so evil of myself out of my own mouth Lally if if God would have honored what I said I'd probably be in hell right now because you I think so little of myself but in that I and I know exactly what time I'm referring to in my mind my memory but in that same time where I was beling belittling myself so much after like 45 minutes I said s you're just worth listen something supernaturally just came and twisted that and all of a sudden that Spirit left and I did nothing I didn't do anything I didn't pray but he had to come and Deliver Me from the very mindset I had yes now maybe someone the Lord anointed someone to pray for me uh 10 miles or 50 miles away or however at that moment and God delivered me I don't know but I know this I was in such a black State a dark state of my mind against myself against me and God had to come down to change that and it was halfway through the work day and the rest of the day I was just like I was fine that man like that man in the gines he was cutting himself he didn't like himself he say had self-hatred this and this and don't care about his his wife and family didn't care he just left and became a wild man than God that that those Spirits are still alive today but God has kept us amen amen now notice we'll get into this here real quick here he says through he says he says and they make impossible for Ley to to worship God unless they come through them or through their pattern which is nothing but a blueprint of unbelief from Satan himself right now if if the the gospels are the the guards or the framework or the scaffold if you will notice the protection the book The Matthew 24 has we're just going to run through this because I got a lot we're already 37 minutes in notice the protection of Matthew what is the truth here what is the true Revelation this is the true Revelation right here right but in Matthew that first book of the gospels God places this Jesus says this specific scripture in such a way SS of God do you know this scripture right here will keep the majority of people out of Heaven 99 95 90% of all people who do not make go go to heaven that are claimed to be Christians this scripture right here will will keep them out do you understand that this is a throne guard yes amen this keeps them if they believe this scripture without Revelation if they do not understand what he is talking about right here they will go into tribulation that's right they will at best be foolish virgin that's right Throne guard but this right here is the this is it right here this is the blueprint if you don't have if God does not come to you and give you eyes to see and ears to hear and give you Revelation you'll never be be able to understand what this means Hallelujah right well brother Sai brother Jess uh Pastor Jess uh that it says what it is it says exact what it means does it yeah if you have the revelation of what he's saying but if you don't you're going to miss it very sincere people just might when at work and I witness to him he's like well brother I know I see where you're going I'm no I'm GNA stay with this like please I'm not going to argue with him praise the Lord praise the Lord amen notice here Mark 16 and he say to them go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved notice I was baptized brother look I was baptized this way and I am saved because what I believed I was baptized notice Mark is a guard protecting the Throne of God protecting the very presence the very life of protecting eternal life he says in these signs he says he he believeth and baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned so notice if they do not believe they will not truly be baptized being baptized F the Holy Ghost is not being baptized that is a false impersonation just like I said this a a a fake $1 bill is not a $1 bill why don't need to get re-baptized technically there is no such thing as uh well well what is the scripture scpt say let me see here in Acts 19 let's just go right to it acts 19 does it say rebaptism notice they were already baptized in John under John's baptism he says and what you were baptized he said then then Paul said John verely baptized with baptism repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should be come after that is on Christ Jesus and when they hear this they were baptized didn't say they were re-baptized they were baptized see so that was just that was just a substitute baptism it was a foreshadowing it was a it was something before the real had come just like those in the Red Sea that went through under Moses that was not baptism the true baptism see but we had to get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ amen now notice not not not only does he Pro protect baptism but he also protects this and he who believeth in baptized shall be saved but and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues and shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing shall not hurt them they shall be laid on hands on the sick and they shall recover notice it protects also the wonders of the powers of God healing all those things that protects them because some saywell I was baptized by The Ghost and I still have signs wers Miracles the Bible says you shall not know them by their signs he says you'll know them by their fruit what is Matthew 7 says uh Lord Lord have we not done this and done that in thy name these wonderful works and Jesus say what he said depart from me you workers of iniquity right so you can have signs wonders and miracles testimonies this this but if you're not obeying the word of God and know to do it it's a dangerous place to be right yes sir amen now notice what Luke Luke right here is protecting the book of Acts I'm just pulling these are just quotes in the script the message I'm just doing without the quotes in Luke 10:1 he says after these things the Lord appointed and others Al other 70 also he sent them two and two by two by two in his face and every city place whether he himself would come therefore he said to him the the harvest truly is great but the labors are few pray therefore the lord of the Harvest he would send for labors into his Harvest go your ways he says behold I sent you forth as Lambs Among Wolves he says carry neither Pur nor script nor shoes and slute no man by the way in other words and brother BR breaks all these things down he says look he said when you go he don't try try to take as little as possible take as little as possible he he he says don't even take any money script uses us that he says and and as you go have have the leading of the Lord to where you know exactly where you're supposed to go and don't stop anywhere else this is how the original book of Acts performed their works right here this is their life right here this is exactly how they lived but what here is Luke is showing it but if they don't catch the revelation of what's the big thing now what we see the big name ministers as far in denomination they'll take their private jets and they'll fly and have carbon emissions beyond what I could do in a year or a lifetime just to go over and preach one sermon or a whole two day or three day crade re rent rent the biggest uh uh fstar Hotel they can and whoever who knows where all this and this and that's contrary to the word of God and they'll never be able to produce the book of Acts because it went contrary to this amenah sure now let's continue on here now here's the big one notice where this is recorded under the eagle anointing very very I saying to you he that believeth on me the works that I shall do he shall do also in great Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father see this is the eagle brother B said he called this the eagle of angelist he said and these are Greater Works that you will do what of this Eagle anointing he says because I go unto my father he says whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do in the father that may glorify uh may be glorified in the son and it shall and if you ask anything in my name I will do it but what's one of the qualifications everybody uh remember uh uh Jesse duplis back when uh was it Katrina or however was coming around there wiping he had he had his whole church fasting and praying and he spoke against the storm and it missed his church and he linked it he in his sermon he says he linked it to this he says if I ask anything in his name and yet they baptized fals wow but remember these Greater Works are not the goal the goal is Pentecost yes the life do we want the power or do we want the life see the life is everything you can have every sign Wonder Miracle following you but if you don't have eternal life we'll miss it amen but remember the true bride will have both power and eternal life amen and they'll be able to point the Bible say they be Point others to life as well and get them there amen praise be to God it's a such a fine line the Christian walk notice in John 157 he says if ye now here's the key if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you but what we've got to have the word of God running through us saturating us the very the very sermons that Pastor Jesse is preaching and these scriptures and everything the revelations he's bringing has got to be running through us to where you and the word become one here and is my father glorified you may bear much fruit watch signs and wonders Miracles he says so shall you be my disciples amen praise the Lord now let me let me show you a little in our day let me me show you the production in our day and we've seen so many battles on this in Matthew 11 very very I say unto you among them that are born of women there shall n sh not raise has risen a greater than John the Baptist notwithstanding he that least in the Kingdom shall be greater than he Kingdom of Heaven shall be greater than and from that days of John until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffered violence and the violent takeen by forth for all the prophets and the law prophesied unto John and if you receive it this is Elias which was for to come and this scripture right here will protect many people I like this will guard many people from being able to see this message brother brah is not Malachi 4 look it's John the Baptist he's Elijah or elas look brother Sai look John Jesus him God in flesh said John the Baptist Was Elijah to come when that when when was that Malachi 45 what what happened directly as Mal Malachi 45 The Book of Matthew guarding what eternal life well why is it so important to guard the messeng of the hour because this message of the hour this messenger was brought to restore all things this is not just guarding that first church age this is not guarding the first church age this is guarding the last Church age to where what the word had to be restored and what do we find the Resto restored word the true baptism and the true eternal life the true Jesus Christ not God in three persons but God in one person this right here we went through this when we come to this scripture we walked right in past it because we had God gave us eyes to see and understand what it really was amen we entered in at the East Gate amen that's Judah amen that's the East Gate we want right on through well how many did we have to go through we had to go through this one too and Jesus answered then said well we thought Elias was supposed to come first and Jesus answer said truly Elias shall come first and restore all things okay well then he says that Elias has come already already you knew him not look it is John the Baptist but we went right on because God revealed us now if we would if we would have stopped there m Matthew 11 we would have been stuck if we couldn't see but then God gave us greater light here that says what he says there is an Elias to come he sh he shall come and restore all things and then AR ah there it is there's two Elijah amen and fact then we Catch Re there's five Elijah oh my goodness then the whole revelation of them we walk right right go right in the book of Acts and baptized see guard look at all the guards you had to bypass I say this you walked right past said nice to meet you Mr guard Matthew nice to meet you I'm going in he's like all right you see it yep I see okay [Laughter] thank remember it's well it just looks like a book look how spiritual this is this is a spiritual kingdom yes therefore if this is a spiritual Kingdom this has spiritual guards this is a supernatural spiritual guard situation here wait because because I read a scripture and didn't understand it I'm not going to enter in yeah exactly because you're trying to enter into something spiritual you have to have spiritual eyes to enter in it is spiritual and if you can understand this if God has revealed you this and revealed you this you're going through amen amen praise the Lord now notice here you want to go see the eagle testimony of this and this now notice Matthew says John the Baptist John the Baptist but then when we come to the north gate or the eagle gate spiritual gate John the Revelator the type of the Bride would be the only ones to catch this Revelation notice how open now notice how Open this gate on the North side is notice how the eagle anointing gate is wide open for eyes to see and ears to hear remember you have to go from light to light to light if we fail to miss one light in that path we're going to miss it right and this is the record of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites to Jerusalem ask him who art thou he says and he confessed he but confess he says I am not the Christ and they asked him what then art thou Elias and he sath I am not wait a second he says art thou that Prophet what prophet is that Malachi 4 that's the only one Elias Malachi 4 Elias Malachi 4 Elias he says and he answered no but for the those on the eagle anointing those under the anointed Eagle evangelist that went across seven times this is our gate this is where we enter in Saints this is our gate right here right and if we were able to notice this is the first chapter of John he didn't want you to miss anything else but this is the first chapter he says well he makes that first little thing step easy why because we understand that that John the Baptist was not Malachi for amen [Music] amen well brother side what's it protecting what is this protecting what's m Matthew 11 protecting this right here repent you therefore and be converted that your sins may be BL out from the from for when the times are refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord and He Shall send Jesus Christ was poor priest whom Heaven Must receive until the times of restitutions of all things that's what the restoration of all things see look there's the book of Acts right there right amen showing you what that the prophet would be sent but was guarded by the guards but within that throne room within the presence of God he's released and revealed there's going to be a restitution there's going to be a restoration of a prophet right he says uh he said by the mouth of God all his Holy Apostles the world began for Moses truly said unto the fathers a prophet of the Lord shall your God raise up unto you your brethren like unto me and he shall hear all things whatsoever shall say unto them amen see what we've received this if you're sitting here you've received that you saw it God opened your eyes to thisen and this leads us right to the book of Acts so now I want to I'm sure brother Jess may have taught this before because he's taught so much stuff three services a week videos I mean BR J I'm not I'm not gonna lift you up here I'm just gonna say man God bless you I I don't know how I don't know how you do that but somebody had to be anointed to do that yes really anointed to do that so I'm going to take you what is our end goal are we supposed to go to the book of Acts what are we supposed to be what is our our aim in this hour now my pastor's been on this series for a little bit so I'm going to just hit this hid this way okay because this refocused me in the book of Acts they were all together in one place in one Accord then the Holy Ghost came down and filled them all but what can do were they in at that time they were new born babes they were a woman they were born as a young woman a baby a female baby because every church is a type of woman they were babes right then and Jesus Christ is a man he's God almighty God he is the word he always was the word he's Eternal and if that kind of a person which is Christ the Eternal God who is word is coming back looking for a wife what kind of woman what kind of a girl is she coming back for a baby a girl or a woman he's coming back for a woman not a freshly born woman but a woman so look at this little handmade diagram I made here the book of Acts right here everything starts right here everything this is our this is our this is our life this is our life this is our history this is our genealogy yes but after this time the Saints begin to grow up and out of this one woman that was born this woman produced seven other women seven other churches the Church of Rome Corinth galatia Ephesus Philippi colasse Colossians and Thessalonians seven churches came out of that one movement you understand this I'm gonna read I got some quotes here to read for you what is Jesus coming back for there's eight here what kind of woman he's coming back for which one does he want brother just don't preach it you can after I'll let you up after thank you brother God bless you notice now as I said a moment ago the false Vine came into the fruti full fruition in this age her fruit would be would mature and right that is correct this evil spirited Church full of iniquity will be revealed as a mustard seed the gr of the tree lodge the fowls of the air and at her head will be the Antichrist the mystery ini that is true and if this is true then it must also be true that the bride church WIll mature amen and her rightness shall be an identification with her Lord by means of what signs words and miracles anointings gifts callings testimonies why about this Kingdom and if God if it was revealed to John that North Throne guard that that scaffold gate if it was revealed to him that Jesus was the word and the word wants to be and is revealed also that he is the bridegroom this word is a bridegroom then the wife must be a mature word bride if these words abide in you and I in them or however ask what you will he says and her head will come to her in the mystery of godliness which is indeed which indeed is Christ go to the yellow then as she nears her headstone becoming like him through the word now are miracles in the word absolutely our signs and wonder in the word are healings the word absolutely speaking tongues the word absolutely but it's got to be all the word yes amen now what church what church what church did our Malachi 4 pinpoint was what Christ was coming for because if you read the church age book he just says get back to Pentecost back to Pentecost back to the book of Acts it they'll once she realize the blaze another Trails the book of Acts but I'll say it like this it has to be someone who cannot be deceived this time Eve freshly out of being pulled out of Adam for who knows how many years or months or weeks the serpent comes boom Falls within 20 years of this she fell within 20 years of the birth of this church these all formed and and they all fell they all fell so what's he looking for what is our goal now on brother side we got eight choices I got a lot of quotes that say here but there's a lot of quotes that say somewhere else well we know the Corinthian Church Paul continually had to tell them one had a Psalm one had a tongue he says one had this one had that why if Paul believed in speaking tongues why he didn't tell it to the Ephesians but he didn't tell it to the Ephesians he could teach them predestinated and great things but these babies he had to give them baby food yet see he couldn't raise up and tell them high things who reached maturity the Ephesians reached maturity I say like this back in when I was in the fourth grade I was in the fourth grade my wife was graduating do you think my wife would have visited my elementary walked through the elementary aisles and looked through there and checked all the elementary school like oh I like that one right there that little cute guy do you think she'd be like the love of my life that's that kid that boy no at least I hope not she had to wait for me to grow up a little bit more not a whole lot but just a little bit more and [Music] mature it must everything must reach reach maturity amen Bible says the stature of a fullness of God Christ is coming back for a mature bride that's right but these babies he had to give them baby food yet see he couldn't raise them up and like this if brother Pastor Jesse is preaching something too deep go and talk to him about it and explain it the same God who answers your prayers for provision yes for food for finances and you pray for those you pray for sickness over a young one or a little one and God answers that same God can give you Revelation in fact I think he'd rather actually have give you Revelation more than anything else outside the Holy Ghost so brother Jess's Pastor Jesse is preaching too deep just go say Jess can can I have a little side study on this could you explain this a little more and he will I believe that because why a pastor is apt to teach do you think brother Jesse is a teacher or not just saying now now notice what he says he says and the world is full of Corinthian ISM today brother Jess what was Pentecost Assemblies of God do god like boom thank you we saw this marriage this guy dating I mean it it was unbelievable was going on on there why spoken tell us I got 35 prayer languages look at this Revelation now they're coming up with things these things called manifest even non-christians even say well we're speaking it we're we're dwelling on this thing that's going to take place and it will because they have faith God is good to all of them and I'll tell you this I did a little study back when I got from Thailand and the pastor over there mentioned it to me just mentioned it and if you look when God was making a covenant with Abraham he told Abraham go get a she goat go get a hepher right he says and go get a ram he says and slay those th things he says for thy seed so out of Abraham is going to come three kinds of people because those sacrifices have to cover for them was Ishmael seed of God or not but he was still blessed because he was under one of those sacrifices then you see what he says after that and then then he jumps back then to and look what the sacrifice was for Isaac Abraham's got the knife and he's going to slay Isaac he turns God says don't do it Abraham's like and he turns and sees a sheo nope not that sacrifice did he turn see a heer nope that's not what he saw he saw a Ram so Isaac's sacrifice will only be under a ram amen now notice the world is full of Corinthian ISM today sure they show you this Lord I've never blah blah right ties it with with Thomas now let's continue on here we got I'm at hour five give me a little bit here I'm I'm going to run I'm I'm start running here by God's grace he says now notice what he ties right here to the Ephesians this will be an Ephesian Church which goes right back to what John John 15 and6 because remember brother Ram said he says he says Joshua and Ephesus parallel each other that's right they're just like each other the prophet is off the scene Moses went off the scene then God comes to Joshua says you're the guy as I was with Moses so shall I be with you amen that's right he said that was the Ephesians so as we mature this is our goal brother said the only he says only look what he says here he said the sun was going down if them Kings had a great uh to get their their self together again the next day he would surely lose men but Joshua knew he needed sunlight and he looked to the Sun and said stand thou still th over gibian the moon over aelon for the space of a whole day about a day the Bible says that all all that night the sun sit still the moon Stood Still that's a paradox a man walking in the will of God will do such a thing for he was a again an in an Ephesus in an Ephesian with the gospel let me like this the prophet of God came and had a Revival we had a Revival for what he said 20 years how many churches have formed now and what will the maturity of each one be like see this is all it's the individual Affair well they're doing this and ites it doesn't matter are you going to be the Ephesians am I going to be the Ephesians yes am study the Ephesians out they're the only ones that the full five-fold ministry was revealed to they're the only ones who understood how this works yes and had a revelation why because this was a deeper thing amen Acts 19 Acts 20 the Ephesians were the only one that was preached the nickan spirit Grievous wolves that's nickolus Ephesians was so the wife chosen wife of God she was so the mature one one that he picked that church to be the first church age representation in that acts Revelations 2 and three because remember what went down what he used as example to go down in death would have to be resurrected so study that first church age within that is our way back they hated the Deeds of neans I'm talking about Ephesians I'm talking about a mature wife if the word could discern the enemy so can the wife that's right if the husband can do great things of God if the husband can create all things the wife can also control it but what she has to reach maturity which will come to a humble Meek group right yes nothing great about them and they will know they are nothing nothing but they have something in them the Holy Spirit now there have been hundreds of men many men raised up he said been only been for hundreds and hundreds of years they had no Prophet oh they had priests and great men and we read the history down between the time of Malachi and Matthew 400 years they had great men but there was no prophet and then when he come on the scene to prove that he was that Ephesians made manifest Jesus was an Ephesian because what was the whole point to produce oh to produce the book of Acts no the whole produ the whole product was supposed to be Ephesian he birthed them there to bring forth a wife in fact he sent his first age Prophet messenger there for three years because he said what for three years I worn the with sighing and crying in tears telling you these things were coming he literally brought forth his first Church age and sat them right there the Ephesians to raise them up into the correct understanding yes we better be in these quotes we better be in these sermons listening find Co to coming toing toothing these things right just finding all the Nuggets everything we can find because this is what we want to be right but according to promise uh according to Revelation 10 Malachi 4 Luke 24 22 says there is promised it friends there must come in Ephesians that these Sevenfold Mysteries of the word of God must be unfolded and it's in the leoson church this takes place I believe we're we're there so notice who's the only one that's going to catch these Thunders the Ephesians if you look at that they they think oh it's the Seven Seals no because here at 65 it's the seven Thunders going forth he said he'll take an Ephesians to catch that see that's why we have to mature take every quote every everything we can find every scripture bring everything back to the Bible every quote must be taken back to this this right here I say take the quotes back through the throne guards see if they line up with Peter James and John amen the true bride will be able to place these things and hit it just exactly because what it had to be amen he says predicted here in the scripture that I think that we're living in the Ephesians again back back to the promise that we left off during those seven Church ages now I got a little bit left here hopefully we can go through this real quick I'm not trying I'm we only got one service brother Jos you going to take a nap I'm going to take nap too by God's grace absolutely so we're going to get some rest after this just this just look at this a little B longer right amen now notice there is promised it friends there must come in Ephesians that these Sevenfold Mysteries of the word of God must be unfolded so I'm GNA I'm going to show you the quote that everybody leans on literally the only quote everyone leans on it's in the church age book now this messenger of Malachi 4 Revelation 107 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he will will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in these Seven Seals did Brother Braham teach the seven Thunders what sermon was it what quotes were they what are they he did not teach it in a revealed way and everybody leans on this now notice he revealed the seven Mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation which are the Revelation contained in the Seven Seals are the seven thunders in the seventh seal yes they're in the seventh seal so they're in the Seven Seals but it's the seven seal itself because brother bam said what he says in the seven sealed sermon he said he said this morning he says revealed the Seven Seals in a three-fold manner he said and to best of my understanding I'm going to reveal that first fold he said that first fold of the seventh seal was the seven Thunders got all the quotes now notice now notice what now notice he ties look what he says here and then notice what he says here and you're going to see he ties it right to the Ephesians we find out then when he gets killed with the sword to the sword of the word God's sword sharp word sharp two edged sword slays them puts them right down there wait till them seven Thunders he says are uttered utter their voices to the group to that group who's that group The Ephesians who can really take the word of God in hand in there it'll slice and cut they can close the heavens notice they're controlling goes right back to Joshua controlling nature itself back to Adam State Back to Eden back to the Ephesians he says though close whatever they they close the heavens they can shut it or do with this whatever they want to do Glory he'll be slayed by the word and proceeds out of his mouth is sharper than twoed sword he they would call him 100 billion tons of flies if they wanted to amen whatever they say it's going to happen because it's the word of God coming from the mouth of God if the word husband has a wife it'll be a word wife and at that time she'll receive these things and produce just like Joshua did now when hit these and these are just some I'm just sharing just a couple whosoever should take one word from the Bible or add one word to this his part will be taken the Book of Life what is it the Revelation all it's been given Miss back there to bring it's already wrote It's not written in the Book of Revelation of Jesus Christ but it's written in here he says he says it's in here it's revealed it's to reveal what's already been written see because you can't add one thing to or take one word from it these last seven Thunders will be written right in the scripture now I'm going to show you some quotes here he says and he said there will be hideous sights upon the Earth Locust with hair like women long hair to taunt them women to cut their hair teeth like lions stingers and Tails like scorpions they would torment men months just wait till we get to when's this August 65 he's only got four more months till the Lord takes them home just wait till we get the opening and plagues and seals and them seven Thunders watch what takes place oh brother you better get to Goan while there's still time to get to Goan don't pay attention to this outside and if there's a time to listen don't pay attention to what's going on outside Wars Insanity everything's crazy it is gone focus on Jesus Christ the Ephesian amen now notice here's that here's that quote he says now now do you notice on the opening of the seventh seal it's in a three-fold mystery this one I will have speak on I spoke that is the mystery of the seven Thunders the seven Thunders heaven will unfold this mystery it will right at the coming when's it coming back then with brother Ram he said no he says it'll be coming now brother Ram thought it was the coming of the Lord listen to his sermons right at the end of 62 and 63 and he was he said this is could this be it is this the cut is everything cut off has the lamb went and took the book and now there's no more salvation he thought it was right then the sth under heaven will unfold this mystery it' be right at the coming of Christ because Christ said no no one knew when he would return so then he identifies when the Thunders were uttered it's coming soon these seven Revelations are coming and they'll be written right in the word of God notice he said now notice this is the one I found uh Lord showed me about six months ago and I was not allowed to have the auditorium and finally they gave they kind of gave us permission we could have one service but we could not pray for any sick I don't that's my Ministry I have to tell to do what the Holy Spirit tells me to do so I refused it because uh that I want to be at Liberty to do whatever the holy spirit says to do now see uh so I thought we could just suffer one more day anyhow in the Tabernacle and it's cool this morning Lord willing but what was his point what was what do he want to do at this meeting he says in doing this I have come here for the purpose of teaching the last vials the last the last seven th the veil vials and the last seven trumpets and the last last seven thunders of the Book of Revelation tying them together in this hour that we're living now to follow the opening of The Seven Seals in the seven Church ages but we couldn't get room to do it so God shut it down notice he was going to do it right then this morning he's going to reveal what they were but God shut it down so we should get room to do it so I hope soon as I can I we can get to a place sufficient for that so notice he wanted to teach it he wanted to preach it but God said hold back yeah I think we already read that one now look here 8:22 that same month look what brother Ram says he says I believe we got one of the most Dreadful times to go through and I believe we that same thing we got a drel time to go through that ever laid before human beings and I'm waiting for the hour that we can get to everybody together a chance where we can get off from work and spend a few days and we can get some set up somewhere where I can speak on those plagues and things to fall in the last days to throw about two or three weeks together and bring that together if the Lord lets me live to do it and will inspire me to do it see how those things will drop in and those Thunders see he never preached it then you'll find out what that man them people and see dreaming and all those S they come to pass you'll notice what them re revealed them great Thunder to come forth was out of the Skies now so forth you whole bunch of you he says you know that I know what that means what that means you see so he says he says I know what they are he say I know what they are he that's how he could preach him that's why he wanted to preach him because it was revealed to him that first fold of the seven seal he says I know what they are he says but let's just wait until the time comes you see for it to be see so and it'll be more in season and we waited 60 years the prophets pulled off the scene and I really think the Lord took the prophet off the scene because he was going to preach these before the coming of the Lord and what the what what what was what was revealed in the seventh seal he said if these things were revealed if God would not told John to seal these things up he said great damage would have been done by the devil now I'm going to shift here real quick in closing here one we're an hour and 20 seven Thunders will come at the end of the age right before it's coming they'll they they'll show so don't worry about that it's coming but now notice here this is one of the scriptures I start off let us be glad and rejoice and give honor unto him for the marriage of the supper of the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready so how do we become now notice his wife that's an Ephesian wife hath made herself ready What did the what did the Ephesians have to hear what notice and his wife hath made herself ready how did she know to make herself ready and how did she make herself ready and as I read this I said why was this injected in Revelations 19 and not Revelations 3 or Revelations 4 this should have been in the church age book I'm sorry yeah in in Revelation 3 right at the end of L was in church age but it's not contained there why because remember this what John the the revelation of Jesus Christ is a vision and the angel the eagle was sent to hand walk John through this Revelation and the angels with John let me show you this let me show you this let me show you this John's like looking at all of it and as he as he would go through the passage of time the seven Church ages and then that last amount of time there from Revelations 4 all the way to 22 all the way into eternity from that John's looking at all of it but he's going through it chronologically and then the spirit would say something or Jesus would say something or the angel would say something but notice directly here the angel or I like this uh I think there's a voice from Heaven says that the bride has made herself ready but what did she hear what did she hear and what was her what was her Mission what did she have to do how does how does the wife make herself ready here let this be known scripture does not play with words whatever is in the record is there for the anointed eyes to see it is there for a purpose why was this contained in Revelations 19 why did it strike right there because directly after this we we see they John sees after he sees the wife ready he actually sees then Christ on the White Horse with his sword and the name on his thigh and all those sort of things and the armies of Heaven follow him down to take over to start the Millennium Reign but that's after the wife had already went up but he's seeing this but right before he sees the coming down of Christ and the bride to take over for the mum rain before he sees that he's told the wife's made her ready made yourself ready maybe the Lord allowed him to see that to have something to get ready for let me tell you what the Lord showed me right here what why how did she know to make herself ready and what did she make herself ready with and why in Revelations 18 and after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mighy with a strong voice saying Babylon the greatest Fallen as Fallen has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul Spirit and the cage of every unclean hateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wine of Wrath of fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the Earth are waxed Rich the merchants of the Earth have waxed Rich what's this inflation they're just waxing richer and richer you know as well as I do that stuff doesn't cost anymore no it doesn't it doesn't go to Home Depot I grabb like a little bag of fittings 100 bucks just for a just a few things why is it that expensive because the merchants of the Earth have raised the prices they call it inflation but the truth is they want more money and that's something we just do we suffer now notice what it says and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins that he receive not of her plagues there it is how does she make herself ready come out of her my people that's her and her daughters and anything false that false blueprint come out of anything like that because we have the real blueprint amen and we have a protection around it but saints of God how does she make us already come out of anything that looks like organization any false Doctrine take out come out of anything that doesn't line up with the word of God that's how because it' be a word bride so for her to be a word bride she's got to have nothing hybrid organizational anything attached to her Harvest Time yes Harvest Time the two vines that grew together were entwined the branches but are now to be separated the fruits of those Vines which were at such variance will be gathered into separate gardeners thank God the two spirits will go their separate destinations now it is time to heed the final call that comes only to to the wheat bride amen only the bride is able to understand this that's right only the Ephesian bride the Ephesian church will be able to understand this scripture what to come out of yes thank God for eyes to see and ears to hear anything the world churches are doing get away from it anything old Catholic uh Lodge does don't do it anything the assembly God do don't do anything go right on Down the Line have you noticed they just showed the Pope in the wheelchair now he's about ready to go he's getting older he can't walk he's in a wheelchair now just okayed homosexuality literally just okay that it's good to go where are we at could this next Pope be the one could be the could be this well let's just take that quote when that Pope comes out of America will it be an American Pope I don't know I don't know we don't know but it's going to be one of these popes one of these days come out of her my now take High take now is time to take heed to the final call that comes only to the wheat bride my I love that come out of her my people that be not partakers of her sins and that ye wheat receive not her tear plagues the Great Tribulation of six seal Revelations Matthew 24 if you're a wheat bride you will hear the wheat call and you know it's amazing in the m in the English language that wheat and weeds or weed and wheat sound so much alike it's ordain that's ordained right so saints of God this is our goal right here raising up full maturity in the word of God aim this is our AIM now but we've got to have this make sure we're baptized sealed the Holy Ghost and he will mature you now notice what he's doing before notice what he's doing this time before the disciples were mature before they mature he gave them the power and they fell before Adam and Eve were mature he gave them power and they fell but this time he gives us the holy ghost first so that we can mature and then when the power Falls there'll be no turning back there'll be nothing to stop her if if the Rapture wouldn't take place she would take over yes yes because if she's at the point where she can control everything wind rain fire everything he if she can control it all she'll take over but God said no I will not punish the righteous or the holy with the wicked it's not time to take over yet girl my love he says we're GNA I'm going to go and feed you a little bit gain your strength give you a little rest and then at time we're going to go back and then we'll take over amen amen we will be in there amen you believe your bride you believe you're the Ephesians absolutely am yes man my pastor started teaching this like in I think it was the end of November or however and it took me my entire Focus for 20 plus years been the book of Acts the book of Acts book of Acts no it's a mature wife it's a mature Church brother said he's all n Street spiritual gifts everything will be operating perfectly I am shooting for that I can go a little further but we'll call it's been an hour and a half let's just stand here by God's grace every we fine amen all well understand yes remember Ephesians what aimed at and relaxed the only thing the only we need to be relaxed in is in putting our trust in Christ yes relaxing in his Spirit refreshing in his spirit trusting in Him but we've got to get aimed at and bring him fully back to our first love amen amen all is well he my musicians mici not magicians musicians could you come play Here by God's grace sometimes when they play it's like it's pretty phenomenal to me I don't know I couldn't figure it out uh so anyhow we trust all is well this one has been on my heart I've been wanting to teach it an off shoot of what my pastor been preaching there because it really gave me a new vision of what Christ expecting what he's looking for when he comes maybe brother Pastor Jesse already preaches I don't know but I this was something on my heart so may God bless you keep you if you need anything you need prayer or anything we'll come pray for you you can you can claim it right at your seat however put oil or however you want to do it um but we're trusting in the Lord Jesus Christ everybody bless this morning amen everybody have their their sight set their new focus in their hearts Lord God this is what I want to be right there now now you can say specifically in your prayer say Lord I'm an Ephesian I am you can literally speak it out of your mouth say I am an Ephesian because brother Ram said he said he said your body will have to obey you will it will obey what comes out of your mouth if you think you're a weak Christian say man I'm just not good today then then the things you spoke will take place in that day you will not be good that day if you speak it out but if you say Lord God God I am your wife he says I'm your bride Lord God mature me bring me to what you want me to be what what what you me to look like in the spiritual realm right amen so now we can pray that and aim our prayers towards that and God will take care of the rest amen amen so let's see let's uh uh let's just say a word of prayer here if there's anything you desire as we spoke here about the Ephesians that's our that's our that's one of our desires I know that but if you had need of anything you just ask the Lord right now I believe he's here ask with faith just take a little mustard seed you don't need all of God you just need that little portion of faith in your heart and it'll take place all right let's just bow our heads dear Lord Jesus Lord we love you Lord God we're so grateful Lord for your word and Lord God if we you would have never

Lord God make me like the Ephesian Lord God make me the wife make me the wife the bride you want me to be Lord God you know how he trains you in the Physical Realm he trains You by all the people around you I just been telling to my apprentices lately they're like complaining about this Foreman or this project manager I said guys the entire battle here in your job is just pretty much personalities Works work but the hard balance is dealing with personalities and attitudes been done wrong here been done wrong here The Works work you can't complain about it is what it is you got to work hard it looks impossible yeah we're going to get done but when you know what they they don't complain about most of the time the work it's the personalities of the people wear them out the nagging the pinpointing the this the that the however and saints of God when these heathens rise up and start persecuting a saying things the things we got to go through we're almost home the Bible says to rejoice in your sufferings because what who suffered like Christ the Bible said he was marred be they marred his visual Beyond any other man he suffered like no other man whatever they did to him on that day was beyond what any human had ever suffered right literally beat him to one inch of his life and then hang hung him on a cross we don't even we couldn't imagine what he looked like his the the word body looked like he was destroyed much as the world churches or lodges have destroyed this word so the things we have to go through are light suffering rejoice in them because our savior our King our husband went before us and suffered Beyond we could even imagine remember those two thieves on the cross I don't recall any Scripture saying they got beaten or whipped or anything they were just taken and hung on a cross and they were worthy of it but here was their savior or one savior who took all the blunt of the hand of the wrath of God upon him and it's amazing God would choose the Roman entity to punish our Christ and here at the end God will take the Russian entity to punish Rome amen let's just love him if you have something on your heart he can he will hear you just tell him amen thank you for singing that song brother God bless you let's sing another one here man thank you Lord Jesus be glorified God done to deserve Glory re in thanks for [Music] that when I saw your
