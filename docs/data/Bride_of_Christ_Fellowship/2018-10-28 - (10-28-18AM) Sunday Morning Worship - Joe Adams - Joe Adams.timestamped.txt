[18:51] room there there's free food anyone who
[18:53] needs any food Stephanie the woman who
[18:55] cleans the church she had some extra
[18:57] food so if you know anybody who's in
[18:59] need of any food just take that to them
[19:01] take as much as you want or all of it
[19:04] if no one takes it I'll probably take it

[19:11] you can take it quicker go ahead and
[19:12] take it by God's grace also brother
[19:14] lorises items that he would like to have
[19:18] back there out there on the table so try
[19:20] to please leave those there it's that
[19:21] stand and the speakers and that cell
[19:25] phone stand if you'll just keep that
[19:27] there and whenever Karen comes next time

[48:58] perfect there means to be complete
[49:00] unimpaired
[49:01] excuse me sound and whole he maketh my

[49:39] verse 33 in Psalms 18 it says he maketh
[49:43] my feet like Hinds feet and he said it's
[49:47] me notice it's God that positions the
[49:51] believer and that word said it there
[49:54] means to stand erect upright or set its
[49:57] position so it's God that positions you
[49:59] upon your high places and he teaches
[50:03] David as saying he teaches my hands to
[50:06] war notice they were then learned his
[50:08] military tactics from some army or some
[50:11] Navy or some marine no he learned to
[50:13] fight because he learned to trust God in
[50:15] the same way that we his sons and
[50:17] daughters of God in this hour the way we
[50:19] learn to fight is the way we trust our
[50:22] God and God teaches our hands to war it
[50:26] many times we think it may be throwing a
[50:28] punch but war can be just like this he
[50:31] teaches our hands to fight he teaches
[50:33] our hands to war he teaches how to
[50:35] engage in conflict because realize you
[50:38] face the enemy each and every day of
[50:40] your life
[50:41] but the battle belongs to the Lord and
[50:44] it's not on want you to recognize church
[50:45] it's not a flesh and blood affair the
[50:50] battle that you face is a spiritual
[50:52] battle now the devil your enemy would
[50:55] love to get that spiritual battle into a
[50:58] natural are to a human battle to where
[51:00] you get into the flesh and once you get
[51:03] into the flesh you lose victory so
[51:06] recognize first and foremost the battle
[51:09] belongs to the Lord in us a spiritual
[51:12] battle but realize he sets us up in a
[51:16] position and if God set you in a
[51:19] position you can't fail as long as you
[51:21] remain in that position we look here in
[51:25] Psalms 18 and verse 47 he said it is God
[51:28] that avenges me and so do it the people
[51:31] under me he delivers me from my enemies
[51:35] yay they'll lift its me up above those
[51:38] that rise up against me thou hast
[51:40] delivered me from the violent man notice
[51:43] God's setting you up again it's God
[51:46] that's lifting you up is
[51:47] that's placing you it's god that's
[51:49] positioning you above those that rise up
[51:52] against you verse 49 therefore will I
[51:56] give thanks unto thee O Lord among the
[51:58] heathen I will sing praises unto thy
[52:00] name verse 50 great delivers giveth he
[52:03] to his King and he shows mercy to his
[52:05] anointed to David and to his seed for
[52:09] every morning how many year of the
[52:10] signal David a man verse Psalm 75 here
[52:15] verse 7 you're right - excuse me today
[52:19] I've been fighting a cold and coming on
[52:22] the end of it and so I was telling
[52:24] brother Jesse on the way here and always
[52:25] a text my throat so I'm by the grace of
[52:27] God we'd get through this service this
[52:29] morning
[52:29] Psalm 75 verse 7 says but God is the
[52:33] judge he put its one down and he set it
[52:36] up another so God pulls down one but he
[52:41] positions up another revelations three
[52:44] and verse 21 it says to him that
[52:45] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[52:48] in my throne even as I am overcame and
[52:52] sat down with the father in his throne
[52:54] so notice - how many of you an overcomer
[52:57] this morning so if you're an overcomer
[53:00] this morning God has they positioned for
[53:02] you he's not on a pure red chair this
[53:05] morning but God has a place on the
[53:07] throne he's got a position waiting for
[53:10] you that's an overcomer this morning but
[53:12] I want you to know the devil is acting
[53:14] your position is that all right this
[53:17] morning we find that in Isaiah 14 in
[53:20] verse 12 it says how their fallen from
[53:23] heaven Oh from heaven Oh Lucifer son of
[53:26] the morning how are their cut down to
[53:28] the ground which did weakens the
[53:29] nation's for thou is set in the heart
[53:31] notice how the enemies thought process
[53:33] is notice what he is saying I will
[53:36] ascend into heaven I will exalt my
[53:39] throne above the stars of God I will
[53:41] also set upon the Mount of the
[53:43] congregation in the sides of the north I
[53:45] want to send above the heights of the
[53:47] cloud and I will be like the Most High
[53:50] the devil is holding your position this
[53:54] morning because whose position is to be
[53:56] be seated in heavenly places that's your
[53:59] position he says our
[54:02] so my throne above the stars of God and
[54:04] yet we've already just read in
[54:05] revelation 3:21 that that place belongs
[54:08] to you to the overcomer this morning I
[54:10] will sit on the Mount of the
[54:12] congregation in the sides of the north I
[54:14] will ascend above the heights of the
[54:15] cloud and I will be like the Most High
[54:18] let me tell you Church there's only one
[54:20] this morning that can be like the Most
[54:22] High and that's the God of the most high
[54:24] that's the one that's been called by the
[54:26] Most High
[54:27] that's the one that's been anointed by
[54:28] the Most High that's the bride of Jesus
[54:30] Christ she is born of his book power of
[54:33] his power fresh of his flesh
[54:35] she is him and brought before him this
[54:37] morning and Pat your position but the
[54:41] devil wants your position but you got to
[54:45] fight for it
[54:46] we found in Matthew 11 and verse 12 says
[54:49] from the days of John the Baptist until
[54:51] now the Kingdom of Heaven suffers
[54:55] violence but the violent take it by
[54:57] force you know many times we think we
[55:00] got to be passive easygoing Christians
[55:02] and if we need to be passive easygoing
[55:05] Christians but when it comes to this
[55:07] word we got to be violent the Bible says
[55:12] from the days of John the Baptist until
[55:13] now this word that we serve this word
[55:16] that we live by it's under attack day in
[55:19] and day out but the violent take it by
[55:21] forth their word violent there means to
[55:23] be strong and powerful those that are
[55:26] passionate about the word those are not
[55:29] passionate about this message we don't
[55:31] just sit on the shelf know we're
[55:33] passionate about it and those that are
[55:35] voted for it they love it they had to
[55:37] hide it they tell you by force they
[55:39] grasp it with everything that's within
[55:41] us because it's right to the believer
[55:43] they take the word to the heart they
[55:46] take it to their bosom hey take it and a
[55:48] part in their home they put on the job
[55:50] it's the word that they live by we're
[55:54] not just passive Christians or anything
[55:56] don't come or go nowhere we're shards
[55:59] and we're daughters of God we're falling
[56:01] about the messes of the hour
[56:05] now they swear they were speaking on the
[56:07] staff in your position and the word
[56:09] defend their means to resist an attack
[56:12] made on something or someone it
[56:15] so means to protect from harm or danger
[56:19] so today you must resist the attack on
[56:22] your position and you must protect from
[56:27] harm and danger and the Bible tells us
[56:30] in Romans 8 verse 28 and we know the
[56:32] scripture very well but just allow me to
[56:35] build the black ground or build my
[56:36] platform this morning so we know that
[56:40] all things work together for the good to
[56:41] them that love God how many believe that
[56:43] whether it be good whether it be bad all
[56:45] things work together for the good at the
[56:47] end that that love God to them who are
[56:49] the called that word they're called
[56:52] means Divali selected the realize you've
[56:55] been divinely selected or not by
[56:59] happenstance but divinely selected and
[57:03] appointed according to his purpose for
[57:08] whom he did foreknow he also did
[57:10] predestinate now we realize that people
[57:13] don't like the word predestination but
[57:14] God liked it God used it right to him he
[57:19] called he also what he foreknew in those
[57:22] he foreknew he also predestined ate it
[57:25] therefore he predetermined your destiny
[57:28] before you was ever born before he was
[57:30] ever formed in the womb God
[57:32] predetermined you're in because he knew
[57:34] the choice that you would make he knew
[57:36] that you had a desire to serve Him and
[57:38] based on in desire he could choose you
[57:40] and he would choose you and it would
[57:42] predestinate you to an eternal in so to
[57:49] whom he did foreknow he also did
[57:50] predestinate to be conformed to the
[57:52] image of his son that he might be the
[57:54] firstborn among many brethren more whom
[57:58] he did predestinate them he also called
[58:01] and to whom he called them he also
[58:04] justified in the whom he justified them
[58:08] he also glorified now let me just read
[58:12] that in the amplified cuz I think it
[58:13] breaks it down a little bit more in our
[58:15] modern-day English is that okay we all
[58:18] english-speaking this morning I know I'm
[58:20] from the south and you're from Ohio and
[58:22] this is a North versus the South and the
[58:25] blue versus the gray but those are long
[58:27] gone right we're all one family this
[58:28] more
[58:29] right y'all got the win y'all won the
[58:32] battle but we're together today a mess
[58:36] good thing about being Christians
[58:37] there's no battlegrounds we're not no
[58:40] separation that last move Oh pick up
[58:41] here in verse 29 when we look at on the
[58:44] amplified let notice how it reads here
[58:45] says for those whom he foreknew or he
[58:49] had an awareness of any love beforehand
[58:51] he also destined from the beginning for
[58:55] ordaining them to be molded into the
[58:58] image of his son and they share inwardly
[59:01] his likeness that he might become the
[59:04] firstborn among many brethren now here's
[59:06] where I want to clue in on the verse 32
[59:08] those who he does for dane he also
[59:11] called so if god for danger god's gonna
[59:16] call you and those that he called he
[59:20] justified otherwise he acquitted he made
[59:23] you righteous putting them into a right
[59:26] standing with himself
[59:28] notice positioning them into a right
[59:32] standing within himself and those who
[59:34] mean justified he also glorified there
[59:38] means raising him up to a heavenly
[59:40] dignity or condition or a state of being
[59:44] see God called you because he called you
[59:47] he justified you he declared you
[59:50] righteous
[59:51] there's nothing against you this morning
[59:53] there's no sin on your life there's no
[59:55] history in your life God justified you
[59:58] it's a credit and he positions you in a
[1:00:01] right standing this morning and not only
[1:00:04] does he position in the right standing
[1:00:06] but he raised all hallelujah he raises
[1:00:09] you up to a heavenly dignity this
[1:00:11] morning oh you're not just human fresh
[1:00:15] but you're the bride of Jesus Christ he
[1:00:17] has elevated you to a hostage to your
[1:00:22] house this morning church not everybody
[1:00:24] can be bribed not everybody can feel
[1:00:30] this position but the elected in the
[1:00:33] call and the justifier and the glorified
[1:00:37] they will fit this image
[1:00:39] God is speaking of here we find here in
[1:00:44] Ephesians 1 the Bible speaks about being
[1:00:48] predestinated to the adoption of sons
[1:00:52] can we read that this morning the piece
[1:00:57] is one of verse 1 says Paul an apostle
[1:01:00] of Jesus Christ by the will of God to
[1:01:02] the Saints which are in Ephesus into the
[1:01:04] faith in Jesus Christ or Christ Jesus
[1:01:06] grace be unto you and peace from God our
[1:01:09] Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:01:11] blessed be the God and father of our
[1:01:14] Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[1:01:17] with all spiritual blessings notice this
[1:01:22] morning you've been blessed with all
[1:01:24] spiritual blessings come on Church all
[1:01:29] spiritual blessings you have been
[1:01:32] blessed with all spiritual blessings in
[1:01:35] heavenly places in Christ according as
[1:01:40] he has chosen us in him before the
[1:01:42] foundation of the world that we should
[1:01:44] be holy without blame that word is
[1:01:46] faultless unblameable without spot
[1:01:48] before him in love having predestinated
[1:01:50] us to the adoption of children by Jesus
[1:01:54] Christ himself so he looked back in
[1:01:57] verse 3 and the Bible would tell us
[1:01:58] blessed be the God and father of our
[1:02:00] Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[1:02:02] with all spiritual busts in heavenly
[1:02:04] places now what does this word heavenly
[1:02:06] places believe the probably God will
[1:02:09] bring him down in the message Christ as
[1:02:10] a mystery of God revealed he says how
[1:02:12] many places just for a moment is the
[1:02:14] believers position in Christ I'm in your
[1:02:18] believer this morning then you've
[1:02:21] already been seated in heavenly places
[1:02:22] you've been predestinated into heavenly
[1:02:26] places
[1:02:26] that's the believers position in Christ
[1:02:29] where the believer stands in Christ is
[1:02:32] in heavenly places
[1:02:33] when did he choose you Church when you
[1:02:36] were born only on an altar note before
[1:02:39] the foundation of the world before you
[1:02:42] ever made one
[1:02:43] mistake before you ever coming in the
[1:02:45] first act of seeing God already cold you
[1:02:47] not only chose you ain't got only place
[1:02:50] you there in heavenly places he says see
[1:02:55] the great mystery he chose us in Christ
[1:02:57] before the foundation the world that we
[1:03:00] should be holy that we would be without
[1:03:03] blame don't you love that when you look
[1:03:05] in the mirror you see your faults you
[1:03:08] see your mistakes you see your
[1:03:10] shortcomings but when God looks upon you
[1:03:12] he sees you faultless he sees you
[1:03:14] blameless he sees you holy he sees you
[1:03:18] the way that he sees you so the word
[1:03:22] here means adoption the word means that
[1:03:25] it's the placing or the positioning of a
[1:03:28] son now when we think of adoption we're
[1:03:30] thinking going to an orphanage or to a
[1:03:32] hospital and we take somebody's baby
[1:03:35] that wasn't born in our family and we
[1:03:37] take that then we adopt it and we bring
[1:03:39] it into our family but that's not what
[1:03:42] the adoption is in the oriental custom
[1:03:44] the oriental custom was that this son
[1:03:46] was born into the family he was always a
[1:03:49] son he was born a son but he was not yet
[1:03:53] adopted in this this son will go through
[1:03:56] the act of being a tutor and in being
[1:03:58] trained and he would go through that to
[1:04:00] make sure he was in the right standing
[1:04:02] and if he passed all the course or he
[1:04:04] was found right in the father's eyes
[1:04:06] then he was place or he was an adopted
[1:04:09] son that means that he was placed into a
[1:04:12] position of authority and power that
[1:04:15] means that his name on the checkbook was
[1:04:18] just as good of the father's name that
[1:04:20] means he can run the affairs of the
[1:04:22] business the same way the father can run
[1:04:24] the affairs of the I'm going to tell you
[1:04:26] this morning Church you have been
[1:04:27] predestinated I said you have been
[1:04:30] predestination that sonship this morning
[1:04:33] you were born into the family but yeah
[1:04:35] your place into the family you are a
[1:04:38] position this morning of authority and
[1:04:41] power he predestinated there's the
[1:04:47] mystery he this okay this morning
[1:04:53] he before Christ or anything else was
[1:04:56] only earth
[1:04:57] you see his great mystery that he would
[1:04:59] choose the bride
[1:05:00] knowing Eve would fall from disbelief in
[1:05:03] the word knowing that she would fall but
[1:05:05] he would choose a bride that would not
[1:05:08] fall that would hold to the word
[1:05:11] regardless of what the rest of the world
[1:05:12] had to say about it they would hold to
[1:05:15] the word they are predestinated to stand
[1:05:18] there the adoption of children by Jesus
[1:05:20] Christ so each of you this morning
[1:05:23] how many of you are here this morning we
[1:05:28] got some of you they don't know if
[1:05:29] you're here right we are in the north
[1:05:32] it's cold everybody's mind head and
[1:05:34] defrosted yet happy
[1:05:36] we're not that cold yet he said coming
[1:05:40] in in the wintertime it'll be four or
[1:05:42] five months of snow around here I'd have
[1:05:44] no desire to come you know it's barely
[1:05:49] breaking 50 back home but each of us
[1:05:52] this morning have a predetermined
[1:05:54] position in the body God predetermined
[1:06:00] you for a specific age for a specific
[1:06:03] task for a specific place and for a
[1:06:07] specific purpose you don't really
[1:06:10] realize this morning you couldn't come
[1:06:11] in a prior age you look back and you
[1:06:15] think oh how glorious Martin's day was
[1:06:17] when he protested a Catholic Church
[1:06:18] would have been great to come in that
[1:06:20] date you couldn't already been great in
[1:06:23] Wesley's day when he was when he laid
[1:06:25] hands on his horse and it came back up
[1:06:26] and he was able to ride it on and you
[1:06:28] know and he carried the message of
[1:06:29] sanctification throughout the world
[1:06:31] he'd been great they've been a part of
[1:06:32] that day but you couldn't you know even
[1:06:34] in Azusa Street when their gifts begin
[1:06:36] to reveal restored to the people and to
[1:06:38] the end to the body of Christ and we
[1:06:40] find that you know their tongues and
[1:06:42] different things of that nature the
[1:06:43] spiritual gifts come back and yet you
[1:06:45] couldn't even have been found in that
[1:06:46] day God predetermined you don't live in
[1:06:49] this day this is the age Barbara don't
[1:06:52] want to god choose me for this day
[1:06:54] because he chose the strongest he chose
[1:06:57] the bravest he chose the mightiest
[1:06:59] warriors
[1:07:00] live out in his dark and evil a he chose
[1:07:02] those that were burned a lot of the word
[1:07:06] you can come in another age you came in
[1:07:09] this age because God had predetermined
[1:07:10] you to live in this hour somebody is
[1:07:14] going to defend the position or be in
[1:07:17] that word Bob ride somebody's going to
[1:07:19] live out the testimony but no matter
[1:07:21] what they do to it we refuse to bow we
[1:07:24] refuse to be it we refuse to give up we
[1:07:27] refuse to run away now we're sons and
[1:07:29] daughters of God God had chose you for
[1:07:34] this battle but you got to defend your
[1:07:38] position oh so now one of the most
[1:07:43] important wants to know the most
[1:07:45] important thing you can recognize I'm
[1:07:47] glad some of you're with me this morning
[1:07:48] hope the rest of you catch up one of the
[1:07:52] most important things that you can ever
[1:07:53] recognize in the battle that we're in is
[1:07:56] to recognize your position the part that
[1:08:00] you play the position that you hold see
[1:08:05] you can't afford to assume the position
[1:08:07] that doesn't belong to you I gave an
[1:08:10] example before as I appreciate said
[1:08:13] another church in San Diego you take a
[1:08:15] man who's a maybe he's just a enlistee
[1:08:18] in the Marines there's no formal
[1:08:21] training to be a general or a corporal
[1:08:23] or any of that nature and yet he tries
[1:08:25] to overtake the command post he doesn't
[1:08:28] know the military tactics he's young
[1:08:31] he's green he's just a GI you know knee
[1:08:33] and they are Corp are private is that's
[1:08:35] what the word they used and realized
[1:08:37] that if he was to take the leadership of
[1:08:39] the troops that he would get them in
[1:08:41] danger see you can't you suffer
[1:08:44] Authority that doesn't belong to your
[1:08:46] position that doesn't belong to you not
[1:08:48] everybody can be brother Jesse in the
[1:08:50] pastor of the church but see God has
[1:08:53] called us to a position and we must
[1:08:55] remain in the position that God has
[1:08:57] placed us in you said brother Joe you
[1:09:00] know I want to be a song leader or I
[1:09:02] don't know you'd ever want to be a song
[1:09:04] leader I want to be a preacher I don't
[1:09:06] know why you'd ever want to be a
[1:09:07] preacher so I just said right backers
[1:09:08] like God why am I even here because we
[1:09:10] feel so little we feel like we're not
[1:09:12] even able
[1:09:13] you know we think about how little we
[1:09:15] are but yet God begins to lift you up
[1:09:17] and God begins to bring an anointing
[1:09:19] down so we can't afford to assume a
[1:09:21] position that doesn't belong to us you
[1:09:23] may never a preach a sermon how many you
[1:09:25] may never preach a sermon that many of
[1:09:27] you especially ladies
[1:09:28] but yeah you have a position in the body
[1:09:30] you may never sing a special but yet you
[1:09:33] have a position in the body you may
[1:09:35] never play one of these systems but yet
[1:09:38] you have a position in the body you may
[1:09:41] never be the sole leader you may never
[1:09:43] be a deacon you never married see by the
[1:09:45] message but yet God has called you in
[1:09:48] this hour for a position so no matter
[1:09:52] who you are what you are you have been
[1:09:54] caught and you've got to stay faithful
[1:09:55] to that calling you say well I don't
[1:10:01] sing you know how we get in the flesh we
[1:10:04] get down I don't ever gift I don't have
[1:10:06] you got a gift to being part of this a
[1:10:11] lake lady and I'm talking about this
[1:10:12] morning is the gift because not
[1:10:14] everybody possesses that gift we think
[1:10:18] well we're not important to the body you
[1:10:19] are just important to the body of Christ
[1:10:21] his brother branham himself you're just
[1:10:24] important to the body of Christ is
[1:10:26] Martin Luther as Wesley is Columba many
[1:10:28] of those mean any Christian you put any
[1:10:30] famous Christian there from the days go
[1:10:33] by
[1:10:33] you're just important today here in
[1:10:35] Akron Ohio is any of those other former
[1:10:37] believers that we've ever had come down
[1:10:39] through time because God has placed you
[1:10:42] here don't belittle where God has placed
[1:10:44] you don't belittle position got to put
[1:10:46] you in God place you there because he
[1:10:49] knows if you're in that position that he
[1:10:51] can get greater use out of your life how
[1:10:56] many of you know the story of EF Hutton
[1:10:57] how many of y'all know who Hutton is
[1:11:00] several of he's a great financial mind
[1:11:02] back in the day is going by
[1:11:03] we have Hutton meaning you may not know
[1:11:05] but he wanted to be a missionary he had
[1:11:09] his heart desire to go out and being a
[1:11:11] missionary in a missionary field but yet
[1:11:13] he had a very bright mind and you know
[1:11:15] he went ahead and went to school and and
[1:11:18] he prayed the whole time he wanted to be
[1:11:19] a missionary one to be a missionary and
[1:11:21] he realized at some point in his
[1:11:23] schooling the God came down and spoke to
[1:11:25] him and he said look
[1:11:27] because I can do more for you here in
[1:11:29] this position than I can with you out
[1:11:32] there in that position and he was one of
[1:11:34] the greatest financial minds that this
[1:11:37] nation has ever seen
[1:11:38] because Walker's God put him in a place
[1:11:40] that he can use him and further the
[1:11:43] gospel and I'm going to tell you this
[1:11:44] morning you may never crease the word
[1:11:46] but God's place you in a position that
[1:11:48] you can further the gospel get behind
[1:11:51] the word and push the gospel forth
[1:11:53] church so you're just as important to
[1:11:57] the body is any of us other brothers
[1:12:00] that preach or anybody else that has a
[1:12:01] gift you're just as important to the
[1:12:03] body but the enemy is going to do
[1:12:05] everything he can to keep you from
[1:12:07] realizing who you are and keep you from
[1:12:10] realizing the power that God is giving
[1:12:12] you and keep you from realizing the
[1:12:13] authority that God has bestowed upon you
[1:12:15] and if he can keep you from realizing
[1:12:17] that then he can keep you defeated broke
[1:12:22] man will tell us in the message
[1:12:23] revelation of Jesus Christ the church
[1:12:24] age book he says now Christ in the true
[1:12:27] church is a continuation of the book of
[1:12:29] Acts excuse me and exposes Satan
[1:12:33] revealing his works as a tip to
[1:12:35] destruction of God's people and to
[1:12:37] discrediting of God's Word right now to
[1:12:39] the time that he has cast into the lake
[1:12:41] of fire
[1:12:41] he fights that he cannot stand it he
[1:12:44] knows referring to Satan though he knows
[1:12:46] that if the people get a true revelation
[1:12:49] or the true church and what she is and
[1:12:52] what she stands for and that she can do
[1:12:55] the greater works she will be an
[1:12:58] invincible army oh do you recognise did
[1:13:02] you just hear what he said about you
[1:13:03] this morning if you can recognize who
[1:13:06] you are and by God's Spirit is our and
[1:13:08] we stand by the Antichrist spirit Satan
[1:13:11] would be definitely thought it today as
[1:13:14] if he was in that day church I'm telling
[1:13:16] you this morning you have a power that's
[1:13:19] not even been tapped into yet that you
[1:13:21] don't recognize who you are this morning
[1:13:22] and when you recognize that I am that
[1:13:25] broad I am that spiritual union with
[1:13:27] Christ I am that invincible or me I'm
[1:13:29] too powerful to be defeated I'm too
[1:13:32] powerful to be stopped ain't no Gabriel
[1:13:35] is standing here before me
[1:13:38] I'm not saying this about myself I'm
[1:13:41] saying what the world says about you
[1:13:43] know what is the COG declared Univ it's
[1:13:47] a whole army but you gotta recognize
[1:13:49] your place well brother Joe I don't feel
[1:13:53] like I don't feel like this invisible
[1:13:55] army well duh of course you don't
[1:13:59] because you're you're wrapped up in this
[1:14:01] thing called humanity but we're not
[1:14:04] going based on what this human manatee
[1:14:06] says or the flesh dish to us I'm reading
[1:14:10] what the word says about you she will be
[1:14:13] an invincible army too powerful to be
[1:14:18] defeated overcome that's who you are
[1:14:21] that's the position you put you have and
[1:14:25] when you ever catch this revelation of
[1:14:27] who you are that you are this in fact is
[1:14:29] invisible army then there's no gates of
[1:14:32] hell that can stand before you the gates
[1:14:35] of Hell will not shine I cannot prevail
[1:14:38] over here when you catch the revelation
[1:14:40] of who you actually are you believe that
[1:14:44] this morning see men cannot order
[1:14:52] yourself to a place see it's God that
[1:14:55] orders your place don't forget that God
[1:14:58] orders your place and we must never try
[1:15:00] to take somebody else's place don't try
[1:15:03] to be something that you're not and we
[1:15:06] find a lot of the issues in churches
[1:15:07] today and the issues of church splits is
[1:15:10] because me and take positions thirds are
[1:15:12] not called to take we find now we a lot
[1:15:18] of times that we in our own humanity try
[1:15:20] to question God and we try to you know
[1:15:24] come to terms want to God do this or
[1:15:26] want to God do that it's not our place
[1:15:27] to question the mind of God it's not our
[1:15:30] position to wonder God why'd you put
[1:15:33] this man here why did that man make that
[1:15:35] decision that's between him and God the
[1:15:37] word position here just so we can get a
[1:15:40] clarity means a place where someone or
[1:15:43] something is located or has been put so
[1:15:47] I've been speaking to you on defend your
[1:15:49] position where
[1:15:50] had put you and he's put you in a
[1:15:53] position called the bride of Jesus
[1:15:55] Christ do you believe that this morning
[1:15:58] so each of us here have a predestinated
[1:16:02] position as part of that a leg body but
[1:16:05] you realize in the Bible Jesus gave His
[1:16:07] disciples power right they could cast
[1:16:11] out the devil they can do this and they
[1:16:13] had the word and the Word was made flesh
[1:16:15] with them
[1:16:16] and he told him I give you power and he
[1:16:18] gave them the power but what they lack
[1:16:19] they lack the Fate to operate the power
[1:16:22] of the word but see Jesus realized who
[1:16:26] he was he realized that he was the word
[1:16:28] and he had faith in what the word
[1:16:30] declared him to be so he realized what
[1:16:33] he was he realized that knowing that he
[1:16:34] was a work and he had faith in God who
[1:16:36] made him the word and he was the word of
[1:16:39] God and that was in him and I give him
[1:16:41] faith because what he understood his
[1:16:44] position and if he understood his
[1:16:46] position because he looked back at what
[1:16:49] the word said about him now what about
[1:16:51] you and I'll this morning can we look
[1:16:53] back to what the word declares about us
[1:16:55] this morning as believers as sons and
[1:16:58] daughters of God as the predestinated of
[1:17:01] the Lord Jesus Christ so if he relies
[1:17:04] upon what God made him then why can't we
[1:17:07] rely upon what God has made us these
[1:17:10] signs shall follow them that believe see
[1:17:15] he has faith in what he was and if you
[1:17:18] are a believer how many of your believer
[1:17:19] this morning they can't we have faith in
[1:17:21] what he's declared us to be a believer
[1:17:25] see you got to recognize your position
[1:17:28] and if you abide in me and my word and
[1:17:30] you then asks what you will come on
[1:17:33] Church recognize your position in the
[1:17:35] scripture as a believer you've got to
[1:17:37] recognize your position as he recognized
[1:17:40] his position and he could curse that
[1:17:42] tree and say no fruit will bear from you
[1:17:45] anymore
[1:17:45] no because just what's over us this
[1:17:47] morning in the father's name he said
[1:17:50] he'll give it to you whatsoever you ask
[1:17:53] don't just limit God's power just
[1:17:55] something small know whatever you have
[1:17:57] need of this morning God is here God is
[1:18:00] able God is willing
[1:18:01] whatever you asked this morning but you
[1:18:04] got to recognize your position that
[1:18:06] you've been placed there to ask God for
[1:18:08] whatever your need is and when you fully
[1:18:14] understand your position as a son and
[1:18:17] daughter of God then you will refuse to
[1:18:20] be taken advantage of
[1:18:22] you were refused to live below your
[1:18:25] god-given privileges you will stand up
[1:18:28] in the face of your adversary and say
[1:18:30] not today
[1:18:31] I'm not listening to your lies anymore
[1:18:33] I'm not taking your sickness anymore I'm
[1:18:36] not bowing down to you anymore I'm gonna
[1:18:39] be like Shadrach Meshach and Abednego if
[1:18:41] we got to go to the fire we're going to
[1:18:43] the fire because we're not bowing we
[1:18:45] refuse to bow we refuse to be in we
[1:18:47] refuse to give up we refuse to run we're
[1:18:50] sons and daughters of the Living God

[1:19:49] is the same yesterday today and tomorrow
[1:19:53] if he healed the suggestion a he can
[1:19:56] heal the sick today if he raised the
[1:19:59] dead yesterday he can raise the dead

[1:21:12] power the same side the same one the
[1:21:15] same anointing he's the same God he just
[1:21:18] changed his role and he's either this
[1:21:20] morning and you and how's this one his
[1:21:22] sons and daughters of God you say what
[1:21:27] brother Joe I need a scripture for that

[1:21:35] been hidden from generations notice it's
[1:21:39] been a mystery for ages and from
[1:21:43] generations but now is made manifest to
[1:21:46] his Saints to whom God will make known
[1:21:50] what is the riches of his glory of this
[1:21:53] mystery among the gentiles which is
[1:21:55] christ in you there it is Christ in you
[1:22:01] is the hope of glory

[1:22:44] but it's just in a different body no
[1:22:48] longer he's in a one-man ministry now
[1:22:49] he's in a multi-member body called the
[1:22:51] bride of Jesus Christ in the message the
[1:22:54] deity of Jesus Christ the property God
[1:22:55] would say this he says now let the
[1:22:59] fundamentalist let them people who deny
[1:23:01] the power God say it's Rome but the same

[1:28:21] saying I just want to read this as as it
[1:28:23] were as it involves our concerns to
[1:28:25] church he says one night I was seeking
[1:28:28] the Lord and the Holy Spirit told me to
[1:28:31] pick up my pen and write and I grasped
[1:28:34] my pen to write and his spirit gave me a
[1:28:36] message for the church and I want to
[1:28:39] bring it to you it has to do with the
[1:28:40] word and the bride how many of your
[1:28:44] bride this morning
[1:28:45] all right says in the last days the true
[1:28:52] bride church Christ seed will come to
[1:28:56] the headstone she will be the super
[1:28:59] Church a super race as she nears him day
[1:29:05] and abroad will be so much like him that
[1:29:08] they will even be in his very image this
[1:29:11] is in order to be united with him they
[1:29:13] will be one they will be the very
[1:29:15] manifestation of the word of the Living
[1:29:18] God from a little group a true seed of
[1:29:21] the word God will present Christ with
[1:29:24] the beloved bride she is a virgin of his
[1:29:26] word she was a virgin because she knows
[1:29:28] no man's trees or dogmas but by and
[1:29:31] through the members of the bride will be
[1:29:33] fulfilled all that was promised of God
[1:29:36] to be manifest in a virgin the members
[1:29:40] of this virgin bride a virgin bride will
[1:29:43] love him they will have his potentials
[1:29:46] oh quit looking at your face and look at
[1:29:50] your potentials this morning for he is
[1:29:54] their head all power belongs to him they
[1:29:58] are subject to him as the members of our
[1:30:01] bodies are subject to our heads he shows
[1:30:03] her now listen he shows her his word of
[1:30:07] life she receives it she never doubts it
[1:30:10] therefore nothing can harm her not even
[1:30:14] death for it to see be planet and the
[1:30:17] water will raise it up again here's a
[1:30:19] secret of it the Lord is in the bride as
[1:30:22] it was in Mary and the bride has the
[1:30:25] mind of Christ for she knows what he was
[1:30:27] done with the word she performs the
[1:30:30] command of the word in his name for she
[1:30:33] has thus sayeth the Lord
[1:30:38] notice what you have in your position or
[1:30:41] as your position you have this saith the
[1:30:45] Lord and when thus sayeth the Lord is
[1:30:48] spoken it will never return void but it
[1:30:52] will accomplish that which its purpose
[1:30:56] he said those in the broad will do only
[1:30:59] his will no one can make them do
[1:31:03] otherwise they had thus said the Lord
[1:31:06] all they keep still they know that it
[1:31:09] has to be God in them doing the works
[1:31:11] fulfilling his own word that he did not
[1:31:13] complete all his work while he was here
[1:31:14] in his earthly ministry so now he works
[1:31:17] in and through the bride she knows that
[1:31:20] her it was not yet time for him to do a
[1:31:22] certain thing but he must do now but now
[1:31:25] listen now but he will now fulfill
[1:31:27] through the bride that work which he
[1:31:30] left for a specific time so God is here
[1:31:35] in this age for a specific reason to a
[1:31:38] specific person or people I brought for
[1:31:42] a specific time to finish the work that
[1:31:45] he didn't complete back in the days gone
[1:31:46] by so God has a plan for our lives and
[1:31:52] God expects us to yield our lives to him
[1:31:56] to where we surrender our wheels to the
[1:31:58] will of the Father is that okay this
[1:32:02] morning but brother branham was saying
[1:32:04] like this one of the greatest curses of
[1:32:06] all the Full Gospel Church is not
[1:32:09] positionally knowing what they are in
[1:32:11] Christ so the greatest curse that we can
[1:32:14] have Church is not recognized in who we
[1:32:17] are not recognizing the position that we
[1:32:20] hold just alright he says now the devil
[1:32:24] is just trying to scare you out of
[1:32:26] something he's trying to push something
[1:32:27] somewhere else
[1:32:28] some of these days gone by listen what
[1:32:31] he says here he says you are now I want
[1:32:36] y'all catch this how many times he says
[1:32:38] the word now you are now now we're sons
[1:32:42] of God now we're seated together in
[1:32:45] heavenly places now we have all powers
[1:32:48] in heaven and earth
[1:32:49] we have it not in the Millennium we
[1:32:52] won't need it then we got it now right
[1:32:55] now we're sons and daughters of God
[1:32:58] Church quit looking at your failures
[1:33:00] good looking at your mistakes and look
[1:33:03] to what the word says right now I wish I
[1:33:06] had the voice to preach near your sons
[1:33:08] and daughters of God he says what you're
[1:33:13] here is a reflection of what you are
[1:33:15] somewhere else
[1:33:16] Oh church you're only doing here what
[1:33:18] he's already seen you doing there
[1:33:19] whatever you do when the sons are gone
[1:33:22] when the sons of God the stars shine a
[1:33:25] tweet oh that was you sobbing that was
[1:33:28] you worship it that was just praising
[1:33:30] God hallelujah well I wish I had more
[1:33:36] voice whoo this is what you are here is
[1:33:40] a reflection of what your somewhere else
[1:33:42] those that he called he just to find
[1:33:44] those that he just about he's already
[1:33:46] glorified excuse me already in the
[1:33:49] presence of the Father we have a gorfod
[1:33:52] body a body that's never seen it I
[1:33:55] bought it it don't get old I bought it
[1:33:57] don't get aches and pains about it it
[1:34:00] don't lose eyesight about it don't get
[1:34:02] stumped over no Church what we are here
[1:34:04] is what we are somewhere else I should
[1:34:06] give you enough reason this moment to
[1:34:08] rejoice at this saying everything is all
[1:34:10] cracked up to be
[1:34:11] this is not to eternal home church God's
[1:34:14] got something greater he says not go
[1:34:16] prepare a place for you I'll come again
[1:34:18] and receive you to myself it wasn't so
[1:34:21] hallelujah Church they say your final
[1:34:23] resting place but is that somewhere
[1:34:25] greater for you as the bride if this
[1:34:30] loosely Tabernacle be dissolved we have
[1:34:33] one already waiting we have another home
[1:34:37] a future home already waiting already
[1:34:39] prepared and for Joe Adams is about that
[1:34:42] tall maybe a few little pounds lighter I
[1:34:46] hope at least oh we got another home
[1:34:50] already there so what does it matter
[1:34:54] we have a position and there ain't
[1:34:58] enough Devils inhale can keep you from
[1:35:00] becoming what God's ordained you to
[1:35:02] become see the Bible says the beloved

[1:35:09] first John 3 and verse 2 beloved now we
[1:35:11] are the sons of God and they're doing

[1:35:22] him as he is notice I didn't make myself
[1:35:26] a son you didn't make yourself a son or
[1:35:29] a preacher didn't make you a son God

[1:38:35] to rule your enemy I said he made you to
[1:38:40] rule your enemy when that evening comes

[1:39:04] called and David was anointed and David
[1:39:07] was place when David went to face his
[1:39:09] Goliath he wasn't shaking in his boots
[1:39:11] Church some 14 15 year-old kid
[1:39:15] he knew his God he knew that he didn't
[1:39:18] called himself God called him from
[1:39:20] hurting
[1:39:21] and not only did he call him he elected
[1:39:24] him and then he anointed him what they
[1:39:25] are the oil what did he place David in a
[1:39:29] position to be the king Dave Ben knew
[1:39:34] that he was an honorable prophetic
[1:39:36] message to be the next king so it didn't
[1:39:41] matter what he faced he didn't matter
[1:39:43] how big the jaws were they've been knew
[1:39:46] he's going to get been seen in a promise
[1:39:48] he was the next king he was the next
[1:39:51] king I'll let me tell you Church this
[1:39:52] money you have been anointed by
[1:39:54] authentic message there'll be water king
[1:39:57] and a priest and it doesn't matter what
[1:40:00] W faces money ain't no devil stop you
[1:40:03] this morning why should we fear Church
[1:40:07] why should we fret God's Word is true
[1:40:12] you have been a made of King you have
[1:40:15] been positionally placed here to rule
[1:40:18] over your enemy he says now in the
[1:40:23] presence of the Almighty your name right
[1:40:27] now is in doubly indelible excuse-me
[1:40:31] wrote with the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:40:33] glorified in his presence indelibly
[1:40:37] can't be removed your name is already
[1:40:40] written there positionally placed here
[1:40:45] on earth for a purpose to do the will of
[1:40:47] God he says see your position Christian
[1:40:50] to do the will of God not only are you
[1:40:55] here as a king and a priest but you're
[1:40:57] also here as an ambassador you know what
[1:41:00] an ambassador is it's a representative
[1:41:01] and I love what the Bible says in
[1:41:03] Matthew 18 and verse 18 enough I wonder
[1:41:05] so many times if we don't we don't catch
[1:41:07] the grass or the hold of this he said
[1:41:09] verily I say to you whatsoever you shall
[1:41:11] bind on earth shall be bound in heaven
[1:41:14] ho Church why are we living below our
[1:41:17] god-given privileges whatsoever you bind
[1:41:19] on earth shall be bound in heaven and
[1:41:21] we're serving you shall loose on earth
[1:41:22] shall be loosed in heaven
[1:41:24] he says all powers of heaven is giving
[1:41:27] it to my head go and I will be with you
[1:41:29] whatsoever you borrow Oh
[1:41:31] in heaven and whatever you loose on
[1:41:33] earth I loose it in heaven Church that's
[1:41:36] the words that we have to live by this
[1:41:38] morning he goes or if the great holy
[1:41:42] church only realizes power to do these
[1:41:44] things but there's so much doubt there's
[1:41:46] so much fear and trembling wondering if
[1:41:48] it will if it could happen as long as
[1:41:50] that exists a church to never stand
[1:41:52] upright when every talk of fears
[1:41:54] vanished and the Holy Spirit is
[1:41:55] completely in control well the church
[1:41:57] and all fears are going and that church
[1:41:59] has no power and they have everything
[1:42:01] that heaven owns is behind back people
[1:42:04] Church 10 fasteners to the throne
[1:42:08] absolutely an ambassador of Christ has
[1:42:11] the authority has everything that Christ
[1:42:13] owes Bulow's to that ambassador and he
[1:42:18] would say like this if united states of
[1:42:19] this fair land here sent me over to
[1:42:21] Russia to be an ambassador to the nation
[1:42:24] of Russia then if they have officially
[1:42:26] sent me to Russia in all the power that
[1:42:28] United States has is behind me so if I
[1:42:32] was an ambassador of Russia and anything
[1:42:34] I said all the power of the United
[1:42:36] States would have to back up my word
[1:42:38] brother Jesse well and if God had made
[1:42:41] you an ambassador of his goodwill of
[1:42:43] that Kingdom and whatsoever you say
[1:42:45] alright heaven all the angels our
[1:42:48] Guardian is behind you this but does you
[1:42:52] recognize I am the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:42:59] this is all the power that's in heaven
[1:43:01] all that God is all the angels all power
[1:43:04] says behind our words if we are
[1:43:06] correctly and ordained sent messengers
[1:43:08] to the people God has to honor the word
[1:43:12] for he has solemnly written whatsoever
[1:43:15] you bind on earth I will bind it in
[1:43:18] heaven and whatever you loose on earth
[1:43:20] I'm gonna loose it in heaven just check
[1:43:27] it how long I've gone so you have a
[1:43:30] position see you might you might be
[1:43:34] called to be a housewife which you got a
[1:43:37] position in Jesus Christ by the Holy
[1:43:39] Ghost the brother Brennan would say like
[1:43:42] this he's at the Ministry of the bride
[1:43:43] and the Ministry of the cry of cry
[1:43:45] is the same ministry so don't think you
[1:43:48] don't have a ministry you may never
[1:43:50] preach but you got a ministry because
[1:43:51] you got a position and God placed you
[1:43:53] there he says now the Ministry of Christ
[1:43:57] will be in the church that's exactly
[1:43:59] like him in the spirit when he comes to
[1:44:02] take the church to redeem the whole
[1:44:03] thing it goes up see in the beginning of
[1:44:06] the groom the bride has to come forth
[1:44:07] because it's part of him it can only be
[1:44:09] the manifestation of the fulfilling of
[1:44:11] the revelations many others have spoke
[1:44:13] over the bride see it can only manifest
[1:44:16] if it does something different from the
[1:44:18] groom than it isn't the bride because
[1:44:20] she is flesh of his flesh bone of his
[1:44:23] bone life of his life power of his power
[1:44:26] she is him

[1:46:42] at what we need tonight is men and women
[1:46:44] who knows their position in Jesus Christ
[1:46:47] that's what we need today Church it's
[1:46:49] men and women sons and daughters to

[1:47:06] powers nor things present nor things to
[1:47:08] come nor height nor death nor any other
[1:47:10] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:47:12] from the love of God which is in Christ
[1:47:14] Jesus our Lord said well Joe how can you
[1:47:17] be so persuaded because the words
[1:47:18] already declared I see myself in the
[1:47:23] word I know what I used to be I know
[1:47:26] what I used to do but I know what the
[1:47:28] word has made me I see my position that
[1:47:31] is a preacher but as a son of God he
[1:47:38] Joseph let me just get to help me start
[1:47:42] bringing this reppin this down to a
[1:47:43] close I've been riding in an hour
[1:47:44] he said he chose a bride knowing that
[1:47:48] Eve would fall but he would choose a
[1:47:51] bride that would not fall
[1:47:54] they are predestinated predetermined God
[1:47:58] knew the choices that you would make
[1:48:00] before you ever came into existence he
[1:48:02] knew that you would have a desire to
[1:48:04] serve Him and based on that desire that
[1:48:06] you had God predetermined your future
[1:48:09] and he predestinated you to stand there
[1:48:11] the adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[1:48:14] to church for that great and glorious
[1:48:17] stand but see Satan wants your position
[1:48:23] but I like what he says in Isaiah 14 or
[1:48:26] Isaiah 14 verse 15 see Satan's all too
[1:48:30] clear and I'm gonna send into heaven I'm
[1:48:31] gonna be exalt my my congregation into
[1:48:33] the size of North I'm gonna be above the
[1:48:35] clock the heights of the cloud I'm gonna
[1:48:37] be like the Most High yet in verse 15 he
[1:48:39] says yet thou shalt be brought down to
[1:48:42] hell
[1:48:43] he can't have your position I said he
[1:48:48] can't have your position nobody can take
[1:48:51] your place Church God's got a purpose
[1:48:53] for you God got a position for you
[1:48:55] recognize who you all recognize the
[1:48:57] position that you hold as I ended on
[1:49:03] this story here we're all familiar with
[1:49:08] the Civil War correct y'all one oh we
[1:49:12] already declared that it's okay but in
[1:49:15] July 2nd 1863 on the border strip the
[1:49:20] other side of a southern Pennsylvania
[1:49:21] town called Gettysburg there was a
[1:49:23] battle that was about to take place in
[1:49:25] the Union Army was north to south lined
[1:49:30] up and there was two great big heels
[1:49:32] that they call big Round Top and Little
[1:49:35] Round Top whoever in Little Round Top
[1:49:39] was a further estanque or the very left
[1:49:42] the very extreme south side of this
[1:49:44] whoever controlled Little Round Top will
[1:49:47] control the countryside to the far west
[1:49:49] for miles and miles and mile and so as a
[1:49:52] inverse or converged on to Gettysburg
[1:49:55] here the Union Army realized that they
[1:49:58] didn't occupy Little Round Top so on
[1:50:01] July the second they begin to make a
[1:50:02] mass move to get people over there to
[1:50:04] get forces over their equipment and they
[1:50:08] they begin train and you had to 44th New
[1:50:11] York
[1:50:12] then you had to 83rd Pennsylvania and
[1:50:14] then you had to 20th Maine they were
[1:50:17] lined up from the very west of the very
[1:50:19] south or very left flank and the 20th
[1:50:23] Maine was led by a man by it was named
[1:50:26] as Joshua Chamberlain and he was just a
[1:50:29] misfit of me and 386 men and some of
[1:50:32] them committed mutiny and they should
[1:50:34] have been killed because they diverted
[1:50:35] or deserted their their previous posts
[1:50:38] and yet they they just kind of put this
[1:50:40] little group together at the last minute
[1:50:42] you know kind of much like God's done
[1:50:43] today just put this little group
[1:50:45] together at the last minute but yet you
[1:50:47] find these 386 men they were given
[1:50:49] strict orders on that day you defend
[1:50:52] this Hill at all cost if it cost you
[1:50:57] your life you don't retreat if it cost
[1:50:59] you your life you can't give up no
[1:51:02] matter what if this if this is Freight
[1:51:04] then the whole Union Army will be
[1:51:06] defeated and will lose the battle you've
[1:51:08] got to defend this position at all cost
[1:51:11] so if they ran they would be Tito if
[1:51:14] they stayed they may die it didn't
[1:51:16] matter
[1:51:16] in a day they were post the Confederate
[1:51:18] Army Tom and Tom and Tom but yeah then
[1:51:22] it was getting to the point where they
[1:51:23] were going out of ammunition and just
[1:51:27] wrote able to begin to survey the man
[1:51:28] and he's looking he realized that they
[1:51:30] don't have enough ammunition to counter
[1:51:32] one more attack and he said boys fix
[1:51:34] your bayonet sometimes we gotta throw
[1:51:38] our source church he said boys fix your
[1:51:41] bayonet and on my charge he run down
[1:51:44] there screaming you November here they
[1:51:47] come the Confederate Army was coming up
[1:51:48] the hill and Joshua chambers
[1:51:51] all right boys to heart and they come
[1:51:54] running down the hill very ferocious and
[1:51:56] the son of mommy just gave up because
[1:51:59] they were tired they were defeated and
[1:52:01] they won the great victory that day
[1:52:03] Church our ammunition but they had a
[1:52:07] result in that post and uncles they
[1:52:11] didn't retreat Hey Dude go back hey kid

[1:54:53] morning father but you know the way they
[1:54:56] did should go father and I just I pray
[1:54:58] that the world will accomplish that

[1:55:22] rulership so father I ask that you just
[1:55:24] to bless the people now let's brother

[1:55:45] Jesse hey man
[1:55:51] [Music]
[1:56:12] every person here has a purpose God made
[1:56:17] each one of us for a purpose we heard
[1:56:21] this morning that we are sons and
[1:56:23] daughters of God with a purpose in a
[1:56:28] position I think we all know too is our
[1:56:32] brother preach you go from elected to
[1:56:34] call it anoint into positions like to
[1:56:38] first offer prayer for anyone who
[1:56:43] doesn't know their position because you
[1:56:45] cannot operate in your position until
[1:56:47] you know your position so we're doing
[1:56:50] two to two opportunities for prayer if
[1:56:53] you don't know your position and you
[1:56:56] want God to show your position and God's
[1:56:59] here to answer that request but if you
[1:57:03] know your position but maybe not
[1:57:05] operating in it as you should as our
[1:57:07] brother said when you're in position you
[1:57:09] speak the word you bind you loose you
[1:57:13] intercede you take Dominion amen so
[1:57:21] you're your own groan one of those today
[1:57:23] right we're all on one of those days
[1:57:25] where they're wondering well what is my
[1:57:26] position I don't know what I'm supposed
[1:57:27] to do in the church I don't know what
[1:57:29] I'm supposed to do my family I don't
[1:57:30] know I'm not sure what I'm supposed to
[1:57:32] do here or we know what we're called to
[1:57:36] do but we want to know God's will on
[1:57:39] what to do
[1:57:40] praise God perhaps you're sick though
[1:57:44] perhaps you're in need of other prayer
[1:57:46] perhaps you want to stand in for
[1:57:48] somebody that will be the second the
[1:57:51] second poll here so let's first let's
[1:57:53] bow our heads for a moment let's be
[1:57:55] honest before God God has sent our
[1:57:57] brother here to preach the word can't
[1:57:59] you feel the presence of the Lord can
[1:58:02] you feel God's presence and do you feel
[1:58:04] the sacredness of the word this morning
[1:58:05] hey buddy do you feel God's love too for
[1:58:09] you this morning
[1:58:10] I feel God's love for me this more I
[1:58:13] feel as presents I feel the the
[1:58:17] sincerity and power of the word I feel
[1:58:21] that let's go before the Lord Heavenly
[1:58:26] Father we want to take these two
[1:58:27] opportunities Lord as I'm listening and
[1:58:30] pulling and receiving thanking you for
[1:58:32] this word but I feel feel obligated Lord
[1:58:39] to first see who needs to know their
[1:58:41] position then also once Lord we know our
[1:58:46] position then we need your your will we
[1:58:49] need to know what to do in imposition
[1:58:51] dear God so lord I offer this prayer
[1:58:57] Lord before I call nor would you show
[1:59:00] everyone in our church their spiritual
[1:59:02] position in Christ their natural
[1:59:05] position in their home in their in their
[1:59:07] their personal life but also Lord show
[1:59:10] them their spiritual position whether
[1:59:15] it's in music weather and then everyone
[1:59:19] has one of the nine gifts Lord God for
[1:59:23] you show them that Lord if it's
[1:59:25] leadership like a deacon trust needs
[1:59:29] [Music]
[1:59:31] preacher one of the five code gifts if
[1:59:35] they're wondering what their gift is
[1:59:36] Lord I pray you'd show it to the Lord
[1:59:38] through a green together in prayer that
[1:59:43] we would not wander around and say what
[1:59:46] am I supposed to be doing where am I
[1:59:48] supposed to dwell spiritually what am I
[1:59:50] supposed to be doing father I praise
[1:59:53] grant everyone Lord who causes their
[1:59:56] home church to know their position so
[2:00:00] they can labor for the master father
[2:00:03] also I pray afterwards Lord if if those
[2:00:06] who know their position Lord need your
[2:00:09] grace
[2:00:11] you need your leadership Lord God to
[2:00:14] know the next step to speak or to pray
[2:00:16] or interceder a touch of healing lore
[2:00:19] whatever may be lord I pray you grant
[2:00:21] that for your glory to your God that's
[2:00:27] why you called Joshua to lead the people
[2:00:29] in and then position them naturally oh
[2:00:33] god we know Ephesians does the same
[2:00:36] today positions are spiritually dear God
[2:00:38] thank you lord thank you Jesus or
[2:00:43] position your people Lord and then
