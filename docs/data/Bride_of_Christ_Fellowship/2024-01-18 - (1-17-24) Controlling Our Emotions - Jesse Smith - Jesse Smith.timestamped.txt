[0:09] praise the Lord God bless the live
[0:11] streamers and trust you'll be blessed
[0:13] here by the word of God here
[0:16] tonight we like to look at uh
[0:18] controlling our emotions tonight by
[0:20] God's grace and looking at the emotions
[0:23] of Jesus Christ also I might even say uh
[0:26] being Christlike in our emotions so we
[0:29] want look at that uh just cuz I you know
[0:31] I'll share a little bit about it but I
[0:33] kind of had to deal with that this week
[0:34] here um and I just thought well I like
[0:37] when I like I like to feel when
[0:38] something's inspired to me like I feel
[0:39] like it comes from from God or something
[0:42] like that uh and I realized well I
[0:44] wasn't planning on this and I feel all
[0:46] these thoughts are coming to me that's
[0:47] normally how it happens with me I'll get
[0:48] one thought and then all these other
[0:50] thoughts will start flooding in and I
[0:52] just try to write them down as fast as I
[0:54] can you know as soon as I can write them
[0:55] out I just try to get them down as soon
[0:56] as possible and ask the Holy Spirit uh
[0:59] to reveal it to you and me and it would
[1:01] make sense it be a blessing to us by
[1:03] God's grace so uh Proverbs
[1:09] 25:28 why don't we just read that one
[1:11] here together and then we'll have you be
[1:12] seated here I want to watch the time
[1:14] again we have probably have school
[1:15] tomorrow I'm not expecting everybody not
[1:17] expecting them to call off two days in a
[1:19] row so we just want to enjoy that's our
[1:21] one snow day we probably that's all
[1:22] probably all we'll have so we want to be
[1:24] thankful for that and also watch the
[1:26] time as well by God's grace so let's
[1:28] read that if we can on three 1 2 3 he
[1:31] that have no rule over his own spirit is
[1:35] like a city that is broken down and
[1:38] Without Walls amen may God add His
[1:40] blessings to the reading of his word you
[1:41] can be seated here we like to look at
[1:44] controlling our emotions and of course
[1:46] with the subtopic of looking at Jesus's
[1:49] emotions um that he uh he had to keep in
[1:53] check uh by the grace of the
[1:56] Lord so um I kind of you know share my
[1:59] my inspiration you know I I was
[2:01] preaching on Sunday and what a wonderful
[2:03] service that was in the morning and of
[2:05] course I enjoyed the evening too but um
[2:08] Now read that scripture in Romans where
[2:10] it says he came in the likeness of
[2:12] sinful
[2:13] flesh and so that just struck me just
[2:15] kind of those words kind of jumped off
[2:17] you know uh the pages to me as I was
[2:19] preaching that I didn't quite know what
[2:20] to say and so I just was meditating on
[2:22] that on Monday the likeness of sinful
[2:25] flesh but the Bible said he was the word
[2:27] made flesh so his his nature was to obey
[2:31] the word of God I I do not believe Jesus
[2:34] had a sinful nature but of course his
[2:37] body was under the curse of sin whereas
[2:40] uh he would he could die of course um
[2:43] but I believe that's what that scripture
[2:45] was speaking of there uh in the likeness
[2:47] of sinful flesh and the Bible said he
[2:49] had no beauty that we would desire him
[2:52] you know he might have been a beautiful
[2:53] baby like we just come through Christmas
[2:54] right and all these videos and
[2:55] everything they're like w he's such a
[2:57] beautiful baby and that might have been
[2:59] lots of Bab babies are beautiful don't
[3:00] you think moms and dads there's only one
[3:04] Dad here and one mom here but you know
[3:06] siblings you know uh every baby's
[3:09] beautiful I believe because God formed
[3:11] them uh in the womb uh God knit them
[3:14] together Hallelujah but that struck me
[3:17] you know the likess of sinful flesh when
[3:20] when when they would look at him uh they
[3:21] wouldn't see uh some someone beautiful
[3:24] or handsome you know they just saw a
[3:27] galileon they just saw a a a Nazareth
[3:30] You Know a Man from Nazareth Jesus of
[3:32] Nazareth they just saw a regular man no
[3:35] beauty that we would desire here I was
[3:37] even reading this week how you know
[3:38] Absalon remember the Bible said Absalon
[3:40] David's son was the most beautiful man
[3:43] the Bible said there was no blemish in
[3:44] him remember his hair was so long he
[3:47] could cut it off every year and I forget
[3:48] how many pounds it was but remember that
[3:51] beauty became a snare to him remember
[3:54] that became a snare and then he stole
[3:56] the hearts uh of the people he said the
[4:00] people would come for questions and
[4:01] maybe David you know they did it so
[4:03] beautifully on the Sight and Sound you
[4:04] know David couldn't answer all the
[4:06] questions and so he'd say oh that
[4:08] somebody was here right at the gates
[4:10] that could answer your questions oh I
[4:12] just wish somebody was here and they're
[4:14] like well maybe you can do it Absalon
[4:15] you're the King's son well maybe I can
[4:17] I'm here and no doubt he looked handsome
[4:20] you know he must had the oil all rubbed
[4:22] over him you know looking fresh and
[4:24] clean in the morning his hair was just
[4:27] amazing you that amazing hair had but
[4:31] through that beauty and through his uh
[4:33] know deceit he stole the hearts of the
[4:35] people and eventually of course you know
[4:37] he took over the throne for a short
[4:40] period and of course partly that
[4:42] happened because of David's own sin as
[4:43] we saw on Sunday he was out of position
[4:46] at the wrong time he chose the wrong
[4:47] time in season to take off that's why I
[4:51] think the Bible tells us be instant in
[4:53] season and not of season praise God
[4:56] hallelujah you know recognize you know
[4:58] whether we feel like it or not can I say
[5:00] like that whether we feel like it or not
[5:01] let's obey the word of God let's do what
[5:03] God called us to do praise God
[5:05] hallelujah other words let's not like
[5:07] the Bible said let's not make provision
[5:09] for our flesh to sin so if you're in a
[5:12] season of rest or thank God for that if
[5:14] you're a season of fewer battles let's
[5:16] thank God for that but let's not make a
[5:18] provision for the flesh right David made
[5:21] in that case he made provision for the
[5:23] flesh the Bible said he despised the
[5:24] Commandment of God so he he looked at
[5:27] the woman there basba and he thought
[5:29] about the word of God he despised that
[5:30] and he made provision remember he went
[5:32] through all those steps to sin may God
[5:35] help us before we make plans to sin may
[5:37] God help us in in the in the steps of
[5:39] that those plans may God help us to
[5:41] convict us may something happen right
[5:44] May something somebody get sick or may
[5:46] uh something happen where it would it
[5:48] would cause us to forget about the sin
[5:50] and we'd obey the word of God Amen how
[5:52] many want that by God's grace amen
[5:54] that's what I want you know before uh I
[5:56] I would sin and before I would I would
[5:58] make provision for our flesh because we
[6:00] know Paul did it he did things he hated
[6:02] uh Peter did it he did things that he he
[6:04] uh regretted but that God would
[6:06] intervene like a you know like aimc he
[6:09] said Lord you know the Integrity of my
[6:11] heart I don't want to sin against you
[6:12] that's what we want to have we want to
[6:14] have integrity that we would not sin
[6:15] against God hallelujah amen and and uh
[6:19] and so you know abson did that and I
[6:21] just you know I was just reading this
[6:22] weekend and remember when he died his
[6:25] hair got caught in the tree his his
[6:28] beauty is what got him trapped the
[6:30] natural thing he he must have spent all
[6:32] this time on his natural beauty right he
[6:35] spent all this time on and the very
[6:37] thing he he thought was his his glory is
[6:40] what got him trapped and then of course
[6:42] you know they they ended his life I
[6:44] thought interesting and then the Bible
[6:46] said in Ezekiel 28 that that Satan was
[6:49] the full sum of beauty right but that
[6:53] because of his Beauty because of his
[6:54] wisdom that's what brought about the
[6:56] unbelief in his life Hallelujah so I
[6:59] just thought was interesting there that
[7:00] you know it was such a snare Hallelujah
[7:03] and may God help us to to stay out of
[7:05] all the snares that the enemy lays Amen
[7:08] in this case you know the snares are
[7:09] emotions sometimes the emotions get to
[7:13] uh get the best of us we'll say it like
[7:15] that okay so I just want to look at that
[7:17] tonight you know as I was uh that's one
[7:20] of the things you know the lightness of
[7:21] sinful flesh I was looking at uh uh
[7:23] Absalon the other thing you know
[7:25] somebody you know one of the accusers on
[7:27] YouTube now so far he's been a nice guy
[7:29] but looked at me and or I'm sorry he
[7:30] wrote me uh things and said uh some of
[7:32] my comments don't see seem so
[7:35] Christlike I thought huh am I like
[7:38] Christ
[7:39] online I want to be like Christ in my
[7:41] house I want to be like Christ at the
[7:44] church I also want to be like Christ
[7:46] online right right and so I prayed I
[7:48] wait on it I wrote him back I told him I
[7:51] think I was because I had scripture for
[7:53] it Hallelujah and so but that really
[7:56] made me examine myself I think that was
[7:57] just yesterday you know his comment just
[7:59] like stuck with me for a whole day like
[8:02] am I Christlike am I Christlike so I
[8:05] started searching my heart and he said
[8:07] uh are you bitter are you getting your
[8:08] emotions getting the best of you I
[8:10] thought am I are my emotions getting the
[8:12] best of
[8:13] me and I I admit you know sometimes uh
[8:16] my emotions do get the best of me that's
[8:18] why I said on Sunday I want to be
[8:19] careful how much I preach against the
[8:22] trolls because it just affects you when
[8:25] people call you liar or they call you uh
[8:30] uh different names it affects you you
[8:31] know whether it's in word or whether
[8:33] it's to your face or whether you hear
[8:35] about it secondhand or gossip about you
[8:38] uh you know the these things affect you
[8:40] right and so I I could tell my emotions
[8:42] were affected and I thought because I
[8:45] was accused of being not Christlike well
[8:47] I want to be like Christ how many want
[8:49] to be like Jesus amen
[8:54] hallelujah and uh you know and then and
[8:56] then this thought you know I thought of
[8:58] this sermon the brother brother preached
[8:59] 10 years ago about the emotions of
[9:03] Christ and Simon mentioned it too I
[9:05] heard Simon preach at his home church
[9:06] and he he brought this sermon from 10
[9:08] years ago I'm like wow if that stayed on
[9:09] Simon's heart from 10 years ago must be
[9:11] a pretty good sermon how many sermons
[9:14] can you reply or recall from
[9:18] 2014 and I'm like wow Simon I didn't I
[9:21] remember the sermon but I didn't know
[9:22] what year was so I went listening to it
[9:23] today I was thoroughly blessed but then
[9:25] that reminded me I've always want to
[9:26] preach this sermon I just want to go
[9:28] through Matthew all the way through John
[9:30] you know Lord winning once I get these
[9:31] Paul sermons done if the Lord terries if
[9:33] I can get through Paul's Epistles maybe
[9:35] if I can just get through Romans maybe
[9:36] I'll jump to Matthew and start preaching
[9:38] through the but I would just love to
[9:39] preach our series on the life of Jesus
[9:41] Christ what I mean doesn't that sound
[9:45] Heavenly he's the Heavenly Son of God
[9:47] hallelujah he's God in flesh Hallelujah
[9:50] he's The Treasure of Heaven I like that
[9:52] song the darling of Heaven he's amen
[9:54] he's the king of Heaven the king of
[9:56] Glory Hallelujah and he come down to
[9:58] earth in flesh to help us out praise God
[10:00] Amen not just help us out save our souls
[10:02] Way Beyond that hallelujah amen and then
[10:05] now he can be the high priest who makes
[10:07] intercession for us now he can
[10:10] understand what you and I go through huj
[10:13] we have somebody who who can be a secure
[10:16] the Bible says a helper we have somebody
[10:18] who can help us who knows what we've
[10:20] gone through there as a man I can say
[10:22] well sisters don't understand this and
[10:24] as a woman wom say well brother Jesse
[10:26] don't understand that that might be true
[10:27] I but the Bible said Jesus was tempted
[10:29] in all points like as we are so whatever
[10:32] issue you're struggling with it goes
[10:34] back to just being tempted by sin right
[10:37] it's one of those three areas the lust
[10:38] of the flesh lust of the eyes P life
[10:40] it's one of those right and the Bible
[10:43] said he was tempted in all let's all say
[10:45] all can we all all points yet without
[10:49] sin so we can look to Jesus and we can
[10:52] find help to control our emotions praise
[10:55] God and we can do our best to be Christ
[10:59] like with our emotions amen hallelujah
[11:03] amen uh Psalm 51:10 David writes this
[11:06] after the S basba created me a clean
[11:10] heart that's why I love what the Bible
[11:11] said the Bible said be a new creation
[11:14] well it's not just one time I'm a new
[11:16] creation amen it's anytime I fall short
[11:19] and want to get right with God creating
[11:21] me a clean heart oh God Amen create that
[11:24] in me in other words I'll let you work
[11:25] in my emotions and you'll renew a right
[11:29] Spirit Within Me amen because we can all
[11:32] remember I used to have a right Spirit
[11:34] but something vexed my
[11:36] spirit right sister Zer was texting
[11:38] about that that was a great text there
[11:39] sister Z that really helped
[11:41] me you know we're trying to serve God
[11:44] but then these Devils come many times
[11:46] through other people to Vex us right
[11:49] remember that I just saw that this week
[11:51] uh uh Israel Vex Moses and that's when
[11:54] he smoked The Rock he let the people Vex
[11:57] him right
[11:59] uh other other Saints down through the
[12:01] Bible uh they got vexed by other people
[12:05] now it was lot's fault all the all the
[12:07] homosexuals vexed lot that was lot's
[12:09] fault right he didn't have to live there
[12:12] a church we don't have to put up with
[12:14] some things Hallelujah we got to make
[12:17] sure we don't allow sin to Vex us in our
[12:19] hearts and lives and even Moses he
[12:22] didn't have to let the people Vex him
[12:24] nobody can Vex US unless we let it right
[12:28] right so the fact that I've you know
[12:29] mentioned trolls and that over the
[12:31] months and maybe
[12:33] years uh is sometimes it's obvious that
[12:36] it's it's getting to me and I can't let
[12:38] it get to me I got to have the control
[12:40] of the Holy Spirit I do believe that
[12:42] times God wants me to warn those people
[12:43] no doubt about that the Bible says warn
[12:46] all men right amen and I had even had
[12:48] one guy uh email me today he said you
[12:50] know your your ministry there is one of
[12:53] the main Ministries for defending the
[12:54] message he said people around the world
[12:56] look to you well I knew that but it was
[12:58] just interesting to hear from somebody
[12:59] else so I was like wow this guy's
[13:01] against me so uh I see if God's using me
[13:04] that way then especially I want to have
[13:06] a Christlike Spirit right if God's
[13:09] called me to do this and also uh
[13:12] Shepherd the Saints at the same time
[13:14] then I always want to have the
[13:15] Christlike spirit I always want to say
[13:17] create in me a clean heart not I don't
[13:20] want a dirty heart Cu
[13:22] uh I'll do that sometimes right I'm a
[13:24] sinner saved by grace I'll I'll let my
[13:27] heart become dirty right we let our
[13:28] Minds become dirty no matter what the
[13:30] sin is church understand what I'm saying
[13:32] but God promised he can create a new one
[13:35] praise God and he can bring back that
[13:37] former uh spirit that that that former
[13:40] cleanness that we used to have he can
[13:42] make it new for us hallelujah am he can
[13:45] bring it back again hallelujah amen amen
[13:48] and if God could do it for David under
[13:49] the blood of B and ghost surely he can
[13:51] do a great thing under the blood of
[13:52] Jesus
[13:54] Christ and so it goes back to this verse
[13:56] as I as we open up with you and I have
[13:59] to rule over our Spirits I think it's
[14:01] good from time to time I just felt led
[14:03] like this was what the Holy Spirit
[14:04] wanted me to deal with because it's
[14:06] something in my own life I want to make
[14:07] sure I always rule over my
[14:10] emotions right uh if not I'm I'm like a
[14:13] a wall a walless city I have no defense
[14:17] and then anybody can attack and anybody
[14:19] can hurt me if I don't keep my emotions
[14:21] in check isn't that true parents you
[14:24] don't have to say Amen but even your
[14:26] children can hurt you if you don't have
[14:28] your emotions in
[14:30] yes right in other words like let's say
[14:33] Zion or Jen spill something and I get
[14:36] mad why I've Lo I've now they can hurt
[14:38] me right they're they're but I shouldn't
[14:41] get mad what's wrong with me something's
[14:43] wrong with me it's just a little spill
[14:45] clean it up brother Jess don't get mad
[14:48] right don't don't yell at the child
[14:50] don't you know what I mean like that's
[14:51] what I'm saying like if we don't keep
[14:53] our defenses up if we don't keep our
[14:55] protection up if we don't keep uh
[14:57] control of our our El like we ought to
[15:01] then we can be hurt by any little thing
[15:04] that anything's offensive that that
[15:05] we're so sensitive Everybody Hurts us
[15:08] but really we should love even those who
[15:10] hurt us praise God Amen right in some
[15:13] sense we should be so
[15:16] lovable right that that that nobody can
[15:18] hurt us for some for some period of time
[15:21] is what I'm saying right that has to be
[15:25] the case how else then can we love our
[15:27] enemies mhm and bless those who curse us
[15:32] I've been called everything you want on
[15:34] I've been called Judas I've been called
[15:35] Satan I've been called el iot all that
[15:39] right but I know it's not true because I
[15:41] see Jesus in my life amen amen that live
[15:45] the life but how do these things you
[15:47] know uh how do we not be sensitive to it
[15:50] we got to set up the walls of the word
[15:52] of God the Bible say the walls are
[15:54] salvation I always like Chris Thomas
[15:56] song on that your walls are salvation
[15:58] your gates are praise amen and that's in
[16:00] the Bible hallelujah amen amen so we got
[16:02] to remember God's delivered me uh he
[16:04] saved me and that's the walls of
[16:07] Salvation I'm saved I'm
[16:09] delivered amen I'm controlling my
[16:12] emotions hallelujah amen and if my walls
[16:16] are down then I know God can create in
[16:18] me a clean heart God can create in me
[16:20] walls again he can restore the walls
[16:23] amen amen so I'm defended by the Holy
[16:25] Spirit hallelujah amen amen amen I
[16:27] thought about this Church there's a time
[16:30] um you know I've been criticized people
[16:32] say oh uh you don't have to defend the
[16:34] message the message defends itself well
[16:36] there's actually a you know there's a
[16:38] scripture for it Paul said I'm in
[16:40] defense of the
[16:41] Gospel right and not only that you have
[16:44] the Old Testament type once Israel got
[16:47] in the land you know fight fight fight
[16:49] fight fight but after that they had to
[16:50] defend defend defend
[16:53] defend remember when brother Jim was
[16:55] here what he preached on hither to God
[16:58] what was the the text Invaders were
[17:00] coming in it was defense
[17:02] time because the enemy comes in like a
[17:05] he comes in got to defend your ground
[17:07] amen amen hallelujah see there's times
[17:10] you're breaking through right brother
[17:11] amen we're breaking through the Enemy
[17:13] Lines and just trying to possess
[17:15] whatever attribute we desire maybe it's
[17:18] Joy maybe getting our joy back right
[17:20] amen maybe you could say I got my joy
[17:22] back brother jesser or brother Malachi I
[17:24] got my I got my peace back well then the
[17:26] enemy is going to come try to come in
[17:28] and take that now you got to defend that
[17:30] peace come on somebody amen you got to
[17:33] defend that Joy amen amen amen you got
[17:35] to defend that uh uh love of the Lord
[17:38] you know your your patience and your
[17:40] longsuffering and your uh your emotions
[17:43] you got to defend that because you
[17:46] fought it right you fought for it you've
[17:48] achieved your God's let you achieve it
[17:50] God's rewarded you that's what that's
[17:52] what David said God has rewarded me for
[17:53] my righteousness David said that he's a
[17:56] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[17:58] him amen so I just I was meditating on
[18:00] that this this or today I'm like that's
[18:02] exactly right once Israel got in the
[18:04] land now they got to defend it
[18:06] Hallelujah once you get the blessing now
[18:08] you got to defend it praise God well
[18:10] that's that's how your healing can be
[18:12] you can get healed but then the devil
[18:13] try to bring sickness what you got to do
[18:15] you got to fend off the lies amen you
[18:18] got to fight off the lies of the Enemy
[18:20] No I am healed I am saved Hallelujah I
[18:23] do have peace I do have Victory amen
[18:25] hallelujah amen I Am A Friend Of God am
[18:29] amen he calls me friend Hallelujah in
[18:32] the word of God
[18:34] hallelujah I received Jesus because I
[18:36] received those who preached about Jesus
[18:39] to me just like Jesus said hallelujah
[18:41] amen so if I receive the preachers that
[18:43] preach about Jesus then I receive Jesus
[18:45] I'm a friend of God hallelujah amen amen
[18:47] amen
[18:49] amen now it was interesting I went
[18:51] online and I just found the first the
[18:53] first article how many emotions are
[18:57] there now this article said in
[19:00] Aristotle's time he was a famous
[19:01] philosopher you ever heard of
[19:03] Aristotle he is a smart fell he said
[19:06] there's 14
[19:08] emotions let me read them real quick
[19:10] fear confidence anger friendship calm
[19:13] emnity that's hatred shame shamelessness
[19:15] pity kindness Envy indignation emulation
[19:18] contempt then in the 1900s a man named
[19:22] Robert uh plut
[19:24] chick he uh narrowed it down to
[19:27] eight Joy sadness trust disgust fear
[19:31] anger surprise and
[19:34] anticipation and then another
[19:38] University I for I I didn't write it
[19:40] down there but the un uh University
[19:41] studied it again and they brought it
[19:43] down to just four now I like four
[19:46] remember when I preach on the numerology
[19:48] series who know remember what four had
[19:50] had a couple meanings it represented
[19:52] Deliverance but it also represented an
[19:54] Earthly number so I think the Earthly
[19:57] number works there we we experienced
[19:58] four types of emotions now I could be
[20:01] wrong I just thought was interesting now
[20:03] what made me laugh was I thought about
[20:04] how many emojis are there for
[20:07] emotions there's like 60 just for
[20:09] happiness you know like one's like I
[20:13] should the Emojis one's
[20:16] like one's real big smile eyes open eyes
[20:19] closed you know that's all expressing
[20:23] these emotions but this University bowed
[20:26] down to Four Happiness sadness anger and
[20:29] fear I thought that's pretty good that's
[20:31] sounds like about
[20:33] right Beyond this they said it's more
[20:36] there's just complex variations of those
[20:39] four so I thought you know just thinking
[20:42] about just for us it'd be a lot easier
[20:44] if we can just narrow down what are we
[20:45] feeling to one of those four so let me
[20:48] read them again
[20:51] happiness sadness there's opposite right
[20:54] happy sad anger and fear anger fear
[21:00] okay now uh remember uh if you would
[21:03] honey pull up Colossians 3
[21:06] ver1 and the brother on Sunday night
[21:07] preached a good message on loneliness
[21:09] I'm probably going to preach on that my
[21:11] own kind of customized sermon of that
[21:13] the only way I can preach it was a nice
[21:15] good message on loneliness and he
[21:17] basically brought it down to you have to
[21:18] spend time with God and then you'll
[21:19] never be lonely amen and he used these
[21:22] words he says imagine we get to
[21:24] fellowship with the greatest person in
[21:26] the entire universe amen how can I be
[21:28] lonely amen that's basically what I was
[21:31] like I went up for prayer I did amen I
[21:35] went up for prayer and then brother Ray
[21:37] text me he said you know he was sitting
[21:39] right in front of me and he said uh when
[21:40] I saw you up for prayer I was just going
[21:42] to turn around and tell you I think the
[21:43] Lord wants you to go up for prayer so I
[21:45] it was just you know how Ray is he's
[21:46] real spiritual I love Brother Ray oh
[21:48] yeah he sends his greetings too by God's
[21:50] face he told me a good testimony
[21:52] apparently there's been some healings
[21:53] that God is using to me he asked me to
[21:55] share that testimony with you so that
[21:56] was really good Colossians 3 vers one so
[21:59] we have these four emotions right
[22:01] apparently there could be 20 I'm not
[22:03] going against Aristotle I'm just saying
[22:05] it it simplifies it for you and I to
[22:06] stay full okay if you be risen with
[22:09] Christ I preached on this a couple years
[22:10] ago seek those things which are above
[22:12] where Christ Seth on the right hand of
[22:14] God is it verse two set your affections
[22:16] on things above yes set your affection
[22:18] so your affection is your love right so
[22:20] set your emotions on things above not on
[22:23] things Earth so it has to be set like
[22:25] you set your thermometer this last night
[22:29] how many said it last night right oh you
[22:32] didn't turn it off you said it why' you
[22:35] said it because you want to make sure
[22:36] you were the right condition right how
[22:39] many know we got to set our emotions on
[22:41] Christ amen amen if we want to enjoy the
[22:43] right atmosphere right amen hallelujah
[22:46] me just you got to set it on Christ how
[22:48] we do that through talking to Christ
[22:49] prayer repentance right worshiping the
[22:52] Lord giving God glory amen you have to
[22:55] we have to set our
[22:56] emotions on Christ I love this one too
[22:59] um 1 Chronicles uh
[23:02] 29 just go to verse three though this
[23:06] has always been uh I preached this years
[23:09] ago I just when I started reading on
[23:10] David and man I I just found such I
[23:13] found such com comaraderie with David I
[23:15] felt like he's like me or I'm like I I'm
[23:17] like him I see the same thing with Paul
[23:20] and Hezekiah those are three guys I see
[23:22] a lot of myself in them 1 Chronicles
[23:24] 29:3 moreover because I have set my
[23:27] affection House of God I have my own
[23:29] proper good of gold and silver which
[23:31] I've given in the house of my God over
[23:32] and above all that I prepare for the
[23:34] holy house just leave that up there for
[23:35] a
[23:36] moment so David's going off the scene
[23:39] right but he says uh he says I want to
[23:42] he said God should be in a house and
[23:43] Nathan says do all that's in your heart
[23:46] and then God told Nathan nope he's not
[23:48] going to build the house go tell David
[23:50] he won't build the house his son after
[23:51] him will build the house right and we
[23:54] learn that God doesn't tell us prophets
[23:55] everything right Hallelujah
[23:58] so he goes back and he tells him these
[24:00] things and then David said you know I he
[24:02] said now I'm going to I'm going to store
[24:03] up all this gold and silver Timber Cedar
[24:06] I'm going to store all this up because
[24:08] I've set my affection on the house of
[24:11] God Amen now this is why I've always
[24:13] thought church is the highlight of my
[24:15] week coming and worshiping with you
[24:18] praising God even before some of you
[24:19] were here by God's grace which is all
[24:21] good you know we all come at different
[24:22] times but even before you're here
[24:24] worshiping God has always been our
[24:27] pleasure Hallelujah
[24:28] amen very few things in life I'm not
[24:31] sure if there's any that would be more
[24:33] wonderful than Church it should always
[24:35] be uh the Highlight the Bible says he's
[24:39] a man after God's Own Heart so of course
[24:41] he want to go to God's house Hallelujah
[24:44] that's that's what he's known for he's
[24:46] known for being a man after the heart of
[24:48] God and was it Psalm 27 uh that says one
[24:51] thing I desire the Lord I think we
[24:53] saying that better as one day of your
[24:55] courts right we sing that at uh recently
[24:58] at a sermon can you pull that up there
[24:59] Psalm 27 one thing I
[25:02] desire so here's a man his heart is
[25:05] after God he loves going to God's
[25:08] house and so he he set he sets his love
[25:12] on the house of
[25:14] God yeah verse four one thing I desire
[25:16] of the Lord that I will seek after that
[25:18] I may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[25:19] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[25:21] of the Lord and to inquire of his Temple
[25:24] the same man said created in me a clean
[25:27] heart amen and renew a steadfast Spirit
[25:30] Within Me praise God the same man after
[25:32] his baby boy died he went to the house
[25:35] of God and worship God in his darkest of
[25:37] moments he found peace and victory he
[25:40] found renewal in the house of God
[25:42] hallelujah amen may that be the same for
[25:44] us in our Darkest Hours no matter what
[25:46] light whatever whatever God allows light
[25:48] to bring upon us may we be able to come
[25:50] to the house of God and express our
[25:52] emotion our love for God hallelujah amen
[25:55] in our darkest moments but they got to
[25:58] be set our motions have to be directed
[26:00] toward God
[26:04] Amen like you set your thermostat or you
[26:07] set your timer or your alarm clock we
[26:10] must uh Focus all our emotions on God
[26:13] that's why I've always condemned you
[26:14] know people going to sports games and
[26:17] shouting louder at sports games than
[26:18] they do for God I won't be guilty of
[26:22] that Hallelujah I I was guilty of it
[26:25] before but I've learned better now
[26:26] praise God amen amen or no matter uh you
[26:30] shout uh uh uh you know whatever
[26:33] whatever the purpose may be I got a sale
[26:35] at Macy's or there's a sale at woo I got
[26:38] a buy one get one free at at Arby's woo
[26:42] the coupon come in the mail or woo I got
[26:44] 5,000 off on a new car you know whatever
[26:47] emotion it may be it cannot it come to
[26:50] comparable it cannot be anything close
[26:52] to the emotion of worshiping God and
[26:54] loving God hallelujah amen and giving
[26:57] him glory for what he's done for us
[26:59] praise God Amen to know that all things
[27:01] work together for good to them that love
[27:03] the Lord amen to them that are called
[27:06] according to his purpose praise God Amen
[27:08] to know that there's no condemnation to
[27:10] those of us that are in Christ Jesus
[27:12] amen am that ought to make the emotions
[27:14] really excited hallelujah amen there's
[27:18] no damnatory sentence on my life praise
[27:20] God Amen so I'm setting my emotions on
[27:22] the things of God Amen
[27:25] Hallelujah now uh dealing with this you
[27:28] know I I just want to De deal with this
[27:30] a little bit you know uh I was accused
[27:33] of maybe being too harsh and so I
[27:36] searched my heart you know and I thought
[27:38] well
[27:39] Lord was I too
[27:42] harsh and uh so I just prayed about it
[27:45] and let's go to Mark 3:5 Mark
[27:51] 3:5 but here's an example where Jesus
[27:54] experiences the the emotion of anger now
[27:58] how many think it was I'm sorry I say
[28:00] how many know he was right with his
[28:01] anger
[28:04] right his anger was
[28:07] justified yes
[28:09] Hallelujah but why was it Justified now
[28:12] keep that up there but previously
[28:14] remember he comes in there and uh I
[28:17] think the man's hand needs healed right
[28:21] and uh he ask them you know should we
[28:22] can I heal on the Sabbath or not right
[28:26] but he goes ahead and heals the man
[28:27] right and when he looked around about
[28:29] them with anger being grieved for their
[28:30] hardness of their hearts he sayith to
[28:31] the man stretch forth thine hand and he
[28:33] stretched it out and his hand was
[28:35] restored whole as the
[28:37] other so this group was so against Jesus
[28:40] they didn't want to see Jesus heal on a
[28:42] certain
[28:44] day right they were so Bound by their
[28:46] their Creeds and dogmas and traditions
[28:48] of man that they didn't even want to see
[28:51] Jesus heal a man's hand in order to they
[28:54] rather see Jesus obey their Creeds than
[28:57] then heal a man and Jesus was upset
[29:00] about that right okay so he was upset at
[29:05] stubbornness he was upset at hard
[29:09] Hearts right right and so in my life I
[29:11] looked at it and I thought that's all
[29:13] I'm said about if people look at my
[29:15] words harshly then I believe I was
[29:17] justified in my
[29:19] anger but at the beginning at the but I
[29:22] looked at my comments and at the
[29:23] beginning it says God bless you and then
[29:26] dear friend
[29:28] at the end I always put this is written
[29:29] with brotherly kindness and respects in
[29:31] hope you'll
[29:32] repent so you know I you try to you try
[29:36] to express as much love and grace as you
[29:39] can but you got to call black black and
[29:42] white
[29:43] white and so Jesus experienced this
[29:47] anger and I want you to notice too in
[29:49] verse six and the Pharisees went forth
[29:51] in straight way took counsel with the
[29:52] herodians against him how they might
[29:54] destroy him but Jesus withdrew himself
[29:56] with his disciples to the Sea so both
[29:58] groups Jesus didn't hang around say let
[30:00] me try and make their heart
[30:03] soft that's right anybody ever think
[30:05] about that I heard a preacher I heard
[30:08] the preacher sound that's a good thought
[30:10] he didn't hang around and say well let
[30:11] me see if I can make you
[30:13] soft-hearted doesn't it remind you of
[30:15] pharaoh of the Old Testament Moses said
[30:18] Moses kept giving the plagues and his
[30:20] heart got harder and harder and harder
[30:22] in other words the Holy Ghost will lead
[30:24] you to the people that can be
[30:26] soft-hearted amen but the Holy Ghost
[30:28] will show you who the soft-hearted ones
[30:30] because all that the father has given me
[30:32] will come to me praise God
[30:34] Amen Jesus said very few will find the
[30:37] narrow road that leads to a soft-hearted
[30:39] experience with Christ hallelujah amen
[30:42] and that's what to say most people are
[30:44] hard-hearted against the Bible
[30:46] revelations of this hour they still want
[30:48] to have uh adultery fornication
[30:51] homosexuality women preachers they still
[30:54] want to have all that but you can't have
[30:56] that and say you're right with God in
[30:58] the perfect will of God hallelujah
[30:59] you're the perfect will of God when you
[31:01] live by every word that proceeds out of
[31:03] the mouth of
[31:04] God glory but Jesus didn't hang around
[31:07] and say well you know I'll try to I'll
[31:10] try to make them
[31:12] soft-hearted Hallelujah doesn't the
[31:14] Bible say be angry and sin not let's P
[31:18] that up there I want to look that one
[31:20] up angry and not uh Ephesians 4 let's
[31:24] read 23 Ephesians 423 because this is
[31:26] the other one
[31:28] be renewed in the spirit of your mind so
[31:31] see your emotions are going to need
[31:32] renewing constantly yes constantly so in
[31:36] our day what you know Satan attacks a
[31:38] lot of us madebe with condemnation so I
[31:41] I just noticed it I don't know about you
[31:42] but Americans often lack some Joy
[31:45] brother brings it up in the church age
[31:47] book we have the most material things of
[31:49] any
[31:50] generation and yet we have the most
[31:52] people on depression
[31:55] medication our lives are longer well
[31:58] except for the before pre Flood now post
[32:01] flood right post post flood and the last
[32:04] we'd say thousand years or so our lives
[32:06] are the longest lifespan we got the
[32:08] longest life the most physical
[32:10] Goods right and yet we battle having
[32:15] Joy right right so what do we need we
[32:18] need the renewal power of the Holy
[32:20] Spirit to bring our emotions back
[32:25] amen he says be renewed in the spirit of
[32:27] your mind put on the new man which after
[32:30] God is created in righteousness and true
[32:32] Holiness I like that true Holiness right
[32:34] there a form of godliness there's a form
[32:36] of Holiness but it's not true
[32:39] Holiness wherefore putting away ly speak
[32:41] every man truth with his neighbor for we
[32:43] are members one another be angry and sin
[32:45] not let not the sin go down upon your
[32:48] wrath neither give place to the devil so
[32:51] here we get the good idea if we don't
[32:53] take care of some sin before the sun
[32:55] goes down the devil gets a placed in our
[32:57] mind then we're going to wake up
[33:00] cranky sometimes you go to bed happy you
[33:02] wake up
[33:03] cranky get attacked in your sleep you
[33:05] know uh the enemy comes like I got
[33:07] attacked physically a few weeks ago in
[33:10] your sleep you know you might go to bed
[33:11] happy go to bed uh refreshed you're
[33:14] thankful in the Lord and you might have
[33:15] an
[33:17] attack but the Bible clearly says we can
[33:19] be angry and sin not Hallelujah Jesus
[33:23] looked on them with
[33:25] anger he didn't look on them with
[33:27] happiness or kindness or compassion now
[33:29] some people he did but in that case it
[33:32] was anger and he was justified of all of
[33:35] it praise God what do we call that we
[33:37] call that righteous righteous
[33:38] indignation right amen amen it was
[33:41] righteous it was justified anger so
[33:43] there's times that you know God will uh
[33:47] have give us like a holy anger but we
[33:50] can't keep feeding it right we can't let
[33:53] it go off into sin all right now I want
[33:57] to um transition kind of into that into
[34:00] the critical
[34:05] spirit Proverbs 17:20 I preach this back
[34:09] in
[34:10] 2016 eight years ago I preached on uh
[34:13] the critical spirit I remember because
[34:15] Scott Walker was here and he come up and
[34:17] said I really enjoyed that brother over
[34:19] in the other Sanctuary there is on an
[34:21] evening service too I remember that
[34:23] Proverbs 17:20 he that ha a forward
[34:25] heart findeth no good now frower means a
[34:28] perverse heart so he that has a
[34:31] perverted Spirit now you know I don't
[34:33] want to we don't want to call ourselves
[34:35] perverted
[34:36] but I think what it means is he that has
[34:39] sin in his emotions right you know yeah
[34:44] I mean if we're if we're in a spot of
[34:45] sinning yeah we would say we're not our
[34:47] our best sense we're in a perverted
[34:49] sense right but we're not perverted like
[34:52] Sinners are perverted that's the point
[34:53] I'm trying to
[34:55] make so he that hath a frower heart
[34:58] findeth no good now this is the
[35:00] scripture I use for a critical
[35:02] spirit right because that that's where
[35:05] we you and I will battle if God gives us
[35:07] righteous indonation we got to be very
[35:08] careful you know not to become a
[35:10] critical spirit
[35:13] right and so this is what the Bible
[35:15] tells us here when we have a critical
[35:17] spirit we find nothing good about the
[35:20] situation that's why it's always
[35:21] important to see the glass half
[35:24] full right let's see half full instead
[35:28] of like everything's awful my whole life
[35:30] is awful this whole situation is awful
[35:33] well you can say well at least I'm not
[35:35] in at least I'm not dead right at least
[35:38] you can find something good about it
[35:39] praise God
[35:41] right I'm not talking about you know
[35:43] like really awful situation I'm just
[35:46] talking about like our day-to-day life
[35:47] you know and maybe like I said you know
[35:49] people speak evil words against us like
[35:51] like in my case you know that we're
[35:53] talking about
[35:54] here brother said this too I read this
[35:57] uh when I preach this 1961 he
[36:02] said he says uh he say sometimes people
[36:05] go back and become a church member with
[36:08] your name on the book and they give you
[36:09] a letter and you pack the letter now we
[36:11] don't do that today in message churches
[36:13] he said but as soon as something goes
[36:14] wrong there in your new church you blow
[36:17] up and I don't he said like I don't know
[36:19] what and you take it over to the next
[36:21] church and as soon as something goes
[36:23] wrong there you take it to the next
[36:25] Church see you haven't done right in the
[36:27] first place so I'm using this scripture
[36:30] to show how brother says people will go
[36:32] from church to church and blow up when
[36:35] things don't go their way and they keep
[36:36] blowing up blowing up blowing up right
[36:40] they have no control over their emotions
[36:43] Hallelujah they've got a critical spirit
[36:45] this church is wrong well that church is
[36:47] wrong that church is wrong right and you
[36:49] know the saying uh if you think you got
[36:50] a perfect church and you go there well
[36:52] now it's no longer perfect
[36:54] right but of course there is no perfect
[36:56] Church church and I found that to be
[36:57] true I've been in in in close quarters
[37:00] with numerous churches now when I first
[37:02] started going to domestic churches I
[37:04] thought everybody was an angel but I
[37:06] found out lots of them were devils right
[37:10] I should say lots of them some of them
[37:11] were devils now some Churches they did
[37:13] have lots of devils but not not the ones
[37:15] I'm speaking
[37:16] of because they eventually uh you know
[37:19] sin and do awful
[37:22] things but you know that's the idea here
[37:25] we we must have we must have God created
[37:27] me new restore my emotions so they're
[37:30] the right emotions right right we always
[37:33] talk about our first love why can I feel
[37:35] like you did at the beginning but says
[37:36] if you repent like you did at the
[37:37] beginning you'll get the same first love
[37:40] I'm just
[37:41] paraphrasing right he says if we want
[37:43] our first love back he said don't you
[37:45] think if you want your first love back
[37:46] you have to do the same type of
[37:47] repentance you did when you got your
[37:49] first love right amen that's what Jesus
[37:52] said do the first Works amen amen if you
[37:55] want your first love do the first Works
[37:58] amen hallelujah so for some of us what
[38:00] does that mean laying at the altar uh
[38:02] spending time with the Lord or amen
[38:04] boohoo it out like brother says right
[38:06] boohoo it out and then the Holy Ghost
[38:08] will come back on you hallelujah praise
[38:10] God Amen boohoo it out seek God
[38:13] hallelujah amen see that we've seen that
[38:16] people go from one Church they come to
[38:17] our church they blow up they leave they
[38:19] go blow up another church and blow up
[38:20] another church let's not blow up
[38:22] churches
[38:24] right let let's like uh like like that
[38:26] brother quote let's be flowers in
[38:28] churches where we just give off this
[38:30] fragrance let's not be bombs in churches
[38:33] amen like time ticking uh bombs
[38:37] right what do they call bombs in the
[38:39] military what are those uh grenades
[38:42] grenades yeah let's not be a grenade in
[38:43] the church let's be a flower and all of
[38:45] you are that's what I'm saying everybody
[38:48] I'm just talking about you know we've
[38:50] seen it we've seen where people can't
[38:52] control their emotions I've seen it amen
[38:55] hallelujah
[38:57] but you know as soon as something goes
[38:58] wrong they're like a grenade blowing up
[39:01] instead of just being like a flower
[39:03] where or like like like the Bible said
[39:05] be a doormat in the house of the Lord
[39:08] just let the person just let the person
[39:11] get all their anger just let them uh
[39:14] wipe it off on you that's okay I got the
[39:17] victory amen as a and as a as a you know
[39:21] as a pastor as a father you know over
[39:23] the years I'm talking about all over the
[39:24] years and I think God built me this way
[39:27] people can tell me some of their deepest
[39:28] problems and and and they can say harsh
[39:31] things about me and I just forget about
[39:32] I was telling my wife today we went out
[39:33] for a little date sheide the day offer I
[39:35] said whenever we were talking about this
[39:37] one person that left the church and I
[39:38] thought I thought when I told her I said
[39:40] whenever I think of that person all I
[39:41] think of his good things despite all the
[39:44] harsh things they said against me and
[39:45] did against me and and even told me you
[39:48] know all I can think of is good things
[39:51] because we we've talked about it we
[39:53] we've confessed our sins to one another
[39:55] all I can think of is good things God
[39:57] created me a clean
[39:58] heart I I look back and like wow that
[40:01] brother was really kind to
[40:03] me I forget all the other
[40:09] stuff brother brandom
[40:13] um oh well Mark 72 let's just look at
[40:17] these Pharisees again we saw how they
[40:19] didn't want God to do something
[40:21] Supernatural in jesus' life because
[40:23] their Creed disagree with it but here
[40:26] another they're always finding what's
[40:28] wrong their whole goal is to find fault
[40:31] that's what I have you know people just
[40:33] people watch our sermons just to put it
[40:36] on the accusers websites of brother
[40:37] brand I'm on there often I just watched
[40:40] I listen to one of their podcasts they
[40:41] put brother Brooks on there this week
[40:43] they put brother Samy on there they do
[40:45] that just to find fault now something
[40:47] something should check their hearts see
[40:50] if it doesn't they've got a seared
[40:52] conscience that person's probably either
[40:54] got a complex and saved or on their
[40:56] their way to hell if the Holy Ghost
[40:59] can't reveal if they can't let the Holy
[41:01] Ghost in to show them all you're doing
[41:03] is finding
[41:04] fault something is wrong with that
[41:07] person right because the Bible says we
[41:10] ought to hide the wrongs of our brothers
[41:11] and
[41:13] sisters the Bible how does that word go
[41:16] uh it's been a
[41:17] while a brother hides all the wrongs I
[41:20] have to look that up there by God's but
[41:21] let's read Mark 72 here and when they
[41:23] saw some of his disciples eat bread with
[41:25] defiled hands that is to say with
[41:26] unwashed hands they found fault there
[41:29] was nothing in the in the scriptures
[41:31] Moses had nothing about this this was
[41:33] their own Creed they created and so they
[41:36] find faults based upon their own
[41:40] Creed uh Mark
[41:42] 1213 what's that
[41:46] version Mark 1213 and they sent unto him
[41:49] certain of the Pharisees and the
[41:51] herodians to catch him in his words that
[41:53] they just they just wanted to find
[41:54] something wrong every brother says that
[41:56] if you want to find something wrong in
[41:57] the meeting you're going to find
[41:58] something wrong he said but if you want
[42:00] to find something from God you're going
[42:01] to find something from God praise God
[42:04] amen hallelujah amen
[42:06] amen
[42:08] hallelujah I want to read again where
[42:10] brother developed this critical Spirits
[42:12] from two main sermons the word became
[42:13] flesh India report
[42:15] 1954 and
[42:18] then the Jubilee year 1954 as
[42:24] wellam said Lord take that critical
[42:26] spirit from me he said I did it in my
[42:28] heart I was criticizing people he said I
[42:30] didn't say it out loud I was criticizing
[42:32] people in my
[42:33] heart brother said now I don't criticize
[42:36] people out to their face but in my heart
[42:38] I do and the church said amen I can say
[42:41] Amen to that yes I think a lot of people
[42:45] a lot of people won't say something to
[42:47] their face they'll say it in their
[42:48] hearts right right but if we're if we're
[42:52] if we're also biblical we can say that
[42:54] criticism isn't me that's the sin that
[42:56] Within Me amen so I'm not trying to eat
[42:58] anybody upse I'm just trying to say this
[43:00] is the reality of having to renew our
[43:02] minds controlling our emotions right
[43:05] brother said uh oh he said I see a lady
[43:08] walking down the street especially she's
[43:10] not dressed proper I say isn't that
[43:12] awful in my heart he said I don't say to
[43:14] anybody
[43:16] else isn't that awful isn't that awful
[43:19] and said with the right reaction would
[43:21] be that's awful I'm going to pray for
[43:23] them right just just not to be critical
[43:25] right right that's
[43:28] awful after all that's her business
[43:30] she's a free more agent she ain't got no
[43:32] right to do it Christ brought her bought
[43:34] her life but maybe she doesn't
[43:36] understand so it's not for me to
[43:38] criticize let God do it see there's
[43:41] nothing wrong with saying it's awful God
[43:43] have mercy on that person in other words
[43:45] show
[43:47] compassion right see we're all going to
[43:49] battle whatever Spirit secretly in our
[43:50] hearts right and that like I told you
[43:52] that's my prayer Lord don't let me sin
[43:54] out out the public let let just sin be
[43:56] private so I don't cause I don't I don't
[43:58] want to bring a reproach upon the Holy
[43:59] Name of Jesus Christ and I love that
[44:02] about brother BR he said the same thing
[44:03] I don't do it out loud I do it in my
[44:07] heart and here's the other one this was
[44:09] this was a very extensive quote from the
[44:12] word became flesh 54 October
[44:14] 3rd before he preaches he says I want to
[44:17] ask the church one more
[44:19] thing that you'll pray for me I've
[44:21] developed a critical spirit and it
[44:22] haunts at me so brother recognized say I
[44:26] have a complex I have a critical spirit
[44:28] and it haunts me now Church you don't
[44:30] have to raise your hand but any any of
[44:31] us who've ever had a complex you know it
[44:33] haunts you right whenever you tried you
[44:36] might have confessed your sin everything
[44:37] like that but still there's like this
[44:40] haunting the devil say you did that
[44:43] remember you did that what about that so
[44:46] we have to confess our sins right and we
[44:48] got to we got to tell the liar the
[44:50] bluffer to keep his mouth shut right we
[44:54] got to rebuke Satan say s and get behind
[44:56] me praise God Amen
[45:01] Hallelujah told his wife I said honey
[45:04] I've got to place I become critical of
[45:06] people I don't want to be that whose job
[45:09] is it to criticize it's not mine God's
[45:11] the one to criticized not
[45:14] me
[45:16] Hallelujah and then brother talks about
[45:18] how he he was critical over this woman
[45:22] missionary she was pulling for money in
[45:24] India
[45:28] and he talks about how he says he said
[45:31] every time I look at that I would
[45:33] criticize that another thing about that
[45:35] you know youve got a critical spirit or
[45:37] uh you're too angry when every time you
[45:39] see that thing you criticize it right
[45:42] and there's nothing good in it right
[45:45] that's why I appreciated you know I knew
[45:47] you know on Sunday when we went to the
[45:48] service I knew there was preachers there
[45:50] that disagree with me I knew that I was
[45:52] I was glad they come up and they at
[45:54] least shook my hand and said hi to me I
[45:56] appreciated that and I smiled right back
[45:58] and then later one other brother not the
[46:00] preacher he come up and tried to correct
[46:01] me on something he said well I heard on
[46:03] your podcast this but this so I I just
[46:06] smiled I knew I was going into a place
[46:08] where I might I might get
[46:10] criticized so I said Amen brother I said
[46:13] all right brother I said here's what I
[46:14] think I said the main thing is to make
[46:16] sure we're ready for the coming of the
[46:17] Lord that we got the baptism of the Holy
[46:19] Ghost I try to think of Dennis bride in
[46:20] that
[46:21] moment let me tell you how I think
[46:24] brother let me tell you how I see it so
[46:27] brother said he had this complex against
[46:29] a woman preacher every time he heard her
[46:31] name he just criticized criticized then
[46:33] they said the voice of healing
[46:35] magazine he said I saw this magazine and
[46:38] I began to criticize it you
[46:40] see he said but look at the poor people
[46:43] the lovely people out there following
[46:44] that going along honest hearted people
[46:48] he says I start criticizing in my heart
[46:50] I don't want to get to that way if I do
[46:53] that I will lose favor with God
[46:57] and brother B says who battle is
[47:00] it so brother is he's he's he's
[47:03] criticizing a woman preacher and every
[47:05] time he just says bad things about it
[47:07] right or just I'm sorry just crit say
[47:10] bad he criticized her he sees the voice
[47:12] of he magazine he criticizes that but
[47:14] the Holy Spirit brought to him it's not
[47:16] your battle The Battle Belongs to the
[47:18] Lord amen amen that's what helps him get
[47:20] the victory praise God Amen he said
[47:23] instead of criticizing it he said I've
[47:26] got to love them anyhow amen he said but
[47:30] now here here he says his critical
[47:32] spirit he said it was just a constant
[47:34] grind a grind and a grind my mental
[47:38] power is breaking like that and I've got
[47:40] to get away and get some rest and now he
[47:42] links this critical spirit to not
[47:43] getting enough
[47:45] rest anybody ever get ever anybody ever
[47:48] struggle with your emotions when you
[47:50] don't get enough rest oh yeah yes I do
[47:54] too well said I don't want to be
[47:56] hypocrite I want it to come from my
[47:58] heart that I really have love for those
[48:00] who are not lovely amen and the one guy
[48:03] said well I can't tell you I told him
[48:05] God bless you and I said I love you with
[48:07] the love of the Lord and I said why
[48:08] don't you write I love you with the love
[48:10] of the Lord he said why don't know if I
[48:11] love you I said the Bible said you even
[48:13] got to love your enemies right so this
[48:16] is this is the condition there they
[48:18] can't even they can't even tell me God
[48:20] bless you or I love you or I'm praying
[48:23] for
[48:24] you that that that's the blind condition
[48:26] that they're in then they get upset if I
[48:28] call them uh if I say like you you're
[48:31] being hypocritical here or you're
[48:33] slandering brother Ram they call Brother
[48:34] Ram a buffoon a liar all these wicked
[48:37] things and then they get they get mad at
[48:40] me for saying they're slandering him but
[48:42] I'm the one saying I'm and and I I said
[48:44] haven't you ever heard where I pray for
[48:46] you on the I pray for them on the
[48:48] podcast I pray for them on the videos
[48:50] and they say yeah I've heard that but
[48:52] but but whatever you know we yeah I'm
[48:56] still going to keep my critical
[48:58] spirit see it's got you have to have
[49:00] love for those who are
[49:02] lovely right what was the real proof of
[49:05] a Christian Jesus said you have love one
[49:07] for another that's the real proof of
[49:13] Christianity brother Ram says that's
[49:15] what Jesus did Jesus loved me when I
[49:17] wasn't lovely he said when I was
[49:19] critical when I needed to be criticized
[49:21] still he loves me still anyhow praise
[49:24] God Hall
[49:26] we're not so look at that whatever
[49:28] you're struggling with brother struggl
[49:29] with being critical so you realized
[49:31] Jesus could have criticized me but he
[49:32] loved me anyway amen amen hallelujah so
[49:37] that I hope that helps somebody here
[49:38] tonight by God's
[49:40] grace he said take the critical spirit
[49:43] from thy servant Lord that's that's I
[49:45] think that's every one of our prayers
[49:46] right if we got a wrong Spirit if I'm
[49:48] being angry with without an unjust then
[49:50] Lord take that angry Spirit from my
[49:52] heart help me to be like Christ but I
[49:55] can't can't say it's a sin to be angry
[49:57] it's not a sin to be
[49:59] angry as long as you don't uh sin right
[50:03] you can be angry and sin not remember
[50:06] Paul was really angry with the Galatians
[50:08] you remember that he said oh foolish
[50:10] Galatians who hath Bewitched you that
[50:14] you should turn from the truth and go
[50:16] back to the law he even said I might
[50:19] have to labor again to make sure some of
[50:21] you are born again right cuz they
[50:24] brought the law back into
[50:26] Grace and then remember he said I you
[50:28] see how I write with big letters that is
[50:31] the oldfashioned well that's the modern
[50:32] version of all caps I'm really mad at
[50:35] you so I'm typing all capital
[50:38] letters
[50:41] right one time I typed this this year I
[50:43] typed it to a parent on accident and I
[50:44] made a big mistake but I said uh your
[50:47] son did not want to do that I did not
[50:49] and she got all upset like what do you
[50:50] do yell you know she wrote back all
[50:52] these emojis and things like what you do
[50:54] yell at you is he in trouble I said no
[50:56] why do you feel that way she said you
[50:57] used all capital letters I was like oh
[51:01] sorry that's what Paul did Paul said
[51:04] don't you see I'm riding with a large
[51:06] hand I'm angry but I sin not praise God
[51:10] so I apologized I said no more all
[51:11] capital letters I just wanted her to see
[51:14] in the words that he just said I did not
[51:16] want to take this test I did not
[51:18] want uh I just wanted so I apologize for
[51:22] that I didn't mean to say anything wrong
[51:24] it was honestly honest in my
[51:26] heart brother says remember we shape
[51:29] Lord let us shape Our Lives by
[51:31] self-control amen
[51:33] amen let my life be shaped by
[51:37] controlling my emotions Amen Let Me Be A
[51:39] person who can control my emotions but
[51:41] that doesn't mean you don't get angry
[51:43] it's good to be angry against the devil
[51:46] right but you don't want to take it too
[51:48] far where you start calling him names
[51:49] like dumb devil because even Michael the
[51:51] Archangel wouldn't do that remember that
[51:53] right well gred he's a gen say A
[51:56] J right we don't see that's where it
[51:58] goes too far that's anger that's gone
[52:00] too
[52:01] far you can be angry and sin not
[52:05] remember there's seasons for emotions
[52:06] I'm not going to read it but
[52:07] Ecclesiastes 3 I never said the Tim so
[52:09] sorry um there's a time to hate and a
[52:13] time to love there's a time for anger
[52:16] right there's a time for anger there's a
[52:18] time for mourning sadness there's a time
[52:20] for dancing yes right Hallelujah I'm
[52:23] glad we have that season praise God
[52:27] remember who does anybody remember the
[52:29] church age what brother said Jesus's
[52:31] most often emotion was you just read it
[52:34] you remember it's okay you don't
[52:37] weeping weeping and mourning was Jesus's
[52:40] most often emotion Bible said he'd be a
[52:43] man of
[52:45] sorrow uh Isaiah 53 a man of sorrow
[52:48] think about that God Of Heaven comes
[52:50] down to this earth makes sense doesn't
[52:53] it it's all glory up there the logos I'm
[52:56] talking about and then that Loos comes
[52:57] to dwell in the body of Jesus no wonder
[52:59] man of sorrow he came to his own and his
[53:02] own received him
[53:04] not says it here it's in uh chapter 2
[53:08] the Patmos Vision page
[53:12] 504 of all the human emotions he
[53:14] manifested the most when he appeared as
[53:17] the son of man was this one he wept
[53:21] often so if you cry a lot don't feel bad
[53:25] you're right along with Jesus
[53:28] amen yet behind that weeping and that
[53:31] sorrow there was still God that's why
[53:34] the Bible says we must sigh and cry for
[53:36] the
[53:37] Abominations because Jesus his most
[53:40] often emotion was weeping and
[53:44] mourning Hallelujah remember we saw it
[53:46] where he wept at the grave of Lazarus
[53:48] right right remember we saw when he said
[53:51] oh Jerusalem oh Jerusalem how of I would
[53:53] have hovered over you but you would not
[53:56] right now think about that that means if
[53:58] we've accepted Christ we are right up in
[54:00] jesus' bosom today amen like a hen do
[54:04] her brood right now we don't have a hen
[54:06] yet with babies but we'll see that
[54:07] pretty soon maybe Lord right have a mama
[54:11] H and maybe we can hatch some maybe more
[54:13] willingness NE this year maybe by God's
[54:15] grace but just H just just hover right
[54:18] up to it and show it some uh show it
[54:21] some warmth praise God right Jesus cried
[54:24] because they wouldn't they wouldn't come
[54:25] up to him and receive his love he cried
[54:28] and
[54:30] wept
[54:33] Hallelujah I'm going try to bring that
[54:35] this down to the close here by God's
[54:38] grace remember he also had Thanksgiving
[54:41] he also had uh good emotions uh Matthew
[54:45] 11:25 you got your at that time Jesus
[54:48] answered and said I thank thee oh Father
[54:50] Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou
[54:51] hid these things from the wise and
[54:53] prudent and has revealed them unto even
[54:55] so father for it seem good in thy
[55:00] sight all things are delivered unto me
[55:02] of my father no man knoweth the son but
[55:04] the father neither knoweth any man the
[55:06] father save the son and to he whomsoever
[55:08] the son will reveal
[55:10] him now I just had this thought one of
[55:12] the girls asked a good question remember
[55:14] about are we going to cry over our the
[55:16] lost loved ones that's an excellent
[55:20] question of course I think we
[55:23] will but once the tears are wiped away I
[55:26] believe we'll have a greater revelation
[55:28] of Romans chapter 9 which we're coming
[55:30] up on where Paul pulls back and he says
[55:33] Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated he
[55:35] said some of you are vessels unto honor
[55:38] that's you
[55:39] guys amen and that's what the qu
[55:42] question was from our little little
[55:44] sister who I'm looking at right
[55:46] now this is what we'll see once we're in
[55:48] heaven we'll realize God made Vessels
[55:52] with this for Nows God made Vessels that
[55:54] were made to to last and then but God
[55:56] also made Vessels that were not made to
[55:59] last and that that that was the
[56:02] ultimate illustration Paul could give us
[56:05] some are vessels of Honor you keep them
[56:09] others are vessels of Dishonor and
[56:12] church that's why Jesus can thank God
[56:15] pull back up 25 think about this how
[56:17] could he thank God that the Pharisees
[56:19] weren't receiving the
[56:21] Revelation it had to be because of for
[56:24] knowledge he had to know there they just
[56:26] weren't called to
[56:28] it but I also believe one reason he was
[56:31] thankful he said at least somebody's
[56:33] receiving this message amen hallelujah
[56:35] it's not a big crowd but the elect
[56:37] always receed God's word hallelujah amen
[56:40] he said fear not little flock it's your
[56:42] father's Good Will to give you the
[56:44] Rapture praise
[56:45] God Amen so Jesus experienced
[56:50] anger he exper here experienced
[56:52] thankfulness thank God somebody will
[56:54] receive the message thank God we got a
[56:56] message Church in a praise God Amen do
[56:58] you remember that Steve Alexander come
[57:00] here and said he said for 10 years or 15
[57:02] years he said I pray for God to raise up
[57:03] a message Church in akan by
[57:07] name and then look who God sent here
[57:10] across the oceans and your your family
[57:12] across the oceans right the Yang family
[57:14] literally came across the oceans from LA
[57:17] right hallelujah amen and that man by
[57:22] name said God raise up a message Church
[57:25] in akan and God answered his prayer
[57:27] that's why I always respect that man
[57:29] hallelujah amen I don't understand
[57:31] everything about his life but I sure
[57:32] respect that because he kept praying he
[57:34] wanted to have a message church so his
[57:36] family could come to the church I think
[57:38] he came once or twice that man Daniel
[57:40] was the man's name I'm coming to me now
[57:42] he came a couple times and heard me
[57:44] preach I disagree with you here here I
[57:46] said show me where I'm wrong he never
[57:47] email me back that's what happens most
[57:49] often they that they can't break the
[57:52] word of God right you can't defeat the
[57:54] word of God right or just not worth my
[57:56] time but here Jesus now
[57:59] experiences Thanksgiving but go back up
[58:02] to verse 20 look look at his roller
[58:04] coaster of
[58:06] emotions now church I this is how I feel
[58:08] when I'm preaching sometimes I'm happy
[58:10] as I'm joyful as going to be and then in
[58:12] a few minutes we'll be
[58:13] crying
[58:15] right we'll be crying and pretty soon
[58:17] we'll be shouting and rejoicing we just
[58:20] go through this emotional roller coaster
[58:22] that's what Jesus went through but it's
[58:24] okay as long as it's God taking you on
[58:26] that trip Hallelujah God's using your
[58:29] emotions here Jesus began to upgrade the
[58:33] cities so uaid means to sternly rebuke
[58:36] let me look up the actual word there I
[58:38] thought that's what it
[58:43] was listen to this
[58:45] here he goes from uprating to
[58:48] Thanksgiving so uprate is to revile I've
[58:52] had people tell me that brother just you
[58:53] revile me they were CRI me I said well
[58:55] maybe it was
[58:56] God sometimes God does that Jesus did
[58:59] that I don't know if we ever got down to
[59:01] the heart of it but it means to
[59:05] cast uh rebuke in one's
[59:09] teeth right Jesus uh Jesus upgraded his
[59:13] disciples right for the resurrection
[59:14] said why didn't you believe those
[59:16] women he said oh fools slow of heart
[59:19] that's an
[59:21] uprade God calling you a fool to your
[59:23] face yeah
[59:25] and church we all are sometimes
[59:28] right let's not act like we're not if we
[59:30] choose to go into sin if we choose well
[59:32] we we were foolish in that moment that
[59:34] doesn't mean that's the real part of God
[59:36] in our lives that's just our sin right
[59:38] that's our Humanity we repent get out of
[59:41] that but Jesus goes from rebuking right
[59:43] in their teeth you should have received
[59:45] it woe to you tasan woe to you uh just
[59:48] rebukes them over and over again and
[59:50] then he says I thank God that that the
[59:52] wise and The Prudent have missed it I
[59:54] thank God here reveal it to the bride
[59:55] hallelujah amen look at the
[59:59] emotions rebuke rebuke woe to you and
[1:00:02] then he say thank you
[1:00:05] Lord I like the roller coaster of
[1:00:07] emotions God puts us through don't you
[1:00:10] like how many like to feel God's
[1:00:13] emotions one of the worst things is not
[1:00:15] feel any emotions there there's a
[1:00:17] condition for that where you can't feel
[1:00:19] any emotion that's kind of like
[1:00:20] depression you can't feel it you can't
[1:00:22] feel anything other than just sadness
[1:00:23] all the time at least we did have some
[1:00:26] uh some change of emotion thank God for
[1:00:28] that amen so Jesus goes from
[1:00:32] upgrading to Thanksgiving amen go to
[1:00:36] Luke
[1:00:37] 10117 I'm almost
[1:00:48] done so I think I'll I'll preach this
[1:00:51] and then I'll share brother br's
[1:00:52] greatest emotional battle that he told
[1:00:54] us and then I'll share my greatest
[1:00:55] emotional battle since I came in the
[1:00:59] message so it might help
[1:01:05] you Luke 10:17 the 70 returned again
[1:01:08] with Joy saying Lord even the devils are
[1:01:09] subject unto us through thy
[1:01:12] name now look at verse 20 not
[1:01:15] withstanding in this Rejoice not that
[1:01:16] the spirits are subject unto you now
[1:01:18] look at that you would think Jesus would
[1:01:21] be happy for them that they could cast
[1:01:23] out Devils wouldn't you think
[1:01:26] if we s our little ones out and they
[1:01:27] come back rejoice and we cast out Devils
[1:01:29] you would think oh yeah let's Rejoice
[1:01:32] she said don't rejoice in
[1:01:36] that he says but Rejoice because your
[1:01:38] names are in heaven other words don't
[1:01:41] rejoice in temporary giftings right
[1:01:44] because gifts are all temporary we see
[1:01:45] through a glass Darkly right yeah but
[1:01:47] then we'll see him face to face rejoice
[1:01:49] in the face to face Hallelujah rejoice
[1:01:52] in the promise of eternal life praise
[1:01:53] God amen and Jesus mod that that's what
[1:01:56] the brother preached that really blessed
[1:01:58] me uh it's in Mark after after Jesus
[1:02:02] healed all the sick and The Afflicted
[1:02:03] the Bible said he rose up a great while
[1:02:05] before day and went out to pray to the
[1:02:06] heavenly father because even he knew the
[1:02:10] joy of Miracles will eventually wear off
[1:02:12] and I might get prideful lifted up I
[1:02:13] have to have fellowship with the
[1:02:15] heavenly
[1:02:16] father just like here don't Rejoice so
[1:02:19] much for miracles and casting out Devils
[1:02:22] Rejoice because you know God has
[1:02:23] accepted you Heaven amen right there's a
[1:02:26] name written in glory and it's ours amen
[1:02:29] hallelujah rejoice in
[1:02:32] that Jesus rejoiced and look he rejoices
[1:02:35] right after correcting his
[1:02:37] disciples don't Rejoice he didn't join
[1:02:40] in yeah let's have a party let's let's
[1:02:43] Rejoice no he said rejoice in this turn
[1:02:47] turn your turn your uh Rejoice from away
[1:02:49] from gifts and put it on eternal life
[1:02:53] Hallelujah get it all the temporary and
[1:02:55] get it on the Eternal praise God amen
[1:02:58] amen and then in that hour verse 21
[1:03:01] Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I
[1:03:03] thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and
[1:03:04] Earth that thou has hid these things
[1:03:06] from the wise and prudent and reveal
[1:03:07] them un babes even so father for seeing
[1:03:10] good in th sight in other words I
[1:03:11] Rejoice because the father has done his
[1:03:15] will the father has called them I
[1:03:17] Rejoice because the father Reveals His
[1:03:19] word to whomsoever he desires amen he
[1:03:22] reveals them to all the friends of God
[1:03:24] God the children of God hallelujah and I
[1:03:27] am a friend of God hallelujah he calls
[1:03:29] me friend
[1:03:31] Hallelujah so Jesus was
[1:03:33] angry
[1:03:36] here hallelujah and then he was sad
[1:03:40] weeping upright he rebukes them to their
[1:03:43] teeth right rebukes them to their
[1:03:47] face and here he rejoices he corrects
[1:03:50] their rejoicing and says I rejoice in
[1:03:52] this rejoice in
[1:03:56] life hallelujah
[1:04:00] amen so brother's greatest battle he
[1:04:03] tells us and is your life worth of the
[1:04:05] Gospel 1963 it was when his first wife
[1:04:08] hope had died and God was taking home
[1:04:11] Sharon
[1:04:13] Rose he said I sat all night long and I
[1:04:16] said to god what have I done show me
[1:04:18] Lord don't let the innocent have to
[1:04:19] suffer for me if I've done wrong I
[1:04:21] didn't know he was testing me
[1:04:26] but every son that comes to God has to
[1:04:27] be tried the church said
[1:04:35] amen but said Lord tell me what I've
[1:04:37] done I'll make it right what have I done
[1:04:38] but preach all day all night long and
[1:04:40] give just given my life constantly what
[1:04:42] have I done Satan said that's
[1:04:44] right so he brother's praying to God
[1:04:47] I've given you everything can't you heal
[1:04:49] my daughter and say says that's
[1:04:52] right he you see now when it comes to
[1:04:55] you you've told all of them that you
[1:04:58] believe that he's a Healer and there
[1:04:59] lays your baby ly there dying he refused
[1:05:01] to even hear your wife died with
[1:05:03] tuberculosis pneumonia you said he could
[1:05:05] heal Cancers and there he is now you
[1:05:09] talk about him being good this is Satan
[1:05:10] talking and how good he is to people
[1:05:12] what about you that's what this devil
[1:05:14] says you've seen all these people heal
[1:05:16] now what about you why isn't he good to
[1:05:17] you right see remember his hardest
[1:05:20] battle in Life Church what does that
[1:05:22] tell us the loss of our loved ones and
[1:05:24] friends can be the hardest battles we
[1:05:27] ever face in life because the devil will
[1:05:29] say well you you you got all these
[1:05:31] testimonies God did all the things why
[1:05:33] didn't he do it for
[1:05:34] you brother actually agreed with the
[1:05:36] devil you're right God could heal God
[1:05:38] God
[1:05:41] could but said then I began to listen to
[1:05:44] him speaking of Satan that's reasoning I
[1:05:46] thought that's right sorry to get upset
[1:05:49] with
[1:05:52] God said he can tell you don't have to
[1:05:54] speak the word just look at your baby
[1:05:56] and it would live I said that's right so
[1:05:59] he agreed with Satan
[1:06:01] twice Satan says much as you've done for
[1:06:04] him and yet that's what he does for you
[1:06:06] I said that's right agree with him three
[1:06:09] times I begin to think well what see
[1:06:13] everything begin to break away when it
[1:06:15] comes to the
[1:06:16] reasonings but when it comes to that he
[1:06:18] said it hung there so brother said I
[1:06:20] lost all my emotions in my mind my mind
[1:06:22] was just lost okay you're right devil
[1:06:24] you're right you're right you're right
[1:06:25] he said but when all this broke away
[1:06:27] there was an anchor that held me right
[1:06:30] there there's an anchor in the soul
[1:06:32] praise God when everything seems right
[1:06:34] yes God could have done it he shouldn't
[1:06:35] have done it maybe I felt like i' I've
[1:06:37] done all this why can't you do it for me
[1:06:39] when all that breaks away and it all
[1:06:40] seems like something's wrong here the
[1:06:43] Bible brother says God's truth will hang
[1:06:46] right there in your soul hallelujah amen
[1:06:48] amen
[1:06:52] amen hallelujah
[1:06:55] he says when all the reising powers have
[1:06:57] broken away then it came to that eternal
[1:06:59] life that new birth he said what if it
[1:07:02] hadn't been there brother R would have
[1:07:03] left preaching he never would have
[1:07:05] preached the seals or marriage and
[1:07:06] divorce or anything like
[1:07:08] that what if it hadn't have been there
[1:07:11] we wouldn't have known one another the
[1:07:13] way we do now this church would have
[1:07:15] been here like this the Thousand
[1:07:16] Millions around the world I'm sorry the
[1:07:18] church would not have been here like
[1:07:19] this but thank God it was there praise
[1:07:21] God hallelujah thank God it was there he
[1:07:24] says then I thought what who am I anyhow
[1:07:28] who am I to question his majesty
[1:07:31] amen who am I have question the Creator
[1:07:33] that gave me the very life here on Earth
[1:07:36] where did I get that baby who give it to
[1:07:38] me not mine anyhow he just loaned her to
[1:07:41] me for a while I said Satan get away

[1:07:46] baby I said God bless you sweetheart in
[1:07:47] a minute daddy will take you down put
[1:07:49] you on mommy's arms the angels will pack
[1:07:51] you your little soulway and I'll meet

[1:07:59] love you I believe you if you send me to
[1:08:01] hell I love you anyhow I can't get away
[1:08:03] from that there you are he said when the
[1:08:05] intellectual all broke away you've got
[1:08:07] to have a personal relationship you've
[1:08:09] got to be born again hallelujah amen
[1:08:12] hallelujah all the emotions I've lost my
[1:08:15] wife I've lost this and agreeing with
[1:08:17] the devil and all these things but thank
[1:08:18] God The Anchor Holds within the veil
[1:08:22] hallelujah amen thank God
[1:08:24] amen he said that was his greatest
[1:08:26] moment of trial
[1:08:27] testing and what if he would have failed
[1:08:30] well see God put something in there so
[1:08:31] you won't
[1:08:33] fail thank God hallelujah amen he put
[1:08:36] something inside of us it was the Holy
[1:08:39] Ghost that that was his anchor praise
[1:08:41] God the soul it was a jean seed of God
[1:08:44] hallelujah amen the part of God that
[1:08:47] couldn't sin that couldn't disbelieve
[1:08:49] That Couldn't reason or agree with the
[1:08:51] devil Hallelujah the spirit of God
[1:08:53] hallelujah God own life and brother Soul
[1:08:55] hallelujah
[1:08:57] amen let me just share this I'm going to
[1:08:59] share this
[1:09:00] here my biggest trial since coming to
[1:09:03] the message was a couple years ago when
[1:09:05] I had two friends that left the message
[1:09:08] preachers that I preached for one of
[1:09:11] them I I I I basically led into the
[1:09:14] message and one night my wife remembers
[1:09:17] this too we because we talk about today
[1:09:19] about that's I fresh in my mind the
[1:09:22] brother said he was down from North
[1:09:24] you know who I'm talking about right he
[1:09:26] sent me this list of all these apparent
[1:09:28] false prophecies of brother Brandon and
[1:09:31] church that night it shook me to the
[1:09:35] core because I thought and you know you
[1:09:37] know the verse they used it was
[1:09:38] Deuteronomy
[1:09:40] 18 if a prophet says something in the
[1:09:42] name of the Lord and doesn't come to
[1:09:43] pass don't hear
[1:09:45] him now that's
[1:09:47] right but that's not all the
[1:09:50] scripture
[1:09:52] Hallelujah and that my wife said I she
[1:09:55] just she I was just struggling with that
[1:09:57] I told her about it she said she had to
[1:09:58] go downstairs and pray for
[1:10:01] me
[1:10:03] Hallelujah that was just about maybe 201
[1:10:06] 13 14 15 I can't remember no it would
[1:10:08] have been it would have been no it would
[1:10:10] have been after that because I I
[1:10:11] preached down there in 2017 it's either
[1:10:13] 2020 if I'm not
[1:10:15] mistaken and chch what I found is that
[1:10:17] the enemy keeps coming in with the flood
[1:10:20] right the deceptions get more and more
[1:10:22] intense mhm
[1:10:24] but my wife said I woke up a different
[1:10:25] person the next day CU I went and read
[1:10:28] my Bible and the church
[1:10:32] said if you take Deuteronomy 18 just
[1:10:35] face value then Jonah was a false
[1:10:38] prophet because Jonah said God's going
[1:10:40] to destroy this place in 40 days he
[1:10:42] didn't say if he said he's destroying it
[1:10:44] in 40 days that's
[1:10:47] right if you just take that at face
[1:10:49] value Jonah was a false prophet right
[1:10:53] the second most obvious one is that God
[1:10:55] told Elijah you'll do three
[1:10:58] things let's read it first Kings 19 this
[1:11:00] one really set me to shouting praise God
[1:11:03] and brother Loris was the one who told
[1:11:04] me about this God bless our precious I
[1:11:06] just mean it's it's it's interesting how
[1:11:08] God brought it through brother Loris
[1:11:10] when brother Loris doesn't leave the
[1:11:11] message anymore God bless his heart if
[1:11:13] he's listening I doubt it but love you
[1:11:14] brother and love you and Karen and so
[1:11:16] forth But First Kings 19:15 and the Lord
[1:11:19] said Toto him go return on the way to
[1:11:21] the Wilderness of Damascus and when thou
[1:11:23] comest anoint hael to be king over Syria
[1:11:26] and juu the son of nimi shalt thou
[1:11:27] anoint to be king over Israel and Elisha
[1:11:30] the son of Shea of Abel molah shalt thou
[1:11:33] anoint to be a prophet in thy room and
[1:11:35] it should come to pass that him that
[1:11:39] escapethe the sword of juu shall Elisha
[1:11:42] slay so God told Elijah imagine me tell
[1:11:45] Malachi thus sayith the Lord You're
[1:11:46] Going to anoint these three people he
[1:11:48] only anointed one of them and even he
[1:11:51] wasn't even there when Elisha got
[1:11:54] anointed right now what about
[1:11:58] that see Elijah going to said thus
[1:12:00] sayith the Lord I'm anointed haziel juu
[1:12:04] and Elisha God told me thus sayith the
[1:12:08] Lord
[1:12:10] okay but really when he left his mantle
[1:12:13] came down and that's the anointing that
[1:12:15] fell on
[1:12:17] Elisha Elisha anointed king
[1:12:20] haziel and then a son of a prophet
[1:12:22] anointed J King in 2 Kings
[1:12:26] 9 Hallelujah and the church said amen
[1:12:31] amen and so going back to the scripture
[1:12:33] oh yeah and then Isaiah Isaiah said thus
[1:12:36] sayth the Lord Hezekiah set your house
[1:12:38] in order you're going to die well he
[1:12:41] didn't die right Isaiah is a false
[1:12:44] prophet no sir
[1:12:48] right as Jesus said it is also
[1:12:51] written amen there's the answer right
[1:12:53] there it is also written hallelujah amen
[1:12:57] amen in other words there's other
[1:12:59] scriptures too where God can interpret
[1:13:01] the the prophecy however he wants to
[1:13:04] interpret it praise
[1:13:06] God hallelujah and then in each case I
[1:13:09] went through every one of those on the
[1:13:10] on the text the brother sent me the text
[1:13:12] I went through every one of those false
[1:13:14] prophecies and I found out how they were
[1:13:17] fulfilled Hallelujah then I found out
[1:13:20] even prophets and kings and they can
[1:13:22] disobey thus say the Lord and still be
[1:13:25] prophets of God right yes right remember
[1:13:28] I preached on that with the kids in the
[1:13:30] Bible study I showed 10
[1:13:32] examples and that's where the
[1:13:34] conversation that's where all the
[1:13:35] friendliness ended I sent I sent that
[1:13:37] video I said I said my dear precious
[1:13:41] brother I said you're just off the word
[1:13:44] I said you know I just wrote a text I
[1:13:46] said you're off the word here's 10
[1:13:48] examples and now it's been crickets for
[1:13:50] three or four years now see because they
[1:13:52] can't overcome the word of God if you
[1:13:55] got you condemn brother BR about the
[1:13:56] brown bear you got to condemn Abraham
[1:13:59] about not SE separating himself from his
[1:14:01] Kindred he disobeyed thus sayith the
[1:14:03] Lord the vision of the
[1:14:05] Lord
[1:14:07] hallelujah so in my greatest moment what
[1:14:10] was it a wife that would pray for me my
[1:14:12] greatest moment of testing and trials
[1:14:14] hallelujah what is it brother it's God
[1:14:17] leading me I got to go open my bible I
[1:14:20] got to search for more and notice with
[1:14:22] that Satan only used one verse but the
[1:14:24] Bible said amen let every word be
[1:14:26] established in the mouth of two or three
[1:14:28] Witnesses
[1:14:30] Hallelujah my emotions were all torn up
[1:14:33] oh my goodness is he a false
[1:14:35] prophet struggles might come in the
[1:14:37] night but joy comes in the morning
[1:14:39] praise God hallelujah praise God church
[1:14:43] we might have no doubt we might have
[1:14:45] harder battles
[1:14:46] ahead but we have to trust we have to
[1:14:48] really make sure we are born again when
[1:14:51] those great moments of testing come when
[1:14:53] your emotions feel like all my emotions
[1:14:55] broke away I was just about ready to
[1:14:56] give up and say well if he won't heal my
[1:14:58] child then I won't serve him now my test
[1:15:02] was I wouldn't you know my test was I I
[1:15:04] wouldn't believe brother ad was a
[1:15:05] prophet anymore I still served God see
[1:15:07] we each have our own certain
[1:15:09] test but every time The Anchor Holds
[1:15:12] within the
[1:15:14] veil did the bible say that he keeps me
[1:15:17] from
[1:15:20] falling and that's going to be my last
[1:15:22] verse if I can just find
[1:15:23] keep from
[1:15:28] Fall Jude 1:24 let's read that put it
[1:15:31] there let's stand our feet musicians can
[1:15:32] come

[1:15:37] had an anchor in the
[1:15:39] soul he said I would have fallen he said
[1:15:42] but thank God the anchor was
[1:15:45] there I lost all my emotion everything

[1:16:47] three times and said I don't even know
[1:16:49] Jesus I don't know him I don't know him
[1:16:53] but he didn't fall because Jesus prayed

[1:17:16] hallelujah a friend that Stith closer
[1:17:19] closer than a brother hallelujah amen

[1:17:29] to jail but what held him the prayer of
[1:17:32] Jesus Christ the intercession of the
[1:17:34] high priest Hallelujah and think about
[1:17:36] that just within a few minutes Jesus
[1:17:38] would say pray with me and they would
[1:17:40] turn him down and fall asleep he prayed
[1:17:43] to save him but they wouldn't pray to
[1:17:45] save him yet he still loved them I love
