[11:22] because i think this leading the elbow
[11:24] and I think that guy's a tell what are
[11:25] we going to do everything is just a
[11:27] naked state of confusion almost like an

[11:39] candidate a third party real fast I
[11:41] don't know how see they're all it's all

[25:50] stomach number one here number 100
[25:54] according to lifeway research which I
[25:56] believe the Christian thing or something
[25:59] forty-six percent of all Americans never
[26:01] even think about whether they go to
[26:03] heaven or not after people could care
[26:07] less and that's the absolute truth yeah
[26:11] anyone has ever talked to just just talk
[26:13] to people when you're out about just
[26:15] strike a conversation with someone and
[26:16] you just hit a little bit about Jesus
[26:18] Christ Islamic and you see what they say
[26:21] no one cares about this don't even cares
[26:25] about Jesus Christ are many more it's
[26:27] embarrassing second 7312 he says yay and
[26:31] all that live godly in Jesus Christ
[26:33] shall suffer persecution he says he says
[26:36] but evil men and seducers shall wax
[26:38] worse he says and where she's a
[26:41] deceiving and being a seat yeah
[26:44] absolutely this is the type this is the
[26:47] age the greatest deception is not
[26:49] absolute trust her second the saloons to
[26:52] Greece's let no man deceive you by any
[26:54] means that for that day shall not come
[26:56] except there be a lot of falling away
[26:59] first and the man of sin be revealed the
[27:02] son of perdition so before the
[27:03] Antichrist steps up the son of man is
[27:05] that a man ups and the son of perdition
[27:07] one that we are falling away then he'll
[27:10] appear chalk that's right I know simple
[27:13] short now in the ad Abrahamic covenant
[27:20] in Genesis 15 God makes a little
[27:24] covenant with Abraham okay and let me
[27:27] read this year he's
[27:29] in verse 8 Genesis 15 verse 8 he says
[27:31] and the Lord God where I shall I know
[27:33] that I shuffle inherited he said to him
[27:35] take me a hacker of three years old and
[27:37] a she-goat of three years old and around
[27:39] three years old that rolled up in a
[27:40] young pigeon and he took all the all
[27:42] these under him and divided them in the
[27:43] midst of ladies piece one against
[27:45] another but the birds dividing to eat
[27:47] not okay he says he says the bowels came
[27:50] down upon the carcasses and Abraham had
[27:52] to drive 80 keys and drove away after
[27:55] dollars cheaper keeping your sacrifice
[27:57] clean absolutely keeping your mind and
[27:59] clean all these things like this since
[28:01] out of the air who he's dead carcass
[28:03] will carry on right yeah maybe also this
[28:05] a rotting flesh what everybody vultures
[28:08] but evil unclean birds sure he says and
[28:12] when the Sun was going down look he says
[28:14] and a deep sleep fell upon Abram and lo
[28:17] a hold of great darkness fell upon God
[28:21] what allowed him to what never this is
[28:23] all shadows and type short estimates by
[28:25] Sheldon type this is what Abraham
[28:27] getting a change of death the rim said
[28:33] he said these are these and he says and
[28:34] this in this portion scripts recent
[28:36] piece of Abraham ending calories that
[28:38] he's covered death encountered hell
[28:41] foreshadowing exactly what we have to go
[28:44] through would he be saying short because
[28:46] what God may encompass but what he had
[28:48] to taste both need to go to a boat right
[28:52] he says nah boo Genesis 15 17 and it
[28:57] came to pass when the Sun went down and
[28:59] it was dark he hold off smoking and
[29:01] furniture makes a decent that was hell
[29:02] he says in a burning lamp passed between
[29:05] those pieces what the pillar fire shown
[29:07] to what he that God Himself was going to
[29:10] make this come at work and he Abraham
[29:12] was going to pass through it only God
[29:14] himself right the pillar of I sure man
[29:17] he said but look he said he had to taste
[29:18] death and he had to go to help but God
[29:21] would keep his covenant with him sure
[29:23] now we all know we know these things
[29:25] being in the message for so long but in
[29:28] hell there was two places in hell
[29:29] correct we know what Samuel would summon
[29:33] saw and Paxton so bad to God the Bible's
[29:35] of the ureter won't even speech from
[29:37] right there God he wasn't talked to Saul
[29:41] or nothing like
[29:41] and one time they're the battles of
[29:43] upright the end of Saul's life force but
[29:46] saw he's inviting a which totally banned
[29:49] from Israel kilvo whatever but since
[29:51] it's all said he's not kidding fighting
[29:53] then they bother him one what in the
[29:55] witch of endor sure and they went
[29:57] towards she was doing a little spells
[29:59] whatever and she said who do you want me
[30:00] to call off she said he said caught up
[30:02] Sam right the Prophet she called him up
[30:05] and then she called that spirit up
[30:08] everything in her she was opened her
[30:10] eyes were open realize that was saw real
[30:12] that was Samuel all these things right
[30:14] so we know that what at that time there
[30:17] was what hell and there was what we call
[30:18] paradise and we learn more through
[30:22] Christ's ministry that whatever the rich
[30:24] man and Lazarus right the Richmond of a
[30:27] blessed and everything he did an average
[30:29] here like to eating it toned off potato
[30:31] right and the Bible says that Lazarus
[30:33] went to Paradise which would Abraham
[30:36] right and then what the rich man found
[30:39] his hot looked up from hell look his
[30:41] eyes up from hell sure and then now
[30:43] they're converging Abraham and is this
[30:45] rich man and the Bible says that weather
[30:47] was the the Abraham said there was a
[30:49] gulf fixed between both of them they
[30:52] could never go right one was a holding
[30:54] place the other one was Hell itself a
[30:56] place of torture torment not necessarily
[30:59] flames was just format right okay so we
[31:03] know these we know these things there
[31:05] was two places okay that's why Jesus on
[31:07] the cross was the thief on the rise said
[31:09] he said remember me when you're in
[31:11] paradise he's in the Jesus that you'll
[31:13] be with me in paradise today but they
[31:15] talking about heaven no that was talking
[31:17] about paradise down there the place that
[31:19] what because remember in the Old
[31:22] Testament we had what blood of bulls and
[31:24] goats Frank she those things right and
[31:27] the Bible says that that blood we know
[31:30] from the blood would cover their scent
[31:32] they take that blood on the altar and
[31:34] symbolically that covered their sin so
[31:37] what judgment could not they cannot go
[31:38] to help but standing at the end of their
[31:40] life say if you could take his hands
[31:42] like this and the altar strut it out and
[31:44] look there's still Sydney he's mine he
[31:49] fell by x minus you I own him that's my
[31:52] that's why when Moses died Satan was
[31:55] there
[31:55] to dispute about the body of Moses
[31:57] because when he can take that blood that
[31:59] great pop-up said look he's still sin
[32:01] he's still mine I still old I still own
[32:04] that sure and then what Satan changing
[32:08] would take east of all but because there
[32:09] was a blood on that you could not take
[32:11] it to hell he had to put it in put it
[32:15] right there why did he lapped it up sure
[32:17] now let's go to this year in Ephesians 4
[32:24] 9 he says and now that he ascended what
[32:27] is it but that he has descended also our
[32:30] first into the lower parts of the earth
[32:32] what member Christ died he went to the
[32:34] lower parts here and then look he said
[32:37] that he descended the same as he also
[32:39] that us and Farah bro actually was hurt
[32:42] I'm sorry fusions 48 I'm sorry wherefore
[32:45] he's Satan nepali he says when he has
[32:47] set it up on high he led captivity
[32:49] captive all right we know these things
[32:52] through this review hey he's like
[32:53] captivity captive God without jeans
[32:55] price went down he was saying right he
[32:57] goes to the prison house door he takes
[32:59] but what he had to do first he had to go
[33:02] and need st. in right and prove that he
[33:04] was the son of God manifesting his blaze
[33:06] that my blood is still fresh on the
[33:08] cloth cross fell down onto the onto the
[33:11] earth the earth drank it up right and
[33:13] now the earth is was sanctified sure but
[33:16] then he had to go to Satan and take the
[33:18] keys of death Ellen a great chori doctor
[33:22] to Isaiah 14 will show you that he had
[33:25] the keys because here is God speaking
[33:29] through a prophet here as am 14 verse 12
[33:39] he says how art thou fallen from heaven
[33:41] o Lucifer son of the morning how is our
[33:43] cuts down to the ground would weaken the
[33:45] nation's for now I said and I ha reason
[33:47] I will ascend to heaven I was off my
[33:49] throne above the stars of God I was sit
[33:51] upon the mount the congregation in the
[33:52] sides of the door he said I was sent
[33:54] above the heights of the clouds he's now
[33:56] be like the Most High God here God is
[33:58] destroying what Satan heart he says yea
[34:00] thou shalt be brought down to hell to
[34:03] the sides of the pit he says he says
[34:06] they needn't look upon me nearly shall
[34:08] look upon D
[34:09] consider these say is this the banda
[34:11] ain't your trouble that has shaken the
[34:13] date the kingdom he says they have made
[34:15] the world of wilderness and destroyed
[34:17] the sinir cities thereof that over did
[34:20] not the house of the prisoners look
[34:24] Satan could have released him and they
[34:26] could've went to heaven sure but he took
[34:27] claims on him because they were four
[34:29] cents to their sin was still there he
[34:31] had the king sure and God judges them
[34:34] for you could have released a linkage
[34:36] has been with me for sure is a reason
[34:38] but you won't ever release them you had
[34:40] the key that that's why Jesus cries and
[34:42] to come down and get the keys released
[34:44] right surely it is that simple yeah
[34:47] absolutely now it's Psalms in solves 9
[34:54] verse 17 he says the wicked shall be
[34:57] burned into hell and all nations that
[35:01] forget god therefore how has a larger
[35:05] self Isaiah 514 hell has enlarged
[35:08] yourself and open her mouth without
[35:10] measure and their glory and their must
[35:12] earn their party he joins two shall
[35:14] descend into it so here is what
[35:16] everything is brought revolving around
[35:17] hell here it's like it's like I'll say
[35:20] like this but let me blow your back up
[35:23] here now the Prophet had two visions the
[35:28] crop and two visions one when he was a
[35:30] young boy 14 years old especially since
[35:33] 14 and the other one was filled in 54 he
[35:37] said exactly 40 years apart 40 years is
[35:39] what temptation a year of temptation so
[35:44] he had got shot by one of the strengths
[35:46] of hunting and go to his leg off and now
[35:48] he was or having parts of his legs off
[35:51] there and he was laying there he said he
[35:53] would be he go hand out of consciousness
[35:54] that day he said he woke up one night
[35:57] and just felt like there's water all
[35:58] over he looked out he said there had to
[35:59] be a half gallon of blood laying right
[36:01] honor you today like a rubber rubber
[36:03] sheet and he's laying in that and
[36:04] discovered in his own blood and he rang
[36:06] the thing the nurse came over and
[36:07] stopped it up and whatever and he said
[36:11] he said the next morning there into a
[36:12] surgery and they put him under ether and
[36:15] he was under there for like a hour they
[36:17] didn't know he was gonna come out of I
[36:19] gained so much as he was coming out or
[36:22] some
[36:22] around there he says he said he said he
[36:24] went into a vision he said he was
[36:26] falling he said continually falling he
[36:29] said he went from the clouds he said
[36:30] falling from cut through cloud and then
[36:32] he went into darkness and then he's like
[36:34] he said he said it was like I was never
[36:36] going to hit bottom he's just
[36:37] continually fail he said he says and the
[36:39] feeling though Audie said was
[36:41] unbelievable if you ever get on YouTube
[36:43] watch 23 minutes in hell the guy said
[36:46] God took him down to the hell he allowed
[36:48] her to die or whatever they say he took
[36:50] him down to hell he said I was insane
[36:52] with the money after 23 minutes of hell
[36:56] and he gives it a count of everything
[36:57] down there he is total and sandy
[37:00] tortured wicked stuff he said when he
[37:04] came to his wife was shaking him and he
[37:07] said he just screamed for hours because
[37:09] he was still insane it took it he said
[37:12] it took him two years to recover from
[37:14] that Korean actually function normal 23
[37:18] minutes down here the problem is finding
[37:22] himself now falling he says he funny of
[37:25] the place he says the regions of the law
[37:26] he says the regions of the Damned and
[37:28] now he's and now he's he's like he said
[37:32] he said he said as he was falling he
[37:33] said he said he cried out for daddy
[37:35] daddy where a says this is the new room
[37:37] daddy there he said his crying out for
[37:39] mommy says by the way and he said he
[37:41] said there's no mama de that even he
[37:42] cried out for God's that there's no God
[37:44] there he finds himself lost and then he
[37:49] said these women come up he says green
[37:54] all under their eyes oh ok Creed he said
[37:58] just could hardly move just he said it
[38:00] was horrible he said he said he said if
[38:02] you do anything he says make sure you
[38:04] never know that yeah he said there's
[38:07] just even one in Sedona he said you want
[38:09] to wish it for anything wishing for
[38:11] anybody nothing he says keep it trying
[38:14] with every song again so now 40 years
[38:20] later 19 or he was 54 years old right
[38:24] now he says and now he's walking with
[38:27] his wife in 1963 he says so I went
[38:30] upstairs and sat down he says and there
[38:32] was a little escalator he says there was
[38:34] a JC
[38:34] penn's store he said he says the Alaska
[38:38] later was bringing people he says office
[38:40] is down well I surely he says this is
[38:42] why I was right because he was looking
[38:44] at these women walking around he said
[38:46] the shorts young and all just the plain
[38:48] he said there feels you building
[38:49] flashing all these things he said he was
[38:51] starting to mess him up miss really
[38:52] start to affect him right because he's
[38:54] seen all the wickedness he says it I
[38:56] trying to look at while I was coming up
[38:58] the steps oh he's in Spanish speaking to
[39:00] another woman she was a white woman
[39:02] speaking to the Spanish woman and when I
[39:04] looked she said all at once I changed
[39:07] remember you'd visit there before and
[39:09] now he's visiting there yet but it was
[39:13] what he says he was in the mall he was
[39:15] in JC Penney's he says there I seen that
[39:19] before he said he changes any seen this
[39:22] before now it's coming back from what he
[39:24] was seeing he says her eyes you know how
[39:27] the woman are doing now painted her eyes
[39:28] just free so he says like a cat he said
[39:31] you know putting up like this and
[39:32] wearing a cat glasses everything he said
[39:34] you know he says with her eyes up like
[39:36] this she said that green stuff under

[39:52] wars began to look around he said there
[39:54] was just people he says moaning you
[39:56] don't going about their price to think
[39:57] of it that's what it sounded like some
[40:00] good just a weariness around the people

[40:05] years ago his pennies I'm 54 I was 14 so

[42:50] supernatural spirit Satan now raising
[42:54] and mingling and is it's transferring to
[42:57] the people at an alarming rate

[45:33] counsel and foreknowledge of God he have
[45:36] taken my wicked hands up crucified and
[45:39] slain he says whom God has raised up
[45:41] having loosed the pains of death because
[45:44] it was not possible that he should be
[45:46] holdem he held him absolutely for David
[45:50] speaketh concerning him I foresaw the
[45:52] Lord always before my face and he is
[45:55] always on my right hand and I should not
[45:57] be moved therefore did my heart rejoice

[46:01] flesh shall rest in hope because thou
[46:04] shalt not be my soul in hell he said
[46:07] neither without suffering Holy One to
[46:09] see corruption sings now why why
[46:13] couldn't Jesus Christ stay in hell
[46:15] because the word before then what God
[46:17] said through the Prophet David he said
[46:19] I'll not leave my only one but what in
[46:22] hell I'll not suffer him to have crushed
[46:25] sure right osage of God if we have been
[46:28] truly oneness with Christ if you've been
[46:31] received the Holy Ghost been sealed Holy
[46:33] Ghost you are one with crop is it a
[46:36] revelation that says he that his filthy
[46:38] is Finley still he that his unjust
[46:41] unjust oh he that is just the just
[46:43] overheated is holy is unholy still
[46:47] absolutely what is another reason for
[46:49] the rapture is because of this scripture
[46:51] him hell is rising up if we see the
[46:53] wickedness of the world and if there's
[46:55] someone has got the Holy Oh chica God
[46:57] without either saw him hey and what I
[47:00] see is saw what the to be corruption
[47:03] after the byway other what first first
[47:05] Corinthians 15 diseases he said that
[47:07] corrosion must put on incorruption ask
[47:09] him free man that's practice and so
[47:12] that's why the rapture has to take place
[47:14] because what was it in John 17 Christ
[47:18] said he said he prayed to the Father so
[47:20] that we would be one like they are walk
[47:22] I took there was to be
[47:25] one with us right now complete oneness a
[47:28] few my what holy one without suffer half
[47:31] a man he will not leave his holy one in
[47:34] the head surely not anything that we're
[47:36] tasting and we're singing we're getting
[47:38] awfully close right there hell is fully
[47:40] not here yet because what is that the
[47:43] coming up seat and about what the
[47:45] prophecies is when syncing fall will be
[47:47] going up thing later my back sure
[47:51] absolutely what we going up absolutely
[47:53] that would he gets here now all hell
[47:55] will break loose but now we're seeing
[47:59] everything we're seeing this the demons
[48:02] bringing up and setting trenches up
[48:04] there getting there they're getting the
[48:06] earth set for them soon and this world
[48:08] is soon to receive a fiery baptism after
[48:11] that sure what is a perfect time
[48:13] absolutely will they go to hell first on
[48:16] earth and then their God what whites
[48:17] call the fire absolutely just like going
[48:21] to hell the lake of fire next the second
[48:22] death right sure everything's
[48:24] appropriate time absolutely but one
[48:26] thing i like about christ he is so
[48:29] merciful show yeah i remember that fire
[48:31] he burns the earth with fire everyone he
[48:34] burnt sonic more with fire he said those
[48:37] were examples right and it shows watch
[48:40] it's not an eternal hell absolutely just
[48:42] burner for a season and I'm of I God's
[48:45] grace I got mercy this is what they were
[48:47] here just extinguished I just I just
[48:49] love bugs there because I even went to
[48:51] denominations how could God allow
[48:53] someone to burn for all eternity
[48:55] continuing how could he do it he can
[48:58] he's too gracious he's too wonderful to
[49:01] Margaret essentially is so much mercy
[49:04] absolutely even on the lost that's good
[49:06] sure hey man ah i want to i want to show
[49:11] you something here only what time all
[49:15] right now let's go to you up let's see i
[49:22] want to show you
[49:23] this is something Lord show me I believe
[49:26] you showed this to me on a show you to
[49:27] how how powerful I was like how long we
[49:30] are yeah okay go to Matthew 27 will read
[49:34] all these scriptures i will show you
[49:35] something Lord showed through guy to
[49:37] open talk to me a while back aunty 27
[49:47] first 45 this is the crucifixion of
[49:51] Christ this is the this is Christ on the
[49:53] cross correct right verse 45 he is now
[49:57] now from the sixth hour there there was
[50:00] darkness all over the land into the
[50:02] night doc so here we see Christ now on a
[50:06] cross right is and darkness had filled
[50:09] the skies absolute darkness clouds
[50:12] everything that could cover the sunlight
[50:14] was there and it's a darkness for three
[50:16] all right i want to show you a quote
[50:18] here too but i'ma show you scripture off
[50:20] so the show would show you what's going
[50:21] on he says here is a hearing he says and
[50:26] then uh vs 45 you is it now the six hour
[50:30] there was darkness over old man 29 town
[50:32] about the ninth hour Jesus cried I looks
[50:34] a little bit the dark is said in and
[50:36] then we see what Jesus cried with a loud
[50:38] voice saying Eli Eli lama sabachthani
[50:40] that is to say my god my god why has
[50:44] thou forsaken correct now what was that
[50:47] entitle that was type of what that was a
[50:49] type of of Abel's lamb able but bringing
[50:53] the lamb up and hanging his throat lever
[50:55] and the Bible said we know through the
[50:57] prophecies that have read it lamb
[50:59] language is spoken an unknown language
[51:02] and hear what does the real Lamb of God
[51:05] was speaking in unknown language
[51:06] absolutely what the mayor got we know
[51:08] these things sure but now look look at
[51:10] this so he read this Jesus Christ cries
[51:15] speaks and comms some of them are stood
[51:19] there when they heard that they said
[51:20] this man calls for lives right now verse
[51:24] 51 if you hold the Veil the temple was
[51:26] rent in twain from the top to the bottom
[51:28] and the earth did quake in the rocks
[51:30] rent so we see clouds we see Christ cry
[51:34] let me see her right
[51:36] right now in the scripture there's a lot
[51:40] of time where Jesus Christ repeating
[51:42] himself barely imperative in Galatians
[51:46] Paul said he said if you speak any of
[51:48] these think um the speaks in a contrary
[51:50] lesson it'll be a curse he said I stayed
[51:52] again now in computer like computer
[51:57] geniuses like maybe some of yours are
[51:58] there's a yen at Mount straight and that
[52:00] little mouth is a little the two buttons
[52:02] there and it's got that little pointer
[52:04] thing on the screen you move it and it
[52:06] followed right and you and you you want
[52:09] to do on it they call copy and paste
[52:11] right move that they can click it drag
[52:14] it boom then hit your left thing you're
[52:16] right thing and boom and then pop it
[52:17] right now then you find a place for you
[52:19] impatient right when we're in face right
[52:22] there right that's what Christ is doing
[52:24] here a lot of times fairly rarely he
[52:26] comes it oh hey Scott where's where's a
[52:29] pretty good copy and paste Isaiah 41 me
[52:33] before I had low God has anointed me to
[52:37] preach to the cap is the set thing right
[52:40] you put it here in the Old Testament
[52:42] Isaiah 41 and then he copy and paste it
[52:45] and looking for mmm interesting priority
[52:49] where is the biggest copy and paste
[52:51] Bobby the biggest happiness because I
[52:59] remembered Isaiah for is pretty
[53:01] important in Isaiah for and I'm sorry
[53:05] I'm sorry Isaiah 41 and look for that
[53:09] hides the Gentile dispensation right
[53:11] there with the common right brother
[53:12] absolutely like I'm a highest Gentile
[53:14] dispensation or where is the biggest
[53:18] copy paste sort of First Samuel I'm
[53:25] sorry second
[53:26] 21 I want to show you something here I
[53:29] believe the Lord opened up a little bit
[53:34] and they give me much pleasure justice
[53:39] they God would show this to meriden
[53:40] leave it you judge yourself it may be
[53:44] even second Savior 21 here and right at
[53:48] the end of this chapter verse 13
[53:50] moreover the Philistines had yet war
[53:52] again with Israel notice David having
[53:56] war of the Philistines once more
[53:59] springing out he says and David went
[54:03] down in his servants with him and fought
[54:05] against the Philistines and what David
[54:07] waxed faint for the first time in his
[54:10] military career game is finally getting
[54:13] tired he's had enough he's fighting his
[54:17] killing he's got mercy suitable I've
[54:19] been fighting since day one running from
[54:21] the king of Israel he says in east by
[54:27] bed which was one of the sons of the
[54:29] giant Goliath he says the weight of
[54:33] whose fear weighed 300 shekels of grass
[54:35] and wait it was girded with the new
[54:37] sword thought to have slain David he was
[54:41] weak he's getting tired where he's gonna
[54:43] wore out and Now Big Brother little
[54:47] brother whatever remember what he did
[54:49] his big brother it does bella peace and
[54:50] now your mind David us here getting tire
[54:52] on there I'm coming for it i'd imagine a
[54:56] giant fried forgot everything else push
[54:57] that it I don't to fight you i don't buy
[54:59] you as I want that guy yeah alright
[55:01] alright David probably finding in other
[55:04] battles and the quarter lies she's big
[55:06] big boy call me oh here we go tired Lord
[55:11] you gotta do something out oh sure but
[55:15] verse 17 but I wish I the son of his
[55:17] araya secured him as small to those he
[55:19] killed him and when the meta David
[55:21] sweared him saying thou shalt go no more
[55:23] out with us the battle that that was
[55:25] quenched not the light of his room his
[55:28] roughest battle right here first time he
[55:31] could have faced I mean really he was
[55:33] could've faced death and now the battle
[55:36] is over they defeated the Philistine
[55:38] what's never and fine
[55:39] thus all had just died that enemy was
[55:41] gone all of his enemies is now so
[55:45] they're all settled peace first time in
[55:49] David's life since Alya he sings a song
[55:55] I give them the song chapter 22 verse 1
[56:07] and they would speak in the Lord to
[56:10] solve the words of this song in the day
[56:12] the Lord delivered him out of the hand
[56:14] of all his enemies now the hand of Saul
[56:20] 100 songs start and he said the Lord is
[56:23] my rock is it the Lord of my fortress
[56:26] and my deliverer the god of my rock let
[56:29] him in here will I trust he is my shield
[56:32] and the horn of my salvation by high
[56:34] tolerances my refuge my Savior he said
[56:37] thou save us me from violence he says I
[56:40] will call on the Lord look who is worthy
[56:43] to be praised so shall we be saved from
[56:45] my enemies when the waiters of death
[56:47] notice comforts me the blood of ungodly
[56:50] man made me afraid the sorrows but death
[56:52] hell the sorrows of hell come with me
[56:55] about and the snares of death for enemy
[56:57] in my distress I called upon the Lord
[57:00] and he cried unto my and cry out to my
[57:03] god and he did he hear my voice out of
[57:06] in his temple he says in my cried and
[57:10] entrance was here this is david what at
[57:13] the time of this is the Lord saving one
[57:16] at this time he was such a man of god of
[57:18] profit that God was hurt him out of his
[57:21] temple because what did his body was
[57:23] God's best left without God's king
[57:25] that's it that was God's prophet sure
[57:27] and then we'll all those 4,000 years
[57:30] later we see Christ on the cross Christ
[57:32] is screaming out on what goes temple
[57:34] once again absolute sure it's the exact
[57:37] same thing Paul Peter said that David
[57:40] was a prophet episode so here we see
[57:43] this is the exact same this is Christ on
[57:45] the cross section sure now he says
[57:52] and the earth shook and trouble they're
[57:54] here quick these are the photos of the
[57:57] earth of heaven move the shoot because
[57:59] he was wrong who God what's wrong he
[58:04] says that they one of us smoke out of
[58:06] his nostrils in a fire out of his mouth
[58:08] devoured coals were kindled by he bowed
[58:10] the heavens also and came down and
[58:13] darkness was under his feet notice the
[58:15] exact same saying is Christ on the cross
[58:17] we have the earthquake we have a man in
[58:19] distress cries out from his temple and
[58:21] what God hears it and then what we see
[58:23] that God comes down and then he brings
[58:26] darkness look he says and he bounded
[58:29] heavens also and came down and doctors
[58:31] was under his feet and he wrote upon a
[58:32] chair of and did fly and he was seen
[58:35] upon the wings of the wind and he made
[58:37] darkest pavilions run about him dark
[58:39] waters in the dark dark clouds and sky
[58:42] the exact same setting things of god
[58:46] this is the biggest copy and paste for
[58:47] hear anybody where does this end up
[58:49] songs 18 Psalms eighty men absolutely
[58:55] this is the biggest three the entire
[58:58] song was so powerful about deliverance
[59:01] no matter where was Jesus at where was
[59:03] what encompassed by death and surrounded
[59:06] by hell and soon absolute why is that so
[59:13] important well why would we couldn't be
[59:16] putting in twice he had me reason I
[59:19] believe it's because Christ in the bride
[59:23] Christ now all the live godly shall
[59:27] suffer persecution how much persecution
[59:29] honey you know when the guys came two
[59:32] nights ago and held you by gunpoint put
[59:35] you through them through the back of the
[59:36] truck there and handcuffed good and you
[59:39] cried out and God look what does that
[59:41] happen to us right just being a
[59:43] Christian I when he first came into this
[59:45] message there's a couple of brother the
[59:47] brother the head in the back of the twin
[59:48] children chuckling now and came on
[59:50] because it came into the word yeah oh
[59:53] yeah we're pretty big bad mostly Berber
[59:58] I was right but now here there the
[1:00:01] promise in this is the greatest copy and
[1:00:04] paste as a promise
[1:00:06] let's turn to Psalms 18 starts out the
[1:00:15] exact same way he said the Lord is my
[1:00:17] rock there's to my fortress and this and
[1:00:19] that verse 9 ah what started vs. up 10
[1:00:28] actually let me read let me read to you
[1:00:30] what the Prophet said it was kind of
[1:00:33] slow turd well the Prophet said about
[1:00:35] them clouds when we see the clouds and
[1:00:37] God coming down trees angry he heard a
[1:00:39] voice out of his Tabernacle mark of the
[1:00:43] beast in the seal of God 61 e sez e 40
[1:00:47] he says he says a god a great guy who's
[1:00:50] full of love he is full of love in order
[1:00:53] that he loved he must have to have
[1:00:55] judgment to be just so he is a merciful
[1:00:58] God tonight he's my friend when you
[1:01:01] stand before my judgment on that dark
[1:01:03] cloudy day he says he will be a god in
[1:01:05] full of anger the Bible says so in his
[1:01:07] rack he says I was down on the front I
[1:01:10] was cutting cutting their a stone from
[1:01:12] Colorado and goes into some story here
[1:01:14] he says and I said he gets in
[1:01:17] conversation with a woman about the dark
[1:01:18] cloud hanging down on Christ he says I
[1:01:21] said that's the clouds of God's wrath
[1:01:23] that was was God come down in the cloud
[1:01:25] was he mad at the people were crucifying
[1:01:27] him no that's not where the anger of God
[1:01:30] was was directed act way they took his
[1:01:34] son and they will haunt a cross riding
[1:01:37] bina they put thornden they're
[1:01:39] crucifying him and God was not angry
[1:01:41] with it not with them where was the
[1:01:44] anger of God he says the clouds of God's
[1:01:48] wrath God poured his wrath upon Christ
[1:01:51] who took my place at Calvary man this is
[1:01:57] where the anger of God was directed at
[1:01:59] not upon the Romans or the Jew that that
[1:02:02] instant but it was all on Jesus Christ
[1:02:05] deep amin he says he died into the
[1:02:10] judgments and wrath of God God poured
[1:02:12] out his fierce judgment upon him and he
[1:02:14] took my place yes sir and said he says I
[1:02:17] was a sinner he took my place
[1:02:18] cheers running up with a woman's I said
[1:02:20] he's in worse simple we have no hope but
[1:02:22] God knows that we had has to stand these
[1:02:24] judgments and Jesus took them force and
[1:02:27] then the clouds hanging over the cross
[1:02:29] was God's wrath for another one he said
[1:02:33] he bore the wrath of God in his own body
[1:02:35] that we might be free oh what a story
[1:02:37] when it's true God tract sure absolutely
[1:02:41] so here back in solids 18 we see what we
[1:02:44] see the cry from the distress verse 11
