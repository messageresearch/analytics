========================================

this godhead series by the grace of the Lord is this mic up kind of loud it seems a little loud is that is that normal all right praise the Lord so let's go to uh second Corinthians 13 14. would like to start there maybe we'll finish this series tonight Lord willing we'll see how it goes trust everybody's having a good week in the Lord by God's grace Hallelujah last Wednesday we looked at Jesus's prayers in the Garden of Gethsemane we looked at Jesus's baptism we don't see three persons like most churches tell us we see one God manifesting himself in different ways praise God numerous ways at the same time so tonight Lord willing we'll look at uh different three-fold references of God so second Corinthians 13 verse 14. so doing some teaching here tonight by God's grace but trying to mix some preaching in here as well about the grace of the Lord let's read this together if we can here let's begin on three one two three the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the communion of the Holy Ghost be with you all praise God does anybody see three persons in there I don't see it safe it doesn't say three persons but it does give three attributes of the one almighty god let's have one more word of prayer just our heads here and you have a need on your heart just make it known unto God again we prayed once but let's pray again father God we come to the most important part Lord the singing really sets us free Lord God we thank you for that Hallelujah gets our hearts beating Lord God our bodies awake Lord our minds focused on you Hallelujah gets us off the distractions of the world and Onto You Lord the focus of our attention here tonight Lord God Hallelujah bless his time in your presence God anoint me God anoint your people each one needs the anointing of the Holy Spirit here tonight father may your spirit Lord deal with each and every need father God and Lord thank you for this topic Lord as we labored on it now for months Lord I just pray God it would just help those that need it Lord Jesus thank you for the wonderful testimonies we're getting back lord God and just continue to move direct these words Lord to exactly where they need to go feed your sheep here tonight we pray in Jesus Christ's name and Saint said amen God bless yours you're being seated praise God I'd like to continue on this thought on the mystery that God had I believe this is part seven if I'm not mistaken so threefold references of God we read second Corinthians 13 14. a lot of trinitarians who of course are wrong about God say this speaks of three persons but it never says uh three persons and in fact it really just shows the unity of God for example the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ so uh trinitarian see son love of God father and communion of the Holy Ghost now if you just pause just for a moment if this is speaking of three persons well does that mean Jesus has all the grace and God has no Grace of course not because I can take you to the Old Testament and and uh which one it was Ezra Ezra said God has given us Grace for a season of life so God the Father gave Grace in the Old Testament Hallelujah I'm going to believe Jesus is Love as well and how many believe you can have communion with the Heavenly Father Paul says that our prayer we have a high priest who makes intercession to God for us right so we have communion with the Son and the father we're to come boldly before the throne of grace so when you just look at it and you use a little bit of spiritual understanding you see how God is not speaking of three persons Paul's not speaking of three persons he's just speaking of three different offices or manifestations now the other example is Matthew 28 19 where Jesus said go baptize them in the name one name of the father Son and the Holy Ghost ten days later Peter said baptize them in the name of Jesus Christ when he was filled with the holy spirit so if we see that Jesus was revealing a mystery the Bible said Jesus would speak and utter he would utter dark sayings in other words he would utter Mysteries and this is one of those Mysteries there's one name so father son Holy Ghost that's the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah and then of course first time five seven we looked at this a number of months ago but the Bible says uh the Bible speaks of the Father the word and the Holy Ghost these three are one it doesn't say these three persons it just says there's three there's three father word Holy Ghost praise God anyone that knows the Bible knows the father is Holy and the father is a ghost the father is a spirit Jesus prayed uh to his father the holy spirit so father and holy spirit are one and the Bible says in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God so we see one person we don't see three persons we see one person but this one person had to manifest himself in three ways to redeem man he had to be a father over all creation praise God it'll be a father over Adam and Eve amen but then he had to become a son in order to pay the penalty for sin and then he had to become the Holy Ghost to live in the hearts of the Believers praise God hallelujah amen thank God and that's how that's how God plans salvation Father Son and Holy Ghost on the inside of us praise God so we see it's it's necessary God is saying it's necessary you must recognize father-son Holy Ghost for salvation but God never said cut them up into three persons persons if you add persons to the Bible now you become a liar the Bible says when you add to the word the Bible says God will call you a liar so we don't want to be called Liars on the day of judgment praise God although we want to be called beloved we want to be called sought out let's listen to the end of that sermon I preached a few weeks ago we want to be called sought out not forsaken hallelujah praise God that's what we want to be called amen the Beloved of the Lord hallelujah now so those three those three offices are attributes prove we must uh Believers must recognize God's three manifestations if if you lived in either one of those and you neglected it it was uh judgment for sure the Pharisees rejected the sun manifestation they loved the father manifestation but they rejected the current Sun manifestation and Jesus said if you don't believe in me you'll die in your sins praise God and then when the Holy Ghost come to speak against the Holy Ghost Stephen said you always resist the Holy Ghost you blasting the Holy Ghost so to speak against the Holy Ghost and the Believers who are following the real Holy Ghost is an awful awful sin we better watch our words praise God we better make sure we we call what is God really of God Amen we've got to judge it the right way how am I going to know brother Jess test it by the word praise God give it the word test amen hallelujah praise God all these years sister Emma I've been preaching oh is it now 16 years 18 years I've been preaching 18 years I've yet for somebody to show me a verse where God calls himself three persons all these years I'm waiting I'm just waiting my uh my battery runs out I've been waiting so long for somebody come show me where God is three persons or show me where the disciples baptized father son Holy Ghost praise God or show me uh any of these truths that where a woman where God told a Godly woman to cut her hair where did God tell a woman to to wear makeup where did God ever do that where did God ever tell a woman to marry a woman or a man to marry man I've been waiting 18 years I imagine I'll keep waiting praise God but one thing for sure I'll keep preaching God's truth because God's spirit directs us into all truth amen Hallelujah and that's our absolute the Bible is the absolute praise God and we say it with love amen hallelujah but love is always corrective Hallelujah you love God God's going to the Bible says that God loves you he's going to correct you he's going to rebuke you he's going to correct you he's going to speak to you and he's going to direct you praise God any good parent will correct their child the Bible said if you don't love your Bible said if you don't chasing your child you don't even love your child Hallelujah so love is corrective but love is also loving too love is also merciful too we're not going to leave that out praise God hallelujah I mean how many experience God sent her love praise God oh I've seen it so many times financially he's provided for us my forgiveness he's provided when we don't feel like we deserve forgiven when we feel guilty but then the Holy Spirit Will confess our sins and the Holy Spirit will make us feel forgiven that that's that's more than life to me praise God so yes we get correction but we also get the love of God Amen we get all of it because we're children of God Jesus said he that blasting the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven remember you can do it with ignorance as Paul said in first Timothy chapter 1. now uh Paul and John both write greetings when they're writing their letters and they mention uh Father Son and Holy Ghost I'm sorry they mentioned only Father and Sons let's quickly put those up there and you're on duty tonight so God bless you Romans 1 7. Romans 1 7. now notice Paul never sent mentions the Holy Ghost he just talks about the father and the son to all that be in Rome beloved of God Called to be Saints grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ he doesn't mention the Holy Ghost was Paul like a was Paul of two persons and not a three persons no it just it's just not necessary to mention all three it's not necessary to do that every single time that's what the Catholic does they have every single time I like I told you I went to the funeral they did that maybe 50 or 100 times in a matter of half an hour but that's not what the Bible says First Corinthians 1 3. because we know the father is the Holy Ghost praise God Grace be unto you in peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ first John 1 verse 3 first John 1 verse three you're getting real fast there honey I appreciate that that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye Also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with the son Jesus Christ now apologize for a minute didn't our opening verse say we have communion with the Holy Ghost huh well right here he says our fellowship is with the father and the son ah well maybe Paul doesn't know as much as John does or maybe vice versa nah that's nonsense they both have the same Revelation praise God it's not about three persons it's about one God hallelujah so see did Paul only believe in two persons or did John only believe even two persons no it's not necessary to always mention the Holy Ghost because Paul knew John knew the father of the Holy Ghost or the self-sane person Hallelujah so we see uh at church this this godhead is an enigma which means a mystery the Bible calls it an enigma in the Hebrew in the Old Testament it's called an enigma dark sayings Jesus would utter dark sayings the book of Psalm says and that was an enigma or a mystery this is a mysterious thing see because all now let's go back to Second Corinthians 13 14 honey all three attributes pertaining to God grace love and communion but in this one verse Paul just points out how uh God uses these three attributes with the three different manifestations for example the Bible he said the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ see in another place the Bible said Jesus was full of grace and truth right so Paul's just emphasizing the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ in other words Jesus had favor on you that you didn't deserve Hallelujah Jesus had favor on you you didn't deserve it but I sure believe you accept it praise God Amen I didn't deserve it I don't deserve it but I know he gave it to me praise God because I've received it I've I've received the gift praise God and I'm enjoying the gift that God has given me free salvation Hallelujah free Deliverance amen I'm delivered from my sins Hallelujah that's a reality Church and by Grace the Bible said Jesus tasted death for every man by Grace he did that that was Hebrews 2 9. you want to pull that up on Hebrews 2 9. Grace made him take the cross for you brother Austin Grace in other words Jesus went to give you a favor he wanted to do you a favor that you didn't deserve sister who that you didn't deserve I didn't deserve it but Jesus loved you so he wanted to show you Grace amen I love it amen we see Jesus it was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death cry with Glory now that he by the grace of God should taste death for every member in bride of Christ Fellowship and Living Waters Tabernacle he takes a death for you sister Emma praise God his grace did that Hallelujah the Bible said he endured the cross because the joy that was set before him amen The Joy where Jesus can sit in heaven tonight and Jesus the Bible said your worship is a sweet smelling savior unto him think about all the different churches around the world brothers that are worshiping God tonight it's worship it's incense coming up those prayers are coming up and Jesus Jesus smells it spiritually he rejoices in it in other words you're giving an acceptable offering of Jesus and Jesus Delights in your worship praise God but by Grace he takes a death so you didn't have to the death of the cross if God dairies we'll all go to the Grave by the natural way of death but we're here he's talking about the death of punishment the death of the cross the death of a sinner we don't die the death of a sinner the Bible said precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints amen hallelujah it's not a scary thing death is not a scary thing for believers death is not an awful thing death is a precious thing because the believer gets United with his gracious Heavenly Father with his gracious savior with the communion of the Holy Spirit now he gets a new body and has perfect communion with the Holy Ghost never to sin again amen oh it's beautiful then Paul emphasized the love of God we know John 3 16 for God so loved the world and Romans 8 verses 38 39 explain God's great love cause him to send his son to die for our salvation and in Romans 8 Paul has 10 things that cannot separate us from the love of God can we pull it up there let's go to Romans 8 I just thought we'll preach that here tonight I don't think I'm going to finish this chapter I'm gonna have to keep going I never can finish when I think I can Romans 8. Romans 8 38 39. yeah just in these verses he lists 10 things Brian persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come think about that think about that church anything present now cannot separate you from the love of Christ any trial you're facing tonight it cannot separate you from God's love and anything in the future if time goes on and we go to 2023 or 2025 or 2030 or 2040 or God forbid 2050 2060. or 2070 if time goes on it cannot separate us from the love of Christ amen nothing past present future can separate you from the love of God that's kind of God I want to serve right there nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord so God's love is in Christ well I thought I thought in the Trinity all the Love's in God it's got God God in Christ right that's what the Bible says love of God which is in Christ Jesus so God's love is in Christ Jesus let me leave the Bible see with the with a carnal mind you think God's giving three persons he's not he's showing one he's showing all of his manifestations is one person God is expressing his love in many ways to us Glory see we have communion today and then of course we have communion with the Holy Ghost as that scripture says go to John 14 26 would you write that I'm sorry put it up there sorry not right up there put it up there they're just they're just a special attribute about the Holy Ghost now I believe when we have communion with the Holy Ghost we're actually having them communion with Jesus right I believe we're having communion with the father at the same time praise God because God's spirit is in Jesus praise God with the comforter which is the Holy Ghost so she searched that's what the Holy Ghost is given for if you need comfort you've got to talk about talk to Jesus about it praise God he's there to give you comfort I don't know about you but I had a good dance on Sunday I had the best prayer I've had this week in a long time so I think I need to dance more that's what I think it is I was right to be able to go right to the closet no hindrances you know just write him I thought my I really need to dance more shame on me I should dance more praise God the Comfort which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he'll teach you all things if you ever learn anything it was from the Holy Ghost is that what the Bible says Bible says Jesus says if you ever learned anything it's all he goes to taught you that but how many believe the Holy Ghost is not done teaching you now okay see in other words God wants you to learn tonight God wants you to learn on Sunday God wants me to learn we all got to learn praise God we all got to be humble and say teach me more Lord lest I go astray lest I choose the beaten the wrong way the beaten the wrong path right help me to choose the right way and the Holy Ghost will bring all things he remembers whatsoever I've said unto you so that's how you know the Holy Ghost is working he'll bring the words of Jesus I remember that scripture Hallelujah that's right that's what the Bible says at the very moment you need it that's the work of the Holy Spirit praise God amen so see how that verse second Corinthians 13 14 uh the love of God the grace of Jesus love of God and the community of Holy Ghost see how it's all throughout the Bible it's not pointing up three different persons doing three different works it's just different attributes of different manifestations of God okay so don't let a trinitarian ever tell you well that's three persons that never says three persons you got to look more of the scriptures okay I hope that's a help by God's grace I love the Bible don't you I love Coleman through this scripture oh my it's eternal life Hallelujah I love searching and that's right that's what it says here that's yes all goes together one beautiful story now the next section in the book is the is Jesus the Eternal son trinitarians in the athanasian Creed which is a false Creed With Many contradictions in it which I've already preached on they call Jesus the Eternal son the Creed says the father is eternal the son is eternal the Holy Ghost is eternal but the Eternal Sun title is both absent from the Bible and deceiving because it eludes that Jesus and the father eternally existed as separate persons in heaven right the truth is Jesus body did not exist until God God's spirit formed it in Mary's womb so therefore Jesus's body had a beginning but his Spirit did not praise God so that's why the the title Eternal son doesn't work the word son naturally means you had a beginning you came out of something you came from a father but the father is always before the son I mean it's just common sense but these Creeds they lie they insert lies in there in order to deceive people right I love what brother Adam says this is quote according brother Brown quote people talk about Jesus being the Eternal Son of God now isn't that a contradiction whoever heard of a son being eternal sons have Beginnings but what but that which is eternal never had a beginning he is eternal god Jehovah manifested in the flesh end quote Hallelujah Glory so see when they try to say Eternal son they're trying to make a third person like there was always three people up there in heaven that's that's a lie that's wrong the Bible doesn't call Jesus Eternal son okay so we can't add uh to God's word now a famous trinitarian named Rick Warren who he's getting the the longer time goes I say this with love he's getting more and more off the word of God he wrote a good book the purpose-driven life I found two things wrong in it but there could be more but Rick Warren wrote got quote God invites us to enjoy fellowship and friendship with all three persons of the Trinity end quote so trinitarians believe you've got to be friends with the Father and Son and Holy Ghost now what if you don't treat them all good I mean which one you giving the most time to see how that would cause some problems mostly people just talk to Jesus right what about the father and the Holy Ghost right everybody you know most churches talk about Jesus and pray to Jesus yeah that's good but if there's three you got to pray to now you really gotta really gotta divide up your time Faithfully right he says you need to be friends with all three persons oh my goodness this is found nowhere in scripture in fact it's the opposite Isaiah Ezekiel and John had Fellowship when they went to heaven they only had fellowship with one person amen hallelujah Ezekiel saw him as a wheel within the middle of a wheel praise God Hallelujah Glory Daniel Psalm as the Ancient of Days Hallelujah one man interested in white with hair like white that's the same one John Saul praise God wasn't talking with three he talked Jesus he saw Jesus but then he saw angels and different ones and Angelic hosts and and uh different ones in heaven that he saw he saw those Four and Twenty Elders Hallelujah but there's only one throne and there's only one person sitting on the throne see thank God we don't have the pressure of fellowshipping with three different gods no they'll never say Gods but their definition makes it three Gods we've already been through that they'll never say I believe in three Gods it's always three persons but a person has to be individual from somebody else if not the word person makes no sense the very word person means I'm someone separate than another person I'm a separate being I'm not the same Hallelujah oh my help us Lord and then uh uh Rick Warren says this quote the Trinity is God's relationship to himself now look at that God's relationship to himself can't even understand that I have a relationship with myself Jesse how are you this morning I'm pretty tired oh let me cheer you up a little bit can I show you I mean that's ridiculous are you hungry Jess yeah could you make me some eggs I'm sure I'll go make you something I have a relationship with myself you see how these this is insanity God needs to have a relationship with himself Mercy it doesn't make any sense I I haven't even finished the quote he says God quote God God has always existed in loving relationship to himself so he's never been lonely he didn't need a family so God that's the end of the quote God's never been lonely because he always had two other persons to Fellowship and this guy's one of the leaders in the Evangelical world remember when he had remember when he had the debates between John McCain and Barack Obama does anybody remember that I won the oldest one it's down here tonight and he might have been watching he's in gotten anyway you know but I remember when he had those debates and they debated about marriage and both said We Believe marriage is one man and one woman by their by their trickery they got Obama in there they thought he was a conservative turned out to be one of the worst Presidents of all time supporting the homosexual agenda all the corruption Hillary Clinton everything like that but what did it the church the church brought these guys together that's the false Church but this guy said God wasn't alone because he had two other people to fellowship with now it's true God has never been lonely but God doesn't need anything really go to acts 17 25 God really doesn't need anything this is all by grace God does not have a need of anything but God does have a plan thank God and you're a part of it Hallelujah okay say like this you're the good part of it you're the positive part of it Hallelujah you're a vessel unto honor you're a vessel unto Grace praise God you're not a vessel to dishonor but your life will honor Jesus Christ neither is worship with men's hands as though he needed anything it's not like God needs your worship but God wants you to express yourself to him seeing he giveth life to all breath and all things see God doesn't need really anything but God is giving us free more agency to let us choose whatever we want and if we want salvation he'll give it to us amen and he'll teach us how to serve him and love him but he doesn't really need it he doesn't have to have it to exist he's not like well I sure hope Jesse keeps preaching you're loving God because I surely want his Fellowship I I really need it it's a different kind of a love praise God it's a different kind of power it's a different kind of level it's far above our level like we think we need this money or we need this relationship or we've got to have this or we no it's true we need it but God doesn't need anything praise God so what has this all done it all magnifies the grace of God he's given us a chance aren't you glad for a chance to serve God aren't you glad he showed you his truth aren't you glad he pointed you in the right direction praise God he didn't leave you alone he didn't let you just wander around but Jesus the great Shepherd left the 99 and went after you amen hallelujah praise God he went and sought you out you beloved amen he went and sought to you praise God he never forsook you praise God he wanted to show you his love so that you in return would lovingly serve him praise God and make himself known Hallelujah but God doesn't need anything he didn't need two people to fellowship with hey daddy father you want to spend some time together today never actually wasn't a day yet there was no there's no there's no sun there's no moon there eternally existed together sweet Dove can you Roost on my shoulder and can you imagine Jesus and can you Roost on my shoulder can I can you coo in my ear can I pet you I need some fellowship that's ridiculous we laughed Emma laughter I laughed nonsense this is paganism polytheism try theism three Gods by love Isaiah 44 24. pull that up there I love this I just like to nail this down put it right there and say this is what I believe praise God Isaiah 45 20 more thus saith the Lord thy Redeemer and he that formed thee in the womb see the same one that formed you in the womb I am the Lord that maketh all things that stretches forth the heavens alone alone let's all say alone can we alone to the same one that stretched out the heavens is the same one that formed you in your mother's womb praise God hallelujah praise God that spreads abroad the Earth by myself any help well if the Holy Ghost formed Jesus in the womb then he's the Holy Ghost was a separate person than the father well then the Holy Ghost formed the Earth and not the father see how this is so confusing now you gotta you gotta you gotta play with all these scriptures you got to search around it doesn't make any sense no there's only one God hallelujah and he's the one he proved that he did creation all by himself one person not three and like I showed you last week Church eventually they're going to kill over this the transares will want to kill anyone who descends over this topic yes they will that's what they all say and all these guys right now All These Guys these trinitarian guys I watch them on YouTube they all they all want to basically uh reject TD Jakes now he's not a faithful preacher he's a Prosperity preacher but they want to kiss in the creeds I'm not the heretic they're the Heretics Glory Hallelujah if God has two other persons then he has to manage of multiple personalities disorder he's got to manage that make sure he doesn't get a disorder making sure he's fellowships with both other persons right God himself God the father has to make sure he fellowships with the Son and the Holy Ghost oh it's nonsense Hallelujah now Church there is there is some truth too we were chosen as a pope Ephesians 1 4. we were Eternal in one sense that we were in the mind of God in other words God had a thought about you before the foundation of the world and I'll say this God had a thought about this the body of Jesus Christ before the body of Jesus Christ of course was formed in the womb of Mary that was an eternal thought of God because the Bible says according hath chosen Us in where he chosen Us in him in his mind before the foundation of the world before there's a world there's a thought in there about the seven Church ages and at the very end there were some Believers filled with the Holy Ghost and that thought was about you Glory you weren't the lukewarm thought you weren't the cold thought you were the hot thought amen Hallelujah somebody ought to be saying amen praise God he had a thought about you praise God and that was his thought of choosing them in Me by four knowledge I know what they'll choose they'll choose to be hot they'll choose to be real sons and daughters of God they'll choose to believe all the word of God and I place them at that time and place for a particular season Hallelujah so see God had thoughts but then he expressed them good now so see you're a thought of God and I'll pull up II Corinthians 6 16. there is some truth that the sun was an eternal thought of God but the son didn't exist as a separate person outside of God the Father the body of Jesus was a thought God in other words God was thinking I'm going to manifest myself in flesh at some point but there wasn't like I'm going to put you in flesh one day okay Holy Ghost I'm going to send you in the hearts of all the saints one day he wasn't talking to two other people it was all honest thoughts so just picture one man one God one God all knowing all things and he was all by himself but he had all these thoughts and you were one of them Hallelujah he had plans for you praise God he had plans for you and you and you had your plans for all of us praise God plans for good and not evil praise God that's what the Bible says to give you an expected End Amen you can know what to expect the blessings of God the grace of God hallelujah amen Hallelujah ask me what keeps me young I think it's running after all these kids preaching so hard I think that's what keeps me going what agreement at the temple of God with idols what can the what can the real house of God what Fellowship can our church have with Catholic Church that have Idols there's no there's no agreement for ye are the Temple of the Living God as God has said what did God say before in his thoughts I will dwell in brother Austin I would dwell in of our sisters I will dwell that was his thoughts he had all these thoughts and he said one day I'm going to dwell in them see so you you have an eternal aspect to you the thought of you the thought praise God that thought of you is eternal because that's where he chose you glory he didn't choose you in 1990 when you were born or me 1980 he chose you in his mind before the foundation wrote he was thinking about you way before you thought about him amen that ought to comfort you tonight praise God before he even surrendered to him he was already planning your ways and planning your repentance planning your baptism planting The Filling of the Holy Ghost amen he already had it all planned out Hallelujah before he even thought of him he was thinking good things about you thank God Amen you're an eternal thought of God but then one day he said I'm going to dwell in her I'm going to dwell in him I'm glad he's living to me praise God Jesus oh he's living me Hallelujah and I'll walk in them I'll walk in their shoes and I will be their God they shall be my people Church you are the people of God Sinners are walking around and they don't even realize they're walking with the people of God Glory I like what you're doing buddy we are talking about that they don't even know God is handing them a meal God God's people amen is handing somebody else in me God's God's Own people are upping them with their flat God's Own people are sending them offerings over the seas to help out the hungry and the poor God's Own people that God is walking in realize that church when you're when you're helping people it's actually God walking in your shoes God's leading you there it's kind of like the God's pulling your shoes and you're just kind of going for the ride right oh thank you Lord thank you God's taking me there he's walking in me praise God he if we let him lead us he'll guide us praise God it'll be God walking through us now don't forget in your home too it's God that walks in you helps you help out your children when you don't feel like it it's God that it's God in you that walks back to the kitchen for another meal to make another they're never ending and guess what it never will those laundry loads are never never gonna end right it's God there's an eternal aspect so you are a manifested thought of God do you have an eternal quality to you and then one day you were to be expressed in a flesh body so God can walk in you and then God can have fellowship with you I will walk in them I will be their God and they will be my people oh Hallelujah God loves that fellowship with your church God just wants to talk with you he just wants to hear about your day how many believe that he just wants to hear how you feel how you feeling today what is there anything bothering you you need to talk to me about anything anything you want to share with me that I can I can I can take that load off your shoulders any burdens you want to share with me that I can take that's how God is he wants to fellowship with you he knew he already knew all about it but he's just waiting for you to show him some fellowship thank God thank God Amen Hallelujah now just to balance this out the invisible father did have fellowship with the son once the son became visible that's called the logos but it always wasn't that way right in the beginning God said let there be light that light was the light of God so before there was nothing there was absolutely nothing it was just it was all God but then God had a manifestation of light time space and matter all came in existence at one time and God had made a light and now there's a son something came out of the nothingness or out of the fullness of God something visible came out of the fullness of God and that was the son and now the Bible says that's when God and the son started having Fellowship that's what the Bible says so uh John 17 it's uh 17 5 and 24. okay just left okay no problem I'll put up in the Bible that's okay 75 I'm not gonna be too much longer if you want to you can that's fine oh thank you huh John 17 5 I'm gonna get it in 24. and now oh Father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was oh so this is where the trinitarians stumble see this is the scripture they misinterpret oh see there always was father uh Young Man and Dove no there wasn't always that there's nothing there's not even that in the Bible it's only God God and then a visible a theophany or a visible logos whether it's fire or looks like a man in heaven the Bible says so say so see there was an eternal quality Jesus or God had a thought about himself become miserable the son or the logos and then when that logos was come out of the mind of God then God was moving in that fire god is moving in that light and now the Bible said they can have Fellowship the manifestation with the invisible God praise God that's in the Bible 1720 25 or 25 no 24. father I will that they also whom thou Hast given me be with me where I am that they may be hold my glory which thou has given me for thou loveth me what before the foundation of the world so now we got two things before the foundation world you were chosen before the foundation world and God loved his son the logos amen before the foundation of the world amen hallelujah praise God you are chosen in him before the foundation world when God loved his son you were chosen to him we're getting some deep Waters here Teresa like the Bible said verse it was at the knees then it was at the waist and then it was out my head that's in the Book of Ezekiel you just keep in deeper the things of God hallelujah take me deeper amen hallelujah take me deeper Jesus so first there was God and then God said I'm going to start making myself towards visible towards a man and the first step was a light and then God the invisible went in that light and had fellowship with that light and that's the that's the glory they shared before the foundation world and then remember that light that light that logos then the logos spoke and said let there be let there be a Earth let there be a sun Let There Be sea creatures all the creation of God out of the logos see church I ain't scared of one verse in the Bible there's not one verse in the Bible that offends me that I that I don't say well I don't believe that I believe everything in the Bible I might not understand everything in the Bible sure believe it praise God I believe it and it just takes a little humility to search the scriptures and find the understanding that we need remember the Bible said I mentioned this on Sunday remember the Bible says we must grow in the knowledge of God we must invest significant time in the things of God and that's how we'll grow in the Statue of our perfect man by spending more time with God making God's word our Delight and church we got we got to understand this it's just going to get harder and harder to focus on God as time goes on there's going to be more and more distractions when I was growing up the only distraction I had was a radio now you guys got cell phones there's a lot of Bing ding ding bing bong all day long there's that thing called Bing Bong all day long Bing it's a kid's song in other words on the cell phone getting notifications on the cell phone all day long we had to go to uh the radio we had to go to but now they just carry and there's distractions all day long all God wants is our fellowship praise God the communion of the Holy Ghost that's what he wants in our lives that's that's the that's the the manifestation we're in right now the Holy Ghost manifestation he wants to bring Church the Holy Ghost wants to bring Jesus words to our remembrance so remember them when we're in our houses we remember them on the job we'll remember them right here in church well remember what Jesus said and it will help us in our Christian Journey instead of like this instead of stumbling tripping instead of stumbling over sin the word will come and it'll help us to step over those things so we don't stumble Hallelujah I remember what Jesus said I ain't going to trip I'm going to be very careful I'm going to I'm going to the Bible said walk circumspectly I'm going to walk exactly where I need to go and I'm almost falling all over the place here when you got when you're walking with God when you have Community with the Holy Ghost you're walking in the correct path the right steps God wants you to walk in your communion directs your walk with the Lord your daily communion but God did have fellowship with the son before the foundational world it was the invisible the invisible with the visible light that's the scripture you want to see a beautiful picture of it proverbs 8. verse 22. Proverbs 8 22 a beautiful picture I hope this don't stop with your church Proverbs 8 22 but I believe it's in the Bible this is why Jesus would say share with me the glory or give me the glory that you share with me before the foundation of the world Proverbs 8 22 and I want to have it right here before me because it's a long what I got right here the Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old I was set up from Everlasting from the beginning or or ever that Earth was who's this this is Jesus before the Earth ever was Jesus was there as a light as the logos as a theophany the church said theophany God had a theophany a spiritual body and that spiritual body was the sun it came out of the invisible when there was no depths I was brought forth when there were no fountains abounding with water before the mountains were settled before the hills was I brought forth oh my goodness Hallelujah well as yet he had not made the Earth nor the fields or the highest part of the Dust of the world when he prepared the heavens I was there this is speaking of God's spirit of wisdom this is speaking of the sun manifestation when he set a compass upon the face of the earth now look at that he put a compass on the face of a compass north south east and west when God put that that uh principle into place directions gravity magnetism Jesus said I was there Hallelujah somebody hope not when he established the clouds above when he strengthened The Fountains of the deep when he gave to the sea is decree that the water should not pass his commandment when he appoint the foundation of the earth then was I bought then was I by him as one brought up with him and I was daily his Delight rejoicing always before him rejoicing in the habitable part of his Earth and my Delights were with the sons of men so the Bible says Jesus's Spirit was there before the worlds remained before there ever was a mountain Jesus was Jesus was there the spirit of God before there was Oceans Jesus was there and when the first day of creation was there Jesus Jesus when the Earth was all finished guess who was there Jesus praise God Amen church and if he was there before all these things don't you think he's still here today to meet your needs praise God if he was there when everything was formed and if he could see all the great depths and all the great compass and and all the great uh dimensions of the Earth and the moon and all the things all the glory of the universe don't you think he's still here today to minister to you and have fellowship with you how many believe that Daley was Jesus God's Delight in other words the invisible was rejoicing in the visible manifestation the father was moving through the sun right and the Bible said I was as one brought him brought up with him I was always rejoicing before him if Jesus can Rejoice before the father how about the other children of God hallelujah hallelujah that's why Sunday I was a good day I'll tell you that was a good day for me rejoicing before the Lord amen that's what Jesus did before the foundation of the world praise God at the foundation world the low gospel is rejoicing before the invisible father oh may God help us to catch when we see God creating things in our lives amen when we see God moving things in our lives when we see God doing great things we ought to rejoice as well praise God ah just like the children of Israel praise God when they say God when they saw God working through their lives and making a highway through the sea praise God and bringing them through the sea when they saw their task Masters drown when they saw deliverance and victory they danced before the Lord they Rejoice before their father we ought to rejoice when God Moves In Our Lives hallelujah amen hallelujah because that's what Jesus did so when so when I Dance I mean like Jesus that's exactly right praise God hallelujah when you rejoice when you shout when you smile when you cry when You Weep when you glorify God you're being just like Jesus amen Hallelujah Rejoice him before the father let's stand our feet praise God I'm not going to finish Hallelujah what a balance it is musicians you can come what a balance it is I'm gonna make a video on this here pretty soon Trinity is so close but so far away do we understand that it's so close the sun was the Delight of the father before the foundation of the world in other words God looked down his son said I'm so proud of him and he's like Daddy look at me that's what the Bible says I was daily rejoicing then Jesus prayed said give me the glory like the glory we had before the foundation but it wasn't an eternal son neither is there an eternal death but at one point the sun came out of the father and now God could have fellowship with his son and don't stop there one day you came out of your father I'm not talking about the natural that's true too I'm talking about the spiritual Hallelujah one day God breathed the breath of life into your soul and you became a living soul and then you were birthed out of your mother and then God showed you his Mercy he showed you his love why so you rejoiced before him so you would love your father oh I'm getting this I'm getting hold of you I'm getting righteous Indonesian here tonight I might have to dance around here tonight Hallelujah glory amen he was always rejoicing before God how should we act towards our father we ought to Rejoice before God as well because God saw us we were in his mind and he knew we'd come forth in this time and God created us to have Battleship with him Tony appreciate his Fellowship praise God that's what God wants church he wants your fellowship in other words he said seek ye first my fellowship and all these things will be added unto you how do you believe that if you see God's Fellowship there's my 45 minutes 45 minutes if you seek my fellowship first I'll give you everything oh my goodness I'll give you everything you needed you just put me here how many want to do that I want to start each day and say thank you Lord for this beautiful day Rejoice before you have given me everything can I just Rejoice before you a little bit now you've been gracious and merciful that's exactly what Christ did rejoicing always for him let's bar heads here in church don't forget to remember in the book of well in the gospels Bob

things that come out of these you know I never I didn't see this coming in the service but out of a godhead sermon you think oh that's just kind of but out of this comes such a beautiful thought why are we rejoicing before our father or if we are we can say praise God I can Rejoice before my father because there's nothing in the past in the present or the future there's no principality there's no power there's no creature that can separate me from the love of God nothing can separate me from my life let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for today Lord you make these services so special dear
