TRANSCRIPT
========================================
anyone's not coming all right so let's read this here we'll have a word of I'm sorry we'll have you be seated by God's grace 1 Timothy 6:12 I'd like to uh preach a little simple to topic today called be a hero brother random said it 20 times be a hero I'm going to tie it in with that last sermon I preached on St Peter be a hero 1 Timothy 6:12 if you have that say amen amen let's read it on three one two three fight the good fight of Faith lay hold on eternal life where unto Thou Art also called and H has professed a good profession before many witnesses may God add his Blessing to ring of his word you can be seated there so I'd like to just briefly here uh case if you could switch over just want to go over the seven major Visions I I saw I was watching part of the sermon last night at uh Louisiana they have their fall meetings and uh I was watching I was watching the sermon and Pastor Tim puit mentioned this and I thought it was a good reminder with the driverless cars U brother brand had seven major visions of 1933 now of course this wasn't on tape he said uh he got the Visions on the morning when he was going to dedicate the Tabernacle and uh he said it was was a spring morning and of course in those days I don't think he had a recorder in 1933 um so he prophesied these and uh he said he said such sharp things that uh he said he was threatened with arrest because of what he said about these first three he was threatened with arrest but of course God protected him and uh you know uh I proved it I I found a quote brother brah was in the 1960s and he says who remembers who is here uh when I first prophesied those in 1933 he said oh look at the hands there was a couple hands so 30 years after brother R prophesied them there were still a few people that were could say I was there when he said it and you can hear him say amens that's what I shared with all those who doubt the message they I said brother B had witnesses there Hallelujah now um look at this this is from 20 this is from 2015 I preached this look at that now we got Cala but you know I now church I I i' I've been attacked I've been mocked and ridic ridiculed because I only believe the first three are fulfilled and that's fine people can believe whatever they want wherever you take a stand you're going to get criticized brother man said if you're not being criticized something's wrong because the devil is going to be after you if you're doing what's right Hallelujah so if you don't have any critics brother man said that's not a good sign and even Jesus said that if all men Praise You something's wrong I'm paraphrasing that verse anyways the reason I say I I didn't believe the fourth was fulfilled was because these these prophecies were so detailed everyone in the world could not deny a single detail of them right and so uh so that's why I I never believe the fourth was actually fulfilled yet because if it was like the other three it would be undeniable and if this if this last one is fulfilled it's going to be nuclear that's going to be undeniable right undeniable if uh when it's fulfilled okay so that's why I believe we we're only at the third that's what I believe and I could be wrong now there are quotes where brother Bram says he he thinks some of these are fulfilled right but I even showed you a quote from no it was uh November 63 where brother said it's not a woman that's going to rule he said it's a church so we have quotes on both sides it could be a woman a vice president or president he said but in one quote he says it's not a woman it's a church it's the Roman Catholic church so it's just like the Bible it's just like Zechariah God showed Zechariah all these dreams and the angel said do you know what these mean he's like no Lord you know right they're giving Visions they just say what the vision showed and then brother R would spend the rest of his life trying to say well this looks like it that what is he trying to do he's getting trying to get the people ready for the Rapture amen amen right we're just trying to look and see uh the Fulfillment of scripture you know we had a a good brother uh I maybe I shouldn't call his name I won't call his name but he a good brother used to come to our church and he he came to me and said brother Jesse he said he said uh brother Ram uh was quoting Matthew 24 and where Jesus said all these things will come to pass and the generation shall not pass that sees these things come to pass and that was the Fig Tree putting forth its buds right and brother Braham said that was fulfilled in the church age book right so brother Braham said a generation or Jesus said a generation won't pass till all these things are fulfilled so the brother asked me this was back in 20 would have been 2015 again right along when I preached this and he said do you think brother Ram meant that prophetically and I said no because there's no thus sayith the Lord behind it because it's it's been how many years right since Israel has been a nation it was 1948 when they became a nation we passed many we passed more than a generation brother brandham had his son's rise right Joseph Billy Paul Joseph is an old man now he's he's almost 69 he'll be 69 this coming year and then he has children and he has grandchildren right so we passed more than one generation and so see what what I'm trying to say is that each man of God is trying to do his best to look at the scripture and see where are we at in Prophecy Hallelujah and we're doing our best but see what what the point I'm making is all these three were so incredibly Vindicated no one can deny them that they happened so with Elon must bringing out his cars this year well elon's looks way better than that one but that does look like a egg shape kind of uh let me go down to the quote here I got all these preaches back in 2015 maybe I'll preach this again here it's been quite a while it's good to uh and look back in 2015 I was preaching on Russia with Wars right that's why I knew when these people said oh the sign of Russia and 2023 is a war I knew that wasn't the sign of the Rapture right because they've been go they've been having Wars right that was back in 2015 uh there's a new sheriff in the Middle East Putin uh it's neat to go back and uh it's neat to go back and see how God has guided us amen he's uh spoke to us now the fourth Vision showed a great advances in science that would come after the second world war it was headed up in the vision so the very head of this the very climax of this vision is a plastic bubble toop car that was running down beautiful highways under remote control so that people appeared seated in this car without a steering wheel and that's what elon's cars came out this week no steering wheel and they were playing some sort of a game to Muse Muse themselves and my wife saw it to they had four chairs and the four the two chairs on one side two on the other they're facing each other now they just got to get something in the middle there cuz if the other three were precisely with the vision this it has to happen just that way in this time too every detail of the vision must come to pass oh sorry wrong one I clicked the wrong button and I said just before the time comes that automobiles which was built that old straight back 20 years ago 25 years ago you remember the 20 years anyhow I said they look like an egg they'll be shaped that's a vision be something on the shape of something like that so something like the shape of an egg in other words aerodynamic not straight like look at the pictures from the 1920s their cars they were like long rectangular prisms that's just they little top like kind of two like two rectangles on top of each other what do we got today uh he says that's right and that's the way they'll be just before the Rapture amen hallelujah and I said now also to come to pass that before the end time will come automobiles will be taken on the shape of an egg become more like an egg and I saw an American Family driving down a highway in a car like that they were sitting facing one another had a table they're like playing checkers or cars they didn't have any steering wheel in the car and it was controlled by some power without a steering wheel how many members me prophesying that so it's been prophesied Hallelujah and uh Elon said 2026 now we've been following these uh driverless cars now for many years I think they started around 2018 2017 somewhere in there uh and the the the the the Google guy said I'll be having my son driverless car by 2020 well look it's been four years that didn't happen so I I'm not saying Elon will be right in 20 2026 but we're just getting closer by God's grace we're getting much closer so it's interesting to see that by God's grace now uh brother said he saw him at the world's fair but remember they had to be driving on American Highway and then there's quotes where brother Ram says they don't even have the highways yet right so brother R there's quotes brother says we don't have the highways yet uh and we haven't seen them yet we haven't seen the every detail the vision come to pass so we're looking for that praise God that's what I'm looking for Hallelujah okay so I just went through and then the fifth Vision I'll just X out of that now so just so you can see that again I believe we're right there and I believe these can come to pass brother Bram said he said all the scriptures that need to be fulfilled before the Rapture he said could come to pass in hours so the scriptures we need to come to pass this this is Advance in science right Daniel prophesied of that Hallelujah the advances in science right increase of knowledge right that's been prophesied the moral problem around women right uh and that was headed up in a woman just wearing a fig Leaf over her uh loin area right nothing on the top that was headed up and this was headed up in a woman ruling with a iron Rod Over America now we don't like to say it but that's why I voted I voted this week I did an absente ballot I hope you'll vote too because we don't know we can we could Escape Our Generation hallelujah our generation could Escape that's why I vote Hallelujah and people died so we could vote that's another reason I vote men and women died so we could have these Liberties Hallelujah and then of course uh the bomb now I don't know where that is in the scripture uh because the Beast out of the land is revelation 13 the Beast lays down the mark but then we don't hear anything more about the Beast so don't not I'm not quite sure where in the scripture the Beast is destroyed I don't know but I'm going to keep searching hallelujah it's got to be in there somewhere Hallelujah because it's thus sayith the Lord hallelujah now so we we see kind of where we are uh by the grace of God now I'm going to switch over uh you can just put some scriptures up here and uh in a little bit I'll switch back over okay because I have some I want to show something here uh by God's grace kind of ties in with the the sermon today all right that's that's my introduction that's not my sermon I haven't started preaching yet this is now my start of my preaching Hallelujah so I want to preach on be a hero you know months ago I that's kind of how I I operate I'll catch an inspired thought and then I'll just email it to myself s and that email will just sit in my inbox until I start going through looking for some inspiration and then I'll preach it kind of like uh the God who sees on Wednesday night that email sat in my inbox for two months until I preached it I just look for the right inspiration at the right time so did this email uh two months ago I heard brother brandom say be a hero what is a hero who knows what a hero is it's an illustrious Warrior so a warrior who has many amazing accomplishments who's fought many battles another def definition is a person admired for achievements and Noble qualities remember don't have to be great achievements of the world it's got to be achievements in the spiritual realm hallelujah it's not great achievements in the world because the Bible calls that foolishness I read through 1 Corinthians uh chapters 1 through 4 yesterday and the Bible talks about the foolishness of The World God has made it foolishness the world right God makes them fools and uh and God's people are wise Hallelujah so we see that it's it's a hero who's admired for achievements and Noble qualities so what better qualities could there be than the character of Jesus Christ that's a hero someone who has the character of Jesus Christ it's one who shows great courage so I just looked at uh Webster's Dictionary and those were the the three there's like five definitions those are the three that I think apply to us hallelujah so church we want to have great courage Hallelujah we want to have the noble qualities in other words we want to have the character of Christ and we want to achieve something for the glory of God what did Paul say Paul said I fought a good fight he said I fought the fight of Faith Hallelujah so we can see Paul was a hero he fought to give the faith to others to share the Faith with others and he also fought that he would keep the faith in the face of blasphemy because he did it ignorantly Hallelujah and then God empowered him God said in a Ministry God called him in a Ministry that Jesus might reveal himself in Paul hallelujah amen what is the will of God for your life that Christ would reveal himself in your life Hallelujah in other words that you would be Christ for somebody else Hallelujah and we don't want to miss just the Simplicity of it that we could uh manifest Christ to the people around us that's all God's asking us to do right is Manifest Jesus Christ to the people around us hallelujah what did Jesus say the greatest among you were the richest no do you say the greatest among you were the smartest everybody see where I'm going the greatest among you were the handsomest or the prettiest no the greatest among you were the servants someone who tried to help somebody's life and make it a little better Hallelujah so see it's it's so it's so easy to be I should say God's made it so easy so we can be heroes all we got do is open our eyes and open our ears and look at people around us who needs help I'll step in and help them now you're a hero right hallelujah amen Jesus said it's not going to be so that you rule and you Lord over the people he said but the greatest among you should be the servants amen hallelujah that's what the scripture tells us hallelujah and so we're thankful for the word of God it's been so been so precious to us how many want to be a servant praise God yeah thank you man okay yeah so we walked in here sorry it was kind of hot in here we walked in here it was cold my children were cold so I cranked up the heat and then we all come in here and now we're super hot so let's go back down to cold so forgive me now I want to just I want to just do a few minutes on Peter I I didn't get to all the scriptures on Peter from two Wednesdays ago I sure enjoyed that that was such a blessing to me uh to see how God redeemed brother Peter Hallelujah Glory now let me I got a little note here I want to pull up yeah Mal I found a good note from scoffield I want to pull up he come right after service said Daddy look at this note I don't know if he called me Daddy but he called me dad Daddy's the old way he used to say it when he was little but remember Peter was uh and I want you to think about this think of how Peter became a hero church if Peter be could could become a hero any of us could become a hero I don't know if you heard me if Peter became a hero any of us could be a hero that's a little better just because of the the depths of failure that he failed to there could be there there could uh be very few depths fall as low as Peter fell right I mean Abraham lied right he lied on God he lied about his wife he laughed at God but Abraham never walked in his way and said I don't even know God I don't even know I don't even know him that's what Peter did Peter said I don't even know the Lord Jesus I have no idea who he is imagine if that happened to you on your job somebody said are you one of those message Holy Ghost Believers no I don't even know Pastor Jesse who who what Pastor what I don't even know that guy that guy's who most people say who but you know put your name in there brother V you go to brother vang's church I don't even know him who I mean that's the depths of depravity that that Peter fell into amen but God never left him there Hallelujah and church no matter where you fall you don't have to stay there Hallelujah God's writing a story hallelujah hallelujah be a hero Hallelujah but remember Peter started his life it was a hopeless life so he started if if there's an arc L told me about stories have arcs so I'm going to learn some new language now stories have arcs so if you if you look at Peter's Arc it started low he was hopeless just a fisherman there was no uh big retirement for fisherman in those days the retirement was we put you the six feet under the ground right that's your retirement you don't get to relax and well oh no now I'm now I'm living free no they were under the Roman government and taxes kept going up and the church said man my taxes went up on my house this year I'm like are you kidding me and then the all the uh utilities just went up I ever see that my utilities went up about almost 2 30% even for the church I mean every everywhere it's all going up he was in a hopeless situation but then one day a man walked by and said you're Simon the son of son of Jonas Hallelujah and I'm going to make you a fisher of men Hallelujah so see that must have been a discernment he must have known there's more to life than fishing there's more to and my dad told me about the Messiah all those years remember I dramatized with Malachi one day there's coming a messiah one day oh yeah d Dad yeah I know yeah now now pull up that net you know so in the midst of all they're working with the Nets he's telling about the Messiah but one day the Messiah come by I know who your dad was and I'm changing your name from Simon to Peter amen hallelujah your life's going to take a drastic turn and it did for three and a half years it's just kept greater and greater and greater Hallelujah we saw Peter was naturally impulsive he was a spur of the- moment kind of guy and sometimes that word worked out for him really good sometimes it didn't but see God works with all of us with our personal uh personality brother random said you know God married your grandpa to your grandma and your mother your father just to get you so you would have a certain testimony that's what brother said he he he uh he brought them all together he he said it like a bell he said you put this metal with a bell and that metal and it makes a certain ring he said that's what God did for you hallelujah amen amen right brother said he chose the color of hair amen he chose the color of your eyes he chose your skin color he chose male or female God chose that Hallelujah God's the best Chooser Hallelujah he's the Potter amen where're the clay Hallelujah God knows exactly where you are amen hallelujah God knows exactly what you're going through he's right with you Hallelujah he never left you he knew you before you were formed in the womb Hallelujah no don't you know he knows prophecy right now don't you don't you know he knows where we're at on the Rapture timeline don't you think he knows where we are in those seven major Visions I'm not saying I'm right I'm just saying God knows all things we we we uh we see through a glass Darkly amen but one day brother CLA Hallelujah one day uh brother Patrick one day we'll see Jesus face to face Hallelujah and then we'll know even as we're known of him we'll get a new name too Hallelujah I I like my name because it's a Bible name but if you don't like your name you'll get a new name Hallelujah God will bless you you know he was so impulsive he went he he went uh you know he went from let me walk on the water to Fallen till he walked back to the boat he went to uh he went to sing a vision then saying let's build three Tabernacles and then Jesus or God's voice stopped him right there and said we're not building a denomination around here hallelujah and then he was so uh spontaneous he jumped into the sea after the resurrection but make sure he put on his clothes before he jumped on the sea he had to get those modest clothes on before he went to church Hallelujah and I appreciate I want to appreciate that you know when I preach that we had some guests here and I just want to thank I just want to thank the church you know when we have guests here I really try to uh I try not to go so deep in certain aspects of the message because I know they can't handle it right and I'm trying to ad minister to them so I appreciate you know how you everybody's real patient with me I'm just I just try to be led by the Holy Spirit CU I know when I first come in the message uh brother van almost every sermon was going over my head I couldn't catch much of it so I want to be a little bit I want to be balanced I want to give the the people that have been here a while I want to give them some deep things but also I want to make sure I give some food I want to give some morsels to our newcomers by God's grace right like those uh Paige and her mom remember that and those girls are so sweet and church she come up for prayer weeping saying pray for me I need to be healed you know so she trusted me that much after just a humble sermon where I tried to just balance it out you know not I didn't say brother Ram said brother bam said brother Ram said brother said brother I didn't say that I tried to balance it out by God's grace so I'm thankful that you're patient with me and you try to understand that and I I know you are but I just want to take a moment and thank you for understanding that I try to be sensitive to who's here and uh give give them something that they could receive as well and then uh Peter went from saying Lord you're not going to wash me at all you'll never wash me to wash all of me amen how many say Jesus wash all of me amen he went from uh he went he went from saying you've got the keys you've got a revelation to get behind me Satan pretty spontaneous isn't it quite a quite a change you got the keys brother but then brother get behind me Satan it's it was just such a a such a up and down type of experience but brother Ram said see the reason he did this because he had not been up to Pentecost but Ram said when he went up to Pentecost he put on the full armor of God hallelujah so see church and look and I just thought it was so special Peter wrote this over here and remember on the night of the Betrayal he lost this he lost all this he lost this the only thing he had left was this and he even said he denied that and who's the one that wrote this Peter Peter knew what it's like to gain the anointing and lose the anointing Peter knew that and the only reason brother Austin he stayed is because Jesus said I prayed for you that your faith wouldn't fail hallelujah amen that's the only reason cuz everything else he lost he wasn't concerned about his brother wasn't even concerned about his Lord he lost his patience right he took that sword and tried to cut off malus's ear he lost everything knowledge he I don't know Jesus I I'm not one of them he lost his virtue he couldn't stand up publicly right virtue he couldn't stand up publicly and be a real believer he lost all that but then he says that's the way you get right with God you build those anointings amen you go from glory to glory amen from anointing to anointing until you're capped off and he was capped off on the day of Pentecost and then he had on the armor of God hallelujah amen but don't forget all the good things he had power over Devils he had revelation of the of of Christ from the father he made those two notable statements uh he he uh he gave us he gave us some of the most beautiful uh statements that could ever be made he said to whom shall we go thou Hast the words of eternal life I still quote that today when people say you're G to leave the message I'm like where am I going to go of course I'm not going to leave the message the message came to me I didn't go looking for the message God came to me Hallelujah some of you were blessed notice some of you were blessed to be born in it now don't leave I wasn't born in it God brought me in it Hallelujah you're blessed if you're bornn in it I wish I would have been born in it praise God it would have saved me a lot of Heartache amen but God has a testimony God's got a story for me God's got a story for you so Peter was used to say two of the most beautiful notable statements that's ever been uttered Hallelujah Upon This Rock I'll build my church of course that was Jesus telling that but then he also uh he also had the most worst cowardly denial of Faith also think about that he had the greatest words and then also some of the most cowardly words everybody see the contrast did you ever see that in your life some days you're on the Mountaintop some days you're lower than a skunk's belly right Peter has some of the most quoted words Upon This Rock I'll build my church where will we go thou has the words of eternal life but he's also got the lowest words I don't even know the man no I don't know him see sometimes our life is a life of contrast it would be nice right brother Claude if everything was always good all the time it'd be nice if you never made any mistakes right brother Patrick I'll just use you guys up here right Mali it'd be nice if you never made a mistake but the reality of it is sometimes we embarrass ourselves sometimes we don't make a good real good Christian testimony but is that the end of the story no it's just the beginning praise God Peter had both highs and lows and imagine his Lydia I imagine his story arc was one of these but I'm going I'm just going to give a generalization of it though I'm just going to give a general you're going to see it in a little bit because this is all inspired thanks to you hun of course and all the things I've been studying so he has some of the greatest statements but he also has some of the most embarrassing statements cowardly denying that c he even knew Christ imagine that so see church it's it's it's something we have to keep in mind and remember God used him in some of the greatest ways 3,000 Souls saved he gave the the key to the Jews Gentiles Samaritans he raised a paralyzed man at the gate of beautiful now we'd all like to do that but would you also like to deny Christ in front of your family and go through that pain and suffering I wouldn't want to deny Christ you know his shadow I think I did that with me where's my shadow yeah here's my he just he just went through my shadow there's my shadow is that okay buddy a man would just a sick man would be in the shadow of Peter and he'd rise up and get healed Hallelujah but he also had to go through the dark days those days of denial of Christ such amazing highs such amazing testimonies but such a low fall God has a story God's got a story for you my prayer is God help me not to fall hallelujah amen amen but God's got to let some people fall to show his grace Amen to show his Amazing Grace Hallelujah that you can't fall too far from the hand of God if you're an elect child of God you can't fall too far but what God will pick you up and raise you up hallelujah amen he raised Tabitha from the dead by the power of God hallelujah and then he wrote two Epistles and showed us the way for charity the way to show the love of Christ you know what we need Church you know what you need more anointing you know what I need more anointing Hallelujah that's what we need Hallelujah Peter says and Peter says if we don't live in that anointing we start forgetting am I forgiven or not am I a Christian or not am I a real believer or not am I going in the Rapture or not when the church said if we don't keep adding that anointing I'm talking to our human Spirit now your soul is capped off with Charity your Soul's capped off with that uh that Soul can never sin 1 John 3:9 the seed of God remains you it cannot sin but in your mind you got to keep that anointing in your mind or else you're going to forget who you are Hallelujah you're the bride of Christ amen you're the children of God you're God's beloved Hallelujah you are heirs to all of God's covenant promises amen and God will never break a covenant brother Vang hallelujah it's impossible Hallelujah God can never break a promise Hallelujah he said the New Covenant he said I'll write the word of God I'll write it on the fleshly tables of your heart how many got the word on your hearts today Hallelujah that's his promise amen he said I'll do that by the blood of Jesus Christ I'll let the spirit of God write the word of God upon the fleshly tables of your heart so you'll be a written epistle known and read of all men you're a letter of recommendation that this word is real Hallelujah the Gospel of Jesus Christ is the most powerful thing on the face of the Earth Hallelujah is that right glory and what's the greatest expression of it love it's love Peter was uh this one I didn't go over Peter was very self-sacrificing Mark 1:18 Jesus walked by Peter and said I'm going to make you a fisher of men Mark 1118 and straightway they forsook their Nets and foued him look he's in the middle of work it's it's like Austin he's in the middle of dog training all of a sudden Jesus come around said follow me he's like all right uh can you guys take the dogs see you right he's like in the middle of pulling the Nets and uh you younger guys take these nuts I'm going with Jesus spur of the moment that worked out for him that time Hallelujah right he could do that he could say I'm leaving this I'm done I'm following Jesus see this was the kind of faith that he had this when when when it was anointed my it was so powerful but when he lost said anointing it was disgraceful and I'm saying that for me too all of us when that anointing of our mind leaves church we can be disgraceful to the name of Christ but that doesn't mean the story's over Hallelujah it doesn't mean that Hallelujah and you don't want to get in a spot where Satan beat you up over things like that you got to remember his grace the Bible said he's rich in Mercy the Bible said he forgives all iniquities Hallelujah that that's the worst one that would affect us is Iniquity cuz we know what we did wrong but the David said blessed is a man whom the Lord will not impute iniquities Hallelujah if anybody knew iniquity it was David Hallelujah Matthew 19:27 honey can you pull this up here seem like I can't get my glasses clean too much sweat so we see that he was so uh he was so self-sacrificing at times but then other times he was concerned about the rewards and I've always wondered I've heard preachers say this I've always wondered how did Peter say Matthew 19:27 did I get get the wrong one there you go Jesus is talking about all the rewards you that the apostles are going to get no I'm sorry he was talking about all the rewards the Rich Young Ruler could have got but then Peter answered and said behold we've forsaken everything he in other words I left my wife I left my job to preach just to preach and go from town to town and live off the offerings of these women think about that they were living off the offerings of the women Joanna and different ones I left my my moneymaking business I left my income we forsaken all and we follow thee what shall we have therefore so I wonder how he asked this did he ask it real humble like Lord we've less or they ask Lord what do we get sometimes that's what we get God when am I going to get my blessing when I've done all this I imagine it was the second one but I don't know I hope it was the humble way but it doesn't matter because we all because you it doesn't matter because Jesus answered the way he did look at the answer Jesus gives and Jesus said to them verily I say to you truly that ye which have followed me in the Regeneration Glory the Millennium when the son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory ye shall sit upon 12 Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel what do we get Lord you get a future reward not so much now right now he said they would get a hundredfold of friends but look look what his life ended he ended as a martyr it wasn't a happy luxurious picnic kind of life look what he got here Jesus so it doesn't matter how Peter asked it maybe it was real sincere maybe it was a little selfish but Jesus tells him here's what you're going to get if you follow because you've left everything you're going to judge in the Millennium Church no wonder brother R said we we don't even understand how important it is to live in the Millennium you get to live if you overcome now you get to live as a leader in the millennium people are are going people are going to be looking up to you in a better way than look up to you know Mike dwine or uh you know Bo Joe Biden or Camala or Trump or whoever it is or Barack Obama God is going to make the believer something like that but greater because most of these men are corrupt most of these women are corrupt but you won't be corrupt because you'll be in a brand new body Hallelujah a perfect glorified body hallelujah amen that cannot sin and this is the promise you've forsaken all because you've suffered a little in this life the next life is going to be so amazing remember the Bible said if we can just suffer through our light burdens right then we then we'll be able to understand the Eternal weight of Glory so what's the weight of Glory for him you get to sit and judge 12 tribes for a thousand years you're the judge because you saw the word of God you left everything to support the word of God and God can use that character to rule in the future millennial hallelujah amen now I want to go through uh seven scriptures uh I found this in uh I found this in the Thompson Chain concordance brother R said he wished he he said he always had a scoffield Bible he wished he would have had a Thompson Chain concordance because he said he could have found the Bible studies faster I don't know if you've seen that video I put out lately but that was good so uh let let's start this Thompson Chain look listen Church there's seven steps in Peter's fall seven steps and at any time he could have repented of that right anytime so think about the moments where you've struggled there was many warning signs there's there there's at least six warning signs he could have he could have found out he could have said oh no God forgive me I'm coming back but there's seven steps to his fall the first one is conceit Matthew 26:33 Matthew 26:33 maybe I can oh you're fast good job Peter answered said to him though all men shall be offended because of thee yet will I never be offended and we know just a few hours later he was offended right I always stand for this message I'll never deny brother Rand I always believe the truth of the Gospel will you be careful some of these guys I've heard around the message not our church but other churches they said I know I'm going to live to the Rapture I've been watching their lives because they're getting up there they're in their 60s they said they got it one guy at cam Church uh he left cam church one guy there said uh God revealed to me I'm I'm I'm not going to die I'm going to go in the Rapture well guess what I'm watching his life and the way he's lived already I don't think he's telling the truth because a tree is known by its fruit but look at these boasts what does it start off with a boast I I'll do this right conceit Pride right and pride goeth before the next is uh Matthew 26:40 after conceit he gets an ease he says would could you not watch with with me one hour so first he's Pride prideful and then he can't pray for Jesus like he ought to and Jesus even says you know I wanted you to pray for me he said but you should have prayed that you had not got into temptation so here because he's prideful and he's too lazy or tired here he he misses his chance to overcome the Temptation because that's what Pride does it makes you lazy on God well I'm the greatest of all time you have to pray tonight don't have to pray tomorrow don't have to read your Bible see how Pride does that to you that's why I love that example from Mark chapter 1 right after Jesus healed an entire multitude the Bible said he got up very early in the morning to go pray to his father that's one of the most beautiful verses about humility in other words you could have a whole day of Miracles but what would you do the first the next morning Jesus got up early and went to go pray that's the key to to to uh service right humble not being proud PR prideful conceited at ease the next is rashness John 1810 And1 John 18101 so first he was conceited prideful then he was at ease little lazy didn't want to pray then next is rash then Simon Peter having a sword drew it smokee the high priest servant cut off his right ear the servant's name was malus then said Jesus unto Peter put up thy sword and thy sheath the cup which my father give me shall I not drink it so we also see violence right he almost killed somebody so it goes from Pride to laziness to Violent anger and murder almost murder just a few hours after saying I'll never leave you Lord I'll never do anything I always stand for you and then now look after this act here of of violence notice he follows a far off so he starts wandering from Jesus he's not close to Jesus he's too afraid to be close to Jesus so he wanders away Matthew 2658 Matthew 26:58 but Peter foued him AAR off under the high priest's Palace and went in and sat with the servants to see the end why wasn't he right up there with the right up with Jesus Lord I'm praying for you Lord I'm right with you you've been with me through every trial I'll be right there but no he's just following just see how close he can get before he gets into trouble see he's distan himself from the word of God God help us to stay true to the word of God Amen look at this Sevenfold fall conceit ease violence rashness falling a far off next is evil associations John 18:18 be careful who you hang around with church be careful who you hang around with sometimes it better to be alone with Jesus than with people that are going to tear your faith down and really when you're with Jesus like I said you're with the majority praise God you're in better company with Jesus than you be with a bunch of Sinners Hallelujah and the Servants of the officer stood there who had made a fire of for it was cold and they warmed themselves and Peter stood with them and warmed himself so see he's he's over with evil associations with all these people that are against Jesus he's in a Jewish home it's Caiaphas his court it's his house and there's an outer Court you know and he's out there with them just warming himself by the fire evil associations see what sin does it puts you with the wrong people you get violent get angry get murderous now we get we can get angry with our words right angry with our thoughts but he gets around the wrong crowd number six is open denial uh it's John 18:18 no I'm sorry I wrote that WR down wrong no go to the next verse after that maybe it's 19 I might write down the wrong one okay oh wow they start talking about Doctrine hey that's what we'd be good at Hallelujah verse 20 okay now 21 I think I'm on the not on the right track here I wrot I didn't write down the right verse yeah here it is there it is thank you there it is hallelujah bless your heart and Simon Peter stood and warmed himself they said therefore to himart thou also one of the disciples he denied it and said I am not now here's what Malachi found from Scofield scoffield said Peter was sleeping while his master was praying think about that his master needed prayer and he couldn't even pray for him Church like I've told you if you don't have strength enough to pray long prayer just bow your head real simply in your car or just bow your head before you go to bed just say a simple prayer one minute of prayer would be better than no prayer Hallelujah God can hear that I've seen like I told you I've seen God answered my prayer is just driving home when I barely got strength to drive home I'm tired I'm exhausted I just pray in the car driving for that person and then I hear back later God answered the prayer because if I don't pray in the car brother Austin I'm probably gonna forget right because life so Peter was sleeping while his master was praying he was resisting while his master was submitting see is Jesus was submitting to arrest and Peter's resisting that arrest cuz he remember he didn't believe the plan of God Peter's like oh you're never going to go die you're never he said get behind me Satan see that Peter was resisting the will of God oh God help us to just submit to the will of God third he foued a far off and he sat down amongst his enemies so now you're joining the anti-age group sitting with the anti- message people people oh my goodness look at this and then lastly church I like this scoffield said Peter denied his Lord he denied his faith and he denied the Brotherhood of Christ he said I am not he denied it next verse 26 one of the servants said did I not see thee in the garden with him verse 27 he denied it again and immediately the crew now other other uh B gospels say I don't even know Christ I don't even know him how could anyone get any lower than this and yet God wasn't done with him God was going to make Peter a hero hallelujah amen glory to God God's not done with us church I'll say like that God's not done with you and I hallelujah hallelujah God did so much more through Peter now I want to go back to First Timothy now I'm going to transition into be a hero the word lay a hold on eternal life 1 Timothy 6:12 fight the good fight of Faith lay hold on eternal life brother William it means to rescue from Peril to help or secure so when you fight the good fight of faith and you lay a hold on eternal life you've rescued something so we got to look at we have to look at our Christian Life like I'm going to go out and rescue people from hell and even myself the Bible says with your own uh with with the will I'm not talking about God's sovereignty now God God knew everybody who is saved I'm talking about in the Battle of your Freemore agency the Bible says save yourselves from that untour generation Hallelujah in other words in your Human Experience it's like you don't know all of God's sovereignty so you're just doing your best with your own freeor agency you're trying to be a hero you're trying to be saved yourself you're trying to save others Hallelujah that's the attitude we have to have fight the good fight of faith and be a hero for Christ Hallelujah lay a hold of eternal life it means take possession of it I'm going to go remember the Bible Jesus said the violent take the kingdom by force amen so there's there there there's a there's a perspective we have to have as Believers I'm going to go take that I'm going to have eternal life I'm going to make the Rapture amen hallelujah I'm going to go try to save that person I want to make a difference in their life Hallelujah I want to be a hero praise God I'm want to lay a hold of eternal life Hallelujah but it's going to be a fight right it's not going to be easy it's going to be a fight Hallelujah but that's what we must do we must lay a hole we must fight for eternal life Hallelujah and see a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways but the Holy Ghost solves the problem Hallelujah the the the day of Pentecost for Peter it solved all his problems Hallelujah now did you have little mistakes yes you know he separated himself from the Gentiles he had little mistakes like that but he got corrected Hallelujah I'll say like this he no longer denied his Lord to the point when they were going to kill him he said don't crucify me the right way turn me upside down I'm not worthy no wonder he said that amen I'm not worthy to die like my Lord hallelujah that's the kind of faith that he had now that he was born again praise God he said I I can't die like my Lord I'm not worthy to die like him so put me upside down that's the kind of character that was the change in Peter's life Hallelujah I want to show something here now let me uh I sure hope this works okay can you switch over when you get a chance now L you forgive me if I get this wrong I'll take a lesson afterwards okay not a Bible Lesson a literary lesson so in stories they have what's called character arcs the characters go through different changes right you know that Austin's nodded I didn't know this until recently but this is what I see Peter's rise and fall you know he started in in the very depths of being a fisherman no way out there's you're trapped in here it's a cast system your life will never be good to spiritually he became rich but then he go to a he went to his lowest fall denying even the Lord that saved him but what did God do God redeemed his story go God made him the spokesman on the day of Pentecost amen I baptized 17 Austin you were there I thought I was going to die I was so tired he had 3,000 baptized amen hallelujah the book of Acts amen was You by who the man who is as low as he could possibly go our God is a great Redeemer hallelujah amen he can stoop to the lowest depths in order to give us hope redeem us change our story hallelujah amen I love it praise God now church I I don't have this one up there but L I hope my story is a ragster riches story the rags of riches just goes like this right in other words I don't want to fall like Peter fell Hallelujah I don't want to deny the message I don't want to deny no people in the church I don't want to I I I know Jesus I want to just go from richers to more riches amen I want to go from glory to glory From Grace to Grace Hallelujah now that's not a very exciting story but it's still a story and as long as Jesus is writing our story that's all that matters Hallelujah as long as he redeems us and gives us the story that we need praise God I believe some of these message preachers that have fallen over the years this is what I hope this is what I I hope happens I'm talking about the ones that have done you know some disgrace this is what I hope happens by God's grace it's always been my prayer God keep me from this great fall right now some of you know Judas Judas would have been oh yeah so uh this is a rise Then Fall then so Peter's story is a rise Then Fall then rise story you see it all the time in movies and you shouldn't see it in movies sorry you don't see it in movies because you don't watch movies unless you watch Christian movies and then you limit those uh but then Judas is like this Judas started really low of course Jew you know in the Roman system he raised really high and then that's the rise and the fall see everybody has a different story I like that Chris Toler song I Will Rise when he calls my name no more sorrow no more pain I will rise On Eagle's Wings before my God and stand I'll rise Hallelujah but you see judas's story never Rose said all he had to do was go repent to Jesus but instead he ended his life like there was no hope for it Jesus is the very personification of Hope amen all he had to do is go back to Jesus and even in Peter's case Peter denied more than Judas did Peter as far as we know didn't even go back it's Jesus went looking for him Hallelujah and he said if you love me feed my sheep that's what I'm trying to do today I'm trying to feed somebody the word of God today how many enjoy the word of God today is it is it taste good amen it's a word and due season be a hero for Christ Hallelujah now I didn't have time but I wanted to get through I we we could show Solomon's Arc you know Solomon's would have been like uh he started high high down and then up at the end that's he had a real bad downfall and then maybe just had a little rising at the end he wrote Ecclesiastes that was his finishing story there it's all vanity fear God and keep his commands Hallelujah deep great great deep fall but he had a huge rise you know I say maybe he started here and there for a long time he had a little more of a Arc there now I want to get to this quote brother Ram uses the quote 20 times uh be a hero now I'm going to go in reverse so can't read it brother William you be familiar with this brother random quotes Henry Wadsworth Longfellow we live next near to Wadsworth so I thought it was pretty inspiring not really brother random uses this brother William from 1952 all the way to a few months before he died there's times in the sermon brother's talking about usually at the end of the sermon he's just talking about not giving up he's talking about going through trials being resilient amen being perseverance hallelujah amen uh I'm going to show you some quotes just do something for God he says remember you have a story you're on Earth for a purpose amen and you want to bless as many people as you can bless Hallelujah you in other words you want to be a hero for as many people as you can Hallelujah not pull them down not destroy them not discourage them you want to encourage them amen as a hero Hallelujah right the hero comes along right when you need him the most right that's what we want to be we want to be a hero to somebody so brother bar he'll quote this at least well I should say maybe around 19 or but at least 20 times he says be a hero brother Henry wodsworth Longfellow was a very famous poet uh he was lived in the 1800s and then American schools think about this I wish this was true Patrick American schools learned his poems because he was a Christian man the Bible used to be the most important book it would have been the only book in the schools but then they started introducing these and and then Mary had a little lamb That was supposed to be off of Mary and Jesus now Jesus is not even in the story how do I know because I'm in the schools I try to bring him in there in the mornings before school try to bring Jesus in but brother Ram had this uh some of this poem memorized not all of it I I didn't find where he memorized the whole thing but let's just read through this I want you to hear what brother Ram says about it so this is called a Psalm of Life so a song of Life what the heart of the young man said to the psalmist so there's a young man and he's saying this to a songwriter here's what a young man would say tell me not in mournful numbers life is but an empty dream so don't tell me life's empty right don't tell me life is useless brother man quotes this for the soul is dead that Slumbers and things are not what they seemen right so we we don't want a dead Soul that's the Sinners right the Sinners have dead Souls uh Peter or Paul said uh those women are dead while they're alive right they live in pleasure a woman that lives in pleasure is dead while she's alive she's a spiritual zombie right life is real life is earnest and the grave is not its goal sometimes I feel like paying for me get in the grave is my goal Insurance brother talked about insurance to get in the in the ground maybe wasn't funny sorry dust Thou Art to dust return was not spoken of the Soul right see in other words I got to pay all this insurance money to get if my if I die to get my my body in the ground but that's not what life is about life's about the soul Hallelujah remember brother BR is being taught this as a little boy now Little Billy brandham you repeat after me now right do I sound like a first grade teacher not enjoyment and not sorrow is our destined end or way but to act that each tomorrow find us farther than today Hallelujah in other words we should act every day to make tomorrow a little better praise God and the way you do that is pray today seek God today tomorrow is going to be a lot better Hallelujah and brother Ram quotes this he could quote this from memory the importance of learning the scripture memorizing this the word of God he remembered this from a child in school he only went to eth grade right was it eth grade or seventh grade who remembers Supernatural story was it seven might have been seven my dad would only to seventh or eighth grade that's why I get him confused my dad my dad dropped out at eth grade I think art is long and time is fleeting and our hearts though Stout and brave still like muffled drums are beating funeral marches to the Grave right our hearts but he said our heart the heartbeat is like drums getting ready to go to the Grave it's like a drum beat getting ready to die pretty uh pretty negative right pretty sad approach but he's saying make everyday count and this is the one brother I quote so many times in the world's broad field of battle how many know you're in a battle today in the by view Act of Life which means a temporary camp in this temporary battle that we're fighting be not like dumb driven cattle be a hero in The Strife this is the one brother R quotes the most often be a hero in other words everybody goes goes to work everybody goes home everybody goes to work everybody goes home brother R said he quotes it says don't be like a cattle where you're just driven around he said be a hero amen look for someone you can rescue in in in the in the routine of life look for God's grace in your life look for somebody you can be a hero to who can you save Hallelujah trust no future however pleasant well I know if Trump gets in then it's all good but don't trust that he says right trust no future however pleasant Let the dead past bury its dead act act in the living present heart within and God overhead Hallelujah so act in a way where you know God is watching you right don't trust in uh promises for the future Let the dead bury its dead let the past be the past but remember God's watching right over you right now Hallelujah he's got my future Hallelujah lives of Great Men all remind us we can make our lives Sublime think about Peter and departing leave behind us footprints on the sands of time hallelujah how many seen the footprints on this the the the sands of time poem right the very Pinnacle of it says Lord Lord uh it was going good I saw two Footprints until I only saw one why did you stop walking with me and the punch line is no those aren't your Footprints those were my footprints carrying you Hallelujah so when we thought we were doing the walking we weren't God was walking in us hallelujah see so it's it's encouraging look at Men's lives and sisters and brothers look at Christians lives around us and look how they made their life worthwhile and we should imitate that we should Echo that how did Brother R make his life such a blessing how and then look at my life how can I make my life a great blessing to other people too what can I do what Footprints am I leaving behind for my children what foot what Footprints is Malachi gonna read if I go off the scene what's he gonna read what's Lydia gonna see what's Haven Caris Victoria virtue not virgin Victoria Victoria Genevie Zion what Footprints are they goingon to see how did Dad walk in the tough times what kind of what kind of story did he live I hope they see my life was Jesus Christ serving other people take trying to take care of my family trying to take care of the church hallelujah what would be a Sublime life what do you want your life to look like like I remember that quote Austin we might have talked about it maybe brother amen we talked about it the man said you can have anything in life you want but you can't have everything everybody catch that in other words you got to decide what's the one thing that you couldn't live without amen and you got to go after that because you can't have everything but you can have anything you want so what would be the most important eternal life so how can we get the Holy Ghost and how can our children get the Holy Ghost that ought to be the most important thing in our lives amen is that right so we try to live our lives that way what do you do keep your children presence of God keep yourselves in the presence of God keep feeding on the things of God hallelujah grow in Grace and knowledge of the Lord hallelujah add these anointings to your life praise God G God caps off your life he writes your story and then when you get empowered when you get the full AR full armor of God on then you can have a character Arc then you can start being a blessing then you can rise in the power of the Holy Spirit and Minister and serve others Hallelujah how can I make my life Sublime and leave footprints on the sands of time footprints that perhaps another sailing over life's solom man a forlorn and Shipwrecked brother seeing shall take heart again is't that beautiful brother quotes this 20 times in other words live such a life so someone that's discouraged can walk by and say wow I heard brother's testimony I heard of my sister's testimony I can take heart I'm going to keep trying I'm going to keep uh overcoming by the grace of God hallelujah like church like I told you how many times I tried to quit tobacco but I kept trying and God gave me the victory praise God whatever you might battle whatever you might struggle with keep in the fight God's fighting for you God's fighting with you Hallelujah be a testimony be an example people can look at and say oh I'm going to try again because of brother so and so I see sister so over there what a testimony that gives me encourage I'm going to keep trying I'm going to keep serving God hallelujah how enjoying this today amen hallelujah you be the hero praise God don't look for somebody else to do it you go do it praise God I'm thundering out like because I'm on under this inspiration Hallelujah but we need a good thundering out in our lives praise God from time to time so then it ends with this stanza these last four lines let us then be up and doing with a heart for any fate see I love that no matter what God calls my life to be like the three Hebrew children I don't know that God's going to rescue us but even if he doesn't I'm not going to worship the devil Hallelujah no matter what fate he gives me I trust in God hallelujah he's my Lord he's in charge of my life the Lord gives and the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord praise God like job said though he slay me yet I'll trust him Hallelujah that's the kind of faith we need praise God no matter if things get worse or get better I still trust God because God's writing my story Hallelujah let me be up and serving the lord with a heart ready for any fate still achieving still pursuing learn to labor and to wait what does this come down to learn to be patient didn't Jesus say in patience possess your souls Hallelujah brother brand quoted this parts of this poem throughout his entire life he would quote it for inspiration Hallelujah brother quotes it and then he says in 1953 if we are real Christians if we're born again if we love Christ how many love Christ amen how many he says if we love his church who loves his church amen you love all the saints here if we are here tonight seeking his kingdom seeking his power let's take Faith and do what he says do so brother uses this poem let me go to the next one did I put it at the end I'm just going to put the most two popular Parts up here brother B uses this poem to say take what you've heard today from the word and go do it make your life great by what obeying the word of God praise God that's what he uses this for what is he preaching against he preaching against how we get lazy we get tired we get discouraged he's trying to say take courage get back in the battle praise God if we're not out there battling the front lines well here clean up your sword right sharpen your sword let's go out there let's take a deep breath let's go fight some more praise God let's not give up but ra says let's do what he says do he's doing his part and more don't you think so how many think God's doing his part is God fighting for you oh absolutely he's keeping my heart beating I know that he's giving me oxygen he's giving me good health God's doing more than his part brother R says let's do our part I like this one brother says don't be a Drifter he says now this is 1960 we're living in a terrific day now that I don't mean terrific like happy that means terrific like it's a it's a pretty uh uh strenuous day but all that you have need of is already supplied to you when you believe how many remember that the Bible said if he's Justified you he's already done what he's glorified you anybody remember Romans chapter 8 I've I've been forgetting that one lately I need to go back and read that I need some encouragement sister Lena I need some encouragement like brother Jesse you are more than a conqueror hey Patrick P me on the back and say brother Jesse you're more than a conqueror that's right brother amen that's right I forgot that amen CL Pat me on the back and say if God's for you who can be against you God's for that's right Hallelujah I'm on God's side God's fighting for me praise God Amen Mal p on the back and say uh no man can lay any charge to God's elect no man can lay any charge to God's elect that's right I'm forgiven hallelujah praise God Amen I'm a hero right God wants me to be a hero God wants me to help people God wants me to rescue people hallelujah but I can't do it if I'm all discouraged and I I don't re really remember wow I'm leaving Footprints this is how a Christian should act this is how a Christian should walk not walk in the ways of the world but stay on the narrow road amen stay on the narrow road that leads to life Hallelujah he says so many people today and this is a good one for uh Bram Tabernacle because I just preached on that recently like to get those little punches in there to try to wake some people up he said so many people today I find when they church here especially in America everybody say especially ready especially in America here's what brother BR finds they just become Drifters they just say well praise God I've met brother brandom I got saved I put my name on the book and that's all I got to do isn't that like some people today I go to message church I believe brother bram's a prophet of God that's all I got to do brother said especially in America so I hope that the church is listening this morning Hallelujah you look like you are I don't see anybody sleeping out there if you are you probably need a nap like Zion or yeah something like that right working so hard yesterday having so much fun he said he said Just Don't Drift just drifting don't you don't want to do that we don't want to do that you never got saved just by being a member of a church you got saved to do work he says he say you got saved to work we don't dress up an army and just let them lay around the corner and flirt with girls brother man says with pretty Uniforms on we train our army to fight and we're not at a picnic we're on the Battlegrounds we're right here facing the enemy of the Lord Jesus and the enemy of our souls let's be up and doing with a heart for any yeah with a heart to fight any Strife he said I like that Psalm of Life be not dumb driven uh cattle he said let's be a hero and he quotes this poem let's not drift around and wonder what are we doing here I might be doing this this this week next week I'm doing that next week I'm over here brother R said let's find the PATH you're going to walk let's do what God's called you to do and let's be faithful to that not drifting from like in America I know brother brandom I know this I'm good I don't have nothing to do find something to do for god brother BR says he says we've got to do something let's get up and do something about it let's put our shoulder to the wheel this is 1960 what it takes to overcome all all unbelief our faith let's see that our church prospers who wants to see that one right we don't want to see this church fail brother William doesn't want to come back and see us fail in a couple years we want to see the church Prosper let's get the kingdom prospering let's see that the sick gets in here let's see that God is laid down among the people and great signs and wonders take place that will strike this nation I'm satisfied that there'll be things happen here that will thrill this country that'll shake for the kingdom of God if each one of us will get behind it praise God that's what I want Church don't you want testimonies too where people can say oh I heard about that testimony brother Jesse had a video about there about a testimony to the church how many people loved Austin's testimony when God I got so many people and even when we put Simon's testimony on there um with Mike mosy people saying wow these are such amazing testimonies let's live a life where God can give us testimonies and we can share with the world and people say wow God is with that church Hallelujah brother bam says you always got to have a purpose in what you're doing brother bam said a wife might say well I'm just a wife so here's brother RS answer to some of you wives out there he says well get on the telephone do something do do something to help the Lord Jesus now invite people to church he says pray for them right in other words there's nothing wrong with we we love our wives right we love our husbands but he's saying if you don't have anything to do reach out to somebody when was the last time you invited somebody to church right think about that I don't have many people that I know would like to come to church but I want to do a better job inviting people to church right I think the last one I invited was uh brother mua was it is that brother mu whose his wife passed away yeah I said that I said the right name mua right mua okay sometimes I get the names mixed up that's the last time I invited somebody to church a couple last summer last time I need to do more of that praise God now of course I got my family responsibilities as well and preaching and everything like that I got to go to work but church if if if we're needing something to do just look around you who he said tellone somebody well just text somebody right let's make it simple he said there's a time that a man can come to a place where he can have a purpose it's something that will change him when a man meets God a man can never be the same if he ever meets God face to face it will change him in spite of anything you can do about it a man can never be the same after he once meets God you know what his example is Noah but said Noah met God the Bible said nobody had Grace in those days except Noah had Grace because he was a preacher of righteousness and brother said when he met God he went to building the ark to save people Church what are we doing God help us to build a life that will save people praise God in other words be ready when your family that's not in the message be ready to pray for them when they call you right sister I know our sister doesn't that's why I'm pointing at her be ready be ready to do something praise God be ready start building that testimony day after day week after month uh month after month year after year decade after decade build your testimony to the saving of their souls Hallelujah I'm going to read one more brother Ram even says this after the seals brother William he still he still quot this brother Jose after the seals he still quotes this he's talking about when we get sick and God God brother man said God had to let us be sick so he could manifest himself as a Healer and then he quotes job though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh I shall see God whom I shall see for myself he said that's right that's what job said David said yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I'll fear no evil for thou art with me though I make my bed in hell he's there though I take the wings of the morning and fly away he's there praise God I heard brother say yesterday brother said he said if God would even send me to hell he said if there's such a thing as love in hell I'll still love him amen because that's how much he loves God God can do you can do whatever you want with my life but I love you Jesus thank you for the cross thank you for the resurrection thank you for the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen hallelujah but man said then he quotes this he says in the world's broad field of cattle in the Bak of Life be not like a dumb driven cattle be a hero in The Strife brother man said let's believe be a hero in The Strife Hallelujah so Church what will your story be hallelujah what what's your story arc going to be I think there are six arcs there's probably more than that but I found a blog post with six of them yeah kind of maybe I'll show them tonight for the second service I'm G to preach a communion sermon here tonight by God's grace but friends Saints be the hero of your story don't give up don't quit don't stay down get up and fight the good fight of Faith like Peter you could you here today you you cannot be any lower than Peter denying the faith Now Thompson Chain said he blasphemed but I don't even know I don't know if we go that far blasphemy means to speak evil to rail at God I don't think Peter railed at Jesus he just said I don't know him but we can see the progression right from Pride and the fall all the way down to denial I don't even know him I have no connection with the Messiah the Messiah the Lamb of God no matter where we find ourselves today God has a story and he's trying to write our story how many want to let him write the story the most awful mistakes church we can make even of denying the word denying this denying that and even like Peter's life physical murder right almost God still reaches out his hand and offers him just like gory just like on on the sea when he pulled him up not only did Jesus do it naturally he did it spiritually praise God you and I couldn't be any lower today than Peter who denied the very message that went to him he denied the very Revelation Oh Glory he denied the Revelation that Jesus said he already had and that proves once you got a revelation it can never be taken from you Hallelujah think about that he had the Revelation that Jesus was the Messiah he denied that but that was his true that wasn't his True Confession he later got it he later got it back because the Gates of Hell will never Prevail against Revelation amen that's what Jesus said what Martha and Mary received at his feet he said what what's been given to you it'll never be taken from you glory to God in other words Revelation is eternal because it's the Eternal Word of God it's the Holy Spirit that's Eternal writing his word upon the fleshly tables of your soul so but be the hero be the parent who raises children in godliness and doesn't make compromises that's right be a hero for your kids don't leave them like some of our parents left us hallelujah remember I told you that story my uncle my Grandpa died and I went up to my Uncle Junior he passed away last year but I said Uncle Junior got any advice for me as a young man and he starts crying he said you know why you asked me that I said no why did I ask you that I think I would know why I asked you that he said you know why you asked me

there so God God bless you buddy now but but but my uncle said see and they said you know why God allowed your dad to leave you I said no he said so you wouldn't leave your children right and that's true I know what it feels like to be left so now as a Christian I I would never leave my children this man I'm like who's talking here is this God or what it was God it was definitely God but see that

they said let's just let's just get a few bottles of water together and other people started hearing about it he said their whole church was filled up with water bottles and blankets and all these things he said God did that God did that and so I sent a little love offering from our church to them I trust God will bless it he said he said uh he just never imagine he said the all the think about all the aisles in the in the church were just filled with water bottles and clothes and hats and gloves and heaters and generators and all these things for people that they just started pouring out

hands I thought he was a devil worshipper he looks like a devil worshipper and I prayed before that and God was gracious to me was gracious he said some men are real blusterous and some are real dogmatic and others are fine others are kind and you just find all different kinds of people in his kingdom look at St Peter and judging by St Andrew now I don't know where this says it in the Bible but he said Andrew is that prayer Warrior just stayed on his knees all the time see most of you will never come up here and take a sermon and preach but you know what you can do you can preach a sermon on your knees praise God you can get on your knees and ask God God help the service help the ministry Lord help brother so- and so Lord minister to sister so and you can pray more than other people could pray that's brother man said that's what Andrew St Andrew did but he said Peter wasn't that way he was uh one of those fire brands that preach and so forth and then Paul was more scholarly like so Paul's there reading the books Paul spend more time at the table this down that down Peter's just you know he's just praying to preach to real Heart Andrew is there on his knees God has a variety God makes us all heroes amen find where God has called you to be in your position and be heroic be courageous Hallelujah don't let anybody uh discourage you from helping other people
