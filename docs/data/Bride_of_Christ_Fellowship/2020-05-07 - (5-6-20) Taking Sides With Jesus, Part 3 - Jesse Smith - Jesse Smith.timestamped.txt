[24:52] alright let's take our human night read
[24:59] our text in our memory verse so for our
[25:02] text is a little different
[25:04] let's go to numbers chapter 11 we're
[25:08] gonna stay on the same thought as Sunday
[25:10] so this would be part 3 of taking sides
[25:13] with Jesus or willing we'll finish it
[25:15] tonight we'll see how tonight goes
[25:17] let's read numbers 11 may seem like a
[25:22] strange Scripture but brother Branham
[25:24] says God system has never changed for
[25:29] spreading the gospel spreading the good
[25:31] news it's always stayed the same
[25:37] he calls it God's system so numbers 11
[25:50] let's do verse 16 and Laura Marling I'll
[25:58] just read 16 and 17 and then we'll turn
[26:00] to Isaiah 12 to read that great memory
[26:03] verse from sister Karen well I've loved
[26:05] all these memory verses sister Naomi and
[26:07] brother Jose and a bang and sister Wendy
[26:11] just wonderful memory verses here truly
[26:15] the Lord writes it on the fleshly tables
[26:17] of our hearts members 1116 re distances
[26:24] and the Lord said unto Moses gather unto
[26:27] me 70 men of the elders of Israel whom
[26:30] thou knowest to be the elders of the
[26:32] people and officers over them and bring
[26:35] them unto the tabernacle the
[26:37] congregation that they may stand there
[26:39] with thee and I will come down and talk
[26:42] with Z there and I will take of the
[26:44] spirit which is upon thee and will put
[26:47] it upon them and they shall bear the
[26:50] burden of the people
[26:51] with thee thou barren not thyself alone
[26:56] okay let's go to Isaiah chapter 12 verse
[26:59] 2 I appreciate all the good feedback
[27:16] about these sermons on taking sides with
[27:18] Jesus it's really wonderful and
[27:22] supporting in this hour to see brother
[27:25] Ram one of the future to look like for
[27:28] the Apostolic Holy Ghost ministry and it
[27:32] was to continue the same way it was
[27:33] going during his day so we're thankful
[27:35] to be a part of that aren't you I'm very
[27:38] thankful
[27:39] so no I'm sorry Isaiah 12 2 to 5 it'll
[27:44] read that together here I said 12 -
[27:57] let's read it on three one two three
[28:02] behold god is my salvation i will trust
[28:06] and not be afraid for the lord jehovah
[28:11] is my strength and my son he also has
[28:16] become my salvation therefore with joy
[28:20] chinese draw water out of the wells of
[28:24] salvation and in that day shall ye say
[28:28] praise the lord call upon his name
[28:32] declare his doings among the people make
[28:36] mention that his name is exalted sing
[28:40] unto the Lord for he has done excellent
[28:43] things this is known in all the earth
[28:47] let's have one more word of Prayer
[28:48] having eat on your heart just making the
[28:50] little one here tonight there's someone
[28:53] you're praying for you can raise your
[28:54] hand for them
[28:55] how many father we love you we exalt you
[28:57] we just read this scripture to sing
[28:59] aloud to the Lord and worship him and
[29:02] make him known and all the earth declare
[29:03] his doings Lord
[29:05] do that we've done that lordy we've
[29:07] shared your testimonies with others help
[29:09] us to keep doing it Lord send us people
[29:11] to talk to Lord and share about the
[29:14] power of this Holy Ghost gospel thank
[29:17] you Lord for bringing us into it Lord
[29:19] God you came looking for us or we did
[29:21] not go looking for ourselves
[29:23] so knowing me Lord to preach and teach
[29:26] and anoint your people here to receive
[29:28] Lord God and father will be happy and
[29:31] grateful as we take our side with you
[29:33] and your system in Jesus Christ's name
[29:36] the church said and amen god bless you
[29:39] mancine praise God alright Lord willing
[29:59] we'll try to be timely here tonight by
[30:03] God's grace I just briefly I just wrote
[30:08] briefly review parts one and two I know
[30:13] there's a wonderful Saints from other
[30:16] churches that may watch our service if
[30:18] there's Church doesn't have a Wednesday
[30:21] night or if their church service gets
[30:22] done early so we looked on Sunday twice
[30:25] both services had taken sides with Jesus
[30:30] and in this sermon from June of 62
[30:33] brother Graham takes the first half and
[30:35] he talks with the ministers it's like a
[30:37] ministers meeting he specifically said
[30:39] the sisters were invited to come and he
[30:42] showed his vision for the future as far
[30:46] as ministry and preaching he spends the
[30:49] last half kind of preaching that thought
[30:51] about taking sides with Jesus Jesus's
[30:54] ministry was supernatural yet evil
[30:56] spoken of and they had to take aside one
[30:59] way or another and we were and we are
[31:02] today doing the same thing we're taking
[31:03] sides with the message of the hour which
[31:06] is the Bible revelations revealed today
[31:09] that God is vindicating today as brother
[31:12] Branham said in the rapture message 1965
[31:16] so brother Graham said I want to show
[31:18] you the vision
[31:18] I have for the future then brother
[31:22] Graham says before we do anything we
[31:24] should see the Holy Spirit moving
[31:26] leading us and guiding us in all of our
[31:30] efforts and then brother Ram goes into
[31:32] Paul's establishment of new churches he
[31:35] would go into a area like an apostle
[31:37] where there was no Christian churches
[31:39] sometimes he go to the synagogue's with
[31:43] flip-up in he went down to the river to
[31:46] pray right and the first convert was
[31:49] Lydia and then he before he would leave
[31:52] he would stay there while then ordain
[31:54] elders and pastors or come back and then
[31:57] ordain elders and pastors brother have
[31:59] said God promised to restore that
[32:02] apostolic pattern from Paul John
[32:04] Polycarbon rainiest Martin and all the
[32:07] way down God is going to restore that
[32:12] the RAM Allah tells us to live like the
[32:16] coming of the Lord is very soon we're to
[32:20] live like it's now like brother amens
[32:21] dream Jesus saying I'm coming now live
[32:25] like it's now we must leave footprints
[32:28] on the sands of time bran then gave a
[32:37] ellis tration about when he was in
[32:39] Bombay India he said I probably had a
[32:41] hundred or two hundred thousand converts
[32:43] that one altar call after that blind man
[32:46] was gay him in his sight and he said if
[32:49] only he would have had cooperation from
[32:51] the local churches that after the people
[32:54] got saved he could have sent them to the
[32:55] churches he said probably many of them
[32:57] laundered back out into the world but we
[33:00] have that confidence all that the father
[33:02] has given me will come anyone that was
[33:05] really wanted to serve God genuinely
[33:08] with a pure sincere heart no doubt they
[33:12] would have found a church and then or
[33:15] like brother Ram said if there would
[33:19] have been no one preaching it one of the
[33:21] young men or 100 men would have raised
[33:23] up and started preaching it and that's
[33:26] the beauty of the power of the gospel
[33:29] you be when you get the Spirit of Christ
[33:31] you feel like you're responsible for
[33:33] taking care of Christians and if you see
[33:36] a hungry Christian who's not getting the
[33:37] word you want to try to help them out
[33:39] praise God and so if nobody else will do
[33:43] it I'll do it right that's the that's
[33:45] the desire we should have brother Adam
[33:48] talks about it to decide if you're in a
[33:50] family and one of the children doesn't
[33:52] do their chore you do it right
[33:54] especially if it's so important like he
[33:56] said bring in the wood to burn at the
[33:58] burner so you have heat in the
[34:00] wintertime
[34:01] he said if John doesn't pack the wood
[34:03] then you pack the wood right you find a
[34:07] need amongst the the church or the bride
[34:10] and then you fill that ministry and so
[34:15] that's what Bill Graham said you get so
[34:16] burdened what do you brothers would just
[34:17] preach it and then brother branham's
[34:22] talks about his ministry how God called
[34:24] him the pastor told him to build the
[34:26] tabernacle they had went through many
[34:28] pastors after brother Branham went out
[34:30] and the evangelistic and missionary
[34:32] field but then finally raised up brother
[34:34] Neville brother Branham says be ever as
[34:38] loyal as you can don't be discouraged a
[34:41] lot of people are not going to receive
[34:42] the message right the roof I was our he
[34:44] passed for America the other countries
[34:46] got the revival now thank God for that
[34:50] but don't quit because what if Paul
[34:52] would have quit then the chain would
[34:54] have stopped right so we have to keep
[34:57] the chain go have to keep following the
[34:59] footprints and then making our own
[35:00] footprints for the next generation and
[35:04] then Paul left his office to Timothy
[35:06] brother Graham said we need to leave
[35:09] footprints for our family coming after
[35:12] us and then we read acts 15 and we
[35:18] showed how Paul was an apostle and Paul
[35:24] Barnabas actually called the first
[35:27] council right or meeting amongst the the
[35:31] early apostles the early church fathers
[35:32] over circumcision so those two Paul
[35:36] Marvis went up to Jerusalem and they all
[35:38] got they all
[35:39] one Accord that a big meeting right they
[35:42] all prayed and and fellowship and then
[35:44] they all heard testimony when after one
[35:46] after another and then James came out
[35:48] and gave that final word he quoted the
[35:51] scripture I believe it was from Amos and
[35:53] then Isaiah and they all agreed and they
[35:56] listed four things all the Gentiles
[35:58] should do so a missionary does hold
[36:01] meetings and a missionary does ordain
[36:04] and put things in order okay and that's
[36:09] a good example of how we can see brother
[36:12] Branham grew in his progressive
[36:13] revelation because in this message taken
[36:17] sides of Jesus by the RAM says apostles
[36:19] don't do that apostles don't hold
[36:21] meetings right he said they don't that
[36:25] they don't meet with the brothers right
[36:28] they don't have councils but we know
[36:30] Paul did and Paul was an apostle a
[36:32] teacher
[36:34] pastor prophet evangelist he Paul was
[36:36] all five no doubt he had all five so
[36:42] program tells brother Neville carry on
[36:47] just the way we always have and as you
[36:51] know brother Branham I'm sorry brother
[36:52] Neville never play tapes you can so go
[36:56] online and I liked I think I have a DVD
[36:59] of it as well and you can listen to many
[37:01] of brother Neville's sermons I need to
[37:03] find that and share that with the Saints
[37:05] if I forget somebody remind me he didn't
[37:08] play tapes so here you know nine months
[37:10] before the seals brother BAM still tells
[37:12] and carried on the same way and then I
[37:15] read you two quotes from the seals where
[37:17] one quote from the seals where brother
[37:19] BAM said evangelists should continue on
[37:22] the field don't change a thing and then
[37:26] six months after that it's in 1964 they
[37:30] asked brother Branham should you preach
[37:32] only and he said no we need more
[37:34] preachers start preaching we need them
[37:37] and then in part two the RAM says mate
[37:41] today count and then brother the man
[37:46] instead just like the early fathers
[37:49] whenever revival strikes you're really
[37:52] excited right away
[37:53] but then brother Branson starts to cool
[37:55] off he says and that's where you do you
[37:58] gotta it happens everybody no doubt
[38:00] we began with a really on a hot
[38:03] fire right thank God but then it starts
[38:06] to dim down a little bit he said but you
[38:08] gotta hold the fort
[38:09] if Christ doesn't come in your day you
[38:12] gotta hold the fort so the next
[38:14] generation knows how to serve the Lord
[38:16] and so that's what we're doing by the
[38:19] grace of Lord of milligram said that's
[38:20] prophecy as well because I'll restore
[38:23] sayeth the Lord so we know that coming
[38:28] the Lord is close to the hand but we
[38:29] don't know when and so it could be our
[38:33] generation the next or next we don't
[38:35] know so we got to keep planting the
[38:39] seeds keep preaching and all the
[38:42] predestinated souls will receive God's
[38:44] Word praise the Lord thank God for that
[38:47] now we saw this striking quote where
[38:49] brother Ram said he doesn't have he
[38:51] didn't have one speck of the meeting of
[38:53] the Holy Ghost in June of 62 as far as
[38:57] his upcoming meetings he didn't know
[38:58] what to do and it was because he'll read
[39:01] a little bit more of it tonight that he
[39:03] had the vision or the dream rather to
[39:06] store up food sort of tapes in
[39:08] Jeffersonville it was important to see
[39:11] that that you know you can be a Holy
[39:13] Ghost filled prophet with amazing gifts
[39:16] no one had a gift like brother Branham
[39:18] get the discernment a son of man
[39:19] ministry and yet he felt like he had no
[39:22] leading on what to do that's because God
[39:25] orders the footsteps of the righteous
[39:27] praise God
[39:28] God knew what he was doing and that's
[39:30] the beauty church of going back and
[39:31] listen to brother ground sermons and and
[39:33] seeing all that he said about his
[39:35] ministry because then we can see what
[39:37] happened after it and that gives us
[39:39] perfect 20/20 vision right it's 20/20
[39:42] we're getting good vision about the
[39:44] fivefold ministry praise God and that's
[39:48] what we can do that's the blessing of
[39:50] having all those sermons and testimonies
[39:54] on tape because you can see what
[39:56] happened afterward what did God do after
[39:59] the Prophet said this thisthis had this
[40:01] leading or no leading here you can see
[40:03] what God did
[40:06] remember in the seven seals Bramson
[40:07] those were the greatest meetings he ever
[40:10] had I think about that just nine months
[40:12] earlier he's felt like he had no leading
[40:14] then nine months later he preached the
[40:17] greatest sermons of his life so Church
[40:19] it ought encourages never give up even
[40:21] if you feel far away from God don't feel
[40:23] anointing stay with God stay with God's
[40:25] Word the Holy Ghost will return praise
[40:27] God
[40:28] God remember like Hezekiah the Bible
[40:30] said the Spirit of God left Hezekiah to
[40:33] test him and maybe God's strong
[40:35] anointing over your mind if you're born
[40:37] again your soul that anointing will
[40:38] never leave but maybe that strong
[40:40] anointing he's always on my thoughts
[40:42] he's I'm always singing a voice worship
[40:43] I'm always meditating on God if if God
[40:46] allows that anointing to let up let us
[40:50] ever remain faithful just be just as
[40:52] diligent just go through the motions
[40:55] without feelings up here because you
[40:57] know your soul feels that praise God if
[40:59] you really love God you'll feel in your
[41:02] soul praise God and just stay with God
[41:05] because God will order your footsteps
[41:08] like we read in Philippians 1:6 God is
[41:10] faithful to finish what he started
[41:12] aren't you glad he started something in
[41:14] your life let him finish it then don't
[41:17] walk away don't turn away and go back
[41:18] like a pig to its mud or a dog to its
[41:22] vomit just keep pressing on and you'll
[41:24] receive the end of your faith the
[41:26] salvation of your soul praise God
[41:31] and then on Sunday night we looked at
[41:34] brother Branham saying he didn't call
[41:37] himself a prophet because he didn't
[41:38] operate like a prophet and then we saw
[41:41] his standing in the gap that brother
[41:44] Branham admitted part of the reason he
[41:47] said I want to be a maybe I'm a prophet
[41:49] in the Old Testament was so he could
[41:51] have an excuse to go hunt so part of the
[41:55] reason he wanted to be away from the
[41:57] people and part of the reason that
[41:59] Complex came up along was because of
[42:02] selfishness he wanted to go hunt instead
[42:06] of spending the time traveling and being
[42:08] with the people but I love how the Lord
[42:10] is so faithful right we might get
[42:12] thoughts and our minds and complexes in
[42:14] our minds but God is faithful to correct
[42:16] us God will correct us even work we
[42:19] might be so close to making a decision
[42:20] that would destroy our testimony it
[42:23] might destroy our lives or ministries we
[42:27] might be so close but at that crucial
[42:29] moment the Holy Ghost will come on the
[42:31] scene praise God and know guide us
[42:33] direct us he's faithful
[42:35] praise God we've given God
[42:37] responsibility for our lives praise the
[42:39] Lord that's the key of David Wright
[42:41] we've Christ has the key of David our
[42:43] responsibility is on his shoulder so
[42:45] Jesus is responsible for our testimony
[42:48] he will finish what he started amen
[42:50] and then God told by the brand do the
[42:54] work an evangelist okay and then we show
[43:04] not Paul as a prophet apostle teacher
[43:05] okay now part three everything new here
[43:08] from going forward here now at this
[43:12] point of the taking sides with Jesus
[43:14] brother man goes back to explaining why
[43:16] he cannot be a prophet and an evangelist
[43:19] at the same time now you and I as far as
[43:23] me we know what was preached on Sunday
[43:25] we showed the balance from the scripture
[43:26] a prophet can do that a prophet can be a
[43:29] pastor for a while and then evangelist
[43:31] or teacher he can be all those at the
[43:33] same time like when Paul establish
[43:36] Ephesus he was the pastor he was the
[43:39] missionary that started that he prayed
[43:40] for them he got the Holy Ghost right and
[43:42] then he was no doubt teaching them for
[43:44] three years he was doing all that at the
[43:46] same time and so we know from the Word
[43:50] of God and from standing in the gap that
[43:53] this part brother Branham would have
[43:56] corrected later on so brother man says
[44:02] he said he's always mixed the two
[44:03] offices he says where I've always fussed
[44:07] about so brother Branham always fussed
[44:09] with that because he thought well you
[44:10] can't miss mix offices but then a year
[44:13] later God shows him he can so that's
[44:17] important to see there no he brother man
[44:21] repeats it again and he says a prophet
[44:24] has thus saith the Lord he said you
[44:26] don't hold meetings and discuss things
[44:28] he's got the word Lord for whoever he
[44:30] said - he don't fool around with the
[44:32] group
[44:33] churches now look we just read it on
[44:35] Sunday from acts 15 Paul did meet with
[44:39] churches often Paul did many times he
[44:43] would meet with churches and especially
[44:45] the ministers and train them and teach
[44:46] them we saw that that was indeed
[44:49] scriptural and then brother Graham goes
[44:52] into how he had a restless spirit and I
[44:54] think it's important to say that brother
[44:56] Graham said I've never felt I should
[44:57] live in Indiana isn't that strange see
[45:01] because he had to be a traveling
[45:02] missionary and evangelist around the
[45:05] world seven times right he had to have
[45:08] this feeling in his soul right with the
[45:10] plan of God and he never felt like he
[45:13] should live in Indiana he thought he
[45:14] should and that's why he traveled and
[45:16] then member where he moved out west in
[45:19] 1963 but see many of these great desires
[45:23] in our hearts they're there for a reason
[45:26] remember he died at 56 right so he
[45:30] really didn't even accomplish that
[45:32] desire to not live in Jeffersonville T
[45:35] will use 53 so see many of these many of
[45:40] your leadings children in your hearts
[45:42] and my heart they may lay there for
[45:44] years and decades but if God is behind
[45:49] that just wait on it just wait don't try
[45:52] to force it yourself remember my brother
[45:54] Graham had to wait on it
[45:55] he had that you had to see the man
[45:57] upfront never put a stake in his yard
[45:59] and then he went up and talked to him
[46:01] and then he said Oh Jefferson Mills
[46:04] widening the lane he said okay he said
[46:07] and told his wife he said there was a
[46:08] vision on that and go find the vision he
[46:10] said honey pack the bags we're moving
[46:12] west so see that's that's what you and I
[46:16] need to do
[46:16] don't jump ahead of God's plan stay
[46:19] right in God's plan stay a faithful
[46:22] daughter right until you see God's
[46:24] leadership stay a faithful son right
[46:27] until you see God's perfect will until
[46:30] you see God over the door Amen so your
[46:35] any times you're your character your
[46:37] human character your your nature will
[46:40] match your ministry all right you said
[46:48] you said there's no settling down place
[46:50] for me I just can't do it I'm Restless
[46:52] shifting place the place I can't help it
[46:56] so he had to be that way in order to
[46:59] perform all five folds of the fivefold
[47:03] ministry praise God
[47:07] all right now brother Graham now goes
[47:11] into some repeated thoughts about
[47:13] telling the brothers no matter what
[47:15] happens in your ministries take
[47:17] everything back to the word he didn't
[47:20] say the tape Richie
[47:22] we know the tapes have wonderful things
[47:23] on them but tapes only point to the word
[47:26] the word is the absolute so brother man
[47:30] says this he says we've got fine men
[47:34] just recently there was a revival broke
[47:37] out in the church here amongst the
[47:38] people the spirit come among them begin
[47:41] to give gifts I watched it to see if it
[47:44] go off into fanaticism every time you
[47:48] start moving that way the spirit would
[47:49] check it and bring it back here
[47:52] I thought praise the Lord he said see
[47:54] you just hold your place he'll give some
[47:59] more examples in just a moment but
[48:01] that's a good point to tell those
[48:03] ministers no matter what goes on who
[48:06] gets excited and also the opposite is
[48:08] true too no matter how excited you get
[48:11] or how low you get take everything back
[48:14] to the word we kind of dealt with that
[48:16] when we preached those series it was
[48:19] 20-some sermons on the seasons of life
[48:21] right no matter what season God makes
[48:23] everything beautiful in his own seas and
[48:26] praise God so we just have to be patient
[48:28] perhaps our the biggest thing about
[48:30] patience is being patient with God
[48:35] brother Graham says he has to keep
[48:37] moving like Abraham right
[48:39] Abraham was kinda like a father of that
[48:41] faith brother Graham was like the father
[48:43] of this message and then brother man
[48:47] two local situations here and this is
[48:51] important to show how church leaders
[48:56] should respect the votes of the people
[48:58] and the voices of the people so this was
[49:01] to like this is like me I should hear
[49:03] the voices of the people mother may have
[49:08] said I believe in the present time we
[49:10] need a church and people say well what
[49:14] about putting all that money in the
[49:16] church if the Lord is going to come let
[49:18] me have encounters that thought and says
[49:20] well what good is it going to do to keep
[49:23] the money if the Lord comes so there's a
[49:27] good balance right because something I
[49:29] have some quotes or milligrams says how
[49:31] can they be spend five million dollars
[49:32] on a new building and then missionaries
[49:36] don't have Bibles overseas so you have
[49:39] to be led of the Lord you know if you're
[49:40] gonna build a church or spend millions
[49:42] and millions of dollars because perhaps
[49:46] and if I have a hundred million dollars
[49:47] he said I would start doing missionary
[49:50] campaigns across this nation to get this
[49:53] nation ready for the coming of the Lord
[49:56] for he's God so we know his heart was in
[49:58] missionary I would work ministry that's
[50:01] what his spirit right that was that the
[50:03] spirit God gave him he said if the
[50:09] people designated the money for the
[50:11] church so like a building fund like we
[50:13] started a few years ago I think there's
[50:14] still 600 or 700 dollars laying in that
[50:17] building fund
[50:18] he says it's our duty with a hundred
[50:20] percent vote here that I took that night
[50:24] to build the church so build it I'd say
[50:27] build it okay so we never voted on
[50:31] building a church which is fine you know
[50:36] we'd have to be in a financial position
[50:38] and do that but I'm showing you that's
[50:40] when a preacher and the Deacons and the
[50:43] trustees must go ahead when they've got
[50:46] the money set aside specifically for the
[50:48] building fund and then they can build as
[50:51] long as a church votes for it
[51:00] well Graham said if the Lord is coming
[51:03] next week let's start building the
[51:07] church this week beautifully let's show
[51:13] him let's stand at our posted beauty and
[51:16] then when the church he said then the
[51:19] church is built up he says what if he's
[51:22] coming ten years from now
[51:24] what if he's twenty years has been 55
[51:27] right this is for the 55th year this
[51:30] December will be the 55th year since
[51:33] brother Branham left the scene what if
[51:36] it's a hundred years whatever it is when
[51:41] he comes it matters not we know they'll
[51:43] be coming for us before that time
[51:45] because we can't live it out 100 years
[51:47] or more he'll be coming for us when we
[51:49] got to leave parties behind us he says
[51:54] why not then let the church board here
[51:56] speak into them now build that church
[51:58] put it up here make it nice a nice place
[52:01] where the people can come see if you
[52:03] want if you built something you want to
[52:05] make it look nice like when we started
[52:07] renting out that building we want to
[52:08] paint it clean it up get a new carpet
[52:11] make it look nice for the people it's
[52:13] God's house right I remember the days of
[52:16] Hagee I had a I had to bawl out Israel
[52:19] because they were spending more time on
[52:21] their houses than God's house that's a
[52:23] good way to start his focus on God's
[52:25] house put God's house first when that's
[52:28] done now you move on to your house then
[52:35] brother Branham suggests that brother
[52:36] Neville be the pastor as long as the
[52:38] people vote him in as long as they have
[52:41] the leading of the Lord all right now
[52:44] now brother Graham moves on now he goes
[52:46] back to addressing all the preachers
[52:48] there so not just brother Neville and
[52:50] Brown Tabernacle now he goes back to all
[52:52] the guest ministers he named some like
[52:55] brother Christ for the junior Jackson
[52:58] brother JT Parnell brother Beeler he
[53:05] says now you
[53:06] be associated here together he talks
[53:08] about in Jeffersonville you can't go
[53:11] down and meet with the mess Methodist
[53:13] you have no fellowship with them the
[53:17] Baptist you go talking about speaking in
[53:19] tongues the baptism in Jesus name they
[53:22] kick you out that quick and he snaps his
[53:24] finger that's right you sit around here
[53:27] you'd be like a dove
[53:28] I'm sorry sitting around there you'd be
[53:30] like a dove amongst a bunch of crows you
[53:34] have no fellowship at all he says you
[53:36] die and I'm not making fun of Methodists
[53:38] and Baptists now I'm talking about
[53:41] fellowship he says he said many of you
[53:47] here men of God calling in your life
[53:50] he said you be doing something just
[53:53] don't set around let's do something you
[53:58] don't get but one soul saved get that
[54:00] one soul saved each of us Church that's
[54:03] what we should do try to get one soul
[54:05] saved remember a couple years ago I
[54:08] think it was two years ago I got that
[54:09] email from that person that repented
[54:12] after watching my baptism video and I
[54:15] never heard back from him they're out in
[54:16] California they said the baptism video
[54:20] brought them to salvation they were
[54:22] gonna be go be baptized and then she
[54:24] said you saved my soul and I said well I
[54:27] hope so by God's grace I hope that that
[54:30] individual stayed true to God and is
[54:32] trusting in the Lord Jesus Christ for
[54:34] salvation if that's all we can do let's
[54:37] do that let's save souls
[54:39] I remember church
[54:43] this too even with this recent ministry
[54:46] with the the Jeffersonville tape church
[54:49] movement the Bible says when you turn
[54:52] someone from the heir of his way you
[54:54] hide a multitude of sin I believe that
[54:58] ministry was really important look when
[54:59] it comes out in 2020 you know with the
[55:03] perfect vision of the Word of God
[55:06] now the taking sides with Jesus no doubt
[55:11] many people are in error and those
[55:13] movements and so we trust the Holy
[55:15] Spirit to direct people away from a
[55:18] man-made interpretation backed it with
[55:21] God's Word right here and it will hide a
[55:24] multitude of sin especially idol worship
[55:27] and worshipping brother Branham okay now
[55:34] then he tells the preachers he said
[55:37] after you know jeffersonville builds the
[55:39] church make this like a headquarters and
[55:42] like brother Neville here a senior elder
[55:46] among you seeing sometimes you got a
[55:49] question that you can't discuss out your
[55:50] church bring it here - brother Neville
[55:53] and you discuss it all together if you
[55:56] can't come to any decision I'll be
[55:58] coming by pretty soon then we'll all
[55:59] come together with it and then in there
[56:04] get training in your own groups other
[56:07] ministers cease preaching he's preaching
[56:09] to ministers not take players he says
[56:12] men that you see has a calling of God in
[56:15] their life for the ministry train them
[56:18] young men bring them in here to the
[56:20] elder my brother Neville all of you set
[56:23] together in a minister meeting and there
[56:25] teach the deeper things of God now what
[56:29] kind of person would say we don't need
[56:30] teaching in this day brother Graham says
[56:32] the main place we need teaching is
[56:34] preachers we need a pre-cut preacher an
[56:37] elder senior outer preacher who can
[56:39] really teach God's Word to teach the
[56:41] other preachers
[56:49] decision on a topic he said I'll be
[56:51] coming around soon to help pray pray
[56:53] about it he says but keep someone you
[56:58] can have confidence in to be kind of
[57:00] like a leader for you okay so you know
[57:03] cam and I always look to like brother
[57:05] Brooks as just a leader if we need any
[57:07] help or if we need any special prayer
[57:10] we'll look out to him you know
[57:15] runarounds kind of make it look like
[57:17] mentor you need like a mentor some
[57:19] figure where you look up and you can see
[57:22] how they've served the Lord before and
[57:24] God has spoken to you through that
[57:26] individual and you kind of look to them
[57:28] for guidance and help we all need it
[57:31] praise God we all need it so number have
[57:39] says yes trade up a group of men he says
[57:42] and then if I'm in an evangelistic work
[57:45] somewhere there's places I can place
[57:48] them worldwide see this was brother
[57:51] branham's vision to keep traveling start
[57:54] revivals then call back to Jefferson
[57:57] though and say can you send a young
[58:01] minister to kind of pastor and train
[58:04] this flock for six months or a year now
[58:07] this is now he goes into an example
[58:09] another example of India what if I was
[58:11] in India and go back and maybe you would
[58:15] have thousands of people stay there week
[58:17] or two and see the ministry they love it
[58:19] they believe it's a truth
[58:20] they come out of heathenism and maybe in
[58:23] two or three weeks when I was over there
[58:24] maybe a hundred thousand converted to
[58:26] Christ nowhere to go the next day take a
[58:29] plane and start back to Rome then the
[58:30] United States leave them just like she
[58:32] put out among wolves but what if I had a
[58:36] group of men young men trained the
[58:38] message to say now wait a minute before
[58:40] I leave we're going to set an order
[58:42] these churches I'll have a man I've
[58:44] already telegrammed them see or texted
[58:47] them for us so that my telegram they got
[58:50] the money so see storing up money for
[58:53] mission work there on their road here
[58:56] now to take over this a good man this is
[59:00] two or three young men with them
[59:02] who be helpers and assistants now isn't
[59:04] that a beautiful pattern a beautiful
[59:07] system if God's people can have that I
[59:11] know the brothers that have worked in
[59:13] Japan I've tried to do that Simon's try
[59:15] to do that we prayed for a pastor to
[59:17] raise up in Thailand I know for sure the
[59:19] the Canadian churches have done that in
[59:21] China the win a futile converts let's
[59:25] train up those converts and then move on
[59:27] ordain them as elders this is the
[59:31] Apostolic pattern so brother Graham said
[59:38] Church of this faith see our message
[59:40] faith can be set there which would be an
[59:42] outpost in India he said then get an
[59:45] outpost in Germany outpost in
[59:47] Switzerland why right now we should have
[59:50] them all around the nations where I've
[59:51] been and the message then from there
[59:53] comes another comes another comes
[59:55] another see what I mean so to see
[59:57] churches multiplying out of churches
[1:00:00] then brother Brown gives the example of
[1:00:02] Joseph mattes and bows a brother lawyers
[1:00:06] help me a few years ago I preached on it
[1:00:09] and you know Joseph met Matson Bose a he
[1:00:13] believes someone what brother Branham
[1:00:15] said but he never really could take a
[1:00:16] stand on it and that's what brother Ivan
[1:00:19] even says in this sermon take against
[1:00:21] the Falcons with Jesus so by the Lord I
[1:00:23] did appreciate that correction if you're
[1:00:25] listening or watching he didn't really
[1:00:27] fully believe all the message brother
[1:00:30] I've said that one man Joseph Matson
[1:00:32] bows a went into a certain country I
[1:00:37] can't remember where it was he went to a
[1:00:45] mission work I done say but his
[1:00:48] headquarters was Chicago and then on his
[1:00:52] mission work they'd start churches he
[1:00:54] would call back to Chicago telegram
[1:00:56] Chicago they would send money and
[1:00:58] missionaries to all these churches he
[1:01:01] said now Joseph Matson boses churches
[1:01:04] have tens of thousands that came out of
[1:01:08] one little revival and program says
[1:01:12] Joseph was not a man with gifts just a
[1:01:15] man who had enough courage to go there
[1:01:17] and start and have this ordained
[1:01:20] apostolic system remember that's what
[1:01:23] Randy sighs his dad did right wear a
[1:01:26] nice ice is dead started the church when
[1:01:29] he saw Randy was old enough he basically
[1:01:32] surprised Randy and said now you're
[1:01:34] gonna past her if I'm leaving and then
[1:01:37] he flew off to India and they started
[1:01:39] all there's many many churches he was
[1:01:41] one of the first ministers in India and
[1:01:45] then he would ordain elders in each of
[1:01:47] those churches and then more churches
[1:01:49] would spring out of all those churches
[1:01:52] well Graham says what could have been
[1:01:55] done under this message if Matson Bozek
[1:01:59] could get 10,000 without a gift and
[1:02:01] discernment what couldn't brother
[1:02:03] branham have done he said it could be
[1:02:05] raking in the millions sure we've lost
[1:02:07] that time that's what my suggestion
[1:02:10] would be now there is there's some
[1:02:15] evidence to say that this has sort of
[1:02:16] happened especially if you look at the
[1:02:18] United States and Canada right because
[1:02:20] in Canada brother ed mystical got saved
[1:02:23] and look what he's done you know many
[1:02:25] churches sprung out of his Tim protis
[1:02:27] you know was there a brother Rams
[1:02:30] ministry even as a young child and a
[1:02:32] church started there right messenger
[1:02:34] started there from his family actually
[1:02:36] and no doubt other ones have spread out
[1:02:39] from all these different locations
[1:02:42] brother Tim Humes you know look at him
[1:02:45] his family was there to go down to North
[1:02:47] Carolina so program plainly tells us
[1:02:53] that's the vision now next
[1:03:00] back to the ministers he said if there's
[1:03:02] disagreeing amongst the ministers he
[1:03:05] said stay in fellowship he said if you
[1:03:09] say because he don't believe like me I
[1:03:12] ain't going to fellowship then there's
[1:03:14] something wrong with you he said it's
[1:03:18] not wrong with the other fellows I'm
[1:03:20] wrong with you when you brethren who are
[1:03:22] trying to hold together they talks about
[1:03:25] how the Branham boys used to fight in
[1:03:26] the backyard but then they would fight
[1:03:29] anyone who came against the branham's in
[1:03:31] the front yard he said see you'd fight
[1:03:35] you do that you're family but we're
[1:03:36] still your brothers that's the way it is
[1:03:38] we might different that's all right well
[1:03:40] we're still one we're one in Christ we
[1:03:42] believe this message let's stay with it
[1:03:44] so as long as people are staying close
[1:03:46] you know to the message we keep
[1:03:49] fellowshipping now the bible does say if
[1:03:51] someone starts a heresy or a blasphemous
[1:03:54] doctrine and we don't fellowship with
[1:03:56] them we try to correct them and then the
[1:03:58] Bible said separate yourself from them
[1:04:00] mark them that caused a division
[1:04:02] contrary to the faith that we've
[1:04:04] received so when someone starts
[1:04:07] preaching like that we do have a right
[1:04:08] to separate ourselves now let's get to
[1:04:12] this where Bodrum tells us just to keep
[1:04:15] working again no this will just
[1:04:16] encourage us right let's just be
[1:04:18] encouraged me he said I think that's a
[1:04:21] thing to do keep on carried on until
[1:04:23] Jesus comes see you've got to be
[1:04:25] enthused with with it if you're not
[1:04:27] enthused there's something wrong so
[1:04:29] church you and I we got a look at our
[1:04:31] our lives and our attitudes if we're not
[1:04:34] enthused with God something's wrong with
[1:04:36] us right
[1:04:38] we're not enthused to get up in the
[1:04:39] morning and spend time with the Lord and
[1:04:41] do our ministry something is wrong with
[1:04:44] us we got to go back to the cross we got
[1:04:47] to go back to Passover right like Paul
[1:04:50] says you got to go back to sincerity the
[1:04:53] unleavened bread the feast of unleavened
[1:04:55] bread the feast of sincerity and truth
[1:04:58] we got to go back to those festivals and
[1:05:01] what was the festivals like a Sabbath
[1:05:02] see we got to go have that time alone
[1:05:04] with the Lord I said
[1:05:09] not say well last month I was pretty
[1:05:11] enthused but now I don't know see
[1:05:14] there's something wrong somewhere you
[1:05:15] got to be enthused all the time just
[1:05:17] keep punching he says like the devil is
[1:05:22] trying to get you he said like our last
[1:05:24] president mr. Eisenhower said he said
[1:05:27] many times we were fighting we picked up
[1:05:29] a shell and throwed it in to the gun
[1:05:31] pulled the hammer let her fall and it
[1:05:33] snapped it didn't go off well he said we
[1:05:36] didn't surrender we might have to put
[1:05:39] another one in and a snap too we didn't
[1:05:41] give up we kept on snapping till one
[1:05:43] went off praise God he said that's the
[1:05:45] way to win the war keep trying all
[1:05:48] church keep trying keep praying for your
[1:05:51] family friends keep trying to witness
[1:05:53] the loved ones keep praying for people
[1:05:55] to be healed
[1:05:56] keep trying one of these times it's
[1:05:58] gonna go off praise God throw the shell
[1:06:01] and pull it you got a purpose a target
[1:06:04] to hit and if it don't go off throw it
[1:06:06] out throw another one and try it again
[1:06:08] throw it in and try it again it goes off
[1:06:11] there's one of them in there that's
[1:06:13] alive and one of them will go off and
[1:06:16] that's the way we got to do just keep
[1:06:17] firing away fired away until something
[1:06:20] happens now here brother heaven goes
[1:06:26] back and he makes another statement kind
[1:06:28] of like the statement about not having
[1:06:30] one speck of leading he says what am i
[1:06:32] doing I'm firing away now I'm going out
[1:06:35] out here not even he says not not no
[1:06:39] even out any leading so brother have
[1:06:43] said he was just going out evangelizing
[1:06:45] different churches without a real
[1:06:46] leading and he says a responsibility
[1:06:51] he says there's millions of people
[1:06:53] looking at me what is he gonna do what's
[1:06:56] his next move some some things I'm gonna
[1:06:58] die some things this remember when the
[1:07:01] gun exploded in his face that was
[1:07:02] shortly before this see everything
[1:07:06] around the country see but you've got to
[1:07:08] contend with all that then you then you
[1:07:11] got the burden to the people so you're
[1:07:14] contending with everybody's attitude
[1:07:15] about you everything they say about you
[1:07:18] now I'm on that brother branham then you
[1:07:20] have to deal with all the burdens of the
[1:07:22] people your fam
[1:07:23] your local church right all your local
[1:07:25] minister friends so you know you could
[1:07:29] say it's even expanded in this hour
[1:07:31] right because now anybody can contact me
[1:07:33] you know through email or phone call or
[1:07:35] text which is okay it's not that much
[1:07:38] but we kind of get an idea how by the
[1:07:40] round we'll get calls for around the
[1:07:42] world right because we have whatsapp and
[1:07:44] you can get a text from Ghana you know
[1:07:46] brother William and you get a text
[1:07:48] almost instantly from overseas I got
[1:07:51] them from India quite often and then
[1:07:52] Africa as well brother Branham says I
[1:07:59] know you have burdens brothers but he
[1:08:01] says I got a great responsibility and
[1:08:04] brother Ram that makes a statement
[1:08:06] they must been in some of their hearts
[1:08:09] the preachers that must have been you
[1:08:11] know thinking brother Ram had it easy
[1:08:13] but he says you say well that ought to
[1:08:16] be easy for you brother branham anything
[1:08:18] you do to God just tells you no he
[1:08:21] doesn't he said I sweat it out just like
[1:08:23] you doing a whole lot harder sure I have
[1:08:26] to sweat it out much harder than you
[1:08:28] he said there's going to be more
[1:08:29] required of me
[1:08:31] where you have to answer for a church
[1:08:34] where you have to answer for your family
[1:08:36] or maybe just yourself see there's
[1:08:38] millions of souls I got to answer for I
[1:08:40] got to know my moves you know Satan is
[1:08:44] knocking you for once old church did you
[1:08:47] ever sure to never consider that the
[1:08:49] reason we battle Saint many times he's
[1:08:51] trying to keep us from winning your
[1:08:53] friends to Christ
[1:08:54] that's why Satan tries to discourage you
[1:08:57] he's just trying to keep you from
[1:08:59] winning those couple souls for me then
[1:09:02] same thing for me
[1:09:03] Satan battles me defeat stir tries to
[1:09:06] defeat me and discourage me to try to
[1:09:09] get me away from ministering to the
[1:09:12] people that are in my ministry in my
[1:09:15] circle of influence right so the more
[1:09:20] people you have influence over the MOL
[1:09:23] Satan's gonna try to attack you
[1:09:25] so you got to be faithful he said how
[1:09:32] many
[1:09:32] blass is satan throwing in here at me he
[1:09:37] said that's why I get nervous sometimes
[1:09:40] can say in his battling him so hard and
[1:09:43] now he finally brings up the dream about
[1:09:46] storing up tapes he said I'm going to
[1:09:52] keep throwing in the shells one of
[1:09:54] them's gonna fire somewhere we're gonna
[1:09:55] be on target so what it does fire I'll
[1:09:58] hit the object I'm shooting at all of
[1:10:01] you would be on target see what I mean
[1:10:02] I'm leaving for these meetings just
[1:10:05] plunging out yonder I don't aim to teach
[1:10:07] these great things I teach you people
[1:10:10] you remember that dream when I got the
[1:10:12] interpretation was go back and storm
[1:10:14] food where was that storehouse this
[1:10:17] Tabernacle where is there anything like
[1:10:21] it in the country around here that will
[1:10:23] compare with the message that we have
[1:10:25] amen that's how it is today what church
[1:10:29] in Akron can compare with the message
[1:10:31] that we've got praise God Amen it's all
[1:10:34] back to the Bible like I told you on
[1:10:37] Sunday same thing for the ramp said if I
[1:10:38] saw something greater in the word I'd go
[1:10:40] support it but there's not this is the
[1:10:43] greatest thing we have the revelation of
[1:10:45] God's Word so brother Branham says the
[1:10:55] food is stored up he said he said we got
[1:10:58] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:11:00] water baptism and we're getting out from
[1:11:02] denominational Creed's to see that
[1:11:04] that's what the message was meant to do
[1:11:06] point us to Jesus Christ and take us
[1:11:09] away from denomination crease now this
[1:11:14] other quote just came to me while I was
[1:11:15] preparing today about headquarters see
[1:11:19] people look at this dream store up the
[1:11:22] tapes make that your headquarters and
[1:11:24] they think every church's headquarters
[1:11:27] is Jefferson but that's not true form
[1:11:36] after brother Branham preached this in
[1:11:39] October of 62 he said that's the reason
[1:11:44] I have no denomination I have one
[1:11:47] headquarters
[1:11:48] that's from heaven wherever he sends
[1:11:52] there I go whatever he says I say we
[1:11:56] don't want no denomination this church
[1:11:58] ever talk about a denomination you've
[1:12:00] lost your pastor right then isn't that
[1:12:02] something quite fitting for today
[1:12:06] situation in the tape church movement so
[1:12:12] I just want you to show you this yeah
[1:12:13] brother Brown said my tapes get stored
[1:12:15] in the headquarters at Jeffersonville
[1:12:17] but he said really every Christians
[1:12:19] headquarters is heaven praise God he was
[1:12:22] not trying to make it
[1:12:25] and all you have to do church is look in
[1:12:26] the last paragraph of the church age
[1:12:28] book brother man closes it in such a
[1:12:30] beautiful fashion he said I never come
[1:12:32] to get people to follow me or join my
[1:12:35] church he said I come to restore a true
[1:12:38] relationship between Jesus Christ and
[1:12:41] man hallelujah thank God amen that's
[1:12:44] what he come to restore that's what we
[1:12:45] had that's what I have by God's grace if
[1:12:48] you're a believer that's what you have a
[1:12:49] real relationship with Jesus Christ how
[1:12:53] they do you now after this vision or
[1:13:02] this dream rather of storing up tapes
[1:13:07] he says it's on tapes it'll go worldwide
[1:13:10] where people in their houses the tapes
[1:13:14] will fall right into the hands of the
[1:13:16] predestinated of God he can direct the
[1:13:19] word he'll direct everything just
[1:13:22] exactly to its course that's three and
[1:13:25] he sent me back to do this store up the
[1:13:28] food here he forbid me to go overseas so
[1:13:32] just as Paul was forbidden to go into
[1:13:34] Asia brother Ram was forbidden to go
[1:13:36] overseas with brother argabright
[1:13:38] probably maybe you remember that vision
[1:13:40] or Argan bright was gonna take him over
[1:13:42] and one little boat to go to one little
[1:13:45] meeting and then take his wife and have
[1:13:47] him tour Africa but just preached one
[1:13:49] sermon brother Graham said no that
[1:13:51] doesn't seem like it's fitting to the
[1:13:53] Word of God and that's after that when
[1:13:55] he had no vision or the dream of the
[1:13:57] story of the tapes brother man who said
[1:14:05] I've pressed right up to the mark now
[1:14:08] but I don't know which way to go no we
[1:14:11] know why God was slowing him down in
[1:14:14] order to preach the seven seals right
[1:14:16] him to move out west go out west meet
[1:14:20] the seven angels God was slowing him
[1:14:22] down stirring up all those sermons and
[1:14:24] then bringing him back to preach the
[1:14:27] seven seals and the token and marriage
[1:14:30] and divorce to finish his ministry
[1:14:35] Lorenza don't know which way to go but
[1:14:38] there's ammunition layin all around me
[1:14:40] turds ah this word is our hand munition
[1:14:42] it's laid right in front of us
[1:14:44] keep shooting praise God keep keep
[1:14:47] pulling the hammer right keep trying to
[1:14:49] shoot eventually it's going to hit the
[1:14:51] target praise God program said he called
[1:14:56] me to evangelism because he called me to
[1:14:58] foreign missions as he called me to be
[1:14:59] his prophet might a pastor somewhere
[1:15:01] whatever I'm gonna do just keep throwing
[1:15:04] and shell pulling the hammer on it one
[1:15:06] of them will go off but I'm just not
[1:15:09] going to stand and say look or Lord you
[1:15:13] put the shell on the gun right so if
[1:15:15] you're another hunter but we have a BB
[1:15:18] gun a BB gun is not gonna fire itself
[1:15:21] right I've got to put the BB load it and
[1:15:24] then I'm al-qaida linear' malachi
[1:15:27] dedication like to shoot more so than I
[1:15:28] did but I was using that humans have to
[1:15:32] do something don't sit around and say
[1:15:34] come on God move look what the Word of
[1:15:37] God says obey it make sure have a
[1:15:40] leading to do it right we said the
[1:15:41] beginning David had a leading the wind
[1:15:43] in the Marberry bush but you might not
[1:15:46] see the results that you want to see
[1:15:47] right away but just whatever God has led
[1:15:49] you to do do it under the leadership of
[1:15:52] God be faithful to it and pretty soon
[1:15:55] God will bless you he says I'm gonna put
[1:15:59] the shell in the gun do the polling
[1:16:01] myself let him do the fire and he's the
[1:16:06] one to take care of that let me just
[1:16:09] keep moving on
[1:16:10] hallelujah brother he's gonna go out and
[1:16:15] preach an evangelistic messages he says
[1:16:18] so you've got something on your mind
[1:16:21] the people here once a church build as
[1:16:22] quick as you can get it up get your
[1:16:25] teachers and things you brethren how you
[1:16:28] are with your middle churches and you
[1:16:30] want to you're doing a work God will
[1:16:32] reward you for that go out there and
[1:16:35] preach doing everything you can look
[1:16:38] what you tell these preachers you don't
[1:16:39] to tell the play tapes preach the word
[1:16:41] then all of you get together a bunch of
[1:16:44] men have meetings talk on the deep
[1:16:45] things of Scripture
[1:16:50] now he goes back to giving them another
[1:16:52] reminder about if something rises up
[1:16:54] judge it by the word then if you find
[1:16:58] out look like something's moving up and
[1:17:01] you're just gonna find out it gets a
[1:17:03] little bit off the word then be careful
[1:17:06] no matter how good it looks stop right
[1:17:09] there
[1:17:09] a wrong spirit struck you coz the
[1:17:12] message of this day is back to the word
[1:17:17] this is this is beautiful you can say
[1:17:20] back to the tape although we respect the
[1:17:22] tapes back to the word so the message of
[1:17:25] the day is go back to the word and the
[1:17:28] tapes point us back to the word such a
[1:17:32] balance praise God then he gives an
[1:17:38] example you say oh brother Graham I'll
[1:17:40] tell you someone so why so is so stood
[1:17:42] the other night and us other things
[1:17:43] taking place he said watch it close
[1:17:46] don't renounce anything just wait and
[1:17:49] see how it acts so watch how the people
[1:17:52] act during their move and then watch how
[1:17:55] they act afterwards and then bring it up
[1:17:58] to the word and see how it compares with
[1:18:01] the word and if it compares with the
[1:18:04] word and everything is fine thank God
[1:18:06] and just keep moving on then see just as
[1:18:09] long as it stays in the word that's my
[1:18:13] opinion what I think you should do oh
[1:18:16] boy we're almost done here just a few
[1:18:19] more quotes and they'll be yeah bout 10
[1:18:22] minutes we'll have an hour so it's so
[1:18:28] clear Church is so beautiful brother and
[1:18:31] even says a scriptural Isle restore its
[1:18:34] God's system we have to go back to doing
[1:18:36] it just how Paul did it brother Graham
[1:18:41] name's the ministers that were there for
[1:18:44] the Neville Brothers Ruddle brother
[1:18:45] Crais brother Beeler for the June
[1:18:47] Jackson for the Terry Lynn Charlie Cox
[1:18:51] David there was at least nine men there
[1:18:54] he says God anoint you my I would like
[1:18:58] to pick up a handful of you to be an
[1:19:00] evangelism and set you somewhere see
[1:19:02] knowing that you've come up you can
[1:19:06] stand and know the message and study to
[1:19:09] prove yourself you feel you got a call
[1:19:12] on your life what do you quote second
[1:19:14] Timothy 2:15 study ourselves approved
[1:19:18] unto God as a minister not ashamed
[1:19:22] rightly dividing the word of truth
[1:19:25] praise God so seen brother man was just
[1:19:28] quoting scripture for preachers the
[1:19:31] whole time
[1:19:31] oh thank you Jesus he said I'm getting
[1:19:36] old brother Neville's getting old
[1:19:38] we're middle-aged men as time rolls on
[1:19:39] we're gonna be off the scene after a
[1:19:41] while you got to fill our shoes he says
[1:19:45] that maybe and that day even will be
[1:19:47] grow greater if there is a tomorrow some
[1:19:50] other man I thought the message might
[1:19:52] even grow greater in the future now we
[1:19:55] know one thing the latter rain would be
[1:19:57] the greatest anointing we've seen if we
[1:20:00] have to see it but it'll be a smaller
[1:20:02] group of people but greater anointing he
[1:20:08] said now that's what I think to you
[1:20:09] brethren you Minister said together
[1:20:11] discuss the things you gotta have
[1:20:14] fellowship somewhere you gotta have
[1:20:16] something to come together kind of talk
[1:20:17] about you all come together as a group
[1:20:21] of men but leave one with another like
[1:20:23] that discuss these problems sent out
[1:20:25] maybe once a month just ministers alone
[1:20:28] and then he says when he travels back
[1:20:30] around he'll visit them and meet with
[1:20:34] the ministers I don't know if this ever
[1:20:36] happened but this is on tape this was
[1:20:38] his vision for the brother
[1:20:45] and if you can get the preacher straight
[1:20:48] and him going right look what he's going
[1:20:54] to do he's gonna influence it would take
[1:20:59] care of hundreds of these things or
[1:21:01] problems that's it
[1:21:03] we're just beating at you see we've got
[1:21:06] to get it a system God's system so we
[1:21:10] can clearly see God's system just like
[1:21:12] Paul is for the the senior elder man to
[1:21:16] teach the younger man and then these
[1:21:18] younger men are sent out and they teach
[1:21:20] others that's thank God we're living in
[1:21:24] that right now in our church thank God
[1:21:26] problems all solved my connection is
[1:21:31] unstable
[1:21:34] well Lord willing we'll try to finish up
[1:21:36] here sorry Church if is if you're losing
[1:21:38] us sorry this computer is as far away
[1:21:43] from the router as possible I gotta find
[1:21:46] a maybe I need to find a better place to
[1:21:48] put it maybe next week
[1:21:52] and then brother RAM quotes the
[1:21:55] scripture of Jethro telling Moses you
[1:21:59] have too much burden on you you need to
[1:22:02] have other men help you that's what you
[1:22:03] read out of numbers 11 and that he said
[1:22:09] that was God's Way back there that was
[1:22:12] God's Way in the early church age I mean
[1:22:14] that's God's Way now right for us to do
[1:22:16] it so just quit talking about it and do
[1:22:19] it numbers 11 God took the spirit on
[1:22:23] Moses and put it upon the people the
[1:22:27] other 70 men that they could judge the
[1:22:29] easy things and the hard things they
[1:22:32] couldn't judge they'd bring it to Moses
[1:22:34] so Moses had a lot less work to do at
[1:22:38] church that's what I believe happened
[1:22:39] today if I'm born again of the real
[1:22:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost the token life
[1:22:43] of Jesus Christ I've got the same spirit
[1:22:46] as brother Brendan the Holy Spirit now
[1:22:48] not the same gifts but the same Holy
[1:22:51] Spirit that will still rightly divide
[1:22:53] the word of truth it will continue going
[1:22:56] on
[1:22:57] rightly invited rightly to
[1:22:58] fighting the word of truth if that was
[1:23:03] God's Way then with Paul Polycarp you
[1:23:06] know John Paulette carp are anus it has
[1:23:08] to be God's Way today then brother Ram
[1:23:14] with his prayer before he gets into the
[1:23:16] regular sermon part he prays for a sick
[1:23:20] woman but then he starts praying for the
[1:23:22] preachers here and we'll close with this
[1:23:26] right on time 824 man prays Oh Heavenly
[1:23:32] Father I'm thinking of maybe when I
[1:23:33] rainiest sat with his group of ministers
[1:23:35] he said on cold slabs of rock
[1:23:41] he said they knew they were going to be
[1:23:43] fed to the Lions and died as martyrs but
[1:23:47] the faith of our fathers is living still
[1:23:50] in spite of the dungeon the flame and
[1:23:53] the sword I thank you Lord for these men
[1:23:57] I pray that you'll bless them
[1:23:59] now bless each of them in thy name that
[1:24:02] you will keep them in the faith that was
[1:24:04] once delivered to the Saints that never
[1:24:09] will they vary from that see any
[1:24:12] direction out of this word and out of
[1:24:15] this group may you send pastors teachers
[1:24:19] and evangelist oh God granted and may
[1:24:23] they hold the fort everywhere wherever
[1:24:27] they are may they continually work until
[1:24:31] Jesus comes god bless you let's stand
[1:24:33] praise God that was just perfect timing
[1:24:37] thank the Lord now we could have read
[1:24:44] more you know almost the entire chapter
[1:24:47] of numbers 11 is about Moses he he's
[1:24:52] dealing with problems
[1:24:53] he gets so overwhelmed he said God did I
[1:24:56] did I bear and conceived all the night
[1:24:58] bring forth all these children these two
[1:25:00] million people complaining and so God
[1:25:04] hears Moses's desperate prayer and then
[1:25:07] divides that spirit multiplies it upon
[1:25:11] the people and then all the saints they
[1:25:14] got that spirit start prophesying and
[1:25:16] somebody says Moses tell him to be quiet
[1:25:18] and Moses said to to God that all men
[1:25:22] would prophesy in other words Moses was
[1:25:26] rejoicing that each person is
[1:25:27] the ministry had found an anointing
[1:25:30] that's what I desire for our church
[1:25:32] everybody can find us on the North thing
