========================================

god bless you let's end our feet by god's grace we'll get into the word of god let's go to ephesians 3. we're going to finish this chapter today lord willing or this revelation on the mystery of uh the jew and gentile church praise god it's been just a tremendous uh series here for me just seeing how it all ties together and the importance of it you know sister naomi and brother william really helped me to understand the real importance of this and how it really relates to today the unity in a local church you know not having any division amongst rich or poor young or old you know no matter the there's no differences we're all one body praise god we're all one bunch of believers holy ghost filled saints praise god there's no better people in the whole world than that church praise god let's go to ephesians chapter 3 and then we'll read our memory verse your sister who a beautiful beautiful text there ephesians chapter 3 verse 3. ephesians 3 verse 3. now i'll just read by myself until uh verse six okay so let me read three four five i'll read that myself three four five and then we'll all read six together okay it's a little bit longer text here how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery christ gave paul this mystery as i wrote a four in a few words whereby when ye read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ so see some people are so against knowledge and understanding and doctrine that if they do that they're actually rejecting the mystery of god right because they think oh it's intellectual it's all well god brother said god wants you to use both you want to use your intellect and your emotion you've got to use both of them praise god verse 5 which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit let's read verse 6 together ready one two three that the gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel praise god let's go to jeremiah 29 11 please so as you're turning there again i'll let you know before we change service time so this sunday will be the same it'll be 11 and 4 this sunday what i need to do i need to buy up a bunch of more books though um i need like a a bigger uh stash of them and then you know we'll pray about maybe starting that here maybe in august or something like that because we got a couple more weeks of july to kind of prepare and pray so just i'll let you know when we do if we do a change when we go to that jeremiah here 29 let's read 11 12 and 13 1 2 3 for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end then shall ye call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart let's have one more word of prayer let's have our heads for word of prayer every need on your heart just make it known to god it's it's wonderful to be in god's presence he inhabits the praises of his people we know he he's with to wherever two or three are gathered he's here tonight saints the lord jesus christ his holy spirit is here tonight let's humbly uh pray and acknowledge that here tonight heavenly father we love you we know you're here by promise by spirit lord we feel the sacredness of the holy spirit you promise the lord god as we praise you with that joy in our hearts as we feel that wonderful feeling of your holy ghost lord god that's reminding us you inhabit the praises of your people we praise you tonight we know you're here lord meet every need speak to our hearts open your word to us so god give us the knowledge of the mystery in christ oh god give us understanding lord god and we give you thanks and praise for all you've done every good and perfect gift you've given to us we give you thanks and praise and minister now by the holy spirit in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless yours being seated praise god so last week we finished with the the prophetic calendar of the seven feasts of israel uh that's in course chapter three uh in the book which lord willing you have on sunday and then church you know if you pray about it let me know if you want copies for your family or something like that i can just i can just type it in i can mail right to them i just need their address you know i don't know about overseas i don't know about that so hold up on the overseas one i don't i don't know how that works you know i've never mailed things overseas but if there's anyone in the u.s you know i could easily do that but so here we will finish up i want to end this with the rewards and consequences for either receiving this revelation or rejecting it you know every that's one thing when i started studying this this topic i realized if god has a mystery well there must be a reward for receiving it right but there must also be a consequence of rejecting it right it's like with the baptism of the holy ghost if someone rejects that while they they're either going to be foolish virgin make believer or unbeliever right they're going to be one of those but if they receive it they're going to be the wise virgin praise god they're going to be the wife of heaven praise god or the wife of christ the queen of heaven i mean what a great reward praise god being a king and priest on this earth i mean what a tremendous blessing praise god like i was telling with amen remember when you reached over and prayed for him you were like a priest unto god you were you were interceding in his sickness and he was instantly healed that was you know a while ago but that was just a beautiful example of being a priestess unto god i thought i was sharing with that him on sunday there just as a reminder like look how look how uh look how humble it is right look how look how simple it is you know you're just you're laying there in bed and you just you've got that you have to have the faith to lay your hand on your husband and intercede just like that in a moment's time it didn't take a prayer meeting it just took faith it just took following leadership of the lord i mean what a what a beautiful example of that praise god i just thought that's just such a godly example of christ you know uh how simple this is it god's revelations are that way god's mysteries are that way they're so simple if you don't humble yourself it'll go right over top of your head so thank god we've humbled ourselves praise god that we can receive the revelations of the mysteries of god amen and so this mystery is that god has joined jew and gentile into one body or one temple with all the same rights uh blessings privileges privileges rather and fellowship so the first uh reward for receiving this as far as i was studying was it was called fellowship so the first reward is fellowship okay which also means partnership okay so the bible paul says all men can see the fellowship of the mystery that's what paul says in ephesians 1. he said all men can see the fellowship and that word means partnership so church when we get a revelation we actually start realizing who our partners are but i'll say like this realize who they're not as well right like we're not partnering with the roman catholic church right we're not going to partner with them we're trying to call them out praise god so see that shows they don't have the revelation of the mystery because when you get the revelation of the mystery it shows you who your partners are amen at church we can partner with the foolish virgin like abraham partner with lot right and thank god they did partnership because lot got saved through it hey praise god and it made lot an intercessor i'm sorry i made abraham an intercessor for love praise god because the bible records that god heard abraham's prayer and sent angels down the side of and pulled out lot right out of sound that's what god's doing with us making us intercessors praise god don't mean to punch things but to pull out his people out of those systems thank god he pulled you out and now god wants to pull some more out praise god just like simon preached to us praise god i thought that was a vindication that we're supposed to go out and call people out of denominations hallelujah do i expect some persecution yes do i expect some rejection yes do i expect to get pushed out of churches well hopefully not but but i do expect uh that i'll get to partner with somebody praise god you know partner and and uh and benefit benefit from godly partnership like the people we pray for jose that got babies they don't even go to message churches i don't even know if my co-worker goes to church but god we partnered with them to be a blessing to them but man said that's the reward of a prophet you just you know when you minister to him are you you honor a prophet he said he might pray for you he might do something nice for you to pray for you and so we got the prophet's message right and so we're we're with the authority of the bible through a prophet we're able to bless people and partner with them to be a blessing to them that rabbi said that's what god wants to do he wants to bless his people he said god wants to make life a little easier for me human and mankind on this earth that's what we're here for blessing other people praise god because remember the blessing comes for you you're abraham's children praise god and through you the whole world is blessed through you and i praise god and all the saints all of abraham's seed the word is blessed like those saints that god blessed with those prayer costs brother jose right got healing they got blessed through you right through because god is blessing the world through the seed of abraham the spiritual seed of abram and boy he looks like abraham today don't he simon loves that but i just thought i bought joking there simon could hardly compliment that any higher brother oh thank god now back to the facts back to the reality it's a godly partnership no matter your race culture or skin color god doesn't he he doesn't divide us on that like the democrats and some republicans do he unites us on those things amen because we see there's something greater than that it's the image of christ that we see in people not the physical image but the spiritual image the character of christ amen that we see behind people's lives remember this is just a this is just a coat praise god the real me is inside of this praise god it doesn't matter so much what's on the outside it matters what's on the inside amen so we partner mainly we partner in prayer and helping out with physical needs and spreading the gospel just like paul told those philippians he said you're the only one that met my financial needs uh in philippians chapter four you're the only one that ministered unto my necessities right so that was a partnership god said god looked down at paul and said well my prophet needs a partner i'm going to anoint those philippian church i'm anoint them to partner with paul gentiles with the jew see partnering together see someone see church that's what we got to be we just got to be a blessing we just got to be a partnership to somebody praise god so just so you know this week uh i don't know if they heard my sermon last week how i'm giving out more offerings but somebody uh from uganda sent me a uh a message so i sent them a little love offering this week so we're trying to and i i know they're really hurt you know they've always been that nation's destitute you know it's in the horn of africa ma that's just such a destitute area so the brother's like i can't find a job we got no food i'm like okay i'll send a little love offering there may god bless you he thanked me for it i hope that's what he's using it for you know i mean but jesus didn't say ask what were they going to do with the money jesus said give he said give and hope for nothing in return amen hallelujah so we just gotta follow the words of christ amen so see partnering we gotta partner with people to meet their spiritual and physical needs so you know putting that test you know i told brother amen about that testimony about that woman having the baby i told amen about that and who was the one that asked me to give that testimony it was amen so amen said brothers yes give your testimony i remember jose's testimony there we prayed for that two two couples had the babies and so i so amen is the one that inspired me to do it i give the testimony it goes online and i don't even know where this woman lives she must live in the u.s but she watches it and shortly thereafter she conceives and has the baby see we just partner together like i wasn't really wanting to give my testimony but amen would like me to give it so i said okay i'll give it you know and that isn't that awesome blessing you know here we are over a year after that was put on the internet and we're getting testimonies just about how god see church god knows who wants his word and god will use any channel to get his word to his people praise god it might be a track it might be a sermon live it might be through a tape right it might be through an internet god is going to make sure his word gets to those predestinated seeds he has a need to go by uganda he has a need to go by we'll say akron he has a need to go by europe when he has needs he's going to meet those needs he's going to find somebody who's willing to meet those needs he's going to anoint them and they can be used for god's glory because their partnership they're partnering with the fellowship of the mystery praise god amen all men can see the fellowship of the mystery hallelujah so that's church that's one way that that's one reward we get to partner with people to help out sinners saints whoever it would be if we receive this revelation we'll start seeing wow we can really partner to do more for the kingdom of god we can do more together and of course locally you know preachers want to cooperate within cities now i know cities where preachers won't even shake hands i've had friends from north carolina come up here brother they have message churches they say just across the road and they don't even fellowship and that is that a shame in america but the bible says in galatians 2 that when james cephas and john were pillars and perceived grace was given to paul gave to paul barnabas the right hands of fellowship so see there's that partnership it's preachers working together praise god no no no of course remember we have to uh you have to discern someone brother say you have to discern someone's spirit before you you trust them right he said you got to discern their spirit so you know before i'll partner with a preacher i got to discern their spirit and make sure they got the right spirit right just want to partner with somebody that well just because they say they believe the message there's a lot of people that say they believe the message they don't believe the message their lives tell a different story so as we partner with people we've also also got to discern their spirit and watch the fruits of their lives what are their lives producing and it should look very similar praise god it should look very similar to our lives they should have the same gospel they shall they should preach the same gospel they should live the same kind of lives they should have the same desires we have not to be rich in this world but to be rich in treasures in heaven amen we should get that same spirit we should catch that same spirit that they're motivated by the same things we are okay so that's the first reward partnership we get to partner to help people and partner with ministries now the second reward is benefiting from god's promises or these are called inheritances right paul says all spirit-filled jews and gentiles are fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel that's ephesians 3 6 we read that tonight so we are all partakers so in other words we can all go to the same fountain and drink praise god so jesus christ is a fountain of living water he's living water we can all go to that water when we're thirsty and partake church let's not keep people out let's invite them in praise god let's invite them in we can all be partakers of the promises of god this person needs healing oh can i pray for you you can partake of the promise of healing oh you need salvation you need sanctification oh come here i know i know something that can help you out uh there's these great promises and through these promises we are partakers of the divine nature amen there's that good word nature again see it's this is what paul says are the rewards partnership to help and then also partake of the promises we're all privileges with the same privilege with the same promises and eternal rewards as well as the earthly benefits of our salvation so that's also salvation divine healing gifts of the holy spirit fruits of the holy spirit and more praise god now it seems like i'm missing something here on my notes okay no no no i didn't get again okay yeah that's uh that's something else okay now church the bible says we should have confidence boldness and access with confidence to heaven's only high priest jesus christ so when we have a need we have to remember we have a high priest who can make intercession and give us the promise that we're hoping for praise god and so we must go there with boldness and confidence i know it's hard that's you know god's greatest enemy is time right and so sometimes we may not feel as confident as always but we've got to continue we got to encourage ourselves in the lord and if we you know we can't encourage ourselves go talk to somebody who will encourage us right call somebody you know that will encourage you if you can't encourage yourself go call somebody who's on fire right get or just go listen to your favorite sermon or with a favorite one brother and preacher whatever one be encouraged because the bible said we have to pray prayers of faith not prayers of unbelief or prayers of hope we got to play pray prayers of faith with boldness and confidence and not lose our confession of faith because faithful is he that promised amen that's why i read that testimony from tonight my just a few just a few weeks after hearing our testimony god answered that woman in a few weeks or days after hearing that prayer god answered that prayer you know administered to this person and so see that should encourage us to keep coming with boldness and confidence keep believing keep trusting show some perseverance praise god amen show some dedication we should uh we should show some confidence that the same god who's answered before we'll answer again amen and his timing is the best timing how many can say amen to that praise god god's timing is always the best see faithful prayers of jew and gentiles they touch the heart of god through the son because the bible says he feels our pain and is ever lives to make intercession for us oh my church god feels what you're going through praise god jesus feels it jesus is god right jesus feels the pain he knows the suffering he knows the hurt and because of that he said i'll wait to the right time to answer that request surely i'll answer that request because i can relate to that our high priest can be touched and our high priest never dies amen he's after the order of melchizedek he cannot die amen he died but now he's alive forevermore amen aaron and them all died they all died but jesus died but rose again and he's a priest forever after the order the divine appointment of melchizedek amen in other words just as melchizedek was appointed by god now keswick was not appointed by men melchizedek was appointed by god but see aaron and all aaron's sons were appointed by men and that's why it's a different priest and that's the order of aaron but we're under the priest jesus christ who was not appointed by man he was appointed by god amen and because of that you know he's faithful you know he's divine you know he'll answer he's infallible he'll never fail he'll never change he's the same yesterday today and forever amen hallelujah have confidence in god praise the lord let's have confidence in the lord jesus christ he can talk he can be touched and he can feel your pain whenever i sigh and cry for the abomination of this city i feel like i've touched the heart of god do you feel that way too brother whenever i whenever i'm the most sincere in my prayers i feel like i've touched his heart do you feel like that like i almost feel like i'm going to burst inside like i don't even know how i can express this in any other way than weeping and crying and you know interceding for people see what have we done we've touched the heart of god amen we're like david we're a church after the heart of christ amen we're after his very heart because because i always always at the end of every prayer we can always say lord let your will be done not mine and i know you feel my request i know you feel my pain but ultimately i know you feel my faith and my confidence that you will answer in your time amen praise god that's beautiful now church give me a moment i just had a thought here um oh yeah bear with me here uh i had a list of rewards i just want to rehearse with you real quickly here i just just trust the holy spirit will help me to find it real quick i think you could give a drink of water i think was one of the rewards so in the book i forget which chapter it is this thing is searching for it oh man maybe it's a cup of water ah anyways i put in the book there are 16 rewards let's see chapter eight is probably around like page 400 to 500. and i think i went over them before but there's uh unless there's 16 equal opportunity rewards okay that's the parable of the pounds okay now i got that's right parable of pounds i appreciate your patience i've ever told you that church you're a lovely group you're very patient i like how brotherham says that he said you're a good class okay here they are i found them thank the lord you get reward church everybody has everybody here has the same opportunity to gain all these rewards right here if you withstand persecution you get a great heavenly reward if you give alms in secret you have an open reward that people will see in public if you pray in secret you get an open reward if you fast in secret you get an open public reward if you receive a prophet or a righteous man you receive a prophets or righteous man's reward like we just said the benefits of knowing the prophet amen and all the revelation that he gives us if you provide food drink shelter or clothes to a christian or visit someone when they're sick or in prison it yields an entrance into life eternal according to jesus if you give an apostle a cup of water for christ's sake it yields a reward if you love your enemies bless those who persecute you pray for those who despitefully use you lending with no hope of repayment yields a great reward along with the title of being called the children of the highest amen i believe that makes you a child of god when you give food or your time or money and you don't want nothing back that proves you're a child of the king hosting a feast for someone less fortunate resurrection of the just think about the rewards people are going to have fighting the good fight of faith finishing the course keeping the christian faith yields a crowd of righteousness how many want to wear a crown we sing that song we shall wear a crown in that new jerusalem you gotta fight first he won the crown everybody wants the crown without the fight we'll fight right now let's keep overcoming praise let's keep driving back the enemy praise god let's conquer our jericho's amen let's conquer our ais let's conquer all these enemies that have come against us the the kings and and the the the demons of this world and the spiritual wickedness high places let's overcome it let's be more than conquerors amen let's earn that crowd of righteousness if you provide a christian's physical necessities it yields a heavenly reward upon a giver's account if you do anything heartily ask to the lord you'll read the you'll yield the reward of the inheritance the bible says that's a let's just it's kind of a new one as far as understanding that one so see whatever you do harder that's why i want to encourage our mothers just keep loving your children do it love your children like serve your children like you'd serve jesus and us husbands let's serve our wives and our children and our grandchildren like jesus like we're serving jesus because that will yield your reward of an inheritance that's colossians 3 23-24 diligently seeking god yields rewards got a couple more enduring temptation yields the crown of eternal life james 1 12. visiting the fatherless and widows keeping oneself unspotted from the world yields the reward of spiritual purity so church if you know somebody who doesn't have a dad let me know we can visit them and help them out that's real religion especially when they're affliction the bible says and last overcoming during any of the seven church aces ages yields the reward of inheriting all things in the church ages such as the tree of life you're eating from the tree of life escaping the second death eating the hidden manna a white stone with a new name within power to rule over nations the morning star white raiment having your name written in the book of life being a pillar of the temple of god having jesus's new name having god's new name having new jerusalem's new name written upon you and sitting with jesus in his throne sounds like some mighty rewards to me praise god just for living a christian holy life amen god help us to obtain those amen and the whole time we get to partner with other people doing it so see church you aren't alone i mean you don't have to do this all by yourself you can partner you can say brother william can you go with me to do donate this or can you go with me to go help the jose can you go pray with me with somebody we can do that we don't have to do it alone we can do it together praise god because we're partners in the gospel church you're not alone praise god you're not alone how many know jesus is with you praise god absolutely now let's look at the consequences here and i want to end with a little more on the lukewarmness we looked at that sunday night i started studying that just real briefly and i was shocked brother ram never said he was lukewarm brother i've never said a holy ghost-filled christian is lukewarm it was always the sinners so church you ain't lukewarm if you're born again you're not lukewarm impossible you might feel tired we'll get more sleep or eat better food praise god right right or you might be weary or worn out well give your mind to rest right study the word more pray more right go to somebody for encouragement we just said right try find a way to think the thoughts of god limit your time on other things and put more time on the word of god very simple good in good out holiness in holiness out praise god feed the white dog yeah very simple how many can say amen very simple amen okay consequences of rejecting the revelation i find at least three in the bible first is prideful discrimination which we've already preached on that one quite extensively cursing the blessed that's another consequence if you reject this revelation and the third is complacency that's the one where we've got to watch out for that paul said so i'm not it's not just me paul said that so let's go let's start with the first one we know peter pridefully discriminated against the gentiles he thought they were unclean he was to be blamed that means to find fault with or condemn so he was temporarily condemned not eternally and the church said not permanently condemned oh i made one mistake everybody's going to think less of me well that's that mean people might think lest you but a real christian will think more of you if you make it right brother brahm said people thought more of him when he confessed his sins to them praise god see because most people hide their sin hallelujah most people are high but if we humble ourselves and confess our sin to someone that we sinned against them those people think more of us so peter was temporarily in fault he was temporarily condemned but god knew this and god said i'll send somebody with the holy ghost to correct them and it wasn't very it wasn't privately it was publicly in the midst of all the brethren peter come up and rebuke him but we know that he must have got right with the lord praise god so see church we must not be like that and think we're more holy than other groups that have the holy ghost now see did those gentiles have the holy ghost yes did peter have the holy ghost yes but he thought well these holy ghost people i'm still i'm still bringing up their past their past still makes them unclean and god had already said don't call unclean when i've cleansed praise god so see if someone's got the holy ghost they're just as clean as you they're just as saved as you they're just as filled with the holy ghost as you show them some fellowship now unless they're sinning right show them some a partnership partner with them in the gospel don't separate yourself last one not having the holy spirit unite with those people be a help to them have fellowship with them uh pull up jude 1 9 there sister sister 12 year old sister jude 1 19. i'm sorry jude 1 19. so one consequence is when people separate themselves from us sometimes it proves they just weren't born again that's what i like when you guys hang around for a long time that proves you're born again i like seeing you you all come so much i proved you're born again see these were they who separate themselves sensual not having the holy spirit see one proof you're born again is that you don't separate yourself and live in your sin and live in your lust but you come to the house of god you meet with other christians because you know there's a holy fire there you know there's cleansing there there's washing there there's forgiveness there there's fellowship there that's what god loves god loves unity not division and people that leave this church if it's under the wrong terms it proves they're not born again but people that stay here that proves you've got god's spirit amen that's what the bible said not me same thing in uh you know hebrews 10 24 gather more as you see that day approaching the only people some of these people gather with are their unsaved family members that's the people they gather more with instead of saints now you tell me they're born again nonsense the people that gather together more with saints those are the people that are born again they've got the holy spirit why because they're able to lay aside confess all their sins and leave their homes and come together under one purpose one banner one fellowship one goal and that's to magnify jesus christ and watch him pray watch till he comes and meets us in the air praise god amen so we're not going to pridefully discriminate from other saints that have the holy ghost and we went through that now the second consequence is cursing the blessed you might be surprised but there's a lot of people that curse other message people we've seen it right we've seen a sister they'll curse other message people that shows these people are blind right they're just blind i don't know if they're saved or lost but cursing the blessed is a sin because you cannot curse what god has blessed see a lot of some gentiles think israel is forever cursed and so they condemn all the jews in their angry hearts for crucifying their own messiah do you know do you know martin luther did that i was studying on martin luther out of those history books martin luther called the jews listen a satan's brood what's a brood like a brood of vipers right martin luther said the jews were a serpent's brood he's calling them devils because they they rejected christ and you know church some of his writings caused his followers to go burn their synagogues did you know that look at i got the book it's broadband do you know that his writings were so harsh against jews that they burnt down jewish synagogues in the name of christ now church that shows that that shows they didn't have all the revelation we have today luther says they're serpents god says they're just blinded they're just blind like like joseph's blinded brothers that's what now martin luther was a mighty man of god he had nine all nine gifts of the holy ghost he wrote some of the most beautiful writings on justification to this day he wrote 95 theses against the roman catholic church i mean he laid it all out all the things they were guilty of he was last time you counted all their heirs you know 95 heirs he was a man of god but in this area he was blinded and he basically cursed those who god had blessed because they're still under the mosaic and abrahamic covenants amen and god cannot forget one promised word of his word amen he will not let one word fall to the ground because our god is faithful amen he never forgets his promises amen amen yep martin luther church here's what happened pull up second timothy 2 26 second timothy 2 26. i appreciate you doing that with all that busyness on your laughter second timothy 2 26 he must have been caught in the snare of the enemy in other words complex can i just say like that and they that may recover themselves out of the snare remember some talk about snares of the devil who are taken captive by him at his will so anytime we get a complex against somebody mistreat them and we're we're mean to them we're dirty to them or whatever anger towards them we shouldn't be we've fallen into a trap of the enemy and we got to say we got to pray to god and say god give me victory i'm caught in this snare i'm trapped and i can't get out i need your help now church that's the kind of prayer that god will respond to when israel was by the red sea they said we are in this trap we can't get out what did god do he part of the waters amen god always makes a way if you want to be free if you and i want to be free of any any trouble we just got to call on the lord admit we're failures confess any sins and god will bring us out of the snare praise god then we'll be free in jesus name hallelujah i love god's grace he called him a serpent's brood see what happened church martin luther got a little root of bitterness he saw those jews they despised jesus they probably mistreated the christians in his day i don't know but he led a little root of bitterness he got the wrong seed in there he got to see the discrepancy right just a small one right and and just in his human spirit not in his soul in his human spirit and we got to be careful who we curse right that's why i will just keep praying for anybody even if they blaspheme i'll keep praying for them until i would feel god say don't pray for them because i was guilty of blasphemy at one time and god had mercy on me praise god amen and paul blaspheme but god had mercy on him praise god i guess i'm just on the mercy of god's side until god would give me some other revelation now the last one before i close here let me give me 15 minutes here i'll try to close at eight and we'll see the last is the one that we battle complacency now church get your bibles go to romans 11 18. this was such a beautiful thought the holy spirit brought to me i believe romans 11 18. did you ever catch this paul warns the christians you know you've got you've got grace but if you don't take care of that revelation you're going to become prideful and complacent and then god will cut you off so see but if you don't take advantage of it you become complacent and it's as if you've rejected the revelation because you're not taking advantage of the revelation folks not see brag not against the branches don't brag against the jews right don't don't brag over the jews but if thou boast i'll bear us not the root but the root thee next verse that will say then the branches were broken off that i might be wrapped in that's true verse 20. well because of unbelief they're broken off and now standeth by faith be not high-minded but fear so the very fact that you know god has turned to the gentiles and he's blinded most of the jews that can make someone prideful that could make them high-minded like oh god's with us now we're so much better than them next verse we really got to watch our attitudes and take advantage of this this message that we have for god's spare not the natural branches he also spare not thee see church now is just leave that up there isn't that interesting brother adam says the main thing a christian needs is rest remember that brother hebrew series right how many are arresting your salvation in christ jesus tonight so our soul rests but in our minds we've got to be sharp and say i can't let this slip i've got to be about my father's business see so in other words at the same time i got to be resting that i'm saved wrestling that i'm filled with the holy ghost but in my mind i got to be thinking lord help me to be faithful help me be diligent help me to take advantage of this opportunity help me not to waste a moment praise god not that i'm going to be lost but here he says take heed let's not he spare thee also so in other words be humble keep in mind god can do without you god don't have to have you and me i don't have to have a church in actor he can just wipe us off the map he can do whatever he wants he can take us all to heaven whatever whatever wants to do let us not be prideful let's be humble let us partner with other people whether it's lot right or another abraham or the seed of abraham let us have that revelation and be thankful for what god has given to us and make the most of this opportunity because we all have these same opportunities to earn these rewards that's why you're in church tonight right is that why your church tonight you don't want to miss out on any opportunity to hear god speak to you that's why i'm in church tonight see go get prideful and don't get complacent recognize the mind has to be renewed every day be renewed in the spirit of your mind daily paul said be renewed daily by the renewing of the holy ghost so it's such a paradox brother we are resting in here i'm i'm saved i'm on my way to heaven i'm on my way to heaven i'm shouting victory but up here we're like oh lord help me not to miss a moment right help me have to miss this opportunity today it could be the day i witnessed somebody and somebody come to church because i witnessed him that's what happened to me for the m.j today could be the day i don't want to miss it i want to be ready to give an answer for the hope that i have within me praise god always want to be ready somebody needs me to pray if i get an email i get a lot of them but if i can email ask for a prayer god help me to pray a sincere prayer tell me not to just delete it or help me not to say well somebody else will pray for help me to humble myself help me to make the most of this opportunity because i might get an email later saying god heard the prayer amen i'm just making it real for us right i'm just trying to make it real to see how these things all these are spiritual principles and laws that are true and god honors his word amen see church we're tempted we're tempted by the enemy to boast or brag because we've got grace but we must continue in the goodness or else we'll be cut off due to complacency and remember this complacency is the same condition of lukewarmness falling upon the gentile churches in the last days according to the letter to the laodiceans church we must constantly keep the spirit of revival revive means to bring back from the dead your soul can never be dead anymore if it's got eternal life amen your soul can never die praise god but your mind your mind has thoughts that die right yeah your good thoughts are all dead and all you where where'd they go where'd all your good thoughts and good feelings and all those good feelings from sunday where'd they go well they got to be renewed that's where we die in our minds right our good anointing leaves so we need a fresh anointing we need a revived mind amen praise god we need our thoughts revived is what we need not your soul your body doesn't need revive you're alive thank god you're in the land of the living praise god it's your mind that needs revived because your soul is already at rest amen your soul already has eternal life it's sealed it's marked to the day of redemption amen you're born from heaven it's the incorruptible seed of god it's birth inside of you it's growing but ram said it starts like the size of a button and it keeps getting bigger and bigger that anointing keeps growing praise god god's life is in you that's not where you're dead you're dead in your thoughts we get complacent in our thinking our words so we must realize i need revival today and i'm going to hunger and thirst for god's righteousness remember church you should be living a more holy life all the time okay shall put up second corinthians 7 1. this is one of my favorite scriptures in the whole bible and this is the one where all the denominations fail right where they many of them give you a license to sin but not the word of god the word of god said having these promises dearly beloved cleanse ourselves from some he got it all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god church when you meet a saint like william or beatrice you know they've been the messages jose you've been the messenger a long time your life gets more holy you get more obedient to the holy spirit at least you should if you're born again right see you're you should enjoy hope you should enjoy holiness more you should enjoy serving god more yeah you're gonna have battles but your desire is to get all the filthiness out of me get all the evil out of me and god help me to perfect holiness help me to be a christian that's completely holy completely yielded to you that you can do your will in my life not just wednesday and sunday but every day you can't stay com complacent you can't stay the same you won't let yourself uh fall behind you and i must keep pressing on toward the mark of the high calling in christ jesus we must keep going back to the bath of god's word and be washed in those hot waters and the soap the fuller soap amen of the holy ghost praise god let the husband wash his bride amen shall be washed with the waters of the word hallelujah thank the lord now friends i want to close this you stop the live stream here i just wanted to say a few things god bless all the livestreamers love you all brother amen thanks all the saints
