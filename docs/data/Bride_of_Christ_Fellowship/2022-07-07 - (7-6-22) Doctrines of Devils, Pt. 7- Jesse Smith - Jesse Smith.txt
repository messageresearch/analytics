TRANSCRIPT
========================================
second peter 2 18. you know i said earlier i wasn't quite done with that doctrines of devils series so i'd like to kind of go back to that here tonight my god's grace has been studying along those lines and it's a preaching sunday a lot of preaching right no teaching early sunday and last wednesday a lot of preaching no teaching so i'm gonna get back a little teaching here tonight by god's grace we need both like i was telling that brother you know from overseas i said jesus both preached and taught praise god so it's a great reminder to us that we need both by god's grace second peter 2 18 and 19 and i know i'm a little heavy on teaching so i asked god to give me some more preaching inspiration about god's grace but tonight i do feel like i want to get this thought across too second peter 2 18 and 19. i kind of got this thought while brother jim was preaching so he had said a few things and kind of inspired me to get back to this thought here second peter 2 18 and 19. this is the seventh sermon on doctrines of devils it's our fourteenth sermon on just doctrine in general but this is doctrines of devils part seven so verse 18 second peter 2 18. i'll read 18 and then we can read 19 together for when they speak great swelling words of vanity now that's what we're seeing in the message that people just speak such great swelling words it's really not scriptural we'll look at that again tonight these swelling words they seem so great and so impressive but it's really a false doctrine that's right they the bible says they allure through the lusts of the flesh so as they make these great promises they actually allow fleshly lust on the side so they'll preach great things in front of you but then they allow they won't preach on certain lust of the flesh they'll allow that through much when timeless i can never say that word when timeless those that were clean escape from them who live in error to see where they lead these great swelling words lead people into heirs and verse 19 let's read that one two three while they promised them liberty they themselves are the servants of corruption for of whom a man is overcome of the same as he brought in which praise god so whenever a false doctrine overcomes a preacher it likely then overcomes the congregation praise god so that's why we want we want a sound doctrine the bible says no one doctors of devils amen let's have one more word of prayer if we can't hear tonight heavenly father i'm your servant lord speak my lord i come lord send me lord you've sent me here lord to akron many years ago lord god i didn't know i would preach here i didn't know i'd be a christian here lord you sent me here lord here am i i'm here now lord speak through me lord jesus i'm just at my post of duty i'm nothing i know i'm no preacher there's only one preacher that's the lord jesus christ so father we just ask that your holy spirit would take control you deserve all the worship you're worthy of every song whether you say yes no or wait lord you're worthy about praise god so i trust you lord god i trust you with my life i trust you with this church lord god you're the only one that can feed your sheep you're the great shepherd yes i'm a minor a very insignificant tool here so but lord i come i'm the public servant so i've got to come here and labor so father help me to get away from my thoughts and get into your thoughts lord god yes minister your people speak a word of life lord preach through me teach through me lord i feel like i i know the thoughts the lord let your mind come upon the scene we pray in a greater way and bless your people who press their way out to the house of god pour out abundant blessings on them lord for those livestreaming minister of them lord there's numerous ones that are contacting over the weeks that don't have a home church and they kind of rely on our services and they're grateful for some of these series the lord thank you god it always keeps me humble to know that your word will not return void lord it goes out there lord it will establish it will accomplish all that you've ordained it so father god minister to those that need a word tonight father god we're just in all of you lord you're the only one who can uh help us and strengthen us so god strengthen us help us to be mighty men and women for the kingdom of god amen in jesus christ's name the saint said amen amen god bless you should be in please god i do have some slides here uh we'll kind of see how far we can get by god's grace i probably have one more mighty man sermon i did part two sunday but i probably have one more uh maybe a couple more we'll kind of see how that goes by the grace of god i'd like to look at part seven here tonight let me do it on time okay thank you okay stephanie sent me a text on this text thank you for your patience and hopefully she's getting that god space i just i wanna let everybody know you know stephanie's been uh coming to church it's been wonderful and uh i offered her a position now this is a position to help me editing my videos so over the years i've said anybody want to edit the videos and it's okay nobody did wanted to it's a it's a very arduous task it's not very fun it is no fun really though but she kind of stepped up and i brought the kids here yesterday and for an hour i kind of tutored her on how to edit videos and so she edited my full video uh the next video is going to be called snakes once had legs because the university of georgia proved it in 2015 seven years ago so i just wanted to update the saints on that you know around the world those that listen in and um so she edited that for me so i'm very thankful and it took her two hours too i thought boy that's great i said that saved me two hours of my life so i said thank you stephanie so hopefully in the lord really going forward she can kind of fill that void and um help help me out i really hope and then i can just study more you know i can just study more yeah pray more rather than having to edit those videos i think that'd be so i just want to let you know she's doing a great job there and uh you know she always says great things hopefully she's live streaming now but she always says great things about coming to the house of god amen and ministering and learning uh so much in fact brother was it was it monday night yeah it was july 4th night we were out there talking and brother amen's parking lot who was parking that and she's like yeah all of a sudden when my friend died she said just the holy ghost came upon me she said i was i was weeping but yet weeping tears for joyce and i've got to get to the house and austin's like mom that's the holy ghost yeah that's right that's the holy ghost and so she's starting to feel that anointing praise god so may the lord continue as our prayers praise god it's you and a good fruit praise god you these last few months so very thankful for that by the grace of god so i'd like to uh you know just re rehearse just real briefly i'll try to set a timer here and hopefully i'll rehearse for you know just five minutes or so uh of course we get this idea about doctrines of devils from uh first timothy 4 11 up now the word doctrine scares a lot of message churches but that's because they haven't gone deep enough in the word of god right if you study the word doctrine the bible says christians should have sound doctrine it's it uh having right doctrine is a sign that the church is baptized with the holy ghost it's an absolute sign that's according to saint john it's verses eight nine and ten all right sorry second john rather second john verses 8 9 and 10. the bible says uh if you have the true doctrine then the bible says you have both father and son that's right hallelujah and so but doctrine has become an evil word and that's because we've had false teachers rise up over the years i'm just going to go ahead and name some joseph coleman lee vale we've had jeff jenkins you know we got a different one he's alive still but some of these other ones have gone past away now we've had so many false teachers rise up that uh many message people don't want nothing to do with teaching well they're missing out on a great revelation of the holy spirit because you have to have both and they say what they're saying now doctrine doesn't matter if you met jesus he wouldn't give you doctrine well that's wrong if you met jesus and he told you to do something that's doctrine that's right because doctrine is instruction and so this has become a dirty word but not in the house of god not the not where the saints really love the word of god amen it's still it's still a good word by god's grace but paul predicted this in the latter times some would depart from the faith giving he to seducing spirits so an evil spirit will be sly and crafty and will bring a doctrine but it'll be off the word jesus called it nicolaitans at the beginning that's right the doctrine of the nicolaitans and i went and researched that lord willing if i ever get through with the mystery of the godhead series if i ever get back to that then i still got one more mystery to preach and that's the seven candlesticks and the seven stars that's the only one i haven't preached yet out of that book and uh but i was doing the research and brother will you may know this but when polycarp first went back to the church of rome there was now three churches of rome and the first two churches he had he had miracles they had holy ghost revivals in the second church of rome and the third church of rome the dead were raised but when he went back to the first church of rome he walked in there and the first thing they saw was a statue of peter and then he sat down to watch the service and they had transubstantiation they were praying to peter they were worshiping peter so it was just it was just a few short maybe uh 50 to 50 to 75 years the first church of rome that started out right had already introduced all these nicolaitan doctrines and the laity had already uh become less than the preachers in other words now only the preachers had power only the preachers had give that's how it is in the catholic church today the the the priest is holy father holy father holy father and like he's so holy but he's not holy he's just a man like everybody else that's right but that's what pilocart found and he said the first thing they did was idolatry peter statue transubstantiation and then he said the next thing that they started partaking of the pagan festivals so for the church that'd be like partaking of easter egg hunts right now i'm saying i'll say this carefully worshiping christmas trees but if you put up a christmas tree don't worship it you're you're still saved right because brother branham did right if you condemn that then you've got to condemn brother bradley okay now i know that's offends some people but you got to balance it out that's right now i really don't care who i offend anymore i just want to please jesus he's the only one i don't want to offend amen it's the holy spirit praise god i just learned you have to be rejected so much you don't really care who you offend because the word of god is going to fall on good ground amen but they're also partaking of you know halloween type of ceremonies like that and valentine's day which was really wicked in those days they would put you know keys into baskets keys to their homes and different men and women would take different keys from each of them and they would trade partners for the weekend and it was just really really wicked and those kind of things started slowly coming into the church and now now look where the church of rome is today look look at that but polycarp found it like that worshipping the peter statues of peter now look they got statues i remember when we saw those statues at that catholic church everybody the whole vestibule was full of the statues they met thousand statues and they're encouraging get the statues get the statues but see it comes in really small it turns out you're gonna see where look at two more false doctrines that come in small they're related to the prophet of god but if the whole if the if the people don't search for discernment they'll be carried out they'll be seduced into idolatry that's right they'll be seduced into a sinful habitual lifestyle praise god right and so i got this thought while this is brother jimin and and just i just you know want to say what a great wonderful weekend that was with brother jim wasn't it yeah now church if you notice he and i have been in contact he was preaching a lot about the clothes you wear because that's what he's seeing when he goes to different places he's seeing the younger sisters letting down on the clothing so i just want our sisters to know that he kept hitting on the skirts and you know so i asked him brother you know why are you hitting on that he said that's what he sees he sees sisters now instead of wearing sleeves they'll wear no sleeves remember i told you about that then you can see bra straps well sometimes that's a great temptation for men right and uh he said they're really tight skirts you know with some of the young sisters he said it's even getting to some of the mothers and the skirts he says he sees them coming up so that so that's why he preached on that that was a burden that he had which i appreciate but i appreciate our sisters dress and holy amen but we're so small usually we can kind of you know if it hasn't really happened but if it ever happened we could kind of nip it in the blood you know you know i could preach on it and hopefully they could see it by god's grace but so that's what he's seen now i'm seeing totally different things because i'm not seeing that i'm seeing the stuff online prideful preachers that's what i'm saying so i'm preaching on that praise god to keep us from being prideful because if we have pride there's only going to be trouble in the church [Music] because the bible says through pride only comes contention and we don't want to come to church not not excited to come to church because i got to see brother so and so all right now i got to see such i want everybody to be happy coming to church that you can't wait to get to church pride is only going to cause division in our church my man said he calls it don't never let an arrogant spirit come upon you he said it'll be a poisonous church it'll hurt your pastor it'll hurt everybody in the church praise god so always gotta have divine love for everybody praise god amen hallelujah thank god now i'm gonna go briefly go through these so brother william when i when you were here in the in the winter i was preaching on this i've identified at least eight and i'll get to the ninth one tonight that's right some of these paul himself taught so paul taught when preachers say you must be celibate that's a doctrine of a devil that's of course that's roman catholic church but now it's like it's kind of morphed into well you can marry whoever you want or you can marry two three times so it's kind of morphed into that right anything the catholic church allows we know would be wrong okay uh then that paul also said uh you know they can't eat meat so it's a mandatory vegetarian so it's mandatory well now it's like well you can eat anything you can eat all food but food quickly becomes an idol and gluttony is still sinful gluttony is still sinful to feed the flesh more than you feed the spirit is an awful sin it's awful paul also said they were saying the rapture is passed already and there's some message people not a lot but some say we're in the millennium already this is the money i'm gonna buy i really would uh you know rather live than later to see you because the military is supposed to be peaceful and holy and there's supposed to be a mountain of holiness you know and lion can lay down with the lamb but my cat's still catching mice and the millennium the cat will lay down with the mouse i got some questions if we're in the millennium or not but you know uh it's false doctrine it's a devil saying that it's not jesus it's a devil saying these things and then you know i bet now this is different you don't find this in the bible so much but you do find it where paul says preachers about preachers will preach about jesus but the real god they have is their belly that's what paul said in philippians 3 19. and then i've heard different message preachers say oh you don't need to fast anymore because the lord's already here because jesus said well once the lord leaves then you got to fast well they said the cloud came now you don't have the fast that's a bunch of nonsense the cloud represented that the mighty angel had come down and he was bringing the revelation of the seven seals amen that don't mean jesus corporal bodies here that's what jesus meant my corporal body is gonna leave and when my corporate body leaves then you're gonna fast so we don't see the corporate body here what do we see our corporal bodies praise god we see the holy spirit moving praise god but we don't see jesus corporal body so we must continue to fast praise god we must continue to starve our bodies that our spirits might excel praise god amen remember i had that brother i met this winner he said in six years he said i've been in the message six years brother william he said and i've never met any message believer who's as thin as you that's what he told me i said brother that's a shame i said that's because a lot of message people are addicted to food and i said their god is their belly and i told the brother i said there they don't even have this they don't have enough anointing now most of them if they're not born again it's because they don't even this is control over your body yeah so how far are these message people really getting along the road they're not getting very far right so think about that what kind of church would allow them to get just that far and then stop what kind of sermons would they be hearing see you know so we got to be thankful if god's moved us past that we ought to be thankful god's brought us further out the road praise god amen i believe this i believe the the holy ghost joshua has not only brought us out of egypt and up that road of stature of every man of sanctification but he's placed us in the promised land he's filled us with the holy ghost and now we're driving out the inhabitants of the land now we're possessing the land the inheritance god had for us we're possessing the right relationships praise god but the gifts in our lives praise god all those five things i listen to i can't think of them now but god is helping us fulfill the will of god for our lives jude said they turned grace into lawlessness which is like the once saved always saved lie doctrine of the devil everyone will go to heaven doctrine of the devil now church the thing remember i'm going to just say this real carefully what's really close to this is that is that quote brother ram said where the angel said whoever loved you and whatever you love will be there everybody with me now god requests i think you're with me i said it's close that the what i'm saying is we can't interpret that that quote any way we want and the proof of that is when the bible said jesus looked at the rich young ruler and he loved him loved him and was brother tell us later that rich young ruler is the man who had the big barns and jesus or god said thou fool this night this day your soul is going to be required of you so did he go to heaven or hell he went to hell so if jesus's own love if that that's the right interpretation if jesus own love can't force people to be saved then how can yours force people to be saved and the church said right amen see how some of these false doctrines like to slip in real subtly oh everybody i love is going to be there well if that was the case church i love everybody on the earth i want muslims to be saved i want everybody to be saved hindus i want everybody to be safe as long as i can love them does that mean all over here to be safe when jesus said few that be that find the narrow road see how these subtle doctrines of devil slipping [Music] well hallelujah and then that the false doctrine this slips in the message too it started in the charismatic movement but god always wants you healthy and wealthy that's not true god does not always want you healthy and wealthy that's right in fact very few will be wealthy amen we're the wealthiest as far as america we're the wealthiest country right but most countries don't reach our wealth but can they still have spiritual riches you better believe it i've seen them pray like i wish i could pray praise god i've seen them worship like like i wish i could worship like that yet they don't have as much naturally as we have but it's okay there's different there's different experiences in every nation but it's all the same holy ghost praise god amen amen number seven i'm gonna do more on number seven later but preachers are presuming and exalting brother branham and his followers as the greatest of all time now brother man could be the greatest preacher of all time outside of christ but it's wrong to presume that if the bible doesn't say that then you're just presuming right you're venturing without authority you have no authority yeah acting like you got authority and jesus even jesus didn't say who would sit on the right hand or left so now you're exalting yourself like you know more than jesus that's right or you're so one with jesus that now you're basically speaking not saying the lord well if you're speaking so close to jesus why don't you give me thus saith the lord and so i know because i need to know when god's speaking and when you're speaking so i hear some other lies coming out of your mouth praise god like uh all every word on the tape is thus saying the lord said no that's a lie amen so you need to start saying god says the lord if you're so close to jesus and you know more than he did in the bible which they don't this is the one i ended on the last time this was part six some of them say rapturing faith is literally on the tapes it can't be that rapturing faith is anointing from heaven it's rain and doesn't rain off the tapes it rains from the seventh dimension praise god hallelujah right and it's proved because in the old testament they didn't have tapes but yet enoch still got raptured elijah still got raptured amen amen and that was before the blood of jesus christ amen so it proves the rapture has always and always will be an anointing that god sends down from heaven and that's the anointing we want to receive amen that's why we keep coming back to church that's why we keep praying and reading our bibles and believing because we know one day whether we live to see or not god is going to send that rain and i pray lord let it rain on me praise god if i don't live to see it that i know i'll be the first to receive it because the dead in christ will rise first amen amen i am praise god amen amen amen can you imagine that church and we're up in heaven let's say we die we don't get to live to see the rapture at some point jesus will come down to that sixth dimension and he'll say my children my sons and daughters it is time to go get your corporal bodies and we'll have we'll be on our theophanies and we'll say glory to god it's been a while i feel like eating it's been a while since i've been wow right because i haven't i'm in the avenue i'm going to spiritual body i have an eating and the lord come out and say or maybe an angel will come up maybe gabriel will come out maybe maybe michael will come out and say saints beloved beloved of the lord bride members it's time to go down the earth and get your corporal body oh my and then the bible said the dead in christ will rise first amen right so as we as we descend i don't know how it's going to happen but somehow the body is either going to come up to us or we'll go down to the body glory we'll cross dimensions we'll quote like brother said we'll cross the milky white wave praise god we'll cross that universe so fast and we'll go pick up that body and then we'll have all three bodies because we'll be the dead in christ rising first we're the first ones to experience this wonderful translation and then we'll see the living and they'll be translated we'll meet all jesus in the air praise god rapturing faith is not on a tape the tapes point to rapturing faith glory but rapturing faith is in the bosom of the father amen his anointing is his heart praise god he wants to pour it out to us and he will praise god amen either live to see it here or lift his seat over there amen either way i can't die praise god god is not the god of the dead god is the god of living amen this body may die but the soul will never die now i just briefly preached on these these are the battles we face right god knew the battle we faced the doctrines of devils at these times and season if you lived in jesus birthday when he was born you would have had to deal with herod slaughter of children if you lived in john wesley's day you've been kicked out of churches you'd have to have services outside in the field now this time of year we'd all like to have church outside i see some of you coming in the wintertime in the snow some of us leave when there's snow which i don't blame you buddy i wish we could i wish i could take my family with you i wish i could do remote teaching over there now they'll teach my class over here there you go we see you that's the battle they had to deal with in those days right in 1963 imagine you knew the seals were open and now the prophets got a greater revelational word and you'd want to go see him and you couldn't drive around the country because you had a job imagine the pressure you couldn't afford a phone hookup that was really expensive in those days yeah extremely expensive imagine the pressure i don't want to miss it i don't want to miss the rapture brother random said the other that we just two out of jeffersonville two out of new york you know remember that quote two out of uh pittsburgh or whatever you know two out of florida it's just a different battle imagine living in 1976 and battling those uh that deified the prediction of 1977. right well i got one year i got eight months i got seven months ago six months ago i gotta get everything right then the 1980s the seven thunders and all these false doctrines the two souls movement perugia movement of the 90s i'm just going to skip and then when we come in here i stand became an issue that divided people we had to live through that believe the sign in 2012 and now we're living in this time we're living through the tape church movement and it impacts the five-fold movement right because the preachers are now saying the rapture is hours away and they're saying brother branham cannot be corrected preachers are saying that where are they getting that they're getting that from jeffersonville right we just have to live through this we just have to persevere through this let me say like this we should uh we should excel through this praise god in other words let's not get weaker let's get stronger praise god how do you get stronger feed on the word eat some meat praise god the church said amen eat some meat get with the meaty things of god the discernment of the holy spirit discerning good and evil praise god that's right now uh the the issue here now i think i'm gonna skip past that yeah i'm gonna go to the ninth one now here's the ninth one i wanna add so this will all be fresh hopefully to you many people are making a tradition out of brother branham's life it's another false doctrine in other words if brother branham did it i can do it right right now the the trouble with this is uh because there's a seducing spirit behind it the people will actually misinterpret what the prophet did okay and they'll twist what the prophet did in order they could enjoy the lust of the flesh and in this case the example that i've been which brother jim was kind of preaching on that kind of led me this thought was well brother random watched movies now i can only find at least two that he watched and so that means we can watch movies too now there are there are good movies you can still watch today but there's cussing you better not watch it that's right right you better be fair i should say like that you better be very careful what you watch because it will take a stronghold in the kids lives or your lives and you'll find yourself more pulled to movies than the reality of the word of god praise god now like i was telling austin now for me i wasted probably half of my life before i come to the message watching movies and sports what a waste so most time when the kids watch a jesus movie i'll just excuse myself like i just can't i'd rather go study i just but it's okay they're watching jesus movies you know it's good it's good but for me i just can't do it i wasted so much time sitting on a couch or you know sitting in a movie theater i just can't i just want to study i just want to be in the word i just want to accomplish something for the kingdom of god watching jesus movies not that bad right now let me describe this so uh someone on youtube sent me this this doctrine of man this doctrine of a devil so this it's a woman and her dad was a message preacher okay so her dad was listening to brother brandon my brother said he watched a marilyn monroe monroe movie i'm gonna show you the quote he did and so the the preacher said well brother branham can watch marilyn monroe movies why can't i watch movies so then he did he started watching movies and they started watching tv shows i remember gilligan's island do you ever allen brother did they put that in ghana thank god you're blessed man well gilligan's island it's a silly comedy but they have sexy dress women on there and so this message preacher would watch that and his daughter you know growing up would be like that white if she's and she the woman would always show her belly there and you'll kind of wear like a bikini top or something like that and he'd watch it and he was like dad we shouldn't be watching that and uh he's like well brother brandon watch this marilyn monroe movie i can watch it it doesn't it doesn't affect me and the daughter said yes it did affect him he had less prayer he had less the preaching became condemnation on all the women that's what hurt that's what his daughter said now she might be biased but and it caused her to leave the message because her dad when he would preach would put all the blame on women it's all he's fall it's all but church you and i know if anyone's if anyone if any of us would have been there we all would know the same thing right and really eve can type the church right which would be all of us amen right we would all fall short of the glory of god but he became heavy-handed on that and then less time preaching pray more time watching gilligan's island and dirty you know movies so what he do he made a tradition out of a quote but it's a misinterpreted quote he interpreted the quote to give him the lust that he desired there it is right from the scripture peter said give them the lust that they want great swelling words right oh we're in the messenger we've got the greatest revelation all these things we got the greatest prophet yeah i can still enjoy my lusts on the side there's something wrong with that that's right and the holy spirit will pick that up praise god point it out is wrong okay so this is number nine now now the verses here are pretty plain i love this jesus said do you think that i accused you to the father he told the pharisees there's one that accuses you even moses whom you trust for how do you believe moses you would have believed me or he wrote to me but if you believe not his writings how should you believe my words so the point is jesus was saying you you won't receive the present word and you say you're following the prophet but that you're actually misinterpreting the prophet's word they added their own interpretation to moses's law called the mishnah they had their own books to understand god's book that was a sin that's right and jesus said i'm not going to condemn you your prophet that you're trusting is going to condemn you amen amen the very prophet they say they believe and follow brother moses he's going to accuse them well the same would be today right to misinterpret and add to brother message would be to have brother branham condemn because jesus christ is the same yesterday didn't jesus go down to hell and preach the noah's generation you should have listened to noah you should have listened to enoch you missed them they were preaching to me praise god i was that arcade man you missed it praise god missed it and no one will condemn them enoch will condemn them because it was christ in enoch christ and noah and the church said amen that's right and ultimately what we're going to look at these no matter what brother man watch we don't know all the details we can't assume things but ultimately the bible says i will set no wicked thing before mine eyes that's right that's right and the first thessalonians 5 i believe it is uh the bible said avoid all appearance of evil amen okay so here's the quote i'm sorry this is the quote about making a uh a tradition out of a prophet's life exactly what jesus said would come to the earth he said god sent them prophets down through the age every time their world system would fall apart their religious system said what you do with him god sent the prophet and you put him in a tomb exactly and then about another generation you wake up and realize that was the prophet and what would he do you garnish it to what you do make a tradition of his life that's exactly what israel had done had taken the prophet moses and made a tradition out of his life now church what they do they made a tradition out of the brass serpent church for a while they could look and live and they would actually get healed then but fast forward a few generations listen became a tradition well we'll just come to church and just hope god heals us and pretty soon they lost their faith and now it's just hope and now the wrath servant just becomes a thing they bow down in worship they worship the creation rather than the creator praise god they made a tradition out of moses's life that's why we can never let church become a tradition praise god there's got to be something real or speak to me tonight lord move tonight i need something from you tonight make this special tonight make every time we gather and hear the word and then we feel your presence through something special in our midst may we feel your holiness praise god let us not make a tradition out of brother adam's life i've done all i can do to try to stay from that praise god yeah i want to yeah i read his testimonies i got a book about his testimonies i highlight that i really love that beautiful but i can't make a tradition out of his life that's right now run around watch at least two movies the first was called a river runs through it that's a maryland maryland rogue movie and second was the ten commandments what's about moses now both movies are some immorally dressed women i remember when i first watched 10 commandments i was like oh i think it was a pharaoh's wife or something like that his daughter pharaoh's daughter okay yeah elizabeth something yeah i forget that movie stars what's that you change it in the movie they made her cleopatra oh that's right clearly that's right that's right i mean i was fresh in the message right the brothers at the church up there and uh said oh yeah you can watch movies and i was like i'm gonna watch movies i just left the movies you want me to watch movies like okay i'll sit down and watch tech commanders with you i was like i was like ashamed of myself like what's going on here i haven't watched it since everybody's got different battles you know and so you just don't want to put yourself in a bad spot praise god and let me say this i will not be watching river runs through it this thing knows brother brandon all right i love brother brown he's got servant he's got jesus star but he's a man because i'm going to show you why now here's the quote program said i was in canada the other day my kids kept telling me over now look at look who calls and watch a movie these kids were not born again there was a lady had led us to the house had a television and they said there's going to be a play called the river no return this was in 1963. the movie came out in 1954. so nine years after the movie came out now they're showing it on a tv special they're gonna have a tv special with marilyn monroe she'd already died at this point and they said dad there's gonna be a play called the river of no return that's the river i fish on all the time so the man was familiar with that movie and don smith a friend of mine takes that tour and they said they made a movie up and said daddy maybe that mr smith is on the program would you like to look at that well i said when i come back from canada if i make it in time i'll look at it well when the play did come i went over to see it went to see it and when i did who was playing it but marilyn monroe now there she was after being dead a year or more there she was all so did brother graham see her sexy dressed yes mother graham saw enough on the movie or maybe heard about it that she was sexy dressed there was her voice upon still playing and will be for years and years upon the magnetic tape if that magnetic tape holds her action when if she could look from where she is tonight i trust she say but i don't know that's to god but if she can look back she cannot deny that she cannot deny this because we've got it how much more has god got every move every action upon his great supreme tape we cannot get out of it it's right there now let me uh show you what the movie's uh posters look like here's the american version now that's marilyn rose she's got a real short shirt on side to cover it here she has basically like a bikini i'm not sure what you call it that's the american version now brace yourself for this one i covered it up but just price yourself you're going to use your imagination here's the japanese version when this movie went to japan and she's basically got a bikini on it and she wore that in the movies i don't we don't know what brother man saw but he said he knew she was sexy dressed in the movie okay now before i get to this one see that's a sin of making his life your tradition well brother branham watch it i can too you gotta ask we gotta ask ourselves a lot of questions how much in the movie did brother brandon watch did the holy ghost have him turn his head and show him the vision of the sexy dress before he saw it how many times did brother van watch that did he watch a river run through it every single day like that preacher was watching gilligan's island every day no no okay all right start to see here starting to see how a doctrine of a devil can form up based upon the seducing spirits of devils praise god so you come to my house you're not going to see me watching gilligan's island i say like this we got to be careful what we do watch on our phones it don't mean anything it doesn't mean anything anymore to say well i don't have a tv that doesn't mean nothing that's right because we all got cell phones it doesn't make any more it doesn't surprise anybody anymore it used to but doesn't anymore praise god so we have to say is i don't do movies i don't do disney i don't do hbo i don't do any of that i just watch jesus films or amen or something like that or the news when i get a chance you know or good stuff on youtube or good stuff on some of you might be on facebook you can do facebook as long as you're holy with it you know it's whatever you make of it right but to make that that quote to make that a tradition and invite seducing spirits into your home which that hurts the church that's a doctrine from hell praise god ever see that by god's grace so be careful just because you think you understand what brother graham did let's pray and actually actually seek god so we clearly understand what he did we don't know if he went back and repented of the holy spirit we don't know because remember he went back and repented after he disobeyed the brown bear vision he told us about that but we don't know every time he went back to repent for every sin that he did he said i commit thousands of sins a year that's at least five or six sins a day all right so we don't know we don't know if he went back repentance say oh god or children we don't understand children cover your eyes oh man guys we don't know but see how satan will take this quote and then oh i've always i've kind of held back on movies but i think i will watch the movies while the world is going to hell you're going to watch another movie no way no way hmm not a worldly one you see my brother jim was preaching on different things i thought i gotta read you one more sermon on doctrine the devil so that's number seven so it work it would work out if this is the last one descendants completion i usually don't end on the good side uh can everybody understand that by god's grace simple example but a real example where it ruined the church it ruined the family and allowed a sister to leave the message because of this doctrine of the devil and then she was bashing me she said how come you don't have any uh videos out there about pornography and bashing that i said well i preach on almost every service all you gotta do is listen to my service she never did and i said well fine then i'll make one so i made one last month praise god amen i've been wanting to do it for years but i just gotta wait for god's leadership of the holy spirit but i've had numerous people say this was such a blessing just when i was struggling with the timing was perfect you know so you thank god i said you just gotta listen to one of my sermons i always preach right you some of you can probably repeat after me right i'll preach against pride i'll preach against lust i'll preach against money right you you you know the things i'm going to preach all right because i'm a pastor yeah i've got to hit on all of those things depression disease you know all these temptations anger bitterness depression every cyrus i'm going to ball that out praise god because i know we battle those all the time praise god so let's not make a tradition out of brother iran's life let's make an exam let's use his life as examples that point us back to the bible amen because sister alina there's quotes but awesome there's quotes brother brandon said don't you ever let that television come into your church i'm sorry come in come in your church come into your house he said if it was in my house he said i'd blow it up with a shotgun you see what do you do here in this case he's like well i always fish at that i love that river it's beautiful i forget what state it's in probably wyoming or something i don't know so he kind of got pulled into that because of his his love for nature and then what so you can see how the devil works you you have a good oh i want to watch this it's probably a good thing and then say go slip in a sexy dress with man or woman on there just like the demo just like that one we don't know all the details about the situation so we cannot make it's what to me it's a good learning lesson be careful what you watch coming out of hollywood right praise god i don't care i think you ever talk to my brother be careful because that's just what satan wants right it's just like rat poison right it's going to have some good in it it's got to have some poison in it praise god recognize where it's coming from if it's coming from marilyn monroe praise god it was coming from beyonce or some of these modern sex queens i don't even know they're shakibra i don't know their names anymore you know jennifer lopez was one that was popular when i was out there britney spears those ones are popular if it has anything to do with that it's probably rat poison amen stay away from it praise god so does everybody agree that's a doctrine of a devil well brother branham did this so i know it's off the word but i can do it i can i can handle it too anytime somebody says they can handle a sin is probably a sin it's probably a tell if they're in a sin you can't handle sin the bible says you must have unleavened bread all right the bible says you must serve god in sincerity unleavened bread of sincerity and truth praise god you can't handle sin sin is going to overtake your life praise god you can't pet and baby a city you've got to get it out of your life right how do you believe that amen all right i did a 45 minute timer so i got six minutes left here so all right honey now you just waved that big white flag back there when i get to my 45 minutes okay so you know i have a reminder on my phone it says preach 35 to 45 minutes with someone to help you how many times do i do that i have a good desire lydia but the strength to do that desire i just can't find it sound like paul now let's do a little bit more on this because sometimes the holy spirit's here right you know like last week beautiful that was so awesome last week remember at the end this we were singing and such a beautiful anointing fell and then my daughters didn't battle that spirit all week oh yeah i'll tell you an update on that and then the girl got to come back and instead of talking about horror shows haven got to play her the song that the lord gave her and about the rapture the groom is coming he's coming to catch him it was so beautiful i'm like yeah working the last word amen i didn't hear you praise god this meant so much to me praise god amen no more talk about horror talk about the rapture amen amen so there's a great sin in presuming and exalting brother branham and this age above all christians what would it take somebody to say i'm the greatest christian there ever was what would it take somebody to say that let alone let alone this i'm the greatest mother there ever was what would it well the moment it takes somebody to say and today i'm you're the greatest grandfather there ever was what would it take for you to say that it would take a lot of pride even for me i'm the greatest father there ever was that's why i love you right there i'm the greatest preacher sister who there ever was yeah good one brother that's exactly right that's how we should act right but preachers are literally saying this what would have to come over somebody would that be the holy spirit they're still saying it i got video from last or two months ago by the way from the end of may i might show it to you guys tonight if i have time because really that's not me preaching so it doesn't count as my fourth house but think about that what would it take to come over you to say i'm the greatest speaker in tongues there ever was i'm the greatest miracle worker there ever was that's basically what they're saying and do they have any bible authority the answer is no because jesus christ said there it is not mine to give who sits on the right hand the left the greatest ones brother william would be the ones who are on the right hand and left is that you're right next to jesus now we don't like to be there but let's be honest we're not going to be there jesus already gave us a clue in the bible who's going to be there the 24 elders [Music] and then we know there's also a certain order too where the 12 apostles are going to rule over the 12 tribes of israel so now we know now there's even a better hierarchy he's probably got six apostles on this side six on that side and he's got the six israel on that side and six sons of israel on that side because they are going to judge the apostles are going to judge the tribes of israel judge this is right this is wrong that's right do this don't do that well how many people like to be told what to do how many people like that not many people have to be told to do right now i don't remember what secretary's 10 12 says so let me look it up here thank you thanks just be patient with me here 10 corinthians 10 12. i got that one memorized oh wherefore let him think of he standeth take he lest he fall okay so these these preachers are uh they're exalting themselves so high but the bible says you better watch yourself or else you're gonna fall now here where did this idea come from i'm going to give you my best guess i don't know i'm presuming on this but let me give you my best guess i believe it comes from revelation 10 1-7 because we have thus saith the lord revelations on the seven seals that were not revealed in any other age think about that do you think about that by the way paul never knew there was even seven seals because it was revealed to john about 100 a.d paul died in 64 80 if i'm not mistaken 40 you know i'm sorry 30 36 years earlier he never knew there were seven seals so preachers will say well we have more revelation so we must be greater because revelation is power revelation is faith we must have more faith okay well then like i said go walk on water first if you're gonna do greater works in jesus walk on water first then spit in mud put in somebody's eyes and then come show me their eyes and then tell them what color eyes are going to have before you put the mud okay start with that then i'll start believing how great you are right but i know there's nobody in these great jesus so i don't have to read them at all no question for me so see church now our revelation i will admit this our revelation is greater in the quantity but not the quality for the holy ghost revelation given to paul caused him to labor more than all the other apostles praise god his missionary work in miracles they've been rarely matched by anyone his dedication his sacrifice his devotion to jesus has rarely yet ever ever been matched i know message preachers have been put in jail but i know very few message preachers that were shipwrecked three times or beaten three times with 39 whips i don't know any message preacher that's done that there could be and if that's the case then they'd be highly exhausted amen but that's up to jesus but certainly not these ones that their heart of struggle in life is i don't know what struggle they have in life actually if they're millionaires i'm not sure what struggle they actually have in life where's my 45 minutes and remember paul's gospel is the judgment standard of all men including brother branagh and even brother branham can't even the angel that business brother can't add one word or take one word away from paul's gospel amen [Applause] so to me i feel like it was a small jump for those preachers to say well since we have the greatest amount of revelation we live higher than other ages because the gates of hell can't prevail against revelation so we must be greater than all the other ages sorry your reasoning is quite far you've jumped too many uh jumped too many rocks we can't find this in the bible it's certainly not all the tapes now they're making five declarations that are prideful now i'm gonna lord willingly record this video tomorrow or friday if i can get here to study by god's grace i'm making five prideful uh declarations here just bear with me i don't have to leave this screen but i might have to here okay the first one is of course they're the greatest preachers of all time i like to read the exact quote so you can see it here okay this is not updated so i have to go out of here when you need tech sometimes it fails okay here's the five uh yeah don't try to read that it might hurt you um yeah let me just thumbs up for a few minutes okay so the first thing is uh their profit this is their first prideful statement their profit brother branham preachers young people and mothers are all the greatest of all time i have i have the video but i showed it to the church i'll probably show it again maybe sunday i might preach one more on this uh joseph branham said that he said brother brahm is the greatest prophet of all time and he never said except for jesus he never said that so now brother branham is greater than jesus because he never said except for jesus and then he says we have the greatest prophet preaching to the greatest people of all time i got the i got the screenshots and then a message preacher and then well don't forget brother said don't you never do that there's no great ones among us there's only one great one and that's god a preacher from north carolina said i'm not ashamed to say this this message has produced the greatest preacher that's ever seen the pulpit and preached the word he didn't say outside of jesus either he said it's produced the greatest mothers come on church this message is jesus christ well now he's just made message preachers and moms equal to jesus christ we are not equal to jesus christ we are not equal no no we are not equal he never sinned we sin every day anyone with half a conscience would not say that we can't be equal to christ we are sinners saved by grace but i said remember i'm not jesus christ i'm your brother sinner saved by grace i like you all right hallelujah now let me say this if the mothers are greater than ever then they're greater than susannah wesley who brother ben really propped up high he said she prayed what two or three hours a day with all those kids and she may have but she did have a nurse she did have a midwife no she had a servant i looked it up one time she had cooks and housekeepers oh yeah that's what i mean i'm sorry yeah that's fine she had helpers at the house so which message mom prays more than three hours a day and has more children than susanna wesley somebody showed me then i'll leave you remember church in first corinthians 3 the bible says i am planted apollos water but god gave the increase so that neither is he that planteth anything so us preachers are nothing that's right neither he that water but god that giveth the increase now he that planteth and he that water are one right and every man shall receive his own reward we are laborers together with god we are god's husbandry we are god's building praise god amen so all preachers are one but all preachers cannot give an increase we cannot give you the holy spirit we cannot give you anything only jesus makes you groan praise god i can water you i can plant you i can do all those things but jesus is the life praise god jesus is the life jesus will make you grow jesus will bring forth great fruits in your life a preacher from virginia was talking about another preacher he said uh god you raised this boy up to be one of the greatest men to ever preach in the whole world american preacher now how can they correct brother branham because in the church age book brother william chapter 8 you know this one brother brown said the preaching of the word was never greater in the philadelphia church age oh okay so i thought we're supposed to say what the tape say i i thought you can't correct brother brandon preachers today are correcting the church age book that's what i'm saying brother branham said god raised up mighty wars of faith the greatest works of christian literature and teaching and preaching came from this era never has its preachers and teachers been matched and never will they be and the church that's said quote from brother branham and yet preachers they are correcting brother branham and they say they just say what the tapes say insanity praise god insane great swelling words ability oh we're the greatest greatest moms greatest young people i can't believe they said the greatest young people either i just can't believe that can't believe that how can they correct brother brandon they're the very ones i have videos of the same people by the way saying you can't correct the prophet and yet they're correcting the prophet now that's why i sometimes go crazy am i crazy or are they crazy who's crazy here because they're the ones god we get 18 views on a sunday morning service they get six hundred or a thousand sometimes two thousand so if you just look at the natural brother william they they are a hundred times greater than we are and so i think well am i insane because everybody agrees with them and they watch them and nobody watches ours nobody likes our sermons very few but you know what i got to do i got to talk to jesus and then i got to talk to the holy spirit which is the one the same and what does the holy spirit do but that says the holy ghost will always point you back to the word so let them call it let me let them call me crazy i'm happier this way praise god i'm happier not saying i'm greater than brother than any brother paul i'm happy saying i'm not greater than brother peter i'm nothing i just plant in water i'm nothing it's god he's the great one he's the one that gives your life increase hey man you see how you does everybody see how i could go crazy these are the preachers these ones everybody looks to great meetings great they have amazing miracles but they're saying we are the greatest christians of all time joseph branham had a person die in his congregation during the service and they prayed for him and he came back to life and he's the one saying brother graham is the greatest preacher prophet of all time everyone hear me does the bible say will have signs wonders in america don't the bible say that all right and i love that quote i just found that quote again i found it the first brotherhood said don't you never judge your life by how many signs and wonders and miracles he said judge your life presently by the fruit that you're producing said thank you jesus i sure needed that one sometimes i almost go crazy listen to my favorite preachers on there not so much my favorite anymore but another preacher from tennessee said the devils are coming against the greatest generation of young people the world has ever seen on the face of the earth and he said our credential is is we met the lord jesus ourself now look what he says young people message are greater than anyone because we've met jesus ourself well didn't james and john meet jesus face to face themselves church they were teenagers when they dropped their father's nets and they left their father's nets for jesus oh but we're greater than them i'm going to show you a visual in a moment here i'll have to get to a little bit didn't they see jesus face to face yeah they did see how there's no there's no scripture for this oh we've seen jesus we've met jesus face to face so we're the greatest young people of all time you haven't met him face to face praise god if you've got the baptism of the holy ghost but how can you be greater than the ones that he chose the 12. of course judas being replaced by matthias ultimately probably paul now some of these i'm going to just get past okay they and they also call each other generals brother william they say we're generals and they call their wives queens of the entire state like the queen of arkansas the queen of louisiana now that's taking a pastor's wife and just putting her up on a pedestal now how do they know she's greater than all these other sisters how do they know oh it's because it's my wife that's why she's great i got the videos brother okay so i'm gonna try to move on because some of this is this review for most of us here and then i'll read this one more so two months ago the brother said tomorrow morning you're gonna have one of the greatest preachers that ever lived in history preached to you now think about that you've got john wesley jonathan edwards martin luther polycarp iranian you you have the church age messengers yeah now remember this guy said that one of the grace in history but at his church he's the one that left that north carolina preacher say we have the greatest preachers ever and he stood there i got the video he stood there and said amen hallelujah they're greater they think they're greater than even the church age messengers that's what they say they said that ever the greatest ever to stand behind the pulpit ever history of the world you're not even in one of the seven you're not you're not in the 12 you're not the 24 you're not in the seven how can you be greater than 24 7 amen you can't be but that's what they allow and church the people clap and they get anointings they get miracles see the rain falls and the just and the angels but let the rain of humility fall on us too praise god i'm grateful when god does miracles i'm grateful for that but i'd rather have the spirit of truth praise god amen than compromise on god's word right if you actually listen to what they say so fast move on machine gun preachers but if you actually slow it down listen to it they're actually saying they're the greatest preachers ever and their wives are the queens i've heard two message preachers say i say right right right one's over the internet one one was right in the service the preacher from new york said we have the greatest musicians in the entire message and that's because he had four daughters in the in the band now it's easy to say that when you have four daughters in the band hey we got the greatest musicians in the message right here got me on the back great job dad yeah we're the greatest ever and two months ago at that same meeting where they were exalting themselves the preacher the pastor of the canada church said we have the greatest musicians in the message what is it about why does everybody got to feel like they're the greatest right why can't anybody ever say we're the humblest [Music] you ever hear them say that you know why because it's the spirit of satan he wants to be exalted as the greatest you believe this christians who are they are bought by the blood of jesus christ arguing a goat debate about who's the greatest who's the greatest of all time who's to go among us there's no great ones among us i just will you just read the scripture don't you never do that okay hook me back up here i'm going to try to bring this down to close here let's see i tried to do 45 minutes impossible i couldn't do it i couldn't do it tonight that's okay i don't gotta work tomorrow so he's gone i don't want to be sensitive to those that you have to work tonight i'm just happy i don't have one summer break okay i'm not making myself great i'm just bad i don't have to work tomorrow now brother william this thought came to me like it felt like it dropped down from heaven today brother ram said jesus never commended our church age did you know that get your bible out revelation chapter two get your bible let's see it i'm gonna prove it to you roman said it here's the quote why are you turning revelation 2 program is preaching the laosean church age now the next verse would be that other churches commending but he didn't commend this lamacian church jesus did not compliment this church oh my goodness and that's all they want to do is compliment each other he had a complaint against it not a command he didn't commend this for nothing this later seeing age with all the light there is right there by the way there is all the light that they have we have more light we have more revelation the little folks been open all seven seals have been loose praise god with all the light they had they went back on it they didn't need any commending aha they needed a rebuke and they got it he had a complaint for his church not a command remember jesus talking to both the true vine and the false mind when he's talking to church ages he's trying to get the false fine to repent but if there's good when there's good in the church age he'll say it but the reason you don't say to our age is because there's so few remember evil seducers waxed worse and worse false teaching is going to get worse and worse you got a migraine brother okay yes after church let's get some food unless you feel some powerful anointing okay god sees your sacrifice brother i appreciate your sacrifice he's talking to both fans but there's so few believers in this day that are actually hot and on fire that jesus doesn't even take time to to commend them because it's so small it's so small which is true because if the biggest preachers are exalting themselves with pride they're the ones who influence the most of the message of believers and everybody's going along with that we're the greatest and you're the no you're the good no you're the no no you are the great your wife's the greatest you're two are the greatest of all time all the time in history they said ever so jesus says there's so few saved they need to rebuke not commend they don't need a compliment like oh lydia i like your dress today okay that's a sharp looking match i like your color matching there no no compliments from jesus to this age none okay so yeah let's go revelation 2. how many do i got here i really want to finish this i thought i would really finish this tonight okay i got about 10 more slots okay well we don't have to do it we don't do this maybe i'll preach this on sunday but just so you know here's the verses jesus compliments ephesus smyrna pergamos dietrich sardis the the greatest compliments he gives is to philadelphia i mean he's just like boom and that makes sense that's why brother and said the greatest preachers came out of philadelphia it makes sense right yeah he's just like totally confident like yeah you come out of reformation and i got the open door uh you kept the faith and you have you have my name and my patience i mean he's just over and over complimenting the man age that's the west of the age and today's preachers say wesleyan age wasn't a good age because they only had sanctification no they had them back to the northern ghosts they were in type a type of segregation but they had the baptism holy ghost so if jesus did not compliment this age why are preachers complimenting themselves in this age is that a fair question all right let me i'm just going to close i'm going to skip ahead again the 12 apostles seem to be the greatest christians church here's how the greatest christians we know right now this is how they ended their lives now let's compare with some of the message preachers today saint andrew was crucified remember these are the ones jesus said you will sit right next he said you're gonna well the bible says in revelation four verse four they sit on twelve or twenty four thrones these are the ones jesus puts around the throne crucified andrew they beat bartholomew then they crucified him james son of alphaeus they stoned him to death like stephen james and son of zebedee they beheaded that's john's brother john's brother the one who left his father's nets the the sons of thunder they cut off his head john was the only one who was not brutally killed he just died of old age judas is scared was stoned to death the good judas was stoned to death matthew was speared to death remember i showed you the spears on sunday remember last wednesday the spirit they speared them to death peter crucified upside down he said i'm not worthy to be crucified like my lord not who's the great ones among us philip crucified simon crucified thomas speared to death now look matthias he was a great man of god i think he took the gospel to india if i'm not no that was uh thomas that was thomas i forgot what matthias did but fox the book of martyrs said matthias was stoned to death now along with saint paul these are the greatest christians according to the bible because jesus said you will judge all israel he said and you will sit next to me on the thrones in heaven now compare message preachers day some of them one the two the two i've heard of one made 250 000 a year in ties a quarter million a year and then the church would pay for all of his trips overseas i mean so he pocketed all that quarter million all those years i mean 40 50 years brand new clothes all the time new suits flying in planes brother i mean you have a couple times they put their lives on the line but is that the same type of sacrifice and dedication as these i don't think so and we have a bible to back it up that the bible says they have the thrones next to jesus think about that think about that who's the great ones among us now how did these the greatest christians ever how did they act when they received the holy ghost they bought more possessions and goods and kept it all to themselves no when they got the holy ghost they sold what they had to make sure everybody had what they needed hallelujah what else did they do when any of them lacked they sold houses lands and brought prices of things that were sold they laid them at the apostles feet and the apostles didn't keep them they distributed to the people that had amen that's how the real holy ghost acts and we've got thus state the bible for that when paul met james cephas and john yeah the ones who are going to be crucified upside down what's the last thing they said they said the only thing they would remember is that we would remember the poor poor so the greatest men the last words they would say before they would leave they said god bless you brother paul don't forget the poor that was that was the main thing on their mind who can we help how can we help the poor that's what the holy ghost does amen that's how the holy ghost makes you act then he's the same yesterday it'll make you act the same today it'll make you act the same forever praise god that's why that's why we pour our help to our saints that need it we pour out help to it i'm glad people poured out a lot of help to me too since i was a child they bought a church that poured out help helped to me and my family by god's kids and peter said silver and gold have i lots no silver and gold have i met he was talking about these he said billionaire preachers i said how different are you you're always bragging about what you got and how much you accumulated in this much time i said how different is from those original pentecost they sold everything they had to give to the poor i said you're opposite of that you're vice versa there's my notes let's stand our feet musicians can come
