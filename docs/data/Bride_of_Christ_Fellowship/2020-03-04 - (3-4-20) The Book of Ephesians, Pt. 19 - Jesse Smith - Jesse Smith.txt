sir appreciate that that was really special amen thank you brother ray kind of gave a personal word for the lord um to me for lydia to encourage her and then it was true and then uh uh the same thing applied to our little church here by god's grace so i really really appreciate that but thank you and i'm thankful you know my wife and i were talking about that i think god has kept us small to protect us and then we can really focus on the word of god and worshiping so but i really appreciate that there's a lot of deceiving going on in the message amongst preachers right right right pray for brother jewel courtney yeah uh they're they're at a building right now cleaning it up preparing it for church service sunday okay you know for the saints over there okay yes sir can i give a real quick testimony sure yeah yes sir i was going home friday and in the morning i was going to work in my car started sounding real bad real bad and i told my wife about three weeks ago you know and that something was going on with the car and there's many times that i went home since that time with the fear you know to get my car just gonna you know just right off the road on the highway and uh friday i said lord i want to go home you know he would them and he says it's going to be dangerous the car is bad and i i say okay lord but i still want to call he said it's real bad and i said okay lord but i want to go home with my family and be with them will you please make a way and he says pray to me i thought that was kind of strange you know he's talking to me pray to him you know i guess the like the bible says pray when jesus said pray for the harvest right yeah why pray you know what i'm saying right i pray and he says it's going to be dangerous i said lord don't let me kill anybody going home i said get me home and i said by faith i'm going to claim and while i was going up the ramp to get on i-77 here the car really sounded bad at one one time it went like this like the wind took it and there was no way and i was praying and you know what when i got to near here to this exit i said lord there's a little faithful church i said and i believe it's going to be all right just thinking about this right here and the work here i said it'll be all right you know after that when i got near fair long the car seemed like it went like automatic pilots amen car stopped making noise took me all the way home i called the mechanic he said bring it in he checked it he asked me what was wrong and when i called him up sunday because he said he was going to call me back saturday he said i'll be done in four hours that was at 10 o'clock in the morning you know i said i didn't get a call i called him saturday night he said i called you i said well my phone plays with me sometimes you know and maybe i didn't get the call he said well i him he said the car's done and he says not in vain because he don't understand about using the name of the lord like in uselessness but when he said it it wasn't that way it was the lord speaking to me it was jesus christ he said jesus christ he sent that car he said when i took off the wheels he said everything fell out bearings and everything i'm both tired just fell apart wow praise god but just going past you it's gonna be all right you know and just gave me an encouragement amen praise god like maybe like jerusalem the temple

here tonight like to go to ephesians chapter five we'd like to continue on this ephesians series tonight by the grace of the lord ephesians 5 verse 1. after that we'll do the memory verse as well yes it is thank you lord thank you lord ephesians 5 verse 1 we'll look to the lord here keep preaching on these inspired words we're resting on the same word that paul preached praise god so just like that thought i want to continue on that thought and i just want to stay in that channel of the word there praise god it's ephesians five verse let's do one and two lord willing i'd like to get down to about verse nine or ten here tonight lord willing ephesians five verse one i'll read verse one then we can all read verse two and then we'll go to uh revelation 3 20 for the memory verse i still need to text wendy about a memory verse for march so just keep forgetting about that so ephesians 5 verse 1 be therefore followers of god is dear children let's read verse 2 together 1 2 3 and walk in love as christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to god for a sweet smelling savor so let's go to revelation 3 20. i saw this one on facebook this morning the same verse i think i've seen it one more place i think we saw it one more so it's great to hear more and more confirmations of god's word just encouragement praise god revelation 3 20 on 3 1 2 3 behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me praise god let's have one more word of prayer let's ask the lord to minister here again one more time that's power heads heavenly father we love you lord just take this word break it to us lord father we can all read it lord i can read it we can all read it but lord just uh take the thought of it lord that you'd like to quicken to our hearts tonight i prepared and i kind of feel the direction i i think we should go the lord you can change it at any time and we just want to be led by your holy spirit encourage strength and know god and deeper understanding growing in grace and knowledge of you and lord a great appreciation and thanksgiving for all you've done lord as we've seen tonight you give and take away lord you've taken away a wonderful saint our sister mary lord god and the lord you give also lord god and we thank you for the eternal blessings no doubt she's enjoying right now so lord help us to set our affections on things above where our sister has been called home father help us to serve faithfully here now we pray in jesus christ's name and the church said amen god bless you being seated praise god so lord willing um i do have just a few so i don't have a whole lot um as far as new things to show but uh in case you want to switch over there would like to just show a few things just kind of keeps me organized so ephesians 5 verse 1. and so i i just i want to update you a little bit i got those emails returned about the jeffersonville video so um the side that was on jeffersonville side never emailed me back i spent lots of time writing them and they never even back that's okay um the side that was kind of with me but still believes joseph's a prophet which is okay they can believe that he's emailed me back numerous times he's actually from south america and i gave him all these quotes he was very thankful for helped him out a lot to understand how brother you have to separate bill graham's opinions from the word and i got a text from a brother in lima just saying uh he said my family and i have talked about the same things you put on the video for years and he said you hit that uh nail right on the head so it was encouraging to hear that just you know i know that family's testimony and and to see how god has saved each one of them and their family and god's done great things they're just encouraging so we're thankful and uh as i told the one brother i said i try not to call names on that video but the reason i did it was because there was those people influence millions uh and they're influencing them some things the wrong way so we have to be a voice to try to correct it at least let our voice be heard and and it's done with love and the family even one of the family members said it was done with love so i thank the lord for that so even even those that we're we're trying to help can admit we love them praise god what greater testimony could you have that your own people that are against you tell you that you they feel loved by you i don't know what other better testimony we could have that's what brother brown said if you if you can't love somebody you'll never help them if you're trying to correct them unless they can feel that you love them first so that was a great encouragement to me and i just want to be thankful and keep doing what the lord is leading us to do by god's grace uh so now we let's look to the word here now we're on our third theme the walk and the warfare the believer that's how schofield divides it up there we're on the walk in the warfare so we're seeing how to walk now in chapter four begins the walk four verse one and then it begins with the unity of the faith goes into the five full ministry and chapter four ended with that great illustration of i think i'll just put it back up there again that great illustration of paul saying he said we've got to put on the new man and he likens it under like putting on clothes he see we've got to take off the old man and he's talking to churches that have holy ghost-filled saints in them sure and how do you know because even brother brown lied a couple times you know so if he was filled with the holy ghost no doubt he was and he and paul's encouraging them not to lie then these are sins that we could uh possibly uh go through and experience uh and we but we got to learn to repent take off the old man get a transformed mind and put on the new man now i didn't make this a picture here but personally i don't believe you can fornicate and be born again so i didn't make this just so you know i don't believe you can fornicate and be filled with the holy ghost i don't believe you can commit adultery and be born again i don't believe you can get drunk and be born again okay that's just my opinion that that's i believe there's a scripture for that um because paul says fornicators will not inherit the kingdom of god well how can you be a fornicator and be born again into the kingdom of god that's the whole point of the kingdom of god is to get you into it born into it praise god so that's because these are later in the next chapter remember church these are not in chapter 4 right here these are in chapter 5 later on so i'm just putting that up there as a visual so he ends the the chapter 4 dealing with how christians can grieve the holy spirit praise god and we don't want to do that we don't want to grieve the holy spirit that means offend or to make sad or make sorrowful we don't want to make the holy spirit sorrowful right but we know if we do god is merciful he's quick to forgive us if we repent praise god now chapter 5 uh one and two we kind of looked at on sunday night we must imitate god uh we must follow god as dear children and then we walk in love in verse 2 as christ has loved us and has given us himself for an offering and a sweet smelling sacrifice to god for a uh i'm sorry sacrifice to god for a sweet smelling savor so that gives the illustration as we looked at paul in romans 12 to lay ourselves present your bodies as a living sacrifice unto god and we must put ourselves on the altar of god praise the lord every day we must do it we must get a transformed mind and do it daily praise god lay ourselves on god's altar if we want to imitate god if we want to be like christ the only way is to put on the mind of christ praise god now verse 3 i just like this thought i'm just going to just uh i'm going to just emphasize this thought just for a few moments here uh in verse 3. but fornication now see i believe these are some of the things that should never happen amongst us before an occasion which is uh sexual activity before marriage and all uncleanness and covetousness let it not be once named among you as become a saints remember paul speaking to ephesians who live in the second greatest city outside of rome at that time the most prosperous outside of rome uh has the most female gods or goddesses rather and gods and temples and sports and drunkenness and revelry he's talking to the most the second most popular place to be with filled with temptations and he said don't let your little group your little flock even have once named or somebody committing a sexual acts before marriage don't let it be once named among you praise god don't let uncleanness or covetousness be named amongst that real bride of christ church right as become a saints now the thought when i read this you know it kind of came to me uh we must be pure 100 of the time right satan's got access to our minds he'll make us stumble on our minds and we'll do things in our minds that aren't pleasing to god but at some point the holy spirit is given to us to keep us from doing these things this case fornication and all uncleanness and covetousness it shouldn't be named one time so all the people that know us and know about our church and our friends they should never hear about someone at bride of christ fellowship committing fornication or adultery right if we're living true to god and if we are uh if we are renewing our minds daily praise god then we should live above these sins i'm talking about the ones he named here fornication uncleanness covetousness he said and not let it not be once named among you and church this made me think of the scripture where paul said in second corinthians 7 he said let us labor he said to perfect holiness in the fear of god and it's a constant our lives should be a constant drawing closer to god we should be getting a more understanding of god we should be more faithful to god we should be coming more like god because we fear god so god is asking for perfection paul's saying god wants you to be perfect on these things don't let fornication be once named among you remember how paul didn't paul rebuke him in 1st corinthians 5 he said there's a man who's committing fornication with his stepmother he said and some of you he said none of you are even mourning about it he said because you're puffed up he said get that leaven out of the church amen he had to rebuke him so it was named amongst so fornication was named amongst the corinthians but paul tells these ephesians he said don't let it be once named among you and then that thought came to me saints from the church age book brother says when the church of jesus christ knows who she is she's an invincible army praise god when she gets a revelation of who she is she'll be an invincible army praise god now i believe that's future tense but i also believe that's present tense for every christian who's born again amen praise god i don't believe that's just for the saints who are alive at the rapture i believe any saint of god like paul he was invincible who's going to stop him from fulfilling god's will for his life amen who is going to stop peter from doing and for feeding jesus's lambs amen hallelujah who is going to stop john from getting the aleppatmos and receiving the the revelation of revelation writing it down and sending it off to the churches who could defend that who could stop that it was invincible praise god and so i believe that's what paul is saying the same idea that christians that are really born again really sold out these type of things should not be named once among them because the holy ghost is power that's the whole point of the holy spirit right was to give us inward power hallelujah jesus said when you receive the holy ghost he said you'll be endued with power from on high dunamis right dynamite amen strong power praise god to overcome satan's temptations amen so not named once that's what we must strive for that's the church's desire is to live so close to god that we don't even have it once named among us now how many churches you know that have sexual abuse named among them adulteries named among them we should strive to not have it named once among us praise god that should be our desire to take sin seriously and i believe this church i believe like brother brahm said i believe uh the days of ananias and sapphira can return not just right before the rapture but they can be here now where brother says we love god so much and we hate sin so much that we're praying every service lord don't let sinners come in here uh unless they're going to repent praise god because spirits follow people praise god right and so lord if a sinner does come in here may they get convicted and may they repent and may the spear those evil spirits be cast away from them praise god amen hallelujah and i believe god has protected us that way i've told you over the years church we've seen some people come and go and i've told you testimonies after some of them have left that god is keeping the church clean either from false doctrine or criticism or other things of other sins that have been in people's lives and god has been merciful to us he's not letting these things be named once among us praise god and that's what we should strive to do is live uh so pleasing to god that we could be invincible as far as god keeping us from major sins amen because we saw on sunday paul said sometimes in my mind i get taken into captivity in the in my mind and he says oh wretched man that i am in his mind but paul wasn't out there fornicating like samson right he wasn't out there getting prostitutes like samson or judah you know he wasn't out there doing that he but in his mind saints in his mind he struggled and he had mind battles and he he became a slave in his mind but he knew he said thank god through jesus christ our lord that i get the victory praise god and he's going to give me a new body amen hallelujah we should try to not have these things once named among us because fornication was rampant in ephesus right a lot of the if you go back and study like even holidays like valentine's day because we watch the videos at our school we're allowed to watch these videos valentine's day you know what they did in rome on valentine's day men and women would just come and all their names of being a little a bull and they would just pull names my children in first grade watch it they pull names and they spend the weekend of valentine with that woman or man just random to see if it would be that's from rome that's and and so that's what paul this is kind of the culture around them where love is uh love is sinful you know their love is sinful it's all lust and paul's saying don't let that be among us we're saints keep your body holy and pure imitate god amen follow god as dear children he said go to perfection perfect holiness in the fear of god i like knowing the context of these letters don't you i love to see the context because it makes it more real like these things are eternal letters they apply to our generation just like they did to that day not named once he says don't let it be named once so keep away from these sins 100 of the time amen now let me i forgot to read this the greek word for uncleanness is impurity physical or moral uncleanness and then covetousness is greediness he said don't let it be named once among you as becometh saints praise god so what are we striving after we are striving after a church that keeps its body and mind under subjection and the there's only sins that are visible like this there's no visible sins we keep all of our sins maybe up here praise god i know it's hard right but we want to live where uh most of our sins are only done up here and they're not actually acted out amen like fornication uncleanness greediness right all these things he listed and that's why we can come to church we can raise our hands and sing and cry i can cry tears of joy because god's mercy his mercy is more amen hallelujah i can praise the lord because church we live we should live such a pure life publicly and if that's the case if we're living such a pure life publicly then our biggest battles will be in our mind and that's where we see ourselves fail sometimes can anybody relate to me about that our biggest failures should actually be in our minds and not so much outwardly right like these type of sins i believe that now look at verse 4. i like this verse this is good now i name some other sins neither let filthiness which is obscenities i'll tell you a lot sometimes christians get really close close to cussing don't they brother ray what i wonder i forgot about i want to put up a slide here with with words that are close to cuss words to kind of educate not educate but revelate the people of god so some words are just really close and we shouldn't say them right right i don't want to say them maybe i'll list them for sunday i'd like to maybe go back over that we shouldn't even get close to saying obscenities or cuss words irreverent words now foolish talking this is one we got to be careful too god help me sometimes i'm this foolish talking means silliness or buffoonery so paul says nor foolish talking nor jesting jesting means a vulgar wittiness now that's people that are kind of witty and smart alec we might call them so christians should not be smart alex right right being vulgar and saying evil things and condemning people hurting people he said which are not convenient so that they don't build up right we saw in chapter four our words are supposed to edify people our words are supposed to build people up if we correct them the bible says correct your brother in meekness like the bible said in galatians chapter 6 if you see your brother overtaken in a fault the bible says go in meekness unto that man and he said consider yourself lest ye be tempted pardon me so that's how we do it praise the lord we have to correct people but we do it with the spirit of meekness like i said earlier now like this it's not convenient to be obscene to be silliness and buffoonery and vulgar wittiness to be a smart aleck but what we should do with our words but rather the giving of thanks amen we should always give thanks we do i'll say like this we we probably do too much joking we probably do too much silliness we probably uh do too much uh wrath right we we need to be giving thanks more often paul said this is the will of god in christ jesus praise god but rather giving of thanks see we should rather it i rather i'd rather give thanks than say evil things right i'd rather do that right that's what we should do praise god always give thanks the this is what a follower of christ does give thanks praise god with the mind of christ now like verse 5 2 verse 5 this is what i mentioned earlier this is why i believe god is giving us kingdom boundaries there has to be a separation between the wise and the foolish there has to be why would jesus tell the parable you know i remember when i was starting to believe the sign they don't really believe in a foolish version well jesus said so jesus said there's going to be some that are pure physically right or pure spiritually but just don't have oil there has to be a boundary a separation between people that are fully sold out and others that are not quite all the way sold out and so paul i love this paul gives us kingdom boundaries amen hallelujah verse five for this ye know now look at he said you know this no whoremonger now that means uh sexually whoremonger there unclean person is which means impure or lewd covetous man which means eager for gain or idolater which is an idol worshiper have any inheritance he says in the kingdom of christ and his god amen in verse 5. that's right so paul says you know this in other words i've taught the church this if you are a whoremonger if you are not living right if you're unclean if you worship false gods if you're greedy you have no inheritance in the kingdom of god amen praise god so it gives us great boundaries praise the lord thank the lord amen hallelujah now since we're there let me go back here now keep your place there i just had this thought come go to first corinthians 6. because a few years ago i preached a message you might remember i think i preached 23 sins that prove people aren't born again i don't know if you remember that message but i just counted all these times where the bible said if you do these things you don't have any inheritance in the kingdom of god so that was clear boundaries that someone who lives in these sins without repenting is not born again because they're not in the kingdom of god jesus said unless you're born again you can't even understand the kingdom amen that's right first corinthians 6 9 know ye not that the unrighteous should not inherit the kingdom of god here it is the same idea these are people that do these are not going to be kings and priests in the kingdom of god be not deceived neither fornicators idolaters adulterers nor effeminate effeminate is that's the man who molested a child that's a child molester or a man that kept a child to molest physically sinfully nor abusers of himself with mankind that's homosexuality nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of god amen so see paul gives clear boundaries there's boundaries if you're in the kingdom you won't go past the boundaries into these sins why because you've got power in you inside of you amen you've got the spirit of christ in you praise the lord verse 11 and such worst of you amen were but you are washed you are sanctified you're justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god amen hallelujah there is hope for the homosexual today praise god there is hope for the adulterer today but it comes by being washed by the blood of christ i tell you this testimony a few months ago brother dennis or dennis mcbride from south carolina he's a message preacher he started a church and they went for about i think 10 years well anyways and then he stopped he felt let lord stop but during the time he was pastoring he said god gave him a great vindication because before he pastored there was a sister in the church and she backs it out of his previous church and went into a homosexual lifestyle lesbian lifestyle he said but her testimony was once she heard that he became a pastor down in south carolina she got encouraged really excited she went to his church and through a couple of years of preaching she got delivered from that lesbian spirit came back to god and now she's back walking in the truth what happened she got washed she got justified she got sanctified by the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god god's in the business of washing but we got to come to the pool to be washed amen that's a that's not a that's not an 1800 testimony that's a 2018 or 19 testimony praise god homosexuals can be washed perverts we'd say you know uh could be washed abusers could be washed but they've got to come to the fountain filled with blood amen the guy let the holy spirit wash them any man that would abuse a child or any woman anyone that would do that is not born again praise god that's what paul says right there you got to get washed from this he said fornicators mongers have no inheritance in the kingdom of god they won't rule over anything god can't trust him with anything because he can't even trust them with their own bodies amen if god can't trust you with your own body how's he going to trust have you uh lead over other bodies like the bible said ten cities he said if you're faithful with five tails i'll make you a ruler over ten cities how are you gonna handle 10 cities bodies in 10 cities when you can't even handle your body amen is that right praise the lord it's kingdom boundaries and paul said you know this already no whoremonger has any inheritance in the kingdom of god that's right now the same thing is said over in galatians 5. so let's go there it's right in front of ephesians kingdom boundaries ephesians i'm sorry galatians 5. now in verse 16 he said this i say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh put on that new coat right put on that new garment and you won't walk in the flesh amen that's right for the flesh left this against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you would praise god but if you be led of the spirit you're not under the law now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasheviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions heresies now see you got to watch people people can live pure physically but if they teach heresies they're just as lost right they're just as they're just as absent of the holy spirit as someone that's committing adultery because the heresies like spiritual adultery right see just one of these can keep somebody from being born again and that's the trouble a lot of people a lot of people today want to be born again but did they ever go through this and actually say lord am i doing any of these lord if i am wash me of these because if i do these i cannot be a part of the kingdom of god but i want to be a part of god's kingdom it's the only kingdom that will last amen all the kingdoms will be shaken and destroyed and teared down but there's one kingdom that cannot be shaken amen and his ruler is a ruler the ruler rules with a rod of iron amen hallelujah glory let's go to verse 21 endings murders drunkenness revelings and such like of the which i tell you before as i've also told you in times past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god praise god see these are kingdom boundaries people you cannot do these and be born again because jesus said when you got the holy ghost now you see the kingdom of god now you're a part of the kingdom of god because he said the kingdom of god is within you amen that's right praise the lord thank the lord now i got one more on my mind let's just review this one real quick go to revelation 21 it just kind of came to me real quick again now could those people be saved yes the thief on the cross he was up there he was saved but he was a murderer right that's why he was condemned but yet he was saved because he repented so all those people that commit these acts can be saved but they got to repent but if they don't then scripture says what happens to them all right now revelation 21. now i'm just going on my memory here yeah verse 27 21-27 and there shall no eyes enter into it anything that defileth neither worketh abomination or maketh the lie but they which are written in the lamb's book of life praise god now actually yeah i'll also go to verse 8 21 verse 8 that's the one i was thinking too 21 verse 8 my see the reason god's going to keep him out is because he's offering power to overcome these destructive sins he's offering all the power that he has his word amen the people turn down that power and love the powers of darkness he has no choice but to keep them out of the kingdom but you and i we're invited into the kingdom praise god we have access to the power and we got to act on the power receive the power and act upon it praise god amen glory revelation 21 8 but the fearful the unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death that's quite a scripture so we have to add so we see the same idea whoremongers idolaters anyone that doesn't repent of these things in this case if they don't repent they'll have they won't even be close to the kingdom they'll be annihilated in the lake of fire right kingdom boundaries that's verse 5. now go back to ephesians 5 verse 6 and 7 here i want you to notice here the words we say are so important the words i'm preaching tonight are so important either their words of power or their vain words somebody better let me know if i'm saying vain words tonight because i don't think i am i think they're true words look at the destruction of vain words look at verse 6 ephesians 5 verse 6 let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things cometh the what the wrath of god upon the children of disobedience so vain words will teach you to disobey god's word but powerful words will teach you to obey god's word amen amen hallelujah so vain words will be like it's okay to continue living in adultery it's okay to allow homosexuals in to be pastors and preachers and deacons you see it's vain because it's teaching disobedience church this is why there'll be no excuses on the day of judgment because all these churches in america all these churches around the world they have the word right here and they just ignore they just read the parts as a like a buffet they just pick out the things they want but god's given us a full course meal praise god it's not a buffet we don't just pick and choose we're taking everything praise god just a little we take it all our plate's real big we're feasting on the things of god amen there'll be no excuses because the bible says right here if you live in these sins you're lacking the power of the kingdom you're not a part of the kingdom and because of vain words comes the wrath of god those who disobey god's word hallelujah to me it just gets more plain every time we read the bible this foolish wise and foolish and the the make-believer the unbeliever it gets more clear all the time and it's helping us to decide which side we want to be on amen that's right hallelujah so what's going to try to deceive us vain words he said words empty words are going to try to deceive us empty words that teach us not to really fear the lord anymore or respect the lord empty words are what deceive people many times in churches so you and i must decide are these words heavy do these words carry weight or are they empty meaningless words praise god verse 7 be not ye therefore partakers with them praise god god is good church praise god we know the sins and now we're taught not to let anything come out of our mouth except thanksgiving and we must stay away and not partake of any of these sins with these type of people praise god let's be careful what kind of words that we hear praise god what words we receive amen verse 8 walking in the light verse 8 hallelujah amen thank the lord stronger than darkness his mercies are new every morning praise god verse 8 for ye were sometimes darkness but now are ye light in the lord walk as children of light amen hallelujah that was our testimony we used to walk like children of darkness we can all relate and say yes i lived in that darkness i i i wasn't shining light but every christian should be able to say my life has had a resurrection right the star right god stark is the day star has risen in my heart amen hallelujah i was walking in darkness living like the world but now the day star jesus christ his life his light has risen in my heart and now i'm walking in the light today that's right sometimes you're in darkness now you are the light amen hallelujah you are the light of the world praise god so see we don't have fornication uncleanness covetousness filthiness foolish talking jesting hormone coveting idolatry or empty words those are part of darkness but we are walking in the light amen how do you do it the bible said in first john 1 confess all your sins he's faithful and just to forgive you of all unrighteousness and then you're walking in the light as he is in the light hallelujah thank the lord blessed be his name now here's the kind of thought i just want to kind of this is where i thought i'd build to would be the fruit of the spirit here i want to just maybe go a little bit further with the fruit of the spirit verse 9 now he says in verse 8 you are the light walk as children of the light for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth okay he says your walk in the light you don't have any partakers of darkness you don't partake with the people of darkness and the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth so to me church paul is making it plain we cannot do those sins above and have the fruit of the spirit for the fruit of the spirit or the spirit only produces fruit through the goodness of god the righteousness of god and the truth of god amen those sins listen above have they cannot produce the fruit of the holy spirit amen hallelujah because it's unrighteousness but you and i are so called to walk in righteousness hallelujah thank the lord now i want to read something here brother braham says in the lamb's book of life 56 he said now the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering goodness gentleness patience meekness that's the fruit of the spirit and the fruit that's the mark of the holy spirit showing that divine love had as anchored in the heart and the things of the world is dead praise god so what's the mark of the holy spirit the fruit of the holy spirit amen that's the mark praise god how do you know you got the right seed because you got the fruit that the seed has produced amen hallelujah and now i've gone through this a few times but i want to just look at it again here tonight god hiding himself in simplicity but ram said jesus said many will say many will come to me and say lord have we not prophesied your name your name done many works and cast out devils he said depart i never knew you that's according matthew 7. see that isn't it that isn't it friends that's the reason the tongue's evidence i believe in speaking in tongues but i don't take it to be the only evidence of the holy spirit no sir the fruit of the spirit is the evidence so i want to go down these quotes again and this this thought one more time to show you and to preach it from the word that the fruit of the spirit is part of the evidence of being born again right it's part of the evidence in fact the evidence program tells us is that we are in the word all the way and fruits of the spirit are part of the word amen hallelujah that's right so whatever the word says for our day we must obey it and live it and when we do that proves we are born again hallelujah now in the same quote but said the fruit of the spirit jesus said by their fruits not by their gifts he said by their fruits you know them so that that is the fruit of the spirit it's god unfolding himself in humility sweetness and every day the same it's something about a man that stays right with the word every time that he sees the word he punctuates it with an amen no matter what the other people say see that humility sweetness every day the same is a sweet humble walk with the lord oh thank the lord amen i love this praise god is your life worth the gospel and if brother amen's listening i just want to say that but amen i've been talking about some sermons but amen if you like a good sermon listen to listen to is your life worth the gospel one of the first sermons i ever listened to uh beautiful beautiful message june 30th 63. but here's a quote from that message when this takes place the thing you'll do then you'll find out that the spirit that comes in you from the new birth you will believe and do everything that god says in his word is for you to do and everything that the bible quotes for you to do you'll punctuate it with an amen and you'll not stop day or night until you receive it that's right and in all this time you'll certainly above everything bear the fruits of the spirit everybody catch that he said certainly above everything you'll bear the fruits of the spirit hallelujah praise god above everything so above anything else you can do if you're truly born again with that incorruptible seed of god you will bear the fruits of that holy spirit baptism above everything else above gifts above signs above prophecies right above dreams above miracles above wisdom above all these things he said above all that you will bear the fruits of the holy spirit he says everyday life a humble sweet everyday life serving jesus christ he said you say well i speak in tongues he said you might do that and you might not will i shout you might do that you might not i love this i praise god but there's one sure thing you will do you will bear the fruit of the spirit and the fruit of the spirit is love and joy peace and faith and long-suffering meekness jonas patient your temple will not be ooh just remember when you got that that poisons the holy spirit away from you see when you get to the place that you want to fuss with everybody you come along to there's something wrong praise god he said temper breeds temper so don't argue with people temper breeds temper and love breeds love be full of love jesus said they this will all men know my disciples when you have love one for another that's the fruit of the holy spirit love a few weeks ago my children probably remember this we were having some teasing going on and some just some arguing and children remember what i did i went in every room and you remember what i prayed i say lord let love fill this bedroom remember that you remember that haven remember that when i did that i went in every room and i said lord help us help the children to love each other in this room let the love of jesus christ the love of god come in this room so we don't tease or argue or fuss or hurt or get angry because that may prove we're not born again because if you have the fruit of the spirit the fruit is going to be present right if you're born again you're going to be reproducing fruit people will see the fruit of the holy spirit in your life so i went every room sister beatrice and i prayed i said god let the love of jesus christ fill this room may we not argue and be bitter and fuss it's been a lot better since then amen praise god you see it's it's spirits battling right spirits are battling and satan's always trying to inject leaven right but we gotta take the leaven out praise god amen amen how do you know you're jesus disciples you have love one for another thank the lord now brother is praying at the end of this sermon is your life worth the gospel he says pray god to let the light of this day rise in you to be an obedient servant to god and then let the fruit of the spirit ever remain in your life that is a life worthy of the gospel amen brethren ends this sermon by just emphasizing we got to have the fruit of the holy spirit it must ever remain remember he said above everything else make sure your life is producing the fruit of the holy spirit he said if we are christians of this day let's receive jesus christ into our heart and he is the word don't deny any of it say it's the truth just say it's the truth and place it in your heart and watch the fruit of the spirit upon you and fulfill every promise that he made in the bible amen hallelujah he says may we live a life same sermon from henceforth that's worthy with sweetness and gentleness don't pay no attention say well bless god i know she's got it she spoke with tongues she danced in the spirit that's all right but if she doesn't have the fruit of the spirit the spirit isn't there how about that one praise god she's only impersonating some kind of emotion or something because the holy spirit can only live the life of the fruit of the spirit amen it reminds me of that quote by man says it's the only thing the word can produce amen the only life the holy ghost can produce is a life of the fruit of the holy spirit that's the only life it can produce a godly sweet gentle i'll say bold life amen for jesus christ that's right amen hallelujah i'm enjoying these quotes praise god amen now church what is fruitfulness fruitfulness is maturity right the seed has come to its maturity it's it's your your purpose you've achieved your purpose right there's nine fruits of the holy spirit nine is maturity now there's a whole i preach on numerology remember biblical numerology last year i didn't look all those numbers up but nine was maturity fruitfulness so see that's what this word means this is the whole point of christianity right is to be fruitful that your life produces all of these attributes and you can find love in your life you can find patience and long suffering and meekness and gentleness and temperance right you can find all these fruits in your life let's turn to john 15 here i read this actually as a witness this morning i was reading a little book about uh family christian book and uh they actually brought this scripture so i kind of felt it was a dual witness from the holy spirit john 15 verse 1 i am the true vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit aren't you glad god takes away your bad branches praise god aren't you glad i was pruning our apple tree a few months ago because i couldn't brother ray i couldn't mow under it the branches were i'm like uh i'm getting real close and [Music] i just can't get under it because the branches but i was so happy when i got up there to go prune it praise god for a couple purposes right one purpose now i can mow i can mow under it this year makes my job a lot easier but second is it's going to cut off the life from being wasted in the bad branches and that life is going to get channeled into better branches so it can produce more fruit praise god amen see the heavenly father the great husbandman the lord jesus christ he cuts off every branch that doesn't bear fruit right and then those that are good he purges those as well trims them that it may bring forth more fruit more fruit now look at verse four abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye accept ye abide in me praise god now there's a scripture i was looking for here real quick yeah yeah verse 5 i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing now that's the whole theme of my life right there john 15 5 without jesus christ i can do nothing if there's anything good about me it wasn't me it was christ in me praise god i have never done nothing except it was god if there's any good in it god did it praise god amen now look at verse 8. this is why god delights in holy ghost-filled christians because they keep investing in the talents in their lives they stay focused on doing god's will and after a while they produce much fruit verse 8 herein is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples amen so who are the ones that are going to be bearing a lot of fruit a lot of uh real genuine character of christ the real disciples of christ the people that really learn and really know get to know christ and learn of him because he said i'm meek i'm meek and lowly of heart so the meek disciples are going to come to the meek teacher and they're going to learn from him praise god and then the father is going to be glorified because they bring forth much fruit because they're constantly staying in god's presence they're abiding in the vine they're abiding in the word of god praise the lord amen hallelujah how do you do that verse 10 if you keep my commandments ye shall abide in my love how do you abide in christ keep the commands keep the commands glory now i want to end with this um quote from a message i'll pull it up in just a second here yeah paradox 64. okay it's paradox 64. so give me just a second let me pull these quotes up because this is very helpful to me i think it'll be helpful to you too a lot of people i talk to in the message they say oh the fruits of the spirit are not the evidence of the holy spirit because brother graham said the pharisees and christian science had more fruits than christians now that with that understanding people really aren't really understanding what brother brahm said okay because they need to keep listening and keep reading right so i want to prove that just by going over these quotes again tonight to help uh our church out because i only took i only preached it once in 2016. i want to preach it again tonight so you can see that understanding the fruits of the spirit quotes now when brother branham was speaking from the when brother man was saying these stories about how the pharisees had more fruits than jesus he was speaking from the view of the pharisees and what they thought the fruits of the spirit were but they were wrong okay and this is plainly taught in the quotes he said the pharisees some of them said well it's the fruit of the spirit that's right the pharisees had more fruit of spirit what we call fruit of the spirit than they we could ever produce so what we call not what god calls what just humans call right he said then what did this guy do when he got there he turned over the money tables beat them out there trying to keep a man from getting his soul right with god and what did he say about the godly old priests there of yours they're a bunch of snakes in this uh a bunch of snakes and of the devil talk about the fruit of spirit they had him beat by a long ways now people will read this and say the pharisees had more fruit of the spirit than jesus impossible impossible because i'll say like this jesus was the promised seed hallelujah he was the seed of god amen thank the lord amen he was the woman seed amen that's right hallelujah he was the promised seed of the woman that bruised the head of satan hallelujah amen thank the lord see what the trouble was jesus didn't appear to have much through the spirit according to the pharisees definition of it they thought fruit was kissing babies circumcising babies lending money and other non-fruits of the spirit that's what they thought the fruits of the spirit were okay but that's not the fruit of the spirit now here's what probably says if you lis this is the key message if you have any confusion about the fruits of the spirit uh we need to listen to that one from february 6 1964. because brother adam said god forgive me for doing this i'm going to put jesus on trial for you just a moment if you'll forgive me now heavenly father forgive me for this i don't like to speak it but it's so that the people would know i'm going to take that i'm going against jesus this morning i'm going to say you're a bunch of jewish people so when brother man was ever telling this idea that oh the the priest had more fruit to the spirit than jesus he always means by the jews perspective and not god's perspective amen hallelujah and jesus just rose up here in bakersfield let me call you man together and talk to you about the fruits of the spirit they believe that too what is the fruit of the spirit love joy peace long suffering jealous goodness that right through the spirit many people rely upon that sometimes that's the devil he can impersonate that so what's he talking about people impersonating the fruit of the spirit but they don't have it right if you're if you're impersonating donald trump today you're just impersonating but you're really not him right if you're impersonating brother brandon trying to discern and and you're you're just in person you're really not brother branham right if you're trying to impersonate a good singer you can't sing you're just in person and you don't have the gift to sing right that's what brother is saying the pharisees were impersonating fruits of the spirit they never had it praise god because they rejected jesus christ the seed of god amen right notice he said i'm going there's a priest i'm going to talk to you all now i'm taking sides against jesus just a moment i've asked god to forgive me just so i can show you what i mean to bring out a point so whatever brother man is saying the pharisees and the christian science had more fruit they're in per he says they're impersonating the fruit like they're just kind and nice and they don't argue and they don't shoot people and they don't get angry they're just so kind but it's impersonation it's not real fruit of the holy spirit see brethren teaches satan impersonates the fruit he's taken the perspective of the jews in this scenario then he talks like he's a jew gentlemen i'm here on behalf of your church this morning i'm speaking to you all now there's a young fellow here by the name of jesus he's got a strange strange doctrine we know our priests now we have to judge us by the fruit of the spirit so see he's talking about jews thinking that their priests have the fruits of the spirit and how jesus acts like he doesn't have the fruits of the spirit because he's rough with them all right now for time's sake it's getting late i'm going to skip ahead mine's already too late now he says now that makes sense brothers if you're talking the psychological way of it it all makes sense so the pharisees were psychologically trying to convince themselves that their priests had the fruit of the spirit but they didn't now he said what'd your kind of priest do he got you when your daddy ran out of money he let you that money from his tithe until your crops came in oh mercy who stood by you when your mother was in labor you're you're kind o priest who lifted you up to jehovah circumcise you that kind of priest and look what jesus said he said what do you ever do that had the fruit of the holy spirit i'm just going fast here what these kind of priests do and your soul would not be lost they had some sellers to go up there in the courts make little cages put lambs in there you take your income and and it made something else to keep your economy going and they made you a place you got so sin burdened and you want to get released from your sins this kind of priest had a place you could go buy a lamb of god god didn't want your money set a lamb and you went and bought a lamb he says what did jesus of nazareth do he come in there and empty them out and told them they're a bunch of dead thieves not much of fruit of spirit there is there your kind no priest never gets out of humor see what he's doing he's taking the side against jesus and saying how the jews would say how could jesus have the fruit of the spirit how could he be gentle and yet he drives him out he was gentle amen hallelujah that was gentle praise god he actually didn't hit them with the ropes the bible never says that the bible never says he at the animals he just drove them out of the courts he was gentle that's right now you say brother branham i could say a sermon on this but i won't what is the fruit of the spirit the manifestation of the promised word amen there it is if they just stopped to look he did not have these things that they had fruits of the spirit or anything but the word that was promised that day was manifesting himself that was exactly the light for the hour no matter how much education how much you speak with tongues are kind gentle everything you are unless you accept that word of the hour when it's manifested before you you're in the same predicament this might sound crude i don't doubt it i'm sorry i don't mean it that way but it's truth just believe it see all right now god forgive me you see what i mean who had the fruit of the spirit jesus what message is this church paradox so see all those times brother bam said christian science have more fruit of the spirit jew the jewish kind of priests have more fruit of spirit he's taken the sides of the jews but in this sermon he clearly says who had the fruit of the spirit jesus had it praise god does that help somebody praise the lord amen you'd be surprised how many message people i've talked to that believe brother ray christian science have more fruit of the spirit than we do now we're not trying to compete but the reality of it is if they reject the word of the hour if they reject the seed of the hour how can they have the fruit of that seed when they rejected it they can't you'd be surprised how many people think that that we don't have more fruits of the spirit than the christian science nah brother braham said jesus christ bore every fruit perfectly praise god let's stand our feet here i'll close now always don't judge your life by how much power you have to perform miracles we don't judge ourselves by how much knowledge you have of the word but always judge yourself look back and take an inventory of what kind of fruit that the life you presently live now is bearing praise god and here's one i read earlier if she doesn't have the fruit of the spirit the spirit isn't there praise god musicians you can come here praise god i hope that was a help to somebody tonight paul said as i repeat that you were sometimes darkness but now you are light in the lord walk as children of the light for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth you know who the famous christian science is tom cruise how do you know who tom cruise is he's a famous american hollywood actor you know how many wives he's had at least two or three or four and so people that believe that they take those quotes and they don't understand them how could a man that's been married three times and then make love with countless women on movies how can he have more walking in the light we are the children of the light so the seed in us can be brought forth to produce the fruit of the spirit amen he says if they don't have the fruit of the spirit the spirit isn't there let's bow our heads here church we don't want to impersonate the fruit of the spirit we want to bear the fruit of the spirit paul tells these christians there they're some of the last ones there right because this city didn't last very long he says make sure you have the fruit of the spirit and all goodness and righteousness in truth take a moment church let's look at the garden of your life do you see the fruit of love laying there can you love your enemies you see the fruit of joy there you have joy some in the midst of trials do you see the fruit of peace there that you feel peace in your heart with god and with man [Music] you see the fruit of long suffering praise god you can suffer a long time with people do you see the fruit of gentleness over there in your garden ah praise god do you see the fruit of goodness laying there can your family come over and pluck some fruit of faith off your your vine well i know sister will pray for me she's got faith
