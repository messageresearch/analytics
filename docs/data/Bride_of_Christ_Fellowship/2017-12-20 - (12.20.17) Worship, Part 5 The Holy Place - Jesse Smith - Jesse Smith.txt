so we had about sixty kids there and just got time to get home get every packed up and come up here so I didn't get a chance to pray before service I'd like to do that next I'd like to take some prayer requests by God's grace I guess I'll do announcements first here I did send a church Imam I think it was yesterday or the day before yeah yesterday there will be service 4:00 p.m. this Sunday that's because Christmas is Monday everybody came to spend all day Monday with their family I thought well since everybody has Monday off off let's have two services on Sunday so Sunday evening if you if you have a request for a topic you like me to preach about let me know I'm gonna be open to that if not I was thinking about teaching on the seven thunders or teaching on what we believe about Christmas I like to go over that it's been years since I went over that be nice to know be nice to share with you what our family believes and we try to take everything back to the word and then you know brother branham's life and just find the best balance in there by God's grace so I was thinking bout that for Sunday p.m. let me know if you know if you have a desire for either one of those topics also guest ministers coming up by God's grace we had brother Brian Hawkins be here next Sunday not this Sunday the following Sunday December 31st just one service with brother Brian Hawkins my

family and prayer so yes one of the pastor's asked prayer for a pastor and then for a lost husband and son for salvation so I'll just say New York New York family prayed for their home pastor and then salvation for husband and son is that a because in that a beautiful desire you know a woman there she's all just faithful to the Lord and wants to see God save her husband and her son by God's grace also I bring greetings from brother Isaiah Brooks he sent greetings to all the saints and we had some tremendous meetings it was just a meeting it was like a weekend of repentance there was probably 25 to 30 people come up for prayer it was tremendous as far as to see God move in the area of repents I mean I'm not talking dried eye confession I'm talking weeping one of the guys was almost fallen over under the anointing of the Holy Spirit and it was really powerful so we had some really powerful meetings I'd was just rejoice that I said well thank you Lord you know you're so merciful to Hahn

on that final day let us proudly stand and boldly say aye I will give all of our legions to teasers amen hey let's take our Bibles here this evening by God's grace I'd like to go back to that series on worship and I'd like to look at focus on shewbread I'm just gonna call it holy place I'm just gonna let's look at part five of worship and I just want to look at the holy place so we'll read one just one portion of Scripture let me go there here aside about my notes like to go to let's go to Exodus 25 verse 30 let's just read that by the grace of God Exodus 25 30 and this thought was kind of quickened to me I preached this out in Iowa a little bit different thoughts were kind of quickened to me out there and I had one brother call one of the sermons he said that was monumental he told me I said well there's no way I could preach a monumental sermon it had to been Jesus because there's no good thing about me under that Jesus says apart from me you can do nothing and then other people came up and said you know it was just God talking directly to them so very thankful for that we all want God to talk to us don't we you don't want to say Lord Here I am speak to me send me Exodus 20:5 please so I want to focus like I said on the holy place I'll probably spend most of my time tonight on the shewbread I've never really preached on the shewbread before so I've been doing some studies on that over the weekend and this morning and I want to preach on that this morning by God's grace X is 25 verse 30 we'll just read that one verse X is 25 verse 34 there say Amen let's read that together on three one two three and thou shalt set upon the table shewbread before me always amen so God is asking them as priests that they have to always have shewbread laying before God in the holy place and as we'll see it was their responsibility to make sure the shewbread was there and it was laid before God Amen thank God for that now how many know it which day they ate the shewbread on as they might know the Sabbath it's on the day of rest on their day of rest they got to enjoy the shewbread how we know the Bible said that we've entered into our rest praise the Lord when do we eat our shewbread when we enter our Sabbath resting from our works and Christ in us Christ living in us the hope of glory that's that word of Prayer let's just bow our heads here if you have need on your heart again maybe for this service let's make it known to the Lord by raising up hand father my hands are up Lord we love you again we worship you we love you not just with words but with our lives Lord God our lives say I love you our our words that we speak say I love you our work that we do in home or on the job our work says I love you we love you tonight Lord speak to us through this thy holy word Lord God and I pray you be glorified here and all that said and done father use me as your vessel Lord God I just want to be submissive Lord God I know there's nothing good about me Lord apart from you I can do nothing so help me tonight help your people tonight and speak to us through thy word in Jesus Christ's name never I said amen god bless you B&C the praise the Lord so this Sunday Lord willing uh it was my desire to preach kind of what I preached on the the Sunday morning there in Iowa I just caught it and I don't remember this I caught it from the red heifer they were there when I preached the red heifer over and that that was back in 2015-2016 I think I want to preach a message Sunday called from the red heifer to the Holies of Holies so and that's what like I said brought a lot of people you know to the altar so well could we do some slides here I just want to show some visuals I kind of want to review some of these thoughts I was like I said I wasn't really planning on this it just kind of came up and we remember the tabernacle Moses you know on Sunday I want to just show the believers journey through this again and I want to bring it the way we brought it last year and I've never preached this thought this way before but I want to preach it from the red heifer all the way to the Holies of Holies and I think I'll use that this Sunday by God's grace so remember that with the tabernacle Moses you know you had brother Simon was here had some good visuals too you had all the the tribes of God camped around the tabernacle of God this was God's dwelling place and God always likes to dwell right in the middle praise God God likes to be right in the middle of your life how many thankful for that not only does he want to be in the middle of your life he wants to be in the middle of your soul praise God the middle of your being so that's what you know God's tabernacle is likened to today the Bible said your whole spirit soul and body I remember just as there's three courts here you have the outer court you know this this Tabernacle was a type of the human body and so we have the body of man and you have the temple the Tabernacle Moses I didn't know I had all these slides on here actually wasn't planning on doing all this this is kind of surprising to me so this outer court represents the body and of course you have the outer court of the man the spirit of man is the mind and that represents the holy place so tonight we're going to spend some time looking at the holy place again that's the human spirit of the individual but then inside of the inside we know after the human spirit there's soul inside of that human spirit and the prophets that is actually located in your physical heart there's a hole in your heart and that's where the soul is in the physical heart of man and so you have the soul of man which is a type of the Holies of Holies okay now I got all these scriptures this is an old slide I so I want to tonight I just wanted to kind of look at this here as we look at just the tabernacle itself you know you have the gate the brazen altar the Laver the holy place and the Holies of Holies I want to spend most of my time in the Holy in the holy place I just another visual I'm gonna skip past that one I just remember this remember you had your tribes on all four sides you have Judah on the east you have Reuben on the south Dan on the north and then ephraim on the west and everybody had a banner right everybody had a flag praise God and Dan was flying the Eagle anointing praise God that's type to us today on the north side we know we have there under the eagle anointing for this day and the Eagles likened to a prophet because the Bible said that God brought Israel out of Egypt on the wings of eagles how do you do it by Moses and Aaron all right the Bible in one place has Moses Aaron and Miriam so God puts you know his sister and her her ministry in there too but we know it was Moses that a prophet that God brought him out on pardon me I don't know how I can mess this up I hope I don't mess it up now the outer core I love this this is what I think it really helped us on Sunday when we preached on this the outer court and now this is not and I'm not gonna do the the red heifer this the tonight I'll do wait for that for Sunday but once you got in the first thing you would experience was a real genuine death if you want to worship God how many wanna be close to God I remember this is a type of the New Testament if any believer wants to be a king or priest today the very first thing we need is a real death that animal couldn't just be cut and bled you know it had to literally die and now how many of us not wait let's be honest you know with everybody we know that goes to church all of our family friends no matter what Church how many go to church ready to die out and I mean really die how many really take that attitude well I want to go and I know I'm gonna leave that at the altar today how many people but Adam well how many shaking his head like that's what I do too how many people most people don't they go there to hear a nice make you laugh you know or to make you cry or but most people don't really want to experience death they don't want to let go maybe they'll let go of some things but but they got to keep that one lingering sin that's actually hindering their race it's hindering their spiritual run but God was showing here the very first thing once you actually get into worship you've got to die you you can't let this live something has to die guess what in the New Testament now you're the living sacrifice once you went in here yeah the first time you went in yes you have to recognize Jesus Christ but after this if you want to get back in if you want to come back and worship now you're the one that's got to die right is that true that's right because we're in a show with the red heifer when somebody was unclean they were cut off from the church how would you like it if well I mean this is way it ought to be but how would you like it if there was some machine we could hook up right when you walked in the door and it told us if you were clean or unclean I guess I liked that that that's how it wasn't the Old Testament if you were unclean you couldn't even get to the death part because you got to get clean first then you're ready to die raise god you got to get rid of what you know is wrong what you know is sinful you've got to get rid of that first and get clean get wash in the waters of the word then you can now come into the worship of God and you can really experience a real death hallelujah that's right and then you know after the death after you know suffering and experiencing the pain of death with worship then you would go to the brazen and I got these mixed up so I just go back here here's the brazen altar so I got these my order mixed up here because remember all that all the sacrifice that had to be examined outside of the camp I'm sorry outside of the gate rather not the camp outside of the gate they're to be examined out there the priests had to examine it make sure there's a good lamb or or Turtledove or whatever they were bringing and then it had to die right there on the brazen altar now after that you know with many of the offerings with the meat offering or meat offering that was actually a bread but with the burnt offering and sin offering some of the other offerings that they had to be cut how many know that they had to be rightly divided and then in Leviticus 1:9 for sin offering the sin offering had to be rightly divided and then you had to take the inward parts different parts and you had to wash them in water amen like that so the very insides of the sacrifice had to be washed before they were presented to God amen does that sound familiar we've got a coconut listen we've got to come to God Church now I'm challenging you and I'm challenging me we've got to come to church and worship and we got to be willing to die out and then after you die out now God can wash your inward parts and that's the literal word in that Leviticus 1:9 they'll wash the inward parts after you is it present yourself Lord I know you're my sacrifice but now I'm coming help me to be a living sacrifice Lord cut cut things out of my life praise God separate me from any any wrong you know separate me from anything and Lord wash my inward parts praise God that I can be clean amen wash me and let me be up for let me be an acceptable sacrifice member we ought to live worthy of the vocation where we're in we're called amen and so see do most people come like that really ready to die I would probably say no most people most church members I don't care if you call yourself Methodist or Pentecostal most people really don't come here to die because if something died you'd see it right you'd hear it if something really died you'd hear you'd realize it my something just died so we got to be we got to be aware of this so we got to make sure we examine our worship how many one examine their worship that's where this little series you know I just kind of fell inspired with faith comes by hearing and you can never overemphasize revelation some of these different quotes you know we brought out about a worship you know just felt led to go into this for worship just remind us this was true worship something has to die in order to worship and that's why I church when you're tired and you don't want to raise your hands but you do guess what happened your will just died or you're tired and your feet hurt and you'd rather stay at home and not come to church and brother Jesse says let's stand to our feet and you're like no I have to but your will dies something died amen now you're worshiping praise God but see if we let the sinful nature and we don't really sacrifice for God are we really worshiping because we must worship in spirit and in truth praise God you see it's got to be it's something has to die or will our desires our plans our reluctance our tiredness our fearfulness our greed our desires whatever it is something has to die if we're really going to worship Jesus amen he requires it remember what Paul said as he died I die every Sunday is that what Paul said I die on Sunday and Wednesday is that what the scripture says what's it say I die what daily we die think we got a practice dying every day amen hallelujah where I'm not going to think those thoughts anymore Lord take those thoughts from me so I can think your thoughts amen let me die to this habit I've been writing this habit so this I'm sorry this habits been riding me so long like brother Graham said this dark clouds been hanging over me too long help me to die out to this dark cloud amen I cannot give God a worship unless something dies something has to some attitude or some belief or some state of mind or some sin or some desire it has to die now you're worshiping a Manny and then you say wash me Lord cleanse me wash me in the waters of the word now let's work our way in here I want to spend the most amount of time what I plan to do tonight by God's grace I just want to review the candlestick real quick because we've been preaching on the 7 church ages I don't know if you've known this when the last year I've been preaching on the church ages we've been enjoying all the beautiful light right inside the holy place I don't know if you knew that or not but that's what we've been doing it's like we as priests and kings through this sermon series that brother Branham preached remember he said it wasn't optional he said it was what necessary he said I wouldn't waste your time and bring you to church eight nights in a row if I didn't feel it was necessary to know these things this is necessary and so the Holy Ghost has directives in here all these months is last year we've been lucky with our Laodicea and we went back to Ephesus and worked our way up now we're at Philadelphia we're almost done we got a few prime or a few more sermons on that but we have been standing in the glory and the illumination of the seven golden candlesticks amen seeing all these beautiful things as beautiful lights of the messengers just enjoying the radiance of the light of God amen hallelujah that's what we've been enjoying amen for those of us enjoying the Word of God and I'm one of those praise the Lord Amen hallelujah like I said there's been many things in the word in the church ages that have been a blessing to me and have really helped me in an hour when I needed them I needed these thoughts I needed these revelations and they came at the very hour I needed them amen now let's step in here no heed something died here hopefully tonight something died hopefully were washed you know through worshiping the word now we would step in here to the holy place now it was really kind of dramatizing it in Iowa was really kind of just exciting for me I've never really thought about like that but I was I was preaching on this really hard about dying out to sins and things and then I just kind of I kind of pretended I was like the priest and can you imagine we're the priests going in here and you pull back the veil and what's the first thing you would see light right there there's no windows so it wouldn't be natural light it'd be this special holy light hey man and anybody that tried to copy that light God would cut him off because there was one light that they were supposed to have we can worship under one light amen not the light of another age we worship under God's whole spirit light the light for this hour so can you imagine church as we dramatize it you pull back the curtain usually seen something die your inward parts have been lost and now you step into the holy place and you pull back the veil and the first thing you see is all this beautiful light hallelujah it would be glorious it would be just a breathtaking scene did you know how many lamps and Solomon had in his temple 10 he had 10 can you imagine the light when you pull back the veil and not just one now that Moses day they just had one now its course it still be bright but can you imagine the brightness of 10 of those 10 10 candlesticks and are matters to the priests and days of Solomon's they imagine they just got used to it the overpowering radiance of the light and we know what God was symbolizing here many Jews to this day are blind to it they don't know what this is symbolizing here they don't know what this symbolizes but this is symbolizing Jesus ministering to 7 church ages amen most people don't know that most Jews don't know that and I'll say like this much most churches don't know that either they think it's all what Jesus was just dealing with these 7 individual churches in Asia yes he was but these were prophetic insights about the future conditions of the church ages and how we could be overcomers amen the battles we'd face but then also the overcoming power and the light we would need to shine the oil for our day amen glory and so this was just amazing your mother Graham says this just wasn't his idea he says the Seven Church Ages were thus saith the Lord so this is the Lord saying after something dies after your inwards or wash you come into the holy place another deeper step in worship we know sanctification and now you see the light or the illumination of the Seven Church Ages hallelujah can I read to you again if it's all right I want to read to you again what the prophets said about the seven church ages because I don't want you to forget this I think it's very important that we read it let me get it right here he says this this this volume will concern itself with various major doctrines such as the Godhead water baptism found in Revelation chapters 1 through 3 its main theme is setting forth of a detailed study of the seven church ages this is necessary in order to study and understand the rest of the book of Revelation how many one who grow closer to God all the time the only way to understand the book of Revelation and prophecies is to have the true illumination of the seven Church ages preached to us amen we will not understand the rest of the book of Revelation unless we truly understand the golden candlesticks amen hallelujah he says this is necessary for out of the church ages come the seals and out of the seals come the trumpets which the seven trumpets are to Israel the seven trumpets go to Israel and how do the trumpets come the vials and the vows are poured out of course during the Tribulation Period we'll get to that as well like the first burst of a roman candle listen the church ages come forth with a mighty initial illumination remember that so it's like we said we pull back the curtain you know let's say it's dark outsiders in the early morning they pull back the curtain and now there's just a mighty illumination it's on the south side they come into the curtain there's a mighty lumination and the Prophet said that's what the church Ages is to you and I amen he said without this mighty illumination without which there could be no further light but once the brilliance of the seven church age is given by divine revelation light upon light follows until the whole of Revelation opens wide before our wandering eyes and we are edified and purified by its spirit and are made ready for its glorious appearing even our Lord and Savior the one true God Jesus Christ amen praise God how they do you know there's just another that's a that's a page I scanned it's just that gives you another visual you know they had the oil and then the the tongs there and different things I'm not ready to preach really on that here's what I want to get to I want to get to this instrument right here this is what I studied on all day today so now this should all be fresh because I don't think I've ever preached on the shewbread so I did all the quotes brother Graham said about shewbread there's 19 no I'm sorry there's 18 and all the scriptures on shewbread there's 19 scriptures on Schubert it kind of worked out pretty easy that's a pretty easy search compared to something where you got you know 200 quotes or something like that it's a pretty good pretty simple search I was able to get it done on the plane and then finished this morning how many thankful for God's grace today how many grateful to feast on the shewbread let's look at this here that's like I said let's start with scriptures and then I'll end with some quotes to show what this represents we already read Exodus 25 so now let's go to Leviticus if you got your Bible let's go to Viduka let's just read some I'm sorry let's go to axis 35 okay I'm sorry 25 was where it was introduced and now let's go to Exodus 35 before we go a little bit against Exodus thirty-five forgive me I was jumping I forgot to have the scripture now this has got to be important how many leave it's important without the illumination without the brilliance of the candlestick would we even be able to see the bread no would we and that's why we get to on Sunday - well we would he would we be even able to see the altar of incense if there was no Church ages no could we even have a prayer life altar of incense without the glory of the church ages no you couldn't we need the glory and the light and the illumination of the seven church ages in order to see the bread of God eat the bread of God and able to pray have a real prayer life so we can get into the Holies of Holies amen you couldn't get in God wouldn't let you get in because God had a system you had to enter that way death washing and then candlestick and then bread and then altar of incense then the holy place and how we know God's a God of order God has a probe I did way of worship praise God so we see that by the grace of the Lord now this is once Aaron and Moses had everything set up this is the scripture and want you to see this verse 10x is 35 10 if you got your Bibles okay this is after the people have been instructed first God showed the vision to Moses of the heavenly pattern that the tabernacle in heaven he showed in the pattern on the Mount okay and then Moses saw that pattern he brought the pattern down he instructs the people let's go to verse 5 so we can see that in verse 4 God Moses tells the people God commanded you to do this and then in verse 5 take you from among you and offering it unto the lord who suffer is of a willing heart let him bring it an offering of the Lord gold silver and brass how many want to be a willing offer er I don't want someone to force me to give an offering unto God I never want to feel like well if I don't go to church they're gonna think I'm back slid I don't want to have that kind of attitude I don't want to I don't want to serve God out of you know necessity feel like well I'm doing it for you guys I love to do it nobody even if nobody shows up I'll be there in fact that was last Wednesday which I'm glad you stayed at home because it was awful on the drive home can I just test it by real quick we were we were driving home and this woman spun out in front of us and we've got trailer been there you know the the nineteen eighteen wheel trailers driving by and the church Malakai lady were with me and this woman spins out in front of us and it was just God's grace she spins out I'm slowing down slowing down well I couldn't stop enough and we hit just a little bit and as soon as we hit a trailer truck started driving by you know how her thinking oh god I think I shouted Jesus or something like that mercy Lord or something like that and the woman got out and said are you okay I said yeah we're fine she said okay so she drove away you know it was it was just a little small tap and so and it was just amazing it was like after those first few trucks went by there was nobody else and we just got she got able to start again got on the road we got back on the road got home checked the check the van there's not even a debt on the van but we fell to shake the dents or any accidents so I just want to thank the Lord for that because you and I know I mean the you and I know with all the the trailers and the trucks on the road we could have been killed it would have been nothing and like I said as soon as we hit there a couple trucks went by boom boom boom and then all of a sudden is like there's a stop in traffic now who could do that but Jesus the righteous or order the Lord now part of me feels a little foolish for coming but the same time there's so many times church and you know this - there's so many times where the forecast says there's gonna be snow and there's no snow I was like I'm not gonna let some forecast keep me on the house of God I'm glad you guys take home though I think look at me I really am I'm glad I'm glad you stayed at home but I also knew it was of God too because the sermon I got for last Wednesday I got it because we had a snow day that or no no we had a two-hour delay that day so I wouldn't even had all the sermon notes had we not had the two-hour delay that morning so I thought well God was giving me the message for that night so I've got to go preach how could I get a message and not go preach so anyways I just want to say that it's very thankful for that but I want to be willing to do it I don't want someone to have to force me to do now are there times I'm gonna have to force my flesh to do it absolutely absolutely but as a whole as a whole what's what's motivating your life is it well I'm grudgingly doing this I'm grudgingly serving God I'm grudgingly paying my ties and grudgingly go to church I'll grudgingly shake their hand you know is that grudgingly or is it love from a willing heart this is what God was showing the people you've got to do it willingly you have to give God your will look at verse 10 God wants a willing heart now look what Moses says now now God says if you're willing you're actually wise to how many want to be a wise virgin well that's what I want more than anything else make me wise Jesus so here he says I need a willing heart and then Moses describes it as their wise hearted amen so someone that willingly gives their life willingly gives their money willingly gives their time someone that willingly gives it themself to Christ God says you're wise amen look at verse 10 and every wise hearted among you shall come and make all that the LORD hath commanded the table and his staves and his vessels and the shewbread and they came look everyone whose heart stirred him up don't you like that oh I want my heart to be stirred up when God calls me to do something I want my heart to be in it I don't want to have to try to stir myself up or atom try to stir me up or Malachi come on pastor get up there and preach come on get up there at least oh I don't want somebody to try to stir me up I want God to stir me up because the Bible said it's throw up the gift of God in your life see they God said only bring the people whose hearts are stirred up and everyone whom his spirit made willing and they brought the Lord's offering to the work of the tabernacle congregation for all of his service and for the holy garments and they came both men and women as many as were willing hearted and we'll stop right there because he lists all the things they brought they brought their bracelets and their earrings and rings and tabards and all these things and they game to the Lord so that's the next that's the next scripture that shows even the people that we were gonna make the shewbread had to be willing to do it I'm reading the Bible looks like the coal hats were they're actually the ones that made the shewbread not the not the try believe I know I'm sorry they're all the tribal Levi's but they're different brothers within Levi the co halves were a different family than em Rams family you know we're came out Aaron so there were different families in the same tribe but the co halves baked the bread but then the priests would minister the bread I'm sorry the Levites would minister the bread Aaron's sons so I can do preach more on that on Sunday Lord willing now now go to Leviticus please the babies 24 this is one of the most beautiful portions on shewbread I think in the scripture because now we see actually when they would would eat it okay Leviticus 24 verse five bless you Leviticus 24 verse five now before I read this I want to read what Scofield said anybody got a Scofield Bible I'm gonna read Scofield you don't have to read along with me I just want to read it I want to read what Scofield says about shewbread as a type of Christ huh me know the bread types Christ huh me know everything type Christ everything in the Tabernacle type Christ now I don't understand this the 60 there were 60 pillars that went around the gate I don't understand that I can't I can't fit all the types together but I know somebody who can that's Jesus I don't understand some of these things I'm just like I said even with the shewbread I'm just starting to understand this now but they all type Christ brother have said everything spoke of Christ now Scofield says show bread or type of Christ the bread of god christ is the nourisher of the christians life as a believer priest in john 6 our Lord has more in mind than manna that food which came down but all the typical meanings of the bread are there gathered into his words the manna is the life-giving Christ amen the shewbread the life-sustaining Christ aren't you glad he sustains your life he keeps you going from one week to the next who does that Jesus what's your bread every week how do you get your nourishment I'm eating on the bread of God amen he says the shewbread type of ice typifies Christ as the corn of wheat ground in the mill of sufferings he died went through suffering was ground up and brought into the fire of judgment had to be cooked he walked the the what was it in the book of Revelation can't think of it now the the fierceness of the winepress the wrath of Almighty God yes he says and then brought into the fire of judgment we as priests by faith feed upon him as having undergone that in our stead and for our sakes it is mediation upon Christ as in Hebrews 12 amen so Christ is our bread Christ is our nourishment for our journey amen now let's read Leviticus 24 verse 5 this has the main types here to understanding this as far as I understand verse 5 and thou shalt take fine flour remember but man said that father or flour all had to be ground to the same the same type of grains Legrand said because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever had to be finely ground so every bit of the flour was the same the simplicity of the property because it's so true and then baked 12 cakes thereof so there should be twelve on here one two three four five okay six and six very good they got that right to tenth deals shall be in one cake I don't know what the two tenth means I don't know I'm sure there's something behind that and thou shalt set them in two rows six on a row so see six ain't always a bad number I know it's the number of man but a good man there's nothing wrong with a good man is there was anything wrong with Adam when when God made Adam on the sixth day was anything wrong with him no was he saved of course was he a type of Christ you better believe it Dave ahem he was a type of Christ there's nothing wrong with that yes we know in man's sin yea then the six becomes a bad number but six can be a good number too because it's God's number six on a row upon I like this the pure table before the Lord I remember the days of Hezekiah Hezekiah is dad this is course after David Hezekiah his dad let the the tabernacle spoil and he put images and altars in there and the Bible said I just read it this morning the Bible said Hezekiah had to clean out the whole temple and he had to clean off the table you know why because spiritually there was vomit all over those tables because it was idol worship right and not only that there was dust God doesn't want a dirty house God wants his house clean amen if you're gonna eat bread who wants to eat bread on a on a moss-covered table nobody wants to eat bread everybody wants to eat on something clean praise God we got the five-second rule the three-second rule well from what I've seen that's even a bad rule there's so much trash on the floor and animal hairs and you know different things like that it's not even a good rule God said make the table clean praise God amen remember God said you said it before me amen that means God's watching our bread God wants our bread he wants it to be his bread amen he wants it to be clean bread and and the healthy bread God's watching we must give the offering we must prepare the bread and we must lay it before the Lord God wants us to lay our teachings and and lay the word that we preach he wants to lay before him amen and he wants to say that's good bread that's the kind of bread I taught you to make that's the kind of bread you're gonna eat on the Sabbath hey how do you praise God because the Bible said we are stewards of the mysteries of God let me know that our Stewart is overseer so it's kind of like I don't know if it'd be the CEO or not I've never been really I've just always like I guess it would be like the principal I'll try to relate it to something I know about schools the principal's like the general overseer he came in my classroom and he had to evaluate me mr. Smith a good teacher I tell you at the highest grading this year I said thank you Jesus in the midst of my busy life I said thank you Jesus and he said how'd you do that I said well I just filed the rubric I just followed the directions and I did everything you asked me to do but that really encouraged me but he's like the overseer he has to make sure the bread I'm giving out to the children the instruction I give out to the children is the right kind of bread praise God and so it is with any business someone has to be the overseer I think brother Loras does quality control I think if I remember right you know text me about Loras if I'm wrong they always you know livestream every service text me but I thought he was under quality control to make sure everything's the right qualities he's like an overseer you know what if something goes wrong they looked a brother Laura since they brought Loras you know there's no brother but they said Lawrence you know where's this part so he's got to make trips I don't you make trips to make sure will HUD the part go wrong or what happened he's like oh overseer well that's what the priests are that's what the the preachers are with God's Word we have to make sure this is the right kind of bread hallelujah there's nothing evil in it there's no disease in it it's got to be totally healthy amen there can't be no trash in the pot is that what happened with Elijah there was some death in the pot there's got to be nothing but life in those those loaves there must be life in the bread and thank God we know there's life in the Word of God the bread of God amen glory it's a pure table there's no vomit over remember brother may have said that scripture in Isaiah 28 there's vomit on the tables of God which which which is like the lair to see a church ages remember Jesus said I'm gonna spew them out of my mouth this is a perfect type of our day where there's vomit oh hey to say it like that but there's vomit all over the churches if they refuse to preach God's Word jesus said I'll spew out of my mouth because you're rich and increased with Goods and don't have any more need of the Holy Ghost one evidence that you've got the Holy Ghost is you want more of the Holy Ghost amen that's one evidence you really got the Holy Ghost because the first time they got persecuted Acts chapter four what they do they ran back to the prayer meetings that God give us boldness help me to be more bold yet they've got eternity in their soul they've got a seal brother had them in their soul to the day of their Redemption but they're crying out God make me more both for you Church we ought to come to churches and if we're not bold say God make me more bow for the kingdom of God that's what evidence you're born again you got to have more of God just like them they got to have more bread every week amen it's exactly right beautiful thank you Jesus a pure table but alert we're living in a day where most the tables are full of vomit God can't talk because preachers are scared are going to lose people if they preach the truth I always want to have a church where I can preach anything I want and I don't even care what anybody thinks other than God I want now they're going wrong if I got to rebuke people I want to say it with kindness and directness I don't want to get off into a critical spirit cuz I've been I've done that before I made mistakes we make mistakes I don't want to get in the wrong spirit I want to be in the right spirit but if I don't rebuke sin what happens god kick God's Word can't get to the people they'll come to church and they won't they won't die out to themselves they'll get comfortable living in sin they'll never get even past the outer court praise God and that's what I want to get to on Sunday that's why when people come to church there they don't enjoy church anymore because they can't get in they can't even they haven't even filed God's way how they gonna hear God speak in the holiest of Holies on the mercy seat how are they gonna hear God speak off the mercy seat when they haven't even died it out at the outer court and of course they're gonna fall out a church of course they're not gonna want to read their Bible anymore because they haven't even filed God's provide a way to get into the Holies of Holies but someone who follows all those steps they love coming to God's house because they hear God's voice amen they follow the steps there are truly super amen they're worshiping in spirit and in truth hallelujah that's why and as much as we're to show that type on Sunday I'm not going to go into tonight but there's a type there's a beautiful type there if you don't come to the house of God and worship the right way you're not even gonna get in you're not even getting the holy place you're not even gonna feel like the preachers preaching any bread it's not because the preachers now bring in bread if it's the word it's bread it's because we haven't done the worship we're supposed to do that's right that's right and that's what convicted so many people out in Iowa to come to the altar and church I'll say like this all's I preached on the sin was the same thing I preached here I preached on church attendance how people are more faithful to their job than Church they'll miss church but they won't miss their job hallelujah and the Bible commands we must gather the more and so much more of the Bible says as we see that Day approaching now who do you see that's really increasing their their church attendance well hopefully all of our hands can go up tonight because you did a good job coming on the midweek service but most people just Sunday morning hopefully more people are over here he's live-streaming but like but we take that for every Church also I preached on there was things that the Bible already said I wasn't trying to bring a new revelation I was just trying to get the people to do it the Bible already told him to do and there's numerous people come up prayer and asking God to help them then I preach on tithing I just hammered tithe and I just felt let the Lord to hammer tithing and just said the Bible says the reason you tithe is to let you fear God and so if someone's not tithing it's because they fear their bank or their mortgage more than they fear God and the church said tithing teaches you to fear God in other words I respect God more than I respect my uh my debtor who ever I owe money to and I had numerous people come up crying about paying ties they said God was speaking right to me because I wasn't paying my ties I don't know about you but do you want to be guilty of robbing God we should already hate robbing man how about robbing God and people will come to God's house but they had him and they walk out and the the bank alarms of heaven are going off rear rear robbery robbery but everybody walks out to shake hands and nobody sees it except the angels of God and God they write it down they didn't they robbed God they robbed God they robbed God and the Bible said these will not inherit the kingdom of God and brother man said tithes and offerings are eternal how do you know they're eternal because in the in the heavenly City when the New Jerusalem come down the bottle said the kings of the earth bring their glory and honor into the city and program said that's tithing and offerings did you catch that in other words the the people that are outside of the city the people that are not bribed are going to be paying ties for all eternity I wonder if it's because they didn't pay ties while they were on earth right and their first body God is going to make them pay tithe for all eternity because tithes and offerings are eternal I don't know about you but if I pay my tithes I get my checkbook out and I start writing and I'm not begging for money you do understand I'm just saying you don't want to be a thief and there's every excuse in the book but brother Branham hits every excuse in the book he he let his family not eat supper sometime or not have as much food because he's so he could pay his ties I've got a quote on that weight and he even put God paying ties over paying off his debts his medical debts and he go down there and say well I only got 5 cents this week but I'm gonna give you I can't give it I can't give you your medical bill because I'm paying God my ties but see they'll make excuses well they'll this and this and that well why don't you have the same faith of brother branham head if you believe the message of brother Branham from Jesus never understand and then I preached on marriage but I bought out some some marriages there how people weren't in the honeymoon period anymore and I bought out pornography and I people come up men and women and women men and women weeping about pornography ruining their homes I grow men weeping and crying saying little Jessie I gotta clean out my home because it's unclean Church we just we should do what we know we're supposed to do but so many people are not even doing just what they know to do people say well I want to know more things about new things about God where are we living the things we already know yet God's not gonna give us anything new until we do the old stuff praise the Lord and you would have seen a church use just seen all the people come up it was amazing to me but I know that's how God does his word I don't know how it got on that but I told you I tell you about it so there you go okay I was just trying to get to verse 7 that's what I'm trying to get to all rights go to verse 7 living is 24/7 let me said timing huh I got to take care of my body too ok verse 7 and thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row that it may be on the bread for a memorial so this container must be full of frankincense one of these I'm not sure which one but they would take that and pour frankincense so the bread was anointed with frankincense upon DRO then it may be on the breaded for a memorial so the frankincense was on the bread as a memorial so to remember something frankincense on bread would help you remember something I mean know what brother Ram said frankincense was he said it represents service to Jehovah remember gold frankincense and myrrh gold deity frankincense in service myrrh death Jesus had gold frankincense myrrh he said Jesus was deity and service to die amen hallelujah I remember the Hat God's wrap gift brother man preach that gold in service to Jehovah to die amen and so this represents service of the Lord so the bread must be anointed with service praise God we must serve God we as a Remora remember we must remember the bread of God takes service we must happy anointed during service amen we must have the anointing while the bread is being served as a memorial amen hallelujah we also remember its service to come here and feast on the Word of God amen it's a service to God to remember how important it is to God remember if we're not careful this becomes dull of hearing coming to church does it become important anymore the bread is okay but I've had that bread before I'd I'd rather watch you know some game show or something like that and that becomes your bread instead of the Living Word of God well let me tell you the only thing that'll satisfy you is not a game show it's Jesus Christ that's the only thing I was satisfied only thing to make you happy only thing that'll give you hope the only thing that'll pep you up is the Word of God hallelujah see oh see it's got to be anointed with frankincense as remember the service of God remember this bread is in service to to God this is God's service God loves service and brother BAM said Jesus keeps all of his appointments at service amen all right versus finishing verse seven even an offering made by fire unto the Lord so this is our service this is what we have to offer to God after we've seen the glory of the church ages and seeing those things now we have to offer this bread as a service to God verse 8 I love this every Sabbath he shall set it in order before the Lord continually every Sabbath every time there's a period of rest this fresh bread now if you can if you know the history - they would switch out the bread every Sabbath day praise God let's keep reading it and it will show it every Sabbath day he should set it in order before the Lord continually being taken from the churn of Israel by an everlasting covenant and it shall be Aaron's and his sons and they shall eat it in the holy place for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the Lord made by fire by a perpetual statute so sometime on Friday they must on Friday than the night they must have started baking the bread the kohathites the kohathites would be in there they washing their hands and they start making the bread and sometime on Saturday after the lamps were lit you know they're coming here they're coming a priest with twelve loaves and him along with some other priest would come in there they'd make sure the lights are burning they could say praise God the light of Laodicea is shining all around us that's what we can say when we come in the house of God hallelujah the light of every church age the Holy Ghost anointing from every church age is shining in us we're in the service of the Lord amen don't worry we've got the light of the latest in church age it's the overcomer hallelujah amen and after that they bring these twelve loaves in and I read from alfred edersheim one time that they made sure the very second the bread was lifted it took its place because Jesus or God said make sure there's bread always on my table so they made sure as soon as it was taken off it was immediately there and after they made the exchange on both sides of course they anointed it you know with the frankincense after that the group of priests would gather and they eat that red before the Lord so they were eating the old bread but God already had fresh bread on his table God always wants fresh bread on his table amen hallelujah and as soon as the bread was a week old they took it off and that's when the priest would eat it but when God's there in God's presence you always give God the fresh bread your God always wants the fresh bread before his face for worship praise God and then when the switch is made then you and I would eat there on the bread in the holy place and we'd hear that we'd hear the music going on outside we'd hear all the worship but we were hidden away feasting on the bread of God saying hallelujah glory to God with this frankincense and this this is so delicious we're in the service of the Lord we're eating the hallowed bread of God that just a regular bread this is special bread nobody keep this bread except us priests how do we have a special calling from God we're the ones feasting on this hallowed bread amen nobody else can eat this just us just us kings and priests unto God hallelujah I'm so glad I'm one of those holy rollers that I'm one of those that get to eat the fresh bread of God ain't a glory I'm thankful by God's grace program said frankincense is our offering of our service to Jehovah so this with the bread of God is anointed with the offering of our service we remember we're in service we come we come to feast on the bread of God now this is the thought now I want to share this thought I shared it a few weeks ago when brother Simon I remember when summer time was here and I made them comment about the twelve loaves of shewbread anybody remember that okay no all right now Church this is what I thought I felt this was a fresh revelation that I believe these twelve loaves of bread represent the twelve New Testament mysteries which brother branham already preached how many knew there was 12 new Testament read everybody know that and we know that we know what the candlesticks were right the candlesticks were the seven churches and Scofield shows us 11 in the mysteries and brother Brandon preaches that and serves as the endtime 1962 but then there's another mystery brother Graham points out an adoption series it's the mystery of the will of God so this is not directly from brother Branham but it just I believe it's a revelation now how many member the church age book brother Branham said whenever God gave a revelation he can always add to it he can add more information to it but all that new information will not contradict anything else how many remember that quote it's like with Jesus birth what was the first prophecy of Jesus birth well he's the boy the child is going to be born the child's gonna be the seed of the woman and he's gonna bruise the head of the serpent I remember that four thousand years before Christ was born you have a prophecy about a seed coming to bruise the head of the serpent a couple thousand years later you another prophecy he's going to come out of the seed of Abraham because God told Abraham I'm gonna use your seed to bless every nation a little yeah a thousand years later you have David talking about how my Holy One will not see corruption amen hallelujah which speaking of the rapture 500 years later Micah says the child Lee born in Bethlehem let me see what I'm talking about as time went on there was more revelation more revelation more revelation the new revelation didn't change the own it just gave us more information and that's what I believe now this is my personal thought that's what I believe this thought is 12 loaves have to mean something and I believe it's the 12 New Testament mysteries now let me ex out of here and see if I got them to review them real quick yeah I can pull them up here real quick boy we got a good internet connection here thank the Lord for that we sure pay for it though that's right here's the 12 mysteries the 12 mysteries the seeds on the four grounds the wheat in the terrace I'm sure now these are Jesus parables here's the twelve mysteries the kingdom of heaven it's lit now these are all called literal mysteries in the New Testament I remember that they're all called literal mysteries the kingdom of heaven about one body of Jews and Gentiles that's Ephesians two that's Matthew 13 the New Testament church of Bride of Christ that's Ephesians 5 the catching away of the rapture that's 1st Corinthians 15 the will of God that's Ephesians 1 9 I just preached this I got all these descriptions memorized the stat the mystery of godliness that's 1st Timothy 3:16 in 2nd Peter chapter 1 the statue per man the seventh Sauvage that's revelation chapter 1 verse 20 the god father Christ that's the Godhead that's Colossians chapter 2 verse 2 the mystery of iniquity that 2nd Thessalonians chapter 2 the mystery of Babylon that's Babylon that's revelation 17 Israel's blindness of the Gentile dispensation that's in Romans 11:25 and Christ in you the hope of glory that's Colossians 1:27 and the church said these are all literally called mystery truths in the Bible they're called New Testament mysteries and isn't it shocking that's why would Simon who got done I was like hallelujah and maybe you guys you know maybe didn't understand what I was this is what I was excited about who planned it which King James Ryder plan to only have 12 New Testament mysteries it wasn't a King James interpreter it was God amen this doesn't take away anything from any Scripture what are we feasting on Church your feast now this is the most important thing you oh I hope you're feasting on is the baptism of the Holy Ghost aren't we feasting on the Godhead are we feasting on the statue ever man aren't we feasting I hope you're feasting on this the rapture of the Bride of Christ these are all loaves of bread that are laid out here that after we know the church ages now we can start feasting on the mysteries of God Oh hallelujah and can everybody say Amen if they understand I'll go a little slower you know what by God's grace I don't wanna say I promise but I'll try to go a little slower about this on Sunday a little bit but that's what was revealed to me I believe now I believe that I'm not saying I'm right but this doesn't take away anything from the Bible it actually makes the Bible make sense well have you ever wondered what those 12 those are for yeah they might be the twelve disciples but what bread are you and I feeding on what twelve pieces of bread with Adam do you and I feed every day in the holy place it's the mysteries of God amen it's the mysteries of God for the this is our bread and then were you have to be a steward over this you have to be an overseer of this and the Bible said we're stewards of the mysteries of God let's go to 1st Corinthians 4 let's go first contains 4 I'll try to close here let me set my timer oh I did already okay all right I got 5 minutes about 5 minutes actually 3 but I'm gonna say 5 there's no way I'm gonna finish this although I'd like to I think I've reached 2 hours on Saturday night I think I've reached 2 and a half on Sunday morning and thank God my voice didn't go out I mean it's just God's mercy they were some long services brother Brooks even had apologized at the end we started 930 weeding out to like 1:00 on Sunday morning and they all stayed Church everybody stayed and prayed or sang or something it was God's mercy that's what he know it's God you know when people are still hungry to hear it after 2 and a half hours I don't mean to do that I just laugh cuz I don't mean to do that it's God taking control me it's God doing that what did I say first contains 4 thank you I just you know I just could tell was God and then the results you know people confess sin and that's got to be God does the devil want us to repent no doesn't ever want us to confess our sins and church I didn't even ask these people to tell me their their deep dark secrets but they're telling me their deep dark secrets I said so at some point I just said okay you have to tell me just tell Jesus you know I don't want to know some of these things I don't want to know but in another way maybe it was God just helping me to feel their pain you know some of these things I don't want to know that I'd really don't but see that's how that's how free the Holy Spirit was the Holy Spirit was flowing so free people are just confessing the confession just rolling off their lips like waves of glory it's just just their confessions just flowing out of their mouth I said hallelujah it's got to be Jesus because Satan hates to be exposed and when someone will freely expose their sin God's moving in get ready Jesus is moving in that anointing is coming back when someone will confess their sins because and hates to be called out but Jesus loves to expose it with the word amen glory first corinthians 4 that's when i can rejoice like i just i was on the plane and fly home just smiling the whole time i'm sitting next to a woman here she's watching her dirty movie or something I'm literally going like this with the music and saying thank you Jesus you know how Lou you know I'm studying and everything I'm sing along with the music you know I just love would I love to see God move you know it's just it's the world to me you know see that God spirits there alright four screens for verse 1 let a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ and look whether we church were stewards of the mystery that means you and I and one others this is begin a preachers but we all have a we all have a part in this what I mean by that is if I preach something wrong then you're all of you are duty-bound to come talk to me about that praise God for the RAM said I don't care for your the janitor he said or trustee if I preach something wrong come come to me in a private meeting see your you have a part in this steward of the mystery the Bible said we are stewards or overseers of the mystery moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful they had to faithfully cook this bread they the faith who faithfully eat it every Saturday faithfully exchange it every Saturday and they had to watch over this to make sure it was a pure table how many believe our table Dacron is pure amen in other words we are feasting on bread that's pure there's no wiggle tails it's not a this ain't a pulpit of vomit this is a pulpit of purity where the word is preached in its purity if it's not you're just as responsible as I because we're stewards of the mystery see in the New Testament all kings and priests men and women we're all spiritual kings and priests right okay I want to show you that and my times up so let me let's stand here I better get you standing let me I'll just read one quote okay from brother Branham and then we'll finish this nor ruling Sunday or maybe Sunday night we'll see I would like to do Christmas again [Music] can I share kind quick share another quick thought real quick is that okay this is from brother Brooks brother Brooks we were talking about the number 12 and he's like member Aaron had the Urim Thummim I remember he wore the yeren thumb I'm all over his breastplate how many over that stone representing one of the tribes how many tribes were there 12 the bread represents 12 tribes and how many know if you ever had a supernatural dream or vision where'd you have to test it yet to test it with the 12 rocks let me say like this if you got some different revelation or if you have some supernatural experience it's got to reflect off the 12 mysteries of the Bible never understand 12 represents the 12 mysteries of God and just as they had 12 stones there if you have a certain dream but it goes against the teaching of the revelation of the Godhead I'm sorry that sounds really sweet but you've got the wrong revelation like a woman now did I tell you this about the make up video I had a woman comment on there and said oh I prayed about your makeup video and God told me I could wear makeup and I said that surely is sweet I want to sound just like brother branham I said that prayers really sounds sweet but it's from the devil that really sounds sweet well I prayed about it and I can commit adultery or I prayed about it and I can steal from God shame on that person but I called her out on it I said that sounds really sweet but that's not what the God of the Bible said if you would have prayed and asked God and if you would have took that voice back to the Bible the Bible said that no woman paints her face and every three although three women that did paint their faces run of the judgments of God that's exactly right that sounds pretty but it's got a flash on the Urim your experience might sound really spiritual I said I said sounds really sweet and spiritual but that wasn't from God because it doesn't flash I get the other revelations we've heard amen Marie so everything that I hear every time you know if someone asks me a question I try to make sure it flashes with those 12 Bible mysteries amen I did something for me when Simon said that I thought hallelujah is there 12 Bible mysteries yes there's 12 Bible mysteries amen okay last thing let me just read this quote this is from identified Christ of all ages he says until you come behind the Badger skin can I find the Badger skin real quick yeah there yeah there it is now you can't see it these are the there's actually outer layer on top of this that looks like badger fur okay or Badgers I think you'd believe is bad your skin so the even and this is where we are we'd be right over on the other side the shewbread is over here the south side this is the south that's the north the south side was the candlestick so when you broke in here you broke me on the Badger skins the first thing you saw was this beautiful light and after that after that was all trimmed then you go to the shewbread on that Sabbath day and eat the Word of God eat the mysteries of God and wrote have said until you come behind this Badger skin he said until you get out of your old skin how many wannabe out of their old skin kori your old thoughts your own Creed's and come into the Friends of God then the word becomes a living reality to you then you're awake into the Shekinah glory and then the Bible becomes a new book hallelujah amen then Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever you're living in his presence eating the shewbread that's only provided that day for believers priests only and we are priests royal priesthood a holy nation peculiar people giving spiritual sacrifices unto God but you must come in behind the veil and see the unveiled God and God has unveiled that's his word made manifest how many thankful they can come behind the badger skins tonight by God's grace oh I'm so thankful I'm so thankful I can come before the message I couldn't come behind the Badger skins I was way out there in the outer court I couldn't even see the light of the church eggs I don't even know there was such a thing as church age I didn't even know there was twelve loaves that we get to feast on every Sabbath amen I was so hungry and that's why I was so hungry for more of God amen that's why I follow this preacher for a while then when I heard a deeper preacher I follow that Pete preacher because I was hungry for bread but only the bread inside the holy place could satisfy you and I a man I knew yeah Amen that's how I was always searching for in a more message more word there's got any more than this and there was I just had to get beyond the badger skin of my denomination oh I'm so glad I broke into it sixteen years ago by God's grace haha I broke into the Badgers get and see the glory of the church ages and now feasting on these twelve Bible mysteries how many love the Lord Jesus amen how many buddy the Bible is a new book to you hallelujah church it really is and we are kings and we are priests and we're giving spiritual sacrifices unto God how many are blessed by the Word of God today I hope you can take this away from you tonight that we've got
