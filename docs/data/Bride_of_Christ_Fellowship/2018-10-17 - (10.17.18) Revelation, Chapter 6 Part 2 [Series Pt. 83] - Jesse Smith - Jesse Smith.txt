few prayer requests tonight by God's grace it's good to be back with you we missed you on Sunday but we had a really nice relaxing weekend by the grace of Lord so thanks for everybody just being okay with me having no time off by God's grace I sure needed it and I was able to focus all my attention on this book I'm almost done with it I've read through so many times but I'm gonna go one more time through it I got three chapters done I got five more to go and we paid an editor I paid an editor from church down in Alabama to edit it I'm going to read through it one more time I'm almost done with that and then I'm gonna set it off to the professional person to get it all formatted for a book so I'm chomping at the bit I'm almost there so but I told Simon I said I need all these services to rest but also to finish up this book I want to get it done by the end of the year so I'm just trusting in God's grace to do that so praise God we had a good time we went to a brother Paul the Fontaine's church on Sunday he wasn't there but then I guess minister there but his dad was there and I got to talk with him a little bit so I had some good fellowship got to see the Graham family that was nice wonderful so we just had a great time in the Lord and as we said sister Connie got healed on Sunday morning so thank the Lord for that praise God but any man said he got the Holy Ghost he called me up and I said brother hey man I heard you had a good prayer time he said brother Jesse I got it that's what he said how the I said Gauri I said I said I preach 17 messages on the Holy Ghost two years ago I said I remember praying and crying at this altar saying God send the Holy Ghost for Jesus Christ's sake I said memmer I know if you remember when I prayed now I said God send the Holy Ghost to Akron for Jesus Christ's sake amen and someone but somebody got it so thank you thank you Lord amen I got to preach 17 more for somebody else I'll do that Amen cuz that's what we want we want to see sons and daughters born in the kingdom of God amen so our trust and I said brother I said write down everything that happened so you can the next time the devil tries to tell you you're not born again you can say God vindicated it and God did so brother for the Holy Ghost all week he's listening to hear you him latter rain sermons and brother Simon preach on hear ye him latter rain mount Mount Transfiguration and for the brother amen said he woke up that morning and said devil I'm getting the Holy Ghost today I'm not leaving Church until I get it so after everybody went out with a man went got Simon prayed for him right here and brother amen said Simon's hand felt like three a hand three three times bigger on his back and he said he said he felt a warm sensation the Holy Ghost he said he'd never felt like that before he says I got it brother Jesse I said so do I amen dori so we're expecting I'm expecting to see a change in his life you know even more so because once you get the Holy Ghost now you got power for service that's my brother BAM said that's what the song says we got power for service Jesus said you'll be a new with power that means clothed with power now you got power to serve me a mint so I thank the Lord for that and I'm just trusting that that will happen for each and every person who desires to be born again praise God hallelujah just announcement this Sunday night at 4 p.m. we'll have communion so that's a good timing and you have the day off right brother all glory amen before I forget there's your Bible brother stuff right forget anybody else needs a Bible let me know if you don't have a Bible let me know and also I have five more acts of the Prophet books if anybody wants one of those so let me know that's how I feel that's my responsibility as pastor to get the Sheep whatever they have need of if you need an mp3 player I'll get you mp3 player need a Bible you need mp3s or whatever need a tablet to listen to message let me know that's my responsibility I need to get the sheep what they have need of so they can serve God so let me know I'm happy to do that by the grace of the Lord I think that's it for announcements to a really important prayer requests the first ones from Jose he said his son is in prison and hasn't had food or water for two days so we really need to cry out to Lord tonight that God would give him grace I'm not sure where he's at he told me a few weeks ago but I forgot but we just need to pray and ask God God knows the situation and God can bring him out God just brought that pastor out of Turkey after 18 months God brought that pastor and that pastor I was watching it last night on Fox News the only little youtube video and his wife saw a vision of his her husband praying for President Trump in the Oval Office and was announcing it beforehand but then he got in prison and then he comes out and he came to the White House to pray and laid his hands on President Trump and said may the Holy Spirit guide this leader now I don't know what's gonna happen like I said I haven't been a big fan of her president or any of the last few presidents but it was striking because his wife had the dream or vision and it came to pass and the man I saw him he laid his hands on and you could see it on the YouTube there he said may the Holy Spirit give this man wisdom and guidance I thought how striking and so if God allowed him in there for a reason perhaps God allowed Jose's son in there for reason to glorify God to do something but let's just pray tonight and believe with all of our hearts the God will bring Jose son out of there and I guess yeah he's really sick I guess he's passing blood and all kinds of things so we really need Jesus Christ to minister tonight to him and we'll lift up him in prayer also this brother from Central America I don't remember which country's from it his name is Emilio his granddaughter has been constipated and I said brother you know how are you doing water and everything and he said yeah he said just something's wrong I don't know what kind of health conditions they have but he said would your church lift up this little girl in prayer who's constipated and having a hard life I said yes our church will lift her up in prayer and believe that Jesus Christ can move I have a little testimony no yesterday I had a headache all day it just got worse I would felt like my head was gonna go out I just told somebody I was just speaking it in the name of Jesus Christ when I got home we were praying and I was speaking I was just quote and I said Jesus help me and by the time I went to bed it was gone I woke up today there was none at all I just want to thank the Lord for that it's the power of calling on his name and I was just saying I was just praying Jesus please that the stripes that you that you receive may that healing that you paid for come upon me and we've been reading through Christ the healer so it's all about divine healing so I thank God for my divine healing praise God so I surely needed that because sometimes in my past church I've had headaches for weeks it's just been two whole weeks at a time they never leave probably cuz I'm not sleeping enough or something like that I drink enough water I want to thank the Lord he gave me mercy last night so thank the Lord Jesus okay anything else I've forgotten is anything else any announcements or prayer requests Haven okay you know let's pray for Benjamin an awesome anyone else Dave another one all right yep was pray for friends where is Karis by the way she's sleeping okay I'm usually expected her prayer requests you know that faithful prayer request amen okay well praise God let's just let's stand for this one let's be sincere as we can hear these two are in desperate need of a touch and I want to get a I want to get her a test ammonia back that something moved that Jesus Christ moved for them tonight we've had that before I remember one time we prayed for SIA on a Sunday night and then just that night she got healed I remember that it was almost like instantly like that God is in our myths God has cleaned out our church you know God's given us a new season we were gonna believe Amen God healed it sister Connie on Sunday God can heal these people tonight by God's grace amen heavenly father father God Creator God loving God merciful God holy God faithful God God of all grace we come to you tonight Lord God we humble ourselves we know it's not in the number of words we say but it's in the sincerity of our hearts and our

the blood of Jesus Christ to cleanse us and make us whole and now high priest in heaven Lord God by your mercy with our sincerest of hearts we pray for these two requests actually for Lord we ask for healing for this granddaughter of Emilio in Jesus Christ's name father I don't know if it's the diet I don't know if it's the temperature but in Jesus Christ's name may you move upon that child's digestive system Lord and give her have give her a need of whatever she has given to her Lord God touch her may we hear testimony may the brother email back and say sometime on Wednesday night the

lose it again so let's go to Revelation chapter 6 like antique continue this series on the book of Revelation and this is part 2 of chapter 6 by God's merciful grace Revelation chapter 6 to teal here let's go to verse 12 revelation 6 for I would like to preach to you on the sixth seal tonight and if we have time at the end I want to add a few current events if not I'll get to them on Sunday by the grace of Lord and also with all the guest preachers we've had a lot of great thoughts and a lot of wonderful things I do too want to just bring some of my thoughts to it like on the thunders and the seals I just kind of a remind the church what I what I am convinced by the scriptures about and also about the bride being awake and Christmas and all those things I kind of want to follow up on those things let you know where I stand on all that so we appreciate all that's been preached but I'm the one that's laboring with you on the shepherd here and I'd like to give you my thoughts on that if you don't know it already so we appreciate all that's been preached like I said it's raised a lot of faith it's brought some wonderful messages I've been so blessed especially by that church age one and last week was so encouraging with brother Nathanael and we're so thankful brother Simon's labor what a what a what a labor in the kingdom of God to cover all those services so we're thankful for God's grace revelation 6:12 I just want to find the last one I preached on trying to find which part this was I don't know if I can find out I was gonna try to look real quick I don't think I'll find it but revelation 6:12 and I beheld and when he had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the Sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she's shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and Island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath is come and who shall be able to stand amen let's bow our heads for word of Prayer if you have a need on your heart why don't you make it known to the Lord here as we approach the Lord here tonight Heavenly Father my hands are raised Lord I have many needs Lord God and I asked Lord by your Holy Spirit you meet my needs nor administer to my soul minister to the souls and the minds and spirits of all the saints here Lord we're gathered in the mighty name of Jesus or we know all things are possible tonight Lord our faith is raised O God our faith is strong in you Lord so speak to us the Lord God continue to teach us the Lord God your word father and I ask God by your grace Lord that your spear would have preeminence here Lord you're the only holy one you're the only worthy one you're the only special one we exalt only you Jesus and father may we feel your presence and be benefited by your sweet spirit in Jesus Christ's name when the church said amen god I should be in C to praise the Lord I told my wife I'm gonna try to preach 45 minutes so I would see if I can do that I got a late night tomorrow night to you know some of these nights Wednesday and sword wear me out you know I have I will be workin 13 hours tomorrow because I have parent-teacher conferences after work so you work a full day then I got conferences all night so I gotta watch my time tonight make sure I don't wear myself out so I want to get sick God knows I don't want to get sick I got too much to do for the kingdom of God to get sick I don't lay around and be sick I'll do something for Jesus with my life I don't do more and more for Jesus amen so let's look at this here the sixth seal which is part of our revelation series chapter 6 we'll look at this part too by God's grace I'm gonna be preaching a lot of quotes here from restraint would that what the Prophet says and I hope you'll be blessed tonight like I said if I have time I want to update you on a few things that are current events here now brother Branham says in the sixth seal he says and he begins by saying notice in the fifth and sixth seal there's no horse riders and there's no announcements and there's no beasts how many recognize that there's no horses and there's no beasts program says that's because the church ages are over and remember those four beasts for is the number of Earth right forced a number of all the deliverance all those fours and so that means the Holy Spirit was no longer ministering to the Gentiles on the earth there's no more fours there's no more beasts there's no more horse riders so in other words there's no more battle all that's going on on the earth is Satan is controlling the earth right during the Tribulation Period now of course Jesus has gone on brother branham said he Jesus will slip down from that marriage supper he'll slip down and reveal himself to the 144,000 amen amen as the Holy Spirit is ministering to them after the two prophets have left the scene so we see that in the sixth seal there's no horse there's no beasts it's just the Tribulation Period and program said it's one of the long seals here notice how many verses it's one two three four five six verses which is interesting the sixth seal has six verses six is the number of fallen man but also the number of anointed man and so program calls it's one of the long seals quite a bit happens praise God and like what brother Branham says here he talks about how the the four powers were riding out they said to remember the whole thing is based upon two things one of them as an antichrist and the other is a Christ praise God and so we know the flying eagle is our Christ anointing for this day right and we know the Antichrist spirit is a pale horse rider today he's riding with spiritual death for the RAM said he'll take one more ride and that's when the mark of the beast is laid down amen when Satan fully comes in the pole brother Ram said he's taking one last ride that's when he lays his marked out upon this I'll say like this God forsaken earth because God is going to forsake the earth for all the times all the years they've forsaken him God is going to forsake the earth and let them cut them under the judgments of God that's exactly right I'm gonna have to see it said see it's either one of the other it's Christ or Antichrist well they have said there's no halfway Christians there's no drunk sober man there's no black white birds there's no sinner Saints you're either a sinner or a saint how many saints do we have here tonight you're either separated unto Jesus Christ as they say or you are still a sinner I'm glad to see that my life is separated in the Christ I'm thankful to see that I'm so soon in the Christ that's Satan's sealed out don't worry amen and then all my time all my free time all my love all my talents all my energy goes for the kingdom of God you're either born again you're not born again you either feel with the Holy Spirit or you're not filled with the Holy Spirit no matter how many sensations you had you ain't filled with the Holy Spirit you're not filled with it if you had been filled with it your life shows it goes right up to it see nobody has to tell anybody about it they see it because it's a seal amen hallelujah think about all the people that we've seen come in here and then say they had it but then fell away or thought they might have had it and then fell away but the whole time everybody can see it on somebody because it's a seal praise God your life is so sealed in a seals a mark and people can see if you're marked with the holy life or you're marked with a gospel life you're marked with a faithful life we should be marked with the power of Christ amen and now he says now these things were studying down the sixth seal is after the church is done gone these things are the Tribulation Period so just a reminder the fifth seal is a seal that takes place in the tribulation and so is the sixth seal the sixty of course is the Tribulation Period because remember in the fifth seals of tribulation seal as well because when the Jews cry out and say Oh have vengeance remember what did Jesus say Jesus says wait little season until your fellow servants your brethren must be killed so that they have to be killed during the tribulation period right 144,000 they'll be sealed in one place brother Branham says they'll give their lives in another place he says there there there spared but it looks like according to the fifth seal that some of them we're gonna have to give their lives I would think so so we know that has to be a tribulation seal after the rapture because Jesus tells them some of your brethren must be killed as well and the six yield now of course is the tribulation rapture program said the Eagle age though our age is coming to reveal and pick up these things and show them he said we find out in last night's service also which was the fish seal the great mystery opened with this seal which was absolutely contrary to my former understanding I was just presuming that it was right and then he talks about how he always thought the souls under the altar were the early Christians he said but we found out when the Lord broke the seal for us it's absolutely impossible it wasn't them for they were gone on to glory plumb on the other side amen so Brennan tells us that that's how it is and so brother Graham gain understanding through these seven seal sermons and remember first John 5:20 says we know that the Son of God has come and has given us an understanding how many know that Jesus is in his son of God stage right now he was in son of man stage when he was on the earth as a prophet preaching and healing the sick but now Jesus is in the Son of God stage praise God hallelujah so right now we're we're offering prayers to the Son of God right and that's what Jesus is have you brought up on the scripture leave it up there Lydia if you can it's because because John says he the son of God has come he's already come and given us an understanding see the Holy Ghost has come and he's given us an understanding now son of man son of man already cave its son of God amen and the Millennium it'll be son of David praise God because they'll sit on the throne in the Millennial temple in Jerusalem and that's the City of David amen and you and I are we right there with him praise God how do you know you're married to the son of David ha hallelujah amen suppose that I gain the understanding and jeez and Paulette or John says the Son of God has come to give us an understanding praise God now we can see it now brother Branham now goes into the sixty I just hit a few of the highlights from the sermon as I've read through it of course and listened to him and listening to it this week now brother Branham says he notices any points out a specific verse notice every rich man is crying out in verse 16 for the mountains to fall on them can you imagine Donald Trump can you imagine Warren Buffett can you imagine Barack Obama these millionaires and Hillary Bill Clinton can you imagine all these millionaires saying rocks fall on us because the wrath of the Lamb is upon us amen that's how scary that's how much terror and wrath is going to be on this world that millionaires will realize there's no money I can't money can't get me away from this I'm going to go hide in a cave to try to get away from the lamb if only they'd realize that they've got a hide in Christ right now praise God that's the only way we're going to ever escape the wrath of God is to hide in Christ now I don't want to hide from him later I want to hide in him right now amen we must hide the Bible said our lives are hid in Jesus Christ wrote in look at these mighty men what have they done they've received the wine of the wrath of fornication of the harlot that's exactly the same class that drank her wine so all those who drink of the Roman Catholic Protestant church system they will receive the wrath of God they'll be the ones hiding in there they'll be the ones hiding in caves see we know we're not going to go hide out engage though we may have a minor type of persecution where the squeeze where it may have some type of persecution or a little persecution but it will be nothing compared to this amen because we have not far taken we don't partake of Catholic doctrine we don't partake of the Church of Christ doctrine or the Lutheran doctrine or the Methodist doctrine we partake of Jesus's doctrine amen but see because they partook of the wine of her fornication now they suffer the consequences and now they'll be in caves hiding out oh my mother have said it's doing these tribulation at the seven trumpets and seven vials and three woes and the woman in the Sun and casting out the devil the red dragon comes between these times during the Great Tribulation Period so I hope you catch his brother hand says as many times the trumpets and vials and woes do not sound until the Great Tribulation Period now that would strike yet if he if you if you know brother Rams clothes because earlier in brother Rams quotes he said the woes were the world wars so sometimes program says the war the woes the world wars but then other times he says the wolves don't take place to the Tribulation Period so what do we need brother Jesse we need the Holy Spirit to give us the truth if there's ever questions about quotes we leave it alone until the Holy Spirit gives us a vindication now I personally believe because I've been reading the scripture and the Holy Spirit's been speaking to me I really believe the woes were not the world wars because brother Brad never says it after the seals and he never majors on it he never causeth us said the Lord I believe all of those have to take place after the 144,000 are sealed and let me show you I go to Revelation chapter 7 because the Bible says it Revelation chapter 7 verse 1 2 3 and after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth and that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree notice that Earth sea tree nothing gets hurt until after the 144,000 are sealed can you say men look at verse 2 and I saw another mighty angel ascending from heaven I'm sorry sending from the east having the seal of the Living God and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of God in their foreheads oh isn't God so merciful amen God doesn't hurt to see the trees or the earth until his children have been sealed by the Holy Ghost that's how much God loves the Jews amen see that God's not going to let those Jews get destroyed that's not gonna let those trumpets blow until after his children are born again amen because look at the first trumpet go to chapter 8 look at the first trumpet in verse 7 8 7 revelation 8:7 this is a to me this is how the Holy Spirit reveals the Word of God to me when brother Branham has you know two quotes that kind of contradict themselves we must but America the Holy Ghost will direct you to the word so sometimes he says the woes went were before sometimes the woes only happened in the tribulation period I believe the Bible plainly tells us the woes only take place during the tribulation period just look at verse 7 or chapter 8 and the first angel sounded that's the trumpet and there Flo followed hail and fire mingled with blood and they were cast upon the earth and the third part of the trees was burnt up and all grass was burnt up remember we read earlier God cannot hurt the trees until after the 144,000 are sealed you see that so to me the Bible has all the answers amen but they've said the Bible is the end of all arguments hey it is for me I hope it is for you amen I'm not taking anyone else's opinion now we take the prophets above everybody else's but every unit of theirs if it got in a reveal - we know it's revealed in the Word of God so just so you know sermon on that the timing of the tribulation next time Lord willing so that's a number that's after the seventh seal which is the day and hour which is the ending of the rapture at the ending of the Gentile dispensation and then shortly after that the trumpet the first trumpet blows and the trees are hurt but of course that has to be after the 144,000 are sealed amen alright next let's keep going here by the grace of the Lord now I want you to remember this brother Branham said he was trying to set up meetings to preach the trumpets in 1964 and he said he went into prayer and the Holy Spirit revealed to him why he couldn't he couldn't get the meat he couldn't he couldn't rent out the facility he couldn't get anything together and he his room he said this I went in to pray and I told the wife I'm going in and sincerely I knelt down before God to pray and he revealed to me seven seal and I've done preached it supernaturally glory see it's the hand of God the whole thing it pertains to Israel and we picked up that under the sixth seal you all have that how the persecution of the Jews so the trumpets didn't pertain anything to the Gentiles so God didn't have brother Branham preached a separate series on the trumpets because it didn't have to do with you and I Oh hallelujah that means we don't have to be on the earth when a third of the trees are destroyed we don't have to be on earth when all the mountains are overflow by water and all the millions of people are drowned and died and the third of the waters will turn to blood we won't have to be on the earth because it doesn't apply to us why because mercy applies to us amen salvation applies to us bloom suffering supplies us why because we believe in the blood of the Son of God amen that's God's grace to us the trumpets remember said God why can't I appreciate you said it don't even apply to the bride don't preach it to the bride you've already preached it under the sixth seal ha ha it's part of the tribulation don't spend your time worrying about that he said just preaching a couple sermons on don't spend your time on that because it don't even pertain to you amen hallelujah thank God for that and God had to reveal that to him glory see all these things were now we're studying right now is is after the church is gone these things in the Tribulation Period and I think it ought to be truly settled in every believers heart that this church never takes a tribulation period amen he says you could not put the church he said you can put the church in there but not the bride see the bride has gone on oh yes but RAM says again he said the bride he said but remember when these things happen in the sixth seal the bride won't be here just remember the bride is gone she don't have to go through any of it this is the time of tribulation or purification of the bride it's put upon her for her to go through it but not the bride he takes his sweetheart out of the way oh I'm glad I'm Jesus's sweetheart amen I know it might not look like it all the time I might not sound like it I certainly don't act like it all the time but because he loves me and forgives me he caused me a sweetheart neither did I treat my wife right all the time sometimes I treat my mistreat my children but at the other day when I we say we're sorry I'm still everybody's sweetheart amen and so are you right in your home and your family so are you the sweet one see because God is a God of forgiveness glory it's exactly right now remember in the church age but brother man tells us the same thing he says how do the church ages Church ages verse comes the seals so those two pertain to the Gentiles after the seal he said out of the seals come forth the trumpets and how the trumpets come the vials and if you know the Bible out of the vials come two woes okay so see brother Ham tells us the order it's Church ages seals that's for the bride then you have trumpets vials woes and that's in of course the church age book by God's grace now let's get back to the sixth seal he said the sixth seal we find out here that nature takes a tumble the earthquake the Sun went black and the moon wouldn't give its light and the stars shook and fail and why everything happens he right at the time of the opening of this sixth seal right after the announcing of those Jewish martyrs the martyrs had had to be finished he says now let go brother and says here he says now see we're right close into that hour now it could be just at any time because the church is just about ready to take its flight but remember when these things happen the bride won't be here just remember the bride's gone she don't have to go through any of it this is the time of tribulation he said on purification on the bride okay I already read that one his sweetheart he's a good sweetheart all the way I'm sorry I had that on there twice my fault amen but you believe that don't you that God is going to keep his bride from the the tribulation go to first Thessalonians 5 I'll just go there real quick Church there's no devil in hell that can tell me that we're gonna have to go through the tribulation period there's no devil in hell because 1st Thessalonians 4 ends with what the rapture the shout voice the trunk now immediately after the shot voice trunk look at chapter 5 verse 1 and remember there was no chapter divisions when Paul but for us to have shorter you know short of things to read look at verse 1 but of the times and the seasons brethren you have no need that I write unto you now what times of what the rapture because you just got done talking about the rapture for you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety so see we know what the world's going to be saying at the time of the rapture they're gonna be saying peace and safety we need more peace on the earth let's get peace in the Middle East they've been saying that for years let's get peace in Syria let's get peace Iraq you know is get peace everywhere then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape but see he's coming as a thief to catch away that's that Greek is the word harpazo which means to snatch away he's gonna snatch away the bride is gonna escape she's gonna be snatched away from the day of wrath glory exactly right that's what the word means harpazo look it up means to snatch away quickly right before destruction right when it seems like it's the very last moment Jesus will take us away hey man I'll remember eating ah knows this yeah verse 4 but ye brethren are not in darkness that the day should overtake you as a thief so see we don't get overtaken as a thief we're not going to be calling Oh what just happened what just happened aren't you glad you know this you know the prophecy I wonder what's become of prophecy is in us because the Spirit of Jesus Christ is the spirit of prophecy or exactly right now look at that verse 4 verse 5 you're all churn of the light and children of the day we are not of the night nor of the darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober a church if you catch this right here are you and I sleeping right now yes or no oh now by the time we use that quote recently about is a right of way down over the whole earth no but let me tell you this bride numbers a Lake Borgne a scripture right there I'm not sleeping I've heard the shout I've risen up I've washed for what my eyes are all the matter I'm spiritually brush my teeth I've trimmed my lamp and I'm going out to meet a bride away no you see and see if we say I know something didn't mean this but if we say the bride's not awake well then brother Graham wasn't awake are you with me if you're born again you have to be away but what excited means that we all know it's not the latter rain yet because we know the latter rain will be rapture abate and we go the third bowl of food greater at the time of the latter rain but this is worse I'm speaking right now is big and God is moving in the third pole or I spoken two things the last two months and those words did it fall to the ground God let those words come to pass I'm not sleeping on Jesus he woke me up so I don't have to sleep I don't want to sleep I don't want to be stagnant I don't want to be lost I want to be a child of the king I'm not a night crawler I'm a child of the day I'm not a nocturnal person sleeping on Jesus well let everybody else do the work then everybody else work well I sleep I'm working in the very front line to the oh we should be on the front lines of the kingdom does everybody understand that quote we got to be careful with the quote about the brides on the way gasohol she's not the latter rain hasn't fallen all these things but there are remembers who are awake today that are not sleeping on Jesus amen I hope you understand by God's grace because what is this Paul say are this Paul say all those Christians are sleeping or some of them awake he said they're awake he said you are not of them who sleep look at that see verse 5 he said yeah verse 7 for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken the night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love how many got faith in love on is your heart or your breast is your heart covered with faith and love absolutely I've got we got faith in Jesus Christ we got the love of Jesus Christ thank you and for an helmet the hope of salvation I know I'm saved the devil can't tell me no different the devil can't hurt my head brother Aaron the devil can't hurt my head because I got a helmet on it protects my head I know I'm saved I know he saved a wretch like me I know I was the prodigal I remember when I left that Pigpen and I remember when the father ran to meet me praise God and I remember when he put that seal of the Ring of the Holy Ghost on my finger hallelujah I've got the power I've got the seal the Holy Ghost I've got much out of the cake I'm dressed in His Holiness not my holiness hey man I'm not sleeping in the Pigpen wondered Who am I in this world am i a Christian or a mine devil I'm a Holy Ghost filled Saint amen my life is separated under Jesus Christ my whole life is pastoring this church preaching the gospel and pointing everyone I know that we'll listen to Jesus Christ not everybody will listen but some people will and the Bible said have compassion on some not all you can't have compassion on everybody you can't stop it and help every homeless person you can't make everybody you can't invite every friend of church but you can come have compassion on some making a difference in their lives ha ha all right but we want to help the homeless I like how you have the whole Exia we want to help the homeless but we can't help every homeless person but we can have a compassion on some to make a difference amen you see church we got to have on we got to be awake I'm not sleeping on Jesus I'm looking for the rapture praise God who are 2 verse 4 God hath not appointed us to the Tribulation Period or wrath because that's the day of his wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ see God's appointing some people he knows he knows what their heart conditions are so he appoints some to the rapture I point these people are Jews they're 144,000 he said these are church members he's a Buddhist version these are worldly these are just you know Pharaoh's these are just Judas's all these things but he appointed you to be awake in this hour and you to escape the wrath of God hey man he appointed you that means if he appointed you you got something new for God praise the Lord Oh so does that help your hearts a little bit tonight does that help right after the wrath your passage Paul says you're not going to be surprised when the tribulation comes you're gonna be gone you're not you're not a boy to wrap oh what's happening all this destruction I was too busy watching my movies there I was too busy getting drunk I didn't know what's gonna happen only drunk I'm getting is the Holy Ghost rum love the Lord and worship God and give Him praise and cry form and shout to him and see do and dance form whatever he gonna do oh the kind of drunk hey but see we're not sleeping on Jesus he woke us up he said turn your hearts back to the Pentecostal fathers what was that I said turn your hearts back to the pedak wake up Jesse okay put on the breastplate of faith and love I'll put it on I got the breastplate of faith and love huh put on the helmet of salvation I'm gonna mess up my hair don't walk around here with my madam I even say I'm a foolish virgin I'm a Judas nonsense I'm a blood wash Saint I'm a child of the King hey man like I said before the devil knows what kind of life I live he knows how we fast and pray and seek God and preaches word and live his word and do everything we can to please the Heavenly Father we stay a million miles away from any any temptations with money or women or pride or popularity we stay a million miles away from that and we just clean humbly to Jesus Christ I'm gonna cherish that old rugged cross and at the end I'll exchange of her crown that's right yeah next I wasn't really praying on preaching this that was a blessing praise God now let's go further now here a little bit further now brother have said I want to do something different I got let's see I got twenty minutes here okay let's just let's go through this next thought and now I want to close with some end time events to kind of help you see where prophecy is that okay now brother Adam says he sees at paragraph 138 in this sermon so it's this is a three-and-a-half hour sermon I think for three hours from Miranda I thought I'd be a little good to give the class a little something different tonight because it might be tiring just listening to me talking all the time so here's what he does he says now the lamb has the book in his hand and he's gonna break it he said let's look to Matthew 24 the lamb himself speaking but of AMSA I want you to hold your book like this so get your Bible and romancin hold it like this so he must mean this it's your Bible on Revelation six and then Matthew 24 he says hold your Bible like this so the only possible thing I think he could be doing is something like this hold your Bible like this you got it so we're gonna be flipping back and forth so brother Adam it says hold your Bible like that Matthew 24 in revelation 6 and program takes the beginning of this sermon to show how the sixth seal is the tribulation seal and program said every scholar knows the sixth seal is taught by Jesus in Matthew 24 let me understand that by God's grace the RAM said every scholar every person knows that he says so he said Jesus was giving the symbol form in Revelation six what what he said over here in the word in Matthew 24 so revelation 6 and Matthew 24 go to this both on the Tribulation Period and program cause the sixth seal the judgment seal now he calls that the judgment or the tribulation seal but judgment seal all right now we're not gonna read it but in Matthew 24 verses one through three the disciples asked Jesus three questions the first when will one stone not be left upon another and Jesus told them that was when Titus came he said when you see when you hear it about Titus and the armies coming he said don't go back for anything he said run to the mountains remember that what should there be the sign of that coming and that was of course the six seals are right here in Chapter four now those were the signs of his coming to six seals and what shall be the sign of the end of the world and of course that's all the tribulation things in the sixth seal that's the end of the world okay so whether Adam says oh it's so beautiful said the what would you like a revelation so brother forehead of boundless revelation and it got him excited that the sixth seal is in Matthew 24 hopefully you shake yourself up a little not bit tonight and get a little more excited because it's stimulated brother Branham now the first seal is taught in Matthew 24 five and six okay who can read now who can read five and six for me I'm sorry no it's Matthew 24 four and five am i read verses 4 and 5 for me Aaron can read 24 4 and 5 and jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many all right now brother Graham said this is exactly the first seal because the Bible said in chapter 6 I saw a white horse and he that sat I want on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer so matthew 24:4 5 talks about a deceiving man which which a horse rider was the most deceiving the white horse rider because he's copying Jesus as the white horse rider and the church said you see that so go Rams he gets excited said my the first seal is Matthew 24 4 and 5 amen now I said that he's Antichrist he said there's your first seal he says now the second seal is in rebel or Matthew 24 verse 6 so Lydia can you read Matt 24 verse 6 and mauka have you read the next one in that perfect then if you read the the second seal verses 3 and 4 revelation 6 numbers a red horse rider and he says power was given to him and sat thereon to take peace from the earth and they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword on the church said amen so matthew 24:6 is the second seal because it's all about war it went from white deception deceiving saying i'm the christ worthy anointed it went from white to a bloody red and so the sixth seal I'm sorry the chapter 6 is all here revelation 6 is also in Matthew 24 as well amen now the third and fourth seal are in the same scriptures if you if you notice there in verses 7 and 8 okay so the famines refer to the third seal in Matthew 4 7 and then the pestilences refer to the fourth seal which is death ok so the program teaches us the third and four seals are in Matthew 24:7 and verse 8 - liddie can you put 7 up here ok her nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famines not famines right there that's the third seal because remember he had a balance in his hand a penny of wheat for a barley right four measure barley and we know all the families that took place during the dark ages right I mean familiar with that I could pull it up in history all you have to go just for the encyclopedia all the famines and the potato famine all those who you probably remember those families but after this comma now comes the fourth one here the fourth because pestilences and earthquakes in diverse places so now we have pestilence in our day and earthquakes in our day right how many times do i turn on Google News and it's like all there's 48 there's 48 earth in the last three weeks or something like that there's earthquakes and pestilences and people remember the Horn of Africa from our each other some years ago the Horn of Africa is under constant pestilences not having enough food and then the pestilences of insects all these things so brother ham says the third and four seal are in verses 7 and 8 verse 8 says all these are the beginning of Sorrows now what's that remind you of church birth pains right the real the real birth pains are going to be under the tribulation period because that's going to bring forth a new day right this is these are just the beginning the things we've seen the famines the pestilence is and the earthquakes the things we've seen those are just the beginning of Sorrows those are not truly the birth pains all right now the fifth seal program says is matthew 24:9 2:13 salary then and then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you should be hated of all nations for my name's sake now that's actually in the scripture too the Bible says that all nations are going to gather against Israel during the Tribulation Period I appreciate before I don't have to memorize but the Bible says all nations will come against Israel and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another and many false prophets shall rise and to see many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved amen so buh-bam reads that and he says see they would we're on the fifth seal now that was the other night they would deliver you up but try one another and so forth right so that is the fifth seal now the sixth seal let's get to this one here is verses 12 to 17 okay I guess brother Ram did it I'm sorry no it's verses 29 to 30 I'm sorry yeah it's Matthew 24:29 to 30 so there's big gap he stops at at verse 13 and verse 14 all the way to 28 there's a gap and so off to preach on those separately those must be to the Gentiles and that must be Titus as well we go to verse 29 brother Ram now I goes to 29 mother ham says verses 29 and 30 are the sixth seal let's see if they're not immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the Sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light is that sound familiar and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers the heavens shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory amen glory that's not the six see I don't know what is it talks about the Sun being black and the stars falling the earth shaking that's exactly the sixth seal and it took a prophet to catch that a man hallelujah now remember I'll finish with this because I got about seven more minutes but I'll probably go a little bit further than that remember brother Han says notice Jesus doesn't say anything about rapture symbols in chapter 24 why because there are no symbols because if Satan you get a hold of those symbols of ramesses he can do some damage with it you can try to see people and get them up get them deceived and going after different things like that so Jesus didn't give any symbols but brother Graham tells us that we that God gave him the revelation of the seventh seal he said it was the day in the hour of Christ's coming hey no man knows the day or the hour except the father hallelujah so there's no symbols also there's it's unknown you've just got to be ready hey man you just got to love Jesus now and not want to wait for a fire escape to get out of hell I don't want a fire escape out of hell I want a highway to heaven amen some people just want a fire escape to quickly slide down out of hell other tribulation I don't want to slide down I want to walk up like Enoch Laurie I guess we gotta walk up day by day not just a quick walk Enoch walked with God the Bible said Oh Graham said he walk with God so much that one day God said would you just like to come home with me tonight thank you brother you know quite a hold of daughter's life I gotta take a walk with the Lord but I'll see you in the rapture is my own interpretation for our day amen at some point we might have to tell the knowers of this day I'll see you sometime I won't see in the rapture but I'll see you at the white throne judgment glory by God's grace because we have to make sure we walk with the word we if the people other people don't walk with the word that's fine we're not gonna answer for them we've just got to answer for us in our church we've got to answer for ourselves and we've got to walk with the word that's why every night God lets you go home you leave your friends your co-workers your buddies your church members you leave all those and you've got to stare one person to face yourself because you're the one that's not an answer on the day of judgment now you have this it's not giving you mouth or you and dad are you and your best buddies saying there is going to be you and Jesus only and you gotta look yourself in the mirror every night say Who am I following what am i mine making myself ready for the coming of Jesus Christ am I excited about the coming is my life worthy of the gospel and you got to answer and say if it's not lord help me to be worthy of the gospel or if you are worthy say lord help me to stay where they keep me pure from all the ideas of man keep my mind only on the Word of God glory now will you bear with me here let me give you a few modern events here okay I'm give you a mean you do a few modern events here I want to start where to then I want to show you a video here it is I told you can we hook this up oh goodness that's alright brother take a good yarn shake yourself yeah that's right brother amen hey sometimes I get tired too I understand I told you months ago article 1 besides the Pope said to admit being part of the problem of covering up clergy sexual abuse and chili this was I didn't have the date on here okay here's where I told you Church I wasn't making this up where is it oh here it is look at that three dead all those a andis lorry load one of the accusers so the Pope went met with some accusers who were saying we were abused and chilly by all these priests so the Pope met with them in a private meeting and these are what the men came back and told the Los Angeles Times one of the accusers said he saw shift and Francis's attitude when the Pope told him that abuse is not a sin but corruption now I told you that and the Bible says that church is full of every unclean and hateful spirit hey I told you it's right there it's in loss this is Los Angeles Times I told you this is not something I made up and you see it today they released the names in the state of Washington on my wife on the article well I think I got a right here yeah Washington Catholic Archdiocese names 31 priests credibly accused of sexual abuse so just today 31 names of priests were listed publicly and I think the list witness of a thousand children that had been molested and that was just from the 40s to the 96 I think was 96 was that right what about all these people's sins so see I don't know how this is I don't know how it's gonna work remember these Protestants are going to unite and they're they're thinking it's going to be a good thing and they're thinking they're not going to unite to the Roman Catholic Church but eventually because of finances they're going to bow and then the the Pope will become the head of this organization this world council of churches but see there's no Wigan there's gonna be no excuse on the day of judgment a tree is known by its fruit everybody has an accusation against me doing anything evil you better come in private you better bring two or three lettuces but I stood here all these 12 years I'll take an accusation after accusation and God has honored my life as being pure but not this church not this church this is the cage of unclean and hateful bird stay a million miles away from this I just want to show you that by God's grace is ever ever understand now I'm gonna switch over here let me pull something up here I I want to show you this brother Simon mention this this sermon I'll switch over in just a minute here buddy hold on uh uh sorry not buddy Lydia darling darling and I don't know if you saw this or not now this is a woman preacher this is the only time you're gonna hear a woman preacher in our church because I'm an exposed to relies now what I believe is lies I could be wrong but this is what brother Simon mentioned here's a woman its prophesy and let me pull it up here yeah let me switch over now Lydia here I want you to hear it from their own lips because I but Simon mentioned a couple of times anyone remember mention brother Simon mentioning this this woman preached a whole hour that's good that's good so she preaches a whole hour on the life of William Branham at some conference where it's a prophetic conference but I want to bring out some of the things that she says that are wrong and I want to just follow up on this so she's talking about the life of other random at the 46 minute mark so I'll skip ahead here after studying on William Branham she said the the Lord told her to go to youtube for a prophecy and the very first one was supposedly by of the organ player brother Branham that talked to brother Branham right before his death so again she's she's bringing this testimony of a man who said he knew brother branham but this is not on tape that's why it's so important that we only put confidence in with what's on the tape everyone understand because there's like a hundred people out there that knew brother Brennan they have all these revelations these special revelations but you never hear about it on the date so we got to be very careful how many want to be careful so this brother then now tell you that you know I can shock and share the video with you too this brother who said he was the organ player he said another season is coming he said this is what brother Graham told him God is going to take every move in history and put it all together in one Holy Spirit bomb now that doesn't sound like Bertram's language and he said he said that brother Graham told him that he's gonna drop this bomb a Holy Spirit bomb on the earth and primetime news will cover limbs coming back they will come to open fields all across America he said they will not beat or so they will not talk about the future they will create the future and then this woman goes on to say this let me say yeah let me go to the 51 she says that the the next revival will have greater works than what Jesus did and that's where I knew she was wrong brother Branham said you cannot do greater works than Jesus Christ never understand so she's taking this with a teaching on brother Branham I met programs organ player and he told me that program told this prophecy that the bride she doesn't call it bride she just calls it revival the bride is gonna have greater works than Jesus and brother have said you can't do greater works than Jesus so see what it's giving the people it's giving them a false hope it's prophesied falsely are you with me and we are supposed to accuse those who prophesy falsely say they're wrong it's not popular it's not fun but we have to do it so let me go to it it's been t1 mark there we go hopefully our Internet's up pretty good that we can do okay then when william branham walked the earth and way of brandon had the greatest ministry since jesus christ when he walked the earth and he's saying that the latter rain is going to be greater than the former rain and in that will be greater works than we saw when Jesus was on the earth right there that's a lie that's a lie you can't do who's gonna who's gonna how can you do any greater than creating fish and bread who can do anything more than that see the lies are there so once there's one line it you know there's more lies in it it's trying to produce and see they're tying in all these things we believe in the latter rain we believe in the former rain we believe in all these things we'll see how Satan it's gonna be so close it's not possible you can't do greater works than Jesus Christ because He is God you can't be greater than God and then she said this revival is gonna come out of Texas from their churches and she said it's gonna be greater than all the other revivals combined and she said it's gonna happen in 2018 so I'm watching now I see all their videos they would put out every week and I'm watching at the ends of them to see if there's a great revival because if not what was it it was alive from the pit of hell everybody almost all the churches do that well this year is gonna be the revival or this year is gonna be that this year this year and they don't even know they're there rocking the people to sleep oh my they're being rocked to sleep over he will get up wake up wake up you don't know the year you don't know the day or the hour you don't know you gotta be ready all the time you've got to love Jesus Christ all the time fears not going to get you you love Jesus so much you hate the simple things of the world that's gonna get you in the rapture amen can you believe this I just shocked she said a billion they're gonna save a billion souls that's what they said I'm trying to find the times I wrote down the times on here she says that God's profits are going to be raised up in the area of entertainment like God wants anything to do with entertainment God is not God cares a lick about Hollywood bunch of devils in there bunch of prostitutes is that right and whoremongers have these evil dirty filthy nonsense God don't want to entertain anybody you got a worship Jesus entertain the Lord oh my I feel like a little righteous evening nation I guess tonight cuz I don't I'm not asleep I'm awake in Jesus Christ this ain't gonna fool me this ain't fooling Simon this ain't fooling none of us we see them through all through that because Satan can mother have said Satan cannot preach a sermon that's word by word all the word in other words you're gonna find one thing at least one thing wrong [Music] it's gonna be all with the word not false prophecy not lies now you might mix up with Scripture but that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about when you're speaking for God everything is gonna be right yeah hallelujah under the inspiration everything will be right because I'm not you speaking it's God speaking hallelujah now skip ahead she says she says their revival coming out of Texas is gonna be 90 set 90% better than the day of Pentecost she says Pentecost I'm sorry the 1946 revival was the tithe of the rest of the revival so 1946 brother Rams ministry was only a tenth of what God was gonna do so we're gonna have nine times more than what for the brand of head I'm sorry Jesus said very few be the plan and then she said their move is gonna save 1 billion people let me skip add to that I'm so it's only 8:30 good all right let me skip ahead here this is that 56 there we go she's got paint on her face and all kinds of things it's not like this isn't hockey is it never gonna happen I'm just gonna go about building my own house I feel like the Lord is saying come back come back it's time it's time it's beautiful said any two years ago is about to be revisited on us and to be poured out and so he's saying to us get your lives right get yourselves right before me get rid of offense get rid of unforgiveness get rid of the things get rid of the judgment get rid of the things that will hindering us from walking in this kind of glory in this kind of truth there's an earth out there waiting for you to take dominion its groaning for the sons of God to rise up romo certain power because on the heels of this great providers is going to come some pretty horrible things but God is bringing in the greatest harvest that the world has ever seen over a billion souls will come into his kingdom a billion souls a billion souls there's only seven billion on the earth so a seventh of the world is gonna be saved jesus said very few will find this can you imagine it imagine having the adult audacity to lie and to say that out of your church is gonna spring forth a revival we're a billion souls are gonna be saved and then say you're do greater works than Jesus Christ Oh Satan's a slick liar isn't he he's slick and let them paint their faces and talk about being consecrated when they can't even wipe their face with one of those you know the hotels have those makeup wipes I wonder how many that she's passed by should have wipe your face off in those men - they do the same thing to get on the camera they paint all themselves up with JFK did that that's why he they say he won the election cuz he painted his face did you know that that's what they say he looks more healthy than Richard Nixon so he won the election Oh nonsense see they talk all the talk but there's no substance they talk about revival but there's not even cleaning out their own house to live right obey the Bible preach about William Branham but don't do what William Branham says we'll see we that's the difference between us we preach about William Branham and we do what he says hey man that's the difference between us hallelujah we just don't recognize a prophet we obey the Prophet now I missed the part where it says we can stand our feet we missed the part where it said about the 90% she says it was the tithing and there's that if you want the testimony there's the man supposedly that was the organ player for brother Branham and talks about this prophecy but that's not a real process I don't believe that was a real prophecy okay hope that's okay now please don't be stumbled that I played a woman preacher I played other things like that before just so you can see what kind of world we're living in and at the end she'll go down there and she'll say who come up here who wants to be pray for revival and you'll pray for me huh anointed with oil do all these who's really getting a revive you know the Bible says that they in the the the false prophets now she's already falsely prophesy right can every see that a billion souls will come out of their revival but the Bible says they'll promise them things they can never attain to that's what the scripture says let me pull it up real quick I want you to show that to you because when simon talked about that he shared it with me and i want you to see and this is now this is what brother simon thought which I thought was a good thought it shows that there are looks like some foolish versions who are trying to get the oil now know how sincere they are but at least they're talking about getting the oil does everybody see that they want the latter rain they want the oil but if they don't get the former rain they're not getting the latter rain amen what's the former eight the former rain is the teaching rain the teaching of brother Branham that God gave to it which is women don't preach women don't paint their face men no painter grace a real man doesn't let his wife preach and then she has pants on her other sermons you know hood you see that so it's showing us there is some kind of cost so move out there that once that oil that we've got to make sure we've got it brother Branham preached that he said he even in programs day he believed they were trying to get the oil but that did not stop brother Brad from preaching about the Holy Ghost and inviting people to get the oil Gordon he still do prayer lives he still bring him up to pray for the Holy Ghost and tell them to go in the room even though he thought they were seeking the Holy Ghost the booze version was he still encouraged the wise to get the oil it's exactly right so a lot ahead I'll keep doing the same thing if you're not burned again you better get burned again amen even if they're searching out and they don't feel there or they would need they're searching out this oil we can get the oil praise God there's no reason we shouldn't I think it about hanging the Bible says they promise them Liberty that's right Thank You Holy Spirit they promise them Liberty but they themselves are the servants of corruption there it is all right let's say praising already praise them oh there it is the Holy Spirit brought the words back to me in 2nd Peter 2:19 he's talking about Balaam and all these sinners sang it to me I'm sorry 2nd Peter 2:19 while they promise them Liberty is that what she's doing promise of all this Liberty and where we God's service will be the true church they themselves are the servants of corruption you know what sermon series that's right the wealth the wealth of the kingdom preaching out money all the money of the kingdom and then all the all the spiritual wealth - don't you see Church they want the prosperity of money that goes along with being Germany most last time you heard a sermon preached like that here the wealth of the message I condemn money and then people get mad at me and leave right I condemn people that like being richer i condemn all that and people get upset with me leave well praise the Lord that's that's that's fine with me that's fine with me see they promise them Liberty they make all these promises you're gonna save a billion souls you're gonna do all this come on church your ministry is going to be 90% more effective than will you bring that's what she's saying 90% more powerful than William Branham nonsense I just want one percent of his power I'll take whatever I can get lord I just want the same only goes because I know I preach the same worse I've seen some of the results in praise God oh ma thank God church for eyes that can see thank God for the ice out of the Holy Spirit in this hour we're not deceived by things like this all speak in tongues and let's get in our prayer language and speak in tongues and then you'll get then you'll get it now you might speak in tongues that's wonderful I know sister Naomi does thank God for her she's such an encouragement that she speaks in tongues because I never I've asked God to left me and he doesn't but maybe one day you will but I'm talking about how they push it as the evidence oh you'll get you talking tongues and then we'll get the latter rate then we'll save a billion souls and then we'll be in Hollywood who cares of looking about Hollywood I know what Hollywood we want wormwood to come amen and clean this off this earth off so that we can step upon the ashes and walk out with Jesus into the Millenium praise God that's only what I'm looking forward to is the purple hood hate to say like that but if you can't make people to repent what's God got to do he's got to wipe it clean they will repent they won't come to church they won't listen the Word of God they won't obey that God have your way and help us just to be pure before the Lord see what they do Church they make all these promises but they need themselves on the servants of corruption let me get my britches on and paint on before I come to preach this morning come on let me get a BMW so I wonder what the cars they drive off they look that up next what's their income from the church form hula man is overcome of the same is he brought in bondage and when a man or woman submits to the Jezebel spirit then they take on all the part then they are partakers with Jezebel because God said come out of her my people that you be not partakers so all these people that don't leave that church and come out against it they're partakers and they're guilty because they're not speaking against it and so are we if we're guilty we see sin if we see sin and don't speak against it we're guilty how many can say amen to that you see me in sin don't let me continue and said you need me afterwards with two or three witnesses or will man the manor or sister will bring my wife in there and we'll get into cleanup because there's no reason for us to walk and said when we have every promise that we need for life and godliness we can't say well God you didn't give me enough spiritual help here Orlando see yeah I'm driving out here I'm barely gonna live it the Bible said he gave us every promise we need to live godly on this earth hey man but maokai won't you come here I better stop there I'm pretty slow longer than by 45 minutes praise God or you love the Lord tonight I want to update you on the Catholic Church on an update you on this looks like a foolish virgin movement and so you know all it takes is the Holy Ghost inside you to listen this and you'll catch that ah as soon as I caught that over there and I did not remember I towards that I said soon as I listened I caught that huh you can't do greater than Jesus Christ who's gonna say I've done greater who's gonna go to heaven same with Jesus nice to meet you I did a greater miracle than you sir oh that's blasphemy Lord Jesus a greater works than these shall you do that meant more works there'll be more miracles thank God for the miracles in our church praise God all right recently thank God for that but it's just more because we have more time and we have more people in our church than just their twelve disciples remember when Jesus said that there was only 12 he was 13 and then there was no 70 that's all there was and she is a greater works than these show you do as I go to my decide what nervous I go to my father he was talking about the number of miracles praise God there's one thing I want to be that's a Holy Ghost feel witness who's faithful to the Word of God cuz I know if I've got the Holy Ghost I've got a ticket to escape the sixth seal praise God amen that was my last point I want to wrote that down I said we preached on the sixth seal miss it make sure you miss the sixth seal you should on the revelation the sixth seal but make sure you miss it and you will miss the sixth seal if you get the Holy Ghost seal praise glory that's what I'm afraid before I said you Lord please send the Holy Ghost to Akron through Jesus Christ's sake the people might be failed and miss the wrath of God get the oil get your lap trim wake up serve God be a children of the light not children of the darkness
