praise god [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] let's go [Music] and [Music] happy birthday [Music] uh [Music] me [Music] is thank you lord praise the lord amen are you free this evening amen thank you musicians man it sounds so good in there this blesses my soul amen if you would turn with me in the first corinthians uh chapter eight and this is something that my family's already heard me speak on and i don't know if johnny and sarah got to hear it or not but so my apologies if it's a repeat but uh that song brother amen started singing i don't even know what song it was it was another new song for me you know i think it's in psalms it says sing a new song unto the lord every time i come here i hear a new song and there are several several new ones that i've heard today but uh just thank the lord for his grace amen um but when he started singing that i i couldn't help but just start crying back there because it just led right into what i was saying this morning just leaned right into into the message so i just appreciate it and uh god bless you all i hope this is a blessing to you uh first corinthians chapter eight and verse 2. it says that if any man think that he knoweth anything he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know you know god humbled kings for thinking that they were something and if he would humble kings how much more you and i right there no god is no respecter of persons yes man so we can expect the same thing um so let's look to the lord in prayer most gracious heavenly father we just thank you for again everything that you do for us lord we can never it might seem redundant to some people but we can never thank you enough for what you've done for us but just the grace that you've extended to us when we're so undeserving you know lord just let you an unending love and it's an amazing grace oh god we just thank you for that and just these songs that we try to sing to to sing an honor to you and to give you praise and to uh give you glory and just the best that we can to express how we feel for what you've done for us oh god and uh lord as we get into the message this evening i just pray that you would help me minister to your people i pray that it's a blessing to them and uh lord i just want to lift your name on high and uh just give you praise and i just want to talk about you tonight i just pray that you would help me do that and maybe rejoice in your word in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen you may be seated thank you as we read in first corinthians if any man think he knoweth anything he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know and this scripture really hits home to me um you all don't know who he was uh there's only i think brother johnny might have did you know brother gayle keller for the polls then but when i was i just came uh i just i was just born again just gave my heart to the lord and uh i started hanging around him a little bit more i got closer to him and he's he was one of those old soldiers you know and uh just to enjoy sitting and talking to him before he has he had so much wisdom and that was one thing that he said uh several times you know if somebody of that caliber with that much wisdom repeats something it's it's worth remembering and uh so i i think this has helped me a lot uh with my walk with christ anyways uh to keep me humble and you know just to how to treat people so you know uh and try to keep a a good spirit you know because we we might do uh some good things uh here and there uh but we sure don't want to brag about it you know so we tend to think more of ourselves as as uh people to to be more than what we ought to think uh we have some good days where we feel that we're on top of the world and uh we might have had the best game of our lives we may have scored more points in a game or or won more consec consecutive games and than anyone else you know they have the olympics out there that that they try to win medals and when you win the gold medal you kind of have bragging rights as they say but uh that's not something we don't strive we don't walk uh to attain a a worldly metal a thing of this an earthly metal but we but we strive to uh continue to earn the uh heavenly reward amen so uh that's that's why we have to put our whole heart into it you know an olympian uh when they're when they're training their their training they put their whole heart into it they put their whole lives into it they're dedicated to it they're focused on it and and they they sacrificed just so they could become the best person so they can win that gold medal but we're not striving to be the best we're just like brother like we uh read this morning where brother bannon said that the people were separating because one was saying oh he's coming on a white cloud oh no he's coming on a white horse what does it matter how he's coming as long as he's coming and we ought to be ready for that so it's it's it's not it's not who's the best it's helping one another alone to to meet the same you know it's a prize worth fighting for amen amen oh so we and what they what we do as people what the olympians do is they they break uh other people's records that have been set uh over the course of however long they've been doing olympics i think they even had it back in in the uh the roman empire they had the olympics and stuff so uh people will still strive these olympians strive their focus is to beat the other person's record not just to win the medal but they're there to try to break records to be the fastest uh the be the highest jumper the best swordsman whatev whatever it might be they're always trying to break a record uh so when we have those good days if if we were to break somebody's record we uh we we think of ourselves ha ha i'm somebody i broke that record you know i'm the best there is people are just going to praise me because i'm so so good well well guess what there's always going to be somebody that's uh they're going to come out on their best day and and break a record uh so what lake did they have to stand on so to speak that that they could sit there and brag about being the best when somebody else can come right along and and beat that same record uh we tend to brag about how good looking we might be uh some people just spend so much time in the mirror and you know spend a couple times a couple hours you know just getting ready and i'm talking guys some some girls might take a little bit longer in a couple hours but you know guys sitting in the mirror a little too long that's a little vain but you know uh because they're just trying to make themselves look so good and for what you know just to make all the girls say oh he's so cute yeah and uh he's the cutest of the bunch and and the girls well i'm the prettiest one that they ever did see you know something like that so you know what what what are we doing that for but there's going to be some day they have these beauty pageants uh in our country and and i think even miss universe they they even have those so it's a world uh worldwide thing a modeling of who the prettiest woman and just like i said i was talking this morning it's the way that you don't really see men out there modeling like like the women like the women do i mean they have their their muscle things you know the strongest man and you know that well i don't want to get too much into that but they've got their competitions too so all along the lines uh people are trying to be better than the other one so and and that's why i'm coming out with this scripture this evening that if any man think he knoweth anything he knows nothing as yet as he ought to know uh kind of getting back onto the the beauty thing just like the records when when records are set they're only there for a little bit just like beauty that's only there for a little bit too because but what happens it's it's a progressive degradation or also known as age every day we get a little bit older and beauty can fade away for the most part on the on the outside you take a teenager or a young 20 year old woman at the prime of her life she might be the most beautiful at that point in time but by the time she hits 50 60 she doesn't look like what she did at 20 years old because of the stress of the world that comes and different things happen in people's lives and and uh that i've kind of talked about this to my wife that you know i see some of my peers that uh i graduated with and somehow by god's grace it just seems like we're holding our our youth a little bit better than some you know i'm not trying to i'm just saying that uh you could see because it could be struggles of life that have come across the people that uh it just looks like they've had a real hard go uh so all that all that is vain when you're so concentrated on the outside beauty because it's the inside it's the inward man that we should be working on more than the outward uh so we want to uh we want to leave a legacy of the the inside man that's why uh i think now when samuel went to go uh anoint david what did he say look not on the outward appearance but it's but god looks on the inside uh so that's what we want to work on and that's that's what we want to concentrate on is that inside man now we might tend to uh brag about how good of a job we do where everyone depends on you and you've had so much training you've had so much experience and that's why you get paid the most and you know i've i've heard people brag about stuff like that you know well okay you've been here longer you know do you wanna want us all to clap and cheer and you know uh that i just don't know what some people's uh motive is behind that to to just stand there and brag about uh something like that and that just seems so trivial but everybody has something that they uh that they're proud of you know and it's okay to be proud of an accomplishment because it helps you to work harder to make it to accomplish uh something else you know we don't want to be just just satisfied like we were talking this morning we don't want to just get so far and be satisfied and not continue on we want to continue on oh we tend to uh yeah we tend to brag about our cars right our vehicles or bicycle or our way of travel uh i remember hot rods were a big thing back when i was younger i was yeah my brother was into it so it kind of influenced me to you know be into the cars and i knew some here and there but uh and just to hear the the nice roaring you know the of the muscle cars just a uh just a rumble that it made it was it was just something wonderful it was just great to hear i don't know why but men just like that women like it too but i think there's more men that like that than the women do but but i i'm going to brag about my about my vehicles i've got a i've got an old-time chariot waiting to come and take me home amen that's the kind of vehicle i want to brag about so uh i have a lot of scripture this evening uh and there's no way that i'm gonna be able to cover it all uh it might seem like i'm jumping from thing to thing but what i i just want to talk about the lord this evening if that's that's all right so brother branham says this he says and this is at thy word lord he says so don't think of money don't think of homes and land think of christ who is coming amen there's nobody can put hopes in anything else but christ now not sometime later down the road and we're not thinking of him sometime past but we have to think of him now uh in the present you know when when uh he was speaking when moses was talking to him or god was telling him to go down into egypt uh and moses said uh well who shall i atone that sent me you know what name can i call him he says tell him that i am now i am is right now in the present and not i was or i'm going to be he says i am so we want to focus on christ now uh he says that's right everything our whole future is on the coming of the lord our whole future is on the coming of the lord that's right that's the hope of those who are asleep and of we who are alive but he should be uh our our focus uh like the i can't think of the name of the company like that man uh told the woman that and i can never remember it anytime i tell this story i'm not a good storyteller i'm terrible at it but uh that man they he came in he told the woman he says i'm gonna come back for you in one year and all the other women were all primping themselves and and trying to be the the winner of his heart and stuff you know but it was a humble one that was in the kitchen taking care of things the one that won his heart over that's what he was looking for uh not somebody who was spending so much time on themselves print primping themselves up like the world does you know but just a humble woman so she didn't she didn't wait until the last minute well he's going to be coming next week i better start getting my my wedding garment ready no she prepared that whole year to get ready for that time because she had faith that he was going to come back for her on that day and which he fulfilled that promise that he was there to the date one year so even though she was railed on even though we're getting railed on you might get railed on well you believe that stuff in a rapture the you know rapture is not even in the bible you're and they're absolutely right the word rapture is not in the in the bible but the same definition is uh we will be caught up rapture means caught up so uh some people might think that we focus too much on on the rapture but that's that's what i'm looking forward to that's that's we're pressing toward the mark of the high calling and i can't think of any higher calling than that to be raptured away amen we tend to brag that we're the smartest thing that ever came along since a computer these are just some thoughts that i had written down but it turns out they were we're still equal with the marshmallow stick you know and they did a study of uh the human brain i can't even remember what percentage they said that we use it's like 10 of our brain capacity that we even use so how smart are we that we really think that we are you know they're it's just mass [Music] 10 or i can't remember i think that's what it is but still my goodness okay imagine what we can accomplish think of what we could destroy if we used 80 of our our brains just think of all mankind being destroyed with that uh you know because we we've got the atomic bombs we've got nuclear stuff and uh you know and it's all to destroy the other guy uh so what you know brother bran i remember he was preaching the one message i can't remember what it was and he was talking about the intelligence and ban okay so well what are they going to do with this you know what are they going to do with that and they're not going to be satisfied until they're the only ones standing okay and then what do you have after that that's going to be quite lonely when you're here by yourself you know since you conquered everybody see when man thinks he knows something he'll find out sooner or later that he really doesn't know what he what he should uh sometimes it takes the experience of the deathbed or of a fatal condition to make a man reflect on his life and and feel regret that he didn't perform the way that he should have you know how many stories have we heard that oh man i should have done this when i was younger i should have done this i should have lived for the lord uh better you know and it seems to come when the person is on their deathbed and uh man what did i and they started apologizing to everybody you know there was a guy that i worked with uh and he was he was kind of cruel uh he just wasn't a very nice man and he would tell you things and he didn't care how you felt about it but when he found out he had cancer and that he wasn't he didn't have much longer to live just like what i was saying he went around the whole plant and he was apologizing to everybody he could and something changes a man when he's faced with his greatest fear of death there's something about it that when a man is faced with no longer existing he starts thinking about on his ways you know so that's why we say now is the time to focus on christ perform live for christ now don't wait well i'll live for him once i've once i've made these accomplishments well you'll make those accomplishments if you're in the will of god if it's not his will and guess what you're probably not going to make that accomplishment to begin with no matter how hard you you struggle for it if you're one of god's and he doesn't want you to go that way you know he'll probably just throw those roadblocks right right in front of you so you can't make it there he might make you break your leg he might paralyze you to get get your attention i don't whatever it might be you know uh we've heard stories like that too uh people that were going somewhere and then all of a sudden life just comes to a stop there they have a life-altering experience that gets their mind thinking finally they start thinking about god oh excuse me things that matter the most we don't pay attention to and the things that matter little tend to get our attention you know they have a they have a drug for everything i mean they have a drug pretty much for everything uh just because because we want things fixed you know yeah some medicine is good i i'm grateful for the medicine that i've had over the years you know it's helped out a lot whether it's pain medication or or something else to to help with the healing process but to have you know if you're sleepy they've got a drug to keep you awake and if you can't sleep they got a drug to make you go to sleep uh if you got a slow heart they've got a uh they've got a pill out there to speed your heart up if your heart's beating too fast they got a pill to slow it down they pretty much have a pill for everything but they don't have the pill of the fountain of youth and they still can't find that fountain of youth if they just go to church they might find the fountain of youth amen so and it's just the intelligence of man that that makes these chemicals or or builds these bombs or whatever so some of it has uh a good purpose behind it it has a good motive because there there are smart men out there men that are way smarter than me and i wouldn't know how to come up with uh with what's that uh the mold uh the antibiotic penicillin yeah i couldn't come up with no penicillin you know and how long did it take them to come up with that but it's a lot of research and a lot of lab work and a lot of trial and error i probably just don't have the patience for that but see i fix phones sometimes too and people say i don't have the patience for that well i don't have the patience to work in a lab you know plus i don't have that intelligence but excuse me but people will just turn to anything to combat the pull of god you know we've we've heard that a person has to fight their way to hell how many has heard that you know we literally have to fight our way to hell you know because god is god has made a wave for us and it it's all up to us whether we accept that way or not is that right so uh that that story of the man that was pardoned by abraham lincoln that uh he refused it uh and and they he went before the firing squad and they it went to what congress or something like that well how did this happen he was pardoned and they concluded that a pardon is not a pardon unless it's accepted as a pardon so just because it was given the person has to accept it amen so the same thing with god we could tell people until we're blue in the face look you can be free in in the name of jesus christ you know there's freedom in in in the gospel you know but until they accept that gospel they won't receive it and like we talked this morning not everybody uh can see it right so we try to satisfy our own desires we brag about ourselves and and put our importance uh above someone else that's just kind of human nature uh kind of like the the alpha male type thing the the survival of the fittest the survival of the strongest now see we were born in sin and shaped in iniquity and come into the world speaking lies humanity is vanity is that right so in our humanity we we try so hard uh to do something that we and and for what it's for not it's for nothing uh like we said about the olympians they strive to to earn a gold medal yeah okay you got a good medal yeah you're a fast runner you're a high jumper whatever whatever it might be you know and and and i don't want to downplay it but you know because they they work at it they they're really focused on it but okay you got a medal what are you going to do with the metal you're just going to hang it up and say look what i did you know i've got trophies from and i'm sure brother jesse's got trophies i'm sure johnny's got trophies i don't know anybody else here who's done sports or anything but uh where where are trophies i know mine are sitting in a box somewhere i've saved them for for whatever nostalgic reasons or or sentimental value but they're hidden in a box so what are we going to do with it what are they going to do with the metal they're just going to put it on display and just say wow look what i did but maybe in our hearts that we could leave a legacy look what the lord did look what the lord has done for me amen let that be our testimony let's see uh second corinthians chapter four and seven it says but we have this treasure in earthen vessels is that right if you have the holy spirit we have this this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of who of god and not of us so we want to exalt god not exalt man we want to lift him up we want to give him praise we want to give him glory is that right so acts chapter 4 and verse 10 this is peter speaking he says be it known unto you all and to all the people of israel that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom ye crucified whom god raised from the dead even by him dot this man stand here before you whole this is the stone which was said it not of you builders which has become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved and that's what i'd like to speak on this evening is there's none like him amen so uh like i said i can't cover it all i'm just going to go through some things in the scriptures and i just want to exalt him that's all i just want to talk about him i want to brag on him a little bit yeah so uh there was uh there was no one like him before you know we know uh before time he can we know that uh he wasn't even known as god because god the definition of god is an object of worship so uh there was no one there to worship him right so no one existed before him he started the existence even even the hebrews they they didn't even know what to call him and they they held his name so sacred that they didn't even they didn't even really write it down we know it as yahweh uh we know him as jehovah we know him as elohim uh and there are many different names that we put uh to god and like i said moses didn't really know what to call him but god told him to tell him that i am so in revelations uh chapter one and verse seven his existence didn't begin in bethlehem either i know it's not christmas time but you know you know i thank god that he was born but that that's not what saved me you know that's not where he started his existence you know he always was uh just the just the flesh man that's that's where he started his existence but revelations chapter 1 and verse 7 it says behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him oh my yep they're going to be there too and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him even so amen he says it says i am alpha and omega the beginning and the ending saith the lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty you know he asked job one time in job 38 probably all of the children in here could quote it for me and verse 4 it says where was i when i laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou standing who hath laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who has stretched the line upon it whereupon are the foundations they're of fastened or who laid the cornerstone thereof when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of god shouted for joy job can you tell me where were you if you think you know so much why don't you tell me a little bit about creation if we think we know so much why don't we tell people about salvation amen now notice job's response after after god's rebuke in job 40 says moreover the lord answered job and said shall he that contendeth with the almighty instruct him who's going to instruct god who knows so much that they're going to instruct god well god i'm going to do it this way because this is going to be the way that it's going to work out better for my benefit so see we put the focus on us so he that reproveth god let him answer it then job answered the lord and said now notice this humility here he said behold i am vile what shall i answer thee i will lay my hand upon my mouth because he realized that he spoke out of turn and what he was saying just wasn't it just wasn't right he says once have i spoken but i will not answer yea twice but i will proceed no further he says i'm pretty much just going to shut up right now you know because i can't get anywhere with this one so a man that thinks he knows anything he doesn't know what he ought you know so we get so high and mighty and we think that we know better than god we try to put our wisdom above his when he said my ways are higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts there's just no one like him is there there's just no one like him there was no one like him in birth in creation god took a motherless woman eve out of the body of a man adam in redemption he took a fatherless man out of the body of a woman mary the man jesus was born contrary to the laws of nature being born of a virgin woman let me say that again in creation god took a motherless woman eve out of the body of man but in redemption he took a fatherless man out of the body of a woman mary who who knows the mind of god amen i haven't really heard of anyone else you know uh being virgin born is that right um i've read about claims from other religions from uh that their savior was born through a virgin birth uh but i didn't find anything uh definitive brother jesse i don't know if you've studied other religions or not but uh there are other ones that claim that that their savior was virgin born which turns out that it wasn't true but they all want to put that claim out there you know we we know in isaiah that there's a virgin shall conceive so with if other people knew that well we've got to fulfill something like that well we got to compete with the other one down the road you know uh kind of like we were what we were talking this morning when somebody paints their house their porch steps somebody else is going to have it too so i think brother brother brandon taught the uh talked about the the young boy i think his name was david or something a little young preacher like 12 years old or something like that he went out preaching well that was such a hot hit that all these other churches went out to try to get these 12 year old boys out there preaching too you know it was they wanted to stay competitive but they were after the wrong thing amen if they'd have just prayed a little bit and got in the presence of god they'd they'd have had the move of god amen amen but he caused havoc and fear among kings uh while still in the womb of a woman to the point of killing killing innocent uh infants and toddlers we know that herod was so tossed about when they when the wise man came came and said we have seen a star and uh we've come to worship him because you know we've come to worship the king do you know where he is and it's you know whatever their conversation was what another king you know so he felt his kingdom was threatened because he couldn't have another king around because he wanted to be the only one that that really mattered so he he caused havoc and fear among king herod anyways while still being in the womb of a woman amen just the ways of god of how it confounds oh my now see there was a time just at the mention of his name john the baptist left in his mother's womb and she was filled with the holy ghost see there was none like him even while he was in the womb before even at birth there was none like him the virgin birth puzzled people and caused concern because it appeared that a woman became pregnant out of wedlock which is a bad thing back in those days it's still a bad thing but it's just more accepted because it's more prevalent in this day you know it's it's more widely acceptable they want that okay well just don't abort it you know and which i which i agree don't abort the baby you know you know you made the mistake uh and and you know i've got a lot of respect for women that uh that might be single or uh i i think of my sister-in-law eileen and i think of my mom just uh of course eileen was with andy uh at that time also but kind of going uh situations happen you know and my mom she uh she struggled i got to see what what hard work uh was you know a a woman that was just labor for children no matter the sacrifices she had to make she had to make sure that we were fed and uh you know and i just have a lot of respect for a woman that would uh support her family in the absence of of a husband or uh somebody there to help her you know uh you know i just think his sister eileen that she didn't let that situation hold her down she went and she finished high school she graduated so i know it's possible i know it's a very possible thing she was just she's just a determined sister she she went on and graduated high school she went to college and she put herself through college you know with with annie's help of course but they didn't let that situation uh get them down and uh that they had sister ashley at an early age but she went on she went through college and she she got through you know and i have a lot of respect not just for a woman but for a man that would do the same thing just a person that wouldn't let their situation bring them down to use as an excuse well i can't go do this because of this situation yes you can do this if you put your mind to it and you put forth the effort and the problem is people don't want to put forth the effort to get the reward they just want things handed to them hand in foot whatever it might be there are things available for people now it's just a matter of going out and get it getting it we have to get our our eyes off of our tv our eyes off of our phone or whatever it might be and get out there and actually do something you have to get out there and make things happen pretty much yo [Music] so people were uh people were confounded while he was in the womb now we learned that he was uh he confounded the wise as a boy as well in luke chapter 2 and verse 46 it says and it came to pass that after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questions so it wasn't just he wasn't stealing the show all the time you know he was he was humble enough to listen to what they had to say and then he said some things and and that's what a dialogue is it wasn't a monologue where he took the whole thing and where he was talking all the time and so that's pretty much what happens in a lot of our prayer lives is it becomes a monologue you know we just tell god all of our problems what was me and i got this problem and i got that problem but they don't spend any time listening what he has to say and we wonder why we can't get anything [Music] amen and verse 47 it says and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers so he astonished even the wise at that day because they they couldn't fathom how much wisdom a young boy would have uh that they were even learning from him and just like mo excuse me i'm mixing up my letters here i'm tired i've appreciated that this morning for a very long time so i mean i was somewhat like it but i thought somebody was going to have to pick me up off the floor after a while because i was getting kind of well i don't know i'm going to try to take it easy tonight but we don't know what the lord's going to do either but like job mary tried the correction and uh and in turn because we know uh when they started leaving uh they finally realized hey where's jesus and they went and went back and and uh mary kind of scolded him you know where you're supposed to be with your mother and father and uh and jesus even rebuked her saying that i must be about my father's business you know i'm here taking care of what the father wants me to do uh i know what a lot of us would do to our child if they were to speak to us something like that but she kind of had she kind of knew what kind of child she had i think so because gabriel told her that's right so never a man spake like this man the man jesus so like i said early on it might seem like we're kind of skipping around but uh just gonna hit some highlights of his life and stuff so never a man spake like this man like the man jesus some he united and some he divided is that right so when he spoke truth it caused division amen john chapter 7 and verse 43 says so there was a division among the people because of him and some of them would have taken him but no man laid hands on him then came the officers to the chief priests and the pharisees and they said unto them why have you not brought them the officers answered well never a man spake like this man we didn't know what to do we didn't know how you know we didn't know how to handle that situation you know just the way that he spoke we were just wow we were in awe so what were we supposed to do you know he wasn't he wasn't causing any violence you know he spoke peacefully verse 47 says then answer them the pharisees are you also deceived have any other have any of the rulers of the affairs or of the pharisees believed on him they were so worried about losing members uh that they were so that they were so offended by jesus preaching truth and these other men preaching truth that they they couldn't have that because that would spoil all the lies that they've been telling over the years you know so their lives were being found out before them so they wanted to silence him as much as they could so he caused division because when he spoke truth it caused people to separate as as we said that the pharisees didn't like it because uh well they're going to cause an uproar they're they're going to every it was going to ruin their meal ticket pretty much that's that's pretty much what it was going to do it was tearing them down see people are still believing that the believing in the devil more than they are god people say that they'll worship god in their own way i remember when i was younger i would have conversations and uh you know discussions that uh people would say uh god isn't male or god's not a man or god's not male he could be female he could be uh we can call a mother father we he he's all everything so uh but it doesn't it it doesn't matter others might say that i don't want to go to church because it's too churchy i don't like how people get to carry it on or well they just don't know god at that church and i'm not going to attend that church because they they just can't they don't sing the songs that that i like and you know i can't get with these christians because they're just so boring or whatever you ever hear something like that i've heard that several times but like i said this morning remember you can't believe the devil's lie until you unless you first disbelieve god's word is that right but there's just no one like him uh that would say i am the way the truth or the in the life and for it to be true because there are people that that probably said that they try to make that uh they try to proclaim that they are something because we know in the scripture that uh that there were many false christs there weren't many false jesuses but there were false christs which jesus his name isn't the only name uh jesus uh i'm sure there are other people called jesus i think there was another one in the bible but it wasn't jesus the christ that we know of uh so it wasn't so much in into that name but people made so many proclamations out there that i'm i'm the messiah so that's why there were so many cautions in in the in the new testament that we're cautious of about the antichrist because there were so many false christs that came before jesus and if we think we have it now there were even there was just as much before jesus came amen so there was none there was no one like him when he proclaimed that i am the way the truth and the life and for it to be true there was none like him when he said i am the i am that bread i am the bread of life there was no one like him when he said lazarus come forth there was no other voice that they were that lazarus was going to listen to amen but when he said because and we were taught by brother branham that jesus was man and he was a man when he shed tears for lazarus but he was god when he said lazarus come forth amen so there was no one like him when he said lazarus come forth who else was able to raise somebody else from the dead [Laughter] his wisdom continued to baffle the wise he caused a rocket saying that the temple would be torn down and in three days he would build the temples all right in john chapter 2 and verse 19 it says jesus answered and sent to them destroy this temple and in three days i will rise it up of course they didn't know what what he was talking about then said the jews 46 years was his temple in building and without reared up in three days but he spanked at the temple of his body is that right and as a gentle man his righteous indignation rose up and with the money chamber changers for defiling his father's house of prayer worship you know i hear people say that it wasn't that wasn't love when he went and picked up the whip and he started whipping them money changers uh that that wasn't love that was a temper he just lost his temper well i say that that's not it it was the zeodine house had eaten me up amen it was the zeal that he had for purity to be inside the church it had to be a pure thing that he wanted oh my goodness he didn't want to see it defiled so he rose up and he did something about it because nobody else even even the priest should have known that that shouldn't be going on but they let it happen amen he calmed the sea and they asked well what manner of man is this that has power over the wind he speaks as one with authority mark chapter one and and twenty two it says and they were astonished at his doctrine for he taught them as one that had authority and not as the scribes the scribes taught but they didn't have any authority behind it so it was different when it came from jesus when he did the teaching there was authority that be that came behind and they said what kind of man is this that he speaks with one as a that has authority amen they tried to catch him in many traps and were taken back when he said render under caesar what is caesar's and unto god what is god's they were just they were just aghast they didn't know what to answer nobody else asked him anything after that because because they were trying to get him so round up but he wouldn't give in to their their uh their traps that they were trying to set for him he just said okay if you want to do this whose inscription is this on this coin okay this is yours this is what man has made surrender unto man what is man's but what is god's you give unto god he made that separation and he made it clear amen mark chapter 12 and verse 28 says and one of the scribes came and having heard them reasoning together now did you hear that they were reasoning together not shouting back and forth and having a screaming bat match that my doctrine is uh more right than your doctrine but they were reasoning together and perceiving that he had answered them well asked him which is the first commandment of all and jesus answered him the first of all the commandments is hero israel the lord our god is one lord and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment and the second is like namely this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself there is none other commandment greater than these and the scribe said unto him well master thou has said the truth for there is one god amen and there is none other but he oh my so this man this scribe is saying there is no other god but he there is no one else like him amen and to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the soul and with all the strength and to love his neighbor as himself is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices it's more than all that you could do as a man any work that you could do but if you just give them your whole self if you could be that living sacrifice living unto others amen forgetting about yourself but giving on to others your focus is on someone else and the focus is taken off of you and when jesus saw that he answered discreetly he said unto him thou art not far from the kingdom of god oh my how i would like to hear that too amen and no man after after that durst or dared to ask him any question amen he could tell you what you were thinking see there was none like him because there were some people that could tell you what you were thinking but they were just mind readers but there was something different he had to give he had the discernment amen he could tell what you were thinking yes sir [Music] and we know brother brandon had that gift as well but it wasn't brother branham it was the spirit inside brother brandon was that right it was it was the gift it's not something that he learned and picked up from somewhere but in luke chapter 7 and verse 39 it says now when the pharisee which had bitten him saw it he spake within himself no he didn't within himself he didn't say it out loud saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of woman this is that touches him for she is a sinner and jesus answering said unto him simon i have somewhat to say unto thee and he saith master say on and he went on to rebuke him for uh for not even acknowledging his presence he said thy the sins that she had they have forgiven her amen from the time that she came in she did not cease to to wash my feet and to kiss me and anoint me with oil but she did all these things but when i came in you just sat over in that corner with your friends and you didn't even acknowledge that i came in the house but this woman from the time that she came in she did nothing but honor me he healed without medicine and required no fees all right mark 2 and 11 he says i say unto thee arise and take up thy bed and go thy way into thine house and immediately he arose took up the bed and went forth before them all in so much that they were all amazed and glorified god saying we never saw it on this fashion there is none like him they never saw anything like that happen there was none like him ever in john 5 and 7 it says the impotent man answered him sir i have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool but while i'm coming another person steppeth down before me brother sister you don't have to wait to get into the pool tonight because you have that direct access to him and it was just jesus that came down and said i have what you have need of amen you don't have to go step into that pool now he could have went to any person there but he chose that man it was something about that man that he chose to give it to amen and we think we know something you know this this man all he knew was that he had to get into that pool of bethesda amen that's all he knew to get healed he didn't know anything else he wasn't a real smart man he didn't know how to go about getting healed any other way there were no doctors that could help him because he would have gone to him or he couldn't afford one or the other but he just couldn't make it it wasn't in his knowledge he wasn't even thinking of the other man coming up to him even thinking saying oh you could be healed it just happened in verse 8 it says jesus jesus saith unto him rise take up thy bed and walk there was one that healed a young girl in her ears and all y'all know sister julia newmar we were sitting there i can't remember the brother's name i think it was paul he was a short little guy short little preacher and he was just preaching a message and at the end he was just praying he says i don't know why sister but i feel led to pray for your ears and after he started praying for her you could see her sitting up there just a giggling and why was she giggling because she could actually hear something without the hearing aid something take something had taken place there was someone there was somebody that healed me in my hips you know oh my there was one that healed me so many times now y'all know the story i think i told it the last time that i was here brother jesse had prayed for me and i was going through they were talking about that i needed some uh hip replacement because my my hip was degrading and now it was just wearing away and they said that there was nothing that they could do about it aside from a hip replacement you know here i am 44 45 years old whenever it was uh that it took place and you know that's too young for a hip replacement i couldn't go through that you know i didn't want that to happen but by the prayer of faith my hips were healed i remember uh getting a call from the woman we went over your uh your mri and uh we see what they what they were talking about but uh it's it's something changed something's different your body must have healed itself and all i could think of was the body of christ because the body of christ was praying for me amen and i just thank god so much for that there's none like him when you have need of healing he's there to heal you amen amen thank you lord and his home did it happen in an instant no it didn't i suffered for a little while it was a few months that i had to wait i can't remember about six months or something like that i had to wait and i remember there was a man in there a young man when i got that phone call and i said if you've never been preached to you're about to because i was ready to preach the salvation of christ amen about the healing of a soul amen but there is no one like him in his suffering is all right and the garden of gethsemane he he sweat drops or uh he sweat his drops of blood luke 22 and 44. it says uh and being in agony he probably i'm getting excited up there that's why i'm getting a little dancy up here so and being in agony uh he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was as as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground how many of us have been an earnest that we even sweat drops of sweat amen not so much that uh as sweat as drops of blood but how many people just get so much in in a fervent prayer see the fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much amen so if you're just just just passively asking lord i need you to help me if you could do that today thank you and just walk away and continue on doing what you're doing but uh the fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much amen who am i there's just something that stirs me in my soul knowing how much how much god has answered prayer in my life amen but you know why he was struggling so hard in the garden of gethsemane because he was going to go to a cross for you and me is that right he was going to take care of something for somebody else his focus wasn't on him so much but he was just i don't want to go through with this but i know there's something better at the end amen i have to go through this amen now see he was wounded for our transgressions isaiah 53 and 5 he says but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed amen is that right and i believe it i'm a testament to that and any other person in here that's been healed is a testament that he's still a healer in this day i don't care if they try to say signs of miracles or past i've seen it several times just in my life that oh my goodness not even just a start on other people there were books books upon books upon books about divine healing where directors couldn't even touch the ailment and it was just divine intervention where god had healed them amen who am i god will not leave himself without a witness is that right oh my see there is none like him in death or burial people railed on him you know if you were the cr if you were the christ then you save yourself not knowing that they couldn't give him a better compliment because he stayed there for us he endured the torture the pain the humiliation for you and me they couldn't give him a better compliment if you're christ like they come down off that cross but he had to stay there for you and me they just testified to what he was exactly doing is that right oh my because you could save yourself they were trying to and that's the same thing that the devil tries to do as is you could save yourself you could save yourself this humiliation if you just blame it on somebody else oh my oh now i'm getting into somebody but that's we've got to be able to accept responsibility for our own actions is that right you know you do the crime you do the time you just better be expecting that spanking when it comes amen right you because you reap what you sow you're not going to escape it amen that's right who am i no one died like him he even had a borrowed tomb it was temporary you know when you borrow something you usually plan to return it is that right but he didn't plan on staying very long he was going to give it back he wasn't he didn't plan on staying in that tomb oh my matthew 27 and 58 he says he went to pilate uh talking about joseph uh he went to pilate and begged the body of jesus then pilate commanded the body to be delivered and when joseph had taken the body he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth and laid it in his own new tomb did you catch that and then and laid it in his own new tomb which he had hewn out of the rock and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulcher and departed and verse 53 it says and he took it down and wrapped it in linen and laid it laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone where uh wherein never a man laid was before it was laid i feel like i jumped scripture i did i went to a different book sorry about that luke 23 and 53 it says and he took it down wrapped it in linen and laid it in the sepulchre that was hewn and stone this was after the crucifixion wherein never man was before laid you know i just had a thought in there before i came out i was kind of reviewing uh going over the notes here now if you notice in matthew uh 27 and 60 it says and he laid it in his own new tomb now see if there were there if there were other people other bones in that gr in that tomb when jesus rose guess what those other bones would have had to raise with them but it was not yet time for a resurrection time amen the one resurrection had already taken past but oh my or taken his course he was so holy that he didn't lie in the defile tomb it was a new tomb it was a bar to him like i said he was going to return it amen there was no one like him in his death he forgave the thief on the cross it could have been that he left his body uh left his body on the cross for a minute and escorted that forgiven sinner to the gates of paradise is that right uh matthew 27 and 51 it says and behold the veil of the temple was rent and twain from from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rent and the graves were open and many bodies of the saints which slept the rose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many amen oh my brother brandon says this he says notice here he come walking i'm not going to be much longer just a few more minutes give me a few more minutes here he says notice here he come walking god's word is eternally true is that right he's coming again i kind of feel checked because i think i said that the resurrection already happened no it was after his resurrection that the saints arose so i i apologize for saying that i just now uh caught that the lord thank you lord for correction notice here he come walking god's word is eternally true he's coming again do you believe that going walking down through there triumphant and i hear the old testament saints rallying around him this is the redeemer say lift up your everlasting gates and be he lifted up and let the king of glory come in he says the angels i can hear the angels back over in the glorious place of god say who is this king of glory that's what the bible said in the old testament saints said the lord of hosts mighty in battle here he comes the king with his delegates the conqueror although he is a mighty conqueror since he rent the veil in two the angel pressed the gates the pearly gates swing swung open when he pressed the button uh down through the city of jerusalem come comes jesus the conqueror with all the old testament saints that lived back there believing that he would he would come sometime excuse me i could see him marching as angelic bands beating and playing and the angels sing hosanna here come the old testament saints and jesus are walking through the streets right up in front of the father he said father these are those that died in good faith amen he says well done my son climb up here on my throne and sit down on my right hand till i make every enemy your footstool for one of these days i'm going down to bingham binghamton new york or akron ohio wherever it might be hallelujah i'm going to send you back again to get everyone that dies in faith amen there he is the great mighty conqueror sitting at the right hand of the majesty of god tonight in his presence now see there is none like him amen there is only one making intersection on anybody here that will dare to take him by faith and god will send the holy ghost down to seal you into the kingdom of god amen jesus has come musicians come there was no one like him in his resurrection he rose up with the power and he took the sting of death in the keys of hell is that right there is no one like him in his ascension john 3 and 13 it says and no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven ephesians 4 and 8 through 10 it says wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now he that it that now that he has ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth to take away the keys of the devils to take away the sting of death hell in the grave amen he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things now see there was none like him in an ascension they might say that there there were other resurrections or whatever but there was none like jesus amen no one thought no one was born like him no one died like him no one spake like him there's just none like him there are many that resemble him that did mighty works but they are not fully him is that right we talk about brother branham he had the gifts of healing he had the gifts of discernment but he was not fully god amen he was only partial god oh my oh some may display some of the attributes but they will never be the fullness of god we are just man amen joseph was close whereas he typed he he was a type of jesus christ he was close to it but he wasn't him moses was close as being god as we talked about this morning that god set him in the position of of being god and aaron as his prophet but god uh but he was still not god he was still man he still had humanity joshua was kind of close being a type of the holy spirit but still he was not fully god amen but each of them is only one attribute where jesus christ was the fullness of the godhead jesus said there were many false christs before him and we know that there are many that follow after him there are so many counterfeits it could just about make you go crazy is that right he has a name that's above every name for where two or three are gathered in my name there i am in the midst of him see there is none like him that when you call upon him there he is he said be ye holy for i am holy when you give yourself unto him you get into his presence you become holy as he is holy but you are still not fully god amen we baptize in his name we don't baptize in the name the name of the father and son and the holy ghost we we do but it's all it's summed up in one name the name jesus christ amen there is none like him people tried to baptize in other men's names but it didn't work and paul said i thank god that i didn't baptize a one of you because you were going to try to say that i did something you were putting too much focus on me oh my if i thought i was i was going to try to take it easy oh my ephesians 4 and 3 says endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace there was one body and one spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in you oh amen one lord one faith and one baptism you mean there's one baptism well what about matthew 28 19 and acts 2 38 that sounds like two baptisms nope the one sums up the other they become one amen because in the name of jesus christ is in the name of the father and the son and the holy ghost amen oh my who a greater than solomon is here greater than all is here is that right he's the one who makes our hearts burn within us he's the only one who can save us he's the only one who healeth all of our diseases he's the one who calms the storms of life when it seems to be raging out of control is that right he's the one who sets the kept us free he's the one who parted the red sea leaving behind the enemies amen they try to follow closely on your heels he's the one who parts out waters amen praise the lord you don't have to ask anyone's permission to come to him it's not dependent upon your shaking on same with someone's hand or signing a membership book a man was healed and the leaders went to his parents to interrogate them because they weren't satisfied with his answers amen his parents responded ask him he's of age because they were afraid of being tossed out of the church is that right it was his own experience that he that he had to go through it was his experience not his parents who oh my it's not in reciting the apostles creed or the lord's prayer our uh our pastor the other day he was just talking about coming as you are which is something that you have to do don't try to be like somebody else come as you are you got folks and failures you did something you might set out of church but come as you are and bring it to god amen god is a forgiven forgiver of sins is that right blessed is the man whose sins and iniquities are forgiven hallelujah there's only one that could do that there's none like him amen he's the god that i serve he's constant he's the same yesterday and today and forever what he was in the old testament didn't be in the new testament is that right so the one time they'd uh so we we read the story of what i've talked about this morning i think about the uh feeding the multitude the the 5000 and the 4000 with with loads of fish or loaves of bread and the fish there was a time that they fed 100 men back there and uh when they were making the pot somebody went out and grabbed the herbs they didn't know what kind of herb it was they didn't realize it but it was poison in the pot and who did they call upon they called upon elisha and they said that there's poison in the pot and what happened he went and got some meal he went and got some bread the bread of life would put it in that soup is that right oh my god and he fed the multitude of a hundred men that day he's the same today yesterday and forever is that right hallelujah hallelujah you better sing something let's sing that song uh uh one of my favorites no not one who there's not a friend like the lowly jesus is that right there is none like him you need a comforter he could comfort like no other person could comfort amen you try to go try to comfort a friend when they uh suffer the loss of a loved one you've got to try to comfort them yes stay to your feet you try to comfort them you can try your best but when they call upon the name of the lord jesus
