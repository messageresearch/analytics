Spirit that the faith of the Holy Spirit the power of the Holy Spirit fill each and every heart we ask it in Jesus Christ's name the church said amen God best use being seated there praise God this is part 4 here in the the wisdom series by the grace of the Lord so we'd like to look at the proverbs 31 woman I've never preached on proverbs 31 woman so this is new to me I'm sure over the years maybe you've heard different sermons on it I I never have I'm always been preaching most of my life so or most of my Christian life so it's the first time I preached it so looking forward to this message we read our text here and just let you know I'm still praying about you know the future series I like to look I look I'd like to preach the whole life of Jesus Christ of Nazareth I like to preach his whole life I'm praying about that like to do a leadership I like to do some rebuttals on the believe the sign false interpretations and so forth I like to preach a series on finding your purpose in life I like to preach that so we're thankful we finished the church age book 68 sermons on the church ages and that was a real blessing and we started Cleo we have started a series on prayer on Wednesday night feeding is a chance to hear that for the home church I think that'd be a blessing to you and also we started wisdom I still want to go back and finish my David series and book a revelation series and the Paul's Gospels so I still keep track of those and just trying to find the leadership of the Lord so let's look at a few just reviews from the first sermon I preached in this series the first and last chapters of Proverbs are very inspired of course all of it is but for us it's a it's a further inspiration we'd say a further revelation than most people can receive because we know the message of the hour by God's grace so chapter one begins with a plea to receive we'd say the seeds of wisdom from a king to his son it's from the King Solomon to his son which is probably rare boom but it could be you know another son and in this chapter wisdom is symbolic the Bible calls her a lady she's crying out in the street she's just crying for anyone well anyone here wisdom if there's anyone that wants to know the truth of God's Word and she's just crying out you know and so chapter 1 lays in the seeds of God's Word now in chapter 31 as we're gonna look at this morning we'll practic a couple sermons on a chapter xxxi woman but in chapter 31 we see the fruit or the result of living a life of wisdom from another king because we started with solomon now this could be our look at this this morning - it could be from another king or actually could be solomon himself and I'll share a little bit about that just a moment from his mother so we end of the book the book begins with a king - his son the book ends with a king sharing the wisdom about what a real woman looks like from his mother the wisdom he learned from his mother so wisdom is now in the flesh it's no longer symbolic and so the word has become flesh how many want that for your life I want the word to become flesh so at the end of my life I'm fully manifesting all of the word that God would have me to fulfill praise the Lord but it starts like in chapter when it starts with crying out you know she wisdom is crying out will anybody here so it starts with us humbling ourselves and coming to lady wisdom to receive of her spirit which is we know is only one spirit the holy spirit praise God and then by the end of the book the word becomes flesh and we see what wisdom produces in a woman's life amen and of course by then look at this poem you know chapter 31 is a poem verses 10 to 31 is actually a poem and it's called an acrostic it's alphabetical a cross stick which we'll get to in a moment as well because each letter uses a different I'm sorry each scripture uses a different letter and uses all the letters of the Hebrew alphabet which is I think pretty inspired while share I'll share why in just a moment now the importance of proverbs 31 to us if we are the wise virgins our lives should be centered around wisdom including that of Proverbs we know there's going to be foolish virgins we know there's going to be wise virgins but we want to be the wise virgins amen and this book majors on wise why is the lie son the wise King the wise woman it majors on what a wise person lives like so if anybody should want to read proverbs and manifest proverbs it ought to be us if we're wise virgins amen we should not be foolish and well that's just another book of the Bible you know we know how books are inspired we know we know where a full word bride but we should especially manifest the wisdom that got his place in the scriptures for us amen so remember chapter 1 began with a symbolic lady wisdom seeking to pour out her spirit chapter 31 ends with a look at a woman who's manifested the spirit and now she's the Word made flesh so goes from symbolic to flesh or from from spiritual to flesh it comes into flesh now the climax or culmination of proverbs this is the very climax of proverbs is this mature fruitful rare woman of wisdom it's so hard to find a proverbs 31 woman hey can the brothers and sisters say men it's so hard to find a man who's virtuous as well we know Psalm is that is harder to find a woman but that's you know Ecclesiastes chapter 7 but that was in his day of course that was in his day so but this is all a type so the book builds to a climax and the climax is this mature woman who's so rare she's so godly she's so holy that she's the very climax she's the very embody of wisdom and that is a type of how the Gentile age climax in a word bride amen the Gentile bride who is just like Christ at Christ's coming like the pyramid symbol she has to fit that last headstone piece perfectly and that's how the bride of Jesus Christ will be at the time of the rapture her life will be just like Christ's life amen it has to because that's the Vettes the symbol God gives us Christ is the cornerstone Christ is the headstone amen that's the symbol that we're given our lives have to look just like Christ and I want to be first to lie and say Lord mold my life change my life can victim or like Christ Jesus amen I've got I've got area to grow I've got I got I've got faith that can rise amen I've got more potentials that are not tapped into yet and help me to tap into the potentials of the Holy Spirit and what will that look like more death to self amen more crucifying the flesh and the affections and lusts thereof more of Christ less of me now let's look at the origin this is what I was mentioning earlier this chapter seems so inspired I think if we if we dig a little deeper by the grace of the Lord look at the origin of this chapter and let's get the author in the background King Lemuel is mentioned as the author it's in verse 1 the words of King Lemuel he's mentioned nowhere else in Scripture and he's the one that wrote or had this prophetic chapter written down and you know this chapter was a prophecy the Bible calls it a prophecy look at verse 1 the words of King Lemuel the prophecy that his mother taught at home I just struck me that's prophetic of you and I'm an Alleluia that's prophetic of the mature bride of Jesus Christ it just struck me I was as I was just thinking how it was prophetic of Solomon but this is prophetic of us amen this is a prophecy that a godly mother taught her son that was going to be King one day hallelujah now who is lemuel there's two thoughts on this first one of the commentary said he's probably a heathen king who was a proselyte into Judaism that's what one commentator says I don't side with that one I'm with this other side I'll get to in a moment but I can be wrong I mean no one really knows for sure but if you notice though his lineage is not even listed okay now a ger who wrote and compiled chapter 30 his lineage was at least listed where at least told who his father was he's the son of Jacob looks like in chapter 30 verse 1 so this Lemuel is a very strange character in Scripture he's not listening as having any father or mother you know you don't have any lineage you know it's really striking you know like a type of Christ or something like that which we know Solomon was a type of Christ the Son of David so the second idea is that Lemuel is a nickname for a very famous Israeli King and this is what I believe if you look in the Strong's Concordance this is Hebrew number thirty-nine 27 Lemuel means belonging to God and it's symbolic of the name of Solomon so it's very possible and some scholars really they cite on either side some say this is just a you know a proselyte King because really why would the Jews put some heathen King in their book of wisdom you know saw the Bible said solomon compound had 3000 of verses of wisdom and were compiled and we he all compiled it wrote it down and that's where we got the Book of Proverbs but to me it seems very likely that Lemuel is actually a nickname for Solomon that's what it seems like to me because the name Lemuel means belonging to God Solomon means peace Salman also has a nickname means beloved of Jehovah Jedediah means beloved of Jehovah according to second Samuel 1225 so God loves Solomon let me know that and notice in Solomon's earlier years he loved God he loved wisdom so the Bible said that he was beloved of your over love Solomon because God looked down through time and said this boy is gonna love my word he is gonna love my wisdom I know I know later on when he's older he's gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna offer him anything and he's going to turn down riches and he's gonna turn down kingdoms and the armies he's going to turn all that down just to have the wisdom to judge my people the right way amen God love somebody that wants to treat his his people the right way amen God loves preachers I don't treat the bride the right way praise the Lord Amen because look what the Bible said the Bible said he called his name Solomon and the Lord loved him then his name he called Jedediah and now remember proverbs we preach this a few weeks ago the Bible said I love I wisdom love them that love me so if we want God's love with more manifest in our lives we've got to love Jesus and Jesus said he that loves me keeps my commands amen hallelujah so we must love the Lord we must love wisdom and that's what Solomon did he loved the Lord and so God loved him now we know God got angry at the end of his life we'll look at that just a moment now I'm just doing it if here this is if it's either you know lemon oils either Solomon or it's a proselyte king it's either one of the other if King Lemuel is indeed Solomon then Bathsheba his mother taught him this saying wouldn't that be powerful church that about blew my mind recall that Hebrew boys were under tutors before coming under their father's profession right because that's what Hebrews 4 2 says they're under tutors for a while and then when they pass the tutor then they go to be with their father and work under their father's profession whether he was carpenter or farmer or whatever he was so that means if this was indeed Salman Bathsheba would have taught Solomon these truths before he was taught even by the tutors so Bathsheba if this was actually Bathsheba Bathsheba took this opportunity before Solomon gets the schoolteachers I want to plant prophecies in his heart hallelujah amen hope that's how you feel as mothers and fathers we want God's Word to be planted in the hearts of our children and grandchildren amen whoever this mother was she knew if I can plant this prophecy in my son's heart it's going to impact so many more people she knew I've got the revelation I've got the prophecy of the hour if I can plant it in my son who's going to be king this King will pass it on to everyone else what an impact one woman can have if she stays consecrated to God's Word amen hallelujah if she can believe the prophecy if she can believe the Word of God what amazing impact one woman can have upon generations to come amen now in this chapter this is the wisdom we see from this mother wisdom on how to be a king and then wisdom on how to choose a wife how to recognize what's a godly woman look like remember she's telling this to her son who's going to be king of Israel and she wants him to be able to be a good leader a godly leader and she wants him to be able to recognize this is what a wise woman looks like how many brothers when I won't recognize a wise woman thank God you have if you're married you God God's giving you a real blessing there is a wife he that's find that wife findeth a good thing the Bible says Amen so look at the path of wisdom that God ordained God ordained this path mothers never never never let Satan belittle the importance of your role your roars no roars crucial your your roars is so a critical and important you have the ability to impact hundreds if not thousands of people just by being faithful and Junior children the Word of God amen now just let's not forget the importance of women let's really just recall a few things just for a moment here mothers are the fifth gospel right and Jesus first showed himself alive to women and then the first woman was a former prostitute Mary Magdalene that's the first one he showed himself alive - not Peter with the keys to the kingdom it was a woman who had seven demons a men used to sleep around for money and do all kinds of evil but when Jesus mattered Jesus loosed her of those demons Jesus loosed her of that filthy lifestyle and Jesus thought so much that he will show himself to her the very first person that saw the resurrected Christ amen in his glorified body he chose a woman why he was showing he was going to redeem all the women or the churches is that right seven demons she was redeemed from seven demons were redeemed out of seven filthy Church ages amen hallelujah exactly right and then he still went to women after that he wasn't nun and the guys didn't believe it you know in those days in the courtrooms at the Roman courtrooms or what a man's testimony was always believed more than a woman's she was so low socially she had no she hadn't hardly any you know any trust you could place in a woman they weren't place in a woman and member they would even take her inheritance you know where that they wouldn't even let her have inheritance and financially if she was a widow it was it was almost like a death sentence you had to have someone she had to have someone provide for her so Jesus you know he he rejects all these worldly thoughts and and he lets the first people witness that he's alive to be women that's right now notice King Lemnos mother was seeking this was her desire to shape the Kings destiny by wisdom she knew where she wanted her son to go she knew where or what she wanted her son to become so at a young age he's trying to teach this prophecy about the Word of God hey man I mean you like to teach your children about the rapture praise the Lord there is going to be a meeting in the area man the dead in Christ shall rise first that's what we tell our children the dead in Christ will rise first you might see people that were dead you might see them alive you might see them because that's what the Bible said it's a reality those are the prophecies but we know as that happens we know the Bible said we're brother Branham taught us that the fullness of the Pentecost will be a bride amen that's prophecy the bride's got to come back to me to being the bride she was at Pentecost according to brother Branham and then we'll see the dead in Christ rise and then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together to meet the lord in the air that's not some fairy tale that's prophecy amen hallelujah that's not something we're guessing at that's the Holy Scripture amen three thousand years old from that word from Joel there I will restore saith the Lord this is a prophecy and this is what we should rest upon this is what ye should teach the next generation amen that was her desire the Kings choice for a life the first lady of Israel presumably right would be based upon his mother's wisdom the woman sheets that woman each O's would then impact the rest of Israel so as a mother she stepped back and realized I have a huge influence on the next generation my son is going to influence the next generation whether godly or ungodly and then his wife is going to influence all the women right remember with at women with Esther she got in there because Vashti was influencing the women the wrong way not respecting their husbands right not listening their husbands not obeying their husbands so she had this wisdom I if I can train them up if I can teach in the prophesy if I can teach in the scripture my son will have a major impact for God and then his wife will impact the females as well and that that generation will rise up and be blessed say men that's exactly right remember we read this on Wednesday but brother Ram says what a sacred trust what a responsibility to a women now see why she's a type of the church which has the same responsibilities as a woman has a sacred responsibility to her motherhood sacred this is not something we take lightly being a mother is not something you can take like oh I got to get out in the workforce put that on hold put the responsibility of being a mother let that be the most sacred thing in your life sisters amen that is the most sacred thing you have and you have the sacred the sake of responsibility of keeping your virtue your holiness your sanctity and a responsibility to your husband just as Christ has our sacred responsibility to prayer I'm sorry just to the church has a sacred responsibility to prayer to the word to Christ just the same as the woman has hey man hallelujah you see how this is something that we can't take lightly I know the world wants to try to rush and get the mothers out of motherhood as fast as they can but God tells us this is the most sacred thing they can do is raise a child to know Christ and to know the prophecy the word of the hour that they're living in amen hallelujah nothing's more sacred than that notice the Prophet says your member this he says these children he's dedicating a baby and he says they're little treasures that God has given you the responsibility look at all those treasures brother John you got next to you further back look at that little treasure crawl on your lap right there you got a responsibility there and I've always said it may be this kind of a saying to mothers we know written for Gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John but there's a fifth gospel unwritten that's Mother so mother is the good news to her children mothers don't want to be good news when you wake up in the morning Oh where's my mama don't you want to be a source of good news to your children mom's got a smile or my mom you know singing or whistling the gospel song or something you want to be a source of good news of what Christ has done in your life amen he says she gets them before Matthew Mark Luke and John steam gets to them see that's what the mother of King Lemuel did for him she got to him before the others got to him so the responsibilities is placed upon you mothers and you father's don't leave out the father's there right we're not leaving out the dads they have just their more responsibility because they're the head of the home to raise these children for the kingdom of God and I'm sure that's your heart's desire amen I could care less if my children are millionaires or doctors or lawyers or whatever they are I want them to be working for the kingdom of God I'll be most happy if Malachi Lydia they just sit there not sit there but of course they'll be doing things you're learning and but if they keep their place in the house of God that's the most valuable thing to me because we seek first the kingdom of God everything else is added amen we must seek to do God's will first and the way we get to know God's will is the here's word amen exactly right hallelujah now remember the reality about children children are God's property not ours the Bible calls them the heritage of the Lord that means the possession yeah you say well I take care of them I love my children but really they're God's right and children are your reward you must have done something right if God gave you children the bat's what the Bible says they're a reward and children are arrows in a mighty man's hand so see brothers we've got to be mighty in the scripture and they must be sharp and/or trained right that's why I you know that's right we don't we don't even though many of us homeschool some of us know it's alright but at home school they're there sometimes reproach upon home scores because that they don't sharpen their kids as much as they ought to they get lazy with school and then we'll just take a week off here pretty soon it's a month off pretty soon is two months off pretty soon there and hardly learn it at all that's a shame they need to be sharpened those mines need to be sharpened they need to be learning that's their job in our society is to be sharpened but the best sharpening they can have at home is love and correction amen they must be loved they must be hugged and kissed and they must they must be complimented but they also must be corrected by the Word of God amen that's how you sharpen them right the key to parenting there's three keys to parenting model model and model whatever you live before them is what you're going to produce right most of time because we went over about a few weeks ago no matter how close a Rebecca and Isaac lived to God Esau was destined to be lost right Jacob have I loved Esau I hated no matter how close Isaac and Rebecca lived to God Esau was still gonna be hated by God because God foreknew what he would choose so while we can't guarantee every child to be saved we can train them up and ask God and plead with God and pray and intercede and as a king of the priests we believe God will answer our priestly requests amen go see the desires of our heart that's our responsibility sharpen them train their minds especially in the ways of God remember this but if your children go to public school then they got what is it seven times they got thirty five hours a week of getting sharper in you but we better make sure we better ask them what they learn each day what you learn on the bus that's one of the worst places to learn because there's no adult supervision we better ask them and make sure they're being sharpened the right way because the Bible went through many scriptures this morning there's scriptures about how Satan's lies are like arrows and they sharpen his arrows too he's sharpening his arrows our arrows they'll have to be godly arrows it's exactly right now the you said also Christians are happy with the full quiver of arrows we should be happy with the total number of children a God gives us amen not complain not be burdened not be prideful but be happy be thankful with the number of children God gives us now I've trained righteously the children will be bold for Christ in public day amen that's all according to Psalms 127 all that I just pulled out of these scriptures right here though children are a heritage or possession of the Lord the fruit of the womb is his reward as arrows are in the hand of the mighty man so are the children of the youth happy is the man that this quiver full of them they shall not be ashamed who these children these arrows but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate the gate was the place of social and public interaction amen and if we train our children the right way the Bible said that when you're not ashamed of me I'll be not ashamed of you amen that's Jesus's promise if you're not ashamed of me on earth than the angels of God and the son of God will not be ashamed of you in heaven amen so we train our children to have an answer for the devil's lies hallelujah because the Bible said in first Peter 3:15 or we ought to always have an answer for the hope that we have within us amen praise the Lord now let's look at this prophecy just a moment here the prophecy that she taught and whether it was a different woman or whether as Bathsheba verse 1 the words of King Lemuel the prophecy that his mother taught him what a great prophecy now what's prophetic in chapter 31 now of course we went over it I believe it's prophetic of the Bride of Christ because she's a very culmination of the church Ages she's the final voice to the final age she's no better than the other ages she was just ordained to be the final voice she was just just like Enoch he was just ordained along with God well Noah he was just ordained to go in the ark it's what we're all day it doesn't make us better than anybody it's just what we're called to do we just need to accept God's calling for our lives amen we're no better than anybody it's just God that's the blood of Jesus there'll be no boasting in heaven the Bible said there was only one thing I'm boasting that's the cross of Christ amen his blood shed for my sins amen he redeemed me he bought me he redeemed me back to God amen I look at the Bible says verse 3 this is her is her first words of prophecy to Solomon or Lemuel whoever you want to call give not no words don't give your strength unto women he's talking he's talking to the future king nor thy ways to that which destroys Kings what a prophecy of this is Solomon and Bathsheba what a prophecy the very first thing out of her mouth you're gonna be Kings son don't give your heart to women because the Bible said when it came to pass and the older days of Solomon when he got older he got a little axe on God his wives turned away his heart after other gods I was reading asterisks and some of those Moloch and Balaam some of those gods were evil I mean they were just the the Israelites sacrificed babies at their altar and solemn willingly built those altars so they could sacrifice babies there now he was so gifted at the beginning he was so sure at the beginning but he wandered often making compromises and pretty soon he finds himself on the whole other side God loved him at the beginning of course and God loved him and Satan we know that but he wandered so far church when we feel the very least tug of the Holy Spirit when we're wrong we need to get back on the right path amen sin will take you farther than you were to go and keep you longer than you want to stay but the grace of God will keep you as a seal not to tomorrow or next week but to the day of your Redemption amen hallelujah and that's what Solomon lack didn't have they didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost available in those days hallelujah we got an amen Christ is sealed in Satan's sealed out praise God amen now look did you know rare bones struggle with the same thing because Salman didn't overcome and Solomon modeled marrying many wives to his sons as you know Rahab own struggle with that too rheya bone desired many wives go to read that scripture if you like remember Abraham like what did Isaac do like praise God so we got to take heed to ourselves what kind of lives and we as parents or grandparents what kind of lives are we modeling before the children it should be our life of godliness and holiness Amen ray Obama Solomon's son he was actually the first one to rule after Solomon passed he may be the my son can you imagine how how sad that would be we preach on that a few Wednesday's ago remember that there's 23 times Solomon says my son and if Ray Vaughn was the oldest which he might have been that means 23 times Solomon sat down and was teaching his son said my son don't do this my son don't do that my son don't do that he warned him about women and wine and idols and all these things right money and all these he warned about all these things but then rainbow watches his father drift off not living what he was preaching oh god help us to live what we preach amen if we preach it at Sunday morning let's go home Sunday and I didn't live in it praise God if not it does us no good we're just religious hypocrites but we got to take what we hear and make it live in our homes amen 23 times my son don't go to strange women my son don't keep your honor you know keep the integrity of the Lord keep the commandments of God and pretty soon rainbow and become a man not even fit to rule he was the one that member he's the one that trusted his younger friends more than the old wise saints of God what a shame and the Bible says the gray hair is the glory of the wisdom of man in the book of Proverbs so apparently rainbow wasn't paying much attention to the wisdom as dad taught him because he rejects the gray head of wisdom and an honor and purity he rejects that for a bunch of renegades Oh put the burdens harder on the people just mistreat the people they need to respect where God was calling for mercy have mercy have patience waiting upon the Lord but he got the roughs of the forcing stiff hand instead of having mercy how many want to see the mercy of God in your life I want to see it by God's grace and this is what he didn't learn the thing was he should have learned this but he didn't and so we see Solomon's his heirs his mistakes we see it repeated in the very next generation lord have mercy now look at this the word the prophecy that his mother taught him if this is Bathsheba who better to teach Solomon about how to best rule as a king and to select a godly wife than Bathsheba who would know better how a king ought to behave than Bathsheba and how to select a godly woman how could master even know which she would know from her mistakes she would learn from her mistakes that right we know she knew better she should not have been bathing on top of a house right next to the king's house she knew better than that right we knew this so she who better to teach and instill this who low and have a burden in their heart to keep this son in those things of God than Bathsheba and then read for that Bathsheba saw David's sons trying to take over the throne multiple times she saw all David's previous sons try to kill each other right she witnessed that they're all because partially because of her fault of her sin so who better to try to warn the next generation if it is Bathsheba than a woman who would know how a king ought to behave and how to select a godly wife amen it's striking to me Church this this Bible is inspired it's inspired now look at this here whoever the mother was she took time to teach Solomon or Lemuel these things I noticed let's go look at verses 2 to 9 we'll probably have just enough time to baby preach this now look at verses 31 to our chapter 31 verses 2 to 9 this is the mother saying to her son the future King look at verse 2 the Bible says what my son and what the son of my womb and what the son of my vows so it seems the king's mother if this is Bathsheba made vows to God for a son this reminds us of Hannah's prayer for vow for a son isn't Hannah known as one of the most god-fearing women in all of Scripture year after years she went to the house of God being mocked and made fun of you don't have any children you don't have any children and she just kept praying year after year I want to bring forth seed I would have I want a son I want to be a blessing to my husband and she endured the criticism for year after year after year and finally she makes this vial that we don't see anywhere else in the scripture if you give me a son I'll give him back to you she was willing to lose the very thing that she wanted why because she wanted the reproach taken away she wanted everybody know that I'm a mother I brought forth fruit and I brought forth an heir to my husband's name Amen see it was about it wasn't just about honoring yourself that's not what it's about it was about honoring her husband and passing on the godly seed line amen the joy of the Jews was seeing the next generation raise up and serve God they didn't want the name of their husbands to die or end that was the joy to see the next generation so if she had no seed and she didn't do her part in bringing forth the next generation so she's willing to give up anything Lord I'll even give up the very gift you give me if you can let me bring forth fruit for your name amen show us other women it's hard to find women in Scripture that have that much sincerity before God and the best part was she kept her vow she didn't make a promise to God and forget about it she she kept that word amen so this was Bathsheba think about think about if this was Bathsheba her and David let's say they just had their baby died David's crying there in the temple you know he gets up after he gets the news of it if this is mishima at some point she got on her knees and say Lord don't let me be childless I promise you give me if you give me a son I promise I'll teach him the prophecy of a godly king and a godly wife amen if that was Bathsheba think of how powerful that is of God teaching this woman who made an awful mistake the importance of prophecy character the next generation and the Word of God oh the this is the son of my vow so this was personal with this mother God gave me this God gave me this child as an answer to my prayer I hope every mother in here feels like that whether you vowed for your children or not I never made a vow for all seven of mine I never made a vow but I do make a promise to God that I'll raise them in the fear and admonition of the Lord and because of that because it this this shout means so much to me this is the this is what I wanted this was my heart desire I will keep my word and I'll let this child be raised in your word Lord amen the son of her vows in other words she wasn't playing games with parenting God gave me this child I promised God I would teach this child all these sayings about a woman and the prophecy and a king I promised God if he gave me a son for a king I'd raise his king in the fear of the Lord God help us to have hearts like that ain't now raise this child the right way I'll do the right thing because God has blessed me with this child hey man that's a godly woman hallelujah look at verses 3 to 7 remember the very first thing she says if this is Solomon which it may be it may not be the very first thing he warns a future king is having a lustful eye with women verse 3 give not thy strength unto women do not pour all your energy into filthy websites don't pour your free time into dirty magazines dirty movies do not pour your energy and strength into that that's her first warning remember she vowed this to God I will tell him not to do that if you give me a son nor thy ways to that which destroy earth Kings this is pretty powerful you know who the Destroyers of Kings have been down through the scripture the Bible said adulterers were the Destroyers of Kings that's what the Bible says polygamists were the Destroyers of kings let's read that Deuteronomy 17 17 so you got it I think I preached that maybe a couple years ago I can't member God had clearly told all the kings you do not multiply wives unto yourself it will ruin you and so Solomon just went I'm the king I'll just go right over the top of that I can do whatever I want I'm the Big Shot see how we got to stay humble church no matter how gifted we are no matter how many blessings God bestows upon you we're never above the word we've always got to be under the word humble to the word there is no compromise with the Christian you've got to be uncompromised to obey the word of the Lord because you'll reap what you sow look at verse 17 17 17 neither shall you multiply wives to himself that his heart turned out away neither shall he greatly multiplied to himself silver in his gold and it shall be when he sitteth on the throne of his kingdom that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests of the Levi it shall be with him and he shall read therein all the days of his life read your Bible every day Solomon wrote man said read your Bible every day and the church said God told the King make a fresh copy the Bible have it written out before you every single day amen church let the word be fresh let it be freshly written upon our hearts every single day praise God if you didn't read your Bible this morning you should have Amen now God understands if there's every now and then you know when there's trouble or something like that the child sick or something like that but we were Kings today men we're kings and prays to God right now and Kings are ruling over sin the world Satan the devil and we've got to have a fresh copy the word written right before us written upon our hearts every morning and every night we do it in our house every morning every night right now we're on page 128 in the church age book I think we're trying to read three pages a day just we're letting the Holy Spirit use that book and write it upon the the hearts of the children by the grace of the Lord that's sheep food to me I don't know about you that's sheep food to me glory it is verse 19 and it should be with him and he shall read therein all the days of his life that he may learn to fear see as you go over the scripture again I don't care how many times you read the Bible keep reading the Bible because you it will teach you to fear the Lord to keep all the words of Islam these statutes to do them that's why I love reading the Old Testament the Old Testament gave so many examples of cause and effect if the King does this this happens if the King does this this happens it's so beautiful that's what proverbs shows a lot of to us as well and we know Paul taught it whatever you sow that's what you're gonna reap praise God but this is the destroyer of Kings adulterers polygamists and lastly dominating females that's what this mother this godly mother of the future King was trying to instill don't give your strength to women because they will destroy your kingdom and of course this is evil women their queen no sweeter woman than a real Holy Ghost field sweet crush woman praise God and that's what get to next week she's the greatest blessing you could have absolutely the greatest blessing a man can have outside of salvation is what a godly wife because member what did dominating female what did Jezebel do she stirred up King Ahab to do evil the Bible said he was a king but she stirred him up which means enticed him eluard him put thoughts in his mind that weren't the right thoughts so this this is what she's saying women will destroy Kings if the Kings don't surround themselves with a proverbs 31 woman amen it's exactly right and church were kings and priests unto God and program taught us that you know evil spirits any spirit of idolatry is an ID I'm sorry adulterous spirit so if you idolize money if you idolize preachers to idolize your husband idolize your wife idolize your children anything that's more important than obeying the Word of God becomes an idol and that's a spiritual spirit of adultery can I say like that I wish I could say a little better that's all I could say there and this is what we're told we got to be careful every spirit that we receipt of to make sure that that spirit is proved by the Word of God that's right prove all things are you still proven all things or do you let things slip in your house we ought to make sure everything that comes in our house is godly everything in our life comes in is holy prove all things the Bible says amen we don't want to be destroyed as kings we want to reign as kings we want to flourish as kings now I got a little bit more to go here let me said timer I'll try to close that usually preach an hour half on Sunday morning I just can't do that I wear myself out wear you out so I set the timer I'll try to be faithful to the timer here now the next thing she says verses 8 and 9 let me go back there actually I didn't read verse 4 it is not for Kings Oh Lemuel oh yeah this is the wine section I'm sorry I didn't put that in my notes but we can read it verse 4 it is not 4k lemme weld is not for Kings to drink wine nor for Prince's strong drink but she warns him by prophesy do not give place to drinking alcohol don't get mixed up with wine right lest they drink and forget the law see that the effect of drinking wine you forget the word of God you lose your ear your restrictions you riilu you lose your self-control when you start drinking wine too much and you forget the word of God and it perverts judgment of any of the afflicted so see wine will draw you a it'll make you more selfish because you stop thinking about the afflicted all you think about is yourself and this is the wisdom a mother is going to give to her son who's going to be king don't get mixed up with women wrong women and don't get mixed up with wine this will destroy a king faster than anything else look at verse 6 now she this is a sarcastic statement just so you know this is not this is not saying like oh we need to go give alcohol to people in the hospital so this is sarcastic is that there's a lot of sarcasm in Hebrew poetry give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish and wine unto those that we have heavy hearts so every time we see somebody struggling we shouldn't say oh you need to have some wine you understand what I'm saying here this is sarcastic she's telling their son let the sinners have the wine that's in other words we let them deal with wine but you're a king you're ruling you cannot pervert your judgment you've got to judge things the right way let them have their wine if that's what they want to have let them have their wine but you've got to forsake that you've got a commission from God you're a leader amen glory you're not a follower you're a leader in righteousness everybody looks to the king right everybody looks to the pastor everybody looks everybody looks so that the father the family the patriarch the grandfather everybody looks to the leader and so don't let yourself become selfish where you forget about others don't let yourself give your two things that are not godly stay true to God's Word look at verse seven see let him drink and forget his poverty and remember his misery no more now God doesn't want God doesn't delight in people getting drunk to see where they're just using sarcasm here just let if the sinners do that just let them do that look at verse eight now here's where I get to have a little few notes on this as king the king the leader the man he's the one who's got to open his mouth and plead the causes of the of the people who don't have much he's got to open his mouth this is the wisdom that she vowed I'll tell the King to do I'll tell my son to do this if you give me a son open your mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction so anyone that's going to be destroyed anyone that's going to be killed open your mouth for them if they have no voice open your mouth for them if you see someone who's going to be mistreated and they have no voice you're a man of leadership you're a man of power you've got influence open your mouth don't keep silent don't let the innocent perish open your mouth and say something amen don't be a right that's what she's telling her son don't be a be a man stand up for people who are being persecuted say something about it amen she vowed to God she would tell this to the next generation the next generation will have a king who will stand there and he'll plead the cause of the afflicted and what's that look for us what's it look like for us if we know somebody's hurting let's speak up let's tell tell the deacon tell brother Adam tell me let's help them out by God's grace I don't care if it's your neighbor I don't care if they're the rankest sinner let's get some help for the people who need help because you never know when your kindness will be returned to you you never know when your kindness will cause somebody to be saved we don't see it a lot but we can't give up hope and act like it won't do something we've got to be Jesus with skin on amen stand up for people that are being mistreated stand up for him and our day a lot of it's children children get mistreated and know if they don't have a voice they don't believe him well somebody hurt me or somebody we don't believe them all come on nonsense no but be a voice for the afflicted and the church said be a voice this is what a man needs to be a voice to those who are less fortunate don't hold back don't keep silent don't get it start drinking it or go to women to forget about these voices hear the voice of the afflicted and do something about it remember that's what faith does faith in James chapter two if you see somebody cold say have a warm night and if you don't get them a coat you don't have any faith right Church if you're there hungry and you say I'll have a good night hope you get some McDonald's but you don't get them any food then you don't have any living face that's some real gospel preaching right there that's right faith X faith does something with the knowledge that it has praise God now this seems provide prophetic as well as I wrote up there Salman later asked the Lord for wisdom and judging Israel it's wouldn't this be powerful if Bathsheba sat down and said honey you're gonna be king someday you've got to judge the people the right way you can't treat your friends better than these old people you can't treat your favorite friends better than than these these poor beggars on the street you've got to treat everybody and Solomon there are going to be thousands if not millions of Israelites and they're all going to look to you for judgment I don't know about you let make me pretty nervous if I was a four or five year old boy the next generation rests on you and all of Israel is going to look to you to rule like a man I don't know about you but that prize stick with me in fact it did when I was raising up I was really good at sports God just gave me that I'm not bragging I don't have nothing it don't mean nothing at all it just nothing but the point is my mom as she saw me get newspaper articles and state championships she always told me she said Jesse of whom much is given much is required and so that kept me from doing a lot of evil things and I was a sinner in high school I think it saved dogs 19 but as she planted those seeds in my life I never forgot she was basically telling me that God has blessed you with gifts live the right way because you're gonna influence a lot of people and she planted that in my heart I'm so glad for a godly mom that will plant the word in a child's heart amen this is prophetic if this was Bathsheba and Solomon this was prophetic because Solomon was later going to ask this he said give your servant see now he sees himself as I'm just a servant of God I'm not some big bad King that knows everything just give your humble servant give me an understanding heart to judge thy people that I may discern between good and bad for who is able to judge this by so great a people as he was watching his dad David rule you know he'd see people coming I imagine Solomon you know I don't know how I judge that dad huh you know he'd probably probably the sin of many court cases not sure how to judge this and he would watch day after day court case court case court case court casing there's a lot of people in Israel there's a lot of problems in our church and the church said or if you got a lot of problems in your home what I'm saying is that Nomad problems always going to be there we just need the wisdom the judge right and wrong and that should be such a burden on our heart it should humble us and say god help me just to be a servant I'm just your humble servant use me to let the truth rule over the lies use me here that that that good is exalted over bad help me to never justify wickedness help me to never a criminal criminalize obedience but help me to always exalt wisdom and exalt truth that you might be glorified who is able my dad wasn't exactly able he made mistakes there's times he made mistakes David made mistakes who can judge all this people if you give me one thing God give me the spirit of this give me wisdom to judge your people and we know God did because here he stands up for harlots remember remember his mom said you stand up for the unfortunate you stand up isn't isn't the scripture inspired he said you stand up Simon you stand up for the afflicted and hear this mother right she didn't lay on her baby it was the other harlot she laid on her baby the baby died so this harlot switched the babies and now she's loose gonna lose her baby and Solomon we know the story says fine we don't know whose baby this is let's cut it in half and the the evil heart said fine cut in half and the real mother said no don't hurt my bait don't hurt the baby give it to the other woman and Solomon said give her the baby because she delights in life she's the real mother got some real mothers here this morning amen that delight in the life of their children and the only life of that we really need is the life of Christ amen the Bible said all Israel heard this judgment and they feared the king for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to do judgment amen in that beautiful church the mother said you need to judge righteously and here years later sama has given any choice take any thing you want in this kingdom and he says give me judgment let me judge this people the right way and God blessed it God blessed it and because of this I got five minutes I'll try to keep my word here by God's grace I always try to keep my word let's look at verse 10 we'll just uh proverbs chapter 31 verse 10 who can find a virtuous woman for a price is far above rubies the heart of her husband does safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil look at verse 12 she will do good and not evil all the days of her life now let's let's look at first of this acrostic poem this poem who can find a virtuous woman in verses 10 to 31 is an alphabetic acrostic this means each verse use the different Hebrew letter the alphabet now here's where I get into the spiritual blessing of this when describing this rare valuable woman it requires the entire alphabet from A to Z and that beautiful this is a type of Christ's character Tommy no brother branham said Jesus is the A to Z so if Jesus is the A to Z he's got to have a wife who's A to Z as well praise God amen she's not just in their word from a to L that's half I'm not just in the word a to L I'm all the way from A to Z praise God from beginning of the book to end of the book I want all of Christ all of his character all of his love all of his wisdom all of his power I want all of Christ's character in me the Bible never said he is the Alpha and Omega the A to Z which means that he is the A to Z the all of it he's everything the Almighty the Rose of Sharon Lily LaValley the bright morning star the righteous branch the father son Holy Ghost he is God Almighty God one God Christ is everything from A to Z he is the word his bride will have the same word character as her Lord will prove that by the scripture I'll be happy to so long to Solomon for seven thou art all fair this is Solomon describing his first wife thou art all fair my love there's no spot in the you're a glorious church without spot or wrinkle you're washed in the blood of the Lamb amen this is how Christ would ascribe his wife she's just like him she has his righteousness and like our Albert Barnes said these this is just a Hebrew this is the Hebrew alphabet right in order from there A to Z their alpha to Omega what both of em say make no mistake about it a person that's truly baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ receiving the fullness of the Spirit not just an anointing for a little time but the fullness of the Spirit will be in the word all the way this is the evidence not a guess so not a hope so not a thing so this is the proof of being baptized with the Holy Ghost Judas failed multitudes fell right there they fail to go on in that word and their names are taken off the book of life we've all we've all experienced it we've all come in the message really excited how many can say amen to that I came in really really excited really really zealous you could ask my wife but that's not enough that's not enough in fact the true proof of a Christian is that they keep going deeper into the Word of God they don't let up and take a few years off well I'm just not going to get much out of service if you're not getting anything out of service it's your own fault well I take it back it could be that the preachers fault sorry it could be the preachers spot to forgive me because he could be off the word then it's his fault but then you got the responsibility to go correct him praise the Lord let me balance that out of it there's my timer say it let's stand I better close I'm just gonna keep preaching but let me just say that let me just say that by God's grace if we are not growing in Christ it is our own fault because Jesus said come to me all you that are weary and heavy-laden out give you rest of the souls he said li he said learn from me because I'm meek and lowly in heart if we're not even feeding on the Word of God it's because we're prideful because when you learn from Jesus you must become meek and lowly like him you think you know more about it than the preacher or in the preachers case the preacher thinks it's his like he's the one feeding the people it's not the preacher it's Christ if Christ can get that preacher anointed and give him his thoughts through the word then the word comes forward to you and I and were to receive it as the word of the Lord but church this is where faintly this is where people fail like honest in a spiritual idea all of us right now we we would say we've left Egypt how many could say amen to that I've left the things of the world I am NOT a slave to the things of the world like I used to be but we've got to make sure we keep going on until we cross over Jordan amen and then when we get in Jordan we got to drive out every one of our enemies every one of the Giants must be driven out you must go further in the word until you take your predestinated or we say inheritance that land of your inheritance you must keep going until you can say this was promised to me this is my inheritance I've driven out the enemies and here I stand I'm ready to live in the grace of God amen I'm ready to live in my predestinated purpose in life I've left Egypt I've left my addictions I've left the slavery of sin I've crossed over I been circumcised I've been born again glory but now you got to fight the Giants off amen and you do that by putting the word first you know the Lord next time next Sunday by God's grace we'll look at the two defining attributes of a proverbs 31 woman we didn't get to it today but Lord willing we'll get to that next week by the grace of the Lord how many one to be in the word all the way Church oh I want it with all my heart we are brother Lords if you'll come to the piano we all get tired you know I never thought my zeal would run out but I found my was my I get low odor my zeal is runs out sometimes in other words I've got us like the Bible said I've got to stir up my zeal again you've got to stir that up again by the grace of the Lord stir up the gift of God that's what Paul told Timothy stirred up just give yourself wholly to the preaching holy to edification and exhortation and doctrine give yourself wholly and stir it up make it fresh again how many what the Word of God to always be fresh to them amen let's pray for that today by God's grace if anyone has a special prayer of course you're welcome to come to the altar but let me pray for you that God will keep you keep me always stirred up let the word of god always be fresh to us this morning Heavenly Father we thank you for your mercy and grace this morning we're so grateful for the Word of God this prophecy that a mother wrote down for future generations Oh God hallelujah I believe it's for this generation the culmination of the 7 church age --is this Gentile bride she's got a fit Christ character perfectly Oh God will not do this by our grace or by our efforts or by our ability but we'll do it by your hand of mercy by your grace by your will by your strength not by our might or by power but by the Holy Spirit of the Lord father we want to be in the word all the way you saw the hands ever raised Lord my hands are both up Lord I want to be in the word all the way Lord stir me up Lord stir the people up loss or every heart and soul who wants to be stirred up for you would just stir them up this morning may they be like the Bible said as king sitting on a throne may the word of God a fresh copy a fresh expression of the Word of God may it be manifest before their eyes every morning and every night hallelujah when we pick up our Bibles in the morning or our Bibles at night may it be like the Holy Spirit is freshly written this it's like brand-new and it's written upon the tables of our hearts Lord God or that's what I feel like it's been as I've read through proverbs again Lord now I'm going through my second time through it Lord spend fresh like oh I forgot about this oh this is so
