[3:31] for um each person who's sick in the
[3:35] church I think our our family is

[17:06] six 7 and 8 of course you're welcome to
[17:09] read along with me if you'd like by
[17:11] God's
[17:13] grace acts 8 vers 5 6 7 and
[17:19] 8 verse 5 says then Philip went down to
[17:23] the city of Samaria and preached Christ
[17:25] unto them and the people with one Accord
[17:28] gave heed unto those things which Philip
[17:30] spake hearing and seeing the Miracles
[17:32] which he did for unclean spirits crying
[17:36] with loud voice came out of many that
[17:39] were possessed with them and many taken
[17:42] with paes and that were lame were
[17:45] healed and there was great joy in that
[17:48] City let's have one more word of prayer
[17:50] Heavenly Father we just ask God uh now
[17:53] that we've come back to the Heart of
[17:54] Worship Lord God that you would use this
[17:56] part of worship the preaching of your
[17:58] word to strengthen our faith Lord God
[18:01] and Lord just guide me uh to preach your
[18:03] word I want to be instant in season and
[18:05] out of season whether I'm preaching in
[18:07] the church outside in the parking lot
[18:10] Lord or here in my own home Lord we I
[18:12] want to be yielded to you Lord so may
[18:14] each person on the live stream be
[18:16] yielded to the Holy Ghost we ask it in
[18:18] Jesus Christ's name amen you can have
[18:20] your seats if you'd
[18:27] like
[18:29] we're looking at Acts chapter 8 I have
[18:31] uh my notes up here on the screen so
[18:33] I'll be referencing these uh part 8 of
[18:36] the supernatural book of Acts church
[18:39] I'll set a little timer here just to
[18:40] kind of give me an idea how long I've
[18:43] gone
[18:47] here just want to say again we really
[18:49] enjoyed the fellowship on Sunday and um
[18:53] the wonderful food all the sisters and
[18:55] brother Vang made there U by God's grace
[18:57] in the time of a communion uh a little
[19:00] announcement there I did put the next um
[19:03] communion
[19:05] time uh on the
[19:07] schedule uh I think I can look at that
[19:10] uh yeah look at that now so we have
[19:12] Dennis McBride on January 21st Lord
[19:15] willing Saints that's the Sunday I might
[19:17] be down in Junction City January 21st I
[19:19] did text brother Dennis about that
[19:22] brother Irvin in Junction City asked me
[19:24] to come preach so um I definitely want
[19:27] to help them out and it would just work
[19:29] out I wouldn't have to invite another
[19:30] guest preacher um I could just go down
[19:34] and preach on January 21st and then
[19:36] brother Dennis could preach for the
[19:38] Saints here in akan so uh that's the
[19:40] January guest Ministry brother digs I'm
[19:43] sorry brother Ben Nado will be here on
[19:44] February 18th Lord willing then brother
[19:47] Diggs March 24th and the new one I put
[19:49] on there was the Lord's Supper March
[19:52] 31st uh we'll do the 3 pm uh communion
[19:55] service there by the grace of God
[19:58] um you know we were talking with some of
[20:00] the Saints today on in text and perhaps
[20:02] you know some of the germs got spread
[20:04] during uh communion on Sunday night or
[20:07] maybe during the meal you know on uh
[20:10] Sunday so we'll have to uh just uh keep
[20:14] a reminder you know that uh next time we
[20:16] have communion if anyone is sick or just
[20:19] coming off of sickness perhaps we'll do
[20:20] the separate cups we could easily do
[20:22] that for communion brother brandham did
[20:24] that of course just because of the size
[20:25] of brandham Tabernacle but um just in
[20:28] the effort not to spread
[20:29] germs um that could be a good option as
[20:34] well and then also you know I was also
[20:36] mentioning this you know um if someone's
[20:39] sick or just recovering from sickness um
[20:42] you know if you're still battling the
[20:43] sickness it probably be the best idea to
[20:45] stay at home um in order to stop the
[20:48] spread you know of sickness over these
[20:51] 17 years of Pastor you know our family
[20:53] and I'm sure numerous families have
[20:54] gotten sick um when uh people that are
[20:57] sick are just overcoming sickness you
[20:59] know come to church unless of course you
[21:02] know the person believes are going to
[21:03] get uh immediately healed during the
[21:06] service because we know the church is a
[21:08] hospital and that's true um but there's
[21:10] also a balance to that um as as as we've
[21:14] seen you know over these 17 years and
[21:16] Cam's church has gone through it you
[21:17] every Pastor I talk to you know they go
[21:19] through I heard brother Brooks say it um
[21:22] if if you're not sure you have faith to
[21:24] be instantly healed in the service then
[21:27] it's probably a good idea to stay home
[21:29] especially with you know colds and flu
[21:31] and perhaps Co or something like that so
[21:33] just something to keep in mind there U
[21:35] by the grace of the Lord and uh to seek
[21:37] the leading of the Holy Ghost uh with
[21:40] that then also April 27th Lord willing
[21:43] we'll have a singing concert with
[21:44] brother Brooks and brother Brooks will
[21:46] preach for us on April
[21:48] 28th so I believe that's most of the
[21:51] announcements there uh by God's
[21:53] grace okay so let's take a a a moment
[21:56] here we'll preach on uh Acts chapter 8 I
[22:00] have my notes up here on the screen my
[22:01] Bible here in front of
[22:04] me I'm going to turn that little screen
[22:06] off that was playing the uh Heart of
[22:09] Worship okay so just briefly reviewing
[22:11] part seven we looked at how uh uh the
[22:14] first three verses of Acts chapter 8 um
[22:18] Paul was the chief persecutor of uh the
[22:21] church at the beginning uh but God's
[22:24] grace was rich upon
[22:25] Paul and uh God was very gracious to
[22:29] Paul and then you know we saw how uh the
[22:32] persecution scattered the early church
[22:35] and some people might have thought that
[22:36] was a bad thing but actually God used it
[22:38] for his glory god was able to start more
[22:40] churches in other cities and of course
[22:43] that we learn a great principle there
[22:44] God uses
[22:45] trials um persecution in order to spread
[22:48] the word of God and we just saw how you
[22:50] know God spread all the six or seven
[22:53] preachers that used to be at bible
[22:55] Believers en Lin when brother Brooks was
[22:56] pastor and now we're all spread out all
[22:59] separate except Cam and Simon are
[23:00] together there by God's
[23:03] grace so here let's look at um the next
[23:05] verse you know we went down to verse uh
[23:08] four and then we'll pick up here with
[23:10] verse five uh by God's grace so verse 5
[23:13] says then Philip went down to the S city
[23:15] of Samaria and preached Christ unto them
[23:18] now the first thought we get here is
[23:20] Samaria remember Samaria uh was a city
[23:23] that was despised by the Jews in
[23:25] Jerusalem and many of the other areas in
[23:28] Israel because Samaria had a lot of
[23:31] inhabitants that were half Jew and half
[23:34] Gentile and so we see that in John
[23:36] chapter 4 um Jesus went to the woman at
[23:39] the well in Samaria he had a need to go
[23:41] to her um and remember her worship she
[23:45] you know her worship with the Samaritans
[23:46] was different than we say the Pharisees
[23:49] there in uh Jerusalem and so Samaritans
[23:53] of course were despised the Good
[23:54] Samaritan Parable gives us that insight
[23:56] as well but I love this the Holy Ghost
[23:58] fell in Chapter 2 on Jews only and now
[24:02] the Holy Ghost begins spreading next to
[24:06] Samaritans and of course this is the
[24:08] great teaching brother Brown brought us
[24:09] where Peter was given the keys to the
[24:11] kingdom uh by Jesus he first took that
[24:14] spiritual key and the key was faith in
[24:16] Jesus Christ and the water baptism in
[24:18] the name of the Lord Jesus
[24:20] Christ uh and that baptism brother Ram
[24:23] says unlocks uh Salvation in heaven
[24:26] right there's power in the name of Jesus
[24:28] Christ so faith in the name of Jesus
[24:30] Christ that Faith
[24:32] unlocks uh the door of Salvation
[24:35] Allelujah the Bible calls it Jesus also
[24:38] called it the key of knowledge in the
[24:39] gospels I don't know that scripture
[24:40] memorized but I know Jesus said it um
[24:43] the key of knowledge so the knowledge of
[24:46] the name of Jesus Christ unlocks that
[24:49] blessing of Salvation and
[24:52] deliverance um and then of course you
[24:54] know in Acts chapter 10 Peter would open
[24:57] uh well here we see Peter opening the
[24:59] door here to the baptism of the Holy
[25:00] Ghost we'll get to that here in Acts
[25:02] chapter 8 Philip does the baptizing here
[25:05] but then Peter has the baptism the key
[25:07] to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[25:09] then Peter again has the key to the
[25:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost there in Acts
[25:12] chapter 10 at the house of
[25:15] Cornelius okay so this uh section here
[25:17] is uh Philip ministering in
[25:22] Samaria all right and then verse five I
[25:24] want to bring out a few thoughts out of
[25:25] here again and notice he preached Christ
[25:27] unto them and I was as I was studying
[25:29] you know the thought came Philip
[25:31] preached Christ Philip didn't preach
[25:34] Peter Philip didn't preach John and so
[25:38] the same is true today you know we don't
[25:39] preach brother brandham uh brother
[25:42] bram's not God but yet he was God's
[25:44] Prophet right um nor do we preach any
[25:48] other man We Don't Preach Martin Luther
[25:51] or uh John Wesley or uh William Seymour
[25:55] although we believe they were men of God
[25:57] we don't preach them the authority is
[25:59] not in the man the authority is in the
[26:01] god the God man the Lord Jesus Christ so
[26:05] this gives us the idea as as wonderful
[26:07] as a man Peter and John were later God's
[26:09] going to use them in this chapter the
[26:11] emphasis of the preaching was Christ
[26:13] Christ means the anointed so as
[26:15] preachers we must emphasize the
[26:17] anointing of the Holy Ghost we must look
[26:19] for the anointing of the Holy Ghost in
[26:20] our lives in our homes in our churches
[26:23] that's what we need now we need the
[26:24] anointing of the Holy Ghost uh to heal
[26:26] the sicknesses in our homes by the grace
[26:28] of God God is faithful
[26:32] Hallelujah and friends you know we get
[26:34] this idea he preached Christ so he
[26:37] preached the power of Jesus Christ uh
[26:39] and demons are not subject to any man
[26:42] but Jesus Christ because he because uh
[26:45] Philip comes into a demon infested area
[26:47] we'd say a area of high demonic activity
[26:52] territorial
[26:53] demons and we know this cu the scripture
[26:55] tells that you know that Simon the sword
[26:57] s were tormented them for a long time so
[26:59] this was a this was a demon stronghold
[27:02] but I love how God sends one man in
[27:04] there Hallelujah one man goes in there
[27:06] as begins tearing down the demon
[27:10] strongholds so uh demons are not subject
[27:13] to any name but Jesus Christ but
[27:15] remember demons do know the name of true
[27:18] men of God that use the name of Jesus
[27:20] Christ remember acts
[27:22] 19:5 the sons of ska tried to cast out
[27:25] demons in the name of Paul Paul and
[27:27] Jesus and the demons said we know Paul
[27:29] and Jesus but we don't know
[27:31] you um so we get the idea there that
[27:35] demons know the real men of God who use
[27:38] the name of Jesus Christ to drive them
[27:41] out and so we want to live a life so
[27:44] close to to Christ that demons have to
[27:47] recognize our prayers and the times we
[27:50] speak the word of God how we need God's
[27:52] grace for that every hour we want to
[27:54] live true to God we want to live
[27:55] faithful to God so then God can move in
[27:57] our service Services God can move
[27:58] outside the services in our homes and so
[28:02] we want to have such faith and such a
[28:04] Pure Life uh like Paul did where demons
[28:07] would know our names demons would know
[28:09] we serve the Lord Jesus Christ the
[28:11] Living God hallelujah I want to read a
[28:14] few quotes from Brother brandom the
[28:15] power of God
[28:16] 1955 brother Bram said have faith in God
[28:19] notice he didn't say have faith in me he
[28:21] said have faith in God oh my how the
[28:23] devil has to recognize the supreme
[28:25] authority of Jesus Christ not me so
[28:29] again what a great reminder for all of
[28:31] us just like Philip was preaching Christ
[28:33] not Peter not John he was preaching
[28:35] Christ so brother Ram said the devil
[28:38] doesn't have to recognize me he has to
[28:39] recognize the supreme authority of Jesus
[28:42] Christ he said not me he hates me he
[28:45] don't have to mind me but he has to mind
[28:47] who I represent he has to mind who sent
[28:50] me here hallelujah so we must keep that
[28:53] in mind uh we we often feel unworthy and
[28:56] of course we we are we are we're not
[28:58] worthy the only way we're Worthy is our
[29:00] souls are are uh are anointed with the
[29:03] Holy Ghost we're forgiven right and
[29:05] Christ makes us worthy Hallelujah the
[29:07] soul never sin in the first place but
[29:09] our flesh and mind sin daily so our
[29:11] flesh and mind not worthy but the soul
[29:13] is worthy by the grace of God because
[29:15] the soul cannot sin the scripture says 1
[29:18] John
[29:19] 3:9 I like what brother Ram says here
[29:21] Satan has to mind the believer when he
[29:24] is using the authority that Jesus G gave
[29:27] to the church remember he gave the
[29:29] authority to all the Believers in Mark
[29:31] chapter 16 lay hands on the sick and
[29:33] they shall recover so tonight uh if
[29:35] someone's sick in your home lay hands on
[29:37] the sick they shall recover by the grace
[29:39] of
[29:40] God and remember that Satan has to
[29:43] recognize the authority of Jesus Christ
[29:46] not our Authority so we come against
[29:48] Satan in the name of Jesus
[29:51] Christ here's another quote from 1964
[29:54] the identified Christ of all ages uh
[29:56] June 17th
[29:58] brother R's praying he said now Satan
[29:59] you cannot hold these sick people any
[30:01] longer they are subjects of the word of
[30:03] God come out of them the sickness that's
[30:05] in their body torment them no more let
[30:08] them go free from tonight on we as a
[30:11] Servants of God that has been identified
[30:12] to confirm the word adjure thee in the
[30:15] name of the Living God Jesus
[30:18] Christ so we have the power to adjure
[30:21] Satan in the name of Jesus Christ he's
[30:23] the word made flesh Among Us come out of
[30:26] the sick people and let them go
[30:27] for the kingdom of God's sake and the
[30:30] Commandment given us by Jesus Christ the
[30:33] son of God Amen so friends we have that
[30:36] Authority we confess our sins and then
[30:38] we have the authority to adure Satan for
[30:41] the kingdom of God's sake for the glory
[30:42] of God so let's remember that tonight by
[30:46] the grace of God because we have the
[30:47] Commandment from the Son of
[30:50] God now also on this idea of preaching
[30:53] Christ I want to just say a few things
[30:54] about that wonderful quote Simon used uh
[30:57] from brother brandom he ended the
[30:59] service with it trying to do God a
[31:01] service from
[31:04] 1965 um brother brandom said so say I in
[31:07] the name of Jesus Christ don't you add
[31:09] one thing don't take put your own ideas
[31:12] to it you just say what is said on those
[31:13] tapes you just do exactly what the Lord
[31:16] has commanded to do don't add to
[31:19] it okay so um it's a beautiful quote
[31:24] again this shows the authority brother
[31:25] Ram had as a prophet he's saying some of
[31:28] the same words Moses said in Deuteronomy
[31:31] chapter 4 and we'll read that in just a
[31:34] moment um but the point I want to make
[31:36] to our church is um I use this quote in
[31:39] a video I did three or four years ago
[31:42] called not every word on brother Ram's
[31:44] tapes is thus sayth the
[31:45] Lord um and that's because um the
[31:48] brandom Tabernacle currently and some M
[31:51] message churches message preachers
[31:53] famous ones use this quote and both both
[31:56] groups groups say the tape Church
[31:58] movement and this uh the prideful
[32:01] message ministers movement both um both
[32:05] use this quote to say that the tapes are
[32:09] are the absolute okay so the tape
[32:11] players and then the preach some of the
[32:12] preachers say the tapes are the absolute
[32:15] and they go as far as saying every
[32:16] opinion of brother brandom is a
[32:17] Vindicated opinion because he's a
[32:19] Vindicated Prophet well that's wrong
[32:21] he's a Vindicated Prophet for sure but
[32:24] he said if my opinions aren't with the
[32:26] word of God then take the word of God
[32:28] not my opinions and then with his
[32:30] opinions he said I could be wrong so we
[32:32] see a prideful spirit that would say
[32:34] every opinion of brother brandham is uh
[32:37] a Vindicated opinion that's not true but
[32:41] um I want to just read a few points here
[32:45] about this uh quote so this this quote
[32:48] is spoken in the name of Jesus Christ so
[32:50] it's a very serious author authoritative
[32:54] statement but it's not but it doesn't
[32:56] mean what these two groups are
[32:58] saying uh it doesn't mean we can only be
[33:01] parrots and only say what the tapes say
[33:03] uh that's a form of idolatry that's
[33:05] exalting brother brandom equal to God or
[33:08] Christ and so we will not take that
[33:10] Spirit of idolatry we rebuke that Spirit
[33:13] In Jesus Christ's name
[33:16] Hallelujah um so we don't want to
[33:18] misunderstand this quote uh second uh
[33:21] brother random is just repeating what
[33:23] Moses said in Deuteronomy 4 1-4 and then
[33:27] 25 and 26 the charge was not to add or
[33:31] to diminish God's word God's word that
[33:34] Moses commanded them not every word
[33:37] Moses
[33:38] said and Moses was right when he said
[33:40] this God's people should never add or
[33:42] take away from God's commands and that's
[33:44] of course according to Proverbs 30:5 and
[33:47] 6 and for the New Testament Believers
[33:48] revelation 22 18- 19 so I want to read
[33:52] that Deuteronomy 4 here I'm going to
[33:54] keep my spot if you have your Bibles you
[33:56] can go there Deuter om
[34:04] 4:1 and now that I'm thinking about this
[34:06] would be a good uh scripture to
[34:07] highlight and make notes in my new Bible
[34:10] there um to remember brother Ram
[34:13] repeated what the prophet Moses said
[34:15] here and there was a quote brother Ram
[34:17] said thus sayith the Lord he said the
[34:18] spirit of Moses will be in this brandom
[34:21] Tabernacle within a certain number of
[34:22] days so I do believe that prophetic
[34:25] anointing uh was on brother brandham for
[34:28] a certain time period no doubt cuz here
[34:30] he's using he's actually using the same
[34:33] words and the same warning as Moses of
[34:35] course brother Bram had two signs just
[34:37] like Moses had two
[34:40] signs okay so Deuteronomy 4 1-4 now
[34:43] therefore hearken o Israel unto the
[34:45] statutes and unto the judgments which I
[34:47] teach you for to do them that you may
[34:49] live and go in and possess the land
[34:51] which the Lord God of your fathers
[34:52] giveth you you shall not add unto the
[34:55] word which I command you neither shall
[34:57] you diminish from it that you may keep
[34:59] the Commandments of the Lord your God
[35:02] see so Moses was saying you got to keep
[35:03] the Commandments of the Lord that he
[35:05] gave to
[35:07] them uh which I command you verse three
[35:10] your eyes have seen what the Lord did
[35:12] because of B peor for all the men that
[35:14] fou Bor the Lord thy God ha destroyed
[35:16] them from among you but ye that did
[35:18] cleave unto the Lord your God are alive
[35:20] everyone of you this day we'll go down
[35:24] to verse 25 when thou sht beget children
[35:27] and children's children and ye shall
[35:29] have remained long in the land and shall
[35:31] corrupt yourselves and make a grave in
[35:32] image or the likeness of anything and
[35:35] shall do evil in the sight of the Lord
[35:37] thy God to provoke him to anger I call
[35:39] Heaven and Earth to witness against you
[35:42] this day that ye shall soon utterly
[35:44] perish from off the land where Uno you
[35:46] go over Jordan to possess it ye shall
[35:48] not prolong your days upon it but you
[35:50] shall utterly be
[35:52] destroyed so brother Ram uses this to
[35:55] warn uh this generation ation now we're
[35:57] three generations since brother brandham
[35:59] you you had brother bram's children
[36:01] their children and now their
[36:03] grandchildren so for example brother
[36:04] Ram's son Joseph has grandchildren so
[36:07] we're three generations and so brother
[36:10] Ram using this uh this scripture where
[36:13] they utterly perish it's either a
[36:14] spiritual application uh which is
[36:16] spiritual death through the Antichrist
[36:19] the pale horse rider or or to
[36:21] application of uh death writing the
[36:24] payor writer writing during the Great
[36:25] Tribulation period or could be both
[36:27] could be a mixture of both but again
[36:29] brother R uses the same warning and
[36:31] remember it's the word which the Lord
[36:33] thy God
[36:35] commanded okay so and understood
[36:37] correctly this so say I in the name of
[36:39] Jesus Christ quote means we do all the
[36:41] bible-based commands brother brandom
[36:43] gave us that originated from the Bible
[36:46] and we don't add to the Bible's
[36:49] commands uh this statement cannot mean
[36:52] Christians should only say the exact
[36:54] words recorded on the audio tapes of
[36:56] brother brother brandham brother Bram
[36:58] was trying to say what Moses said in
[37:00] charging the people to obey God's word
[37:03] Moses did not mean for Israel to only
[37:05] say his every single word uttered from
[37:07] his mouth he only meant for Israel to
[37:09] keep all the commands of
[37:12] God okay so hope that was a blessing and
[37:15] then you know I I just made a list the
[37:17] other day I reminded myself a list of
[37:18] all the proofs brother Brandon was a
[37:20] prophet um there's six verses that uh
[37:24] prophesied of his ministry to restore
[37:27] all things that were lost during the
[37:29] church ages second he revealed the 12
[37:33] New Testament Mysteries with six thus
[37:34] say the Lord's statements third uh eight
[37:37] doctrines he gave us with thus sayith
[37:39] the Lord uh fourth he gave us six
[37:42] fulfilled thus sayith the Lord
[37:44] prophecies that can be proven beyond a
[37:45] shadow of a doubt some healings some
[37:48] prophetic Visions uh they were all
[37:50] prophesied foretold beforehand on tape
[37:53] and then proven to be true afterwards I
[37:54] have a video on that uh fifth there's 14
[37:58] Pauline doctrines that brother brandham
[38:00] restored that most churches reject today
[38:02] proving those who receive those 14
[38:06] Pauline doctrines and keep all the other
[38:07] ones are the true bride of Christ which
[38:09] by God's grace We Believe were a part of
[38:11] that brother M's accusers like believe
[38:13] the sign John Collins um all these other
[38:17] ones they deny these Pauline doctrines
[38:20] most of
[38:22] them uh six and finally of course
[38:25] there's other reasons too but brother
[38:26] had many Supernatural healings and
[38:28] Supernatural discernments verified we're
[38:30] reading the book Generations and there's
[38:32] 38 people testify of repeated Visions
[38:36] brother Ram had that were thus say the
[38:37] Lord
[38:39] foretold um these people knew brother R
[38:41] was a prophet his his visions and
[38:43] prophecies never failed in their lives
[38:46] and that's what we believe too his
[38:47] prophecies and Visions never failed of
[38:49] course we don't understand all of them
[38:51] uh but we know they did not
[38:54] fail okay so again there certainly so
[38:57] much proof out there I've dedicated my
[38:59] life to it proving brother Ram was a
[39:01] genuine prophet of God and of course we
[39:02] see the main thing Jesus Christ is the
[39:05] same yesterday today and forever all
[39:07] right now getting back to acts
[39:10] 86 in my Bible here verse six says and
[39:13] the people with one Accord gave heed
[39:15] unto those things which Philip spake
[39:17] hearing and seeing the Miracles which he
[39:19] did so what I want to bring out in this
[39:22] place is that notice we have the same
[39:24] phrase hearing and seeing which is the
[39:26] same phrase in Acts 233 see and hear the
[39:29] Holy Ghost fell in Acts chapter 2 and
[39:31] you could see and hear it this is why
[39:33] brother Ram said wherever the Jesus is
[39:35] there's a lot of noise right wherever
[39:37] the Holy Ghost is there's a lot of noise
[39:39] now of course there's a balance you know
[39:41] be still and know that I'm God in the
[39:43] Psalms David said that um the still
[39:46] small voice but remember as brother Jim
[39:48] showed us you know when God showed up
[39:49] God caused the earthquake Wind and Fire
[39:52] but God's voice was in the Stillness and
[39:54] the quietness of speaking into Elijah's
[39:57] heart or maybe his Spirit we'd say but
[40:01] again they they took Heed These these
[40:03] Samaritans could not deny what they were
[40:06] seeing and
[40:07] hearing and those of us who are
[40:09] believers can all testify to that when
[40:11] we've seen God move when we've heard God
[40:13] move that that that moves us to pay
[40:17] attention to the message to pay
[40:18] attention to the Bible revelations God
[40:20] gave to brother brandham right and the
[40:22] ministry in akan and the ministry in
[40:23] Napoleon and the ministry in um field
[40:26] and albian and Iowa uh the the real
[40:30] saints of God we've seen and heard God
[40:32] move uh God moves unmistakably he gives
[40:35] us many
[40:37] testimonies uh proving that he's alive
[40:39] and well so we see that in the scripture
[40:42] God gives us Miracles and testimonies
[40:44] that people can see and hear like
[40:47] brother Ram said uh nobody can tell me I
[40:49] wasn't born again because I was there
[40:50] when it happened praise God each one of
[40:52] us uh saw it and heard it uh we've seen
[40:56] and heard the change that each one of us
[40:59] have gone through as we've grown in
[41:01] Christ and we had as we've had
[41:02] experiences in the Holy Ghost something
[41:05] you see in here like AAA said she wanted
[41:07] a Pentecostal experience well we got it
[41:09] Hallelujah she got it we saw it and
[41:11] heard it by God's grace along with many
[41:14] of the little ones as well by God's
[41:15] grace or younger ones I guess I
[41:16] shouldn't say little ones anymore now
[41:19] verse seven for unclean spirits crying
[41:21] with loud voice came out of many that
[41:24] were possessed with them and many taken
[41:26] with
[41:27] palsies and that were lame were
[41:30] healed so here uh the Samaritans saw
[41:33] these demon-possessed people
[41:36] screaming uh de when demons came out and
[41:38] then they were healed praise
[41:41] God beautiful testimony I've seen that
[41:44] as I said in Guyana Trinidad once in
[41:47] Pennsylvania uh I've seen that I think I
[41:49] saw in Iowa last time when I was out
[41:50] there the brother was screaming and
[41:52] crying and uh claimed to be free by the
[41:55] grace of God
[41:57] now PA is an interesting word I looked
[41:58] it up there in the Greek you know just
[41:59] to let you know it's someone who's
[42:01] weakened a relaxing of the nerves weak
[42:04] of the limb so when a a limb is weak a
[42:07] arm or leg or is weak it's a tottering
[42:10] it's feeble knees so um Phillip healed
[42:13] those that were having nerve problems
[42:16] limb problems feeble problems feeble
[42:19] knees feeble legs feeble arms Hallelujah
[42:23] and we've seen that on two occasions
[42:25] where women that are prayed for two
[42:26] women that couldn't move their arms and
[42:28] then one was I'm sorry one was instantly
[42:30] healed while I was preaching up there in
[42:32] Pennsylvania the other one um the sister
[42:34] went home and she was healed the healing
[42:37] struck her later that night by God's
[42:40] grace now notice many were healed not
[42:43] all so that's one thing to keep in mind
[42:45] you know the Bible said in Nazareth
[42:47] Jesus could not do many mighty works
[42:48] because their unbelief um so we see in
[42:51] this samarit uh Samaritan group there
[42:53] was it was a mixed crowd not everybody
[42:55] was healed but many were healed now
[42:58] remember Saints in some cases there was
[43:01] Believers and everybody was healed in
[43:03] the whole entire uh we'd say campaign
[43:06] right or the whole entire uh Revival
[43:08] meeting that's in and we already
[43:10] preached on this in Acts 5 15 and 16 um
[43:14] they brought the sick into the streets
[43:15] they laid beds on the couches this is
[43:17] right after the Holy Ghost fell some of
[43:19] them laid in the shadow of Peter uh and
[43:23] multitude came out unto Jerusalem they
[43:25] brought six F sick folks people vexed
[43:28] with unclean spirits and they were
[43:29] healed everyone so God sometimes will
[43:32] pour out such a powerful move of the
[43:34] Holy Ghost that anyone that comes gets
[43:37] healed and this was so different
[43:38] remember even from the days of Jesus uh
[43:41] remember that man
[43:43] uh uh I can't think of the water now the
[43:46] pool salom right uh the man and he Jesus
[43:49] said do you have anybody there that can
[43:50] take you down to the pool and he said no
[43:51] I don't have anybody to take me down
[43:52] there everybody passes Me by when the
[43:53] angel stirs the waters right so in that
[43:56] that case only one was healed right but
[43:58] God ordained that an angel Would S the
[44:00] water one person was healed but in this
[44:02] case it's such a powerful outpouring
[44:04] everyone was healed so may God grant
[44:06] that everyone in our church be healed
[44:07] soon for the glory of God we ask it in
[44:10] Jesus Christ's name Let each person be
[44:12] healed for the glory of God uh now verse
[44:16] eight and there was great joy in that
[44:18] city um and brother Ram told us the
[44:22] gifts of the Holy Ghost bring joy
[44:24] brother Ram said in Queen of Sheba
[44:26] 1960 he was talking about U the Queen of
[44:29] Sheba seeing Solomon's gift of
[44:31] discernment and wisdom and knowledge
[44:33] operate he said there's nobody can ever
[44:35] see God's gifts operate but what it
[44:37] Thrills them if they've got anything
[44:39] about God at all in them Hallelujah so
[44:44] that's the truth when Supernatural gifts
[44:47] are moving uh it it Thrills the believer
[44:50] whether you know we could start at the
[44:51] beginning with wisdom uh with knowledge
[44:55] uh with uh uh Faith
[44:57] Miracles uh tongues interpretation
[45:00] discernment uh prophecy that's eight of
[45:03] them I always forget one of them uh but
[45:06] anytime those operate we are thrilled
[45:08] right uh and the Bible calls it great
[45:10] joy so brother R could use the word Joy
[45:13] whenever we see God's gifts operate it
[45:16] brings Joy great
[45:18] joy and so remember the Jo joy of the
[45:20] Lord is our strength so that's why we
[45:22] should always pray for the minors God
[45:23] give us the major of Salvation the
[45:25] baptism GH but give us minors as well
[45:27] because these minors also bring
[45:30] joy and the freedom in the Holy Ghost
[45:32] brings Joy the gifts bring
[45:35] joy I want to bring a a a thought here
[45:38] about we must keep this Joy right um we
[45:42] need to we need to make sure the joy
[45:44] lasts and then if we lose the joy the
[45:46] Bible said restore the joy of thy
[45:48] salvation in Psalm 51 so we must make
[45:51] sure if we lose this joy we got to get
[45:54] this Joy back through repentance by the
[45:56] grace of God because we're going to have
[45:58] to endure seasons of Joy but also
[46:01] seasons of loss remember Ecclesiastes 3
[46:05] uh 1-8 has 14 different times and
[46:09] Seasons uh time to be born die plant
[46:13] pluck up kill heal so healing so healing
[46:17] there's Supernatural healing but the
[46:19] opposite of that is something that kills
[46:21] right something that
[46:23] torments we have to endure both seasons
[46:26] uh there's time to uh break down a time
[46:29] to build up so your health gets broken
[46:30] down but God will bring you Joy back and
[46:33] build you back up there's a time to weep
[46:35] time to laugh time to mourn time to
[46:37] dance Hallelujah time to Cast Away
[46:39] Stones a time to gather the stones a
[46:41] time to embrace a time to refrain from
[46:43] embracing a time to get time to lose a
[46:46] time to keep a time to Cast Away a time
[46:48] to Rend and a time to sew a time to keep
[46:51] silence and a time to speak a time to
[46:53] love and a time to hate a time of war
[46:55] and a time of
[46:57] Peace um so this thought just came to my
[47:00] heart you know um these Miracles brought
[47:02] Joy but no doubt uh Samaria was going to
[47:05] have to go through Seasons again uh
[47:07] Seasons where there wasn't Joy or Joy
[47:08] wasn't easy to come by and notice even
[47:12] Jesus tells us uh the trials will come
[47:15] to test your joy Jesus gives us joy but
[47:18] then he gives us uh he allows us to go
[47:21] through tests and trials to prove us and
[47:24] make our faith stronger
[47:27] right uh that's in Luke 88:13 let me see
[47:29] if I got that scripture handy Luke 88:13
[47:33] I thought I put it on
[47:37] here okay I don't see it so I will go
[47:40] turn to
[47:41] it so this is the rocky heart remember
[47:44] there's four grounds in the parable of
[47:46] the swer it's in Matthew 13 but also
[47:49] Luke chapter 8 so I'll read Luke 8:13
[47:52] remember the rocky ground was the second
[47:53] kind the first kind was the unbeliever
[47:56] uh this is the make believer this is the
[47:58] Judas es scariot who no doubt he had Joy
[48:00] at some time but eventually he sold out
[48:02] Christ let's read uh Luke
[48:08] 8:13 they on the Rock are they which
[48:10] when they hear the word receive the word
[48:12] with
[48:14] joy and these have no root for which for
[48:18] a while believe in a time of Temptation
[48:21] Fall Away now this is going to be very
[48:22] similar to what we're getting to uh I'm
[48:25] just realizing it now wow Simon the
[48:27] Sorcerer is like Judas of scarit as at
[48:30] least uh what we see in the scripture we
[48:31] don't know if he ended up repenting and
[48:33] being saved we don't know um but in
[48:36] other words he's like a person where the
[48:38] word of God fell on his soul he was H
[48:41] joyful for a while but then it got uh
[48:44] it's a time of testing came and of
[48:47] course Peter says he's in the gall of
[48:49] bitterness so we'll get to that here
[48:51] shortly but um Jesus says when the word
[48:54] comes it's receive with joy but then a
[48:57] Temptation
[48:58] comes okay and in the Greek a temptation
[49:00] is an experiment right we got to go
[49:03] through the experiment right like job
[49:05] God let job go through the experiment of
[49:08] trying his faith uh it's a trial it's a
[49:11] Proving Grounds temptation is a trial
[49:14] the trial of man's Integrity virtue
[49:17] constancy see Satan wants a test and see
[49:20] uh how virtuous are we how constant are
[49:23] we uh he wants to enti I us to sin or a
[49:27] Temptation whether we will rise whether
[49:30] we will obey the
[49:32] desires uh sinful desires it's an
[49:35] internal temptation to
[49:38] sin
[49:40] um it's sent it's allowed by God to
[49:44] serve to test or prove one's character
[49:46] Faith or Holiness so that's that's how
[49:50] every believer must must go through that
[49:52] experience if you receive the word of
[49:53] God if you ever receive God's word
[49:55] you'll be joyful but then the Temptation
[49:58] comes the test comes and we'll see that
[50:00] here uh with Simon the Sorcerer okay now
[50:03] verse
[50:04] 9 but there was a certain man called
[50:06] Simon which Before Time in the same city
[50:09] used sorcery and beitch the people of
[50:11] Samaria giving out that himself was some
[50:15] great one interesting look at verse n
[50:17] here um notice this witch now he's a
[50:20] male witch sorcerer but he's calling it
[50:23] he's calling himself the great one
[50:27] and Friends remember you know uh those
[50:29] witches from that Florida message church
[50:31] I was telling you about that were taped
[50:33] only people uh they were
[50:36] witches um they were making uh brother
[50:39] Ram's youngest son the great one they
[50:41] were making brother brandham the great
[50:43] one like every word of his tapes was
[50:45] thus sayith the Lord right which is
[50:47] idolatry right so we see this idea um
[50:51] that demons
[50:52] exalt someone as the great one other
[50:55] than than Christ right they they they
[50:57] want the worship off of Christ onto
[50:59] something else so Simon the Sorcerer had
[51:02] called himself the great one and now we
[51:04] see that same Spirit working today uh
[51:07] calling people the great one that are in
[51:10] our ranks or around our message we'd say
[51:12] the revelation of the Bible for this day
[51:15] calling someone other than Jesus the
[51:18] great one but there's only one great one
[51:21] that's the Lord Jesus Christ okay so we
[51:24] see these people that call themselves
[51:26] The Great one or uh call others the
[51:28] great one uh they're just lying right
[51:31] they're they're deceivers and friends
[51:33] you know I also thought of this um you
[51:36] know brother man was being humble a
[51:37] couple times and he said if I'm not the
[51:40] one to come to bring this Revelation uh
[51:43] for the end times there'll be a great
[51:44] one come after me of course but we know
[51:46] he was talking about himself right I
[51:48] made a video about this uh last year um
[51:52] and some some great ones that call
[51:55] themselves the great one to come after
[51:56] brother brandom um blasted me um they
[52:00] called themselves they actually said
[52:02] they're the great one to
[52:04] Rise um after brother brandham and what
[52:07] they did Saints they they created
[52:09] themselves they called themselves
[52:11] they're the great one they're the judge
[52:13] over the entire message and I've there's
[52:16] a man in Ohio who actually does
[52:18] that of course it's a lie and he says
[52:21] I'm the one to judge the entire fful
[52:23] Ministry and some of these great ones
[52:25] they call themselves great ones they
[52:27] don't even go to church they don't even
[52:28] have a
[52:29] pastor uh one of them is divorced they
[52:32] speak in tongues during their preaching
[52:33] and they never have any
[52:35] interpretation uh they don't follow
[52:37] Matthew 18:15 when someone sins against
[52:40] them or they feel like they're offended
[52:42] they don't go to that person
[52:43] individually they just blast them over
[52:44] the pulpit they just blast them over the
[52:47] uh the Youtube or rumble or whichever
[52:49] when they're on Instagram or
[52:51] Facebook so they don't follow the word
[52:54] of God in many other s Sins Of course
[52:55] that they uh they
[52:59] do um but remember Jesus said his true
[53:02] disciples would not make themselves
[53:04] Lords over God's Heritage but they would
[53:07] be examples under the people remember
[53:10] again a disciple is a
[53:12] learner so the preacher should be the
[53:14] the ones learning uh learning really
[53:17] humbly uh they should be leading and
[53:20] learning learning more about the word
[53:22] more about the message of the hour the
[53:24] preaching of brother more about his
[53:26] sermons they should be the ones leading
[53:28] in that by the grace of God and then
[53:30] remember they're also called ministers
[53:32] they should be the ones serving the most
[53:35] right not just with preaching but in
[53:36] other areas as well so we want to Humble
[53:39] ourselves as ministers we never want to
[53:41] Lord over people we want to Serve the
[53:43] People by God's
[53:45] grace okay now down to verse uh
[53:53] 10 but there was a certain okay okay
[53:55] verse 10 to whom they all gave heed from
[53:58] the least to the greatest saying this
[54:00] man is the great power of God so Simon
[54:04] the Sorcerer he deceived the people and
[54:06] notice they actually thought this was
[54:08] the power of God but it was actually
[54:10] Satan right in Simon the sorcerer's life
[54:13] and I thought this tied in well with
[54:14] what brother random said you know
[54:16] brother randam said some people believe
[54:17] Satan could heal but nine times brother
[54:19] Ram said Satan cannot heal right so
[54:22] Simon the Sorcerer was calling him said
[54:24] he was had that he had the power of God
[54:26] but it wasn't the power of God it was
[54:28] the power of Satan and of course no one
[54:30] was being healed uh that's what the
[54:32] scripture plainly
[54:33] says he Bewitched them which means let
[54:36] me look up the word bewitch which just
[54:38] astonish
[54:40] them okay I want to bring this out again
[54:42] you know brother R talked about how uh
[54:45] some people said uh you know sat or
[54:48] which doctors could heal remember
[54:50] there's three reasons uh why brother R
[54:53] may have said this remember we didn't
[54:55] get all the details from Brother
[54:56] braham's story some people thought um
[54:59] you know certain people got healed by
[55:01] going to wit doctor well there's three
[55:02] things I want to say remember uh Witch
[55:05] Doctors might have given out herbs that
[55:07] bring Divine Healing to people where
[55:09] they're healed over time of course that
[55:11] would uh the credit of healing would go
[55:13] to God right not to the witch doctor but
[55:16] the witch doctor just might have been an
[55:17] herbalist and known about herbs and been
[55:20] able to give them out a second thing is
[55:22] that the Devils uh might have made the
[55:25] people act like they were being healed
[55:27] when in reality they weren't and I've
[55:28] seen this in Guyana and Pennsylvania
[55:31] where the Devils made people made women
[55:34] pass out and made it look like they were
[55:36] anointed by the Holy Ghost but when I
[55:38] lean down to pray for them they kicked
[55:40] and fought and uh were very violent
[55:43] towards me and I learned to keep praying
[55:46] and lay hands on them to cast the demons
[55:48] out a third reason uh these people might
[55:51] have thought uh people got healed by
[55:53] going to Witch Doctors maybe the the
[55:55] witch doctor might have been like balum
[55:56] and had a genuine healing in Jesus name
[55:58] so maybe that witch doctor for a while
[55:59] stopped doing necromancy or um you know
[56:04] any other uh enchantments like balum did
[56:07] he he sought enchantments sometimes but
[56:09] then he sought the Living God sometimes
[56:11] well maybe the Witch Doctor that brother
[56:12] Brown was talking about that certain
[56:14] people saw maybe he or she stopped doing
[56:18] um you know uh demonic worship and maybe
[56:21] they humble themselves and approached
[56:22] God the right way and maybe God heard
[56:25] their prayers maybe the witch doctor
[56:26] prayed in the name of Jesus because he
[56:27] had a gift of Divine Healing like bam
[56:29] had a gift to prophesy we don't know but
[56:31] I just thought I'd bring that in there
[56:32] for verse 10 uh that you can see that
[56:35] that Simon the Sorcerer said his power
[56:36] was from God he didn't say it was from
[56:38] Satan he said it was from
[56:41] God um verse
[56:45] 11 and to him they had regard because
[56:47] that of a long time he had be bewitch
[56:49] them with sorceries so he bewitch them
[56:52] or astonish them so he could do de
[56:54] demonic Powers astonish people right I
[56:58] was just talking to brother uh was it
[57:00] brother Brooks or another brother that
[57:02] they'd seen demons rais people off beds
[57:05] I know brother uh Maxwell Le from Guyana
[57:09] has seen that and he rebuked the spirit
[57:11] in the name of Jesus and then the the
[57:13] body came back down to the ground and it
[57:16] was some other brother I was talking to
[57:17] this week as well had seen that but
[57:19] demons can do astonishing things but
[57:21] remember they only have as much power as
[57:23] God gives them and they all have to
[57:24] under the authority of the name of the
[57:26] Lord Jesus Christ we have to remember to
[57:28] breathe that holy name in prayer like
[57:29] when my wife just breathed Jesus Jesus
[57:31] when I couldn't breathe the other night
[57:33] Hallelujah and the name of Jesus Set Me
[57:35] Free Hallelujah brought back my
[57:38] breathing and notice it was a long
[57:40] season of demonic activity or oppression
[57:43] so they've been under this astonishment
[57:45] this torment for a long time so no
[57:48] wonder there was great joy when these
[57:49] demons were being cast out no wonder
[57:51] they were so
[57:53] joyful um this is likely what brother
[57:55] Brian remember our evangelist friend
[57:57] brother Brian this is exactly what he
[57:59] felt when he gave his testimony when he
[58:01] overcame the IGI board and Witchcraft
[58:03] books that he was dealing with remember
[58:06] he was uh he had great joy and that's
[58:09] exactly what they experienced here in
[58:10] Samaria they were had the Great Joy
[58:12] being we're free from uh guilt we're
[58:14] free from demonic uh possession and
[58:17] oppression we're free from all these
[58:18] things
[58:20] Hallelujah the Great Joy verse 12 but
[58:24] when they believed Philip preaching the
[58:26] things concerning the kingdom of God and
[58:28] the name of Jesus Christ they were
[58:29] baptized both men and women so here's
[58:32] another example of baptism both men and
[58:34] women were baptized and notice they were
[58:37] about the kingdom of God kingdom means
[58:39] ruler or Dominion the rulership of God
[58:43] and the name of Jesus Christ of course
[58:45] the kingdom of God is within you it
[58:47] comes in the name of Jesus
[58:49] Christ um they were baptized in verse
[58:53] 13 uh then Simon himself believed also
[58:56] and when he was baptized he continued
[58:57] with philli and wondered beholding the
[58:59] Miracles and signs which were done so
[59:03] notice real Holy Ghost Miracles will
[59:05] make witches Wonder they'll be they'll
[59:07] be astonished so the witches were
[59:09] astonishing the the tormented but then
[59:11] when the real Holy Ghost comes the real
[59:14] Holy Ghost makes the witches astonished
[59:16] wow God can set God can heal the py God
[59:19] can heal the lame God can heal the blind
[59:22] all these Mighty Miracles that the Lord
[59:24] Jesus Christ does remember Satan is not
[59:26] a Creator that's why these witches are
[59:30] astonished at the real power of God
[59:33] remember Satan's a Tormentor he brings
[59:35] fear not Faith Satan doesn't bring Faith
[59:39] he doesn't bring freedom he doesn't
[59:41] bring real Joy he doesn't bring real
[59:44] Victory and we can sense it right we
[59:46] have the we have the discernment of the
[59:47] Holy Ghost people can sense when there's
[59:49] real uh real Victory like I was talking
[59:51] to brother Irvin and he's been amongst
[59:53] other message churches and he said
[59:54] brother Jesse when I go there I don't
[59:55] feel the same thing I felt when I come
[59:57] to your church or when you come to
[59:59] preach I feel uh demonic activity I feel
[1:00:03] Spirits working and I said you're right
[1:00:04] brother I said there's very few message
[1:00:06] people that are actually born again
[1:00:08] because by their fruits they are known
[1:00:10] Jesus said so even he's now starting to
[1:00:14] see that there's torment in some of
[1:00:16] these message churches because the
[1:00:17] preachers compromise they're tormented
[1:00:19] with demons and so when they preach uh
[1:00:21] this torment comes upon the
[1:00:23] congregations a little Le leavens the
[1:00:25] whole lump so God help me God help each
[1:00:28] one of us to keep the leaven of sin out
[1:00:29] of our Lives continually confess our
[1:00:31] sins ask the blood of Jesus to forgive
[1:00:33] our sins cleanse us from all
[1:00:34] unrighteousness for the glory of
[1:00:38] God and friends as we see here this is
[1:00:41] the power and evangelist remember Philip
[1:00:43] is an evangelist this is the power this
[1:00:45] is not a pastor right this is not a an
[1:00:48] apostle this is not a teacher um this is
[1:00:52] an evangelist with the power of God this
[1:00:53] is not a prophet this is just an
[1:00:55] evangelist with the commission of God to
[1:00:57] preach the word of God with Supernatural
[1:01:00] signs and wonders
[1:01:04] following all right and then verse
[1:01:08] 14 and I think I remember now too yeah
[1:01:10] remember in Acts chapter 4 they went and
[1:01:12] after they got arrested the first time
[1:01:14] they went and prayed that signs wonders
[1:01:15] and miracles would be done well here's
[1:01:17] the answer to their prayer I believe
[1:01:19] this just one year later you know God is
[1:01:21] answering prayers let's keep lifting up
[1:01:23] the prayers May signs wonders uh and
[1:01:25] mighty Works be done in the name of
[1:01:27] Jesus Christ in our midst let's keep
[1:01:29] lifting up the prayers and we'll trust
[1:01:31] the same God who answered their prayers
[1:01:32] in the book of Acts to answer our
[1:01:33] prayers because we're the current book
[1:01:35] of Acts Church by the grace of
[1:01:38] God hallelujah now ver
[1:01:41] 14 um now when the apostles which were
[1:01:43] at
[1:01:44] Jerusalem heard that Samaria had
[1:01:47] received the word of God they sent unto
[1:01:48] them Peter and
[1:01:51] John okay so Peter and John come
[1:01:55] and then verse 15 who when they were
[1:01:57] come down prayed for them that they
[1:01:59] might receive the Holy Ghost so here we
[1:02:01] have a very interesting scripture uh
[1:02:03] kind of goes with what brother Adam said
[1:02:04] Peter James and John were Jesus's Inner
[1:02:07] Circle um but all that means you
[1:02:09] remember Jesus love them all to the end
[1:02:11] John Chapter 13 said we preached that a
[1:02:13] couple years ago when Austin came back
[1:02:14] and Lena Jesus loved all of them the
[1:02:17] same but Jesus could use Peter James and
[1:02:19] John in a certain ministry right because
[1:02:22] they represented faith hope and charity
[1:02:24] that was that was their Ministry Peter
[1:02:26] had all this Faith but he didn't have as
[1:02:28] much love right especially when it come
[1:02:29] down to the um when it come down to the
[1:02:33] Gentiles in Galatians Chapter 2 he
[1:02:35] didn't have as much love right U but he
[1:02:38] had a lot of
[1:02:39] faith and so here's what we see we need
[1:02:41] people that have gifts of faith and and
[1:02:43] John was the disciple of love so John
[1:02:45] had all this love Peter had all this
[1:02:46] Faith so faith and love were gifts that
[1:02:48] God could use for people to be born
[1:02:51] again of the Holy
[1:02:52] Ghost notice this wasn't pH Philip's
[1:02:54] Ministry look at this it's really
[1:02:55] powerful this wasn't Philip's Ministry
[1:02:58] for them to get the Holy Ghost this was
[1:03:01] uh John and Peter's Ministry to get the
[1:03:03] Holy Ghost so Philip's Ministry was to
[1:03:04] do signs Miracles and wonders cast The
[1:03:06] Devils out get them saved baptized
[1:03:08] Sanctified and then it was uh John and
[1:03:11] Peter's Ministry to pray for them to get
[1:03:13] the Holy
[1:03:15] Ghost and even brother brandom said this
[1:03:17] remember the sermon God hiding himself
[1:03:19] in Simplicity Albuquerque New Mexico
[1:03:21] brother random prays and I've gone
[1:03:23] through this numerous times but I'll
[1:03:24] probably go over it again for people
[1:03:25] seeking the Holy Ghost brother uh he
[1:03:29] kind of guides people to receive the
[1:03:31] Holy Ghost and he said four people reive
[1:03:33] the Holy Ghost during that
[1:03:35] shower he said praise the Lord he said I
[1:03:38] may not be a good instructor in this my
[1:03:40] Ministry is praying for the sick where
[1:03:42] is there a Pentecostal preacher or
[1:03:44] somebody a Pentecostal preacher raise up
[1:03:45] your hand what about this fell prayed
[1:03:47] for the sick went over here come here
[1:03:48] here's a man he said I was born out of
[1:03:51] season in the Pentecostal rank so he
[1:03:52] wasn't born in 1906 you know he wasn't
[1:03:54] there in
[1:03:55] 1906 remember the Revival lasted about
[1:03:58] 7even
[1:03:59] years um FF Bosworth was there he said
[1:04:03] uh I was born out of season but here I
[1:04:05] want this man here to pray for you I'm
[1:04:06] going to stand by his side God bless you
[1:04:09] brother okay then brother Brandon backs
[1:04:12] up this man's prayer he speaks in
[1:04:13] tongues he said if you let the Holy
[1:04:15] Ghost come upon you raise your hands
[1:04:17] then they go to praying brother B says
[1:04:19] be reverent now he's gone down to lay
[1:04:21] hands on people just be real reverent
[1:04:23] don't look around keep looking up
[1:04:24] looking up we'll keep praying keep
[1:04:28] praying brother BR said you take my
[1:04:30] place brother here you can explain it to
[1:04:32] them you know more about it than I do
[1:04:33] and look how humble brother Brandon
[1:04:35] was he said just come give it out they
[1:04:37] prayed for it and come to the altar now
[1:04:39] that's
[1:04:40] right he said now he said sir God bless
[1:04:44] you now you know how to do this better
[1:04:46] than me I'm going to stand here and pray
[1:04:47] you can give them more instructions so
[1:04:50] he look at this brother R's a prophet of
[1:04:51] God and it kind of fits this text
[1:04:53] perfectly but Ram says other people may
[1:04:55] have this ministry better than me for
[1:04:58] praying for people to get the baptism of
[1:05:00] the Holy Ghost just like Phillip called
[1:05:02] for Peter and John for people to come
[1:05:06] down and get the baptism of the Holy
[1:05:08] Ghost now Church let's apply this to our
[1:05:11] church right may God help each one of us
[1:05:13] to find our Ministries wouldn't it be
[1:05:16] great if we have people that are seeking
[1:05:18] the baptism of holy ghost at the altar
[1:05:20] and we can say brother so and so sister
[1:05:22] so and so come up here pray with this
[1:05:25] person so they can get the Holy Ghost
[1:05:27] you know we feel led to pray for the
[1:05:28] Holy Ghost now we've had that a few
[1:05:31] times at our church by God's grace
[1:05:32] remember brother Simon with brother amen
[1:05:33] and then I was there with brother amen
[1:05:35] and haua and Lydia um and different
[1:05:38] other ones you know over there in
[1:05:41] aoan so we want to get to the spot where
[1:05:43] we can recognize callings in people's
[1:05:47] lives um and you kind of see in your own
[1:05:50] life you know when you're sick or when
[1:05:51] you're hurting who do you reach out to
[1:05:53] who do you have confidence confidence in
[1:05:54] their prayers and so perhaps that's a
[1:05:57] person that God has used their gift
[1:05:59] numerous times that God's heard your
[1:06:01] prayer I know Jose often talks about my
[1:06:04] prayers and our prayers and um we want
[1:06:06] to remember that as well by God's grace
[1:06:08] but um it don't have to come the same
[1:06:10] person every time uh as we read those
[1:06:13] testimonies of brother brandom in the
[1:06:14] generation book each person was just
[1:06:16] like call Brother brandom come anytime
[1:06:18] there was a problem call brother brandom
[1:06:19] and almost it seemed like many of the
[1:06:22] times God heard brother rand's prayer
[1:06:24] so brother Ram was that Prophet uh where
[1:06:27] you could go to him with problems you go
[1:06:29] to him if you're sick and God healed so
[1:06:32] many of those people through brother
[1:06:34] Ram's prayers but brother Ram's gone the
[1:06:36] but the Holy Ghost is not gone we need
[1:06:38] the Holy Ghost and this is my prayer too
[1:06:40] as I said with Joshua you know God
[1:06:42] Vindicated Joshua in the eyes of the
[1:06:43] people and that's my prayer for everyone
[1:06:44] in our church may God vindicate you and
[1:06:47] your gift so we can have an idea or we
[1:06:50] can be led by by the Holy Spirit well
[1:06:51] this brother or this sister can pray for
[1:06:53] this or minister with
[1:06:55] that maybe you need a Word of Wisdom a
[1:06:57] word of knowledge maybe need prayer for
[1:06:59] Divine Healing or a
[1:07:00] miracle uh may God use us may we be so
[1:07:04] surrendered to God like a glove that
[1:07:06] Jesus's hand can get into where we can
[1:07:08] be used by God to help other people that
[1:07:11] are hurting especially during this time
[1:07:12] when we're sick and afflicted by God's
[1:07:16] grace all right uh verse
[1:07:19] 16 for as yet he was Fallen upon none of
[1:07:22] them only they were baptized in the name
[1:07:24] of the Lord Jesus Christ This is a
[1:07:25] powerful verse you have two um two
[1:07:30] Mysteries revealed here the mystery of
[1:07:31] the godhead with the water baptism is
[1:07:34] here because they weren't baptized in
[1:07:36] the titles Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:07:37] they were baptized in the one name of
[1:07:38] the father Son and Holy Ghost which is
[1:07:40] the Lord Jesus Christ so we have two
[1:07:43] Mysteries um that have a great
[1:07:46] Revelation right here in this verse they
[1:07:48] weren't baptized in titles it's the
[1:07:50] literal name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:52] and then the second one is the bapt AP
[1:07:54] ISM of the Holy Ghost and the three
[1:07:55] works of Grace there actually might be
[1:07:56] three mysteries in here
[1:07:59] um so here we see men and women and even
[1:08:02] a former sorcerer can be baptized in the
[1:08:05] name of the Lord Jesus Christ be
[1:08:06] repentant and saved but not born again
[1:08:09] the Holy Ghost has not yet fallen on
[1:08:11] them has not fallen on their soul now
[1:08:13] let's look at the Greek here with fallen
[1:08:15] so the Holy Ghost wants to fall upon
[1:08:17] your soul Hallelujah which means to rush
[1:08:19] on he wants to rush in your soul
[1:08:21] Hallelujah he wants to press upon your
[1:08:24] soul that's what the word means in the
[1:08:25] Greek he wants to lie upon he wants to
[1:08:28] come rest there it is he wants to rest
[1:08:29] the Holy Ghost is rest brother said the
[1:08:32] whole Christian Life is
[1:08:33] rest um he wants to uh embrace you fall
[1:08:38] back upon he wants to seize you he wants
[1:08:41] to take possession of you that's another
[1:08:43] definition I love all these
[1:08:45] definitions um he wants to cast upon you
[1:08:49] so these are all uh metaphors these are
[1:08:53] all uh symbolism of what the Holy Ghost
[1:08:56] wants to do he wants to rush upon your
[1:08:57] soul isn't that true he just comes upon
[1:08:59] you quickly praise God just like a rushy
[1:09:01] Mighty Wind Hallelujah there it
[1:09:04] is so the Holy Ghost had not rushed upon
[1:09:06] their souls but the Holy Ghost had
[1:09:08] convicted them to repent of their uh
[1:09:11] sorcery and fear of sorcerers and get
[1:09:15] baptized their sins forgiven heal some
[1:09:17] of their bodies I'm sorry many the Holy
[1:09:19] Ghost healed many of their bodies um but
[1:09:22] had not come upon Souls yet and they
[1:09:24] knew it he was not in my soul he's not
[1:09:27] inside of
[1:09:28] me U so this is an excellent proof again
[1:09:31] of the water baptism in the name of the
[1:09:32] Lord Jesus Christ the three works of
[1:09:34] grace and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:36] in the soul may God take possession of
[1:09:39] each one of our souls brother Bram said
[1:09:41] it will be a life if if Christ is in
[1:09:43] your soul it'll be a life uh that goes
[1:09:45] back to the word of God it appoints you
[1:09:47] to the word of God in every
[1:09:50] situation Hallelujah and I'm getting
[1:09:52] close here to the end uh let's see maybe
[1:09:54] 15 more minutes I'm down to about uh 8
[1:09:56] minutes left on my
[1:09:59] hour uh and we should be able to get
[1:10:01] done here uh in the8 minutes we'll see
[1:10:04] okay verse 17 I think we're going to
[1:10:06] pick up at then they laid their hands on
[1:10:08] them and they received the Holy Ghost so
[1:10:10] here we see um now brother brandom calls
[1:10:12] this the the the Jewish way to receive
[1:10:15] the Holy Ghost I'm not sure this is an
[1:10:17] official Doctrine okay because in our
[1:10:20] ranks brother Aman got the Holy Ghost
[1:10:21] with a hand laid on him right uh if I'm
[1:10:24] not I don't know if brother Aman was
[1:10:25] holding who his hand when she got the
[1:10:26] holy ghost or not I I don't remember
[1:10:28] that
[1:10:30] um but there's other people um the
[1:10:33] brother in uh the the piano player in
[1:10:37] Iowa when he got the Holy Ghost and he
[1:10:38] talks about that whenever I see him I
[1:10:40] laid my hands on him right but he's not
[1:10:42] a Jew okay so I don't know necessarily
[1:10:45] if this is an actual Bible
[1:10:47] Doctrine
[1:10:49] um but the point is brother Ram brother
[1:10:51] Ram makes a point and he says the he
[1:10:53] says the G Gentile way to receive the
[1:10:54] Holy Ghost is just to believe the word
[1:10:57] right but those of us who had hands laid
[1:10:59] on us we're
[1:11:01] Gentiles so just it's just an
[1:11:03] interesting thought brother he's trying
[1:11:05] to he's trying to find a pattern in the
[1:11:07] book of Acts right and in the uh also in
[1:11:09] the gospels as well but Ram said the
[1:11:11] Gentile way to receive the Holy Ghost is
[1:11:13] just believe the word but Ram said the
[1:11:15] Jewish way is to lay hands on
[1:11:18] someone all right um I know my wife and
[1:11:21] I when we got the Holy Ghost no one laid
[1:11:23] hand on us uh by God's
[1:11:28] grace now brother R gave two examples
[1:11:30] the Roman Centurion told Jesus just
[1:11:32] speak the word of God right and my
[1:11:33] servant will be made well Jesus didn't
[1:11:35] have to lay hands and he just had faith
[1:11:37] in the word and then the second example
[1:11:38] is the house of cornelus while Peter was
[1:11:40] preaching the Holy Ghost fell there it
[1:11:42] is seized and possessed on their souls
[1:11:44] rushed into their souls while the word
[1:11:46] of God was being preached H Allelujah
[1:11:50] um so Church the main thing you know
[1:11:52] let's not let let's not for those that
[1:11:54] are seeking the holy ghost or wondering
[1:11:55] whether we got it or not let's not get
[1:11:57] caught up well someone's got to lay
[1:11:58] hands or I just got to believe it when
[1:12:00] the word of God is being preach just
[1:12:02] press into it praise God just say it's
[1:12:03] for me just believe just serve God with
[1:12:06] all your heart soul mind and strength
[1:12:08] and if it's anything like when I got the
[1:12:09] Holy Ghost I wasn't expecting it Jesus
[1:12:11] said when the wind blows no one knows
[1:12:13] when it's coming right so we just grow
[1:12:15] in justification sanctification and when
[1:12:17] the wind blows it'll surely rush into
[1:12:20] our souls hallelujah amen amen all right
[1:12:24] uh now verses uh 18 now here's where we
[1:12:28] get to this character that's a lot like
[1:12:30] judas's scarit or the second ground the
[1:12:32] Stony ground but we don't I don't know
[1:12:34] the end of him I I didn't look in the
[1:12:36] histories and I know there's nothing
[1:12:38] else about him in the Bible verse 18
[1:12:40] when Simon saw that through the laying
[1:12:42] on of the Apostles hands the Holy Ghost
[1:12:44] was given he offered them money so Simon
[1:12:46] must have laid his hands on people and
[1:12:48] imparted uh spells on them or demons and
[1:12:52] church that's what I believe is
[1:12:53] happening in bethl and many of these
[1:12:55] other
[1:12:56] churches uh this Kundalini evil spirit
[1:13:00] cu the people are in literal pain uh
[1:13:03] when they're shaking and they're laying
[1:13:05] hands on them and of course these people
[1:13:07] become women preachers they false
[1:13:10] prophets they lie you every year they
[1:13:12] they predict things that happen before
[1:13:14] the year and they're always wrong um so
[1:13:18] I believe that's an evil spirit amongst
[1:13:20] churches today now of course we don't
[1:13:22] fellowship with those churches but just
[1:13:24] uh just so you know so what what I what
[1:13:26] I was bringing out about that is that
[1:13:28] the the these Jezebel churches aren't
[1:13:31] saying now you got to speak in tongues
[1:13:32] because anybody can speak in tongues now
[1:13:34] they want to have like a actual shaking
[1:13:36] experience or a passing out experience
[1:13:38] or some type of physical experience
[1:13:40] other than speaking in tongues and so
[1:13:43] they're imparting demonic anointings on
[1:13:45] people through the laying on of hands
[1:13:47] and how do we know because they deny the
[1:13:49] word of God they deny the water baptism
[1:13:52] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:13:53] they deny brother brandham uh on the
[1:13:56] serpent seed on the godhead all these
[1:13:58] scriptures all these doctrines that are
[1:14:00] thus sayith the Lord thus sayi the Bible
[1:14:02] they deny those so by their fruits they
[1:14:04] are known of course they believe in the
[1:14:06] Prosperity Gospel and all kinds of other
[1:14:09] lies um they have more leaven that that
[1:14:12] their Doctrine is totally leavened we'd
[1:14:14] say and it's undeniable they deny so
[1:14:17] many Pauline doctrines okay where we at
[1:14:20] here now verse uh yes verse 19
[1:14:24] yeah give me also this power that on
[1:14:26] whomsoever I lay hands that he may
[1:14:28] receive the Holy
[1:14:31] Ghost verse 20 but Peter said to him thy
[1:14:33] money perish with thee because thou has
[1:14:35] thought that the gift of God may be
[1:14:37] purchased with money I thought he was
[1:14:40] just saved and was baptized in water in
[1:14:41] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:14:43] now Peter saying you're going to perish
[1:14:46] so look how fast uh that seed can fall
[1:14:48] on a heart that's Stony and Satan can
[1:14:51] come by and uh
[1:14:54] you know he can tempt that person uh and
[1:14:56] it won't have any real root in it it
[1:14:58] won't have a real solid experience it
[1:15:01] can be joyful at first he was excited to
[1:15:03] see the Miracles and people really set
[1:15:04] free remember he looked wow look at
[1:15:06] these this is more power than I have but
[1:15:08] then Satan comes around and uh he's got
[1:15:11] that Stony ground he doesn't have a real
[1:15:13] solid understanding of the Gospel right
[1:15:16] and Satan takes that Joy
[1:15:20] away so he says thy money perish with
[1:15:25] thee now here I just want to bring this
[1:15:27] out again this is a excellent example of
[1:15:30] how someone can be saved and start
[1:15:32] getting anointed by the Holy Ghost but
[1:15:33] then lose their anointings on the
[1:15:35] stature of perfect man remember Faith
[1:15:37] virtue knowledge Temperance patience
[1:15:40] godliness brotherly kindness charity
[1:15:41] they can start getting some of these
[1:15:42] anointings like Faith uh it looks like
[1:15:45] Simon the Sorcerer didn't even get the
[1:15:46] virtue he didn't have a a public
[1:15:48] testimony that he could serve God right
[1:15:51] because soon soon as he sees the Holy
[1:15:53] Ghost
[1:15:54] uh can be given by laying on of hands he
[1:15:56] offers them money tries to buy a gift of
[1:15:58] God isn't it interesting that's money's
[1:16:01] very connected to him just like it was
[1:16:03] the balum balum money is what took balum
[1:16:06] to Hell basically uh the wages of
[1:16:08] unrighteousness second Peter 2
[1:16:12] says very very similar very similar
[1:16:14] interesting here and of course Judas
[1:16:16] sold out for money my goodness um again
[1:16:19] to show let's not be greedy for money
[1:16:20] let's be thankful for what God gives us
[1:16:22] but let's also be quick Qui to be
[1:16:23] generous quick to share by the grace of
[1:16:27] God um a lot of churches say you can't
[1:16:29] lose salvation you can't lose the
[1:16:31] anointing of course you can uh Jesus
[1:16:34] said that of course in Revelation
[1:16:35] chapter 3 that he'd blot their names off
[1:16:38] The Book of Life if they didn't overcome
[1:16:39] the wicked one or the Antichrist Spirit
[1:16:42] which remember went through uh Deeds of
[1:16:44] nicadan doctrines of nicadan doctrine of
[1:16:46] balam and then the Jezebel spirit so
[1:16:49] this Jezebel spirit had already
[1:16:50] anointing had already got on to uh Simon
[1:16:53] the Sorcerer right after he got saved he
[1:16:55] lost an anointing and the uh the Devil
[1:16:57] Comes upon him he loses this battle this
[1:17:00] temptation to want power from God
[1:17:03] without uh really uh getting Sanctified
[1:17:06] we'd
[1:17:08] say remember it's true uh people can
[1:17:11] lose their salvation in the first two
[1:17:13] steps of Grace if they forsake Grace the
[1:17:15] Bible said or they fail the grace of God
[1:17:18] or they sell out the grace of God or
[1:17:19] they are Cast Away uh from the grace of
[1:17:22] God remember I think I preached 13
[1:17:24] metaphors of losing Salvation cast away
[1:17:27] fail Grace all there there's so there's
[1:17:29] 11 more I can't remember them
[1:17:31] now
[1:17:35] um so uh Simon the Sorcerer at least had
[1:17:38] the anointing of faith on the statute of
[1:17:40] perfect man which also is called the
[1:17:41] sprinkling of the Holy Ghost according
[1:17:43] to 1 Peter 1:2 sprinkl Under The
[1:17:46] Obedience that represents being joined
[1:17:47] to the Covenant right but then you can
[1:17:50] forsake that Covenant just like the
[1:17:52] parable of so the word of God can be
[1:17:53] sewn in your heart but then the birds of
[1:17:55] the air can come by and snatch it out of
[1:17:57] your heart you can lose that and the
[1:17:59] Bible said you can believe for a while
[1:18:01] Jesus said they believe for a while but
[1:18:03] they didn't continue
[1:18:06] believing remember Peter said he was
[1:18:08] filled with bitterness now this
[1:18:10] bitterness in the Greek can mean a
[1:18:12] Bitter Root extreme wickedness so he
[1:18:16] went from extreme joy to extreme
[1:18:19] wickedness this extreme greed how can I
[1:18:21] I can pay money now where' you get that
[1:18:22] money from putting spells on people so
[1:18:24] that wasn't money that was even earned
[1:18:27] honestly so he went from extreme joy to
[1:18:29] extreme wickedness in a short amount of
[1:18:31] time this also means poison in the Greek
[1:18:34] or Venom think of a uh poisonous snake
[1:18:38] uh po venomous spider you know all these
[1:18:41] all these uh black widows all these
[1:18:43] things we don't want to come into
[1:18:44] contact with this is what happened he
[1:18:45] got he got free but then he uh lost he
[1:18:49] lost his anointing he he forsook this
[1:18:51] anointing in order um
[1:18:53] in order to try to get the power of God
[1:18:55] through money try to get the kingdom of
[1:18:56] God through purchasing it uh through an
[1:18:59] extremely Wicked way he thought he could
[1:19:01] buy it with money and you cannot buy
[1:19:04] God's blessing you cannot buy God's
[1:19:05] gifts with money either which is what
[1:19:08] they do at Bethal like I think we're
[1:19:09] were talking about this they have a
[1:19:10] school of prophets where you can pay
[1:19:12] money to become a prophet it's a bunch
[1:19:14] of
[1:19:15] Lies um you're born a prophet you either
[1:19:17] born a prophet or not born a prophet of
[1:19:20] course Mo most of these people aren't
[1:19:21] born to be prophets but same idea
[1:19:23] they're paying money just like Simon the
[1:19:24] Sorcerer they're paying money to try to
[1:19:27] become a prophet it's a lie from
[1:19:30] hell okay and then remember brother
[1:19:32] brandom said this too he said there's so
[1:19:33] many preachers that that are in the the
[1:19:36] trash
[1:19:37] Heap uh along the sides of the ladder of
[1:19:40] the Statue of perfect man we're on a
[1:19:42] we're on we're on Jacob's Ladder praise
[1:19:43] God Jacob's Ladder must be uh must have
[1:19:45] eight rungs on it right for each one for
[1:19:47] the stature the ver eight virtues in the
[1:19:49] stature perfect man brother said there's
[1:19:51] so many that fall off off they're
[1:19:53] climbing up the ladder and they fall
[1:19:55] off um we've seen so many ministers
[1:19:59] around the message are just Believers of
[1:20:01] the message fall off on the stature of
[1:20:03] perfect man like I said if they go into
[1:20:06] sexual sin that proves they never had
[1:20:07] Temperance or maybe they sold out their
[1:20:09] Temperance um if they uh let the women
[1:20:13] cut their hair that shows they never had
[1:20:14] the knowledge the understanding to know
[1:20:16] that this represents headship and this
[1:20:18] represents the word of God that I'm
[1:20:19] under God Christ and my husband and I've
[1:20:22] got to stay in my position I can't I
[1:20:24] can't exercise authority over my husband
[1:20:27] um it shows those women never had the
[1:20:29] knowledge or if they had it uh they
[1:20:31] rejected it they failed the knowledge of
[1:20:33] God they despised the word of God and
[1:20:35] the knowledge of God brother Ram says it
[1:20:37] in Statue of man he says uh he said but
[1:20:41] so many of us try to do the works of
[1:20:43] Christ before the reflection of Christ
[1:20:45] is in us now there's the trouble we find
[1:20:48] those things happening you know it I
[1:20:49] know it we see these stumbles along the
[1:20:51] road think of Judah think of Simon the
[1:20:54] Sorcerer we think of Anan and Safa we
[1:20:57] find the scrap heap of Ministers of
[1:20:59] Christians piled along the road is
[1:21:01] because they didn't go at it right okay
[1:21:04] so they they started climbing up the
[1:21:05] ladder then they stopped right they they
[1:21:08] didn't go all the way into Christ and
[1:21:10] that's how most of these people were
[1:21:11] that left the message you know all these
[1:21:13] websites and podcasts these people they
[1:21:15] never they never really love the Bible I
[1:21:18] I hear it on their testimonies they
[1:21:19] never fell in love with the Bible they
[1:21:20] just fell in love with brother brandham
[1:21:22] and then when the evil spirit comes
[1:21:24] around makes them doubt brother brandom
[1:21:25] they get mad at brother brandham so all
[1:21:27] the love that they had turns into hatred
[1:21:29] right just like with uh Tamar and amnon
[1:21:31] right this lustful spirit all it is is
[1:21:33] the evil spirit gets on people and they
[1:21:36] never fall in love with Jesus Christ the
[1:21:38] word we must love Jesus Christ the word
[1:21:40] with all of our heart soul mind and
[1:21:42] strength Hallelujah give everything we
[1:21:45] have for the Lord Jesus Christ and of
[1:21:47] course if we do that then we'll love
[1:21:48] brother Brandon we'll love the people of
[1:21:50] God we'll love our enemies we'll love
[1:21:51] the people that left the message message
[1:21:53] we love them and beg them to come back
[1:21:55] and come back to the Bible revelations
[1:21:57] that Jesus Christ revealed to his
[1:21:59] Prophet brother
[1:22:02] Brandon and just that's the same thing
[1:22:04] Paul said right Paul said many
[1:22:06] antichrists had already come out into
[1:22:07] the world and this was just maybe 20 or
[1:22:10] 30 years after Pentecost so that's the
[1:22:11] same thing we have today many Antichrist
[1:22:13] still going out uh slandering brother
[1:22:15] Ram slandering the message making uh uh
[1:22:19] disingenuous lies and presumptions about
[1:22:21] brother brandham
[1:22:23] uh and that the Bible says they're liars
[1:22:25] and and their Folly will be exposed
[1:22:29] Hallelujah now that was verse um the
[1:22:33] bitterness he said you're in the gall of
[1:22:36] bitterness yeah verse 21 thou has
[1:22:39] neither part nor lot in this manner for
[1:22:41] thy heart is not right in the sight of
[1:22:42] God he said repent
[1:22:46] therefore sorry I lost my spot here
[1:22:50] uh yeah they heart is not right in the
[1:22:53] sight of God repent therefore of this
[1:22:56] thy wickedness and pray God if perhaps
[1:22:58] the thought of thine heart may be
[1:23:01] forgiven thee and remember brother Ram
[1:23:04] said our thoughts are louder in heaven
[1:23:06] than our words on Earth but of course
[1:23:08] that's that's when we let our our
[1:23:10] thoughts come into words right we all
[1:23:12] have mind battles but we got to keep
[1:23:14] those mind battles uh we got to cast
[1:23:17] them out of our minds and not let not
[1:23:19] let those evil thoughts come out of our
[1:23:21] of our mouth or four out of our actions
[1:23:24] right we're all going to be tempted all
[1:23:25] the birds are going to fly by and try to
[1:23:27] roost in our mind but we got to we got
[1:23:29] to break the nest right we got to shoe
[1:23:31] the nest out and don't let those evil
[1:23:32] thoughts continue and say forgive me
[1:23:34] those thoughts Lord and then of course
[1:23:36] you know then God doesn't see our evil
[1:23:38] thoughts in heaven right they're
[1:23:39] forgiven by the blood of Christ and
[1:23:40] every believer's battled this down
[1:23:42] Through the Ages it's the greatest
[1:23:43] battle ever fought Hallelujah we get
[1:23:46] Victory by the spirit of
[1:23:50] Christ so Peter charges him to repent of
[1:23:53] the wickedness verse 23 for for I
[1:23:56] perceive that thou are in the gall of
[1:23:57] bitterness and the bond of iniquity so
[1:23:59] he went from being joyful free and
[1:24:02] joyful to coming back into bondage back
[1:24:06] into iniquity so he knew this was wrong
[1:24:08] he knew this was the wrong thing to do
[1:24:10] iniquity of course is uh
[1:24:13] lawlessness it's it's thinking well I
[1:24:15] don't have to obey God's word uh it's
[1:24:17] doing what you know is wrong you know
[1:24:19] you shouldn't do it but you do it anyway
[1:24:21] so he went so fast for being free to
[1:24:23] being back in
[1:24:25] bondage and I like what verse 24 says
[1:24:27] then answered Simon and said pray ye to
[1:24:29] the Lord for me that none of these
[1:24:31] things which you have spoken should come
[1:24:32] upon me isn't this interesting I thought
[1:24:34] as I was finishing up here Simon the
[1:24:36] Sorcerer wanted a man of God a prophet
[1:24:39] Peter to pray for him doesn't this
[1:24:42] remind you of uh the Philistine King
[1:24:44] aimc wanted Abraham to pray for him in
[1:24:47] order for his house to be healed the
[1:24:49] curse would come off his house and yet
[1:24:50] that one was Abraham's fault he didn't
[1:24:52] tell the truth right of course Peter did
[1:24:54] nothing wrong in this case but again we
[1:24:56] still see these
[1:24:59] uh these uh men and women the these uh
[1:25:03] men and women that are not uh as
[1:25:06] obedient as the real Servants of God
[1:25:08] like Peter and Abraham they're not as
[1:25:11] obedient although they have some level
[1:25:13] of respect for God but they got to go to
[1:25:14] the believer I'll say like this the wise
[1:25:16] virgin or the make believer have to go
[1:25:18] to the I'm sorry the foolish virgin or
[1:25:21] the make believer have to go to the wise
[1:25:23] Virgin uh and ask for prayer because
[1:25:26] they've got oil they've got a contact
[1:25:28] with God they've got the Holy Ghost so
[1:25:30] that's the thought I wanted to bring out
[1:25:32] here Abraham of course typed the wise
[1:25:34] virgin lot typed the foolish virgin so
[1:25:37] here we see uh Sinners and make
[1:25:38] Believers or foolish virgin they know
[1:25:40] who's really in contact with God they
[1:25:42] know who to go to for prayer remember
[1:25:44] job's three friends miserable comforters
[1:25:46] had have job pray for him and friends
[1:25:49] even when David numbered the people the
[1:25:51] thousand the people died but David did
[1:25:53] didn't die when David committed adultery
[1:25:56] and murder David didn't die should have
[1:25:59] of course he suffered for that but again
[1:26:02] God is rich in Mercy to the Saints who
[1:26:04] are really after the heart of God David
[1:26:06] really most of the time was a man after
[1:26:08] the heart of God and then he really
[1:26:09] repented when he did awful sins he
[1:26:11] really was sorry he really showed his
[1:26:13] sincerity and that's what we should do
[1:26:14] as Christians right and of course David
[1:26:16] was the type of the foolish virgin Saul
[1:26:18] was the type of the I'm sorry David was
[1:26:20] the type of the wise virgin sorry I'm
[1:26:21] just getting some these words mixed up
[1:26:23] here and Saul was a type of the foolish
[1:26:25] David was wise virgin type Saul was
[1:26:28] foolish virgin type and Friends it just
[1:26:31] boils down to this then God knows who is
[1:26:33] his God knows who's the wise virgin God
[1:26:36] knows who's the foolish virgin we're
[1:26:37] going to get to that of course in Romans
[1:26:38] 9 uh when when uh Paul takes us through
[1:26:41] the sovereignty of God God makes a
[1:26:43] vessel a certain way one vessel but he
[1:26:45] makes another vessel another way and God
[1:26:47] forn knows what they're going to
[1:26:50] choose um remember so these prophets uh
[1:26:53] in this case uh Peter Abraham job and
[1:26:57] David these were God's
[1:27:00] beloved these were his special ones
[1:27:02] remember in the Beloved in Greek means
[1:27:04] uh esteemed these are his dear ones
[1:27:06] these are his favorite these are his
[1:27:09] worthy of love and so we just again use
[1:27:12] the Bible words we don't call ourselves
[1:27:14] the favorites uh but we call ourselves
[1:27:16] those who have received the High Calling
[1:27:18] of God every Church knows it some people
[1:27:21] want the high calling of God they want
[1:27:22] to believe all the word of God they want
[1:27:24] to try to obey all the word of God and
[1:27:26] then there's others that just want to be
[1:27:28] saved they just want to live a
[1:27:29] comfortable life and uh they want to
[1:27:32] keep you know they want they want to
[1:27:34] keep uh at his comfortable life and not
[1:27:37] really uh selling out everything and and
[1:27:40] getting the oil like the wise virgin
[1:27:43] okay so this is the group that is the
[1:27:45] Beloved the favorite uh I'll call it
[1:27:48] like this maybe the best word is elected
[1:27:50] or chosen these are the chosen in Christ
[1:27:53] before the foundation of the
[1:27:58] world verse 25 and they when they had
[1:28:00] testified and preached the word of the
[1:28:02] Lord returned to Jerusalem and preached
[1:28:04] the gospel in many villages of the
[1:28:06] Samaritans so I love that um God does a
[1:28:09] great Revival in Samaria and then he
[1:28:10] goes to all the other Villages and then
[1:28:11] the Saints you know Peter and John of
[1:28:13] course Philip probably go back you know
[1:28:16] uh but go back to Jerusalem but notice
[1:28:18] the Revival continues on say that's what
[1:28:20] I've said there are six kind of revivals
[1:28:21] right
[1:28:22] um there's of course personal individual
[1:28:25] Revival there's National Revival uh
[1:28:27] there's the church age Revival um and
[1:28:31] three other oh there's a Brides Revival
[1:28:33] and two others well we have the leoan
[1:28:37] church age Revival of the baptism of the
[1:28:39] Holy Ghost right we have that
[1:28:42] Revival um by God's grace and it spread
[1:28:45] it spread from Lima to akan by God's
[1:28:47] grace and now we've got to keep it alive
[1:28:49] and look church now it's spreading to
[1:28:51] Junction City I've just seen it right
[1:28:52] there Hallelujah the Revival the Revival

[1:28:57] me to come down there and preach you

[1:29:01] know so the Revival is spreading and we
[1:29:03] got to watch how the holy spirit's
[1:29:05] leading and uh follow the leadership of
[1:29:07] the Holy Spirit to help this revival
[1:29:09] spread by God's
[1:29:12] grace so in closing I just want to say
[1:29:15] this you know I want um we want to learn
[1:29:18] from Simon the Sorcerer here we want to
[1:29:19] learn from James and John and Phillip we
