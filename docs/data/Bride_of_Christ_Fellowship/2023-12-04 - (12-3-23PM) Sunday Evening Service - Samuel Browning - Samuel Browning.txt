TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I just uh I love hearing the city the voices are just beautiful just the Glend I know there's a lot of Young Voices in there as well so don't anybody get offended but I just I I don't know I just oh my goodness I just so enjoy hearing that it's coming right through there from even this morning now God bless you you can you can tell you're s all your heart amen Beau amen is beautiful I just to to the devil take that a what a true treasure it is to serve the Lord hallelujah hallelujah to I don't even like to know on our way today we were looking and I was thinking remember church I remember a lot of things come back to me all thank you Jesus Hallelujah app of's word go app [Music] I'm always easy you know all time knows exactly that's why I'm thankful you know in the message of the Hour come it puts so many things in perspective yes and because God releases his thoughts to you and I and that even where the Prophet would take that in a message dedication he would speak of the church there in Ephesus and he would say that that church ofus he said people amen take that and the message there the message God's not interested inze right [Music] that's that some things they were trying to set up you know for debate and things like that said well you know it's got to be le 200 people you know that'll disqualify most of the New Testament Church you know there's been nobody available you know all and everybody else you know but it's incredible isn't it sometimes how know man always looks at at success and looks at things in terms of terms of numbers and in terms of buildings and things like that just heard the Prophet this morning on the way over he said you know he said here in America he said we we feel like as though that everything's okay if we bu a nice church' done this and he it's just such a deception because God God really doesn't care I God is interested in us he provides a building for us but the real reality is you and tabac hallelujah hallelujah you I are the place of the the House of Prayer place where God can commune a place where God can come and rest and lay his head find Solitude in this hour people that will receive him just welcome it's just such a blessing I just so appreciate those perspectivesj place for us we'll just continue to keep you in pray hallelujah hallelujah labor said now if I could just somehow bottle some of that stamina know once in a while to go back and take a sip of it maybe a new energy drink you know just we love you the Lord thank you thank you musicians yes amen I so appreciate you know one thing I also wanted to say this too I don't I'm sorry to keep you standing but you're fine I I thought of it and I don't know if I've actually mentioned this our home church when we had the youth meetings there uh The Joint youth meetings and things but I I looked up there on the platform and I saw you know our boys and see coming up and singing and I thought you know a lot of what people will know behind the scenes is this right here that's actually taking place right up there they used to do that in our basement yes sir they had their own little title in church call of nature church that's right but uh I thought I tell you what if there's anything or go from they went from there and it's just it's transferred right over Hallelujah we just so appreciate that and just getting in and I I love that those services like that I I love those un service just singing them just worshiping and so well I don't want to just keep you standing and we want to just get right into the word here hallelujah this evening if we could let's just go to the Lord in a word of prayer and go the scriptures here Heavenly Father Lord we so thank you Lord once again for your mercy and your grace to us Lord father truly War without you lord we can do nothing yes yes Hallelujah we need you Lord in every step of the way in our lives Lord You're our strength Lord God as David could write that what how he knew you to be in his life father we know you the same way you're the strength of Our Lives Lord we just ask that Lord that you would just Lord come here this evening Lord this afternoons would you just Lord speak to us once again Lord according to Father the needs in our lives that Lord that you would see Lord yes Lord what's upon your heart and your mind Lord I just have one request and that is Lord to be so hidden Lord behind Lord the cross that you would just Lord take control Lord just speak to our hearts what we have need of Lord what you see in our lives Lord that Lord we we would leave Lord from this service Lord should you ter that God we leave from these this moment Lord with us a greater determination Lord we leave Lord with more of you and less of us Lord hallelujah oh God where we leave Lord with a greater Assurance Lord I I'm certain Lord there'll be answers that you'll give to us Lord maybe Lord there won't be an answer but there'll be an assurance that'll come Lord to encourage us along the way so Lord you know what we have need of and we just invite you just to come and take Lord the full preeminence in this service Lord may you help us Lord to push back any tiredness or weariness Lord just for a few moments Hallelujah Lord just to give ourselves to you that you might just speak to our hearts now we love you and we thank you now father in the preci name of of Jesus Christ amen amen amen and I want to go in the scriptures here if we could to uh Revelations chap 2 and I'm just going to read two verses of scripture verse 12 verse3 let you be seated two vers of scripture Revelations 2 verse 12 verse 13 it says un to the angel of the church in pergamus WR these things saith he which ha the sharp sword with two edges I Know Thy words and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seat is thou holdest fast my name and Hast not denied my faith even in those days where an my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwelle may God bless you I'd like to continue to look at that here just a few moments I really thought I may be going just a little different way and this is changed here just but I want to just speak continue on that thought of the authority in his presence we am we spoke for a few moments this morning just how the Lord would take us on the presence of God just to see how how wonderful and how God will work with us in bringing us into his presence and the effects that take place as we enter into the presence of God you you see all the way down through the scriptures any any uh mortal any man or woman that ever amounted to anything to serve the purpose of God what do the difference in their life was when they got into the presence of God yes yes and that's that's when everything changed Hallelujah we find that when any time that one like Moses Moses looked at uh things that were before him he knew the promise he knew things that were promised he even knew what he had been spoken over his life but yet that had to be made personal to amen had to be quickened to him and when Moses god allowed him to come to that place of complete failure where Moses could look at himself and say I'm a failure and we know God actually God doesn't Delight in us coming or or saying that we're a failure but what God want desires to bring us to is to that realization that without me you can do nothing amen amen it's not God God has not called you and I to the word that then it's us going to take our human strength and somehow fulfill the word of God the Bible says in the book of Isaiah that even uh the youth would grow faint and weary so even those as young people that would have the stamina to press through yet it would not be enough to measure against the forces of Darkness against Satan Satan is there's all sorts of Deceit and deceptiveness and everything that's out there but you know you don't have to study deceit the only thing I think how brother BR would put it with Columba how Columba there would actually just take and study the truth because he believed for himself and the other Ministry he said if you'll just study the truth present the truth he said then it will give that discernment to discern the false Hallelujah so that's the whole thing is just like you've heard that over and over the prophet said you study the real dollar bill and then you're able to identify the Hallelujah so we see that that's where the truth itself it makes us free it brings us into a place of Liberty to stabilize us so that we're not walking uh even in fear and in Wonder uh we have we see the promise we see the scriptures that are laid before us that where the spirit even that is in the land the great spirit of deception but there's also if there's the spirit of deception that is here with the strength the Bible said when the enemy would come in like a flood then I the Lord will raise standard against it the spirit of Truth is so much more greater than the spirit of deception Hallelujah so it's God that is ever present to lead us in every in every part in every facet of life and I just want to just draw from this here just a a few moments and looking at this Authority in his presence because as he he spoke to the disciples uh even in the Book of Matthew he says in the very last part when he was commissioning them he says um lo I Am With You Always and so it was God's Comfort even how Paul would even come at the end of the book of Hebrews and Paul would would reach back in the Old Testament and bring that present tent that you know that to the Lord is my helper and how that God is here with me and you know I I will look to him he's my helper he's my strength and we have that promise that many times you can even feel as though we don't feel his presence but I want you to remember this the scriptures going along with that says the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them and deliver and remember there was a prophet by the name of Elisha one time when Gesa became unsteady in seeing all the surroundings but Elisha prayed and asked God to open gaza's eyes and the prophet would take us he says I don't believe the prophet seen those angels but what he had confidence in is the word so I believe that Elisha is the type of us as the bride it brings us to a place to where it's not always something that we have to see or we have to feel but God is so positions us with the faith in the word to say God said it that settles it amen hallelujah God's there to back it up and I believe that's where it brings us to that reality God God has said he'd be with us he'd never leave us nor forsake us then I I believe that we can rest on that as I heard brother Jesse say right before as I was coming out that we want to keep the Commandments of God we want to keep God's word we want to stay in step with God's word well if that's our heart's desire and we just want to to please the Lord then God Will Make A Way through every situation I'm and whatever more that's what we can be confident in is that desire because when it all comes down to the Victory and and the hour that we're living in in Psalms 27 I love how it comes to that place and it says regarding all the situations that was taking place around David David then could say this one thing have I desire and that one thing will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of to behold the beauty of of uh in his Temple to inquire of the Lord so in the midst of all of this David said this is what I'm seeking after Hallelujah this is what I want to be locked in on and you know just God help me to block out every distraction and to be locked into the beauty of of of your Holiness Hallelujah and I I look at this here in the midst of this Authority that is in his presence so his presence is right here is right here uh with us and I look at these group of Believers that here they were right there in in pergamus and here as he writes into there to this age notice where this says that they were dwelling they were there even where Satan's seat is now we recognize Satan's seat that's Babylon right and yet we know that Babylon itself it's no longer a physical thing we're looking right the Bible tells us in the Book of Revelations it's become mystery babyon because it switched from that of being the from that of being Pagan to that of being paple yes and we find the influence that's throughout it and babyon itself the very root of it it's confusion yes and you look at the result of it like things right now today as it is in the world it's come to the height of confusion yes sir it's come to a place of such deception and such uh deceitfulness that is out there and all of these Spirits there are working and it's working to draw people under that of that of of mystery Babylon it works throughout all of her religion it works throughout all of the doctrine it's working through so many different areas because all of this with mystery Babylon is tied throughout every bit of the world yes it's tied within Commerce it's tied not only behind church but it's tied in politics it's all the way through it's woven and there's an effect as a matter of fact when the scripture would pardon me would pick that up even when you look at it here is Rome a nation one of the few things that's recognized like that doesn't even have an army but yet has such control over things that go on in the world right brother right good everybody wants to know what's Rome going to say what does the pope say right and and they're looking for that of a significance and yet you see all of the effects that comes in throughout the world and I just want to say this to you God has called you and I to live in this hour hallelujah amen and not just live as to survive but God's called you and I to overcome Hallelujah and to say this God doesn't put you and I in a position that we would be defeated God puts us in situations that yes the obstacles look great to us we realize the obstacles are more than a match for us but they're not more than a match for the god greater receive that's you that's where our Reliance that's where we rely on because remember his presence that has come to your life is not something that has just come to your life and pulled off of your life but his presence is there dwelling in your life his presence is him it's who he is it is the spirit of God it is the word of God that is the presence of God and it's dwelling there in your life and here while they in in that of the pergamus age and these Believers were right there in Satan's seat but this very much so speaks even to you and I in this hour because remember here they were dwelling in a physical location here they were where Satan's seat had moved that transition had taken place but we understand that that of Satan's seat and all of that it's migrated clear to Hollywood right right brother right things that that started out then it moves to France well what was what were they going after what was it in France brother brand Trac this back and we can go back in history and see it all of the fashions that was coming out everything that was that was wanting to to come out and to pull upon on desires and you think of this uh it's it's not abnormal for for for a a woman for a lady for a young girl to want to look beautiful that's built within her but yet Satan likes to take things that are god-given desires but he wants to try to move upon that and pervert it right right brother because how Satan wants to come with that is is to try to put it that its beauty itself is something to wear that you know things that that that are made to be uh taken away from what is the real true beauty which is character draw things you know clothing and cause things to be accentuated or things to be drawn after and you see that's where Satan he started there with clothing then it made its way all the way down into the church it made it all the way down into so many areas to where the real focus is is no longer upon real character and yet that's what God seeks out Hallelujah God seeks for character let me say this what is character that God's seeking after when he when God found Rebecca character the prophet tells us was one who would stand still and listen to the message Hallelujah character isn't somebody that all starts out right up here or I'm not right no character is where the the the the the Simplicity and willingness just to submit to what God is saying and to be able to receive the word of God hallelujah and then out of that then that word begins to release that character that's on the inside and God's character of life is continuing to unfold things in your life to bring forth who you really are Hallelujah and so right in the middle of it in in what is taking place that here we see all around us all and I think how the prophet when he would say that uh Invasion and the invasion in the US and the United States and then in perfect strength and he would speak about how he said streams of demon powers that are coming out of Hollywood those phrases to me speak so much now because when he says streaming out of there and I'm looking at that and we think of this right now I remember where when I used to live I lived in a community was near Saline Ohio we actually was closer to Rockford is where I went to school near the Indiana border and I mean you know we could come up here to where the church was at and you would see certain candies in the store up here you wouldn't find them where I live you would see certain Styles up here they weren't down there but now we're living in a in a time to where that everything itself is become so globalized right that where you know it's went from do you have a computer with internet access to where now phones right and we have all of these images we find things that are are pressures that come our way and it's not just pressures among young people older people fill with pressures too they begin to feel pressures of I wonder why we can't have what's so so has or or maybe we could go to on a vacation like this you know and not not meaning anything evil but sometimes you get to looking at things but let me just say it like this everything is not always what it seems to be yes yes amen everything is not always what it seems to be but Satan's objective is to always get you trying to chase after something and trying to get you to to chase after it that's how it started to fall in the beginning he puts something there before Eve says oh if you only have this he was trying to promote something to her if you have this you become content there is no content within Satan's kingdom once you have this there'll be something else you have this fashion something else you have this style it'll be something else it's built to work upon that of the appetite but yet in God everything that God lays before you God lets you know I've already provided it for you and you have access to it freely and it doesn't devalue your life it adds value to your life Hallelujah best part of the authority you have in the presence of God is to where when Satan presents things to you on a daily BL basis you have access to the king of glory that you can bring these things before him and say Lord what do you say about this yes Hallelujah think of this if Eve had only said at that time when Satan was putting his spin on things and you know wanting to make it sound just right and show how many likes he had and how many posts he had and wanting to just really if she would have just said all of this seems very inspiring seems very moving but I want to hear what my father says that's right right brother if she' only waited that little bit that little bit of time you know sometimes the the the ways that we get into to the mistakes or the traps or the things that we come into is because we haven't waited that's one of the greatest qualities of the believer says wait on the Lord if you wait on the Lord you renew your strength yes there's never wrong with waiting on the Lord when there's things that are before us decisions and things that we have to make we we're living in a time that like the the Lord told the prophet he says don't get your line tangled up in these kind of times wow good good These are times that we want to be sure of our footing amen These are times that we want to know where we're stepping and and and going through because it's an hour of such deception that's all around but remember we're not to walk in fear God said I've not given you the spirit of fear but of power love and mind he's not given us a spirit of fear we walk around in bondage of do I trust this do I trust this that's where the whole world's at now it's come to such a place to where things that seem so simple where little things here and little things there and little and then people look around and say what's true what can I trust what what's true what's real what because why everything the way Satan is so worth things is to create such instability among people but yet in the midst of this hour God himself has brought a real stability upon I'm telling you what's been exalted is the Rock of Ages and I can can rest and come to rest on and know just like when they landed on Plymouth Rock through all of the perseverance where they had to come through God himself has provided a place for you and I a rock that we can rest on that declares to us this is a land of Freedom a land of liberty where you can really be who God has Hallelujah youve got Authority in his presence and here they were you know even when you you look at this of the scripture when it speaks of this with anthropus I uh this to me is always something very uh strong you know with this anpus with a faithful martyr I believe anpus was the one brother Jesse you correct me on this if I'm wrong but I believe antus was the wrong because I don't have it in front of me he was the one where they said oh antias uh the whole world is against you he said then I'm against the whole world Hallelujah believe I think I have another another file I'm if the whole world's against me I'm against the whole world Amen now think of it this this individual we have no other record of anything else that he ever done but there's one thing that God recorded about him God said he was a faithful martyr yes we don't know was he a pastor was he a de was the we don't know that that God just let you and I know that's irrelevant he yes amen what you be Hallelujah give everything you with on looking at well you Pastor you nakon or you this God that doesn't look at those things sure all of those things are put in the body they all have their purpose God works through those things but in the end when it's all said and done God is looking for faithfulness hallelu what God rewards his faithfulness if you operate and what God has called you I do that's why we got Authority in his presence Hallelujah Glory I think of this of how when brother randam points this out with this of of Satan seat and he speaks of how that in this time that these these these uh Believers in that time he says they were overcoming Satan right in the midst of his own throne room that's powerful statement yes sir they were overcoming Satan right in the midst of of his own Throne Room amen not just somewhere far off but right in the midst where Satan was dwelling all the influences was coming forth from there but here were faithful soldiers of the Cross who were overcoming right in the midst of Satan's seat Hallelujah I tell you there had to be and there was something greater inside of these men than just their intellect Hallelujah it was it was an awareness it was a reality where Christ was was moving and pulsating in their own life brother Bram Likens them to the Mighty Men of David who who dare to go down and to take there of a drink of and get a drink for David from The Well of Bethlehem these these individuals were overcoming we lives that were entrenched and overcome with things that uh you can even bring down the spirits that are are prevailing even in this hour all of the ungodliness but yet there was a word of light that those Satan strong room was right there there was a word that was able to break every hole break every CH deat we can say this sometimes I know we would like to say if I could just bring this situation to church but let me tell you something God has called you he's equipped you where you're at you can say Lord let me just stand as a faithful Overcomer at scho let me just stand as a Faithful over Hallelujah change a lot they were standing forth that of Salvation right there standing in that hour faithful in that time Glory they had Authority in his presence they weren't acting alone it was was the presence of God that was moving and pulsating there even within their lives so I I want to just say we we have that of anus that's here and these things that just press on my heart antus had a testimony in so much that when you consider it a faithful martyr brother R will pick that up and he'll say concerning that with antus of how that you know it's not there's not anything in record that well you know anus was a a faithful prayer Warrior which we know he had a prayer life anus was this or that but what it comes down to is a faithful martyr so he had to seal his testimony yes amen you know the word martyr it actually comes from the word witness and Jesus himself he says that we to go he says go and wait in Jerusalem and you shall be witnesses that very word you break the meaning down Martyrs martyr how am I a martyr when you die to yourself you Di yourself when you give up your life now your life is a Living Sacrifice something that one time one time makes wait that for daily in our life we can sacrifice we can sacrifice our attitude sacrifice our thoughts sacrifice desires sacrifice things things that we sacrific that aren't necessarily uh wrong or sinful but will sacrifice him for the cause and the advancement of Christ and his life among us hallelujah called to live in that way and here as brother BR picks that up with antibus that even in his life you know a and through it all that that that throughout through his that life uh being yielded out that there would be others that would be affected by that and he says it just like this he says uh as as Satan did not Triumph then speaking over antibus even as he did not Triumph when he killed the Prince of Peace for as Satan was despoiled at the cross even so now with the blood of Antipas crying out to hundreds more who will take up their crosses and follow him amen it's a witness I mean even as we've read here tonight and we spoke just a moment of encouragement about antus it's having an effect on our lives tonight yes but what is it it is Christ that was veiled in anpus life as a believer that encourages you that here we are in Satan's Eden that God has equipped you and I in this hour to live an overcoming life hallelujah praise God a testimony amen sometimes sometimes the places that you and I come into we don't always get a choice of where we're placed right we don't if we had our choice we probably would choose here choose there choose but you know you think of it sometimes there's things uh uh uh things that come our way that we we don't have the choice over like like you take for example the the little Maid that was taken captive of Syria yes I don't know how I don't know the first few moments of what she must have felt like when she's taken captive by a Syrian Army she ends up she's their place in ne's house I wonder what all went through her mind I don't know but I know that she's human like you or I and she might be wondering why am I here what am I doing what the I do oh maybe I shouldn't have went to the well at that time maybe I should have went and visited over in this place in Israel maybe I should all those things you know how we are sometimes we're so busy and occupied with if I have done this or if I would have done that if i' have done this and done this and done that done this and we rehashed everything and yet we're still where we are right brother right and here was this ma she's unaware why am I here but God knows why He's placed her there yes and in the midst of it we do not read in the scriptures the humanity part of her yet it was very it was there but God God didn't need to point out and and tell us the humanity that she cried and she wept and she was taken away from her family we can understand that right yes there was a Humanity right yes but in the midst of it she had a testimony even when she was in a place she didn't choose to be yes it shows us that there are times just like Joseph Joseph was in Egypt and he didn't choose to be there yes good Daniel was in Babylon he didn't choose to be there right but here's what's important is is wherever that you find yourself and recognize God has opened this door God has opened this place this is where I'm supposed to be I may not like it but I've got a peace in my heart the rest in that this is where I'm at for right now yes this is where I belong then then at that moment you can be an instrument that God can use hallelujah what is that that's a decision that you and I have to make that's a place of overcoming that's Authority that we have in his presence that though I may not be where I chosen to be but yet here I am like this maid like Daniel like Joseph but yet they were instruments that God was able to have a testimony and even like that M she she had a testimony think about what had to work through her life to be an instrument she didn't say h they took me from Israel they took me from my family I ain't going to help them right right I mean this guy did this on the job did this dog eat dog I'm not going to help him no but the Bible says when she heard that nonon had leprosy she said said to the maiden of the house she said would to God he went to Israel there's a prophet in the land that pray forah and you'll be made whole wow you see even that resolve that she be to say I'm not going to live my life as though that I'm a victim the whole time yeah I'm a victim mentality I'm always the victim I'm always the victim everything's always against me she had to make a decision that just didn't happen she had to make a decision and she had Authority in God's presence to make a decision to Let It Go hallelujah hallelujah Glory same thing when it came even with Joseph by the time that God would bring things around with Joseph and here he would have to stand before his Brethren but God worked all that out in Joseph's life Hallelujah little through every little place worked it out and he wasn't just working out bitterness he wasn't just working out all those things but brother Brown would take us in one little place in the message a prisoner and he said one thing he had to work out at Joseph was Joseph got to feeling like he was a little something because of that dream wow he said he had to bring him to a place to where Joseph could see himself as a total failure wow what am I doing here then he's got a prisoner he's got someone he just just rely and just just just yield and just yield so the things that God brings us to this is a place where we gain author Authority in his presence how do our Authority how does Authority come by yielding hallelujah it's by yielding it's not our our struggling and pushing and trying to move our way through it's by yielding So within this part of of the testimony here I look at this with Daniel and just to take this here just just a few moments when we look at this with Daniel even in that time where he was at that Daniel here he was in a situation he and the other Hebrew children they were in a place they didn't choose to be good but the way that they themselves overcame in the midst of that I took a little bit of these things with our young people back home in some of these parts and I uh looking at that with Daniel of how that from the beginning when you look through the book of when you're looking through the Book of Daniel you realize even when you open chapter one that Daniel and the rest of them had understanding inside Sciences that's right they understood natural things this is why the prophet could say when he would speak of education and he would say education there he said is of the devil what he's speaking of he would remind us when you rely upon Ed that's right and it could be a person that could uh uh you know that could be ignorance can be in mad but if they rely on their intellect even when it comes to scripture that's education right brother right we're not the Bible didn't say son of God are led by education but we're led by the spirit of God hallelujah Daniel and them God knows what they had need of in this Natural Earth yes so it's not something to be if God thought that it was something to be frowned upon he would have said something about it or he wouldn't have included that in the opening part of the Book of Daniel but God saw it fitting to understand to let it be known that they had understanding in The Sciences in those things so to gain understanding to gain knowledge to gain things as young people and others where there skills that you have to have remember God is Jehovah Gyra he knows what you have need of even as if we go further in the Book of Daniel there was that time to where that even the Bible speaks of how that God Advanced the wisdom of Daniel not just in the natural things God was quick to assert also in the spiritual understanding glory and we find through the Book of Daniel when they'll come into situations there these are young people right Daniel and Shadrach meach and abedo these are young people right right in the midst of Babylon I mean they're having to deal with Facebook and I know that's not the young people's thing anymore forgive me that's the advanced older people they were having to deal with you know Snapchat and Instagram and all they having to deal with all those things yes those were things that were present before them you see this is where that when Daniel Daniel saw the king's meat saw the wine that was presented but Daniel made a decision I'm not going to be a partaker of this that's right now what I'm talking about here this is overcoming you know overcoming starts with a decision in your heart am yes said so many times people say if God will just take this evil spirit from me if God will if God will take the drinking from me God will take the smoking from me he said but that's up to you yes yes you've got a decision to make he says it's up to you the Bible say lay aside yes Hallelujah you got to make a decision how do I make a decision you make a decision by faith in his presence Glory let me just tell you something you can be you could sat right here right here and there might be things that that are around your life that you are bound with and you're looking and say how do I have authority because Satan has no no power over you but what you allow him to have that's right Hallelujah he ain't can have no Authority but what you permitting to have listen when the when the prodal son was down there in the in the most uh dire situation when he remembered about home when he remembered that the Bible says that in that moment he said I will return back home yes there wasn't anything that could stop him or hinder him from returning back home you know the only thing that'll hinder you is unbelief right that's why the prophet could say if there's anything holding you back listen this is what he would say over and over if there's anything holding you back don't come through the prayer line tonight you only make yourself worse he said but whatever it is that's holding you back get that remedy because when you pass through here it's got to be Faith it's got to understand this is what God has said I'm included in it he means it for me healing is for me me Deliverance is for me the Holy Ghost is for me Hallelujah so overcoming isn't something that's way far off overcoming begins with a decision Hallelujah that's why the Propet could say his wife hath made herself ready and he says by making that decision we show our faith and respects to God hallelujah we've got decisions to make you know we could put it down the road and well I put it down the road no it's a decision a decision has to be made is to be acted upon when the word of God comes that's the moment to act upon God's word hallelujah Daniel here as a as as young people were overcoming right there in Babylon they refused all of the the the the luxuries of Babylon I'm talking about all the Divine Delicacies and Daniel didn't even have the Holy Ghost like you and I have right right and they live an overcoming life yes sir and even when Daniel to me where I look at it you know this age is an age where it speaks of uh in the last days peress times will come yes and one of the very first things that describes or let you know it's a Peerless time men will be lovers of themselves yes and we're living in a day where it's a it's about me I mean you to need to everything you don't just you know we sometimes we look at those saint but all those things have meaning right yes yes sir you know I'm not I'm not against you know YouTube and those things that that you being used correct but you understand what I'm saying those things they're all out there yes and things just want to come so subtly this is why there's things that we need the discernment of the holy spirit in each things you realize there's things that could you could allow even as a young person simple in innocent things to so Encompass your life to where you miss out on what you should be doing right now that's right amen the strength the stamina the fortitude that you have right now in your life the things God allots that for this season of life that you're living Hallelujah in the time that you're in and here Daniel when everything comes about the vision Daniel looks and he says to um you know I can't remember the the uh the the one who was the ruler uh maybe Ash panz I'm not can't remember that exactly whether that was the name or not but he remember when the king you know he he has the he has the dream and when he has the dream Daniel he begins to go before God In Prayer along with the rest of the Hebrew children and as they pray and they seek after God to me these are little things that I I we a lot of times we we we we think about the stories oh Shadrach mesach and better to go in Daniel but I want you to understand it's s the simple things that led them to overcome it amen when situations arose that they didn't have an answer for they went to prayer amen amen yes they they they they would fast Lord you know let me just say like this I I I hope this all right I'm just just preaching as he just deler amen you know sometimes the fasting itself it may not all together the Bible said when Daniel fasted there before God he abstained from Pleasant me that's right sometimes there's things in our life that you know you you know even in the time we're living in right now you can be on a fast and yet you still might be eating but you're on a fast because you're taking a break from other things that are filling your life that's right right amen we're living in that time to say Hey you know there's there's certain things there's certain times there's times that really matter I I need to make sure that other voices are getting silenced good yeah amen I'm getting in tune with what say amen when Daniel came to that place you know God allows us to come to that place sometimes you know almost the spirit of Babylon it's a spirit of entitlement yes everything's just free we'll just give it to you for free here you just take it as though as yet the Bible says he has freely given us all things but sure all things are for us but you have to fight for every inch of that's right and who yourj it's not God it's fighting our own will yes Hallelujah PR beyond our own self our own comfortableness that's a spirit that's there it's here in this world the prophet would say like this in the church age book he said I'm afraid too many have not have underestimated this last day Spirit yes Hallelujah cooling off it's a spirit is though well you know if God wants me to have it no if you desire it God desires you to have it it's it's yours rise yes Hallelujah just didn't fall down with them sitting down there by the Jordan they had to go and they had to make their way around Jericho according to the word of the Lord yes walls came down you've got to see you have to come to that Resolute in your heart how much does it mean to you how much does God's thoughts mean to you how much does the Holy Ghost mean to you how much does your healing mean to you it's there for you but you'll have to fight for it Hallelujah Glory David Jacob's wrestling was Jacob submitting his own will yes it's our will just say it like this even after the Holy Ghost has come you still got to submit your will yes sir yes you still have to submit your will hallelujah amen it's overcoming hey we're overcoming right here in the midst of this of the time I I thank God for streaming I thank God for that I thank God that God's provided for those things but you know you you've even got to overcome to say h you know tonight H uh you know I'll still pull on the gift of God I'll just set my recliner at home you know and I'll be right behind brother Jessie if you're going to be right behind brother Jesse you need to be here right brother right it's overcoming see sometimes the things we make big oh these big things all this big things sometimes you say oh if I could just walk on the water sometimes you got to walk on your feelings you got to walk be on how you feel amen beyond your thought the great big things out there and it's right here in the simple things that we end uped and we wonder why the big things even look bigger it's because little things yes but this is the authority we have in his presence that we can come in the presence of God and bring this bring our lives bring ourselves subject to the Lord say God you would You Lead Me Guide Me give me the strength give me the amen amen see it's it's just like when Daniel when he when he received that of the Lord I love how Daniel makes that makes that statement Daniel says uh this right here that God has revealed to me regarding that uh of of the image uh of Nebuchadnezzar he said God has not done that for me he said he did it for them yes I want you to think of this the King was going to kill every one of those astrologers magicians all those men yes all those other wise Daniel's the one who spoke up on their behalf they were not even Israelites yes good but Daniel said whoa don't let the king be at haste here was a man living in Babylon which was a kingdom that was built upon sth yes you can see where it got to after a while eventually God pulled back a little bit soon as God pulled back it was God that gave them the authority to come and take Israel God pulled back a little bit look what happened in Nebuchadnezzar I've did this all on my own I've done this all and and God allowed him then he had to he went and ate grass like an ox yes yes right see God pulled back and so that Pride was right there yes so in the midst of that Kingdom it was very much a kingdom that was about self very much things that you had others around were so you know heightening of education but you had others in there that were living an overcoming life and they could see I can go to school I can get this skill I can learn these things right here but it's this is not what I'm worshiping this is only here God's provided God gave me an understanding a GI in this way is to provide down here cuz he's Jehovah Gyra he didn't put me in this earth without something of skill that he could bring out that could provide yes this this is not what I'm here to do this is not my my full purpose is just not this right right hallelujah amen Daniel here in the midst of that time they live an overcoming life and this is why when we when we look at this brother bwood refers to in in the Revelation series and he would asked the question who has more Authority in the presence of God an angel or a sinner says who has more Authority he says the Son of God has more Authority who is it he says where the angels are continuing to worship Him who has more Authority that angel that's worshiping or a son of God that begins to plead that begins to ask Begins the SE amen Son of God God himself will stop that to hear what his son or daughter is asking there's not let me say this to you kind of moving down to a close here there's nothing big or too small about your life that God doesn't care about tells us in God rich in Mercy he says God is interested in you he's interested in everything you anticipate in he's interested in everything that's dra God's interested Hallelujah I believe that amen I believe God was interested in Shadrach and meach and abedo here they were they stood as Overcomers in that time good even when there was a a pressure to just you know let down and conform you know here was an image of Daniel that was erected but they realized wait a minute there's nothing that can or should replace let's bring it down to us nothing should replace the true image of Christ inside of you amen amen nothing should hinder that reality hallelujah amen this is why you know brother BR says Satan's kingdom and Satan's even he said Satan he says he'll take there'll be he says ministers he said that are trying to establish themselves in the people's hearts instead of the kingdom of God yes hallelu he doesn't want another man's image in our lives he wants his image that's why your experience is a personal experience it's not somebody else's Hallelujah personal amen because it's Christ coming coming to reflect himself in you and through your life Hallelujah that's why God has made us so the diversity and how things are made and sometimes from young people and and I know the young people understand what I'm saying but even as sometimes it grows older God doesn't want us being like anybody else he wants to be who he is through your life yes amen that's why there's certain things we can talk about certain quirks and sometimes going quirks and certain ways God's made us the way he's made us for a purpose yes Hallelujah like the prophet he couldn't understand why they were down there shooting up squirrels and they're you know when they're hitting them here you know in the back and hitting them in the head and hitting them here and the prophet's interested in shooting them through the eye those men those those brothers are down there men are having a good old time brother just puts his gun next to the tree and starts weeping so why am I this way why am I this way that it matters that I have to hit him through the aisle and go told him I've made you this way for a purpose amen amen sometimes the things that we're we're trying to alter we want to change or somehow we don't want I'm not going to have a physical operation but sometimes we decide I'm going to have you know some type of an operation you know within my spirit or within my psyche or within myself so I'll act like somebody else God doesn't want you acting like anybody else yes God wants you to be who he's called you to be yes and it'll be Christ Living For Your Life Hallelujah am amen sometimes you know I think it was um Teddy Teddy Roosevelt you get into quoting things somebody say no no someone said that any I'll say Teddy Roosevelt said it I know other might say someone say said comparison is the thief of Joy that's right good comparison is the thief of joy we can battle that from from from time to time and I say that even as we looking just and I just feeling thislike with with even uh with that of the young people and the pressures that was even coming among them in that in that day think if even with these things I'm just trying to close just hit these highlights here but you know Daniel and them never did what they did to try to get promotion right they never said you know what I I want to get in the king's favor I want to I really want to so you know what in order to get in his favor what I think I need to do is I know I know what I'm do in order for them to get to look at me I think I can miss Wednesday nights yeah I I'll pick it up on Thursday morning I'll archive it good you know God understands you know this you know after all God's given me the skill and talent and so we start making corners and cuts on things in order to try to advance right and God himself knows what we can handle when we can handle and how much of it we right God knows that this is why with Daniel and the rest of when you read as you go through this and I know your Bible readers as you go through this you find Daniel and them never ever sought for promotion but every time they stood faithful with the Lord not only did God speak to them but the king had to take knowledge of the favor of God and they were promoted right amen why because it's the principle seek you first the kingdom of God his righteousness yes all these other things will be amen amen with the pressures of music when the pressures of things came around them that was all out there because music is to draw in to worship they play that music music has a way of kind of break now you know kind of mellowing out Satan's not the original he's a copy that's right that's right right but how that they would use that and the music and all those enticements and those things the alment that was around but yet in the midst of that time God gave Grace for Daniel and the rest of them to be able to discern those things that were out there and say that's not Hallelujah where is it taken where where will it direct me even when you you think of some of the you know some of the earlier Parts even with music and I just I go beyond that not just to stay in that realm of music but just to show that there is an overcoming that is set before us as young people middleaged an order there's overcoming that's placed here that you've got Authority in his presence yes don't you understand that God's never too far away God's not way out there he's right here as a matter of fact the prophet puts it straight down in this in this term when he talks about Jonah he said Jonah ran from the presence of the Lord he said but you know when you're trying to run from God's presence you'll find out he's ever Hallelujah that's right you can't outrun and escape the presence of God and the plan of God for your life Glory Glory Hallelujah I'm glad for that amen amen amen amen glory so he's not he's never too busy the old song that we would sing he's never too busy and let me tell you something there's never anything that's too insignificant amen right God cares about everything in your life and I think of this of this relationship that's been opened to us as children of God in this hour we have authority in his presence to bring every situation we have authority in the presence of God to make decisions glory amen we don't have to ask we don't have to ask the enemy you think it'd be all right could you give me a little SL we don't have to ask that's right God has given you Liberty but it's the things that even in being honest listen even even having this Authority in the presence of God say Lord increase my faith where it needs to be amen for what I have need of in my life Hallelujah just being that open and that honest with God you've got Authority in his presence like Esther had to be over that's right am it might take you a few times before you can finally uncover hmon but you know what each time keep Ting him back amen keep welcoming the presence of the Lord back and God himself moves down and that hmon that's intended evil that's wanted to destroy in the presence of our kid yes is exposed so what I do keep on inviting keep on entertaining the Pres of the Lord Hallelujah Lord increase my faith Lord amen increase my sights Lord give me Grace in this hour Lord as a young young person middleaged what to live Lord let me live that Victorious Life in Babylon amen I look at it you placed me here then you've given me sufficient Grace the means to live an overcoming life because it isn't always so much about what we're to overcome that's how yes Hallelujah like brother re says the what itself is really insignificant when you know how hallelujah how is having God's word inside you that's how you hallelujah it's having his life inside of you you know it's being it's just this is part of overcoming because this is an age this is an age of such facade everybody wants to put up a front everybody wants to put up a good front gu sometimes down in here brother BR talks about that in the lady oan Church age in the church age book he said this age speaks of great advancements he said we've seen an age that's went from that of a horse and buggy cleared up putting a man on the moon yeah Cries Out scientific achievement yet he says we find there are dark caverns in man yes that's right such a neurotic age where there's such deepness and darkness that's within yes and yet it's such an age where all this picturesque and all this pressure and all this that's out there but you know In God's Presence you don't have to put on one thing hallelujah amen you can be honest with him because he knows you Hallelujah he knows about you and your problems your needs are not things that intimidate God whatsoever that's right but those are opportunities for him to make himself personally known to you that he still the mighty conqueror am and to let you know who you are amen hallelujah overcome here you are sitting again here on the Sunday evening here two Services we've said here I can tell you Satan never encouraged you to be here that's right that's right brother everything he could to discourage you even as you've said here tried to take your mind every which way don't don't don't feel doubt about that but look where you're at you brought your mind right back in life that's overcoming amen amen you sit here and listen to the word of God and said wow you missed this you missed that you missed that no look you are bringing it right back in line that's overcoming Hallelujah and pressing beyond your own self your own feelings I said God bless you here you are standing in the midst of Satan's another day Victorious Hallelujah you got Authority amen glory remember that Son of God you're a daughter of God you didn't become that on a certain day you were always that because of that Authority it always lay there within you just to make a decision and continue to make decisions that are leading you closer to the throne of God hallelujah hallelujah help I want to stand there that day I want to stand there with each other I want to stand there that day with The Ransom of the Lord hallelujah say thank you God for your grace amen thank you for your influence Jesus I want to be influenc Hallelujah in every decision yes I need his influence Hallelujah I need his Direction Hallelujah this hour We're living I want to stand as an overcomer Hallelujah Jesus in the midst of Babylon I want to stand an overcomer young people want to stand as an overcomer middleaged people Overcomer yes I raised my hand with the young people amen amen God is faithful amen amen whatever promise that God has made that's placed before you you have to fight for it but it's yours yes the promised land was given to them but they had to fight for every inch amen so the fight itself doesn't me or there's something wrong with me no the fight is there because Satan is always there to contest everything that God is making known to you that's right so just remember when you feel contested it's Satan trying to put up a bluff and a hindrance but it's an opportunity that God is going leading you to overcome amen remember the battle that we have to face and press Beyond is our own self hallelujah our own will hallelujah our own thoughts about things say Lord let my mind let my life be filled with your thoughts that's has life Hallelujah let's just pray Heavenly Father Lord how we thank you Lord for the grace that Lord that you have certainly given us in this hour Lord Jesus to live for you Lord when we think of these characters in the scripture Lord I certainly believe that the Bible was wrote for this moment Lord where we can look into the scriptures yes Jesus and we're seeing you all the way through we're seeing the identification of ourselves in the scriptures Lord where father as you taken a hold of the book lord we know Lord that that all is symbolic that's that's simply you in the fullness of your presence right here Among Us Lord revealing yourself making yourself so real Among Us lord it's you that's inspiring us Lord energizing us it's you Lord yes Father how how could Mary Magdalene how could she Lord come to you and press beyond all of the ridicule in Simon's house house yes even as your Prophet said that there was Lord a pulsation upon her heart go wash his feet and she went there not knowing how she was going to do it but she went anyway yes and Lord when she got there you provided the water the tear ducts begin to open and begin to flow Hallelujah as she came into your presence oh my oh Lord that house was filled Hallelujah with religious and such staunch individuals but right there in the midst of that house Hallelujah she was having a meeting with you hallelujah praise God she had recognized your presence Lord hallelujah and she was receiving by The [Music] Authority in your presence hallelujah our sins were forgiven the life that she had lived no more no longer a slave yes oh God she came in there bow but just to show for us here tonight she made a decision she saw you sitting in the midst of that house and she made a decision she went she purchased that Alabaster Box Hallelujah even though the conditions that was around her [Music] life the spirits No Doubt were whispering to her you can't go in there you can't do that you'll never make it through there and then not only does she have that but she comes in Lord to the house how many were Whispering around the house wonder if he knows what kind of woman she is she's overcoming hallelujah hallelujah she's overcoming praise God how is she overcoming it's because she's recognized in your presence yes Jesus our faith is rising and just got to get to him yesj Lord I pray here tonight Lord

pressure with situations from around here in Babylon yes Lord as they look to you you're you're the God who opens our eyes to see things the way we need to see to understand the way we need to understand Lord I I just ask Lord right here that even in that and for those Lord that here they are in schooling Lord different ones Lord maybe it would be with math maybe it would be with science Lord your Prophet taught us in the message key to the door that there's keys to all those things yes Lord he said there's a key to math there's a key to science there's a key now Lord even in the even in those things you care yes Lord as a as an elementary student Middle School student Lord whatever it might be even in that in their life it's a moment and an opportunity that Lord that you could give them the keys that they need yes Jesus letting them know you care I pray that God that you would Minister to every one of these needs Lord that's here this even Hallelujah Lord God from The Emptiness of a heart God to The Emptiness of a spirit Lord oh God may you may you come Lord and fill every fiber with your presence Hallelujah Lord as we take this moment to recognize the authority
