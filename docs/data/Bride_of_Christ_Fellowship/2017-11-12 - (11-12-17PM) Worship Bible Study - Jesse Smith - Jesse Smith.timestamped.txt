[21:22] so I got another YouTube testimony a
[21:23] family out in California found our
[21:25] YouTube videos and said I'm very happy I
[21:29] found your YouTube video actually tried
[21:31] to watch every video you have about God

[22:01] but we're do is just grateful you know
[22:03] to you know see little testimonies and
[22:06] so they want to be baptized they watch
[22:08] our baptism you know they want to be
[22:09] baptized so they said you know a
[22:10] preacher in California I don't so I gave

[22:18] baptized they said we really want to get
[22:19] baptized so no are the iron's hot you
[22:22] know hopefully they'll find a preacher
[22:24] out there that can baptize them in the
[22:25] name of Lord Jesus Christ so just got
[22:28] that this week and yesterday so
[22:31] encouraging by the grace of the Lord so
[22:33] let's look at this like I said I just
[22:35] want to take about a hour here and I
[22:38] would like to look at worship again it
[22:40] just you know it we became fresh to me
[22:42] as I was studying this week and just
[22:46] this idea of you know approaching God
[22:49] like like a little dog and we saw you
[22:50] know sister Connie's dog out there and
[22:53] like that's perfect you know the dog
[22:55] just runs up to the kids and jumping all
[22:57] over the kids and you know at this
[22:59] tongue all out like we talked about it
[23:01] was really really sweet you know he's so
[23:03] fast too so just it just reminded me of
[23:07] that you know like God wants a cheerful
[23:08] worshiper you know I know we all come
[23:10] here sometimes dragon I came here so
[23:12] tired Wednesday night but by the time I
[23:14] left I forgot all about my tiredness you
[23:16] know the how the Holy Spirit was moving
[23:18] in and encouraging us and blessing us it
[23:20] was just you know in my in my own body
[23:22] this is when I was my own body
[23:24] felt like just just call off just call
[23:26] the service off and I you know if you
[23:28] know me I rare I never do that but my
[23:30] body was so tired it's like the people
[23:32] understand you know you're just so tired
[23:34] but by the time I have got through his
[23:37] service you know it's such a good
[23:38] service and just so encouraged and now I
[23:41] had strength Thursday you know so it
[23:43] just goes to show that there's times you
[23:45] know when we're sick we need to stay at
[23:46] home you know but but that was one of
[23:47] those times where I just had to press
[23:48] through and the anointing really gave me
[23:50] strength that was I was really thankful
[23:52] for that because everything in my mind
[23:54] was telling me they'll understand you
[23:56] know you just need your overworked you
[23:58] know it's my own fault if I'm overworked
[24:01] I've got to do a better job balance in
[24:03] it but anyway just really blessed you
[24:05] know I just thought that would encourage
[24:06] you and that really encouraged me so I
[24:09] want to start like I said John 4:24 and
[24:12] I just want to go over those meanings
[24:14] again okay so woo I want to look at
[24:18] verse 23 again so true worshipers
[24:22] worship in the spirit now that's in the
[24:24] holy spirit and in the truth now there's
[24:28] lots there's a couple different
[24:29] interpretations of that you know we
[24:31] talked about some people have the
[24:32] anointing but don't have the revelation
[24:34] of the message of the hour you know that
[24:35] we need to believe that like we'd say
[24:37] like the latest message before ours was
[24:39] Pentecostal and those denominations
[24:41] certainly I've seen it my mom was healed
[24:43] of cancer in the church you know so I
[24:44] know the anointing comes upon them no
[24:47] doubt about that
[24:47] but lacking a little bit of truth you
[24:50] know lacking the message of the hour so
[24:53] we want the power of the Spirit and we
[24:55] want the truth of the word we've got to
[24:57] have both and I know that's familiar to
[24:59] us but I just want to remind us of that
[25:01] and I want to look at that word seeketh
[25:04] seeketh such to worship so that word
[25:07] actually means crave you probably heard
[25:08] me pray earlier God craves a true
[25:10] worshiper can you can you try to relate
[25:13] to that what have you craved it recently
[25:14] like in usually that mornings I crave
[25:16] coffee you know or crave something else
[25:19] you know just crave this well that's
[25:21] what God he's craving someone that will
[25:24] worship in spirit and in truth oh my so
[25:29] I thought that would be a help to you
[25:30] there he's craving someone that will
[25:32] have the right the right truth of the
[25:35] word but also true
[25:37] and church we should feel thankful that
[25:39] were that were the ones who can most
[25:41] easily meet these requirements because
[25:43] we have the word of the hour a scripture
[25:47] just came to my mind so bear with me and
[25:49] I want to go to that okay that's where
[25:52] there James for five let's go there
[25:54] James for five the scripture just came
[25:56] to my mind remember in verse four James
[26:05] tells us not to have friendship with the
[26:07] world so don't make friends you know
[26:10] like BAM said flirting like like Sampson
[26:14] don't floor it with worldly things don't
[26:15] play around with worldly things but
[26:17] verse five this is that same idea of
[26:21] craving God craves and it's that godly
[26:24] jealousy that the Holy Spirit has okay
[26:28] so here's a scripture do you think that
[26:31] the scripture saith in vain the spirit
[26:33] that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy so
[26:37] God is craving right and has is craving
[26:41] our worship so much that the Spirit of
[26:42] God gets jealous inside of us we had
[26:46] friends over that woman I baptized in
[26:49] August the family from Copley we had
[26:52] them over Friday night had some really
[26:53] good fellowship gotten to witness to
[26:55] them and they said you ever miss
[26:56] football I said not really I said I just
[26:59] have a lot of zeal and jealousy now
[27:01] because I see all these people worship
[27:02] in football and and they won't even
[27:04] shout for Jesus and they're they just
[27:07] not like yeah yeah they they can see
[27:09] that well that's what the spirit does
[27:10] the spirit now covets it craves your
[27:14] worship and and that that's what you and
[27:16] I feel right we feel that when when we
[27:18] see people worshiping other things that
[27:19] there's just like this godly jealousy
[27:21] that you should be worshipping Christ
[27:24] does everybody feel that oh my that's
[27:26] what that's what Jesus says the father
[27:28] is craving that he's craving our worship
[27:30] he can't wait til we all gather here and
[27:33] worship and sing his songs and glorify
[27:36] Him and then remember that last one
[27:38] there in verse 24 they must worship Him
[27:41] so not only it's not an option like we
[27:42] said this morning it's not an option
[27:44] well it's an option if I can do this
[27:46] it's an option if I can obey this it's
[27:48] well maybe I have this option there's no
[27:50] options
[27:51] there's one requirement and that's
[27:53] spirit and in truth as there's there's
[27:56] no other options we have to meet this
[27:57] requirement and I want to echo this here
[28:00] in more Scripture so John 9:31 let's go
[28:04] there John 9:31 I'm gonna try to be
[28:06] moving pretty quick John 9:31 cuz I got
[28:09] a whole lot like I said there 73 whit
[28:11] worship scriptures in the New Testament
[28:13] there's no way I can cover all of them
[28:14] but I'll definitely hit the highlights
[28:16] if the Holy Spirit will help me here
[28:19] tonight
[28:21] so John 9:31 Malachi can you read that
[28:25] for me sir this is the man that was
[28:35] healed of his blindness I believe or
[28:36] Jesus had touched him I believe and he
[28:39] knew this so this man had common
[28:41] knowledge God doesn't hear sinners right
[28:45] but if any man's a worshiper of God and
[28:47] does his will Himmy here this is a true
[28:51] worshiper we've got to do his will like
[28:53] Jesus said in Matthew 7:21 only he that
[28:56] doeth the will of my father which is in
[28:59] heaven will inherit eternal life but he
[29:01] also must be a worshiper so in order to
[29:04] do the will of God we must worship God
[29:05] in spirit and in truth and it's clear
[29:10] every time in the Bible now let's go to
[29:13] Philippians 3:3 and sister Wendy do when
[29:18] I read that when you get a chance I know
[29:19] you're right in there so part of me I
[29:21] know you're really good at fast a turn
[29:23] in there Philippians 3:3 I thought you
[29:26] liked this you know it's nice to see
[29:27] Paul write this in the scripture and
[29:30] whenever you racist hey man praise God
[29:42] don't you like that it's the same idea
[29:43] we worship the father in spirit and in
[29:46] truth
[29:46] Paul said that's what we are we are the
[29:48] circumcision we worship God in the
[29:50] spirit we rejoice in Christ Jesus and
[29:53] have no confidence in the flesh that's
[29:55] why we crucify the flesh that's why we
[29:56] bring the flesh under obedience to the
[29:59] Word of God we our temper in all things
[30:01] amen
[30:02] we're self-controlled praise the Lord I
[30:04] thought you like that
[30:05] it goes right along with Matthew 4:20
[30:07] for the next one is lydia and acts 1614
[30:13] I just thought I'd read that when I
[30:14] thought that was she was a worshiper of
[30:16] God and because she was a true
[30:20] worshipper God opened her heart and let
[30:23] her hear the prophet of the hour hey man
[30:25] Paul because she was a true worshiper I
[30:30] can say that from my experience you know
[30:32] when God found me I was truly worshiping
[30:34] and in my denominational Church or
[30:36] whatever independent church I was truly
[30:38] worshiping I was I was trying to worship
[30:40] in spirit and truth and then when the
[30:42] message came around I was ready to
[30:43] receive it by the grace of the Lord so
[30:45] verse 14 and a certain woman named Lydia
[30:48] cellar purple and of the city of
[30:50] Thyatira which worshipped God heard us
[30:53] whose heart the Lord opened and she
[30:58] attended unto the things which were
[31:00] spoken of by Paul Amen I just got a I
[31:05] just got a call from sister Karen
[31:07] Sanders so it's interesting she was she
[31:10] normally doesn't call me unless there's
[31:11] a prayer request so maybe after this
[31:13] service I'll check that hope
[31:15] everything's okay okay
[31:19] so see she is she worshiped God so she
[31:21] had to been a true worshiper because God
[31:23] was craving a worshiper so God sent Paul
[31:26] there - he was craving more Souls God
[31:29] sent Paul there and a true worshiper
[31:31] received the word and the Bible said the
[31:34] Lord opened her heart amen and God
[31:36] opened her heart because she was a true
[31:38] worshiper and poured in the oil and wine
[31:40] can I say like that part of the oil and
[31:42] wine amen so there you go
[31:45] there's another example of a true
[31:46] worshiper okay now let me just briefly
[31:51] go over this definition again true
[31:54] worship is I'm sorry worship means to
[31:57] kiss the hand token of reverence to fall
[32:00] on the knees to touch the ground
[32:03] profound reverence prostration to do
[32:07] homage to make obeisance a way to
[32:11] express respect or make supplication so
[32:16] I wanted to show all the scriptures that
[32:19] use this word like I said most of the
[32:21] words in the New Testament are this word
[32:25] and it's Pross Canio
[32:27] Pross cuneo okay I just got a voice text
[32:35] from sister Kara I just want to make
[32:36] sure it's nothing serious we need to
[32:37] pray for right now oh no she just
[32:43] congratulating us on our seventh baby
[32:44] praise the hard house very nice bless
[32:48] her heart
[32:49] so that's Prosecco neo worship I want to
[32:53] be a prosecutor worshipper Amen a true
[32:55] worshipper someone who comes to Lourdes
[32:58] like a dog comes before master and that
[33:02] as you know I forgot about it but
[33:04] remember the word caleb means dog
[33:06] remember that a Joshua and Caleb Caleb
[33:09] means dog and and so dogs member are
[33:11] connected to Gentiles in the in the in
[33:15] the instance of Caleb and then the
[33:18] instance of the Canaanite woman who
[33:20] approached Jesus so we have two examples
[33:22] there of of individuals that are typed
[33:25] as dogs worshiping God and we know with
[33:28] Caleb the brother branham said Caleb
[33:30] represents those that stayed true with
[33:32] Joshua amen and he probably said Joshua
[33:35] represents the seventh day messenger
[33:37] which of course was brother Rams
[33:39] ministry so we we are the ones that are
[33:41] staying true so the dogs will stay true
[33:43] to the prophet of the hour amen and next
[33:49] the Canaanite woman let's go to that
[33:50] Matthew 1525 she called herself
[33:55] well after Jesus called her dogs she
[33:57] agreed she said yes Lord I am just say
[34:00] I'm just a dog I'm just a worshipper
[34:03] that's how we see it's not what you feel
[34:05] I'm just the worshipper I'm nobody
[34:07] special I'm nobody you know that we
[34:10] would think oh this person's really
[34:11] special I'm just a dog
[34:13] I'm just one of them just a Gentile
[34:15] worship or praise God that's all I am
[34:19] now Matthew 15 25 I like that praise God
[34:27] Lydia do you want to read
[34:30] let's see 25 and okay remember she was
[34:38] crying after Jesus that's true worship
[34:40] praise God could not be turned away
[34:43] Jesus says I'm only come to lost sheep
[34:45] of the house of Israel and why don't you
[34:48] read 25 and 26 hon all right and she
[35:00] said truth Lord yet the dogs eat of the
[35:02] crumbs which fall from their master's
[35:04] table so she agrees with the Lord we
[35:08] must always agree with the word and
[35:11] recognize whatever God calls us that's
[35:14] what we are if he says we're a dog we're
[35:16] a dog amen we're just a worshipper a
[35:19] Gentile worshipper and they eat the
[35:21] crumbs and Jesus said gray is your faith
[35:24] don't let anything to scourge you don't
[35:27] let anything make you doubt just
[35:30] understand I'm a Gentile worshipper and
[35:32] we get the blessings of God amen
[35:35] this and Jesus calls that great faith
[35:37] that's what I'm saying I'm trying to
[35:38] encourage you I'm trying to let the word
[35:40] encourage me be encouraged take would
[35:42] just realize God has something for us it
[35:45] might not be what we envision but so we
[35:47] just need a brainwashing amen we need to
[35:49] have the brain washed by the waters of
[35:51] the word like you know for me I thought
[35:53] you know God would you know save 100
[35:54] souls in Akron or maybe 200 you know I
[35:56] just we have all of our ideas but we got
[35:59] to be submissive to the will of God and
[36:02] realize we're nothing amen so it's great
[36:05] faith that realizes even dogs get crumbs
[36:08] even worshippers even the most
[36:10] insignificant worshiper gets a crumb
[36:12] from the master's table great faith and
[36:15] great faith we'll hang on to that that's
[36:17] why we're hanging on here in Accra
[36:19] that's why we're hanging on that's why
[36:20] you're hanging on to the promises of God
[36:22] because you have great faith how many
[36:25] how many say that by God's grace if you
[36:26] got even a mustard seed of grain of
[36:28] faith you got great faith does that move
[36:30] mountains
[36:31] absolutely okay so there's that
[36:34] connection to dog kind of getting back
[36:36] to that definition now let's go through
[36:38] the process
[36:40] we're shipping here to the New Testament
[36:44] you know what I'm sorry before I get to
[36:45] that let's do vain worship first let's
[36:47] go back to matthew 15:8 let's do vain
[36:49] worship because we showed true worship
[36:51] and now let's show vain worship we're
[36:54] gonna see a few of those let's look at
[36:57] some vain worship matthew 15:8 through
[37:00] nine yeah we're right there that's
[37:01] actually really really good now remember
[37:07] in this context the Jews had the
[37:11] Pharisees had made this false doctrine
[37:13] you remember the false doctrine they
[37:15] said you don't have to take care of your
[37:16] parents you can just pay the money you
[37:18] would have took care of them with and
[37:19] just give it to the temple so in other
[37:21] words who's getting rich the Pharisees
[37:24] and that was a scriptural that was a
[37:28] tradition of man that was a tradition of
[37:29] the Pharisees right so Jesus rebukes
[37:33] them see how they're always concerned
[37:34] about your money
[37:36] mercy goodness oh my verse seven okay
[37:42] let's go to verse eight yea this people
[37:45] draweth nigh unto me with their mouth
[37:47] and honoureth me with their lips but
[37:49] their heart is far from me but in vain
[37:54] they do worship Me teaching for
[37:56] doctrines the commandments of men
[37:57] how see you we just have to recognize
[38:00] that it's so serious what we teach we
[38:03] have to make sure everything lines up
[38:04] with the Word of God because soon as it
[38:07] becomes a tradition well we just do this
[38:08] because then it loses it sincerity it's
[38:12] no longer accepted but it's rejected you
[38:14] know Ave means it actually means
[38:16] fruitless so see once once we inject if
[38:20] people inject their own thoughts then
[38:22] there's no more fruit to the ministry
[38:24] there's no more fruit to the preaching
[38:26] right the fruits of the spirit the soul
[38:29] saved right the the supernatural as soon
[38:31] as people inject their own thoughts and
[38:33] their own traditions there's no more
[38:36] fruit but that's why we love the fruit
[38:38] of God because it shows we're staying
[38:40] true to the word amen
[38:41] that's right and notice this to reap
[38:46] recall that it's our words that draw
[38:49] nigh unto God did you see that he said
[38:52] with your mouth you draw nigh there's
[38:54] not really it's not that they were not
[38:55] drawing nigh to God there
[38:57] actually your words will actually get
[38:59] you closer to God and what is this this
[39:02] is thought it's the thought brother
[39:03] Branham says if you talk about him he
[39:04] comes around amen right like on the road
[39:07] to Emmaus they start talking about him
[39:09] and who steps out from behind the bushes
[39:11] the Lord Jesus it was me it was me that
[39:15] song says it was me I was always all
[39:17] that I was the rock in the wilderness I
[39:19] was everything I was the all and all I
[39:21] was the token I was everything amen but
[39:24] see that's how we draw tonight we got to
[39:26] say thank you Jesus Oh God did this and
[39:28] God's gonna move today and I've got
[39:30] expectation the Holy Spirit you know we
[39:32] have to honor him with our lips that's
[39:34] what true worshipers do and draw an eye
[39:39] with our hearts our hearts our passions
[39:41] the Greek word means a passion a desire
[39:44] the centerpiece of our being it says so
[39:49] we draw an eye with our hearts and our
[39:52] lips so see vain worship doesn't include
[39:55] your passion see we always got to make
[39:57] sure Jesus is in our passion he has to
[40:00] be our passion that's why coming to
[40:01] church always has to be the passion if
[40:03] it's it was when we all started right
[40:05] wasn't it so what's keeping it from
[40:08] being it that's why we got to get rid of
[40:10] anything that keeps this from being our
[40:12] passion hallelujah because these people
[40:15] went to church these these people
[40:16] sacrificed more than we did right we
[40:19] know Bible says all that all those
[40:21] things about him like that they would
[40:22] they would be stoned if they made one
[40:24] mistake here but the idea is our heart
[40:26] must have a passionate desire for the
[40:29] word of God amen now we don't have to
[40:32] read this but in mark 1519 the Roman
[40:34] soldiers pross knew a process but it was
[40:40] done in mockery remember they bowed down
[40:44] and they worshiped in saying hail king
[40:45] of Jews so see they had the right
[40:47] physical motions but it was a mockery
[40:50] worship and so see God recognized they
[40:54] have and it's the same Greek word so
[40:56] they actually went through that they
[40:57] went through the motions but it was on
[40:59] mockery
[41:00] so that's vain worship again they had
[41:02] the right they had the right actions but
[41:07] it was done by mockery and not from the
[41:09] heart
[41:10] it was vain worship so I just thought
[41:13] that was interesting he used the same
[41:15] Greek words so Church should we fought
[41:17] on on our knees oh yes
[41:18] should we raise our hands to heaven oh
[41:20] yes the Bible's that lift up holy hands
[41:22] right lift up holy hands unto God but
[41:26] that's done in mockery now let's go to
[41:30] let's read this one acts 17:23 this is
[41:34] ignorant worship so we have vain worship
[41:36] we have mockery worship
[41:38] here's ignorant worship in acts 17:23
[41:44] which is the word ignorant means
[41:46] mistakenly or mistaken worship so acts
[41:55] 17:23 Lydia could you read that honey
[41:59] whenever you ready isn't that something
[42:13] outside of vain worship and outside of
[42:15] mockery worship you have ignorant
[42:18] worship which mistakenly they weren't
[42:20] really trying to worship the true God
[42:23] they just mistakenly did it they
[42:26] mistakenly did it and Paul said it
[42:29] wasn't right now interesting go to verse
[42:32] 25 and Acacia could you read 2517 25
[42:37] sweetie yeah 1725 amen so not only was
[43:03] there mistaken worship but Paul has to
[43:05] kind of straighten him out and said
[43:06] God's not worship by your hands
[43:08] God's worship from your heart praise God
[43:12] so you guys not worship with your hands
[43:14] what man can do and these these people
[43:16] had all kinds of idols with their hands
[43:18] and but it was a mistaken ignorant
[43:20] worship they were they were just
[43:22] shooting in the dark they're worshiping
[43:23] everything and anything
[43:24] in church we're not just our prayers
[43:26] just don't go off to the dark our
[43:28] prayers go straight to the throne of God
[43:29] amen when our hearts condemn us not the
[43:34] Bible said we ask the court in his will
[43:36] he gives us what we asked for it's not a
[43:39] mistake it's not ignorant and it's not
[43:42] so much our hands it's not he's not
[43:44] worship with our hands he's worship from
[43:45] our heart hallelujah amen thank you lord
[43:51] now we can go through some of these
[43:53] price Kunio scriptures here now I'm not
[43:58] gonna read these because we're familiar
[43:59] with these but if you want to run down
[44:01] Acts 10:25 Cornelius tries to prosecute
[44:05] NiO Peter he tries to run up to him like
[44:09] a dog and worship Him and Peter says you
[44:11] don't worship me worship Christ and then
[44:16] you remember a revelation 19:10 in
[44:19] revelation 22 8 and 9 where John tries
[44:21] worshiping this angel and one time it's
[44:24] angel in 19 and chapter 22 it's a
[44:27] prophet he said I love the servants of
[44:29] the servants the prophets and each case
[44:32] John tried to prosecute neo a prophet or
[44:36] an angel and they said don't do that
[44:38] don't do that don't give that type of
[44:40] love and that type of respect or homage
[44:43] don't give that to a man give that to
[44:45] Christ amen okay so let's go through a
[44:50] few more here let's go to Matthew 2
[44:53] verse 2 here's the wise men worshipping
[45:01] I don't know how far a dog will run to
[45:10] find its master but these wise men
[45:13] traveled all the way from Babylon right
[45:16] to Israel they came like dogs here to
[45:20] worship the Lord Jesus amen what
[45:23] faithfulness what devotion these these
[45:26] dogs had we'd say they came to prosecute
[45:29] they came to worship real worship Christ
[45:33] so Matthew 2 - how are we done saying
[45:35] where is he that is born King of the
[45:37] Jews for we have
[45:38] Tina star in the east and we are come to
[45:40] worship Him amen
[45:43] look at verse 10 when they saw the star
[45:46] they rejoiced with exceeding great joy
[45:49] when they were come into the house they
[45:51] saw the young child with Mary his mother
[45:53] and fell down and worshiped him when
[45:57] they had opened their treasures they
[45:58] presented unto Him gifts gold and
[46:00] frankincense and myrrh so see just like
[46:03] just like Lydia they open their heart
[46:06] right their heart was open and they gave
[46:09] gifts they gave worship and praise out
[46:11] of their hearts I like that amen
[46:14] so they're seeking here's real worship
[46:16] you'll see Kenny you'll see Christ at
[46:18] any distance you'll follow his light for
[46:22] any distance you'll pack gifts you'll
[46:25] prepare gifts and fall down worship and
[46:28] rejoice in his present that's a true
[46:29] worshiper amen worshiping in the spirit
[46:32] and truth amen
[46:37] here let's go to Luke four seven now
[46:42] Luke four seven true worship must be
[46:47] reserved of course only to God this is
[46:49] when Satan tempted Jesus to worship Him
[46:53] Luke four seven I believe maybe verse
[46:55] eight to Luke for seven and eight yeah I
[47:02] brought this one I like this one a
[47:04] little better because it says get thee
[47:06] behind I like how Jesus said get behind
[47:07] me so in other words he speaks the EE
[47:11] tells the devil what to do so this is
[47:13] enough this is a man who has Authority
[47:15] and church that's what we want to tap
[47:17] into that's what we want to have we want
[47:20] to tell those evil thoughts where to go
[47:21] we want to tell that sickness where to
[47:23] go right we want to tell that temptation
[47:25] where to go behind you
[47:28] away from you amen Luke four seven and
[47:33] eight Malachi can you read four seven
[47:34] eight sir
[47:52] Amen remembered you remember this this
[47:55] is where brother branham dramatized it
[47:57] and said he was telling Jesus you don't
[47:59] have to go the cross you don't have to
[48:01] bleed you don't to die you don't to be
[48:03] mocked and stripped and beaten you don't
[48:06] have to do that I'll just give it to you
[48:07] now just fall down and Pross you neo me
[48:10] just worship me like a dog would worship
[48:13] his master just show me this love see
[48:16] how Satan he wants the same thing God
[48:17] once he's so hungry he's so craving that
[48:20] but God's craving him or amen and God
[48:22] deserves it more amen and Jesus says get
[48:26] behind me the word get means depart it
[48:29] means go away go behind me depart from
[48:33] me leave me and Jesus tells the devil
[48:36] where to go I like that so when some
[48:39] things get in our way to worship not
[48:41] let's say it's family members you know I
[48:43] couldn't come to church or I couldn't
[48:44] read my Bible because of family I
[48:46] couldn't read my Bible because of this
[48:47] temptation or that temptation I couldn't
[48:50] come to church for these reasons we need
[48:52] to speak to that with authority in the
[48:53] name of the Lord amen
[48:55] I'm not gonna worship anything else I'm
[48:57] not gonna give a higher value to
[48:58] anything else except Christ Jesus amen
[49:02] get deep heart go away and get behind me
[49:06] Satan amen
[49:08] let's go to Matthew 8 verse 2 Matthew 8
[49:10] verse 2 here's the leper and this is a
[49:14] beautiful example it's about telling
[49:16] brother Benjamin in a Bible study this
[49:17] week beautiful example of you have to
[49:22] find the will of God first for every
[49:23] situation this is the perfect example
[49:25] I remember reading this in for the bahs
[49:30] bahs worse Christ the healer book and it
[49:32] really meant a lot to me this was a
[49:33] really wonderful scripture ok so Matthew
[49:38] 8 - and behold there came a leper and
[49:40] worshipped him saying lord if thou will
[49:42] thou canst make me clean so this I
[49:45] thought this was a good example for us
[49:46] to remember well you know what when
[49:48] we're sick or when we're struggling or
[49:50] when we're in a difficult situation say
[49:51] Lord let your will if it's your will you
[49:54] can do it if it's your will remove this
[49:56] obstacle out of my life or please remove
[49:58] this trial if it's your will and I like
[50:00] what Jesus says Jesus says touching him
[50:04] and said I will in verse 3
[50:06] be thou clean but member what did Jesus
[50:08] tell Paul no I'm not gonna take away
[50:11] this infirmity from your eyes it's to
[50:12] Humble you my grace will be sufficient
[50:15] in your infirmity but this is a
[50:17] beautiful example let's find the will of
[50:19] God first and let's receive that and
[50:23] then when we have the will of God we can
[50:24] have all the joy and peace in our lives
[50:25] don't have to worry about anything
[50:27] praise God find the will of God first
[50:33] and see and how do you do that you
[50:36] worship Him worship Him first and then
[50:39] he'll show you his will ask for his will
[50:42] he'll give it to you
[50:43] amen we're not going to go through these
[50:47] but Jarius you know before his daughter
[50:50] was raised from the dead he worshiped
[50:54] Jesus first he worshiped he came like a
[50:56] dog before the lord and worshiped him
[50:59] remember he was leader of the synagogue
[51:00] he could have got expelled for that he
[51:03] could have got kicked out of the church
[51:04] for that but yet he was willing to come
[51:06] and worship Jesus in spirit and truth
[51:08] and God honored him by raising his
[51:10] daughter from the dead in Matthew 14:33
[51:13] the disciples worshiped Jesus after he
[51:16] calmed the sea I think we can all relate
[51:19] to that one boy we would have done that
[51:20] too right our lives were in jeopardy and
[51:22] and don't you do that when you almost
[51:25] get in a car accident a few weeks ago I
[51:27] almost got in a car accident I wasn't
[51:29] paying attention I went over to get in
[51:30] the right lane and a car just blew right
[51:32] by me and honked at me and and I was
[51:34] just you know listen to sermon I was
[51:35] doing everything right listen the
[51:37] server's driving not paying attention
[51:39] and I just worshiped I said thank you
[51:40] you don't thank you Jesus you protected
[51:43] my life and that's how this that's what
[51:45] every Christian does amen when God
[51:47] spares our lives when he calms our see
[51:50] Amen we just fall down and worship Him
[51:53] and say thank you lauren lee you could
[51:54] calm this see alright there's a few more
[51:59] of these I'm doing pretty good on time
[52:02] by God's grace okay Matthew 18 26 let's
[52:10] read that one just briefly this one ties
[52:12] in with Luke 11 and the woman who washes
[52:17] feet and was forgiven this one
[52:19] kind of ties in with that Matthew 18:26
[52:23] this is the parable the man who was
[52:25] forgiven all of his debt but then
[52:28] couldn't forgive somebody else I just
[52:30] want you to I'm gonna point out the
[52:32] price kunio the worship when he actually
[52:36] received forgiveness at first he
[52:38] actually came worshiping and that's the
[52:41] same thing the woman who washed his feet
[52:42] she came there worshipping everybody
[52:45] else stood there and but from the time
[52:47] she got there she didn't cease to to
[52:49] worship Jesus and her tears wash his
[52:51] feet and anoint his head she just kept
[52:54] going on and she was very generous and
[52:56] liberal with her worship amen it was
[52:58] extraordinary worship can I say like
[52:59] that
[53:00] hallelujah so Matthew 18 26 I'll read
[53:04] that one sorry the Sermon therefore fell
[53:08] down and worshiped him saying Lord have
[53:10] patience with me and I will pay diol so
[53:14] we're talking about just real sincere
[53:16] worship aren't we
[53:17] it's got to be sincere all these
[53:18] examples are people really falling down
[53:20] and all these examples Jesus meets their
[53:23] request in all these examples he loves
[53:26] he craves somebody that's sincere I'm on
[53:29] my last rope for I'm desperate and
[53:31] brother Graham said God always answers
[53:32] you when you're desperate praise God and
[53:34] it's a shame but sometimes it takes
[53:36] desperation to get us to that true
[53:38] worship but it's the true worship that
[53:41] God craves I went over this one we're
[53:46] not gonna read this one but in Matthew
[53:47] 20 verse 20 James and John's mother the
[53:54] wife of Zebedee she worship first and
[53:57] then desired a certain thing so she
[54:00] worship first and Jesus received that
[54:02] worship and said you know you have a
[54:04] good request but I can't give that to
[54:07] you only the father can give you or give
[54:09] that right hand in the left hand only oh
[54:12] that's that's predestinated who's on the
[54:14] right hand of Christ and the left hand
[54:16] of Christ
[54:16] that's predestinated but he never
[54:18] rebuked her because she came the right
[54:20] way she came through worship she came
[54:23] sincerely I've got a real sincere need
[54:25] she worship first
[54:33] now matthew 28:9 the women this is after
[54:41] Jesus was seen by Mary Magdalene member
[54:46] Mary Magdalene saw him first and she
[54:48] went to touch him and he said touch me
[54:49] not so after that he ascended and came
[54:52] right back down and now the women see
[54:55] him again and they grab ahold of him by
[54:57] his feet in matthew 28:9 and the bible
[55:01] said the women held Jesus by the feet
[55:03] and worshiped him
[55:05] so they poured out worship to the risen
[55:08] Christ I like that so just again showing
[55:12] this work this is how it you know if GE
[55:14] you know when Jesus I'll just let's just
[55:16] type it when Jesus appeared to you and
[55:18] showed he was alive and risen from the
[55:21] dead didn't she do the same thing fall
[55:23] down and worship saying there's a Living
[55:25] God amen Jesus Christ is alive
[55:27] hallelujah and you did the same thing
[55:29] you fell down at his feet and there came
[55:31] a peace so sweet there was that song is
[55:34] that a Miss he says oh now the comforter
[55:36] abides with me there it is right there
[55:37] he abides he abides hallelujah he abides
[55:40] with me Amen yes now this is interesting
[55:44] I Matthew 28 17 let's read that one kind
[55:49] of gets into the three kinds of
[55:51] believers in every gathering even when
[55:53] Jesus ascended to heaven there was
[55:55] doubters there some people were
[55:58] worshiping some people were doubting
[56:00] that's why you know I went even when we
[56:02] come to worship no matter where I'm at I
[56:04] have to remember there's always gonna be
[56:06] three kinds of believers but I can't let
[56:08] that hinder me I can't be discouraged by
[56:10] the doubters I've got to be a true
[56:11] worshiper amen
[56:13] hallelujah and I'm growing that way too
[56:15] you know sometimes I get discouraged if
[56:17] you know I can tell people are upset
[56:19] with me or they don't like to preach and
[56:20] you know visitors or whoever sometimes I
[56:23] got but I got to get past that and I
[56:24] just got to be a true worshiper I have
[56:27] to forget doubting forget vain worship
[56:30] right people that just go through the
[56:31] motions they're just singing you know
[56:33] they're just singing along it's not from
[56:34] their heart and I've got to let it flow
[56:36] from my heart so Matthew 28 17 lady can
[56:40] you read that for me darling
[56:46] there it is my a risen Christ can you
[56:50] imagine a risen Christ and still
[56:52] doubting the same thing today we have
[56:54] the Holy Ghost among us and people still
[56:57] doubt is Jesus alive or they doubt your
[56:59] testimony are you sure that happened you
[57:01] sure hi how do you know God healed that
[57:03] person right how are you sure that
[57:05] happened and they still doubt a
[57:07] resurrected Christ so god help us not to
[57:10] doubt help us just to believe amen but
[57:13] see you have that you have three types
[57:14] of believers but the true worshiper God
[57:17] helping us we press through any doubt
[57:19] and we believe the Word of God I love
[57:21] that I thought that was beautiful and
[57:25] here's something we've seen you know a
[57:26] few times
[57:27] first Corinthians 14 25 I think of you
[57:31] know and brother Amen came to the
[57:32] message first Corinthians 14 25 and I've
[57:41] heard different people you know not in
[57:42] the message with some of my friends tell
[57:45] stories about this like they came to
[57:47] church they were sinners and then it
[57:49] felt like the preacher was preaching
[57:50] right to them and what was it it was God
[57:53] discerning their heart God knew they
[57:56] wanted to be true worshipers right and
[57:58] it's like the whole sermon was directly
[58:00] to them glory that's God revealing
[58:04] himself and you and I have been there
[58:08] but I just thought you know with our
[58:10] church we've seen it happen to brother
[58:11] amen and I'm trying to think of a few
[58:13] others but we've seen it certainly
[58:15] happened where they fall on their face
[58:16] and I remember where they men fell on
[58:18] his face and it worship 1425 sis their
[58:23] money could you read that for us please
[58:34] amen to see how important is when you
[58:37] know no matter who's here but especially
[58:40] when visitors are here when unbelievers
[58:41] are here that's the time we really need
[58:43] to pray and really pull on the word of
[58:44] God even more so I mean for a Christian
[58:48] there's no service you can take off
[58:49] right but if there's unbelievers that's
[58:52] the time we got to pull and say God oh
[58:54] Jesus
[58:55] reveal yourself to them so they could
[58:57] actually fall
[58:58] in worship for the first time in their
[58:59] life because they were unbelievers
[59:01] before but now they're giving the
[59:04] prosecutor cheb now they know oh gods
[59:07] hear the word answered all my questions
[59:09] and now I'm a true worshipper Amen my
[59:13] hallelujah I'm glad it happened to me
[59:15] Amen by God's grace I remember falling
[59:18] down worship Me
[59:19] thank you Jesus amen I remember laying
[59:22] at the altar in Lima Ohio by God's grace
[59:25] hallelujah that's right it's so
[59:30] important that discernment of the word
[59:33] the preaching of the word can bring
[59:35] forth true worship now I want to show
[59:42] you this scripture before we finish
[59:43] revelation 13:15 you're familiar with
[59:46] this this is the mark of the beast
[59:47] chapter and this kind of ties in again
[59:54] with the the Roman soldiers Oh
[59:56] interesting Roman their Roman they had
[1:00:00] the exact same worship except it was a
[1:00:02] mockery and now here we see the bee
[1:00:05] system will have the exact same worship
[1:00:08] except it's false worship let me say
[1:00:12] like this it's actually will worship
[1:00:13] that's the one I forgot to get to this
[1:00:14] is will worship and I'll show you what
[1:00:16] that is it's pretty simple revelation
[1:00:19] 13:15
[1:00:22] [Music]
[1:00:25] yes okay
[1:00:27] are we done and he had power to give
[1:00:30] life unto the image of the Beast that
[1:00:31] the image of the Beast should both speak
[1:00:33] and cause that as many as would not
[1:00:36] worship the image of the Beast should be
[1:00:38] killed
[1:00:39] that's price you neo it's the same
[1:00:41] worship but it's will worship okay it
[1:00:46] looks the same and brother Branham gives
[1:00:50] that a beautiful example the church age
[1:00:51] book he said remember remember he said
[1:00:53] how the world loves to go to ball games
[1:00:55] remember he said they just don't sit
[1:00:57] like wallflowers he said they'd get in
[1:00:59] the spirit they paint their face some of
[1:01:02] the real fanatics paint their bodies to
[1:01:03] their real fanatics their real
[1:01:05] worshipers they paint their bodies and
[1:01:07] other Bram said that's how we he said
[1:01:08] we've got to get right into the feel of
[1:01:10] things
[1:01:11] we've got to come in to church and be a
[1:01:12] real worshiper getting the feel of it
[1:01:14] getting the feel of the song special
[1:01:16] getting in the feel of the worship
[1:01:18] service be a true worshipper amen but
[1:01:21] see it's the same worship except it's
[1:01:23] will worship and will worship is found
[1:01:26] in Colossians let's go there Colossians
[1:01:31] where man okay
[1:01:32] they're discussions 2:23 and Scofield
[1:01:36] connects this to Cain Cain did will
[1:01:39] worship you can you can put anybody in
[1:01:42] there you know that like Korah they were
[1:01:44] worshiping according to their will and
[1:01:46] not God's will like Cain said oh it's my
[1:01:51] will to bring fruit but God said blood
[1:01:53] so it's will worship thanks Malik I can
[1:01:57] you read that buddy up there for us
[1:01:58] thank you sir okay now if you read above
[1:02:13] this is speaking of they actually
[1:02:14] worship angels in the city of chaos they
[1:02:17] worship angels that's what he's talking
[1:02:19] about see they have a show of wisdom and
[1:02:21] we'll worship they look really smart it
[1:02:23] look like they're doing the right thing
[1:02:25] but it's will worship and will worship
[1:02:28] means worship which one prescribes and
[1:02:31] devises for himself so see they take
[1:02:34] their their own prescription rather than
[1:02:36] the eternal prescription Aaron is Amen
[1:02:39] Peter gave the eternal prescription
[1:02:41] repent and be baptized the name of Jesus
[1:02:43] Christ well anything outside that is
[1:02:45] self prescribed they didn't take the
[1:02:47] doctors fresh prescription all that you
[1:02:49] and I took the dr. Peters prescription
[1:02:51] glory amen
[1:02:53] I didn't catch that so right now thank
[1:02:55] you lord worship which one prescribe see
[1:02:58] their doctorate there you go there's a
[1:03:00] doctor dr. D lld and all these things
[1:03:04] PhD ll D we just want to go to the
[1:03:07] school of neurology amen that's all we
[1:03:09] want to be with the degrees of neurology
[1:03:13] so and it means contrary to the nature
[1:03:16] of faith in Christ so worshipping angels
[1:03:19] goes against the nature of Christ
[1:03:20] because the Bible said angels bow down
[1:03:23] and worship Christ but
[1:03:25] here we see with the B system their
[1:03:27] their worship looks exactly the same
[1:03:29] it has falling down and praises and
[1:03:32] hands raise and worship
[1:03:33] how many seen it on YouTube you know we
[1:03:35] all we all stream worship songs we like
[1:03:37] you know I'm sure we all do but you know
[1:03:41] the woman's got paint on it's a
[1:03:42] beautiful song and but then we like to
[1:03:43] we like to give our version of it here
[1:03:46] right and they have they might have a
[1:03:48] nice anointing you know women in pants
[1:03:50] and or a man who's you know not a very
[1:03:53] good man you know you understand what
[1:03:56] I'm saying but see we bring that that
[1:03:58] song has anointing it's inspired but
[1:04:01] they're using it through will worship
[1:04:03] and then weak because they prescribed
[1:04:05] their own worship to it you know they
[1:04:07] still cut their hair they're still wear
[1:04:08] makeup
[1:04:09] they still smoke cigarettes they still
[1:04:11] watch dirty movies you know but see but
[1:04:13] they have will worship their own
[1:04:14] prescription but when we bring that song
[1:04:17] into our churches it oughta glorify God
[1:04:19] and it does amen you see it's worship in
[1:04:22] spirit and in truth
[1:04:25] so there's those all kinds of vain
[1:04:28] worship there's vain worship mockery
[1:04:31] worship ignorant worship and we'll
[1:04:33] worship that's the third one I forgot
[1:04:35] will worship your own prescribed and
[1:04:39] that's Church and you understand in the
[1:04:41] message isn't that what a lot of people
[1:04:42] do they prescribed their own way to
[1:04:44] serve God they can say they follow
[1:04:47] brother branham I just heard brother I'm
[1:04:48] saying the token message and you've
[1:04:50] heard it but program says oh I believe
[1:04:52] every word you say brother Brown he said
[1:04:53] that's just being able to read I believe
[1:04:57] every word of God that's just being able
[1:04:59] to read the Bible he said get the token
[1:05:02] inside of you get Christ inside of you
[1:05:04] and your life will punctuate every word
[1:05:06] with an amen your life what you do your
[1:05:10] actions I'll bunk schooi ated the word
[1:05:13] with an amen
[1:05:15] okay so see it's the same worship in the
[1:05:17] bee system except it's misguided it's
[1:05:19] will worship and our worship is true
[1:05:22] worship by the Word of God so if you
[1:05:25] don't price Kony ho the Beast you die
[1:05:29] but we will not worship that we will
[1:05:31] prosecute near the Lord Jesus Christ now
[1:05:34] let me close with these two things here
[1:05:36] I think I got I mean I got plenty more I
[1:05:37] got plenty more scripture
[1:05:38] I could go on but I think I'll stop
[1:05:40] right here hmm
[1:05:47] well let me go I got way I still got 17
[1:05:56] minutes for a full hour so yeah let's go
[1:05:57] to these now we're not gonna read this
[1:06:01] but in Exodus 15 verses 19 to 21 there
[1:06:05] was song of Moses and dancing by Miriam
[1:06:08] after the victory over Pharaoh true
[1:06:11] worship right true believers worshiping
[1:06:14] in spirit
[1:06:15] in truth well Graham said if I ever saw
[1:06:17] a Pentecostal meeting it was there
[1:06:18] that's what he said down at the Red
[1:06:22] Sea's yours Miriam on the tambourine
[1:06:23] come on sisters follow me around let's
[1:06:25] go worship
[1:06:26] let's go praise the law or follow me
[1:06:27] come on that's what I hope one of my
[1:06:29] daughters will be a Miriam amen you'll
[1:06:31] lead to work you'll relieve the sisters
[1:06:33] in worship a matter somebody we need
[1:06:36] brothers out words like sing like Moses
[1:06:38] amen hallelujah see that's a Pentecostal
[1:06:43] experience hallelujah now I don't know
[1:06:47] if you knew this my preaches years ago
[1:06:48] it's got a micah chapter 6
[1:06:51] now remember Micah was a prophet I
[1:06:54] believe during the days of Joel or right
[1:06:56] after Joe if I'm not mistaken which was
[1:06:58] right by King Josiah
[1:06:59] so in other words at the end of the time
[1:07:01] of Israel's time in the promised land
[1:07:04] before they're dispersed so this is like
[1:07:08] almost in times of the judgement now
[1:07:13] Micah 6 1 to 8 Micah 6 we won't read all
[1:07:19] this I just want to hit the highlights I
[1:07:21] think this will encourage you know
[1:07:23] everybody in other words if in verse 2
[1:07:27] God had a controversy against the people
[1:07:29] in other words he had a case against
[1:07:31] them they had not served the Lord look
[1:07:35] at verse 3 all my people what have I
[1:07:36] done unto thee and where and have I
[1:07:38] wearied thee testify against me I look
[1:07:41] at God saying where have I worn you out
[1:07:42] have I worn you out to do the Word of
[1:07:44] God people say I'm too tired to worship
[1:07:47] I'm too tired to serve God God is like
[1:07:49] where if I worry we read you see the
[1:07:52] thing
[1:07:52] as people wear out themselves I've got
[1:07:54] to be careful I don't wear out myself
[1:07:56] right
[1:07:57] God doesn't wear us out God wants us to
[1:08:00] serve but God's not the one wearing us
[1:08:02] out he said where did I were you what if
[1:08:05] I asked you to do that so hard right
[1:08:08] look at these now here's what I want to
[1:08:10] get to verse four before I brought thee
[1:08:13] up out of the land of Egypt and redeemed
[1:08:14] thee out of the house of my servants and
[1:08:16] I sent before thee look at this Moses
[1:08:18] Aaron and who Miriam God said Miriam
[1:08:24] sisters my children my little girls God
[1:08:27] can send you to be a leader in worship
[1:08:30] do you see that I'm not talking about a
[1:08:32] song here at the pulpit I'm talking
[1:08:33] about somebody that gets in the spirit
[1:08:34] and worships you see that God sent
[1:08:39] Miriam to the people of course Moses and
[1:08:41] Aaron the prophet in the priesthood
[1:08:43] you know the Prophet and them for other
[1:08:44] preaching gifts we'd say but Miriam was
[1:08:47] sent to them to God wanted the women to
[1:08:49] see somebody who was free in the spirit
[1:08:51] praise the Lord a true worshiper a man
[1:08:54] Oh hallelujah
[1:08:55] thank you lord that's thought I'd share
[1:08:58] that with you that really blessed my
[1:08:59] heart that was beautiful
[1:09:03] now go down to verse 8 God has showed
[1:09:09] the oh man what is good and what does
[1:09:11] the Lord require thee but to do justly
[1:09:13] to love mercy to walk humbly with that
[1:09:19] God God's not the one wearing us out we
[1:09:22] wear ourselves out we don't slow down
[1:09:24] right we schedule too much I schedule
[1:09:27] too much we schedule too much is not God
[1:09:30] wearing us out all God requires us to
[1:09:35] live justly love mercy and walk humbly I
[1:09:41] just want to show that God sent Miriam
[1:09:43] she was a prophetess too I believe if
[1:09:45] I'm not mistaken I'm not real familiar
[1:09:47] on that don't have to look that up but
[1:09:50] also as a worship leader a true
[1:09:51] worshipper was mirrored that's why I
[1:09:54] like when Lydia nikkei she would play
[1:09:56] the tambourine I like that I like that
[1:09:58] get him worshiping you know get them
[1:10:00] phrasing the Lord because you never know
[1:10:01] how God's going to use you you never
[1:10:02] know
[1:10:03] you never know so God sent her as an
[1:10:08] example of true worship you know this
[1:10:11] story but in 2nd samuel 6 14 to 23 david
[1:10:15] was dancing before the lord when the ark
[1:10:17] returned and Mike our Mikkel Mitchell
[1:10:22] I'm not sure how to say that Michael may
[1:10:23] be Dishonored David and because she was
[1:10:28] scorned full member the Bible said she
[1:10:30] said to see the scornful because she was
[1:10:33] scornful she couldn't bring forth life
[1:10:36] and see when we don't get free in the
[1:10:39] spirit when we're not generous in the
[1:10:40] spirit people we die spiritually right
[1:10:43] people die spiritually because they they
[1:10:45] they disregard the worship Jesus wants
[1:10:50] to be worshipped Jesus craves our
[1:10:51] worship he craves it he wants someone
[1:10:54] that will worship Him prosecute I will
[1:10:57] bow before him run up to him love him
[1:10:59] love the master worship the master be
[1:11:03] unashamed to worship the master and if
[1:11:05] not he makes them barren he doesn't give
[1:11:07] them the Holy Ghost he doesn't give them
[1:11:09] life right no new births you see that
[1:11:12] that's true no new births no births at
[1:11:16] all for Michael all right now let me
[1:11:24] close with this here I think I'm yeah
[1:11:25] I'm ready close down now I've got
[1:11:26] through most of scriptures but not all
[1:11:28] of them most of them but not all all
[1:11:31] right let's go to Hebrews 13:15 this is
[1:11:37] getting back to kings and priests this
[1:11:38] thought on kings and priests I just want
[1:11:42] to close with this and I so appreciate
[1:11:44] you coming out to the house Lord tonight
[1:11:45] and so appreciative for your sacrifice
[1:11:48] and hearing the Word of God and we're
[1:11:50] never disappointed not I've never been
[1:11:51] this one one time where I've ever gone
[1:11:52] to church God's never let me down I've
[1:11:54] never been disappointed just like the
[1:11:57] Prophet God said I just want to close
[1:12:00] with this thought about kings and
[1:12:01] priests to get so I think it'll be a
[1:12:02] blessing to you okay
[1:12:09] so Hebrews 13:15 Malachi can read that
[1:12:11] for me sir amen so I'm closing with this
[1:12:23] thought just continual worship God loves
[1:12:26] continual worship continual worship and
[1:12:33] what does it look like our lips remember
[1:12:36] we got his word in our mouth we're
[1:12:38] constantly giving him thanks thank you
[1:12:40] Jesus thank you for this trial thank you
[1:12:42] for this victory amen thank you for
[1:12:44] everything and last one let's go to the
[1:12:50] last one Luke 24 52 and 53 Luke 24 52
[1:12:56] and 53
[1:13:10] Luke 24:52 why don't we stand on our
[1:13:12] feet that will help us to be refreshed a
[1:13:14] little bit by God's grace okay so this
[1:13:19] is after the resurrection this is after
[1:13:21] Jesus ascended to heaven so this is what
[1:13:28] Holy Ghost filled apostles do so we know
[1:13:32] if they did it we know we'll do the same
[1:13:34] thing and so it's encouraging that we're
[1:13:36] here tonight on a Sunday night doing the
