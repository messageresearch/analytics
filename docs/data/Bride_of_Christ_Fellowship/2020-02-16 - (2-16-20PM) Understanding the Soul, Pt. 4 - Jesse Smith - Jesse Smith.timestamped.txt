[23:54] the Lord willing I like to look at
[23:56] understanding the soul part for like to
[24:00] get back into this little study here the
[24:02] Lord would help us to do that let's go -
[24:08] let me get a scripture here we can start
[24:11] with it we look at a few thoughts what
[24:16] is the soil a little bit further on that
[24:18] and some terminology for the Holy Ghost
[24:22] baptism and then we'll look at Old
[24:24] Testament examples of people being
[24:26] filled with the spirit yes let's go to
[24:31] Psalms 42 verse 2
[24:44] Psalms 42 verse 2 thank you appreciate
[24:55] dedication thanks for taking the speed
[24:57] down Genevieve there I'll be still
[24:59] napping in the van okay okay let me set
[25:09] a 1/2 hour timer and then we'll see how
[25:12] far we get in half an hour because we
[25:15] want to be mindful here for my wife so
[25:18] let's look at understanding the soul
[25:21] part for Psalms 42 verse 2
[25:26] let's read out lets me just read that
[25:28] together we can all read that on three
[25:29] one two three
[25:31] my soul thirsts for God for the Living
[25:34] God when shall I come and appear before
[25:38] God
[25:39] that's how weird a prayer for him you
[25:40] know in your heart let's make an order
[25:41] to the Lord here having a father we love
[25:43] you Lord God we ask you to bless our
[25:45] service here teach us through your word
[25:47] Lord and this father Lord as I've felt
[25:49] I've really grown in this area this soul
[25:51] help us to be able to relate it through
[25:52] the scripture and bless your people
[25:55] father as we wait upon you and look to
[25:56] your word in Jesus Christ's name the
[25:59] church said amen god bless you didn't
[26:01] see the praise God
[26:03] [Music]
[26:07] okay so Lord willing tonight let's take
[26:10] a few minutes here and let's look at
[26:11] what is the soul and I can't quite
[26:15] remember what we went over here so I
[26:17] guess I'll just go as much go as far
[26:19] here as I can and then I'll probably ask
[26:23] you for a little feedback here I know we
[26:25] looked a little bit at the soul I wanted
[26:30] to find it though real quick I don't
[26:31] really have any slides so sorry about
[26:33] that don't have any slides so I look
[26:36] into the scripture here the soul define
[26:39] is your nature your will or your desire
[26:43] and it's the will of the human spirit so
[26:47] each one of us is a spear being but the
[26:52] nature of that or
[26:53] the will of that human spirit is the
[26:55] soul it's closely connected of course to
[26:59] the human spirit but it's separate from
[27:01] it it is like the inside core of the
[27:04] human spirit we'd say now from birth all
[27:14] the way to the time a person makes
[27:17] either a decision for Christ or we'd say
[27:20] goes past the line of mercy and judgment
[27:22] everyone has a thirst for God it's a
[27:25] holy thirst for God as we just saw David
[27:28] said my soul thirsts for God the Living
[27:31] God and God designed this on purpose
[27:35] because God wants to have fellowship
[27:37] with you well praise the lord god bless
[27:39] you brother thank you good to see you
[27:42] sir we just prayed for James and you
[27:45] buddy praise the Lord
[27:47] so God designed this because he wants to
[27:50] have fellowship with you now he looked
[27:53] at it on Wednesday a little bit or I'm
[27:54] sorry - Wednesday's ago you and I live
[27:57] in the human spirit we're kind of like
[27:58] in the middle zone right we have the
[28:00] flesh on this side and we got we got the
[28:02] flesh call out feed me I'm thirsty
[28:05] feed me but we're in here in the human
[28:08] spirit in the mind but then we got the
[28:10] soul cried out feed me I need time with
[28:13] the Lord right I need God's anointing I
[28:15] need I need I need more of God I want to
[28:18] talk with the Lord and so what we're
[28:20] here in the mind and we gotta learn to
[28:22] meet new the needs of both thirst but
[28:28] God designed you that way he designed us
[28:30] so we would have a thirst for him and
[28:32] it's a great sin to hush that holy
[28:35] thirst - it's the it's awful sin it's
[28:40] the sin of turning down God we call it
[28:42] the reprobate mind like Romans 1 talks
[28:45] about the Bible said they knew the
[28:48] knowledge of God but they failed to give
[28:51] glory to God right in Romans chapter 1
[28:53] let's just read that here since we're
[28:55] there Romans 1 let me pull it up I know
[29:00] it's at the end of the chapter
[29:05] and that's this course is the beautiful
[29:07] chapter I mentioned it I feel like I
[29:09] mentioned it more than ever because it
[29:11] says without excuse in fact a holiness
[29:14] woman called me on Monday and I talked
[29:15] to her about an hour and a half and she
[29:18] was just blown away by our doctrine
[29:19] she's like that makes sense about the
[29:21] three works of grace and she never heard
[29:23] that before and I talked about this
[29:27] scripture here how all men are without
[29:29] excuse in Romans chapter one and she had
[29:33] she had a hard time believing anybody
[29:34] could be lost but I tried to show her by
[29:37] the scripture that God doesn't want
[29:39] anybody with anybody to be lost but
[29:41] Jesus said few there be that find it so
[29:45] it's a great it's a great thing God
[29:47] wants people to be saved but few people
[29:49] actually want to be saved you a few
[29:52] people actually listen to that soul
[29:54] thirst brother man said they hush it by
[29:56] giving it you know like music or sexual
[30:00] relationships or sports or or money or
[30:03] lands or houses or you know things like
[30:06] that
[30:07] they try to hush that holy thirst by
[30:11] searching for other things but Romans 1
[30:16] it's 18 to 21 for the wrath of God is
[30:22] revealed from heaven against all
[30:23] ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
[30:25] who hold the truth in unrighteousness so
[30:29] see they know the truth they just don't
[30:31] do it
[30:32] have you ever watched those Ray Comfort
[30:35] videos he'll be he'll be taking people
[30:37] through like the the Ten Commandments
[30:41] it'll say like do you have any idea what
[30:43] God did for sinners that they might be
[30:44] saved and would you imagine how many
[30:48] would you imagine what you think most
[30:49] people would know or to think few people
[30:51] would know it's kind of that's kind of a
[30:54] half way I'm surprised a lot of people
[30:57] know they think Oh God they know God
[31:00] sent his son like it seems like half the
[31:02] people know and not even going to church
[31:05] it's like it's just they know they've
[31:08] been around they hear churches you know
[31:09] they watch the tea they watch the TV
[31:10] they listen the Internet they know
[31:13] there's something inside of people to
[31:15] this holy thirst that they want to know
[31:18] what what good God do for sinners to
[31:21] save them so see the Bible says they
[31:24] have the truth but they hold it in
[31:26] unrighteousness they don't treat it the
[31:28] right way
[31:29] verse 19 because that which may be known
[31:31] of God is manifest in them for God has
[31:34] showed it unto them so God shows himself
[31:36] in each person's body they have to admit
[31:38] Wow I must have US I must have a creator
[31:41] because my heart beats autonomously my
[31:43] mind thinks I must have a creator it's
[31:45] inside of me God showed his power inside
[31:48] of my body verse 24 the invisible things
[31:50] of him from the creation of the world
[31:53] are clearly seen being understood by the
[31:55] things that are made even his eternal
[31:57] power and Godhead so that they are
[32:00] without excuse that's right
[32:04] so see there they are there they are
[32:06] without excuse now let me yeah where it
[32:15] is verse 28 now if you would go to verse
[32:16] 28 and even as they did not like to
[32:19] retain God in their knowledge God gave
[32:22] them over to a reprobate mind to do
[32:24] those things which are not convenient do
[32:33] believe there was a scripture in there
[32:34] that said they were haters of God yeah
[32:38] verse 30 backbiters and haters of God
[32:41] keep a genetic God shows them his power
[32:43] in creation God shows them his power in
[32:48] their human body and yet they don't want
[32:50] to keep God's knowledge so they end up
[32:53] hating God oh it's an awful thing Church
[32:56] isn't an awful thing to think of at the
[32:57] very one that created the very one who
[32:59] wants to fellowship with them they turn
[33:01] him down oh man my it's heartbreaking
[33:04] mercy so God gives them over if they
[33:07] don't want to fellowship God said fine
[33:08] he said you couldn't have a reprobate
[33:11] mind I'll let you I'll give you I'll
[33:13] give you the lie you want to believe
[33:14] others there's no such thing as God it's
[33:16] all evolution and they'll be damned by
[33:18] it the Bible says how sad see the soul
[33:22] has the natural holy thirst for God just
[33:26] like the body has the natural thirst for
[33:28] water if the body's denied water
[33:32] have the souls denied the eternal spirit
[33:35] it it it dies it'll be separated from
[33:38] God eventually praise the Lord now I
[33:45] want you to note this that brother man
[33:48] talks about this he said everything
[33:51] every person longs to worship something
[33:53] right so in every person in every
[33:57] culture no matter how primitive or
[33:59] wealthy or poor urban or rural mankind
[34:04] loves to worship men have to worship
[34:05] something right they have to worship
[34:07] something but the Bible says those that
[34:10] realize there's a creator God will
[34:13] accept so let's go to acts 10:34 X 1034
[34:18] proves this he's uh he's a respecter I'm
[34:32] sorry he's not a respecter of any person
[34:34] then Peter opened his mouth and said Oh
[34:37] of a truth I perceive that God is no
[34:39] respecter of persons
[34:41] glory but in every nation he that
[34:45] feareth him and worketh righteousness is
[34:46] accepted with him does that make you
[34:48] feel good sister Wendy like even in Hong
[34:50] Kong
[34:50] God does not respect Americans more than
[34:54] Hong Kong right bang Laos God and for me
[34:59] mine was Mexico or Spain each one of us
[35:03] we can trace back our lineage God does
[35:06] not respect one nation above any other
[35:08] he is just as real and Laos as he is
[35:12] here in America just as real in Africa
[35:15] and Asia and any land he's not a
[35:18] respecter of persons he shows himself
[35:21] real in each person and he makes himself
[35:23] known through nature the things that we
[35:27] can see that's right but in every nation
[35:31] he that feareth him and worketh
[35:33] righteousness is accepted with him
[35:37] that's why I tried to tell that woman I
[35:39] said I said there's going to be
[35:40] surprised on the day of judgment they're
[35:43] going to be surprised they're gonna say
[35:44] when did I do you any good
[35:45] they're not even gonna know that they
[35:47] did Jesus good but it's because they
[35:49] feared God and they knew if someone's
[35:52] hurting if someone's sick if someone
[35:54] doesn't have clothes I know I just want
[35:56] to help them there's something about me
[35:57] something wholly about me that I feel
[36:00] like I need to help them out and Jesus
[36:02] says when you've done it to them you've
[36:04] done it to me praise God amen now in the
[36:08] soul is free more agency this is your
[36:12] autonomous choice it's up to you it's a
[36:15] gift from God life on Earth is a gift
[36:18] but salvation unto eternal life is even
[36:21] greater gift right and it's yours to
[36:24] gain or lose jesus said in mark 8:36 for
[36:27] what shall it profit a man if he gain
[36:29] the whole world and lose his own soul
[36:33] see God does not force any soul to
[36:37] follow him or repent from their sins but
[36:39] he graciously offers mercy and warnings
[36:42] to all I want you to see this is
[36:46] beautiful if you could sister Wendy Pope
[36:48] James 5:20 this is just beautiful
[36:49] beautiful here I love how the Bible just
[36:52] states things it just kind of gives us a
[36:54] clearer picture in James 5:20 soul
[36:59] directs your way so think about where
[37:02] you've walked can you just may be back
[37:04] let's just rewind 10 years 2010 the 2010
[37:09] where were you brother back I I just
[37:14] moved to Doyle's down in 2010 that's why
[37:16] that's why I said that cuz I knew where
[37:17] I was just because that day stands out
[37:21] for me that year rather he's probably
[37:24] running a marathon something for the
[37:28] children came along but your way since
[37:32] just just 10 years your way has been
[37:35] directed by your soul because the Bible
[37:38] says your soul directs your way look at
[37:40] this let him know that he which
[37:42] converteth the sinner from the error of
[37:45] his way shall save a soul from death and
[37:50] shall hide a multitude of sin so our way
[37:54] the way we've chose in the last 10 years
[37:57] we'll say 20 for me
[37:59] at the end of 2001 so basically 2002 so
[38:02] the last 18 years my way has been
[38:05] directed by my soul and that's why
[38:07] brother Ram says you know people that
[38:08] wondered I have the Holy Ghost he says
[38:10] look what you were and look what you are
[38:13] now what is he saying look at the way
[38:15] you walked right look at the steps
[38:18] you've walked in what path are you
[38:20] following
[38:21] are you following a wise path or a
[38:24] foolish path or a sinful path we all
[38:26] want to be able to say we're walking in
[38:27] a wise path amen redeeming the time
[38:31] because the days are evil praise God now
[38:40] with three more agency each person
[38:43] either accepts faith for the soul or
[38:48] unbelief they have the choice if faith
[38:51] has chosen god directs them to heaven
[38:53] it's faith is direct directed unbelief
[38:56] is their default state and Satan then
[38:59] directs Satan and his demons direct them
[39:01] to hell remember the Bible said in
[39:03] Timothy Paul said their sinners are
[39:06] taken snare by the devil at his own will
[39:10] right
[39:11] so when they submit to Satan's will they
[39:15] get caught up in Satan's will that's the
[39:17] kind of a fresh thought there I hadn't
[39:19] really thought about that lately because
[39:22] ezekiel 18:4 says the soul that sinneth
[39:26] it shall die
[39:29] so to reject faith is to make the
[39:34] ultimate final sin because it determines
[39:37] your eternal destiny sinning is missing
[39:42] the mark in the hebrew it's wandering
[39:44] from the way in other words so the soul
[39:47] that wanders from the way or sins or
[39:50] misses the mark it shall die that's what
[39:53] the Word of God teaches therefore it's
[39:55] your soul that chooses every action the
[39:59] soul does either good which is faith or
[40:01] evil unbelief okay sister Wendy keep
[40:04] hope romans 2 9 and 10 romans 2 9 and 10
[40:16] now I just had a little thought here I
[40:18] want to look up that scripture where the
[40:22] Bible said the eyes run to and fro
[40:33] you see if I can find that I thought I
[40:35] put it in this study
[40:47] where the Bible said he would search for
[40:50] Souls okay I can't find it
[40:53] he must not be in this one I'm sorry
[40:58] okay so let's go back here I want to
[41:01] find that though because the Bible said
[41:03] God is searching I thought I put that in
[41:05] the study maybe it's in another chapter
[41:06] anyways Romans 2:9 tribulation and
[41:10] anguish anguish upon every soul of man
[41:13] that doeth evil so see it's the soul
[41:15] that does the evil it's the nature right
[41:18] it's the nature in the soul why did I do
[41:20] that why did I do that see that doeth
[41:24] evil the soul does the evil that nature
[41:27] of the Jew first and also the Gentile
[41:29] but glory honor and peace to every man
[41:32] that worketh good to the Jew first and
[41:34] also to the Gentile here's a clear
[41:36] example brother Branham gives he said a
[41:38] man that's not born again if he sees a
[41:41] immorally dress women if he doesn't have
[41:44] the born-again experience in the soul he
[41:46] said it'll start making plans on how to
[41:48] contact her to get her phone number
[41:50] right that's because he's gonna do
[41:53] something about it she has this lust he
[41:56] has this evil thought and he said
[41:57] brother I said if he's not born again
[41:59] he'll start making plans about doing
[42:03] something about it okay so that's that's
[42:06] what the Scriptures saying every soul of
[42:08] man that doeth evil of the Jew first and
[42:11] also the Gentile but glory honor and
[42:13] peace to every man that worketh good to
[42:17] the Jew first and then to then to the
[42:19] Gentile okay so I just wanted to prove
[42:23] that by the the scripture that it's the
[42:28] soul that ultimately directs that now
[42:32] look it up right now the eyes of the
[42:33] Lord run to and fro I do believe that
[42:35] that is a scripture cuz it just came to
[42:38] my mind here I want to see if I can find
[42:40] that
[42:46] yeah they're just you okay Zecharia for
[42:48] 10 if you could please pull that up
[42:50] sister Wendy Zechariah for 10 who had
[43:00] this spies the day of small things they
[43:02] can read this a few weeks ago didn't we
[43:04] looked at the Bible study of Ezra
[43:06] Nehemiah who hath despised the day of
[43:09] small things for they shall rejoice and
[43:11] shall see the plummet in the hand of
[43:13] zoomable with those 7 they are the eyes
[43:16] of the Lord which run to and fro through
[43:20] the whole earth amen
[43:23] so here brother man talks about this in
[43:26] the church age book talks about the eyes
[43:28] the Lord he talks about seers or
[43:30] prophets so one way this can represent
[43:32] prophets and how God sends prophets
[43:35] throughout the whole world there's
[43:38] another one let me see if I can pull
[43:42] this one up here real quick I just kind
[43:44] of come into my mind I didn't have this
[43:45] one God searches the earth here for a
[43:53] believer oh yeah there to say yeah there
[43:58] it is earnest glory second chronicles
[43:59] 16:9 thank the Lord here sorry I thought
[44:03] I had these in there I do apologize I
[44:04] really thought I had these in my notes
[44:06] but I don't must be a different study
[44:09] yes yes there it is right here glory now
[44:13] this is so encouraging so whether you
[44:15] live in Laos where they live in Mexico
[44:17] or Spain
[44:18] wherever you live God's I like the song
[44:21] says God's eyes on the sparrow praise
[44:23] God but here the Bible said the Lord
[44:25] searches them out for the eyes Lord run
[44:28] to and fro throughout the whole earth to
[44:29] show himself strong where in the behalf
[44:32] of them whose heart is perfect toward
[44:35] him memory is not a respecter person's
[44:38] anyone's heart in any country whether
[44:40] China right
[44:41] whether Germany Russian and we think all
[44:46] these communist countries have no
[44:47] believers no they do they do God is
[44:50] looking he's searching the earth for
[44:53] someone whose heart is right someone
[44:56] whose soul who's hungry for God and
[44:58] he'll show himself to
[45:00] them hey man here now it's done
[45:02] foolishly therefore from henceforth thou
[45:04] shalt have Wars you write that down 2nd
[45:07] chronicles 16:9 I can't believe I don't
[45:09] have that in here then Zechariah 4:10 so
[45:18] I want to make that point Church this is
[45:19] this is a blessing this is such a
[45:22] wonderful promise of God God loves every
[45:26] soul he tries to save every soul and he
[45:28] sends his eyes he sends preachers out
[45:30] and then he sends his holy spirit out
[45:32] anyone who's hungry anyone has a good
[45:34] heart God will show himself to them amen
[45:36] what a consolation praise God hallelujah
[45:39] how God loves the Soul he loves the
[45:41] sinner soul praise God thank you Jesus
[45:45] hallelujah see every soul worship
[45:48] someone or something the souls of faith
[45:53] rejecters choose to disbelieve God but
[45:56] their souls still worship Satan
[45:58] according to their own wills and if you
[46:02] could sister pull up Colossians 2:23
[46:13] look at this here this is beautiful this
[46:18] proves the will of God is in the soul
[46:21] yeah that's right right here let's go
[46:25] real slow on this which things have
[46:27] indeed a shoe of wisdom in right here it
[46:30] is will worship right there it is well I
[46:34] was really blessed somebody preach that
[46:35] reason I was like that's right or maybe
[46:37] I was listening online or Facebook or
[46:39] something like that some preacher and
[46:41] they used will worship and I thought
[46:43] there it is
[46:44] well it's from the Wills the soul and
[46:49] humility and neglecting of the body not
[46:52] in honor in any honor to the satisfying
[46:55] of the flesh now church have you read
[46:57] from verse 16 up when I could do it
[46:59] right now they're talking about
[47:00] worshipping angels Paul said there was
[47:03] people worshipping angels and he said
[47:05] that's will worship you wanted to do it
[47:09] it's worship anyone that's worshipping
[47:11] Devils or angels they're doing it from
[47:12] their own Souls their will is wrong
[47:16] instead of worshipping God they're worse
[47:18] than than the Creator they're worshiping
[47:20] the creation
[47:21] snow were so different than worshipping
[47:23] a stone Idol right or a wood Idol
[47:25] whether you worship an angel or demon
[47:27] whatever it is because it's will worship
[47:32] so or it's either will worship or you
[47:34] could say worshipping and self will this
[47:38] is the default mode of soul worship for
[47:41] anyone who rejects God's requirements
[47:43] for true worship right because true
[47:46] worship is done in what spirit and truth
[47:49] but if you turn down the spirit worship
[47:52] and the true worship of the God of
[47:53] heaven who's going around all the earth
[47:56] searching for somebody whose heart is
[47:58] right amen
[47:59] then the only thing left is will worship
[48:02] ah
[48:04] because he'll let you worship according
[48:06] to your will if you want to my God is so
[48:09] merciful to save a wretch like me praise
[48:12] God thank you Jesus
[48:14] John 4:24 God is a spirit and they that
[48:17] worship Him must worship Him in spirit
[48:18] and in truth
[48:19] Cain is the first human will worship
[48:22] example in the Bible in Genesis 4 1 2 7
[48:27] did you know this brother Ram said Kane
[48:29] should have been happy when God sent
[48:32] fire on Abel's sacrifice do you know her
[48:34] have said that oh man I have to find the
[48:37] quote but I know he said it because I
[48:39] saved it I got it somewhere brother Ram
[48:41] said case you know went back and said
[48:43] praise the Lord
[48:44] Abel God vindicated your sacrifice now
[48:47] we know how to worship God but instead
[48:49] of getting happy that his brother got
[48:51] the Holy Ghost and he did it he got
[48:54] jealous and God even said if you worship
[48:58] like your brother you'll lead you'll be
[49:00] the pastor of the church cuz just say
[49:01] like that or you you'll be the head of
[49:03] the family whatever you want to say
[49:04] you'll be the leader but Cain chose will
[49:09] worship he's I'm in a worship or I'm
[49:11] gonna worship with my vegetables and my
[49:13] fruits it's my will I want to give that
[49:15] and so he got angry he got very wroth
[49:17] the Bible said against God eventually
[49:20] murdering Abel and then Abel's blood
[49:22] cried from the ground I thought about
[49:25] that Jia recently New York was in New
[49:27] York they found a bunch of the I hate to
[49:31] say this but they found I have a bunch
[49:32] of leftovers from the abortion clinics
[49:34] married in church now think about that
[49:36] then they were put there in a spot
[49:38] they're not supposed to be think about
[49:39] the voice of the blood calling from the
[49:42] ground brother BAM said and the Bible
[49:45] said they go up to heaven remember all
[49:48] the sins of Sodom and Gomorrah the Bible
[49:49] said the Christ came up before God and
[49:52] he just found some more this week how
[49:54] awful was that my goodness
[49:57] those souls crying out for revenge right
[50:00] that's like the faithful Jews Lord
[50:03] avenge our blood God will thank goodness
[50:07] because the will worship the evil of
[50:10] will worship said of accepting God's
[50:12] worship true worship my goodness Jesus
[50:20] says God's one way to salvation is him I
[50:23] am the way the truth and the life but
[50:26] remember the that we must correct people
[50:27] from the error of their way the air of
[50:31] their way and remember up if you could
[50:36] since both Isaiah 35 8 this way is so
[50:40] simple of
[50:41] fool will not air they're in the way of
[50:43] holiness and a highway shall there be in
[50:47] a way that should be called the way of
[50:49] holiness
[50:49] the unclean shall not pass over it but
[50:52] it should be for those the wayfaring men
[50:54] though fools should not err therein see
[51:01] even fools unto me this is like speaking
[51:04] of foolish virgin look they they can't
[51:06] even arenít even though they're fools
[51:08] they can still find because remember
[51:11] their their version to the word right
[51:13] their version they have a form of
[51:14] holiness which is genuine holiness they
[51:17] just didn't go all the way see there be
[51:20] a highway there be a way I am the way
[51:23] the truth and the life the word is the
[51:26] way praise God
[51:27] Amen now I got a couple most at 30
[51:32] minutes so let me find let's close with
[51:33] this examples here I just kind of felt
[51:38] led to go over this I don't think I've
[51:39] ever gone over this I want to go over
[51:43] just some Old Testament examples let's
[51:47] read John 7 though first John 7 39 real
[51:50] quick let's read this since we're on the
[51:54] soul I want to look at how the soul of
[51:58] the Old Testament Saints could not be
[51:59] born again I just want to give some
[52:00] clear examples this was really fresh to
[52:02] me when I wrote on it a couple maybe a
[52:04] couple of weeks or months ago now here
[52:07] Jesus
[52:08] Troy preached on this one and I actually
[52:10] I was even riding on that in my book a
[52:13] couple weeks before he preached this I
[52:14] wrote I wrote almost exactly what he
[52:16] preached on a couple weeks before he
[52:18] preached it was it was really inspired
[52:20] but this spake he of the Spirit which
[52:22] they that believe on him should receive
[52:24] for the Holy Ghost was not yet given
[52:26] because that Jesus was not yet glorified
[52:29] okay so that means the baptism the Holy
[52:32] Ghost could not be given until Jesus
[52:35] died raised ascended to heaven the
[52:39] father accepted the sacrifice and then
[52:41] Jesus gets a glorified body and he comes
[52:44] down and he and then you know then he
[52:46] sent then he goes away and then he sends
[52:47] the Holy Ghost of the day of Pentecost
[52:49] their souls could not be born again
[52:54] now I want to look at some clear
[52:57] examples here so everybody can see this
[53:00] grace of the Lord sorry that's me I just
[53:04] got some static here tonight so let's
[53:09] look at some of the examples here
[53:12] there's quite a few and then let me set
[53:18] a timer here yeah I may just mention
[53:28] some of these here so I'll try to go 45
[53:31] minutes so more willing I try to go
[53:32] finish in 15 minutes maybe less now
[53:36] here's how I do in the book I do a I
[53:38] show how man has three parts body spirit
[53:41] and soul and then I do a uh what do they
[53:45] call it
[53:45] I forget what I called it there I can't
[53:49] remember anyways I just show how the
[53:54] Holy Ghost can't be in the body I've
[53:56] sought the seal the Holy Ghost rather
[53:58] the seal can't be in the mind so it's
[54:01] got to be in the soul okay
[54:04] process of elimination that's the word
[54:06] I'm looking for
[54:07] that's the phrase I'm looking for the
[54:08] process of elimination it can't be in
[54:11] the body because Paul said in my flesh
[54:14] dwelleth inge well then the seal of God
[54:16] can't be in your in your body and then
[54:18] the Bible says renew your mind daily it
[54:22] must be transformed daily so the seal of
[54:25] God can't be in the mind right but then
[54:30] the Bible says you're sealed to the day
[54:32] of redemption
[54:33] so that lasts from the time you're
[54:35] sealed till the time you get a new body
[54:37] well that can't be the mind because the
[54:39] mind needs renewed every day it has
[54:41] there's all in one place left process of
[54:43] elimination it's got to be the soul if
[54:46] people can't see that well they're just
[54:47] not trying to see it it should be so
[54:49] plain right now let's go through some
[54:51] examples and I think this will be a
[54:53] blessing to you and I'm gonna go right
[54:59] in order I think yeah I think I go in
[55:00] order in the book maybe you've heard
[55:03] these before maybe you forgot but this
[55:05] is encouraging to see did you know
[55:08] the Bible said Joseph was it looked like
[55:11] Joseph was filled with the Holy Spirit
[55:12] in the Bible Genesis 41 38 pharaoh said
[55:16] can we find such a one as this a man in
[55:20] whom the Spirit of God is he was such a
[55:23] godly man Joseph so it looks like Joseph
[55:28] was filled with the Holy Spirit now we
[55:29] could say his mind was anointed with the
[55:31] Holy Spirit
[55:32] many many times almost all the time
[55:35] because he kept it kept renewing his
[55:37] mind
[55:38] Exodus 28 3 says there were wise hearted
[55:44] Jews were filled with the spirit of
[55:47] wisdom in order to make Aaron's priestly
[55:50] garments filled with the spirit of
[55:55] wisdom see a lot of people will say Oh
[55:58] see I've heard different preachers I
[56:00] would say some very well-respected
[56:02] preachers and I respect in denominations
[56:05] or non denominations they say the Holy
[56:08] Ghost is the same in the Old Testament
[56:09] as a new what we know different than
[56:11] that Jesus just said that but these are
[56:13] the scriptures they point to it and they
[56:14] have a very Ballack like to them it's
[56:16] very valid right it looks like they are
[56:18] filled right never I see that word
[56:20] filled you know it just says they're
[56:23] filled so the the common preacher thinks
[56:26] okay well then they have to have the
[56:27] same Holy Spirit but you have to read
[56:29] more of the New Testament to understand
[56:31] this and that's why it's called a
[56:34] mystery to the bachelors only ghost is
[56:36] called a mystery in Colossians chapter 1
[56:38] we'll close with that one a little bit
[56:39] it's called a mystery a lot of people
[56:43] miss that
[56:44] baaz allele was filled with the Spirit
[56:48] of God according to Exodus 31 to Exodus
[56:53] 31 - he was filled with the Spirit of
[56:56] God in all manner of workmanship let's
[56:59] try the verse 3 yeah there it is and I
[57:04] filled him with the Spirit of God
[57:07] can't you imagine bezu leo he said God
[57:10] says I'm filled with the Spirit of God
[57:12] well yeah God says you got to do animal
[57:15] sacrifices you got to get under the law
[57:19] now you got obey the law
[57:21] and he just get the skirt you know as
[57:23] they had to in the law the law can never
[57:25] bring perfection right the law can never
[57:28] give him the baptism holy ghost yeah he
[57:31] could say well God said I'm filled with
[57:33] holy spirit I am in my mind my human
[57:36] spirit is filled with wisdom
[57:38] understanding knowledge all manner of
[57:41] workmanship see so when we start looking
[57:46] at these it's easy to see how people
[57:48] could be confused
[57:49] it took a prophet to finish the mystery
[57:53] of God so we understand all this amen
[57:58] now look even though the Bible says he
[58:01] was filled with God's Spirit Hebrews
[58:05] 10:4 could you pull that sister Hebrews
[58:07] 10:4 says it's impossible for the blood
[58:10] of bulls and goats which he was living
[58:12] under to take away his sins amen look at
[58:17] that church it's impossible yet he's
[58:20] filled with the Spirit of God only here
[58:23] not here why can you imagine that
[58:27] he would say I'm anointed with God's
[58:30] with God's Spirit but yet brother man
[58:32] when he would go to sacrifice the Bible
[58:34] said this and sister Wendy I'm sure you
[58:35] noticed bang-ups you know - the Bible
[58:37] said when they would leave the sacrifice
[58:39] their hearts remain unchanged yeah you
[58:44] could say I'm filled with God's Spirit
[58:45] my my mind is just on fire for things of
[58:48] God
[58:48] but yet when he left the sacrifice Bible
[58:51] said he a still had a conscience for sin
[58:53] he knew that blood could never take away
[58:58] his sins that's why God had to send a
[59:02] perfect lamb right to take away the sin
[59:07] and the guilt amen hallelujah to send it
[59:10] away
[59:11] praise God what's it for all not just
[59:14] for the next year like the day of
[59:15] atonement not just for the next year but
[59:17] for all time all years amen thank the
[59:20] Lord
[59:21] Alleluia Jesus numbers 14 24 Caleb I
[59:26] love this Caleb that Gentile dog
[59:28] hallelujah
[59:29] had another spirit with him which caused
[59:33] him to follow God fully
[59:35] in the days of Joshua so while the rest
[59:38] of the country failed right they
[59:39] couldn't take all the promised land
[59:41] Caleb was one of those he went all the
[59:43] way he possessed all of God's promises
[59:46] amen most them did it but Caleb was he
[59:49] was filled with God's Spirit in his
[59:51] human spirit he had another spirit
[59:54] praise God look at numbers 27 18 27 18
[1:00:04] Joshua had God's Spirit for the Lord
[1:00:07] told Moses take the Joshua the son of
[1:00:09] nun a man in whom this is the spirit and
[1:00:12] lay vine hand upon him praise God
[1:00:16] remember Joshua and Caleb had a
[1:00:18] different spirit Moses said that they
[1:00:20] had different spirits than everybody
[1:00:21] else
[1:00:22] hallelujah Micah let's pull this up
[1:00:28] Micah 3:8 this is beautiful Micah the
[1:00:32] prophet Micah knew Micah knew he had the
[1:00:37] Holy Ghost in his mind look at this but
[1:00:41] truly I am a third I'm full of the power
[1:00:47] by the Spirit of the Lord and yet Jesus
[1:00:51] stands there and said the Holy Ghost not
[1:00:53] yet given to LOM glorified look at that
[1:00:55] see it's a mystery any member tells like
[1:00:59] with water baptism anytime there's a
[1:01:00] contradiction
[1:01:01] it's a mystery behind that amen I'm full
[1:01:06] of the power
[1:01:07] I'm full of judgment I might like he
[1:01:10] said not by might not by power but by my
[1:01:12] spirit there's the spirit of might is
[1:01:13] the holy spirit to declare to Jacob his
[1:01:16] transgression and Israel has sinned let
[1:01:19] me tell you church I mean look at this
[1:01:21] it takes you to be anointed with the
[1:01:23] Holy Spirit to tell somebody their sins
[1:01:25] how many believe that sometimes I have
[1:01:28] trouble brother bank telling people
[1:01:29] their sins other times I don't you know
[1:01:32] why because I got to be anointed with
[1:01:34] the spirit cuz you know you and I know
[1:01:38] we could we don't want to be judgmental
[1:01:40] and prideful pointing out somebody
[1:01:42] else's sins what about ours but see when
[1:01:46] the Holy Spirit's on us what what's
[1:01:48] happened
[1:01:48] this will happen we've already confessed
[1:01:50] our sin and then we can be an honest
[1:01:52] vessel to bring correction to somebody
[1:01:54] else that's beautiful right there Church
[1:01:56] see he had to have the power of the Holy
[1:01:58] Spirit to tell somebody you're in sin
[1:02:00] you're wrong you shouldn't be doing that
[1:02:04] like that middle school girl I think I
[1:02:07] shared last week what a sweet girl she
[1:02:09] was in my class when she was in first
[1:02:10] grade but she walks up ssin she's she's
[1:02:12] almost as tall as me and she's like
[1:02:13] jumping like that she said mr. Smith mr.
[1:02:15] Smith I said yeah honey how you doing
[1:02:17] she said mr. Smith is homosexuality is
[1:02:20] sin
[1:02:20] and I just got done preaching to those
[1:02:23] children and the power this beard and I
[1:02:25] looked at her I could tell she wanted me
[1:02:27] to say yeah it's okay but I looked at
[1:02:30] her I said Sophia no homosexuality is a
[1:02:34] sin it's so wrong God condemns it all
[1:02:37] through the Bible said have your parents
[1:02:39] email me if you have any questions about
[1:02:42] it and I just it's like she melted it's
[1:02:44] like she wilted like a flower at
[1:02:45] nighttime and it broke my heart but I
[1:02:48] was so annoyed too brother bang I wasn't
[1:02:50] gonna compromise see because it takes
[1:02:53] the Holy Spirit to declare to tell them
[1:02:56] that it's wrong that's beautiful right
[1:03:02] there that's beautiful that's Micah 3:8
[1:03:09] now you yeah yeah you remember numbers
[1:03:12] 11 we don't to go there sister but
[1:03:14] numbers 11 25 to 29 God put a portion of
[1:03:17] his spirit that was already on Moses on
[1:03:19] the 70 elders and it caused him to
[1:03:21] prophesy without ceasing I got five
[1:03:24] minutes here so let me finish up here in
[1:03:29] the rest of this chapter I look at three
[1:03:31] Old Testament Saints who proven that the
[1:03:36] spirits anointing was only temporary
[1:03:39] Samson saw and David most of these were
[1:03:42] real very familiar with
[1:03:50] all right why don't when I skip down
[1:03:57] here they got five minutes yeah since I
[1:04:01] got five minutes let's go to John the
[1:04:04] Baptist okay and let's go to Zacharias
[1:04:07] and Elizabeth his parents huh me know
[1:04:13] that they were actually living under the
[1:04:14] Old Testament I know that although their
[1:04:17] names are in the New Testament the New
[1:04:19] Testament didn't start until Jesus said
[1:04:21] those three words what were they it is
[1:04:24] finished once he said those words
[1:04:26] Malachi that was the end of the Old
[1:04:29] Testament the veil was torn and now they
[1:04:32] can get into the holiest of Holies
[1:04:34] praise God amen see although the New
[1:04:37] Testament starts with Matthew 1:1 it
[1:04:40] actually doesn't start until Jesus
[1:04:42] Christ says it is finished remember
[1:04:45] Jesus even said John was the he was
[1:04:49] great right he was one of the greatest
[1:04:51] among men but he's least in the kingdom
[1:04:52] because he's actually not a part of the
[1:04:54] kingdom of God because the kingdom of
[1:04:57] God started in the New Testament it is
[1:04:59] finished and now the blood of Jesus
[1:05:01] Christ
[1:05:01] is shed for our sins Luke 1 let's close
[1:05:04] with Luke 1 and then we'll look at uh
[1:05:06] yeah Luke 1:15 yeah thank you sister for
[1:05:11] he shall be great in the sight of the
[1:05:13] Lord and shall drink neither wine nor
[1:05:16] strong drink and he shall be filled with
[1:05:18] the Holy Ghost even from his mother's
[1:05:19] womb Church I don't mean to be critical
[1:05:21] and I'm not being critical but I've
[1:05:23] heard wonderful highly esteemed message
[1:05:25] believer preachers evangelist use this
[1:05:28] to show that John got the baptism of the
[1:05:30] Holy Ghost in the soul I've heard him
[1:05:32] say that now it's impossible and I just
[1:05:36] say that with all due respect I've put
[1:05:37] my hands like I'm praying you know I
[1:05:39] just say that with all due respect I
[1:05:40] just disagree there's no way he could
[1:05:43] have had the baptism Holy Ghost because
[1:05:44] Jesus wasn't glorified yet the sins
[1:05:47] weren't even paid for by the blood of
[1:05:49] Christ yet what it means is that his
[1:05:52] mind was already anointed with the Holy
[1:05:53] Spirit even a child's mind right even a
[1:05:57] child's mind right the Bible any Bible
[1:05:58] oh you could say it could be his body as
[1:06:00] flesh was anointed to because he starts
[1:06:02] kicking you know
[1:06:03] in the womb
[1:06:06] Luke 141 verse 41
[1:06:10] yeah the babe leaps here yeah the Bible
[1:06:14] said the babe leaped in her womb so the
[1:06:16] Holy Ghost got so much on him that he
[1:06:18] leaped and he started praising Lord I
[1:06:19] that makes me feel good Oh a little
[1:06:21] raise god I like that
[1:06:23] and Elizabeth was fair with the Holy
[1:06:25] Ghost but not the soul see you be
[1:06:29] surprised and that preacher even said
[1:06:31] see it's in the New Testament you know
[1:06:32] well exactly by words in the New
[1:06:35] Testament by the words and the chapter
[1:06:39] but not according to the actual shedding
[1:06:42] of blood because there is no Testament
[1:06:44] until the the death of the testator
[1:06:46] right that's hebrews chapter 10 you
[1:06:49] don't even have a testament until the
[1:06:51] testator has died then the Testament
[1:06:55] starts that's why Jesus said I give up
[1:06:56] the ghost no man takes it from me I give
[1:06:59] it up it's finished and he gave up his
[1:07:00] spirit under the father praise God and
[1:07:04] then Luke 167 says Zacharias and his
[1:07:14] father Zacharias was filled with the
[1:07:17] Holy Ghost and prophesied that's what
[1:07:19] people do today thank God I appreciate
[1:07:21] it you know somebody's have God people
[1:07:23] like I was raised with and thank God
[1:07:25] they prophesy because their spirit gets
[1:07:29] so anointed right but it's not to the
[1:07:33] soul in this case it can't be to the
[1:07:35] soul because Christ had not paid for the
[1:07:37] sins of the world all of our sins were
[1:07:40] not yet put upon him like Isaiah 53 was
[1:07:42] gonna say he was not yet glorified so
[1:07:45] this is the baptism in the human spirit
[1:07:47] this is a mind that's like bezel eels
[1:07:50] it's full of the wisdom of God it's full
[1:07:52] of the prophecy of God but the soul is
[1:07:55] still not sealed all right
[1:07:58] let's say into our feet I better stop
[1:07:59] right there there's a whole lot more I
[1:08:01] got there I hope that was a good start
[1:08:05] like I said I'm so excited about this
[1:08:07] book I was telling brother John Graham
[1:08:09] John grandma I talk once a month on
[1:08:11] Friday nights you know we kind of keep
[1:08:13] up on each other I said I said but one
[1:08:15] thing I can see I'm growing myself and
[1:08:16] I'm
[1:08:17] growing in patience because I'm very
[1:08:19] patient with this book I'm not gonna
[1:08:20] rush it the other one I rushed out I
[1:08:22] really did and when our family and I
[1:08:24] read it we found 16 mistakes like typos
[1:08:26] and things like that
[1:08:27] that man and you'd be surprised numerous
[1:08:30] preachers read that and nobody caught
[1:08:32] all those mistakes it I had four or five
[1:08:35] preachers read that nobody got it even
[1:08:37] the editor I guess we were all in a big
[1:08:40] hurry you know but I know it's helped a
[1:08:42] lot of people and now all those mistakes
[1:08:44] are fixed in the next versions of if
[1:08:46] anybody orders one I can order one for
[1:08:47] you they're all fixed now but see that's
[1:08:50] one thing I've learned just be patient
[1:08:51] do your best work God will be with you
[1:08:54] if God's in it he'll finish the work
[1:08:55] that he started but this is gonna be I
[1:08:58] believe is gonna be so important for so
[1:08:59] many people that they can see if they'll
[1:09:01] just humble themselves and read God's
[1:09:03] Word that's written in the book to
[1:09:05] understand these things because it's a
[1:09:06] mystery Colossians chapter one I'll just
[1:09:08] read that real briefly some of you could
[1:09:10] probably finish it
[1:09:11] hopefully my heart.i leaves Colossians
[1:09:17] 125 this is what I was mentioning
[1:09:20] earlier this morning how people say
[1:09:22] there's the brother the precious pastor
[1:09:24] said there's no church age but that's
[1:09:27] not true there is a church age boy sure
[1:09:33] has take me a long time to find this
[1:09:34] okay here we go
[1:09:35] verse 25 wherefore I made a minister
[1:09:39] according to the dispensation of God
[1:09:40] which is given to me for you to fulfill
[1:09:43] the Word of God a church I told you this
[1:09:46] morning I believe it's Scripture there's
[1:09:47] only one dispensation that's the Gentile
[1:09:49] dispensation that's there's only four
[1:09:52] times the word dispensation is used in
[1:09:53] the Bible it's all by Paul did you know
[1:09:58] what dispensation means by the way I'll
[1:09:59] get to this next week maybe ain't
[1:10:01] stewardship did you know that it doesn't
[1:10:03] even mean time period it means
[1:10:05] stewardship Paul was given a
[1:10:07] dispensation of the gospel a stewardship
[1:10:11] Paul is to be overseer of which part of
[1:10:14] the gospel to the who Gentiles Gentiles
[1:10:17] that doesn't mean a period of time that
[1:10:20] means a stewardship I didn't know that
[1:10:23] so this week that's why it's good to dig
[1:10:25] in the word now people will use this
[1:10:27] position in other ways but the Acts
[1:10:30] to a Greek word is this a stewardship
[1:10:34] and it's the same word where Jesus says
[1:10:36] give an account of your stewardship in
[1:10:38] that parable it's it's a it's an
[1:10:42] overseeing it's a managing and
[1:10:44] overseeing Paul was given a overseeing
[1:10:47] of God for the Gentiles which is given
[1:10:51] to me for you to fulfill the Word of God
[1:10:53] verse 26
[1:10:55] even the Mitch mystery wretch which hath
[1:10:57] been hid from ages and from generations
[1:10:59] but now is made manifest to his Saints
[1:11:03] can you imagine that
[1:11:05] bezel II oh my he could have built Heat
[1:11:08] brother bang he built the ark and he
[1:11:10] overlaid it with gold and then brother
[1:11:12] bang he saw the fire fall but you know
[1:11:14] what sister Wendy after offering the
[1:11:16] sacrifice and guess what he still felt
[1:11:18] like I don't feel forgiven can you
[1:11:21] imagine that he saw God he saw God fill
[1:11:25] the temple so not even Moses and Aaron
[1:11:27] couldn't sacrifice right after he they
[1:11:30] couldn't even enter in the holy place at
[1:11:31] one point I think was after the
[1:11:33] dedication of the of the tabernacle and
[1:11:36] yet later when the blood would be shed
[1:11:38] he would go to church and feel like last
[1:11:40] don't feel like I feel like I'm really
[1:11:43] forgiven because it was impossible for
[1:11:47] the blood of bulls and goats to take
[1:11:48] away sin but it's impossible for the
[1:11:51] blood of Christ not to take away sins
[1:11:53] they ahead to those who believe praise
[1:11:55] God to those who accept the pardoning
[1:11:58] blood of Jesus Christ he has to take
[1:12:00] away sin praise God because he paid for
[1:12:03] them hallelujah thank you Lord and
[1:12:06] there's the way a beautiful word right
[1:12:07] there
[1:12:07] Agis oh there he can't there's no ages
[1:12:11] in the Bible I'll come on man you're too
[1:12:13] late for that too late and then there's
[1:12:15] other scriptures there's numerous ones
[1:12:17] and Asian's two ages and from
[1:12:20] generations I'll see you ages longer
[1:12:22] right a generation is shorter it's like
[1:12:24] my generation might and then Malachi is
[1:12:26] the next generation right now Lydia next
[1:12:28] generation James and Lily the next
[1:12:30] generation we have our generation but
[1:12:33] age is longer and ages longer time
[1:12:35] period but now is made manifest to his
[1:12:38] Saints verse 27 to whom god would make
[1:12:42] know what is the riches of the glory of
[1:12:43] this
[1:12:43] mystery among the gentiles which is
[1:12:45] christ in you the hope of glory not
[1:12:48] goodness
[1:12:49] whom we preach warning every man and
[1:12:51] teaching every man at all wisdom that we
[1:12:53] may present every man perfect to Christ
[1:12:54] so the Jews would leave after every
[1:12:56] service same I know that was great
[1:12:59] I felt anointing I don't feel forgiven
[1:13:01] and the Bible said it was a teacher it
[1:13:04] was to teach them a schoolmaster to
[1:13:06] point them to Christ and now we because
[1:13:10] they turned down Christ we get to go to
[1:13:12] church and we can actually feel forgiven
[1:13:13] hey man thank you Lord because it's
[1:13:17] possible for the blood of Christ to take
[1:13:19] away our sins let's just close with that
[1:13:21] let's bow our heads here how many are
[1:13:27] thankful for the possibility of Christ
[1:13:29] taking away all sin I'm something I'm
[1:13:32] more thankful for that than anything I
[1:13:34] know and then new you Jesus Lord we
[1:13:39] covered a lot of ground to know our soul
[1:13:48] we see how Jesus you are the will be
[1:14:26] filled with the Holy Spirit in our souls
[1:14:28] and our it was but now it's the Bible
