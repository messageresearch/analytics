[24:12] the lyrics are a little bit unusual but
[24:14] what it's about is that how God uses our
[24:16] trials and tests to mold our character
[24:18] into the character that he wants
[24:24] [Music]
[24:30] from the fields of thunder comes a
[24:35] lovely drop from the refiners fire a
[24:41] soul that's tried and true and from a
[24:45] heart that's broken on the mighty Rock

[25:06] righteous man place upon the fire where
[25:13] character is forged the gift of God
[25:18] salvation is shaped by victory
[25:23] and the furnace of temptation Christ
[25:28] warms his bride from the refiners fire a
[25:45] small that's tried-and-true oh great
[26:07] over infinite in wisdom and in strength
[26:13] we place our lives before you as
[26:18] [Music]
[26:22] material to build the house
[26:27] [Music]
[26:38] [Applause]
[26:49] [Music]
[27:06] [Music]
[27:25] [Music]
[27:42] amen
[27:44] just have a few announcements here by
[27:46] the grace of the Lord banks not here yet
[27:49] but I was gonna do the officer
[27:51] Appreciation this morning so maybe if I
[27:54] still a little bit he'll walk in here in
[27:56] just a moment so I just want to have a
[27:57] few announcements here by God's grace
[27:59] the first one is brother Adam was voted
[28:03] in as a deacon so I asked him to sit
[28:04] back there by the back door and just
[28:07] remember you know he's here to help he's
[28:09] gonna do it with grace and and
[28:11] everything like that I've asked him
[28:14] specifically to just be mindful to try
[28:18] to open the doors for mothers who are
[28:19] trying to get their children out that
[28:21] are crying and then also like you know
[28:23] some my children and just children
[28:24] sometimes they they get away from their
[28:27] parents and in the past some I've had to
[28:31] catch some of my own children may be
[28:32] talking out in the bathroom or spending
[28:34] too much time talking by the water
[28:35] fountains so these are little small
[28:37] little concerns you know our church is
[28:40] very well behaved but just as a deacon
[28:42] that's one thing up to watch just to
[28:44] keep everybody focused and focused on
[28:45] the worship and he is God's bodyguard
[28:50] for the preaching of the gospel a deacon
[28:52] is a policeman to protect the pulpit so
[28:55] I want him to look at every person that
[28:57] walks in that door I want him you know
[28:58] if he hears the door open and wondering
[29:00] who it is I want him to walk out there
[29:01] and see who's out there because we know
[29:03] there's a lot of church shootings and
[29:04] things like that we don't live in fear
[29:06] but brother Branham said that Pastor
[29:09] that got that Baptist pastor the God
[29:10] shot he said that wouldn't happen if
[29:12] there was deacons at the door
[29:14] protecting the preaching of the word he
[29:16] protects the atmosphere of the holy
[29:18] spirit brother Branham said any person
[29:20] that would get upset with a Gauley
[29:21] Deacon trying to correct person he said
[29:24] they have the wrong spirit or the RAM
[29:26] said the most strict office in the house
[29:28] of God is a deacon so I was the only
[29:33] deacon here for last six months but it's
[29:34] nice to have help here but Adam will be
[29:36] a great help to me and I when I'm
[29:37] sitting there on Wednesday night Sunday
[29:39] morning Sunday night whenever we have
[29:41] service as you notice we have a couple
[29:44] of Saturday night services coming up in
[29:47] February brother Joe Adams will be
[29:49] preaching on a Saturday night because he
[29:51] has to fly out Sunday afternoon and then
[29:53] also have to look on my schedule there I
[29:56] can't remember who else Oh Troy Troy
[29:58] sueda suede II from Iowa he'll be
[30:02] preaching on a Saturday night in April
[30:04] if I'm not mistaken April so got a lot
[30:07] of guest ministers lined up recently so
[30:08] I hope you're excited about that I
[30:10] certainly am by the grace of the Lord so
[30:12] let's just let's - thank the Lord for
[30:14] brother Adams service to the Lord thank
[30:15] you about Adam just a reminder you know
[30:19] on be you know just watch where you're
[30:21] sitting you know we want to let the
[30:22] women and children sit in the last three
[30:25] rows but like I said if some families
[30:27] are out then yeah you can sit wherever
[30:29] you want
[30:29] we don't have to worry about that on
[30:30] Sunday morning by God's grace also the
[30:34] second noun sment if you have food for
[30:35] sister Naomi like I'm sorry an already
[30:37] announced set let me know you can give
[30:38] it to me or I can text you her address
[30:40] and I'm sure she'd really appreciate
[30:42] some help there by the grace of the Lord
[30:44] that's nice she has Beatrice with her
[30:47] though thank God for that I was gonna
[30:49] thank brother van for his service in
[30:51] 2017 out the wait till he gets here the
[30:55] last announcement everybody has manila
[30:57] envelope out there on the counter or the
[31:01] prayer request table inside you have a
[31:04] copy of your final Giving statement from
[31:08] our records as treasurer and then I put
[31:11] a copy of the email I sent out last
[31:13] night so I have I'm just lookin always
[31:16] looking for feedback so if anyone has
[31:18] any suggestions for bang myself or
[31:20] brother Adam please come to us let us
[31:22] know also if you have any questions
[31:25] about anything that's been preached
[31:27] please come let me know about that as
[31:28] well and then if you desire meeting with
[31:31] me I'm happy to meet with anybody by
[31:32] God's grace and the last thing was just
[31:34] an invitation to prayer I'm gonna talk
[31:37] about it more on the sermon here but as
[31:38] we've seen God move in Iowa North
[31:41] Carolina
[31:41] I really believe God is calling us to
[31:43] more dedicated lives I really I really
[31:45] believe that I don't believe that well
[31:47] that's just the pastor's opinion I
[31:49] believe that's thus saith the Lord I
[31:51] believe the Holy Spirit has given me
[31:54] such a witness that what we're preaching
[31:57] here is the right gospel and we need to
[32:00] be more dedicated that's kinda what this
[32:03] morning's message to beyond his
[32:04] discipline we must be more disciplined
[32:07] to God so I believe that's it I was sure
[32:12] hope and bang would walk in there I know
[32:13] he teaches Sunday School but I was
[32:15] hoping to honor and thank him for his
[32:18] labor of love okay well let's just sing

[39:09] part 8 of the worship series to Sunday
[39:11] nights ago we preached part 7 the altar
[39:13] of incense but I'm gonna go get back to
[39:15] that Lord willing in the next few weeks
[39:17] and months if God's willing by God's
[39:19] grace numbers 19 verse 14 bang here yet
[39:24] okay no all right this would be a good
[39:27] time to recognize him because we're kind
[39:29] of in the transition here
[39:36] numbers 1914 I like to preach on part 8
[39:39] of the worship and let's call our tents
[39:41] so we preaching about the homes that we
[39:44] live in and the atmosphere we're
[39:45] creating in our homes and I'm preaching
[39:48] this based upon the move of God I saw in
[39:50] Iowa in North Carolina just a tremendous
[39:54] move of God for repentance so I want to
[39:58] look a little deeper this two Sundays
[40:00] ago I preached on the red heifer to the
[40:03] holiest of holies I preached that same
[40:05] message in Iowa I preached at our church
[40:07] the following Sunday and I preached at
[40:08] last Sunday morning in North Carolina
[40:10] and just saw some tremendous effects to
[40:12] that message so I know that wasn't my
[40:14] thoughts it was God thoughts so we're
[40:16] thankful for God's thoughts numbers 1914
[40:20] this is the law when a man dies in a
[40:23] tent all that come into the tent and all
[40:28] that is in the tent shall be unclean
[40:30] seven days notice when there's death in
[40:34] the tent everything's affected the whole
[40:36] life the whole management of the home
[40:38] the whole routine of the home everything
[40:40] is affected in the home when something
[40:42] dies in the home and every open vessel
[40:46] and I'm liking this unto open minds as
[40:48] our children have open minds our spouses
[40:51] we all have open minds we're all open to
[40:54] receiving influence every open vessel
[40:57] which hath no covering bound upon it is
[40:59] unclean and whosoever touches one that
[41:03] is slain with the sword and the open
[41:04] fields or dead body or a bone of a man
[41:07] or a grave she'll be unclean seven days
[41:08] and for an unclean person they shall
[41:11] take of the ashes of the burn half for a
[41:13] purification for sin and running water
[41:15] shall be put there two in a vessel and a
[41:20] person I'm sorry in a clean person so
[41:23] see the preacher has to be living a
[41:24] clean life as well a preacher living in
[41:28] sin cannot help cleanse a family or
[41:31] individual that's not living right
[41:32] before God it has to be someone who's
[41:34] walking in the anointing of the Holy
[41:36] Spirit and a clean person shall take
[41:39] hyssop and dip it in the water and
[41:41] sprinkle it upon the tent and upon the
[41:45] vessels and upon the persons that were
[41:46] there
[41:47] and upon that touched a bone or swine
[41:50] slain or one dead or grave let's just
[41:53] bow our heads in that word of Prayer if
[41:55] you ever need on your heart just make it
[41:56] known unto God somehow God sees every
[41:58] desire father in heaven we love you Lord

[42:59] things that would please you for Lord
[43:01] you ordained the foolishness of
[43:03] preaching to save them that would
[43:05] believe the world causes foolish but

[44:46] our labor in love so thank you sir so I
[44:50] want to just pull up you know the recent
[44:52] leadership of the Holy Spirit the last
[44:56] month has just been it's been
[45:01] astonishing to me I'm trying to think of
[45:03] the right word just to see the move of
[45:05] the Holy Spirit in Iowa and North
[45:09] Carolina and I'm just so grateful and I
[45:11] just want to just I'll be sharing
[45:13] probably some of these things throughout
[45:16] this message but like I told you I don't
[45:21] wanna get you in maybe I needing a
[45:22] chance to tell you but in Iowa we preach
[45:24] a Saturday night in Iowa City which is a
[45:25] Congolese church and I preached on this
[45:29] redheffer thought and the 12 tables
[45:32] there's 12 loaves of shewbread and we
[45:34] just had probably you know 10 15 people
[45:36] come up for prayer three of the brothers
[45:38] I believe went up to brother Brooks the
[45:39] next week and said they received the
[45:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[45:42] as we pray we praying and saying for an
[45:44] hour I was jumping shout and praising
[45:45] the Lord at the end of the message it
[45:47] was a really tremendous atmosphere
[45:48] lots of people repenting of not paying
[45:50] ties Hollywood in their lives all kinds
[45:55] of things and I just got to the point
[45:56] where I said you have to tell me you
[45:57] know doctor tell me the next morning I
[46:00] preached an IO and Des Moines that the
[46:02] church that brother Brooks started
[46:03] and saw the same results we had a
[46:06] three-and-a-half-hour service we started
[46:08] at 9:30 I don't think we are there till
[46:10] one o'clock and everybody stayed there
[46:12] everybody sat there and I just preached
[46:14] the same thing I preached you there from
[46:15] the red heifer to the holiest of Holies
[46:17] and this is where we had marriages you
[46:19] know we had couples come up weeping
[46:20] confessing pornography and and inability
[46:23] to love their spouse and all kinds of
[46:26] problems and I was even counseling one
[46:28] of them yesterday on the phone you know
[46:29] count still could do in some marriage
[46:31] counseling you know by the permission of
[46:32] brother Brooks and so forth like that
[46:34] and and it was just a tremendous move of
[46:39] the Holy Spirit and then last week was
[46:42] II I hate to say it was just so powerful
[46:46] I have a hard time describing it but all
[46:50] my children saw it which I was just
[46:51] thanking the Lord afterwards that they
[46:52] could see the same word that I preached
[46:54] in Akron is the same word I preached
[46:56] everywhere it's God's Word it's the
[46:58] message of the hour and brother Tim
[47:02] Humes you know many of you know him a
[47:04] wonderful man of God his mother was
[47:06] healed of tuberculosis in 1954 in
[47:09] brother Graham's meetings it's on tape
[47:11] you can listen to it I shook her hand in
[47:13] 2010 when I was there preaching and she
[47:15] said you preached just what brother
[47:16] Branham preached and I said thank you
[47:18] that's one of the best compliments I
[47:19] could have because I stay with the
[47:21] prophets message by the grace of the
[47:23] Lord
[47:24] but anyways brother Tim Humes after the
[47:26] morning service I preached the same
[47:27] thought I start there was four people
[47:30] that came up for prayer started praying
[47:31] for the first one and mother Tim whisper
[47:33] and said I need to change the order the
[47:34] service and I got nervous I thought what
[47:36] did I miss the moving of the Holy Ghost
[47:37] or what it's a church of 300 and I said
[47:41] yes sir brother Tim whatever you feel
[47:42] led to do
[47:42] he's been the Africa over 20 times South
[47:46] America 20 times this is a man who does
[47:48] a work of apostle he's an apostle as
[47:51] well as a pastor and you can have
[47:52] multiple gifts we know that's in the
[47:53] scripture and he said I'm stopping this
[47:56] prayer line and I'm calling the entire
[47:58] church up for repentance and the whole
[48:01] church came up to the altar and he he
[48:05] started praying and the prayers got
[48:06] louder and louder and louder we prayed
[48:08] maybe 20 minutes maybe 15 minutes and he
[48:12] was confessing he was repenting of his
[48:15] failures he was asking the church to
[48:17] confess all their failures he got down
[48:21] on his knees weeping and crying asking
[48:23] God to bring revival to the church and
[48:25] now listen Church they've had three
[48:27] cancer healings in the last year and he
[48:28] said the church was still back slid so
[48:31] even miracles don't prove we're on fire
[48:34] that just proves the Holy Spirit was
[48:35] present but he was crying out for people
[48:39] to put God first in their homes and
[48:41] that's all I preached was just sin that
[48:42] enters into people's home compromises
[48:44] the same thing I preached at our church
[48:46] I didn't preach anything different over
[48:47] there and he's on his knees weeping and
[48:51] crying crying out to God it got so
[48:53] powerful he was cursing the demons of
[48:55] television he was cursing the demons of
[48:58] the Internet you know it's evil spirits
[48:59] to get on people you know when they
[49:01] watch the wrong thing he was cursing you
[49:05] know sickness he was cursing anything
[49:07] that would be in your home in the name
[49:09] of Jesus Christ and was so powerful
[49:10] people men were shouting and screaming
[49:12] and there was all kinds of worship it
[49:15] was just tremendous and then when we
[49:18] really I knew really knew it was God was
[49:19] when a young sister was throwing herself
[49:21] around and when it was the devil she was
[49:23] throwing herself around hitting people
[49:25] she hit him 95 year-old brother from
[49:28] brother Donnie Reagan's church she hit
[49:30] him and he got kind of an upset you know
[49:32] and so she she came up and took the
[49:35] microphone tried to take the microphone
[49:37] out of Timmy Hughes hand and Tim Humes
[49:39] you know he has enough experience to
[49:40] know that the Holy Ghost is a gentleman
[49:42] she was out of order and she was trying
[49:45] to say something good she was trying to
[49:47] say brother Tim I have a word from the
[49:48] Lord I had a dream last night she's
[49:50] trying to be prophetic had all this
[49:51] emotion and zeal but he said you're out
[49:54] of order and it broke the atmosphere but
[49:57] afterwards you know we still prayed and
[49:58] rejoice for a while but the fact was God
[50:01] was so in this preaching this message
[50:03] that I've been preaching God was so in
[50:05] this message that Satan anointed someone
[50:08] who was sincere but got them sincerely
[50:11] wrong and missed the order the order
[50:14] should have been if she had a dream or a
[50:15] prophetic word she should have brought
[50:17] that to the pastor before the service it
[50:20] doesn't erupt the angel of God who
[50:22] stands behind the pulpit you don't
[50:24] interrupt the spirits are subject to the
[50:25] prophets right Spears to the prophets or
[50:28] subject the prophets
[50:29] and as we talk later she had a dream she
[50:32] had a burden for the young people she
[50:34] was concerned about one of her friends
[50:35] and that she just let the devil she said
[50:37] when I win if he called everybody up for
[50:39] prayer
[50:39] she said she blacked out and that's when
[50:41] the devil came upon her the devil jumped
[50:44] on her I mean she was throwing herself
[50:45] and we're all praying it and she's got
[50:47] up there and tried to take the mic out
[50:49] of his hand and and so I saw it and they
[50:53] were kind of tussling that's why I
[50:54] turned around and saw so I went up there
[50:55] and I started rebuking the demon in
[50:57] Jesus name then she fell down and and
[50:59] after the service we brought in the back
[51:01] and brother Tim explained that's wrong
[51:02] you're out of order no matter how
[51:04] sincere you are like David no matter how
[51:06] sincere you are with the Ark it's got to
[51:07] come God's provided way and she admitted
[51:09] that she humbled herself and apologized
[51:12] for that and I just saw that as a sign
[51:14] that God Satan was trying to stop God
[51:16] moving back into people's homes and then
[51:21] that was just really powerful and I had
[51:22] people come up and say that he said that
[51:24] was probably the one of the best
[51:25] services in 30 years of having a church
[51:27] is they started the church in 1988 now
[51:30] that's that's humbling to me to know
[51:32] that I'm just I'm just little old pastor
[51:34] but that God would use the word it was
[51:37] the word because man can do nothing one
[51:41] man plants one man waters it's God that
[51:43] gives the increase his wife said that
[51:45] was nothing but God from beginning to
[51:47] end it was thus saith the Lord just what
[51:48] the church needs for revival to clean
[51:50] out the homes and then even for our
[51:53] midweek services I had a minister call
[51:54] me up and tell me well actually I called
[51:57] him I was asking him a question and he
[52:00] said my daughter was live streaming your
[52:02] Wednesday night service when I was
[52:03] preaching on the open door with Charles
[52:05] Spurgeon and William Carey you remember
[52:06] that brother hadn't when we were
[52:07] preaching on that a few Wednesday nights
[52:07] ago I don't know who streamed that but
[52:09] we were preaching on that and afterwards
[52:11] I was just saying how we got to be more
[52:13] devoted and dedicated filled with the
[52:14] Holy Ghost and even in that little
[52:16] service there we have maybe four or five
[52:18] people here the minister told me his
[52:21] daughter I think she's 19 or eight
[52:23] twenty maybe maybe eighteen she was just
[52:26] weeping on her knees after we were done
[52:27] preaching as we're praised and I see
[52:29] here it looks like so quiet and you know
[52:32] we're just there's the small little
[52:33] church but the Holy Ghost wants to speak
[52:36] to all of us and so she's in her home
[52:39] miles away many miles away on her knees
[52:42] weeping and
[52:43] dad can you pray with me so I'll be
[52:44] born-again the Holy Ghost this word has
[52:46] power we just have to open our heart to
[52:49] this word all of us I myself all of us
[52:53] and so now the brother Minister tells me
[52:55] his daughter's seeking the Holy Ghost
[52:57] like never before
[52:59] so church I believe with all my heart
[53:01] we're following the leadership of the
[53:03] Holy Ghost in these sermons that are
[53:05] coming forth it is not is not an idea of
[53:08] a man it's the Word of God and so this
[53:11] morning when I look at cleaning out our
[53:12] tents by the grace of the Lord now you
[53:15] know the scripture is clear the tent is
[53:18] a type of the home we know that and the
[53:23] tent is also the type of the individual
[53:25] because Paul said you are the temples of
[53:27] living God and we know these are types
[53:32] here so you know here's that picture the
[53:34] famous picture that it's under copyright
[53:37] so I don't know all the details but you
[53:40] can buy a copy from Happy Valley I know
[53:41] that so you know we have all these tents
[53:44] outside and each one of those tents you
[53:46] know represents our homes you know and
[53:49] of course we're not all gathered
[53:50] together or in a closed matter we all
[53:52] don't live in Akron but we all have a
[53:54] tent that's rally around the message of
[53:57] the hour how many understand what I'm
[53:58] talking about we're all this is the
[54:01] message of ours this is the holy ghost
[54:02] word and in the holiest of holies that's
[54:04] the prends of Jesus Christ
[54:06] that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[54:07] all God's people are camped around the
[54:11] message of the hour does that make sense
[54:14] all right and so I want to just look at
[54:18] four examples from the scripture as I
[54:21] was preparing yesterday and I guess all
[54:23] week I had two days off this week that
[54:25] was great at Thursday and Friday often
[54:26] had more time with the family and more
[54:28] time in the presence of the Lord I just
[54:30] love being a teacher I just think there
[54:31] are so many nice benefits to being a
[54:32] teacher the first one is death in the
[54:36] tent which we covered and this was
[54:39] numbers 19 any dead thing in a house
[54:43] perverts the house and yeah I think
[54:45] that's good maybe open up the window I
[54:47] know it's real real hot in here and does
[54:49] that open okay can you feel coming in
[54:51] thank you appreciate that I know we have
[54:54] trouble with heating we have trouble
[54:56] with cooling
[54:56] I don't know why and it's only this room
[54:58] the other room worked fine it's only
[55:00] this room and I'd asked Beverly about it
[55:02] and she doesn't know and you have to pay
[55:04] somebody to climb up there or something
[55:05] I don't know sorry about that we just
[55:07] try to keep as comfortable as we are or
[55:10] as we can but Church we know our lives
[55:12] are much more comfortable than lives
[55:14] just fifty years ago so we don't have
[55:16] anything to complain about you know we
[55:17] have to be thankful we have so much to
[55:19] be thankful for and so as I like I said
[55:23] as I was at death in the tent you know
[55:28] as I was at ministering about the last
[55:30] few weeks you know the unclean tent from
[55:34] the scripture it cuts you off from the
[55:36] congregation which means you cannot
[55:39] enter into the worship of God you'll be
[55:43] around it but you'll never really enter
[55:46] and you never feel it okay so you won't
[55:51] feel forgiven because forgiveness takes
[55:53] place when the sacrifices is killed
[55:56] because you you put your hand on the
[55:58] head of the sacrifice and the sin of the
[56:01] sinner is transferred to the sacrifice
[56:03] so you net you really can't be forgiven
[56:05] if you've got sin in your life and you
[56:08] won't confess it in your home you can't
[56:10] feel forgiven you can brush it off and
[56:13] you can try to you know let something of
[56:15] the world satisfy you for a little while
[56:17] whether it's friendships or whether it's
[56:19] chocolate or whether it's coffee like I
[56:21] like coffee or whether it's uh you know
[56:23] events traveling vacations you can try
[56:26] to hush that voice of the Holy Spirit
[56:28] that feeling that you need to repent but
[56:30] it will never go away
[56:31] if you're a real child of God if you're
[56:35] not you can sear that and then that's
[56:37] when you cross the line between mercy
[56:39] and judgment remember Simon preach that
[56:41] message Cain went to the east side of
[56:43] the garden Cain Judas Loretta there on
[56:47] the east side so which is the ministers
[56:50] errands and Moses tensed over here so
[56:53] the serpent seed were trying to
[56:55] impersonate the true seed of God and
[56:58] they still lived a religious life but
[57:01] they never really entered in and I have
[57:02] a quote from the church age where
[57:04] brother Bram said Judas just faked
[57:06] justification
[57:08] he just faked it because the Bible says
[57:10] when you're justified you're already
[57:11] glorified that means you already have a
[57:13] glorified heavenly eternal body in
[57:15] heaven so someone that has sin in their
[57:21] house or their life they don't feel
[57:23] forgiven they don't feel right with God
[57:25] next if that's the case then they don't
[57:32] see the light they don't they can't
[57:33] appreciate the light of the seven church
[57:35] ages because that's the first thing you
[57:38] see when you walk in is the candlestick
[57:40] they'll never see the real shining light
[57:42] oh this is what a Christian in Laodicea
[57:44] needs to live like they'll never be the
[57:46] city on the hill they'll never be
[57:48] shining the light of Christ like they
[57:50] ought to because they're cut off they've
[57:54] got sin and they've got some sin in
[57:55] their tent and they're not allowed
[57:58] they're cut off from enjoying the light
[58:01] of their church age amen and then they
[58:06] don't enjoy the bread and this is where
[58:08] we see today like I was saying a couple
[58:09] weeks ago the bread the twelve loaves
[58:11] are the twelve New Testament mysteries
[58:13] that brother Branham gives us in cercis
[58:15] is the endtime there's twelve mysteries
[58:18] the Bible calls New Testament mysteries
[58:20] and people will they'll physically come
[58:22] to church but they won't even enjoy the
[58:24] preaching of the bread and they won't
[58:26] even joy the bread because they're cut
[58:27] off spiritually they don't even joy
[58:30] preaching anymore you can preach any
[58:32] mystery you want they're still not going
[58:33] to enjoy it because they're cut off
[58:36] spiritually they've grieve the Holy
[58:38] Spirit and in all spiritual and all
[58:40] spiritual application they don't feel
[58:42] forgiven they don't they're not shutting
[58:44] the light they don't experience the
[58:45] light of the church age then they're not
[58:47] feasting on the bread and then their
[58:48] prayer life is hindered which is the
[58:50] most important step to getting into
[58:52] God's presence because the last thing is
[58:57] cut off from God's fellowship and I have
[59:01] quotes and I could I could preach to you
[59:03] all day
[59:03] I have quotes but from the basis of
[59:06] fellowship 1961 brother Branham said
[59:08] when you get sprinkled out here he said
[59:10] you get you get divine healing
[59:12] he said sprinkling out here you get
[59:14] forgiven you can be forgiven and isn't
[59:17] that true you can have a sit brother BAM
[59:18] said he saw prostitutes he prayed for
[59:20] prostitutes and they would repent of
[59:22] their sin so much
[59:22] they got healed in his prayer line and
[59:24] then he saw said he would see real
[59:26] dedicated Christians with not enough
[59:27] faith to receive their healing it's I
[59:30] mean it's true
[59:31] like number like Matthew 7 Lord we've
[59:34] done many marvelous works it we've done
[59:36] many wonderful works in your name we've
[59:38] cast out devils we prophesied see they
[59:40] got clean for a little while they got
[59:42] sprinkled with the anointing but they
[59:44] never entered into a real worship
[59:47] because they were workers of iniquity
[59:48] which means they never really repented
[59:50] of their sins they were repent for a
[59:53] little bit they get sprinkled for a
[59:54] little bit but after that after that
[59:56] explosive move of God by the Holy Spirit
[59:58] they would go back to being workers of
[1:00:00] iniquity see they weren't every day Holy
[1:00:02] Ghost field Christian that's what we
[1:00:04] need today every day Holy Ghost field
[1:00:06] Saints Amen that keep the Word of God
[1:00:09] without compromise leave that with all
[1:00:14] of my heart and brother Tim miners came
[1:00:18] up afterwards they were weeping at the
[1:00:19] altar - he said brother that was such a
[1:00:20] deep message now to me I didn't think it
[1:00:21] was that deep but maybe it is maybe it
[1:00:26] is this message this all types our Holy
[1:00:29] Ghost experience with Christ how many
[1:00:31] understand that it types it perfectly
[1:00:34] and this is why people can come to
[1:00:36] church their prayers their not their
[1:00:38] prayers that feel like they're not even
[1:00:39] going past the ceiling tile because why
[1:00:43] they've got death in the tent
[1:00:45] they've got unconfessed sin they feel
[1:00:47] unclean well then you are unclean even
[1:00:51] if you're getting condemned by a guilty
[1:00:52] spirit you've got to cast that down
[1:00:54] you've got to feel forgiven how do you
[1:00:58] do that you've got to cast that down and
[1:01:00] you got to enter into the gates with
[1:01:01] Thanksgiving in your heart you've got to
[1:01:04] go through the steps you've got to thank
[1:01:05] God brother Bram said I never got out
[1:01:06] for my knees without thanking God for
[1:01:08] Jesus's death on Calvary so that's why
[1:01:12] we have to come in here we should be
[1:01:13] happy about the blood we should be happy
[1:01:15] about Jesus dying for our sins we'd be
[1:01:17] lost without the blood we need a fresh
[1:01:20] experience we all need it I'm part of it
[1:01:22] we all need a fresh experience of
[1:01:24] feeling like we're forgiven if we don't
[1:01:27] have that it's going to be very hard to
[1:01:29] get into the holy place where we can
[1:01:32] experience the light of our church age
[1:01:33] where we can be hot for Jesus
[1:01:36] and experience that light where your
[1:01:39] wick your wick is dipped half of it's
[1:01:41] dipped in the the baptism of the Holy
[1:01:43] Ghost and the other half is outside the
[1:01:45] Holy Ghost
[1:01:46] that's your flesh where people see you
[1:01:48] on fire for Jesus amen
[1:01:49] Laurie half of a part of my life is hid
[1:01:53] in Christ part of my life is visible for
[1:01:55] the world to see I love that I want to
[1:01:57] be a wick that's on fire for Jesus and
[1:02:01] so you know this is why and I hate to
[1:02:04] move from this slide I just hate to do
[1:02:06] this but maybe I'll come back but this
[1:02:08] is why the last few weeks when I went to
[1:02:11] Iowa and North Carolina I just preached
[1:02:15] on simple things I preached on Netflix
[1:02:18] cuz that woman out in Minnesota a couple
[1:02:20] years ago at the Labor Day meetings
[1:02:23] altar weeping and crying she said I've
[1:02:25] been ignoring my children at home while
[1:02:26] my husband's at work and I go hide
[1:02:28] myself in the laundry room and I watch
[1:02:30] Netflix seasons of evil shows and
[1:02:35] brother Tim was cursing Netflix do you
[1:02:40] understand what I'm saying now see these
[1:02:41] things are all the same internet
[1:02:42] smartphone they all have evil on them
[1:02:45] they're all a tree of knowledge of good
[1:02:47] and evil a TV cable my smartphone these
[1:02:51] are all trees of knowledge of good and
[1:02:54] evil what matters is how you control it
[1:02:57] are you controlling it or is it
[1:03:00] controlling you so this woman wasn't
[1:03:04] control it was controlling her the
[1:03:06] happiest part of her day was not
[1:03:08] ministering to her children trying to
[1:03:09] get them saved but it was sneaking off
[1:03:12] and watching some evil - TV shows so I'm
[1:03:17] trying to bring a balance of this you
[1:03:18] know movies you know it's preaching on
[1:03:21] Star Wars like I did a few weeks I've
[1:03:22] really hard and that's the good and I
[1:03:24] guess there was many young people there
[1:03:26] that some people knew we're into Star
[1:03:27] Wars I know it's the God you know I know
[1:03:30] it's God trying to help us to see the
[1:03:32] real Star Wars
[1:03:33] praise God which is the Bride of Christ
[1:03:35] the stars of God amen
[1:03:37] that's the real war that we're in and
[1:03:39] then I had like I said numerous people
[1:03:41] confessing the robbing god of tithes and
[1:03:43] offerings not having enough faith
[1:03:45] because the Bible said when you don't
[1:03:46] pay tithes and offerings you lack fear
[1:03:49] for
[1:03:49] God you fear the bank more than you fear
[1:03:52] God and God gave you a hundred percent
[1:03:54] Aussie asses for 11% back right or can I
[1:03:58] say ten point one you have to have
[1:04:00] offerings too
[1:04:02] you have to have offerings if not you're
[1:04:04] robbing god of an offering and it shows
[1:04:06] your freewill offering your heart is not
[1:04:08] in the right place you're just paying
[1:04:09] ties because you got to cuz you know
[1:04:12] God's gonna get you if you don't but
[1:04:15] when God put up the tabernacle with
[1:04:17] Moses and David the first issue was find
[1:04:19] somebody who's got a willing heart to
[1:04:21] bring an offering that's what actually
[1:04:23] established the first Tabernacles was
[1:04:25] willing hearts offerings set up the
[1:04:28] first Tabernacles of God amen
[1:04:30] offering wasn't tithes it was offerings
[1:04:34] see because offerings come from the
[1:04:36] heart and you can honor God with your
[1:04:40] lips or I love the message I believe
[1:04:42] brother Branham I believe Jesus and your
[1:04:44] heart can be so far from God the
[1:04:47] willingness for you to give of yourself
[1:04:49] and I'm just not talking about just
[1:04:50] money yes you should give offerings and
[1:04:52] money you should get offerings to the
[1:04:53] poor people and it's you shouldn't take
[1:04:56] away your ties to do that brother
[1:04:57] Branham said then you're robbing God
[1:04:59] there and you should be concerned about
[1:05:02] the poor you should be concerned about
[1:05:04] you should be doing these things in
[1:05:05] secret there's so many times Church I
[1:05:08] just have a holy zeal I hope you can
[1:05:10] understand this I see people the church
[1:05:13] is on Facebook they have all these have
[1:05:15] you seen them like like they do food
[1:05:17] preparations and they say they put all
[1:05:18] these food packages together and they
[1:05:20] send them overseas to people and I think
[1:05:22] it's so nice but the thing is they're
[1:05:24] just they're just broadcasting and Jesus
[1:05:26] said when you do that you have your
[1:05:28] reward there's no reward in heaven like
[1:05:31] they put on these hair masks you what
[1:05:33] are those hair masks all the kitchen
[1:05:34] cafeteria women put them on I forget you
[1:05:37] know they have those hair mask so hair
[1:05:39] don't fall into the food
[1:05:40] they'll make twenty thousand meals I saw
[1:05:42] in one Facebook post these megachurches
[1:05:44] right around here
[1:05:45] and they'll broadcast it look what we're
[1:05:47] doing for Jesus look what we're doing
[1:05:48] for Jesus but Jesus said don't let your
[1:05:51] right hand know what your left hand is
[1:05:52] doing sometimes I get such a whole easy
[1:05:55] like I want our church to do something
[1:05:56] like that but we don't want it to bring
[1:05:59] glory to ourselves we want Christ to get
[1:06:00] glory so I feel like
[1:06:02] I just got to keep reminding the church
[1:06:04] if you are not giving to people that are
[1:06:07] poor than you praying God will show you
[1:06:09] to give it to somebody that's real
[1:06:13] Christianity what is pure religion pure
[1:06:16] religion and undefiled before God is
[1:06:18] visiting the widows and fatherless in
[1:06:21] their affliction and keeping yourself
[1:06:24] unspotted from Laodicea Lori that's pure
[1:06:28] religion finding somebody that's got it
[1:06:30] worse off than you and helping them and
[1:06:32] not asking for anything in return well
[1:06:35] brother Jeff's only have two mics left
[1:06:36] well there's a woman with two mites that
[1:06:38] gave it all to Jesus one time you
[1:06:41] understand its gateway and but see if we
[1:06:44] don't for not praying if we're not in
[1:06:46] the channel of prayer we won't we won't
[1:06:48] feel God's heart for people that are
[1:06:50] less fortunate than we are and then I
[1:06:53] preach really hard on church attendance
[1:06:54] the Bible says we must gather more as we
[1:06:56] see that Day approaching I don't know
[1:06:58] how you're doing it but I know how I'm
[1:06:59] doing it I'm having Sunday night
[1:07:01] services to gather more if the Bible
[1:07:03] said you literally so much more gather
[1:07:05] together with the Saints as you see that
[1:07:08] Day approaching that's my way to do that
[1:07:10] and like I said carry ends I forgot
[1:07:12] those who that the last few months but
[1:07:14] bro Graham said you will never be as
[1:07:16] good of a Christian by not hearing the
[1:07:18] Word of God than if you came to the
[1:07:19] house of God don't we all want to be
[1:07:21] good Christians but see we get lacks we
[1:07:25] get lazy we got our eyes off our eyes
[1:07:28] get filmed over the eagle eyes get
[1:07:30] filmed over sometimes we've got to
[1:07:32] gather more as we see that day
[1:07:34] approaching and that's you know that's a
[1:07:37] it's a it's a topic that was taking
[1:07:39] place at Iowa North Carolina all these
[1:07:41] took place and both pastors were up
[1:07:44] there crying yet brother Brooks was
[1:07:46] crying and brother Tim Humes are crying
[1:07:47] you know and when I went there I just
[1:07:50] know I'm gonna preach what's on my heart
[1:07:51] a burden for my church I'm gonna preach
[1:07:52] it for them
[1:07:53] and God was in a tremendous way and then
[1:07:57] complexes root of bitterness this is one
[1:07:59] this was the big cry at North Carolina
[1:08:01] there was brothers and sisters just when
[1:08:03] he was cursing complex and he was
[1:08:05] cursing I was praying and cursing roots
[1:08:08] of bitterness I mean people were just
[1:08:09] weeping and crying and it was a real
[1:08:11] move of God jesus said if you've got
[1:08:13] something against someone he said go to
[1:08:15] them one on one
[1:08:16] talk to them about your concern right
[1:08:20] how many can say amen to that if they
[1:08:22] won't hear you if they were pet get
[1:08:23] somebody else go be a witness and that's
[1:08:26] a thing in the message we don't do
[1:08:28] enough of we got to do more of that
[1:08:30] praise the Lord you have to do more of
[1:08:32] that if not it's gonna be a root of
[1:08:34] bitterness and it'll kill the anointing
[1:08:36] in the church that's right and
[1:08:39] neglecting the family like I said at
[1:08:41] numerous couples coming up their
[1:08:42] marriages are falling apart right one
[1:08:44] couple say they hate each other you know
[1:08:47] can you imagine and what is it Satan got
[1:08:50] in there and I said I said listen you're
[1:08:53] talking from your mind you have to talk
[1:08:55] from your soul in your soul you took
[1:08:58] that vow with that individual you vowed
[1:09:00] to be married them till death do you
[1:09:01] part and your soul you love that person
[1:09:03] but you let Satan build up some complex
[1:09:07] toward your spouse all these lies you've
[1:09:09] got to cast that down and they said that
[1:09:10] helped them tremendously you've got to
[1:09:13] stop living from the mind we must live
[1:09:15] from the soul what we know is right we
[1:09:18] must do what is right and then
[1:09:22] neglecting the family you know fathers
[1:09:24] not loving their wives parents not
[1:09:26] parenting their children and I think
[1:09:29] this one goes a lot law along with
[1:09:30] church attendance because when we don't
[1:09:32] put God first above everything else it
[1:09:34] sends a strong message to our children
[1:09:36] that God is not in the top priority God
[1:09:40] is just something we do on Sunday
[1:09:41] morning but see for the real family of
[1:09:44] God their life centers around Christ see
[1:09:48] that's what I said whenever whenever one
[1:09:49] of these dead ideas or dead spirits
[1:09:51] enters into home it affects everybody if
[1:09:54] a profiler compromises it's gonna
[1:09:56] instantly affect his children because
[1:09:58] he's gonna treat his children in the
[1:10:00] wrong way you can treat his wife the
[1:10:02] wrong way and then when you got husband
[1:10:03] and wife both with the complex or both
[1:10:05] with one of these lustful spirits or or
[1:10:07] selfish spirit or some some of these
[1:10:09] bitterness spirits when you've got that
[1:10:11] that's directly gonna impact the
[1:10:13] children double and people wonder why
[1:10:16] there's death in the tents and church I
[1:10:18] was looking out there preaching in Iowa
[1:10:19] in North Carolina and everybody can
[1:10:21] almost finish the quotes that I'm saying
[1:10:22] but they're all sin they're dead now not
[1:10:26] all I'm just saying like the people that
[1:10:27] need to repent you understand what I'm
[1:10:28] saying they can
[1:10:30] the Scriptures they can finish the
[1:10:31] quotes but because there's dead things
[1:10:33] in their homes the word doesn't mean
[1:10:36] nothing to him anymore they can finish
[1:10:38] the quotes they got this memorized they
[1:10:40] can tell you where that's found they can
[1:10:42] tell you all these things but who's got
[1:10:43] their first love very few people in the
[1:10:50] churches I've just visited and our
[1:10:51] church how many people have their first
[1:10:56] love and your first love is only known
[1:11:00] by the works that you do for Christ
[1:11:04] because when you have your first love
[1:11:06] jesus said you'll do the first works so
[1:11:09] you have to remember what works did I do
[1:11:11] when I was first Saved if I've got my
[1:11:14] first love I'll act just like that and
[1:11:16] the church said that's not the stage I
[1:11:19] see I'm not promoting my own idea that's
[1:11:21] the Bible
[1:11:22] those are red-letter words those are the
[1:11:25] words of your Lord and Savior my Lord
[1:11:28] and Savior Jesus Christ do you believe
[1:11:30] those words amen
[1:11:32] you you're the only one who knows if
[1:11:34] you're giving your first love to Jesus
[1:11:38] but I can tell you these these had an
[1:11:41] impact they had an impact and you know
[1:11:44] how they act in the next few days weeks
[1:11:46] that will prove that will prove if they
[1:11:48] really got washed they're sprinkled or
[1:11:49] not that will prove it now I just want
[1:11:53] you to prove I want to prove to you what
[1:11:54] a sprinkling means so I'm gonna try to
[1:11:58] go there I've got all these notes and ya
[1:12:06] got all these notes
[1:12:07] and I want to make sure I get to them
[1:12:09] and I want to be time because I want to
[1:12:11] make sure I got to help sister Naomi by
[1:12:14] the grace of the Lord let's go to I
[1:12:17] can't find it real quick here Airness
[1:12:19] okay sorry let's go to first Peter 1
[1:12:21] verse 2 I'm gonna go back to that image
[1:12:23] there because I just think it's so
[1:12:25] powerful this one right here I just
[1:12:28] think that's so powerful to me and and I
[1:12:31] was just after I was preaching I was
[1:12:32] just weeping thanking the Lord in both
[1:12:34] places for showing me this cuz now now I
[1:12:37] can truly understand why people can come
[1:12:38] to church and I will fast and pray I'll
[1:12:41] pray my heart out I'll preach my heart
[1:12:44] out and they leave and it's like they
[1:12:45] never even heard nothing and you've seen
[1:12:48] it too with sinners we invite sinners
[1:12:49] here
[1:12:50] josè even interprets for people you know
[1:12:53] when Kevin grew up and by those guys
[1:12:54] that was so nice to him I don't know
[1:12:56] what impact the word had on them but any
[1:12:58] person whether have said anyone who gets
[1:12:59] in the presence of Jesus Christ will
[1:13:01] never be the same and you can't tell me
[1:13:04] the spirit of Satan is here because
[1:13:07] that's the spirit of lusts and confusion
[1:13:09] but what's here is order and the Word of
[1:13:12] God and that's the Holy Spirit that's
[1:13:15] the Spirit of Truth amen
[1:13:17] hallelujah I know that with all my heart
[1:13:20] so the only way someone could walk out
[1:13:23] of here and not feel the effects of
[1:13:25] having genuine fellowship thus saith the
[1:13:27] Lord God speaking directly to them the
[1:13:29] only way that can happen is if the
[1:13:31] individual kept themselves from being
[1:13:33] clean that's the only way the first
[1:13:37] Peter 1 verse 2 elect according to the
[1:13:40] foreknowledge of God the Father through
[1:13:42] how are we elect how do we know we're
[1:13:44] elect because we let God sanctifies us
[1:13:46] sanctification of the Spirit unto what
[1:13:49] so when you say well brother gesture
[1:13:51] myself I want to be more sanctified what
[1:13:53] does that mean that means you obey more
[1:13:54] of God's Word because it's
[1:13:57] sanctification unto obedience and what
[1:13:59] sprinkling that means anointing so see
[1:14:04] we're elect according to the
[1:14:06] sanctification of the Spirit unto what
[1:14:08] so we'll be more obedient to Christ and
[1:14:10] we'll be sprinkled with the blood of
[1:14:12] Jesus Christ and we know that sprinkling
[1:14:14] is not a physical blood it's the life of
[1:14:16] the blood the token amen the life of the
[1:14:20] blood
[1:14:21] so sprinkling symbolize purification or
[1:14:23] renewed cleanliness and the believer was
[1:14:28] enjoined or commanded to live in
[1:14:31] obedience to the Covenant because that's
[1:14:33] what Hebrews 9 says Hebrews 9 verse 18
[1:14:37] whereupon neither was the first
[1:14:39] Testament was dedicated or consecrated
[1:14:41] without blood she always had that blood
[1:14:43] you always have to have a sprinkling you
[1:14:45] always had to be sprinkled you have to
[1:14:46] be enjoined or commanded or connected or
[1:14:49] anointed you have to be connected to
[1:14:51] that covenant for when Moses had spoken
[1:14:54] every precept to the people according to
[1:14:56] law he took the blood of calves at him
[1:14:58] goats with water and scarlet wool and
[1:15:01] hyssop and sprinkled both the book and
[1:15:02] all the people so he took that Holika he
[1:15:06] took that blood and he sprinkled the
[1:15:07] book huh me know there's an anointing on
[1:15:10] this book hallelujah hallelujah if
[1:15:12] there's not you better get clean because
[1:15:15] at one time you thought there was an
[1:15:16] anointing on it when you first came in
[1:15:18] the covenant but see you've let
[1:15:19] something dead come into your home and
[1:15:21] now the book doesn't seem anointed but
[1:15:23] the Bible said it's anointed Amen it's
[1:15:25] sprinkled oh I don't like to read my
[1:15:27] Bible shame on you you better clean out
[1:15:29] that deadness out of your heart and the
[1:15:31] church said that's the word just the
[1:15:33] word see sprinkle both the book and all
[1:15:37] the people praise God the Bible's
[1:15:39] inspired the people should be inspired
[1:15:41] amen they're enjoying to this covenant
[1:15:44] saying this is the blood of the
[1:15:45] Testament which God hath enjoined or
[1:15:47] commanded unto you that means commanded
[1:15:49] in other words you've got to go bei this
[1:15:52] moreover he sprinkled with blood both
[1:15:54] the tabernacle and all the vessels of
[1:15:56] the ministry and almost all things are
[1:15:59] by the law purged with blood and without
[1:16:01] shedding of blood there's no remission
[1:16:03] of sins thank God for the shed blood of
[1:16:06] Jesus amen
[1:16:09] now can everybody see this type here is
[1:16:13] this clear is this clear that's why like
[1:16:15] you can preach on the rapture people
[1:16:17] aren't moved you can preach our marriage
[1:16:18] and divorce
[1:16:18] people aren't moved you can preach on
[1:16:20] the church age people aren't moved it's
[1:16:22] because deadness has struck them and
[1:16:25] some sin has taken them bitterness like
[1:16:28] I said greed whatever may be lusts and
[1:16:30] it's taken them and they can't enter in
[1:16:33] God actually cuts them
[1:16:35] I mean Oh God does that it's an are
[1:16:37] words are called grieving the Holy
[1:16:39] Spirit go to numbers 1913 you'll see
[1:16:43] this God would literally cut them off if
[1:16:45] you're gonna continue to live in sin and
[1:16:47] not repent God said I'm cutting you off
[1:16:49] you will not come to church and receive
[1:16:52] the same things you used to receive Oh
[1:16:54] hallelujah amen glory I'll tell you
[1:16:57] after these last three weeks I felt like
[1:16:59] a new Christian praise God
[1:17:00] just to see God take his word and bless
[1:17:04] the people and bring them to repentance
[1:17:06] all was just a powerful thing numbers
[1:17:10] 1913 whosoever touches the dead body of
[1:17:13] any man that is dead and purifies not
[1:17:14] himself see who's responsible to purify
[1:17:17] themselves the person who sinned the
[1:17:19] person who touched something dead they
[1:17:21] have to admit they're unclean and they
[1:17:24] have to purify themselves preachers
[1:17:26] can't make people confess they've got to
[1:17:29] confess themselves see because he
[1:17:33] purifies not himself he defiled the
[1:17:36] tabernacle of the Lord and that soul
[1:17:38] shall be cut off from Israel God said if
[1:17:41] you won't come to my house clean I'm
[1:17:42] cutting you off which means the effects
[1:17:44] of the Holy Spirit they won't even have
[1:17:46] fellowship with God and as we'll get to
[1:17:47] at the end then people just come for
[1:17:49] fellowship with other people then church
[1:17:53] is just a social affair and it's more
[1:17:55] important about who you talk to after
[1:17:56] service than who you talk to during in
[1:17:58] service we must talk to Christ in
[1:18:00] service amen because they cannot
[1:18:06] fellowship with God because God showed
[1:18:08] them if you do this you've touched
[1:18:09] something dead you're unclean
[1:18:10] I cannot fellowship with you while
[1:18:12] you're unclean and you know better so
[1:18:14] they just churches a social affair now
[1:18:16] it's it's it's eye-opening it's
[1:18:22] eye-opening to see oh now I can see
[1:18:24] people can be so happy after church but
[1:18:26] not happy during church how can you not
[1:18:28] be happy singing about the precious
[1:18:30] blood how can you not raise your hands
[1:18:33] or you can't even clap your hands in
[1:18:34] here but then somebody tell joka you'll
[1:18:36] cut your hands out there something's
[1:18:38] wrong with that the Bible said clap your
[1:18:39] hands o priests of the Most High God
[1:18:41] amen the Bible said lift up holy hands
[1:18:44] because we're supposed to worship God
[1:18:48] but see if people are cut off what can
[1:18:49] you what can you do you can't do
[1:18:52] anything God Himself cuts them off the
[1:18:55] person has to confess their sins look at
[1:18:58] verse 20 but the man that shall be
[1:18:59] unclean and shall not purify himself
[1:19:01] he'll refuse to repent she'll refuse to
[1:19:03] repent that soul shall be cut off from
[1:19:05] among the congregation because he had to
[1:19:06] file this sanctuary of the Lord the
[1:19:10] water separation hath not been sprinkled
[1:19:12] upon him he's unclean God cuts them off
[1:19:16] I don't like you but I don't want God to
[1:19:20] cut me off the opposite is you've got to
[1:19:25] cut off the sin we'll get to that in a
[1:19:27] little bit that's the reality of it
[1:19:29] either you get cut off or you've got to
[1:19:33] cut something off of your life
[1:19:36] that's exactly right Church so we've
[1:19:40] seen the sprinkling now just for the
[1:19:43] sake of Bible continuity or the pattern
[1:19:46] of the Holy Ghost throughout the
[1:19:47] scripture go to Deuteronomy 1:25 the
[1:19:56] generation that could not enter in the
[1:19:58] promised land they murmured 10 times or
[1:20:02] they they they tempted God 10 times and
[1:20:04] God said after that tenth time you are
[1:20:06] not entering into the baptism of the
[1:20:08] Holy Ghost
[1:20:10] they had a promise in verse 25 but verse
[1:20:14] 26 notwithstanding you would not go up
[1:20:15] but rebelled against the commandment of
[1:20:18] the Lord your God to see they obeyed a
[1:20:20] lot of commands Israel but there was the
[1:20:22] the command to literally go into land
[1:20:25] the command that you don't have to be
[1:20:27] afraid of the battles in the baptism of
[1:20:29] Holy Ghost you can possess the land you
[1:20:32] are more than a conqueror to cast out
[1:20:35] the Giants that are in the land they
[1:20:37] were scared of the battles they were
[1:20:40] scared that they couldn't win the
[1:20:43] victory they were in other words they
[1:20:44] were scared they couldn't make the
[1:20:45] rapture they were scared they couldn't
[1:20:48] have enough faith for a body change so
[1:20:50] why even try they were scared they
[1:20:53] couldn't be as dedicated as they need to
[1:20:55] be dedicated oh my but see Joshua and
[1:20:58] Caleb had a different spirit they
[1:20:59] weren't afraid they knew
[1:21:01] God's calling Jin me that God if God's
[1:21:03] calling me their God will give it to me
[1:21:05] God will equip me if God's calling me in
[1:21:08] there if God sent him in there he'll
[1:21:10] give me the tools to go in there and be
[1:21:12] more than a conqueror but see they
[1:21:15] rebalance that we can't do it we're
[1:21:16] scared look how little we are look look
[1:21:18] at this now look at verse 27 and he
[1:21:21] murmured in your tents where did this
[1:21:23] happen
[1:21:24] it started in their houses remember the
[1:21:28] story of Elijah and the children that
[1:21:29] got eat up by she-bears remember that
[1:21:31] the RAM said what happened their parents
[1:21:33] used to mock Elijah old bald head in
[1:21:35] their houses so they learned to mock the
[1:21:37] preachers in their homes brought it out
[1:21:39] to public and then they got judged in
[1:21:41] public where to start in their tents so
[1:21:46] their tents spiritually were unclean
[1:21:48] spiritually and because they were
[1:21:50] unclean spiritually God cut him off now
[1:21:54] murmur means to backbite and whisper
[1:21:58] they will not enter the land murmuring
[1:22:01] or complaining about the preaching or
[1:22:03] complaining about the Word of God or the
[1:22:05] Bible says this or the Prophet said that
[1:22:07] they don't worse whisper back by or
[1:22:09] complain about that they ask God God
[1:22:11] give me understanding God give me grace
[1:22:13] to possess the promises of God I don't
[1:22:16] know how I'm gonna do it but I know if
[1:22:17] you call me to that position I'll make
[1:22:19] it by your grace amen
[1:22:21] they don't remem and do opposite of the
[1:22:25] word of God they do the word of God a
[1:22:28] third example Josh was 7:21 a can is
[1:22:32] spilling his beans we'd say he's
[1:22:37] confessing the sin to Joshua and he says
[1:22:41] when I saw among the spoils a goodly
[1:22:43] babylonians garment and two hundred
[1:22:45] shekels of silver and a wedge of gold of
[1:22:47] fifty shekels weight then I coveted them
[1:22:50] remember the Bible says covetousness is
[1:22:53] idolatry
[1:22:54] so akin get this in your mind akin did
[1:22:57] not have a a picture of William Branham
[1:22:59] up and bowing down and praising William
[1:23:01] Branham William he didn't have that he'd
[1:23:04] have Star Wars accessories he didn't
[1:23:06] have a Darth Vader statue saying I
[1:23:08] worship Star Wars he didn't have that he
[1:23:12] just had sin buried deep in his life
[1:23:15] unconfessed if you walked into his house
[1:23:19] he could have passed the test of other
[1:23:20] Bram said let me walk into somebody's
[1:23:21] house and let me look at their walls Oh
[1:23:25] hallelujah let me listen to what music
[1:23:28] that he could have passed the test but
[1:23:29] he couldn't pass the test of God Amen
[1:23:32] God because God saw pass just an outward
[1:23:35] profession outward religion God saw what
[1:23:38] was down deep in the ground of his heart
[1:23:41] exactly right and where was the sin in
[1:23:44] his house in his tent and what did God
[1:23:47] do to him swallowed him up in the earth
[1:23:49] right he tried to hide his sin in the
[1:23:56] tent and he hid it from everybody even
[1:23:58] hid it from it you know it's in there
[1:23:59] from his family I don't know what the
[1:24:02] three-part type is there but there's
[1:24:03] three Rob's there's closed money in a
[1:24:05] wedge I'm not quite not quite sure what
[1:24:07] that is I sure when I look into that
[1:24:09] later
[1:24:09] I can't I can't force God to give me a
[1:24:11] revelation it'll come in God's time a
[1:24:13] fourth and final one then we'll move on
[1:24:15] is Acts five nine with Ananias and
[1:24:17] Sapphira s' then Peter said unto her how
[1:24:20] is it that you have agreed together the
[1:24:21] temp that speared the Lord when did they
[1:24:23] agreed together to tempt the spirit it
[1:24:25] hadn't been somewhere outside of church
[1:24:26] because when they came in the church
[1:24:29] they lied and they fell down dead in the
[1:24:32] church and they had to pack him out and
[1:24:35] that's because there was some death
[1:24:37] there was some lie there were some
[1:24:39] Antichrist thought out there in their
[1:24:41] house that they agreed together to
[1:24:43] support - they agreed to lie to the Holy
[1:24:46] Spirit before coming before the Word of
[1:24:48] God in that striking the tent it's all
[1:24:53] about our tent it's all about our home
[1:24:57] in fact your attitude towards the church
[1:25:00] right now is what your attitude toward
[1:25:03] God is at home so when you see people
[1:25:06] not excited about church or now join the
[1:25:08] word anymore it's because they're not
[1:25:10] enjoying the word at home it is because
[1:25:15] just like at home you have a husband and
[1:25:17] wife just like in the church you have a
[1:25:18] husband and wife program said the pastor
[1:25:21] is the husband of the church praise God
[1:25:25] if you let the word of God get common at
[1:25:27] home and things does get common at home
[1:25:28] then everything's gonna be common at
[1:25:30] church you're not gonna have fellowship
[1:25:32] with God and not in something gonna feel
[1:25:33] like God's not even there well I can
[1:25:35] just go visit that church I should go
[1:25:36] visit that church I said maybe I should
[1:25:38] change my membership well maybe you
[1:25:39] should follow the leading of the Lord
[1:25:41] but it's not the word of God's fault if
[1:25:44] you're not having fellowship with God
[1:25:45] it's the fault of death in the tent amen
[1:25:49] we never beg anybody to stay here you
[1:25:51] want to come here hallelujah I'm going
[1:25:54] to preach the word to you I'm gonna try
[1:25:55] to live the word before you but this is
[1:25:58] the problem they don't that people don't
[1:26:00] enjoy we all know there's a honeymoon
[1:26:02] period with your marriages there's a
[1:26:05] honeymoon period just like there's a
[1:26:06] church when people move in here the
[1:26:08] church or people get freshly saved
[1:26:09] mother so on fire and that's just a many
[1:26:12] times that's a natural excitement but
[1:26:16] give it a few months and you'll see
[1:26:19] who's really in love with Christ but
[1:26:23] Dennis McBride written he and I were
[1:26:24] talking lately
[1:26:24] he said well Jesse I've learned over the
[1:26:26] years he said I get excited about the
[1:26:27] people who stay not about the new people
[1:26:29] that come and I said brother that's a
[1:26:31] lot of wisdom right there because you
[1:26:35] would get you get excited when your
[1:26:37] husband sticks with you even though you
[1:26:38] made a mistake or your wife sticks with
[1:26:40] you even though you made a mistake why
[1:26:41] because it's a vow of love and you've
[1:26:45] got commitment to make this fresh to
[1:26:48] make this work we're going to make this
[1:26:49] work we're in this to the end that's how
[1:26:52] we should be with our home church
[1:26:53] wherever God tells you to be we should
[1:26:55] be fully devoted fully committed and
[1:26:57] this is just the reflection of what's
[1:26:59] going on in your tent in your house
[1:27:02] nothing but the truth and like I said
[1:27:05] I've seen two pastors weep over this
[1:27:07] lately so I know it's just not my burden
[1:27:09] it's all genuine pastors it's all their
[1:27:12] burden that's right
[1:27:15] weeping is not enough to cry over sin is
[1:27:20] not enough it's a good start you can
[1:27:21] have a dried out confession but weeping
[1:27:23] is not enough numbers 25 verse 6 teaches
[1:27:25] us that Israel had been tempted by
[1:27:29] Balaam to go out to meet with Balaam at
[1:27:31] bale peor it was a feast of make
[1:27:34] believers Oh with I say like this make
[1:27:36] believers
[1:27:38] they were tempting people that thought
[1:27:40] there were believers from Israel they
[1:27:41] were tempting them with sexual lusts and
[1:27:44] member 24,000 died remember that brother
[1:27:49] man likens that unto bride or people who
[1:27:51] go to message churches that get tempted
[1:27:52] to go to denominational churches because
[1:27:55] they let them do any old sin they want
[1:27:56] to do say you're still going to heaven
[1:27:58] you said I'll say like this I don't know
[1:28:00] who's going to heaven but I know those
[1:28:02] who got the Holy Ghost will be in the
[1:28:03] word all the way and they'll be so
[1:28:05] sprinkled with God's blood that there
[1:28:07] will be obedient and sanctified to the
[1:28:09] day of their exemption amen so there's
[1:28:15] this awful plague going around because
[1:28:17] of the sexual sin and in verse 6 the
[1:28:19] Bible said behold when the children of
[1:28:20] Israel came and brought us under a
[1:28:22] brother and a mini nice woman the side
[1:28:23] of Moses to the side of all the
[1:28:24] congregation of the children of Israel
[1:28:25] who were weeping before the door of the
[1:28:27] tabernacle of the congregation so
[1:28:30] everybody's are weeping everybody's
[1:28:31] crying right here I'm sorry right
[1:28:32] everybody's crying right here oh there's
[1:28:34] such an awful plague Oh
[1:28:35] sin is so awful and church sin is awful
[1:28:38] sin is awful
[1:28:40] you feel like you feel like you're not
[1:28:42] forgiven if you like you you don't even
[1:28:45] you feel dark like there's no light you
[1:28:47] feel like you're hungry there's no
[1:28:48] there's no bread feels like your prayers
[1:28:50] or do you mean hurt it feels like God's
[1:28:52] not even listening to you
[1:28:54] amen but weeping is just the start
[1:28:59] because they're just weeping and then
[1:29:01] what happens the plague didn't stop
[1:29:03] because people came up to the altar
[1:29:04] weeping the plague stopped when a
[1:29:07] Phineas got ahold of the spear and he
[1:29:10] went into the tent of that Israelite man
[1:29:14] and he thrust it through the man and the
[1:29:16] woman who are committing fornication and
[1:29:19] then the penguins of the plague would
[1:29:21] state that's when you'll get your
[1:29:23] victory back when whatever you were
[1:29:25] holding on to gets cut off and it dies
[1:29:27] amen we've been as not enough they were
[1:29:31] all leaping right here but Phineas said
[1:29:33] somebody's gotta have a burden to get
[1:29:35] this sin out of the church amen and God
[1:29:41] said I'm going to make him a priest
[1:29:42] forever because he was zealous for the
[1:29:44] tabernacle of God amen glory God make me
[1:29:49] a Phineas
[1:29:50] let me be a Moses or Aaron whatever I
[1:29:53] just want to be on the Lord's side amen
[1:29:57] he said while he was zealous for my sake
[1:30:00] among them I consume not the turn of
[1:30:01] Israel in my jealousy God said because
[1:30:05] Phineas did this I'll give him my
[1:30:06] covenant peace he'll always have peace
[1:30:09] with God who always that fellowship with
[1:30:10] God because he was zealous to cut out
[1:30:12] any sin out of their lives and it was
[1:30:16] the it was the Prince of a chief house
[1:30:18] this wasn't just a regular message
[1:30:20] church member this was a prince message
[1:30:22] member he was a well-known message
[1:30:25] member and so as his adulterous nurse it
[1:30:30] may be adulterous or fornicating woman
[1:30:32] she was a daughter of a chief house of
[1:30:34] midian these were well-known famous
[1:30:37] people this is well this is a heavy type
[1:30:40] air heavy offering give her this is
[1:30:42] somebody who's really well-known in the
[1:30:44] church and it'll go there and cut that
[1:30:47] sin out of the church
[1:30:48] see because Finnish knew either we're
[1:30:51] going to call it the sin or God's going
[1:30:52] to cut us off so he cared more about the
[1:30:56] people that he did about one family
[1:30:58] that's how we are - we care more about
[1:31:00] the body of Christ than just one
[1:31:02] individual who won't repent or something
[1:31:03] like that what we have to do is make
[1:31:05] sure there's no leaven in the house amen
[1:31:08] weeping alone won't do it it's going to
[1:31:11] take going home and cutting out the dead
[1:31:13] thing in Matthew 21 Jesus cleansed the
[1:31:19] temple for the second time he cleaned it
[1:31:21] on the first year of his ministry he
[1:31:23] comes back in the third year of his
[1:31:24] ministry and he cleanses it in Matthew
[1:31:26] 21 verses Alette or 12 13 and 14 after
[1:31:30] he cleanse at church in verse 14 the
[1:31:32] Bible said and the blind and the lame
[1:31:34] came to him in the temple and He healed
[1:31:36] them once all the dead things were
[1:31:40] caught out once all the money grubbing
[1:31:42] was cut out of church now people could
[1:31:44] get healed amen just like here people
[1:31:47] could get healed if they'll just get the
[1:31:49] deadness other tent get away from it get
[1:31:51] anointed then the prints of God and God
[1:31:53] will heal us God will heal you God can
[1:31:56] heal me God can heal anybody if they'll
[1:31:58] just repent of their sins amen and cut
[1:32:01] it off
[1:32:04] and this word brought three up say like
[1:32:08] this with all the people combined maybe
[1:32:09] 350 people to their faces and I
[1:32:13] appreciate that sincerity see God cuts
[1:32:17] them up because in Matthew 13 58 he said
[1:32:19] he did not many works there because of
[1:32:21] their unbelief if someone won't realize
[1:32:26] and you know I am I am unclean if
[1:32:28] someone won't admit that and humble
[1:32:30] themselves and come before the gate
[1:32:34] there then God said I'm gonna cut you
[1:32:38] off they really don't believe the
[1:32:39] message right they really don't believe
[1:32:42] it he could do men not many mighty works
[1:32:45] because of their unbelief in 1st Peter
[1:32:48] 3:7 if a man doesn't treat his wife
[1:32:51] right the Bible said his prayers are
[1:32:53] hindered this is a perfect type God cut
[1:32:57] you off you won't have any fellowship
[1:32:57] with your prayer a man that won't treat
[1:32:59] his wife the right way he has no altar
[1:33:02] of incense in his house I'm glad God
[1:33:04] hears our prayers amen if God doesn't
[1:33:07] hear your prayers there's probably
[1:33:09] something dead in the house never
[1:33:11] understand God cuts off your prayers if
[1:33:15] you won't treat your family right if
[1:33:16] there's death in your tent if there's
[1:33:18] some bad feeling in your house I'm not
[1:33:20] even listening to your prayers it's a
[1:33:22] perfect type that's why to me it was it
[1:33:25] was thus saith the Lord to me it was
[1:33:26] this is the word all tied together
[1:33:27] praise God like I said I couldn't preach
[1:33:30] this the first year came the message God
[1:33:32] had to add one thing at a time
[1:33:33] I had this add that add that that and
[1:33:37] God showed it to me
[1:33:38] first John 3:21 beloved if our heart
[1:33:41] condemn us not then we have confidence
[1:33:43] toward God an unclean man could not come
[1:33:47] in he could have no confidence with God
[1:33:48] he's cut off remember the Bible said in
[1:33:53] James chapter 1 if you asked for wisdom
[1:33:55] but then you're tossed back and forth
[1:33:57] like I don't know God heard my prayer
[1:33:59] the Bible said let not that man think he
[1:34:01] shall receive anything from the Lord God
[1:34:03] cannot take even unbelief even unbelief
[1:34:07] or doubt is a unclean sin and you need
[1:34:10] sprinkled for unbelief
[1:34:11] how many could say amen to that just
[1:34:14] even in your prayer is God gonna meet my
[1:34:16] financial need
[1:34:18] God's gonna give me wisdom with this
[1:34:19] difficult situation with my family I
[1:34:21] don't know how to handle this with
[1:34:22] somebody at the church
[1:34:23] you can't even doubt that you've got to
[1:34:25] have faith to know that God wants to
[1:34:27] help you amen
[1:34:28] God will help you but a spirit of
[1:34:32] unbelief is uncleanness and let not that
[1:34:36] man think he'll receive anything from
[1:34:38] God because he's cut off so uncleanness
[1:34:42] is as simple as doubting God and that
[1:34:46] pastor with brother Tim Eames was
[1:34:47] praised that God let the people start
[1:34:50] listening to their tapes again in the
[1:34:51] homes praise God you know I think
[1:34:58] whatever IFC happened and maybe Wendy
[1:35:00] and brother John and those of you know
[1:35:02] but we've been cutting together since we
[1:35:04] come in when we first came in there was
[1:35:06] so much preaching on people that all
[1:35:07] just memorized brother Branham memorized
[1:35:09] brother Branham but they weren't doing
[1:35:11] what brother Branham said I think there
[1:35:13] was so much preaching on that Satan may
[1:35:15] have used that oh yeah I'm a listener
[1:35:18] brother Ram so much and you can quarter
[1:35:19] this than that
[1:35:20] I think Satan use that to get people
[1:35:22] well it's not how much I listen to
[1:35:24] brother Branham but yet if you believe
[1:35:27] the Bible you will hear God's prophet if
[1:35:29] you are hungry for truth you will press
[1:35:31] play on your phone or on your mp3 player
[1:35:34] right you will do that but I think that
[1:35:39] was used so much and yes it was right
[1:35:40] because there are some people that
[1:35:41] worship brother Branham that break the
[1:35:44] word and they listen to tapes all the
[1:35:45] time but they only do what they want to
[1:35:47] do on those tapes not what the Holy
[1:35:49] Spirit is telling them to do and they'll
[1:35:51] never play a tape that burns their hide
[1:35:53] they'll never do that because that evil
[1:35:56] spirit wants to hide behind it that
[1:35:57] religious thing and say we'll look how
[1:35:59] we're listening to message we're
[1:36:00] faithful all these things like that
[1:36:01] let's listen to it and let's confess if
[1:36:04] we're wrong let's repent if we're wrong
[1:36:06] let's obey all the Word of God
[1:36:09] clarissa don't you know even your own
[1:36:11] behavior can knock somebody else out of
[1:36:13] getting healed your misbehavior of
[1:36:14] unconfessed sin of you believers can
[1:36:16] cause this church to bitterly fail and
[1:36:18] at the day of judgment you'll be
[1:36:19] responsible for it because he cuts him
[1:36:23] off if they won't repent of the and like
[1:36:25] I said last week it's for us in the
[1:36:28] message it's not what
[1:36:30] not well we need more new stuff we need
[1:36:32] to live the old stuff we need to do what
[1:36:35] we know is the right that's the problem
[1:36:39] we're not doing what we know we should
[1:36:41] do God's getting second place or some
[1:36:45] spirits got in there
[1:36:46] we're disobedient though were the words
[1:36:48] not fresh anymore but God said it's
[1:36:50] always gonna be fresh how can God say
[1:36:52] the words always gonna be hot and fresh
[1:36:53] whether you say it's not hot and fresh
[1:36:55] some somebody's ruling here you are God
[1:36:58] I don't know I think you're wrong
[1:37:00] it's always hot fresh bread before the
[1:37:03] throne of God for people who are clean
[1:37:06] in God's eyes amen
[1:37:07] it's exactly right see critical
[1:37:13] murmuring see sin because they love sin
[1:37:18] they speak against God's Word it's
[1:37:21] exactly right
[1:37:23] remember in our adultery when Jesus
[1:37:25] preaching on adultery don't you love
[1:37:26] when he magnified the law I love how the
[1:37:28] Bible said he magnified the law what is
[1:37:30] the magnifying glass do brothers it
[1:37:32] makes things that are small it enlarges
[1:37:35] them and Jesus came and he enlarged the
[1:37:38] sin of adultery it's not the physical
[1:37:40] act but we got to see things that were
[1:37:42] previously unseen that's what a
[1:37:46] magnifying glass does you can't see
[1:37:47] those little cells but when you look
[1:37:48] through there that Magnum microscope now
[1:37:50] you can see something living that was
[1:37:54] previously unseen and when Jesus came to
[1:37:56] Sarah preaching on lust their spirit /
[1:37:59] lusts what was he doing he was
[1:38:00] magnifying the law so now we can see the
[1:38:03] effects of these unseen living things
[1:38:05] these unseen fallen angels these demons
[1:38:09] amen glory he magnified the law he
[1:38:13] largest so we can see all there's living
[1:38:16] things under this cancer and the church
[1:38:18] said there's a life inside of that
[1:38:22] cancer there's a life inside that tumor
[1:38:24] you've got to get to the unseen thing
[1:38:25] and he magnified the law that we could
[1:38:28] see and understand these things so jesus
[1:38:31] said if you've already lusted in your
[1:38:33] heart you've already committed adultery
[1:38:34] he said if your right eye offends you
[1:38:37] keep it for a while let it hang on for a
[1:38:41] few months
[1:38:43] and see if you can enjoy sin for a
[1:38:44] season and still be a Holy Ghost field
[1:38:47] Christian no no Jesus said if that right
[1:38:51] eye offend thee pluck it out he said cut
[1:38:54] it off cut it out
[1:38:58] don't let that sin remain in your tent
[1:39:02] he said it for its profitable for thee
[1:39:04] that one of your members should perish
[1:39:06] and that not the whole body he said be
[1:39:09] cast into hell he said if the right
[1:39:12] hands offend you cut it off see the less
[1:39:15] law of God either you cut off the sin or
[1:39:18] the unbelief or God's gonna cut you off
[1:39:20] right and in every temptation we read on
[1:39:24] Wednesday night God makes a way of
[1:39:26] escape you can't say well well I
[1:39:29] couldn't overcome this bill jester I
[1:39:30] couldn't do that no sir God had an exit
[1:39:33] sign somewhere you've got to look around
[1:39:34] for the exit side amen
[1:39:36] now we need one over there actually I
[1:39:38] think to meet code though trustees bang
[1:39:41] bang you know I've got to work on that I
[1:39:44] do honestly think we might need one I
[1:39:45] don't have to look into that I know we
[1:39:46] have one down the end of the hallway
[1:39:47] that's just some small but anyways God I
[1:39:49] just gotta throw in Spyder
[1:39:50] God says there's got to be an exit sign
[1:39:53] amen
[1:39:55] there is a way out the promise we're too
[1:39:58] busy looking at the sin then looking at
[1:40:00] the exit sign and he said flee from
[1:40:03] idolatry run from it don't run to your
[1:40:06] phone run to Christ don't run to the
[1:40:10] backbiting run to Christ or run to that
[1:40:12] person and talk to them about your
[1:40:14] problem how many love Lord so let me
[1:40:18] close with this how what time is it okay
[1:40:19] I never set a timer I forgot I was you
[1:40:21] know giving bang his gift there I want
[1:40:26] to just close with this thought this is
[1:40:28] the discipline I'm calling like I said
[1:40:29] in my invitation to the church I'm
[1:40:31] calling everybody to be more disciplined
[1:40:32] this year it's up to you you know if you
[1:40:35] know if you don't feel the pole the Holy
[1:40:36] Spirit that's fine but I feel the pole
[1:40:38] after what God has done in the last
[1:40:40] three weeks and also the previous year I
[1:40:43] feel a pole to be more dedicated to
[1:40:45] Christ
[1:40:46] I brought my children here the last two
[1:40:48] months every Sunday and we prayed 30
[1:40:50] minutes before service right here and my
[1:40:52] children their behavior home has
[1:40:53] tremendously improved I'm a witness to
[1:40:56] that and I'm praying every Sunday film
[1:40:59] what the Holy Ghost film what the Holy
[1:41:00] Ghost let them love you Jesus more than
[1:41:03] I do
[1:41:04] give them a double portion of what's on
[1:41:06] me because I know you're telling me
[1:41:09] there's a lot of love for Jesus and if
[1:41:11] they could a double portion when I got
[1:41:12] hallelujah they'll love Jesus even
[1:41:14] mihari men and that's my prayer so it's
[1:41:19] the leaders remember if a man doesn't
[1:41:21] know how to rule his own house how
[1:41:23] should he take care of the house of God
[1:41:25] a man rules his own house which means
[1:41:31] presides over that means he's the
[1:41:33] guardian see he's supposed to make sure
[1:41:36] death doesn't come in the house
[1:41:38] it means the protector he's supposed to
[1:41:41] protect his children from evil
[1:41:42] influences he said it means to give
[1:41:45] attention to he's supposed to diligently
[1:41:48] pay attention to the affairs of his
[1:41:50] house but see we got so many things
[1:41:53] distracting us mainly for brothers it's
[1:41:54] work you know we get so tired at work
[1:41:57] right mother bangs not in there yeah I'm
[1:41:59] the same way you know when I get so busy
[1:42:03] work or there's different things that
[1:42:04] come up and you know just a normal
[1:42:05] things of life
[1:42:06] it just takes our focus off our homes
[1:42:09] but we're the ones brothers we have to
[1:42:11] answer to God for the state of our homes
[1:42:14] and we can't expect to rule the house of
[1:42:17] God or be a leader in the church if
[1:42:19] we're not leaders in our home which
[1:42:23] means presiding over giving attention to
[1:42:25] our homes making sure there's no sin in
[1:42:27] our homes and then women have a role in
[1:42:31] this too
[1:42:32] did you know the word the Bible said
[1:42:33] that women are to marry bear children
[1:42:35] and guide the house did you know that
[1:42:37] guide you know if that means manage
[1:42:39] family affairs she is to manage the
[1:42:44] family affairs while daddy's out her
[1:42:47] hubby's out she's the manager so he's
[1:42:50] like the CEO and she's like the manager
[1:42:52] is that okay illustration right but the
[1:42:57] CEO comes to check on the managers is
[1:43:01] that true I'm just trying to give you an
[1:43:03] illustration he can't be there all the
[1:43:05] time but he's gonna come and check in
[1:43:06] this how's this going I need to preside
[1:43:08] over this I need to watch how's it going
[1:43:11] never I understand I'll tell you when my
[1:43:16] wife when she gives the order those
[1:43:19] children line up because she's the
[1:43:21] manager there she's guiding the home
[1:43:24] sometimes I gotta shake myself a little
[1:43:26] bit I'm so tired you know all right
[1:43:28] be the man preside over you know because
[1:43:31] she's just used to being in the channel
[1:43:33] being a manager which I appreciate that
[1:43:34] but as a man I've got to come home and
[1:43:36] I've always got to be ready to be the
[1:43:40] presider the overseer I've got to be
[1:43:43] able to give grace and help to my wife
[1:43:45] and strengthen my wife and love to my
[1:43:47] wife right husband's mistreat your wives
[1:43:50] no husbands love your wives wives tell
[1:43:55] your husband's what to do no sir wives
[1:43:56] submit yourself to your own husband's as
[1:43:59] unto the Lord in everything let's say
[1:44:03] together let's say everything ready
[1:44:04] everything she's to submit in everything
[1:44:09] but see a man's got to be led of the
[1:44:11] Spirit for her to submit to that he's
[1:44:13] got to be a loving leader he's got a
[1:44:16] stain he's gotta be a Phineas - he's
[1:44:17] gotta stand up against it he's got he's
[1:44:19] got to be a real man he's got to rule
[1:44:21] this house who's responsible for the
[1:44:23] dedication overall in the house it's the
[1:44:25] man who's responsible for the discipline
[1:44:28] of the house it's really the man it
[1:44:29] should be and he's called to that and
[1:44:34] let me say this I really felt like and
[1:44:37] then you can you can maybe disagree with
[1:44:38] me on this I felt like when I preach the
[1:44:40] Thyatira in church age I thought God I
[1:44:42] felt like God gave me a thus saith the
[1:44:44] Lord
[1:44:45] on Revelation to the 2:19 let's read
[1:44:48] that I felt it was like a dust say at
[1:44:49] the Lord to me it's the secret to being
[1:44:52] an overcomer and that's what I was
[1:44:54] preaching out with the other places and
[1:44:56] I told it to you here I felt brother man
[1:44:57] said Jesus gonna whisper secrets for the
[1:44:59] rapture to his wife until he comes back
[1:45:01] and I felt this was a secret Christ
[1:45:03] whispered into my soul that the way to
[1:45:07] be an overcomer is not to decrease your
[1:45:10] service to Christ but increase it
[1:45:14] because just think of it logically just
[1:45:17] be logical to have your first love you
[1:45:20] have to do your first works
[1:45:23] right but then Jesus said I saw your
[1:45:26] first works but I saw your last to be
[1:45:29] more than first so it was revealed to me
[1:45:34] that a Holy Ghost filled Christian or
[1:45:37] someone who's an overcomer they're able
[1:45:39] to capture and harness the love and zeal
[1:45:43] they had for God when they first came in
[1:45:44] the message and actually increased it
[1:45:47] until they died or rapture amen
[1:45:49] how did he appraise God Damon it's
[1:45:53] revealed to me Solomon what he what he
[1:45:57] stopped doing he stopped the ministry of
[1:45:58] God he started building temples for
[1:46:00] idols he never kept his first love he
[1:46:03] actually decrease in the amount of
[1:46:05] service and Tabernacles and sacrifice he
[1:46:07] actually decreased as he went along and
[1:46:10] so when I see people decreasing ties
[1:46:12] offerings church attendance decreasing
[1:46:15] attention during service decreasing
[1:46:17] anything - decreasing fellowshipping
[1:46:19] with the Saints what's what's happening
[1:46:21] here we shouldn't decrease we should
[1:46:24] increase and you can you can bring me
[1:46:27] I'm happy to meet anybody you can bring
[1:46:29] me a Bible argument or quote argument
[1:46:30] anywhere and I'll meet you right in that
[1:46:32] room right there or we can meet right
[1:46:33] here at the pulpit but if anybody can
[1:46:36] show me anything different I'd sure like
[1:46:37] to see it and have a word message and
[1:46:41] everything together I sure like to see
[1:46:43] it if I'm wrong because I know I'm not
[1:46:45] wrong cuz it's God's Word that's how you
[1:46:48] know you're right you got the word okay
[1:46:51] revelation 2:19 I know thy works and
[1:46:53] charity and service and faith and thy
[1:46:54] patience and thy works and the last
[1:46:56] works to be more than the first works
[1:47:00] but jesus said if you want if you want
[1:47:03] to get right with God you got to go back
[1:47:04] and do the first works yes you do you
[1:47:07] see you've got to go back and new your
[1:47:09] first works what was I doing for Jesus
[1:47:11] when I first came in the message you've
[1:47:13] got to go back to that replicate that
[1:47:15] reproduce that do it again and then
[1:47:17] actually find more ways to increase your
[1:47:19] service to God is that clear is that
[1:47:23] Bible teaching we all say Amen it is
[1:47:27] amen it is amen
[1:47:28] Lynette so what a lesson this is there's
[1:47:30] no ceasing of this gracious service of
[1:47:32] love unto the Lord see because people
[1:47:35] that really love the Lord
[1:47:36] they're serving him and giving him more
[1:47:39] of their time more of their service
[1:47:40] because they're not their own they were
[1:47:43] bought with the price I do not belong to
[1:47:47] myself I belong to Jesus Christ he shed
[1:47:51] his eternal plan to save me and the
[1:47:53] least I can do is find more ways how to
[1:47:55] serve him in my life amen
[1:47:57] but if I decrease my service what I'm
[1:47:59] sure is that I've let something dead
[1:48:01] come into my house my life it's actually
[1:48:05] drawing away it's actually I'm less
[1:48:06] influenced by the Word of God unless
[1:48:08] influenced by these things they don't
[1:48:10] mean as much to me and now I've got dead
[1:48:12] things that I love more in my home than
[1:48:14] I love the house of God hallelujah
[1:48:18] praise God amen thank you Jesus buh-bam
[1:48:24] said that is the secret I thought it was
[1:48:29] thus saith the Lord to me sister Wendy I
[1:48:31] thought I no wonder I had to preach
[1:48:33] these Church ages no wonder I preached
[1:48:35] 50 messages on the church pages let the
[1:48:39] enemy attempt to thwart our service to
[1:48:42] the Lord see that's what Satan's doing
[1:48:43] now he's trying to decrease the amount
[1:48:45] of service you do to God
[1:48:47] money witnessing church attendance you
[1:48:51] name it time on your phone he's trying
[1:48:53] to decrease your service and brother man
[1:48:55] tells us what our reply is Satan saying
[1:48:58] oh you don't have to do this
[1:48:59] come over here you just take a little
[1:49:01] break he said take a little break
[1:49:03] brother BAM said our reply is increased
[1:49:06] service so when Satan saying brother
[1:49:09] Jesse just you know relax a little bit
[1:49:12] don't get so uptight about serving God I
[1:49:14] look at him and say shut up devil I'm
[1:49:16] gonna give God more of my time now get
[1:49:20] behind me because I'm resisting you and
[1:49:24] the Bible said you've got to flee amen
[1:49:27] he might sound like he's talking all
[1:49:29] around your ear keep resisting him he's
[1:49:31] got to go eventually amen
[1:49:33] you have to suffer through you know
[1:49:35] trials all this time the reason we feel
[1:49:37] like Satan keeps binding us in these
[1:49:39] things is because we let him stay
[1:49:41] because we obey what he says rather than
[1:49:43] resisting what he says but if you resist
[1:49:46] him and knew what's right he has to flee
[1:49:48] that's the st. the scripture
[1:49:50] amen and so just as a little testimony
[1:49:54] here let me show this I've steered my
[1:49:57] brother Scott a couple weeks ago I
[1:49:59] started writing a book about your
[1:50:00] outward appearance I've given every
[1:50:04] moment of my time now I've got an
[1:50:06] introduction introductions done 500
[1:50:08] words chapter one has done six thousand
[1:50:12] three hundred twenty six words chapter
[1:50:15] two how to apply Old Testament scripture
[1:50:17] the New Testament four thousand five
[1:50:19] hundred eighty five words I preached
[1:50:23] three times a week sometimes five
[1:50:24] because twice at middle school Bible
[1:50:25] Club I've got fifty two YouTube videos
[1:50:28] all about the message of the hour I'm
[1:50:32] gonna write a book by God I told you
[1:50:33] last summer remember adamant bow I told
[1:50:34] you how the minds day I said God's
[1:50:36] leading me to write a book and so I've
[1:50:38] got two chapters done I'm gonna find a
[1:50:42] way to fulfill Revelation 219 in my life
[1:50:46] I will not be a Solomon I will be a
[1:50:49] Christian I will find a way to give more
[1:50:53] of myself to Christ because it is only
[1:50:56] Satan himself it is only the Antichrist
[1:50:59] pale death horse rider that's trying to
[1:51:02] say just decrease your just decrease
[1:51:04] your service a little bit be less they
[1:51:06] they dedicated to Christ I'm gonna be
[1:51:08] more dedicated to Christ my reprise show
[1:51:11] up Satan I'm giving God every moment of
[1:51:12] my time amen let's stand to our feet by
[1:51:15] God's grace and I'm just doing that as a
[1:51:19] little testimony here I'm finding every
[1:51:21] channel I can to be a blessing of the
[1:51:23] Bride of Christ so see a real overcomer
[1:51:28] he's the most diligent or she's the most
[1:51:30] diligent person on the earth is a real
[1:51:32] overcomer because they're diligently
[1:51:34] giving more of themselves to Christ they
[1:51:37] go back when they repent they go back to
[1:51:38] their first works and then they increase
[1:51:40] it the overcomer the secret habit and
[1:51:45] overcomer is also sacrificing more of
[1:51:47] their time for christ more services for
[1:51:51] christ more dedication which leads to
[1:51:53] more success Joshua said you have good
[1:51:57] success if you do three things speak the
[1:51:59] word
[1:51:59] don't let the part of your mouth think
[1:52:01] only on the word meditate on the word
[1:52:04] obey the word he said you'll be a good
[1:52:06] success how many want to be successful
[1:52:08] as a Christian I do so see the secret
[1:52:12] habit of the overcomer is that they they
[1:52:15] are more organized than the foolish
[1:52:18] person because they organize their
[1:52:20] entire life to set around more service
[1:52:23] to Christ they are better planners
[1:52:27] they're more organized they're better
[1:52:29] planners they have better meditation
[1:52:31] they're more disciplined than foolish
[1:52:33] Christians because their service to God
[1:52:36] is always increasing so they have to say
[1:52:39] no to everything else and they have to
[1:52:41] say yes to Jesus Christ well Graham said
[1:52:48] when people get lacs and they become
[1:52:51] drifting like the ephesian church age
[1:52:52] they were drifting he said they stopped
[1:52:54] doing what they used to do and start
[1:52:55] doing things they initially wouldn't do
[1:52:58] initially wouldn't miss church I
[1:53:00] initially wouldn't miss paying my tithes
[1:53:02] and offerings I initially wouldn't watch
[1:53:04] that but now we watch it sometimes you
[1:53:08] see how death enters in so simple
[1:53:11] but the Christian the secret that Jesus
[1:53:13] I believe is whispering like I told
[1:53:14] these charges the secret is whispering
[1:53:17] is give me more of your time put me
[1:53:22] first be more organized for me plan
[1:53:28] ahead more like we shouldn't be missing
[1:53:31] church we shouldn't even be late to
[1:53:33] church you have to plan if your letter
[1:53:37] the Holy Spirit you plan all the events
[1:53:38] so you can get there to enter into the
[1:53:40] Holy Spirit and I appreciate people that
[1:53:43] drive long distances I think that's
[1:53:44] tremendous I think that's fantastic but
[1:53:47] we used to drive three hours to church
[1:53:48] in Lima and we were there at nine
[1:53:50] o'clock or 9:15 every Sunday morning for
[1:53:54] Bible study with brother Craig and
[1:53:56] church started at 10:30 see the real
[1:54:00] Holy Ghost field Christian they hear the
[1:54:02] whispering of Jesus if you want your
[1:54:07] first and then I'm calling you to more
[1:54:14] service
[1:54:17] that's the Bible are we always
[1:54:23] decreasing in the work of the Lord or
[1:54:25] abounding who can finish that sense for
[1:54:27] me we are always what anybody abounding
[1:54:34] 1st Corinthians 15:58 wherefore my
[1:54:37] beloved brethren be steadfast unmovable
[1:54:39] always abounding in the work of the Lord
[1:54:42] that means increasing for as much as you
[1:54:47] know that your labor is not in vain in
[1:54:50] the Lord therefore as you abound in
[1:54:57] everything Christians and faith some
[1:55:02] people don't have enough faith to put on
[1:55:03] a tape
[1:55:04] you know I'm enough faith to come and
[1:55:06] pray or lay their hands on somebody
[1:55:08] somebody's at the altar I don't have
[1:55:09] enough faith to come up and help them
[1:55:10] pray why cuz there something's dead
[1:55:12] something's dead and they feel unclean
[1:55:16] but see we abound in everything in faith
[1:55:19] and utterance we're always talking about
[1:55:20] the Lord talking about the message
[1:55:22] talking about the word in knowledge and
[1:55:24] in all diligence and in your love for us
[1:55:29] see that you abound in this grace also
[1:55:32] diligence means your earnestness your
[1:55:35] striving after anything your interest
[1:55:37] what are you most interested you should
[1:55:39] be more interested in the message of the
[1:55:40] hour and the church said if not then
[1:55:44] you've lost your diligence and the
[1:55:46] orders only one way to get it back go
[1:55:48] back and do what you used to do cut off
[1:55:50] everything else that distracts you from
[1:55:52] the Word of God and give Jesus
[1:55:54] everything that's the only way that is
[1:55:59] the secret to a Christian brother BAM
[1:56:00] says increase your service saying said
[1:56:05] oh just cut this corner here don't go to
[1:56:08] church on Wednesday night don't even try
[1:56:10] to livestream
[1:56:10] it's not worth your time oh it's worth
[1:56:12] more it's worth everything it's worth
[1:56:15] everything you won't be as good a
[1:56:16] Christian on Thursday without the Word
[1:56:18] of God on Wednesday because God is able
[1:56:24] to make all grace abound to you I don't
[1:56:26] know how it's gonna work God but I know
[1:56:28] I'm gonna put you first I might be a
[1:56:29] little tired at work or I might be a
[1:56:31] little short on some bills but I'm gonna
[1:56:32] put you first
[1:56:33] anyway the Bible said God will make all
[1:56:35] grace abound to you if you abound your
[1:56:39] life and time to Christ he'll make all
[1:56:40] his grace abound to you amen bori may
[1:56:46] abound to every good work see how habits
[1:56:50] reveal what spirit is anointing us
[1:56:52] Butler have said habits our spirits I've
[1:56:54] got a habit not to pay my tithe I got a
[1:56:56] habit to skip preaching I've got a habit
[1:56:59] not to play brother Branham at home it's
[1:57:00] because you got an unclean spirit on you
[1:57:03] and the church said habits you just got
[1:57:06] a bad habit
[1:57:07] amen ask me a few months ago he said but
[1:57:09] Jessie can you preach on habits so I
[1:57:11] just said it on my to-do list I'll do
[1:57:12] that preaching on right now these are
[1:57:16] just habits Netflix smartphones
[1:57:18] bad apps bad videos there's just habits
[1:57:22] spirits I mean you can get to work half
[1:57:25] an hour early but can't come to church
[1:57:27] half know early I'm not making it a law
[1:57:32] I'm just saying like Jesus said we
[1:57:33] should increase you know and bound in
[1:57:36] our works for Jesus
[1:57:38] how does work and family get more
[1:57:41] devotion than Jesus Christ how can it
[1:57:45] happen it's because something died
[1:57:49] somebody is cut off they don't even hear
[1:57:53] they don't even hear God's God we used
[1:57:55] to whisper come fellowship with me I
[1:57:57] like to feed you my word I have a table
[1:58:00] spread where the saints of God have a
[1:58:03] and I'm inviting you come and have
[1:58:05] fellowship with me coming here if I say
[1:58:08] it the Lord but it's like I'll just make
[1:58:10] an excuse I've got a marriage I gotta
[1:58:12] attend to I've got a field I got attend
[1:58:14] to
[1:58:14] I've got a yoke of oxen and pretty soon
[1:58:18] pretty soon there's no more fellowship
[1:58:20] with Christ well God doesn't talk to me
[1:58:22] at the church anymore did he use to is
[1:58:26] God still talking or not what do you
[1:58:28] think church is God still talking or not
[1:58:30] who is the most disciplined person who
[1:58:33] is the most organized person who is the
[1:58:36] most successful person who is the most
[1:58:38] abounding person those who are giving
[1:58:40] Jesus Christ more of their time more of
[1:58:44] their attention more of their service
[1:58:46] how many believe that habits are spirit
[1:58:50] so we just got in a bad habit of doing
[1:58:51] this you see what happened for whom a
[1:58:55] man is overcome of the same he's brought
[1:58:57] in bondage some temptation over Cain you
[1:59:00] so now you're a slave to that spirit
[1:59:05] that's true whoever overcome whatever
[1:59:08] whatever robs you from this fellowship
[1:59:11] with God that you used to have now your
[1:59:13] slave to that spirit and like I said
[1:59:22] I've seen pastors and congregations weep
[1:59:24] over this thought weep but crying is not
[1:59:29] enough gotta be cut off the home life
[1:59:34] has to change does every understand the
[1:59:38] home life has to change but llores if
[1:59:41] you'll come here let's close here I hope
[1:59:46] everybody can see this is not my thought
[1:59:48] this is the Word of God and I believe
[1:59:51] that's another fresh revelation I
[1:59:52] believe it's a revelation that just
[1:59:54] struck me yesterday as I'm studying the
[1:59:56] last works you're the end of your life
[1:59:58] should be more dedicated than the
[1:59:59] beginning of your life that's the secret
[2:00:02] to being overcoming Christian that's to
[2:00:07] me that's a
[2:00:08] it's a thus saith the Lord so I know any
[2:00:11] time someone tries to talk me out of
[2:00:13] doing more for God I know I can look the
[2:00:15] devil in the face and say say and get
[2:00:17] behind me
[2:00:17] God has spoken to me in his tabernacle I
[2:00:20] had fellowship with God at church one
[2:00:22] night and I know I'm not to compromise
[2:00:25] on the Lord I'm gonna give Christ all of
[2:00:27] my time I'm a servant of Jesus Christ
[2:00:30] I'm a prisoner of Christ I don't want to
[2:00:33] be prisoners again that's just by our
[2:00:36] heads here
[2:00:39] I'm opening the altar if anyone's come
[2:00:42] up and pray you're more than welcome to
[2:00:43] come pray I believe that I believe that
[2:00:48] this message has the power to change
[2:00:50] people's lives and what's called renew
[2:00:54] them because I think all of us would say
[2:00:57] we've come to church and we've enjoyed
[2:00:58] the the light of the church ages and the
[2:01:00] bread but sometimes it tastes stale and
[2:01:02] that's not God's fault that's a that's a
[2:01:05] delusion that's a deception God always
[2:01:06] has fresh bread if we're not happy with
[2:01:10] our fellowship with God it's not God's
[2:01:12] fault
[2:01:15] it's our fault
[2:01:17] we've got to cut something off from our
[2:01:19] lives there's some parasite attached to
[2:01:23] our lives it's sucking our life away and
[2:01:27] we're not as strong as we used to be so
[2:01:29] I'm going to open the altar here to have
[2:01:31] a word of Prayer Heavenly Father I thank
[2:01:34] you Lord for this message
[2:01:35] I flew hundreds of miles to Iowa then I
[2:01:48] drove a thousand miles to North Carolina
[2:01:52] and I seen this same message produce a
[2:01:54] real response Lord
[2:01:56] I just felt burdened one more time to
[2:01:59] try to preach it to our church Lord to
[2:02:01] help anyone that needs help in this area
[2:02:06] in orders I gave that invitation on the
[2:02:08] paper I believe that with all my heart
[2:02:11] I believe we should all be more
[2:02:17] dedicated and disciplined true
[2:02:20] discipline is beating your body in this
[2:02:22] objection and increasing your service to
[2:02:25] Jesus Christ not decreasing increasing
[2:02:29] [Music]
[2:02:31] Lord I stand upon this word you said I
[2:02:35] must study myself approved that I would
[2:02:38] not be ashamed of what I preach I have
[2:02:40] nothing to be ashamed of because I've
[2:02:42] only preach your word and you reveal it
[2:02:45] to me in that room over there lord god
[2:02:47] you're the one you reveal that to me we
[2:02:50] must go back to the first love and then
[2:02:53] let that first love grow and produce
[2:02:54] more and more and more for Jesus Christ
[2:02:59] I'm happy to do it Lord just have mercy
[2:03:01] when I fail just help me to come back
[2:03:03] and get sprinkled at the church Lord get
[2:03:05] sprinkled in my prayer life at home Lord
[2:03:07] just let me come back and be sprinkle
[2:03:09] that I can enter back into the worship
[2:03:10] of the Lord and I can joy the cross
[2:03:13] again I can enjoy the church ages the
[2:03:16] light of the age I can enjoy the
[2:03:19] mysteries of God and I can have a real
[2:03:21] prayer life that brings me into your
[2:03:23] presence so I can hear the say it's
[2:03:25] important thank you Jesus hallelujah you
[2:03:32] said I'll meet with you there between
[2:03:35] the cherubims upon the mercy seat or
[2:03:38] than we know now our heart is the mercy
[2:03:40] seat Lord God we know that meet with us
[2:03:43] Lord upon the tables of our heart Lord
[2:03:45] God speak to us Lord God may church feel
[2:03:49] like thus saith the Lord again and not
[2:03:51] just some tent out in the wilderness
[2:03:54] where there's stale bread or lamps have
[2:03:56] gone out may it feel like communion with
[2:03:58] Christ again Lord it's up to us we're
[2:04:01] the ones that have to come and get
[2:04:04] sprinkled it'll take more than weeping
[2:04:08] Lord in our lives it'll take cutting off
[2:04:11] the influence
[2:04:14] bless us now Lord God I don't know
[2:04:17] what's gonna happen from here on out

[2:04:22] Lord I know you've revealed to me that I
[2:04:25] must increase my service for you that's
[2:04:28] why I'm writing the book
[2:04:30] I'm giving every moment that I possibly
[2:04:34] can to this gospel use me Lord God use
[2:04:39] me as a vessel of righteousness use the
[2:04:42] church Lord God help us to have a burden
[2:04:44] for prayer on Sunday mornings help us
[2:04:47] have a burden for the Word of God
[2:04:49] increase our service that's my prayer
[2:04:50] for 2018 Lord God thank you for your
[2:04:59] love and the Word of God in Jesus

[2:12:31] last night I bought 30 Bibles because
[2:12:35] we're running out of Bibles I'm gonna
[2:12:36] fill up that bookshelf again about 30
[2:12:39] church age books and I bought 45 sermons
[2:12:44] from 1962 and book format I'm gonna try
[2:12:46] to fill up that shelf again by God's
[2:12:48] grace I like how it slowly got emptied
[2:12:50] remember you're welcome to anything on
[2:12:52] that on that shelf out there you're
[2:12:53] welcome to do that and one reason I'm
[2:12:55] buying the church age book is because my
[2:12:56] family we read the Bible all the way
[2:12:58] through we're gonna finish in a couple
[2:13:01] weeks here we're in what is it Hosea
[2:13:04] we're finish up hos s we're on the home
[2:13:06] stretch we ought to read the New
[2:13:07] Testament we're on the home stretch of
[2:13:08] the Old Testament and after that I'm
[2:13:10] gonna take my family through the entire
[2:13:12] church age book we're gonna read the
[2:13:13] whole thing together so I'm inviting all
[2:13:15] the families to do that if you we're
[2:13:16] gonna make that our morning devotion and
[2:13:18] our evening devotion so that's why I'm
[2:13:20] buying extra church age books I would
[2:13:22] encourage you to do that if you don't
