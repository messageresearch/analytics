look at music tonight we'll begin looking at it um so let's go to uh ephesians 5 10 let's go to ephesians 5 10. read our text and then we'll just take a few prayer requests we'll just kind of put those together i was telling amen i'd like to get uh started on this music series before i got a break you know because i don't want to put it off too long i kind of want to just get started on it right now tonight and just be honest i haven't had or haven't made too much time to study into it so i'm just at the beginning of the study and i'll share some resources you know and references and things that i'm studying so you can understand too kind of where i'm coming from but anyways ephesians 5. looking forward to this study it's i believe it's going to be a real blessing um brother ben around he showed it back in 2016. you remember that brother it was over there so i was listening that today what a wonderful message that was boy that was a shout message that was glorious i was like wow the lord has blessed us richly with some wonderful nuggets and just treasures the bible calls them treasures ephesians 5 verse 10 let's read verse 10 together one two three proving what is acceptable unto the lord now this is not in context about music but later on in the chapter it is so go down if you would to verse 18 i'll read 18 and then we'll read 19 together so let me read 18. be not drunk with wine wearing is it is excess but be filled with the spirit now remember we preached on this not long ago with the ephesians series how do you how are you filled with the spirit verse 19 says it let's read it together one two three speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the lord praise god so we see we've got to prove what is what god likes right and everything got to prove what god likes and then you have to walk in the spirit by singing and worshiping and speaking to yourselves and even yourself encouraging yourself in the lord like we saw with david last week so let's have a word of prayer let's remember these needs here mary's travel mary is jose's sister-in-law let's remember cam's travel for this weekend looking forward to having two services brother cam uh sister naomi of course asked us to pray for them throughout the whole trip because on their way back they want a safe trip and they want uh to be covered free and let's remember uh the election as well there's a lot going on there and then the one in georgia let's remember that one as well you know i like i like my parents to be remembered in prayer by god's grace i don't have any updates on them but let's just pray for all these needs can we let's have a word of prayer heavenly father again we come by your throne by your grace thank you for calling us out of egypt lord how we love that song how you fought for israel lord and how you fight for us today lord god it's by your power by your hand lord we've left the world

and also lord the final the finalizing of the results god just let truth prevail god our prayers we pray for our leaders no matter who they are lord and we ask for a peaceable life that we can continue living the gospel lord under peace lord and flourishing lord god and spreading the word as much as possible so father let thy will be done you're the only one lord lord that knows the day or the hour i don't know it so father let us keep working and keep laboring and keep praying for open doors that we might speak your mysteries with the boldness that you'd have us to do it that all might hear that all might receive lord all the predestinated ones until the fullness of the gentiles become in lord god grant it let us keep laboring to the last one comes in and father bless us here tonight take this word that i read i pray lord you'll bless it to our hearts in jesus christ's name and saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated there i do have a few quotes i'd like to share and some slides here so let me switch over by god's grace uh i like to get started on this music series here before uh i get a break um so let's look at this uh tonight by god's grace it's coming up i don't know why it's loaded again but i'd like to look at uh we'll see how long we do this uh but really want to look at music and i've had numerous questions about it over i guess i'd say the last six months or so and we just want to look at it and take a few services on it you know my wife asked me how many i thought well maybe four we'll see how many and let me just be first to say i am no music expert i think everybody knows that here right alki and lydia will tell me we'll tell you a hundred times more than i can tell you about music and they meant probably a thousand more then i could tell you about music as far as uh you know notes and scales and all those words i was listening to brother ben rod's sermon he's saying words i don't even know you know so but anyways i just want to bring out the word and i want to get to the spot where we feel uh content with our music because there's so many questions that come to us you know especially but amen as a song leader and to me the pastor because i'm i'm head over everything the pastor's sovereign over this church just this church no other churches i'm just a sovereign over here just like a shepherd is sovereign over his flock right a husband is sovereign over his wife right you know god has order and so i've got to answer for the music and uh for the amen and but mainly me you know as a pastor and each family's got to answer for what they allow in their homes and and so uh every every preacher every home church has to answer for that so i want to be faithful to the lord and i want to um uh know the truth i know the truth will set me free praise god so let's look here tonight uh like i said the thoughts will probably be all over the place because i just really got deep down studying it this today this morning this afternoon as far as deep really hammered down in there to try to get some thoughts so um we wanted to call this god's acceptable music because we know there's a kind of music that god accepts and then there's a kind of music god does not accept right and i just had a few thoughts open up to my heart but i imagine we'll get to them here as my outline goes on so let's look at god's acceptable music so our text was uh our first one was ephesians 5 10. and it says proving was it what is acceptable unto the lord and that that greek word just means well pleasing so there's music that pleases the holy spirit right uh and and we want to be able to find that right because in this context this scripture wasn't about music but then shortly after it was about music uh and then we know first thessalonians 5 23 right right we probably got that memorized prove all things right hold fast that which is good we probably got that memorized in such a short verse and we ought to because we did the prove all things series okay but i want to just take this approach that the bible says prove all things and in a world where there's so much uh access to music now like new music right we've never had more with spotify and apple music and youtube and just the internet in general we've never had access to so much music before it used to be you had to get on a cd if somebody had to give you a cd or a cassette tape when i was growing up we would burn them on cassette tapes you know i remember recording off the radio i thought that was a big thing to do you know on cassette tape of course it was all evil music sadly but um the point is there's so much music now and uh and it's it's also prophetic as you probably remember you know uh brother man tells us shadrach meshach and abednego we'll preach on this eventually but right before uh their last test was music when the music played they had to bow down to the image right uh and that the music told them when to bow down right so the music leads people into worship either the true worship or the wrong worship well our music is going to lead us into true worship by god's grace it always does amen hallelujah i believe that but we know the world right if that's a type of the end of the gentile dispensation or gentile times of the gentiles gentile church ages then it would be the false music would lead sinners into worshipping a man right because it was worshiping one image an image of a man right but shadrach meshach and abednego said you can do whatever you want to our bodies you can do whatever our you can torture us whatever you want i don't know if god's going to save me i don't have a guarantee i don't have a thus saith the lord on a miracle but one thing's for sure i only worship jesus amen and then jesus come and stood with him in the fire praise god amen proving that if you stand with jesus he'll stand with you amen amen hallelujah so uh it is there is a prophetic element to music and it makes sense because jesus said it's going to be so close it deceived the very elected if it were possible so we know there's never been a time where the music will be as close to being true as this time and so we've got to be able to rightly divide the song okay and the songs and what's what's being said and everything uh and the lyrics and the rhythm and the style now all some of these words i don't even really understand them so i'm just going with what i've been reading and what i've been hearing so just bear with me we'll see how far we can get tonight i want to set my timer here yeah because i want to have enough time here to worship at the end as well worship and praise the lord all right so here's some questions i'm going to answer not today uh but probably in the future so the first one there i wanna these are all come up all these have come up in conversations i've had with preachers or brothers or something like that um so this is one i had with a preacher lately and i love the preacher is it wrong to sing a song if the song doesn't tell the full gospel story so this preacher had an interesting point i never heard it before he said he said like i can only imagine right by mercy me so the preacher was saying it's only about going to heaven so they were saying there's nothing about you know getting saved repenting getting baptized filled with the holy spirit now my first thought is no my first thought is i think it's okay just to have one song or a song just about going to heaven right that's just my that's my thought right now to me i've always liked that song now i don't like the version mercy me does because they crank it up and some of the versions have electric guitar and it sounds like rock and roll but i like how we sing it right because we take out all the worldliness right and that's that's part of this proving what's acceptable to god now some people amen may totally disagree with me on that and that's okay i can love them back but i don't i don't see i believe we have the liberty of the holy spirit to look at a song and if it's scriptural we can apply we can sing it and we can appreciate what it says and if if if you know worldly christians make it rock and roll i believe we have the wisdom and the ability and the right to take out the worldliness and sing it the way it should have been inspired at the at the beginning praise god right because if the lyrics are good if the lyrics are godly then the inspiration behind it was right but what they do they mixed a little rock and roll in there the wrong inspiration praise god right so see we gotta it's just like david david had the right leading to bring the ark back right with dancing and worshiping but he got off the word a little bit right he put it on the car he put it on the cart of the ox rather than on the shoulders of levites so church many times people get i believe that's an inspired song i love that song i've wept to that song i've i've cried to that song i praise god to that song but uh the reality is is uh the inspiration can come but if if you're not totally faithful with it you'll inject some other false inspiration to it just like a sermon you can get a good servant i could get a good sermon from god but then i can inject some thought in it that's not pleasing to god okay so that's my first thought on that the second one is it wrong just if the song it just has simple repetitive lyrics we'll get more into that i need some more examples of that one okay um so you know it kind of depends on your age right if you're a little child you think jesus loves me this side now or the bible tells me so and you know you kind of keep it like a it's a keep it a simple song right but i think the people are kind of like criticizing like uh you know like a chris tomlin song that maybe would just say something over and over again or a hillsong song where they might repeat something over again um that's something i gotta look into i i don't know too many songs though that are that repetitive so to me that that criticism i don't know if i totally agree with that one all the time um you know i'd have to see some examples of that okay now some people again say you know what's a simple song it just talks about the cross and the blood well what's more important than the cross the blood church what's more important than the cross and who does in this day who doesn't need a good reminder about the cross and the blood praise god amen because the member of the bible said if we don't grow in the statue of perfect man what'd the bible say you'll forget you were forgiven see and we have we have the age of the greatest deception today right so satan's trying to deceive people to get their minds off the cross make them feel they're not saved they're not forgiven that's why i love some of those songs they're refreshing praise god i get to talk about the cross and sing about the blood praise god being forgiven praise god the love ran red i love that song praise god my there's a place where where mercy reigns amen hallelujah and sin is powerless amen i think that's beautiful now are those people's lives right no you know people that write some of these songs these modern songs are their lives right not exactly well let's not judge them and send them to hell just yet right because jesus said however you judge them they'll judge you right jesus will judge you the same way so you've got to be careful third and this is one i might i may i may even get to this tonight i think you'll like it if you haven't heard it uh was the fast song because some people say oh you can't sing a very fast song in the message or well brother branham's saying or brother bran was there and listened to a very fast song called i was there when the spirit came and he called it a nice spiritual lift and i i might have time to play it tonight we'll see we'll see how it goes i may have to get something else here so malachi can you go get my ipad it's in my gray bag here so i i'll need another device to play it okay that's okay i need you to get my ipad because i need the phone to show the slides okay now and fourthly this is something i've just studied a little bit uh brother graham's daughter rebecca branham wrote an article in 1992 about music uh it's been very well received by people i've not read all of it i was skimming through it a little bit when i was studying i didn't get a chance to read all of it um but she seems to say uh is she her point she seems to make at least in one paragraph is in order for the song to be godly it has to be the right rhythm thank you uh the right lyrics and the the person who sings it has to have the right lifestyle now that's where i may disagree a little bit like i said because someone who doesn't serve god faithfully can still get inspiration from god if that's their gift right if their gift is to write songs which thank god for that because the bible said we need new songs amen thank god for that uh but if they get inspiration from a godly song yet they don't live a life does that mean we get rid of the song the inspiration from god i don't believe so i believe we got to take that into consideration you got to look at their lifestyle right um but i don't believe just because someone who was inspired to do something supernatural we can't accept anything they say if they have the wrong lifestyle like brother ram said right you take the uh you don't if you're eating cherry pie and you hit a cherry you don't spit out the pie just spit out the cherry right take what's inspired from that person who wrote it but then you know like the song shout to the lord it was by that uh wonderful i should say wonderful songwriter but she cuts her hair and wears makeup well almost every church sings shout to the lord it's a great song i don't agree with their lifestyle but it's an inspired song praise god it's a beautiful song and so people were doing that in the 90s why can't they do it now you know so it's it's just uh it's strange you know what people why people go so far on some of these things but it's okay we're still gonna love everybody we're gonna stand where we stand we're happy to serve the lord and we want the spirit of god in our church we want music to accomplish everything it should praise god oh there's so much you can do praise god it can teach us it can cast out devils it can deliver us praise god there's so much it can connect us to god amen there's so much music and do we want all the benefits of music praise god amen now here's some of the topics i'm going to teach eventually i'll probably go back and listen to ben narada and some other ones the history of rock and roll we will eventually get to that not tonight how music affects the mind and body bender rod did a nice job on that how it affects your mind and body um and then uh music is the approach to war that's that's that was a very sermon topic of brother ben okay so here's the three references i've i've spent the most time on so far i forgot to put up sister branham on there so let me do that next here in just a minute um so the first one was brother ben that's when i listened to today um replica branham smith and her article was called uh music the sound and unsound 1992 okay so you won't you won't see it now but it'll be on here later okay and then the seven part series i listened to that this week i listened to all that it's only like a couple hours it's not that long um he does a nice job on it there's a few things i disagree with like he seems to be against anything that's a little bit fast but i kind of like fast songs i love him praise god and brother brahm liked him amen he called him a spiritual lift as we'll see and then the 10 part series distraction dilemma i think i shared with brother amen but uh it's been a while since i've watched it it's been a while and that guy's a seventh day adventist he has a lot of good points though i remember watching that that's like a 12 hour series because each part is over an hour and now he does a real thorough job and i like a lot of what he does of course i don't believe in the seventh day like they do the saturday sabbath i don't believe in that but again you just take you spit out the spit out the seeds and just take what's good and then uh sister rebecca branham smith the late rebecca branham uh she wrote that article i'll be studying that as well okay so uh three important truths i just want to look at briefly here tonight uh we have three important duties that i found in regards to music i guess i could put a fourth one got to sing a new song so let me add that one there we go we have to introduce new songs uh so introduce uh new songs okay so uh first prove what pleases god now this includes the lyrics uh the rhythm of the song now you could put in there beat uh style i don't know i don't know all the words i'm not sure how they're different you know i don't know but we'll look at that eventually a second uh another duty is to create the right atmosphere so our music has to create the right atmosphere so in other words when we do song service we should feel people happier right we should feel people being blessed we should hear people shouting clapping saying praise the lord amen i mean we should have that like we should have the songs that produce the right atmosphere how many times have i been tired and i just get out here and hear by the amen sing and i'm all energized again honestly church it literally changes the state of your mind amen it literally refreshes you that's the power of music amen it's supposed to do that that's what brother ben the rod was showing on that sermon you have two parts of your brain one side is think think think the other one is more creative well when you start singing you get away from the think and the worry and the stress and and you get that other side and it refreshes your mind because you stop worrying and thinking all the time you just get focused on the power of god the love of god the mercy of god how great god is amen you just you just get outside of that that thinking and that all that constant thought thought and stress and you and you get into the attitude and the place of worship praise god amen and then thirdly uh identify the meaning of sounds and this is going to probably be the most technical part uh like every sound has a meaning the bible says so we really got to find out what are the sounds in rock music we got to kind of figure out what are the sounds now we can we can tell right now but i don't know how to define it like i can listen to a song and say oh it's got too much irrelevant electric guitar but then you can have a song that has a nice electric guitar right uh so we got to be able to def define the meaning of the sounds right we got to say well that's too much here that's well that beats too heavy or that that percussion is too too much you know you got to we got to be able to identify the sounds praise god and fourth is introduce new sounds or not sorry new songs but i don't have that on here the bible says sing to the lord a new song all right so let's look at a few scriptures here uh by god's grace i'm going to type in real quick new song okay there's nine of them all right okay so so the first one we have can prove it pleases god we read this in our text now the context is we are children of light and we're no longer in darkness so because we're in the light we can prove what something is because we can see it right you were sometimes darkness but now you are light amen not only do i have the light but i am the light praise god hallelujah we speak the light we are we're a city on a hill a light that cannot be hidden praise god uh we walk as children of light for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth proving what is acceptable unto the lord and have no fellowship in other words don't partake with the unfruitful works of darkness in this case with rock music rap and now the reason i'm not going to bring up rap very much is because we don't get in the rap right we we're not going to battle rap right you know we're not going to a lot of church at least you know uh we're not going to battle country music at church right the one right we're after that we i'll have to watch out myself is just the rock we got to watch out for the rock because that was the vision brother graham saul too remember that church the vision he saw uh of the preview of the bride the american bride was dancing to rock and roll and then he had to cry out and then when the true bride came some of them got online he said get back in line so i don't know if it was music inspired off to look at the vision again but remember rock and roll was what satan was going to use through albus presley brother abraham said to bring rock and roll to the church and my mom is a witness she's lived to see it sadly she said now they never had it before in the 1950s 60s 70s and now her denomination they go they do hip hop rap and jazz everything at their denominational youth group so my mom is a witness when i told her i said mom uh i said brother ram had a vision that the church was dancing to rock and roll i said you better get out of that denomination and she said my denomination's going down the tubes she said so she can recognize it okay but we can't be a partaker uh with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them so we are supposed to correct the children of darkness now the best we can right and the best way to do it is not preach him a sermon but live him a sermon praise god and if you get a chance to preach it then preach it to him or testify to him sisters right if you get a chance but you might not so you have to let your life speak so loudly that they can't even hear what you're saying because you're living such a holy life praise god amen i found that the longer i've gone on the fewer people want to talk about the lord it's harder harder and harder when to talk about the lord and now with the six feet of distance and everybody's staying home there's even less people out there you even have less people around so we got to use some more digital right we got to use the digital and youtube and our texting we got to we got to do that more by god's grace okay so we can prove what pleases god now next uh the bible said uh the right music brings the right spirit so the bible says if you want to be filled to the spirit or fill with the spirit rather speak to yourselves i have to look up this word i didn't look it up yet but speak to yourselves i don't know if that means speak to yourself like encourage yourself or if it means like tell brother am or tell amen or tell you need to tell your brother a good song in the lord i'm not sure which one it means imagine maybe both right because you got to create an atmosphere in your life and you got to right you got to break out of your mind battles right and you do that many ways by singing praise god because singing is an invitation channel that's the power of music it is an invitation to open yourself up to god or the devil amen that that's what i've realized when we sing and when we get into worship it's opening up it's opening a space it's opening our minds and it's opening a space in our church for the holy spirit to come down and dwell amen you don't believe that go to psalm 22. hopefully everybody believes that i guess i'm preaching to the people on the livestream here on that point psalm 22 1 let's believe that with all of our hearts praise god singing is your it's your chance to open yourself up to god satan uses it of course for his tactics but it's it's your channel so when you start singing anything gotta be careful what we sing we're opening ourselves up all right now this is interesting verse one is uh jesus's prayer on the cross david wrote that a thousand years before christ uh go down to verse two oh my god i cry in the daytime but thou hearst not and in the night season and am not silent but thou art holy oh thou that inhabitest the praises of his people our fathers trusted in thee they trusted and thou didst deliver them they cried unto thee and were delivered they trusted in thee and were not confounded so see he inhabits he lives in praises so when we start singing god is using amen to get trying to get us to open up a door right open up a door and say jesus come and dwell in my mind come fill my mind right now so i can forget about the things of the world i want you to inhabit my mind praise god amen i want you to dwell in my thoughts i want you to take all control of my mind so that once once brother amen gets in the spirit week in the spirit then when the preaching comes i can receive that too praise god amen right but many people don't receive the preaching because they don't get in the song service right and their mind just is not ready they're still stressed out about this and planning that for tomorrow and upset about what happened earlier but when we sing we we allow the holy spirit to come and we cast down anything that exalts itself against the word of god you open yourself up to the holy spirit and now god is anointing your mind amen and the peace that passes all understanding lives in your mind it reigns in your mind and your mind is free now to receive the word of god see it inhabits it lives in your songs god anoints he comes and lives in the space or the room of your mind praise god now go back to ephesians 4. remember we read this one on sunday night right about the mind battles but just to kind of prove it again ephesians 4. it was 23 no i'm sorry it was 27. that's what i read last time ephesians 4 27 neither give place to the devil right so it's about a place it's about inhabiting it's about territory right demons like territory both physical and spiritual right they like to take somebody's mind first and then when they get all these people the same mindset they like to put them in one physical location right we can all think of like gang places like chicago right or new york city where there's a high concentration of gangs how did they get there well because satan first got there uh first got their minds he got real estate in their minds and then people of of like thoughts right go to the same places right that's how it is in anything and then they kind of live in those same places or rich people that are stuck up and prideful the same thing praise god right they got all this money and they wasted on this uh mansions and cars and boats and everything like that it's all selfish it's the same thing right and they all live in the same area because demons like to be together ah so see when people take satan's thoughts and any lie they're giving their mind or their real estate to the devil but we've got to open up and let god come in clean out our houses right clean out of anything that doesn't please god and bring and then preaching all these spoils all he'll bring in all these blessings amen so bringing all this love and joy and peace and mercy and all these things all the character of god all the spoils of god he'll bring it into our room praise god that's right so see singing is uh the invitation uh channel of the human spirit that's how you invite god to come and anoint you is through singing because he inhabits the praises of his people praise god so next time we're feeling outside the holy spirit we need to invite the holy spirit to come in through a nice song amen all right now uh before i get too far here let's see what the next one is okay all right now here's the wrong music brings the wrong spirit remember this after moses was gone 40 days and he brought down the tables and god said god said they've already broken those he threw down the tables when joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted he said to moses there's a noise of war in the camp and he said it is not the voice of them that shout for mastery neither is the voice of them that cry for being overcome but the noise of them that sing do i hear so it sounded like a battle and what they were doing they were worshiping their idol they were giving the praise to the idol that should have got to god right and they heard it like it's some loud battle like they'd won a battle right and not only that but the bible said when he came nigh he saw the image and they were dancing so it was like a victory dance right they were doing a victory dance and it was for it was the wrong spirit right it was for a demon right and the bible said moses anger wax hot and he cast the tables out of the hands and break them beneath the mount now god wants us to be victors right god wants us to win battles praise god right but in this case it was the wrong kind of music right and then the wrong spirit would it produce idolatry so see the right spirit will produce true worship the wrong spirit will produce idolatry so especially as a leader as a pastor and a song leader we've got to really keep our lives free from idolatry keep our lives free from sin confess anything because we will influence the rest of the congregation right so you got to be very careful got to be very careful how we live our lives and of course the holy spirit will help us right we know that so we don't get all scared but we just the bible said you got to watch watch him pray right guard yourself right guard your heart always have a guard always have protection praise god and that's prayer amen we'll get to that lord really next time the bible said keep the holy spirit will keep your hearts and minds that word keep means guard in philippians 4. the giving of thanks and praising god that will keep that will guard your heart so giving thanks and praying that is setting up a guard to protect you if we know if we're not praying enough that we're not guarded we're going to be attacked and we're not going to be able to defeat the enemy so we got to keep praying amen amen guard our hearts and lives so if someone feels like they're getting slain or beat up by the devils because they're not guarded right they let their guard down the word prayer fellowship with god amen amen hallelujah praise god so see a battle so a victory dance but it was the wrong spirit right because you could see the idolatry going on all right now third every sound has a meaning now this is beautiful uh now i got this from that dr frank good good good preacher now therefore if i come unto you speaking with tongues what shall i profit you except i shall speak to you either by revelation or knowledge or by pray prophesying or by doctrine now this isn't dealing with music right it's dealing with tongues because this is the tongues chapter if you know anything about corinthians and even things without life giving sound whether pipe or harp except they give a distinction in the sounds how shall be known what is piped or harped right so there ha each sound has to have a meaning for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle so in other words you got to be trained on certain sounds right so you have to know you have to know the sound for battle like if you're in the military the revelry right you got a taps you got no taps it's bedtime song lunch is lunch ravelry is that is i'm not sure malcolm you know his revelry the lunch or the morning call i'm not sure if he's read that one yet my friends and i my friend's a marine at school and i talk to him sometimes about it i just can't remember which one so there's a certain there's a trumpet for breakfast there's a trumpet for waking up there's a trumpet for bedtime and each one has a certain sound right each one has a meaning so likewise except the utter by the tongue words easy to be understood how shall be known what is spoken for ye shall speak in the air so see we've got to make all sounds easy to understand okay so we want our music easily to be understood what what it's preparing us for right amen praise god next uh the next verse there are it may be so many kinds of voices in the world and none of them is without signification so every voice has a certain uh meaning to it right therefore if i know not the meaning now that's dunamis or power or influence of the voice right i shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me so you must know the meaning of the sounds and this is where it's going to be helpful with rock and roll for us we've got to find the meanings of the sounds so we've got to be able to have fast music but not sound like rock and roll right we've got to be able to clap and stomp and dance and praise the lord but not do rock and roll right because the bible says they dance with tambourines on the red seashore praise god they dance they had victory dances in the bible right did you still do them today at times when they have victories or celebrations right and brother brahma's we'll play that one a little bit a really fast song the one time brother bram danced in the spirit he said they were they were uh it was a new year's eve service there was going to be a meeting in the air the sweet sweep by and by he said the sister had a thimble and a washboard it was scratching it back and forth there's going to be a meeting in the air and brother started dancing in the spirit that was a fast song for praise god so there's got to be a way to do it but not interject an evil sound right now we know god is the author of music here i'm just going to go over a few scriptures i love this scripture the lord thy god is in the midst of thee is mighty he will save he'll rejoice over thee with joy so see god is happy too when you get saved now he already knew you were going to get saved right but the bible says he rejoices right just so not only do the angels rejoice jesus rejoices amen he said he will rest in his love he will joy over thee with singing hallelujah praise god so they give this uh they give this personification i think is the word right where got course he is a person but he's an invisible person but god rejoices and sings over us he loves us amen god sings jesus sang too he's saying right before his death we know that the bible said he said i will not drink henceforth of the fruit of the vine until the day when i drink it new with you in my father's kingdom and when they had sung to him they went out into the mount of olives now some there's a preacher that framed preacher dr frank he says he he knows which hymns they sang because there were certain hymns that were tied to the passover and they would always sing them before during and after the the meal so he says he has a pretty good idea which one's on so i know they're in the psalms they're in the psalms so i may preach that later on but we probably know some of the songs jesus sang and jesus sang songs praise god angels sing songs uh he said god asked joe where were you when i laid the foundation of the earth declare if i was understanding when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of god shouted for joy now remember sons are angels now morning stars are angels too right morning stars because satan was like a morning star okay now it's a different greek word so it's a different hebrew word so these are speaking of angels but also the bible says all creation glorifies and sings to god right all creations the mountains sing and the waves roar and and because uh their noise is uh every noise is a vibration right that's what a song is a vibration right it's a vibration so everything uh that god created has a vibration for it so not only do the angels sing but all of creation sings amen brother ram said that's why you never see a bird with a heart a trouble because they're always singing all the time they're doing what they were made to do praise god right what do you say which bird the not the mock converter he said one of the birds the robin or whatever they sing all the time so they never have blood pressure right they never have stress they don't have to take a stress pill they don't have heart attacks because they're constantly singing all the time and the same thing's true for us praise god amen if we'll cast down stress if we'll cast down temptations if we'll cast down anxiety the bible said he that a merry heart maketh good medicine praise god he'll heal us if we just stay happy stay rejoicing and let the holy spirit clean out our minds through the song music song service hallelujah bye it's even angels sing remember angels are called angels are called sons in job 1 6. the sons of god came to present themselves satan came with them right so that's just a little that's a mystery unlocked in the bible there now you know satan's the perverter of music uh let me yeah i better find a place to close here now satan was in the garden of god remember he's covered with all these beautiful stones but his workmanship or his occupation or business was of the tambourine and of the pipes and that means a grove socket or whole which is a strange hebrew word was prepared in thee in the day when thou was created now remember there's nothing wrong with a tambourine because miriam used a tambourine so satan was he had built in some type of tambourine work he was doing or maybe he was playing some tambourine he was keeping the beat right and like i like i like what brother ben said he said some people say satan was a song leader brother ben said he's more than that that's true he was more than that because he was the anointed cherub that covereth he was far he was he was great he was really close to god he was right there i believe it was michael and lucifer that's what i believe those archangels i believe i believe we can prove that by the scripture so uh this scripture kind of and now this is our assurance so see satan at times he makes his style very close to the true style remember because those spirits will be so close it would deceive the very elect if it were possible okay so be very careful some people are deceived in the wrong type of music right but it's so close sometimes and that's what i found too is some of the songs it's so hard to tell man is this right but the bible said we got to make it certain so if so if it's if it's even close if it's a little too fast then we just got to slow it down right like if it's i don't know all the details yeah you know but i can't tell you all the details but i'm just saying if it if it sounds like it's it's rock and roll then we gotta take out whatever it is if it's got good lyrics maybe and then still sing it for the lord maybe by god's grace if we feel led to the lord okay so it's all about following the leadership of the lord here and then remember the spirit of god he promised church he'll not forsake us he'll not leave us out there too long if we make a mistake with a song he won't leave us out there if we're in touch with him he'll guide us into all truth praise god especially if we're daily praying god purged me of anything wrong purge me of any evil i want to obey you in everything i will live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god don't you think god will grant it to us praise god amen i believe that now get your bibles go to psalm 33 verse 3 i don't have the slides so i'm sorry uh just get your bible there psalms uh 30. i just want to lay this in our our fourth duty is to introduce new songs and i love when you do it brother amen so keep it up buddy i love it my friend i love that because i guess beforehand i was i was a song leader and i didn't really introduce many many new songs because i was just i was all i could think about was the preaching the preaching the preaching so i appreciate you being fully dedicated to that psalms 33 verse 3. uh you know there's some that's just so many good scriptures i i can only scratch the surface let's just do verse one rejoice in the lord oh you righteous for praise is calmly for the upright that means beautiful okay so that's how we should feel in song service oh that was a beautiful song service and every week i try to tell brother amen how much i appreciate the song service because it is it is beautiful the bible said praise is beautiful for the upright amen see if your heart's upright you'll enjoy worshiping god amen it will be a beautiful song service if your heart is right with god right the song leader the preacher everybody's heart our hearts got to be right with god praise the lord with harp sing unto him with the sultry of an instrument of ten strings so like a harp loot guitar yeah guitars in there even in the hebrew there it is with 10 strings sing unto him a new song play skillfully with only quiet music loud there's times it's quiet right when we're searching our souls right and we want to be able to think that's why brother bran would many times when the angel overcome he would say play it soft but then after everybody's all clear let's worship let's praise god let's glorify his name amen but if we're trying to search our hearts and our minds we don't want it too loud right because it just our minds can't really focus verse 4 for the word of the lord is right and all his works are done in truth praise god so see we have so many beautiful scriptures there's such a liberty saints in in in worship there's such a liberty in doing it in fact let me read these last quotes i'm going to skip i'm going to skip ahead i'm going to close with this i just want brother amen if i haven't preached forgive me uh it's been years i probably haven't preached them since you know you've been song leading so forgive me i just want to do these quotes here real quick so yeah let's let's just close with these uh quotes here now brother i was talking about the new wine now i'm going to skip i'll i'll preach these full i'll read these fully later i'm just going to skip to the main part but i'm talking about how the holy ghost when you get it it'll come by the word but then the holy spirit himself comes you hear the word but then the presence of god has to come upon you right that's what he's talking about in other words you you feel god you feel the joy you feel the anointing right that's what he's talking about so the man said i know there's a lot of fanaticism and people carrying on i know sometimes they do it when the music's jumping up and down and everything and i know that goes and i believe that too so brother man believed in jumping up and down but the man believed in praising the lord amen he said i've seen people in the day when as as long as the music's playing everybody was jumping and screaming but when the music stopped they stopped see i believe well that's still all right as far as i'm concerned as long as the people lives right so he's given a little criticism he says some people can only rejoice when the music's on see we need to rejoice while the preaching preaching's going on too praise god i do it all the time right because i can feel the joy of god right i'm just a happy person many times right but i feel the love of god i feel the happiness the joy of the holy spirit but he says he says he's a little critical of that some people only get excited with the music but we should also get them excited just with the word but now you start bringing the word that's the thing that actually brings life is the word that brings the joy of stimulation new wine and that's what it was on pentecost when the word was vindicated but i just want you to see even if people just get excited with music that's okay as long as they live right right but we know if you get the holy ghost and you're born again you're going to get excited about music a lot of times praise god amen because it's you inviting god to have his place in your mind it's god taking over your mind amen and your body that's why they said they're drunk because the holy ghost had taken over their mind and their body praise god all right now i'm just going to skip some of this here see so abraham believed god it was imputed on him for righteousness but god given the sign of circumcision as a confirmation he accepted his fate so that's the same thing we must do we must wait on the holy spirit until it's done something right we can speak the word and pray and sing all we want but the holy spirit eventually has to come and do something to you praise god all right you got to receive a blessing you got to reach you got to feel him praise god you got to you got to be inspired by him not necessarily because we spoke in tongues not because we danced or got emotional we shouted but until we're changed until something actually happened i don't care what form it comes in just so it happened that's the main thing so the form of the holy ghost coming on you might be speaking in tongues it might be dancing it might be emotional that's that gets me all the time i start crying just because i feel his presence i just uh i just get emotional right sometimes i'll dance he said i always shout mercy i'm always shouting in the church see don't care what form it comes in as long as it happens as long as something happens so you got to respond to it right now um i'm not going to play that tonight but let's close with this brother and said do you love it this at the end of a sermon first the thirst message okay i love this message he said now i wonder if you got your feet converted you don't dance anymore out there for the world he said let's pat our feet to the lord to the lord so then he get you could we'll play it next time or where like next wednesday maybe he he said let's clap and let's stomp our feet for the lord lord said is your hands converted you don't steal anymore he said are your lips converted you don't lie anymore just don't get religion in your head get it all over you remember i'm saying get it in your hands get religion in your hands get religion in your feet get religion all over you praise god just get religion so it's just covering over you so you can praise god you're so surrendered that your whole body can glorify god amen amen is to get your religion all over your body praise the lord he said that's it it takes the whole man that's right now let's pat our feet he says they said do you believe he's the light of the world all right paul he said paul said when i sing i'll sing in the spirit if i worship i worship in the spirit whatever you do do it all in the spirit and the spirit brings the word to life amen all right i'll stop right there so musicians if you'll come i didn't get half where i wanted to go but uh i just want to get started tonight by god's grace that worked out good that worked out good by god's grace now there's just so you know there's nine verses that talk about a new song nine there are uh six in psalms one in isaiah and then two in the new testament praise god good timing by god's grace yeah the one in the new testament is revelation where they sing a new song to jesus when he takes the book hallelujah and then they saw and then uh the 144 000 in revelation 14 the the israelites get the holy ghost the bible said they sing a new song before the throne a new song because something great has happened this the the the remnant got the holy ghost they got a holy ghost baptism 144 000 and heaven sings a new song around the throne of god oh my hallelujah thank the lord let's bow our heads here let's ask the lord to uh help us here going forward for us church you know really we just want to we want to make our mind an invitation right we want to give an invitation to say jesus fill my mind as we sing help me to cast off any thoughts any battles any mind battles any evil feelings clean out my mind i'm inviting you now to clean out my mind and take preeminence let's pray for that by god's grace if there's any you know if there's any rock and roll in our church i'm not aware of it i don't believe there is but it's something we got to watch out for there's people that write new songs often add
