[36:22] let's take our Bibles here as we stand
[36:23] tonight let's go to Revelation chapter
[36:24] 22 by God's grace we'd like to continue
[36:27] on the revelation series tonight
[36:33] revelation 22 verse 1
[36:56] revelation 22 1 prairies God I was
[37:05] preparing I was look
[37:06] my notes and I was like why I could move
[37:09] on but I just feel led to continue these
[37:11] thoughts here looking at the final
[37:14] chapter of the Bible praise God final
[37:17] chapter of the Bible
[37:20] think about what words as we looked at
[37:22] last son or last Wednesday night what
[37:24] words would you leave if you had a
[37:26] choice about your last words and this is
[37:29] what the Holy Spirit left us with praise
[37:32] God
[37:34] so revelation 22 verse 1 and he showed
[37:37] me a pure river of water of life clear
[37:39] as crystal proceeding out of the throne
[37:42] of God and of the lamb in the midst of
[37:46] the street of it and on either side of
[37:48] the river was there the tree of life
[37:51] which bare twelve manner of fruits and
[37:55] yielded her fruit every month and the
[37:58] leaves of the trees tree were for the
[38:01] healing of the nation now notice it
[38:03] always says one tree doesn't say
[38:05] multiple trees it says one tree verse
[38:13] three and there shall be no curse no
[38:16] more curse rather but the throne of God
[38:18] and of the lamb shall be in it and his
[38:21] servants shall serve him a lot of people
[38:27] we'll look at this a little bit tonight
[38:28] a lot of people say what will we do for
[38:29] all eternity brother Jess
[38:31] well here's part of it we're gonna serve
[38:33] Him praise God if we're gonna serve him
[38:36] and he must have things he wants done
[38:39] praise God he wants us to find our job
[38:43] and do our job and he's gonna pack I was
[38:46] are you gonna give us orders that he
[38:47] wants us to pack out praise God I'll say
[38:50] like this we'll be happy to serve Him
[38:52] over there because we're serving him
[38:54] right here praise God
[38:55] let's read verse four together if we can
[38:57] let's blow up first for there
[38:59] okay so let's read that together on
[39:01] three one two three and they shall see
[39:05] his face and his name shall be in their
[39:09] foreheads let's have a word of Prayer
[39:10] here as we bow our heads here you
[39:14] haven't eaten your heart just making
[39:15] known unto God
[39:15] we know he's faithful he's merciful he
[39:18] visits on Sunday morning just like he
[39:20] knows
[39:20] on Wednesday night praise God because
[39:22] he's with us he never leaves us nor
[39:24] forsakes us Heavenly Father we love you
[39:27] tonight Lord it's a privilege to be in
[39:28] your house it's better to be in this
[39:30] Court than a thousand elsewhere Lord God
[39:33] this day Lord were so happy Lord and we
[39:36] thank you and give you praise transform
[39:38] our our minds Lord transform our
[39:40] thinking by the renewing of the Holy
[39:42] Spirit here tonight let us set our
[39:44] affections on things above Lord we're so
[39:46] blessed to be able to read this book of
[39:48] Revelation father just call them every
[39:50] heart Lord God let us Lord as we say
[39:54] rest our hearts and minds from all the
[39:56] cares of the day and may we care about
[39:58] you here tonight Lord God may we set all
[40:01] of our cares and refocus all of our
[40:03] cares on you may we cast our cares upon
[40:06] you for you care for us and Lord may we
[40:09] look to the things spiritual dear God
[40:11] here tonight we love you Lord take this
[40:13] scripture anoint it to our hearts dear
[40:14] God and father will be happy to receive
[40:17] your word Lord God and serve you as we
[40:20] see Lord we'll be serving you for
[40:22] eternity and Lord it's our pleasure to
[40:24] serve you now in Jesus Christ's name and
[40:26] the church said amen god bless you being
[40:29] seated praise God so I want to continue
[40:37] here tonight and look at this here just
[40:43] pulling up a real quick thought here by
[40:44] God's grace I forgot to look for that
[40:46] one
[40:50] so let's look
[40:52] revelation 22 and I would deal with this
[40:55] a little bit further here by God's grace
[40:57] I like to point out a few things here as
[41:02] we look to this here it's a real
[41:04] blessing this chapter isn't it just to
[41:07] see how God chooses to end this book
[41:11] what a beautiful ending he gives it to
[41:13] us last week and just briefly I'll just
[41:17] remind us of a few things here that we
[41:20] looked at how we're so blessed to be
[41:22] able to hear the word and not just hear
[41:24] it but to keep the Word of God and we
[41:27] saw how this house or this this we'd say
[41:31] house a future home I had a spearmint
[41:33] house we'll only have those that love
[41:38] the Lord they're right because the Bible
[41:40] said those who do not love the Lord let
[41:42] him be cursed
[41:43] there'll be no unbelievers there for
[41:46] they're all curse and they're all done
[41:48] away with in the lake of fire and
[41:50] there'll be no Liars there the Bible
[41:52] specifically calls out that in verse 18
[41:56] and 19 and not to add to or take away to
[41:59] the Word of God and Jesus said come
[42:02] quickly which could mean all so suddenly
[42:05] doesn't have to mean you know quickly
[42:07] but of course in God's eyes you know one
[42:10] day is as a thousand years with men so
[42:13] Jesus's words are true always right when
[42:16] he says quickly he means both timewise
[42:18] and also suddenly because he comes like
[42:21] a thief in the night we saw how it was a
[42:25] unveiling this whole book is an
[42:26] unveiling of God Almighty praise God the
[42:30] unveiling of Jesus Christ no doubt all
[42:33] that he is and all that he his plans and
[42:36] all that he is future plans so all that
[42:38] he was doing he has done and all that he
[42:41] will do its unveiling of all of his
[42:43] plans praise God what a pleasure to know
[42:45] that you're a part of his plans in the
[42:48] Blessed part of his plans praise God
[42:50] amen and he hides it from the wise and
[42:54] prudent reveals it unto babes praise God
[42:57] and then we saw his last words we saw
[42:59] Stephens last words Father forgive them
[43:02] and his last words
[43:05] looking up to heaven and god game of
[43:07] glitz a glimpse of the heavenly throne
[43:09] and his last words were about
[43:12] forgiveness in other words his last
[43:14] words were grace praise God
[43:16] amen God have grace and we know he had
[43:19] to have grace because Paul was standing
[43:21] right there
[43:22] of course he was Saul at the time but
[43:24] God had to have grace because there was
[43:25] a predestinated seed that would believe
[43:28] and that would hear the Word of God amen
[43:31] and Jesus gives those last notable words
[43:34] surely I come quickly praise God amen
[43:38] what a blessing praise the Lord now
[43:40] tonight I want to pick up on some more
[43:43] of these thoughts and pull them up here
[43:45] I want to look at this first thought
[43:51] here how we we're speaking about not
[43:54] adding to or taking away from the words
[43:57] of this book so it's a familiar passage
[44:01] here but revelation 22:18 for I testify
[44:04] on every man that heareth the words of
[44:06] the prophecy of this book If any man
[44:09] shall add unto these words God shall add
[44:11] unto Him the plagues that are written in
[44:14] this book and if any man shall take away
[44:17] from the words of the book of this
[44:19] prophecy God shall take away his part
[44:22] out of the book of life and out of the
[44:26] holy city and from the things which are
[44:30] written in this book this is a course a
[44:35] very stern warning but we learn a good
[44:38] lesson here church that if we want to
[44:41] live eternally with Jesus Christ we
[44:44] learn the lesson that God's book of
[44:47] itself
[44:47] God's Bible is sufficient praise God we
[44:51] don't need anything added to it although
[44:54] like we said the church age book gives
[44:56] us more revelation on it it's
[45:00] necessarily needed for salvation right
[45:03] right the Word of God of itself is
[45:06] sufficient praise God for our earthly
[45:09] journey how many know that that God's
[45:11] Word is your absolute and that's all you
[45:13] need for this earthly journey praise God
[45:15] God gives us additional blessings as we
[45:17] said with the church age book and
[45:19] and the program sermons on paper praise
[45:21] God and I hope my books and as one of
[45:24] those blessings that people get amen
[45:26] but the Bible of itself is sufficient
[45:29] and so nothing should be added to it and
[45:32] then nothing should be taken away from
[45:35] it praise God now I was noticing here
[45:38] that Scofield cites the inspiration of
[45:43] this book he says his little note here
[45:47] on verse 19 If any man shall take away
[45:50] from the words of the book of this
[45:52] prophecy I want to read this to you what
[45:54] Scofield said I like it he said it's the
[45:57] summary is the testimony of the Bible to
[46:00] itself so the Bible acts as a testimony
[46:04] of itself and we realize that because no
[46:08] one Word of God will ever fail right
[46:11] heaven earth shall pass away but my word
[46:14] should never pass away but graham tells
[46:16] us the Bible interprets itself so if
[46:20] someone has a question about a common
[46:22] example as easy as father son Holy Ghost
[46:24] well although answer is not laid out in
[46:26] some other book the answers laid out in
[46:29] acts 2:38 praise God along with Acts
[46:32] chapter 8 in Acts chapter 10 where Peter
[46:34] said baptize them in the name of the
[46:36] Lord and then Acts chapter 19 where Paul
[46:38] buries them in the name of the Lord
[46:40] Jesus praise God and so the Bible
[46:43] doesn't need other books really to
[46:45] interpret itself the Bible interprets
[46:48] itself praise God and Scofield pulls up
[46:52] this thought I like it he said the
[46:54] writers of the Bible
[46:55] affirm where they speak of this subject
[46:58] at all that they speak by direct divine
[47:02] authority they invariably testify that
[47:06] the words and not the ideas nearly are
[47:09] inspired how many believe that that the
[47:12] words not just the ideas but the words
[47:16] are inspired amen that's why we stay
[47:19] with this King James Version praise God
[47:21] remember a few months ago and I was
[47:23] showing how I think it was a Sunday
[47:25] morning I preached on rightly dividing
[47:27] the word of God and I showed you how all
[47:29] these modern versions of the Bible
[47:31] come from different Scrolls right and
[47:35] they all come from different Scrolls but
[47:37] all the King James comes from the Texas
[47:40] Receptus the received text and it's very
[47:43] important that we into that the right
[47:45] that the translators interpret from the
[47:49] right scrolls praise God because the the
[47:53] other scrolls are missing words they're
[47:55] missing
[47:56] you know the second half of mark 16 they
[47:58] leave it out they don't even put it in
[48:00] there they leave out scriptures like
[48:02] first John 5:7 and so when they leave
[48:06] out a word then we know the Bible says
[48:08] they're under the judgment without mercy
[48:10] without repentance without forgiveness
[48:13] if those translators and those writers
[48:15] of the scrolls don't repent then we know
[48:17] that their part will be taken out of the
[48:19] holy city and the book of life hi
[48:23] what a what I what a job but forgive me
[48:28] what a job that would be Church what a
[48:31] job to translate the Word of God but now
[48:36] you say well that's a great and I agree
[48:38] that's a great job but it's a great
[48:40] responsibility to translate it not on
[48:43] paper but in flesh amen
[48:45] in other words you and I have to be the
[48:48] translation of the Bible in flesh amen
[48:52] right because my dad said some people
[48:54] will never go to church but they'll see
[48:56] your life and you are the Bible to them
[48:59] praise God hey man let me turn this
[49:01] silly thing off here I got to put it on
[49:04] airplane mode that's because I'm going
[49:07] in airplane mode right now up to heaven
[49:09] hey Emily place is rather Amen so see
[49:14] it's a this idea where the Bible
[49:17] interprets itself and the words
[49:19] themselves are inspired
[49:21] I'll give me another example but bad boy
[49:24] says the word Trinity is not in the
[49:26] Bible
[49:27] because it wasn't a wasn't a word that
[49:30] God thought was inspired to use for the
[49:33] Godhead
[49:34] amen it wasn't it was coined by
[49:38] Tertullian right Tertullian coined it
[49:41] you know about two hundred years after
[49:43] John now you can balance that out
[49:46] because Road Ram said Trinity means
[49:48] three and one but as long as you say
[49:51] Trinity of manifestations or Trinity of
[49:54] offices you can use it but it's not
[49:56] really an inspired word that we would
[49:58] use right whereas the Bible you know
[50:04] uses the Bible says in Philippians two
[50:06] that he changed his form and brother and
[50:09] said look at that word form he came in
[50:12] the form of a servant Jesus speaking of
[50:14] and program said what's that Greek word
[50:17] and morphe see God chose that word that
[50:21] Jesus had more faith into flesh and that
[50:24] more fame means to change his mask or
[50:27] change his physical appearance that's a
[50:30] word that God chose God didn't choose he
[50:32] he sent the second person down God chose
[50:36] the word that he changed his mask and
[50:38] him he came down himself a head he came
[50:41] down himself
[50:41] hallelujah sees the Bible's inspired and
[50:45] it vindicates itself praise God that's
[50:49] why banan said when the seals were broke
[50:51] to him when he saw the visions he'd
[50:53] spend the rest of the day going back in
[50:56] the concordance and running it down and
[50:58] makes sure the revelations he saw from
[51:00] the Angels lined up with God's Word
[51:02] because Paul said though we are an angel
[51:06] he said it cannot be changed if any
[51:09] change in an angel man let him be cursed
[51:13] he said let every he said try every
[51:16] spirit and make sure we prove all things
[51:19] that everything lines up with the word
[51:21] of God glory
[51:24] thank the Lord so I found that
[51:29] important to make sure that brother Ram
[51:32] when he when he brought the message he
[51:34] didn't have to add anything outside the
[51:36] Bible now he said God could do that if
[51:39] God wanted he could do things outside
[51:40] the Bible he said but it's safer to just
[51:43] stay in the Bible praise God and God
[51:46] will say in the Bible praise the Lord
[51:49] until when brother a we don't need it
[51:51] anymore in the in the millennium where
[51:54] we need to Bible anymore probably not
[51:55] because we have glorified bodies hey
[51:57] then the Bible says death will be
[52:00] swallowed up in the immortal life praise
[52:01] God will have immortal life immortal
[52:05] bodies praise God bodies that cannot
[52:07] make a mistake hallelujah
[52:09] bodies that can't be tempted bodies that
[52:12] can't fall will have such a such a
[52:15] nature about us will be fully partakers
[52:18] of the divine nature praise God amen my
[52:23] glory beautiful God's Word is beautiful
[52:29] hallelujah so we see that God interprets
[52:34] is so weird so what I'm trying to say
[52:36] with this main thought with Revelation
[52:38] is that to interpret the Bible walls you
[52:41] have to do is look other places in the
[52:43] Bible which were familiar with that now
[52:45] I want to read this motor Arabs are not
[52:47] program but Scofield says the most
[52:49] important passage is first Corinthians
[52:51] 2:7 2:15 which he said which you should
[52:56] see so let's read that briefly this go
[52:58] keep your spot there we'll come back to
[53:00] revelation 22 well first Corinthians 2:7
[53:02] 2:15 and I looked at this text I thought
[53:08] this would be a good text to read first
[53:15] Corinthians
[53:16] to seven but we speak the wisdom of God
[53:19] in a mystery even the hidden wisdom
[53:21] which God ordained before the world unto
[53:24] our glory now I used to feel pretty bad
[53:28] when people and newcomers would come to
[53:30] our church and they'll act like they
[53:31] didn't know what I was talking about I
[53:33] used to feel bad but I don't feel bad
[53:35] anymore praise God because the Bible
[53:38] says when we speak God's wisdom it's a
[53:41] mystery to those that don't book that
[53:42] don't understand it that's why I
[53:44] appreciate brother Samuel I was thinking
[53:45] about that you know when we first come
[53:47] into message my wife and I said when we
[53:48] first came he was preaching so high with
[53:50] a lot of things we didn't understand but
[53:54] the Bible truth is this that if you're a
[53:58] child of God you will sense that truth
[54:01] is being preached praise God and if you
[54:04] can't receive the meat then there surely
[54:06] be milk for you as well praise God amen
[54:11] amen praise God so when you're a
[54:14] believer you even if you can't take the
[54:16] meat you want to eat it praise God but
[54:19] it might not be ready for it but see I
[54:23] don't feel bad anymore if people don't
[54:25] understand it will I explain it
[54:27] afterwards of course if they want me to
[54:28] explain it from my Bible I'll be happy
[54:30] to explain it or if they want a deeper
[54:32] Bible study I'll be happy to do that but
[54:35] the reality of it is is that when we
[54:37] speak the Word of God if they're not
[54:39] hungry for the word of God then they
[54:42] won't be able to eat the Word of God if
[54:44] they're not thirsty then they won't want
[54:46] to drink of it praise God it's in a
[54:50] mystery hallelujah because it's hidden
[54:54] wisdom which God ordained before the
[54:57] world unto our glory it's hidden wisdom
[55:01] like people will laugh and the laugh at
[55:05] the women that don't wear makeup anymore
[55:06] right the laugh at the men that won't
[55:09] wear shorts anymore
[55:10] it doesn't watch dirty movies anymore I
[55:12] won't a gamble or cheat or steal anymore
[55:15] but they don't realize that that's the
[55:18] hidden wisdom of God amen
[55:21] and I just don't understand that they
[55:23] they think oh you know who cares it's no
[55:26] big deal
[55:26] cultures change and all these things
[55:29] that's true
[55:30] cultures change but God's heavenly
[55:32] culture will never change amen
[55:34] in other words heaven the will of heaven
[55:36] must come down to earth praise God
[55:40] hallelujah so it's hidden if they really
[55:45] wanted to know they could know but an
[55:48] answer they don't pray enough right they
[55:49] don't see God enough he said they don't
[55:51] dig down in the spirit of Revelation
[55:53] enough verse eight which none of the
[55:56] princes of this world knew for had they
[55:58] known it they would not have crucified
[55:59] the Lord of glory
[56:01] if the if the princes would have known
[56:04] that crucifying Christ would have
[56:06] unleashed a new army of Christians they
[56:09] would not have done it if they knew it
[56:11] would have unleashed the lion of the
[56:13] tribe of Judah praise God the Living
[56:16] Christ upon the earth if they knew that
[56:19] it would have brought a living Savior to
[56:22] send this holy spirit into the hearts of
[56:25] men and the preach righteousness and
[56:27] love righteousness and spread
[56:29] righteousness they would not have done
[56:31] it praise God amen
[56:34] but they didn't know so God hid it and
[56:36] he hid it in one small verse remember
[56:38] when I preached out a few years ago
[56:39] Jesus resurrection was hid in one verse
[56:43] now others other scriptures referenced
[56:46] it right like the rod that got its life
[56:48] back you know in the holiest of holies
[56:50] but that one scripture was in Psalm 16
[56:54] where he said I will not suffer my Holy
[56:57] One to see corruption amen and it was
[57:00] hiding out there brother ray for a
[57:01] thousand years before the resurrection
[57:03] of Jesus Christ and Satan just looked it
[57:06] over in other words of the the Prince of
[57:08] the world just looked it over they
[57:09] thought Oh once we kill him he's dead
[57:11] but they didn't understand the hidden
[57:13] wisdom of God the wisdom of God that
[57:16] though my my son dies as a lamb he whose
[57:19] body won't see corruption because I'm
[57:21] gonna raise it up amen oh my thank the
[57:24] Lord they didn't catch that as smart as
[57:27] they were as great buildings as they had
[57:30] is great money and wealth that they had
[57:32] they couldn't catch the hidden wisdom of
[57:35] God because they weren't interested in
[57:36] it they weren't interested in a
[57:38] righteousness they were selfish and
[57:40] interested in unrighteousness
[57:41] so God hid it from him but
[57:43] to us it's what we speak we speak the
[57:46] wisdom of God in a mystery amen
[57:50] hallelujah so I don't feel bad when
[57:55] people look at me and don't understand
[57:58] what I'm saying I don't feel bad I try
[57:59] to explain it to high heels to a couple
[58:01] gentlemen a few years ago and they just
[58:03] looked at me and said huh and they said
[58:04] when it went on and did something else
[58:06] they don't see that it's right there in
[58:07] Isaiah 3 that they went tinkling as they
[58:10] went and they walked forth with with a
[58:12] stretched out neck and and their
[58:13] tinkling as they go they don't I can't
[58:15] see it why because it's hidden from them
[58:17] because they don't want it so don't feel
[58:20] bad you just give the word and those
[58:23] that want the wisdom of God will receive
[58:25] the wisdom of God now here I better move
[58:27] fast now first night but as is written
[58:30] eye hath not seen ear if not heard
[58:31] neither have entered in the heart of man
[58:32] the things which God hath prepared for
[58:35] them that love him now this is true
[58:36] there are as good there's going to be so
[58:38] many great things in the future but if
[58:42] you look at the next verse this
[58:43] scripture is often taken out of context
[58:45] look at verse 10 but God hath revealed
[58:49] them unto us by his Spirit amen
[58:53] see we often say that in church I say it
[58:57] often - which it's partly true it's true
[58:59] you we can't even understand the things
[59:02] God has prepared for them that love us
[59:04] but the Bible says here he's revealed
[59:07] them to us by the Holy Spirit amen
[59:10] so what is what's one of those
[59:12] revelations the new body praise God a
[59:15] glorified body what's another one of
[59:17] those revelations the Millennium what's
[59:19] another one the future halt Bray's God
[59:22] is there revealed by the Holy Spirit for
[59:25] the spirit searches the deep things
[59:28] I'm sorry searches all things yea the
[59:30] deep things of God so let's keep that up
[59:33] there just for a minute
[59:33] see when message people when we receive
[59:37] the message we're so happy if we really
[59:39] get the holy spirit it won't be
[59:41] satisfied with the surface level
[59:43] understanding of the Bible you'll want
[59:45] to dig deeper in the things of God
[59:47] praise God you want to learn more about
[59:50] the Word of God you want to see the
[59:52] spirit guide you into all truth
[59:58] but it's rare Church it's rare you don't
[1:00:02] find many people that want to get closer
[1:00:04] to God you want to you see a lot of
[1:00:05] people that want to coast with God but
[1:00:08] you can't coast with God you either
[1:00:10] growing closer or you're leaving your
[1:00:12] first love praise God
[1:00:15] so this scripture is often misunderstood
[1:00:18] so the things that God has revealed to
[1:00:21] us are deep things and that's it's what
[1:00:26] is not and entered into the heart of man
[1:00:27] before but now it's entered into our
[1:00:31] hearts praise God
[1:00:33] verse 11 for what man knoweth the things
[1:00:35] of a man save the spirit of Man which is
[1:00:37] in him even so the things of God knoweth
[1:00:39] no man but the Spirit of God now we have
[1:00:43] received not the spirit of the world but
[1:00:45] the Spirit which is of God that we might
[1:00:47] know the things that are freely given to
[1:00:49] us of God praise God not so all these
[1:00:53] things that seven seals the church ages
[1:00:55] future home millennium by the rapture
[1:00:59] the shout voice Trump all these things
[1:01:02] they're freely given to us by the Holy
[1:01:04] Spirit and it's not just it's not just
[1:01:07] knowledge but it's a reality praise God
[1:01:11] you can't know these things as a man you
[1:01:16] got to know them through the Holy Spirit
[1:01:17] praise God they don't enter into the
[1:01:20] heart of just a man who's not born again
[1:01:23] you got to have the the mind of Christ
[1:01:26] amen and they then they enter in and
[1:01:30] they transform your life they transform
[1:01:32] your walk so that you're living prepared
[1:01:36] for that day praise God you're preparing
[1:01:39] for that City amen freely given
[1:01:42] so Church of they're freely given what
[1:01:45] do you got to do just have to ask who
[1:01:48] he's got to come to church he's got to
[1:01:49] go our prayer cause they got I want more
[1:01:51] revelation I want more of the deep
[1:01:53] things of God and he said I'll freely
[1:01:55] give them to you amen
[1:01:58] verse 13 which things also we speak not
[1:02:01] in the words which man's wisdom teaches
[1:02:03] but which the Holy Ghost teacheth
[1:02:05] comparing spiritual things with
[1:02:08] spiritual so not
[1:02:10] carnal things but spiritual things right
[1:02:14] like with the M morph a will go back to
[1:02:16] that example the Godhead you compare a
[1:02:17] spiritual thing with the spiritual thing
[1:02:20] so you have the Godhead you compare that
[1:02:22] with a more faith
[1:02:24] you don't bring something that's not
[1:02:25] spiritual right like a three leaf clover
[1:02:28] you know like that like they do you
[1:02:31] don't bring like an egg that now they
[1:02:32] say that tourneys like an egg you know
[1:02:33] shell and the white stuff and then
[1:02:36] though the yolk three separate things
[1:02:39] you know they try to do it like that but
[1:02:42] the Bible says gotta be spiritual
[1:02:43] lessons with spiritual lessons amen in
[1:02:47] other words scripture upon Scripture
[1:02:49] line upon line here a little there a
[1:02:51] little praise God Isaiah 28 verse 14 but
[1:02:55] the natural man receiveth not the things
[1:02:56] of the Spirit of God for their
[1:02:59] foolishness unto him neither can he know
[1:03:01] them because they are spiritually
[1:03:03] discerned but he that is spiritual
[1:03:07] judgeth all things yet he himself is
[1:03:10] judged of no man for who hath known the
[1:03:13] mind of the Lord that he may instruct
[1:03:14] him but we have the mind of Christ so
[1:03:17] getting back to this thought Scofield
[1:03:19] picked up this thought and he goes to
[1:03:21] show how the Bible interprets itself so
[1:03:26] that's why the Bible ends by saying if
[1:03:28] anybody adds or anybody takes away your
[1:03:31] curse because the Bible of itself is
[1:03:34] sufficient to give you revelation it'll
[1:03:38] take you in the deeper things of God
[1:03:39] amen
[1:03:41] because you compare spiritually compare
[1:03:44] revelation you know with Isaiah or you
[1:03:46] can be compared Jeremiah with Hebrews
[1:03:49] you know you compare those things and
[1:03:52] look at verse 15 again he that spiritual
[1:03:55] judges all things yeah but what about
[1:03:57] Jesus he said judge not lest ye be
[1:03:59] judged so you gotta balance it out and
[1:04:03] what that means is that we don't judge
[1:04:05] and condemn people to hell and we don't
[1:04:07] judge their eternal destination but we
[1:04:10] judge every thought because the Bible
[1:04:12] said try every spirit that's how we
[1:04:15] judge we judge all things because
[1:04:19] remember jesus said if you hate your
[1:04:21] brother without a cause you're guilty of
[1:04:22] murder right
[1:04:25] so that's why we don't judge people's
[1:04:28] final destination right or because we
[1:04:30] don't know unless God would say it you
[1:04:32] know with us saith the Lord which that
[1:04:33] don't happen at all very very much at
[1:04:35] all so he says a spiritual man judges
[1:04:39] all things yet he himself is judged of
[1:04:42] no man that's why we should judge the
[1:04:44] music we listen to we should judge what
[1:04:46] we read praise God we should judge our
[1:04:48] conversations we should judge with that
[1:04:52] person saying to us we should judge the
[1:04:54] text messages we used to judge the
[1:04:56] YouTube videos we should judge what we
[1:04:58] see on Facebook or Instagram
[1:05:00] we're always judging it as saying is
[1:05:02] that right or wrong is that pleasing to
[1:05:04] God or not that's when we know we're
[1:05:06] spiritual you be you'll be surprised how
[1:05:08] how quickly people just accept something
[1:05:11] or laugh at it or joke about it and
[1:05:13] they're being very carnal raise god
[1:05:16] they're not even thinking about what
[1:05:18] they're what they're saying you'd be
[1:05:21] surprised
[1:05:22] so you must judge all things because
[1:05:28] when you judge all things you are judged
[1:05:30] of no man see cuz you're judging
[1:05:33] yourself so see before somebody bring up
[1:05:36] an accusation well brother Jesse you
[1:05:37] should have said that you've already
[1:05:39] confessed and say God forgive me I
[1:05:40] didn't mean to say that because he
[1:05:42] judged it right you judged your own life
[1:05:46] praise God you examine your own life
[1:05:48] making sure you're in the faith
[1:05:49] praise God now let me read this from the
[1:05:55] church age book well Graham said in the
[1:05:57] Ephesus church age and I'm sorry not
[1:06:00] Ephesus yeah what happens to church age
[1:06:03] they had to try the Apostles that said
[1:06:06] they were apostles but were liars and
[1:06:09] wrote and said how did they try them he
[1:06:12] said Galatians 1:8 but though we are an
[1:06:15] angel of heaven preach any other gospel
[1:06:16] unto you than that which we have already
[1:06:18] preached unto you let him be cursed he
[1:06:21] said that was the Apostles who brought
[1:06:23] the original word to the people that
[1:06:25] original word could not change
[1:06:26] not even a dot or dash of it No praise
[1:06:31] God Paul knew it was God who had spoken
[1:06:33] him and said even if I come and try to
[1:06:35] give a second revelation try to
[1:06:37] one little change what I gave originally
[1:06:39] let him be accursed Paul knew the first
[1:06:42] revelation was correct God can't give a
[1:06:44] first revelation and then a second
[1:06:46] revelation if he did he'd be changing
[1:06:48] his mind but he can give a revelation
[1:06:52] and then add to it as he did in the
[1:06:54] Garden of Eden when he promised the seed
[1:06:56] of that woman and then later designated
[1:06:59] that seed had come through Abraham and
[1:07:01] then later said had to come to sit
[1:07:03] through the same bloodlines and David
[1:07:04] it was the same revelation it only gave
[1:07:07] the people more information to help them
[1:07:10] receive and understand it amen
[1:07:13] hallelujah I hope you caught that church
[1:07:16] you we can't change one thing Paul said
[1:07:21] did the book of Revelation change
[1:07:24] anything Paul said no it only added to
[1:07:27] it
[1:07:28] praise God and that's what we see today
[1:07:31] we are not to change anything but if the
[1:07:35] spirit searches deep things it's going
[1:07:37] to give us more information about the
[1:07:39] same revelations we've always believed
[1:07:41] yes and that's why the move in Jefferson
[1:07:46] Bill's wrong because they can't change
[1:07:47] one thing Paul ever said Paul never said
[1:07:51] Timothy sit down and shut up and just
[1:07:53] read my epistles he never said that and
[1:07:56] so when they change the church whether
[1:07:59] they know it or not they're bringing
[1:08:00] themselves under at least a temporary
[1:08:02] curse because to change one word of it
[1:08:06] is to become a temporary curse at least
[1:08:10] and we've got to be careful we've got to
[1:08:12] watch our lives not to change one bit of
[1:08:14] it praise God but I love how he says you
[1:08:20] can give more information on the same
[1:08:23] revelation praise God that's beautiful
[1:08:28] and he said they these Ephesians were
[1:08:30] full of the Holy Ghost by the laying on
[1:08:32] of Paul's hands they lift those false
[1:08:34] apostles in the eye and said you are not
[1:08:37] saying what Paul said you there are you
[1:08:39] are therefore false I like that
[1:08:44] praise God we must always be saying what
[1:08:47] Paul said right brother Adams group
[1:08:50] would look out
[1:08:51] and they'd say we're resting on what
[1:08:53] brother Ram said because brother Ram was
[1:08:55] resting on what Paul said amen
[1:08:59] program said the seven church age
[1:09:02] Messenger will be in the word exactly as
[1:09:04] God gave it to Paul he won't deviate
[1:09:06] from that word for a moment not by one
[1:09:08] iota amen
[1:09:12] so children that's why we got to read
[1:09:14] them New Testament right that's why we
[1:09:16] got to know Paul's gospel Paul's
[1:09:17] epistles if we know them then we will be
[1:09:21] unable to be deceived because Paul said
[1:09:25] if you change anything you're cursed
[1:09:27] right and then the Bible ends by saying
[1:09:31] if you add to the book or take away from
[1:09:33] it you get the plagues or your name out
[1:09:35] of the book and you can't enter the city
[1:09:37] oh how important it is if we want to be
[1:09:40] a part of that city to live by the book
[1:09:42] of that city praise God hallelujah so
[1:09:47] I've been ordered to read that because
[1:09:49] it goes right along with this idea at
[1:09:52] the end of Revelation now let me get the
[1:09:54] revelation 20:2 let's go back there by
[1:09:56] God's grace and since I'm on that
[1:09:59] thought go to revelation 22:16 now in
[1:10:08] revelation 22:16 I've heard now because
[1:10:12] I subscribed to some of the people from
[1:10:13] Jeffersonville they now at least some of
[1:10:17] the followers now attach revelation
[1:10:19] 22:16 to brother Rams ministry just like
[1:10:23] they attached revelation 10 7 Malachi 4
[1:10:27] 5 6 Luke 17:30 one of the men I watch
[1:10:31] he's he goes to Ram tabernacle there he
[1:10:33] now says he says all those scriptures
[1:10:35] and he says revelation 22:16 and the
[1:10:38] reason he says that is because his
[1:10:40] pastor preached that this angel is
[1:10:43] brother Branham and that these churches
[1:10:48] are taped churches because I've heard it
[1:10:52] I have the recording that's what the
[1:10:53] recording says I got it you want to
[1:10:55] listen to it let me know I'll make your
[1:10:56] CD of it so now they say I Jesus have
[1:11:00] sent mine angel brother bran to testify
[1:11:03] unto you these the
[1:11:05] in the churches now this is the angel if
[1:11:08] you read him verse 8 that John fell down
[1:11:11] and was almost worshiping right but he
[1:11:17] says no I know that fellow servant of
[1:11:19] our brethren the prophets and of them
[1:11:22] which keep the sayings of this book
[1:11:23] worship God so now they've added
[1:11:28] something to the message that's the not
[1:11:30] end the message and this angel cannot be
[1:11:35] brother branham for this reason because
[1:11:38] brother Aaron tells us the order of the
[1:11:41] manifestation of us and let me read this
[1:11:44] from who is this Melchizedek program
[1:11:47] said you will never be the word unless
[1:11:49] you were a thought at the beginning that
[1:11:51] proves the predestination of God you
[1:11:54] can't be the word unless you're a
[1:11:55] thought you had to be in the thinking
[1:11:58] but in order to stand temptation you had
[1:12:01] to bypass the theophany you had to come
[1:12:04] down here in flesh to be tempted by sin
[1:12:07] and then if you stand all that the
[1:12:09] father has given me will come to me and
[1:12:11] I'll raise him up at the last day see
[1:12:13] you had to be first how many are
[1:12:15] standing on God's Word tonight you got
[1:12:18] to stand the test you guys and this is
[1:12:20] the test case you leave that up there
[1:12:22] honey yeah this is a test are we going
[1:12:24] to say make this brother random or not
[1:12:28] we've got to stand on with the revealed
[1:12:30] word of this hour because the word
[1:12:32] cannot change one iota as it came to
[1:12:35] Paul so program says you start out as a
[1:12:40] thought or another word as attribute
[1:12:42] then you bypass the theophany so thought
[1:12:44] you skip the theophany you come to flesh
[1:12:49] he said but before
[1:12:51] the foundation world his name is put on
[1:12:53] the Lamb's Book of Life then from that
[1:12:54] he become the word the theophany that
[1:12:57] could appear disappear then he become
[1:12:59] flesh and returned back again resurrect
[1:13:01] the same body in a glorified condition
[1:13:03] but you bypassed that theophany and
[1:13:06] became a flash man to be tempted by sin
[1:13:08] and then if this earthly Tabernacle is
[1:13:11] dissolved you have one already waiting
[1:13:14] we have not yet the bodies praise of the
[1:13:20] heart amen so did you catch it this
[1:13:23] cannot be brother branham because John
[1:13:25] had this vision in 80 90 95 let me know
[1:13:30] that and for John to be able to see
[1:13:34] brother Branham if this was brother Ram
[1:13:35] brother Branham would have already had
[1:13:37] to bend his theophany you catch yet but
[1:13:42] he wasn't yet his theophany he was still
[1:13:44] a thought in the mind of God because the
[1:13:47] orders you go from thought you bypass
[1:13:49] the theophany to flesh then after flesh
[1:13:53] you die you go to theophany and that the
[1:13:55] rapture you go to glorified body
[1:13:57] condition hey man there it is right
[1:14:00] there so the very teaching of the
[1:14:02] Branham Tabernacle goes against what
[1:14:05] brother Ram taught this cannot be
[1:14:08] brother Ram because you can't appear in
[1:14:11] theophany before flesh only Jesus could
[1:14:16] do that
[1:14:17] praise God so this is that brother
[1:14:21] branham now you and I can make as many
[1:14:23] guesses as we want but it can't be
[1:14:25] somebody that lived so that had it live
[1:14:29] yet it had been someone that already
[1:14:31] lived and was now entered in theophany
[1:14:35] Amen I don't hear you praise God because
[1:14:38] we come from thought down to flesh and
[1:14:41] then we go to theophany and come back
[1:14:43] and get the glorified body amen
[1:14:45] i with me so what do we see again now we
[1:14:50] see the same people adding to the
[1:14:52] message that they say they believe or
[1:14:54] they so cherish and they say every word
[1:14:57] is thus saith the Lord
[1:14:58] but yea they transgressed the word
[1:15:03] so don't let that be Church don't let
[1:15:06] that be a confusion program is not that
[1:15:10] angel we don't know who that angel is
[1:15:13] you're welcome to your guests
[1:15:14] just as much as I'm welcome to my guests
[1:15:17] and specifically if you've read the
[1:15:21] church age book by the way you know this
[1:15:23] but have been specifically said he
[1:15:25] didn't agree with the doctrine of the
[1:15:28] pre-existence of souls amen he said
[1:15:32] that's a Mormon doctrine the Mormons
[1:15:35] believe you pre-exists in heaven you're
[1:15:36] just like you know a spiritual body
[1:15:38] theophany in heaven waiting to go down
[1:15:40] to earth
[1:15:41] no but I've said I'm against the
[1:15:44] pre-existence doctrine so now it shows
[1:15:48] what spirits on them they got a false
[1:15:51] prophet spirit on them because a frost
[1:15:53] prophet wrote that doctrine Joseph Smith
[1:15:55] oh my Milan struck me there I'm a better
[1:15:59] way to say that later see they got they
[1:16:03] got the Mormon spirit on them and that's
[1:16:06] the spirit following a false prophet I
[1:16:08] hope you caught that I just said
[1:16:10] something there without saying it oh my
[1:16:14] mercy God have mercy ah
[1:16:17] they picked up a false doctrine and they
[1:16:21] got what's like a pump telling them wind
[1:16:23] and pray render read that Bob was a
[1:16:25] wooden what to listen to it exactly what
[1:16:27] to do they got somebody ordering them
[1:16:29] around what to do church we must try and
[1:16:32] test every spirit and take every
[1:16:34] teaching back to the Word of God if not
[1:16:38] will become like Catholics who become
[1:16:39] like Mormons because it proves right
[1:16:43] there they got a Mormon doctrine they
[1:16:46] have the pre-existence of souls that's
[1:16:48] what that verse is brother Ram pre
[1:16:50] existed before he came down in flesh
[1:16:52] nonsense he didn't believe that and he
[1:16:54] preached it even in the the what was the
[1:16:58] fish see oh yeah he'll because it was
[1:17:00] the souls under the altar amen
[1:17:02] glory he said this vision disproves the
[1:17:08] pre-existence of souls the vision a
[1:17:10] program had praise God
[1:17:11] he said the revelation of this seal of
[1:17:14] efficacy of Prayer
[1:17:16] that those souls are alive amen he says
[1:17:19] not so sleeping it's not pre existence
[1:17:21] of souls praise God those souls are
[1:17:23] alive there under the altar praise God
[1:17:26] crying out how long O Lord this teaching
[1:17:30] was right
[1:17:32] nah that's good praise God
[1:17:35] thank you lord now I want to remind you
[1:17:42] Church that that we have so much thus
[1:17:45] saith the Lord on Revelation brother
[1:17:48] Branham says about Revelation at the end
[1:17:52] of the seventh seal sermon program
[1:17:54] records a special ending and he says the
[1:17:56] visions of the seventh seal which were
[1:17:59] the seven angels visions as well and
[1:18:01] then the visions he received in March of
[1:18:03] 63 ye preached the seals
[1:18:05] he says the visions press + the word +
[1:18:09] the church ages he said plus the other
[1:18:14] one he said it's all he said the
[1:18:16] interpretation thereof is thus saith the
[1:18:18] Lord
[1:18:20] so whether that means Revelation chapter
[1:18:23] one two and three are thus say I'm sorry
[1:18:26] n 6 are thus saith the Lord
[1:18:29] we got the interpretations for those
[1:18:31] chapters Amen everybody says you can't
[1:18:34] understand the seals without
[1:18:37] understanding the church ages first aim
[1:18:39] ahead because you got to go in the order
[1:18:41] to the church ages then the seals then
[1:18:43] the trumpets and the vials amen oh god
[1:18:48] I'm feeling good here tonight praise God
[1:18:50] amen we've got lost saith the Lord
[1:18:54] on Revelation one two three and six and
[1:18:59] maybe probably eight - because that's
[1:19:01] the seventh seal and then
[1:19:08] Church I believe also we have thus saith
[1:19:11] the Lord
[1:19:11] on revelation 13 and 17 because brother
[1:19:15] Ram said thus saith the Lord world rules
[1:19:18] at the end time amen
[1:19:21] and who is that beast out of the sea
[1:19:24] that was rolled and that same beefs got
[1:19:27] new life in the beast out of the land
[1:19:28] which Simon preached on Sunday is the
[1:19:31] United States of America it's the Roman
[1:19:34] Catholic Church in the United States of
[1:19:36] America so we've got thus saith the Lord
[1:19:38] on three four five six at revelation
[1:19:41] seventeen seven chapters we have a
[1:19:44] literal not saith the Lord
[1:19:46] oh we have nothing to fear the cover has
[1:19:50] been taken off how do I say it the
[1:19:55] blankets been taken off the statue
[1:19:57] praise God we see Revelation clearly
[1:20:00] it's been unveiled Amen hallelujah I
[1:20:05] wanted you to see that and that's why
[1:20:10] church brother branham can make that
[1:20:13] statement in 1961 and they asked him our
[1:20:15] Trinitarian save he said yes he said but
[1:20:18] the time has come where the God tell him
[1:20:20] the truth he said trinitarianism is son
[1:20:22] of the devil thus saith the Lord he says
[1:20:27] so now that means that revelation one
[1:20:30] that Jesus can't be a second person he's
[1:20:32] got to be the one person of God Amen cuz
[1:20:36] we got thus saith the Lord amen and it
[1:20:38] lines up with the word and the word
[1:20:41] interprets it praise God so when you
[1:20:44] have the Bible says you have you have
[1:20:46] God sitting on the throne and then the
[1:20:49] sons the son steps forward and takes the
[1:20:51] book out of the hand of him that South
[1:20:53] wrote that doesn't mean a young man
[1:20:56] takes it from an old man it means from
[1:20:58] out of the spiritual out of the osha
[1:21:00] category men out of the pillar of fire i
[1:21:04] that comes forth the Lamb of God the man
[1:21:07] hallelujah
[1:21:09] the further revelation of God it's the
[1:21:11] same person just the visible image of
[1:21:14] God Amen hallelujah of that rainbow
[1:21:17] Rowell Shekinah glory
[1:21:20] that they're eternal oh that miserable
[1:21:23] little Gus out of that sets forth to
[1:21:25] live and he comes and takes the book not
[1:21:28] out of our physical right hand but out
[1:21:31] of the authority the right hand of power
[1:21:33] praise God a man because it's this saith
[1:21:37] the Lord because you never see any other
[1:21:39] picture of two gods and one on this road
[1:21:42] and I know their God standing in front
[1:21:44] of the bow so there's only one throne
[1:21:46] not three through one through because
[1:21:49] the Bible interprets itself amen
[1:21:51] and we've got thus saith the Lord to
[1:21:54] agree with us praise God we don't add to
[1:21:56] the word we don't take it away
[1:21:57] we just believe what it says amen amen
[1:22:02] see that's the glory church I say like
[1:22:06] this that's the security sister Beatrice
[1:22:08] of having thus saith the Lord
[1:22:10] we I can't explain every scripture
[1:22:13] brother I can't do it but I've got the
[1:22:15] assurance and I got the security that
[1:22:17] when that prophet said they'll save the
[1:22:19] Lord it was right amen
[1:22:21] it is going to come to pass you can rest
[1:22:25] your soul on that because he said it
[1:22:27] before and it comes to pass right and so
[1:22:29] if he says it again we know it's arrived
[1:22:32] and we might shake a little bit get
[1:22:33] nervous until we know the answer but we
[1:22:36] just stay with God with all of our
[1:22:38] questions to him and in due season God
[1:22:41] gives the answer amen praise God why cuz
[1:22:47] we got thus saith the Lord on it yeah
[1:22:50] not to worry about that we got I love I
[1:22:53] love the end of the second seal brother
[1:22:55] Branham says he said that's the second
[1:22:57] seal that's interpretation thereof
[1:22:58] everybody gets real quiet and then all
[1:23:00] of a sudden he screams out that's dust
[1:23:02] saith the Lord
[1:23:03] anybody go Saturday rejoicing and
[1:23:06] praising God and he said if all these
[1:23:08] other visions come to pass so is this
[1:23:11] the second seal is dust saith the Lord
[1:23:14] now what kind of preacher you ever heard
[1:23:17] do that I haven't seen a one of them
[1:23:18] praise God
[1:23:19] they haven't men since the days of st.
[1:23:22] Paul st. Paul can write that letter and
[1:23:24] said I write this I speak to you in the
[1:23:27] name of the Lord amen that's what he
[1:23:30] wrote to those tests alone and icons
[1:23:31] amen he said this I speak to you
[1:23:33] by the Word of God he said don't flip
[1:23:36] over your loved ones
[1:23:37] he said because they're not dead he said
[1:23:39] but you'll see the dead in Christ rise
[1:23:41] first amen
[1:23:42] there will come a shout a voice and a
[1:23:44] Trump he said comfort one another with
[1:23:46] these words because I tell you the word
[1:23:49] of the Lord amen hallelujah that's why I
[1:23:56] want to write a book on Revelation and
[1:23:57] then gonna be this one but Lord willing
[1:23:59] will be or whatever that because Church
[1:24:01] if we've got the say delay then surely
[1:24:03] we can piece together the rest of the
[1:24:05] chapters in there if we've got the Holy
[1:24:09] Spirit because it it digs deeper into
[1:24:12] the things of God right we just read it
[1:24:14] tonight the spirit won't shy away but
[1:24:18] the spirit searches the spirit wants you
[1:24:20] to go reading your bible little more
[1:24:22] praise God the spirit wants you to
[1:24:25] search it every time I do that brother
[1:24:27] ray I get a blessing every time I listen
[1:24:29] to another sermon every time I try a
[1:24:31] little bit more to get closer to God
[1:24:33] some will strike me all that's right I
[1:24:35] didn't understand that oh I hear a
[1:24:37] brother preach something I just learned
[1:24:38] from the Lord I thought oh my there's a
[1:24:40] series of second indication he meant
[1:24:42] there's another indication that God is
[1:24:45] getting me into the deep things of God
[1:24:48] into all truth amen
[1:24:50] it was a show he keeps his word he's a
[1:24:53] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:24:56] Him praise God that's the power of thus
[1:24:59] saith the Lord amen
[1:25:01] thank the Lord now let me here try to go
[1:25:07] into some other things here because I
[1:25:10] want to get these thoughts down let me I
[1:25:12] think I can just finish it here tonight
[1:25:15] because there's not these aren't too
[1:25:16] long here I would like to be able to
[1:25:18] finish here okay
[1:25:26] go back to Revelation 20 to look at this
[1:25:27] I saw this little thought I was listen
[1:25:29] to a preacher I thought there's a good
[1:25:30] thought in revelation 22 one two and
[1:25:33] three God is mentioned and the lamb is
[1:25:38] mentioned so where's the holy spirit the
[1:25:43] Holy Spirit is the River of Life
[1:25:49] Jesus said when you get the holy spirit
[1:25:51] it will flow out of you like living
[1:25:53] waters of living to walk life they met
[1:25:57] so here we see at the very height at the
[1:26:01] very top of the pyramid we see God the
[1:26:04] lamb and the water these three bear
[1:26:09] record on earth right right the water
[1:26:10] blood and spirit father word Holy Ghost
[1:26:13] the three bear record and these three
[1:26:16] are one
[1:26:17] ha ha the father is invisible right
[1:26:22] the father is invisible so how is he
[1:26:25] visible through the lamb praise God so
[1:26:31] you have the father they're God's
[1:26:32] invisible you have the lamb which the
[1:26:35] father created the body of the land to
[1:26:37] dwell in then you got the Holy Spirit
[1:26:39] the waters flowing down there you say
[1:26:43] that should have stumble your church no
[1:26:45] on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost
[1:26:47] was in a hundred 20 different
[1:26:49] manifestations does that mean he's 120
[1:26:53] different persons that's what eternity
[1:26:55] Aaron would told you right well well see
[1:27:00] a Jesus baptism the oh there's a voice
[1:27:02] of the Dove and a body so three persons
[1:27:04] nonsense if that's true then the Holy
[1:27:08] Spirit is 120 different persons oh mine
[1:27:12] there's more than that because he was
[1:27:14] speaking the box of the spirit spoke
[1:27:16] they spoke as the Spirit gave them
[1:27:18] utterance amen Mary
[1:27:20] so Peter James and John and man weren't
[1:27:23] speaking their words all right they were
[1:27:25] speaking the spirits words amen
[1:27:27] it was God's voice it was the voice of
[1:27:29] God to those seventeen nations that were
[1:27:32] trying to hear worship and they were
[1:27:34] actually hearing the voice of God in my
[1:27:38] glory so just because it says God lamb
[1:27:44] water doesn't mean they're three it
[1:27:46] means God wants to manifest himself in
[1:27:49] these attributes for eternity because
[1:27:56] God is incomplete unless he manifests
[1:27:58] himself in his three attributes praise
[1:28:02] God
[1:28:03] just like you you're not manifested
[1:28:06] completely unless your body soul and
[1:28:08] spirit yet because God is perfected in
[1:28:11] threes right his design is perfect in
[1:28:14] three parts so we see at the top of the
[1:28:19] pyramid we see the Father Son Holy Ghost
[1:28:23] we see these three and these three are
[1:28:25] one not three one look at these go to
[1:28:34] the last verse revelation 22:20 one key
[1:28:40] point up there acacia thank you hon
[1:28:45] revelation 22:20 one remember what were
[1:28:53] Stephens last words Father forgive them
[1:28:56] was it judgment or grace grace how does
[1:29:00] this book end Church the grace of our
[1:29:03] Lord Jesus Christ be with you all amen
[1:29:08] how does the Old Testament end and he
[1:29:11] shall turn the heart of the father's to
[1:29:13] the children and the hearts of the
[1:29:15] children of their fathers lest I come
[1:29:16] and smite the earth with a curse
[1:29:19] it ends with God sending Elijah or else
[1:29:23] there's going to be a curse right and
[1:29:27] that's the scripture we know is for the
[1:29:30] Gentiles right so the Old Testament ends
[1:29:34] with a warning of a curse I've got to
[1:29:36] send Elijah or also it's going to be a
[1:29:38] curse but the New Testament ends with
[1:29:41] grace amen
[1:29:43] even so he says the grace of our Lord
[1:29:46] Jesus Christ me with you all
[1:29:48] amen you notice that's how Paul ends
[1:29:54] most of his letters he said the grace of
[1:29:56] our Lord Jesus Christ be with you praise
[1:30:00] God
[1:30:00] how many one God's grace with them like
[1:30:04] Stephens last words weren't judgmental
[1:30:05] God slay them send those soup receive
[1:30:07] IPERS to hell wasn't that he said Father
[1:30:10] forgive them they don't know what
[1:30:11] they're doing the same thing Jesus said
[1:30:13] amen grace the Bible said let your words
[1:30:17] be seasoned with grace oh my what lesson
[1:30:22] do we get here let's end everything with
[1:30:24] grace now not giving people a pass for
[1:30:28] sin but interceding for them and asking
[1:30:30] God to help them and help them forgive
[1:30:32] right help them repents they can be
[1:30:34] forgiven but oh it's okay for my dad to
[1:30:37] smoke it's okay for my mom to commit
[1:30:39] adultery no it's not okay but we should
[1:30:42] say God have mercy on them that they can
[1:30:44] repent of that and go to heaven our last
[1:30:48] words should be grace Jesus last words
[1:30:53] we saw were surely I come quickly
[1:30:56] Jesus is begging people to quench that
[1:30:59] holy thirst
[1:31:00] he's preaching to the soul of man and
[1:31:02] he's saying all every soul freely choose
[1:31:05] to come Church do not let anyone beg you
[1:31:09] to come to church do not any let anyone
[1:31:12] persuade you to come to church or
[1:31:13] convince you if you're a real believer
[1:31:16] no one has to beg you to do anything
[1:31:18] because it's the Holy Spirit not begging
[1:31:21] you it's the Holy Spirit guiding you
[1:31:23] praise God it's the Holy Spirit leading
[1:31:26] you praise the Lord amen
[1:31:28] if someone's got to beg you or push you
[1:31:30] that's no better than a lot the Angels
[1:31:32] had to pull him out of Sodom right they
[1:31:35] had to pull them out and say come on
[1:31:37] hurry up it's time to go I don't want
[1:31:39] somebody to pull me to church I almost
[1:31:41] somebody didn't pull me to prayer closet
[1:31:43] I want God to guide me there amen
[1:31:45] I want God to shine the light and guide
[1:31:48] me show me the way and Jesus gets to the
[1:31:51] spot at the end and he says you've heard
[1:31:54] this word and he said anyway
[1:31:57] who wants to come let him come because
[1:31:59] he says surely I come quickly praise God
[1:32:03] he ends this book not by begging but
[1:32:07] just saying come if you want to come and
[1:32:09] be a part of the future home he says
[1:32:12] come because I'm coming quickly you need
[1:32:15] him back anybody
[1:32:16] he said don't add to it don't take it
[1:32:19] away he said I'm coming quickly the
[1:32:22] words this Bible is he said it before
[1:32:24] this Bible interprets itself and Jesus
[1:32:26] said this Bible is enough to be a
[1:32:29] witness either for you or against you
[1:32:31] god help us to be that list will be a
[1:32:33] witness for our lives amen that we heard
[1:32:36] the things that were preaching it and we
[1:32:38] lived it and we made ready for Christ's
[1:32:40] coming
[1:32:42] beautiful beautiful invitation from
[1:32:45] Jesus oh my so what we'll be doing in
[1:32:53] the heaven Church we get some ideas here
[1:32:55] in Revelation 7 you see the Gentile
[1:32:57] bride two times brother Branham calls it
[1:32:59] the bride one time he calls it bruised
[1:33:01] virgin I believe it's the bride because
[1:33:04] he says it in the sense in the future
[1:33:08] home I believe and also the church age
[1:33:09] book revelation 7 you see the Saints now
[1:33:14] the first half is 144,000 but the last
[1:33:17] half verses 9 to 17 is the Gentile bride
[1:33:20] and they're crying with a loud voice
[1:33:23] saying salvation to our God which
[1:33:25] sitteth on the throne revelation 7 10
[1:33:28] and verse 11 and all the Angels stood
[1:33:30] right about the throne and about the
[1:33:32] elders of the four beasts and fell
[1:33:33] before the throne on their faces and
[1:33:35] worship God amen

[1:37:20] heaven we're gonna worship we're gonna
[1:37:21] sing we're gonna meet the saints we're
[1:37:23] gonna ask Jesus questions because he
[1:37:25] said the reward the overcomer is the
[1:37:26] hidden manna and Beau Graham said that's
[1:37:28] asking him questions throughout all
[1:37:29] eternity can you imagine I mean it will
[1:37:32] ask me a question I'll say let me pray
[1:37:34] about it but there oh there but there we
[1:37:40] don't get we're not gonna ask somebody
[1:37:41] and wonder what give me a few minutes so
[1:37:43] I can answer this and wonder I wonder if
[1:37:47] they're giving me you might wonder I'm

[1:37:49] or not or no church with Jesus we're
[1:37:54] gonna ask him and we'll see him and
[1:37:56] we'll know we're getting not just an
[1:37:58] idea we're getting the full revelation
[1:38:00] of God praise God he'll give us that
[1:38:06] hidden manna that we didn't see before
[1:38:10] my goodness
[1:38:13] what else will
[1:38:14] the Bible said will reign over nations
[1:38:16] and have the same Dominion like Adam had
[1:38:20] the Bible said if you rule if you're
[1:38:23] faithful with 10 talents you'll be fate
[1:38:25] you'll rule over 10 cities no no how
[1:38:28] that's going to be well we'll probably
[1:38:30] be live in the city there with Christ
[1:38:32] and maybe we'll take a little chariot
[1:38:33] ride out there maybe just like a body
[1:38:35] change ride like a translation will move
[1:38:38] like a thought you know we'll go out
[1:38:40] there to our constituents and we'll tell
[1:38:42] them you know because remember there's
[1:38:43] gonna be no buildings maybe and we'll be
[1:38:45] like we'll be rulers over them and the
[1:38:47] Bible said reigning over them and
[1:38:49] telling them what to do we'll be like a
[1:38:52] thought maybe right back to the our
[1:38:53] mansion praise God our room for the Lord
[1:38:58] see it's Dominion its ruling it's
[1:39:03] raining and serving God's purpose so God
[1:39:09] will have a purpose that you were to
[1:39:10] serve his purpose in that place in that
[1:39:13] New Jerusalem will be really busy in
[1:39:19] heaven praise God oh my we're gonna see
[1:39:26] Nations by the Ray healed you imagine
[1:39:28] all the war in the Middle East but one
[1:39:30] day there's gonna be no war in the
[1:39:32] Middle East you have actually real
[1:39:35] believers that are Arabs right different
[1:39:39] nations and there'll be no more wars
[1:39:41] between them just peace we'll see that
[1:39:45] we'll see nations heal people that will
[1:39:49] can you imagine a perfect civilization
[1:39:51] where there's no envy no bitterness
[1:39:53] there's no starvation there's no disease
[1:39:55] no cancer not and we just see we'll
[1:40:00] watch and see us everything is healed
[1:40:03] everything comes back to perfect
[1:40:05] perfection and if we're faithful
[1:40:09] Christians will reign over it they shall
[1:40:13] reign with him
[1:40:14] the Bible says nations will be healed
[1:40:19] kings and priests will reign
[1:40:25] close of this this future home is the
[1:40:30] New Eden right programs to the third
[1:40:34] purpose of God's mystery was to bring
[1:40:36] him back to Eden but this Eden is way
[1:40:39] better than the first Eden there is a
[1:40:44] river in Genesis there was those three
[1:40:47] rivers in Genesis but here we only need
[1:40:49] one River the River of Life raised God
[1:40:55] in the first Eden there was a tree of
[1:40:58] life and a tree of knowledge good evil
[1:40:59] but in the last eaten there's no tree of
[1:41:02] knowledge of good and evil there's no
[1:41:04] more evil because there's no curse amen
[1:41:06] hallelujah and church this is a big tree
[1:41:11] of life I don't know how big it wasn't
[1:41:13] the first unit but now it's massive
[1:41:15] God's tree has now grown and it's so big
[1:41:19] it's on both sides of a river Oh God
[1:41:23] if it is a physical tree right it may be
[1:41:26] just a mouth of Christ's presence but
[1:41:30] they had one little there one small tree
[1:41:32] Christ presence but now it's massive
[1:41:34] tree not two trees what's down to one
[1:41:36] tree Satan entered the first one but the
[1:41:42] Bible said no evil thing will enter this
[1:41:45] holy city praise God he could enter the
[1:41:48] first he didn't but he's not entering
[1:41:50] the last Eden praise God
[1:41:52] the first Eden was a garden the last
[1:41:56] Eden is a city
[1:42:00] I think the first eater was one family
[1:42:02] the laughs Eden is old gods family amen
[1:42:07] it's a multitude of family members Amen
[1:42:10] it's the better
[1:42:11] Eden praise God glory it's the magnified
[1:42:17] Eden it's like the first Eden but
[1:42:20] multiplied and made greater there was
[1:42:30] in there in the first Eton there's only
[1:42:33] day in the last season because the light
[1:42:38] of Jesus lights the whole thing his face
[1:42:41] lights the whole thing the Bob said
[1:42:45] there be no night there Jesus will never
[1:42:49] have to come and say good night brother
[1:42:50] Jesse it's time to go to bed like you
[1:42:53] did with Adam and Eve good night Adam
[1:42:54] and Eve but there there's no night
[1:42:58] because there'll be no darkness
[1:43:00] there'll be no curse it'll always be
[1:43:03] light it always been pure tea holiness
[1:43:05] amen no need for rest because our bodies
[1:43:09] are eternally empowered with energy amen
[1:43:12] holy energy praise the Lord
[1:43:19] their beam was like this let me close to
[1:43:24] this and church the best part of all
[1:43:26] this
[1:43:26] I believe in verse 4 and they shall see
[1:43:34] his face I kind of mentioned that
[1:43:37] earlier
[1:43:37] oh right now sister Beatrice the Bible
[1:43:41] said we see duck ly through a glass kind
[1:43:46] of like our car windows right they get
[1:43:47] all foggy before we scrape them off
[1:43:50] that's kind of like how it is right now
[1:43:51] we're trying to do e we see this you
[1:43:53] know really but really that's just like
[1:43:56] seeing through a glass darkly
[1:43:58] that's just like a window that needs
[1:44:00] washed off right
[1:44:02] right now we see as a glass darkly but
[1:44:06] Paul says but when perfection comes
[1:44:09] we'll see face to face praise God and
[1:44:15] John says we let's read first John 3:2
[1:44:18] real quick first John 3:2 I turned right
[1:44:23] to it praise the Lord that saves a
[1:44:24] little bit of time beloved now we are
[1:44:28] the sons of God and it does not yet
[1:44:30] appear what we shall be but we know that
[1:44:32] when he shall appear we shall be like
[1:44:35] him for we will see him as he is amen
[1:44:38] glory what a blessing so to me church
[1:44:43] the
[1:44:43] spark is like what Peter said Peter said
[1:44:47] whom you haven't seen yet you love and
[1:44:53] Jesus said blessed is he that hasn't
[1:44:56] seen yet still believes amen glory so
[1:45:01] the best way for us is that we will
[1:45:03] finally see what we believe this whole
[1:45:06] time and we'll see him in all this
[1:45:08] beauty it was blue and it was holiness
[1:45:11] and we won't see him like the backside
[1:45:14] of a man like Moses saw but he'll turn
[1:45:17] his back and we'll see his face amen
[1:45:19] hallelujah amen
[1:45:22] Moses only got this is my praise God but
[1:45:25] we're good to see his face thank you
[1:45:27] Jesus praise God
[1:45:30] let's say to our feet like that song
[1:45:33] says turn your eyes upon Jesus look full
[1:45:35] in his wonderful face right now we're
[1:45:38] just trying I wanted to be what'll be
[1:45:40] like and the Bible said it doesn't yet
[1:45:43] appear what it'll be like but when we
[1:45:47] see him we'll have a body like unto his
[1:45:50] glorious body
[1:45:52] amen hallelujah what was his body like
[1:45:57] brother Ray it could eat fish and bread
[1:45:59] after the resurrection but it could also
[1:46:01] walk through a wall I can't do that yet
[1:46:06] but maybe one day I will
[1:46:09] what else could is mind you it could
[1:46:12] just rise up you could ascend to heaven
[1:46:13] in a cloud I wonder if our bodies will
[1:46:19] be able to do the same
[1:46:20] whatever he is if we let him know when
[1:46:25] we see him we'll be just like him so to
[1:46:30] me that will be the highlight of
[1:46:33] revelation 22 see revelation is 22 is
[1:46:39] the last chapter of the Bible but it's
[1:46:42] the first chapter of our new life amen
[1:46:46] hey this is the hope of the Saints
[1:46:50] children come up here here whoa
[1:46:58] after seeing this vision of 22 chapters
[1:47:01] what were John's last words he said even
[1:47:04] so Lord Jesus come quickly
[1:47:07] the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
[1:47:09] with you I hope after these 109 sermons
[1:47:12] I hope your desire is like my desire I
[1:47:14] hope we all have the same desire that we
[1:47:16] just want to see Jesus return
[1:47:18] amen yes we want to see our children I
[1:47:21] want to see them live out their lives
[1:47:22] but really I really want to see him come
[1:47:25] back raised God let's see him come and
[1:47:27] give us the reward of eternal life of a
[1:47:30] glorified body and that we can be called
[1:47:33] his children his sovereign say men that
[1:47:36] we could have the pleasure the joy of
[1:47:38] serving him eternally and never have to
[1:47:40] leave his side praise God
[1:47:43] what a joy John saw the church ages he
[1:47:50] saw the horse riders ride he saw the
[1:47:52] veils and the destruction and the vials
[1:47:53] and the trumpets but the last thing he
[1:47:57] sees is Jesus on the throne the lamb the
[1:47:59] father and the water and all I can think
[1:48:03] of to say is surely come quickly Lord
[1:48:06] God come quickly please don't delay it
[1:48:12] much longer
[1:48:14] it's certainly getting darker this world
[1:48:16] but for the Christian it's becoming more
[1:48:18] bright because we're starting to get
[1:48:21] closer to see this face praise God
[1:48:25] [Music]
[1:48:28] we long to see his face because there
[1:48:33] will be the end of death will be the end
[1:48:36] of Tears be the end of cancer the end of
[1:48:39] lust the end of fear the end of
[1:48:42] selfishness the end of temptation the
[1:48:44] understated the
[1:48:46] of demons the end of everything sinful
[1:48:49] it'll be the beginning of a new chapter
[1:48:50] with Christ oh yeah so the end of this
[1:48:57] is just the beginning for us John says
[1:49:02] quickly Lord he was completely bring
[1:49:08] this new city bring this home where no
[1:49:11] one ever has to cry anymore please bring
[1:49:16] this city clean off this earth get rid
[1:49:20] of the rancid gonna have so right now

[2:00:25] raise god another Lord tonight I was
[2:00:37] thinking that scripture for now we see
[2:00:43] through a glass darkly so Paul had the
[2:00:45] Holy Ghost he preached all these
[2:00:47] messages he said but I see through a
[2:00:49] glass darkly but then face to face now
[2:00:53] even though he was born again I know in
[2:00:55] part but then shall I know even as I am
[2:01:01] no boy just as God is so sure of his
[2:01:06] knowledge of you one day you'll have
[2:01:08] that same knowledge of him praise you
[2:01:10] honey
[2:01:11] you will wonder anymore does God love me
[2:01:12] that's good news if you won't wonder
[2:01:15] they'll have those mind mouths anymore
[2:01:16] because who will know about him and his
[2:01:19] plans even as he knows us praise God
[2:01:25] amen anyone need anyone does our prayer
[2:01:30] tonight
[2:01:31] praise God if you desire prayer more

[2:01:42] saints of God was singing a Park Church
[2:02:11] Bill Graham said the hoffmans head of
[2:02:13] Christ is the closest pretty near as
[2:02:16] close to could be he looked like a man
[2:02:18] if he'd speak the world would come to an
[2:02:21] end and yet was so much love and
[2:02:24] kindness till I just pitched over when
[2:02:27] he had a vision of his face it was such
[2:02:33] a combination of power and of love and
[2:02:36] think of that we get to look in that
[2:02:38] face every day praise God Lori's see the
[2:02:44] God of all creation in his power and
[2:02:46] also does love and favor
[2:02:49] what's his banner over you church's
[2:02:51] banner realist love he loves us praise
