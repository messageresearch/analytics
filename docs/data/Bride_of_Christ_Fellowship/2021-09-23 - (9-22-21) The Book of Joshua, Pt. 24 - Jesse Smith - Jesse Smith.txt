========================================

about the 12 tribes i remember on sunday kind of ended with that thought how brother brandt was saying the mothers prophesied well personally i couldn't find that in the scripture i still can't find the scripture so it seems like jacob and moses prophesied of it that's what it seems like as far as i can find the scripture and i'm always open to any correction i put that in all my videos i put that on all my sermons i'm always open for any correction it just seems like brother branham was just trying his best and maybe he didn't have like he said it would take hours and hours to to to devote to these things to really nail him down in the scripture and it seems like he just didn't perhaps have all that time because he was constantly in visions praying for the sick off hunting relaxing trying to build up his physical strength because it would just go get torn down the next group of campaigns right through the discernments and so forth so uh but the beautiful thoughts that he shared were were so scriptural and then the details of course you know that's i think that's our job to go through and find the details right i believe that by god's grace deuteronomy 33 verse 1. let's read that together verse one ready one two three and this is the blessing wherewith moses the man of god bless the children of israel before his death now if you go to verse 24 and 25. now let me read these they're you know they're about asher but i want you to notice here if you remember and of asher he said let asher be blessed with children let him be acceptable to his brethren and let him dip his foot in oil that sound familiar on sunday i kind of mentioned that right at the end brother ram talked about how one of the tribes would have his feet and oil but brother braham said ephraim ephraim right but yet the bible says it's asher all right in verse 25 thy shoes shall be iron and brass and as thy day so shall thy strength be i'm not trying to confuse anybody but i'm just saying brother brahm he was just trying his best to get to the right one it wasn't ephraim who had the foot and oil it was asher had the feet and oil okay because we got to take everything back in the word all right now um there's our text now if you go to the mary verse philippians 2 verse 2 and 3. and i did church this week i did it in the bible i looked up in oil all the places of feet and oil there's only one that's ash there's only one so philippians 2 verse 2 and 3. we can read this one together lord willing so let's begin on three one two three fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded having the same love being of one accord of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vain glory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves let's have a word of prayer one more time let's bow our heads and ask god to minister to us here tonight heavenly father we're happy to be in your house again lord we just ask the lord by the the love of god in our hearts lord god that you administer to our needs lord give us wisdom and understanding and lord build our faith lord god edify our faith lord as we see prophecies fulfill we can't help lord but have our faith be built and confirmed lord and being made more strong knowing that if these old testament prophecies were fulfilled no doubt all the new testament prophecies about the bride and the rapture and laodicean age lord and and the hot believers that exist in this age no doubt those shall be fulfilled as well lord we see ourselves in those positive prophecies lord god and we just ask god you give us strength and encourage us lord god make us strong in the lord as we saw on sunday again lord god we repent of our sins lord god we remember you're with us tonight lord you'll never leave us nor forsake us and lord we meditate on your word here tonight and ask that you minister to us in jesus christ's name and saint said amen god bless you praise god you may be seated by the grace of the lord okay so lord ling we'll start here and i have some slides here uh we'd like to show and again you know we're just uh doing what brother adam's taught us you know i have numerous scriptures where brother brahm said prove all things brother brahma said prove me by the word repeatedly brother ram said test me by the word uh you know and he said if any man has anything i notice i'm wrong he said your duty bound to come tell me about it brother ram wasn't afraid of correction brother branham wanted correction praise god and even said in his home life his wife was his correction that's not with preaching but that's with home life just with his usual living uh brother brahm wanted to be correct right and he and god he recognized how god would often use his wife to do so so and then we read of course hebrews 12 we ended with that how the bible said every son must be chastened every son must be corrected praise god and so each person needs correction outside of the lord jesus christ amen so we thank god that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's here tonight praise god amen now let's look at fulfilled prophecies of the tribal positions okay we'll spend maybe 45 minutes here uh just a shorter sermon hopefully we'll see by the grace of the lord it always changes you know um so we read our text here again it's moses prophesying about asher right and i just i just chose asher because that related to the text that i i'm sorry to the quote that i read on sunday at the end of the morning or the first service by god's grace now here let's just if we can let's just look up here if you can i just wanted to summarize the end of the book of joshua just so you have an idea where this goes okay it'll kind of prepare me as well to look for spiritual meanings all right so chapter 18 is where we're at now uh we saw how they're setting up the tabernacle in shiloh joshua's commission to view and write the description of the rest of land for the seven side or seven tribes rather to possess and then benjamin receives the first lot okay chapter 19 goes over the lots given to the remaining six tribes and joshua's given a special gift of inheritance don't you like that god has special gifts to his servants amen amen praise god brother man had a larger portion of heaven amen because he forsook everything he chose the harder way aren't you glad you chose the harder way of your life it'd been a lot easier to go with the with the flow right but instead we're going against the grain praise god we're going against the flow we're like the rainbow trout right rainbow trout goes has to swim into the current amen we're not swimming with the current things are easy for us things are more hard for us they're they're more difficult for us but we're going against the current and the bible says that gives us a special reward remember we went through the 16 rewards from the church ages or was it 14 14 rewards from the church ages not long ago so we get a special reward we get the overcomers inheritance amen just like joshua got a special reward because he was faithful with everything according to the word that's chapter 19. on chat 19 is a huge long chapter and just then has a very small section about joshua's special inheritance praise god uh here's the remaining four chapter or the reigning uh five chapters after that chapter 20 let's list the cities of refuge so if you accidentally killed somebody or something god had a special place of mercy for you right because if you killed somebody the law was eye for eye tooth for tooth life for life death for death right that was the law life or death and so god in his mercy gave them a place where they could go if they accidentally made a mistake god had mercy there now they had to stand before the judges right but what if they stood before the judges and the the story was true then they could have mercy praise god until the death of the high priest and then they would have then they could return to their inheritance by god's grace now church if that doesn't show mercy i don't know what does amen they're under law but god still showed much mercy praise god and allowed them to get their land back even if they lost it of course then you have the jubilee on top of that as well so there was many there's numerous different ways that people could be free from uh their losses and have restoration amen praise god now chapter 21 is the cities of levites among their tribes and this also shows god's faithfulness to israel in keeping all of his promises praise god chapter 22 is joshua's words to the two and a half tribes on the east of jordan and then there's confusion at the end of the chapter followed by peace regarding the altar set up by these two and a half tribes we'll look at that a little more here tonight with reuben also chapter 23 there's a summons by joshua reminding them of blessings and cursings in the land and then the book ends with a final summons uh joshua urging everybody to gather together and he urges them make your choice and then joshua passes off the scene so this is how the book ends praise god have you enjoyed it so far amen and i don't know how much you know i don't know how much inspiration i'll get out of here i felt really inspired so up to this date uh and we'll just see you trust the holy spirit will give us some more inspiration here by the grace of god but this kind of tells you we're getting closer to the end here now let's look tonight lord willing let's look at the order of the tribes possessing their land inheritance okay now here's just a brief review of of how the sons all came about said abraham and sarah they had isaac isaac mary rebecca jacob now jacob mary was given leah by the by the deception right he wanted rachel but he was given leah because the father deceived him he was getting paid back for the deception he did right just like abraham when he lied then he would you know he had to suffer for that isaac lied and they suffered for that whatever a man sells that's what he reaps right so through leah he had reuben and simeon levi judah through leah and then he also had a daughter dinah and then he had two more sons issachar and zebulun okay now through leah's servant zilpah he received gad and asher through billa rachel's sermon remember because she got kind of jealous and she couldn't have kids she said well jacob take my servant billa and they had uh then he had dan and naphtali or naftali i never say that one right finally by god's grace at the very end once all 10. imagine that after all 10 god had mercy on rachel opened up her womb and she had joseph right who became the greatest of all of them right and then the last was benjamin and that's where she died remember because she took the gods and jacob spoke the curse if you take the gods whoever takes the gods dies so she died on the curse of the lord for taking those uh but brought forth benjamin okay so then that's her that's how we get the 12 sons praise god and this was god remember the bible i didn't i mentioned this on sunday but remember the bible gives great honor to leah and rachel because the bible said they built the house of israel think about that the men played a great part but the women played a major part as well because they carried the children and trained them god ruth actually gives them credit ruth picks it up and gives them credit that they built the house of god amen praise god they build in other words they built a dwelling place for god amen because these men would of course have offspring and become a kingdom of priests unto god and now god can be worshiped in the way that he wants to be worshipped amen and now he can have people that are wholly dedicated and separated unto him and who got the credit for that well the men did abraham isaac jacob but also the women god recognized their part so sisters again remember you've got the rights amen you got the rights like we saw a few weeks ago you have the rights you have the privileges and you have the calling of god to fulfill all the calling of god for your lives amen i'm excited to see what our what god brings up in our little sisters praise god if the lord tarries you like we said maybe prophecies uh like the daughters of philip uh maybe it's the word of wisdom like uh aquila praise god uh maybe it's even a spirit of discernment like deborah because she was a judge amen just to judge the right is this the right spirit of the wrong spirit and the holy ghost can anoint these sisters and they can recognize it right away amen so we'll see what god or miracles right praying for the sick uh divine healing it'll be wonderful to see what god has for these sisters and then that's just spiritual what about the natural raising children as well into the church of god into the church of the lord jesus christ amen because the bible says we're the spiritual habitation we're the spiritual temple of the holy ghost amen right so mothers you played a great part in that only one we have here tonight is naomi god bless her but all the mothers in our church have played the part of building helping finish the spiritual body of jesus christ amen hallelujah sisters you're putting those last few bricks amen in that laodicean uh in that laodicean layer praise god of the house of god because remember when that last brick is laid when the last person is born again then that capstone comes down and it's going to fit perfectly on the bride of jesus christ amen which the sisters played their part to build that house amen remember paul said i've seen the faith of timothy he said but i saw in your mother and your grandmother first amen praise god so the faith that we see in you no doubt we're going to see it in your children as well praise god and i'm hoping for a bigger portion of mine amen because i'm a little bit ashamed of my faith sometimes but i'm trusting by god's grace i'll see greater faith in their lives amen and it's okay to say that brother branson i was ashamed of my faith you know he thought he should have done better and it's okay church we all fall short of god's glory but there's no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus amen thank god that's the power of the blood amen we recognize our mistakes but then god forgives them and then god gives us more grace to try again and he he finishes the work that he started in us amen that's a great blessing now i preached us years and years ago probably four years now but let's just review this because we're getting into uh this teaching and it's a beautiful teaching it's mainly taught in the seventh seal you'll remember and then the church age book with the book of life section so in genesis 35 uh before uh yeah that's right that's before they leave uh this is the order of the sons before they leave into egypt right so uh reuben born first born now i made levi and joseph a different color because that changed they leave the next time they're counted in numbers okay so after they come out they're counted again and notice levi and joseph are no longer in here because ephraim and manasseh took joseph's spot right and then levi wasn't given any uh inheritance he was just dedicated totally unto god all right but god likes that number 12. i like that number 12 too 12 new testament mysteries amen the twelve stones elijah put on the altar the twelve pieces of shoe bread praise god it all speaks of kingdom and government amen uh and now now notice here okay these gentlemen were added in the two sons of joseph but i put a asterisk by ephraim and dan why did i do that because not long after this they got involved in idolatry and god brought their name out under heaven so their names are still in heaven but under heaven god was gonna make them be punished under heaven yep dan and ephraim uh remember the bible said ephraim is joined to hide her his idols leave him alone remember that i was in the scripture i don't remember which i think it was hosea if i'm not mistaken uh and dan set up a huge or uh i think worship i have to look that one up the exact scripture but he set up idols as well and so god kicked them out of the the order at least until later on amen at least until later on yeah until they're back here in the millennium now in revelation 7 after the rapture and here's what we got going on tonight right now church can you imagine this right now tonight there's 12 000 of every one of these getting close now there's almost 12 000 in israel tonight praise god they're slowly coming back and after all these 3 000 years amen they're slowly coming back one by one two by two the three by three four by four they're slowly coming back and they're filling up these numbers but man said they may not know their tribal names but he said god knows their tribes amen hallelujah because god's got to register in heaven hallelujah and he knows the tribes that they're uh they come from but after the rapture church god seals 144 000 with the holy ghost and here the differences are dan and ephraim are removed and then uh levi and joseph are put back in isn't that something he's there at the beginning they're there at the beginning they're put back in for the baptism of the holy ghost i think that's really special amen now they joseph's tribe gets the baptism of the holy ghost look at that dan and the ephraim miss out on the baptism of the holy ghost because they put idols in their life what about these people that make brother branham and idol and make him infallible church i believe they're going to miss out on some things don't you not just the millennium i think they're going to miss out on more than that but see this is what god thinks of people that put idols in their life they get forgotten god can't deal with them because they're giving over you know what that's the spirit of whoredoms the bible said amen idolatry is whoredoms praise god it's spiritual whoredoms being unfaithful making love to devils instead of making love to god right kiss the son lest he be angry he said that on sunday right in the book of uh psalms see but god blots them out they don't get the baptism of the holy ghost and church god that's what god's saying god wants to be number one if god is number one in your life you're gonna be born again amen that's a great truth there especially for our young people that some of them have been baptized if they're gonna be born again god has to be number one he's got to be before school he's got to be before friends he's got to be before hobbies he's got to be before everything god has to be the most important thing in your life pleasing god worshiping god growing closer to god uh knowing god has to be the number one thing in your life amen god cuts off two of the sons uh or sorry two of the tribes because of idolatry what a story and then in the millennium when all things are settled apparently god settles all things with israel right they're not blinded anymore in the millennium he puts dan and e from back in moves out and they're back to their original they're back to the original right back to the original they're back in and then e for manasseh i'm sorry not quite back to the original because levi and joseph are out right but uh ephraim manasseh are back in there for joseph okay so it ends with joseph and levi not having uh a tribe of their own okay that's what it ends with there uh set up in the millennial uh in the millennial kingdom that's right and that's in uh we read that briefly over a few weeks ago remember a sunday night bible study two some days ago ezekiel 48 1-8 and then 22 through 29 speaks of that what a what what a what a study isn't that striking in church how god how serious he takes the name of god right look how serious oh no no no i'm nothing about rachel again right look how serious god takes idolatry idols cursed and she dies young she dies at a young age after right after having a baby because of idols these tribes removed because of idols and what did paul say he said dearly beloved he said don't give yourselves to idols my dearly beloved children give yourselves out to idols so we must make sure our greatest love is the lord jesus christ so how do you do that you come to church and you sing god praises you you jump around you hop around you you give god number one and then you do it at home too praise god just give god your best praise god you've got to worship him with all your heart soul mind and strength think about that heart is your emotions are we giving god all of our emotions soul is your nature your mind is your thoughts and then your strength is your body jesus said give me all of those give me all your emotions give me all your thoughts act upon my nature only in your soul and then give me your physical strength as well amen so we don't feel like a church or we're tired we still come to church amen praise god don't feel like thinking about the things of god we read the bible anyway praise god all right amen you've got to do that praise god we've got to pray until we feel emotion for god amen we've got to pray until the emotions that we have from the you know just our flesh we can overcome those and be happy about the lord be joyful in the lord praise god we can weep at all the blessings of calvary amen we can remember all the things that he's done amen it's a great study it's a beautiful teaching here now here's a new one i've never showed this ever to the church so this is brand new so i hope everybody enjoys this one i don't know how useful to be but i hope you enjoy it now here's the order of the tribes receiving that inheritance okay so the first two and a half tribes reuben gad and half of manasseh they got their uh we're told about their land in joshua 14 right that's when they go possess it all the wars are over the kings are uh defeated right and joshua says okay now you can go back and you can go to your your land on the east of jordan remember levites got no land because god was their portion now chapter 15 guess who gets their land first you're going to see it again tonight caleb's caleb's tribe praise god judah gets it right because out of judah comes christ he's the lion of the tribe of judah there's something very special about the tribe of judah look at caleb caleb serves god with all of his heart he holy follows god no idols there praise god amen he holy father the lord and that's what he was known as a man he constantly followed the word of the lord that's my desire amen to be like that i know it's yours too to love the lord with all your heart soul mind and strength and the holy father the lord in everything i do i first found it in the word people want to see visions of other women people want us dream dreams which is okay but if those things don't match with the word of god it's no good it's got to line up with the word of god that's the real like we said that's the real yerman thummim praise god the word of god no matter what leading you get whatever voice you hear that's wonderful but you got to take it back to the word make sure it was the right voice amen because satan can transform transform himself into an angel of light right he can transform looks so holy looks so powerful he can transform himself into a messenger of life but he's not a messenger of light he's a messenger of death and the only way to receive the messenger of light is to look back to the word of god the one who wrote the word of god for jesus is the light of the world hallelujah we hear a lot we hear a lot of that today people having visions and i dreamed this to brother branham and i heard that and i saw that that's fine but take it back to the light then take it back to the real word of god and see if it shines on that urem of the word of god amen so chapter 16 now we're past that right because we're on 18 right now chapter 15 you saw judah got their inheritance 16 ephraim and the other half of manasseh got it now look there's those uh there's those brothers there right by relation so joshua's second judah was first with caleb joshua second got the land as far as the order of the tribes manasseh the other half oh yeah it's explained again there let's explain again so now you've had now after after joshua 17 now five of the tribes have already been taken how many are left seven and we saw that on sunday right there's seven more left so joshua 18 shows how seven tribes did still not receive the land but then benjamin gets his lot so now we have five plus one is six so now six of the tribes half the tribes have their land and then when we read nineteen we'll maybe preach on that maybe sunday we'll actually not suddenly probably be next wednesday maybe we'll see lord willing chapter 19 gives the lots for simeon zebulun issachar asher naphtali and dan and then at the end of chapter 19 as you go to chapter 20 all the tribes have their land and the church said that took me about 30 minutes to do that just that one visual right so think about how much time it took that person to do that one and that took me 30 minutes how much did that take that guy all right now i just did another way this is the same information just a little differently i put the birth order of the children right here and then the order that they got their land so reuben really got it first right because they chose the east side of jordan uh so did the half of manasseh and gab they got their land first because they chose to be foolish virgin and the church said they chose well i don't want to live in the land the giants are too much i'd rather i like to live outside they chose to be foolish virgin now second after that tie breaker was judah got the land second because they got theirs first third was ephraim fourth was i missed fourth oh yeah because i got drive two two fifths what happened oh there it is yeah thank you hey good eyes brothers good eyes good fourth was manasseh the other half fifth was benjamin six simeon seven zebulun eighth isakar uh ninth where'd nine i must left nine out okay left nine up ten asher eleventh naphtali and then last was dan okay remember levi the lord was his portion i like that praise god i don't have to i like that lord i don't have to have lands and riches and all that fancy things just give me jesus ah that's my portion maybe amy's gonna sing that on sunday he's my portion you are my portion levi no i'm sorry joseph his two sons even from nasa were given his portion right okay oh where's that lord so we might fix where's number nine oh it's not there that could be okay yeah they thank you yeah where's my nine that's so strange oh you know i put the ones together too so yeah i probably should have separated those because if three of them are are all one then there won't be twelve so yeah often checked into that thank you good good eyes there that one took me less time that one was pretty easy that didn't take a whole lot of time all right now so remember from genesis to numbers levi was separated the priesthood joseph's two sons were placed in from numbers to revelation ephraim and dan removed due to idolatry and then from a revelation to ezekiel they're back in the numbers 10 order so the order of coming out of egypt okay they're placed back in just a reminder there all right now let's go back to my text here and uh give me uh about 30 more minutes we'll try to finish up here tonight by god's grace uh example now i'm going to use this example from the text again moses here's moses prophecy and he places asher's foot in oil okay now i want to start with this to show you how brother branham found these beautiful thoughts but not all the details were exact because he wasn't a scholar right he wasn't a doctor of divinity okay and he didn't have the time to do it now remember there were seasons of brother man's life when he was a teacher like the church ages the seven seals right i would even say marriage and divorce he did a lot of great teaching in that sermon right which there's a big uh confusion about that now people that are leaving the message say brother i'm talk uh uh polygamy in there that's not true there's no that's not true they they're just not born again and so they want to find excuses to marry more wives that's the sin of those people but brother adam didn't teach all the time but when he did teach and he got time down to preach like the future home there's another one just taught it beautifully and yes he borrowed from clarence larkin but what he did is he took the great revelation god gave him of the three works of grace which larkin didn't teach and he showed how the earth had to go through three phases just like you and i go through three phases amen now in 1960 brother ram said ephraim's mother prophesied his foot would be an oil but it was actually moses who prophesied asher's foot would be an oil and that was our text this doesn't stumble you and i but that would offend other people because they'd say who are you to protect or who are you to correct god's prophet well it ain't me it's the holy ghost because i wouldn't know it unless the holy ghost showed me right because who am i i'm a dummy i don't know nothing the only way a correction can be made is by the holy ghost because either listen in terms of either i'm wrong or i'm right right either i'm wrong i'm right so if i'm right and brother man just said the wrong name then it was the holy ghost bringing correction to help you and i look back to the word of god and make the bible or absolutely just like brother branham said if i died now right now he said my absolute is the word of god amen he said if i die in my tracks right now jesus christ is my absolute amen and there's only one absolute there can be no other but jesus christ in his word so if that offends them then they need to get born again that's the problem they're not born again and they worship a man more than they worship christ that's my thoughts i can be wrong but that's what i believe any honest person would know that man made just simple human mistakes now here's the here's the slide from sunday ephraim now here's what ram says watch when they each one of those mothers when she called out ephraim when she was in labor positionally placed him where his feet was setting in oil now notice ephraim ephraim now i showed you on sunday that's not true but we'll get through it again here just exactly every one of them where they were at i think i might have changed some words up here yeah yeah genesis 41 52 is the only recording of his birth from a nasa she does not mention oil nor any prophecy the bible records joseph not as an aph names ephraim so we have no scripture for azanath prophesying or naming ephraim no scripture right also the lexicon has no meaning of ephraim but it has to relate to the fruitfulness despite your affliction because that's how all the mothers named their children whatever they were feeling at that moment like judah praise the lord that's why i named the boy i'm praising god for another son amen that's what they named the child right and manasseh's name relates to god helping her forget her toil that's what manasseh means god help me forget my toil okay now let's get to a few and we'll try to get through four tonight by god's grace okay we'll try to get through the first four of the sons that were born we'll see how it goes get your bibles ready uh i need some ready readers some maokai looks like you and i maybe nature get your bible carrots you want to read you don't have to but no okay that's fine i'd be great to get through some of these here and uh again church we gotta taste test everything by the word of god all right now first i hope that you can see this i hope this just i just want to make this simple humble statement i hope you can see if god foreknew their places in scripture i'm sorry if god for knew their places in the natural land how much more does god know your spiritual place and also your natural place amen right like when i went back for my 20-year football reunion i showed naomi and wesley's picture up there i think i still have it on my computer i said this is the reason god let us win a state championship and let me go to akron for college so i could be pastor because they needed a home church and they're like yeah interesting but they heard it i told it to them that's the reason god let me win those state championships i won six state championships and then two i won six individual and two team the reason god allowed that wasn't to glorify me because i get old all the records get broken it's to bring me to akron so i could preach the word of god to their kids amen and my kids so we could have a church in akron praise god that's the whole point of it and maybe i'll pull that up here if i can remember at the end of the sermon here i think i have it on my ipad i don't know but see if god knew about their natural place how much more does he know about your natural and your spiritual things that god wants you to possess amen god wants us to possess the gifts of the spirit god wants us to possess love and joy and all the fruits of the spirit most people don't possess that but we should amen and god wants us to do that and we are i'm saying like this we are enjoying possessing some of those things praise god i haven't attained yet but i'm pressing on so i can attain it amen thank god amen now reuben okay got your bibles there malcolm nature got your bible you want to read there okay why don't we do this malachi genesis 29 nature why don't you get genesis 49 3 and 4. brother william do you want to read brother could you okay do you want to get deuteronomy 33 6. thank you sir i appreciate that brother you just really uh showed me you're a real word man you're a real you got a real good leadership i i i don't know if you heard the song but he was really bold with those hindus we met on sunday he's like you need to join our family our family in christ that was a beautiful witnessing opportunity that was i gave my card and i haven't heard back from them but again they're gonna brother on the day of judgment they're we're gonna stand right there we're gonna watch that again we're gonna forget what happened you know in a few days or a few weeks we'll forget but god didn't forget that they had a chance right there to turn down their hindu gods and receive the true jesus christ because they were trying to say all the gods are the same william's like no there's only one god with one name and i even told him at the end i said well you got we got to compare our holy books because if you change one word you're cursed right you need to contact me let me see your holy book because our holy book is perfect praise god and to change one word of it you're cursed you've got the got a different gospel i didn't say all that but i said some of that there okay so malachi birth scriptures of reuben go and read this now let's see if there's any prophecy about land in here go ahead maokai and when the lord when he was hated he opened her womb but rachel was barren and leah conceived in their son and she called his name reuben where she said surely the lord has looked upon my affliction now therefore my husband will love me all right what's the verse after that who does it what does it say then samia okay so there's this birth scriptures does it say anything about the land no and we're not trying to be smart alex i'm sure the live streamers understand that we're not we're just trying to look at the what does the bible say now if you look in the uh the hebrew lexicon reuben means behold a son now brother abraham said his name meant sheep herder now you just saw in the scripture does his name mean sheep herder at least not in hebrew not good in some other language right but it doesn't mean sheep herder in the hebrew okay nature you want to read that genesis 49 verses 3 and 4. excellency i'm sorry yeah excellency excellency the finalists all right great reading of maokai nature great job okay so so far we read the birth and there's jacob's prophecy look about his own son do you say anything good about his son not really he said you he did say you're my excellency of power but he said you're not going to prosper right how'd you like your dad to say that once you want a blessing from your dad but see god foreknew the choices he was going to make right you see anything about any land there no okay uh let's go to uh by the way i'm key ready deuteronomy 33 6. let reuben leave very good that was aw that's all moses said about reuben yeah because this is this is before the um so here do we see anything about land so we'll see the results of some of these prophecies next but nothing prophesied of his land so see every statement by brother brown we got we we can enjoy it you know but we gotta make sure we take it back to the word of god okay victoria honey victoria sit down man thank you sweetie thank you thank you look up here and just watch daddy okay all right okay now here's the quote i read yeah here's the quote i read sunday reuben does not seem to mean sheepherder although he's later connected to sheep and i'm going to show you the scripture on that one his name means behold his son now brother said when each of these hebrew mothers and their travailing in the childbirth called out like reuben that placed him positionally in the palestine exactly the way that that mother said and called his name now that's it's not exactly right right because it wasn't the mothers it was you're gonna see it i've studied this a little bit further there's only a couple that actually had prophecy about the land there's only a couple out of the 12. not all of them i mean there's very few actually i can't remember the exact ones i haven't got there all the way but he said i don't have it all wrote down here but say or in other words let's just pretend let's say reuben met sheepherder gad means cattle raiser and e ferment corn raiser now by spirit now this starts right here by spiritual discernment josh was the new leader by discernment place each one where he belonged and divided land just exactly amen so joshua had the holy ghost right and he had contact with god plus he had the priest with the urem and he said lord where do you want them to live and the bible said he cast lots so he would like roll dice or something like that and then he said is this where reuben's supposed to be and then it would flash on the urim and thumb they'd have a supernatural experience that's where they are praise god see that's how god is god doesn't church god don't have to have things written down god can speak to you through the spoken word of god amen right god can do that but everything that god says will line up with what was written amen that's the joy that we have with the bible and any leading that we have well i feel led to do this or i feel i should say this or i should feel i should go there make sure it lines up with the word first praise god god said he god said he will raise your strength if you wait on him amen we think we get weaker when we wait we don't we get stronger amen we get stronger when we wait on the lord remember the bible said it's the fool that speaks things quickly well i'm going to go do this or i'm going to do that lord said this lord he might have or he might not have the fool speaks quickly right but the wise man holds his words right he waits until he's make sure he's got thus saith the lord they'll still say that in the face of this right they'll still say that that's because they got they got a demon on him and you can't argue with a demon i'm sorry i'll say it like this you can't argue with the demon i'm sorry you can't convince a demon right you can cast them out if the person wants to be delivered but you can't convince them because they they have this so many of them are demons of lies that's their whole anointing is to lie their life is uh to lie and you'll never convince them that they're wrong and leah conceived embarrassing said she called his name reuben for she said surely the lord looked upon my affliction now therefore my husband will love me behold the son god's given me a son my husband's gonna love me doesn't say anything about the land now there's a lot of reading but uh the complaint against now here's this is reason so this is history on reuben were those words that william read and nature read were they fulfilled or not here's what he says the complaint against him in the song of deborah is the summary of his whole history by the streams of reuben by or by the fresh streams which descend from the eastern hills into the jordan and dead sea on whose banks the beto and chiefs met then as now to debate in the streams of reuben great were the desires or the resolutions which were never carried out the people highly resting them on their flocks as if it were a time of peace so in other words when deborah got the victory reuben and his tribes were just sitting up there like everything was peaceful in other words reuben didn't come down to fight with the saints he just kept his life really easy and laid back that's that's exactly i got the scripture i'm gonna show it to you in judges reuben heard oh there's a war going on come down and help barrack and help eric and deborah they're going to go up and defeat the midnight sir and they just sat back and said oh we're just going to hang out we're just going to take life easy now look at the character this person when god calls on him are they ready to fight or not he wasn't ready so church we got to be ready to pray right whether we feel like it or not we've got to fight in prayer don't we right whether you feel like it or not that's why when i get to email someone i'll just buy my head and pray lord minister that need in jesus name we had a couple good prayer requests come out like that you might not have all the time to fight you might not have time to take it to your prayer closet but don't don't avoid it let's not be lazy let's be willing to fight with god's people stan lee's sinai and palestine oh yeah that's a historical reference okay that's from a book now all three tribes on the east of jordan at length fell into complete apostasy at the time as the time of retribution or retribution came god served the spirit of pole king of assyria and the spirit of uh tilgath pil pills pelessier sorry king of assyria to carry them away the first of the tribes in the captive look at that church who was the first one the devil carried away out of their land who's the first one that lost their possession the ones that didn't cross over jordan amen the ones who didn't want to get the baptism of the holy ghost the ones who didn't want to drive out the giants they're the ones got taken away by the devil first in other words the people that don't get born again they're the ones that get deceived first amen because remember the bible said they get taken captive by satan out of his own will because they gave into the will of satan satan takes them over how he ever however he wants to that's what paul said in timothy in timothy he said they're taken captive as a snare he said per venture if god can bring them to repentance see that so when you see people get carried away in the message right and they get carried away into deceitfulness and sin and captivity i mean sin addictions that proves they were never born again because that's what the type is the first ones that get carried away into captivity and slavery and synodiction right like marijuana or adultery or whatever addiction it is right cocaine whatever it is gambling we got a lot of gamblers in the message they hang around the message they're not really in it we're in it because the christ is the message right but they're the ones who get torn off taking off first because they never got born again they never got into the land they never got into christ that's right that's the type that's why this is so beautiful praise god amen the first ones that lose out are the ones that never really lived in there praise god hallelujah didn't have the courage to live in the land they wouldn't live outside the land yet god told them live in the land see be born again have power have the power of the holy ghost live in the land but they didn't want to this is reuben the oldest now see church another thing i'm gonna we see here that that will bless me is that jacob said the sin you committed with my handmaid is gonna follow you that's gonna impact the rest of your life look at that church now of course everybody has free more agency right so reuben could have overcame that but he never did and i was reading it i was i'm sorry i was listening to preachers and they said that was the the act of a heathen king when a heathen king would take over for his dad he had to go sleep with his dad's wives that was a heathen act so that's what reuben tried to do he did a heathen act he tried to go sleep with his dad's concubine or sorry slave right bilda and because he did that he was cursed and he was himself and the tribe was never able to overcome that disobedience it kind of just hung over them their whole life right just like david his adultery didn't hang over him the rest of his life the blood remained over the land remember that the blood remained over his family and the land the rest of his life because some sins are so awful and that's what that's what absalom did what did amazon do when he got the kingdom he went and laid with his wife david's wives up there on in front of everybody that's heathen that's paganism but that's the spirit they were under not the holy spirit they were under the paganism spirit see so we can learn a lot church and i'll say like this there was a one brother who used to come to our church fine brother but he went and saw a prostitute he told me that and he never recovered and now he's out of church and he only he says well if i'm predestinated god will force me back to church that's a lie god gives you your free more agency and see that sin is going to hang over him the rest of his life unless he repents because now it's separate his family they used to dress holy they used to come here over there in the other room you know and now they're all wearing pants and women wearing pants and the tight ones i'm talking about and they put it on facebook and they show up their bodies on facebook and they used to come here and say amen to what i was preaching and one time they come over and said everything we talked about in the van is what you preached so the holy spirit had me give them exactly all the answers to their questions and then a year later they leave and then they start wearing pants that's not god that's somebody who's never crossed over in the promised land that's someone who god loves and tried to show them his love but then they must have fell in love with the world or some uh spirit of addiction or something like that and what happened they were taken into captivity and they lost the victory because they never got in the land we thought they were the land but they weren't in the land amen right we we try to give people the benefit of the doubt we thought a lot of people were in the land and we're finding out they weren't because their life gets taken over by demons of addiction amen that's right praise god i don't plan on saying that but it's just kind of coming to me right now see there's some sins that are so awful and egregious that they hang over people's lives for the rest of their life notice this is so amazing church uh no priest prophet or king ever came out of reuben and yet he was the oldest he was supposed to have all the power of his father jacob think about that abraham isaac jacob reuben that was the order can you ever think about that that's the order he could say i'm in the first born i'm the firstborn i'm the uh great-grandson of abraham but because he did this sexual sin he was cut off from being from even being the firstborn we're going to see that later god takes all the firstborn blessings away from reuben because of his pagan act of adultery well they might even call it incest some people call it incest i i don't actually know the the family ties there with bill i don't know whose family she come from right but the fact is she he slept with his his dad's wife right who is a slave right or concubine everyone is saying see now i want you to remember this to church that when jacob prophesied god wasn't forcing reuben to a bad life but god was foretelling that reuben was never really he and the in them were never really going to overcome this right because god can't force anybody but god was foretelling their freemore agency that they would all just drift away and they wouldn't love god they wouldn't serve god wholeheartedly right so god's not forcing anybody to fall away god's not forcing these people into addictions they're choosing it and god has to let them because he's so loving does that make sense it's 8 o'clock already my goodness that busy body on the wall over there yet now look at this now this is interesting too yet reuben himself and the faithful ones in his tribe seem to have been saved and redeemed so reuben must have at some point he must have lived part of his life there and disobedience and that the maybe at the very end or something he repents and gets redeemed because he is seen here he's one of the 12 tribes of israel right he's back there wasn't he back there did i put that up there was he back there in the baptism of the holy ghost or not maybe i got that wrong did i get that wrong no he's there he's there his tribe's there and that's something his tribe's there so the people himself and the and some of the people must have repented and gotten right right at the end because jesus told the disciples you're going to reign you're going to judge the 12 tribes of israel right that's that one and then there's the 24 seats for the 12 so reuben has one of those seats and then you have uh you have revelation 7 as well where they get the bat to reuben gets the baptism holy ghost his his tribe now the the ones alive that are i believe are alive now and then they're back reuben's back right of course they're in that well i guess they yeah no no no that's right that's right yeah reuben never left the the reuben never left the the tribal groups right it was just dan and ephraim yes i'm kind of i'm kind of getting ephram and uh uh reuben mixed up here so see the life is over overshadowed in disgrace but look how god even gives redemption at the end of our lives if anyone wants it god just like the thief on the cross my goodness god offers them redemption at the very end if they can just look and say jesus is holy he's holy i deserve this jesus doesn't deserve this jesus is the king of kings remember me jesus if you just say that he'll save you amen he said remember me when you come into your kingdom and he said today you'll be with me in paradise amen just by judging the word right a murderer a thief just by judging the word right and recognizing he's a sinner and recognizing christ as the lamb christ saved him so we don't know how close reuben got to going to hell but he got delivered right he got saved because we find him back in the order we find him with a seat at the throne of god my goodness now here's the scripture deborah singing she just got the victory church that's what you do when you get a victory you start singing and praising the lord and the princes of issachar were with deborah even issachar look at this it's a car so we're gonna get the iss car right issachar they come up and helped him they helped barrack they helped uh uh deborah and also barrick and he was sent on foot into the valley for the divisions of reuben there were great thoughts of heart now look they were hoping oh reuben's so big reuben can help us out we have great thoughts in our heart reuben's going to help us but why a bonus thou among the sheepfolds to hear the bleeding of the flocks they would rather spend time just with the animals and just uh everyday lazy kind of work than coming and fighting for their brother and sister who were in the basement basically the life and death they'd rather work than help out their brother and sisters with life and death see we had great thoughts and that's how it is right so we have great thoughts about there it is right there but when we have great thoughts about people that come to our church we think they're born again but when it comes to fighting they don't want to fight they don't want to fight in prayer they want they don't want to drive out all the inhabitants in their lives amen they don't want to possess their land amen hallelujah why would you abide there and lazy living like that why would you come fight for the saints once you come down the altar and get delivered from the prostitution or the doubt or your unbelief or or your sports addiction like some of them some of them had or your tvs like some of the people had that have left us why don't you come down and they don't come why because they don't want it they love the world more they love god and that proves the love of the father was never in them amen for the divisions of reuben there were great searchings of heart oh boy they're so great they're such mess he's the firstborn they're they can really help us out get this victory but no they want to spend time with the sheep instead instead of fighting for the glory of god's name you would think wouldn't your older brother are you the oldest family brother okay so you're not the oldest you have an older brother so do i simon's my older brother how'd i feel like if simon wouldn't come help me out he's my older he's my oldest brother he always has though he's always come help me out every time that's why we thank god for an older sibling praise god right now naomi's oldest right oh you're not the oldest the oldest girl okay my fault sorry i thought you were the honest but your older sibling you want them to reach out and help you when you're down and that's what deborah and barrack were thinking oh we have oh they're they're such a great people uh oh there's their god moses blessed them right moses blessed them great in number but they sit back and they don't help you out when they're supposed to help you out can i say it like this it's a letdown they let down their family when their family needs the most church you don't want to do that you want to be there you want to drop everything to help out your family if you can praise god i better stop right there uh i'm gonna close with this so i had uh quite a few more slides you had about 20 or 30 more slides but let's close it let's stand our feet don't come up yet malcolm let me read this and then we'll then you could come up yeah i never really know how many slides i'm going to get through you know i really don't know i like this quote i just want to share this quote as we close brother braham says we will recognize our position as the government kind of uh clamps down on us in the united states which we're seeing that all the time like israel back in her promised land she don't know why she got back there she was just automatically put back there why national force put her in her place now i'm going to say something he says now can we line this up with the bible yes revelation 13 and also esther and type she was a jewish uh by nature right but then thought to be gentile inward jew outward gentile national force but israel homeland national force will put the church in the world council churches now that assign us that's the church not the bride that's right but the power of god will put the people in the bride praise god see that's why some people don't stay with us because they never let the power of god put them in here amen hallelujah the world forces this way and the world forces that way but god forces upward the spirit of god which is the word of god my word of spirit and life will put the bride in her place so see church see we got to be careful we got to read quotes but we also have to look in the bible too because it's not as i showed you tonight not every quote is from the word of god right most are but not everyone because she'll recognize her position in the word then she's in christ will put her in her place no national force will do it but the national force did drive israel to the homeland the natural forces of the council of churches will drive every organization into it but the power of god will raise the right into glory out of it oh people recognize your day as jesus warned you the sign of sodom and the church's conditions of this day you can stop the livestream maokai come on up let me see if i got that football uh picture when i had the wesleyan naomi on there let's see what was that called
