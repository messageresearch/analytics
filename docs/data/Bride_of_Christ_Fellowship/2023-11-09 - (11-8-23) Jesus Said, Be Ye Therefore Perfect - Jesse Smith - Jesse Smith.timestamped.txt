[0:00] you know this actually this thought came
[0:02] from a brother I think it was Ben NAD or
[0:06] uh kadre digs I can't remember but he
[0:09] was talking about be perfect and he said
[0:10] you know what scoffield said scoffield
[0:12] said this wasn't a sinless condition so
[0:14] I just looked at my Bible and sure
[0:15] enough uh by Matthew 5:48 there's a
[0:19] footnote I think nature of virtue were
[0:21] asking about the footnotes or the
[0:22] comments in the Bible remember we
[0:24] talking about that and so the footnote
[0:26] says scoffield said the word implies
[0:28] full development
[0:30] so Jesus said be ye therefore fully
[0:35] developed Jesus didn't say be ye
[0:37] therefore perfect and never sin again he
[0:39] never said that he said be therefore
[0:42] fully
[0:43] developed
[0:45] right the word implies full development
[0:47] growth into maturity of godliness in
[0:49] other words be therefore
[0:51] mature that's what he's saying don't be
[0:54] a baby Christian don't be a child
[0:56] Christian right when I became a man I
[0:58] put away out is things
[1:01] right not sinless Perfection scoffield
[1:05] says he says In this passage the
[1:08] father's kindness not his sinlessness is
[1:12] the point in
[1:13] question so we'll look at the context
[1:16] here right now so You' got your Bibles
[1:18] let's read it let's go to Matthew
[1:20] 5:43 so Jesus is not asking you and I to
[1:23] never sin that's not what he's asking us
[1:26] okay now does he want us to live as
[1:28] close to him as possible
[1:30] yes but he's not trying to make us feel
[1:33] condemned if we sin every day right and
[1:36] that's another one I'm not sure if we
[1:37] can make it through a whole day without
[1:38] sinning that's another one I'm not sure
[1:40] I'll say Amen because all things are
[1:41] possible to them that believe right it
[1:43] could be possible right um like I would
[1:47] think I would imagine on the day Enoch
[1:48] got raptured Elijah I would imagine they
[1:50] were pretty close to God right God was
[1:52] going to take them off the earth I I
[1:54] don't know how God could take them off
[1:55] the Earth in a sinful condition so
[1:57] imagine they were really close to God on
[1:59] those days
[2:00] and we don't know I'm not sure what time
[2:02] of the day they got
[2:04] raptured okay so Matthew 5:43 I think
[2:07] scoffield had a a good thought on
[2:10] this he says ye have heard that it have
[2:13] been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor
[2:15] and hate thine enemy but I say unto you
[2:17] love your enemies bless them that curse
[2:19] you do good to them that hate you and
[2:21] pray for them which despitefully use you
[2:24] and persecute you so let's stop right
[2:26] there a perfect Christian blesses those
[2:29] who curse them loves their enemies does
[2:33] good to them that hate them and pray for
[2:35] those who persecute you and despitefully
[2:37] use you in other words a mature
[2:39] Christian will love their
[2:42] enemies that's what this passage is
[2:44] about it's not about well I didn't sin
[2:46] yesterday or I didn't sin last week or I
[2:47] didn't sin whatever that's not what it's
[2:50] about it's about being a mature
[2:52] Christian having the kindness of Christ
[2:55] in fact actually it's the kindness of
[2:57] the heavenly father right now we know
[2:59] Christ CH was kind as well but this
[3:01] context is Jesus saying being be like
[3:03] the father who sends rain on the just
[3:05] and the
[3:06] unjust okay verse 45 that ye may be the
[3:10] children of your father which is in
[3:12] heaven for he maketh his son to rise on
[3:14] the evil and on the good and sendeth
[3:16] rain on the just and the unjust for if
[3:19] you love them which love you what reward
[3:21] have ye are you mature if you only love
[3:23] the people at
[3:25] church the people that patch on the back
[3:27] or hug you or Shake Your Hand are you
[3:30] are you mature if you just love the
[3:32] people that are kind to you no you're
[3:33] actually
[3:35] immature right people should know us
[3:36] right away wow that that person that
[3:38] sister that brother they can treat
[3:40] somebody really good who treats them
[3:42] really
[3:45] bad what reward do you have ver
[3:48] finishing verse 46 do not even the
[3:49] publicans the
[3:51] same now just bear with me Publican in
[3:55] the Greek means a tax collector or a
[3:58] toll collector
[4:01] they were detested not only by the Jews
[4:04] but by other nations also both on
[4:06] account of their employment and the
[4:08] harshness greed deception which they did
[4:11] on their job Jesus said even the harsh
[4:14] greedy deceivers are good to those that
[4:16] are good to
[4:18] them he said you got to be different you
[4:20] got to be more mature than a harsh
[4:22] greedy
[4:23] deceiver right because just loving the
[4:25] people that treat you good anybody can
[4:27] do
[4:28] that that's not maturity that's
[4:31] immaturity right verse uh 48 so then he
[4:35] said I'm sorry verse 47 and if you
[4:37] salute your brethren only what do ye
[4:39] more than others do not even the
[4:41] publicans so be therefore perfect even
[4:45] as your father which in is in heaven is
[4:48] perfect Hallelujah all right so the
[4:50] Greek definition of this of the word
[4:53] Perfection it's it's number uh 5046 it's
[4:57] brought to its finished end
[5:00] wanting nothing necessary to completely
[5:03] so it means you lack nothing Jesus says
[5:06] be therefore perfect other words be in a
[5:08] spot where you don't lack any anointing
[5:10] amen hallelujah praise God be in a spot
[5:14] where you're not lacking kindness we're
[5:16] not lacking uh love and
[5:18] mercy that's Perfection where you where
[5:21] you have enough of God's spirit to be
[5:23] kind to people that are awful to you
[5:27] that's perfection in other words be
[5:29] filled with the Holy Spirit
[5:31] Hallelujah it also means that which is
[5:34] perfect or complete it's
[5:37] consumate consummate human integrity and
[5:40] virtue so it's the highest level of
[5:42] Integrity it's the highest level of uh
[5:46] virtue there there's virtue there's I
[5:49] like how that name keeps coming up
[5:50] praise God we need a faith in here right
[5:53] we need a
[5:54] faith virtue now we need a knowledge in
[5:57] here and a Temperance in here surely we
[5:59] get a patience here one of these
[6:01] things
[6:02] Hallelujah it says it's the highest
[6:05] level of integrity and virtue of men
[6:07] full grown adult of full age
[6:11] mature so Jesus says be ye
[6:14] mature be ye lacking
[6:17] nothing even if someone deceptive or
[6:20] greedy or angry or someone would
[6:22] mistreat you you can show the love of
[6:24] God to them that's the context of what
[6:27] this is saying all right
[6:31] so Jesus is not talking about sinless
[6:32] perfection there's only one that could
[6:34] do that Hallelujah the one who's talking
[6:36] Hallelujah
[6:38] Jesus okay so Jesus is saying do not be
[6:40] a hypocrite and do not be like the
[6:42] Hypocrites be full with God's anointing
[6:46] who can be a mature Christian this means
[6:48] the publicans were just spiritual babies
[6:51] right they were spiritual babies if even
[6:53] they were spiritual at all they were
[6:55] just harsh greedy deceptive they could
[6:57] not love their enemies of course they
[6:59] had a lot of them right someone that
[7:01] would take your money you got a lot of
[7:03] enemies right for us it might be the
[7:05] modern day IRS agent or something like
[7:09] that but that that's what Jesus is
[7:11] saying in context it's saying we must be
[7:14] mature we must be filled with God's
[7:16] spirit we must have love or fruit that
[7:18] we can give to someone who's dishonest
[7:21] or deceptive or angry or or deceiver we
[7:24] must be able to be kind to them as
[7:26] well now before we move on to some more
[7:28] scriptures here's the foundational truth
[7:31] remember uh Romans 310: 111 say there's
[7:34] none righteous know not one there's none
[7:38] that understands there's none that
[7:39] seeketh after God so think about that
[7:41] brother brandham or Billy Graham or
[7:43] Martin Luther John Wesley none of these
[7:46] guys on their own sought after
[7:49] God no no matter the great Miracles or
[7:51] the great revivals none of them really
[7:53] sought after God God sought after them
[7:56] praise God in other words they weren't
[7:58] perfect brother Ram plainly tells us I
[8:01] wasn't perfect he Saidi not fit to live
[8:03] in in all sincerity he said I'm not
[8:04] saying that to be humble he says in this
[8:07] flesh in our flesh none of us are fit to
[8:09] live none of us are have sinless
[8:11] Perfection praise
[8:13] God the Bible said uh yeah there's none
[8:16] that seeketh that through
[8:17] God now also I love what Paul says you
[8:21] know Paul says that we should despite
[8:24] this We should strive to perfect
[8:26] Holiness in the fear of God in 2
[8:28] Corinthians 7:1 having therefore these
[8:30] promises dearly beloved let us cleanse
[8:32] ourselves from all filthiness so see
[8:34] Paul wants us to strive to always be
[8:37] free from
[8:39] filth right of the Flesh and of the
[8:41] spirit perfecting Holiness in the fear
[8:44] of God so it's the fear of God that will
[8:47] drive us to live as close to God as we
[8:49] can I don't want to I don't want to
[8:51] disappoint God I don't want to grieve
[8:52] God's spirit I want to please God
[8:55] hallelujah so we should have that desire
[8:58] I like to go a whole day with without
[8:59] sinning I like to go long time without
[9:02] sinning I don't want to be a slave to
[9:03] that and I actually heard a preacher say
[9:05] this not even the message but he said he
[9:06] said really you know when we say we're
[9:08] addicted really we're not and he gave a
[9:09] good illustration he gave an
[9:11] illustration of a man who's addicted to
[9:12] porn let's say he had his phone right
[9:14] there let's say he's in a room all by
[9:16] himself and then let's say he used the
[9:18] Isis guy now today to be a Hamas guy
[9:20] right and then let's say the man he's
[9:22] right there ready to click and he says
[9:24] well I'm addicted let's say a Hamas guy
[9:27] comes in with a hostage and said if you
[9:28] click on that this person's losing their
[9:30] life now are you
[9:32] addicted no so see how it's a deceptive
[9:36] Spirit see it's it's a spirit even
[9:38] making you think you're addicted you
[9:40] wouldn't be addicted if oh you'd throw
[9:42] the if the man or whatever was the woman
[9:44] they'd throw the phone away no spare the
[9:46] life spare the life I'm not that
[9:48] addicted so see it's the enemy's trick
[9:50] to make you to make us think sometimes
[9:52] we're addicted when really we're not
[9:54] we're just down in the dumps so maybe
[9:56] we're backlin and maybe we're weary but
[9:58] there's overcoming power there's a law
[10:00] of restoration for us amen
[10:02] hallelujah
[10:04] hallelujah see I thought that was a
[10:06] great illustration we say we're addicted
[10:07] or we're saying We Can't Stop but think
[10:09] about it you probably can now I know
[10:11] everybody here I'll say like this I know
[10:13] you can because you're real
[10:15] saints I know you you all are just not
[10:18] uh brother said you're not fresh
[10:19] recruits into the war of
[10:21] Christianity you ain't some fresh ones
[10:23] well well you just started the battle
[10:25] last week you're just learning how to
[10:26] fight you all know how to fight I'm not
[10:28] preaching in to babies Hallelujah
[10:31] neither is a baby preaching I know how
[10:32] to fight I know how to overcome but
[10:35] sometimes we just got to change our
[10:36] perspective Hallelujah we just need a
[10:37] mind that's transformed
[10:39] hallelujah amen
[10:42] hallelujah praise
[10:45] God and remember the Bible says we
[10:48] should have total sanctification in
[10:49] other words we should always strive to
[10:51] live a separate sanctification means a
[10:53] separated cleaned out life that's in 1
[10:55] Thessalonians 5:23 actually I'll read
[10:58] 5:22 abstain from all appearance of evil
[11:01] and that's what those weekend meetings
[11:02] do right they take up almost all of our
[11:04] time so we got to get our mind back on
[11:06] God I like that about the weekend
[11:08] meetings like
[11:09] that when we went to Brother cams in
[11:12] April I love that because it was just I
[11:13] was with my f my mother the whole time
[11:15] you know I was with I saw my dad I saw
[11:17] Mike mski I didn't have time to waste on
[11:20] the on the computer right I didn't have
[11:22] time to waste on my cell phone and with
[11:24] politics or news or anything it was just
[11:26] all Jesus all Jesus that's a great
[11:27] weekend praise God this this weekend was
[11:29] a great weekend praise God I like that
[11:31] when we can just give all of our time to
[11:33] God but the Bible say abstain from all
[11:36] appearance of evil and the Very God of
[11:38] Peace sanctify you partly no sanctify
[11:41] you wholly and I pray God your whole
[11:44] Spirit now that's your whole mind right
[11:46] your whole soul and body be preserved
[11:48] blameless under the coming of our Lord
[11:49] Jesus Christ and like this faithful are
[11:51] the
[11:52] Believers no Faithful Is He that called
[11:55] you who also do it praise God Amen don't
[11:59] forget Philippians 1:6 he that began a
[12:02] good work in you is faithful to complete
[12:04] it praise God like the Bible said he's
[12:06] going to keep you from falling
[12:08] Hallelujah he's going to keep you
[12:09] Sanctified he's going to keep you from
[12:11] evil just do your part just keep drawing
[12:14] n to God keep confessing sin keep
[12:16] serving God and God will sanctify you
[12:18] holy
[12:19] hallelujah amen I love what Paul says in
[12:22] Romans 717 he said now then it is no
[12:25] more I that do the sin but sin that
[12:27] dwell Within Me so on those days we get
[12:30] discouraged remember it wasn't really me
[12:32] that sinned the real me wouldn't do that
[12:35] hallelujah it's the sinful nature in me
[12:37] that does it but not the real me
[12:40] Hallelujah Verse 18 for I know that in
[12:43] me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good
[12:45] thing for to will is present with me but
[12:48] how to perform that which is good I find
[12:49] not in my flesh for the good that I
[12:52] would I do not but the evil which I
[12:54] would not that I do now if I do that I
[12:56] would not it is no more either do it but
[12:59] sin that dwelleth Within Me praise God I
[13:02] am not sin the real me is not a sinner
[13:05] the real me never sinned to begin with
[13:07] praise God Amen is that right the Bible
[13:10] says he that's born of God does not
[13:13] commit sin 1 John 3:9 whosoever is born
[13:15] of God does not commit sin for his seed
[13:18] remaineth in him he cannot sin because
[13:21] he's born of God that's why brother R
[13:23] said it's as if though you never did in
[13:25] the first place think about that when
[13:26] you get a new body you the sin is
[13:29] gone so it's going to be as if you never
[13:32] did it praise God you don't have the sin
[13:34] nature anymore you got a brand new
[13:35] glorified body hallelujah amen but
[13:38] you'll still remember your sin that you
[13:40] sin right because the Bible say you'll
[13:41] sing about the Redemption of the
[13:43] Lamb right the Saints in the in the in
[13:46] the Book of Revelation they sing uh
[13:48] Worthy is the Lamb who has redeemed us
[13:50] unto God out of every Kindred Nation
[13:52] tribe and tongue and people hallelujah
[13:54] amen so we have a body free from sin but
[13:57] our mind still remembers we did sin but
[13:59] I've been redeemed by the blood of the
[14:01] Lamb
[14:04] Hallelujah remember the Bible said we're
[14:06] to give all diligence 2 Corinthians 8:7
[14:09] it says therefore as you abound in
[14:11] everything in faith so see we should be
[14:13] growing in faith in utterance speaking
[14:16] the word and knowledge understanding and
[14:19] all diligence diligence is earnestness
[14:21] to accomplish
[14:23] something see Earnest to get to work
[14:25] Earnest to do something for God Earnest
[14:28] to invest in what God's placed in your
[14:29] life Hallelujah and in your love to us
[14:32] see that you abound abound in this Grace
[14:34] also of course that's the grace of
[14:36] giving charitably to people that are
[14:37] poor and then second Peter 1: 15 and
[14:40] beside this giving all diligence add to
[14:42] your faith my friend virtue and to
[14:44] Virtue knowledge Hallelujah so there's
[14:46] virtue again see giving all of your
[14:49] earnestness giving all of your
[14:52] motivation right give all your moot be
[14:54] motivated to add to your to let God add
[14:57] to your character amen how do you let
[14:59] how do you do that just open up and
[15:00] receive more of the word of God am fill
[15:03] your mind with the things of God right
[15:05] brother said it's like an animal eating
[15:07] right animals what do they do you ever
[15:08] watch our chickens what they just want
[15:09] to eat all day right they start off
[15:11] these little tiny peepers you keep
[15:13] feeding them no now they're pretty big
[15:15] by God's grace that's all they do is eat
[15:17] all day brother said that's what you are
[15:18] he said we the Bible calls us we'll be
[15:20] like Calves in the
[15:22] stall we will feed and feed and feed on
[15:25] the word that's what we got to do keep
[15:27] feeding and feeding on the word Malachi
[15:29] eats amen just eat like that guy but eat
[15:32] spiritual
[15:33] Hallelujah right keep eating keep
[15:36] enjoying the word keep saying amen keep
[15:38] feeding yourself keep meditating on the
[15:39] things of God and God will bless you
[15:41] Hallelujah that's how you'll grow keep
[15:44] eating on the word of
[15:47] God all right now that's just
[15:48] foundational that's maybe five minutes
[15:50] or 10 minutes on foundational things
[15:53] now um while you're uh turning there go
[15:56] to Hebrews 10 chapter I'm sorry Hebrews
[15:58] 10 Hebrews chapter 10 sorry verse one
[16:01] I'm going to read a quote from brother
[16:02] Brandon so I'm I'm really shortening
[16:05] this for time's sake because it's it's
[16:07] not necessarily a super deep thing but I
[16:09] want you to see how brother brandom
[16:12] answers this question he preached it
[16:14] mostly in the
[16:15] 1950s he would say Jesus asked you to be
[16:18] perfect how can I do it think about that
[16:22] you ever did you ever think that when
[16:23] you read that verse how am I going to be
[16:24] perfect like God maybe if I work really
[16:27] hard you know
[16:29] May if I get really legalistic I could
[16:31] be perfect of course Jesus doesn't want
[16:34] us to be legalistic right he doesn't
[16:35] want to we're not supposed to add to the
[16:36] word of God legalism is adding to the
[16:38] word of God but you know I'm sure we've
[16:40] all read that and said well how can I be
[16:41] perfect Lord I'm trying I'm doing my
[16:43] best that's all God wants is your best
[16:45] Hallelujah and he's not asking for
[16:47] sinless Perfection he's asking for
[16:49] maturity he's asking for you and I to be
[16:52] able to give kindness when people don't
[16:54] deserve it he's asking us to have a
[16:57] level of love and compassion that
[16:59] Sinners don't have in other words he's
[17:01] asking us to be what we're called to be
[17:04] Christians all right so Hebrews
[17:08] 101 now while you're there I'm going to
[17:10] read
[17:14] this he says now what this is from uh
[17:17] the law having a shadow 1954 what's the
[17:20] subject Paul's speaking of here
[17:21] Perfection he said God requires
[17:25] Perfection no one could ever come to
[17:27] Heaven outside of being perfect you must
[17:29] be perfect and yet the scripture says no
[17:31] one is perfect so if you must be perfect
[17:33] to come to heaven then the scripture
[17:35] says None is perfect we've all sin and
[17:37] come short of the glory of God read that
[17:38] tonight how we ever going to enter God's
[17:41] living place and Dwelling Place when he
[17:44] uh requires Perfection isn't that a good
[17:47] question Heaven requires Perfection
[17:49] right Jesus said believe in me and The
[17:51] Sermon on the Mount he said be therefore
[17:53] perfect as your father in Heaven is
[17:56] perfect think of the Perfection that God
[17:57] requires of a person a
[18:00] Perfection
[18:02] Hallelujah so brother R said he he kind
[18:04] of dramatizes it and then brother raham
[18:06] goes to the Old Testament brother Ram
[18:08] would dramatize it like this I'm just
[18:09] going to paraphrase it brother Braham
[18:11] said the Old Testament sinner he would
[18:13] come he would bring his lamb or his
[18:14] bulock or whatever he had he would bring
[18:17] that he would offer it uh he would you
[18:20] know the Bible said he'd lay his hands
[18:21] on the sacrifice the sins would transfer
[18:23] from The Sinner to the sacrifice they'd
[18:26] cut the throat of the animal let's say
[18:27] it's a bu
[18:29] and then the bulock would shed its blood
[18:31] and then they they give they cut it in
[18:33] pieces if it was a peace offering sin
[18:35] offering I preached on that a few years
[18:36] ago you know each offering had a purpose
[18:39] the Bible said The Sinner here The
[18:41] Sinner his sins went on the sacrifice
[18:43] the sacrifice died and now God said now
[18:46] The Sinner Is Forgiven but brother said
[18:49] then the but the sinner although he's
[18:50] forgiven he would leave with the same
[18:54] desires right because the blood of bulls
[18:56] and goats could never take away the the
[18:58] conscience of
[19:00] sin okay so they'd be forgiven or their
[19:03] sins would be covered over forgiven but
[19:05] the sinner would leave there still
[19:07] defiled right in his mind knowing I'm
[19:10] going to go back there but church we
[19:11] don't have to go back all the time
[19:13] hallelujah amen we don't have to go back
[19:15] Hallelujah I've never gone back to
[19:16] smoking Hallelujah never gone back to
[19:19] drinking
[19:20] Hallelujah never gone back to a lot of
[19:22] awful things why because we have a
[19:24] different sacrifice now we have an all
[19:27] sufficient sacrifice hallelujah amen
[19:30] hallelujah in church in other words
[19:32] we'll never go back to the major sins
[19:34] yes we'll have minor sins we'll be
[19:35] tempted tried tested sometimes for life
[19:38] like brother man was tested by that
[19:39] critical prideful Spirit almost his
[19:40] entire life but he finally got victory
[19:43] over it praise God when he got a new
[19:45] body
[19:47] Hallelujah now Hebrews 10:1 for the law
[19:50] having a shadow of good things to come
[19:51] and not the very image of the things can
[19:53] never with those sacrifices which they
[19:55] offered year by year continually make
[19:57] the comers there unto
[19:59] perfect for then would they not have
[20:01] ceased to be offered because that the
[20:04] worshippers once Pur should have had no
[20:06] more conscience of
[20:08] sin hallelujah look at verse three but
[20:11] in those sacrifices there is a
[20:13] remembrance again made of sins every
[20:16] year now church I have found this honest
[20:19] to God in my life there are so many sins
[20:22] I even forgot I
[20:26] did think about that first for a
[20:29] moment I'll go out to a restaurant and
[20:31] I'll hear a song like oh yeah I used to
[20:33] rock to that song and do a lot of evil
[20:34] things with that song but I forgotten
[20:37] about it the blood of Jesus Christ had
[20:40] taken away the remembrance of that
[20:44] hallelujah praise God hallelujah that
[20:47] was impossible under the blood of bulls
[20:48] and goats but with the blood of Jesus
[20:51] Christ now it's as if we get a fresh
[20:53] start we be we get a new life amen
[20:56] hallelujah and I'll say like this the
[20:58] longer we serve God the further those
[21:01] things will feel away praise God
[21:03] hallelujah they'll really feel like
[21:05] they're separated as far as the East is
[21:07] from the West praise
[21:09] [Applause]
[21:11] God it's happened numerous time you know
[21:14] uh these last few weeks you know uh we
[21:17] go to different restaurants and heard
[21:19] these songs and my wife are like oh
[21:20] that's right I remember that song you
[21:21] know bring back certain memories I'm
[21:23] like wow and then my brother was telling
[21:24] me some things where we were with my
[21:26] brother and I was like wow I for forgot
[21:28] I even did that I thought I forgot that
[21:30] ever happened I thought wow that was the
[21:32] blood of Jesus
[21:34] Christ right because we were before
[21:36] we're chained to those things but Jesus
[21:38] is the chain breaker Hallelujah he
[21:41] breaks all those chains and then there
[21:42] can be a forgetfulness of sin praise God
[21:46] not a remembrance of sin but a
[21:48] forgetfulness of sin
[21:50] Hallelujah I see I'll say like this
[21:52] you've heard it before probably right
[21:54] but if God can forget about our past
[21:55] sins why can't we the the fact is we can
[21:59] amen hallelujah just keep applying the
[22:02] blood keep drawing closer to God see the
[22:03] closer you get to God the further those
[22:05] things get away from
[22:07] you that's what the purpose of the blood
[22:09] of Christ was to make us forget about
[22:12] our old sin to separate us from our sin
[22:14] and make us new creatures in Christ
[22:16] Jesus
[22:20] Hallelujah now skip down to verse
[22:26] 10 now it goes through the animal
[22:29] sacrifices but in verse 10 he says by
[22:31] the which will we are Sanctified through
[22:33] the offering of the body of Jesus Christ
[22:36] once for all one sacrifice did all the
[22:40] sanctifying amen one death did all the
[22:44] cleaning out praise God not every year
[22:46] we got to come back now see that's what
[22:48] we got to make sure we don't got to make
[22:49] sure I just have Revival every time we
[22:51] have Revival Services we can have
[22:52] Revival every time Hallelujah we can
[22:54] have Revival anytime we want it praise
[22:56] God
[22:59] Hallelujah we don't it just see we can't
[23:01] make an attrition well we can only have
[23:02] Revival next summer it can't be like
[23:05] that we can have Revival any time we
[23:06] want praise God it takes a repentance of
[23:09] sin it takes a drawing night to God
[23:11] remember the three things brother said
[23:13] we must have these things to be on fire
[23:14] for God a fervent desire to please him a
[23:17] passion to know his word and a reaching
[23:18] out in the spirit praise God
[23:23] hallelujah so we see it now brother ad
[23:25] says he says how can you be perfect he
[23:28] said oh let's get it and then he reads
[23:29] down to Hebrews
[23:32] 10:14 everybody's everybody should be
[23:34] really staring down there hold up so you
[23:37] want to hear that you want to see the
[23:38] Revelation brother R used this is in the
[23:40] laws of shadow of good things to come
[23:42] 1954 brother says oh let's get it let's
[23:44] see what is your Perfection
[23:47] glory for by one offering he hath
[23:50] perfected forever bride of Christ
[23:52] Fellowship that are Sanctified
[23:54] Hallelujah let's apply to your life amen
[24:00] Hallelujah that's what he's done the
[24:03] blood perfects us as far as forgives all
[24:05] of our sins it say like this the spirit
[24:08] of the blood matures us amen the spirit
[24:11] doesn't make us babies and immature the
[24:13] spirit makes us real men and women who
[24:14] are mature in Christ Jesus hallelujah
[24:17] amen that love our enemies will be good
[24:19] to those that despitefully use us will
[24:21] bless those who curse
[24:23] us that's what the spirit of Christ
[24:25] that's what Jesus is saying be perfect
[24:27] be mature sure I want you to know there
[24:29] is a different meaning for Perfection
[24:31] and that is all sins are
[24:33] forgiven so I say like this I'm both
[24:36] Perfection you are both uh definitions
[24:40] of perfection you're perfect because you
[24:42] have no more sin and you're perfectly
[24:44] mature
[24:45] hallelujah hallelujah you got both
[24:49] definitions both are for you if you're
[24:51] trusting in Jesus Christ brother this is
[24:54] the answer to that question how can I be
[24:56] perfect God requires Perfection to get
[24:59] to heaven this is how I can be perfect I
[25:01] get Jesus's Perfection Hallelujah he
[25:04] took my sin that I might get his
[25:06] Perfection Hallelujah am amen he said
[25:09] that's the only way anybody gets to
[25:11] Heaven
[25:11] hallelujah it's through the Perfection
[25:13] of Jesus Christ Our Lord how many glad
[25:16] you're perfect
[25:17] tonight oh thank
[25:21] God now there's get your Bibles there's
[25:23] 17 other I'm sorry there's 16 other
[25:26] verses that use this Greek word perfect
[25:29] which means we have to have a full age
[25:31] we got to be fully developed
[25:33] Christians
[25:35] right so let's go through these so you
[25:38] can see how this word is used it doesn't
[25:42] mean I've I don't sin today now you you
[25:45] want to try not to sin today you want to
[25:48] try to make it out of the service
[25:49] without sinning by God's grace right
[25:50] help us Jesus
[25:53] Hallelujah but that's not what Jesus is
[25:55] saying he we know the scriptures says
[25:57] we're already Perfect by the blood of
[25:59] Jesus Christ in other words all of our
[26:01] sins there's no record in heaven
[26:02] remember the Bible said they're nailed
[26:04] to the cross of Jesus Hallelujah
[26:05] remember Colossians 2 that's one of my
[26:07] favorite chapters Hallelujah they're
[26:09] already nailed the the the the all the
[26:11] sins were already nailed to the cross
[26:13] Jesus already triumphs over all the sins
[26:16] remember the Bible said Satan would not
[26:19] have crucified Jesus if he known what it
[26:21] would have produce what it produce it
[26:23] prod It produced perfect Christians amen
[26:26] hallelujah It produced Christians that
[26:29] he can't bring an accusation against
[26:31] Hallelujah because it's under the blood
[26:33] hallelujah amen he would not have done
[26:37] that and not only that now we get
[26:38] eternal life Hallelujah and now we get
[26:41] power to drive him out hallelujah oh he
[26:44] would not have done that right because
[26:46] it divide up the Holy Spirit into 120
[26:49] licks of fire praise God and put that
[26:51] same anointing that was on Jesus upon us
[26:53] and church it's on us tonight hallelujah
[26:56] amen how do you know because you're
[26:58] walking after the spirit not after the
[27:00] flesh right you didn't come here to get
[27:02] a million dollars that would have been
[27:04] walking after the
[27:05] flesh you didn't come here for any
[27:07] sinful purpose you came here because you
[27:10] love Jesus amen you're walking after the
[27:12] spirit that proves you're led by the
[27:14] spirit Hallelujah that's what brother
[27:16] Ram uses that's the quotes I got all
[27:18] these quotes on here I could read but
[27:20] I'll say with the scripture just for now
[27:22] and get to a few quotes at the end I'm
[27:23] almost done it's almost 8 o'clock by
[27:25] God's
[27:26] grace that's pre is learning a little
[27:28] lesson this preacher is fully developing
[27:29] on how to be uh not so long winded on a
[27:33] Wednesday night when everybody's got to
[27:34] work and everything like that there's a
[27:36] time for long winded Services there's
[27:38] certainly time for
[27:40] that uh the first one's Matthew 19:20
[27:42] this so Cas I'm going to need you to be
[27:43] super fast
[27:45] here the Rich Young Ruler Jesus told the
[27:47] Rich Young Ruler to be perfect but he
[27:49] wasn't saying never
[27:51] sin he was saying be more mature you
[27:54] kept some some Commandments but you need
[27:56] to sell everything you need be mature
[27:58] and not think money is your way to get
[27:59] to heaven you have to understand money
[28:01] is not going to make your life
[28:03] successful it's did you obey
[28:06] Christ yeah with your money but also
[28:09] with every in his case a preaching gift
[28:10] he neglected his preaching
[28:12] gift okay the young man said to him all
[28:15] these things have I kept from my youth
[28:16] up what lack I yet look brother said
[28:18] look he knew he lacked Jesus said to him
[28:20] if thou will be perfect so if you'll be
[28:22] more mature go and sell that thou Hast
[28:25] and give it to the poor and thou shalt
[28:26] have treasure in and come and follow me
[28:30] he loved his riches more than he loved
[28:32] his call to preach right and Jesus said
[28:34] if you want to be mature you got to sell
[28:36] all that you got to follow me of course
[28:38] we know he he went Jesus Jesus rebuked
[28:41] him and he went away sorrowful but Jesus
[28:42] even loved him the Bible said another
[28:44] place Jesus loved this man and that will
[28:46] help you church when that voice told
[28:48] Brother brandom All That You Ever Loved
[28:50] is here in heaven we got to care be
[28:52] careful how we interpret that because
[28:53] Jesus loved this rich man and then
[28:55] brother BR said this rich man was in
[28:56] hell
[28:58] so even that's right even Jesus loved a
[29:02] man and that man couldn't get to he
[29:04] couldn't get to heaven so we got to be
[29:06] careful how we interpret brother man's
[29:07] Visions I know you're good with that I I
[29:10] just want to share that a fresh if you
[29:11] haven't heard that lately all right
[29:13] Romans 12:2 and be not conformed to this
[29:16] world but be ye transformed by the
[29:18] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[29:19] what is that good acceptable and what
[29:21] perfect will of God so this is the
[29:23] definition the highest virtue and
[29:25] integrity virtue
[29:28] that's what this
[29:30] means prove the highest level of
[29:33] Integrity on the will of God prove that
[29:37] right prove that this is God's will for
[29:39] you this is God's uh level of virtue for
[29:43] you this is God's level of uh Integrity
[29:46] prove that's the will of God the perfect
[29:48] will of God okay see so I hope that
[29:53] helps there by God's grace next one um
[29:56] First Corinthians Ians 2:6 I like this
[29:58] one how be it we speak wisdom of among
[30:01] them that are perfect that doesn't mean
[30:05] they never
[30:07] sinned now this one means mature yet not
[30:11] the wisdom of this world nor the princes
[30:12] of this world that come to not but we
[30:15] speak the wisdom of God in a mystery
[30:18] even the hidden wisdom which God
[30:19] ordained before the world unto our glory
[30:22] and what was all the wisdom in here it
[30:23] was the preaching on communion preaching
[30:26] on hair it was preaching on the gifts of
[30:28] the Spirit tongues that was the wisdom
[30:30] of God that we speak in a mystery praise
[30:34] God
[30:36] hallelujah so see we can only speak the
[30:39] word of God to them that are
[30:42] mature
[30:44] right
[30:46] Hallelujah now now remember when
[30:48] remember when we went to akan uh the
[30:49] First Baptist church I preached a deeper
[30:53] Doctrine right and what what the pastor
[30:55] say I'm walking on clouds he said
[30:57] said that's the wisdom of God most
[31:00] churches would not accept that preaching
[31:02] it's a good thing he's not really he
[31:04] didn't go to Seminary Paul didn't did
[31:05] you know that that's why I like to go
[31:07] preach for him he didn't go to
[31:10] cemetery right so that's why I can
[31:12] preach I can preach a and the baptism of
[31:15] Holy Ghost is a mystery the Bible says I
[31:17] can go in there and preach I can preach
[31:18] the mystery to them that are perfect
[31:20] Hallelujah then that are mature and the
[31:23] mature ones will catch it in other words
[31:24] they'll go for more the Holy Ghost I
[31:26] don't know how many Baptists were mature
[31:27] there but I know we are
[31:29] Hallelujah see
[31:31] that preach those deeper things of God
[31:34] that's the wisdom of God we speak in a
[31:37] mystery but I'm sure a lot of those
[31:38] people Church don't you think a lot of
[31:39] those people just went right over their
[31:40] head well what's he talking about the
[31:42] mind the body the what's he what's he
[31:44] putting those crazy licks of fire those
[31:46] paper licks of fire on him like that why
[31:47] is he doing that that's so silly but
[31:49] it's a
[31:51] truth all right now it go to 1
[31:55] Corinthians 13 uh verse
[31:59] verse um
[32:01] 8 now this is a greatly misunderstood
[32:04] scripture among message people because
[32:06] they asked brother brandom in 1964 does
[32:08] does this apply to his ministry and he
[32:10] said yes now that's the only quote on
[32:14] this and I'll explain it what I mean
[32:16] here charity never fails but whether
[32:18] there be prophecies they shall fail
[32:20] whether there be tongues they shall
[32:21] cease whether there be knowledge it
[32:23] shall vanish vanish away for we know in
[32:26] part and we Pro phes in part but when
[32:28] that which is perfect has come then that
[32:30] which is in part shall be done away with
[32:32] now stop right there message people will
[32:34] say see we have the perfect Revelation
[32:37] so we don't need gifts anymore and
[32:38] that's a
[32:39] lie see they misinterpret this quote or
[32:42] this
[32:44] scripture see when that which is perfect
[32:46] is come
[32:48] now here perfect has the meaning of when
[32:51] we see Jesus face to face so look at the
[32:55] next verse when I was a child spake as a
[32:57] child I understood as a child I thought
[32:58] as a child when I became a man I put
[33:00] away childish things so Paul's saying
[33:01] there is going to come a day we'll put
[33:03] away the gifts but that day is not today
[33:05] amen hallelujah verse 12 for now we see
[33:09] through a glass Darkly so see we
[33:11] prophesy we dream dreams we we have
[33:13] gifts and we pretty sure they're right
[33:17] right but then we'll be face to face
[33:20] with Jesus now I know Paul says I know
[33:23] in part he wrote most of the New
[33:25] Testament and he says I know part of the
[33:28] thing I know part of
[33:29] it but then shall I know even also as I
[33:33] am known okay so this is speaking of
[33:35] when that which is perfect is come when
[33:37] the glorified bodies come then we'll see
[33:39] Jesus face to face and then we know
[33:41] won't need gifts anymore because our
[33:43] body all the sin will be gone Hallelujah
[33:45] we'll have perfect bodies we'll be a
[33:47] perfect being we'll be without sin
[33:50] Hallelujah but some people will say well
[33:52] see brother braham's messag has come
[33:54] brother braham's message is perfect so
[33:55] we don't need gifts anymore that's a Lie
[33:57] from Hell brother said in the church age
[33:59] book the gifts remain until Jesus comes
[34:01] back Hallelujah and we're still waiting
[34:03] on Jesus how many still looking for
[34:05] Jesus
[34:06] hallelujah hallelujah uh go to 1
[34:09] Corinthians 14:20 Brethren be not
[34:11] children in understanding how be it in
[34:13] Malice be ye children but in
[34:15] understanding be men now that word men
[34:17] is the word perfect that Jesus used be
[34:19] ye therefore mature so Paul says he says
[34:22] in understanding be
[34:25] mature right understand the Bible
[34:29] Hallelujah all right next Ephesians 4 uh
[34:32] verse 11 of course is the fivefold
[34:34] ministry Ephesians 4:12 the fivefold
[34:37] ministry is for the perfecting of the
[34:38] saints that doesn't mean they never sin
[34:41] it means they're
[34:42] mature so being around five-fold
[34:45] Ministry preachers real five-fold
[34:47] Ministry preachers if you believe what
[34:48] they say you'll become more mature as a
[34:50] Christian how many can say Amen to that
[34:53] Hallelujah some of you wrote me letters
[34:54] the Pastor bation said you've learned so
[34:56] much much to the preaching I said praise
[34:58] God hallelujah that proves it right
[35:00] there the real preaching in the fivefold
[35:02] ministry makes you more mature makes you
[35:05] closer to God
[35:06] hallelujah that's exactly
[35:11] right and actually if you go down to
[35:13] verse 15 in case well I guess 13 to we
[35:15] all come in the unity of faith and the
[35:16] knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[35:18] perfect man see it doesn't mean now I'm
[35:20] sinless it means I'm a mature
[35:22] person unto the measure of the stature
[35:25] of the fullness of Christ so there's a
[35:27] certain measure of Christ's character
[35:29] that you can
[35:30] attain think about that Jesus got
[35:32] slapped on the face there's a certain
[35:34] measure that you could attain to that
[35:36] someone might slap you someone might
[35:37] hurt you we don't know someone might
[35:39] spit on you and you could stand there
[35:41] and love them right brother Brooks told
[35:43] this story I don't know if you remember
[35:44] back in April I don't know if you
[35:45] remember this sister Zur sister who or
[35:47] sister Naomi brother Brooks said he was
[35:49] at an ATM and but brother Brooks is a
[35:52] black man and he said this white man
[35:54] walked up and started cussing him out
[35:55] blankety blankety blank like you've been
[35:57] at the ATM too long I'm trying to get my
[35:58] money out and brother brother Brook said
[36:00] the anointing of the Holy Ghost come
[36:02] over him and this guy probably started
[36:03] using some racist language and brother
[36:05] Brook said I looked at the man and I
[36:07] felt sorry for him and I loved
[36:09] him and he said oh I'm sorry sir I'll
[36:12] try to move on as fast as I can now can
[36:14] you imagine that now how many of us
[36:16] would say let me tell you something I
[36:17] want to tell you talk to me like that
[36:20] brother Brook said the Holy Ghost he
[36:22] said It felt come down the anointing and
[36:24] he said I I'm sorry I'll try to go on as
[36:26] fast as I can
[36:30] Church
[36:31] said that's maturity right there now
[36:34] it's brother brother Brook's perfect no
[36:36] well he's Perfect by the blood let me
[36:37] get that in there he's Perfect by the
[36:39] blood but he's not sinless
[36:42] Perfection right every day he's maturing
[36:46] though and the Saints said so are you so
[36:49] are you
[36:52] Hallelujah and now look at verse 15 but
[36:55] speaking the truth in love

[37:21] forgetting those things which are behind
[37:22] we're going to coming up on the New Year
[37:23] pretty soon I'll probably use this
[37:24] scripture right brother brother used
[37:26] scripture forgetting those things of
[37:28] 2023 and reaching forth under those
[37:30] things which are before I press toward
[37:33] the mark for the prize of the High
[37:35] Calling of God in Christ Jesus I'm going
[37:36] to forget this any mistakes from last
[37:38] year and I'm going to press on and I'm
[37:40] going to try to win the prize
[37:42] Hallelujah next verse
[37:44] 15 let us therefore as many as
[37:47] be mature that doesn't mean I never made
[37:50] a mistake last year he actually just
[37:52] said forget your past sins right he just
[37:55] said forget the past right
[37:58] and the blood of Christ will help you do
[37:59] that hallelujah amen you have you have a
[38:03] you you don't remember the sins right
[38:05] the sins are under the blood all you
[38:07] think about is the goodness of God
[38:09] hallelujah amen think about that went
[38:10] through four Services we never saying
[38:12] the goodness of God wow that's quite an
[38:14] accomplishment
[38:17] there every church I hear things I'm
[38:19] like oh hear it again there it is again
[38:20] there's again God is good though
[38:22] hallelujah
[38:23] amen but see as many as are mature be
[38:26] thus minded that if anything be
[38:28] otherwise minded God shall reveal this
[38:30] even to you anything you need to know
[38:33] God will reveal it to you praise God
[38:35] Amen I like
[38:40] that uh in uh Colossians 1: 27- 28 in
[38:44] verse 27 Paul says Christ in you the
[38:46] hope of glory that's the mystery of the
[38:48] baptism of the Holy Ghost verse 28 whom
[38:49] we preach warning every man and teaching
[38:52] every man in all wisdom that ye may
[38:53] present every man perfect in Christ
[38:57] Jesus again Paul wants us to present
[39:00] people
[39:01] mature I like that both Jim and brother
[39:05] Cam said it's easy to preach to your
[39:07] church brother Jesse I said Hallelujah
[39:10] can I get a high five sister you're
[39:11] right can I get a high
[39:13] five Jim said I didn't feel any
[39:16] resistance while preaching that's why he
[39:18] looked like a 20-y old guy I mean
[39:21] 42 and then brother brother Cam said the
[39:23] same you saw him Jump Around Here cam
[39:25] cam sweating and everything
[39:27] he didn't feel any
[39:29] hindrances and then they they loved the
[39:31] worship as well see church maybe you
[39:34] don't know it but maybe I'm just let you
[39:35] know you're a mature
[39:37] church we don't have these sins and
[39:39] problems like these other churches Thank
[39:41] God now we got we got we're not perfect
[39:43] but let me say this we're growing up
[39:45] into Christ into all things praise God
[39:48] remember brother dig says the same thing
[39:50] I go to all these churches they just
[39:51] want the choir to sing but I come to
[39:52] your church and you want to worship the
[39:55] church wants to worship it's easy to
[39:57] preach to you you're not you're not
[39:59] grieving the Holy Spirit say no we don't
[40:01] want I don't really want to be here you
[40:03] want to be here you love the word of God
[40:04] you're feeding on God's word God is with
[40:07] you you're mature Church hallelujah
[40:12] amen Paul wanted to to present every man
[40:15] perfect mature in Christ
[40:21] Jesus Colossians 4:12 epis one day maybe
[40:24] there'll be a boy named epis around here
[40:27] who is one of you a servant of Christ
[40:28] saluteth you always laboring fervently
[40:31] for you in prayers that ye may stand
[40:34] perfect mature and complete in all the
[40:37] will of
[40:39] God remember that's a great prayer to
[40:41] pray if you want to pray for somebody
[40:43] pray that they'll be in the perfect will
[40:44] of God that's a real sincere this is a
[40:47] holy ghost filled man epif he started
[40:49] the church in colassa remember he
[40:51] started the church well no wonder he
[40:52] wanted them to be in the perfect will of
[40:55] God right he wanted them mature he like
[40:58] the Bible said you don't want to be a
[40:59] baby tossed around by every wind of
[41:04] Doctrine right like for example like
[41:06] with Divine Healing somebody could toss
[41:08] you around you could toss on this side
[41:09] just speak it just speak it you speak it
[41:11] for a while it doesn't work then you get
[41:13] tossed around just get anointed with oil
[41:14] and every every time you get anointed
[41:16] with oil you're just tossed back and
[41:17] forth which one do you go which one do
[41:19] you go the thing is get a revelation
[41:21] first get a revelation what is the will
[41:23] of God
[41:24] hallelujah see that
[41:26] see see I mean that's just one example
[41:28] now we all we all gone through that and
[41:30] it's normal to go through but as we
[41:32] mature we realize brother BR said the
[41:34] first thing is find the will of God and
[41:38] all these preachers you know have have
[41:40] missed uh have missed the will of God
[41:42] call they call themselves the greatest
[41:43] of all time the most powerful men of all
[41:45] time and they never do the first thing
[41:48] so if they're wrong on the first thing
[41:50] about Divine Healing what else are they
[41:51] wrong on if they can't get to the first
[41:54] base on Divine Healing to find the
[41:55] perfect will of God or to find the will
[41:57] of God or seek the will of God what are
[41:59] they missing on other things well
[42:01] they're missing a lot of things right
[42:03] especially with pride and so forth like
[42:05] that but see we don't want to be tossed
[42:07] we don't want to be children we want to
[42:08] be mature we want to grow up in the word
[42:10] of
[42:13] God
[42:17] hallelujah all right almost 8 o'clock my
[42:19] goodness this might have to be a part
[42:20] two next Wednesday
[42:22] here we see how work help me Jesus help
[42:25] me
[42:28] help me
[42:29] Lord yeah I didn't really get to any of
[42:30] the quotes So maybe I'll preach a part
[42:32] two um but I just wanted you to see
[42:34] these these are the same uh uses of the
[42:37] word perfect in 16 other
[42:40] verses Jesus is not saying you got to be
[42:42] perfect why aren't you perfect today M
[42:44] okay be like your heavenly father not
[42:47] your Earthly
[42:48] father lyia why'd you do that today you
[42:51] weren't perfect today that's not what
[42:53] he's
[42:54] saying saying be mature M and you know
[42:57] what a mature person does when they sin
[42:59] they say God forgive me that's my mature
[43:01] and God help me not to do that again
[43:04] help me by your grace that's what a
[43:06] mature person does right they confess
[43:08] their sins and then who's faithful
[43:10] Christ is faithful to cleanse us from
[43:12] all
[43:15] unrighteousness so spiritual maturity is
[43:18] perfection according to the Bible isn't
[43:19] that interesting that's the word Jesus
[43:21] chose he could have used you know
[43:23] pristine or he could have used beautiful
[43:26] tremendous or
[43:28] Masterpiece he could use any of these
[43:30] words but he says be
[43:33] perfect be mature in other words have
[43:37] everything you need get ready so you
[43:39] don't you're not lacking anything when
[43:41] somebody mistreat you be ready to have
[43:45] some love some kindness to repay their
[43:47] evil with good we don't overcome evil
[43:50] with evil We Come O we overcome evil
[43:53] with good that's a perfect Christian
[43:56] that's a mature Christian I'll close
[43:59] with this one here it's already
[44:02] 8:00 uh first John 4:17 I want everybody
[44:06] to read this the last verse I promise
[44:08] unless the Lord leads me
[44:10] somewh first John
[44:13] 47 it's been really easy to preach you
[44:15] tonight because everybody's polling
[44:16] tonight by God's grace I haven't felt
[44:18] any resistance the Revival is still long
[44:20] hallelujah thank you Jesus Hallelujah
[44:23] glory amen I felt no resistance
[44:28] now this will hopefully help us here
[44:30] here in is our love made it's not it's
[44:32] not saying well I love God all the time
[44:33] I never sin it's just
[44:35] mature here's how our love is made
[44:38] mature that we may have boldness in the
[44:40] day of judgment it's not because well I
[44:42] didn't sin the last year of my life now
[44:45] I'm ready for the Judgment no that's
[44:49] impossible because as he is so are we in
[44:53] this world wow what a statement Amen in
[44:55] other words God's looking at us through
[44:56] the blood of Jesus Christ right he looks
[45:00] through red the red blood of Jesus and
[45:01] sees us in our white
[45:03] robes the blood of Christ Verse
[45:06] 18 there is no fear in
[45:09] love but perfect love casteth out fear
[45:15] now doesn't this give a new
[45:16] understanding of the
[45:17] scripture perfect love doesn't mean well
[45:20] I I loved everybody perfect today
[45:22] because surely you
[45:24] didn't right
[45:26] if you're honest with yourself you mean
[45:28] you gave money to every poor person you
[45:31] passed on the way
[45:33] here you mean you gave a smile to
[45:35] everyone who got mad at you on the drive
[45:38] here all day every day this whole day so
[45:41] it doesn't mean perfect love like oh I
[45:44] was perfect all day now I can cast out
[45:45] fear it means mature love will look at
[45:48] the situation and say yes my in my sin I
[45:51] feel fear but I can cast that out amen
[45:54] because I've got a greater one that's in
[45:55] me than he that's in the world
[45:58] Hallelujah right we talked about this
[46:00] before a wave of fear goes over over us
[46:02] every time we get those Amber Alerts
[46:05] like or tornado oh Lord have mercy right
[46:09] it's natural fear just rushes over you
[46:12] but if you have a mature love amen
[46:15] pretty soon you'll say ah I can't worry
[46:16] about this I got to pray about this
[46:19] Hallelujah and that's perfect mature
[46:22] love will eventually cast out that fear
[46:24] Hallelujah and that's why we said House
[46:27] of Hell spirit of fear give way to the
[46:30] name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah you you
[46:33] can hold you know those people in the
[46:34] Bible they had sicknesses for 18 years
[46:36] blood issue for 18 years all these
[46:38] things see had held them for a while but
[46:40] eventually perfect love mature love cast
[46:43] out all the fear Hallelujah and they
[46:45] said House of Hell give way I'm touching
[46:48] Jesus's garment and the Bible said as
[46:50] soon as she did the blood dried up in
[46:52] her and she got her healing and cast out
[46:54] all fear Hallelujah am she have to worry
[46:57] anymore I'm out of money I can't afford
[46:59] medicine Jesus was her medicine
[47:02] hallelujah
[47:04] amen and that perfect mature Love by
[47:07] Revelation right that was a
[47:10] revelation the perfect re the revelation
[47:13] of that gave her perfect peace right we
[47:15] say per mature mature Faith to cast out
[47:18] all the
[47:20] fear because you you know what because
[47:22] fear has torment Jesus doesn't call us
[47:25] to live in torment of fear or torment of
[47:28] anything
[47:29] guilt right greed and bitterness Jesus
[47:33] doesn't call us to live in that we can
[47:35] cast that out the window
[47:37] Hallelujah we can cast it out in Jesus
[47:40] name he that fearth is not made mature
[47:44] in
[47:45] love see in other words if we constantly
[47:48] live in fear we're fearful all the day
[47:51] long fearful about
[47:52] everything right if we're just fearful
[47:54] all the time that person person's not
[47:56] maturing in love but as we mature God is
[47:59] helping us to overcome all of our fears
[48:01] how many can say Amen to that amen let's
[48:03] stand to our feet musicians can come I
[48:06] went a little over 8 o'clock I'm at 8:04
[48:08] now so please don't hold against me I
[48:10] trust you enjoyed that last verse there
[48:12] by God's grace now why did I preach that
[48:14] because brother Ram said this in 1960
[48:17] thus sayith the Lord it'll take perfect
[48:18] love to put you to that
[48:20] place thus sayith the lord well that
[48:22] that's the scripture perfect love mature
[48:25] love has has to cast out all
[48:30] fear brother Bram said because that's
[48:32] all was there brother BR went beyond the
[48:33] curtain of time remember all the women
[48:35] ran to him first and that interesting
[48:36] all the women ran to him he was called a
[48:39] woman hater and all the women came first
[48:41] we love you
[48:43] brother they said we would not have been
[48:45] here unless you come and preach and then
[48:47] the brothers came next ladies
[48:51] first brother said I didn't feel any of
[48:53] those feelings hugging all those because
[48:55] all those uh hormones were gone all
[48:56] those feelings were
[48:59] gone brother gets back from that he says
[49:02] oh I don't want to leave this place but
[49:03] the voice said you've got to go back you
[49:04] got to finish you got to preach the
[49:05] Seven Seals got to preach marriage and
[49:08] divorce Hallelujah got to preach all
[49:10] these
[49:11] Revelations and he he says he says thus
[49:15] sayith the Lord it'll take perfect love
[49:16] to put you in that place for that's all
[49:18] there that's all that was
[49:22] there it'll take perfect love so
[49:24] whatever you do
[49:27] right of Christ Fellowship whatever you
[49:28] do after this revival you lay aside
[49:31] everything else until you're just so
[49:33] filled with the love of God till you can
[49:35] love those who hate you and the church
[49:38] said Hallelujah that's what Jesus was
[49:40] talking about bless those who curse you
[49:44] love those who hate you do good to those
[49:47] who despitefully use you brother Ram
[49:49] said it lay everything aside remember
[49:51] just a couple weeks ago I preached on
[49:53] lay aside the sin that does so easily
[49:55] the
[49:57] sin lay aside anything that's making us
[50:00] not grow closer to Christ lay it aside
[50:03] and get that mature
[50:06] love that doesn't that help even with
[50:08] that quote doesn't that help it doesn't
[50:09] mean I never uh I I never sin today it
[50:12] just means I've got mature
[50:15] love right I'm just mature now and now I
[50:19] can be good to those who are evil to
[50:23] me Hallelujah
[50:26] lay aside everything brother Bram says
[50:29] so you can have perfect love and church
[50:31] perfect love isn't always smileing like
[50:34] I love you I love you even though you
[50:37] cursed me I love you Jesus got the ropes
[50:41] out right whipped him out then other
[50:43] times Jesus looked at the Pharisees in
[50:45] Anger sometimes perfect love looks a
[50:47] little
[50:49] angry right it just depends on the
[50:52] situation so let's not get this you know
[50:55] this this false picture in our mind it's
[50:56] always smiling it's always easy oh I'll
[50:59] have perfect love when everything's
[51:00] going good for me that's not Jesus
[51:02] rarely had everything going good for him
[51:04] constantly accused constantly uh
[51:07] badgered brother used the word badgered
[51:09] he was always badgered by the Pharisees
[51:10] and religious
[51:11] people especially at the end of his
[51:14] ministry but yet he had perfect love why
[51:17] because he had mature love he was able
[51:19] to overcome all the all the haters
[51:21] against
[51:22] him he was able to say father forgive
[51:25] them they don't know what they're
[51:28] doing how many would say they'd like
[51:30] perfect love here tonight by God's
[51:33] grace I would say that and church let me
[51:36] tell you in one way you are perfect by
[51:38] the blood of Jesus Christ all your sins
[51:40] are paid for I think I'm going to preach
[51:42] out on Sunday I'm going to show them
[51:43] those scriptures you are unblamable the
[51:46] Bible says Satan cannot blame you you
[51:49] are unreprovable Satan can't rebuke
[51:53] you all your sins all your trespasses
[51:56] you are forgiven I think I'm going to
[51:58] bring this in
[52:00] there you're already perfect in the mind
[52:02] of God in heaven you're perfect sinless
[52:05] but here on Earth we are maturing and
[52:09] we're confessing our sin and brother man
[52:11] says as long as we're walking in the
[52:13] spirit he says then we're we're doing
[52:15] what we must do to become
[52:18] mature we're walking in the spirit not
[52:21] walking in the
[52:22] flesh let's bow our heads here for a
[52:24] word of Prayer
[52:30] before I pray brother Ram said how can
[52:32] you be perfect not in yourself but in
[52:35] him Hallelujah in Christ I'm Perfect
[52:39] Sisters there in Christ I am not me
[52:43] though not the sin I hate the sin sister
[52:45] who I hate the sin that's within me but
[52:47] in Christ I'm perfect it's so are you
[52:51] now you're perfect in Christ not of
[52:54] yourself
[52:57] I can't be perfect in myself but I'm
[52:59] perfect in the perfect one because I'm
[53:02] part of Christ I'm an attribute I'm a
[53:05] thought of God I was chosen in the mind
[53:07] of Christ before the foundation how do I
[53:09] know because I've accepted his word
[53:10] today that's how I know brother Bram
[53:13] said that's how you know that's brother
[53:14] Braham in the in the Seven Seals how do
[53:16] you know your Lamb's on your names on
[53:18] the Lamb's Book of Life he said because
[53:19] as soon as you hear that word you want
[53:20] to obey it that's how I know my name's
[53:23] over there as soon as brother Jim
[53:25] preaches that as soon as cam preaches
[53:27] that I want
[53:29] that I want to recognize God in the
[53:31] present I Want To Praise His Name with
[53:33] dancing amen hallelujah oh sorry
[53:36] Hallelujah I want the law of restoration
[53:38] I want God to restore anything I've lost
[53:40] I want God to restore back praise God
[53:46] sorry he up my
[53:48] wisdom let's pray father God we thank
[53:50] you for today Lord
[53:52] God Lord God thank you for these great
[53:55] thoughts from the scripture and from
[53:56] your quotes from your Prophet Lord God
[53:59] he said oh let's get it Hebrews
[54:02] 10:14 by one sacrifice he hath forever
[54:06] perfected them that are Sanctified we're
[54:08] so grateful Lord each one of us can lift
[54:10] our hands and or bow our heads and say
[54:12] thank you Jesus we're perfect in heaven
[54:14] we're without sin and here on Earth we
[54:16] are being matured or perfected through
[54:19] the growing process of feeding on your
[54:22] word confessing our sins daily and Lord
[54:26] being good to those who are not good to
[54:28] us blessing those who curse us I think
[54:32] of that song I follow Jesus
[54:36] hallelujah thank you Jesus
[54:41] Hallelujah Lord the next time someone
[54:43] tries to cuss me out Lord God the next
