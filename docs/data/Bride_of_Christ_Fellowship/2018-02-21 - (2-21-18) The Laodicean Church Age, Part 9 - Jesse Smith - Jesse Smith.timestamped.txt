[40:41] to Revelation chapter 3 verse 19 and we
[40:52] might get to verse 20 tonight by God's
[40:53] grace
[41:04] in revelation 3:19 this is part nine of
[41:08] the latest in church age I just want to
[41:10] make sure I cover everything in the
[41:12] church age book that really sticks out
[41:14] plus the sermon series from the prophets
[41:17] so we're just going to be real diligent
[41:19] about that so it's three revelation 3:19
[41:24] let's read verse 19 and I'll read verse
[41:25] 20 so let's begin with verse 19 on three
[41:28] one two three as many as I love I rebuke
[41:31] and chasten be zealous therefore and
[41:34] repent now read verse 20 behold I stand
[41:37] at the door and knock If any man so now
[41:40] he's calling to the individual If any
[41:42] man hear my voice and open the door I
[41:44] will come into him and sup with him and
[41:47] he with me may God add the blessings the
[41:50] reading of his word may be seated by
[41:51] God's grace god bless you
[41:53] animalic I can switch over I do have
[41:55] some slides here elected share here so
[42:05] this is part nine like I said part 56 of
[42:07] this series we're familiar with a lot of
[42:09] these things here now just so you know
[42:12] I've been praying about and studying on
[42:14] these future series I'm building up some
[42:16] thoughts on these the one I just was
[42:19] four new to me this week I spent about
[42:20] four or five hours on Monday morning
[42:22] studying on that one here at the church
[42:24] because I had Monday off for President's
[42:26] Day so I want to look at a series on
[42:27] wisdom with proverbs and Ecclesiastes I
[42:30] like to look at the life of Christ
[42:31] because brother Graham said the bride's
[42:33] ministry must match Jesus's earthly
[42:35] ministry perfectly before the coming of
[42:38] the Lord before the rapture we look at a
[42:41] series on prayer I've talked about that
[42:43] leadership I've been looking at that
[42:44] some thoughts on that and then the
[42:46] believe the sign rebuttals I'd like to
[42:48] go over that too I also want to finish
[42:50] this series we've been working on church
[42:52] ages I'm trying to finish that one and
[42:54] I've had a leading to go back and finish
[42:55] the David series I left off after part
[42:59] 21 after Bathsheba I'd like to pick up
[43:02] there and kind of show kind of like the
[43:04] effects of the whirlwind like we looked
[43:06] at a few weeks ago and then I want to
[43:08] finish the book of Revelation I'm not
[43:09] sure where I left off on that and
[43:12] the Paul's Gospels I'm still in
[43:14] Ephesians and I'm waiting for a Sunday
[43:16] when I know everybody's going to be here
[43:17] except that the portion whereas in
[43:19] Ephesians 4 right at the fivefold
[43:21] ministry and I want to bring that
[43:22] message again except update it that
[43:25] message about should pastors preach or
[43:27] play tapes I want to bring that message
[43:29] again except I want to update it I want
[43:31] to show you exactly the things that
[43:33] people have said around this camp that
[43:35] you know they they say they believe
[43:36] every word brother Branham says but yet
[43:38] they want to cut off pastor so I want to
[43:40] show you some of the updaters I found
[43:42] five or six quotes maybe seven and it's
[43:45] just shocking to hear some of the things
[43:46] they say but anyways I want to bring
[43:48] that as well but I'm waiting on that
[43:50] waiting till you know everybody will be
[43:52] back from maybe winter and different you
[43:54] know all the weather problems you know
[43:56] I'm kind of waiting on that to preach
[43:58] that so just giving you a little insight
[44:01] where I've been studying lately I'm
[44:02] really excited about the wisdom series
[44:04] that I do want to get their prayers well
[44:05] some series on that but just want to
[44:09] update you on that now I want to
[44:10] continue from last Wednesday on this
[44:12] zeal and fervent look looking at these
[44:14] scriptures here and remember they're
[44:17] almost synonymous these two words are
[44:19] very similar they both deal with boiling
[44:22] up okay so we get this thought from be
[44:25] zealous therefore and repent so this
[44:29] will help us understand what does it
[44:30] mean to repent with zeal what does it
[44:32] mean and it means zeal means to desire
[44:37] earnestly to strive after to be heated
[44:39] to boil with Envy hatred of course we're
[44:42] not done evil that we're not doing the
[44:44] evil side of jealous we're doing the
[44:47] good side to pursue good so when you're
[44:51] really zealous for God you want to
[44:52] pursue doing the right thing with a lot
[44:54] of emotion with a lot of faithfulness
[44:58] you're boiling with I'm gonna do this
[45:00] and nothing is going to stop me that's
[45:03] real zeal for God so when you're zealous
[45:05] to repent you are going to show
[45:07] everybody you're gonna prove to the
[45:08] devil especially that you're not going
[45:10] to follow that sin next time you're free
[45:13] from that sin amen that's real zeal to
[45:16] repent that's what we need in our church
[45:17] that's what all of us need everybody the
[45:19] message everybody that's a Christian
[45:20] needs that because that's the that's the
[45:23] burden of our age now fervent of
[45:26] is very similar to boil with heat
[45:29] boiling anger so for us it's boiling
[45:31] love our love is boiling over hopefully
[45:34] you feel that tonight zeal for what is
[45:36] good you're just bubbling over with
[45:38] wanting to do good tonight hopefully
[45:41] that's how you feel because that's real
[45:43] fervency by the grace of the Lord you
[45:46] just you're but I just can't wait to do
[45:47] something well the RAM said that's one
[45:49] way you know you're laying your names on
[45:51] the Lamb's Book of Life when you see
[45:52] what's in the word you can't wait to do
[45:54] it he said I said that in the first seal
[45:58] he said that's one good sign that your
[45:59] name is on the Lamb's Book of Life you
[46:01] can't wait to do something for the Lord
[46:03] amen now we looked at some scriptures
[46:05] last Wednesday we looked at Phineas how
[46:08] he was zealous for God and God rewarded
[46:11] his family with the priesthood because
[46:14] he stopped the plague by throwing the
[46:18] spear through the belly of the the
[46:20] Israelite leader who was who was leading
[46:22] the charge with his immorality he was
[46:24] like the leader causing others to
[46:26] stumble we looked at G who last week he
[46:30] said watch my zeal remember and what he
[46:32] did is he killed all the Bayla mite
[46:34] worshippers he killed all a hab sons and
[46:37] all all their offspring he said watch my
[46:41] zeal and he had zeal for a while but
[46:43] then of his life he lost the zeal so
[46:45] that anointing left him now our zeal
[46:47] shouldn't be like that our zeal should
[46:49] be continual anointing because his life
[46:53] wasn't much better than he said the
[46:54] previous king the Bible said he was just
[46:56] he had a zeal for a little while but he
[46:59] let that anointing leave him instead of
[47:00] staying faithful to the Word of God
[47:03] sorry we looked at Jesus's zeal briefly
[47:11] for the house of God to clean out the
[47:13] house of God we should always have that
[47:15] zeal when we see anybody walking here
[47:17] instead of going up and telling them oh
[47:19] you shouldn't done that you should get
[47:21] on your knees and pray for them you
[47:23] should bow your head in your heart and
[47:24] say Lord this is a visitor minister to
[47:27] them by your Holy Spirit bring them to
[47:29] repentance you should pray this discern
[47:31] their hearts that they'll know God is
[47:33] amongst us amen
[47:36] if we know
[47:37] sit in somebody's life we ought to go to
[47:39] them individually right we know
[47:41] something's wrong with the pastor you
[47:43] need to talk to the pastor individually
[47:44] you know something's wrong with a deacon
[47:46] got talk to the Deacon individually
[47:47] right you know something's wrong with
[47:49] the sister of the piano player you need
[47:51] to go talk to them individually it's
[47:53] just as you're just as responsible as me
[47:55] or anyone else we're all responsible to
[47:57] keep the house of God clean and then we
[48:00] saw God zeal in Isaiah 6 that God was
[48:03] going to bring the Millennium to pass
[48:05] guardzilla do this if the government of
[48:08] the Messiah would be brought to the
[48:10] earth it's God's seal it's God's boiling
[48:13] love that's gonna bring the rapture the
[48:16] tribulation and then the Millennium God
[48:18] zeal is going to do that his love for
[48:20] his word and his promises and then I
[48:22] think we know we we looked at how Paul
[48:26] said be zealous but be zealous for the
[48:28] gifts that benefit the most people so
[48:31] our our biggest prayers are the the most
[48:34] boiling prayers we have is say God send
[48:37] a prophecy to the church send a prophecy
[48:40] so the church knows the future and so
[48:43] not just sister Connie knows her brother
[48:45] Jose knows but everybody in the church
[48:47] knows that's what we should be zealous
[48:49] for we should pray for those type of
[48:51] things it doesn't happen very much like
[48:54] we said we know it doesn't happen a
[48:55] whole lot I've only had a few in the
[48:58] whole years I've served the Lord of
[48:59] prophecies of different things that
[49:01] would happen just a few but we should
[49:04] pray for that our zeal should be
[49:06] invested in Lord bless all your people
[49:08] with the gifts of the Holy Spirit
[49:10] benefit everybody don't let just be the
[49:12] pastor the song leader or the sister who
[49:15] gets in the spirit of the brother gets
[49:16] in the spirit dance of the Spirit let it
[49:18] touch everybody praise God and then we
[49:22] saw this this is a zeal all of us can
[49:24] have Epirus had a zeal for the Church of
[49:28] the Colossians he constantly pray for
[49:30] them Paul said Paul said I've heard his
[49:32] prayers this man had a zeal he kept
[49:35] lifting up the church in prayer and I
[49:38] hope you have a zeal to pray for our
[49:40] church amen that's what we should have I
[49:42] have that I know I have of that I have
[49:44] that in fact you know when I was here
[49:46] Monday I was fasting and I was praying I
[49:48] was seeking God about that dream I had
[49:49] about brother
[49:50] remember that I finally had time to fast
[49:52] and pray about that on Monday I was
[49:54] seeking the Lord Lord show me the dream
[49:56] said I haven't sought you I feel like I
[49:58] have but if I haven't I'm and I laid
[50:00] here on my face and cried and prayed
[50:02] that God would show me so I'm still
[50:04] waiting on the Lord but I'm gonna take
[50:06] that dream and I'm gonna I'm gonna act
[50:08] on that dream
[50:09] my faith is gonna act upon the word
[50:11] that's been revealed to me so see we got
[50:14] to have a zeal we got to have if to show
[50:15] God that you mean business and then we
[50:19] ended last week by showing how our zeal
[50:22] has stirred up when we see disobedience
[50:24] and others when you see somebody smoking
[50:26] or here's somebody cussing or you see
[50:29] somebody you know doing something evil
[50:32] it should give you a zeal it should make
[50:33] you boil up in your love to do what's
[50:36] right for God amen that's why that's
[50:39] what Dave that's what David said David
[50:41] said seeing my enemies discount your
[50:43] word made me zealous for the Lord amen
[50:47] so see instead of you know if you see
[50:49] churches that don't honor the word
[50:50] anymore instead of self get upset with
[50:53] them let it be a motivation for you to
[50:56] do what's right for the Lord don't just
[50:58] stand there and criticize and say oh
[51:00] brother did you hear what this church
[51:01] did don't talk like that
[51:02] just give it more get let it give you
[51:04] more zeal so that you serve God better
[51:07] and maybe pray for them
[51:09] definitely definitely pray for them now
[51:13] let's continue this is all new I haven't
[51:15] gone over these now let's go to second
[51:16] with Ian 7-eleven let's go this this is
[51:18] familiar but let's read it again because
[51:20] we're on this topic of zeal if we need
[51:22] zeal to repent in this hour we better
[51:24] know what zeal looks like and that's how
[51:26] you get to know it by looking at the
[51:28] scripture st. Corinthians 7-eleven now
[51:38] if preach
[51:39] over and over again not a whole sermon
[51:42] on it but verse 10 it talks about godly
[51:44] sorrow worketh repentance to salvation
[51:45] not to be repented of so see you won't
[51:50] repent of that salvation once you're
[51:51] really saved you won't repent of that
[51:53] you'll keep that you don't you don't
[51:56] leave that you keep that salvation but
[51:58] the sorrow of the world works death
[52:00] separation death is separation it works
[52:03] separation from God for behold the self
[52:06] same thing that you sorrowed after a
[52:09] godly sort what carefulness it wrought
[52:11] in you yeh what clearing of yourselves
[52:13] yeh what Anglin yeh what fear yeh what
[52:17] the Hemet desire yeh what zeal yeh what
[52:22] revenge in all things you have approved
[52:24] yourselves to be clear in this matter
[52:27] now I preach this a few times over the
[52:30] last few months but just a reminder this
[52:31] shows what you must have if you really
[52:34] repented you must have a zeal and a
[52:36] revenge that you're going to get revenge
[52:38] on the devil the devil has tricked you
[52:41] you've fallen off the path but you've
[52:43] got spiritual revenge in your heart that
[52:46] you're gonna show him that's the last
[52:47] time he's gonna tempt you with that it
[52:49] actually cause you to fall the next time
[52:52] you're gonna cast it down in the name of
[52:53] Jesus amen
[52:55] that's real zeal but if somebody keeps
[52:58] compromising on this over and they keep
[53:00] falling they haven't got real repentance
[53:03] they haven't got really godly sorrow
[53:05] they haven't got real zeal for God yet
[53:09] and I had a brother called me up he left
[53:11] a voicemail he said brother Jesse's and
[53:12] I said you're one person I know and this
[53:15] is so strange he left me a message last
[53:16] night and he didn't even know I was
[53:18] preaching on zeal you don't even listen
[53:19] to my sermons he said if there's one
[53:21] person that got zeal brother Jesse he
[53:22] said it's you I know that's that's
[53:25] encouraging I'll go and preach on zeal
[53:27] that's a that's a good confirmation so
[53:31] see if we've done something wrong we
[53:33] have to make sure next time I'll be so
[53:35] strong spiritually Satan will be so far
[53:38] under my feet that I won't even turn to
[53:40] look twice at the temptation I won't
[53:42] even think twice about it because I'm
[53:44] walking in victory amen
[53:47] hallelujah now here this is a good
[53:50] thought for all of us zeal is good
[53:53] as long as it's channeled or invest in
[53:56] the good thing that's Galatians 4:18
[53:59] let's go there Galatians 4:18 because we
[54:04] look at misguided zeal here at the end
[54:06] of this page
[54:07] but just remember Galatians 4:18 because
[54:12] I've said the quote hundreds of times
[54:14] here brother Branham said we can't let
[54:16] our zeal eat up our wisdom so we must
[54:19] have zeal in the right channel it must
[54:22] be at the right time the right season
[54:24] and Galatians 4 just literally states
[54:26] this which is really nice to read here
[54:30] now he's talking about how the Jews are
[54:34] having zeal for circumcision but Paul
[54:38] says it's good to have zeal for
[54:40] something that's good and not for
[54:42] legalism look at verse 17
[54:45] they sell ously affect you but not well
[54:47] to see there there's some people that
[54:49] will be really zealous for something but
[54:51] they're off the word yeah they would
[54:54] exclude you that you might affect them
[54:57] so they're so zealous they'll kick you
[54:59] out of their fellowship if you don't do
[55:01] what they do right or follow their
[55:02] doctrines but it is good to be zealously
[55:06] affected always in a good thing and not
[55:11] only when I am present with you what we
[55:14] could we could all use a lesson from
[55:15] that couldn't we we shouldn't just be
[55:17] zealous for God when we have a guest
[55:19] preacher here right that's what Paul say
[55:23] he said you just don't want to be
[55:24] zealous when I'm around you want to be
[55:27] zealous for Christ all the time you
[55:29] shouldn't be zealous just a church you
[55:31] should be zealous for God at home to
[55:33] your love of God should boil up all the
[55:36] time praise the Lord that's what he's
[55:37] saying here now just when the preachers
[55:39] around the prophets around or a deacon
[55:41] or whoever's around you at we should be
[55:43] zealous all the time for Christ amen I
[55:46] don't know I don't know how to but I
[55:48] can't get enough of it I stick my
[55:49] earbuds in on the drive and I listen all
[55:51] the time something about God some about
[55:53] Jesus if I can't I'm really tired
[55:55] I put this morning I put our music to
[55:57] lift me up so I'm really tired I know if
[55:59] I'm gonna get lifted up it's usually
[56:00] gonna be through song that's why God
[56:02] gave us songs to lift up our spirits is
[56:05] that right
[56:06] but if I'm rested
[56:07] rested put me on a good sermon there let
[56:10] me hear the preacher
[56:11] let me hear a mystery and the Word of
[56:12] God but if I'm tired like this morning
[56:14] put on that snappy gospel music amen all
[56:18] the time see in a good thing we must be
[56:20] zealous for good things not for wrong
[56:24] things now I'm going to skip that skip
[56:29] down and hit this since we're talking
[56:30] about a good thing I think it'd be
[56:31] better order if we go down here since
[56:34] we're closed the Galatians let's just go
[56:36] to Philippians turn a few pages to
[56:38] Philippians three six there now this is
[56:46] Paul's testimony you know he's talking
[56:47] about he was circumcised the eighth day
[56:49] he's going through all his fleshly
[56:52] requirements or I guess fleshly resume
[56:55] of what kind of a Pharisee he was and he
[56:59] said in verse six concerning zeal I
[57:00] persecuted the church touching the
[57:04] righteousness law blameless so no one
[57:07] kept legally the legalistic part law
[57:09] more than Paul no one was more zealous
[57:12] for the Word of God the Old Testament
[57:14] than Paul right and no one was more
[57:17] zealous than him because he persecuted
[57:19] the church he would drag people to jail
[57:24] that's how zealous he was now should we
[57:28] drag people to church physically no
[57:30] we'll get the cops caught on us but he
[57:33] had the government behind him he had
[57:35] Rome behind him he had letters to take
[57:39] Christians capture them take him to jail
[57:42] that's how zealous he was but this is
[57:45] what I'm pregnant for in my life because
[57:47] my grandfather at his funeral a couple
[57:49] years ago a preacher came up a Spanish
[57:53] preacher because my grandpa spoke
[57:54] Spanish he was Spanish least
[57:56] spanish-speaking I don't know we don't
[57:57] even know what our actual lineage is
[57:59] whether it's Mexican Spanish a Portugal
[58:01] we don't even know Native American it's
[58:03] hard to know anyways this preacher comes
[58:06] up he's an old man he's got gray hair
[58:07] and he said I want to tell you about
[58:09] Romero that's my grandpa's name Romero
[58:12] Garza he said when he said when I was a
[58:16] sinner I worked at the same factory as
[58:19] Romero my grandfather
[58:21] and he said Romero would come and chase
[58:25] me down every day at work and say aren't
[58:28] you gonna serve Jesus he said I got so
[58:30] tired of it that when I saw him coming
[58:32] he said he would jump in a trashcan like
[58:34] those big trash dump dumpsters and he
[58:37] would hide in there and sometimes my
[58:39] grandpa wouldn't see him he said but one
[58:40] time my grandpa did see him jump in the
[58:43] trash can so he peeked in the trash can
[58:45] those big dumps like we have out there
[58:46] those big dumpsters he said what are you
[58:49] gonna serve Jesus and that's zeal Church
[58:52] that that's the kind of zeal I want
[58:55] let's pray for that at the end of
[58:57] service how many would pray for me would
[58:59] pray for yourself that's what honestly
[59:00] that's what I want now I want to go to
[59:02] jail I don't like I don't get that I
[59:04] don't want the cops called on me but I
[59:06] do want to pursue people more with the
[59:08] Word of God and he stood there crying
[59:11] and he's thanking God I'm so glad Romero
[59:13] came after in other words chased me like
[59:15] a shepherd would as a sheep and now that
[59:19] man's been a pastor 40 years I don't
[59:20] know if he's still alive he's been a
[59:22] pastor 40 years there I think it was in
[59:24] Delta or Wauseon and all and look so see
[59:28] it wasn't my grandfather that was trying
[59:31] to do it it was Christ in my grandfather
[59:35] you see that it was the bird in other
[59:37] words my grandfather caught the heart of
[59:39] God and then he pursued after somebody
[59:43] else with the heart of God Simon said
[59:47] when he first heard the message he said
[59:48] the heart of God placed him after two
[59:50] people he said his my dad and me he said
[59:54] I knew Jesse would receive it and I
[59:57] never heard the message he said but God
[59:58] put the heart God put his heart on
[1:00:02] Simon's heart too bad for those two
[1:00:03] people first and what if I was me my dad
[1:00:08] recognized it but he you know he turned
[1:00:09] it out he's not living it yet but see
[1:00:12] that was God's heart right on my dad's
[1:00:15] heart now who wants somebody on their
[1:00:19] heart from God's heart that see that's
[1:00:22] what we need zeal we need to pray for
[1:00:23] that because this is Paul Paul said I
[1:00:26] would I would persecute him I would drag
[1:00:28] into jail well see we can't drag people
[1:00:30] to church but we should surely try to
[1:00:31] encourage people to come to church we
[1:00:34] should try to do so ours eel
[1:00:36] should move us to do something to invite
[1:00:38] the neighbor right invite somebody might
[1:00:41] your co-worker invite somebody we should
[1:00:43] have some zeal to try to win somebody to
[1:00:46] Christ program said if you don't have a
[1:00:48] zeal to win a soul to the Lord he said
[1:00:50] you're not right with God he said that's
[1:00:54] the main thing try to win souls and I
[1:00:56] don't care if they go denomination or
[1:00:58] not they can still be saved in
[1:01:00] nomination until that marks laid down
[1:01:02] right the official mark before the
[1:01:04] rapture they can still be saved that's
[1:01:06] right that's exactly right we'd have to
[1:01:08] pray they don't take them the spiritual
[1:01:10] mark right that they would be a foolish
[1:01:12] virgins so the misguided his zeal paused
[1:01:17] zeal but it was misguided but he was
[1:01:20] living everything that he knew and so we
[1:01:23] should have a seal to live everything
[1:01:24] that we know like I was talking about
[1:01:27] that janitor at our school he don't work
[1:01:29] there anymore I begged him I the last
[1:01:32] time was a couple of weeks ago I was
[1:01:33] begging him in the hallway come on you
[1:01:34] told me we've we got to sit down and
[1:01:37] talk about your soul he's like no I
[1:01:39] can't do that I'm like you told me you I
[1:01:41] said we prayed for you in this room that
[1:01:43] you would come out of a coma and come
[1:01:45] back to work and you did and you told me
[1:01:47] we could pray for your soul he and he
[1:01:48] just walks away
[1:01:49] you know but see I'm just there beg in
[1:01:51] there trying to win us try to have zeal
[1:01:54] to win a soul we must do whatever we can
[1:01:57] to win a soul for God now I go to Romans
[1:02:00] tend to again hear the juice we'll see
[1:02:02] again Jews had zeal but brother man said
[1:02:07] it was the wrong zeal of course the
[1:02:09] Bible says that to Romans 10 - lets go
[1:02:16] to verse 1 I love this brethren my
[1:02:17] heart's desire what's your heart's
[1:02:19] desire tonight church is it to see
[1:02:21] people saved I hope it is I know Amen so
[1:02:24] with that my desires just go to see the
[1:02:25] Hmong people saved I know he's told me
[1:02:26] that before I know Jose he told me that
[1:02:29] about his and I know Adams told me how
[1:02:30] many people he wants to see saved his
[1:02:32] family our heart's desire is to see
[1:02:34] somebody saved and prayer to God for
[1:02:38] Israel is that they might be
[1:02:41] millionaires that they might be famous
[1:02:46] but they might
[1:02:48] all the natural blessings know that they
[1:02:50] might have a spiritual blessing of
[1:02:52] salvation this is a prophet who's filled
[1:02:55] with the Holy Ghost his heart's desire
[1:02:57] is to see people saved for I bear them
[1:03:02] record that they have a zeal of God but
[1:03:04] not according to the knowledge other
[1:03:06] words the revelation of Christ as
[1:03:07] Messiah knowledge is understanding they
[1:03:10] don't have the understanding that Jesus
[1:03:12] is the Christ amen all right so that's
[1:03:17] misguided zeal we have to watch out for
[1:03:19] that in our lives that we don't get
[1:03:21] misguided zeal we've got a channel the
[1:03:24] zeal of God the right way now let's go
[1:03:29] to Ezekiel file I just I think some of
[1:03:31] these were just really good I couldn't
[1:03:32] pass them up and I think they're just a
[1:03:34] blessing to see what zeal really looks
[1:03:37] like and church every single person in
[1:03:40] here should leave here tonight saying
[1:03:42] god I need more zeal if we can't apply
[1:03:45] this to our lives we're not honest with
[1:03:47] ourselves we need more zeal to serve the
[1:03:49] Lord brother Branham prayed for I'll
[1:03:52] show you the quotes he prayed for we
[1:03:53] should pray for that stir up my zeal
[1:03:55] like that you've said give us more
[1:03:57] boldness we all need that ezekiel 5:13
[1:04:01] thus shall mine anger be accomplished my
[1:04:05] fury to rest upon them and i will be
[1:04:08] comforted and they shall know that I the
[1:04:10] LORD have spoken it in my zeal when I
[1:04:13] have accomplished my fury in them so
[1:04:16] this is people that are being judged God
[1:04:19] no no God zeal when everything falls
[1:04:22] apart
[1:04:23] when they see their lives falling apart
[1:04:25] and the destructions of God all around
[1:04:28] them then they'll see God zeal I'd
[1:04:31] rather see God zeal in my life right now
[1:04:32] in grace right I don't want to see God
[1:04:36] zeal and judgment I want to see God zeal
[1:04:38] and grace like Jesus like clean out our
[1:04:41] church Lord amen if we our church needs
[1:04:43] cleaned up get the whip out we want to
[1:04:46] see God zeal and mercy and grace amen
[1:04:48] not in judge we're not in fury or wrath
[1:04:51] but we want to see you in mercy so I
[1:04:55] just want you to
[1:04:56] what does this what like with Phineas
[1:04:59] what causes God to slay people it's his
[1:05:02] zeal that does that remember the man in
[1:05:05] the book of Acts he was glorifying
[1:05:07] himself well I forget was named King he
[1:05:09] was a king I don't matter what his name
[1:05:10] was but the Bible said he called himself
[1:05:12] God and the Bible said God smote him
[1:05:15] right there remember that and the Bible
[1:05:17] said worms ate him up
[1:05:19] I think it's acts 18 let's go there I
[1:05:21] can look real quick
[1:05:22] I think it's go to acts 18 there's times
[1:05:28] God just pours out his zeal
[1:05:29] I think it's 18 X I'm sorry it's acts 12
[1:05:34] 23 xjassx 12 23 there you go so see god
[1:05:44] of the old testament is still the same
[1:05:47] God in the New Testament now we know
[1:05:49] God's long-suffering in the New
[1:05:50] Testament but God still slays people
[1:05:53] trying to think of any recent examples
[1:05:55] I'm not sure if I can think of any where
[1:05:58] people recognize it to be I'm thinking
[1:06:00] about in the news where people recognize
[1:06:01] it be the hand of God I can't think of
[1:06:06] any right now acts 12 23 this is the
[1:06:11] death of Herod okay yeah Herod that's
[1:06:12] right yeah the people gave a shout verse
[1:06:17] 22 and the people gave a shout saying is
[1:06:18] the voice of a god and not a man and
[1:06:21] immediately the angel Lord smote him
[1:06:24] because he gave not God the glory and he
[1:06:27] was eaten of worms and gave up the ghost
[1:06:29] that's a New Testament God amen
[1:06:33] that's our God who killed Ananias and
[1:06:36] Sapphira God did not Peter Peter didn't
[1:06:40] murder anybody
[1:06:41] God did that what did that God zeal
[1:06:45] praise God in that in this case his
[1:06:48] boiling anger if they lied to God's face
[1:06:53] right and if here if they if they
[1:06:56] glorify themselves rather than giving
[1:06:59] God glory there's times God will smite
[1:07:01] them dead that's exactly right
[1:07:05] so that makes
[1:07:06] just want to fear the Lord for the fear
[1:07:09] of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom
[1:07:10] amen now let's look at God's zeal to
[1:07:14] defend Hezekiah this is a beautiful
[1:07:17] story I'm just gonna read because it's a
[1:07:19] long chapter let's just read second
[1:07:21] Kings 1931 and then I'll read matthew
[1:07:24] henry's summary of the chapter
[1:07:26] second Kings 1931 and Malachi can you
[1:07:29] read that buddy when you get that second
[1:07:31] Kings 1931
[1:07:33] I got a remember so zealous tonight I'm
[1:07:35] forgetting to let other people use their
[1:07:37] voice I'm gonna wear myself out brother
[1:07:39] Branham said it's not wise he said it's
[1:07:41] no way it's not a lot of wisdom if I
[1:07:44] ever asked me voice after service so I'm
[1:07:46] the same way so forgive me Lord second
[1:07:49] Kings 1931 all right so who's gonna
[1:07:59] protect the remnant the zeal of God
[1:08:02] God's boiling love in this case God's
[1:08:05] boiling judgement is gonna drive out I'm
[1:08:08] not sure how to say this guy's name it's
[1:08:10] a Senate cherub but then his love for
[1:08:15] God's people is gonna protect a remnant
[1:08:17] of believers a small group of believers
[1:08:19] amen so here's the here's the summary
[1:08:22] Jerusalem's great distress we read up in
[1:08:24] the foregoing tractor and left it
[1:08:27] besieged and salted threatened terrified
[1:08:29] and just ready to be swallowed up by the
[1:08:30] Syrian army so in other words Israel's
[1:08:32] battling the Assyrians but in this
[1:08:35] chapter we have an account of its
[1:08:37] glorious deliverance not by sword or bow
[1:08:39] but by prayer and prophecy and by the
[1:08:45] hand of an angel Hezekiah and great
[1:08:47] concern sent to the prophet Isaiah to
[1:08:49] desire his prayers and receive from him
[1:08:51] and answer a peace see God loves that
[1:08:54] God loves when someone's in distress and
[1:08:57] they reach out to the man of God of the
[1:08:59] hour
[1:09:00] prays to the heart which was in that
[1:09:02] case the prophet Isaiah amen they reach
[1:09:06] out God loves that humility pray for me
[1:09:08] brother so-and-so pray for me sister
[1:09:10] so-and-so Simon Reese
[1:09:16] I don't know if it probably okay if I
[1:09:18] share this with you because he told me
[1:09:20] numerous times he said he was really
[1:09:22] worn out he was doing a lot of side jobs
[1:09:24] helping out people there plumbing and he
[1:09:25] said he called up sister Karen you know
[1:09:27] sanders from lima he said sister Karen
[1:09:29] can you seek God and see you know she's
[1:09:31] given words of the Lord before to Lisa
[1:09:33] Graham and also to brother Brooks I've
[1:09:36] seen it come to pass it works it worked
[1:09:38] every time and he said can you give me a
[1:09:44] word for my life and he said she called
[1:09:46] him back I think the next day or
[1:09:47] something and said thus saith the Lord
[1:09:49] if you don't take a rest and rush your
[1:09:51] body you're gonna pay for it you're
[1:09:53] gonna be punished so Simon has taken
[1:09:56] that as a thus saith the Lord he's
[1:09:57] turning down jobs just to get his
[1:09:59] physical strength back I like that I
[1:10:02] like when you have confidence in
[1:10:04] somebody's prayers if you ask them to
[1:10:06] pray you know God's gonna answer their
[1:10:08] prayer that's that's wonderful that's
[1:10:11] beautiful and so God love this about
[1:10:13] Hezekiah Hezekiah says well I know
[1:10:16] there's one man that can talk to God
[1:10:18] it's Isaiah Isaiah what's God's word for
[1:10:20] our lives we're surrounded by the
[1:10:23] Syrians what's your will Lord and he
[1:10:27] said peace God's gonna give them peace
[1:10:28] so Sennacherib's sent a letter to
[1:10:31] Hezekiah to fright him into surrender
[1:10:33] some of you probably member that
[1:10:34] Hezekiah thereupon by a very solemn
[1:10:37] prayer recommended his case to God the
[1:10:39] righteous judge and begged help from him
[1:10:43] so God by Isaiah sent him a very
[1:10:46] comfortable message assuring him of
[1:10:48] deliverance the army of the Syrians it
[1:10:50] was all cut off by an angel and sent a
[1:10:53] cherub himself was slain by his own sons
[1:10:55] and so God glorified himself and saved
[1:10:58] his people amen
[1:11:00] why did God have zeal to save the small
[1:11:03] remnant because they humble themselves
[1:11:05] and they prayed and they asked God for a
[1:11:08] word instead of trying to him no let's
[1:11:11] get our let's get our military forces
[1:11:13] let's flex our muscles and show him what
[1:11:14] we got boys instead of that he got
[1:11:17] humble and he prayed and he said man of
[1:11:20] God pray and we need the word of the
[1:11:22] Lord we know the word is more powerful
[1:11:25] than our own weapons amen we need a
[1:11:28] prophecy
[1:11:29] we need the voice of the Holy Spirit we
[1:11:32] need to hear from God and because he
[1:11:34] humbled himself like that the zeal of
[1:11:36] God drove out his enemies amen
[1:11:39] how many want God zeal to drive out your
[1:11:41] enemies this is what happened here I'm
[1:11:43] surrounded by enemies I have no other
[1:11:45] options I'm looking to you God and God
[1:11:48] zeal save his people amen
[1:11:53] here's just a few quotes on zeal Graham
[1:11:56] said what we need today is a missionary
[1:11:58] minded God sent Holy Ghost born revival
[1:12:02] that'll have the zeal of God to push out
[1:12:05] into the jungles yonder and do something
[1:12:07] for God instead of build big fine
[1:12:10] churches and try to outshine the
[1:12:12] neighbor what do we have more zeal for
[1:12:15] to send brother Simon or to send a
[1:12:17] missionary or to build a church what do
[1:12:20] we have more zeal for a real zeal of God
[1:12:23] will fulfill the great commission of
[1:12:25] Christ
[1:12:26] that's right here's what I hear says
[1:12:31] prayer for zeal so this is what we
[1:12:32] should pray for at the end of the
[1:12:33] service here he says oh Christ of God
[1:12:36] receive these poor people into your
[1:12:37] kingdom someday I must stand yonder at
[1:12:40] the throne of God and give an account
[1:12:41] for my ministry give an account for
[1:12:44] these things that you permitted me to do
[1:12:45] Lord in the midst of the people to
[1:12:47] declare the resurrection of the Lord
[1:12:49] Jesus God I must answer for that Oh God
[1:12:52] burn zeal down into my heart more and
[1:12:57] more and wisdom that I might know how to
[1:13:01] lead the people to the Lord Jesus
[1:13:03] hey man and that beautiful church burn
[1:13:07] it down into my heart Lord more Oh can
[1:13:11] you say Amen
[1:13:12] give me more and more zeal so give me
[1:13:15] that desire to do it and then give me
[1:13:18] wisdom to channel that desire I love
[1:13:23] that a man that's beautiful church what
[1:13:25] a prayer burn it into my heart in other
[1:13:29] words if you get burnt are you gonna
[1:13:30] feel the burning are you gonna feel the
[1:13:32] fire your soul you will if it's the zeal
[1:13:35] of God you'll feel the burning desire
[1:13:37] I've just got to do this nothing's gonna
[1:13:39] stop me from doing this for my Jesus
[1:13:41] that's right
[1:13:43] more and more with wisdom of God that's
[1:13:47] our prayer for tonight amen let me
[1:13:49] summertime here so I don't wear myself
[1:13:51] out all right now I already went over
[1:13:56] this one I don't I think I put an extra
[1:13:58] scripture in there now let's go through
[1:13:59] Furman so let got your Bibles maybe
[1:14:01] we'll have some other people read who
[1:14:02] feel comfortable I know how the young
[1:14:04] people is that okay
[1:14:05] Elijah Rebekah Lydia's okay I don't
[1:14:06] Malachi read for us
[1:14:08] remember fervent is very similar it's
[1:14:11] this boiling boiling stew bubbling up
[1:14:14] love it's kind like that stream brother
[1:14:15] Brad talked about why you boil all the
[1:14:17] time something behind me is pushing me
[1:14:20] see that's as ELA something behind me is
[1:14:22] making me bubble out with love for Jesus
[1:14:25] there's something behind me doing it you
[1:14:27] see that that's the same idea about the
[1:14:30] little stream or Creek it's boiling it's
[1:14:34] moving me to do this like I said on
[1:14:37] Sunday or announcer last Wednesday
[1:14:38] nobody had to ask me to write that book
[1:14:41] for tea right now it's 44,000 words no
[1:14:44] one had to beg me no one had to wake me
[1:14:46] up early to say it's time to work on
[1:14:47] that book or time to get up in time it's
[1:14:50] time to get up and pray and read your
[1:14:51] Bible no one should have to do that to
[1:14:53] you now you might have beat your flesh
[1:14:54] into it every now and then are you ready
[1:14:56] to tell that flesh to shut up and you're
[1:14:58] a liar and get behind me Satan in the
[1:15:00] huh you have to curse it you know area
[1:15:03] or whatever you have to do you might to
[1:15:04] cast it down and cast down the
[1:15:06] reasonings but behind all of that should
[1:15:08] be a zeal for God you should want to do
[1:15:12] the will of God that's for somebody
[1:15:14] who's born again now because you've got
[1:15:16] the zeal of God no one had to beg me to
[1:15:21] make the videos that we made no one has
[1:15:23] to beg me to come here preach and pray
[1:15:25] it and serve God or love my wife no one
[1:15:27] has to beg me to do that the zeal of God
[1:15:29] makes me want to do it amen
[1:15:32] now I got numerous scriptures here but I
[1:15:35] want to just say this know at the top
[1:15:37] lukewarm all it is is just a toned down
[1:15:40] version of being firm it because fervent
[1:15:44] is boiling lukewarm is tepid it's medium
[1:15:47] it's kind of hot but it's not boiling oh
[1:15:51] god help us amen oh god help us help us
[1:15:54] Jesus amen you know what I'm talking
[1:15:56] about
[1:15:57] it's kind of war you kind of joy it but
[1:16:00] there's a time when you really enjoyed
[1:16:01] it
[1:16:02] amen we need to really enjoy the Word of
[1:16:05] God that's right amen see so we got a
[1:16:10] check we got a checkup we gotta be
[1:16:12] honest with ourselves and my boiling and
[1:16:14] the love of God or my own lukewarm mode
[1:16:16] I just got a halfway simmer medium rod I
[1:16:21] don't want that I want to be boiling for
[1:16:23] Jesus amen
[1:16:24] they ain't going to come out right les
[1:16:26] you're boiling like with my spaghetti I
[1:16:28] can make two things eggs and spaghetti
[1:16:30] that spaghetti is not going to come out
[1:16:32] right if it's lukewarm
[1:16:33] it's got to be boiling it's got to be
[1:16:36] bouncing off it's got to be spilling out
[1:16:38] then you toss in the pasta that's all I
[1:16:40] know about cooking that's that's all I
[1:16:42] know right there it's got to be born if
[1:16:44] it ain't moyen it don't have enough heat
[1:16:46] to make it loose and flexible that's
[1:16:49] what we need we didn't need more
[1:16:50] flexible in the spirit praise God the
[1:16:53] great praise the Lord raise our hands
[1:16:54] and pray for others and have a zeal to
[1:16:56] win a soul praise God to be moved by the
[1:16:59] Holy Spirit we don't want a tone now
[1:17:02] inversion we're gonna have to battle to
[1:17:04] be more fervent we're have to crucify
[1:17:06] the flesh to be fervent Amen like act
[1:17:11] like I said after Sunday sermon with
[1:17:13] brother Simon I just had one sermon but
[1:17:15] it gave me so much zeal I came here and
[1:17:17] laid before the Lord praying and crying
[1:17:19] and asking God pleading with God to
[1:17:21] fulfills word these things they don't
[1:17:23] have to be they don't have to be trained
[1:17:26] it's just the love of God in our hearts
[1:17:28] it's the zeal of God in our hearts now
[1:17:32] let's go to acts 18 24 and 25 I'm just
[1:17:36] trying to think of those examples from
[1:17:38] my own life where I know it's God and
[1:17:41] you know your life as well you know when
[1:17:44] it's God acts 18 24 and 25 how about
[1:17:48] Lydia can you read this one acts 18 24
[1:17:52] and 25
[1:18:14] look at Apollo's he was a smooth-talking
[1:18:20] fervent boiling preacher who had the
[1:18:23] Word of God practically memorized right
[1:18:26] he was mighty in the scripture he could
[1:18:29] stand there and quote scripture after
[1:18:30] Scripture and mily convinced him he was
[1:18:33] boiling up and yet he wasn't even born
[1:18:34] again at this point right
[1:18:39] he was fervent he was boiling and he
[1:18:42] could talk and never miss a beat
[1:18:43] never miss quoted scripture moo
[1:18:45] moo-moo-moo-moo he was a mighty man of
[1:18:47] God and an equivalent Percilla Polhemus
[1:18:49] I sure liked his fervency but he needs
[1:18:51] to know the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:53] AHS he knew was the baptism of John he
[1:18:57] there's more he can grow and look how he
[1:18:59] humbled himself and you know the story
[1:19:00] he eventually becomes a real Holy Ghost
[1:19:02] field preacher so much so that in the
[1:19:05] Corinthian church some said I'm of
[1:19:06] Apollo's Apollo's was my spiritual
[1:19:08] father
[1:19:09] oh I'm appalled Paulus - I'm a Peter
[1:19:12] Peter was my father well I'm with Jesus
[1:19:14] and some thing they got so caught up on
[1:19:16] the man's personality they forgot about
[1:19:18] Christ amen but see it's easy to see how
[1:19:22] people would love Apollo's fervency
[1:19:24] don't you I would I wish I was more like
[1:19:27] Apollo's in that way more eloquent I
[1:19:29] didn't misquote words and my wife laughs
[1:19:32] at me every year every week we'll go
[1:19:33] home and say Jessie you said this the
[1:19:35] certain wrong way and I thought oh boy
[1:19:37] forgive me I hope the people just laugh
[1:19:40] at me and pray for me I can learn the
[1:19:43] words better but the point is as Simon
[1:19:47] said a little bit about Sunday I want to
[1:19:48] go over it doesn't matter if the
[1:19:50] preachers fast or slow the preachers got
[1:19:53] to be right with the word I don't know
[1:19:56] when I first came to the message I went
[1:19:58] to both Samuel Browning's church he
[1:19:59] seemed like he was preaching so fast
[1:20:01] we're just going over my head but
[1:20:04] everything he was saying was right and I
[1:20:07] walked over there many times brother
[1:20:08] Adam I'm like I don't even I didn't get
[1:20:10] much out of that but there'd be like one
[1:20:12] time each service he talked about water
[1:20:13] baptism not stand up and say
[1:20:16] everything else about you know thunders
[1:20:18] and seals and all the church ages I'm
[1:20:21] like I don't know much about that but
[1:20:23] when he said water baptism Gloria I said
[1:20:26] I'm in same head so it seemed like he
[1:20:29] was going were too fast but he wasn't
[1:20:30] for the people who were seasoned for it
[1:20:34] and then you'll go hear a preacher who's
[1:20:36] real slow takes his time and you're like
[1:20:40] come on hurry up
[1:20:41] spit it out that's when we get in our
[1:20:44] flesh right but see Apollo's was a fast
[1:20:48] preacher eloquent every word was right
[1:20:52] on he was beautiful mining the scripture
[1:20:54] keeps pulling out Scripture don't you
[1:20:55] have to look at his notes just to could
[1:20:57] quote the scripture and point you to the
[1:20:58] Word of God just laying it all out and
[1:21:00] some people were blessed by that but
[1:21:04] then other people would be more blessed
[1:21:05] with a slow preacher it doesn't really
[1:21:09] matter which one you have you got
[1:21:11] matters which one God has sent for you
[1:21:13] because whatever God has sent for you
[1:21:14] that's what you need whatever God has
[1:21:18] sent for you and you just have to humble
[1:21:20] yourself and just accept what God has
[1:21:22] sent for you because the Bible said God
[1:21:24] has given every man a preacher the Bible
[1:21:26] says that literally now if you hear a
[1:21:30] false doctrine if they like Simon Says
[1:21:32] Simon Says sometimes he's seen preachers
[1:21:34] have preached so fast they'll slip in a
[1:21:35] false doctrine now if you hear that
[1:21:37] church or if he's a real slow preacher
[1:21:40] and he slips in a false doctrine which
[1:21:42] would probably be easier to hear that if
[1:21:45] he's going slow you think so your job is
[1:21:48] not to talk bad about the preacher your
[1:21:50] job is to go correct the preacher let me
[1:21:54] say it again
[1:21:54] if a preacher makes a mistake going too
[1:21:57] fast or he's too slow it's not your job
[1:22:00] to say something bad about that preacher
[1:22:02] it's your job to go correct that
[1:22:04] preacher and the church said see that
[1:22:08] that's where you know you're still in
[1:22:09] the flesh if you can pick up people's
[1:22:11] faults like Simon was saying that's true
[1:22:12] if you have to we should have to serve
[1:22:14] as the Holy Spirit during the sermon if
[1:22:17] you're so spiritual and you pick up
[1:22:21] mistakes then it's your job to correct
[1:22:23] it but it shows you're not very
[1:22:24] spiritual if you talk bad about the
[1:22:26] preacher afterwards
[1:22:27] and don't go correct him and the church
[1:22:30] said right that's truly what it comes
[1:22:33] down to if you're so smart and and
[1:22:35] mature that you can catch them but you
[1:22:38] don't go correct the person then you're
[1:22:39] not very mature you deceive yourself
[1:22:42] because that's what brother Branham said
[1:22:44] no man said he said you brothers are
[1:22:46] duty-bound into Christ if I make a
[1:22:47] mistake come to me privately he said I
[1:22:49] don't care if it's the janitor in the
[1:22:50] back or he said if it's the trustee
[1:22:53] you're duty-bound to correct me so see
[1:22:56] whether you're fast or slow whether
[1:22:59] you're really fervent mind just boiling
[1:23:01] over all the time or if you're just a
[1:23:05] real slow preacher hallelujah Saints you
[1:23:10] know thank bless the Lord hallelujah I'm
[1:23:14] trying to get some a southern draw guess
[1:23:16] but you understand whether your firm
[1:23:20] really fervent and eloquent fast or if
[1:23:24] you're really slow God holds all the
[1:23:27] preachers the same standard be
[1:23:28] absolutely pure to the Word of God
[1:23:30] that's a that's the standard for
[1:23:32] preachers and I just want to put that in
[1:23:35] there because Simon had a good point
[1:23:36] about that I agree there's some
[1:23:38] preachers they preach so fast if they're
[1:23:39] not careful they'll get off on the word
[1:23:41] all right they'll say something they
[1:23:43] should not have said well then it's your
[1:23:44] job it's my job to go correct them all
[1:23:47] right and that is real maturity when you
[1:23:52] can go face-to-face and correct somebody
[1:23:53] that's real maturity I think those are
[1:23:56] the most mature Christians when someone
[1:23:58] makes a mistake you go talk to them
[1:23:59] privately now you're doing what Jesus
[1:24:01] said because most people like to go like
[1:24:03] I said Facebook the Facebook rather than
[1:24:05] face-to-face that just struck me with
[1:24:08] years ago that's right most people like
[1:24:09] to do the easy way instead of going
[1:24:11] face-to-face so let's be real Christians
[1:24:14] now let's go to Romans 12:11 this is
[1:24:16] beautiful right here everyone should
[1:24:18] have a level of boiling in their heart
[1:24:20] no matter what you're called to do or
[1:24:23] they're working to school like some
[1:24:25] people work in a factory like some
[1:24:27] people work in an office like some
[1:24:29] people work in a nursing home like some
[1:24:31] people wherever you're called to work
[1:24:33] everybody should have some level of
[1:24:35] bubbling to do their work
[1:24:38] you should be happy to do your work
[1:24:40] because god bless you
[1:24:41] the job he gave you the strength the
[1:24:45] Bible said the work the work of a man's
[1:24:47] hands is the gift of God God gave you a
[1:24:50] gift when he gave you a job right when
[1:24:52] he gave you the intelligence to do your
[1:24:54] job
[1:24:54] God gave you a gift and we should do it
[1:24:57] with zeal all right Romans 12:11 like
[1:25:03] it's always encouraging to me when
[1:25:04] parents like I just got an email today
[1:25:05] thank you for all you do they said you
[1:25:08] go another text I've got you go above
[1:25:10] and beyond all these other teachers they
[1:25:12] say with all you do that makes me feel
[1:25:16] good like they can feel my zeal to be a
[1:25:19] good teacher that's encouraging I want
[1:25:22] to hear that and so this is what we're
[1:25:27] talking about the Bible said it be
[1:25:29] fervent in all your business so Romans
[1:25:33] 12 I'm sorry I'm getting there yeah
[1:25:39] let's go to 10 though lies you can you
[1:25:41] read 10 and 11 Romans 12:10 11 thank you
[1:25:43] sir
[1:25:59] and the church said did you pay your
[1:26:02] bills on time or send him a few days
[1:26:04] late I'll get to that later
[1:26:06] what do you think you should do do you
[1:26:08] pay him on time
[1:26:09] don't be slothful don't be lazy right
[1:26:13] who likes it lazy workers they might
[1:26:15] like a lazy worker we have any owners
[1:26:17] business owners in here I don't think so
[1:26:19] well I'm a preacher do I like a lazy
[1:26:23] deacon no we got a good deacon by God's
[1:26:25] grace do you want a lazy pastor who
[1:26:29] won't do his work the right way won't
[1:26:31] study the word won't help you when you
[1:26:34] need help you want a lazy pass or sits
[1:26:35] around and everybody everybody who sits
[1:26:38] around the fellowship and everybody
[1:26:39] served me Amen go get me a glass of
[1:26:41] water
[1:26:42] Jose go get me another cupola or another
[1:26:45] plate of lasagna
[1:26:48] who wants a lazy leader
[1:26:51] nobody wants lazier and Paul said no
[1:26:54] Christian should be slothful in their
[1:26:57] business if you tell somebody you're
[1:26:59] gonna pay them you tell someone you're
[1:27:01] gonna do something for them do it be
[1:27:04] fervent about it the Bible commands us
[1:27:06] not to be lazy amen we should be brother
[1:27:11] BAM said he said should a Christian work
[1:27:14] and pay tithes and brother BAM said the
[1:27:15] one person that will work and pay their
[1:27:17] ties is a Christian that's the one
[1:27:20] person that will praise God that's the
[1:27:23] lesson I've learned I've tried to help
[1:27:24] out so many people and they sit back and
[1:27:26] they can't find a job for weeks and
[1:27:28] weeks shame on them and I have God's had
[1:27:31] to show me that that if they're not more
[1:27:33] fervent about it then they're not even
[1:27:35] interested in really and getting help
[1:27:36] they're just they want a handout god's
[1:27:38] had to show me that and I've had to
[1:27:39] learn the hard way I've helped our
[1:27:40] people then I realized now I should not
[1:27:43] have helped but I've had to learn that
[1:27:46] because the heart of me see somebody
[1:27:48] struggling and I just want to help but I
[1:27:52] found the people you help the least are
[1:27:54] the ones that love God the most amen
[1:27:57] right and that true and brother man
[1:28:01] there's a quote on it brother BAM was
[1:28:03] talking and I think it's in he cares
[1:28:04] that you care if I'm not mistaken and
[1:28:07] brother Branson
[1:28:09] was helping somebody out the brother
[1:28:10] looked at him and said brother branham
[1:28:11] he said be careful he said you help him
[1:28:14] today said you'll be packing them
[1:28:15] tomorrow on your back I thought my
[1:28:20] that's right see there's some people
[1:28:24] that would just lean on you now I've had
[1:28:25] a lot of people lean on me the last few
[1:28:27] years but part of it's my fault I've
[1:28:31] learned that now and here's the example
[1:28:34] here's what it was just a few nights ago
[1:28:36] that struck me when I came out of
[1:28:39] college and I realized my wife was
[1:28:42] pregnant we already married two year
[1:28:43] before my senior year when I realized
[1:28:46] Lydia was in in utero and Lydia was
[1:28:49] coming I didn't have a job I just
[1:28:52] graduated college I got on my knees in
[1:28:55] my bedroom and I told you this before
[1:28:57] about doubt again because it's right
[1:28:58] what I'm talking about
[1:28:59] I cried on my bed I was only 1 in my
[1:29:03] bedroom my memory was right in there an
[1:29:05] acronym I can show you the house where
[1:29:07] it was I was crying I was saying god I'd
[1:29:09] rather die than not be able to provide
[1:29:11] for this baby and it was so sad my wife
[1:29:14] had a job and I didn't I just graduated
[1:29:16] from college a few days ago I didn't
[1:29:18] have a job so I begged God I begged God
[1:29:21] for maybe half hour and you know how
[1:29:23] maybe was 20 minute prayer I don't know
[1:29:24] how long it was but I was desperate I'd
[1:29:26] said rather die then not have a job that
[1:29:28] same day I called Bueller's and
[1:29:30] wodsworth said can I have my job back in
[1:29:33] groceries and they said I guess we give
[1:29:35] you 15 hours I said I'll take 15 hours
[1:29:38] amen because the Bible said we should be
[1:29:42] fervent in our business we should be not
[1:29:45] slothful not lazy
[1:29:47] well bless God I'll sit around and I'll
[1:29:48] just enjoy the dr. pepper I'll just
[1:29:51] enjoy a easy life and God will send me a
[1:29:53] job no you go get a job that's what I
[1:29:56] learned and that's what I've got I've
[1:29:57] got to apply that to other people now
[1:29:59] I've got learned that if they're not
[1:30:02] desperate for help and they're not doing
[1:30:04] everything they can do if they will
[1:30:05] humble themselves and go work at Burger
[1:30:07] King or they won't go work at Walmart
[1:30:10] then how much do they really want a job
[1:30:12] how much do they really want help
[1:30:15] because the Bible said we're not
[1:30:17] slothful we're not lazy in other words I
[1:30:19] will
[1:30:20] find a source of income somehow that's
[1:30:25] right
[1:30:26] like I said this is what Christians
[1:30:30] should be serving the Lord fervent in
[1:30:32] spirit oh I'm ready that means you're
[1:30:35] mine my mind is ready to do something
[1:30:37] for God I want to serve the Lord
[1:30:39] I don't do something for Jesus and then
[1:30:42] also I want to be the best teacher I can
[1:30:43] be I want to teach these children I want
[1:30:46] to help them to memorize their facts 1
[1:30:48] through 10
[1:30:49] oh you want to be fervent about you want
[1:30:52] to have zeal about it here's a beautiful
[1:30:56] one James 5:16 let's go there talk about
[1:31:00] fervent prayer all right James 5:16 now
[1:31:08] I think the context is here Elijah if
[1:31:11] I'm not mistaken James 5:16 right yeah
[1:31:20] cuz in verse 16 says confess your faults
[1:31:23] one to another and pray for another that
[1:31:24] you may be healed
[1:31:25] I got 10 minutes here so bear with me
[1:31:28] the effectual fervent prayer of a
[1:31:30] righteous man availeth much in other
[1:31:32] words we've got to pray with a boiling
[1:31:36] kind of desire like other words God this
[1:31:40] desire is just bubbling up in me we've
[1:31:42] got to pray we've got to feel the
[1:31:44] bubbling of love I say like that we got
[1:31:46] to feel the bubbling of desperation and
[1:31:49] who's the example as soon as he says
[1:31:51] this who does he give the example of
[1:31:53] Elijah look at verse 17 the Elias was a
[1:31:57] man subject to like passions as we are
[1:31:59] and yet he prayed earnestly that it
[1:32:03] might not rain earnestly so now we get a
[1:32:07] look into Elijah's life how did he pray
[1:32:10] when he said Lord may not rain for
[1:32:13] three-and-a-half years how did he pray
[1:32:15] was it like Lord if you got Time Lord if
[1:32:19] you got a few minutes can you just you
[1:32:20] know can you keep the rain off let me
[1:32:22] I'll go back to work now did he just
[1:32:24] take a little five-minute break and say
[1:32:26] Lord this has really helped me out this
[1:32:28] isn't really improved to Ahab that I'm a
[1:32:29] man of God could you let it not rain for
[1:32:32] three and a half years you think that's
[1:32:33] how you pray church
[1:32:34] I imagine you found a prayer closet or
[1:32:37] something like that he fervently prayed
[1:32:40] it was boiling love it was just boiled
[1:32:44] up he really prayed and and I heard a
[1:32:47] preacher preach on this this week on
[1:32:48] YouTube I found a good sermon on this
[1:32:50] and he used Elijah and as the example
[1:32:53] and he said a man is only as strong a
[1:32:56] man is only as good as his prayer life
[1:32:58] and this is the example that he used
[1:33:01] Elijah who just wasn't some half-hearted
[1:33:04] prayer he prayed with all his heart he
[1:33:09] was boiling up he was bubbling up God
[1:33:12] please close the heavens so Ahab will
[1:33:15] know that judgments of God are on him
[1:33:18] and God honored his prayer the fervent
[1:33:23] prayer of a righteous man availeth much
[1:33:26] the times in Columbus when I seen people
[1:33:29] healed brother Clements wife it was two
[1:33:33] people that had babies in the until 2015
[1:33:36] Hosea was there at one of them and we
[1:33:39] were both praying fervently brother
[1:33:40] remember that you felt the presence of
[1:33:42] the Lord and you kind of I think even
[1:33:43] before told them that God heard their
[1:33:45] prayer that night didn't you yep he
[1:33:47] foretold him as the spirit of prophecy
[1:33:49] the spirit of Jesus Christ is spirit of
[1:33:51] prophecy he told that couple God heard
[1:33:53] your prayers and nine months later the
[1:33:55] baby was born on my birthday God has a
[1:33:59] sense of humor honey but we didn't pray
[1:34:02] like oh I wonder if God will do this
[1:34:03] fervently with tears we pre sang songs
[1:34:07] before we pray we read the Bible we did
[1:34:09] a little just a short little Bible study
[1:34:10] about Abraham and Sarah and those things
[1:34:13] and that one time I pray for the teacher
[1:34:16] and I sigh I rebuked that mountain of
[1:34:21] yeah I can't marry the word fertility
[1:34:25] yep the mountain of infertility thank
[1:34:26] you i rebuked it in prayer in the name
[1:34:28] of Jesus Christ I was praying fervently
[1:34:30] it wasn't a half-hearted prayer Church
[1:34:33] we need to pray with fervency this is
[1:34:36] the example God gives we must pray
[1:34:38] earnestly because the fervent prayer of
[1:34:42] a righteous man prevails much and the
[1:34:44] church said
[1:34:45] a man glory see we need we need more
[1:34:48] fervency now not to brag and boast and
[1:34:50] say look how much emotion I got that's
[1:34:52] not it
[1:34:53] people can tell if you don't live the
[1:34:55] life people can tell viewers putting on
[1:34:56] emotion but when you've got Rios
[1:34:59] anointing you don't care what anybody
[1:35:00] says Amen because God is anointing you
[1:35:03] God put that boiling in you for a
[1:35:05] purpose it's exactly right
[1:35:09] hallelujah now I got a couple more in a
[1:35:14] more close here that's what I say ten
[1:35:16] minutes yeah I got eight minutes on here
[1:35:17] so bear with me so remember that that
[1:35:21] fervent that boiling is like the burning
[1:35:23] incense right because incense is likened
[1:35:26] unto prayer when you got those those
[1:35:28] spices and you got those herbs we'd say
[1:35:31] you know whatever substance they are
[1:35:33] when you burn that I always saw the
[1:35:36] incense sticks my friends always an
[1:35:37] incense stick so I I got the wrong
[1:35:39] picture I don't have the Israelite
[1:35:41] picture they just burnt the incense
[1:35:43] sticks and lit it like a like a firework
[1:35:45] look like a firework or something like
[1:35:47] that but the point is prayer needs to
[1:35:50] burn in our hearts praise the Lord we
[1:35:53] got to feel it when we're praying for
[1:35:55] somebody we need to feel it Lord like I
[1:35:58] want to feel what sister so-and-so what
[1:36:00] brother so-and-so I was going for I want
[1:36:01] to feel that when I pray that's a
[1:36:03] fervent prayer amen we need fervent
[1:36:07] prayers that's how he lied you prayed
[1:36:09] and God answered Elijah's prayer
[1:36:13] hallelujah that's the word of the Lord
[1:36:16] Churchill assed two times fervent is
[1:36:19] only used seven times New Testament
[1:36:21] seven times so it's a word that means
[1:36:23] boiling but zeal is used more often so
[1:36:27] let's go laps on first Peter - lets go -
[1:36:29] first Peter - it's right after James
[1:36:31] that works out good right in
[1:36:33] chronological order first Peter 1:22 all
[1:36:41] right now this
[1:36:42] something that we all want to see don't
[1:36:43] we Rebecca can you read that I think
[1:36:46] it's your turn honey would you read that
[1:36:47] first Peter 1:22 thanks Lydia amen
[1:37:03] in other words don't have pretend love
[1:37:05] love people like you really love them
[1:37:09] that's why I tell everybody if anyone
[1:37:11] ever needs help here just please let me
[1:37:13] know if you want to talk to me on the
[1:37:15] phone just let me know if you were to
[1:37:16] meet me at Panera if you want to meet me
[1:37:18] at the church let me know I'll do
[1:37:20] everything I can to help you out because
[1:37:23] I don't want to love you pretend I want
[1:37:25] to love you with a fervent heart and I
[1:37:27] hope you want to love everybody in here
[1:37:29] with the fervent heart with the boiling
[1:37:31] love I'm just bubbling over can't wait
[1:37:33] to love my brother and sister in the
[1:37:36] Lord
[1:37:37] that's real fervent love right there
[1:37:39] that's what Christians should have
[1:37:40] remember they should know we're
[1:37:41] Christians by our boiling up fervent
[1:37:43] bubbling over love for one for another
[1:37:47] that's right that's what Jesus Christ
[1:37:49] said 1st Peter 4:8 we'll close right
[1:37:54] there I believe yeah cuz the next one
[1:37:55] yeah I just gave two examples of zealous
[1:37:57] repents well let's look at first Peter
[1:37:59] 4:8 and then I think after this when
[1:38:06] we're ready for verse 20 of chapter
[1:38:07] three behold I stand at the door knock
[1:38:10] amen I love going through like this it's
[1:38:13] so it's so comforting to know that we're
[1:38:15] preaching just what brother Branham
[1:38:17] preached went as he preached the word
[1:38:18] cuz he wasn't perfect by the gram you
[1:38:20] know he's a man but as he wrote it in
[1:38:22] the assault in the word taught it we
[1:38:25] teach the same thing
[1:38:26] 1st Peter 4:8 I love this
[1:38:33] above all things my let's all read this
[1:38:38] one together ready first Peter 4:8 on
[1:38:40] three one two three and above all things
[1:38:43] have fervent charity among yourselves
[1:38:46] for charity shall cover the multitude of
[1:38:49] sin praise God
[1:38:52] if there's one thing Bride of Christ
[1:38:54] fellowship needs it's that we need to
[1:38:57] love each other better
[1:38:59] we need to love each other more and if
[1:39:03] someone's not loving you you've got to
[1:39:05] let them know you got to let them know
[1:39:08] now the time when you do the the sooner
[1:39:11] the better usually unless you got a
[1:39:13] leading the Lord to wait on it but
[1:39:15] there's somebody you can't love in this
[1:39:16] church you need to talk to them and tell
[1:39:19] them why you're having a hard time
[1:39:21] loving them because one thing above all
[1:39:23] we should have the Bible said is love
[1:39:26] fervent love one for another praise God
[1:39:30] you believe that we should just be like
[1:39:33] a beehive of love right now let me just
[1:39:35] visit buzzing all over each other you
[1:39:37] know like a beehive as a program said a
[1:39:40] church is like a beehive of activity
[1:39:42] loving each other helping each other
[1:39:46] right that's what real fervent
[1:39:49] Christians do they love one another now
[1:39:53] I'll say like this one of the greatest
[1:39:54] ways you can show me you love me is
[1:39:56] praying for me and coming to church
[1:39:57] every time that's one of the greatest
[1:39:59] ways you can show me that you love me
[1:40:02] praise the Lord that means so much to me
[1:40:05] and you just let me know how can I love
[1:40:08] you better just let me know one time
[1:40:10] Zura told me that when we should have
[1:40:13] these little meetings we call them
[1:40:15] personal interviews and and I asked her
[1:40:17] and at Panera at Congo Falls I said sir
[1:40:20] what can I do better for you how can I
[1:40:22] serve you better as a Christian she's a
[1:40:24] brother Jesse she said you ask me that
[1:40:25] all the time she said you need to be or
[1:40:28] she said I need to be asking you what I
[1:40:29] can do for you better I said thank you
[1:40:33] that's very nice compliment but the
[1:40:35] point is we need to love each other more
[1:40:39] that's the whole point of this fervently
[1:40:42] at work we need to be the most fervent
[1:40:44] workers at church we should be fervently
[1:40:46] trying to seize anyway
[1:40:47] help today who's not here could I call
[1:40:49] them after church can I see my wife does
[1:40:51] a good job of that I'm sure some of you
[1:40:52] do too brother so-and-so or sister
[1:40:55] so-and-so why aren't you here she's good
[1:40:56] with the sisters I tried to text the
[1:40:58] brothers every time they're not here
[1:40:59] because you love them we want to
[1:41:02] fervently care about them if one person
[1:41:06] loves you in Akron it should be somebody
[1:41:07] here if not please let me peace let me
[1:41:10] know if someone if you're not feeling
[1:41:13] loved here please let me know we're the
[1:41:15] ones that should love out of anybody in
[1:41:18] this whole city of Akron we should have
[1:41:20] a loved one for another let's say into
[1:41:21] our feet by God's grace fervent we can
[1:41:25] be a fervent preacher we want to do that
[1:41:27] we want to be a fervent in business
[1:41:29] whatever job we have school where we are
[1:41:31] business we want to be fervent in that
[1:41:34] but most of we want to be fervent
[1:41:36] prayers but most of all we want to be
[1:41:38] firm at loving one another and those
[1:41:44] adding it to this here but I'm just
[1:41:45] gonna just mention it yes sound special
[1:41:48] Oh wonderful praise the Lord sounds good
[1:41:51] hallelujah
[1:41:53] love that thanks for loving us that way
[1:41:55] brother we appreciate that
[1:41:56] but if there's two easy examples to see
[1:41:59] fervent repentance it's Nineveh because
[1:42:01] they they rent their their clothes where
[1:42:04] they rent their garments and they sat in
[1:42:05] sackcloth and ashes
[1:42:07] forgive us right they even they even
[1:42:10] made their animals if I'm not mistaken
[1:42:11] fast or something like that they even
[1:42:12] they even they were made of their
[1:42:14] animals humble themselves how can the
[1:42:16] animal humble themselves they were so
[1:42:19] sincere in other words everybody in our
[1:42:21] home needs to be aware that we're
[1:42:23] repenting before God and God will honor
[1:42:26] instead of burning them up God honor
[1:42:28] them by forgiving them anytime we can
[1:42:32] fervently repent fervently say we're
[1:42:35] sorry God looks down and said that's my
[1:42:38] boy that's my daughter they're just
[1:42:41] they're just the way they need to be god
[1:42:44] loves someone who's fervent whatever
[1:42:46] they do have an encouragement be
[1:42:48] enthused have have zeal have emotion
[1:42:52] have strength whatever you do do with
[1:42:56] all your heart for the Lord how many
[1:42:57] know the Bible says that whatever you do
[1:42:59] do it with all your might
[1:43:02] and then Zacchaeus he was so zealous he
[1:43:05] said anyone that I stole from I'm paying
[1:43:07] him back fourfold anyone I've stolen
[1:43:11] from I'm gonna make sure I pay them back
[1:43:15] times four see he was willing to go face
[1:43:19] to face then knock on the door and they
[1:43:22] say oh are you gonna take my money again
[1:43:23] no I'm giving you money back and I'm
[1:43:26] giving you four times the interest
[1:43:27] that's a real repentance right there
[1:43:31] that's real zeal
[1:43:33] all right that's real carefulness that's
[1:43:36] real revenge against the devil nah amen
[1:43:39] glory amen god bless you Church what's

[1:48:10] everyone needs more zeal to serve the
[1:48:14] Lord Lord I remember your prophet prayed
[1:48:17] that prayer so now I pray it for
[1:48:19] everyone Lord God their hands don't need
[1:48:21] to be up Lord but I believe every heart
[1:48:24] is lifted up Lord your prophets said
[1:48:27] Lord burn azita down into my heart
[1:48:32] hallelujah may the burning fire of God
[1:48:35] the call from the altar Lord may it

[1:48:43] boiling bubbling over power desire of
[1:48:47] the Holy Spirit to want to serve you

[1:49:04] go love somebody it won't be a burden to
[1:49:07] go help somebody but Lord we will feel
[1:49:12] that zeal in our hearts it won't be a
[1:49:16] burden to obey the word instead of
[1:49:18] catering to our flesh Oh God
[1:49:20] bring that fervency back Lord to every
[1:49:23] heart Lord God burn at the burn be felt
[1:49:27] by our hearts dear God and your prophet

[1:49:44] instantly we would wake up about hearing
[1:49:46] the court of the day reading our Bibles
[1:49:48] pray helping somebody instead of
[1:49:51] dreading the next day Oh God forgive us
[1:49:53] of going to other things Lord for
[1:49:57] comfort instead of going to you maybe we
[1:50:02] feel your fervent desire may the heart
