========================================

I don't think I've ever uh preached out of this text before so I was really I felt inspired I felt uh uh that the Lord had kind of opened this just this very simple thought up to me um so I want to just look at this thought now it's it's a maybe a pretty powerful title or not maybe but uh communion with Christ or devils and uh so you know we want communion with Christ but you know we do have a lot of Mind battles you know sometimes we uh entertain the wrong thoughts and so uh just want to kind of bring it out in that kind of light that we never we want to see it as such an awful thing right we don't want to uh have communion with the Devils we want to have communion with Christ Alone amen yes so it's a hopefully it's a fresh thought here maybe a a fresh look at this text here 2 Corinthians 614 want to greet the live streamers God bless them and I just kind of felt a burden to try to get as many sermons out as I can you know I feel like you know uh if we preach God's word it will never return void amen someone will need to hear this sermon praise God someone maybe in this nation or across the sea um God's word cannot return void so the more we put out there then the more needs that you know God can use us to meet by God's grace so amen very simple but just you know just a fresh reminder to me U Second Corinthians 6:14 we'll read that and then we'll have a word of prayer here let's read that on three 1 2 3 be not unequally Yol together with unbelievers for what Fellowship have rightousness with unrighteousness and what communion have light Darkness amen let's have a word of prayer if you have a need on your heart let's make it known unto God here oh yes L father God we're thankful Lord for tonight Lord God thank you for these songs that we can sing Lord and worship you and give you glory we just want to honor you we want to Adore You Lord God we want to abide in you Lord Jesus and Lord we're grateful today we can abide in you Lord and we want to use the word that we received today the anointing that we received today Lord God to guide us into this coming week Lord God and strengthen us as we uh see Lord that day approaching Lord your coming Lord God and and father we just want to humbly Lord reach out to you Lord and ask that your Holy Spirit would Minister to all the needs here tonight Lord and prepare us for communion we're grateful Lord for this opportunity and all the efforts uh Lord to be in this room here tonight again so we thank you for your mercy and Grace in Jesus Christ Christ's name and the Saints said amen amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God so I want to thank brother amen I think brother amen and bang were talking yesterday about we could get back in here so I want to thank them let's give them round Applause amen get back in we're grateful for all the efforts brother amen especially and uh uh but just also know you know like I said they might start uh the construction this week so we might have to go back there Wednesday that's why I'm glad we can leave the chair you know kind of set up in there we might have to go back there Wednesday or even at my house so appreciate your flexibility and you know God allowed it so God always brings us through it you know am and uh very very just thankful to have a place uh especially on a hot day like today I'm I'm thankful to have some air conditioning amen right so we're grateful to be here tonight seem like there's something else I want to say some preliminaries but I can't really think of it I don't really think I can think of oh yeah well I want to pray for brother um Brian Hawkins said his son is battling a lot of the same things he suffers with so I don't know if it's Crohn's disease or something like that so we just want to pray at the end we can pray for him um and we have the communion ready I want to thank my wife for making the communion bread honey thank you for doing that I want to thank uh us the better tasting wine so thanks to every last one was pretty good that last one I got was pretty bitter so thank you for the uh better tasted wine hopefully it's better tasted I think it's the same brand at Jewish wine we appreciate that by God's grace the kosher wine so we'll take a moment I am going to set my watch here this time I remembered I didn't remember you know earlier uh today this morning I'll try to set an hour timer and we'll kind of see how that goes um you know our text here was 2 Corinthians 6 14 I don't I don't think I've ever preach out of this text before for communion so hopefully it'll be a fresh look at at this text here tonight I thought I would give you the U the definitions of of communion so you had an idea you know we talk about having communion and we talk about having the Lord's supper and so you know supper is basically you know right right having lunch or having I'm sorry having a meal with someone right so that that the imagery that we get here tonight we're having a meal with the Lord we're sitting down at his table how many grateful that his table is is still we can still sit at it hallelujah amen that God invites us to his table right there's a lot of tables you could be at right a lot of places you could go or we're thankful that we can come to God's table Hallelujah and we can Feast with God Almighty it's quite an invitation to be at the Lord's table Hallelujah and so communion means you know Fellowship Association uh joint participation intercourse talking uh I like that word intimacy you know like when you sit down with someone and start talking with them at a table you know or eating you you you often times get their intimate thoughts you know you get you get uh more personal thoughts they could share with you you know that's why you know when you go out to eat you know I like to sit at I like to sit at the table with my wife so I can talk to about some personal things I don't like to be too close to people you know I don't want them to hear my business or hear my thoughts or my prayer requests or you know personal uh things that I'm thinking about I like to have just that communion there uh that intimacy it's a sign or pledge of Fellowship uh so it means uh jointly you know jointly contributed so jointly means two people you know uh both both people at a fellowship or communion participate brother Brandon says you talk to God God talks back to you right brother calls it two fellows in one ship so we want to see that it's joint participation uh you know I think in our lives I think we would be most uh uh we'd be most battling you know us having communion with God God's always ready to talk to us but it's it's us sometimes we don't make enough time to talk to God the church said right you know with maybe we get battled with prayer or you know listening to enough sermons you know to feel close to God where we're uh really strengthened in the word of God and so you know God is always ready for a word to give us God always wants to give us some participation right he wants to give us a word he wants to God always wants to have some intimacy with us isn't that Wonder so wonderful of God he always wants to pour out his heart to us right he always wants to give us a fresh Vision or a fresh Revelation Hallelujah and so we're uh we're we're we're commanded here by God you know to come together and have uh communion but I you know I just want to remind us of this thought you know there lots of people gathering in churches today and you might have been raising them too that they were having more communion with Devils than they were with the Holy Spirit but now remember Church remember balum could have communion with both right Judas for a while had communion with the right one but then he chose the wrong one at the end right so we want to remember that as well you know people that have gifts of God uh you know they can have communion with God sometimes but then sometimes they have communion with Devils so we have to remember that you know some people uh we we know there's questions on their lives right and then and then God might do something great through them well that that's part of their communion yeah but they have communion with both sides may God help us to just have communion with God's side Hallelujah that's the uh that that's the uh that's the deception of the One World Church that's the deception of this Antichrist move the mother Harlot and her do her daughter churches right they have communion with both at times m you know recently you know heard about all I don't know if you heard about all the Benny hin stuff you know this summer but there was numerous people that said hey I got healed I got healed either listening to him I got healed at one of his uh meetings in fact there's a brother in the message who used to go to those and said they were a lot of those things were real now some of them were false like some of the things that came out this summer people didn't get healed or they pretended healings but then you what's interesting is you have people on the other side saying I got healed in there or or you know they'll say uh Reach Out And Touch the TV screen and God will heal you there's people that actually say they got healed so you know you have to remember that some of these things are genuine right the rain falls on the just and the unjust that's right and so you know they they do create the atmosphere they'll create an atmosphere of worship of expectation and so God can anoint them for that per particular moment but then like as you can see sometimes they'll have videos afterwards where people will do drugs right the same and the Bible said Jesus said don't let both come out don't let corrupt communication come out of a good a a good a sister right I'm sorry a good Fountain right don't let evil Waters and good Waters come out of the same Fountain don't let corrupt fruit and good fruit come out of the same tree amen either make the tree good or make the tree corrupt in other words what is Jesus giving he's giving a warning against living in iniquity workers of iniquity so um you know we're thankful we want to have communion with the Holy Spirit and we we of course we know we want our Doctrine to be God's Doctrine uh the doctrine of the Holy Spirit but remember you know the Bible said expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed that means they open themselves up they start listening to seducing Spirits it sounds so good right uh but it's actually a doctrine of a devil and see what do they do they speak lies in hypocrisy and that actually means a stage player they're just good actors and actresses right they're lying but it looks like they're telling the truth because they're such good actors y yeah right so what does it always come down to brother ad says it comes down to the word test right you you test you know you never you you know everything by their fruit you you test a tree by its fruit you test a person by the word test when it all comes down to the word what do they say about the word amen what are they living about the word hallelujah and see their conscience is seared with the hot iron they can't feel what we feel right they can't feel the same conviction that you feel you know You' feel conviction I'd never go there I'd never say that I'd never do that they can't feel that because their conscience is sear with the hot iron that's how you know they've opened themselves up to demonic Spirit or they have had communion with Devils right and those are just some of the examples I remember I took you through maybe 15 or 20 uh false doctrines that you know a couple years ago were clearly doctrines of devils and one of them was forbid to marry and it's even these people I believe it's even these churches that are saying don't get married because the Rapture is coming soon right because that'll create some type of uh the Bible said it's better to marry than to burn right if if if a person's burning with passions it's better that they get married married then they battle the spirit of lust is that true so you even got to be watching with those type of Ministries that would do something like that try to forbid marriage when God has commanded those things are good yeah and you know of staining from meats you know like I told you recently you know um that person tried to enter into one of these new message churches and tried to bring back legalism I like how he turned it down Paul said I wouldn't give him a space of one hour I wouldn't even give him one hour to spread their lives in our church that's what we need H that's what we all need we all want to we all want to be able to detect that evil spirit and just stop it as soon as we can not welcome here we're not going to talk about this right so I told the brother I said you know just talk to the church there see if anybody was moved by it if anybody's moved by it we'll come in and preach on it but thankfully nobody was moved by they all they all recognize that evil spirit trying to get back in think about that an evil spirit saying oh just don't eat shrimp just don't eat pork you'll be more holy isn't that such a lying Spirit such a seducing Spirit oh because you because any real believer you want to be more holy so it could it could almost seem like oh maybe that's keeping me from my victory maybe that's keeping me from my prayer answered see how that could be a seducing Spirit you know like uh when we come in the message some of our friends they didn't go to college you know because because uh there was a lot of pressure oh there's a lot of trouble in college well there's a lot of trouble on the job too there's a lot of Temptations in college yes there is there's a lot of Temptations on the job too yes and remember my wife reminded me this you're going to be tempted no matter where you are remember I told you that testimony of a former Amish man he had never watched anything on the internet he never even seen the internet he never even seen an evil movie but he was tempted remember to do I'll say it like this beastly things with animals a man do you remember when I told you that that was a good reminder my wife told me about that story so see and brother B tells it you know but said we got our kids in the in the high school he said I wish I could take them up there on the Indian Reservation he said but no matter where you are the sin is going to come out in the person no matter where you are now you want to set your children up you want to set your family up the best that possibly can but remember Satan's like a roaring lion he's prowling around trying to T people so no matter where you are you're going to have to stand up and battle Satan Hallelujah so just something to keep in mind you know you don't willingly put your family or you don't willingly put your your your your yourself in bad situations but you got to remember no matter how much you try to protect yourself the enemy is going to try to slip in somehow amen so I thought that was a a a very good uh a very good thing oh yeah and that brother told me he said he learned that from other Amish people Al so the honest teenagers would kind of joke around about it so see it just passes down through generations you could be totally free from internet totally free from many magazines or anything like that and the things just pass down because Satan's real but he's a genius at his job and you got to be ready to resist him Hallelujah and turn it down and God created all these creatures Hallelujah to be uh received with Thanksgiving to them that know the truth Hal hallelujah amen now uh I read this a few weeks ago and and Peter just gives a master class now they got something today called master classes you know in other words if you want to learn how to do a a YouTube video you can take a master class on that or uh it's sad to say but even Hillary Clinton did a master class no that's not a master class if you ask me but in other words it's just a fun way to say you know this is the best teaching you can get on a topic right and so I want to go there uh let's go there real quick you know second Peter chapter 2 I I will try to read through this quickly there's over 20 attributes I thought Peter taught a Holy Ghost Master Class on false teachers amen verse one but there were also false prophets also among the people even there should be false teachers among you who privately shall bring IND damnable heresies even denying the Lord and see denying the word because the Lord is the word that brought them and bring I'm sorry that brought them and bring upon call themselves Swift destruction okay so notice they're going to bring in heresies and they're going to deny the word and many shall follow their pernicious ways so see that tells us again few there be that find the narrow road most people that go to church will be in false churches many many will be on the broad path and by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of I just saw a good man that he's got I mean he seems like a good man on YouTube but he just called William brandom a false prophet all because and this guy's a really good man he can see Benny Hinson he can see all but he can't see the truth about and uh brother Bram because he said trinitarianism is of the devil what a stumbling stone that is to some people three persons in the god three persons in one God that don't it's God is if God is a god he's one person amen How could a God be three persons it goes against any logical sense at all it's illogical but you know they they but they speak evil of the way of truth because they don't understand the truth y now look through covetousness so see this is what false teachers will do they really want something from you covetousness shall they with Fain now that Fain means pretend yeah or hypocrisy with fake words in other words they're faking they're not really sincere they make merchandise of you so see they just want the people's money so they'll do anything to get your money yeah right whose judgment now of a long time linger not and their damnation slumbereth not for God spare not the angels that sin but cast them down to Hell and deliver them into chains of Darkness to be reserved in the judgment and spare not the old world but save Noah the eighth person a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly and turning the cities of sod gomorah into ashes condemn them with an overthrow making them an example unto those that should after live ungodly so see we're seeing Moses I'm sorry Noah preached righteously and all these false teachers are teaching unrighteously all right verse 7 and delivered just lot vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked now I preached this years ago my wife reminded me of this I preached this years ago at least lot was vexed by the homosexuality right a lot of churches today accept homosexuality so it looks like how could they be saved because a lot was at least tormented by it Hallelujah see Church ought to open up our eyes think about the churches some of our friends and family members are in and we need to keep praying for them by God's grace because at least the sodomite things the sodomite things caused him to be vexed it tormented him for that the righteous man dwelling among them in seeing and hearing Vex his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful Deeds see the evil things we see evil things we hear it should cause us torment we should not like to be around it and I'm really talking about our phones and our tablets I'm really talking about that that's what's going to try to tempt Us in these days yeah right most of you are not going to go into a bar most of you are aren't going to go into a uh you know whatever a brothel you know something awful like that but what's going to get us is Satan's going to he's going to desensitize us to sin right and so we have to make sure the things that we see if they're wrong they should cause us torment if sin is not causing us torment we've officially backslid Hallelujah because even a righteous man was vexed by this he was tormented by this in other words we can't lose our sensitivity to the Holy Spirit right the Lord knoweth how to deliver the ungodly out of tempt oh we should all say Amen to that the Lord knows how to deliver us out of our Temptations hallelujah amen he'll keep he'll run after us and he'll chase us and he'll he'll chase us down until he brings us Deliverance amen amen that's what he did remember he almost dragged out of Sodom remember Angels almost had to drag him out and God may God help us to live like Abraham so God don't have to drag us out of sin conditions amen he's able to reserve the unjust under the day of judgment to be punished but now here back to the false teachers verse 10 but chiefly them that walk after the Flesh in the lust of uncleanness so lust uncleanness they despise government presumptuous are they self-willed they're not afraid to speak evil the dignities be very careful who you're speaking evil against whereas Angels which are greater in power and might bring not raing accusation against them before the Lord again Jude says this Jude and Peter are so similar in their writings it's almost the same type of setup and format and outline remember even Michael wouldn't rebuke I'm sorry even Michael wouldn't bring a railing accusation against Satan he just said the Lord rebuke thee church that's all you got to do when those demons come just say Satan I rebuke you I rebuke you get thou behind me in the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah how many doing it you doing iten you better do it praise God you better do it look at verse 12 but these As Natural BR beasts made to be taken and destroyed speak the things they understand not and shall utterly perish in their own corruption see they're already corrupting spiritually with all their false doctrines their spiritual lives are already corrupting and they speak against our sisters wearing dresses they speak against our sisters not cutting our hair right they speak against our brothers and uh trying to live a holy life and not wear shorts and things like they speak against the things they don't even understand because if they just read the Bible they'd see it's in the Bible Y and yet they keep going deeper in corruption right their lives more corrupted not more holy not more like Christ but corrupting getting broken down right corruption is breaking down uh less looking like it's Li alive it looks more dead all the time all right verse 13 and shall receive the reward of unrighteousness as they count it pleasured uh to right in the daytime spots they are and blemishes sporting themselves with their own deceiving while they Feast with you so see they they're they're deceived that's why they speak against the way of truth they're deceived verse 14 having eyes full of adultery that's why our brothers got to get control over our eyes right because this is an attribute of false prophets right false teachers this is oh good I've never seen it before this is uh this is what lot lot lot wouldn't let his eyes go there right lot was vexed by this even lot but that means everybody else in Sodom it was okay to see all all this adultery or all this sexual sin that cannot cease from sin church we get tempted you know we get tested all these things but we got to bring an end to habitual sin we should not have habitual sins in our lives right if we are we're starting to commune with evil spirits right just in the mind I'm not talking about the soul I'm talking about the Mind mhm they beguile unstable Souls that's what these false teachers do they deceive unstable Souls they're not stable in the word of God Amen in heart they have exercise with Covetous practices curse children these this are the attributes of the the curse group The Serpent seed right ice full of adultery they can't cease from sinning they deceive and beguile they deceive others which have forsaken the right way and have gone astray following the way of balam the son of Boer who loveed the wages of unrighteousness now now we're reminded of this the reality of false teachers and false churches and all these things they love the pleasures of the world more than they love God Amen Paul said they're lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God they love communion with evil spirits for their own lust rather than communing with God yeah hallelujah amen but he was rebuked for his iniquity the dumb ass speaking with man's voice for bad The Madness of the Prophet there's proof right there any one who's on that side they're insane because the Bible said Madness so most of these people go to these mega churches where they're allowed to live in sin whether homosexuality adultery fornication they are actually insane spiritually y the Bible says it right there and those preachers they're the most insane of all of them because they're getting rich they made merchandise to the people right right oh it's true verse 17 these are wells without water see these preachers they claim to be Wells but they're not really not getting holy water they're getting unclean water right they're getting corrupted water they're getting sistern water yeah clouds that are carried with a tempest to whom the mid of darkness is reserved forever remember the Bible said the same thing in Jude 1:13 these are I think it was yeah it was Kora balum and Cain they've gone the way of Cain they've gone the way of Kora Kora spoke against the anointed Ministry of that day so watch these people that speak against brother R watch them right now we know if they speak against it they can still be saved if they repent like Saul was against David right but he repents at the end and so God can forgive people that are against brother Brandon as long as they repent of it yeah right right Verse 18 for when they speak great swelling words of vanity right like you see you know like some of these Mega preachers oh we're going to get breakthroughs we're going to go up levels you're get promotions they they talk it's all this Prosperity great swelling words but they never even get closer to God they can't even get the right water baptism they can't even get the right justification right they just lead him through a prayer you know say this 30 second prayer oh now you're born again now you're filled with the Holy Ghost welcome to the kingdom of God hey let us send us a text let us know you got saved we're going to we're going to share all our data with everybody just prove how many Souls were're saving they ain't saving nobody right that person don't L lay at the altar till they die die out to their sins I doubt they're even saved we've all seen we've all seen people say well I say a prayer I say a prayer and then they go back and they don't even serve God anymore we seen them Austin invited people come in here and they they love claim to serve God but then they leave out how can they do that because they never had a real conversion right great swelling words they Allure through the lust of the flesh through much uh wantonness I can never say wantonness I can never say that word those who were clean from them who live in ER see they continue to live in their heirs they never get to living in Holiness or living in correction right they live in air remember the preachers let them live in the lust of their flesh they let them they let them live in that in other words they're having communion with Devils yet going to church and yet the whole time brother and sister they say I'm communing with Jesus that's what they say the whole time look at verse 19 while they promis them Liberty right oh I'm so free I'm so free like recently a brother in the message shared one of these guys that left the message got a big podcast he comes out and says now one of my favorite uh musicians now is Guns and Roses they were a very a demonic group you know with Wicked rock and roll and see now now they have so much Liberty that they can let these uh musicians in there that worship and and and get their songs from demons they actually say I got my song from demons and now they got that Liberty they don't have Liberty they're they're they're more and I don't I don't say they came out of good churches they might have come out out of a adulterous Church like a tape worship church but they just they come out of that they just come in different kind of bondage right they just trade name they just trade names on the church building but they're still Bound by sin Hallelujah that's right God help us not to do that Hallelujah they themselves are the Servants of corruption this is the same people that say oh it's okay to celebrate Halloween and I'm going to show my children Dracula movies and all these things yeah same thing right Servants of corruption oh yeah same ones that said it's okay to live a nonbinary life and that's that's like one day I think I'm a man so I'll look for a man or a woman to marry or next day I think I'm a woman I I'll look for a man to or or vice versa I think I'm a woman I'll look for a man or man or woman vice versa I mix it up a little bit but they they say that's okay it's okay to tattoo parlors and all these things and they say they have liberty no they don't have Liberty real Liberty is only through obedience to the word of God amen amen they'll mock me they'll make fun of me they'll make fun of brother Brooks they'll make fun of all these people the Bible said Swift destruction that's what the Bible says hallelujah amen for of whom a man is overcome of the same as he brought into bondage so whatever evil spirit they commune with it brings them into bondage to that right in this case worldliness and I'm going to preach on that again like the the leev of Herod I'm going to preach on that again Lord willing see whatever they let themselves overcome if they entertain worldly Spirits they're going to be a slave to worldly Spirits right and you can put any evil spirit in there and they're a slave to that I'm going to show a few in just a moment just as a reminder for if they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ they're again entangled therein so this is the case of some of them some of them may might have come out of false message churches and they might have got free but then as they learn more they're never able to come to the knowledge of the truth as they go to a liberal Church they get tangled right back into a different kind of sin right maybe it was idolatry of brother Braham they come out of that and now they're free from that idolatry but then they go to church that's uh has other idols and now they're now their Idols are worldliness okay everybody see that by God's grace they came out of one but then they go to another and get Bound Again all all bound up all over again the Bible said uh they overcome the latter end is worse with them than the beginning for it been better for them not to known the way of righteousness than after they have known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them but it's happened unto them according to the true proverb the dog is turned to his own vomit again and the s that was washed her wallering in in the m so Peter gives inspired analogies people that go back to sin are like dogs and like pigs right but we're like eagles and Lambs hallelujah hallelujah praise God I know this ain't the maybe the most shouting message like this morning about Grace but I just want to bring this out so you can see these are the attributes of people that commune with demons yet they go to church yeah yet they claim to be prophets or claim to be enlightened they claim to have Liberty but they're actually communing with demons now remember brother Ram said brother said we're in a war right and we know brother R said when we pray when we spend time in prayer it's like setting up a Garrison against the enemy now Garrison is a military Outpost right yeah so you know let's say you live in Jerusalem or you you'll set a Garrison many miles from Jerusalem to protect Jerusalem so if you start to see an enemy come you got a little bit of protection and you got time to send back somebody to the city and say hey the enemy is coming right Hallelujah so a Garrison is like a protection you got an outpost right so friends you we got to remember we got to keep our prayer going so we're protected we know when the enemy's coming around that's right amen remember Jonathan 1st Samuel 13- 14 Jonathan overtook a Garrison it's a beautiful story and uh this were this was his words you know he he did it with an armor bear I forget how many men it might have been 20 or so he defeated he said come let us go over unto the Garrison of these uncircumcised it may be that the Lord will work for us I like that for there is no restraint to the Lord to save by many or few that's right in other words we're going to try to take some land and I believe God's with us it doesn't matter how many's against us as long as God's with us God can deliver us amen so this is an example of getting your prayer life back amen hallelujah amen this is an example of getting your walk with God back amen they'd lost some land but they can take it back as long as God's with them amen is that right church amen you can get like we're talking about getting our first love back we're talking about those type of things for those that need that right Hallelujah and don't be ashamed Church don't be ashamed let's be honest with God hallelujah this is communion with God hallelujah it's not communion with me or communion with somebody else is communion with God amen amen amen amen a Garrison is a military post or position and you know and so I just say it like this you know a Garrison is kind of like a stronghold right it's like a a a it's like a base it's like a military base remember friends we have weapons that are not carnal so it's it's not really your Bible that's going to get it it's you listening to the voice of the Bible right it's you obeying the spirit of the Bible you can I can buy a brand new Bible every year that's not going to give me Victory I got to believe what the Bible says amen hallelujah you got to do more than press play on the tape you got to be more than press play on the sermon on YouTube you actually have to obey what the sermon said hallelujah amen that's our real weapon hallelujah it's mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds yep so when you actually as I said earlier when you rebuke Satan and you you you resist Satan it actually works mightily amen and the church said am it shouldn't be that big of a fight if you got a mighty weapon and your enem is not as strong as your weapon you ought to be able to win pretty mightily praise God right you ought to be able to get the victory if you got a mighty weapon let's just do a simple example if someone's got a uh someone's got a water gun right we got the water guns out there if someone's got a water gun but you got an AR who's going to win that well you got a pretty Mighty weapon there that that's what God is trying to tell us we've got the name of Jesus there's power in the name of Jesus hallelujah it's mighty to pulling down of strongholds or even uh you know complexes is the word for it we have a mighty weapon to pull down complexes I heard a preacher say recently I was reminded that remember the angel Lord in one night I think it was in the days of Hezekiah in one night he slew 185,000 I think it was in Senate ch Arab's uh if I'm not mistaken s Arab's Army in one night 185,000 is anything too hard for God hallelujah our weapons are Mighty through the pulling down of strongholds Hallelujah we we got powerful weapons search the thing is we just don't use them like we ought to right how many want to use it this week by God's grace amen amen yes that should be our desire we have Mighty weapons we don't have like we don't have a water gun we got AR hallelujah it's not like we got a we got to wonder well can I win this battle or not of course you can win this you got the word hallelujah amen God's word you just have to do this you just have to have to cast down your thoughts right that's the first part of repentance remember what's the first part of repentance change your mind change your thinking right because if we've been thinking the wrong thoughts we got to think the thoughts we got to change our thoughts about that particular Temptation or trial yeah and every High thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ and having in Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled so see uh you want to take revenge as we said I preached that one time when em was here I think she really liked that she I shared that with her she appreciated that it's okay to have like a Revenge mentality I'm going to really overcome the devil this week I'm going to really obey the word of God and I'm going to take revenge upon the powers of Darkness amen amen that's okay you can have that's a acceptable attitude to have as a Christian amen amen I'm going to overcome my enemy and I'm going to defeat the enemy praise God I'm going to put Satan under my feet Hallelujah that's right the Bible tells us we have that authority to put Satan under our feet MH we just got to do it amen we just got to stop talking about it we just got to stop planning it and we just got to do it Hallelujah remember this prayer Church remember remember your your prayers also for this ministry your prayers for one another I'm talking about for your brothers and sisters in Christ also is a Garrison it sets up a Garrison around the church your prayers I was telling brother it was brother amen I was pray telling brother van I said we've been praying for brother mua almost every day we pray for brother mua at bible time because we haven't had any other big needs come up right so what are we doing we're trying to set up a Garrison a prayer to protect him yes because there you could you could go through a lot of uh bitterness you go through a lot of loneliness and when church when you're lonely you could do a lot of things you wish you wouldn't have done are you hearing me when you're in let me say despair when you're in despair depression you'll do some things you thought you might never do before so what are we doing when we're praying we're setting up a Garrison to protect our brothers and sisters that the enemy can't get to them am hallelujah amen he said and God as I go out yonder in the field to face the foe may I realize that I'm garrisoned every hour by prayer oh how I depend on that Garrison amen the enemy approaching but I know that the Garrison hold because mothers and fathers and boys and girls Christians born again with the experience heavenbound peoples on their knees praying oh God give deliverance and father we pray that you'll let us get out into the enemy's lines out yonder and Conquer every precious Soul that's waiting amen Oh Glory the church said amen hallelujah that's what we got to do we got to get on our knees sometimes and pray I I should say like this we should get on our knees very Faithfully keep up the Garrison over your life your family your house your church but also those you're praying for as well amen hallelujah and I thought remember I thought of brother Phil remember we had nine pages of of Victory nine pages of Deliverance Nine's a really good number nine fruits of the spirit nine gifts of the Spirit nine months and a new birth Hallelujah nine a really good number so the fact we got nine and remember we just didn't pray for him one time we've been praying for him multiple times I like that so what we're doing we're setting up a Garrison to protect our brother and church we didn't really realize what we're doing right we were praying all those prayers and we just we forget about it right we go Monday well we got to do Monday morning work got to do Tuesday Morning work we forget about all those garrisons thank God God doesn't forget hallelujah thank God he remembers our prayers he collects them hallelujah amen and then the Bible said when he answers them he pours them out Hallelujah glory amen so we got to set up some garrisons for our loved ones that's what we did this morning we had numerous people come up up for prayer for loved ones and so forth Hallelujah that's what we're doing we're setting up garrisons of protection amen Lord protect their lives you know I thought I even thought this and I've heard numerous people say this how many times have I prayed for president Trump and there were people that saying I've heard people just on the newscast they say the only reason he's alive is because God gave him Grace I believe that if a bullet got that close to me I wouldn't give credit to myself I'd give I credit to God see Church even our prayers can have garrisons on other people too right so we want to remember that by God's grace Hallelujah God's God's grace is what spares us hallelujah God's grace gives us another chance amen amen God remembers our prayers now friends don't forget you know um Israel had many enemies before before they crossed the promised land right but then don't forget they had many enemies once they came in the promised land right so what I'm saying is whether you're born again or not you can overcome the enemies and you have an enemy to defeat by God's grace that's right Hallelujah now brother uh William I preaches back in I think 2017 but in Joshua 310 I don't know if I ever shared that with you or not but the Lord just gave me some Grace one time to see it but all these Seven Nations that Joshua was overcome they have spiritual meanings right and uh here here's kind of what they here's kind of where I got their definitions Canaanite the word Canaan means a Trader or Merchant well traders to make money right so Canaanite spiritually represents overcoming the Love of Money yes right hittite the word hittite means a son of Heth and Heth means terror terror is fear so Joshua had to defeat the spirit of fear Joshua had to defeat the Love of Money Glory hivites uh now hi Hittites I had to get that from the uh the the DI the Bible dictionary if I'm not mistaken and it means villagers and so it dealt with worldliness so it means com so when I looked at the definition it was uh worldliness oh yeah and then they were also associated with the gibeonites and so remember uh Israel made league with gibeonites and so God was telling Joshua don't make Leagues with anybody don't make any compromises with anybody amen don't let sin into your life because it's going to come back and hurt you whenever sin you allow to live in your life it's going to hurt you and your family or hurt you and somebody else later on you've got to keep it out of your life amen Allelujah parazite again it means like villager oh yeah Farmers yeah the dictionary says Farmers so what's a farm Farm is earth right carnal Earthly carnal mindedness now I love this one girgashite means clay I just looked it up today and what did say iron and Clay iron Roman Catholic Church clay were the Protestants denominations that's right that's right and didn't didn't Peter battle denominational spear yes I'm not going to eat with the Gentiles very very good that that's an enemy you're going have to battle in this land that's right in this land Hallelujah you must defeat the gites amorites were the Giants so I just I just thought that was like a giant fleshly lus right they were there were giant Hills or mountains right giant mountains you have to overcome so I just called it giant fleshly lust there must have been a reason for that in the dictionary but the last one is jebusites remember the jebusites were the ones that were holding Jerusalem and David had to drive them out because Joshua couldn't Joshua's the tribe of Judah couldn't drive them out they were a stronghold amen they were a complex right brother R had to drive out complexes out of his own life complexes against the people why aren't they uh why aren't they listen what I said why uh I don't want to preach to them maybe I should move away maybe I should leave them in the field all these things see complexes he had to drive them out if he drove them out you can drive them out praise God he never left the field but he was tempted to leave the field Hallelujah you might never love money but you might be tempted to love money so you have to cast down that evil spirit hallelujah amen glory now here's how I Shar this with uh I think I shared this in the prayer line this morning talking about uh Samson just oh Lord just once more oh give over the whole enemy was destroyed so when Samson finally gave over everything he destroyed the enemy oh Hallelujah church we can just give all of our life all of our attention just give all of your thoughts all of your thinking when you can give that over to Jesus you'll get Victory praise God Amen just give everything over to Jesus Christ and you'll get the victory amen you'll destroy the enemy in your life Pentecostal stands at the post tonight can I say message churches stand at the post tonight things that you were born to destroy taking it over repent call loud Lord oh once more once more let us see it hallelujah amen and church let's remember that you were born to defeat Leia hallelujah amen you know internet just came popular what around 200000 or something like late 1990s it wasn't here before that means it's here so you can defeat it amen you were born amen you were born to defeated praise God Amen whatever is is whatever is moving people now to sin and it wasn't before it's here so you can defeat it praise God amen amen hallelujah all those Philistines were alive during s time so he could defeat them amen hallelujah whatever is here now you can defeat by God's grace amen you were born to do it and I love preaching I love like going out in Kentucky I love going out where places I've gone and I love seeing people realize they could get the victory over it this whole time you know they were struggling but once you realize you were you were born to defeat it then God makes you more than a conqueror in christes Jes I love to see him rise up and be real soldiers against it Hallelujah you don't have to be a slave to it you were born to defeat it praise God that's what you were born to do Joshua Glory that's what you were born to do Caleb Hallelujah brother said one place he's Joshua we're like Caleb amen that's what you were born to do Church Hallelujah let me say this my friend you better destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys you that's right Church do not play with sin you better kill sin before it kills you it will kill you if you don't kill it Hallelujah and we see people Bound by things and they leave church and then you never you don't see them again thankfully Sometimes they come back Hallelujah but it will liter that that evil spirit will spiritually kill their lives yeah because they let it do it they didn't realize this is a fight they forgot the Bible said they forgot they were even forgiven of their sins yeah right second Peter 1 says that if you don't if you don't keep adding strength you forget you're even forgiven then you don't even feel like you're saved you're so given over as a slave to sin because you forgot to add the anointing of God to your life Grant it Jesus that will keep adding Faith virtue knowledge uh Temperance patience God brotherly kindness and may God cap it off with Charity Hallelujah hey you better bring back the oldfashioned prayer meeting Hallelujah you better lay at the altar till you know you got the victory praise God oldfashioned repent when they stayed at to the altar till they was dead and finished with it I've seen both I told you this before I prayed with one man three hours at the altar one time and he got up and with one day he would I thought I I I I tried to cast out de demon out I tried to cast these demons out and I thought for sure he was uh delivered next day he went right back to it three hours that's a long time to pray with somebody at the altar and I was weeping and crying and rebuking evil spirits all things also knows what I'm talking about but he never died there he was just hoping or hoping to get the victory you got to pray until you know you've got the victory I know I'll never do that again I know I'll never go over there got too much love for Jesus I never want to hurt Jesus again Hallelujah you got to stay there and pray until you know your change Hallelujah that's right but you never seen a woman go to the Altar and die out to sin and next day come back with bob hair paint on her face there's no such that's a good sentence there's no such the Holy Spirit teaches nature does nature the holy Spirit you never seen women going out and dressing sexy coming and try to cover themselves up you never seen a man that was afraid to stand up and Afraid his little wife would leave him or something another because he took the initiative and tried to obey the word of God hallelujah you better destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys you I love that statement see because sometimes we forget how serious this battle is Right y right you better destroy the Temptation before it destroys your life remember we've seen so many preachers fall this year in the message and out of the message they they took a enemy for granted and destroyed their Ministries destroyed their lives destroys their families and now they're trying to pick up all the pieces in their family and Ministries amen and they'll forever be connected to that failure that's right because they let this sin grow they let this little amalaki grow up brother random says they let this little hivite grow up and become an adult hivite they let this sin take control of their lives you better kill it thank God we got a sharp Shore to take care of it hallelujah amen like I said you need somebody to be a friend I'll be a friend you need a an accountability partner I'll be your partner amen just be honest amen if you can be honest you can get Victory praise God and now just I thought I'd bring this up with evil spirits remember these are exact quotes brother said the spirit of unbelief is the chief of all Devils remember it's either Faith you're saved or unbelief you're lost L that's why that one's the chief demon it gets people to not even believe they can be saved or believe God can even have mercy on them and the Bible said you just got to look to the cross and you'll see the love of God Amen just look to the cross of Jesus Christ you find the love of God Amen brother said a religious demon is the worst demon to actually deal with those are the worst people to talk to are people that have evil spirits and they're religious Spirits in churches right you can't teach them anything about the Bible right right and they call you the devil yet they're the ones filled with the devil I get it all the time online brother said now here's one this this might battle us when we get distressed or nervousness brother B said that's the worst feeling anyone could have is is nervousness so we got to learn to cast down those feelings we have to learn to trust the word and overcome our feelings cast down our feelings I know it's hard but keep stay in the battle you'll get the victory keep fighting the battle amen and brother said fear accompanies doubt he said it's the greatest thing against the church is fear what's going to happen at the election what's going to happen uh to my family what's going to happen to this what's going to happen with my job what's going see and if we don't if we don't stop worried about that that spirit will overtake us it must be cast out it must be overcome Hallelujah now Paul says like this Paul does say that we can come into captivity we can come into uh a snare of the enemy MH right it's usually a mind battle right for us it's going to be a mind battle and this is uh and this this was kind of the main thought I had I never had seen you know 2 Corinthians 6 like this where it said you people have can have communion with Darkness people in the church can have communion with Darkness right I want to preach on First Corinthians remember all the things they had they were suing each other yeah mhm they were babies in the word they couldn't teach anybody nothing they weren't paying attention to Doctrine they're arguing about who who's the favorite preacher yeah they had a man sleeping with his stepmom they had people getting drunk before communion yeah and that was the book of Acts church right because they are a worldly immature Church Hallelujah so see they and then Paul wrote they were having they they were having this fellowship with Darkness so see we have to make sure we don't have fellowship with Darkness we entertain see church we entertain dark thoughts sometimes we got to cast those down yeah because Satan stood up against Israel this is what I thought of and provoked David to number Israel David wasn't purposely having fellowship with Satan but the Bible said he was allured by Satan he started entertaining the thoughts of Satan and church that happens to us too right it happens to us too we get allured because that's the word right there Paul said he Paul said I was brought into captivity to the law of sin which is in my body my members captivity means slavery right you're caught into captivity you get snared in a trap Hallelujah so what is I'm what I'm saying is that sometimes we accept the evil thoughts and we've got to get ourselves out of that trap we're LED away the Bible said we're LED Away by our own lust Hallelujah God doesn't tempt us with any evil he allows us to be tested we have to make sure we have communion with the holy spirit amen and not evil thoughts and evil spirits and I don't expect people to shout over this but I do expect us to be honest about it praise God we're talking about communion with the Holy Spirit intimacy with the Holy Spirit Lord I want the Holy Spirit Lord I want your spirit to rule my life I want to give everything over to the holy spirit so I can have communion with you Lord God Amen Hallelujah he saw this other law and it was a war and sometimes it would bring him into captivity and then he would do things that he hated instead of the things that were right right that's the key there we have to hate our sin we've got to hate it amen and then we can overcome it by the grace of God Amen we've got to hate any sin in our lives I'm almost done you've been a good been as always a good audience I got seven minutes left on my hour there by God's grace I thought it take me about an hour this here remember church I read this this week you have Fellowship that which we have seen and heard declare we onto you that ye may have fellowship with us so John saying we want you have fellowship with us but TR truly our fellowship is with the father and his son Jesus Christ amen so that's how it should be here if Austin and I all of us here I'm trying to use the brothers you know all the brothers amen and I and William and Nia if we all have Fellowship really our fellowship is with the father and the son and that's a fresh Revelation struck me brother William the wheel in the middle of the wheel what is it two wheels it's the the father inside the son I just thought I'd dropped it in there right God's grace it's a fresh Revelation I was just preaching at Kentucky I'm like yeah there it is I've always wondered what is the wheel within the wheel it's God in Christ the Bible said God is in Christ reconciling the world unto himself amen that's right that's what Ezekiel Saw a wheel within the wheel Hallelujah I never seen that till now Hallelujah this last week so that's our fellowship our fellowship is within the is is with the wheel within the wheel and these things we write unto you that your joy may be full see when you hopefully this will help you when you really have fellowship with God you're joyful about being a Christian and the church said amen see that if you lost your joy that means you're probably having fellowship with the wrong thing because the Bible says when you have fellowship with us and God in Christ your joy is full how many felt pry joyful after service this morning I was really joyful amen I'm like I'm going to go buy them some popsicles I'm sorry you weren't here I do apologize remind me I'll get you some next weekend uh um when we see when we have that special communion our joy should be full we should be just full of the joy of the Lord amen verse five this then is the message which we've heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all remember we shouldn't have fellowship with Darkness right if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and we do not the truth that's right okay so fellowship with God is doing the truth and if we're not doing the truth we're not having fellowship with God we're not able to hear God's voice everybody understand because you're talking you you're flirting with like Samson you're flirting with Delah you're flirting you're talking with her you're flirting with evil spirits rather than talking to God I tell you God wants to talk with you all day long how many believe that by God's grace but if we walk in the light as he's in the light see we have to leave the darkness leave that evil spirit behind leave that Temptation behind we got to walk back in the light as he's in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all everybody say all all sin all a l all sin you don't have to worry what about this in my past what about this in my past the Bible said all amen what about that bad week what about that bad month what about that bad year the Bible said all hallelujah amen remember God forgave 16 years of Israel not building that Temple God forgave them and the Bible said they prospered through the prophets and what they shout when they realized God forgave us of 16 years what they shout Grace Grace unto it amen that's Grace that's what Grace does it erases 16 years of failes it erases all your past it forgets all that and it brings you back into God's life Hallelujah heyen 16 years almost two decades amen MH of wasted time God can look past that and he just say I'm just giving you Grace you don't deserve it I'm giving you Grace anyway hallelujah thank God Amen if God and if God will do that in the blood of bulls and ghost surely he'll do in the New Testament amen like uh 52 years brother Glenn I'm gonna have to text him sometime I'm G have to get his number like 52 years of of walking in sin God will forgive in a moment's time then he'll give you joy unspeakable full of Glory am hallelujah praise God Amen he can say to the uttermost church hallelujah amen don't give up on God he surely won't give up on you I love that song I don't like the singer that song but I like that song some of you know what I'm talking about so here we go so what is our most intimate Fellowship it's back to our text so see I'm did like a circle I started here I started second Corinthians I left it and I'm coming back to Second Corinthians I did a little circle sermon here today that guys I'm closing with what I started with so here's the most intimate Fellowship what agreement have the temple of God with Idols for ye are the Temple of the Living God remember anything can be an idol right husband wife money car riches anything your phone that's going to probably be the most one of the most powerful Idols in our lives that's true for ye are the Temple of the Living God as God has said I will dwell in them and walk in them that's why brother said when Moses came down it's like God stepped in his sandals God said God said in Exodus 3 I come down to deliver the children of Israel said God just stepped in Moses's sandals Hallelujah because that's what the Bible says I will dwell with them I'll walk in them imagine brother Austin you walk into uh where's the story you might walk you walk into the wall or something like that and it's actually God walking in you like when you walked in a mustard seed sister it's God Walking In The Mustard Seed amen hallelujah wherever you go when God's leading you you have fellowship with God it's God walking in there to do something praise God I yeah Z and I W just walked in there to uh uh Target and there's a nice young black man there with his wife and he said they had a baby that's what I knows her and he said he said you're looking sharp I said well I was just just worshiping Jesus Christ that's right he's like of course and he just walked on so he knows people that dress up I'm not saying I'm sharp but people that dressed up they're they're supposed to worship God hallelujah you go to worship God you get down to business amen I was waiting for him to say something about Jesus but he didn't say anything so I was like okay I'll get these popsicles anyway Hallelujah but see what is it now he's going that that's a Divine appointment there Hallelujah and I was looking I was looking for coup too cuz I seen him at Target a few years ago I was looking for him too I'm looking for these Divine appointments it's God Walking In Me amen it's God walking in you hallelujah amen when you're communion with God you're full of that Joy now God's walking in you Hallelujah he's trying to speak to somebody's trying to bring the word to somebody hallelujah amen because I will be their God and they shall be my people hallelujah amen wherefore come out from among them and be separate that means stif that means holy sayeth the Lord and then here it is touch not don't even touch it I'll say it with the phone don't even tap it the church said amen right don't even give it a thought don't touch it God said touch not the unclean thing and I'll receive you I'll have fellowship with you and I'll be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters sayith the Lord Almighty amen so this is the most intimate there's my hour Glory Hallelujah this is the most intimate Fellowship we can have with Christ is when we get to the spot I'm not even going to touch that I'm not even going to look at it I'm not even going to think about it I'm going to let God Walk In Me Glory so God can be my God and that wherever I walk that's where God can walk amen amen amen hallelujah amen that's when I'm walking in the light that's when I'm having fellowship with Jesus Christ amen amen I'll say like this that's when I can whisper prayers and talk to God and he hears my every prayer amen whether he answers it in my time or not but that's when I'm having communion I can talk with him at Target I can talk with him wherever I go because I'm not touching the unclean thing I'm separated unto the work of God I'm joyful in the fellowship of Jesus Christ the church let's stand to our feet musicians can come communion with Christ or Devils we want communion with Christ amen will we battle Devils of course that's one of the main points David did right Paul said he was brought into captivity sometimes he was allured we're so easily beset but the T these these type of sermons are to remind us how God makes us the strongest when we have the most pure communion with him amen when we're totally sold out Samson I'm talking to myself too I'm Samson too when we're totally sold out sold out we don't even listen to one word of Delila that's true that's when we have the real fellowship and that's when we can get Victory and we can do let we say like this that's when we can do what God has called us to do we can do what we were born to to do amen yes born to defeat the Philistines that's right let's bow our heads here I'm going to stop the live stream God bless the live streamers may the Lord bless your communion with the Holy Spirit God bless you amen
