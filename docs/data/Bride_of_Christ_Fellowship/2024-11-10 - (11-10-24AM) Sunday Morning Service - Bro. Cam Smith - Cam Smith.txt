========================================

we've been here and uh we're glad that the Lord has afforded us this privilege I I do count it a a grand privilege to worship uh the Lord with you and uh we definitely are very eager uh always get eager when I come here I get excited and uh might be even a little bit excitable but uh anyway um you know I think the the spirit of God gives us Liberty to do those things doesn't it amen uh I'm very excited I feel like I could talk uh uh just even even a moment it looks like things are beginning to wrap up I'm so excited uh I I haven't uh brother Jesse is amazing with his schedule I'm not quite as well with that but uh I did see he was preaching on the coming of the Lord I haven't had much of a time to hear about that but uh I'm so glad that we are living very close to the coming of the Lord amen how many believe that uh you know the Holy Spirit should put that uh uh she put that hunger that that thirst in our hearts like tomorrow hey today could be the last day tomorrow could be last day you see a man is always trying to look for something Hallelujah but uh you know the Lord puts that by the holy spirit inside of us oh God I want to give you my best today amen hallelujah and uh what we we don't have the unrecognized presence of Christ before us we recognize that where two or more gathered there he is in the midst right amen so uh I could I could just uh say just great things uh about each one of you you're all very precious people I could say it was a great blessing bessing to have brother Jesse as my pastor for two years of my life I thought that was a grand thrill and um you know by God's grace I really can't say more about what the Lord produces in his life uh in the Saints here that are influenced by him as well as your influencing to him uh it really does bring forth uh a move of God Amen if we can just get aligned with God and his purpose right uh I might just sing one one song if that's okay uh uh sister Kaa that was a good song special sisters that very

reading of the word see some brothers and sisters I haven't met before God bless you good to see brother Jose brother Austin Selena I just go right down around just keep going keep going keep going uh but uh by God's grace uh we're happy to be here just going to preach a little thought this morning got a few things on my heart and uh you know we'll see what the Lord will do with this hopefully I'm going to use your your pastor's last song is the the confirmation I I always just stand there with about two or three sermons and I say Lord which way and uh I am hooked up if this can get started we are going to go to Hebrews 7 and after that we're going to go to uh First Timothy 2 okay let's see all right Hallelujah very simple sermon but uh if I can I'd just like to uh uh maybe awaken our senses uh to where we're at what we're living in and uh very I believe these these things uh actually this right here uh really changed uh my understanding uh of the message as far as uh how much more personal it really is to me and uh I think that's very uh important for all of us is actually to understand uh the Simplicity of what is going on with where we're at amen uh I I've preached a lot of things and and uh yet this right here just really sticks out to me uh it's working with the blood of Jesus Christ and uh very simple but yet uh like I said I'd like to maybe give you a little bible tour if we can go through this uh Hebrews 7:22 it says by so much was Jesus made assurity of a better Testament and they truly were many priests because they were not suffered uh to continue continue by reason of death uh but this man because he continueth ever uh hath an unchangeable priesthood Hallelujah wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them amen uh so if we knew that there's of course by the word of God here that he is able to save you to the uttermost yes you see God never made himself to be absent from the believer a Believer can make God absent but God wants to be ever present amen amen hallelujah we We Know by the Bible he's a peace that surpasses all understanding amen hallelujah that no matter what you're going through where you are or how bad it may seem God has a way he wants to reveal himself to you Hallelujah yes Hallelujah let's do one more 1 Timothy 2 verse5 so glad this does away with uh it does away with a pope it does away with the headship of a denomination that's right it honestly it does away with a message Pope yes sir Hallelujah right there's really only one mediator isn't there see I'm not your mediator your pastor ain't your mediator your brother or sister ain't your your spouse is not your mediator Jesus Christ is your mediator let us come unto him amen 1 Timothy 2 ver5 it says for there is one God and one mediator between God and Men uh the man Christ Jesus uh who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time amen uh so Christ he became a ransom for you amen uh he became uh in a way that he would what pay the price for every failure not that was just done 2,000 years ago but until intercession was done with amen Hallelujah aren't you glad about that amen because you see that means that his blood will supply for your needs of yesterday Hallelujah his blood will supply for your need today and his blood will what it will go until you are raptured you are secure in Christ amen hallelujah uh let us bow our heads for a word of prayer Our most precious Lord Jesus Christ uh humbly we come before you Lord thanking you for this ministry that you started here Lord uh knowing oh God that there's uh there's another little flak out there Lord that uh loves you with their whole heart they're they're doing their best oh God to uh come under the headship of the word of God lord so we're just glorifying you for that oh God the move that you're doing and uh Lord as we approach this topic here Lord uh we're asking oh God that you just give us inspiration oh God I uh if I'm using this song Oh God as the confirmation but Lord I can go anywhere you want me to Lord I I trust oh God God that uh the gift that you've placed in me oh God will be able to uh I'll be able to submit to that oh God and to do and say everything that you would have me to say oh God uh thou knowest oh God our hearts before you where we've come here looking for something oh God uh we've come here to Worship You Lord uh and Lord now we come for the hearing of the word oh God knowing uh even oh God as we seen Vindicated from brother brandom oh God uh many times he didn't even know what he was saying as he was preaching oh God but Lord he would just get so yielded to your spirit oh God that you could take him any direction even to any depth uh even Beyond his understanding Lord so we're just asking oh God that that same God would be in our midst oh God we welcome you here Lord and we're believing oh God that Lord through great Mercy oh God uh you've given us the ability to be here today every single one of us Lord so with that Lord we're asking that you'd bring Revelation uh and understanding oh God that we'd be able to move forward in you Lord so we just give you all the glory honor and praise in the name of Jesus Christ the church says together amen you may be seated we're going to work with this idea today uh the power of heavenly applied blood okay uh the power of heavenly applied blood and uh we'll try to uh just sew this in there real rich and deep um how many know I I'm so glad you know our Prophet came out and he was telling us things and uh one of the things that always stuck out to me he said he said the Holy Ghost is actually more real in this room than you and I are Hallelujah well how could you say such a thing because uh this is actually a temporal expression this is not the real right uh we we're living in a in a fin finite form uh a fallen form uh from what God actually called us to be right but God did these things for a purpose because it was actually the mind of God uh so that he would allow you to be in a fallen state so you could see a Victorious State uh through him amen uh it was God's desire to fill you with the Holy Ghost right it was God's desire to put his own life amen the very dunamis of God his very Life Zoey inside of you amen uh his purpose in doing these things was what it was to prepare a church to become in His image for a Rapture amen uh with all this uh uh things going on with the election and everything everyone's breathing a breath of of uh of of relief or sigh a lot of us might be right and it's really not about politics because either way you see it um the plan is moving forward amen uh one thing I I know about Revelations 13 when it came to the Beast out of the earth it was the United States's job to bring for for the image to the Beast amen hallelujah my brother just sent me something last night uh where president Trump he's already saying he said we've got away from religion it's time we get back to religion right uh it's pushing everything back to what now remember the religion the unification they're trying to do it does not have you part of it amen why because you have been called in this hour to unite with the Living Word himself amen you've been called to what you go out and meet him Hallelujah you cry out you believe it amen you are don't wait to get oil then you pray up now amen and watch seek the Lord until he will be found of you amen hallelujah hallelujah so this morning I want to bring it this way because I want you to understand that there was a time where this wasn't a reality uh we're working with the power of the Heavenly blood applyed and uh I'm going to start in the Old Testament and begin just to build a foundation going a direction hopefully uh God will help us here cuz uh when this opened up to my mind I was like oh hallelujah hallelujah uh Exodus 25 verse 8 uh there was remember in the Old Testament uh the Tabernacle was given it was given as a pattern right uh in Exodus 258 it say let them make me a sanctuary uh that I may dwell among them it was God's desire to dwell among man amen hallelujah now remember here it is in a law form he wants to dwell with them Hallelujah they're a fallen States right they they're wanting to move away in Exodus 19 it was the worst mistake the church made right they wanted law over Grace but notice God is still so full of grace that he Prov finds a way he can dwell with them amen and no matter how far you might feel from God even at this moment amen look up for your Redemption dwth nigh amen reach out because the scripture cannot come back void to God he's in this room he wants to feel you he wants you to see his reality he wants you to enter into what his presence amen hallelujah his presence will always bring a move of God Amen Hallelujah brother brandom said God brings his presence to do things I'm paraphrasing that but he said according to all that I sh thee after the pattern of the Tabernacle and and the pattern of all the instruments thereof even so shall ye make it God had a design in his mind that he wanted them to build this Tabernacle now remember these are all types and look at our Prophet said in 62 he said now we find that these great Cedars were heed down by huers and they were uh they had the blueprints and they brought them together from different parts of the world now if you notice Solomon never varied one bit from the pattern that Moses saw on Mount Si in heaven Hallelujah Solomon never now think about that if God can do that just from not deviating from the pattern what if you get in one place and one Accord Hallelujah then you will fit the pattern of the word and it will produce the same thing it did then amen no different don't expect anything different Amen brother sister when we baptize in the name of Jesus Christ you should have the ultimate uh uh expectation I will be filled with the Holy Ghost right now amen hallelujah remember it is our responsibility to show that God's word can't lie if God if you follow the acts 238 prescription you have to be filled with the Holy Ghost if you believe that if you hold that and it's God's will that we would be able to move right into it now think about how evil are societ and the challenges that this has brought because what it does if the individuals do not move into the fullness of the Holy Spirit the same Bible Holy Spirit it can do nothing but cause divisions yes because self will always what it will always rule above the will of God that's right that's what these seals did for us brother sister it showed us a white horse a red horse a black horse a Pale Horse and it was always man getting moved on by the wrong anointing but you see remember Satan's Creed is not uh do what God says or listen to what Satan says Satan's even the people that wrote the Satanic Bible their motto is do as thou Wilt amen they want you to do what you want to do but the Bride of Jesus Christ says I want to do what you want me to do I want to I want you to be so happy with me amen because I love to do thy will amen hallelujah hallelujah it's all sticking to the pattern he says of course here he is he said that what he said he didn't vary from the pattern that he saw in heaven couldn't do it I wonder what heaven looks like we'll get to it in a minute Moses when he returned from his vision pitched the tent and made it just exactly like he saw in heaven they're all what fulfilling a pattern that they seen in heaven and when Solomon built the temple he made it just exactly the way he seen the pattern the type Moses pitched a tent for a Perpetual type because it moved from place to place now remember what does that mean remember you have son of man Son of God and Son of David right son of man was what now remember when Moses went to Mount Si it was a Emon situation from conception that God gave him in Mount Si to the actual building of the Tabernacle the same cycle of birth right and then it what it birth forth a tabernacle which was something that could be moved to and fro amen but that was not God's ultimate uh uh uh ending point for uh the worship of his dwelling with man amen he would move it from that that moving uh uh Tabernacle to actually a what a temple a stationary place of worship amen that was so powerful that Solomon could even stand right there and said whoever looks to this place amen hallelujah then what if they're in pestilence they'll get healed if they want if they're if they're full of drought God will bring rain amenallah Hallelujah if you look to that Son of God ministration he'll Heal Your Land amen hallelujah what is that it's the filling of the Holy Ghost In You Hallelujah let's continue but Solomon he made the Tabernacle just exactly in the fashion that Moses seen it in heaven it was all put together set in order just exactly what a spiritual application we could apply here that we are never to leave the scripture what's a message believer a believer that doesn't leave the scripture hallelujah hallelujah I don't care if people come up that polygamy is all right it ain't in the word amen they're misinterpreting the word amen yes sir yes sir so he says what that's the reason I believe that the way the first church was patterned that's the way the next one ch should be patterned that's the way everyone should be patterned just the way it was at the beginning and I believe that God has it that way I believe the real church amen so if we want to know exactly what we need to be like it's right here yes is that right hallelujah hallelujah now how hard is it to actually make that live well that's why the message in itself has birthed out in so many different ways why because you see no longer oh God sent a prophet I'm all right the purpose of the Prophet was to bring the church back to the Bible amen hallelujah but you see there's also his Humanity that what is in the tape so you have to take it back to the word right hallelujah hallelujah now not that I have to be brother Brand's corrector or anything like that but you know what if it's something that uh that I I question or something why do you say I should be able to find it here that's right but you know what I found a lot of times it's right in there the whole time Hallelujah now notice they're following this pattern that was set up in heaven right 1 Chronicles 289 he said and thou uh Solomon my son know thou that the god of thy father and serve him with a perfect heart and a willing mind for the Lord searcheth all hearts and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts if thou seek Him He will be found of thee amen hallelujah GL Hallelujah if you seek the Lord will he be found of thee Hallelujah if you seek him like Solomon did CU God is not a respector of persons amen hallu he wants you to have a willing mind and a perfect heart right so he says if thou seek Him He will be found of thee but if thou forsake Him He will be cast he will cast thee off forever take heed now for for the Lord had chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary be strong and do it if you're going to build this house here amen that God called you to dwell into into a place that God's going to be it's going to take some effort amen it's going to take some dying out amen it's going to take some unifying that goes beyond your thoughts amen hallelujah hallelujah because you know what it doesn't matter even as a pastor you know where my issues always come people don't believe the word like I believe it I can try to prove it I can try to but everyone's got their own different idea but what does that really speak to the need of well it speaks to the need that I'm right and you're wrong that doesn't speak for that does it speak that that that uh does it speak that sister zes right and sister Lena is wrong no when it actually speaks if you actually will study your message out it speaks that we should unite in our love for God praying that the Holy Ghost will fill us you ever wonder how how how 1 Corinthians 1:10 came about I'm just preaching I hope it's all right uh but 1 Corinthians 1:10 they had the same mind the same judgment Hallelujah they had everything the same right they believe the same how in the world could that ever happen only by one way amen and that is everyone coming into the perfect yielding to the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah Glory maybe we'll get to it later but you see it's got to come brother Jess us my sermon on Wednesday I'm burning with it I might even preach tonight I don't know but I am burning because you know what some local body somewhere has to come to in Acts to amen yes sir yes sir that is the thing that the devil fights the most he don't want you to be United he doesn't want you to like each other he doesn't want well why because if it gets in one place in one Accord he's got trouble again amen he don't mind if you unite that you like to fish he don't mind if you you unite because you like the church age book or you don't like it but what he does not want you to do is to unite and say God I am yours I Surrender everything amen hallelujah Glory and then put our Doctrine on the same spot and say Lord I'm going to put a comma right here hallelujah it's easier for us L to sins you're wrong you're wrong you're wrong still right that's a lie of the devil yes sir because if you're not careful you'll get pulled into the Labyrinth hallelujah how many know commenius he talked about in the church age book brother brother brand they brought it out about cenus working with the Labyrinth and I had to step back I had to step back myself because I'm wanting to Hallelujah I feel like God's revealed in the son but I found out you know what there's only one thing that's going to unite us Jesus Christ why is that important because brother brandham said he said the church will get United and then the going away amen amen the bride has to come to Unity how are we going to do that we need the Lord I hope this sermon will help with this Hallelujah if I ever get to it Hallelujah he said then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch and of the houses thereof and of the treasuries thereof and of the upper chambers thereof and of the inner parlers thereof and of the place of the mercy seat and the pattern of all that he had by the spirit David only gave him the pattern that was by the spirit Hallelujah he didn't give give him his own thoughts well I kind of like I kind of like roses over here or I like he did not do that but he gave what he was so in tune with the spirit that he gave Solomon the one who would build the temple exactly what he seen and he knew it was God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah also for the courses of the priests and the Levites for all the work of the service of the house of the Lord and for the vessels of service in the house of the Lord all right amen you see we not only have a Bible that shows us everything how it happened so we could learn from it we could catch a revelation of it but we have a Holy Spirit who has called us to overcome the division that we see in the message even now for the elect don't get it wrong just CU you're in the message does not mean you're going to make a Rapture I'm hearing everybody say it now and it's true Hallelujah I've been saying it for a while myself hallelujah what is so close it would deceive the elected if possible right yes sir you don't got to worry about the Presbyterian you don't got to worry about the Episcopalian even the Baptist and what we love everybody everywhere Hallelujah but it's really come time that there's one thing we've got to really agree on and is how to get everyone filled with the Holy Spirit yes Hallelujah just saying what's coming there we see brother and sister you got your Tabernacle of course the tent or the the badger skin everything could be taken down move Solomon's Temple Grandeur and if you actually study the types out you will find that what that the T the temple was actually twice as big as the Tabernacle it was literally a double portion from what the Tabernacle was Hallelujah meaning what that the Son of God ministration by the Holy Spirit it would be God's desire to give those anointed ones a double portion of his spirit amen hallelujah don't belittle what God wants you to be don't belittle what what don't belittle what the scripture says you are amen you are a messiah at you are an amateur God Amen what separates us from that a revelation yes because we don't believe that well why cuz your phone's telling you you're not your phone's trying to keep you tied on to the Earth your fellowships your job everything is trying to tell you that you're not perfectly in tune with God to do this right but the word says you are amen hallelujah well if we only had the blood Glory let's go a little bit farther how many like uh talk about the tribulation those are some of the things that got me really excited it's a lot happier to talk about if you're not going to be here I would say anybody agree with that Hallelujah uh we're in anxious times because the these are the times it looks like it's getting ready to birth Now isn't it amen uh notice uh I probably jump here uh in a moment here but he said Revelations 11:15 which is talking about the Jews right and the temple and everything like that it said and the seventh angel sounded and there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ and he shall reign Forever and Ever After these two prophets roll out Hallelujah the seventh angel sounds amen we work with the Bible version with brother Jesse There showing that all those new versions tell you that that uh seventh angel here is the same one that you see in Revelations 10:7 but that is not true amen God sent us Revelation that what as he had declared to his servants the prophets amen not some Heavenly Angel this is what the Earthly seventh angel brother brandom amen that's right Hallelujah now watch so things are now coming to a close uh let's just this is good enough tell you what for the tribulation this is all I really need to know and the nations were angry I bet they they were they got hard times coming right Mercy's over and the temple 19th verse of God was opened in heaven and there was seen in his Temple the Ark of his Testament Ron Wyatt found it though brother sister or it's here or it's there it's in Ethiopia it's there right now in a real form there's actually a temple of God in heaven and there is an arc of his Testament right there what is that actually showing it's showing that it followed the pattern that God showed him here now watch he says and there were Lightnings voices thunderings and earthquake and great hail judgment the the seven trumpet it's over that tribulation is over yes as our Prophet talked about he said that Sanctuary will become smoky it's over again Revelations 155 and after that I looked and behold talking about the seven vials the Temple of the Tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened and the Seven Angels came out of the temple having the seven plagues uh clothed in pure and white linen and having their breast girded with giren girdles and one of the four beasts gave un the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God who liveth forever and ever amen how many know have you studied your message brother Brandon was longing to preach on these things that's right didn't get there did he and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power and no man was able to enter into the temple till the seven plagues of the seven Angels were fulfilled the tribulation Grace over now I find this very interesting because it says and no man was able to enter into the temple well what man's up there going in the temple I'll leave that one for your pastor Hallelujah I've heard you children ask questions stay away from me I'm just joking so notice there's a Time coming where the temple in heaven is going to go from a mercy seat to a judgment seat Hallelujah Hebrews 9:22 and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood there is no remission it takes shedding of blood to remit or do away with sin amen hallelujah it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these did you did you catch that it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in heaven should be purified with these yes heaven itself would need the purification of blood yes not making stuff up I'm reading you the Bible Hallelujah so it says it was uh but the Heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these for Christ has not entered yes yes for Christ has not entered into the holy H places made with hands I'm saying where did Christ go when he ascended Hallelujah where's he at now that's why I'm so glad that we have a God that can be as omnipresent as he wants to be Hallelujah I'm so glad I got a God who who can want he can he can worry about uh akan Ohio the same time he's worrying about Nigeria IA he can worry about Nigeria let me say he's not worrying because he already knows what's going to happen right but what he can think on those needs that they have the same time he's thinking about the needs in China amen down in Mexico Guyana wherever he is he is an omnipotent omniscient God Amen Hallelujah he ever lives to make intercession Hallelujah this is where it has to be a person no Revelation it has to be cuz if God is not thinking about you or doesn't have time for you you're literally in the same spot Israel was when a uh Elijah said why H between between two opinions if he's god let's serve him you would have a same God as baale right because when they were trying to get baale to move on their behalf to drop the fire on the sacrifice Bale could not interceed for their needs Hallelujah there is a God who could answer by setting the sacrifice on fire amenallah don't you he is just a type of the pouring out of the Holy Ghost on the church amen hallelujah hallelujah but Elijah had to mock them where is your god is he on vacation uh is he is he sick where is this God you have now how come Elijah could do that to them but they couldn't do it to Elijah and what type of believer should we be right now amen notice Elisha was actually trying to set the church in order he was trying to bring them under the right type of sacrifice Hallelujah and what did God answer by fire yes he did amen no wonder the prophet said he said what he said if if if you are a sacrifice and and the sacrifice is made perfect God was what he'll pour out the fire on you Hallelujah he brings it down you're just like that sacrifice yes why isn't God setting it on fire he just don't care about me woe is me I've been praying for this for a long time if God be with us where are all the Miracles we separate ourselves yes sir yes sir it they had to leave Jehovah to go to Baal that's right brother good and you know why because they were more interested in numbers and popularity than the true Elijah message of the hour if you hear what I'm saying yes sir they were more interested in programs where they could have a form of God right right they could copy off of denominations why am I going this [Music] way but you see even when you find yourself under the truth of that moving you still have to live it out amen no wonder the scriptures got all these things remember them lepers them lepers were full of sin they had the Assyrian army ready to go get them and the scripture remember there they were starving to death there's an Elisha in the land but they were starving to death and they said why sit we here it's better to chance Dying With the Enemy and they went out to a defeated Foe and found all that they needed all their hearts content because they were the first ones that got away from being scared of the enemy and just got in and started fighting for God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah they weren't worried about it anymore they got tired of not getting fed amen they got tired of sitting under the word hungry you don't sit under the word hungry amen you are the one anointed of God to bring that Holy Ghost down amen you are called for it you are that name that was on that book it was your your name amen God Hallelujah for Christ has not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true God didn't need hands to build the temple in heaven but it still needed blood but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for himself somebody caught me good good you supposed to catch me no brother no brother that's a lot of issues with people in the message nowadays they don't they don't challenge nothing they get heard right they're preaching this message is the absolute preachers are up there saying don't even search it out said we got it covered just listen to what we say huh that's a message Pope right there when he's trying to separate you from the word of God from the message of the hour that's a pope because it's the same thing Catholicism did yes sir they what their first big idea was to what not what they first tried to kill the elect but then they had a better plan that they would take the Bible away from the common people how' they do that destroyed as many bibles as possible and what put the Bible in Jerome's Latin Vulgate cuz Latin was a dead language so no body understood it think about it it's always Satan's strategy to separate the Ley from the word brother good if he can separate you from the word he's broke the power Amen to deliver you to set you free to what to live in the power of this moment right now it might be dark outside but there's lights in this room amen hallelujah there's what there's an anointing that's more real than anything in this room amen tap into it how do I tap into it give yourself to it don't wait on it you move by faith I'm sure your pastors preached on it how many times brother Brandon was sitting there and say say brother you have this type and this type of issue he says hurry up make a move believe it then then you'd hear a little pause you say it's shame on you you missed it that individual had to go the rest of his life missing a healing though God himself settled on him because the prophet seen the light and he seen it move well thank god brother cam there's no light in this room like that right now that's not true correct the preacher again right brother yes sir Hallelujah brother sister I I seen the I seen the pillar of fire in our church we had a visiting preacher from Ghana and he was up there just preaching a token getting with us like 10 years ago anyway he's preaching it getting it and I'm I'm standing over here I'm like amen doing my thing and I look and I'm like there's a pillar of fire over his left shoulder and I so I'm like I know I'm seeing something so I'm like go like this I start moving around like yeah that's a pillar of fire I'm like Hallelujah but then when I went like this I was looking at the preacher and all of a sudden I noticed it wasn't on the preacher it was on brother Dave Lewellen on his right shoulder I thought it was on the preacher because of where I was standing but when I moved I found out because obviously you had the preacher here and brother Dave was right here but when I moved I realized it was on brother Dave and not on the preacher how is that possible that the pillar of fire could be on someone outside of a Preacher but it it is made that way the same light that was on those individuals and brother brandom's meetings is the same light that will be on you if you can only come to a conscious state that he is here amen hallelujah why did he not continue his work on Earth because he had to go to heaven why now to appear in the presence of God for us thank you Lord for you thank you Lord so when he showed up did that end it was he done then think about it in Revelations 12 there's a time when it says the accuser of the Brethren is cast out who's that the devil the devil actually comes to a spot he's cast out but why is he up there he is the accuser of the Brethren are you a brother he's accusing you you glad about that if you know that you're pretty glad about that right hallelujah hallelujah cuz you've got somebody remember you have someone standing in the gap for you you have a mediator that is sitting in heaven right now for you amen hallelujah hallelujah nor yet that he should offer himself often as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with the blood of others for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself sin he put it away you realize when you commit a sin after service he doesn't have to die for it again it was once and for all I think after 2,000 years he's got this down I think he's got it figured out what figured out how to guard you at the throne amen from All Saints attacks I always say this you hear me say it again but you know what a lot of times everybody wants to say their job but you realize probably 99% of the time you ain't job you just sin too much yes sir you're just too complacent yes sir you're too involved yes sir with the Affairs of this life and God is trying to get you right he has a plan for you he has an anointing for you think about it there's nine spiritual gifts that are supposed to operate right in here nine that those aren't brother Jesse's nine gifts amen nine gifts that God made to get filled with the Holy Ghost and then he would be able to watch give these gifts unto men it's God's grace that he doesn't give the gifts to us when our character is not right cuz power without character is satanic think about it there even John was without the character of God and when Jesus was to go into that City they didn't want him and John says give us the ility I'll call fire on he from Heaven on them what was that even in a Sanctified State he did not have the character to wield the power of God we cannot be satisfied with a Sanctified life Hallelujah we've got to move into the full mind of Christ amen hallelujah hallelujah let's see what he said he cares do you care Hallelujah when he was here on Earth as I say he cared for the people so much till he healed their sick comforted their hearts told them about a place that where he would go and prepare for them and would come again to receive them un himself he cared for them and notice he cared so much until when he knowed he must leave in order to bring this great thing to us he said I'll not leave you comfortless but I will send the Holy Spirit and he he shall continue my care for you until he returns there's no one that cares like Jesus hallu who cares the most for you in your life yes I don't mean to say it but I'm going to say it if your first thought about someone caring for you is someone physical then you're already in the wrong spot yes sir yes sir what is that showing that's showing a disconnect in your relationship with God yes sir yes that's serious it's very serious because you know what when I'm preaching this you might say yes amen yes amen but what about those last decisions you made yes sir Hallelujah I'm a pastor I find when people need money they don't go to God first they go to God first first they make the preacher their answer they make the preacher their God the one that's going to provide for him the one that's going to do everything they need him to do it wasn't meant to be like that it was meant to be you in an Eden State sitting there with Papa God Amen the blood was actually shed to bring you back to the Eden Fellowship brother sister you know that quote I've said it before watch this knowing that his body as a high priest in IMM mediatorial work that he's doing now that body must be in the presence of God at all times for intercession that God cannot see the sinner's sin he sees only the blood of his own son why is he there why is he in heaven right now because every time you fail he is standing in heaven in the gap for you Hallelujah I don't even know if I'll get to this quote but you know what brother brandham said he said if God is not at the mercy seat right now he said God cannot hear your prayer right Hallelujah so that means if he is there if you believe he's there then that means he'll hear your prayer and knowing that he sent back the Holy Spirit to continue to comfort his people does he care certainly he cares now he was to continue to care for his people for the people his people here on Earth in the same manner that he cared for them when he was here did you get that yes can God alter his care for you right now differently than what his care was for you when he was here on Earth he can't right so you can literally look into the Bible and where it talks about Jesus and it said he had compassion on them he healed them all he cannot care for you any less than what he did for them there don't you see brother Brandon was not crazy when he said if our faith could get to this this spot right here there wouldn't be a sick person here in five minutes but what is it it's a revelation hold on with me because you have to realize that this blood is shed for each one of you this blood is still the same for you think about this if you could catch that Revelation then what about the pouring out of the Holy Ghost right now I got a powerful quote it's coming Hallelujah acts 1:6 it says and when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying Lord wilt thou at this time restore again the Kingdom of Israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father ha put in his power but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you when was the power coming after the holy Holy Ghost had come upon them Hallelujah and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem in all Judea Samaria and under the uttermost part of the earth and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight they wanted the restoration right there but he had had something better for them at that time but notice where did he go he went back to heaven and while they looked steadfastly towards heaven as he went up behold the two men stood by them in white apparel which also said ye men of Galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven this same Jesus uh which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come and like man as you have seen him go into the heaven into heaven what notice what they're doing God told them to go wait in Jerusalem go Terry yes but what were they more interested at doing they were more interested in watching a God go away from them right than to actually do what the word told them to do yes sir you realize the same thing happened when brother Brandon was taken off the scene it's the same thing when Elijah was raptured it's the same thing every time that people become more fixated on the man of God right than the actual word that they're supposed to carry out think about it that's right that type they should have been more trained on what Elisha was doing now notice Elisha had that he had the manle come come on him he wasn't fooled did did Elisha go out and and and go search in the wilderness for 3 days with all the sons of the prophets he wasn't worried about that why cuz he had The Mantel and he went to the Jordan and smoted it and said where is the god of Elijah where's the god of Elijah brother sister yes Hallelujah where's he at I'm telling you he's waiting I had the brother preach just a few weeks ago and he said he says we're not waiting on God God's waiting on us and that's the fact God is waiting on us to get away from everything and get fully into him hallelujah it's one of my favorite quotes I hope it's one of your favorites too after I read it patas Vision he said the lamp was lit in a special way first the priest took fire from the sacred altar which was originally lighted by the fire of God he lit first of all the lamp that was sitting on top of the bowl uh he then lit the second lamp from the flame of the first lamp the third lamp received its fire from the second lamp as did the fourth receive it from the third and so on until all seven lamps were burning this Holy Fire from the altar being passed from lamp to lamp is a wonderful type of the holy spirit in the seven Church ages the original outpouring of Pentecost I'm so glad these parentheses are here hallelujah which outpouring came direct from Jesus on The Mercy Seat where did that outpouring in Acts two come from Jesus where was he at the mercy SE where in heaven yes so when the Holy Ghost fell on them what actually was that going on Jesus applied the blood to the Mercy Seat in heaven and what did that produce It produced an outpouring wait a minute if the blood of The Mercy Seat could produce an outpouring then if we have a revelation of where the blood is who is applying that blood and his intention for the blood then it can place us into a spot that Jesus can do wonderful things from The Mercy Seat in heaven hall now if you believe he's left that Mercy Seat you got problems yes sir but if you can see that there's a God that is still making intercession for you it makes no wonder Jesus said all things are possible think about it right now in akan Ohio the dimension of Heaven is around us moving faster you can't see it you can't feel it but it's there but also in that seventh Dimension is the mercy SE in the temple in heaven Hallelujah and he's wanting to know your request by the Revelation that you have remember don't get tired of me now hold on because if you can see he cares about you right now if you can see when that act church was just a big bunch of cowards they weren't winning a lot of souls they weren't catching a lot of seed was seed there seed was there no wonder this pouring out from The Mercy Seat caused a Revival to bring 3,000 in hallelujah what was it they fulfilled the word of God and when it struck they had it Hallelujah so by the scripture they would have to wait till the day of Pentecost 50 days what about you sister beatric how long you got to wait s Carris how long you got to wait no wonder he said it's not for you to know the times and Seasons no wonder what what are you trying to say brother C I ain't trying to hold you long I'm trying to get you this thought because if you can understand how real God wants to be in your life right now not just that he wants to be real but he's actually there wanting to be real with a blood that God cannot even impute iniquity upon you Hallelujah meaning what that you are in the very righteousness of God in him Hallelujah so what is it is end doing his church through all the seven Church ages and showing perfectly that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever the never changing God in his Essence and his ways he's at the mercy seat in heaven that's really close to us right now we can't see it we're a little slow no wonder so tell me when brother talked about Heavenly places what did he talk about when he talked about you getting in that Heavenly place he said time could just pass he said you just got in Heavenly places time was gone yes what were you actually entering into it made that long-winded preacher seem like it was just a minute but why was that because you were more into the word and what the word was trying to direct you yes connect you with then actually the element of time that's telling you you're hungry that's telling you you're tired that's telling you oh God let him stop not in this room of course that's other places but but what is it we even when we come to the house of God remember brother Brown said we have to make it count especially when we come to the house of God why is that because now by the foolishness of preaching the holy spirit is a mouthpiece speaking his promises unto you don't you see this this is redemption the product of redemption that is sitting in your midst meaning what he cannot change his essence or his ways if he poured out on them if you got in that same spot by what by faith he will pour out on you Hallelujah see a lot of times a lot of times we're looking for power we're looking for Supernatural but you know what God wants to give you probably more than anything else he wants to to give you the benefit of having the holy spirit in you the same way he gave it in the Bible I preached a sermon a while ago that we don't need brother man said he don't want to give you a different Holy Ghost right he don't want to give you a different Holy Ghost that's got power every now and then 64 question answers brother Bram said he said if you were in harmony he said the signs and wonders would be multiplying around you constantly if Jesus was only here you see how Jesus made it though he made it so the only way you can tap in it's by faith you have to believe it you have to believe right now he has you on his mind you have to believe it that that need that he's placed in your life whether it's physical or spiritual right now you can have that don't you see that's why he revealed uh acts 10 with Peter and the Gentiles while the word was preached the Holy Ghost fell on them amen all those Gentiles would have to do is hear the word and the Holy Ghost would fall on them wait they didn't have to go 50 days all they had to do is hear the word I'm not worthy of you coming to my roof just say the word and it'll happen they had a revelation of who they were they had a revelation of their Authority it was God that chose you to be in this room it was God that chose you to be in this church amen it was God that is what perfecting you here but what his design is to manifest himself greater in your midst Hallelujah that's what he did now notice when he come to the scene in Revelations 5 there it was calls him a lion but when he came out what did they see a lamb he stood as it had been slain one of the most interesting things you could probably ever do is get on Google and look at all the pictures people have for this they got little sheep with with seven eyes and seven horns they anything you can think of it's hard to find it right actually I never found it right but there it was that slain lamb what still in a spot of intercession still intercessing for your needs Hallelujah did you hear that your needs brother Austin's needs our sister here your needs sister Naomi needes right now he cares for whatever is on your heart and the devil's right there to stand and say yeah but you've never got it before oh you've tried that a lot of times oh Hallelujah I got to come to a close watch he says remember the old in the Old Testament as long as the blood was off The Mercy Seat it was judgment but as long as the blood was on there there was Mercy but when the lamb walked away that did it he was the only man that was worthy here he come from the intercessory box what's he coming for now watch him John was weeping where's it all at what's going to happen he said don't weep John said the Elder here comes the lion he was the one prevailing Ked and when he looked here come a lamb bloody that had been slain anything that's killed is bloody you know been killed its neck's been chopped or something open or something the blood's all over it here come a lamb been slain and he came forth oh my what to make claims on his Redemption amen he said oh I don't you just feel like just going over in a corner and sit down and cry a while you realize he can't do that until you're done till he's done with you right have you come to the Revelation he can't leave intercession until he's got me done CU I'm his I'm his bride I'm his child I'm a son I'm a daughter I'm a Child of God Amen Hallelujah he I want you have recognized that he is the author of your faith who started your faith if he started your faith he was also made to be the finisher of your faith Hallelujah that's the that's a danger in arminianism it wasn't well we kind of did it together or I I love him first we had nothing to do with it he first loved us he was the one that loved you even when you were in denomination or wherever you were and brought you to the message of the hour he didn't bring you in this message to not make a Rapture he brought you into this message to catch a revelation of the blood to catch a revelation of who you are and to manifest his mind to this world Amen Hallelujah you have the rights of redemption right now his rights are taking you but your rides is everything he purchased through the blood a right mind you want it you got it you want Deliverance he's right there with a blood that can take it away from you if you only lay it down oh I need more help with my will oh that's right his blood will take care of that too I've tried 10 times his blood will take care of that too hallelujah look at the quotes brother Bram said he said it don't matter if you've tried six times to get the Holy Ghost he says today is a different day I don't know about you I don't want a different Holy Ghost I want the holy ghost that this talks about I want a holy ghost that's making Satan get worried amen theology is not making the devil get worried brother sister right lukewarmness is not going to make him worry that's right but when you can get to the spot where you can identify that what you're packing can be a lot more potent than what it is I ain't telling nobody ain't got the Holy Ghost but what I'm saying is God has a real Holy Ghost and it will look exactly like this no wonder he said brother brandom said he said if this Vine ever gives birth to another branch it'll be the same as the first right so what kind of birthing are we looking for oh well it's got to be 50 days it doesn't say that he said you pray for the Dynamics he said the Dy Dynamics is nothing but a refilling of the Holy Ghost while The Headstone is coming down he said we've worked in a small measure while The Headstone is coming down Hallelujah almost let's see in the breach again he said he said John hadn't noticed this land before you know here he hadn't been mentioned before nowhere had it been mentioned joh didn't John didn't see it all over the heavens as he's looking but here come forth notice where it came forth where did it come from it come from the father's Throne where he had been seated since he had been slain and raised again he raised up and sat on the right hand of God ever living to make intercessions amen raised there today as an intercessor with his own blood to make intercession upon the ignorance of the people sir anybody got some ignorance oh his blood took care of that don't you see Hallelujah that's why I'm hitting Unity with this because we are all a word work in God we all have different issues some have issues with pride some have issues with being too fearful others others will have uh uh issues with narcissism another will have issues with uh with with being uh so isolated that they that they're they're suicidal right but we still have the same God that can do away with all of it don't you understand God made you not to not to be miserable not to be suffering he made you to be delivered amen he made you to watch to learn how to have a confidence in The God Who is literally right there right now watching what you want during this service caring for what your thought is caring for what your need is wanting to interact but only asking you to believe amen believe what his blood is right there take in your place and what it will do everything the blood said it would do hallelujah hallelujah let's jump down he says isn't it strange a simple lamb had to take our place and he saw the lamb he preceded out John hadn't saw him because he had been way back in the eternities even making intercession and showing that those who had come to God under the offering of the blood of blls and of goats and substitution offering he he also caused them who believed it pointed to him and the blood had not been shed yet so he was there to clear them he was there to clear you and I Hallelujah his Gathering of the people unto him think about it the very ones that could say son stand still under the sacrifice of a of the blood of a goat yes so if a goat's blood would do that because it was sinless what would the Lamb's blood do God's blood see brother sister there's there's a disconnect in our Revelation with this blood and what it does this Blood was actually to bring you back to communion with God this Blood was actually shed to to not make you just get by it was made to put you as an overcomer Hallelujah Glory to what his blood destroyed the works of the devil it destroyed them no wonder brother brandom could come to a place and say Satan is nothing but a bluff he has no power he's just fooling your mind Hallelujah I hope it's all right but we just had a testimony from the church and they were going through all these problems and and you know what they went to the doctor they did all the scans nothing then they had to go do they did MRI and then they had to go back and do cast canans and the whole time they're in this excruciating pain excruciating just just messed up and then when the results came back from the CAT scan the doctor said I I don't you know or the nurse said the nurse give the information said said I don't know what to tell you there's nothing wrong with you and he said he had just had a family member come by and make a comment about uh oh God have mercy ah his son his son made a made a comment about whatever but uh I'm not going to remember it but anyway that a thought came to him and said maybe it's just that spiritual oppression that you're living under he he was it it was it was a it was a nervous condition right and so he said he said you know what nothing's wrong with me and so he's just like well praise the Lord there's nothing wrong with me Lord your blood your and what within just a couple days everything went away hallah but think about it they were just dealing with it because of the State of Mind the devil was putting them in well you have to suffer yep yep there is 15 things wrong with you yep web WebMD is right right you know they never point you to the Natural ones they they point you to the one you got a headache and it's going it's going to be 880,000 hits and Pages you got everything no wonder people die after that they believe that you believe it but if you don't believe it then what can what can stop you because what you actually say you're believing in them I'm believing on a lamb that I believe has ordained me for a Rapture amen he is standing there with his blood right now making intercession for my unbelief return to cender Hallelujah Romans 8:34 almost done he who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yay rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us remember that don't mean he's sitting at the right hand that's a power and authority yes Jesus is at the power and authority of God the same God that created this world to make intercession for you hallelujah hallelujah he said now watch close this is something you must get now he had been doing his mediator work making intercessions for the believer for 2,000 years he had been uh he had been back there a lamb he stepping forth from eternity to take the title be break the seals reveal the Mysteries wi of it at the end time do you get it all right we'll go on then I love this all the Mysteries lays in these Seven Seals I got things opening up to me I am super excited about God help me because I'm on the way but Hebrews 7:22 says by so much was Jesus made assurity of a better Testament and they truly were many priests because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death but this man because he continueth ever hath an unchangeable priesthood where wherefore he is able also to save save to the them to the uttermost that come unto God by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them Hallelujah he ever that's why he's living right now to make intercession for your needs to stand between between you and your problem and to make it right with God that's right oh Hallelujah I'm GNA close I got to close if I if I know I'm I moved in the restroom time I got to go Hallelujah I'm Not Innocent especially after a good old CAO Hallelujah all right fifth seal look he says notice now that if there's no altar of of sacrifice in heaven where is a sacrifice for sin L then the lamb there has to be a place where that slain lamb bloody is laying there where the blood is now the incense was the odor uh odorous stuff that they burn which the Bible said was the prayers of the Saints if there isn't No sacrifice on the altar then the prayers cannot be received it's only by the blood on the sacrificial altar that let the prayers go through to God so where you where are your prayers going see that's why Satan doesn't want you to pray that's why he wants to stop you from constantly being in prayer when the scripture said pray unceasing yeah he don't like that scripture at all because that type of connection with god with Revelation when you apply the token on that Hallelujah he's right there Hallelujah to answer my prayers to see my needs Hallelujah let's see where we're at let's close Hebrews 4:14 seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet yet without sin Let Us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in time of need so what's your qualification where's Christ at right now he's in the Temple of Heaven now brother Bram says it in a lot of different ways your pastor could probably tell you but in some places he said that the altar was laying right behind the throne some plac he said it's right out of the throne I don't fully know but I know it's there am and I know that blood's applied let's stand so brother cam what are you trying to get to us I hope you can catch this when you have a revelation that Christ is not dead when you have a revelation that he's well I can't see him or maybe he hasn't talked to me maybe the Satan likes to keep us isolated from God that's that's his that's his whole game plan because if he can keep you isolated from God especially to a living God who's closer to you than you even imagine not only is he there but he's he's living for the purpose to hear your prayer he's living for the purpose to answer your prayer he cares the same way he's always cared this message was sent in this hour to reveal to us what God is actually doing right now for usah so that we wouldn't have to wonder about it hallelujah hallelujah you have to worry about it you g say well maybe maybe he loves me see he's at the mercy seat right now what's it called you said you said Mercy absolutely you know it's one of my favorite words I live by it it's the only thing I can present to God the need for Mercy Hallelujah you know what when I fall you know what I do I ask for Mercy you know what I what I do when I fall after that ask for Mercy I found it pretty handy that he named the seat of the application of the blood The Mercy Seat the Bible says he delighteth in Mercy it is his pleasure that his blood was shed and placed there because you were constantly in need of mercy so if that blood has been applied and stands in your gap for you what does that make possible right now it makes possible another pouring out it makes possible a healing it makes possible a closer walk with God hallelujah because I'm not just preaching something this is what his word says this is his desire that you might know these things that you could be purified and stand spotless as the Bride of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah it's so simple brother and sister but if we were to be honest is it living out how many are in the spot I'm I'm right there myself you know what I don't want to have a different type of Holy Ghost I don't I don't I don't want to have uh you know just some sort of message holy ghost or something like that I want to have the Bible Holy Ghost Hallelujah you know one thing that makes the book of Acts so powerful is the book of Acts actually shows that just as much as there was a supernatural moving there was a supernatural guidance of God there's a supernatural connection with God hallelujah I think sometimes if we'd reach out to Heaven we'd say God give me that connection Lord fill me with that Spirit like that that I can always do your will that's my desire yes hallelujah hallelujah how many catch that tonight or this afternoon that there's a God that wants to move for your behalf right now it's his will it says it's his will well what stands in the way if sin in the way that's why there's Mercy there Hallelujah yes if if you're if you're Leo Dean if you're lukewarm there's a blood there to provide for that if you feel separated there's a blood right there for that I always start personal start personal brother sister Hallelujah and I'm so glad that God has made it in times past that everyone can be in that spot wanting to find God like that and he can fall in the whole place love the Lord amen hallelujah let's bow our heads if it's come upon your heart and you say God I just want it to be more of a reality Lord yes Lord that you're alive and working for me right now that that you really care about me you really want to do the same things you did while you were here in flesh oh God in my life I don't have to feel alone I don't have to feel abandoned I don't have to feel unworthy because your blood hasn't just paid the price but it's there at the mercy seat of Heaven A Place more real than where we're at right now yet you knowing you would Place those real thoughts that you had from the foundation of the world here right now which we are and you'd be trying to bridge the chasm between lukewarmness and the hot fire of the Holy Spirit we're asking today oh God see every heart oh God and Lord whatever is on their their their need list right now God whether it's a closer walk whether it's Deliverance or strength wherever they be found oh God Revelation there's a God that's there with Mercy to give it to us now we're asking oh God right now as we reach oh God out to this near sacrifice oh God Lord you're standing in the gap for us now we apply the blood oh God we know it's there you've witnessed it oh God you've poured out through it and Lord this afternoon oh God we're asking oh God draw us oh God to a greater revelation of what Redemption has paid the price for that you're there right now to meet our needs God it's a dark time it's a hard time we don't want to be lay to sin we don't we don't want to fall short Lord we want to be United in the nature of God Lord we pray oh God even right now in the name of Jesus Christ that oh God we reach to that place where there's Mercy where you're hearing our prayer God meet the needs of the people show them that even as individuals you care on their need oh God that you're there for them oh God give them that uh if it be a supernatural nudge oh God whatever would be oh God a little Revelation strike that there you are oh [Music] God move us oh God out of any complacency Place us into the fire of God we know that the same God whose will it was to go there apply the blood and pour out the spirit is there right now with the same blood to pour out the spirit now we just pray right now oh God pour out your spirit in our lives in our hearts oh God and every thought that comes may you be found there by the blood we just give our whole selves unto you now in the name of Jesus Christ we say amen amen amen we're invite our pastor if anyone has a need how be happy to pray with you see there's a God it was his will to make this known to you so you wouldn't have to worry you wouldn't have to complain or or take on Satan's Crown but you'd be happy you'd be free you'd watch that every time the battle comes he'll make a wayl aren't you glad h is he is here oh and he is here oh lelu he is here amen he he is here holy holy [Music] for [Music] [Applause]
