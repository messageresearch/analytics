read verse seven joshua nine verse seven ready one two three and the men of israel said unto the hivites per adventure ye dwell among us and how shall we make a league with you okay let's go to isaiah 41. isaiah 41 verse 10. it's been a beautiful verse very encouraging like i said my girls but they men have been quoting these scriptures at night you know because everybody gets scared you know sometimes kids get scared at night so they've been putting i found papers with it written on there so keep it up girls keep quoting the word that's the that's the time to learn it when you're young quote the word in your trials and you'll quote the rest of your life i still quote scripture as my mom taught me you know ii timothy 1 7 and so forth isaiah 41 verse 10. let's read that together on

have one more word of prayer let's ask the holy spirit to minister to us if you have a need on your heart just make another god heavenly father we come again reverently in the house of the lord we're so thankful god to sing the songs this morning to worship you we're so glad we can say that i'm one of them dear god and lord send the reign of the holy ghost start it in us the revival lord god

can ever help you with with anything about you know youtube or anything let me know i'm happy to help you or larkin or anything about the message we're happy to do that we just want to uh we just want to believe the truth so let's look at this league with the gibby knights this morning we'll try to take a little bit of time and preach on this you know we're coming off as far as the story of joshua we're coming off just a great victory right we looked at chapter 8 where they finally got victory over a.i uh they started off of course and i think i'll show this map here they started off crossing jordan right uh went to gilgal so before any battle they had to circumcise the people right the people had to be circumcised which represented the baptism of the holy ghost so crossing jordan and being circumcised were both a type of the baptism baptism of the holy ghost and so see god wasn't in a hurry right god wasn't in a hurry he knew there are certain things that had to be done right he knew all the nations would fall god is in control god's not worried about that god knew the people needed circumcised they knew they needed he knew they needed the reproach of egypt rolled completely away god knows if we're going to be real soldiers today everything from the world has to be cut away praise god we have to we have to realize that we're a new creature in christ we're living a new life your old associates got to be cut away your old addictions got to be cut away praise god amen your own lifestyle has to seem like a totally different lifestyle praise god right you're living a a new life now in christ jesus amen you're ruling and reigning in this life by jesus christ the reproach from egypt the reproach from the world has been rolled away and so they crossed into gilgal and then they went to jericho a flawless victory praise god right they just walked around and they obeyed every word of god god gave them a tremendous victory and then remember they thought joshua the leaders thought well we can just go up to a.i however we want they didn't consult god so 36 men died joshua come back god rebuked joshua right but yet god brought him back into victory amen that's what god will do with us god will be gracious to us he'll correct our mistakes but then he'll lead us into more victory amen and they go up to ai they get the great victory we saw how god did that and then god brought them between the two mountains remember and then the ark sat in between them and god rehearsed all the blessings and all the curses of the covenant so i like that god god gives us victories he helps us through our defeats you know and god is gracious to never leave us or forsake us amen hallelujah and now here we see in chapter 9 that uh in verse 1 it came to pass when all the kings which were on this side of jordan in the hills in the valleys in the coast of the great sea over the lebanon against lebanon the hittite the amorite and the canaanite the perizzites and the hivi and the jebusite heard thereof so after they heard about ai and jericho verse 2 that they gather themselves together to fight with joshua and with israel with one accord and when the inhabitants of gibbon heard what joshua had done unto jericho and to ai they did work wily and went and made as if they had been ambassadors and took sacks upon their asses and wine bottles old and rent and bound up okay so i just want to share a few things here after these great victories in jericho and ai all these kings they start gathering but but the people of but the gibby knights there uh choose not to now these were warriors these men were some of the most cruel men you'd ever want to meet right they were bloodthirsty in fact that's why god was going to drive him out of the promised land they were so wicked with their sexual sins and their uh their murderous traits all their characteristics god was going to drive them out of the land but these these gibeonites realize this god must be the true god right they all had their own gods right they all worshiped gods and they thought you know even if even if a heathen king defeated another heathen king they thought well my gods came through but when they heard about israel's god they never heard such testimonies before so they thought well he must be a greater god than all the other ones and all these other kings these five kings they rally against joshua but they give you nice to have a realization and a fear of god and realize if their god has done this to jericho and ai he's certainly going to destroy us as well and so they they concoct this plan on how they can trick joshua okay let me skip ahead now now just so you know i couldn't find any brother random quotes on this chapter so i'm basing it all up off all based on what i know from what brother adam said plus all what i found in history okay so i'm just doing my best to preach this uh this chapter now here the gibeonites work wildly or shrewd or crafty in the hebrew okay and it's in order to deceive joshua and his princes and church look it actually works see because israel asked not counsel at the mouth of the lord okay so here joshua is still the greatest commander he's the greatest general the world's ever seen outside of christ because he's a spiritual general but yeah even joshua coming off two great victories jericho and ai even he as a man was able to be deceived when he didn't consult the lord okay now just so you know in verses three and seven we learned that the the gibeonites are actually hivites and hivites were one of the people groups joshua's supposed to drive out but because they lived at gibeah uh i've seen now i've got to go back to that map so i'm that's the last time i don't go back to the map but because the hivites lived in the that location called gibeon they were called gibeonites okay so in other words these are heathens right that are supposed to be under god's judgment okay but yet god here shows them mercy and we're going to see why here we're going to see why now there's at least a three lessons church we can learn in this text we can learn about the shrewdness of the gibeonites we can learn about israel's failure to seek the lord's counsel and we can also learn about the amazing mercy of the lord all right so first let's look at the shrewness of the giving nights now if you got your bible turn to luke 16. let's let's look at this parable it is one of the most misunderstood parables in the bible go to luke 16 if you would 1-13 and i'll tell you i'll be honest every time i read it i'm a little bit sometimes i really i got to go back and say what what was this i could look at my notes what was this all about because the way jesus words it is it's different to us we're not easterners right now to the easterner they totally understand it this is an eastern book this is not a western book praise god this is an eastern book and we're trying to understand it with our western minds so we need constant reminders from hebrew sources and also from the holy spirit to understand it okay so verse 1 luke 16 verse 1 and he said unto his disciples there was a certain rich man which had a steward and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods and he called him and said unto him how is it that i hear this of thee give an account of thy stewardship for thou mayest be no longer steward then the steward said within himself what shall i do for my lord taketh away from me my stewardship i cannot dig so he wasn't he wasn't a i'm ashamed so he didn't want to go into manual labor he wouldn't do another overseeing job and just be like a supervisor right and he didn't want to be a beggar on the street so he's like i'm going to lose my job what should i do verse 4. now here's why jesus praises him he knows he's going to lose his job pretty soon but look at verse 4 i am resolved what to do that when i am put out stewardship they may receive me into their houses so this man is looking out for himself he doesn't want to do manual labor and he doesn't want to live on the street right something pretty simple to understand verse 5. so he called every one of his lords editors unto him and said in the first how much owest thou unto my lord so he meets with the people that he are actually indebted to his master that's going to fire him right so this steward took his master's money i'll lend you a hundred dollars okay right but then when he realized it now he must have stole some of that money too he must have said well i'm gonna take 200 but i'll take 100 for me and i'll borrow 100 to you he must have been very he wasted it he did something wrong we're not told exactly what he did wrong we did something wrong well he realizes i'm gonna lose it so here's what he does he goes back in verse six and he said a hundred measures of oil and he sent him take thy bill sit down quickly and write fifty in other words you owe me a hundred but just pay 50 and i'll write it down that you're paid off okay so is that is that just no that's unjust he's actually cheating his me his master out of money but he's still getting his master some money but not all of it verse seven and then he said to another and how much oh it's thou and he said a hundred measures of wheat he said in him take thy bill right four score or 80. so just pay 80 percent of your bill and i'll let the other 20 slide now he's giving them a break on their loan and this is not because he's a kind-hearted person this is because he's a selfish person because remember he's like i can't work i'm not gonna go dig ditches and i'm not gonna beg on the street but i'm gonna give my creditors a discount so that later they'll let me move into their house look at verse 8 and the lord commanded the unjust steward now look the lord comes back his master comes backs and commends him because he had done wisely or truly now this wouldn't be holy ghost wisdom does everyone understand that lying and not paying debts off is not holy ghost wisdom right he said but this is he said for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light now this doesn't mean they're wiser than christians right as far as godly things but what jesus is saying is that sinners like this take more preparation to make sure they have some future needs met in other words worldly people care more about their future here than christians care about their future here that's all jesus is saying in other words sinners will care more about their future in akron then you and i will right like most for example most worldly churches make sure they own the church but you know what we don't care because it all belongs to god right that's an example but brother but jesus is saying here he's he he's doing more for his future he's preparing more for his future than christians would okay now look at verse nine but before we read that let me say it again sinners are not wiser than us because if you've got the wisdom of god you can recognize that the mark of the beast is going to come out of that mother heart and praise god and because of that you came out of her amen so you've got the real wisdom of god this is just speaking of natural wisdom this is talking about financial shrewdness because i came out of the presbyterian church chapel i came out of that fast as i could because i saw they taught the same things as the mother harlot praise god so see we have to be very careful how we interpret this this parable and i say to you make to yourselves look what he says verse 9 friends of the mammon of unrighteousness that when you fail you may receive you into everlasting habitations so jesus actually tells the people here he said you can learn a little bit from this now it looks oh yeah he's speaking to the pharisees ah okay so jesus yeah if you go back to chapter 15 verse five i'm sorry verse two and three he's talking to the pharisees and the scribes that murmured he's actually talking to the scribes and pharisees i'm saying to you make to yourselves friends of the man and of the unrighteousness that when you fail you may receive you into everlasting invitations he's not talking to christians right he's talking to the pharisees in other words pharisees you better take care of your future too right you better prepare for the future like this guy did this guy's like i'm not gonna work i'm not gonna break my back and i'm not gonna beg on the street so i'm at least have somebody to live with i can live with i gave i forgave that guy 50 bucks he'll let me stay for a few days i forgave that guy 20. he'll let me stay for a few days but i'm not going back i'm not going back in the workforce to break my back does everybody understand now look at now here's here's the point of the the parable look at verse 10 he that's faithful and which is least is faithful also in much and he that is unjust in the least is also in the much so jesus is not glorifying unjust people he's just saying look at their preparation for the future jesus says though we should have been faithful if we were faithful we wouldn't have lost the stewardship to begin with praise god are you with me this guy was unfaithful so he loses his stewardship if we're faithful we'll be stewards in this life and in the life to come praise god amen if we're faithful and with 10 pounds here we'll rule over 10 cities there hallelujah so the point of the parable is to say be faithful and yes prepare for the future that's why i pay insurance and that's why i have life insurance if i die then my wife can pay off the house and have a little bit of money so she has a little time to prepare because i don't know what's going to happen i'm going to prepare for the future praise god right i'm i'm not going to be a fool right and we both we all have life insurance you know some of it's really small but we got a little bit just in case the lord would take one of us home i think there's some wiz jesus says there's some wisdom in that praise god but it's not to be unjust it's not to deceive like this unjust man just to say look at the lengths he went to make sure he had a secure place to live and jesus commends him for that right now the real thing is us to prepare to make sure we have a room in that new city praise god amen our desire should we make sure make sure there's a mansion there with my name on it praise god amen hallelujah thank you jesus verse 11. if therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous commandment who will commit to your trust the true witches so see he's not glorifying this unjust man he's saying you got to be faithful with you you need to be a faithful steward now right you got to be faithful with the word now and then god will give you true riches later on amen hallelujah and if you have not been faithful in that which is another man's who shall give you that which is your own see we're all we're all working with god's money are we not who gave you the strength to go to work who gave that big raise i get them too so i thank the lord bad right we all do at some point we all get raises most of us right thank god who gives us that raise god but it's really god's favor on our lives amen but we got to be faithful with that we got to pay our tithes we got to give offerings we got to give to the poor praise god amen and then if we're faithful with god's money he'll make us ruler in the millennium praise god he'll make us rulers over cities and nations the bible says if we're faithful with these men and this mammon here god will make us rulers there hallelujah look he even goes to verse 13 he finishes with this now no servant can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one despise the other you cannot serve god amen so this unjust steward hated his master that's why he wasted his goods and jesus saying don't hate the lord or you need to hate riches right hate the world and love god love your master amen love your savior love your creator he's given you life breath you're being every good and perfect gift church help help us to remember that god's given you every good perfect gift amen we ought to serve god because we love him amen not because we're afraid of him or or we don't we dislike him or something like that he's the faithful householder amen he's the loving householder and i serve him with love in my heart praise god now hopefully that helps you by god's grace because that really helped me so i can see the similarities between the gibeonites and also with this parable because they both have shrewdness and jesus likes that he liked that to some degree because that's what we should be doing with spiritual things we should be laying up treasures in heaven hallelujah i don't think we should be laying up treasures in heaven amen where thieves can't break in where moth can't destroy praise god and love our master the lord jesus remember in verse 4 the the steward found a way to secure future housing christ's emphasis on faithfulness preparedness motivated by love to ensure our natural and eternal destinations that's why he told the parable and so that's what the giving knights do church since now look god accepts the giving night so look at this the word said they should have been killed god's command of joshua's don't let any of them live right but god here spares their lives from judgment you know i just put this this is a little different uh so i said their wiley works do not seem the same as satan's wiles in other words i don't believe that gibby knights had satan's wiles i don't think it was a i personally don't believe that i believe it was god's mercy okay and i'm going to prove that to you hopefully by the end of this you know because the bible said they they were wiley but i don't believe it was the devil necessarily and here's why uh oh yeah in verse nine and ten also in joshua chapter nine the bible said they knew about them so the the gibeonites knew about i'm sorry the bible said they didn't know yeah yeah so here let's go back to the giveaways when the given nights come to them they have moldy bread right if you read the chapter they have moldy bread and uh their clothes are all old and torn and they kind of deceived joshua and the people so in verse 9 and 10. they said from a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the lord thy god for we have heard the fame of him and all they did in egypt now look they just talk about egypt so they lie they have a partial truth but it's not a full truth but one thing i want you to notice church they feared the lord god amen they fear jehovah elohim praise god and they thought the only way i'll be able to uh live is if i if i trick god's people so my life will be spared this god is so great we fear this god so much he they're destroying everyone all we can do is try to trick them and try to see if our lives can be spared and it worked let me tell you like this church anytime a soul wants to be spared it's going to work i'm going to say it again anytime a soul humbles themselves and repents it's going to work the thief on the cross was mocking jesus for a while but then the holy spirit came and he said i deserve this this man has done nothing wrong he said remember me praise god and god had mercy on him and said i'll remember you you'll be with me this day in paradise amen god remembers god will spare all those who come to him in mercy praise god amen judas didn't do that though judas went and hung himself he didn't come back humbly to christ and repent let me tell you god will accept anybody who comes asking for mercy this is exactly what he did our god is a gracious god we'll show you this i just got a few scriptures on that god is very gracious church verse 10 and all that he did to the two kings of the amorites that were beyond jordan to sion king of heshbon and to ah king of beishan which was at astra so these gibeonites are pretending oh we only know about things before jared they don't even bring up jericho so see they're very wily they're very deceptive uh they have a pretty good plan to trick somebody look church satan satan can trick us in many ways right he could trick us in many ways but sometimes it now i believe this wasn't satan i believe this was actually god's grace to them right but sometimes see god will let us make mistakes to show his mercy on us and other people and that's what this story really magnifies the grace of god so we learn now look here israel fails to seek god's counsel look at verse 14 and the man took of their victuals and ask not counsel at the mouth of the lord now look church we learn from this we cannot trust what we see with our eyes praise god amen joshua saw moldy bread he saw tattered clothes all the princess look around what do you brothers think yeah let's forgive them let's spare their lives right but see they never thought we should pray should we pray about this and and and should we look past what we see and should we shall we ask god about this and they only trusted in what they saw church we did the same thing all the time we see something on our phone and we think oh that's going to happen right oh i know that's going to happen i see it i saw the effects of it instead of asking god god is there something i don't see is there something greater than this are you going to change the situation praise god amen now look proverbs says trust the lord with all thine heart lean not on their own understanding so in this case joshua leans on his own understanding it's the second time he's done that a church you read the rest of the book of joshua does god ever get done with joshua and throw him out to the dump and say i'm done with you you failed me twice i'll just get somebody else no because the word of god came to him said as i was with moses so shall i be with thee amen hallelujah hallelujah moses made mistake after mistake after mistake but god never forsook him god will never forsake us despite our mistakes because he loves us he called us we're his covenant people praise god he'll never leave us or forsake us hallelujah but it lets us know there's going to be times that we we learn we're not trusting in god like we ought to so it's a moment of repentance it's a moment of sanctification say god help me to pray next time before i do this because no doubt i'm going to meet more people in the future right no doubt we're gonna we're gonna be tested again god help me to pray next time instead of just accepting this simple answer see in all thy ways acknowledge him they didn't acknowledge god with the gibby knights they just saw the old moldy bread okay sorry we won't kill you and he shall direct thy past and now remember the bible said we walk by faith and not by sight we don't look at what we see praise god we look at what god says right we look at the revelation of god's word we look with spiritual eyes not with natural eyes so see these are great lessons you can learn see verse 14 says they plainly didn't ask for the lord's counsel just like at a.i we do the same thing now church this was an act of god's mercy blessed are the merciful jesus said for they shall obtain mercy let me ask you joshua's merciful to them do you think god was merciful to joshua yeah israel showed mercy to the gibby knight do you think god showed mercy to israel later oh yeah especially after joshua died god kept sending them judge after judge after judge after judge in other words god said god kept sending them deliverance after deliverance after deliverance other words god kept hearing their prayer god never rejected them god was faithful to them if you show mercy to somebody god will show mercy to you it's the law of god see jesus said blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy church i i forget the number of years but i preached on that years ago remember remember when i preached through all the kings of israel remember that it was over in the other room i calculated and i forget the number of years i think it was like 200 or 300 300 extra years uh the southern kingdom judah existed longer than the northern kingdom the northern kingdom had no godly king they had ahab and a bunch of renegades but they were totally uh taken to captivity hundreds of years before judah because judah had god's mercy because they had some faithful kings there praise god they had josiah they had hezekiah amen they had some men of god they had asa they had some good kings and because they had good merciful kings god gave them longer time to dwell in the land until last zedekiah was a heathen basically for israel and they took judah out of the promised land as well nebuchadnezzar took him out so that's just one example if if if if you show mercy god is going to extend mercy for you praise god how many trust in god's mercy today i am i am certainly now here let's look at god's amazing mercy toward the giving nights now church all things work together for good even our mistakes it's like brother jose's testimony i thought just it went in perfectly when we make mistakes now this was a this was a mistake god made it work out for their for their good later on okay we'll get to that in a minute now church look god this also shows god is very merciful to sinners even at the very last moment remember that map remember that map of israel they just got done with ai what was next gibeon was next at the last moments before they're going to be destroyed god showed mercy to them praise god now look here's what i heard a preacher say too god could have revealed that deception to joshua but he didn't church how many times has god shown you things or given you a word from the lord to help you not to be deceived well many times or not to believe a lie or not to look at that or not to do that or not to go there not to say that how many times has god protected us in advance but this time god doesn't reveal to joshua the deception so it shows god was in it god was in it to save lives listen church if god saved all those egyptian lives in the days of joshua what about here pray i'm sorry days of joseph god sent one man joseph to save all those healing lives why because god is rich in mercy here it is god again sending sending these giving eyes to joshua to show mercy anybody that wants to be saved can be saved amen anybody that believes there's a way there's at least one hope to be saved god will save them amen hallelujah praise god there's such hope for salvation praise god and they're now listen they're under the judgment of god but they still seek mercy amen that's just like david when he sought mercy for that first child with him in bathsheba he sought mercy he thought well perhaps god will show grace see because he knew god was a god of grace that's how i want to be i'm going to want to ask for god's grace there's people i know that have called the pillar of fire picture brother ram they've called it the devil and they blast him the holy ghost brother jose i still pray for them sometimes because i don't know if they did it ignorantly or not remember you can blaspheme ignorantly and not know what you're doing okay let's read that that's first timothy chapter one people can blaspheme first timothy 1 13 and not even know what they're doing so for me i wait till i get a definite leading from the holy ghost not to pray for people because if there was mercy for the giving nights there's mercy for the egyptians just not that's just natural life right we don't even know if anyone got saved but just natural life god was showing mercy if there was mercy for all these individuals if there's mercy for saul of tarsus then let's seek mercy for others as well first timothy 1 13. actually let's read verse 12 because it's beautiful i thank christ jesus our lord who hath enabled me for he hath counted me faithful putting me into the ministry now look was he faithful before no he wasn't faithful before the conversion he's faithful after the conversion so god saw the future god saw he would be faithful so god saved him god saw you would be faithful to praise god he wasn't looking at your past life he's looking at what he knew you'd be if you had a chance at mercy when was paul faithful to jesus he wasn't faithful to jesus before his conversion he's faithful after when when he had a real run-in with christ see before he just blasted me in jesus he didn't he didn't really know it was wrong that's why he didn't i'm sorry he didn't know it was right forgive me he thought it was wrong he didn't know what was right but then when he met jesus face to face now that's different now he never blessed him after that hallelujah praise god he couldn't because he knew he was real he knew christ was the lord he said lord lord won't you have me who are you lord he said i'm jesus amen thank god that jesus came to you and said i'm jesus i'm the living savior i'm the living son of god serve me i'm real thank god he shows us how real he is amen from that moment when it became real you never speak against it again let me share this growing up in denominations i blaspheme the holy ghost all the time and i hate to say that but i've shared it before my brothers and i would laugh at the tongue speakers we would laugh and we'd knock and make fun but church it never fell on me so i was ignorant i didn't know what i was doing once the holy ghost fell on me that's a whole different thing praise god and this is and this is the scripture that i hang my soul on if god forgave paul who blasphemed christ and caused many others to blast him if god for he forgave him and gave him a ministry and saw his future faithfulness then god can give me a ministry and see my future faithfulness amen church we have to find ourselves in the bible thank god that we have all these stories because in one of those stories is your story that's why i love paul i feel like he's well he's just like my story cam too you know we're so thankful verse 13 who was before a blasphemer paul said god counted me faithful yet before i was a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurist and i obtained mercy because i did it ignorantly in unbelief and i've prayed this many times for the mj i'd say lord jesus forgive me for making fun of those tongues interpretation people i said forgive me i did it ignorantly i didn't know what i was doing how i long though for tongues interpretations today how how i pray for that how i pray for miracles now praise god i pray for words of wisdom and words of knowledge amen i always pray lord let them be done in the name of thy holy child jesus amen see now i see now i can tell that it was ignorantly because before i laughed at it now i crave it amen now ask god for more of it give us more of your grace more of your understanding more of your anointing praise god same thing as paul he hated it before blasphemed it now he loves it now he teaches everybody about it oh thank god for grace hallelujah see it all depends if you do it ignorantly or not let's go to okay go to acts 8 3 acts 8 3. let's look at some of the things paul did before this was really uh just eye opening and kind of refreshing to me i i finished the book of acts a while back a couple months ago and i was just amazed at all that god had forgiven saul for acts eight but if you look at verse one he was consenting unto his death stephen's and at that time there was great persecution against the church now verse three and saw he made a havoc of the church entering into every house inhaling men and women committing them to prison this guy wasn't some internet troll like we fight today right brother like i get youtube trolls like they're just rebuking me name call me this this guy wasn't one of those he was one of those that would break down your door and say let me come in you're going to prison all right that's kind of that's the kind of man this was he wasn't a little zealous he was extremely zealous hatred against all christians he would break down your door brother mj and drag you off to prison right he would he would break down my door and drag my family and all of us to prison in chains because he had a and he he'd have the the law right there he said i've got the written law right here you're guilty you're going to jail he'd break down doors the bible says he made havoc of the church threw him in prison uh go to chapter 22 verse 4 22 4. acts 22 verse 4. and i persecuted this way unto the death binding and delivering into prisons both men and women death i persecute this way unto death in other words like stephen he wanted to see christians die he wanted to see them killed and he saw steven there he held their look at that he held their coats while they stoned him with stones imagine had a big smile on his face he really deserves that that idolater that that blasphemer if the whole time he was the one guilty of blasphemy right church look at verse 5 22 5. also the high priest doth bear me witness that with all the estate of the elders from whom i receive letters in damascus and went to damascus to bring them which were bound unto jerusalem for to be punished so he knew they were going to get beat in the prisons and he was all for it yeah beat them up kick them knock out their teeth bruise them because they're blossoming jehovah look at verse 19. see and he and he basically takes credit for beating them we don't know if paul actually did beat up christians but he takes credit at least because he took them to prison where they would be beaten look at verse 19. and i said lord they know that i'm imprisoned and beat i imprisoned and i beat in every synagogue them that believed on these so he went to every church of that day and and found all the christians took them to jail made sure they were at least beaten chapter 26 verse 10. and in all this church god behind all that anger all that hatred god saw a faithful prophet god saw a man who'd be faithful to preaching and he'd cross the seas to praise amen he'd suffer through shipwrecked and beaten god saw in him he's a faithful man he's just misguided right now by the devil wait till the light of god wait till i shine the light of god wait till i open his eyes he's going to be a real faithful man of god but right now he was a blasphemer idolatrous yes beat him up yes stone him kill them take them to prison those bunch of blasphemy christians verse 10 26 10 and 11. which thing i did in jerusalem and many of the saints that i shut up in prison so it wasn't a couple people he put in prison many many people having received authority from the chief priests and when they were put to death they look at that day i gave my voice against them they sure so they look paul was responsible for more than stephen did you catch that they they were put to death it wasn't just stephen it was numerous people died because of paul and look how god look how merciful god is the very one killing them right when those martyrs died they got a martyr's crown and then when paul gets converted he saves and preaches and then he dies as a martyr gets the same crown as the other ones they both get a martyr's crown the one paul had killed the one spot the many paw had imprisoned and killed that were killed they got martyr's crown and jesus changes his heart shows him his blasphemy he doesn't blast him again and then he's willing to give his life and he gets a martyr's crown as well that's a god of grace that we serve church that's the god of grace that we serve so i know even though i blasphemed and made fun of gifts of the holy ghost when i was younger i know god's forgiven me because i look at my life now and now i'm trying to get people to get to know their gifts right i want all of you to know your gifts i want you to manifest all the gifts in your life amen hallelujah so we can see church we can see god's mercy in here now look god could have re revealed it to joshua but he did it god exalts his grace above all our mistakes so which is greater paul's murder and beating in imprisonments or is jesus's grace greater his grace is much greater now look church good can always come out of our mistakes right think of any mistake you made if you look at it long enough you're gonna see ah like one time i i told this i made a mistake with sister lady i told her yeah it's okay for you to move to iraq uh or saudi arabia and you can still live stream our services that was a big mistake because she had no fellowship over there and she eventually fell away and i've admitted that publicly that's a big mistake i made but now i've learned i've never counseled anybody since then to ever go to any place without a home church because the home church is where the presence of god the living fountains of living waters are flowing out and you and i must feed our souls and drink of the living waters constantly hallelujah i've learned from that mistake and i've always told people now don't go anywhere unless you've got a home church with believers because this is the body of christ and you need to stay around the body of christ because they're going to strengthen you and you're going to strengthen them you need the body of christ so that's one thing i can learn from my mistake but what about moses moses made the mistake of killing a man i imagine he just like took his fists and punched him in the the throat or something or knocked him the man dies he buries him in sand now he's a murderer accident you know maybe accidentally murdered him the next day he tries to stand up he said we know what you've done he runs for his life so moses's murder caused him to run away from the very people he's going to save but in that 40 years of testing and trying god used it to help him god beat out all the egyptian nonsense out of his mind and it just became the mindset of a shepherd just take care of sheep just be cheap just protect sheep god had to get rid of all the education and give him give him sheep mentality praise god and then god gave him a beautiful wife support who would later save his life when he made another mistake god bless him with the wife and god bless him with the father-in-law who told him moses you're taking too much on yourself he said god will take that same holy ghost on you and give it to 70 other men amen so you can rest praise god look at all the blessings and then he and then he gave him the greatest blessing of the pillar of fire the burning mesh experience he learned more about god in five minutes than 80 years before in his entire life because god was now speaking to i am that i am who are you lord i'm jesus amen praise god so even in his murder even in his his fleeing away from his country as a fugitive god had mercy on and god worked it out for his good amen church god will work out your mistakes for good just wait on him just be patient just love him and serve him just humble yourself amen and trust god he got the greatest experience of his life 40 years after being a murderer so don't give up on god church and then god gave him the greatest third of his life the greatest 40 years after the worst first 80 years of his life god gave the god gave him such power for the amen that egypt is like we're done we don't know what to do with this guy this guy lives so close to god i'm throwing out the book i don't know how to deal with this guy get out of here and that's how we can be we can live so close to god satan doesn't know what to do with us because the blessing of god is upon us amen everything we touch can be blessed if we humble ourselves and obey the word of god he won't know what to do with us see god is the great redeemer of mistakes joshua made a mistake no problem god wasn't up there said you you loser you're such a failure god's like i knew it was going to happen i'm going to bless you anyway that's what he did god because god loves his children just like you love your children brother man we love our children so god loves you and god loves us more amen we get tired of our children sometimes or we get impatient with them god doesn't get impatient with us god's love is rich it's divine patience it's long suffering it's merciful loving patience from almighty god amen god god don't get tired of your prayers god loves your prayers he's just waiting well i've let brother jesse make this mistake i can't wait till he comes back i know he's going to come back to me and pray i'm just waiting on him there's no condemnation of jesse he's in christ jesus i'm just waiting for his prayer repentance any any time now anytime right that's how it is with youtube he's not i'm going to get i finally can get rid of this guy and get somebody else in here to get this loser out of here that's not what he was like he's like he's my son he's purchased by the blood he just needs some time to learn a lesson i'm teaching him i'm training any child that doesn't get trained by me is a bastard child he's a real child of god he's dealing with his mistakes he's repenting he's learning he's just like me praise god he's taking my character he's learning how to live like i do he's learning to have the mind of christ instead of the mind of an american can i say like that i don't want the mind of an american i want the mind of christ and david david made the awful mistake of his life he saw a beautiful woman i don't know why she was bathing out there she should not have been bathing on a porch but anyways he took her lay with her sent her back and brought her husband and killed him tried to cover it up all these things yet there still came blessings out of his life now don't get me wrong church the consequence remained he had the sword in his house the rest of his life but out of solomon praise god came the greatest time of israel's history oh my goodness the greatest time because the bible said they had peace all those years it was the august time it was the golden age of israel whereas the grandest temple most beautiful building ever built gold-plated people came from all around the world to see who is this god the queen of sheba came to say is this real or not and god said this is real and your testimony will work on the day of judgment because you came to hear a one like solomon but jesus said a greater than solomon is here praise god in other words god brought the golden age of israel through david's mistake god had mercy on him and his seed remember bathsheba had four sons church salmon was just one of them he was called jedi he was called beloved god loved a child that came from a couple that committed adultery god did grace brother program labor's on it in the message of grace 1961 that's the message that has that prophecy about the rapture and about the squeeze that's right so look at that look how amazing god's grace is and then god blesses solomon and he he becomes the type of the millennium no wars everybody's in order all nations look to israel nobody was ever as rich nobody's ever is wise no one is ever as prosperous as solomon no one will ever be as prosperous as jesus christ in the millennium hallelujah and then out of the other three sons nathan was one of them and out of nathan come the very lineage of jesus christ jesus didn't come out of solomon's lineage jesus came out of nathan's lineage so out of bathsheba this adulteress whose husband was murdered out of here comes the greatest age of israel's history and also out of here comes uh the lineage of god's uh god's son jesus christ made of a woman emmanuel comes out of her as well the church don't be discouraging your mistakes and do not let satan beat you down for your mistakes you confess your mistakes and move on to the next battle that's what joshua did praise god he had one little mistake and he made it right they got the sin out of the camp they moved on to the next battle because there's more work to be done in church there's more work to be done we must carry on amen for the good of the lord and the thrill of his glory amen amen we must carry on there's work to be done we don't want to be stopped in one place we want to press all towards the mark of the high court in christ jesus he forgives you he loves you that's why he died for you amen hallelujah that's why he rose to prove that he pondered your sin it wasn't his sin that he died for it was your sin and that's why i rose to defeat your sin amen i can't be condemned for my sin anymore because christ already took the condemnation the price has been paid it is finished satan the case against this church it is finished jesus is bread paid the price it is no longer up for debate jesus christ paid the price the ransom and paid we are free and it's independence day i'm free from my sins i'm free from my slavery so are you we're all free from our slavery through the name of jesus christ i'm free from my blasphemy i'm free i won't be a slave to i don't even remember those things hardly unless one of these scriptures comes across and reminds me but i appreciate that i'm living such a different life now i don't even remember what it's like to be a sinner many times every now and then i get a little temptation you know what i mean but as a christian you live such a new life you're such a new creation in christ that's the only thing that avails amen that's the only thing that will prevail against satan's temptation is a new life we must live new we must live like we're brand new start each day like you're brand new start it new i got a fresh start today i confessed my sin yesterday i got a fresh start i'm his beloved the bible says you're beloved right the bible says we are his beloved just like solomon just like daniel hallelujah thank god good always comes out of your mistakes like like my uncle told me he said jesse the reason your dad left you is because you would never leave your eight children i said that's exactly right had to know what it was like to be left that feeling in order to motivate me to never leave my responsibilities praise god and i wouldn't change a thing about it now i mean it'd be nice if i could but i can't in other words god has to give free will to everybody but because my dad left six of us i'll never leave all eight of mine right because all things work together for good like i was telling the church i said when my dad left i got three more simon came and said him my dad left god gave me three more i didn't know yeah that's how i looked at it right that's how i look at it now that they they they basically went with me to football they went with me to basketball they wanted me to track they were just there all the time anytime i need something sam can i borrow the car cam can i borrow the car that's how i got saved listen to his christian music you know see my dad wasn't he his free will wasn't to save me so god used cam my other dad amen see all things work together for good to them that love the lord i believe it you should believe it we should thank god for it amen so don't let satan discourage about your mistakes or things that happen learn from it move on find the good out of it and if you don't know live live forward and know that god is going to bring something good out of it amen because we're all going to make mistakes even joshua jehovah's our salvation even joshua made mistakes and we've seen two of them playing me right here well i can just defeat ai i don't need to ask the lord how to defeat this enemy they lost 36 lives because aiken sin here's another one another mistake he didn't consult the lord now this one god worked out really for good there's no judgment aiken got judged now this worked out beautifully let me try to close okay what was that yeah i'm almost at the hour here so when i say that that means i got 15 minutes okay so i got 15 minutes here i think i said that wednesday that's my new thing when i say i'm going to close that means 15 minutes okay ah all things work together for good now look look what micah says who is a god like unto thee that pardons iniquity see you knew you knew see don't let the devil tell you well you knew not to do it well of course you knew not to that's because you're wise under the word of god but god still pardons your iniquity and the church said hey i i came iniquities too i think things i shouldn't think i say things i shouldn't say i work in it sometimes i work iniquity but god pardons it by the blood amen we all do things we know we shouldn't do when was the last time you didn't do you did something where brother jesse never preached on that i didn't know i should not have done that what was the last time that happened come on tell me after church if that's happened lately when was the last time you sinned and you didn't know you should not have done it see most of us when we come to the message this bible becomes a brand new bible and the holy ghost lives right here church and you make a mistake he's going to let you know right away hello so see most of the time church we are going to sin in iniquity but god is ready to pardon he's waiting there ready to forgive you just come back daughter son just come back confess your sins i want you to walk in the light you took a one step out of the light i want you to get back in that light get out of the shadows come into the light let the light of god shine upon you praise god illuminate your path [Music] pass this by see god passes by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage god sees your sin he just passes by that okay that's right that's right but he he confessed that yeah brother brother jesse did that i'm gonna i passed that yeah he did that there i'm gonna go ahead and bypass that as well he said sorry glory you know why he doesn't retain his anger forever because he loves he delights to show mercy he loves it he loves to say i forgive you yes again 70 times 7 plus beyond that i love to forgive it's my delight to show my children mercy every time i do it i delight to take my kids out to eat fast food or give them ice cream now i don't do it too much for the vanguards i'm gonna get in trouble but i delight in showing mercy there's many times i could have spanked my children maybe i didn't because i delight in mercy if i saw them crying and repenting enough there's only certain times i would use that the the the rods you know we should i have used on all of them if i don't i use my hand something like that i use something like that they got to have a church they got to have it but there's times i've delighted in showing mercy to them because i'm their father i want them to love me i want them to be correct too but i i delight many times in showing mercy oh you children you didn't get a chance to wash dishes that's okay i'll wash dishes for you i delight in showing mercy i'm not going to make you stay up later i'm going to let you go to bed remember that lydia unless you go to bed i'm going to stay up i'll wash dishes for you well then i get to save and listen to brother brown a little more you know like that i delight in showing mercy oh malcolm you forgot to take out the trash that's okay i got it buddy i delight to show mercy i won't punish you for that right which father here doesn't delight in showing mercy church micah says he'll turn again he'll have compassion on us see church even if you feel like god has turned his face toward you and he don't want nothing with you he will turn again and say come back i'm just turning my back for a season you've offended me but when you seek me you'll find me when you seek me with all your heart he'll turn back to you the bible says so he'll have compassion on us he'll subdue ah like that amen god will help you get victory over your addictions or your iniquity god will so do it god will take down the temptations god will separate you from those temptations because he's merciful amen he knows you don't want to do it he knows it hurts you and grieves you so god will subdue your iniquities he'll take that temptation away out of your life so you don't have to deal with it every day and that will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea see we picture like god's got all this list of sins backed up there by the throne of god satan's like yeah he did this this is she did that to that god like takes him and he walks over to the cliff and he throws them over there and they go never to be heard from again right that's our god and that's old testament church that's before the blood of christ came what will the blood of christ do now praise god amen i would say this it's greater because the blood of jesus christ speaks greater things than that of the abel amen grace the blood of christ speaks better than the blood of animal sacrifices that just cleanse the flesh this blood cleanses our minds this blood washes our soul hallelujah that's the god i serve that's the god you serve he said we refuse to obey nehemiah neither we're mindful thy wonders that thou dis among them harden our necks rebellion we appointed captain return to their bondage but thou are to god ready i love the scripture he delights in mercy and he's ready to pardon the question is are you ready to say you're sorry because whenever you're i know yeah whenever you're ready to say sorry he's ready to accept it right he's ready he's sitting he's sitting there just waiting i wonder when he's gonna i'm sorry god don't say that guy's like i know he's gonna come pretty soon he's gonna come uh in three hours so we'll be back i'm ready to party if you just want to say you're sorry i'm willing to get the blessings of god back on your life i'm ready to do it i delight in showing you mercy i delight in taking your load of sin and tossing it over the edge and watching it just sink into the abyss the abyss of god's forgetfulness praise god i delight in that i delight in clearing all the accounts and saying like that song says what sin what sin that's a good song we haven't seen that one for a while it was forgiven the very moment you confessed buried in the sea of forgetfulness i don't have the words exactly right but you show me if i know what i'm talking about what's in what's in it was gone the very minute you confess what's in what's in buried in the sea of forgetfulness what's it see we let satan convince us like we have all these things church as soon as you say sorry god's like what's in yeah what are you so sorry about it's already confessed you did this lat you did that last week i took care of that last week that was in your childhood you confess it i took care of that a long time ago what sin you talking about i'm i delight in mercy i'm ready to pardon i will return to you when you return to me let's finish the chapter israel heard the gibbonites lied but then but let them live because they swore by the name of jehovah elohim the self-existent one who reveals himself the strong one that's jehovah elohim the israeli congregation murmured against the leadership right sometimes that happens the prince's though assigned the gibeonites to be huwers of wood and jawlers of water unto all the congregation look at this amazing grace these are gentile hivite heathens that throw themself at the mercy of god and they say we just don't want to die whatever you choose to be whatever you choose to do with us that's fine just let us live in other words all i want is eternal life whatever you're calling me to do i'll do it i just don't want to go to hell right that's exactly what it is that's the type and so joshua says you know what we're going to make you guys huge of wood cutters of wood and carriers of water for the house of the lord in other words he doesn't send them away to the very uttermost parts of the of the kingdom i don't want you anywhere close because these men wanted mercy because they feared the name of the lord jesus christ amen a brief are they because they had fear respect for the name of the lord jesus christ he said you can't be in our priesthood but you will minister to our priesthood because you sought mercy from me i will bring you close you can't get as close as those wise virgins now you won't be in the priesthood because church we are kings and priests unto god by the baptism of the holy ghost you can't be a king and a priest but you sure can help out the priesthood you can chop our wood and pack our water and while they were doing that they said i'm i'm chopping wood for royalty i'm pulling up water for royalty i'm serving the royal priesthood i'm serving the seed of abraham thank god god didn't put me to the uttermost parts of the kingdom he didn't forget about me he let me serve his faithful wise servants on the earth he let me serve the invincible army he let me have a part in helping out this invincible army on the earth all because i threw myself at the mercy god said god just i don't want to die i don't want to go to hell just have mercy on me and god saves them and says i'm going to make you woodcutters and water packers for my invincible army now in closing i got four minutes look verse 24 says they lied because they fear the lord they fear judgment they're not the priesthood but serve the priests joshua cursed them to a life of service right but they were happy with life rather than death they were cursed in their natural work but they were blessed to live and serve god's house remember what david said i heard a preacher say this david said i'd rather be the doorkeeper at the house of god i rather open the door than to dwell in the tents of the sinners hallelujah david said it's a blessing just to be near the house of god and god takes these gentile healings and because they want mercy god said i'm going to make you wood providers water providers so my house can perform the sacrifices you will help my house carry on i'm bringing you close to the house of god i'm bringing you close to my house in other words i'm not going to forget about you brother amen right bro jesse i'm not going to forget about you now we don't believe we're forgiving a nice type but the point is god is not going to forget about anyone who desires his mercy church he saves to the uttermost let's say uttermost ready he saves you would think the gimme knights will be hivites oh there's no way they can be saved god is rich in mercy he's able to save when we think people can't be saved because he saves to the uttermost he goes beyond our thoughts his ways are greater than our ways his thoughts are higher than our thoughts god puts them close to the place where he would put his name now i don't have time church but there's so many scriptures in deuteronomy 29 god says i'm going to bring you into covenant he said even the wood choppers and the water carriers are part of my covenant now church god knew the gibeonites would do this when he spoke that to moses so in other words he was basically saying i'm going to bring these heathens i'm going to bring these gentiles into the covenant they're going to have the lowest office they have the hardest work but at least they're a part of the covenant at least they didn't have to die at least they can have mercy and i'm going to bring them close to my house they're going to serve my purpose they're going to bless my priesthood amen oh my god thank you jesus amen he knew you'd be a faithful servant amen he knew you'd be faithful with little he'll make you certain or leader or much praise god if you're faithful in the little that god gives you the man talks about the foolish version so i'm saying the giving knights are foolish virgin you know why there are god what does he say he said there are god i thought he said there are god-fearing people in here it must be a different quote he said god loving people they were a help in the work of the lord and they'll come up at the end time isn't that what the gibbonites became they became a helper to joshua's army at a time when they needed it god brought them into it did they ever become a part of the priesthood no but did they did they faithfully serve the house of god yes all of history says the gibby knight stayed there the whole time king after king at leader after leader they stayed there serving the house of god the whole time instead of dying instead of being exterminated instead of a holocaust god had mercy on them and then god blessed them over the years notice a couple more things so see that's the wise and foolish type wise wise virgin foolish version now look at this church oh my god the next slide here yeah check this out i should say check it out but this is amazing thought this blessed me yesterday i was telling my wife i was like i can't wait to preach this tomorrow church the gibby knights are a type of the gentiles being the tabernacle of god until the son of david came which was solomon right so god was having this is god having mercy on the gentiles if you study a history church gibeon became the resting place of the ark of god in the days of joshua all the way to the days of solomon so anytime david wanted to go consult at the ark you know we had to go to gibeon because that became the house of god that became the tabernacle of david until he brought it into jerusalem right so the gibeon became the house of god for 447 years that's where the ark stayed at this gentile city and god let those gentiles just stay there the whole time and god kept the ark there until and the bible said that god met solomon in gibeon solomon went to give he give me and said i want to build a house for you and and lord i want something from you and the lord said ask anything you want he said just give me wisdom and that's where god said i'm giving because you asked for wisdom and not long life and not your enemies and not money i'm giving you everything where did he do that at gibeon where the ark of god rested amen hallelujah the ark stayed there in the gentile city until the reign of the son of david and he brought it out and brought it to jerusalem what a beautiful picture of the ark of god with the gentiles until the time of the son of david i don't have that one in my book but that'd be a good one to put in there in the next revision now look god even protected them remember saul killed many gibeonites and later god gave israel three years of famine because saul touched the gibeonites because joshua swore by the name of the lord you'll not die three years of no rain because saul touched god's blessing god said joshua said you shall live that's thus saith the lord in the name of the lord you shall live and saul killed him so they got three years of famine for breaking thus saith the lord church god keeps his word and look god avenges his elect these are the foolish version type but god still avenges those gibby knights church they were hivites they were heathens but were granted mercy inside the kingdom of god for a space and time let's stand to our feet yeah i better stop right there musicians can come church i poured out my heart to you today i want you to know god loves you he is ready to pardon you delights in showing you mercy first i lean i need mercy just like you do he delights in it he he's not running away he's actually turned towards you if that's what it was under the blood of blows and goats what is it under the blood of christ the bible said he ever lives to bring you back into reconciliation oh that means you don't turn us back to us amen hey he's sitting on the throne making intercession for us now praise god satan says well he did that she did that he even if you haven't confessed that he said well he's there saying well she is going to confess it later today after that sermon from her home church she's going to confess it today so it's basically already forgiving devil because they accused you all night because you didn't confess one thing they confused you all night he's enough they're going to confess in a few minutes here just wait a little bit god is ready to forgive he's rich in mercy he's ready to pardon our iniquities through anything we've done he's ready to just throw it in the sea of forgetfulness where he'll remember it no more let's bow our heads for a moment here you play that song that reaches the highest mountain the blood it's the blood of christ it gives me strength you can stop the livestream here [Music]
