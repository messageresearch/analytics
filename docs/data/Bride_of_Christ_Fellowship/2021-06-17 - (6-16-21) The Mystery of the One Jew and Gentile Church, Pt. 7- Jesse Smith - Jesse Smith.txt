enemy comes in like a flood you'll raise up a standard against it lord god so we are encouraged by that we know it's prophecy for the future that you're going to raise up a holy ghost standard o god in our midst lord god so we thank you for that and may we do our part to bring that to pass tonight in jesus christ's name in the saint center amen praise god god bless you as you're standing let's get our bibles here we'll read a portion of text here from the scripture like to greet everybody in the name of the lord good to see the saints tonight god god bless you in the house of lord praise god uh let's go to philip i'm sorry ephesians chapter 3 if you would ephesians chapter 3 i'd like to continue on this thought on the mystery of the one church composed of both jew and gentile let's continue on that this is part seven and uh we'll look here in ephesians three verse five i do have a little uh we have some slides to show just a few ephesians three five we'll start with that trust everybody's had a good week in the lord and uh happy to be in the house of the lord tonight you know brother amen i was out yesterday morning about 6 a.m praying to the lord up behind my uh by my deck there and i looked out there and i i started singing that song the trees uh about the birds in the sky i heard the birds singing i said lord i want to lift my hands to you so i stood up there and i raised my hand i said i want to sing that church on wednesday but i didn't tell you i thought thank the lord he discerned my my spirit you know i just want to i want to do my part the birds are doing their part the trees are doing their part i want to do my part i want to sing and give praise to jesus christ so perhaps we'll sing that at the end again by god's grace thank god for his mercy and his grace ephesians chapter three let's look at uh verse four well you know let's go back to verse three it's been a few weeks since i minister on this i want to get back to this series here uh we're kind of taking some and i was of course studying on the name of god today i just have time to get it all together it's a tremendous subject uh so let's go back to this series here and then maybe lord willing sunday we'll look back at the name of god again verse 3 says how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery who do you make known the mystery to paul jesus christ made known this mystery to paul as i wrote before in few words verse 4 whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ and that's something all they had to do was just read this and god would show them the mystery that's all they had to do they just had to read this epistle have an open heart and then god would show them the revelation of the mystery what a privilege look at the power of reading look at the power of reading verse 5 which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit let's read verse six together ready one two three that the gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel amen let's go to isaiah 41 we'll read our memory verse for the month of june i may push this into july 2 brother amen if that's okay you know because we missed a few weeks there uh so i would like to maybe push it ahead such a beautiful verse here listen this is like the verse you want to hear every day don't be afraid right trust in the lord be strong and courageous isaiah 41 verse 10. pardon me let's read this together on three one two three fear thou not for i am with thee be not dismayed for i am thy god i will strengthen thee yea i will help thee yea i will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness how many can say amen to that i look george just can you leave that out there real quick before you're seated remember we looked on sunday night about i am i am not afraid right i am surrounded by god because he says i am with thee i am not dismayed i am a child of god i am strong because god's strengthening me i mean you can take all these and see what the i am has made you amen may god has blessing reading his word may be seated that's why that sermon is an unending sermon every promise in the bible is yours praise god is ours so if you would switch over here i just want to uh i'd like to just you know kind of background a little bit uh with this new book lord willing it should come out next month it was supposed to come out this month but we had a little delay the the gentleman who's formatting it uh it's he does two jobs kind of like me uh so uh he won't he didn't have time to get it all done but uh hopefully he'll come out next month but it's just an update on what i preach to you right now we're finishing up this one i got maybe a three maybe three or four more sermons on this one we're winning and then i probably preach the godhead next i'll shorten that up because that's a very familiar subject i just want to review though with you a few things because like i said on sunday every time brother branham mentions the mark of the beast he always mentions the mark in the forehead with trinitarianism notice it's in the forehead and brother in the church age book mentions trinitarianism and so denominations the way that uh the way the beast is going to deceive many people is by throwing out well if you're not trinitarian you don't get to buy and sell right that's going to be part of the deception to get them to join along with the image of the beast which is the world council of churches right so i just want to review that lord willing after we finish this one i want to review what the creeds actually say the creeds are full of contradictions right and i want to i want to just go over the last mystery the last mystery about the godhead is the use of plural pronouns like let us and jesus says the glory that we shared before the foundation of the world okay that's the only remaining mystery to me about the godhead and i just got an email on it today from somebody overseas so i i answered them right back because i've been thinking about it but uh i just kind of want to just i'll really shorten that one the lord willing uh of course we'll go over jesus baptism and we'll kind of go over those things a little shortly and uh seven stars that's the seven church ages that's really familiar i'll probably just hit the highlights on that one uh and then i've preached all 12 mysteries to you in their fullness and in the fullness of what's going to be in the book and uh so the next screen is what i've read through this week so this gentleman uh his name is james he edited my whole book he said this is the final draft he said read it one more time and so uh this week i've read 600 or 700 pages no 600 pages i've just been reading all the time reading reading reading trying to find am i writing out all the mistakes you know because there's different mistakes when you transition a document over to a different program so i've read through all the ones with checks i've right so right now i'm on chapter 10 11 12 and then i have to read 13 hopefully i'll get it done by saturday and then i can send it to him and say hey it's done buddy it's done and now he's hoping he's hoping this can be one book now which i would love that uh two would be fun you know or not fun but two would be very uh symbolic because the bread had two stacks two would be very uh symbolic but one would be easier because then you would just have it and brother william i don't know if i showed you this but here's the potential cover of it that's what it looks like the 12 new testament mysteries revealed so lord willing next month it should come out it was going to be two books but it might be one book now we'll see it kind of depends what the gentleman says now here's the thought behind this brother branham said in the services of the end time he says now the sounding fourth this messenger the seventh angel here signing forth his message notice the type of message it wasn't to the first angel it wasn't to the second third four fifth sixth but it's the seventh angel that had this type of message what is it he said notice this type of message finishing all the mysteries of god that are written in the book right now we know there's mysteries that are not in the book like jesus's new name right like the other new names and there's different there's different names the bible says you'll get a new name in the in the future home so there's some mysteries that are not written in the book right but all the mysteries that are in the book should be revealed at the end time okay brother ram says the seventh angel is winding up all the mysteries that's laying loose out ended out throughout these organizations denominations the seventh angel gathers him up and finishes the entire mystery that's what the bible said finishes the mysteries written in the book right now let's know a few of these mysteries if you want to write them down he said first i'll take what schofield says in matthew 13. if you'd like to take some of them down if you haven't got a scofield bible you might read what he thinks some of the mysteries are so then he reads scofield's list in your scofield bible he lists 11 of them but i went to the scripture and it's just my personal opinion and i looked up every time the word mysteries in the new testament 27 times so i just went through every time the bible said mystery and i found 12 of them are actually doctrines okay and that's where i got the 12 mysteries from so brother brahm says the seventh angel has to take all the mysteries that are in the bible and then finish them up he did and that's what i'm writing the book about praise god and it's a privilege to do it because i've never seen the bible tied together before like this and you know brother james browning before he passed away i preached a sermon at the church up there and he kind of joked with me a little bit i think i preached like two hours one time at the church and he said boy brother jesse said i really enjoyed your sermon you preached the whole bible today and i said thank you but i thought how fitting because here i'm tying the whole bible together with brother abraham's revelations because all the mysteries that are in the book have to be finished that's according to revelation 10 7. right all right so i just thought i'd rehearse that because i thought it would be a a little blessing there if you can see so that's what i do had to go through all these every time the bible used the word mystery all 27 of them and you have to see you have to you have to use the discernment of the holy spirit which one was a doctrine which one was just speaking of general mysteries right so that's what we've done by the grace of the lord so i'm going to uh detach this here you can get back to some scriptures here hope that was just i just want to review real quick here on that topic i think it's a really important topic um i know there's less and less people going to be saved so i'm not expecting a lot of people to read the book but i'm expecting all the predestinated to read the book that's what i'm expecting right so i trust the lord will grant that by his grace and by his mercy i'm excited and hopefully i can finish this week send it off to him and say there it is it's all done it's in your hands get it out get it get it there on amazon so it's ready to go all right so uh i'll just background you know briefly we've been looking at the mystery of the one church and i'm just gonna just quickly go through here this is part seven so the mystery of the one church is that the jew and gentile everyone that's born again is part of god's family and they're entitled to all the rights benefits and future inheritances this was a major issue in the bible days which we'll get to it's not a big issue now because we're westerners right we've lived in a a christian judeo-christian uh uh culture for over over 250 years right with united states so we're used to it where you say oh yeah anybody can be a christian now but before it was well only jews could be christians and then god had to give this revelation to paul to say no gentiles can be christians too and that's a great revelation this was all foretold by many prophets in the old testament even by god himself jesus though had to first offer the gospel to the jews once they rejected it god gave the keys to peter he opened the door of the holy ghost to jews samaritans and then gentiles praise god and then god save paul and god god say paul this man who hated gentiles god sent him to the gentiles as a great paradox praise god and and then paul gets his own dispensation which is a stewardship paul had a stewardship he had an overseeing job to make sure the true gospel got to the gentiles praise god as peter had to make sure the gospel got to the jews amen and then paul there's a moment paul started going to the jews but then he had to turn he said lo we turn to the gentiles so you know he made a turn in acts 13 and he started going to the gentiles but then we saw paul's gospel was the judgment standard on the day of pentecost every person i'll be judged brother william you'll be judged but amen we'll all be judged by paul's gospel praise god so i want to make sure that my life lines up with it right now praise god that there's no surprises right we know the bible says the secrets of hearts will be made known on that day but we shouldn't have any secrets we should have everything confess everything under the blood praise god because we're walking in the light as he is in the light and the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all unrighteousness so we should have no secrets all of our seekers should be confessed now anything in our heart we can just confess and then the bible says he'll forgive us of all unrighteousness amen but there'll be many secrets of people made known on that day people we wondered why they leave the message or uh do they they hung around the church but do they really believe well there'll be no secrets on that day they'll be all made known on that great screen in the sky right all the lives will be played back and all the answers during the our lifetime they'll be they'll be fulfilled right right and so we're we're looking forward uh in that time to sit with jesus so he can use our lives as a judgment standard so we're not being judged that will actually take place before the marriage supper right uh with the he'll pro he'll present you know uh christ i'm sorry brother abraham the messenger will present the people to christ as a chaste virgin paul said that paul will present his group and then irenaeus uh and martin and all the way down you know to brother brandon brother branham will present us as the bride to christ by god's grace and then we'll get rewards for what we've done praise god and then we'll have communion with the lord jesus praise god he'll drink of the cup anew amen he'll partake of the bread again amen amen and the bible said there he'll start wiping away tears from our eyes amen we'll weep and cry we made it over by the grace of god we didn't deserve it but god's grace was sufficient amen in my weakness his strength was perfect amen he made a way that i could be over here and have communion with him praise god amen and then you know uh after we see that we looked at paul he started teaching on this revelation out of uh the book of ephesians i'm sorry i'm sorry we looked at galatians first i'm sorry look at romans first then corinthians then galatians now we're in ephesians and uh and so now we're in ephesians three so let's go there we'll kind of pick up right there in chapter three i'm sorry chapter two rather paul gave two pictures of this jew gentile church he said they were like two men but now they're one man right he said christ is the head but the jew gentile are the one body so we need the jewish saints just like you need your right hand and your left hand right we need uh we need the uh we need the european saints just like we need the american saints right we need every every believer from every nation is a part of the body of christ but christ is the head he tells us all what to do and so he says out of twain he made one new man now we ended last time looking at this by the other imagery paul gave we're all one temple jesus christ is the chief cornerstone the apostles and prophets were the foundation stones here we find ourselves at the top of the pyramid amen hallelujah so here we are and we saw the type of it was solomon because solomon didn't build that temple just with jewish help he built it with gentile help jew and gentile work together to make a habitation for the spirit amen what a beautiful time amen of us god building a habitation in other words we are the temple of god that means god is here tonight amen we are the habitation of the holy ghost jew and gentile bonder free male or female right uh a freer bond you know wherever we find ourselves we are the body of christ we're the temple of jesus christ here tonight and we must all have a leading of the holy ghost i ended the sermon with that scripture first corinthians 14 26 point up there though because this is such an encouragement you know each person as i said uh each person needs to have anointing of the holy ghost for every service right now the bible said if i come unto you speaking with tongues i'm sorry 14 26 i'm sorry hon 14 26 my fault brother ram says and he talks about this in the church age book every person needs to be a partaker of the holy ghost and every person has a ministry of the holy ghost how is it then brethren when you come together every one of you have to solve so brother amen brought some psalms tonight so did his wife i heard her sing along real good they must have been practicing at home everybody has a doctor now that might be me tonight i might be bringing a doctrine to you a teaching right an instruction commandment everybody has a tongue we don't see that very much but that's okay we don't want to impersonate it we want the real thing when it comes and it has to be a gift from god we don't want to be impersonation because i know two friends that impersonated it and both have suffered uh suffered very much because of it the one friend he and his fiancee pretended to speak in tongues and within three years of their marriage she committed adultery on him left him and he was a he was a oneness pentecostal preacher and he fell from that because they pretended to speak in tongues then they never sought for the interpretations the other one i played football with a friend i had named greg and uh he told me this the night before we played a football game we're at a hotel together in michigan eastern michigan and we were talking about the word awesome instead talking about football we're talking about the word and he said i said he said have you ever spoken in tongues i said no sir i said i've asked god to let me but i've just never done it the bible said not all speak with tongues he said nor have i he's but then he started crying i said i said greg why are you crying he said because i was at a revival service and everybody was up seeking the holy ghost and they were a tongue's evidence church and the preacher uh put the microphone right in his face because he was an all-state football player he's like a famous high school athlete he said did you receive the holy ghost and he was nervous he was pressured into it so he said yes and the preacher said fine then speak in tongues and so he made it up right there he made up some unknown to and he was crying to me i said greg i said jesus loved you i said i just god will forgive you just say you're sorry can you imagine that impersonating a gift because all the pressure see i don't i want to stay a million miles away from that when it comes let it come genuine i'd rather have genuine than pretend amen we don't want to pressure anybody into anything we want the holy ghost to lead us into something amen lead us great shepherd amen hallelujah we don't want to push and force our way into it we want the holy ghost to lead us into it like humble obedient little lambs amen hallelujah now i do got to write though to compel people to come that means urge it even means pressure i've got to write as a preacher i'm pressuring you i'm urging you to come and be born again right but i don't urge for a gift or urge for the giver i don't know yeah that's right we urge for the giver praise god i tell them every time we do it right we tell them you may speak in tongues you may prophesy you may shout you may scream you may jump you may pass out but one thing you will do you will glorify god amen and you'll have an emotional experience that everybody can see or hear and we think you're drunk praise god that's right see everybody now where how did i get off of that see that everybody have the revelation you're all pulling up real hard i guess everybody hath the revelation unveiling everybody have an interpretation let all things be done in edifying so we ended that if we're a part of the body of christ we want to come to church where i got something to bring now church if we're discouraged and we're just coming to get uh renewed then praise the lord then come thirsty right it happens to me too and i gotta preach sometimes and that's me i'm the one that god helped me i've struggled i've been battled all week i need you to touch me tonight you know sometimes i come like that but sometimes i come all served up by the holy spirit i got a fresh revelation a fresh doctrine i want to bring from the holy spirit and i want to bring that praise god that's my part as the holy ghost-filled christian to help the body of christ amen amen so each one of us must have one of these leadings we'll call it a leading of the holy ghost now in ephesians 3 we read our texts now i'm just gonna go through a few uh points about ephesians three and then we're gonna get to the the next text because paul talks about this mystery uh here in ephesians three now in chapter 3 verse 15 he gives the revelation that the whole family in heaven and earth is named the lord jesus christ hallelujah the whole family is not father son holy ghost the whole family is the lord jesus christ the whole family ain't branham's the whole family is the lord jesus christ amen thank god we love the brahms we love the the reagans the smiths you put your name in there right the least we love everybody praise god but that's not the name of the whole family the whole family is messaged lord jesus christ amen that's the name above all names and so paul gives us revelation this body has one name right she's the the she's the bride of christ christ jesus and they share a name and then he ends chapter three by reminding us in verse 16 that he wants us strengthened with might in our inner man that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith rooted and grounded in love and then in verse 19 to know the love of christ so see uh paul wants the holy ghost filled jew or gentile to know how much god loves you he wants you to know the love of christ and that's one thing in the message we don't preach on a whole lot god loves you because that sounds too much like a denominational and it can be it can go overboard right they take it overboard but we cannot forget what the bible says paul says you need to understand what is the breadth the length the depth and the height of god's love are you picturing something big here if god's love could be measured in four dimensions it'd be great love for you and i praise god he said to know the love of christ and be filled with all the fullness of god see the only way we'll be filled with the fullness of god is to remember how much he loves us thank god he loves me amen he provides for he helps me he strengthens me he corrects me he fails me amen he leads me he guides me he loves me amen when you're convinced of god's great love you'll walk in the fullness of his power better that's what paul says see we leave that out sometimes that's why sometimes i listen to some of those mega preachers because i can glean i'm always listening to the message and it's hard and it's cutting but sometimes i just need encouraged right and a lot i mean that's just the nature of it right it's all many times many are cutting and things like that so sometimes i listen and i'll get encouraged i remember how much god loves me but really it's right in the bible there and paul's reminding us this body is love you are love if jesus if jesus was here he'd love his body right you love your body who took a shower today don't raise your hand who took a shower who brushed your teeth today before you come to church that shows how much you love love your body right love your family see and if you take care of your body jesus loves his body amen he takes so he said that's what he's reminding us you are loved you're a part of the family of god amen you're not outside the body you're a part of the body amen remember how much he loves you because he says in verse 20 it's the power of god working in us anything good out of our lives wasn't us it was the power of god in us amen that makes us happy that makes us rejoice because we can see we we finally got humble enough so god can use us remember he said humble yourself in the sight of the lord he'll lift you up see whenever something good happens you humble yourself so god can pick you up that little humble life that you have you lay yourself at the altar he lifts you up he uses you and then he sets you back down don't don't try to come up stay low just say hello so he can use you again right somebody gets healed when you pray for him that's god lifting you up right because he could use you he knew you went in glory to but then you got to go back got to stay back down there he can lift you up again let's be humble in the sight of the lord we'll see god's power in us amen now chapter i'm just gonna skip to the end we we know chapter four and five quite well uh with marriage and uh the fivefold ministry now look how he ends this uh book ephesians 6 18 honey if you can pull it up there ephesians 6 18. i've just been more amazed and and just the profound nature of this idea of the mystery of the jew and gentile church praying always now he's talking about the armor of god right when we have the armor of god we're praying so if we're not praying we've got to put on the armor got to put on the armor of god right praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto you with all perseverance and supplication for all saints and for me pray for me that utterance may be given unto me that i may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel paul said pray for me that i'll get a door open to reveal the mystery of the gospel for which i am an ambassador in bonds that's why he was in prison because he was preaching the revelation that jesus christ is the messiah for both jew and gentile praise god the jews i was just i'm finishing up acts the book of the book of acts i'm in acts 27 i think i'll do 28 tomorrow finish it up that's why he was in prison the jews hated him because he was saying your messiah is here the mystery the christ now that a messiah has come and the mystery of us he's not going to take over rome he's going to take over you hallelujah now eventually he'll take over the world systems but he wants to rule you they were looking for a natural ruler take over rome take over caesar and jesus said i want to rule you amen hallelujah because the kingdom of god is within us amen thank god amen that's why paul is in prison preaching the revelation of the mystery they hated it we love it that's why they call us holy rollers and they call satanists or whatever they want to call us but we love the revelation of jesus christ to them we're called heresy but uh but to us they're heretics right that's right verse 20 that there and i may speak boldly as i ought to speak so paul knew he best represented christ and the mystery of god when he spoke boldly amen okay now moving on let's go to colossians i'm just going to hit a few verses in colossians now colossians uh is a city about a hundred miles east of ephesus paul went there after he went to ephesus right uh the church actually started through epiphanes epiphyses was a prayer war you remember paul said he's always labor and prayer for you he was a real prayer warrior god used him as a missionary epiphys i've always liked to name a child i profess them i always joke around with my wife okay would that be a beautiful name maybe one of my grandchildren at the lord teresa i just love that name just because of who prayer warrior that started the church of colosse uh now this book is best known for being the most complete expression of the godhead right talks about the he's the image of the invisible god right brother random preached two sermons and this was his text christ is the mystery of god revealed and the unveiling of god that's what he talks about in morphe right how christ changes mass he changes form god always changing his mask right so you know in chapter one he says the mystery of christ in you the hope of glory praise god now that's a mystery we've already preached i've spent a lot of time on that the baptism holy ghost uh we made there's a few things i didn't get to remember i kind of left off on the soul do you remember when i was working with a soul a while ago and i was really getting into some new things for me on the soul hopefully for youtube i kind of stopped there and went to the next one but there was actually more i needed to preach on that but uh we'll see what the lord does but just go ahead to chapter 3 verse 10 colossians 3 verse 10. just you'll you'll start see here where he starts laying in how the new man treats everybody with love now this is related to the jew gentile church okay colossians 3 verse 10. and i'm gonna maybe read it out of my bible here and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him so see are you in the image of christ that's what you should be when you put on the new man you put it on christ right where there is neither greek nor jew okay so there's neither jew nor gentile circumcision or uncircumcision barbarian scothian skythian bond or free but christ is all and in all wow christ can be enslaved yes christ can be in the free yes christ can be in the gentile christ can mean the jew he says christ is all and in all put on therefore as the elect of god holy and beloved biles i'm sorry bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of mind meekness long-suffering forbearing one another and forgiving one another if any man have a quarrel against any even as christ forgave you so also do ye now i wonder how many people really do that how many people forgive their their their friends and their church members and their family like christ forgives them christ does it instantly right you say jesus forgive me you're forgiven right but someone does us wrong i gotta think about it for a few weeks i ain't gonna text them back today you're right i'm gonna call them back today they're gonna talk to me tomorrow maybe next week you see the the new man when you're a part of this body you aim to be just like christ and so jews would have had a hard time with that so were the gentiles right because gentiles were always mistreated by jews right if the jews would walk by a samaritan and go walk on the other side of the street what would they do to a jew i'm sorry a gentile rather they would do the same thing right they would not they want nothing with a samaritan they don't want nothing with a gentile so there was hurt feelings on both sides but somebody who's got the new man someone who's manifesting christ someone who's in the image of christ who's put on the image of christ will forbear with them love them treat them just the same as their own family members praise god because they're in a new family hallelujah verse 14 and above all these things put on competition did i read that right no don't compete against your friends put on charity see which is the bond of perfectness so charity is like the glue that makes us complete right love makes us feel like one body one family praise god it makes us feel like everything's good here you know some people struggle i fee i don't feel like my church feels like home and and you know some people may feel that well the thing to do is fall in love with everybody because love is the bond of perfectness why don't you love people are you trying to love them right i know it's hard to love some people it's probably hard to love me right we can all be hard to love at times but we have to take on with to put on christ amen don't put on the world put on christ amen then you're easy love because christ forgave me last night this morning with my mistake or yesterday christ forgave me easily i can easily forgive you because i'm close with christ how many churches you know act like that that's a challenge it's a challenge verse 15 let the peace of god rule in your hearts see let god's peace rule your hearts peace to which also you are called in one body and be thankful all right so i think i'll stop right there for a moment so see paul addresses the same id he has to write to the ephesians and if you know your bible the colossians letter is very familiar or very similar to the ephesian letter it's just a little shorter he doesn't hit everything but this one is especially known for the godhead revelation but he he he repeats this to the saints in colosse he said you can't treat people differently you've got to treat everybody the same and by the way we gave some examples a few weeks ago in message churches most people i'm sorry in message churches there's a problem sometimes with the rich people mistreating the poor james talked about that in james chapter two right they'll see a rich guy coming oh you sit right here you richmond and i'm gonna make sure i pass the basket right to you got an offering today [Laughter] a bunch of hypocrites right and the poor guy that just walked by him he don't have no money now that that would be a common example of discrimination in messed churches or any church now for me let me be honest for me sometimes it's hard i think it may be for other people too if people come to church and they're they haven't brushed their teeth or they haven't done their hair right just for me as a i look and i look at people's faces sometimes i think um i hope they don't like spit on me or something like that you know you know and so that's just me you know every day i go to school so i have to brush you look like a looked like i took care of myself you know but you know that's just honesty you know um and so we have to make sure the love of christ shines through any fears right so money physical appearance uh right maybe uh the physical attraction and people they're just me or even their youth the youth oh it's easier to talk to young people because i'm young or something like that i like talking to old people there's people that are like that they don't want to talk to old people right we've had people leave this church because we were too young and they wanted to fellowship with older people we love them i still love them but that's why they left now church the word the reason wasn't the word it was the fellowship they loved the word but they just didn't feel like they fit in well there's a there's a solution that it's called the glue of love love will keep you glued together right and i'm not telling you you have to you know stay at one church you go wherever the lord leads you but if god calls you to a church there's always going to be struggles just like with them they had struggles jew and gentile man this guy ate pork i've been on a kosher diet my whole life i'm supposed to eat with this guy that was a problem but the love of god should bring them together and they can sit down at the same table or at least hug write your handshake or something like that instead of saying i i'm not going to sit with you this is a great mystery paul said but it was revealed to him by jesus christ don't discriminate against people because of their diet because their skin color their age their mind their financial status if christ is in you christ loves all he's in all and he loves all praise god how many know churches that could use some preaching like that sure every church could i could we all we all could but see that's why this revelation is so important people just gloss right over oh we too many mysteries too many mysteries well you haven't even received the revelation of how to treat somebody because you favor rich people or you favor sisters or you favor brothers or you favor preachers you just talk to the preachers if a guy's not a preacher you won't talk to him see they haven't even got the revelation of this mystery yet that christ doesn't look at all those things there's neither bond nor free jew nor greek preacher or not preacher song leader or not song leader right it's none of that it's all love because love conquers all things amen love cast out all fear amen amen oh we don't need the mysteries well you surely could if you're discriminating against poor people you surely could use this revelation oh i love the word of god don't you these are things that people see if they don't humble themselves and dig deeper in the word they'll never see these things right you gotta we actually have to preach what paul preached right yeah right we're resting on what paul preached right we're all resting on that we're all shouting we're resting on what paul preached right well he preached it so why are more message churches doing it well they maybe it's not the time for yet or maybe they're ignoring the word of god let it not uh we pray it's not that last one we pray it's not that one now colossians 4 let's see how the book ends colossians 4. just a beautiful book he echoes the same prayer now look at that praying god please give me a chance to share the mystery with someone that's why i wrote the book brother william it took me 26 months to write that book and now all these other months i'm trying to edit that book but you know why i'm doing it because people need to know the mystery just like you edit all those magazines that's right that's awesome see because you had a burden you wanted to see somebody be blessed right you want to see someone else receive the same revelation you did you're not content with you having the knowledge of god you want to share it with somebody else praise god that they can experience the same christ that you love amen colossians 4 2 continue in prayer watching the same with thanksgiving see be thankful all the time be thankful don't be down the gutters don't be discontent be thankful if god wanted me to have that i'd be there right if i if god wanted me to have that i'd have that because i asked for it and he he hears all my prayers hallelujah so i'm content because he didn't answer yet not saying he won't answer but i'm content waiting because i asked the strong one and the strong one's not weak like me right i asked elohim right i asked he's the strong one praise god and he can do anything amen he's the self-existent one praise god he can do all things so i can be happy i can be thankful because i know the strong one has everything in control verse 3 with all praying also for us that god would open unto us a door of utterance to speak the mystery of christ of which i am also in bonds see the the revelation didn't make him more popular brother william oh god help me amen these revelations actually make you less popular when did brother ram become the least popular at the end when he get all the revelations at the end hallelujah i'm gonna get more popular no i'm probably getting more uh talked about and rejected after writing this book but it doesn't matter because paul said just pray that we have a chance to share it with the predestined amen pray for open door to share the revelation that i may speak make it manifest as i ought to speak see god just give me a chance just give me five minutes right how many minutes do you think you need to share the message one lord just give me one minute so i can be bold and just share god has sent a prophet he's finished the mystery of god the main mystery is that christ live in you the baptism of the holy ghost and then you're ready for the rapture the oil of the holy ghost is your ticket to the rapture amen well how much was that was that 30 seconds let's go back in time that no we're not going to time that but listen that's what he's saying give me an open door to share this mystery i'm in jail because of this mystery i'm rejected because of this mystery but pray that i'll be able to share it with somebody amen and we know he did i don't know if brother william remembers that we preached on it in philippians paul said everyone in that prison knew about christ because he was in prison so sometimes god may send us on a dark path but that's so everybody there where we go can hear the gospel of christ right right he may send us a place i don't like this place this wasn't my choice i didn't ask for this jesus asked for it and you're just the person he needs in that tough situation to tell everybody about jesus amen that's what paul said amen everybody there got to hear the revelation because one man became a prisoner of christ now let's look at some of the challenges here now the next section of this chapter is called blessings and challengings or challenges transitioning to one body it was not easy to transition from two separate bodies jew gentile or actually three samaritan now samaritans now if you ever study samaritan's church samaritans were the people that uh some of them were jews poor jews left over after nebuchad after nebuchadnezzar and assyria took all the jews out of the promised land they left the poorest jews there well the bible says in ii kings though there were so few people there wasn't enough people there left of the poor jews so the king of assyria set babylonians there so they could take care of the land and that mixture of babel assyrians babylonians and jews became the samaritans so they were half have gentiles because they just married between because there was nobody else to marry i mean are you gonna marry if you're poor and there's nobody else there you've got to marry somebody yeah and then and then they just kept the torah they didn't keep the prophets so they didn't they didn't want to hear about elijah they didn't want to hear about any of those they want to hear about jeremiah they just only kept the torah and they had jacob's well which they thought was a holy place to be and they didn't worship at jerusalem they didn't want to go down to jerusalem that's why the woman at the well she said well we're you know she let jacob's well right she said well we we believe our fathers you know and jesus is like i'm gonna give you water you don't know about right are you thirsty woman i'm gonna give you water you don't know about right it doesn't matter the well it doesn't matter where you worship right but jesus even said the jews worship we know what we worship for salvation is of the jews right so that's where the samaritans come from but so that was like but they hated each other samaritans hated jews jews hated samaritans you know samaritans couldn't even go to court and testify against a jew kind of reminds us of the discrimination in our uh nation years ago women couldn't go in court black people couldn't go to court right because it was such an evil spirit of discrimination right thank god that there's been progress thank god for that all the prayers of those saints yeah we saw yeah we were at gettysburg and we saw uh how many of those people said god is for this war to free the people from slavery god was in that war god held that those confederate soldiers back there at gettysburg amen they came out as they those confederate soldiers from the south they came out a mile wide to try to take the final hill what was it called uh that last charge remember what it's called pickett's charge that that southern army he brought all the soldiers it was i think it was like six thousand or twelve thousand soldiers they just they just formed one line and they started marching up that final hill to take over gettysburg and it's it's as if the angel of the lord just helped them just mow them down and that was the turning point for the north they'd been losing losing losing it looked like the slaves was going to continue but then god gave them the victory because they said god is behind this battle amen they were trusting the bat the battle belongs to the lord amen hallelujah abraham lincoln many times prayed for god to give them the victory and they got the victory so there's another discrimination god always destroys that we just got to give time for it praise god but there was challenges going from jew holy kosher diet you know separation and gentile none of that right so there was challenges now i found a couple of them that were pretty uh uh familiar but i just want to go over them here uh go to galatians we'll go back to galatians 2 if you would let's go back there just a familiar one now what's interesting in galatians chapter two this was difficult transitioning how many knows difficult if you've been raised one way your whole life it's difficult to change it when you get older right you've always been taught this don't talk to samaritan don't talk to jew right don't talk to gentiles don't don't even look at him on the street you if you see them go to the other side of the street your whole life you're taught that and then all of a sudden yeah you can go right up and hug them what what if they what if they're defiled and i'm going to go out have to go get the waters of separation you don't really have to do that anymore well i mean that's about my whole life i mean this is just mind-blowing so there was problems transitioning over to their man-made well not man-made but their their law-based life into this this word of grace can i say it like that aren't you glad we're in grace amen i've said that many times you know i'm so glad i'm not under the law because if you come upon a dead body you got to get sprinkled on the third day seventh day you can't go to church for those so those seven days are over i would be really sad missing church right or you get defiled somehow and you can't go to church oh my that'd be i'd be one sad little puppy there but it was very difficult so peter was a man who walked on water he was a man who had the holy ghost he saw three thousand can you imagine that three thousand converts from one sermon i've seen maybe my first time i preaching god and we had maybe 10 or 12 people get baptized after one sermon i preached they just came one after another and it was all out of the holy ghost but now it was such of the holy ghost i got up i was preaching right by a beach and the holy spirit just came upon me and i said if god doesn't back up this sermon then i'm a false prie and then i'm a false preacher and i didn't even realize what i brother william i don't even know what i was saying and then i said and i said if you love jesus christ you ought to run down to that river at the end those guys run down there i baptize every one of them it was totally totally supernatural i didn't even know what i was saying like i never ever issued a challenge like that before like if god doesn't back the sermon up then i'm a false preacher that it was just it was just god but that's a kind of a uh that's a kind of a desire that we like to see praise god right that's revival time but peter had 3 000 of those and then peter saw the vision three times that sheet come down rise kill and eat no so no sir rice couldn't eat no lord rise could he no lord and then look how stubborn he was the lord told him it's okay those are red letter words you ever look at your bible those are red letter words the same jesus he walked with all those years he's like no no jesus no no can you imagine that that's how ingrained some of our childhood memories are but jesus christ can change our hearts amen amen it's hard for you to you know treat people a certain way jesus can change you it's going to take some time but he can do it he can do it we just got to be open to being changed the same man that saw the holy ghost there in galatians chapter 2 he refuses to eat with gentile i'm sorry yeah with gentiles in verse 11 he paul was stood into the face he was to be blamed that word means condemned not eternally but temporarily right in other words when we sin we should feel the condemnation in our hearts right so uh verse 12 for before that certain came from james he did eat with the gentiles when they were come he withdrew and separated himself fearing them which were of the circumcision and the other jews dissembled likewise with them in so much barnabas also was carried away with their dissimilation can you imagine that the very man who saw the holy ghost fall on cornelius is now he's so afraid of these jewish preachers do you realize there's a lot of pressure with preachers you realize that i'm sure brother knows that like you really want the preachers to like you right and you really want to fit in and you you don't want to feel like you know you're you're against the preachers well peter fell under this spirit of fear that's right god has not given us a spirit of fear but peter was born again right in here but this is where he had the spirit of fear right here oh if i eat with them the preachers are going to this fellowship with me they're going to say i'm backslidden who knows what he thought right so he's like barnabas hey come on don't sit with brother jesse you know he's just he jumped out come sit over here and all the jews did that so when you went to the church fellowship the jews were sitting way far from the gentiles how come you guys ain't fellowshipping what's going on see sir sometimes there's keys to problems if we just look at how people fellowship right you can tell many times what did this the spirit of fear fear separated the brethren love was going to glue them back together now what did it take it took a prophet brother said a hook knows jew to come up and put his finger under peter's face and said you're the guilty one everybody's following you peter man with the keys everybody's following you and you're leading them the wrong way he said god forgive me i'll fellowship with the gentiles again isn't that something this was a difficult transition god had to send somebody who didn't know as much as peter right as far as jesus didn't know jesus you know in the flesh but paul said we don't know him after the flesh anymore we know him after the spirit praise god so peter knew i'm sorry paul knew him just as well as peter amen because he knew him by the holy ghost praise god he said you're the one that should be condemned you should feel guilty you should feel convicted peter because you're not eating with the gentiles for us to be oh you're not eating with the poor brothers you're just eating with the rich people or you're only eating with your family you're not eating with any of the other saints or you just want to eat with the preachers you don't want to eat with anybody else in the church see how see how that spirit of fear just gets in with people what are they going to think of me who cares what they think of you what matters is what jesus thinks of you i don't care what you think of me i mean i do it one way i want you to think i'm a christian but really when it comes down to it i want jesus to think good to me praise god that's what i'm really trying to please tonight um let's remind me of scripture i wasn't planning on saying this can't quite remember the got your bibles yeah go yeah first corinthians yeah first corinthians 4 9. sorry i just want to look this scripture up church because listen you and i whether you know it or not we're on a stage tonight when you go home tonight really you're on a stage you are performing all the spirits are watching you including the holy spirit for i think that god has set forth us the apostles last as it were appointed in death for we are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men that word spectacle if you look it up is a theater how many you like being on stage you like being on stage brother [Laughter] you like being yeah let's see how he come up there i remember i told him i said i said brother think about what you want to say he's like he just got right up and he's i'm ready to talk i like that i don't think i could have done that but i like that but see church we have to realize this is where satan got peter the devil's the holy ghost was there too but the devils are watching peter and they whisper in his ear don't eat with those gentiles and pretty soon he's like yeah i i might lose fellowship i might lose ties or offerings or something i might lose my reputation right that's what preachers feared today that's why i'm glad i got my own job i don't have to worry about that that's why i think a lot of preachers backslide the message because they're scared about losing ties so i'm thankful i'm thankful god made a smile to protect us but look at that the bible says devils and angels holy angels are watching thank god holy angels are watching too but see we always have to remember that we're on stage tonight see we're a spectacle to men the world and angels always remember that wherever you go there's angels watching you amen good and bad but thank god the good ones are there praise god always remember that so see the angels caught peter a time when he was weak he said don't eat with them you're better than them you said yeah you're right i don't think i can eat with that so the angels see remember say brother says satan studies you right that's what it is and they watch where we're weak peter was a little weak with the gentiles i mean rightfully so right his whole life he was raised not to like not like samaritans not like gento that's how he was raised church sometimes we're raised with things ingrained into us and we don't even realize it right can i share this it's ingrained in me to like cigarette smoke whenever i smell cigarette smoke i want to my flesh wants to go smoke it's been ingrained into me my dad used to act real cool like smoking and my friends and i when we were sinners we used to do that we used to act it was fun to us i always wanted to be like my dad my dad smoked all that so when i was a sinner i liked it i like doing that i like to go off and smoke like that my flesh every time i smell it wants to have one but for all these years i've turned him down but you better believe devils are there behind me whispering oh you can just go buy one you're a grown man now i say well shut up i'm a holy vessel now i'll say this my body is not mine it's jesus's man and i'm not going to put cancer causing agents in my body but see i'm going to i'm going sp i'm on a stage and they're watching me trying to see any weaknesses i had built into me as a young boy they're watching just waiting for a moment for some of us it's too much joking for some of us is too serious some of us were too judgmental right some of us were just too fearful some of us were too prideful i think we know everything we deserve everything we're the best no you're not but see we're on a we're on a we're on a theater we're on a stage and the angels are trying to find the next way to try to bring us down the bible calls it snare they're setting a trap so you can walk right into it so see i just thought i brought that scripture i didn't really plan on saying that but it just kind of came to my heart see we have to be careful who we influence look how peter influenced barnabas a holy ghostville preacher who'd been rescued out of jail by praying at midnight he'd seen the earthquakes look at that church see that's why miracles miracles won't save you right miracles won't keep you holy all the time and yet there'll be a blessing on the short term it's faith that saves you praise god you praise god right it's submission to the will of god but it's it's having the submissive obedient heart it's like jesus to say it is written satan get behind me satan and what happened that's what i like if you stay on the stage long enough and rebuke satan the devils go away for a while amen then you can just be happy there's nothing going you feel great you feel blessed you feel protected like there's a hedge about you yeah sometimes god takes away the hedge and there's great challenges all right let me try to bring this down in just a moment here so that was a a difficulty transitioning to one body well all these preachers are gonna think um this or that all these sisters all my friends are gonna think this or that we can't be hypocrites we gotta be honest right and if we're wrong we gotta admit we're wrong and say we're sorry like peter did it's believed he repented and they had the fellowship as it did before and god used the prophet to do it circumcision was another issue remember in acts 15 we're not going to go there but in acts 15 paul comes back he says they got the holy ghost in in uh at christ's house and the bible said they contended with him they argued no the holy ghost doesn't fall on gentiles and so peter said who was i that i could withstand god because the holy ghost fell on them in cornelius house the same way it did on us at the beginning and the bible said it pleased all the multitude they acted they they rejoiced in jesus christ they spoke in tongues they prophesied they shouted they they praised jesus christ well then praise god god's given the holy ghost to the gentiles amen that's all it took see somebody with the holy ghost gets really happy when other people get the holy ghost they rejoice in an amen they acted the same what they they act the same way i do in church praise god thank god for sending us another holy ghost-filled saint amen that's what i'm praying for for mj i was praying for him this week i said lord fill him with the holy ghost church he's already justified for sure and he's partly sanctified because god delivered him from homosexuality right he's more sanctified than maybe we we'd think so let's pray for him that he gets the holy ghost then we don't have to worry about him right once you get the holy ghost you're sealed to the day of redemption you're gonna fight you're gonna battle but you're in the promised land hallelujah and you are more than a conqueror in christ jesus amen hallelujah you'll be a victor when you're born again that's the great difference between sanification being born again born again constant battles but constant victory [Laughter] praise god when you're born again it's just battle after battle but at the same time it's victory after victory praise god amen but you're out in the wilderness like i said you're out there in your tent oh yeah i'll get my honey toast today or honey bread okay back to the tent just relaxing you know i'll just try not to get too hot out in the sun out here in the wilderness you know oh go get my food oh that that sanctification right what is this oh it's nice and easy bread nice and easy life out here just kind of temporary life just hanging out here but when you're in the promised land it's battle after battle but it's also victory after victory it's communion with the captain of the lord's hosts amen it's following joshua amen jehovah's our salvation hallelujah from victory to victory from glory to glory amen hallelujah yeah i'd rather have the harder life but it's also a more victorious life i remember what it was like to be in denomination i remember that that was an awful thing in sanctification that was no fun that was no fun i was a slave to many things i was i had no permanent home i didn't know where i was going but no i know i know exactly where i am amen i'm in christ i'm a new creature i'm a child of god i'm filled with the fullness of god's love and i know the love of christ the height the breadth the length the width of christ's love he loves me and i don't want to love him amen i love him more than i did yesterday praise god oh my thank god but they were saying they got to be circumcised i'm sorry that was acts 11 right that's actually where peter said that in acts 15 yeah so forgive me i got my scriptures mixed up acts 11 they all say praise god they got the holy ghost but acts 15 they were saying oh you got to be circumcised to be saved you got to be just like us or you're not saved the bible said paul and barnabas didn't listen to that for one hour in other words it would have been our day and you said brother jesse let me show you this false doctrine they wouldn't hit stop right away that's from the devil don't show me that i'm not even listening that one hour don't try to bring that legalism here in the church we're free in christ in here hallelujah there's one way we're saved in here that's by the blood amen the blood of jesus christ not by a man made a tradition a legalistic way we're saved by the blood the blood keeps us safe and the blood directs us into every good work amen hallelujah don't have none of your false doctrine well you got to come to my church to be safer you got to believe this about the tapes to be saved you got to believe that jesus christ died for your sins raised for your justification he became your sin that you might be made his righteousness amen that's how you get saved amen not saying i worship brother branham i follow everything in jeffersonville that's not how you get saved that's how you get lost praise god or backslid that's how you do that but you get saved by the blood of jesus christ amen faith in the blood amen that's how you're saved hallelujah they say no you've got to be circumcised you got to follow the old ways of the old prophet you got to follow the ways of prophet moses well he's a great prophet but there's a new prophet amen his name is jesus christ right and they everybody gave their point and then james said or amos said that i would raise up a people call by my name he and james said this old saint before he was remember he was slaughtered remember he was slaughtered by herod this was one of his great revelations before he died he said let the gentiles not be troubled let's not force them to be circumcised let's just give them four guidelines in other words until paul gives them the whole counsel of god these letters all these letters hadn't been written yet see she said let's just give them four to kind of just get get them get their bodies in order be sanctified and stay clean before god he said then the rest will come later when paul starts writing these these letters hallelujah when he gets in prison my goodness abstain from idols abstain from fornication abstain from things strangled and ex abstained from eating blood see those are the four things james just said so this was a this was a battle right they had to have a council they had to call the preachers together and say what's going to happen what's going to happen should what should we tell the gentiles it was hard to transition give them four rules who says oh the bible's not about rules he just gave him four rules right there that was god's love to them right that was god's love rules are protection rules are borders rules are like a wall right rules are like a fence it protects you it makes you feel good praise god amen it makes you it helps you to know you've met god's requirements amen hallelujah oh these people my goodness so they rejoice the bible said the gentiles rejoice the last one i'll close with this the last example so there's two examples peter not wanting to eat with gentiles you know discrimination segregation right in the church of living god in the church of the living god segregation we've all seen it haven't we i've seen brother william i've seen it where the the rich people the nice-looking people won't go eat with message people if they're a little overweight if their teeth aren't straight if they're a little older i've seen that at different church fellowships not here but other churches and i'm like what in the world so i go up and talk to the people that you know they don't look really maybe presentable or something like that because i i know the scripture i'm like oh jesus or james said when you see somebody he said condescend to men of lower degree so in other words humble yourself and go talk to the people that don't have anybody talk to you because i know how those rich people are brother william uh they're gonna try to influence you because you know or they know that you know they've got money they're going to try to influence you to do what they want to do because they've got the big bucks it's always that way usually usually the richest people are the ones trying to persuade people you should do this and i don't know about that just try this i don't care what you say i care what the word says praise god but they had to battle that spirit look at that they did about that that segregation right there in the early church but they overcame it by god's grace by correction from the holy spirit so that was the first one second one what do the gentiles do what laws do they keep he said give them four they gotta have something do they get circumcised or not they have to be circumcised to be saved no just do these four things trust in christ and the last one i think is is worthy i put in the book it's worthy of an individ individual mention it was paul's circumcision of timothy this was an issue okay now if you know the scripture paul told titus not to be circumcised right that was in galatians 2 3 and five but then paul went and circumcised timothy himself this is a difficult transition because now it's surgery time brothers right this is quite a transition are you a surgery or not you know this is quite a quite a change paul and that's why paul could call timothy his son i mean honestly right that's part of it no not only gospel but even the physical aspect of it so see there was different reasons why right there's different reasons so galatians two let's go to writing galatians two three and four but neither titus who is with me being a greek was compelled to be circumcised because of the false brethren unawares brought in who came in privately to spout our liberty which we have in christ jesus that they might bring us into bondage to whom we gave place by subjection no not for an hour that the truth of the gospel might continue with you okay so look at this church satan set in wolves into the church and their whole purpose was to secretly come in and try to uh convince them to get circumcised so you've got to be careful when new people come like we've had new people come i'm very i've told my wife we got to be very careful with new people coming no not you bro i'm talking about somebody else we know you you're you're a real saint we love you you gotta what you have to watch everybody you know as a pe he knows as a pastor and you know he's been around church a long time you always got to watch the new people come here in other words you just don't trust them right away right you got to watch them they have to earn trust but here satan sends them in and the purpose is to spy out and steal their liberty in christ so satan will do that he sees how we're happy here right now he sees how he's singing joy in the house of the lord how the girls shout and we talk about that we have such liberty here i can dance around and praise the lord shout hallelujah thank you jesus there's just so much liberty here but satan wants to poison somebody and send him in just to steal our liberty because then if we just lose that then we'll start losing other things too don't get i'm sure i'm sure of it i'm sure but amen loves when people raise their hands during songs but satan would love to steal the liberty of people i'm not going to raise my hands because i'm not going to shout or scream because i'm kind of embarrassed don't be embarrassed if jesus tells you to clap clap for jesus praise god that's the liberty of the holy spirit but satan said i'm going to send people in there just to break their liberty and make them legalists but paul said i'm not having that for one hour i'm not gonna listen to that he said get out of the church oh no no titus needs to be circumcised and he needs to be like the rest of us he said get out of the church you devil right get out of the church are you unclean devil get out and so he kicked him out he said you don't have to be circumcised titus remember then he wrote titus he said he said you meet the qualifications you ordain elders in every church even though you're uncircumcised you can ordain elders because this is a new church amen this is a new body praise god this is based upon the hard circumcision amen so he says no titus is not going to be circumcised but then timothy does get circumcised what's the difference the difference is there was pressure on titus to do it from the devil just throughout their liberty timothy did it out of the freedom and the hope to save souls totally different motivations right if you're pressured by fear into something that's the devil but if you make a choice out of liberty to make a sacrifice to win souls then we call that holiness the other one is legalism the other one's liberty i've got the liberty i can make a choice i can be more consecrated so someone can get saved that's true paul showed timothy was not under any pressure he was half jew half greek his father didn't permit to be circumcised as a baby because he was he was greek but yet his mom and grandma diligently taught him the jewish uh revelation right and paul said i see you got the same faith as mom and grandma not dead see sometimes our dads won't walk in it but we can praise god amen thank god amen hallelujah because i'm walking after my heavenly father right now praise god i'm trying to be like him thank god amen i see faith in you like your heavenly father and then like your teachers your grandmother your mother there was three reasons he voluntarily chose it nobody forced him first reason he wanted to honor his judaic upbringing he wanted to honor that because he'd been taught his whole life second he didn't want to offend the jews he was associated with they didn't ask him this wasn't satan like the other time the other one satan's trying to pressure them to take away their liberty here he just had a burden i just want to make my brothers feel more comfortable oh my goodness i just want to make sure everybody at church feels welcome i don't want there to be anything to hinder the holy ghost movement in the church that's how i feel praise god let nothing hinder the move of the holy spirit that people can be saved encouraged filled with the holy ghost operate gifts grow to love christ more be filled with all his fullness we don't want people stiff and starchy and no liberty and under fear and pressure all the time we want people free in the holy spirit to weep cry shout prophesy worship god love god give a word of wisdom give a word of knowledge you know whatever you feel like pray for the sick praise god and thirdly he believed his circumcision would cause some jews to listen to him preach the gospel that was in acts 16 3. him would paul have to go forth with him and took and circumcised him because of the jews which were in those quarters for they all knew that his father was a greek as paul's travel companion timothy was in constant contact with jews and look church he just thought if i can influence them somehow to the gospel of christ i'll do it huh i wonder where he got that idea from where would he get the i where would timothy get the idea from i need to become all things to all men that i might win some some church we're not going to win everybody but if we can win some we'll achieve what jesus wanted us to achieve we want to win somebody to christ i'm so glad when i preached both of you just come in you're you're our sub right there there are some remember that old church over there you guys came up and cried and wept your way to the cross ah i'm so glad we can win some amen can't win all you can win some he says i become all things to all men that by all means i might save son where did timothy get that idea well if i'm circumcised someone actually might listen to me and i could share the message he got that from paul his father in the gospel let's stand to our feet all that to say possibly just one song one or two souls first how willing how far are we willing to go to save a soul you can stop the livestream now i just want to share this one more thought here musicians can come
