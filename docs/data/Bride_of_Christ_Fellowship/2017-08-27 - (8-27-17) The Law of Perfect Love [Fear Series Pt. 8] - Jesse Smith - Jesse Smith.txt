Lord of All Saints we see the Saints this morning I've increased the Lord first John 4:17 to preach on the law of perfect love this for this is part 10 in our fear series the law of perfect love first John 4:17 1st John 4:17 isn't the Lord wonderful praise God isn't he worthy of all your praise hallelujah it's worthy to be a living sacrifice what a great faithful God we serve this morning verse John 4:17 verse 17 says herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the Day of Judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us if a man say I love God or I believe the message and hated this brother he's the liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he has seen how can he love God whom he hath not seen and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth God love his brother also amen how many appreciate the Lord's word that's that word of Prayer if we have a need on your heart just making on into God as we approach his holy throne have any father we approach your throne Lord I was reading yesterday Lord in revelation 5 and reminded again of the seven lamps around your throne the seven spirits of God also 24 elders wearing crowns also four beasts with six wings that fly and cry holy holy is the Lord God Almighty which was and isn't is to come and on top of that innumerable company of angels all round about the throne we also know there's Devils that come and accuse us before the throne of God day and night the Bible said Lord our love for you constrains us Lord God to believe that Christ Jesus as our high priest is able to make intercession for us this morning father you know the needs on the people's hearts Lord I don't know all needs Lord God surely as a pastor I know certain things Lord God when people share them with me and Lord I'll burden for those and we pray for those but lord I just pray you to meet all the needs Lord God may you speak Lord to us from thy throne Lord God that has always been your plan to have a fivefold ministry that would bring the people to perfection Lord God to bring us to a unity of faith Lord God under the stature of the fullness of Christ Lord bring your people to this place Lord I know you will not Jesus I know you will for you promised and your word is is unfailing as you are Lord God it's as alive as you are Lord God so let your eternal words speak to us this morning father help me to yield to thy spirit in Jesus Christ lovely name the church said Amen god bless she was being seated there praise the Lord Malak I do have some quotes so we can bring up the slide here but I like to look at the law of perfect love this morning grace of the Lord and have some quotes for you I have all the quotes up here except the end the last thought I want to bring in I want to I want to end with the law of perfect love so I want to just bring a little review and then I want to take some time on the law perfect love so I don't have those quotes for you so you just have to listen to me at the end by God's grace I don't have any of those who didn't have time to get those ready by the grace of the Lord but let's look remember the effects of fear fear proves you don't believe if we have fear so we might believe other promises of God but if there's a certain promise we were having trouble or not not believing it because we're afraid of something that proves we don't believe that promise in particular how many wanna believe all the promises of God you've proud you've believed the promise to be baptized in the Lord Jesus Christ's name and thank God for that we're very grateful for that but there's more promises than just acts 2:38 we know there's more promises that's an important promise the Prophet said that was probably the Apostles Creed when they preached acts 2:38 but when we fear a certain promise it proves we don't believe the promise yet we must have perfect love for every promise Amen fear keeps people out of their inheritance they never even on this earth they never achieve what they're they're longing to achieve they never quite gain the possessions of God they've felt like they should possess because of fear fear is selfish fear only thinks about yourself it never thinks about others fear makes someone useless in God's army I want to be a useful tool for God in this kingdom I want to be a tool that God can trust and say well I know Jesse's gonna live a consecrated life I know he's gonna put the word above everything else I know he's gonna seek me first all of his days and I want to be a tool that if God wants to use me he knows right where I am I'm not wandering off into different temptations and things of the world but I'm right where I'm supposed to be right at my post of duty amen and God can look down and use me in his army at any time fear is prophetic as well for it brings on what the person fears we saw that fear allows sin to spread in the church it doesn't bring it to a halt fear will confront sin fear will confront disobedience fear will confront irreverence I'm sorry faith will confront irreverence fear will accept it fear will take it in but faith will confront it and faith will drive it out amen fear actually feeds all the racism in this world its sphere that does that and fear ultimately destroys Souls like the man with the one talent he had a god-given talent a god-given gift we'd say like Judas and his talent was to be a real apostle but he never received his inheritance MA he never walked in the inheritance of that calling because he sold it out for money and how many people sell it out like brother Ram said Elvis for a fleet of Cadillacs how many will sell out a genuine talent of God even if it just one it's still valuable to God how many will sell that out just for worldly possessions and bury that talent in the things of the world and ultimately because of fear and fear destroy souls the Bible says remember that David overcame fear by the following first he had a revelation of the will of God that's the first step you must know the will of God you must know what God's Word said then we must ignore family like he ignored his brother Church critics like King Saul and then you must recall God has done it before and God will do it again and we must speak twice as much about God as we do about the devil or the trial that we're going because that's what David did six times he mentioned God you only mentioned Goliath three times and then he hastened to the fight he wasn't a procrastinator well I'll fight him tomorrow or maybe I'll fight him next week I don't know if I fight him at all he didn't procrastinate but the Bible said he ran to the fight he took that devil face to face a man he took him on hallelujah because of this he had the revelation God's Word and a few weeks ago we saw what the inhabitants represented for us we must have once we're in the baptism of the Holy Ghost now these things of course can kill people before they're in the baptism of the Holy Ghost but if we've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost we must drive these out the love of money we must drive out fear we must drive out compromising or friendship with the world we must drive out carnal mindedness division strife and envy we must drive out double-minded instability we must drive out fleshly lusts like adultery's and sensual lusts of the mind and so forth like that and we must drive out complexes amen any stronghold in our mind that hinders our service toward God God gave us the Commission you drive it out and you'll drive it out by the power of my love amen that's how we'll drive it out and last Sunday we saw exactly how we narrowed in on a few quotes and things we already know but but important for us that we must hold the sword of the word with a strong hand of faith that's how we're gonna drive it out I'll never forget this in fact I got it right in front of me December 4th I preached the key to the door and I wrote down the promise that I was claiming and I still quote that promise amen we're gonna have a church with the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen I believe that amen I'm holding on to that Joel 2 23 through 26 with all the strength in my hand for the matter said some people just got strong enough faith to cut out baptism or cut out sanctification but we ought to have faith that we can cut out the baptism of the holy ghost and then cut out our possession or our inheritance and drive out all fear and all doubt and all complex and all worldliness we ought to drive all that out so the Spirit of God can feel welcome every time we come to this house hey man that's a strong hand of faith hallelujah but we're gonna have to battle for that I'm gonna have to take every step of that one step at a time little by little service after service year after year but I'm in this battle for the long haul praise God if others fall away that's fine they might not have the strong enough hands to do it but I'm called of God to do that and our strong hand of faith will accomplish all that God has called me to accomplish amen glory we must then brother and say we must go forward believing God's Word is your personal property God invites you into his variety store like we say a Sam's Club and he to get whatever you want no matter if it's on the second level third level just go up and get it but you've got to go get an amen it's your personal property that's what program said drives out the inhabitants when you take God's Word as your possession this word is mine amen it might not be for everybody else but it's mine amen and that's driving out the inhabitants amen number three brother Ram told that woman who had she said she never had a day of peace even had a night of rest of peace in her entire life and brother man told her in Louisiana there at the miserable Union he said you must go and deny that you ever had it amen they said and that will drive out the inhabitants he said you got to drive that out he said you must go deny it Amen so we in other words we must walk by faith and not by sight hallelujah that is actually driving it out and you must say it with your words you must believe it in your heart confess it with your lips and God will honor that as high priest he'll bring that to pass amen and then he said go forward this kind of goes up ties it with you know the second one go forward thanking God for being healed or filled or whatever you want you must go forward deny what you had or what you thought you had and thank him going forward knowing he's going to give it to you I mean love the Lord that's what the prophet of God teaches on inhabitants I looked up every time where the man said he might chebbi Zeit perizzite you name that but through all those and that's what he said that's how you drive out the inhabitants I'm glad I can drive out the inhabitants Amen by the grace of the Lord we closed last week with this little chart that we are going to live in one of the other we're they're gonna walk in the light of faith which is motivated by love or we're gonna walk in unbelief brother Branham said unbelief is the chief of all devils the chief it is the most powerful devil to try to anoint somebody to disbelieve God's Word the chief the hardest demon to deal with and try to talk sense into somebody is a religious spirit man said they're the Pharisees they'll go to church but you can't teach them nothing I think we're in danger many times of religious spirits don't you think we know all about it we don't need more of God we've got all that we need shame on that kind of attitude that's a religious demon amen and we've got to drive that out of our lives amen I know all about it and I'm not gonna let the Holy Spirit move anymore I've done all enough in my life and all these things like that we should one more brother man looked at age 50 and said I haven't done anything for the Lord I gotta do something before I pass if he thought that at age 50 what should we feel amen we should feel there's more for me to do there must be more Souls out there I want to win more souls for Christ amen or win one so or when two souls win somebody to Jesus Christ hallelujah then brother Branham said this stress and nervousness is the worst feeling anyone could have which is we talked about oppression depression distress nervousness all these follow the banner of unbelief these are all attributes of unbelief there's only one sin that's unbelief amen but there's a demon of course the religious spirit there's a demon to distress and oppression and depression and nervousness and all these things and then the Prophet said fear is the greatest thing against the church so of all these demons the one demon that battles the church as a whole Universal is the spirit of fear and he said fear accompanies doubt the Prophet tells us that how many understand this by the grace of Lord but love drives out all of these when we love God it'll drive out every religious demon it'll drive out any distress any nervousness any fear if when we have love in our hearts and surely it's a full love of God it drives out all that love and faith and unbelief cannot exist at the same time we've got to have one near the other and I ask you what but what atmosphere are you sitting in this morning I trust it's an atmosphere of faith amen love of God because this is an awful existence this is an awful romance that you'll be disappointed with Christianity if you live with these kind of spirits you'll be disappointed in it he said what you constantly have to stay at Calvary amen and remember in the blood of Jesus Christ and all it's done for us we don't want to be disappointed we want to be fulfilled in our walk we want to be satisfied with Christ amen we want to be dissatisfied with the world and we want to be satisfied with the blood of Jesus Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit amen I want to go to this here's a new thought now brother Graham said mankind's greatest fear has already been conquered so the greatest battle against the church's fear but brother Branham said out of all the fears the greatest one has already been conquered and we know they all been conquered let's look at this from in-person personation of Christianity when's Adams rate the children of Adam was backed into a corner death and sickness on every hand sin crowding in the law had failed the prophets had failed everything had failed they had refused they were in such a muddle diseases and ignorance and so forth had just collapsed them into a place so there was no hope left and there said Adams rapes quivering shaking nothing could be done hair was opening up her bosom to swallow them up and in glory someone stepped out the Son of God I'll go down father I'll become one of them I'll go down what will you do to the Angels and Jesus said watch amen hallelujah so you take the four thousand years of history and every prophet would go down in fear remember job fear death remember he all that he feared came upon him and job looked and he got an inspiration but I know my Redeemer liveth he got a revelation that he would live again amen but before this they went down and down and down and God here sends Christ and Christ says I'll go down I'll become one of them and I'll conquer fear but when I said one day down there among the sons of men he looked down through the greatest dread that man had which was death and he raised his arms and went to a place called Calvary he plunged himself into the darkest mix that never feared which was death and conquered it and he ascended up on high he never sent down a declaration of theological faith but he sent back the Holy Spirit and said take this and fight with everything you've got within you praise God take this and follow me as the father sent me so send I you so Jesus came down from heaven to destroy man's greatest fear which was death and then after Jesus raised he said I'm gonna give you the Holy Spirit and now with the Holy Spirit inside of you fight with everything you've got by the seal of God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul amen so I move this up I move fear up now fear is our greatest action now we might fear poverty or sickness but the greatest fear brother Branham said was death he said the greatest tread man had was death I never thought about death I never thought about your death we see it all the time we prayed for it this week we see how death comes so suddenly many times I was praying yesterday here on my knees you say Lord my life is such a vapor help me to redeem the time and do everything I can in my little vapor of life amen there's been times I've feared death there's been times we all fear death but death was the greatest of all the fears you might fear other things but death was the greatest the Prophet said even amongst the prophets of Joseph and Moses and all these prophets death was the greatest fear and the Prophet said every principality and power he tore down and spoiled at his crucifixion and resurrection he broke through the veil of sin he tore it apart with the high priest blood of his own body he come to the next what was it the veil of sickness that held over the people he tore it apart sorry can you picture Jesus doing that tearing this veil there's a veil of sin he tears the veil there's a veil of sickness he tears the veil he's breaking through every veil brother Ram said to get down to Satan's headquarters right he toured apart for he was wounded for our transgressions and with his stripes we were healed he went through the great vale yonder of sickness the great veil of sin he went through the great veil of worry I'm never battle worried it's just the form of fear it's a form of fear you're worried about this why are you worried about it because we don't have faith about it he went through the great veil of fear he tore every one of them down and ascended so high and received the name above every name that's named in the heavens above or the earth below or in the world to come aren't you glad about that church every mail every sheet that seemed like oh there's just a sheet between God and I or Christ tonight there's a sheet of sin sickness fear worry there's all these veils separating us from God and Christ went through and broken through every one of them that ought to make us rejoice amen but they have said this marvelous great bridge as my color friends used to sing it's a highway to heavens we're walking up the Kings Highway which I love to sing surely all over Jesus has finished everything's completed Jesus would have not sat down in heaven if he had not have completed the work no man sets down until his job is over amen that's right when Jesus took his blood and went through the heaven of heaven and condemned every devil took the keys of death and hell and sat down aren't you glad amen every devil he condemned I I dramatized it a few years ago when I preached it but he condemned scoliosis he condemned tuberculosis amen he condemned cancer he condemned lust he condemned greed he condemned every devil he tore through every veil and he took the keys of hell and death and he took the keys of death because that was our greatest fear but now Christ holds the keys amen and when he looked over the earth he saw the greatest fear man had was death he ran to a certain place called Calvary and there he caught death in his bosom a man and he ascended up up and he said you wait over yonder until your endued with power from on high he sent back the Holy Ghost and said follow me and fight with everything you got within you and brother this is God's Word which is sharper than a two-edged sword it's the greatest power that was ever put in man's hand and gods expecting Adams race to put sin and sickness and all kinds of Devils to the fighting walls that's right we've got the most powerful weapon there is God's expecting the Bride of Christ to use the Holy Spirit that's with inside of them to put all these sicknesses under their feet to drive them back and possess the full inheritance of a son and daughter of God amen and he gave us the most powerful weapon which is the Word of God amen notice what the Bible said about Jesus Jesus destroyed him that had the power of death that is the devil Jesus did that remember of the word destroy there doesn't mean to annihilate it means to stop the influence so the Bible said Jesus destroyed or stopped the influence of the devil and that he had the power of death he stopped his influence so Satan before it could take every person you know he could take a Moses he could take the Elijah he could take all the Adam and Eve he could take all of them but when Jesus conquered death now he had power over death amen now his influence would be above Satan's influence amen he was getting the power back that he once had that Adam lost we know that and remember second Peter gave us the law that Adam lost from whom a man is overcome of the same is he brought in bondage Adam had the power the spoken word when he was sinless to do whatever he wanted but as soon as he was overcome as soon as he gave in to the serpent what happened was Satan took full possession of of the property of individuals because he deceived Adams race now he's got a certain power over them the power of death but the Bible said though that even though death conquered Adam we know the second Adam conquered death amen glory to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm sat down with my father in his throne so even though the first Adam was overcome we know the second Adam overcame death amen hail and the grave and Satan in every temptation he ripped through every veil and now gives us the privilege of receiving all God's inheritance for us amen and considering death we no longer fear death Christians should never fear death because the Bible said it's precious death is precious in the sight of the Lord of his Saints it's a precious thing when God calls an old servant of God home it's a precious thing when God calls a middle-aged servant of God home it's a precious thing when God calls a little child a little servant child when it calls him home the Bible said precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints you believe that this morning Luke 1622 look how precious it is it's so precious the Bible said that when the beggar died he was carried by Angels into Abraham's bosom I remember when I passed out at Waterloo and Kevin and John carried me out to the emergency car do you guys remember that I passed out I felt like I was getting carried there's been times and sports people had carried me around you know if I won the race or something like that there's been a few times have been carried around because of great events or maybe sad events but one thing's for sure God is so God is so pleased when his faithful servants come home the Bible said he carries them with angel hands amen angels pack and bring the the believer into the dimension of God and the Bible said there carried by the Angels don't you love the Lord amen Stephen was so full of the Holy Ghost he looks up to heaven before he stoned and the Bible said Jesus is standing on the right hand of the Father brother Adam said he gave Stephen salute as the five-star general he gives us a soldier as faithful soldier a standing salute as he enters into the heavenly dimensions amen beautiful because Paul said this we are confident say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord Paul said Christians many times would rather be absent from this world and they'd rather be present with the Spirit of the Lord how many understand that life is very difficult life is a trial but we don't have to lay over and give up we can be more than conquerors amen but there's a part of us that know there's we're longing for that that theophany body we're longing for that glorified body we're longing for perfect peace we're longing for perfect love amen we're longing for for perfection times perfection times perfection we're longing for those things and the Bible said we were to desire that we're really rather to be present with the Lord remember what Paul said it's better than I stay here so I can minister to you that's what he told the Philippians and the Corinthians I believe he said that so death is precious it was the most fearful thing but now there's no fear and death amen the Bible said I'm he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death praise the Lord I mentioned this last week and brother Bosworth who just went home and glory huh me note F F Bosworth greatest greatest saint of the day as I know what a compliment from the prophet of God this is in 1958 the greatest saint of the day as I know a member he retired from preaching and he was stopping preaching until he was 75 years old and then he heard brother Branham preach he ministered for nine more years and he said they were his nine years of ministry were better than his previous 40 hallelujah amen God has a time and season for all things how many believe that but see he had to be willing to leave the comfort of his retirement to do something for the kingdom of God to follow the new revived or the new inspiration so we can't say well I'm 50 we're I'm 40 I'm 65 and I just can't do nothing more for the Lord we can't say that even in our day God raised up a 75 year old man to preach nine more years and experience the great nine years of his life church there's hope for you and I this morning amen Christ has conquered death hell and the grave there's confidence we can have in Christ if we just believe his word glory the greatest saint of the day as I know I don't know how that's a tremendous compliment from a prophet of God I still got two copies of that Christ the healer if anybody wants the copy by God's grace he went home to meet Jesus the other day was in his 80s 84 he said later unquote he's at home tonight before he died about an hour and this is recorded by F F Bosworth son in the in the introduction what's it called the preface of the book of Christ the healer his son records this and this book has over a half a million print copies that are in print and it might have been more than an hour I'd probably to look in the book right after get done preaching before he died about an hour he went to a coma and raised up so he raised this up he's in the coma he raises up and he begins shaking hands with the people he preached two years ago that's been gone just rejoicing and praising God saying I haven't seen you for years a man in a coma he's probably got his eyes closed I haven't seen you in years and he begins shaking the hands of souls that have already passed on to the other dimension there's no fear and death anymore Church amen but RAM quotes this poem by Longfellow lives of great men or a - we can make our lives sublime with partings leave behind us footprints on the sands of time his nine last years of his life greater than the previous 75 will say like that that's right he said let my end be like that remember that now you there's another quote four years later I went to see him at 84 years old yes to the old arms out like that they just come off the fields in Africa 84 years old or 84 years old missionary with me in the jungles and I run to him and throw my arms around him I knew he was dying I just cried my father and my father the chariots of israel and the horsemen thereof a gallant man and he said this is the happiest time of all my life brother branham why because he just walked in the anointing of the message of the hour for the nine last years and now he's it even as a greater assurance he even has more bonus in the day of judgment amen because he's walking in the anointing he's in his position praise God he gained this inheritance hallelujah 84 years old still preaching snow pressing the the kingdom of God and I'm the happiest I've ever been at 84 years old amen what an opposite thought to Ecclesiastes 12 where it said you know when the remember the days of your youth in the crater right when the evil days come Christ has totally changed that it'll give me wrong there's some pains and aches we go through as they get older but look he's not the saddest at the end of his life he's the happiest glory so the power of the Holy Spirit when we learn to fight with the Holy Ghost inside of us I can't fight with my mind I got a fight with Christ mind I can't fight with my strength it's got to be the strength of God amen when we learn to fight with like that our years become longer and our days should become happier why because we're living in his presence and in his presence his fullness of joy man not a make-believe joy but real Holy Ghost show a men highly nearly that's exactly right he said I said you know you're dying don't you brother Bosworth you're about to die and he said I can't die oh my goodness you're about to die you're about to get cancer you're about to get sick I can't die I already been dead for 60 years amen look at this man he's got eagle eyes division he's got eagle eyes of faith he's seeing what God sees the mass amen he cast out everything he's not living by his natural mind he's fighting by the Holy Spirit that's with inside of him amen he's pushing out all fear there is no fear and death amen precious in the sight Lord is the death of his Saints amen the greatest fear man ever had has been defeated and Christ has destroyed death and him that had the power of death amen he saw just waiting the moment when I see all that I have lived for Loree see him walking that door to invite me to his house I said that's the way that's the way to die they said quite a while before he died or went home he raised up and shaking hands with converse of his that come to Christ to his ministry for a long time and then he gave up the spirit and went on to be with them what a gallant I just love such things as that how many love supernatural things like that Artie in a coma and yet raising up and blending into the other dimension and because of that your ease able to see the other dimension is so and not yet leptin but it has to act it has to respond because it's getting ready to cross over hallelujah it's getting ready so there's no fear in love because perfect love will drive all that out no matter where you are in life you can say this morning I'm going to take the same zeal that that Bosworth had I'm gonna run after the message the hour with all my heart I'm gonna cast out all fear I'm not you old where I can't do something for God I can do something for God we all can grab ahold of that and possess all the inheritance that God has given to us but we must have no fear and we must act upon the word of the Lord that's exactly right church that's exactly right hallelujah and you know when you have that revelation you actually work better for the Lord when you don't fear death you actually work better the Bible says that if you're scared to die scared of this scared of that you'll never work your best for the Lord like but man get an example if you're scared you know let's say you're a farmer and if you're scared you know there's going to come a snowstorm or if you're scared is going to come all this droughts and everything like that and you never plant any seeds you're never gonna get anything out a farmer has to have faith glory and Christ and Christ has made us farmers right our hearts are supposed to be good honest grounds and we're supposed to receive the promises of God the seeds of God the Word of God and when we don't fear these things that we bring forth more fruit when we have no fear and death it was the greatest enemy that man the fear of death pause so full of love he said Oh death where is thy sting o grave where is your victory this thing of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore my brethren be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord so see that when we no longer fear death our work actually gets more fruitful and a bounce more and more because we know what's going to happen we have bonus in that day we have bonus of the day of judgment why because we know Christ's spirit the Bible said his spirit bears witness with our spirit look what God said you know where Paul got that from Hosea never know that he said Oh death where is your sting did you ever read that in Hosea look what it says God is talking God said I will ransom them from the power of the grave in other words I'll pay their debt aren't you glad he paid your debt if you still got sin attached to you you can't go to heaven you had a debt but Christ paid the debt he did not owe and you owe to debt you could not pay man but Christ paid the ransom amen he said I will redeem them from death they said Oh death I will be your plagues amen Oh grave I will be your destruction death and the grave look like their plagues or their their powers but jesus said I'm the one that's going to play gear amen he looked at the devil said I'm going to plague you you're plaguing the sons of men but I'm the one that's going to plague you praise God I'm gonna return all this evil you've done upon mankind and I'm gonna pay you back amen and I will be your destruction and I'll conquer death hell and the grave and he did praise God haha he did a man how do you know because we live today by his same spirit that he sent back amen that's how we know Church love it's a powerful force projecting his love the Prophet said that love that God had love is a powerful force when love's projected and it comes to the end of his strength sovereign grace will take it up from there and project the object that love has asked for that's let me read it again when love is projected and it comes to the end of its strength sovereign grace will take it up from there and project the object that love has asked for that's hard to explain that's the reason we have a savior tonight is because God so loved the world that He sent His love being projected to the world produced a savior so God's love projected a savior God wanted to see you well so much I don't think God wants to see you healthy I'm gonna see how many believe God wants to see you overcome your battles the constant inhabitants the constant battles the constant things we battle over and over again we should overcome them his love went out and it produced an atonement for your sickness as your sins it was the love of God that constrained him to do it he said it's a powerful force it'll run a woman a mother right into the flames of fire after her baby if she know she's plunging yourself to death there's nothing more strong than love love will make you trust you might go and know that you belong to the greatest church in the provinces Canada you might know that you're the charter member of the greatest church in the nation think about the greatest message Church in the nation the RAM said you could be the greatest charter member the original member of the greatest Church and then you would do that or you would do things that you would not do if you belong to little mission somewhere in the corner and had the love of God in your heart look at by the way I'm saying people would say well if I had a bigger church I'd do more for the kingdom of God oh that's just a lie that's one of Satan's lies well brother have said if you've got love you would do it whether in a big church or small church on a mission corner somewhere glory it all depends if you got love love drives you to do it it does make excuses love just drives you to do it it's the force driving you to serve God's will for your life my life has to project God's love your life has to project God's love when when our love is reaches and grace has to step in and it has to project it has to project love to you you have to project love to me it's the love of God that does it love has no fear love casts out fear and I noticed in my meeting so much that when I come into the people one of the great things I find among them is fear and what makes fear is the lack of confidence if you lack confidence it'll make you fear but if you love it casts away that fear and that's the way God wants his church not so many as charter members he wants believers that's loyal loves believes and has confidence in him I was talking to a pastor one time and people left his church and when they left they said we've lost all confidence in you and he was weeping on the phone telling me that that's one of the hardest things to hear is we've lost confidence look at that one of the great things I find and what makes them lack confidence is fear fear is lack of confidence if you lack confidence it'll make you fear and the Bible said don't cast away your confidence in Hebrews chapter 10 hey don't cast away your confidence but hang on to the Word of God see we must have confidence in the love of God that He loves us we must be more than just charter members of churches we must be loyal we must love we must believe and we must have confidence in Jesus Christ hey man and one another because the Bible said if you bring sit in here it hinders the whole move of God why don't have confidence and so and so on have confidence and so and so that that shows fear and love has to drive that away so love can get the victory in the church that's exactly right that's God projecting his love the Prophet says amen does that help by the grace Lords that help that I hope that helps by the grace Lord love fear brings a lack of trust in God or others but love drives that all out love does that now I'm up to the spot where this is my title the law of perfect love so I'm gonna have to close maokai you can switch over to easy worship now so it's already easy worship because I'm out of quotes I'd have time I got all those but I'm time to get the rest of these so let's look at the rest of these the law of perfect love so give me a few more minutes here I'm not sure how long I'll go only got one service here but it already okay 12:30 oh my let's look at this here the law I want to show you the quote where I got this as well so you know of course it's not something I made up or anything like that this is a direct quote from the prophet of God so let me find this here I just got to scroll down a little bit the law perfect love now I preach this a little bit when I preach on fear at the beginning this is from Jarius and divine healing 1954 he's talking about the law of electricity it talks about the laws of gravity and bringing water to crops you know using irrigation he said you must work according to the law of gravitation he said do you believe that he said now your conscience God is here now the only thing that we can do is work according to the law of God for our healing the law of God for our healing we must work according to the law of God look what he says just like you work with irrigation of my crops up there need water I got it somehow get him up there I got to get a pump right I gotta work according to the laws but Ramson you could scream at the water all day get up on that hill get up on that hill but you got to work with the laws of gravitation amen the laws of electricity you've got to do that the Bram said is that right what is the law of God his love to words what's the law of God let's say together let's say his love ready his love that's the law of God if you in a work according to laws of electricity that's wonderful laws of gravitation but if you want to get anywhere with God you must work according to this law his love and quotes first John 4:18 our text perfect love casts out all fear love and faith is the same thing see love perfect love casts out all fear which gives faith you see okay stay with me stay with me so what's the law of God his love if we want to attain anything in God we've got to work according to his laws and his law is love perfect love has to drive out all fear drive out all doubt or unbelief all pride all self-pity all lust love has to drive all that out let me finish the quote now bro man tells us how this law works very simple go to lieutenant while you're there Luke 10:27 let's go there program tells us the law how to work perfect love he tells us long very very simple well I'm so glad God made it simple for us oh my thank you Jesus you know all these words we're using they all go together faith sincerity confidence love confession forgiveness all these things they all work together they're all working together let's look at this jesus said now here's the man answering to Jesus love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy strength with all thy mind and with light and thy neighbor as thyself look at verse 28 and jesus said unto him thou has answered right that's the greatest commandment this do and thou shalt live so full of complete love for God produces life right produces life brother Bram said now how do you get this he said now here's I'm finishing the quote now if you'll just love God with all your heart he said you'll work according to laws of God if you'll just love God with all your heart soul mind and strength he said then the law of God will work for you and he goes on to say this if you've done something to your neighbor or somebody just say in your heart now I love them to the demands of the prayer line he's trying to get the people to believe for healing most of us aren't sick this morning Jose said he's sick so most of us maybe don't have the need of sickness most of us have another need how many have needs this morning it operates this is the law of God for anything any promise of God to operate his love is the law and we must love God with all of our heart soul mind and strength and if we do that then the law of God will go to working for us amen he quotes another person he's he's just you know quoting people in the audience but I think what they might say well I've got something against the neighbor he said now just tell them I love them too he said oh brother branham I've criticized you a little bit but I love you anyhow so he's even telling people that are sitting listening to him that they're probably criticizing brother Branham and brother and said just tell God in your heart now that you love me even though you've been criticizing me tell tell the Lord in your heart that you love brother Branham oh my I see we've got the love everybody praise God that is the law of God to love God with all your heart that's your emotions heart soul that's your soul mind that's your here s your human spirit and your strength that's your physical body you've got to love God with all your body you got to yield all your being to Christ I mean understand that we must yield all of our being to Jesus Christ if we went the law of love to work for us he saw he said now this now just let that take place like that and just get the whole atmosphere in here of love then watch the law of God go to work just on that just on that the law of love will go to work he said just the same as it made the Hornets go back in their nests eat about when he sent the Hornets back by love I'm sorry i disturb you from your nest remember when he was mowing his backyard and just as it stopped the bull in the field and oh my the things that I could tell you is this simple enough to if you want to work according to God's love God's law you work in love and you just say Lord I love the person I might have sin against them but I love them forgive me I love that person I love the preachers I love them I love the sisters I love the deacon I love everything do you have to say it you have to believe it and mean it praise God you have to have full love in your whole being if the law of God is going to operate now I mentioned this on Wednesday night because I read the quote from the Sardis church age where brother BAM said every Church that doesn't have the supernatural will give an account to God for that through an manifestations of the gifts any church without that will give an account I mentioned that on Wednesday night hopefully everybody listen to that it's feeding on the Word of God program says this and the message desperation I told you I was gonna back that up and here's the quote Romero said the days that we're living in should cause the church to completely completely into desperation I believe since the message this morning from God not me I believe it ought to throw the entire congregation in the desperation that we have played long enough we went to the church long enough we got to do something how many believe that these end days these awful days of of human self-love right lovers of themselves more lovers of God disobedient Oh disobedient to parents no natural affection trucebreakers incontinent backbiters false accusers all these things this ought to throw us not them Church us seeing that ought to throw us in the desperation other words we are desperate to see God move in other words we're desperate to see the laws of God operate hey man here's what he says next now here's the court I want to get to you how is it that we can see other great signs and wonders done on others and what about us it should cause an estate of desperation that we are determined before God there you go okay I'm saying about signs and wonders he said we've got to give an account and aren't you glad for the ones you've seen your lives I'm saying for those who are who are kind of and for double-minded well I need America or maybe I don't want America is it the will of God or not that's what I'm talking about I'm talking about if we're not sure what the will of God is we need in that case we need desperation to find the heart of God the will of God and then we can see the law of God operate praise the Lord remember the prophets said the true Church of the continuation the book of Acts the book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist spirit would come to the church and defile now you it you and I have to ask ourselves are we defiled spiritually Antichrist comes in to file the church make it lukewarm formal and powerless are your prayers powerless or your prayers formal or are they full of power we all got to ask ourselves that question are you willing to ask yourself that question this morning you've got to be willing to ask yourself that question God hates a powerless religion in other words a religion that doesn't fully love God because if you fully love God it brings the power it moves the law of God if you're compromising in this air your life or that air your life or that air life and people will compromise on many levels many different spirits many different levels of different things all around their lives if they're compromised on one level and then it gets to others how can the law of God work in their life it can't because they're breaking the laws of God he said we've got to be desperate when we see the supernatural on others we said what about us it should cause the state of desperation amen all things 1962 2nd Timothy 3 the Holy Spirit warned us in the last days the church would get away from the sincerity and the faith they have a form of godliness but we deny the power that went all right well that went with the right thing having a form of godliness denying the power thereof God hates powerless religion it's got that power and it's got to have sincerity sincerity brings power sincerity brings real worship not forms I don't know about you but I had some real worship during solemn service this morning we should have real worship that means we don't care who's around it's just like it's us and God worshiping the Lord just me worshiping God real worship if you're not sincere and it's not it's not a real worship he said but sincerity brings real worship not forms but genuine power worship to know that you pass from death unto life amen God wants to perform his word by his power and when the church denies his power how can he perform and vindicate his work God wants to do great things God wants to answer prayer but we've got to be sincere we've got to be desperate in others we've got to be full of God's love because if you know brother amps that love makes you desperate love makes you different Esper and he gives you a lot of illustrations like you said what if your wife had cancer it would throw you into desperation I'll do anything to save my wife I'll do anything to save my husband love causes desperation the reason people are desperate for the word of God even the message or any nomination is because they're not really filled with all the love they ought to be filled with they're in love with things of the world they're compromising here and there but the love of God makes you desperate amen glory it makes you enjoy the preach and enjoy the five mobile ministry enjoy worshiping Jesus Christ that's what God's love does to you if not it becomes a routine it becomes stagnant I say like that exactly right this is the law of love this is the law of perfect love perfect love only operates when we're fully in love with God in every channel every fiber of our being a surrender to God's will and you're the one that knows if you're defiled powerless formal lukewarm you're the one that knows remember this is the greatest age of deception don't be deceived take some time like the Holy Spirit said and sister Karen at those meetings if you weeks ago search your heart deep search your heart to make sure get everything out to make sure you got a circular take some time in search praise God here's where I said it's artesian church age any other church that does not have the spirit and the manifestations is going to have to account to God and that's going to be at the white throne judgment because that will not be the bride brides that I have to give an account for not having the Holy Ghost the spear and the bride say come she's filled with the Holy Ghost praise God she's washed by the Holy Ghost she's washed by the waters of the word oh my they to give an account they claim to be the message that claim to be holy ghost Phil well where's the manifestation of that the law of God should work the law of love should work where's the power of God in our lives amen here's where he says the desperation and I'm getting closer here to being done but RAM said I believe the reason we don't have desperation is because it's a lack of love he didn't say it's a lack of having enough tapes to listen to or it's a lack of not having enough time I don't have enough time in my life I think we're all busy I think we all can understand we are all busy the reason we don't desperation is because the lack of love the love of God I think the love love of God causes desperation I me appreciate his opinion how many one take his opinion if you have love of God it'll cause you to be desperate for some other person that's what I was saying one time I think I said it even if I come up here and preach on water baptism of the Holy Spirit don't shut me out don't another I'm sorry don't shut the Holy Spirit up don't resent a preacher for preaching on water baptism if you've heard it 500 times don't shut off and resent the Holy Spirit or the preacher because what if God's trying to get somebody saved like Haven last week and that person would be so selfish all they're thinking about their own selves instead of agreeing without the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit rying to drive this thought down to a young believers heart not and a formal religious person will sit back and criticize that you understand or understand it but God's love will drive you to desperation if you really have got lured it must be desperate the Holy Spirit chose to bring this thought again it must be important now I can say at the beginning of my ministry I preached a lot on water baptism so they have much other material I'll be honest there but now I get I can't say that if I'm preaching on water baptism or something elementary like faith or salvation or something like that it's because the Holy Spirit's trying to get it to somebody and we need to back that up and support that not resent that and not be formal but still stay on fire amen I hope you understand morning I preached on the scarcely saved scarcity lost we had like eight visitors from the Omi's family member sister Wendy told me that children were screaming all over and trying to get people to be saved and hear the message Satan was trying to fight this you know trying to get the word and if we're not careful we might have sat back and just open our heart to hurt us before already know about four classes and three believers in four classes already know about this but if we get in the channel the Holy Spirit we can get behind what the Holy Spirit wants to do and agree with it and we can be led to go pray for somebody or be led to talk to somebody afterwards find a leadership with the Holy Spirit get in unity and here with the Spirit saying to the churches but not formal because the love of God doesn't make it formal God's love makes a desperate amen well Gramps and I believe it will the tokens inside of you it'll throw you into desperation I believe it will church more of us should be more desperate during regular services not just special meetings but just regular services and if you've got the love of God in you it'll cause you to do that the token inside of you will cause you do that not to resent the preacher or shut him down or get a resentful spirit that's that's a spirit of unbelief but to back it up and know that the Holy Spirit is having his way if we're all yielding to God program sin now the word plainly states if you want to put this down Galatians 5:6 faith worketh by love and the only way you can have faith is to have love first because after all faith is loves incentive so that's what love once loved one's faith love once made love when you love God oh I just want the faith right I just want the revelation of the rapture brother Kevin I just want that the love we've got in me I don't want to be here in the tribulation I love Jesus he died for me I've sacrificed all my life the love of God in me once that rapturing faith amen that's my incentive a man he died to save me from the wrath of God I'm a children of life not a child of darkness Amen and therefore I will not be a child of wrath I will not suffer the wrath of God I will rejoice in the deliverance of God amen that's my incentive rapturing faith is my incentive for the love that I have for Christ how can you have faith in your wife if you don't love her that's agape so that's figlio how about a got bow to God he said that's what you do with God when you love God you tell him about it we sat down and we adore him and worship Him and love drives us to that I hope you had a chance this morning to sit down with God and tell him how much you love him I hope you had a chance to do that because love will drive you to that or last night or this weekend love drives somebody to desperation for more of God it's love now for some of us it might be legalism if we're always living under condemnation but really behind all that if we can get rid of that condemnation it's love that drives us to God it's love that drives us for signs wonders and miracles it's love that drives us for the token right for any redemptive promise of God what drives you to justification love drives you to that he died for me I love him love will drive you to justification sanctification back to the Holy Ghost fullness of Pentecost of the church I need any promise of God divine healing love drives you to that amen that's my incentive a man his faith for healing faith for the rapture faith for Supernatural that's my incentive because I love Christ amen glory love drives you to that amen he said I believe love will do it amen the love of God will do it the only way to have faith is to have love first love drives you to that when we have genuine love what does it do brother branham it pushes our faith out on the battlefront for God when you have love for God love will constrain you to go fight right every time I see one of these veterans what I try to thank them for serving and what is it it's their love for the country now it's a natural love but it's still a love and we appreciate that naturally I appreciate that human love to put their lives on the line for our country I told one just recently no greater love has no man than this and he laid his life down for his friends try to encourage God's got a place for soldiers like that that do it for the right reasons God has a place like I said God's got a place for pet doctors that do that doctors that will cross in the middle of night now he said the old time doctors crossed rivers and go to ministers somebody and don't take any pay God has a special place in heaven for Pat for doctors like that pastors doctors I mean doctors Lorena said if you have love it pushes our faith on the battlefront for God genuine godly love for God and first word and first people will push faith out there love takes ahold of faith and said come on let's go and out it goes cuz that's what love does if God said I'm the Lord that he'll see he believes that love makes him believe it because love dominates all what's dominating our lives church this weekend what's dominating our lives this last month the last year of our life what's dominating our love is it love or is it religious spirit is it love or is it insecurities fierce anger bitterness complexes money what is it what is it what's dominating our life it ought to be the love of Jesus Christ in all your heart soul mind and strength that will move the law of God in your life he said though I speak with tongues have been angels have not love it does me nothing so I have faith to move mountains it doesn't know what love is nothing love dominates all because God is love a God of love yes sir Jesus said if a man loves me he'll keep my words we know it is true that God will meet a desperate soul we all know that but it usually takes something to drive Jesse into that and you place your name in there how do we know God answers a desperate soul he said it takes it takes something to drive humans into that to despair to desperation it takes something to do that brother Brandon said we should have desperation all the time in the message desperation libram said brother I can't member his name wasn't Bosworth one of the older brothers went up to him and said brother Branham I hate to have to answer on the day of judgment for the millions of souls you preach - he said that threw me into desperation he's been I've he said I've been in desperation ever since so here's a man who lives under desperation in other words he lives under this love that reaches out I want to have faith I want to believe God I wanna believe all God's promises I want to see the Word of God come to pass love constrains him to have desperation to see God's Word fulfilled are you with me Church does that make sense we want to see God but when I come here I don't come here to play Church I come here to see God move even is bring one person to Thanksgiving or one person who repents one person to healing that's why we come to God's house in his love it drives us to see someone have faith in God's Word and stop living under fear or doubt or unbelief or greed or lust or something like that faith drives us to that love drives out there to see the revelation of God's Word take place in the church in our lives we should have that all the time that's why I gotta constantly make sure I'm here Saturday morning every morning so I can get my desperation back for the Lord every and every Wednesday we constantly have to have that if we don't have that it becomes formal church becomes just going through the routine and who's responsible for that you and I are cuz well to answer for it if we if we let that go on never understand program so we're gonna come to caters Barnea right we got a crossover in the baptism Holy Ghost or stay outside I want to go into I believe I'm in by God's grace but I want everybody in the church to go in praise the Lord and if you're in then you're fighting these things with love perfect love is casting out all fear amen that's what's happening you're possessing the promises now give me five minutes let me set my timer so I don't go too long give me five minutes and I'll be done here brother branham ends this by giving all these listen to these examples of desperation Jacob was desperate he wrestled an angel but he but he possess the promise well Gramps the love drove Jacob to that love well Graham said Hezekiah cried out God spare me give me 15 more years the man said that was God's love in Hezekiah crying out for God to move see it was love crying out for that faith give me that faith to be him see God's love does that to you aren't you glad for God's love the next he gave us Ruth Ruth cried out in desperation right and God let her go with Naomi that's her brother ma'am sent Jonah cried out in desperation from the belly of the whale and God gave him the desire of his heart Hannah cried out for a child and God gave her a prophet a special blessed he said extra special blessing of prophet fasting and praying the Shulamite woman brother man said she got in desperation when the boy died that God gave her and then Elijah got in desperation said why this baby died and he went and you know went back and forth of the room and you know sneeze seven you know he prayed for him laid his face on sneeze seven times desperation drove him to pray for a dead boy love drove him to do that the love of God to see the faith of God operate love drives us to do that then he gave the example blind Bartimaeus he said love cried out son of David have mercy on me give me my sight and even though they said shut up Bart blind Bartimaeus he said the son of David have mercy on me love will cause you to shout and praise God and crowd to God or get on your knees and pray love knows that love it's crying out for Lord give me the faith love operates by faith Amen then he gives example Peter when he was sinking said Lord saved me crying on desperation Jesus saved him listen to the message if you haven't listened this a few weeks ago brother and said Jesus in Gethsemane there was love that cried out father if it be possible let this cup pass from me love caused him to be desperate because he loved the father well the rancid forest nightingale trout as far as she could go the real skinny woman I don't know if his TV or what it was but she was all bones he said it was love that drove her to desperation then he go into Hattie waldrop she had heart cancer in his first campaign she said or he said and God healed sister Hattie waldrop because she had love weatherman said she'd already passed out and died in the prayer line and they prayed for God healed her and she's still alive that she was gonna be at the meetings there in 1965 still heart cancer and died and passed out and God brought her back because love made or not made the people around her and herself for desperate for God's word to go in effect and he gave the example of Jairus and his daughter dying Jarius went out and got Jesus said come you know come to my house love drove them to forget all about his Jewish denominations drive out of that denominational Church and bring the Living Word to his house woman with the blood issue wrote and said she had to push through the crowds and sweet pass and push pass hold big muscle Peter love drove her to physically push to touch Jesus's garb amen love drove her to that he said the queen of South crossed the desert because love desired to see God's Word operate in a man hallelujah woman with a dead baby in Mexico but man said the woman saw a blind man receive a sight in Mexico and no dead baby and no Usher a brother branham could keep her from God's prophet a man to hear the word of God it was God's love see she got desperate I saw God do it for somebody else God can do it for me the man said the same thing tonight when the same desperation rises will throw love and faith up there to the battlefront to claim what you want because you love God because it's a promise of God that you can have it he said desperation when you seek me with all your heart you'll find me some other rams text was Jeremiah 29 God told Israel you'll be there seventy years in Babylon he said but at the end of that you'll seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart everybody quotes that scripture when they say I know the thoughts that I have for you thoughts of good and not of evil honey ever seen that everybody quotes that scripture but they leave out the part about seeking God with all their hearts everybody wants the good thoughts everybody wants to plan for their lives and the church said everybody wants God's blessings but who's gonna be the ones that actually seek God in desperation with all their heart who's gonna be that that's the one who's actually gonna God's gonna answer the one who seeks God in desperation by the love it's in his heart this is the law of perfect love let's say into our feet so make sure I close I still got myself in that twenty seconds the last example brother Brandon gave was the woman who had her morals ruined and a man slipped the drug in her drink ruined her morals she went crazy tried to marry a few times end up in the good Sheppard's home brother Branham said she prayed until she knew something happened she knew the love of God entered into her heart and she left that good Sheppard's home and said I'll never be the same the Branham said a partial hunger will not bring the love of God on the scene a partial hunger will not bring it on the scene you can't love God with part of your heart part of your soul part of your mind and partiers you can't do that I expect God's law to operate only operates when we love God with all of our hearts listen that look-up partial hunger is only one time in the message Albuquerque you see what the Holy Ghost he got a partial hunger but not a real hunger and I think church let's be honest me too I'm with you in this I mean I'm with you in this we off the battle a partial hunger for coming to hear God's Word a partial hunger to say dedicate in our homes to be faithful in our jobs everywhere at school all of us battle a partial hunger we need a full hunger and that's what moves the laws of God when we love God with all of our hearts incomplete so here you got all fresh tell me whenever you ready I'm closing with this now remember not Christian later Sita has a fervent desire to please God I just want to do what God will be pleased with I just want to obey God and know that he's pleased with me fervent desire to please God what's the next one anyway know by this time didn't we know this anybody got this quote memorized it's a passion to knows word purgative desire to please him a passion of knows where it was the last one reaching out and crying in the Holy Spirit that's the threefold evidence that you're hot and Leo steel let me understand that that's page 88 the church age book this is all faded he says and instead of the church being on fire with the fire of God it has cooled off and become a bit formal regular routine go through the motions for me we can't allow that church around so the condition should drive us in desperation I need to see your word for film I really want to believe I want to see the laws of God operate for me try gonna desperation love does that just a brief testimony I opened up my everyday I try to check my youtube comments it's just a small little testing what else was here I got a comment one day of go said thanks brother Jesse I fasted three days and
