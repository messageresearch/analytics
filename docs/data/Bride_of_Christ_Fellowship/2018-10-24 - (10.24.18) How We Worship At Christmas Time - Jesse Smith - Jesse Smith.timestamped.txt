[24:39] interested in all nature you know we
[24:41] know that so we're very thankful for
[24:44] that Haven god bless you
[24:46] numerous oh yeah we also had a good
[24:48] testimony from sister Brenda or from
[24:51] sister Karen for sister Brenda I think I
[24:54] sent it to most I send it to you sister
[24:55] Connie okay I'm sorry I what I meant to
[24:58] send it to everybody
[24:58] Oh sister Karen sent me a text and said
[25:03] after service on Sunday night Brenda
[25:07] went into a spell so we were out there
[25:08] Karen asked me to pray for her and she
[25:11] would I was just tapping her but she's
[25:12] like staring for word didn't say nothing
[25:14] and Karen said that's what happens when
[25:17] should go through a seizure and she
[25:18] won't remember Brenda won't remember
[25:19] things for like 24 or 36 hours so she
[25:23] asked me to pray and of course me a lot
[25:24] of good faith you know because of the
[25:25] worship on when Sunday night you know a
[25:28] lot of faith after watching each other's
[25:31] feet and taking communion but she said
[25:34] she talked to Brenda on the way home and
[25:35] she remembers feeling an episode of
[25:39] coming on of a seizure then suddenly
[25:42] felt a loud whoosh that was pulling away
[25:45] from her and she woke up she said it
[25:47] felt like angel wings so after Amon and
[25:51] I we joined hands and we prayed and I
[25:53] said amen I just slowly opened my eyes
[25:55] all of a sudden I was kind of shocked
[25:56] because Brenda just went like that and
[25:58] that's what she was talking about she
[26:00] spent like that and then she started
[26:01] talking all about Jesus I mean and then
[26:04] but then on the way home she didn't even
[26:06] remember talking to me after service
[26:08] it's almost like God woke her up and
[26:10] that God started letting all these
[26:11] blessings flow out of her she was
[26:13] speaking face she was telling me what a
[26:15] blessing I was to her her spiritual life
[26:17] and all these things it was really
[26:19] glorious and she said a thought like
[26:22] angel wings I believe God touched her
[26:24] and will continue to have faith for a
[26:25] complete healing thank you for praying
[26:27] God is truly a miracle working God so
[26:30] let's thank the Lord for that
[26:31] praise God that's the best part we
[26:36] realized that we're not here just
[26:37] ourselves but Christ is here because if
[26:40] we're just here that can that's a lodge
[26:42] but if he's here then it's really having
[26:45] church amen so we're thankful for the
[26:47] Lord Jesus Christ you know who else no
[26:49] one can do that but Jesus so we're
[26:51] thankful for God's mercy okay then we
[26:55] have a numerous numerous prayer requests

[33:25] it our all
[33:30] in Jesus name we press or on and on in
[33:46] Jesus name we press oh dear Lord with
[34:01] the prize
[34:04] it is plea before our eyes we find the
[34:16] string to press or
[34:24] dear Lord with the prize you are with
[34:29] the prize it is before we fight to press
[34:47] oh boy
[34:53] thank you look you can find some
[34:58] strength tonight by God's grace compress
[35:00] on a man let's say on the read our
[35:02] Bibles here praise guys go to Colossians
[35:05] chapter 2 I like to preach a little
[35:11] sermon off our regular topics I know
[35:14] I've been doing that lately but I just
[35:17] kind of feel led to do it I'd like to
[35:20] just preach a little bit on Christmas I
[35:22] want to follow up with you on that I
[35:23] know it's a little early but I don't
[35:25] know about you but I celebrate Christmas
[35:26] every day I thank God for the blood of
[35:29] Jesus Christ every day well that's part
[35:31] of Christmas because you can't have
[35:32] Calvary without Jesus birth so I want to
[35:35] call this message how we worship at
[35:37] Christmas time I just want to share with
[35:39] you how my family worships how brother
[35:41] branham talked about it and I just want
[35:43] to bring the way that we feel led you
[35:46] know I haven't preached this actually
[35:47] since 2006 so it's been 12 years since
[35:51] I've preached on Christmas because after
[35:54] I laid it down at the beginning of the
[35:56] church I just thought well everybody
[35:58] gets it you know everybody understands
[36:00] it I never really revisited it so I just
[36:03] thought I'd revisit it a little bit
[36:04] today and I told brother Simon you know
[36:07] brother Simon preach a little bit on it
[36:09] and I said right before the sermon I
[36:11] sent him a text and said you know I'm
[36:13] gonna preach on that tonight follow up
[36:15] with it if you like to hear you know
[36:16] what I believe about it I know obviously
[36:19] he and I differ a little bit on it which
[36:22] is fine we're brothers we love each
[36:24] other that man brought me the message
[36:26] you know I always be eternal grateful
[36:28] for him and this is what I believe
[36:30] honestly I believe Christmas is just a
[36:32] Christian Liberty so I want to just read
[36:36] that just from the
[36:37] Colossians 2:16 and 17 which means a
[36:41] Christian Liberty is an act of God a
[36:44] choice God gives you and if you do it it
[36:47] doesn't make you any more holy if you
[36:50] don't do it it doesn't make you any more
[36:51] holy it's an area of Liberty so it's not
[36:54] like a command it's not a sin it's just
[36:57] a human action and inside of that the
[37:02] only the main thing we have to do is
[37:04] make sure we just don't judge other
[37:06] people praise the Lord so Colossians
[37:13] 2:16 and 17 if you're there say Amen let
[37:17] no man therefore judge you in meat or in
[37:19] drink or in respect of an holyday
[37:24] brother branham over and over calls
[37:26] Christmas a holy day a holiday or of the
[37:31] new moon
[37:32] we don't keep new moons but Jews would
[37:33] so Jewish Christians would or of the
[37:39] Sabbath days we don't keep actual
[37:40] Sabbath day like a Saturday but Sunday's
[37:44] our Sabbath day so for Christians the
[37:46] Sabbath day is built into their regular
[37:48] Christian experience the first day of
[37:50] the week should be worship according to
[37:52] Acts chapter 20 and that should be a day
[37:54] where you don't work if you possibly can
[37:56] I know some of us do so Connie don't
[37:57] feel bad about that you know sometimes
[37:59] you don't have a choice but if you had a
[38:01] choice on Sunday would you work but you
[38:04] can't sometimes you just can't help it
[38:06] right brother here sometimes you can't
[38:08] help it
[38:10] but it's not a law it's not a law
[38:13] anymore like well if you work on Sunday
[38:15] you're going to hell it's not a law
[38:17] anymore
[38:18] but it's a day that we want to set aside
[38:21] if we possibly can to worship Jesus that
[38:24] whole day if you can verse 17 now look
[38:29] look at this which are what a shadow of
[38:32] things to come but the body is Christ so
[38:37] no matter what holy days you keep well
[38:39] this days this was brother Rams birthday
[38:41] you know April fourth or what was April
[38:42] 6 this is such a holy day for me it
[38:45] might be for you or maybe it was the day
[38:49] brother Branham got married October 23rd
[38:51] just yesterday you know such a holy day
[38:54] for me yeah whatever day oh brother man
[38:57] died on Christmas Eve that's just such a
[38:59] holy day for me well it might be for you
[39:01] and even all the new moon days or the
[39:04] Sabbath days well you know I fast every
[39:07] Saturday night from sundown to sunset
[39:09] you know whatever you know all these
[39:12] things were shadows of something greater
[39:15] and that something greater is a person
[39:17] that's Jesus Christ all these liberties
[39:21] all these areas of liberties and then
[39:24] all these shadows they're all supposed
[39:26] to point us to one thing that's Jesus
[39:28] Christ go to Romans 1413 let's read that
[39:32] there'll be our last scripture here
[39:38] Romans 1413
[39:40] and this is the main thing for me now
[39:42] again brother Simon or someone else
[39:44] might feel different about this than me
[39:46] but this is the way I look at it I
[39:49] believe it's a Christian Liberty whether
[39:51] people do certain traditions for
[39:54] Christmas or not to me it's a it's a
[39:57] area of Liberty as long as it doesn't
[39:59] involve sin does ever understand if
[40:02] you're sinning of course that's not an
[40:04] area of Liberty sitting and drinking
[40:08] drunk and present swapping just for the
[40:11] pressure we'll get to that just because
[40:13] you feel pressured to buy it well if I
[40:14] don't buy them a gift they're gonna hate
[40:16] me that's a sin you know that's it we'll
[40:19] get to that but but it just giving a
[40:21] gift is not a sin that there's nothing
[40:23] wrong with that it's the spirits that
[40:26] are motivating you to do it that's sin
[40:29] Romans 14 13 let us not therefore judge
[40:32] one another any more but Judge this
[40:35] rather so listen we got one thing to
[40:37] judge about Christmas or Easter
[40:38] Thanksgiving we got one thing to judge
[40:41] that no man put a stumbling-block or an
[40:45] occasion to fall in his brothers way
[40:47] that's the one thing we got to make sure
[40:49] that Myles my choice is about Christmas
[40:52] my choice is about Easter that they
[40:55] don't cause somebody to stumble that's
[40:57] the main thing we got to do let me
[40:58] understand let's bow our heads for a
[41:00] word of Prayer us again ask the Lord to
[41:02] help us here Heavenly Father Lord I just
[41:04] felt burdened to preach
[41:05] Lord I sure appreciate my brother in the
[41:08] flesh and the spirit who preached his
[41:09] thoughts Lord and he was so gracious and
[41:11] so respectful I appreciate that and I
[41:13] just felt Lord led of your spirit to
[41:15] kind of revisit this again it's been 12
[41:17] years Lord God oh my and father I'm just
[41:21] grateful Lord to have 12 years to serve
[41:22] you so Lord just give me grace Lord God
[41:24] to preach this the way that you've
[41:27] revealed it to me Lord by the dictates
[41:29] of my conscience Lord I believe I'm born
[41:31] again and I believe I searched the
[41:33] Scriptures daily I believe Lord I have a
[41:36] gift to rightly divide the word of truth
[41:37] so help me Jesus and help each one of us
[41:41] to judge this rather that we do not put
[41:44] a stumbling block or an occasion to fall
[41:46] in our brother's way and we'll be happy
[41:49] Lord as we seek your face tonight in
[41:51] Jesus Christ's name the church said Amen
[41:54] god bless you bein seated praise the
[41:56] Lord I know this might not be a shouting
[41:58] message you know how like Sunday morning
[42:00] I was shouting hallo all over Sunday
[42:02] morning but thank God and God vindicated
[42:06] it was sister Connie's testimony their
[42:08] praise God but it's more along the lines
[42:13] of teaching you know because we need to
[42:15] take all these things back to the Word
[42:18] of God so I like to begin with that
[42:25] thought how Christian Liberty is is
[42:31] something that God gives us that we make
[42:34] a choice and we have to we have to
[42:37] decide whether we're going to do an
[42:39] action or not
[42:40] now the Bible gave us those clear
[42:43] definitions how many know that meat
[42:46] eating is a Liberty it's not a sin to
[42:50] eat meat thank goodness cuz I sure like
[42:52] meat and when God came in flesh and A's
[42:55] in Abraham God Abraham told Sarah go
[42:57] kill the calf and feed it to God right
[43:01] and God ate the calf God ate meat so
[43:04] there's nothing wrong with me eating of
[43:05] course or drink or now drink of course
[43:10] is wine so let me go through each one of
[43:14] these in my book which is almost done by
[43:16] God's grace of God Terry's I just
[43:18] contacted the
[43:19] national designer and she'll start in
[43:21] three weeks she's so busy she has to
[43:22] wait three weeks and it'll take her
[43:24] about six weeks to finish so it'll
[43:25] probably release right about the
[43:28] beginning of 2019 so I'll be so happy
[43:30] I'll tell you that I'll be so happy you
[43:31] don't know how happy I'm gonna be after
[43:34] putting six years of work into that
[43:35] thing you don't know how happy I'm gonna
[43:37] be I'm gonna be happy because I think it
[43:39] can help people around the world that's
[43:41] why I'm doing it
[43:42] but anyways in that book I take a little
[43:44] bit of a chapter and teach on this meet
[43:47] was an area of Liberty because there was
[43:51] a lot of meets the Jews couldn't eat and
[43:53] remember Paul wrote this in the time of
[43:55] transition where they're transitioning
[43:56] from law to grace so there's there's a
[43:59] transition time in there and so even
[44:02] Peter remember an accent even Peter God
[44:04] chose him a vision of all these animals
[44:06] in a sheet and God said rise Killiney
[44:09] and Peter said no Lord three times and
[44:12] God says don't call uncommon what I've
[44:16] called clean and so there were such a it
[44:20] was such a difficult mindset to go from
[44:22] from law to grace and it was so much so
[44:26] that Paul had to write a letter about it
[44:28] and he said if you just eat herbs only
[44:32] be happy about that if you want to eat
[44:34] meat have to be happy about that he said
[44:36] but the one thing to do if there's
[44:38] Christians around you and you're at a
[44:41] restaurant in a public place and you eat
[44:43] meat that was sacrificed to an idol if
[44:45] you eat that meat and the weaker
[44:47] Christian sees you do that and somehow
[44:50] that eating meat would cause that person
[44:51] to go worship that Idol he said then you
[44:54] wounded their weak conscience all right
[44:57] so that was the only thing with me that
[44:59] we really got to be cared about and also
[45:01] to make sure we don't eat blood from a
[45:02] strangled animal is that's in the book
[45:05] of Acts as well so this is gonna be just
[45:08] you know kind of more like a teaching
[45:11] here is everybody with me today so
[45:13] that's me you we have areas of Liberty
[45:16] with me eating you can be a vegetarian
[45:19] you can be a omnivore whatever you want
[45:21] to be you can be either one but the main
[45:24] thing to do is not eat not drink blood
[45:27] or you know a animal that was strangled
[45:30] and then also
[45:32] not to eat meat if you saw it was
[45:34] sacrificed to an idol now that's not
[45:36] really gonna happen in our country but
[45:38] Wendy after I preached it a while ago
[45:39] Wendy sent me pictures from Hong Kong
[45:41] and they do that
[45:43] it's Philippines people do it all over
[45:45] the world to their false gods they will
[45:47] have parties and though and they'll put
[45:49] up all their their gods their idols and
[45:50] then they'll invite their friends with
[45:52] meat and it and they'll have meats and
[45:54] these mate meats were sacrificed to the
[45:56] idols so that's something we can't
[45:58] relate to but Wendy can other people can
[46:01] where they they they they sacrifice meat
[46:04] to gods and then they eat it and have a
[46:06] feast well thank God we're not a part of
[46:08] that amen we've got enough Devils of our
[46:11] own to fight in America we've got enough
[46:13] devils over here let alone more idols
[46:17] around the house you know we got we got
[46:18] the idols in the house of the football
[46:20] game on Sunday you know and the
[46:21] basketball game on Sunday night and all
[46:24] these nonsense like that where they're
[46:26] suckers they're having cookouts for that
[46:28] it's the same thing just a different
[46:29] spirit so that's how I first want to say
[46:33] this is my revelation I feel like God's
[46:36] given me there's areas of Liberty now
[46:40] wine is them is one of the most serious
[46:42] ones because if you drink wine and it
[46:45] causes somebody to go get drunk because
[46:47] you did it irresponsibly the Bible said
[46:50] you sinned against Christ now drinking
[46:54] wine in this church is not going to
[46:55] cause anybody to go get drunk unless
[46:57] when I give you the cup you just chug
[46:59] the whole thing now that's never
[47:01] happened in 12 years I've been pastor
[47:03] but if someone showed the whole thing in
[47:05] it that's the kind of sounds that
[47:06] religious but then ask me for another
[47:08] cup I'd say you're wrong you know you're
[47:10] off the word you're a glutton or
[47:12] something like that so see there's
[47:15] really no way as we know we chuckle but
[47:17] that would never happen to search I
[47:20] never let that happen
[47:23] but if somebody goes out to Carabas or
[47:27] even Chipotle they have beer Chipotle or
[47:30] if somebody goes out at the Olive Garden
[47:32] a Christian a messege believer and
[47:34] orders wine to drink in public and then
[47:37] another message reliever walks in said
[47:39] oh brother Jesse's got wine now I don't
[47:41] do that but let's say it was me cuz I
[47:43] don't want to use you I'll just use
[47:44] myself oh he has one
[47:46] well I guess I can go order my Chipotle
[47:48] and buy some Coronas afterwards and if
[47:51] they're so weak in the faith that they
[47:53] slam a Corona then they slam another
[47:54] they go get drunk and they die in a car
[47:56] accident
[47:56] guess who's responsible guess who loses
[47:59] their reward I do so see that's the
[48:04] important part about wine is that so for
[48:09] me in my house we don't drink any wine
[48:11] in our house we only drink wine at this
[48:13] house because I don't want my children
[48:16] see me sipping some wine
[48:19] you know I'm feelings kind of know if
[48:21] you're sick that's different then you
[48:23] would tell your children and I know
[48:24] people that do that when they're sick
[48:26] they'll have a little wine because it's
[48:27] proven effective and they've got doctors
[48:30] advice to do it and they do it and they
[48:32] try not to do in front of their children
[48:33] and their children are very godly they
[48:35] scream in the spirit they shout in the
[48:37] spirit I've seen him dancing the spirit
[48:38] I've seen him cry in this spirit I've
[48:40] seen their children worship so this this
[48:43] brothers handed it really well and he
[48:45] says he get he takes a little wine for
[48:48] his stomach's sake just like the Bible
[48:50] says and so that's an area of Christian
[48:53] Liberty now what I'm telling you though
[48:55] as a pastor is that you better be very
[48:57] careful how you use wine because it's so
[49:00] easily addictive right so you better
[49:03] better be careful and that's the area of
[49:06] Liberty the Bible says so right there in
[49:09] Colossians chapter 2 now to me the holy
[49:13] day listen here is what I would apply to
[49:16] Christmas okay because the Bible doesn't
[49:22] say we should all gather on December
[49:25] 25th and have a church service the Bible
[49:29] doesn't say that cause the Bible says
[49:31] that the Saints gathered on the first
[49:33] day of the week to worship so we gather
[49:38] on the first day of the week Sunday
[49:40] that's the first day of the week for us
[49:42] and that's why we worship in Acts
[49:44] chapter 20 where though the Bible said
[49:46] they took offerings Paul preached on the
[49:48] first day of the week so because they
[49:50] met on Sunday that's why we meet on
[49:52] Sunday it's the honor of the
[49:53] resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ
[49:55] also we know that but whether you
[49:59] worship on
[50:00] on Christmas December 25th or Easter
[50:03] we're never here I know with the word
[50:05] Easter is a pagan word I try to use the
[50:07] word resurrection day I try to just use
[50:10] that more and more I don't believe it's
[50:12] a sin to say the word Easter cuz brother
[50:13] Branham didn't say that
[50:15] the Bible doesn't say that now the bible
[50:17] does say the word Easter because it was
[50:19] a pagan feast that's why I try to use
[50:22] the word resurrection day more like
[50:24] especially at work they'll say what are
[50:25] you doing for Easter well I say well for
[50:27] Resurrection Day I'm preaching or
[50:28] something like that you know we're gonna
[50:30] have a carry in or something you know
[50:32] after after a resurrection day whatever
[50:34] I I just try to say the name Jesus or
[50:36] point to the resurrection but to me
[50:39] that's just an area of Liberty I don't
[50:41] believe you're sinning if you say Happy
[50:42] Easter I don't believe that's the sin
[50:43] brother Branham said that a couple of
[50:45] times so let me uh let me go to you know
[50:55] I'll just go to my why don't I just skip
[50:57] to my what you're asking I'll just skip
[51:00] to some quotes our brother Brandon how
[51:01] about that so you know I kind of had a
[51:04] different few outlines in my mind here I
[51:06] wrote them down but let me just let me
[51:08] just go to some quotes here and you get
[51:11] you to see this here now traditions now
[51:15] you and I know this and with any
[51:17] tradition with any Liberty we cannot had
[51:21] any sin to any Liberty because then it
[51:24] automatically makes it not a Liberty it
[51:26] makes it a sinful act and you know Santa
[51:30] Claus and the Easter Bunny are all lies
[51:33] from the pit of hell can you say amen to
[51:36] that never events that never teach your
[51:39] children Santa Claus never teach them
[51:41] Easter bunnies never tell your child a
[51:44] lie never lie to your children never lie
[51:49] to your children never lie to anyone of
[51:52] course don't lie to the pastor huh don't
[51:54] lie to the song leader don't lie to
[51:56] anybody because program
[52:02] program even tells us this in the church
[52:03] age book he talks about Santa Claus and
[52:05] bunnies at Easter where'd they get that
[52:08] they got it from the pagans and made it
[52:10] a part of the Church doctrine but when
[52:13] someone turns to the Lord and is filled
[52:15] with the Holy Ghost he ceases from all
[52:18] such things so see that's one proof that
[52:21] you're born again you just hate any lie
[52:24] anything that even lies anything that's
[52:26] even for you no lies and nonsense like
[52:28] that anything that takes glory away from
[52:30] Jesus you hate it because the love of
[52:33] God's in your heart all right so Santa
[52:37] is a lie and brother I don't know if you
[52:39] knew this but brother Ram said in 1959 I
[52:41] done growed away from that so brother
[52:44] Ram used to celebrate Santa Claus or
[52:46] used to talk about senator senator Claus
[52:48] he said I done growed away from that
[52:50] aren't you glad he grew away from that
[52:53] he grew now maybe he was talking as a
[52:55] child we don't even know really from the
[52:57] quote but he said I growed away from
[53:00] that so maybe as a child he believed in
[53:02] it and then he grew away from it so he
[53:06] says it's important
[53:08] he says if I tell my boy a lie then I'm
[53:12] a liar
[53:15] so true now all these other traditions
[53:19] like a Christmas tree now now here's
[53:24] what I'm going to tell you about a
[53:24] Christmas tree I believe a Christmas
[53:26] tree is an area of Liberty as well
[53:29] personally my family does not put up a
[53:31] tree but I'm not going to condemn people
[53:33] that do I've known very fine godly
[53:36] Christians that put up a Christmas tree
[53:37] and I'm not going to condemn them for
[53:40] doing that and you know why because
[53:42] brother Brandon put up a Christmas tree
[53:44] and if anybody had the Holy Ghost it was
[53:48] brother Branham because he was the star
[53:51] right and there's seven stars I remember
[53:53] that
[53:53] I preached 80 sermons on the church ages
[53:56] seven there were seven stars in the hand
[53:58] of Jesus and one of those burning fiery
[54:01] stars was William Marion Branham and in
[54:05] his house at Christmas time you would
[54:08] have found a Christmas tree but for me I
[54:11] can't do it I've read the history
[54:16] I don't know I just can't do it my
[54:18] parents put one up when I was a child I
[54:20] can't do it especially because of
[54:22] Jeremiah chapter 10 let's go to Jeremiah
[54:24] chapter 10 now this is not saying a
[54:27] Christmas tree but to me it just sounds
[54:29] so much like a tree I just can't put up
[54:31] a Christmas tree and church don't get me
[54:35] wrong I'm not locking people who do I'm
[54:37] not I I respect them I'm not just I
[54:42] laugh about it because I just can't do
[54:43] it it just makes me laugh I'd to me it's
[54:46] just my conviction I can't do it but
[54:48] Jeremiah chapter 10 look at verse 1 hear
[54:52] you the word of Lord I'm sorry which the
[54:55] Lord speaketh unto you O house of Israel
[54:57] thus saith the LORD learned out the way
[54:59] of the heathen and be not dismayed at
[55:01] the signs of heaven for the heathen are
[55:04] dismayed at them for the customs of the
[55:06] people are vain now custom of course is
[55:08] a tradition just like remember remember
[55:11] the Bible said Abraham taking Hagar was
[55:15] a custom so that was just something they
[55:18] did for us it's not a custom right thank
[55:21] God you know he could have extra wives
[55:23] and things like that
[55:24] handmaids like Jacob they could have
[55:26] their Haran maids and maidens and things
[55:28] like that extra wives it was a custom
[55:32] but the custom of the people are vain
[55:34] for one cutteth a tree out of the forest
[55:36] the work of the hands of the workman
[55:37] with the axe they deck it with silver
[55:40] with gold they fasten it with nails and
[55:42] with hammers that it move not they are
[55:45] upright as the palm tree must speak not
[55:47] they must need to be born because they
[55:49] cannot go be not afraid of them for they
[55:52] cannot do evil and either also is it in
[55:54] them to do good okay so I'll just stop
[55:58] right there so there must have been one
[56:00] pagan practice that closely resembled
[56:04] Christmas tree and this was 600 years
[56:06] before Christ
[56:08] Jeremiah was written 600 years before
[56:10] Christ so because of that and B plus I
[56:14] can't see I just can't see any relation
[56:16] to a tree you know being close to Christ
[56:20] I just don't put up a tree brother Simon
[56:23] also preached a tremendous message on
[56:25] trees if you don't remember that we got
[56:27] it on on the computer
[56:29] and he showed how any tree that was cut
[56:34] down was actually a curse tree and
[56:37] remember Jesus had to be cut down he had
[56:40] to take on the curse so the only way you
[56:44] know this is just my thought the only
[56:46] way like a tree could even be spiritual
[56:48] is like okay well we went out we cut
[56:51] down this tree and it represents how
[56:52] Jesus was cut down and then Jesus was
[56:54] crowned with glory and honor like to me
[56:57] I'm just I'm just grasping for straws on
[56:59] that like that to me that's not the only
[57:01] way if you thought to me that a
[57:05] Christmas tree could be something good
[57:07] but to me I can't do it because of this
[57:10] I just I can't do it but brother Simon's
[57:13] showed that every tree that's a godly
[57:15] tree outside of Christ was supposed to
[57:18] never be cut down because the Bible said
[57:20] he's like a tree that's planted by
[57:22] rivers of water
[57:23] hey man whose leaf doesn't wither
[57:26] remember we look at that on Sunday whose
[57:28] fruit he bringeth forth fruit in in his
[57:30] season his fruit doesn't wither so again
[57:34] you may do a tree and that's fine that's
[57:38] wonderful I mean that's fine for
[57:40] wonderful for you not for me that
[57:43] doesn't do anything for me
[57:46] so program says this now listen in 1953
[57:49] brother Branham said how my how I can't
[57:52] understand how where our rabbit has
[57:54] anything to do with the resurrection no
[57:56] sir or how a Christmas tree has anything
[57:58] to do with the birth of birth of Christ
[58:00] it's pagan friends so a 1953 brother
[58:04] branham called it pagan and then seven
[58:07] years later 1960 he said he had a tree
[58:10] in his house so he said I got a little
[58:14] boy small enough you have to kind of
[58:16] want a Christmas tree and we had it in
[58:19] the room he says and this morning I go
[58:22] into the tree I found several gifts from
[58:24] my church here that makes me laugh
[58:28] because brother Randhawa he was growing
[58:31] right as a Christian was he growing in
[58:35] the statue forever man or was he perfect
[58:36] the day he got the Holy Ghost he was
[58:39] growing he had to grow in the armor of
[58:41] God he had to grow
[58:43] in the fruits of the spirit and the
[58:44] church said so seven years he said it's
[58:47] pagan friends seven years later he says
[58:49] what we got a Christmas tree cuz Joseph
[58:51] wants one so see Church if the light if
[58:57] the messenger of the hour could have a
[58:58] tree I'm not gonna condemn it but to me
[59:01] also I think of as Jeremiah 10 also I
[59:04] think of him is my childhood when I
[59:06] spent all that time decorating the tree
[59:08] and there was if we had if my dad had a
[59:10] job that year there was president her
[59:11] under there if not I just had
[59:13] flashlights under there because the the
[59:15] church gave us flashlights you know for
[59:17] Christmas because we are so poor so to
[59:20] me a tree doesn't mean anything but if
[59:23] you like to put it up when I just
[59:24] suggest if you'd like it well then sing
[59:26] to Jesus while you put it up whatever
[59:28] traditions you do just try to get
[59:30] something spiritual out of it that's
[59:32] what I would suggest now some of these
[59:36] other ones I preached years ago we don't
[59:37] talk about like mistletoe that's from
[59:39] Hell you know who of course nobody would
[59:41] ever discourage kissing you know kissing
[59:43] is like a precursor to fornication so
[59:46] you wouldn't want to put up a mistletoe
[59:48] in your house you know that all these
[59:49] Christmas trees and all these traditions
[59:51] they all go back to evil people you know
[59:55] I don't I don't have that history
[59:56] memorized but they all go back to the
[59:58] Druids or you know a couple thousand
[1:00:00] years ago evil people it all goes back
[1:00:03] to that but I just want to try to try to
[1:00:06] show you by the Bible and by the quotes
[1:00:08] how we worship at Christmas time okay
[1:00:16] now let me uh let me read a few more
[1:00:21] here okay so tell the truth all right
[1:00:23] brother Brandon I said you had a tree
[1:00:25] growing up all right let's go over this
[1:00:29] here okay let's
[1:00:34] gift-giving we look at a few quotes on
[1:00:36] gift-giving Bram says may the great
[1:00:42] gifts from the Christ be poured out upon
[1:00:43] the people tonight that belong to the
[1:00:46] body not a package sealed up not with
[1:00:48] Christmas presents in it as the earthly
[1:00:50] beings can give to each other in
[1:00:51] appreciation of our love to each other
[1:00:54] some other have said we give each other
[1:00:56] gifts and appreciation well I appreciate
[1:00:58] you brother
[1:00:59] I appreciate you sister but he said may
[1:01:01] a heavenly gift be given also and really
[1:01:04] as that's where I'm going
[1:01:06] as you know brother Bram said there only
[1:01:08] is one Christmas gift in the world and
[1:01:11] that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:13] brother Branham said there really are no
[1:01:16] real Christmas gifts other than being
[1:01:18] born again of the God of God Almighty oh
[1:01:22] I know yeah glory there's really only
[1:01:25] one all the other things we just do as
[1:01:28] tradition they're just liberties now
[1:01:35] this is a 19
[1:01:36] I ain't brother Ram said it's the
[1:01:37] greatest present that we could ever give
[1:01:39] he's speaking of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:40] I'm sorry of ourselves to God oh of
[1:01:43] course you give your friend's Christmas
[1:01:45] presents that's good that's tokens so a
[1:01:50] program says it's good to give people
[1:01:52] gifts as long as it's done the right way
[1:01:56] brother Branham said I received some
[1:01:59] mighty fine Christmas presents a movie
[1:02:01] camera and many other things guns and
[1:02:03] things that people love me
[1:02:06] they give me how I appreciate that now
[1:02:09] here's one thing I want you to know to
[1:02:10] people that don't give gifts one thing
[1:02:12] that they need to know too is that
[1:02:13] brother Branham never told people don't
[1:02:15] give me gifts if he was somehow moving
[1:02:17] away from Christmas which some people
[1:02:19] may believe he was which is fine they're
[1:02:21] there they're able to believe that he
[1:02:24] never told them to stop he always
[1:02:26] thanked them for giving gifts in fact
[1:02:28] the second to last sermon brother
[1:02:29] Branham preached leadership he ended the
[1:02:31] sermon by thanking people or a woman for
[1:02:33] giving him chocolates for Christmas so a
[1:02:36] week before he died he's thinking I'm
[1:02:37] saying sister thank you for the
[1:02:39] chocolates I appreciate that
[1:02:40] he said Merry Christmas so he never like
[1:02:44] moved away from it and started
[1:02:46] condemning any of these liberties can I
[1:02:49] just call them that liberties their
[1:02:50] customs or liberties or traditions as
[1:02:53] far as I can find he never moved away
[1:02:56] from that brother may have said I wish I
[1:03:02] could give Christmas presents to
[1:03:04] everyone I can't do it you know how it
[1:03:08] is how many feel that way I feel that
[1:03:10] way
[1:03:11] I wish I could give Christmas presents
[1:03:12] to everybody remember last year when I
[1:03:15] gave out those gift cards for Christmas
[1:03:17] that's my way of giving a gift everybody
[1:03:19] I'm cheap you know I wish I could give
[1:03:22] you something better that's about all I
[1:03:23] can do for Christmas and I feel like
[1:03:26] brother Branham I wish I could do it for
[1:03:28] everybody he said but I can't do it
[1:03:31] you know how it is did you know in 1961
[1:03:36] brother Branham gay brother Neville a
[1:03:39] coat for Christmas and you know why he
[1:03:43] said
[1:03:44] brother Neville you was neat in that
[1:03:45] coat he says so you must had an old
[1:03:48] ragged coat on he walk in the church as
[1:03:50] a pastor every man says I'd like to get
[1:03:52] him a new coat for Christmas so program
[1:03:55] went out bought him a coat and gave it
[1:03:57] to brother Neville did you know brother
[1:04:04] Branham always said Merry Christmas to
[1:04:05] the people back here to quote he said I
[1:04:07] want to wish you the merriest of
[1:04:09] Christmases he says he's the good
[1:04:13] evening friends I just got in a little
[1:04:14] while ago and I thought I would come
[1:04:15] down and wish you all a Merry Christmas
[1:04:19] now let's get to the evil part of
[1:04:21] swapping gifts which I said earlier if
[1:04:23] you are swapping gifts just to get gifts
[1:04:28] now you've got us a greedy spirit on you
[1:04:31] why no brother Aaron gives good gifts
[1:04:33] I'll make sure I get him a new cooking
[1:04:36] set I'll make sure I spend $40 on him
[1:04:43] this year because I know he gives good
[1:04:46] gifts he's got a lot of money you know
[1:04:48] and that awful people would think that
[1:04:53] swapping gifts and here's the part where
[1:04:58] where I struggle it's with the pride
[1:05:00] aspect for example like if somebody
[1:05:03] gives you a gift
[1:05:04] I feel so prideful like oh I better get
[1:05:05] like I feel awful if I don't give them
[1:05:07] something back I don't know if you feel
[1:05:09] that or not my wife's not that way we're
[1:05:11] talking about last night you know she's
[1:05:12] like oh I just feel happy they gave me
[1:05:13] gifts I'm like I can't feel that way if
[1:05:15] somebody gives me a gift
[1:05:16] I feel like indebted to them like well
[1:05:18] I've got to get you back let me write
[1:05:20] that down you know and if I did that it
[1:05:23] would drive me crazy because I have so
[1:05:26] many people I need to repay especially
[1:05:29] around Christmas time for all the the
[1:05:30] parents of all my students I get
[1:05:32] probably 40 or 50 gifts every Christmas
[1:05:34] and so sweet of those people and God
[1:05:37] bless them for that but if I'm not if
[1:05:40] I'm not careful
[1:05:41] that'll make now drive me crazy I'll
[1:05:43] feel indebted to them and that what is
[1:05:44] that that's pride I think he well I'm
[1:05:47] too good and I don't need gifts you know
[1:05:50] I don't know don't give me gifts you
[1:05:53] know now I'm indebted to you that's
[1:05:55] pride
[1:05:56] remember there's only
[1:05:57] three channels is less divides pride of
[1:05:59] life and less of the flesh there's only
[1:06:01] one of those it's you know every sin is
[1:06:04] one of those and so that's the pride of
[1:06:06] life I'm so prideful I don't need your
[1:06:08] gift sir I don't want you to give me
[1:06:10] gifts
[1:06:11] Bertram's said if each one of us if each
[1:06:18] one of us can last night all this
[1:06:19] Christmas tinsel quit all this swapping
[1:06:21] gifts one another all this nonsense of
[1:06:23] the world and just take off our pride
[1:06:25] and lay it down and stop the thing
[1:06:28] underfoot and say Lord Jesus give me
[1:06:30] that perfect light see people but member
[1:06:35] church there's nothing wrong with giving
[1:06:37] somebody gift but if your whole attitude
[1:06:39] is oh this is gift swapping time I'm
[1:06:41] gonna give so I can get back that's the
[1:06:43] wrong attitude
[1:06:45] that's a remember so that's a sinful
[1:06:47] attitude that's a prideful attitude but
[1:06:52] man some people today got no room for
[1:06:53] Jesus under their tree he said they're
[1:06:59] under their tree they got a big box of
[1:07:01] beer somewhere they've got a deck of
[1:07:04] cards for Mama no room for Christ but
[1:07:07] there's room for cards he said there's a
[1:07:09] little g-man book or comic book or
[1:07:11] something like that no room for Jesus so
[1:07:16] any gift you give somebody if it causes
[1:07:18] them to sin you are sinning and look
[1:07:22] what people have made Christmas so gifts
[1:07:27] shouldn't be worldly obviously all right
[1:07:37] brother Brad
[1:07:38] was it a commercial day he says but we
[1:07:41] have tryst he said but Christmas should
[1:07:42] be a day of worship how do you believe
[1:07:44] it's a day of worship it isn't my house
[1:07:46] Christmas is a day worship we start
[1:07:49] first by having Christmas breakfast and
[1:07:52] Kristen cooks the best Christmas
[1:07:54] breakfast I've ever had I wish I had
[1:07:56] enough food too might all of you over
[1:07:58] but then she'd be worn out she have to
[1:08:01] stay up all night but then after that we
[1:08:05] read the Bible we all gather around we
[1:08:08] have like a little hutch which is like a
[1:08:09] drawer you know dresser kind of drawer
[1:08:11] thing and the kids set up a it's a
[1:08:15] fisher-price nativity set I mean it kind
[1:08:18] of you if you squeeze them they kind of
[1:08:20] squeak I think because the family bought
[1:08:22] them for me years ago we didn't buy them
[1:08:24] a family bought it for me for Christmas
[1:08:25] one of the parents from school so we
[1:08:28] just set it up and you know you the kids
[1:08:29] like the little kids like to go around
[1:08:30] and play you know with with the camels
[1:08:32] and and all that the animals you know
[1:08:35] the wise men and so we just gather on
[1:08:38] there and then we'll read the chapter in
[1:08:41] Luke chapter 2 or Matthew chapter 2
[1:08:43] about the Magi or we'll read the whole
[1:08:46] chapter and after that we'll sing a few
[1:08:48] Christmas carols you know what you're
[1:08:50] not I don't really like to say Christmas
[1:08:52] carols because they're worship songs
[1:08:53] their worship oh come let us adore him
[1:08:56] that's my favorite Christmas Carol oh
[1:08:58] come let me adorn Jesus Christ the Lord
[1:09:01] amen
[1:09:01] for he alone is worthy Christ the Lord
[1:09:04] that's worship amen hallelujah and then
[1:09:08] for that then we'll open up the gifts
[1:09:10] everybody gets three gifts you know a
[1:09:12] clothes a toy in a book everybody gets
[1:09:14] three that's the way we can actually pay
[1:09:16] for you know if not we couldn't pay for
[1:09:18] it so we got a limit than the number of
[1:09:20] gifts after that the kids play with it
[1:09:22] you know and we'll do Bible of course
[1:09:24] we'll still do Bible time and prayer
[1:09:25] time that day so it's a day of worship
[1:09:28] it centers around Jesus Christ but we
[1:09:32] have said Christmas should be a day of
[1:09:33] worship but we have twisted around and
[1:09:36] made it one of the greatest commercial
[1:09:37] days and it's all fixed up on passing
[1:09:40] presents one to another and having your
[1:09:42] feelings hurt if we don't do it and pay
[1:09:45] them back it's just all twisted up he
[1:09:47] says and that's exactly me if I if I'm
[1:09:50] not careful it will become like oh I got
[1:09:52] to pay my
[1:09:52] my brother's wife backer I gotta pay
[1:09:55] back my sister or I gotta I gotta pay
[1:09:57] them back and it's not to be that day
[1:09:59] it's to be a day of worship praise God
[1:10:03] now you know what the word commercial
[1:10:05] means by Marisa is a commercial day the
[1:10:07] word commercial means a day of financial
[1:10:09] profit so if Christmas to you is all
[1:10:13] about my look at all the gifts I'm
[1:10:15] getting you just made it a commercial
[1:10:17] day
[1:10:17] oh my you know I can I can sell these
[1:10:21] things for Christmas you know I could I
[1:10:23] can do real good for Christmas now don't
[1:10:25] get wrong if you are if you're a
[1:10:25] business owner yeah you have to make
[1:10:27] money you have to you have to sell
[1:10:30] things to make money but you don't want
[1:10:32] the emphasis on that day to be all about
[1:10:34] money you have the f-insas to be on
[1:10:36] Jesus Christ that's right
[1:10:42] Milda have said it's not a celebration
[1:10:44] it's a worship praise God all right now
[1:10:52] let me see brother man brother man was
[1:10:55] really sensitive to create a children at
[1:10:57] Christmas
[1:10:58] did you know brother branham wouldn't go
[1:11:01] preach places around Christmastime
[1:11:02] because he knew that money that the
[1:11:05] people in the church would take their
[1:11:07] money from the Christmas gifts and give
[1:11:08] them a brother branham so he's like well
[1:11:11] I'll come but not a Christmas time
[1:11:12] here's where he says in 1959 so the
[1:11:15] reason I don't because if I go to
[1:11:17] another meeting mothers and daddies will
[1:11:20] take from their pocket to support the
[1:11:21] meeting and maybe the little fellows
[1:11:24] would miss something at Christmas and
[1:11:26] that make me feel awful bad see so I'll
[1:11:30] come back after Christmas Wow Wow
[1:11:37] he was so sensitive to children getting
[1:11:39] something good for Christmas he says I
[1:11:42] won't come around Christmastime because
[1:11:44] I know mom and dad they're gonna give me
[1:11:46] an offering or something like that but I
[1:11:48] want I don't want them to miss a gift
[1:11:49] for Christmas
[1:11:57] yeah that's right no he says he talks
[1:12:06] about Christmas he said now we don't
[1:12:08] want to deprive the little fellows but
[1:12:09] you can't tell that to little children
[1:12:11] he's talking about how Christmas is
[1:12:13] gambling and drinking and carousing just
[1:12:15] peg into the limit he says but you can't
[1:12:18] tell those children things like that
[1:12:20] they see the little fellows on Christmas
[1:12:22] night getting Christmas presents and
[1:12:23] things like that they don't understand
[1:12:25] and they're Dolittle and we've got to
[1:12:27] remember them that they are they have
[1:12:29] things in common we've got to bring
[1:12:31] ourselves down to remember them little
[1:12:33] fellas they themselves the RAM says
[1:12:38] they're for little kids you have to let
[1:12:40] them have something but always be sure
[1:12:45] this tell them there's no such thing as
[1:12:46] Santa Claus so this is mother bear's
[1:12:49] idea like Christian children are gonna
[1:12:51] be around non-christians and see them
[1:12:53] getting presents and see them dressing
[1:12:55] up for Halloween and all these things
[1:12:57] they see them getting candy and and
[1:13:01] they're gonna feel bad that they don't
[1:13:03] get to do that so that's why I told my
[1:13:04] Taekwondo master last night I said I
[1:13:06] said sir we don't do Halloween but you
[1:13:08] can sure believe I'll give my children a
[1:13:10] lot of ice cream
[1:13:13] yeah Lydia knows I do I treat them to
[1:13:16] sugar Aaron treats in the sugar mercy
[1:13:22] amen treat him to sugar ice cream
[1:13:25] sandwiches so yeah they don't get to go
[1:13:28] trick-or-treating but you know where
[1:13:30] trick-or-treating comes from
[1:13:31] trick-or-treating comes from teenagers
[1:13:35] that were so idolatrous in the days of
[1:13:37] the Celts that they would they were so
[1:13:39] poor they would go to the rich people's
[1:13:41] houses and knock on the door and say if
[1:13:43] you don't give us food we're gonna curse
[1:13:45] you in the name of our God migaila
[1:13:48] because I've got the video I can show
[1:13:50] you the video and the history behind
[1:13:51] that
[1:13:52] that's where trick-or-treating comes
[1:13:53] from it's so awful that's where it comes
[1:13:57] from door to door begging these poor
[1:14:00] poor teenager's begging the rich people
[1:14:02] for gifts or they're gonna bring curses
[1:14:05] and they would actually burn out in the
[1:14:06] rich people's houses if they didn't give
[1:14:07] them something that's where
[1:14:09] from and now you want to dress up your
[1:14:11] kids as a trick-or-treat smell my feet
[1:14:14] give me something good to eat and you
[1:14:15] wanna dress them up like that they're
[1:14:17] gonna turn out to be a bunch of pagans
[1:14:18] right and teach them evil Rhymes and
[1:14:22] stuff like that
[1:14:23] oh it's awful that's where that trash
[1:14:26] comes from in church remember this
[1:14:29] brother Branham gave gifts all all
[1:14:32] through his whole life one of the one of
[1:14:35] the final sermons he preached well just
[1:14:37] as they find him but one of the sermons
[1:14:38] he preached in 65 was birth pains and
[1:14:40] then after that he preached this day the
[1:14:42] Scriptures fulfilled I remember that and
[1:14:44] in the story brother Branham would not
[1:14:47] have even preached this day the
[1:14:48] scriptures were filled had his wife not
[1:14:50] bought him a brand new Scofield Bible
[1:14:52] for Christmas and the pages got stuck
[1:14:56] together and brother Branham couldn't
[1:14:57] find his text remember that and he got
[1:15:01] all nervous and the Catholic priest
[1:15:02] comes up in the hands of the Bible and
[1:15:04] said be careful or be call my son God's
[1:15:07] moving here because his wife bought him
[1:15:11] a Christmas gift a brand-new Scofield
[1:15:13] Bible and you know the story behind that
[1:15:15] brother Branham brother ram realizes
[1:15:18] it's a priest giving him a Bible in the
[1:15:21] house of God saying this day's the
[1:15:23] scriptures fulfill birth pains and
[1:15:26] brother Branham likens that brother
[1:15:28] Branham preaching birth pains was
[1:15:29] exactly what Jesus was preaching except
[1:15:32] Jesus preaching the open door when the
[1:15:34] priest came and handed him the scroll he
[1:15:37] opened the scroll said read the scroll
[1:15:38] and said this day this scripture is
[1:15:40] fulfilled amen
[1:15:42] so the whole way that the whole thing
[1:15:45] that allowed this to happen was a
[1:15:47] Christmas gift and a Bible that had
[1:15:50] pages stick together amen so jesus said
[1:15:56] this day the scripture is fulfilled
[1:15:57] which was the day of mercy brother
[1:15:59] Branham comes along said this day is
[1:16:01] this scripture fulfilled in other words
[1:16:03] we're entering into the day of judgment
[1:16:05] where this earth is going to bring forth
[1:16:06] birth pains all because of a Christmas
[1:16:10] gift God used the Christmas gift brother
[1:16:17] Branham said
[1:16:18] now don't forget these jerseys are born
[1:16:19] quotes he's doing the altar call at the
[1:16:23] end of a Christmas sermon he said it's
[1:16:26] Christ in you God dwelling in the human
[1:16:29] heart that's what the real Christmas
[1:16:31] means he says all right what did I miss
[1:16:40] it okay
[1:16:41] oh yeah he said this is a real sacred
[1:16:42] hour I'm sorry I lost my spot so there's
[1:16:49] many times brother Branham says
[1:16:50] Christmas is the sacred hour he said
[1:16:53] it's too bad the world has taken away
[1:16:55] the sacredness of Christmas so in other
[1:17:00] words brother Branham as a man as a
[1:17:03] Christian looked at December 25th and to
[1:17:06] him with his Christian Liberty it was a
[1:17:09] sacred day in other words he would treat
[1:17:12] it reverently respectfully he would
[1:17:14] worship he'd give his children gifts he
[1:17:17] would receive gifts from people thank
[1:17:19] them to him it was a sacred time now to
[1:17:22] other people it might not seem like a
[1:17:24] sacred time but even if they don't think
[1:17:26] it's sacred the one thing they should do
[1:17:28] is they should respect people who do
[1:17:30] think it's sacred that's right now we
[1:17:35] know of course Chrisman has Christmas
[1:17:36] has so many pagan roots we've been we
[1:17:38] went over that last night at Taekwondo
[1:17:39] heberto we were talking about that we go
[1:17:42] over it every year at Christmastime in
[1:17:43] the third sorry in the fourth century
[1:17:45] the Emperor Constantine this is all
[1:17:47] history you can read it if you want he
[1:17:49] saw all the pagans memory he just
[1:17:50] converted to Christianity which it
[1:17:52] wasn't a real conversion he had just saw
[1:17:54] the pagans worshipping on December 25th
[1:17:56] because that was the birthday of their
[1:17:58] son gods all the names of their son gods
[1:18:01] you can name him asteroth the son too I
[1:18:03] forget all the names now but he thought
[1:18:06] well the way we can win them over is
[1:18:08] instead of letting them have that day to
[1:18:10] themselves we will worship Jesus on
[1:18:13] December 25th and invite them into our
[1:18:16] celebrations
[1:18:17] so that was Constantine's way and that's
[1:18:20] always the Catholics way to do things is
[1:18:22] to mix lies and truth but the way of the
[1:18:25] Christian is always to separate lives
[1:18:27] from truth
[1:18:28] and that's even history - there's other
[1:18:31] Catholic priests that were known to do
[1:18:32] that the early Catholics they would
[1:18:34] always mix some of the pagan religion
[1:18:37] with their religion to try to get them
[1:18:39] to accept it and over years and over
[1:18:42] decades and over lifetimes they would
[1:18:44] just start doing the traditions they
[1:18:46] just got used to it and then Christmas
[1:18:49] became a conglomeration of all these
[1:18:51] pagan ideas so as Halloween so has
[1:18:55] Easter it's just become a mixture of all
[1:18:58] these pagan things mother Branham said
[1:19:06] at Christmastime it's so sacred he said
[1:19:08] I consecrate myself for this Christmas
[1:19:10] not as the world would do or to turn new
[1:19:15] pages Lord
[1:19:16] I just want to accept your son I want to
[1:19:18] accept your gift Lord the Christmas was
[1:19:21] a time of consecration and I'll say like
[1:19:23] this church really Christmas is really
[1:19:25] not a time of more consecration for me
[1:19:28] than any other time I try to if I'm free
[1:19:31] if Christmas on a Sunday I try to fast
[1:19:33] just like I do on it at any other Sunday
[1:19:36] you know it's not really a more time of
[1:19:39] consecration to me all the days are the
[1:19:41] same every day should be consecrated to
[1:19:43] Christ amen now but but that's just me
[1:19:48] then I maybe I preach that too hard I
[1:19:49] don't want to sound like I'm bashing
[1:19:51] somebody that that thinks that day is
[1:19:53] more special I mean that day may be more
[1:19:55] special to some people but what I mean
[1:19:57] is I want to respect that but to me I
[1:20:00] think every day's holy to me I I try to
[1:20:03] consecrate every day right we try to
[1:20:07] make every day special like I told you
[1:20:09] every time I thank God and my children
[1:20:11] will tell you every time I pray at the
[1:20:12] table every time I pray at Bible time I
[1:20:15] always thank God for the blood of Jesus
[1:20:16] Christ and in doing that I'm thanking
[1:20:19] God for sending his son to lie in a
[1:20:21] manger amen glory because you can't have
[1:20:24] this without that day men and program
[1:20:27] said the same thing but the RAM said
[1:20:31] Christmas is a great holiday and that's
[1:20:33] a quote great holiday not an awful
[1:20:37] holiday he said it's a great holiday
[1:20:39] it's a sacred time for us
[1:20:44] now I guess I could say this year I
[1:20:46] guess I could say this I guess Christmas
[1:20:48] time could be a little more consecration
[1:20:50] because what I do is when we wrap the
[1:20:52] gifts every year either my wife rive if
[1:20:54] I have enough energy I'll draw Christmas
[1:20:56] pictures on there like I'll get my Bible
[1:20:57] or I'll get my phone and I'll type in
[1:20:59] like Mary and Joseph and I'll get a
[1:21:01] picture on my phone you know and I'll
[1:21:04] sit there and I'll try to draw that on
[1:21:05] there and we'll write scriptures on
[1:21:06] right Lydia Malachi will write
[1:21:08] scriptures on the wrapping paper so we
[1:21:10] just used plain wrapping paper and I get
[1:21:13] my little artist pen out you know nice I
[1:21:15] started trying to excite you to like to
[1:21:17] draw I don't draw anymore cuz I don't
[1:21:19] have time I wish I could I'd rather
[1:21:21] write books you know in my free time but
[1:21:24] that so so to me so maybe that might
[1:21:27] mean I'm more sanctified or consecrated
[1:21:30] cuz I'm spending more time thinking
[1:21:31] about the things of God now as time is
[1:21:34] going on we've had more gifts oh my
[1:21:35] drawings get less and less detailed you
[1:21:37] know so but the point being that that
[1:21:40] there could be a possibility you know I
[1:21:41] consecrate more during that time or I
[1:21:44] spend more time meditating perhaps Laura
[1:21:47] have said no sir no this is not a pagan
[1:21:50] celebration to us this is a sacred hour
[1:21:59] alright it ought to be a solemn day of
[1:22:03] worship to God instead of heartache and
[1:22:05] a headache see if all the gift-giving of
[1:22:08] all the putting up trees if that causes
[1:22:10] heartache or headache we shouldn't do
[1:22:11] things that do that this should be a
[1:22:13] time of worship alright okay now one
[1:22:24] thing
[1:22:25] her brother sent really like this this
[1:22:27] is a quote from brother branham did you
[1:22:29] know that God allowed Christmas to be
[1:22:31] celebrated even though he allowed it to
[1:22:33] be moved to December 25th which we know
[1:22:35] it's not that day brother branham said
[1:22:37] it's still God's way to make them praise
[1:22:42] God did you know that so what I mean is
[1:22:47] this like even men like Donald Trump or
[1:22:49] sinners or people who don't know God or
[1:22:51] you know or any man you name it Steve
[1:22:54] I'm sorry uh Tim Tim Cook any
[1:22:57] billionaire you know who every one of
[1:23:00] those guys I'm sure take Christmas off
[1:23:02] and they don't work that day and brother
[1:23:05] branham said by doing that God is making
[1:23:08] all men praise Him brother Ram says that
[1:23:11] he says this in 1956 now God to make all
[1:23:15] things praise him we are celebrating the
[1:23:18] Christmas birth of the Lord Jesus which
[1:23:21] isn't just exactly his birthday his
[1:23:23] birthday was in April because it's just
[1:23:25] as cold in Judea or colder in December
[1:23:27] than it is here
[1:23:27] did you catch that so when when when the
[1:23:31] world went when they put it on the
[1:23:33] calendar December 25th that is God's way
[1:23:36] of letting all the nations recognize
[1:23:38] that he sent his son whether they
[1:23:41] recognize it or not whether they believe
[1:23:43] it or not God is allowing them by
[1:23:45] putting it on the calendar
[1:23:47] God's forcing them to deal with it and
[1:23:50] when they stop and when they don't work
[1:23:53] that day or they take that day off and
[1:23:55] get drunk or whatever it's still a
[1:23:56] witness against him on the day of
[1:23:58] judgment that they stop to honor the
[1:24:01] Lord and instead of honoring them they
[1:24:03] actually defame the Lord that's right
[1:24:06] God to make all things praised and that
[1:24:10] was one of the most powerful quotes I've
[1:24:11] heard on it okay
[1:24:18] now like I said you could take weeks
[1:24:21] weeks and just preach on Christmas I
[1:24:22] don't want to do that I just want to
[1:24:23] take one day I just want to take one
[1:24:25] message on it okay
[1:24:29] now here's what I want to say here's the
[1:24:33] part so listen carefully here's the part
[1:24:35] I want you to watch with any Christmas
[1:24:37] tradition that you have make sure you're
[1:24:41] not greedy and covetous wanting gifts
[1:24:43] that's a program called gift swapping
[1:24:46] commercial day oh this is the time I'm
[1:24:48] going to finally catch up on my finances
[1:24:50] and I'll get some more gift cards I can
[1:24:51] catch up you know that's the wrong
[1:24:53] attitude that's looking at other people
[1:24:55] for your supply rather than God it's
[1:24:57] your supplier we need to look at Jesus
[1:24:59] Christ so we don't want to be greedy or
[1:25:02] covet just one thing gifts from others
[1:25:05] we also don't want to be prideful
[1:25:07] feeling like we have to give gifts to
[1:25:09] everybody and we have to match to the
[1:25:12] amount they gave well he gave me a $20
[1:25:13] gift card I got to give him $21 to top
[1:25:16] him because that's the pride of life
[1:25:21] here's another one I mentioned if you go
[1:25:24] to Christmas parties especially family
[1:25:26] parties be careful what you eat and
[1:25:27] drink
[1:25:29] the Bible says be temperate all things
[1:25:32] so for example we don't want to get
[1:25:34] drunk of course but we also don't want
[1:25:36] to overeat and be a glutton in front of
[1:25:38] our family is that a good Christian
[1:25:40] testimony my brother Jesse can really
[1:25:43] put down those those soda pops mine and
[1:25:46] he's over there belch and burping
[1:25:47] watching the football game can you
[1:25:49] imagine that that would be a backslidden
[1:25:52] preacher if I ever seen one but I don't
[1:25:57] do that and the times I've gone to my
[1:25:59] family's on Christmas if they're
[1:26:00] watching TV and you can ask my children
[1:26:02] I ask them to leave the room I don't sit
[1:26:05] there and watch that that's nonsense
[1:26:07] because let your moderation be known
[1:26:10] unto all men everyone should know how
[1:26:13] much self-control you have because I'll
[1:26:16] tell you it's easy with the big screen
[1:26:19] to kind of sit down and talking pretty
[1:26:20] soon or husband off the children and
[1:26:23] pretty soon give me another doctor
[1:26:31] because you can't get your eyes off that
[1:26:33] thing
[1:26:34] you understand it's so seductive it's
[1:26:39] it's so it's so much a pleasure to the
[1:26:42] flesh you really got to be careful a
[1:26:44] family event that's me now I'm talking
[1:26:46] to me I'm preaching to me that's why I
[1:26:48] despise many times or I shouldn't say
[1:26:50] despise I should save it that's why many
[1:26:52] times I regret and I really don't want
[1:26:54] to go to family parties because it puts
[1:26:58] so much pressure on the children they're
[1:26:59] just children they you know they want to
[1:27:00] see if it's Frosty the Snowman or
[1:27:03] something like that now thankfully we
[1:27:05] usually don't travel for Christmas
[1:27:06] thankfully but in the years we have it's
[1:27:09] always been such a battle and it's an
[1:27:11] area I just don't enjoy I don't enjoy
[1:27:14] going to places where there's big screen
[1:27:16] TVs because these eyes get tempted to
[1:27:19] church
[1:27:20] these eyes that's hard for me I've got
[1:27:23] to make sure I've got to make sure I
[1:27:24] always put good things before my eyes
[1:27:26] I'm a man just like anyone else
[1:27:28] so the lust of the flesh or the lust of
[1:27:31] the eyes we got to make sure we don't
[1:27:33] get into that we're like if it's your
[1:27:37] work party and they start putting on
[1:27:38] dance you know rock and roll you want to
[1:27:40] go out there and dance you know to rock
[1:27:41] and roll or something like see there's
[1:27:43] that temptation
[1:27:44] the Bible says avoid all parents of evil
[1:27:46] if you possibly can we should avoid all
[1:27:50] appearance of evil and of course we said
[1:27:53] it earlier kissing under the mistletoe
[1:27:54] and all this kind of stuff and here the
[1:27:59] and here's the one thing I want to make
[1:28:00] sure too brother Branham said I never
[1:28:02] did steal anything in my life
[1:28:04] other than one thing does anyone know
[1:28:05] what he stole but the RAM said I stole
[1:28:10] God's time in other words instead of
[1:28:15] giving his office time to Christ he
[1:28:17] spent his time on Sunday mornings
[1:28:19] washing his ford remember that he said
[1:28:22] how many souls cuz I could I been saving
[1:28:24] on Sunday mornings before he was a
[1:28:26] Christian uh he said I stole God's time
[1:28:28] God gave me all this time but I was
[1:28:30] investing in it too shining my Ford on
[1:28:32] Sunday mornings while giving my Ford a
[1:28:34] car wash and so see that's what I'm
[1:28:37] saying like if you're putting up a tree
[1:28:39] if you're wrapping all these gifts you
[1:28:42] should leave have Christian music honor
[1:28:44] something like that to kind of redeem
[1:28:46] the time so like let's say let's say uh
[1:28:49] you know family spends two hours you
[1:28:51] know putting up the Christmas tree well
[1:28:53] how much time do they read the Bible
[1:28:54] that day do they even read the Bible you
[1:28:56] know but see if you got Christian music
[1:29:00] on and you're singing and put up a tree
[1:29:02] well that's fine you know that's fine or
[1:29:04] have a sermon on a brother branham you
[1:29:06] know you can put the one on where he
[1:29:08] talks about having a tree you can listen
[1:29:10] to that sermon so see that's the thing
[1:29:14] you also want to watch with even
[1:29:16] Christmas parties or family parts we
[1:29:18] spend all these things all these time at
[1:29:19] parties but are we given God time so we
[1:29:23] got to watch that but see that's why I
[1:29:25] love when Christmas falls on Sunday or
[1:29:27] not you know if it falls on Sunday I'll
[1:29:29] never skip Church this is God's house
[1:29:31] Christmas is all about God why would you
[1:29:34] leave God's house when it's all about
[1:29:36] God who's more important your family or
[1:29:38] God God's more important but see it's
[1:29:44] it's it's about worship it's about yes I
[1:29:47] think it's possible you could I I
[1:29:49] worship by wrapping gifts for the kids I
[1:29:51] think say thank you Lord for these
[1:29:53] children may these books guide them to
[1:29:55] Christ may these clothes close their
[1:29:58] body modestly may they glorify Christ
[1:30:01] may these toys help them to have fun use
[1:30:03] their imagination enjoy being a child
[1:30:05] until the days come when they're an
[1:30:07] adult and all the pressures and stresses
[1:30:08] and all the responsibilities of life
[1:30:11] come rushing in on them help them enjoy
[1:30:15] being a child enjoy their youth
[1:30:17] the Bible says enjoy their youth my
[1:30:23] goodness it's a sacred hour Christmas
[1:30:26] should be a sacred time I want to make
[1:30:35] don't miss anything did you know this
[1:30:41] brother branham in 1963 the church at
[1:30:44] Browns have an act called bought brother
[1:30:45] branham a brand new suit and he thanked
[1:30:48] the church he said thank you Church I
[1:30:50] got the quarter who I just heard it
[1:30:51] today he said but you know if it's
[1:30:53] possible can I take that suit back so I
[1:30:56] can buy some undershirts he said my
[1:30:58] undershirts in a really bad condition he
[1:31:01] said is that ok so he just he thanked he
[1:31:05] thanked he thanked them for the gift but
[1:31:07] said I could actually I really don't
[1:31:08] need suits right now could got take him
[1:31:10] back and get some undershirts he was
[1:31:13] just being humid with him he was just
[1:31:16] being real and to me that's like frugal
[1:31:18] right he's being frugal which is good
[1:31:20] like that's good now if you got me
[1:31:22] something I might not tell you that cuz
[1:31:23] I might I feel bad you know I just might
[1:31:25] keep the suit or whatever but he was
[1:31:28] just so homely and so at home with them
[1:31:30] and so I had such a good rapport with
[1:31:32] them you know or maybe his MS makeup was
[1:31:34] like that where he could just speak
[1:31:36] anything you know which it probably was
[1:31:37] he said can you mind if I take this back
[1:31:39] and get some undershirts oh my that's we
[1:31:46] love about brother Brennan just a godly
[1:31:49] Christian all right let me say this - so
[1:31:53] I told you about my Christmas I never
[1:31:55] missed Church oh my wife does put up
[1:31:58] lights we decorate a little bit you know
[1:32:00] but we don't do trees so she'll put a
[1:32:02] you know on our stairs we have a stairs
[1:32:04] and we have that little post that you
[1:32:06] can put your hand on when you walk up
[1:32:07] she'll put lights around that one set of
[1:32:09] lights and then on our little deck out
[1:32:12] there she'll put one thing of lights
[1:32:13] going across the deck just because it's
[1:32:15] so dark and cold in wintertime and
[1:32:17] lights look so pretty so and that's
[1:32:22] that's all we do church that's all we do
[1:32:23] I mean we do the presents and we all
[1:32:26] right we already got some ordered I know
[1:32:27] where the hiding place is I know where
[1:32:29] they're ordered you know some of them
[1:32:30] are all ready to go and Satan Claus did
[1:32:34] not bring the presents
[1:32:35] [Laughter]
[1:32:39] mom and dad buy the presents and every
[1:32:41] time when we do it you can ask Malachi
[1:32:43] and Linda in case you every time I say
[1:32:45] these gifts like I do with on Christmas
[1:32:47] these gifts are just representations
[1:32:49] letting you know that one time God gave
[1:32:53] the greatest gift ever and that was his
[1:32:55] son Jesus Christ this is just helping
[1:32:58] you to feel and church and I remember
[1:33:00] being a child man I remember the joy I
[1:33:01] got when I opened up my GI Joe airplane
[1:33:03] I was like yeah but that joy is nothing
[1:33:08] compared to when Brenda got healed I
[1:33:10] said glory amen
[1:33:13] right so this is you can't even compare
[1:33:16] it but that helped me understand oh
[1:33:19] that's a childish thing that helps you
[1:33:22] to understand at all yes adults can get
[1:33:25] happy too I know you praise the Lord we
[1:33:29] can get happy too well we get happy in
[1:33:31] different things when I was a child I
[1:33:33] enjoyed childish things but when I
[1:33:35] became a man I put away childish things
[1:33:37] and I became a real Christian man now I
[1:33:41] got to enjoy the Lord amen so we always
[1:33:50] sing we always worship we always read
[1:33:51] scripture we draw up Jesus pictures on
[1:33:55] the gifts wrapping paper no Santa no
[1:33:57] tree that just us now Santa's a sin but
[1:33:59] trees Teresa area of Liberty at least in
[1:34:01] my opinion does that help Church does
[1:34:07] that help all right few more things I
[1:34:10] want to share here few more things
[1:34:13] that's just how we do it now like I said
[1:34:16] church you know if I'm wrong you know
[1:34:19] let me know I just don't see it wrong
[1:34:21] because I feel like if if it was such an
[1:34:23] awful thing to celebrate Christmas then
[1:34:25] why did God let brother brand do it all
[1:34:27] the way to the day he died
[1:34:29] Billy Paul and Peregrine both said that
[1:34:32] car that he got in the car accident or
[1:34:33] the other car had Christmas presents
[1:34:36] because they were driving back to
[1:34:37] Jeffersonville and he had Christmas
[1:34:38] presents in the car he was going to give
[1:34:40] to his family
[1:34:41] so it's something he did to the end of
[1:34:44] his days and he was a man that was full
[1:34:46] of the Holy Ghost all right now let me
[1:34:49] let me do this here let me go a little
[1:34:51] bit further here I want to show you the
[1:34:57] harshest quotes I've heard on Christmas
[1:34:59] and then I want to show you how they
[1:35:01] balance out and brother Simon read one
[1:35:06] of them and you know he hopefully he'll
[1:35:08] listen to this but this is just you know
[1:35:10] but he doesn't have to it's just you
[1:35:12] know we just differ on that but let me
[1:35:15] say like this Christmas if done wrong is
[1:35:18] pagan but Christmas if it's done right
[1:35:21] is sacred do you understand so like
[1:35:25] we'll get to that too but if he zekiel
[1:35:27] eight
[1:35:28] just a moment but here's though here's
[1:35:30] the most harshest quote I've ever heard
[1:35:31] on Christmas brother branham said this
[1:35:33] in 1963 December 16th he said say I want
[1:35:38] to follow Christ and I want to follow
[1:35:40] the morning star Christ I want to follow
[1:35:42] and find my Jesus this day I want to get
[1:35:45] away from all this Christmas tinsel and
[1:35:47] things because some day it's going to be
[1:35:49] burnt with unquenchable fire right
[1:35:52] how many can say amen to that amen it is
[1:35:55] trees presents the clothes have
[1:35:57] everything's gonna be burnt now look and
[1:36:01] program says and all those who are in
[1:36:03] tolerating with it
[1:36:04] that means partaking of it will be
[1:36:09] burned with it now look what do you know
[1:36:13] let's keep going
[1:36:13] the world the sinner will be punished
[1:36:17] be they will be they will perish with
[1:36:20] the world the worldly loving people will
[1:36:22] perish with the world and if you have
[1:36:24] those still have the love of the world
[1:36:26] in you and you want to sell yourself
[1:36:27] completely tonight to Jesus Christ in
[1:36:29] his word
[1:36:29] raise your hand so brother hand says if
[1:36:34] you tolerate Christmas you're gonna burn
[1:36:36] with Christmas and then he says these
[1:36:38] are this is for sinners
[1:36:44] okay that's pretty
[1:36:46] right but let's go a little bit earlier
[1:36:49] in the sermon so we understand what he's
[1:36:52] saying but the Branham says this he says
[1:36:58] the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:37:00] should be reflecting the light of him
[1:37:02] while he is absent from the earth in a
[1:37:04] physical body the church should be the
[1:37:06] reflection of Jesus Christ in these dark
[1:37:08] hours when says I keep saying Santa
[1:37:11] cause I'm gonna said Satan Claus when
[1:37:13] say Santa Claus and tinsel all over the
[1:37:15] street he said we should scream how it's
[1:37:20] the birth of Jesus Christ and not the
[1:37:23] visit of Saint Nicholas Amen brother
[1:37:27] said we should scream that out of
[1:37:28] Christmas time it's about the birth of
[1:37:30] Jesus not Saint Nicholas he said we
[1:37:36] should scream that out that was earlier
[1:37:44] in the sermon Rota have said later in
[1:37:47] the sermon he says still Christians
[1:37:51] should be holding forth that light that
[1:37:53] there's a truth to Christmas that is the
[1:37:56] birth of Jesus Christ the Son of God so
[1:37:59] brother Adam did you catch that should
[1:38:00] be holding the light out that there is
[1:38:02] the truth of Christmas not not getting a
[1:38:07] writ of Christmas but holding the truth
[1:38:08] of Christmas that Jesus Christ is the
[1:38:11] son of God now at the end of that sermon
[1:38:19] where he gave the harshest rebuke he
[1:38:21] says I am wishing you the very Mary's of
[1:38:24] Christmas that God will send his star
[1:38:27] from the east that rose in the east
[1:38:28] nineteen hundred years ago and will
[1:38:30] guide you to the Word made flesh
[1:38:42] all right I think that's what I wanted
[1:38:45] to show you in church like I said
[1:38:48] there's so many scriptures I'm sorry
[1:38:50] so that harshest quote was December 16
[1:38:52] 1963 and many of those quotes I read
[1:38:55] after you where he's thanking people for
[1:38:57] gifts or talking about giving gifts with
[1:38:59] his wife and receiving chocolates and
[1:39:02] all these things all those are after the
[1:39:05] harshest sermon or the harshest words he
[1:39:07] ever said about it
[1:39:08] so what am I saying I am saying that
[1:39:10] when brother Branham said unquenchable
[1:39:12] fire he's talking about sinners who mix
[1:39:15] Christmas with getting drunk gift
[1:39:18] swapping pride covetousness greed and
[1:39:22] envy does everyone understand what I'm
[1:39:25] saying is that when we this is what I
[1:39:27] believe when I my family celebrate
[1:39:29] Christmas we are doing Christmas in
[1:39:31] truth and not according to the pagan as'
[1:39:35] of the club the sinners and so that
[1:39:41] quote to me where Bram says they're
[1:39:43] gonna burn he's talking about sinners I
[1:39:45] know about I know I know about you
[1:39:47] you're not a sinner you're a saint I'm
[1:39:49] not enough to say well I don't know
[1:39:50] about you I know you're Saints everybody
[1:39:53] here tonight is a saint I don't know
[1:39:55] where the children is the hell that all
[1:39:56] that you understand you know I know for
[1:39:58] sure us adults were Saints you're a
[1:40:01] saint you live the life if you didn't
[1:40:03] you probably left already so see we live
[1:40:08] the life we're the saints of the Most
[1:40:11] High God and you you and I can partake
[1:40:15] in Christmas traditions liberties as
[1:40:18] long as they don't cause anybody stumble
[1:40:21] now if let me let me say this if in
[1:40:26] January of next year if the Lord tarries
[1:40:28] and someone would come to me in this
[1:40:32] church after I preached this and they
[1:40:33] would say well you know brother Jesse
[1:40:35] your sermon caused me to stumble because
[1:40:39] you do Christmas gifts and I went out
[1:40:41] and bought you know I overspent and
[1:40:43] bought three thousand dollars on
[1:40:45] Christmas gifts and I went to debt and I
[1:40:46] got I got bankrupt I might
[1:40:52] first what's wrong with you but after
[1:40:57] that I might say well I might consider
[1:40:58] not giving gifts but I have to sit down
[1:41:01] with that person in other words I don't
[1:41:02] want to cause anybody stumble
[1:41:04] I don't know how what I'm doing could
[1:41:07] cause somebody to stumble that's
[1:41:08] probably the only thing I could think of
[1:41:10] how is putting up two lights causing
[1:41:12] people to stumble I don't think it is
[1:41:14] how is putting up a nativity set causing
[1:41:17] people to stumble now if I said I was
[1:41:20] bowing down worshipping that nativity
[1:41:22] set that would be different but it's
[1:41:25] Fisher Price colored plastic and I don't
[1:41:28] bow down to that nativity set and I
[1:41:32] don't go broke on Christmas I'll show
[1:41:34] you the receipts I don't spend a whole
[1:41:35] lot of money on Christmas gifts I gave a
[1:41:38] lot more than one tithe check than I do
[1:41:40] for Christmas gifts and I'll prove that
[1:41:43] I can prove that to you if you want to
[1:41:44] see my receipts I'll prove that to you
[1:41:47] just let me know or at least in a month
[1:41:51] in one month I get more in tithes and
[1:41:52] offerings that I ever spend at Christmas
[1:41:54] time ever because those books are not
[1:41:56] very expensive neither are the clothes
[1:41:58] and the toys are usually very not
[1:42:01] expensive either and then grandma helps
[1:42:03] out with the toys but I give you my word
[1:42:05] I know with all my heart I give more in
[1:42:07] one month ties and offerings then I ever
[1:42:09] spent any Christmas time ever I give
[1:42:13] more of myself to Jesus Christ let's say
[1:42:16] into our feet here you know and I know I
[1:42:21] don't want to spend a lot of sermons on
[1:42:22] this because to me like I said it's an
[1:42:25] area of Liberty just make sure you're
[1:42:28] you and I are not causing people to
[1:42:30] stumble and especially with Christmas
[1:42:32] making sure we're not causing ourselves
[1:42:34] to stumble and children to stumble like
[1:42:36] if you buy a child a sinful toy or a
[1:42:39] sinful book with sinful things in it
[1:42:41] they're gonna turn out sinful and we've
[1:42:45] got to make sure we don't allow
[1:42:46] ourselves like I said to get trapped to
[1:42:47] sucked into family worship where we're
[1:42:49] not worshipping God or where it's
[1:42:51] worshiping the devil with either
[1:42:53] gluttony or evil movies or sports or TV
[1:42:56] shows and things like that we have to
[1:42:58] make sure we keep ourselves pure in the
[1:43:02] fear of God all right but
[1:43:04] okay now the last thing I want to say is
[1:43:06] remember about Simon preach Ezekiel
[1:43:07] eight that was an awesome awesome
[1:43:09] message there was four steps remember
[1:43:12] the four steps I don't know if you do or
[1:43:14] not the first one was the images on the
[1:43:16] outside of the church remember that the
[1:43:19] second one was I don't remember the
[1:43:23] second one oh the creeping things yeah
[1:43:25] the third one was the women weeping for
[1:43:27] Tammuz member Tamara's Tammuz was one of
[1:43:31] these son gods and so brother Simon was
[1:43:33] likened unto that how the Roman Catholic
[1:43:36] Church which that's what that story is
[1:43:39] about the Antichrist spear in the Roman
[1:43:40] Catholic Church the Roman Catholic
[1:43:42] Church worships the Sun God on December
[1:43:45] 25th and let me say like this they do
[1:43:48] but if you and I with our Christian
[1:43:52] liberties just give gifts to our kids
[1:43:53] and a couple of our friends at Christian
[1:43:55] friends we are not partaking of Tammuz
[1:44:00] because brother branham gave gifts
[1:44:03] brother branham received gifts brother
[1:44:06] branham had a tree so does everybody
[1:44:08] understand what I'm saying
[1:44:09] Tammuz that brother that brother Simon
[1:44:11] tied and that's very true if people give
[1:44:13] out whiskey if people give out deck of
[1:44:15] cards on Christmas yes they are
[1:44:17] worshipping Tammuz they're worshiping a
[1:44:21] Sun God a false God they're worshipping
[1:44:24] this false idea of pagan Christianity
[1:44:27] but if you and I on our Christian
[1:44:29] Liberty are just giving things from the
[1:44:31] kindness of our heart if it's a sacred
[1:44:33] day to us if we don't skip church on
[1:44:35] Christmas which none of you ever have as
[1:44:38] far as I know if we don't skip Church
[1:44:40] and and well we don't give our tithes
[1:44:42] and offerings so we could buy some
[1:44:43] whiskey or give get people some extra
[1:44:46] you know gifts or something like that
[1:44:48] if we don't rob if we rob God yes then
[1:44:51] we're sinning but if we don't and if we
[1:44:53] honor all the commands of God and still
[1:44:56] do some of these traditions or customs
[1:44:58] then we're not worshiping Tammis we're
[1:45:02] not partaking of that we're just
[1:45:04] enjoying Christian Liberty amen all
[1:45:08] right so church now you got a license I
[1:45:09] and I believe brother
[1:45:10] I believe brother Aaron might do this
[1:45:12] then when we go to Johnny go on
[1:45:13] Christmas time I believe brother Aaron
[1:45:15] might shout out because rubber band says
[1:45:17] we need to shout out
[1:45:18] because he's got a big deep voice he
[1:45:20] said we should scream out it's the birth
[1:45:22] of Jesus Christ and not the visit of
[1:45:25] Saint Nicholas amen
[1:45:28] I like how our brother is real bold in
[1:45:30] public I like that that's real that's
[1:45:32] that's a part of his character God's
[1:45:35] given him that he's supposed to always
[1:45:37] represent Christ everywhere he goes but
[1:45:40] church that's the reality somebody tells
[1:45:43] you Merry Christmas say Oh Merry
[1:45:44] Christmas praise God that He sent His
[1:45:47] Holy Synod eye for us that's what we say
[1:45:51] Merry Christmas thank God today we say
[1:45:55] Christ was born in the City of David
[1:45:56] just mentioned Christ just breathe just
[1:45:59] say that holy name Jesus and watch that
[1:46:02] name come on the scene amen watch the
[1:46:05] spirit of that name the Holy Spirit come
[1:46:07] on the scene thank God Merry Christmas
[1:46:12] thank God that he sent His Son Jesus
[1:46:14] Christ one right there right now you're
[1:46:16] gonna find out what they believe about
[1:46:17] Christmas whether they're on the Tammuz
[1:46:19] side or on the real side the sacred side
[1:46:22] on their unholy side are they on the
[1:46:24] holy side I believe brother Branham was
[1:46:26] on the holy side and I believe my family
[1:46:29] is on the holy side that's just that's
[1:46:32] my opinion that's my understanding to it
[1:46:36] please if you have a question feel free
[1:46:39] to ask me if you differ with me please
[1:46:41] just love me just just pray for me and
[1:46:43] love me if you disagree with me that's
[1:46:45] just what I believe and I believe I got
[1:46:46] quotes and scriptures to back that up
[1:46:48] like I said I got the scriptures about
[1:46:49] Christian liberties and all these things
[1:46:53] by the grace of the Lord all right
[1:46:58] let's sing that song o come let us adore
[1:47:01] him o come all ye faithful can we see
[1:47:03] that tonight I like singing it all
