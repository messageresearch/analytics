God [Music] I receive and I am happy all the day but drops of grief Oh [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Raisa let's send our feet here let's take our Bibles the grace of Lord will try to get right to the Word of God I like to go to Psalms 37 I'd like to just start a new series today by God's grace I told you I was going to start this series I'd like to look at Bible numerology for a few services by God's grace so look at the power of God revealed through numbers we'd like to look at that by the grace of the lord I think it'd be a blessing to you I just couldn't stop smiling the whole time I'm studying this like wow this is pretty amazing and I'd be honest I could not even scratch the surface because you can get into all the realms of nature you know plant life animal life you know you name it I'm just trying to stay with the Bible and I have I have one I mean what I mean is that you could go out into science you could find all these other numbers but I'll probably spend most of my time focusing on the God I'll probably get through numbers 1 through 3 today because there's 3 is so huge threes like the most popular number in the scripture I think but so if we could there it's a Psalms by God's grace and Psalms 37 23 we'll just read that together if we can let's begin on three one two three the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in his way amen let's just have one more word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord we've read your word the Bible says the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord there's so much order in your universe in our bodies in nature and Lord there's order in our lives and we thank you for that Lord you've ordered all these events of our lives or I think of even the Grahams Lord how you've ordered them to move to Michigan Lord and you ordered me to come to Akron so many years ago in 1999 Lord and you just ordered us Lord to do different things and different times and seasons so we thank you for that Lord let us always walk in your ordered pass Lord the perfect will of God and father just help us to understand how you reveal yourself through these numbers Lord that you've created so father we love you today speak to us we pray in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless yous being seated praise the Lord so let's look at this thought here and I'll try to keep it an hour if I keep an hour it'll be only 11 I'm sorry only 12:30 when I'm done here so that would be a new record by God's grace so let me set my watch so I don't forget and also I'd have one more one more thing I have an update at the end of the service as well I do have an update on what I shared on Wednesday night with brother Adam Bowe who left the church I shared some things on Wednesday night about that I do have a follow up to share with that brother Adam and I talked last night on the phone so I'll be sharing a little bit about that afterwards by God's grace I want to want to make sure I let you know about that it's really good news by God's grace we had a really good fellowship or a conversation yesterday so thank the Lord for that so let's look at biblical numerology how many ever interested in numerology the numbers of the Bible oh it's such a wonderful thing I was doing some searches but my main reference is II W Bollinger a preacher who lived you know there in the late 1800s you know early 1900s they someone put his book online it's called numbers in Scripture so I'm pulling a lot out of there cuz you know why reinvent the wheel you know they've he's already done all those years and wrote a whole book on numbers you know so I don't really feel like I should start from scratch and just ignore all that work that he's done so I pulled a lot of thoughts from his book there and I'm only done with you know the first few chapters and like you said like I said number three will have a lot to preach on this morning with number three but let's look at numerology define you know and as I was looking at the the actual word numerology if you don't put a biblical in front of it it has connections to the occult because if you look at Webster's dictionary numerology is the study of the occult significance of numbers because you know the common person that would would say well I'm not a Satanist you know they wouldn't worry too much about numbers but the people who spend the most time of it outside of Christians would be those in the spiritual or the evil demonic world that work operate with demons you know of course we're fighting our prayers are fighting in that demon world as well amen our prayers are fighting against those demons amen because we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against spiritual wickedness in high places huh how's your wrestling going lately you scoot wrestling in prayer amen wrestle against those demons claiming the promises of God crying out to God for victory he'll answer let's just give him some time to answer praise the Lord so the the definition I found was from cross examine org it's a that's a he's a doctorate a man who does apologetics but he defined biblical numerology as the study of how God uses numbers to indicate truth brother Branham says it a little differently as we'll seen a little bit brother Branham calls numerology how God reveals himself so it's God's way to reveal himself through numbers so brother Branham calls it God's numerology so he says three is the number of perfection we all know that three is God's number in his numerology so God has a numerology can you say amen to that God is known by his numbers so we really can't know God fully unless we know the number that he uses threes perfection 7 is worship 24 is worship 40 is temptation 50 is pentecost jubilee and so forth all of his numbers his numerals of God is perfected isn't perfection now 3 is the number of perfection so if you want to know more about God you've got to understand the numerology of the Bible the biblical numerology and we'll show some examples as we go down here now church numbers how does God deal this how does God reveal himself through numbers well numbers reveal God's loving heart because program said Heavenly Father my mind goes now to your many instances of how you have dealt with your people through many different signs of wonder sure you know where the sparrows was you said not one could fall even though two of them only cost 1/2 1/4 of a penny but how insignificant that was but yet you know the sparrow I love this you said even the hairs of the heads of the Apostles were numbered amen you know at every animal you're just all life Lord and nothing can be done except you know it you're omniscient omnipresent omnipotent you're infinite so numbers reveal God's love his caring love for us because the Bible says now remember Jesus is sending out the twelve disciples two by two he said I'm sending you out as lambs among wolves I've never dealt with wolves they try to steal your joy they try to steal your victory they try to make you lose your testimony remember Paul prayed for three years there's another three I forgot to put on there Paul prayed for three years a warning that the Church of Ephesus wolves are coming to come and wolves are gonna come in he warned them for three years because God wanted to give them a complete warning a perfect divine warning amen so God let them be warned for three years but Jesus before he sent them out he said fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell are not two sparrows sold for a farthing and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father can you imagine that when a bird falls down or when an animal dies they didn't die without the father knowing about it Omaha is God interested in his creation Church absolutely that's why you can speak to creation and if God gave you that thought creation must obey you amen that's exactly right he said the very hairs of your head are all numbered so what does he show you showing I love you so much that that I care and I'm numbered even the hairs on your head which science says there's between 90,000 and 150,000 I'll tell you my sweeper at home sleeps up about 3,000 every week I think then I'll get the scissors out you know and try to cut it off there but but God knows where each way and we just throw them in the trash but brother BAM says we'll get them back some of if the brothers lost their hair they might wish they had more you know but but you'll get them back by God's grace for you fear not either for now you are more valuable than the sparrows how many say I love you Jesus amen if animals fall and God knows about it how much more when you fall you struggle or you go through a hard time how much more does God care and God know about it you think oh well I would never send my children as a sheep among wolves but God does because God knows he will orchestrate things that and he'll make sure that there's no temptation except God makes a way of escape amen now we're not foolish and throw our children out like you know sheep among wolves we're not foolish like that but the point I'm making is that we have to have trust in the Almighty God we have to have confidence in Almighty God we must seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things will be added unto us amen program said not long ago has Coleman back these two or three hairs I got left my wife sitting back there said Billy you're just about bald-headed I said but I haven't one of them she said well were they all at tell me I said where was they before I got them they're there they're waiting for me someday I'll go to them they was every hair of your heads numbered and not one of them can be lost don't you love how God sent a prophet to us I've never heard that in anything I was raised in denomination I never heard anybody preach that but it's so true wherever our hairs came from and if we lose them they must be there waiting for us amen to come back to them but rather said these hands it used to be a little boy these soldiers shoulders that's stooping under preaching the gospel someday will spring back again to the picture man may I'm sorry made in His image stand in his likeness wash in his blood redeemed by His grace I shall stand and no fear to death amen just the very fact that Jesus said every hairs numbered just that very fact should give us such grace and no fear in life amen because if God knows every hair he knows where you're going after you leave this earth a man because he loves you so much and he cares so much if he cares for the bird if he cares for the animal how much more does he care for you and I who are in His image praise God but have said the hairs the Bible says the hairs your head is numbered not one of them shall perish there was one time there wasn't nothing and then they was and they went back to where they was before I had them so will this body be someday the calcium potash will go back but God will speak and I'll jump from the earth that's my god oh that's one jump I look forward to jumping amen a holiday I jumped allows a long jumper in high school I love to jump I would jump and dunk the basketball I love to jump but that jump is no comparison to this resurrection jump amen and God's going to get all of us a resurrection jump hallelujah these bodies will jump right out of the earth amen jump right out the dust when he called your body will answer amen glory he holds the whole world in his hands he just blows the stars off made the solar system spoke his word and it was so the very dirt that you're setting over is his word made manifest never think about that very dirt you wash off your feet God created that dirt he said it didn't where to come from the dirt that you're walking on is his word made manifest he said let there be and there was I believe every word that he said is the truth no matter how long it lingers it's so anyhow hallelujah what these hairs was before they come on me what were they before they come on me they are waiting for me and every hair is numbered and not one bit of us will be lost but I'll raise it up at the last day saith God I believe that this just as true as I believe I'm standing here you know when I was in college I had a shoulder injury and I injured it twice my AC joint they had to cut off part of my bone and there to sew it back together and now I don't have this big bump like I used to have but some of my bone was left at that hospital I don't know if they burn it I don't know what they did with it but according to this and according to Jesus Jesus said I'll raise you up and that's every part of you if you've lost any part think of the amputee think of the person who's had lost body parts and so forth the jesus said I'll raise you up and brother man said he's not going to drain just partial up he's gonna raise all of you up amen so that bone I lost is coming back by God's grace amen I believe that for Jesus and all that the father has given me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out so I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the Father's will which has sent me that of all which you have given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone would see at the Son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and I will raise him up at the last day he repeats it again so you have another witness another testimony that God is going to raise you up glory and he's not done he's the third time no man can come to me except my father which has sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day it is written the prophets and they shall all be taught of God every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the Father cometh to me but as it were only made of 16 elements that's petroleum potash cosmic light so forth so that God gets its in the earth and he will just call it again and I'll answer that's right I believe that I believe that with all that's in my heart and soul of mine I solemnly believe it over this Bible if I die over in the next few minutes I believe that that he called you believe that this morning if you die and whatever happens he will call for your body and it will come forth amen he said every head of your heads numbered nothing will be lost every hairs numbered nothing will be lost I'll raise that but the last day he either give it to me now can't he give it back to me by a promise if he gave you something and you lost something can he give back what was lost he said if he can't make me what I am without a choice I'm sorry if he can't make me where I am without a choice how much more can he make me back by a choice by taking him Roy I feel religious now to know that we're coming a resurrection and will be restored and alike again like he showed Abraham their notice jesus said that that was God manifested in a human flesh amen Church we know that our footsteps are years even our words and even our names are all numbered they're all numbered God has a specific number for them Almighty and gracious God who's a prayer answering God a father that knows all as children has need of you notice before we were born and you have our footsteps numbered the very hairs of your head are numbered and our words are all weighed in that balance so Lord God let us this morning to do things this solemn obligation that we have before thee you know I really like this watch when I first got it about two years ago and one reason I liked it was because it counted my steps I like to look down and say oh by 7000 steps today thousand steps but you know this is just an imitation of what God is doing already in heaven I know yeah let's see they're just picking up of what God has already done because the footsteps of the righteous are ordered and counted and determined by the Lord amen every single one of them our words are waiting the bound so look what the Bible says there shall nothing cast their young nor be barren in thy land the number of thy days will I fulfill so God promises Israel you will have every day to the full promise I gave you in the promised land there wouldn't be one day less there wouldn't be one day more and the bottom said so teach us the number our days that we may apply our hearts on their wisdom how many we say Lord teach me to number my days help me not to forget that I'm mortal that I just have a short time on earth that my life is like a vapor and I want everything in my life to manifest and declare that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I just have a short breath of life and let everybody who know my life everybody that saw that that vapor of life may they say that life was to glorify Jesus amen teach us the number our days and realize we don't have as much time maybe as we thought we have we all have an appointment with the Heavenly Father the Bible says it have a little physical strength you might get 10 more years now we know again this is a probability this is not a promise it's a probability because Jesus only got 33 years and if anybody deserved a full life on earth it was Christ so the days of our years are threescore years and ten seventy and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years yet is their strength labor and sorrow for it is soon cut off and we fly away now we know Church that you know if we exercise or eat well or take care of ourselves and get enough rest we know you may add a few more years to our life but we must not strive to have to have more for ourselves selfishly we've got to say god I'm going to take care of this temple because taking care of this temple glorifies you but we shouldn't say well I gotta live til I'm 90 or I got a live-time 100 I gotta live to know it's not us who determines the days it's God who determines the number of our years and you I hope you learned a lesson from Hezekiah Hezekiah throughs of hands of the wallet said give me 15 more years God gave it to him and he wasted those 15 years and we preach on that recently on a Sunday night if you remember that we preach on life struggles life's battles he wasted he squandered 15 more years and the Bible said it would have been better if he had just died earlier 15 years earlier and gone when God wanted him to go how many one to go and God wants them to go and I hope I hope for all of us that when God wants us to go it's all the same day our second and minute at the first resurrection amen that's all we're living for that's what we're preaching for to be the bride of Jesus Christ to fulfill the rapture scriptures to meet Jesus Christ in the air and to hear the last chomp amen glory that's what we're living for that's what we're dying for that's what we're doing everything in our power to do is to meet Christ in the air at the return of the Lord amen so you say well I'm gonna live till I'm 100 well good but you got to make sure that's how long God wants you to live right we don't want to be rebellious we don't want to rebel against the Lord we don't want to be selfish like Hezekiah was in the last little bit of is life we all want to be selfish we want to just say Lord and your time make everything beautiful Lord just take me when it's your time to take me amen that's exactly right see even your days are numbered your kingdom Babylon was numbered it says and this is the writing that was written main a main a tech go up hare Shen I'm definitely saying that right this is the interpretation of the thing men a God hath numbered thy kingdom and I've finished it see every kingdom has a number of days a number of years that it's going to to exist we know you know David ruled for 40 years I remember that Solomon ruled 40 years I've been pastoring 12 years and I I just my mind after wonder Lord how many years am I gonna be here pastoring you know I want to do all the years that God has given me praise God God has determined the numbers of our lives and our ministries all that he's called us to do and see even a name has a number let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it's a number of a man in his number of six hundred threescore and six Vic areas Philly Day right in God's stead and so even names have numbers now that's not the direction I'm taking this service but I'm sure there is a whole study on that you can find numbers if you take the Roman numerals the different names you can find numbers but what this made me think of as my personal testimony of God calling me to preach and receive the message and I'll just share this real quick in 2002 shortly after I came in the message a brother named Bill Tyler who was attending brother broaches church sent me a letter of encouragement showing the similarities in my life to the number 11 my football number was 11 my weight on the website Akron's website was 191 which adds up to 11 my current weight I just had my physical last week is 11 - I've lost a little bit of weight since college there are September 11th attacks made Simon go to the message Bible study so we could the endtime message I receive the message in the 11th month of the year and I was born in the 11th month of the year do numbers have a meaning Church so here's his letter I'm not going to read all of it but he said wow I was on the website he said I just want to encourage you you know I didn't know you were number 11 so that's what he saw on the website that ugly guy there and so I was 191 back in 2002 and there's my picture I've always been drawn to number 11 I always wondered why do I like 11 so much well the Bible says that Jesus went out into the vineyard and he found workers at the third the first our third our right six our ninth our but he goes one more time he goes one more time he didn't have to because it kind of breaks the types of the three right three hours 6 hours 9 hours 12 hours he kind of broke the type a little bit and he went out at what hour the 11th and so you know the scripture in Bible times the 11th hour was 5:00 p.m. evening time glory 6 a.m. was the first hour because there was broken up into two twelve the 24-hour day was broken up into two twelve six a.m. was the first hour 9:00 a.m. so this worker goes out at 6 a.m. goes at 9 a.m. noon 3:00 p.m. and for some reason he goes I think I better go out at the eleventh hour he kind of breaks the type it's kind of out of order does anybody understand that understand that 11:00 is kind of out of the ordinary pattern of God and that's because brother Branham said this was a type of the end time he said now hold it he said what the 11th hour people could come in so Jesus said hold it so the 11th hour people could come in the last calling of the Gentiles huh me no brother Ram said the 11th hour workers are the Gentile bride and we know that mother worked there dad worked there grandmother worked back there this is our age the 11th hour that world war stopped the 11th month in the year the 11th day of the month the 11th hour in the day the 11th minute in the hour that he said that the 8th I'm sorry that the 11th hour people might come in receive the same baptism in the Holy Ghost they did back there at the beginning to bring back the power and the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ with the same sign in wonders hey man remember this is from the BBC website but you can find it on history.com you can find it on every history reference this is people celebrating in London at the end of the war so World War one ended at 11:00 a.m. on the eleventh day of the eleventh month in 1918 not 1911 I thought it was 1911 but that's one extra 11:00 that we did we didn't have I made a fool myself one time it was in 1911 someone told me no it's not night I so forgive me Lord Germany signed the armistice that had been prepared by Britain and France so this is the first world war ended on 11:00 a.m. on November 11th 11th month 11th 11th day 11th hour and they still don't know you can look it up they still don't know why ended at that time they don't know somebody chose it well I know chose it God chose it God put it upon them those hearts of the Germans to sign that the deal there of the peace treaty God did that because God was showing I'm going to make one more call before this old history is finished I'm going to give the 11th hour workers a chance to work in my vineyard amen program says this you noticed November 11th 11th o clock in the day of the eleventh month in the year the eleventh day in the month and eleventh hour in the day you remember then what Jesus said about that so Matthew 20 the parable of the $11 worker is all about this day Jesus was talking about this day the final call and I always wondered why I like number 11 brother bang I'm not sure why I liked it so much but now I know it's a part of me it's a part of my calling it's God revealing himself to me praise God that's what numbers do in your life they reveal to you God's call for your life amen 1 1 2 at one time one got a penny the next one went that was $11 people what was that right there they were the 11th hour people it's been held back now it's getting time for them to come in and they're gathering out those Jews for a nation now the 7th angels message is to open the mystery of the seals calling calling write of Christ fellowship in Akron amen is that right the Gentile workers see God once workers today how many want to work for God God doesn't want sinners God wants workers amen we're supposed to be working in the vineyard of the Lord amen gentle workers to receive the same pay that the first our workers got Jesus taught it he said there was some people's went to the harvest they were hired when they did have a early morning they received a penny for a day than at noontime someone else come in and went to work and then the eleventh hour that was the last hour of the day that someone come in and received the same kind of pay they did the first hour of the day the last hour it's so perfectly how the first our messengers with the word with the gospel with the truth they came in at the day of Pentecost then there was a middle age of black them out then to middle the day Luther Wesley them came in and then there's to be an evening time message and to receive the same thing they did at the beginning he said the evening time message is to restore back again to bring back that same thing again and the church said Oh in that beautiful church man now I'm not preaching on this this morning but just to give you a heads up 11 is the number of disorder kiss judgment and finality or last because of the 11th hour workers were the final call it was the last call there was no other call after that are you glad Jesus college at the end time aren't you glad Jesus came out for one more one more invitation who else wants to work who else wants to receive the message of the hour I'm glad he came out one more time because I was one of those eleven dollar workers amen and I didn't know William Rand was a prophet till I was you know 21 years old I didn't oh that but God knew there's something about him he was he's gonna labor for me he's gonna labor for one more hour out there in the heat of the day right before the evening time oh I love it I love how God shows us and reveals to us himself oh thank you Jesus so we're not preaching on that one this morning but you'll see there's so many judgements associated with number 11 in the Bible and we didn't brother man say judge what's gonna hit the west coast what day in the day of the eleventh hour workers fritzsche perfectly now before we get to these numbers 1 2 3 Satan has numerology as well I mentioned that earlier people that are in the occult you know they'll sacrifice so many animals or do so many things like that they have a they have a numerology but it's a pattern after hell I'm sorry it's pattern I'm sorry it's calling on the powers of hell but it's imitating God's numbers the example I won't get to today but is Balaam in the days of Moses God told Moses you're gonna have three major feasts and at the feast at the feast of an atonement you're gonna sacrifice seven bullocks at the Day of Atonement okay and so motor and Balaam must have heard that send Balaam before he goes to talk to God he sacrifices seven bullocks because he was copying Moses he saw Moses through something Maia I think that's a righteous man I'm gonna copy that and it worked right Balaam got in the presence of God he got thus saith the Lord but after that he had a false teaching interjected into his met in his ministry and with every false prophet they might be right prophesy but you've gotta watch their entire life you've got to watch what they teach you gotta watch what goes on after the prophecy you got to make sure the wind that smacked in the face of the wind that anointed you on the day of Pentecost that came like a rushing mighty wind you got to make sure you know where that wind came from amen so by their fruits they're know not by their first few times in the message or first few days or years of the message by their fruits they're known give them some time they'll manifest which side they're on I want to manifest that Jesus Christ living inside of me amen brother and say your name is ben hereafter you'll be called Peter now this is getting into the number of names which I said I'm not dealing with that one today he said you were saw but you're called Paul from now on how about all these names if you don't if that don't if they don't mean something or you say that's numerology the devil's got one and God's got one everything that Devils got he's patterned after God amen it's all after God like I was telling you at the movies what all these movies were they trying to uh promote they're trying to promote superheroes they're trying to promote riches they're trying to promote you ruling over something and that's all what they Satan just copying them off God because the whole the whole pinnacle of Christianity is Jesus bringing his bride back to the Garden of Eden so bride and groom can rule over all creation amen in a super power in the super power of the Holy Ghost amen it's just a it's just a perversion Satan just pattern it and copied it off of God that's why all these that's why they'll promote all these superheroes today because there's only one superhero Jesus Christ find out that your name has a bearing on your life my name means a gift in one Hebrew translation oh there's different Trenton different meanings for all of our names did your name mean light brother vain garden amen praise the Lord that's a good name hallelujah every heart is like a ground a garden right Theresa it make sure it's an honest good heart glory now find out that your name he says now I can't go too much of that because the devil has a false numerology we know that people starts feeling and so far like that which runs into spiritualism and spiritual is of the devil so see church we make sure we don't go overboard with this because you'll make yourself crazy look at all the numbers on your receipts looking at all your numbers on your whatever your emails or social security number you'll go crazy one time I got a receipt and I paid six dollars and 66 cents you know for something I just I just said Oh devil shut up you know I just threw I know where I stand I know who the devil is I know I know I know that what that Pope stands for and I know what I stand for amen see but you could go reverse it on Judas I've got a 666 I'm Judas well six dollars and sixty six cents is not 666 dollars if you want to be technical right so see you can go too far on it you go too far and if you see us 666 they praise the Lord I know what it is and I've been I've been raised up to stand against it amen I know who the enemy is I know who I'm fighting but my Jesus is 777 it's like our prophet William Eric Pratt 777 so we know God did that by God's grace but we don't make that a major because then people like if someone has six letters in their name then they'll be I'm just discouraged well six is a good number when God made Adam when God made Adam on the sixth day it was all purity he was a perfect man there's nothing wrong with six as long as you're not going off on the devil's side of six because God has a numerology and the devil has a numerology remember I showed you there are six weapons on the full armor of God why would God do six because he's a perfect man he's got all six weapons but they met he's a perfect man he's got all his weapons he's got lost gear he can defeat any foe because he's all got all of God's six weapons and defenses to knock off the devil amen but don't you know don't take it too far you know don't take it too far now watch that cane spear come right down through the scripture right on this very last day oh good I got my time left okay fundamental just as fundamentals the other one was look at the Prophet Balaam and the prophet Moses okay this is what I mentioned earlier both of them were seven altars Jehovah's altars blood on each one not only that but Rams on each one yeah I'm sorry did I say bullocks I met Rams in numerology exactly the right number seven perfect seven Rams just the lacs exactly like both altars so Satan is always going to impersonate God's true numerology as fundamental as one was the other one was also but who did God vindicate I love that see see the wound that was in his word oh thank you that's why your everyday life coming to church three times a week or how many times the answers that's why your everyday life is just as important as any supernatural experiences you have because your life proves what seat you came from amen as I've always said the most mature people I know imma share this with brother Aaron because he's new to our church the most mature people I know are those who love God the most out of their local home church because your support of your home church is the reflection of how you live your life at home if you're not faithful to the home church if you're not interested the home church that really you're slacking at home because this is our hope this is our family this is our home where we gather this is where we worship the Lord so your dedication in this church your your your attitude toward this church is a total reflection of your walk with God in your house that's exactly right that's exactly true brother band said don't you miss any service he said that the Spirit of God is in you he said they can't chain you away from coming church he said you can't wait till someone unlocks that door out there and he said if you don't feel that way it's time you got to praying amen glory see those with the revelation of the number obey the word of God Cain and Balaam disobeyed the word although Balaam had the right number a couple times and prophesied right he disobeyed the word he thought fornication was okay he he wanted to see God's people stumble no true child of God will attack another true child of God they might fall short they might make a mistake if they're a child of God they'll come back and apologize right because they're a real child of God but we know the Spirit of God does not attack the Spirit of God praise the Lord it was Ishmael who mocked and made fun of Isaac so we should be the ones being made fun of is that is that fun to be made fun of church no but if anybody's going to be made fun of it should be us so we got to be prepared for we got to be ready for we got to be prepared to be talked down upon we got to be prepared to be criticized because the Ishmael will always mock and make fun of the Isaac and I know about you but I'm a child of promise amen we must be children of the promise we believe God's promise God called us to this message God wants us to obey this message and so we must be willing to endure all the markings and the persecution we must in do it for the kingdom of God who to God vindicate the one that's with the word fundamental doesn't mean too much it's the revelation of God alright let's look at some numbers like I said we'll try to get to numbers 1 2 3 because that's really all I had time to study I mean over the years I think a year ago I started making a document that has all these numbers and every time I come across the number now I try to if I remember I try to go record it on this list so I have all kinds of numbers but as far as enough for preaching I just got one two and three really for today really so let's just try to finish that I got 23 minutes you know the Lord this morning Amen like I said I can see how God has revealed is called to me through numbers the number 11 it's it's made God's call real in my life and so that's what that's the focus of this message so you can understand numbers and then those numbers will help reveal God's will to you how many 1 know God's will I want to know God's heart more how many want to worship the Lord well the way to know God more is through numbers when God vindicates things so the meaning of number one number one has two meanings it can mean primacy which is the same as preeminence it can also mean unity of individuals okay so preeminence mean that there's only one and there's no other that's what primacy or preeminence means there's one and there's no other than unity of course is all just one a group all agreeing on one thought so primacy defined by Webster's is the state of being first being preeminent it's the first of importance the first of order the first of rank preeminent now let's look at some examples here all of these now I didn't have time to get all the scriptures but I could ease find them you just need a concordance and only had so much time so I some of them I didn't put all the scriptures on but there's one god there's one load there's one spirit one father which means there's only one there's no other father there's one faith there's one way there's one truth which means there's no other way to believe the Bible than the way we believe it every other way is a perversion it's an imitation because there's only one faith faith is the same thing Paul preached amen it's not like we're special it's just been restored back to us and there's no other way to be in the perfect one of God then they obey the one faith that God has revealed to this whole world's in this last time there's only one baptism that's the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there is no other people we know we know brother answer there's going to be surprised on the day of judgment how many understand that in Matthew 25 they're like when do we see Lord when do we do these things and he said when you did the least of these my brethren there's also going to be surprises on the other side where Jesus where they say Jesus did we not cast out devils and prophesy and do all these things and Jesus said I never knew you now I don't want any surprises on the day of judgment you guys everybody hear me I don't know the words I want to know his side I'm on right now I'm going to make my calling election sure right now so there's no surprises for me on the day of judgment so when I close my eyes and death I know that my spiritual eyes to be open and I'll see engines backing me to that sixth dimension amen because it's good because of how much we fell in love with Jesus because the Holy Spirit led us into all truth because that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost how do you know he got the Holy Ghost she spoke in tongues no I know a lot of people have spoken tongues that committed adultery and got divorce and broke all kinds of scriptures that doesn't just proves God was anointing your tongue to speak in tongues which is a great blessing the Bible says it's great edification to you but Paul went on and say I'd rather speak five words you can understand then 10,000 and an unknown tongue God wants us to grow deeper in the understanding of the word of God God wants us to understand God's Word his will and he wants us to obey it did you know well you know it but did you ever think about this how there's only one or first Great Commandment there's only one you know Jesus will be called one name in the millennium I would said there'll be one Lord in his name one have one way to can't dress he might have all these titles but there's one name to the husband there's one name in the first day of creation there was only one light that came forth let there be light there's one light not two lights one light the other light Sun and Moon they came later stars they came later on the first day they run one light Northern Light just one light God's light hey man God said I am the light of the world amen and he's still alive the world in you and I praise God the Bible said there's only one sacrifice Jesus Christ to see that's why we say Muslims though they believe in Christ but they don't recognize that his blood paid for their sins so they they their sins remain on them because there is only one sacrifice there's one mediator between God and man so see this is where we start to see the importance of this of the numbers making the Virgin Mary a mediator which the Roman Catholic Church does they call her mediatrix that blasphemes the primacy or preeminence of Christ and the church said that's why numbers are so important the Bob wouldn't say he's one of the mediators and you can also pray to st. John and st. Jude and all these things like that he's the only mediator he's the only one that were here first and he won't say here approaches warning a man because he's plural amen he has the preeminence he deserves primacy Jesus Christ is the only way you can get help today I'm doing his help hey man it's offered all the time we just got to come to the one mediator there's one bread for one body of believers that's first Corinthians 10:17 there's only one bread there's only one source for food oh thank you lord and there's only one body hallelujah now unity again I didn't have a whole lot of time on this one I was as I saw the amount you know I just read chapter one and I didn't go beyond that this was in chapter 1 so I'm gonna move on to chapter 2 and but unity the Bible said they had one heart one Accord in acts 1 art one soul one mind in the book of Acts so see it can mean it can mean primacy but it can also mean unity as well in church that's what we if if we can get to this now we've seen God do miracles among us heal people say people but when we get to this more often we'll see more of the power of God how many understand that that's all we got to pray we got live lives at home that's worth of the gospel and you know a church you know if you're coming to church with a spirit of expectation right we know if we're coming to church hungry for God or not we got to be hungry we got to cast all of the things of the world we got to get in one man set that we want to see Jesus Christ manifested in our lives amen we want to see a manifested on the job in our home in our church and there as we get one Accord we see more of God moving all the time oh it's so true if we can just get one Accord it we're not worried about after service we're not worried about next week or next month I don't know we're always be concerned about is what is Jesus gonna speak to us today amen now remember Satan can imitate one and I didn't have much time on this either I know I'm not I'm not even doing this I'm not even scratching the surface Church I know I'm not so you have to bear with me this is just this is all of the things I brought out and in my studies the last week summer Satan has a limitation one one World Order or one unionized religion and of course the tower Babel Babel they had one language okay so I'm showing you there's both sides Satan copied it and there's both sides here all right number two you know the meat now these two may be the same you know like I said I'm not have that say the Horde this morning I'm just trying to find all the different interpretations two can mean division when you divide something different so contrasting two things a testimony you need two witnesses two can also mean friendship or unity as well so one can the unity so can two to community as well all right Butler have said - he said yes - is a confirmation but if four will confirm it it'll be a double double confirmation so I wrote that down for later when we preach on number four four can be an earthly number four can be deliverance for also be a double confirmation then we ought to believe with all of our hearts are you are you enjoying this so far I just well I just thought oh man this is gonna be great because we know why because I want to see God more in my life I want God to reveal himself more in the numbers and the timings and the years and the months why does this happen for that purpose why do these things happen so to represents division in these ways to is the first number that can be divided but on the second day of creation the FIR minute was divided I'm sorry the Fermin it divide the waters from the waters so what happened on day 2 Division 2 represents division sheep are divided the Bible actually uses that literal word on the on the day of judgment of the white throne judgment they're divided sheep on the right hand goats on the left there are two classes of believers so God divides the class into two groups ones on the throne ones the wise ones the foolish then he has two classes of unbelievers that make believers and the unbelievers he has two classes two divides there was two goats for a sin-offering on the day of atonement which was divided Israel from their sin I love that the first goat paid the price of all their sins so payment was paid by the first coat the second goat separated them from their sin amen so it took two goats to separate Israel from their sins hallelujah not one - you see see how this is important now comparing and I'm sorry contrasting is the difference so when we can trash we find two things and their differences so Adam the Bible calls Adam he's the first Adam a living soul that's the the contrary or the opposite of Jesus who is the last Adam the cricketing spirit you see that God is contrasting them showing there's a difference the first Adam fell the second Adam can't fall I know yeah difference in twins well think of different these are all differences between Isaac and Ishmael we are talked about that one earlier Jacob and Esau Abraham a lot but there but their differences as far as believers because lot was saved Moses and Balaam heaven in hell Jesus and Judas heaven in hell also differences opposites of law versus grace faith versus works light versus dark truth versus lie hot cold wet dry heaven earth body spirit wise foolish heaven hell - vines amen the true behind the false vine all the New Testaments which again was long Greeks you had the Aaronic priesthood and today were under the Melchizedek Priesthood there's the difference today is the new priesthood hallelujah now to speaks to have an a testimony as well or having a witness oh good 12 minutes glory God is seeking true worshipers with the testimony of worshiping with spirit and in truth we all know you can have the right anointing but be wrong in your truth we all know you can have all of the truth but don't have the love of God the anointing of God so now if you have both now you have a testimony how much true worshipper there will be two prophets in the bottle of this the Bible literally says they give their testimony to their whole purpose is to give a testimony to Jesus Christ they made during the tribulation at the end of their testimony the remnant received Jesus Christ Oh glory wisdom and knowledge testified to a true understanding or I have knowledge about the water baptism well you need wisdom though have you been baptized with a true repentant heart if you got unknown knowledge and wisdom about that and you act upon that now you've got true understanding you've got a revelation oil and wine testifies the true worship and healing because Jesus poured the oil on the line for healing on the prodigal right I'm not probably go on the the man who was beaten and the Jesus told the Antichrist spirit touch not the oil and wine glory so brother man said olá was the Holy Ghost baptism and is the stimulation it brings to you and he said gnats he said spiritual Lord has the same effect on a man as natural line does and that's how I feel this morning hey Cory it makes you happy said you become animated brother Aaron says you'll become a Johnson when you're drinking the line of the Holy Ghost a man bread and wine testified to Jesus's body and blood when you partake of both it's a testament that you're waiting for it's coming because he said do these things until I return right so when you take both the bread and the wine now you have a testimony that you believe in Jesus Christ you're waiting for us coming Moses said this now of course this wasn't it you know in a negative sense he said I call heaven and earth to witness against Israel this day because they were going to eventually break the Covenant they were gonna get kicked out the promised land and Jesus said in the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established so that gives someone a testimony when this person says that this person says it now you've got a testimony alright two represents friendship or unity divine friendship the Bible said there's a friend that sticketh closer than a brother so you got all these friends but there's one friend who's better than all of them that's Jesus Christ he's your greatest friend praise God how many glad he sticks close to you when it feels like you don't have any friends if he's like nobody cares about you nobody's playing for you just remember Jesus prayed for you and he's your closest friend amen it's you and him it's you and him friendship husband and wife of course types Christ of the church I love that word Song of Solomon said this is my beloved this is my friend husband wife friendship brothers we need to be friendly to our wives sisters wives we need to be friendly to our husbands that's real friendship another second commandment it's about friendship its to love your neighbor as yourself I love it the second - right - represents friendship two fellows in one ship brother Branham says his fellowship and two or three gathered in Christ's name brings his presence how many like that now like I said I hardly have any on this I just had one say in either add it or takes away from God's Word and what does that cause that causes division so Satan can either add to the Bible or take away and that is an act of division he's dividing people from the Word of God so like I said the what I've read it hasn't given many of Satan's numbers so and I don't really know how far I want to study into that to be honest with you so if I'm you know if you were more into the cult than I was well then keep it to yourself because I already know want to know you know I know most people here weren't I know a couple brothers who were they would know about that but I don't want to start studying those things too deep I'll just give you God's and if you know God's and you can cast out anything that exalts itself against God's numbers amen that's right now we'll close with this here and give me a I got eight minutes this is probably the biggest number in scripture that I've that I've seen so far three three means divine perfection when me - which means God did it and it is totally perfect there's no flaws in it and brother Branham said three is life as well brother Branham said that he said now we understand God is perfected in threes now God is perfected in three five graces five seven is completion like the world God is perfected in Father Son Holy Ghost that's the perfection of the Godhead all one God in three manifestations of three attributes of one God or three offices in the one Godhead now there's also three imperfection of the steps of grace to the Church justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost that consists of the new birth just like a natural birth is tight with by it which a woman giving birth to a child the first thing comes forth is water blood and then life he says seven is God's number of completion three is God's perfect number so there's three and there's seven threes so mathematically spiritually by the word by the witnesses of the Holy Ghost it has completed the thing together he said let's study it aren't you glad we can study it today glory and here's where he says three's a number of life listen close he said I mean he said seven is the number of completion three is the number life so we'll go like I said I'm not gonna I'm not gonna breathe this in fact I may save some this for Wednesday that may save me a little bit of pressure over the week here cuz Monday I'll be I won't have time to study will be out in Jeffersonville but I'll just preach until this timer goes off is that okay by God's grace okay good thank you so we and like I said I have not even scratched the surface of this there's so much more this is just what I found from ballinger's book so in nature there's divine perfection solids have length width and height time is complete with the past present future relationships are complete in three points of view first person second person third person three points of view human capabilities this is all you can do you can only do these three things Church you can only think speak and do that's all you can do what else can you do and we think of anything else to give that's all you can do god perfected it God made sure there's only three channels that we could do the kingdoms of matter according to science our mineral like the earth animal vegetable that's it that's all the only kingdoms that matter there are in nature a babies born in three steps water blood spirit we just heard brother BAM say that the wheat plant has three stages stalk tassel grain man's being has three parts body soul spirit the purifying of the earth is the flood of Noah Christ's blood and the atomic fire or volcanic fire that will come at the end of Armageddon the earthly witnesses of water blood Spears that kind of ties in with the baby there's three witnesses that the baby's born water blood spirit there's three races of men I don't have these in the right order because I've never studied on this this has been I never felt led of the Lord to study on that well there's basically three races of men Jew Gentile Samaritan which stem from ham and Japheth Noah's three sons that came out of the Ark in creation day three in Genesis had three things mentioned the waters and land were separated and then seeds came up three things and to prove you that three means life the Bible said the seeds rose up out of the earth which symbolizes the resurrection of Jesus Christ even I know yeah divine perfection God gives life on the third day amen Jonah came out on the third day three his life hallelujah aren't you glad for life amen you have only three bodies you only have three terrestrial celestial and glorified I'm glad I've heard from at least two of them praise the Lord oh yeah because the Bible said don't you know that even though the angels of the child behold the face of the Father in heaven thus the Alpha knees are waiting for us by the throne of God amen brother man did say this when you've heard from me the Holy Spirit you heard from your theophany so another I can't explain that through scripture I preached on that a few years ago when I preached I'm Melchizedek I can't explain that but I believe it because sometimes I feel just like heaven come down Church sometimes I feel like I know heaven is here God is here that is moving God is speaking God is leading guiding healing we just feel his presence we know he's here we must have heard from off the apogee Amen it's like you feel I'm one with God there's a part of me that has a perfect body there's a perfect body here and I'm groaning trying to enter into it oh thank you Lord my wife boys lastly I do that funny laugh there so forgive me I just you know she says you kind of laugh funny I said well I can't help myself so I'm just so joyful I can hardly help myself glory and I've felt two of those bodies I sure like the theophany a lot better than this this pest house right here there's three heavens brother Branham says this entry store seal there's the first heaven as the clouds he calls it clouds which we know you know science calls the atmosphere then there's the whole universe which brother BAM calls a solar system but we know there's many solar systems right but he means the whole universe then there's God's throne which my man calls heaven so there's three heavens Paul was caught up to the third heaven the throne of God that holy place praise the Lord amen in creation oh yeah I'm sorry yeah Bill Graham yeah bro Graham also said this about the three heavens this is interesting there's the Holy Spirit and jugg beings and gods Thrones I don't know if heaven has three divisions but he said that he said that's what the third heaven means so this could be it could be a wrong quo or it could be something that God could give us understanding later well just I'm going to keep up on the shelf and the church said keep it up there on the shelf can't work with it right now and I'm I can't I'm working right now maybe something God will reveal to us later on I just got a couple minutes here bear with me there's divine perfection in the Godhead we know God there's one name to the Father Son and Holy Ghost God above us the Father God with us God the Son and God in us God the Holy Ghost now it's not God the son if I said that forgive me the Bible doesn't say God the Son it's the son of God that's a Catholic dogma God the Son so I'm sorry I didn't mean to say God the Son so forgive me now it's perfect because the Bible said these three bear record in heaven amen so God can bear record on every soul that was ever on the earth because he's both Father Son and Holy Ghost these three bear record in heaven the father the word and the Holy Ghost these three are one that's purr that's a perfect divine witness and record of everything that's ever happened in the whole universe there's three attributes of God God is all-powerful omnipotent God is omnipresent everywhere by foreknowledge right and he's omniscient he's all-knowing so because he's omniscient all-knowing he can be everywhere at one time because he just he can he created time he it's something some creation outside of him you know he created that and he knows everything that's going on in there my brother Hannah said he's not like God he said God's not in a tree remember brother Graham said that God's not in a tree God's not in the carpet right he's a being and he chooses what to dwell in but because his foreknowledge he can be in this room right now everybody also he sends his home the spirit - amen ah here's my hour just let me finish this slide hopefully oh I just hate to finish

time seven people in the church all dreamed about brother Branham going out west going out west the the the rock and the pyramid and and the crowbar taking off the top of the pyramid all these things seven people had but the eighth one he said capped it off and and then when he got done preaching the seven see I think I share this with brother John recently when he got done preaching the Seventh Seal brother said this was the thing I wondered about my whole life Amy a 54 year old man saying I've wondered what did this fest mean I had I've had these questions in my life for 54 years and God has told me gods revealed to me out through the numbers of the dreams and visions a man oh no yeah but see we got to pay attention I'm not saying you got a big yourself over spiritual but I'm saying you got to pay attention when God is speaking to you I'm saying I need to pay better attention to God speaking to me let's just bow our heads let me pray for you churches pray for other people in here that God will continue to speak to us reveal himself to us through the numbers of our lives through dreams visions prophecies let's pray together Heavenly Father in Jesus Christ's name how great you

eye cells to see Lord how you've ordered everything to your God Lord our prayers that help us just to walk in those obedient footprints sometimes we take a few steps off the beaten path Lord forgive
