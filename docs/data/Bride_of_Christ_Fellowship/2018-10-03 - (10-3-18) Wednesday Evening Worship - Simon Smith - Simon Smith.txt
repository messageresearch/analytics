right now to the street calming down brought him all the way back when you hold in the main parking lot here the hen Deacon was there they catch eyes here the head deacon is the chief electrical inspector and then just done an inspection complaint that Friday [Laughter] so God is able everything is our day every night finish you think you're going to catch I wanna catch you just throw them on out continue absolutely you know I would not have thought about him invited now you resent Milan be set to sunday morning service yes you do Saints there I said brother I've missed so many souls it's scary you know so that's all everything was working sit down password I see little complexes here in there or urging every service today I want to teach on rice outside the church glass outside the truth you see here in Revelations 3 and 20 nobody people ok tonight yeah goddess buoys kept those things of God is hollering Wednesday where does the type though now there's a time the hops in their time though we don't want it's the signature speed speeding up is like just felt like I got preached on Sunday and here those already Wednesday things are just moving half of it back I looked at Malcolm today and even since last week there's young rich revelations three you won't I've seen the door and God where do we find Christ right here he is outside of the seventh Richard he's not allowed in the churches our Lord and Savior so good he's he's walked just been in the midst of the seven church ages all the way through time and here we find him on the outside trying to look in he's trying to get in right he said at the door and he's knock it is a proper talk he said many men in the preachers tried to incorporate this that he's knocking at the door of his heart of your heart you know he's just come on in and be my saying you know this is to the churches correcting all these things he says have any man and I like how the property says if any man he's as well hear my voice and open aura with I will come to into you know and we know by him and man it is an individual call this is an individual affair make your calling many are called but few are chosen they got calling and out of that shoot sure amen thanks God I just had a roof leak spring up my house brand-new roof about seven eight years old I think it already started to leave and God only showed me things from nature you know he's speaking to me and I'm thinking Lord why we're starting now and so I jump on the message search engine last night I typed in the leak and sure enough I come to a boat he said so I feel like my queer little hip has been down I muscled back to making a mint yes sir yes sir here he says never seem to change he says I stand the door and not he says and being pushed out or out stand he says then trying to back in cross back and knocks at the door this is the most striking record he says in the New Testament this thing's you strike our hearts and Graceland fresh wide open he says I think there's nothing could be more satyr than this to see the savior of the world took out of his own church right it's like demon run out of his room oh Christ run out of even-even inclusive on his own church on his own sermon on Matt and Luke for he was right out there trying to throw him down the hill headlock he says he says and I think there is nothing could be more striking even more sadder than this to see the savior of the world took out of his own church the Laodicean Amy after he done told them what they had did their richness richest richness and everything no other age kick them out but this ain't right he says and everything and what they were how they were lukewarm and so forth and they needed hat he didn't have to skew them out he says they had beauty don't look after leave but they so he says and here was all that still knocking at the door the unveiling was to do is a foreign art himself into you and make a man says he says how lukewarm they weren't so forth it didn't he didn't dispute about he had answered him out and here was all that so knock at door for what he says the very ones that killed him at Calvary he was trying to save her soul the one who killed him afresh after the Prophet brought an indictment this generation he's still tried to get it back in yes-mo says it's the most pathetic picture I've ever seen in my life or ever thought oh yes there's many things that the Prophet says about in the book of Revelation there's many scenes here the promises are some of the most important scenes when the land would it take the movies of the most sublime thing here we see Christ the most pathetic thing right here and then remember the reward he says but him to overcome it he says he says now that is the greatest [Applause] [Music] and we will overcome early thank you praise God revelations 1 verse 10 move on this I don't know how long so we will see how it goes but a good portion this has opened up but there's another portion like it's like a separate eye like a separate secret portion here this is not open praying it's going to what it does it will show some things in Revelations 110 days I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet right now I'm see now we know these things we thought this thing for the gesture pastors as far these things before how we have to be in the spirit on the Lord's Day John would have never gotten this revelation he not been worshipping in carrying of carrying a ha out and carrying around in the island and getting a spear speaking he comes and running and jumping in the presence of Jehovah and God now comes down Jesus Christ comes down and gives the very revelation to him and he was in the spirit I yes of something tremendous now he says he said look he says any hard me a great voice as a sound of trumpet can anyone get that message on your cell phones today yeah presidential er presidential or to say no no action is what takes number that give every cell phone we're just thinking of ranking down anyway show Trump some penance all those things everything everything business because what it when I when that hit I go what is this it felt like my heart jumped like it didn't tank left that's how it affected me and personally I've meant something extra first thing to me because it came in 2:18 p.m. on my phone something's very significant took place this year don't agree for me now a voice like a trumpet revelation 1:10 and I heard behind me a great voice as but something John was in the spirit when he was he saw the great and wonderful day of our Lord Jesus and all his power the future was about to unfold or God was about to teach him John did not say it was a trumpet he says it was like a trumpet but now when a trumpet is blown and has an urgency about it oh that urgency would not think that my cellphone okay why are they because it was a test which means they're going to use this which means all right which means it's coming to the worst hints of God if you study your Bibles things got weird re surmount Philistines are amongst right he says he blows it it is like the heroine of Kings messenger coming to his people he grows on a trumpet he says is an urgent law the people gathering to listen Israel was always assembled by the sounding of a trumpet something important was in hand he doesn't listen to it so this voice and the same urgency of us did the trumpet clear and strong it was he says starving and awaiting oh that we might hear the voice of God and trumpet this thing any man for it is the gospel trumpet sounding forth the word of prophecy to make us aware of and prepare for what is coming upon a lot of time or subject of the oil and the wine or the healing prescription amen now we know that the healing prescription let me read this though we have all the wine charity or a board of the Holy Ghost you know we or that person is right if we're going to the Spirit of God we are not abyss and on Matthew 25 he says he says and I know you not right right he says how we think need this in this great hour that was all the hopes of mortal life has finished atomic bombs he says are living in hangars hydrogen bombs sickness diseases he says germ warfare he says I just I woke up I dropped the word today nice the Sun was coming up and there was chemtrails beautiful man's cloud look beautiful too we are protected Oh God everything that way though and the Bible said the man would actually rise hid their flesh like this thing but the angel was given a commission he says don't you touch any of those he says don't come here those who has the oil makes check yourself over every day he's saying I'm an alpha omega the first language he says what thou see us he says write in a book was John obedient yes sir absolutely we can read from it tonight right the revelation of God was now given to the angel and then the angel showed it to John and then John ruined all down they ran very calm yes sir he says write in a book and sit down to the seven churches which are in Asia right we all know these things was just rehashing a building foundation this is under Ephesus the smyrna for forgiveness and Avatara and under smartisan to Philadelphia today I want to see all right sorry agent no and now remember he heard this voice of a trumpet now Beverly said then John was weeping and he said they said don't worry John he says he says the lies a tribe of Judah has prevailed but when how they said it was a line but when they write it was like it was two full person you were part of his person right but now what John hears this trumpet and he knows is the very voice of God he says my turn to see the voices fake the in turn I saw seven golden roses here's the voice and it said I'm Alpha Omega but now look what he's looking back demanda the boys came out pieces now Jesus and if you want to get a beautiful picture of that lamp read about it in Zechariah 401 he says he says and the angel that talked to me came again and way to me as a man that has waked out of his sleep place shortly and started not today but he's in soon and setting to them watch he is down and I said I have looked at the old a candlestick of all full and it's about you understand that candlestick was not made out of wood he says this is so I look at all the candles to the Mogul and a bull was on top of it with the seven lamps there on right and six pipes to the Son of Man which are upon the top there and two out trees by it there's I'll see on this side on this side of the gold lamps right he says and on one of the right side the other on the left side he says so he said he said and the angel said what are these my lord he says saying what are these my lord then the angel that talked me saying no it's now not with these be and I said no my lord then he answered say to me this is the word of the Lord of this room for saying not by my my power but by my spirit saith a men so that that lamp stand was absolutely worthless unless the oil was in there that's the only way they can produce light otherwise you just - give it to a junk store absolutely because it was not producing light like a shoe and it needed that on our lives our producers should be like sup here he says and notice she says stop my power but by my spirit he says here is another lamp of pure gold he's burning brightly because can honey of oil which is getting from the two olive trees which stand on either side what does he say these olive trees are he says the two trees represent the old and the new testament of course the oil type refines the holy yes wall of God that was God was in the old and all the cloud would go and they carry the tabernacle here the table there what about for 40 years and that they have to carry that that's right even knowing seven Church as much as saying this is what it means to the church means that the church cannot accomplish anything by its own if we see if you want to topless anything for God it must be be the leader track leadership of the holy God and I want to go witness this person if I'm not letting the Holy Ghost nothing will actually bear fruit do we know or worthy because our works will be burned yes right good are very actions in our life what to do if they're not led by the Holy Ghost they'll be burnt if they have to hope that's right but the Bible says no footsteps of the righteous look how helpless we are without in John 5 verse 19 then answer Jesus said to Calipari I sense you the son can do nothing of himself even the pure Holy One God and flesh could not do anything without the father's leadership but what he sees the father do but what things sort of they do is they'll also do it the son likewise John 5:3 I am my own self can do nothing absolutely even the perfect one Jesus Christ could not do one thing without what the Holy yeah absolutely thank I just built this foundation moving by the grace of God in Revelations one in 20 after he sees the candlesticks he says and the mystery of the Seven Stars your thoughts Faust in my right hand and the Seven golden candlesticks he said in other words these aren't mysteries right he said the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches correct true so now we know after a four thousand years what those actually represent let's move on here he's now in a time-tested faith I could get the eight he says now we know that no man can move a mountain just by speaking to it right Amanda and move or do anything just fine spoken word you speak you want this you want that Lord what about this you speak the word the only thing to do that was deity so then if the mountain is the force in our objective is right he says in our motive is right there isn't a speaking any remember what fiber secures go for the books caught that stroke and he was one side open all good he was he couldn't hardly walk you couldn't hardly speak and he got down on my knees ignored so if you want something if you have a very desire in your heart you check your motive objective why do I want this right well this Lord is this going to increase your kingdom when they say he says Jesus said I'm about my father's business is this gonna make your business bill and when there is your father's business Lord I want to open this door because of speedy Morris DeeDee speaking has to move I truly believe the church is on the brink of one of the greatest our boys have ever had this right on the brink of that what was that sermon this year by that one pastor Texas Jesus Christ came toward a dream and he said I'm going to fish today revival or movement as hard as 72 72 years ago she started going back to history he's waking up waking up a woman you will not need one so we're right at the combination of time the the cup of the am right is full they say to God these people cannot get any more wicked wicked or middle the only way they'll get more wicked or more evil is if the Spirit of God is finding pull the bride and the Spirit of God is pull off the earth then all and the only thing up on the only reason we have servant of peace prosperity intersection or comfort right that's it what's the brightest bar what Satan that was going down yes and death right right amen like he says here in adoption 1960 he says so emphasis he's dealing now with the book of Ephesians or the city of Ephesus receptive of Ephesians two so absences here sucks Plus like dying or positionally you notice Joshua after crossing over the land and tasted land then he divided the land at from here - is here and one here dad here Benjamin here and he's dividing the land and now he's typing the book of Joshua the book of had a perfect time he's everything here and he said what knows about the book of each of these is to mature church it is the one that can handle the deeper things and he'll to handle the revelations now diversity the one the second greatest mystery given to us in the binding was right there two peaches five between the Christ amen notice oh this just burns our hearts he says eternal super mothers giving birth to those children she spoke out the very place in her labor pains where they were position in the promise then who oh he says it's a great study and that's what she calls out every minute she labored was this any place to speak were setting oil all those things right so we continue to hit this he says and Josh were not knowing this but by inspiration led of the Holy Spirit after being in the promised land gave each man his promise exactly what the Holy Spirit promised through the earth back down now as the as as all these they the twelve tribes had went into the Promised Land there was many enemies there many things they have overcome and subdued he says and as it was tying now to give the land gladness in Joshua not knowing this but by inspiration letter the Holy Ghost after being ordered say in the Holy Ghost this is after being in the promised land he each man has promised exactly what the Holy Spirit promised back to the earth back from there all the placing was ordained fiercely by the Baptist amen the emphasis now we find the same thing the Old Testament I think this book of Joshua he says the book of emphasis of the Old Testament so be renamed the book of Joshua this is the book of Ephesus of the Old Testament the book of Ephesians of the Old Testament because pieces would be a good thing to call the title this book see how much he said in their equal man they're exactly the same he says why he is twice like she just his first wife's I didn't see this Paul must them he said they're exactly the same just the lack of the other he says would be good thing he says to title this book of Joshua because it's certainly fitting that be sold fitting to type Ephesians to Joshua look at st. Paul's revelations in Ephesians 2 I would say Paul know these things I said 3 scriptures issues let's jump jump the reasons 3 these are three verse 2 if you have heard of this but dispensation the grace was give me two you heard how that by revelation he made known to be the mystery as I wrote a for a few words whereby would you agreed you may understand my knowledge the mystery of Christ break it down mystery you think he's got some revelation here I think yeah this is which in other ages so now by the evil eye psyche they will say he's a God there was this this represented this this was this this agent this going back to the David saw a solid and all those we're gonna kind of agent right yes he says which in other ages not known unto the sons of man but has now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit so I had to give up in the spirit yes like it'll be nice to verse 6 he says and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus right that in the ages to honey notice how did st. Paul know this that there was more ain't no he just said um next chapter he says there's ages but before they said oh good good I think you've got the increase he goes they thought it was the end time they thought he was coming right then but he says putting the ages yes Ephesians 3 verse 21 water Jesus for this 321 he says under hippie the glory of the church in the church by Jesus Christ throughout all ages world without end amen I would Paul know there was ages to come he said he was in the spirit right I probably broke down Paul singer the other last time one last time those here he wrote seven letters to seven churches yeah before joy you know to do that he also had the revelation of Jesus Christ just like time and he talked about what ages to come you know what the answer lies right here second Corinthians twelve this morning here's how he knew this - yes Amen yeah second Corinthians 12 verse one he says it is not expedient for me doubtless to glory I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord he says I do a man look how humble this man is a prophet in third person he says whether in the body I cannot tell or whether out of the body I cannot shout Noah such a one caught up into the third heaven what did he see he was in the spirit catching these revelations just like God he says and I knew such a man whether in the body or out of body I cannot tell he says God knoweth how that he caught was caught up he was he saw all these mystery yeah one thing I like gone 21 then Peter turns us about she's the disciple whom Jesus loved following which will also lead on his breast at sufferance ignored what is he that betrayeth which is he that betrayeth II Peter seeing he am saith the Lord Jesus Lord what shall this man do jesus answered him if I will that he tarry till i come wasn't did they follow now me I Jesus said he said he will see that coming Laurie says he'll not pass he says until he sees he will tarry till i think of god that's a direct prophecy of the bright we will be here 20 that's right price was already setting the stage for st. Paul first Thessalonians okay he says what he says that the seven churches support the candlestick why it's so important in in Matthew 13 and your pastors in a wonderful video on this he says that there are seven parables right which is actually in four represents what the seven churches in Matthew 13 it has the best description of all those parents but if you go to the Book of Ruth as and Jesus is going through the seventh or the own or through the parables well look what takes place before he starts going through these parables in Luke 8 verse 4 pieces and when there was much people gathered together and were come out of every city he's he's faked by a parallel what he sees in type they represented the seven pair of the seven cities Gentile churches because then he goes into these things they came out of what in other words every Church age heard these 7 parables because it was written down because they were to read these things he said they crowd up every city now does that is this kind of lined up look at their cities then in Luke 1st chapter 8 verse 16 now he goes what he's no man when he has like the candle comes it with the best which was right to the camps he started he was cities it's the parable that goes right to the candlestick right he says according to read it says no decay no secrets they have they may enter may season life right but now as he's going through these parables in Matthew 13 after the seventh parable in verse 51 Jesus said have you understood all these things remember Jesus went through all the parables right he only explained two of them he left the other five uninterpreted in Scripture right right now at the end of Matthew 13 Jesus the disciples have you understood all these things and they said to him in verse 15 where they are so they said yes Lord I'm gonna be proved that can we prove that those disciples understood everything jesus said to them in the Feres I scripture absolutely in mark chapter 4 verse 33 and many such parables fakey the word out of them and as they were able to hear it he says but without a parable about it he said he says family fake-out unto them and when they were alone he expounded all things yes sounds like an exposition was given to them i was like they understood things these parables that when besides not only did he break down in tears and heat and the sword to see what he broke down every one of those could they lie to Christ and have not call it out every time someone Peter spoke something crazy to Christ he spoke it out he said the understanding a men broke it down now absolutely and disciples came and said there why speakest Allan two parables and he said because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom but to them it is not given these mysteries this word of God is so precious that God gave that to us any sentence holding for specified the a man horn now here's that you're going to go into this no study here trying to build a little foundation in visions of God I want to show this here by the grace of God we have to keep our spiritual thinking camps in so before I go in this I go through moments - there's 28 if you can catch the revelation here if you get into the spine set yours it's going to boat by the grace of God I'm gonna bring this out Romans tumors 28 or he is not a Jew which is one outwardly he says neither is that circumcision which is the hour of rest but he is a Jew which is one inwardly right the circumcision and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit and not of the letter things about how many Jews we have everything amen all right here we've got our spiritual Israel unlike a higher grade up yes sir whose praise is not a man but a dog correct yes I want to show you this hidden right here let's go to Joshua remember Joshua Pellicer pieces right one of the same spiritual revelations lot of things st. Paul saw that are the Old Testament a lot of things that st. John saw the Old Testament but here's the shadow a type of it yes Joshua 18 and the whole congregation of the trailer is are assembled together at Shiloh which is tranquil appease and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there and the land was suit subdued before them remember for years they walked in the movie tired weary they had to let the old fighters die out that manna was sent to what to try to examine to move them yes saints of God the same thing has happened to this message they've sat under the Word of God from what all these years and this manna is proving out this revelation is proving out we had a division of the church and the Bible says he falls he said that whether there's divisions don't be Paris right he says and whether it be Harris he says he says there's gonna move on to that further down the road further in the spirit more more into that Antichrist spirit so wherever there's a division if I'm separating is this person will be a heresy vines up this principle is excellent fight that's right that's right they came down exactly exactly just like that okay now look at verse 2 and they remained among the children is no seven tribes would not get receive their we're going to do now they cross over into the promised land this is what a type of the Holy Ghost which is a type of the changes absolutely yes yes you think when they first went in the promised land that they that they got it no it was starting at Ephesus look at the power at the beginning but Lyon anointing was on Peter and Paul emanating distinct or the devil's Kingdom up look at Joshua right at the beginning he told the Sun to standstill Jericho fell right away but as they continue about things dropped off but at the time when they could take the land seven tribes of the children of Israel and not yet to see their Hareton saints of God and I can't wear cheatin date seven changes all right right seven tribes not receive their inheritance verse three in Joshua or type foot for the grandson of type of the Holy Ghost senator how are you we got ourselves we're living so far beyond our under our privileges right when's the last time you spoke and something took place I'm working at a big theater when about a year ago and a bird had flown down the other spheres have high ceilings a bird was flying around he couldn't get out they flew around for almost two or three and finally I was brought up to the to the to the Pope to the stage area and that burden flown down now under the stage area it goes straight up for about 80 feet because they had all the stuff for the theater curtains and things you can drop and props and all those things and the burger was way up there and I said bird all you got to do is fly down and go through that overhead door right there and it wasn't two minutes hey my motive objective was to save the birds life thank you lord first for give you up from what you three men or each tribe you said 21 men out each I'm seven and I will send them and they shall rise and go through the land and describe and according to the inheritance of them and they shall come unto me again this is Old Testament type show and they shall divide it into seven arms he says he says Judah show abided their coos on the south and on the coast and the house of Joseph shall find the coos on the north he shall therefore describe the land into seven parts and bring the description hither to me and I make a splash for you here before the Lord of thought right he said it was a Levites have no part of the priesthood of the Lord is their inheritance breeze begun and he's our portion as well that's right because the process of what the Levites were televised he says he and GAD and Reuben and half the tribe of manasseh have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east which Moses and servant of Lord entered and the men arose and went away three men from each tribe and Joshua charged them and they went into the land saying go and walk through this land walk through these seven Church ages he says and describe it and come up to me again that I may cast knives before you in the Lord November everyone the Prophet said he's a Joshua he says no way he's this with the divine inspiration right and it was a Holy Ghost he had the signified it was the signification of the prophecy it was a prophecy Attic of the past yes verse 9 and the men went past to the land and described it by our Pergamus of my thyroid Sardis Philadelphia legacy and described by cities into seven parts in a whoa oh my what if this was prophesied because remember these were described they were broke down specifically in detail what hill this is and where that River flows here in the and the bluffs over here that flats over here on the mountain over there and this over here that cities here that broke it down into seven cities into a book it came again unto Joshua to the hose China when that book came up all right now it's time to place you hey who's gonna get of those I've been trying right that's right let's go there let's go to Josh one Enterprise a lot of nuggets in here I haven't gotten that football last 1:18 he starts dividing up Benjamin comes up to the first Lots in verse 11 but all these have names and their names have meetings but I couldn't put together yet something then now in verse 19 he starts the second law came to Simeon and on and on and on and on down and notice Joshua 19 verse 40 and the seventh lot came out for the drive of the children of Dan according to their families a member of three men from each tribe were sent right yes remember this is seven cities in among correct how many people wrote revelations came from God the angel John Wayne how many put people wrote this because Christ the angel yeah yeah he says now look at the importance of the book the revelation of Jesus Christ 1960 this morning I am starting the first chapter revelation the book of Revelation and Revelation is set of three parts the first three chapters what we dealing with these these eight days when one church age will take us a month but what have to hit the high places we call it so Abby's preaching these the church age is 1960 says he's only hitting the high places he says every call it when you get the book it'll be written out in more detail right very detailed and specific written book right yes just by reading revelations two and three what are specifically the deeds in it later can you name them there are three major routes of God and with these are deeds doctor and indeed the doctor regulations was spoken up but the brief or unspoken actions there's three of them they were laid by acting well it does maybe something but how we gonna know if we didn't have boss right he doesn't even really break it out in the surface what the specific three outward visual manifestations are movements of nikolaeva Amen or absolutely what else was revealed in here and not in the sermon Matthew 13 and you're this man 13 verse 24 thrown off Nuggets by the grace of God Matthew 13 yes Matthew 13:24 another parent will be put forth of them saying the kingdom of heaven is like in the man which sowed good seed in his field right verse 25 but while men slept hey my first one the message I wrote this down some fairy when I first won the message there to teach me the message it said okay teach me serpent seed said when men slept okay obviously well this could have been the instance this serpent that's snuck into but Adam asleep well you're on the side and that's what gave the sermon space that's what if my hard times come and that just doesn't make sense right now the Bible was written specifically for the safe but wow man what man a man this isn't now in the beginning of the church's book when the profits going through the original sin he's dealing with the original sin and he hits Matthew 13 he says and he's reading this parable and he said this is a perfect description according what took place he says right Genesis 3 but as I'm reading further the church's book there's always these little nuggets yeah cuz it says man but wow man snack Adam no what's the titles but how does he start every parallel Kingdom of Heaven the kingdom of heaven yes the King I have what was what was John's message gotta come up with poppin locust eat honey don't you thought he said he said behold the Lord the King right I'm gonna set up the bruising jobs off the sea Jesus picks up the exact same message he says the kingdom of heaven is at hand then as he sent as 12 as I belong to my duty says the kingdom of heaven is at hand he said later on he says what the kingdom the kingdom of heaven is the Holy Ghost yes amen the kingdom of heaven now let me read the resume yes sure I found this well that's fun what does that mean he says now please just be careful actually this would have happy 13 Matthew 13 Matthew 13 and we'll go to verse hope this is okay yes 36 but let's go to verse 30 let's go 36 and we'll show you what is centered let's say and I'll show you the provinces misnomer he said then Jesus sent the multitudes away and went to the house and his light was keeping him saying declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field what he's expounding these things right and he answered some of them Jesus shows the good seed is the son of man he's hopeful he says the field is a worm right the kingdom of heaven is likened unto you know what heaven is like unto you but look what he says in the resume now please let us be careful here this message to the Angel of the Church was an emphasis is not a message to the actual local competing church it is a message to the aged and at that age handed he's doing what emphasis he says and in that age the age of the message that he's had the seed of truth in that aged Ephesian age had the seed of truth and the seed of error exactly set forth according to the parallel movie to tears right and then he says something so spectacular the church ages is the fee yes a man does now he switches the word world that Christ said he said it's actually changes you and as I read that I said what did he say at the revelation go put wild mountain slept found Ben's neck while men slept then the evil Kenan yes yes and a nice as a fire come up to Palm to Peter comes in.they Paul ganda divine one has so much done right is anyone and would pull him into the seas and I perceived the James ball Peter and John were the pillars in truth they run this show they had the power of God just like Christ James was killed always slain right and Paul said I after my departing he says grievious wolves will come Peter said keep these things and remember Jesus because I'm about ready to go off the scene they're warning that when they pass on bad things are coming they're coming in the wolves are coming and the prophets uneasy that these are the glades in these is there's Paul's previous school all right good when to mend the pillars of the church when they started to hang on what other wonderful but I was down in a certain state a pastor come up here he said he went back to them he went back to the parallels Matthew 13 he said that mustard seed mustard seed he said you get that much receiving your face they're growing a tree there's actually three parts three times he actually breaks it down in here they are 70 senator - and 38 paint them put that on that precious number that's 238 he's two and 38 and then on 363 he says now the moment ago that falls on came into pole for Jason and this danger proven mature and ripen that that is correct this evil spirit of church politically will be anybody will be revealing the mustard seed that grew into extreme were loud we're we're large the fowls of the air and her head and her head will be Antichrist mr. Griffin only family what is this what is the mystery mystery uh mustard sequencing the real funny find you couldn't confidently get the highlights while men slept the mustard seed hungry that's right mean something we want to stick to them we want to know all of the words but the best the best of God will reveal to us that's what wanna Joshua Joshua 19 and 40 is and the 7th Black team up off the tribe of the Church of Dan according to their families right notice the seventh was Dan and if you look at the other seven tribes all of the beasts are not knowing place these men these are the place these tribes where where he was but now even though it's Dan it is they equal symbol he's on the north side right but the Genesis verse 49 ad Jacob's dying look how he blessings then ordained there's a very powerful thought here look how he blesses Dennis's 49:16 day and jumpy at one of the spies of Israel be a judge but now on the side of her 17 days shall be a serpent on the way an ad on the path that bite at the heels horses heels so that his rider will fall back though he's a judge and the sermon because of twofold nature right thank God verse 18 says I have waited for thy salvation so he said shows he's a judge what that he's a serpent correct now and the resume the church agency said from our studies we have already learned that much of the revelation is totally misunderstood because why we have not formally known that the church spoken of and spoken to in this book revelations one two or three Jesus does not refer to the pure ecclesia the elect the body of Christ the bride he says but a space for the entire body of people who call themselves Christians whether they be true or merely not speaking for both sets right everyone who claims to be a Christian Atlantis yet is in Revelation 3 that's right brother yes sir rich increased with Goods heavy to nothing and what even the bride is called the dependable he's my brother yes sir right so it seemed notice Dan he's a type of Laodicean Church age he's the seventh but there's two with him Lori the shrine Jesus the true the two mites are mortified by it motivated by two kinds of spirits what has a Holy Spirit while the others of the Spirit 19 verse 47 and the coast now here's where I can only go we can only go so far I move ahead here because there's a whole another section it's a revelation because God specifically Sebastian yeah you gotta wait up put on the show it's a big now in Joshua 1947 and the ghosts of the children dan went out to little their inheritance was to they didn't get all of their here it was too little well then now let's say that part why was it too little in judges 134 don't you wanted verse 34 and the amorite or the children dan into the mountain well they would not suffer them to come down to the back the Emirates still run the show over that area and then one of that was their inheritance but because they were not able to subdue and defeat the ammonites em rights which is your pastor broke down through the scripture is what the lust of the flesh the fresh kicks huh so when Laodicea the very desires of your flesh will overcome you and you'll not be able to get in my goodness priest was gonna defeat of nothing he says and they were giants historian cities with giants this is a deal of the fight against in the back to giant Joshua 1947 and the coast of the children Dan without too little for them there or that sure of danwon up to fight against fashion which is the highest of all the Seas I believe is the Hyatt one of the highest and the Norden of the cities in Israel are they to go okay so one of the fight against nation can took it and smote it with the edge of the sword and possessed it and well they're in called Leshem remember this represents both everyone in the seven churches right what does the word and there's only one precious come tonight in other words very because they're going to find out and this last church age will not satisfy they'll not be able to overcome enough to go and try what and run from the hood not notice the pressure still in that city was not originally didn't care price was outside outside of the truth how he picks this up but the scripture goes now then two of these judges where they actually go and it describes the battle the scribes been going in this frame is my cup to describe the priest the monk up higher that is had not been able to break that down so read that right Michael hires the priest and then all these men from Dan come up and they're scoping out nation we should actually the main and in that horn layers is what's called is actually the month so they went up against the lion where's the bride sense of mystery you studied that chapter and breaks the bone down but Jeff does everybody have to look at the computer things was not let's release everybody okay before they extend the door knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm sat down with my father and his room he didn't hear the appeal at the spirits say unto all right then edifying is showing you is krisily giving you duggan is showing you things of god this is not just revelation this is not just in matthew 13 this is not just the seven cities all the way the palmer own but is all the way back hey man God was showing what a book book written that had a full description right every demon everything in the battle is right here that's right fighting this thing what was the very remember that remember I quote every uses for a lot of you use the sickest body I know is divine what the prophets say in here you know the Antichrist but one of them amen if
