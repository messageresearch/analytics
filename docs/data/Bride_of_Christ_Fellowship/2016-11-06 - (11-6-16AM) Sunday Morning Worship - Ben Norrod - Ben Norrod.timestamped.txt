[38:41] continue to pray for Samantha and I
[38:43] we're gonna meet with another producer
[38:45] on Wednesday in Nashville and uh he's
[38:48] he's gonna help us do another project
[38:51] pretty quickly we're going to lay the
[38:52] groundwork for a second one I'd like to
[38:54] get it out either by the spring and uh
[38:56] maybe maybe even up up toward Easter
[38:58] time and uh the gentleman that I'm gonna
[39:01] work with he's he's just been really
[39:02] wonderful throughout the last three or
[39:04] four months he's been talking about uh
[39:07] you know kind of doing different things
[39:09] with the singing part of it and I'm not
[39:12] interested in making some kind of a big
[39:14] name when it comes to singing or nothing
[39:16] like that but if we could go somewhere
[39:18] and help somebody I would like that a
[39:19] lot you know I'd like to be able to help
[39:21] folks and so I don't know kind of what
[39:23] he has in his mind we'll meet with him
[39:24] Wednesday but he's going to help us do a
[39:26] project that's going to be what they
[39:28] call piano only type project and have 10
[39:31] songs to be just with the piano and
[39:32] things like that and if it goes the way
[39:34] we hope we should have that in our hand
[39:36] probably within a month and uh and maybe
[39:40] as it goes along we might add a little
[39:42] bit more than the piano to it as we get
[39:43] down the road we just have to see how it
[39:45] goes but uh we're um we're trying to
[39:47] follow the leadership of the holy spirit
[39:48] in this singing thing six years we
[39:50] waited for this project to come along
[39:52] and now we've got it done and by the

[56:08] place where you don't understand right
[56:11] now we're in the place yes sir we really
[56:13] are in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus
[56:15] we might be dealing with this body of
[56:17] time but really we're in this righteous
[56:19] holy place the Bible said our soul has
[56:21] already went there yes sir amen so we're
[56:24] inment camped about the inumerable host
[56:27] of angels I think we ought to enjoy a
[56:30] Little Bit of Heaven on this side don't
[56:32] you hallelujah amen I certainly love the
[56:35] Lord Jesus with all of my heart I wanna
[56:38] I want to preach to you this morning on
[56:40] the essence of God's
[56:42] love the essence of God's love uh
[56:46] sometime after I left you in April I was
[56:49] preaching I was doing a wedding for a
[56:51] brother and um he was marrying a young
[56:54] lady from Pennsylvania area by brother
[56:56] Lambert on that side of the world in
[56:58] Pennsylvania and uh brother Lambert had
[57:01] asked me to preach for him and I I was
[57:03] happy to do it and the Lord had spoke to
[57:05] me some words that afternoon and I
[57:07] wanted to really study it and get into
[57:10] the depth of it because when the Lord
[57:11] meets you like that it just you know
[57:13] there's some special things involved and
[57:16] uh my I just had no idea what was going
[57:17] to come out of the thought and I heard
[57:19] him say the words the essence of love
[57:22] and when I heard those words I thought
[57:24] well Lord Jesus I only got a little spot
[57:27] time to get it together you got to help
[57:28] me my the things the Lord giv me I'm
[57:31] just excited to be able to share these
[57:33] things with you today and uh just just
[57:35] trust in the Lord to really give us a
[57:37] nice time in the in the word today let's
[57:40] start with First Corinthians chapter 13
[57:43] verse 11 112 and 13 I was reading a
[57:47] quote this morning brother Jesse that I
[57:50] found this morning just in Reading just
[57:52] looking through one of's messages and
[57:55] I've been studying a couple things on
[57:57] the on the the day that we're living in
[58:00] with these politics and all these things
[58:01] coming in and while you get in your spot
[58:04] there in First Corinthians I just was
[58:05] reading in the message this morning I
[58:08] made a quotation last night where the
[58:09] Prophet said the nation is gone and I
[58:12] happen to hit this little spot this
[58:13] morning I wanted to read it to you
[58:15] especially with this election all these
[58:16] things getting ready to come on I want
[58:17] you to listen to the said sin is worse
[58:19] than it ever was and it will continue to
[58:22] get worse there will be no National
[58:24] repentance amen the nation is gone he
[58:28] said just you individuals and soon
[58:31] that'll be over he said it if isn't
[58:32] already he said you mark it down you
[58:35] young
[58:36] children that's us he said and see if
[58:39] brother brandham he said well it ain't
[58:40] brother brandham he said it's right or
[58:42] wrong as I've said sin will get worse
[58:45] until one day the SK Skies will catch on
[58:47] fire she'll fall to the earth the earth
[58:49] will burn with a fervent heat but the
[58:50] redeem won't be there they'll be gone he
[58:53] says amen amen so America according to
[58:57] that can never be great again right and
[59:00] it really don't matter if it's Hillary
[59:02] or
[59:03] Trump she's got thus sayith the Lord as
[59:05] brother Smith said this morning she's
[59:07] got th thus sayith the Lord as he was
[59:08] telling me in the office you got thus
[59:10] sayith the Lord working against you and
[59:12] you can never beat thus sayith the Lord
[59:14] she's never going to rise again the only
[59:16] hopes we've got now this is why I'm
[59:18] making this remark like this the only
[59:20] hope you and I have got is he said it's
[59:23] the individuals and you know what
[59:25] friends we need to be as much in love
[59:28] with the Lord as we possibly can because
[59:31] if the nation is gone and then
[59:33] individuals will be gone how much more
[59:35] time do we have hello somebody how much
[59:39] more time do we have we don't have much
[59:42] whether it's a woman present or not a
[59:44] woman whatever it may be it's it's the
[59:46] individuals and the individuals have got
[59:48] to get down to business serving the lord
[59:49] in the right way with all of our hearts
[59:51] we don't want to serve him half heart we
[59:53] want to serve him with all of our heart
[59:55] sir got place that 1 Corinthians 13 oh
[59:58] by the way brother Ro did you write that
[1:00:00] music too was that your music in in the
[1:00:02] that you did the
[1:00:03] music I love that brother my that was
[1:00:06] wonderful I know the song I know that's
[1:00:08] that's an old old old song My no one
[1:00:10] ever cared for me he was right on the
[1:00:11] money with the message this morning and
[1:00:13] I wanted to compliment the music too I
[1:00:15] thought really beautiful my goodness
[1:00:17] he's a talented man I wish I had six
[1:00:19] months
[1:00:20] with just to learn I really enjoyed it
[1:00:23] brother that was really wonderful one my
[1:00:26] favorite songs too that no one ever
[1:00:27] cared for me this exactly what we're
[1:00:29] going to talk about this morning is
[1:00:30] God's love God's love what it's all
[1:00:32] about the essence of his love all right
[1:00:34] now 1 Corinthians 13:1 let's pick it up
[1:00:37] when I was a child I spake as a child I
[1:00:39] understood as a child I thought as a
[1:00:41] child but when I became a man I put away
[1:00:44] childish things right for now we see
[1:00:47] through a glass Darkly but then face to
[1:00:50] face now I know in part but then shall I
[1:00:53] know even also
[1:00:56] as I am known now abideth watch
[1:00:59] carefully faith hope and charity what a
[1:01:04] strange place to go from talking about
[1:01:06] growing up to putting this in there in a
[1:01:09] way it kind of looks like Paul's
[1:01:10] changing his thought actually he's in
[1:01:13] the same thought all the way through it
[1:01:15] he's continuing right on about this with
[1:01:18] growing up and becoming an adult this is
[1:01:20] no accident that he says right in Here
[1:01:22] and Now abideth faith hope and charity
[1:01:26] because actually he's talking about
[1:01:28] growing up in the Lord with those three
[1:01:29] things amen that's right but the
[1:01:31] greatest of these is Charity now let's
[1:01:35] turn to First John chapter 4 verse
[1:01:39] 7 God first John chapter 4 verse 7
[1:01:46] 7-1 certainly had a good time at the
[1:01:48] Bible Study last night in the prayer
[1:01:49] meeting and I've laughed and said I
[1:01:52] don't get communion and prayer meetings
[1:01:53] often and I like them when I get them
[1:01:55] and I really enjoyed last night we spent
[1:01:57] about an hour and 48 minutes in prayer
[1:01:59] last night I mean on the subject
[1:02:01] teaching but we spent about a half hour
[1:02:03] I guess praying on top of that is really
[1:02:05] really wonderful 1 John chapter 4 verse
[1:02:08] 7-10 can never go wrong praying can
[1:02:11] you beloved let us love one another for
[1:02:14] love is of God and everyone that loveth
[1:02:16] is born of God and knoweth God he that
[1:02:20] loveth not knoweth not God for God is
[1:02:25] love is love not of love now but he is
[1:02:29] love now watch him in verse S he said
[1:02:31] love is of God but now he turns right
[1:02:33] around and said but God is love right
[1:02:37] there's a reason for that in this was
[1:02:39] manifested the love of God toward us
[1:02:42] because that God sent his only begotten
[1:02:44] son into the world that we might live
[1:02:47] through him here in his love you ready
[1:02:52] not that we loved God
[1:02:56] but that he loved
[1:02:58] us
[1:03:00] hallelujah praise the Lord and sent his
[1:03:03] son to be the propitiation for our sins
[1:03:06] well you say I love God that might be
[1:03:08] right but that's not really what puts
[1:03:10] you
[1:03:12] in hello brother brandom said you can
[1:03:15] even love God from your human Spirit
[1:03:17] still wind up in hell it's not whether
[1:03:20] you love him or not it's whether he
[1:03:21] loves
[1:03:23] you Lord y Qui presan this morning amen
[1:03:27] that's exactly right now here's the
[1:03:29] Bible here's the Bible what we call the
[1:03:31] most in this is the only infallible book
[1:03:33] in the world do you believe what it says
[1:03:35] right here that God loves you you
[1:03:38] understand one of the greatest things
[1:03:40] that I get confronted with from people
[1:03:42] they just don't feel like the Lord even
[1:03:43] loves them but the Bible said it right
[1:03:46] here God loves us amen he loves us and
[1:03:49] Brother Andy he wants us to be saved he
[1:03:50] wants us to have the Holy Ghost but John
[1:03:52] he wants us to be blessed beyond measure
[1:03:55] amen that's right he wants us to have
[1:03:57] everything in his word let's talk to him
[1:03:59] just a moment Heavenly Father we so
[1:04:02] thank you Lord Jesus for the opportunity
[1:04:03] to come behind this sacred desk and open
[1:04:06] up the pages of the Bible and the
[1:04:07] message and my just dig right into the
[1:04:10] word of the Lord I pray that you would
[1:04:12] help us today give us an unction from
[1:04:16] the presence of God let us be able to
[1:04:18] look into the supernatural things of
[1:04:20] your word and let us be able to Feast
[1:04:23] upon those things that will be revealed
[1:04:25] to us as I preach as they receive Lord
[1:04:28] move me out of the way that I might be a
[1:04:30] vessel used of you that you could speak
[1:04:33] through me today Lord Jesus open their
[1:04:35] hearts that they might receive for Lord
[1:04:38] Jesus no gift that's ever been given to
[1:04:40] us is for our own edification is for the
[1:04:42] glorification of the Lord Jesus and the
[1:04:45] kingdom of God and we thank you Father
[1:04:47] for allowing us to glorify you with the
[1:04:49] gifts you've placed into our hearts and
[1:04:51] lives greater than all gifts the gift of
[1:04:54] the Holy Ghost may we just begin to
[1:04:56] praise you and worship you this morning
[1:04:58] and have a Heart of Thanksgiving and
[1:05:01] gratefulness knowing that Lord as I read
[1:05:03] just a moment ago the nation is gone but
[1:05:05] individuals can still seek your face
[1:05:07] thank you Lord for that opportunity give
[1:05:09] us your favor now as we look into the
[1:05:11] things of God in Jesus Christ's name
[1:05:15] amen God bless you you may be
[1:05:18] seated Megan if I don't tell you you
[1:05:20] remember CU I'll forget it tell Sunny I
[1:05:22] said hello and if he's in a tree stand
[1:05:24] this morning you tell him I'm with
[1:05:26] him no I just hav't fun amen amen if I
[1:05:30] don't tell you now I forget it I'm
[1:05:32] almost to the top of the hill 40's
[1:05:34] coming you know that I walk into a room
[1:05:36] now and say what I walk in here for
[1:05:38] you amen hallelujah I just love them the
[1:05:43] Bible don't you thank God I I I just
[1:05:46] really appreciate the way that the
[1:05:48] Apostle Paul wrote this I have all the
[1:05:50] things that he said to us I just really
[1:05:52] love this particular spot because it
[1:05:55] just really to me exemplifies what God
[1:05:58] wants out of us that he doesn't want us
[1:06:00] to be just children as it was tossed to
[1:06:03] and fro but he wants us to become adults
[1:06:05] become grownup Christians in the Lord
[1:06:08] Jesus and I find it to be a a blessing
[1:06:11] to us as the people of God to know that
[1:06:15] God had a vision for each of Our Lives
[1:06:18] he had a thought in his mind of what he
[1:06:20] wanted us to achieve what he wanted us
[1:06:22] to be and that gives me the hope of
[1:06:24] knowing that my destiny and my future is
[1:06:28] not relied solely upon my decisions and
[1:06:31] what I want and so forth is that thank
[1:06:33] God for that because without his
[1:06:35] leadership and without his the ability
[1:06:37] for God to lead me and guide me in
[1:06:40] certain ways I I can speak for me I
[1:06:43] can't speak for you but I know I would
[1:06:44] have made a mess out of my life today it
[1:06:47] would have been an absolute mess because
[1:06:48] the decisions I would have made that
[1:06:50] would have been uh to fulfill my own
[1:06:52] self- desires and what I wanted and what
[1:06:54] I thought and so forth like
[1:06:56] but God had a plan for our lives and we
[1:06:59] can rest and have confidence in the
[1:07:01] reality that this plan that God had for
[1:07:05] us he is determined to see it through to
[1:07:08] fruition now God is a is a creature that
[1:07:12] many times people don't understand
[1:07:13] because they look at him through their
[1:07:15] own personal filters of looking at him
[1:07:17] and they study him based upon uh what
[1:07:20] they think and what they believe
[1:07:22] themselves and many times that's
[1:07:24] dangerous because because what your
[1:07:26] thoughts about God may be could be as
[1:07:28] completely contrary to what he really is
[1:07:30] as day is from night that's why we have
[1:07:32] the Bible and why God provided the Bible
[1:07:35] for us so that we can study what he
[1:07:37] thinks as he is not just a guess at it
[1:07:40] or a suppose or hope so maybe so but we
[1:07:43] can actually see him in the word just as
[1:07:45] he really is and the word gives us that
[1:07:47] ability that that illumination if you
[1:07:50] will to be able to look into his
[1:07:52] character and look into what his Essence
[1:07:55] is to understand what God's all about
[1:07:58] now I I see many of you with pencils and
[1:08:00] things this morning I want to give you a
[1:08:01] remark that you can write down and study
[1:08:03] uh sometime later after the message and
[1:08:06] I want you to remember this that God
[1:08:08] does not desire to be a lawgiver God
[1:08:12] does not desire to be a judge to be a
[1:08:15] lawgiver that's never been in the heart
[1:08:17] of God to be a judge or a lawgiver and
[1:08:21] I'll go on record this morning and make
[1:08:23] this remark to you that it's that God
[1:08:25] any time the Lord Jesus has ever had to
[1:08:27] whip us or correct us it's never be been
[1:08:30] because God wants to do you understand
[1:08:32] what I'm saying to you it's never been
[1:08:35] because God desired to but many times if
[1:08:38] God has to correct us or whip us or do
[1:08:40] something it's because our Behavior has
[1:08:43] forced his hand to have to correct us or
[1:08:46] make some change in our life or uh some
[1:08:48] circumstance he was cutting off and it's
[1:08:51] been us that's caused that out of God
[1:08:53] but he's never desired to be a judge
[1:08:55] over us or a lawgiver or to be someone
[1:08:59] that just completely uh as it was
[1:09:02] dictates like a dictator every area of
[1:09:04] our life and uh you know he wants to
[1:09:06] shove us in a corner and force us to be
[1:09:08] right and force us to be this and force
[1:09:11] us that's never been in God's heart but
[1:09:13] actually God at his core at the essence
[1:09:16] of what he really is God has always been
[1:09:20] love always from the very beginning he
[1:09:22] has been Lov now I want you to second of
[1:09:25] something for just a moment go in your
[1:09:27] minds to the Book of Exodus they're
[1:09:29] standing on the mountain and almighty
[1:09:31] God begins to bring to the people The
[1:09:34] Ten Commandments I I was laughing
[1:09:35] brother Smith the other night when I was
[1:09:37] sitting there in Lenor I I had he had a
[1:09:40] a little little table or desk or
[1:09:43] something there behind me and he had
[1:09:44] some plaqu on top of it one of them was
[1:09:46] the Ten Commandments and I had jumped up
[1:09:48] to get out of his way for something and
[1:09:50] sat down in the back of the chair knock
[1:09:52] that little desk and the Ten
[1:09:53] Commandments fell over and it broke his
[1:09:55] little a piece and two and I said oh
[1:09:57] brother I'm so sorry he said brother Ben
[1:09:59] that's okay they've been broke before he
[1:10:01] said I thought that was all right but I
[1:10:04] was thinking of some things on that when
[1:10:06] that little that little plaque fell on
[1:10:08] the ground and I thought you know really
[1:10:10] when when the people wanted judgment out
[1:10:12] of God really God didn't want to give it
[1:10:15] to him really it was not in God's heart
[1:10:17] to want to measure out to them Ten
[1:10:19] Commandments to control or dictate their
[1:10:22] life brother bam said they already had
[1:10:24] the pillar of Fire they already had the
[1:10:26] smitten Rock they already had the cloud
[1:10:28] they already had Grace and brother said
[1:10:30] Grace provided all of these things for
[1:10:32] their lives Grace provided a prophet
[1:10:34] Grace provided the cloud Grace provided
[1:10:36] the pillar of fire Grace provided manic
[1:10:39] Grace provided the water Grace provided
[1:10:41] Grace provided so God in his very
[1:10:44] essence in the way that he dealt with
[1:10:45] his children in the very beginning it
[1:10:48] never was upon the basis of law or being
[1:10:51] a lawgiver but it was love that God
[1:10:54] measured out to the people of God it was
[1:10:56] really man on the mountain if you go
[1:10:58] back and look does God change his mind
[1:11:00] about his word the prophet said it was
[1:11:02] man that cried out for the law we want a
[1:11:05] law God didn't want to give it to them
[1:11:07] they wanted the law themselves something
[1:11:09] that could govern themselves and so like
[1:11:11] that why because God in the beginning
[1:11:13] never desired to be a lawgiver now that
[1:11:16] doesn't mean to say that the Lord Jesus
[1:11:18] doesn't have standards that he didn't
[1:11:20] set rules that he didn't set regulations
[1:11:23] a friend of mine said it like this the
[1:11:24] other day when people talk about
[1:11:26] Holiness and holy living and they say oh
[1:11:28] living by rules and regulations and I I
[1:11:31] like what he said he used the example
[1:11:33] and he said brother Ben I I I preached
[1:11:35] it like this the other night he said
[1:11:37] that if you have a doctor we'll say a
[1:11:39] couple doctors and one wanted to build a
[1:11:40] house and he said that house would be a
[1:11:42] $1.5 million house and he builds the
[1:11:45] house another doctor beside him has a
[1:11:47] $2.5 million house and he said now
[1:11:50] they're part of a little Community you
[1:11:52] know and they have rules in this
[1:11:53] community of how that they build things
[1:11:56] he said well you got one doctor with a
[1:11:57] million dollar house this side $2
[1:11:59] million house that side he said then all
[1:12:01] of a sudden Here Comes Billy Bob with
[1:12:04] his pickup truck and all the hound dogs
[1:12:06] in the back with the trailer in toe and
[1:12:08] he sets it up right in between them two
[1:12:10] doctors he said now if you ask them
[1:12:11] doctors if they are thankful for rules
[1:12:14] and regulations they're going to tell
[1:12:16] you yes as they're thankful that the
[1:12:18] that the community doesn't allow Billy
[1:12:20] Bob and his Fox hand to live right next
[1:12:22] door to their million-dollar Mansion
[1:12:24] well that's the way it is in serving the
[1:12:25] lord it's the same way we say well rules
[1:12:28] and regulation but see God doesn't want
[1:12:30] us to live according to a mandate
[1:12:32] because it's legalism because he wants
[1:12:34] us just to be bound or restricted but it
[1:12:37] is for our own protection it's for our
[1:12:40] own safety it's for our own happiness
[1:12:42] just like them doctors they wouldn't
[1:12:44] want to see you know the rebel flag of
[1:12:46] flying and the hound dogs in the front
[1:12:47] yard they're doctors they want to live
[1:12:49] with people of Their Own Kind well
[1:12:51] that's what the word of God does when it
[1:12:53] measures out a rule or a regulation is
[1:12:56] because God wants us to to fellowship
[1:12:59] and associate with our own
[1:13:02] kind I don't mind telling you but I'm
[1:13:04] glad I don't have to share streets of
[1:13:06] gold with
[1:13:07] murderers with Liars with if I'm going
[1:13:10] to share them over there then I might as
[1:13:11] well just stay here because that's what
[1:13:14] I'm sharing them with now I'm glad that
[1:13:16] heaven has got a regulation to it but in
[1:13:19] the very same token God never desired
[1:13:22] that we would live according to the law
[1:13:24] it was in his Essence in the beginning
[1:13:26] it was love it was Grace and that's what
[1:13:29] God wanted to show to us now watch this
[1:13:32] just out of the dictionary here I want
[1:13:33] to give you the definition of the word
[1:13:35] essence I think this really defines a
[1:13:38] lot for us this morning it is the
[1:13:40] characteristic of a thing that
[1:13:42] determines its identity the fundamental
[1:13:46] nature of that thing for example a piano
[1:13:49] the very essence of that piano is that
[1:13:51] it plays it has keys white and black
[1:13:54] keys has a certain sound 88 keys on it
[1:13:57] it has 12 chords it can do different uh
[1:14:00] octaves and so forth that is the
[1:14:02] fundamental nature of that piano so if
[1:14:05] you're playing a harmonica you've got a
[1:14:07] different Essence the essence of that
[1:14:09] piano is what you see out of it it's its
[1:14:12] fundamental nature but and John here is
[1:14:15] identifying for us that God's
[1:14:17] fundamental nature is that God is of
[1:14:20] love he tells us love one another but
[1:14:22] God is love in the same way so it's not
[1:14:25] that God just has a lot of love inside
[1:14:27] of it but God is of love anything that
[1:14:31] is of this perfect agape love God is for
[1:14:34] it and God is in it and God is behind it
[1:14:37] now I want you to notice this it is the
[1:14:39] very unchangeable nature of of the of
[1:14:43] the object itself ever what it is if
[1:14:45] it's an orange fundamentally the essence
[1:14:47] of that orange is it is always going to
[1:14:49] be an orange you cannot look at it and
[1:14:51] make it an apple you cannot take a bite
[1:14:53] out of it it tastes like a banana what
[1:14:55] it is is what it is so if I could say it
[1:14:58] this way every time you take a bite out
[1:14:59] of God it's the love of God love every
[1:15:02] time you enter into God anytime you
[1:15:04] associate with God love will always be
[1:15:07] the fundamental nature of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:10] himself this is why friends a lot of
[1:15:12] times when people are presenting the
[1:15:14] Lord Jesus and they present him as a
[1:15:15] judge and a lawgiver and there's never
[1:15:18] any mercy and there's never any Grace
[1:15:20] you can tell already that person does
[1:15:22] not understand the fundamental nature of
[1:15:25] the Holy
[1:15:26] Ghost praise the Lord you can say man it
[1:15:28] ain't going to scare me or God either
[1:15:29] one come on somebody exactly right the
[1:15:32] holy spirit is love God by his love that
[1:15:36] is the very essence and the Very nature
[1:15:38] of loveing himself I love this right
[1:15:40] here in the commentary on the
[1:15:42] Corinthians in First Corinthians chapter
[1:15:44] 13 that we read from there he uses this
[1:15:46] word love or the Greek word Agape now
[1:15:50] what's interesting about the word that
[1:15:52] Paul uses here is that this fundamental
[1:15:55] word this word Agape never shows up in
[1:15:58] any other language under Heaven as a
[1:16:00] matter of fact there's not one language
[1:16:03] that actually identifies properly the
[1:16:05] word Agape it's actually a word that God
[1:16:09] gives over to the Apostle Paul to bring
[1:16:12] in for the love of God it's actually I
[1:16:14] wouldn't say an invented word but God by
[1:16:17] inspiration leads Paul to show what real
[1:16:20] love is now every other language whether
[1:16:22] it be the uh whether it be Latin or or
[1:16:25] whatever it might be every word that
[1:16:26] they Define when they use the word love
[1:16:28] they identify it as Fellowship love
[1:16:31] identified as relationship love as
[1:16:33] friendship love but up until this time
[1:16:36] of the Lord Jesus and Paul the word love
[1:16:39] always represented friends or family but
[1:16:41] then when Jesus looks at Peter and he
[1:16:44] says Peter lovest thou me then he tells
[1:16:47] him feely oh my sheep feel oh my sheep
[1:16:49] Peter lovest th me then he says Agape or
[1:16:52] feed my sheep love my sheep give old to
[1:16:55] my sheep the very words that Jesus uses
[1:16:58] takes him from the ailio into the agapa
[1:17:01] and then the Apostle Paul being the one
[1:17:03] that was commissioned to open up the
[1:17:04] mysteries of God then he takes this very
[1:17:07] word and he Blends it in with a man
[1:17:09] growing from a child unto an adult look
[1:17:12] at it again there in 1 Corinthians 13
[1:17:14] where Paul said I was a child and I
[1:17:16] spake like a child I understood as a
[1:17:18] child I thought as a child but when I
[1:17:21] became a man I put away childish things
[1:17:23] now watch he said for now I see through
[1:17:26] a glass Darkly oh my what's he talking
[1:17:30] about God's love the essence of God's
[1:17:32] love himself his faith his hope his
[1:17:36] charity I'm looking as it were through a
[1:17:38] glass dly as I go and I begin to
[1:17:41] investigate what God really is and study
[1:17:43] what he really is I look through him I
[1:17:46] look at him and I look by him as I would
[1:17:49] look into a glass Darkly oh my and I
[1:17:52] would see the image of something but yet
[1:17:54] not understand it that's why on the very
[1:17:57] beginnings of our Christian walk with
[1:17:59] God we must understand the importance of
[1:18:01] being able to stick with that which we
[1:18:03] have begun because the first time you
[1:18:05] start serving the lord and as you begin
[1:18:07] to serve Christ you'll start out just a
[1:18:09] little measure of something and you'll
[1:18:11] see a little something about God oh it's
[1:18:13] a dim and it's a little sometimes but if
[1:18:15] you stick with it it begins to become
[1:18:17] more clear and become more
[1:18:19] understandable and you begin to see more
[1:18:21] about what he was why because as you
[1:18:24] look in this class Darkly Hallelujah it
[1:18:27] goes from being a child unto being an
[1:18:30] adult GL at least somebody blink at me
[1:18:33] every now and then praise the Lord
[1:18:36] exactly right well you say but brother
[1:18:37] Ben I don't understand how that it could
[1:18:40] be that way that's just the way God made
[1:18:42] it that's just the way God designed it
[1:18:44] you nobody is born a Christian full full
[1:18:46] grown that's right you got to grow all
[1:18:49] these children sitting around this
[1:18:50] building this morning they've got to
[1:18:51] grow this is the way God chose that they
[1:18:54] would come on the Earth has come by the
[1:18:56] way of reproduction and come as a baby
[1:18:58] not as a full grown adult and
[1:19:00] spiritually it's the same way for you
[1:19:02] and I we come as children babies before
[1:19:06] God seeing through a glass Darkly but
[1:19:08] then we see face to face in other words
[1:19:11] the image comes clear yes my now notice
[1:19:15] this I just want to read to you out of
[1:19:16] the Hebrew series I love what brother B
[1:19:19] says here on paragraph 126 this is in uh
[1:19:22] the Hebrews the first chapter of Hebrews
[1:19:24] as they studied there in 57 he said
[1:19:26] could you imagine before there was even
[1:19:27] an
[1:19:28] earth before there was a light before
[1:19:31] there was a star before there was
[1:19:34] anything this great Fountain going forth
[1:19:38] of spirit out of this Fountain he says
[1:19:41] comes the most pure
[1:19:44] love because there was nothing else for
[1:19:46] it to come from that but love and
[1:19:48] brother says what we call Love Today is
[1:19:51] perverted love but just as we get an
[1:19:54] Essence glory to God or a little bit of
[1:19:57] that opinion amen he said that love and
[1:20:00] US rather it changes our whole opinion
[1:20:03] just as soon as we get a little bit of
[1:20:05] that love in US it changes our whole
[1:20:08] opinion it changes my opinion to his
[1:20:11] opinion it changes my thoughts to his
[1:20:15] thoughts now notice how brother Bram
[1:20:17] described this this great Fountain of
[1:20:19] love so we go back into the beginning
[1:20:21] before there was a sun a moon a star
[1:20:24] before there was anything but God God in
[1:20:27] the beginning in his own creative work
[1:20:30] what is he at his Essence at his core
[1:20:33] Brother Andy what is he he's love amen
[1:20:36] and he's not just Fellowship love
[1:20:38] friendship love marital love he love
[1:20:41] pure absolute love agape love it's like
[1:20:47] a fountain bubbling brother B said he's
[1:20:49] gurgling and bubbling and moving every
[1:20:51] which direction oh my if you could just
[1:20:54] close your eyes and go back in time and
[1:20:57] listen all you would hear is that
[1:20:59] Fountain of love burbling and gurling
[1:21:01] ding oh God God in his Essence there's
[1:21:05] no judgment there there's no
[1:21:07] condemnation there only
[1:21:09] love judgment is a result of the Fall In
[1:21:14] the Garden of Eden sin is a result of
[1:21:18] man walking away from God's eternal love
[1:21:20] right it's not a result of God wan to be
[1:21:22] mean to us right brother right
[1:21:25] you're going to have to get louder than
[1:21:26] a Baptist if you expect to make
[1:21:27] Pentecostal Rapture here come on now
[1:21:30] come on now come on now praise the Lord
[1:21:32] preach with me a little bit this morning
[1:21:34] we're talking about God's love all but
[1:21:36] you say that's something that I'll never
[1:21:38] attain to you're wrong God already
[1:21:40] attain to it before you could even know
[1:21:41] about it God's love for you do you
[1:21:45] understand the Bible said before either
[1:21:47] child was yet born he said Jacob I love
[1:21:50] Esau I hated so if God showed his love
[1:21:53] to you he showed it to you before you
[1:21:55] was even
[1:21:56] you hello somebody God showed you his
[1:22:00] love and manifested his love to you that
[1:22:03] you might understand he is love my just
[1:22:07] as soon as we get a little bit or an
[1:22:10] essence of that love in US it changes
[1:22:13] our whole opinion so that's why you go
[1:22:14] to understanding you could preach to
[1:22:16] people 24 hours a day but if one little
[1:22:19] spot of God's love ever touches their
[1:22:21] heart it changes them forever yes it
[1:22:24] changes them forever praise God because
[1:22:27] no matter how much they read in the
[1:22:28] Bible no matter how much they hear
[1:22:29] preached if God doesn't reveal himself
[1:22:32] to them and touch their hearts with that
[1:22:35] little bit of essence from God's
[1:22:37] character that little bit of something
[1:22:39] that makes him God if they never feel
[1:22:42] that touch yes no matter how much they
[1:22:44] read about him in the Bible they'll have
[1:22:46] the same old opinions the same old
[1:22:48] thoughts the same old belief system they
[1:22:49] always had brother Jesse yes sir but the
[1:22:52] moment the Holy Spirit ever moves on
[1:22:53] their heart
[1:22:55] it changes their
[1:22:57] opinion Hall oh praise the Lamb of God
[1:23:01] hallelujah yes it changes their opinion
[1:23:04] now watch in St John chapter 3 we're all
[1:23:07] familiar with this
[1:23:09] 16-9 all right just just look at this
[1:23:11] for just a moment with me all right God
[1:23:13] so loved the world that he gave his only
[1:23:16] begotten son that whosoever should
[1:23:18] believeth in him should not perish but
[1:23:20] have everlasting life the prophet said
[1:23:22] that's a perishing generation of people
[1:23:24] said all right but watch in verse 17 for
[1:23:28] God sent not his son into the world to
[1:23:30] condemn the world but that the world
[1:23:33] through him might be
[1:23:36] saved so what was God's Essence in the
[1:23:39] beginning love yes he wanted all of us
[1:23:41] to have a chance all of us to have an
[1:23:44] opportunity yes now friends listen to me
[1:23:46] carefully do you understand that when
[1:23:48] you go to condemning yourself and
[1:23:49] throwing yourself in hell as though you
[1:23:51] have no chance you're actually working
[1:23:53] contrary to what God wanted for your
[1:23:55] life oh I'll never make it I'll never
[1:23:57] amount to nothing do you realize you are
[1:23:59] moving contrary to what God wanted in
[1:24:01] your
[1:24:02] heart cuz God wanted the best for us in
[1:24:06] the beginning is anybody going to preach
[1:24:08] with me this morning God wanted the best
[1:24:11] for us this he doesn't want the worst
[1:24:13] for us he's not waiting to hit us over
[1:24:15] the head and throw us in help God love
[1:24:22] us oh
[1:24:25] praise the Lord oh I but I know why some
[1:24:27] are quiet I know why you are Ain because
[1:24:28] you're sleepy it's because this is a
[1:24:30] hard thing for some people to swallow
[1:24:33] they've never been able to grasp onto
[1:24:34] God's love that's what I want to come
[1:24:36] after that devil this morning and let
[1:24:37] him know there's people sitting here
[1:24:39] that God
[1:24:40] loves your mama may not have loved you
[1:24:42] Daddy may not have loved you may not
[1:24:44] have family that loved you but there's
[1:24:45] one that did love you and that's the
[1:24:46] Lord Jesus Christ right I plan on
[1:24:49] smacking that hate devil in the mouth
[1:24:51] this morning hard as I can hit him
[1:24:54] that's exactly right now watch he said
[1:24:56] he that believeth on him is not
[1:24:58] condemned see but he that believeth not
[1:25:02] is condemned already because this is why
[1:25:05] he hath not believed in the name of the
[1:25:08] only begotten Son of God and this is the
[1:25:10] condemnation that light has come into
[1:25:13] the world that men loved Darkness rather
[1:25:17] than light because their deeds were evil
[1:25:20] right so it wasn't that God didn't love
[1:25:23] them it's just that they didn't love God
[1:25:25] amen amen well he would show his love to
[1:25:28] the world and he spread out his great
[1:25:31] wings of love over the people and he
[1:25:33] brooded over the whole humanity and he
[1:25:35] brooded over the generation of people he
[1:25:37] was preaching to the Bible said their
[1:25:39] deeds were evil and they loved darkness
[1:25:42] in other words they
[1:25:44] rejected God's love they
[1:25:47] rejected the essence of his character of
[1:25:49] who he was they rejected him oh my yes
[1:25:52] why do we get out of him because we
[1:25:54] don't reject him amen because we accept
[1:25:57] his love when he preaches things to us
[1:25:59] and sings things to us and oh my all the
[1:26:01] great things he does every little
[1:26:03] blessing of God do you realize my
[1:26:05] friends that we talk about having a book
[1:26:06] of Acts church do you realize it's
[1:26:08] already here amen I said it's already
[1:26:11] here am if you took down a book and you
[1:26:13] started writing down every little tiny
[1:26:15] thing and if you don't know how to keep
[1:26:16] Good Records brother John gram will
[1:26:18] teach you how to keep Good Records on
[1:26:20] how to do things I he's a wonderful
[1:26:22] notaker and I I need a little bit more
[1:26:24] John but you understand that if we wrote
[1:26:26] down everything in a book and wrote
[1:26:29] everything down of what God has blessed
[1:26:31] us on a daily basis for one year do you
[1:26:34] realize you could flip through them
[1:26:35] pages and see a book of Acts and action
[1:26:37] in your life
[1:26:40] already people in the church are always
[1:26:42] concerned with raising the dead i' like
[1:26:44] to see some of y'all raise your hands
[1:26:45] this
[1:26:46] morning praise the Lord I'm talking
[1:26:48] about book of Acts God loves us and
[1:26:51] wants us to enter into a greater depth
[1:26:54] of his love than we've ever entered into
[1:26:56] before in our
[1:26:58] life amen oh that his love what's make
[1:27:02] me what makes me feel like I feel this
[1:27:03] morning that's what it is that's right
[1:27:05] because I can't feel this way on my own
[1:27:07] that's for sure this is the condemnation
[1:27:09] that light has come into the world
[1:27:11] because men loved Darkness rather than
[1:27:15] light why because their D Deeds were
[1:27:17] evil now watch you an
[1:27:19] identification but said like this he
[1:27:21] said Jesus came to sa that which was
[1:27:22] lost that's what he did
[1:27:24] now there had to be something to save
[1:27:27] this
[1:27:29] lost now watch close so it had to be a
[1:27:33] different
[1:27:34] character than that which was
[1:27:38] lost so when Jesus was born Jesus could
[1:27:42] not have come the same way that we come
[1:27:44] or else it have been the same character
[1:27:46] trying to save the same character right
[1:27:49] so Jesus had to come a different way as
[1:27:51] we looked at a couple times throughout
[1:27:53] the last all several months in different
[1:27:55] parts of the country and so forth
[1:27:57] preaching I've said this over and over
[1:28:00] and over again the reason Jesus had to
[1:28:02] be born virgin born was because the
[1:28:05] character of God could not be expressed
[1:28:08] in the
[1:28:09] fullness through a sex born body he
[1:28:12] couldn't do it it had to be virgin born
[1:28:14] amen and that's the whole reason why
[1:28:16] that we have the Holy Ghost this morning
[1:28:17] because our hearts are virgin born
[1:28:19] that's why you got to die first amen
[1:28:22] amen praise the Lord yes sir you've got
[1:28:24] to die to yourself in order to be
[1:28:25] resurrected that's the only way that his
[1:28:28] character can be manifested in a sex
[1:28:30] born body so Jesus himself had to be
[1:28:33] virgin born why because the fall brought
[1:28:35] through sexual acts and so forth with
[1:28:37] the servant Eve commit adultery what
[1:28:39] more that sex act brought us in that
[1:28:41] condition so Jesus could not come
[1:28:43] through a sex act himself he had to be
[1:28:45] created it had to be above the the the
[1:28:48] natural birth in order to bring on the
[1:28:50] character of God oh
[1:28:52] Hallelujah then he said find it must be
[1:28:55] a different character than that which
[1:28:57] was lost so God looked down upon his
[1:28:59] creation the characters of this Earth he
[1:29:02] said his loving character was molded
[1:29:05] into the person of Jesus Christ to be
[1:29:08] the savior of the
[1:29:10] world Hallelujah Jesus was the very
[1:29:14] character of God all right tell me about
[1:29:19] him was he judgmental critical harsh
[1:29:23] ready to everybody in hell that he
[1:29:25] met no that's that's people we know in
[1:29:27] the
[1:29:30] message
[1:29:31] amen people we work with that's the boss
[1:29:35] down the
[1:29:35] street ready to throw everybody off in
[1:29:38] hell that don't agree with us now you
[1:29:40] know what Jesus what kind of character
[1:29:43] did he manifest tell me church love amen
[1:29:47] love he manifested love to our dying
[1:29:50] Humanity this is why his Essence if it's
[1:29:53] in inside of us will be the same way we
[1:29:56] won't be ready to throw off on everybody
[1:29:58] that moves right I think I told you this
[1:30:01] before if I didn't allow me to tell you
[1:30:02] again I'm getting ready to preach a
[1:30:04] message pretty soon the woman at the
[1:30:06] Well's first day at
[1:30:08] [Music]
[1:30:09] church because I would love to hear and
[1:30:12] see what people would have done the
[1:30:13] woman at the Well's first day coming to
[1:30:15] church I imagine they would have
[1:30:17] whispered and AR you know that woman you
[1:30:18] know what she's all about you remember
[1:30:20] that preacher down the road uhhuh she
[1:30:22] was the piano player
[1:30:24] come on somebody you imagine what it
[1:30:27] must have been but Jesus looking at this
[1:30:29] prostitute he manifested the love of God
[1:30:32] to her when everybody else would have
[1:30:34] brought her off in
[1:30:36] him now if we got that same love in us
[1:30:39] we must have the same character or
[1:30:41] something is
[1:30:43] wrong well I disagree with Sone I don't
[1:30:45] like sonone I I is that really the
[1:30:47] character of the love of almighty God is
[1:30:50] really must be something so much
[1:30:52] different than that watch now he said it
[1:30:54] fulfilled the Lord Jesus fulfilled St
[1:30:56] John 3 and16 God so loved the world that
[1:31:00] he gave that he gave this love to the
[1:31:03] world did the love receive it did the
[1:31:05] world receive it rather this love of God
[1:31:07] absolutely not the majority of them
[1:31:08] turned it down everywhere he turned it
[1:31:10] called him be El but called him this
[1:31:12] called him that but yet those oh my that
[1:31:16] have the ability to receive this
[1:31:18] love they absorbed it
[1:31:24] that's okay if you don't want it that
[1:31:25] just means there's more for
[1:31:29] me God's love his love wases it really
[1:31:32] want it's okay if somebody else don't
[1:31:34] want it that just leads more for me amen
[1:31:37] love moved a mighty God God so Lov the
[1:31:40] world the
[1:31:41] unlovable a talk about
[1:31:43] me he loved the
[1:31:46] unlovable until he made himself flesh
[1:31:48] here on the earth and was spit on
[1:31:50] mistreated laughed at made fun of
[1:31:54] yeah and yet what did the love of God do
[1:31:56] in Jesus what did that Agape do inside
[1:31:59] of his heart father forgive them they
[1:32:02] don't know what they're
[1:32:04] doing you can understand deeply why
[1:32:07] there's going to be many people never
[1:32:08] make the
[1:32:10] Rapture you can understand they've got
[1:32:12] this critical type Spirit about a
[1:32:14] critical spirit is not of God amen amen
[1:32:18] you ever look up critical Look up the
[1:32:20] word critical look up its synonyms hair
[1:32:23] splitting
[1:32:25] that's one of
[1:32:27] them hair
[1:32:30] splitting with people around the ranks
[1:32:33] right brother right you say be careful
[1:32:35] no I'm careful all right but I'm just
[1:32:36] telling the truth I want to be
[1:32:37] responsible poor God of telling the
[1:32:39] truth yes sir yes sir absolutely right
[1:32:42] yes sir another one of its synonyms
[1:32:44] being being
[1:32:45] judgmental harsh yes I'm asking you
[1:32:48] children is these things the character
[1:32:50] of almighty God no no such attitude and
[1:32:54] such behavior is contrary to the very
[1:32:56] nature that God should have inside of
[1:32:58] our hearts if we got the Holy Ghost amen
[1:33:00] being critical and judgmental and harsh
[1:33:02] and splitting
[1:33:05] hairs Hallelujah well for was saying you
[1:33:08] may be the only Amen in this buch for
[1:33:10] this over
[1:33:11] with praise the Lord now watch the
[1:33:13] church in this condition man said God
[1:33:16] wanting to make love he had to make
[1:33:19] something
[1:33:21] lovable I thought y'all was going to get
[1:33:23] quiet or we quiet you're going to really
[1:33:25] get quiet now because I'm telling you
[1:33:27] you're the lovable oh not me brother Ben
[1:33:30] I'm not lovable God thought you
[1:33:33] were he thought you were lovable he
[1:33:35] thought there was something about your
[1:33:37] heart that he could make love
[1:33:40] to and because he felt that way
[1:33:43] Hallelujah God so loved the world that
[1:33:46] he sent his son into the world you
[1:33:48] understand when John says that this is
[1:33:50] an expression of God's love that this
[1:33:53] propitiation of Jesus being sent into
[1:33:55] the world there's no way that you and I
[1:33:57] could even make it out of here except
[1:33:59] for in that body that human virgin born
[1:34:02] body that was glorified taken to the
[1:34:04] right hand of the father that expressed
[1:34:06] all of God's character down in Jesus
[1:34:08] that's the only way we make it out of
[1:34:10] here because we don't make it out of
[1:34:11] here in our own body because the Bible
[1:34:13] didn't say by one Spirit we're all
[1:34:14] baptized into our own
[1:34:16] body by one Spirit we're all baptized
[1:34:19] into his body Christ body praise the
[1:34:22] Lord we're Church come on now we're not
[1:34:25] baptized into a theology or a Doctrine
[1:34:28] we're baptized into a
[1:34:30] person and that person is the Lord
[1:34:33] Jesus Oh but you said brother being now
[1:34:35] you went too
[1:34:36] far calling me The Lovable you don't
[1:34:39] know me well evidently God did right
[1:34:43] evidently he knew your inner parts he
[1:34:45] knew what you're all
[1:34:46] about yeah but you're saying I'm lovable
[1:34:48] that's what God thinks I'm not telling
[1:34:50] you what I think if you you knew me you
[1:34:53] might not like me at all maybe I don't
[1:34:55] know H if I really knew the depths of
[1:34:58] you and the secret parts of you maybe I
[1:35:00] wouldn't like you but there's one thing
[1:35:01] about it God liked you and he loved you
[1:35:03] am oh you said that's just too much I
[1:35:06] can't receive that you know why because
[1:35:09] it's easier for us to reject and say
[1:35:11] that God couldn't possibly love somebody
[1:35:13] like us than it is to accept that great
[1:35:16] love of God that's why I tell you one of
[1:35:17] the biggest things that I deal with more
[1:35:19] than anything else is people telling me
[1:35:20] I don't believe God love me because they
[1:35:22] think in order for God to love them they
[1:35:23] had to be perfect they had to be sinless
[1:35:25] they had to be this and that and the
[1:35:26] other as a matter of fact you could be
[1:35:28] the biggest scumball on scumbag on the
[1:35:30] face of the planet and yet God still
[1:35:32] loves you
[1:35:37] am amen come on now that's he lovable
[1:35:42] yes he thought so he thought so he had
[1:35:45] it in his heart that way that's why he
[1:35:48] sent Jesus to the world he didn't send
[1:35:49] Jesus for the purpose of just oh maybe
[1:35:51] somebody feel sorry about this whole
[1:35:53] thing and
[1:35:54] M hear this sad story about Jesus dying
[1:35:56] at Calvary maybe somebody will want to
[1:35:58] get saved Down the Road God don't run
[1:36:00] his business like
[1:36:02] that he don't run his business hoping
[1:36:04] make people feel sorry that's why we
[1:36:07] don't get up here and tell Baptist
[1:36:08] sermons and try to get everybody crying
[1:36:10] talk them about how their grandmother
[1:36:11] died and all we don't bring people to
[1:36:13] the altar try to get them saved over sad
[1:36:15] stories right people get saved because
[1:36:18] they come to truth they come to the word
[1:36:21] hello that's how we understand who we
[1:36:23] are are God does not base his love upon
[1:36:27] your
[1:36:32] goodness I know that's tough I know it's
[1:36:34] hard to swallow but it's
[1:36:36] true well if I was a good person but
[1:36:39] that has nothing to do with God's
[1:36:43] love listen to me close if you were born
[1:36:47] wrong how could you ever be a good
[1:36:49] person amen that you eat there was day
[1:36:52] you died you were born sin shape and
[1:36:54] iniquity came to the world speaking lies
[1:36:55] you were already born a loser not a
[1:36:58] winner you were born a loser you already
[1:37:00] broke the word you were a breaker of
[1:37:02] God's word the moment you took the
[1:37:03] breath of life oh sure if you're a baby
[1:37:04] and under the age of accountability the
[1:37:06] Holy Ghost will overtake and undertake
[1:37:07] for such as that we know that but you
[1:37:09] were born a
[1:37:10] loser right you were born a sinner you
[1:37:12] were born a breaker of God's word he
[1:37:14] that breaks one word is guilty of the
[1:37:15] whole thing amen right come on the
[1:37:18] word's amen you can say it ain't going
[1:37:19] to hurt you come on now
[1:37:21] children than why why would God demand
[1:37:25] you be perfect in order to receive his
[1:37:28] love when he already had it planned out
[1:37:32] that man would come to the world
[1:37:33] imperfectly
[1:37:37] Amen if he already had it fixed in his
[1:37:40] mind that Eve and Adam was going to fall
[1:37:42] in the Garden of Eden they were going to
[1:37:44] leave the word and every person born
[1:37:46] thereafter would be born subsequently in
[1:37:49] sin and be born in death if God demanded
[1:37:52] you to be a perfect person or to be a
[1:37:54] good person before he showed his love
[1:37:57] why would God do such a thing and plan
[1:37:58] man to fall from the very beginning it
[1:38:00] would seem like God was trapping you so
[1:38:02] he couldn't love you that's why his love
[1:38:04] is not dependent on whether I was a good
[1:38:06] boy today or a good boy tomorrow I was a
[1:38:08] bad boy today I guess God love me about
[1:38:10] halfway because it's halfway
[1:38:13] good oh I told I done told you that no
[1:38:16] reason you're getting quiet it's hard
[1:38:17] for you to receive this hard for this to
[1:38:20] put it inside of your heart oh you say
[1:38:22] God's love yes God's love but did God
[1:38:25] love me when I was yet a sinner that's
[1:38:27] what the Bible
[1:38:30] say she said brother Ben that's hard for
[1:38:32] me to swallow but that's okay you're an
[1:38:34] eagle you got a big
[1:38:37] throat told God to swallow it right down
[1:38:40] to the stomach to the toes
[1:38:42] near
[1:38:44] amen God wanted to make love you just
[1:38:48] think of this if Jesus was to walk to
[1:38:50] your Pew and walk right up by you
[1:38:54] and say would you worship me would you
[1:38:57] love me would you show me some praise
[1:39:00] how many of you would smack him in the
[1:39:01] face spit on him get away from
[1:39:05] me hang on
[1:39:07] everybody but we do the very same thing
[1:39:09] in our
[1:39:10] attitude right when the word tries to
[1:39:13] tell us we're redeemed and we're
[1:39:16] loved yes come on a Ohio you don't have
[1:39:19] to sit looking a bunch of Gees I know
[1:39:21] where I'm at I know what's on I know
[1:39:24] it's hard to swallow this into your
[1:39:26] heart but our attitude many times shows
[1:39:30] him we really don't
[1:39:31] believe that he loved us un
[1:39:34] unquestionably you say I know that do
[1:39:36] you then how come you come to church sit
[1:39:38] there and beat on yourself the whole
[1:39:39] time you're in
[1:39:40] church I'm no good I'm sorry I'm this if
[1:39:43] he preaches on Kane oh that's me I'm K
[1:39:45] preaches on Judas I've got to be a
[1:39:47] Judas you know why you think that way
[1:39:49] because you haven't really received that
[1:39:51] love into your heart in the right way
[1:39:52] right cu you realize that love was shed
[1:39:55] abroad for you and I without
[1:39:58] condition amen unconditionally God shed
[1:40:02] forth his love shed forth his Mercy he
[1:40:05] never asked for nothing in
[1:40:07] return if you do I'll do God said I've
[1:40:10] already done
[1:40:11] it amen it didn't say if you come to
[1:40:14] church pay ties and you show up so many
[1:40:15] services and you you pray for the past
[1:40:17] that a't what what makes God's love God
[1:40:20] loved us even we whether we don't do oh
[1:40:22] come on somebody whether we do it or
[1:40:24] whether we don't God love me anyways am
[1:40:29] you say my goodness that's such a hard
[1:40:31] thing I know that's why I'm
[1:40:33] preaching I know I know it
[1:40:35] is simple messages like this I learned a
[1:40:38] long time ago the reason why people act
[1:40:40] like they don't want to listen to it is
[1:40:41] because it's hard for them to receive
[1:40:43] it they pretend in their mind whenever
[1:40:45] you go to preaching to people about
[1:40:46] God's love they just say oh I got it and
[1:40:48] they just push it away but really the
[1:40:50] dep depth of it is they haven't really
[1:40:52] received it like they need to amen
[1:40:54] that's right oh don't tell me people
[1:40:57] believe in the message left and right
[1:40:58] run after this thing and that thing what
[1:40:59] are they doing it for home splitting up
[1:41:02] and this thing and that thing happening
[1:41:03] why is it happening like that because
[1:41:05] somewhere there's a love problem there's
[1:41:07] a love issue down inside their heart the
[1:41:09] prophet of God said the world is dying
[1:41:11] for
[1:41:13] love may I go on record this morning and
[1:41:15] say the message people are dying for
[1:41:19] love amen preachers are dying for the
[1:41:22] Sheep are dying for the family dying for
[1:41:25] life
[1:41:27] amen and you our men get in a pull pit
[1:41:30] and preach doctrines and nothing against
[1:41:32] that right but doctr without knowing who
[1:41:34] it is that loved you in the first place
[1:41:36] ain't going to help you with nothing you
[1:41:38] got to know the man you're studying
[1:41:40] about loves you uncondition because if
[1:41:41] you don't know that nothing else is
[1:41:43] going to help you
[1:41:46] long
[1:41:48] hallelujah what good it to drive a car
[1:41:50] and have the freedom of driving the car
[1:41:51] when you don't know you got a title
[1:41:53] right right when you don't own the thing
[1:41:56] right right it's easier to drive that
[1:41:58] truck or that you know that pickup or
[1:41:59] that that Jeep or SUV or whatever is
[1:42:01] ride it down the road but whenever you
[1:42:04] miss that monthly payment they ring you
[1:42:06] up on the phone it makes it drive a
[1:42:07] little bit different don't
[1:42:09] it h how much Freedom comes whenever
[1:42:12] you've made that last payment feels like
[1:42:15] the steering wheel feels different when
[1:42:16] you drive it don't it if you ever paid a
[1:42:18] car off or a house or anything you know
[1:42:20] what I'm talking about your bed even
[1:42:22] sleeps a little bit different if you pay
[1:42:23] a house off or whatever might be right
[1:42:26] why because you've got confidence this
[1:42:27] is mine this is mine it's the same way
[1:42:30] with the Church of the Living God same
[1:42:32] thing with the message same thing with
[1:42:33] the Bible a person can never understand
[1:42:36] or appreciate the depths of God if they
[1:42:38] don't know the man that they're studying
[1:42:40] about really loves
[1:42:43] them oh I wish somebody would help me
[1:42:46] this morning I told you I'm going to
[1:42:48] punch that hate devil right in the nose
[1:42:50] he needs to understand the people of God
[1:42:52] have been loved by their father before
[1:42:56] the foundation not just the moment you
[1:42:57] walked in the church not every time you
[1:43:00] say am man to the word not every time
[1:43:01] you're a good boy a good girl but he
[1:43:03] loved you before the foundation of the
[1:43:06] world before there was a son or a moon
[1:43:08] he already loved
[1:43:10] you always wish somebody would
[1:43:13] help he loved you already in the very
[1:43:17] beginning his love was shed abroad for
[1:43:20] you amen this great fountain bubbling
[1:43:23] and gurgling and burbling I try to think
[1:43:25] of the words to make you get the image
[1:43:27] in your mind right right just like that
[1:43:30] bubbling and that Fountain just bubbling
[1:43:32] by just gurgling and belching with the
[1:43:34] different little sounds all the love of
[1:43:36] God every bit of it the love of God his
[1:43:40] love shed abroad do you realize the
[1:43:42] whole reason we're in a world tonight
[1:43:44] the whole reason we have wood and
[1:43:46] carpets and trees and sunshine God was
[1:43:51] wanting to make love to somebody amen
[1:43:53] yes sir amen do we love him do we really
[1:43:58] love him like we should do we love him
[1:44:00] in the way of our attitude of knowing
[1:44:02] that no matter what's going on our life
[1:44:03] This Man Called Jesus Loves Me
[1:44:06] Hallelujah listen we haven't got there
[1:44:08] yet it's time for us to get there if
[1:44:11] we'd haven't got there we think like a
[1:44:13] child we speak like a child we act like
[1:44:16] a child it's time for us to grow
[1:44:18] up you know how it is with these
[1:44:20] youngans they do something wrong and you
[1:44:22] whip them they'll pout and stop off to
[1:44:24] their room daddy don't even love me you
[1:44:27] know what that is that's a child same
[1:44:29] thing with you and I we start going
[1:44:30] through trials and going through
[1:44:31] problems and this and that oh Jesus
[1:44:33] don't love me but that's a child as a
[1:44:35] child acting that way but when you begin
[1:44:37] to grow up in God you realize when a
[1:44:38] trial comes along it ain't because daddy
[1:44:40] don't love you oh my Hallelujah but it's
[1:44:43] because Daddy's trying to prove that
[1:44:45] you're made of stuff the devil can't
[1:44:48] BL come on you realize when you become a
[1:44:52] man are you grow up in Christ that when
[1:44:54] than come your way they don't come your
[1:44:56] way because God hates you they come
[1:44:58] because he's trying to show his glory to
[1:45:00] you brother said like this God wants to
[1:45:03] surprise
[1:45:05] you surprise his wife with a
[1:45:09] gift Glory he puts you through something
[1:45:11] you'll go through a really really
[1:45:13] difficult and hard time and you'll think
[1:45:15] man my world's about to fall in but what
[1:45:17] you don't realize at the end of that
[1:45:18] trial God's got a big surprise gift
[1:45:20] waiting on you
[1:45:24] but if we have love and we have the
[1:45:25] right kind of understanding of love then
[1:45:28] we begin to understand God wanted to
[1:45:30] make something lovable that he could
[1:45:32] make love to I love this statement right
[1:45:34] here brother says he had to make
[1:45:36] something that of his own nature you
[1:45:38] couldn't love nothing that wasn't of
[1:45:40] your own nature loving has to unite with
[1:45:45] love yes so how else are we going to
[1:45:48] make the grave in this last day if we
[1:45:50] don't have the same type of lovable
[1:45:52] nature
[1:45:53] that Christ St
[1:45:55] himself Colossians chap 1
[1:45:59] 21-22 I read this to you last time I was
[1:46:01] here preaching on the guilt message but
[1:46:03] allow me to say it again tonight or this
[1:46:04] morning brother yes you were sometimes
[1:46:07] alienated in enemies in your
[1:46:10] mind but what did God do his enemy you
[1:46:13] slapped him on One Cheek you presented
[1:46:14] the other you took his coat and give you
[1:46:17] a
[1:46:18] cloak is treated his enemy I was his
[1:46:21] enemy when I was a sinner right now if
[1:46:24] he would have treated me based on my
[1:46:26] behavior as a sinner and he would have
[1:46:28] responded to me in the way of I my
[1:46:30] feeling as a sinner he would have never
[1:46:32] done no more with me to quit fooling
[1:46:34] with me walked off and left me thank God
[1:46:36] he had love for me even when I was there
[1:46:39] because if that love me right brother
[1:46:40] that I would have never been able to
[1:46:41] walk right on in the things of God
[1:46:42] because he said hey you gonna treat me
[1:46:44] that way fooy on
[1:46:47] you that's the way that a lot of people
[1:46:48] get in their mind the way God is oh but
[1:46:50] he's not that way see we were alienated
[1:46:53] we were enemies in our mind by Wicked
[1:46:55] works but he reconciled us see he
[1:46:57] reconciled Us in his body in his body to
[1:47:00] present you holy remember what John said
[1:47:02] by this love was manifested that Christ
[1:47:04] sent his
[1:47:06] son so in his body of Flesh through
[1:47:09] death I was presented to be unblamable
[1:47:12] unreprovable in his sight God so the way
[1:47:16] that even looks at me is different
[1:47:19] amen the way he sees me is different
[1:47:23] praise the Lord look at this in perfect
[1:47:25] faith brother man said God came down in
[1:47:27] that
[1:47:31] muck well brother Ben I you know I was
[1:47:33] raised in the church I was raised in the
[1:47:35] message I was it doesn't matter you was
[1:47:36] in the muck like everybody else
[1:47:40] was amen long as you're a sinner you're
[1:47:42] in M that's
[1:47:44] right I've had people tell me oh brother
[1:47:47] Ben you know you don't know what it's
[1:47:48] like to be in the world I sat by two
[1:47:50] preachers sometime ago and these two men
[1:47:52] just I was ashamed of actually they sat
[1:47:54] and bragged about what they used to do
[1:47:56] in the world you brother you don't know
[1:47:58] nothing about the world I know what it's
[1:48:00] like to run with women and drink and get
[1:48:01] some drunk here I thought Lord have
[1:48:04] mercy I just made this remark like this
[1:48:07] I said I may not have known physically
[1:48:09] and I may not known naturally what it
[1:48:11] was to drink and rum with women and
[1:48:12] everything else in the world but I do
[1:48:14] know this I know that if the Bible said
[1:48:16] he is a judger and a discerner of the
[1:48:19] thoughts and the intentions of a man's
[1:48:20] heart I was just as guilty is arrested
[1:48:23] them guys because I intended to do
[1:48:25] everything they were
[1:48:27] doing my intention was if I get the
[1:48:30] opportunity I'm gonna do thus and thus
[1:48:31] and thus and thus and th that was inside
[1:48:34] of this old Wicked heart so if God
[1:48:36] judges a Man based on his intentions I'm
[1:48:38] just as guilty is AR
[1:48:40] rest right amen raised in the church
[1:48:44] M yes God came down in the muck amen
[1:48:49] glory I I don't know I I've always been
[1:48:52] a good person
[1:48:57] mck the Bible even said our
[1:48:59] righteousness is what filthy
[1:49:02] rags for this sister I don't want to be
[1:49:04] offensive or sound ugly but you know
[1:49:06] what that rag represents that's the
[1:49:08] that's the monthly rag right that's what
[1:49:10] God looks at our righteousness right
[1:49:13] forgive me the truth God looks right
[1:49:16] down at us and sees our righteousness
[1:49:18] and say you think that's something ain't
[1:49:22] nothing how can you have righteousness
[1:49:24] when you was born a breaker of the law
[1:49:26] right right was born a breaker of the
[1:49:28] word that's right brother see what she
[1:49:30] said that a created a perfect love in
[1:49:31] our hearts he said look what happened
[1:49:33] what somebody did somebody loved
[1:49:39] you Somebody Loved Me
[1:49:42] amen oh I just love this right here I
[1:49:45] like this little remark said one of the
[1:49:47] greatest hindrances in the church today
[1:49:49] that's kept the Revival back is the lack
[1:49:53] of Godly love that Christ expressed when
[1:49:55] he was here on
[1:49:58] there that's what's kept the Revival off
[1:50:01] of people because they just don't love
[1:50:03] God like they ought to Amen brother and
[1:50:05] they don't love one another like they
[1:50:06] ought to hey brother I promise you if
[1:50:09] you don't fall in love with Jesus it
[1:50:11] doesn't matter how hard you try or how
[1:50:13] much you memorize or what you do if
[1:50:14] you're not really in love with him folks
[1:50:17] will last
[1:50:19] old about like about like summer and
[1:50:21] spring and fall coming on
[1:50:23] right there'll be a season and then
[1:50:25] they're
[1:50:26] gone why why do people go for just a
[1:50:29] little while the Bible didn't say he
[1:50:30] that that in that begins the race but
[1:50:32] it's he that endures to the end that's
[1:50:35] the ones that will be
[1:50:36] saved because if you're not really in
[1:50:38] love with him in this message somewhere
[1:50:40] something will cross your path that'll
[1:50:42] make you turn the other direction hey a
[1:50:44] few years ago we might not have thought
[1:50:46] that but look what's happened amongst us
[1:50:47] the last four or five years things that
[1:50:49] we never would have dreamed taking place
[1:50:51] amongst us why because people really was
[1:50:53] not in love with
[1:50:56] God preaches pastoring churches for
[1:50:58] years and years and turn around walking
[1:50:59] off leave preaches preaching all over
[1:51:01] the place turny on walking off and leave
[1:51:02] why they was in love with being able to
[1:51:04] preach they was in love with being able
[1:51:05] to do things but if they was really in
[1:51:07] love with God it wouldn't really matter
[1:51:09] amen amen that's what I said about
[1:51:11] different preachers when they they reach
[1:51:13] a spot where they disqualify themselves
[1:51:14] from the pull pit many times they
[1:51:16] backslide all together I said if that
[1:51:18] man really loved God even though he
[1:51:19] couldn't preach he'd sat down still
[1:51:21] serve the Lord that's right amen brother
[1:51:23] yes sir praise the Lord somebody yes
[1:51:25] somebody disqualified thems by being a
[1:51:27] deacon or something of that nature and
[1:51:28] they just get up walk off leave the
[1:51:30] church that goes to prove they was
[1:51:31] wasn't in love with God they was in love
[1:51:32] with a church or a
[1:51:34] physician come on now because if they're
[1:51:36] in love with God it doesn't matter what
[1:51:38] comes their way they say Lord if I got
[1:51:40] to go into heaven with one less arm one
[1:51:43] less eye one less leg I want to make it
[1:51:46] amen oh and can I tell you something
[1:51:48] right here in aan Ohio it doesn't matter
[1:51:51] to me if Heaven is an Doby mud hut as
[1:51:54] long as Jesus is there that's what makes
[1:51:56] it heaven for amen because I'm not going
[1:51:59] to heaven because of streets of gold
[1:52:01] Gates of pearl or an angel choir I'm
[1:52:04] going to heaven because I love the man
[1:52:08] that created the place for
[1:52:10] me amen that's what'll make it heaven to
[1:52:13] me
[1:52:18] brother but does God love us does what
[1:52:22] the Bible say so I wish he'd prove it he
[1:52:25] does we're just not paying attention
[1:52:28] right brother right we're not really
[1:52:29] looking in the right places right well
[1:52:32] how do I know God love me did you wake
[1:52:33] up this morning yes sir yes
[1:52:37] sir amen got air in your lungs brain
[1:52:41] function beginning to wonder about a few
[1:52:43] of you this
[1:52:48] morning well if all of that God give you
[1:52:50] another opportunity to serve him it
[1:52:52] proves that he loves you thank you Jesus
[1:52:54] it's like the little sign I saw on the
[1:52:56] wall I think it's here in the church
[1:52:57] God's mercies are new every
[1:52:59] morning why because he loves us amen
[1:53:03] hallelujah beautiful it's hard for us to
[1:53:05] receive that because we had an uncle or
[1:53:08] we had an ant or we had a somebody that
[1:53:09] was mean to
[1:53:12] us right God must be the same type of
[1:53:14] person but he's not right cuz your aunt
[1:53:17] your uncle had conditions why they
[1:53:18] didn't love your mom and dad had
[1:53:20] conditions why they didn't love but God
[1:53:22] has no conditions like
[1:53:24] that that ought to straightened it out
[1:53:26] right there that ought solved it right
[1:53:29] there on the
[1:53:32] spot Jesus did not have that kind of
[1:53:35] love that Earthly type love it's easy to
[1:53:38] love somebody that loves
[1:53:40] you
[1:53:41] yes yes preach itach it sir let that
[1:53:45] straight a minute it's easy if somebody
[1:53:48] loves me oh I love them is that the same
[1:53:50] way with God yeah couldn't he turn right
[1:53:53] around and say oh it's easy for me to
[1:53:54] love soldiers because they love me but
[1:53:57] what about the unlovable that he still
[1:54:00] loveed yes this is why his wisdom and
[1:54:03] his understanding of things that's why
[1:54:05] that Eternal wisdom of God we'll never
[1:54:07] be able to figure out because you
[1:54:09] understand it's no mystery how I can
[1:54:10] love him the mystery is how can he love
[1:54:16] me GL
[1:54:19] amen God's love he didn't have this AAL
[1:54:22] love you scratch my back I'll scratch
[1:54:25] yours that's not the love of God God

[1:54:28] scratch yours
[1:54:30] anyways Lord God in his own Mercy he
[1:54:34] sought this bride even when she was
[1:54:39] unlovable when you was sitting on the
[1:54:41] bar stool whever where you was the Holy
[1:54:43] Ghost looked down and said come here
[1:54:45] Gabriel see that boy right there yeah I

[1:55:28] to shift for
[1:55:29] himself while he's down in that mess I
[1:55:32] can he cannot help himself in that
[1:55:34] condition so if I don't show my love to
[1:55:36] him he'll never get out me it'll get
[1:55:39] worse he'll go from one thing to another
[1:55:41] to another but if I go down in that muck

[1:56:17] world was unlovable oh my think of it
[1:56:21] God still loved the world
[1:56:22] yes yes the thing of it is Friends the
[1:56:25] human mind without the inspiration of
[1:56:28] the Holy
[1:56:29] Ghost don't know what compassion really
[1:56:33] means this is why there was no word in
[1:56:36] any language for the word love God's
[1:56:40] agape love until the Holy Spirit
[1:56:42] revealed it around the time of Jesus and
[1:56:45] Paul he comes and says
[1:56:47] a why would he say such a word why would
[1:56:50] he say such a thing because he wanted to
[1:56:53] show us what the essence of his love was
[1:56:55] yes sir
[1:56:56] amen oh Hallelujah makees sure you want
[1:56:58] go sit in the corner and cry for a while
[1:57:00] don't to think of such great love like
[1:57:05] that watch him in 1 Corinthians 13 can
[1:57:07] we turn there again yes sir I don't
[1:57:09] normally read this but I just feel led
[1:57:10] to this morning just by the leadership
[1:57:13] of the Lord so I like to keep my Bible
[1:57:15] right by me because I never know when my
[1:57:17] boss is going to say let's look at the
[1:57:18] blueprint a
[1:57:21] minute pick it up at verse one let's
[1:57:23] pick this up about this love of God
[1:57:25] watching though I speak with tongues of
[1:57:27] men and angels have not Char I become as
[1:57:30] a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol
[1:57:33] though I have the gift of Prophecy and
[1:57:35] understand all
[1:57:36] Mysteries well that puts message people
[1:57:38] in a spot don't it right right and all
[1:57:40] knowledge though I have all faith I can
[1:57:43] remove mountains and have not charity
[1:57:45] I'm nothing can I say something to you
[1:57:47] can I give you a real example yes though
[1:57:49] brother Bram could create squirrels so
[1:57:50] he could speak to the storm though he
[1:57:51] could had her sons though he could have
[1:57:54] faith dump truck loads of crutches could
[1:57:56] go down to the ocean sing and only
[1:57:58] believe in a foreign tongue from all the
[1:57:59] hundreds of thousands that was healed
[1:58:01] through the campaigns if William Brandon
[1:58:02] didn't have love he'd have been a s
[1:58:04] brass in a
[1:58:06] tin see to me brother and sister what
[1:58:09] made this prophet of God such a great
[1:58:10] man was not these great things we just
[1:58:13] read down through here not the fact that
[1:58:14] he could go to pray for a blind girl
[1:58:16] that had no eyeballs she was blind
[1:58:18] because she didn't have eyeballs and it
[1:58:19] could stop right when he started to pray
[1:58:21] and say oh sister dear I forgot to ask
[1:58:22] you what color eyes do you
[1:58:25] want right she said I want blue eyes God
[1:58:28] give this little girl blue eyes and the
[1:58:29] Holy Spirit create blue eyes right in
[1:58:31] her head if she'd have said pinkle you
[1:58:33] know how children are if she said purple
[1:58:35] pink and Polkka doed she'd had purple
[1:58:37] pink and Polkka doted eyes because
[1:58:38] that's what God would have obeyed amen
[1:58:40] the commands of his son would have done
[1:58:42] just exactly like they prayed for yes
[1:58:44] sir yes sir that's not what made brother
[1:58:47] Bram a great man to me what stuck out to
[1:58:49] me more than anything else about William
[1:58:50] Bram was how much he was in love love of
[1:58:52] the man called the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:58:55] how that love translated to other people
[1:58:58] and how he lived his life for others
[1:59:00] amen amen you realiz a prophet of God
[1:59:03] said when you live your life for
[1:59:04] somebody else you are standing in the
[1:59:06] vestibule of
[1:59:08] Heaven that's the love I'm talking about
[1:59:10] the essence of God's love
[1:59:13] hallu
[1:59:14] amen though iow all my goods to feed the
[1:59:17] poor get my body to be burned and I have
[1:59:19] not charity it profiteth me
[1:59:23] nothing why because charity suffers long
[1:59:26] it's
[1:59:27] kind it vaunteth not itself I guarantee
[1:59:30] those are a few little qualities that
[1:59:31] I'd like to see more of in mess churches
[1:59:33] amen amen i' like to see kind people in
[1:59:36] mess churches yes sir I'd like to see
[1:59:39] some kind people because folks just
[1:59:41] ain't nice no more
[1:59:45] yeah am praise the Lord unless you're
[1:59:48] eating Cheerios with angels I'm sure
[1:59:51] not rub shoulders with the world like
[1:59:53] you do right right everywhere saman and
[1:59:56] I go we meet but people that are just
[1:59:58] not kind but charity makes you kind
[2:00:02] makes you kind makes you sweet makes you
[2:00:04] a gentleman makes you a lady yes just a
[2:00:06] little further here I'll close ain't
[2:00:08] going to be no two hours today like it
[2:00:09] was
[2:00:10] yesterday that was a special
[2:00:14] time Rejoice not in iniquity just skip
[2:00:17] it down you just follow through bearing
[2:00:19] all things believing all things charity
[2:00:20] never fails
[2:00:22] we know in part prophesy in part when
[2:00:24] that which is perfect is come and he
[2:00:27] said when I was a child I spake as a
[2:00:28] child and then it caps it off with these
[2:00:30] three faith hope and charity that's
[2:00:33] beautiful beautiful so a person wants
[2:00:35] they go from
[2:00:37] faith and they grow up into the stature
[2:00:40] of a perfect man and that perfect man is
[2:00:41] not me that perfect man is Christ amen
[2:00:45] amen the Apex of my walk with God is the
[2:00:49] Capstone of perfect life yes how do I
[2:00:52] know I have arrived to maturity if I can
[2:00:56] look back and see the action of love and
[2:00:58] see it live through me brother Jesse I
[2:01:00] know I have arrived as as as an adult I
[2:01:02] can say I thought as a child spake as a
[2:01:05] child understood as a child but now I'm
[2:01:09] mature don't think me strange but I look
[2:01:12] down at this and I realize that what I'm
[2:01:14] seeing in my life I'm seeing the
[2:01:16] manifestation of that love of God coming
[2:01:18] through my heart I'm seeing it more and
[2:01:21] more and more more why because at one
[2:01:23] time I used to think when I got in
[2:01:24] trouble that God didn't love me but now
[2:01:27] I realize when I get in trouble it's
[2:01:28] because he does love me that I'm in
[2:01:31] trouble beautiful like I said to you
[2:01:33] want see last time Psalm 23 The Lord is
[2:01:35] my shepherd everybody wants him to lay
[2:01:37] him down by still pastures and so forth
[2:01:39] like that but nobody wants a rod or
[2:01:41] correction but he can't be our Shepherd
[2:01:43] unless he's going to correct us at the
[2:01:45] same time as play is down Green Pastures
[2:01:48] are wonderful but his rod and staff is
[2:01:50] part of him being my
[2:01:53] beautiful Glory praise the
[2:01:56] Lord my that's right see all they're
[2:02:00] talking about natural love that's what
[2:02:01] Paul was talking about here give your
[2:02:03] body to be burned that's natural love
[2:02:05] people can love so much that they'll
[2:02:07] give their life for another person
[2:02:09] that's natural love but Agape goes even
[2:02:12] beyond
[2:02:13] that amen Oh
[2:02:16] my he said that's natural affection
[2:02:20] instead of the Divine
[2:02:22] revelation of the will of
[2:02:25] God how do I really know I've got his
[2:02:27] love in my heart I can obey what he
[2:02:29] tells
[2:02:30] me how do I know it's there because I
[2:02:32] can do what he said amen when I get to
[2:02:35] the spot to where I can obey him
[2:02:37] unquestionably that my love has arrived
[2:02:39] at a spot to where I'm where I need to
[2:02:42] be Hallelujah but God says do this I
[2:02:45] go I still got some work to do yes sir
[2:02:49] yes sir praise the Lord church amen
[2:02:51] wonderful praise the Lord wonderful if I
[2:02:53] get to the spot to where he said the
[2:02:55] word say do it this way and I
[2:02:58] say that's going to hurt somebody's
[2:03:00] feelings Lord do it that way if I've got
[2:03:02] God's love he said do it that way buckle
[2:03:05] up everybody here we
[2:03:07] go and I do it that way doesn't matter
[2:03:09] if it hurts or not it might matter to me
[2:03:12] humanly it might matter to me
[2:03:14] affectionately don't want to hurt people
[2:03:16] and don't want to say things that rub
[2:03:17] people the wrong way like a fell said to
[2:03:20] me a little bit ago he said brother B he
[2:03:22] said I want to tell you something right
[2:03:23] now I said yes sir he said you trying to
[2:03:25] get people to say man that offends
[2:03:26] people I said it offends me they
[2:03:29] won't I said two12 of the other brother
[2:03:32] I said we're supposed to be worshiping
[2:03:33] God in the house of God not sitting like
[2:03:34] a bunch of
[2:03:38] sticks and I know if you don't get your
[2:03:40] mouth open you can't
[2:03:45] eat praise the Lord but you understand
[2:03:49] the Divine love of God will make you do
[2:03:51] things that even offends people because
[2:03:53] you know it's for their benefit yes sir
[2:03:56] hey Jesus has done things to me that
[2:03:57] offended me yes yes Ah that's strange is
[2:04:01] it yes sir certain things the Lord's
[2:04:03] done to me has offended me when God
[2:04:07] asked me to move to Tennessee offended
[2:04:08] me and God wanted me to leave my
[2:04:11] home right right wo y'all getting quiet
[2:04:14] on me
[2:04:15] true as a human I was offended but God's
[2:04:18] love knew offense or not I'm leading you
[2:04:22] in the right
[2:04:25] direction yes yes and one preacher said
[2:04:29] here not long ago and I don't mean to
[2:04:31] bring up trash out of the out of the
[2:04:33] trash pile but just to give you a good
[2:04:34] example like one man said brother man
[2:04:36] call women dog me I could never do that
[2:04:38] I could never get away with I say
[2:04:40] because you don't love
[2:04:42] them if you knew I loved you I could
[2:04:45] punch you right Square in the nose and
[2:04:46] You' get up all right brother Ben thank
[2:04:48] you what was that for
[2:04:52] if people knew that I loved you now you
[2:04:54] know I mean not literally of course but
[2:04:56] if you take that word and scale it back
[2:04:58] I mean just scale
[2:05:00] them people know you love them you can
[2:05:02] tell them the truth they'll come back
[2:05:03] and hear what you got to say right why
[2:05:05] they don't because they know deep in
[2:05:06] their heart you really don't love you
[2:05:09] can't Bluff Humanity friends if a man
[2:05:11] don't mean what he says people pick up
[2:05:13] on it they know that's why I figured out
[2:05:16] a long time ago don't be nobody just be
[2:05:17] B they'll understand
[2:05:20] that I figure that you got a 50/50 you
[2:05:22] can light Me Or Hate Me One
[2:05:26] the right but the love of God will
[2:05:29] sometimes cause you to come to the pull
[2:05:30] pit and put brass knuckles on your
[2:05:32] fingers right brother right that's what
[2:05:34] brother B said sometimes skin them to
[2:05:37] the Bone that's what brother BR said wow
[2:05:41] wow the Bible tells us he who he loves
[2:05:43] he rebukes and he chases yes you
[2:05:46] understand when people don't don't get
[2:05:47] that part of God when they think that
[2:05:49] God's being mean to them it's because
[2:05:51] they think as a child understood as a
[2:05:53] child speak as a child but when they
[2:05:56] grow up they realize when preaching
[2:05:58] comes their way that really challenges
[2:05:59] them they think thank you Lord Jesus you
[2:06:01] love me enough to give me another step I
[2:06:03] can step up amen this is the essence of
[2:06:06] God's love his Essence his character is
[2:06:10] love praise the Lord yes sir let's stand
[2:06:13] again yes
[2:06:14] sir
[2:06:16] Hallelujah adoption part four paragraph
[2:06:19] 104 thus sayith the Lord it'll take
[2:06:22] perfect love to put you in that
[2:06:26] place that's right no matter how many
[2:06:29] religious
[2:06:30] demonstrations no matter how many Good
[2:06:32] Deeds you've done or whatever you done
[2:06:34] that won't count nothing on that day
[2:06:37] right
[2:06:39] right he'll take perfect love lay aside
[2:06:43] everything else amen until you're so
[2:06:46] filled with the love of God watch how
[2:06:48] this goes so you can love those that
[2:06:50] hate you
[2:06:53] it's amazing to me that these words
[2:06:55] would be sandwiched as it were together
[2:06:58] that he would say God is of love love
[2:07:00] one another little children as the
[2:07:02] father hath loved you for God is of love
[2:07:05] he turns right around and said God is
[2:07:08] love you understand I cannot say I love
[2:07:11] him if I don't like you if I don't have
[2:07:15] love for you I don't have a feeling in
[2:07:16] my heart for you as the people of God
[2:07:18] then how can I say I love him when the
[2:07:21] very God that loved me is the same God
[2:07:23] that loved you so how could I have
[2:07:24] something against you when he loved you
[2:07:26] and yet I say I love
[2:07:28] him right yes wonderful
[2:07:33] Wonder scratch my back I'll scratch
[2:07:36] yours Grace is Grace says your back's
[2:07:39] itch and I'll scratch it anyhow whether
[2:07:40] you scratch mine or
[2:07:41] not right right exactly right that's the
[2:07:46] real love of God Matthew 5 he said
[2:07:48] resist resist not evil
[2:07:52] yeah but can we do it can we can we
[2:07:56] become those kind of people I think we
[2:07:58] can with God's love in our heart we
[2:08:01] start developing a feeling and an
[2:08:03] understanding for
[2:08:04] others because when you reach a spot in
[2:08:06] the Lord where you realize where he
[2:08:07] brought you from then it's easy for you
[2:08:09] to look at somebody else and realize I
[2:08:11] was there a few years ago amen that's
[2:08:14] where I was at some time ago in my life
[2:08:16] if God had mercy on me he can have mercy
[2:08:19] on you gory GL amen Glory this is what's
[2:08:22] held the Revival back not for the nation
[2:08:25] i r read you this morning it's over sh
[2:08:27] Nationwide Revival is out but this is
[2:08:30] what holds up individual revivals and
[2:08:33] what I want more than anything else I
[2:08:35] want an individual Revival in my heart I
[2:08:38] want this word to so live inside of my
[2:08:40] heart inside of my life until it changes
[2:08:42] even the way that I think about certain
[2:08:45] circumstances if I can receive his love
[2:08:47] in my heart it will make that change if
[2:08:50] I can receive
[2:08:52] but if I can't oh my that it's just the
[2:08:54] same old chasing Robin Hood's barn and
[2:08:56] the whole deal but if I can receive this
[2:08:58] love into my heart I know if I can
[2:09:00] receive his love me who was unlovable
[2:09:02] that he loved me if I can get that right
[2:09:05] then it will make me turn and love the
[2:09:06] unlovable
[2:09:08] myself beautiful and that unlovable
[2:09:12] might be your
[2:09:13] spouse that might be a father or a
[2:09:16] mother or a cousin or a boss yes sir
[2:09:22] amen let's pray heavenly father thank
[2:09:25] you for your word this morning Lord
[2:09:27] Jesus God I know this has been just a
[2:09:29] simple little old thought but lord it's
[2:09:32] got some power in it if we'll receive it
[2:09:35] I believe Lord as we've listen to the
[2:09:38] things of God this morning I believe
[2:09:39] that you've been able to help the people
[2:09:42] to yes Jes see what this love of God's
[2:09:44] all about to see what your essence
[2:09:46] really is I pray my Lord that the Holy
[2:09:50] Ghost would just come down today and
[2:09:52] take this word and plant it deep into
[2:09:55] our hearts Lord Jesus that we can become
[2:09:58] the kind of people Lord that would be so
[2:10:00] pleasing I I don't want to be just a
[2:10:01] child Lord yes just walk around every
[2:10:04] time something goes along thinking
[2:10:05] you're against me or you hate me but
[2:10:07] Lord I want to have such a feeling in my
[2:10:09] heart to know you love me
[2:10:12] unconditionally yes Lord hallelujah
[2:10:15] thank you my Lord help us and bless us
[2:10:18] in this way we pray in the name of Jesus
[2:10:21] Jesus
[2:10:22] Christ
[2:10:25] amen would your have heads bowed just a
[2:10:28] moment I just wonder if you'd just like
[2:10:31] to be
[2:10:33] recognized before the Lord this morning
[2:10:36] say brother
[2:10:38] Ben I it is hard for me to receive these
[2:10:41] kind of things and I want his
[2:10:44] help as I want this thing to go out of
[2:10:47] my heart I want to be different from
[2:10:48] today
[2:10:49] on Hallelujah
[2:10:52] God bless each hand going
[2:10:54] out I want to be different today Lord I
[2:10:58] want to be able to receive this great
[2:11:00] love into my spirit my
[2:11:02] heart
[2:11:05] hallelujah
[2:11:07] amen I've played games with it too long
[2:11:11] I've been brought to a showdown today
[2:11:12] and I want to be different yes Jes
[2:11:16] Hallelujah my hands going up everywhere
[2:11:19] let's just pray together again
[2:11:22] Lord
[2:11:24] Jesus heavenly
[2:11:26] father I know beyond the shadow of a
[2:11:28] doubt that Satan would just love to
[2:11:30] steal this out of their
[2:11:32] hearts as Lord God the devil our
[2:11:35] adversary stands before us telling us
[2:11:38] all have you felt this way many times
[2:11:40] before what good did it do you but Lord
[2:11:43] Jesus if you'll help us to let go of
[2:11:46] human ability and the thought that we
[2:11:48] can do anything about it won't you come
[2:11:51] down lord Jesus and just do a work in US
[2:11:54] Lord that will change this part of
[2:11:56] oursel forever that Lord these things
[2:11:59] the way we look at it you'll help us to
[2:12:02] look in a different view of it not to
[2:12:05] see you as a dictator or judge but to
[2:12:08] see you as someone who loves us who
[2:12:11] cares for
[2:12:13] us Lord is that a man tell me in Arizona
[2:12:15] just the other day preaching on this
[2:12:18] very thought brother Ben you'd be
[2:12:20] surprised
[2:12:22] but here I am an old man and all these
[2:12:24] years I never thought that God really
[2:12:26] loved me Lord I thought here's a man sat
[2:12:29] around around the ranks for all these
[2:12:32] years
[2:12:34] Lord how Satan moves inside of people in
[2:12:38] their minds or Spirits puts thoughts
[2:12:41] plants thoughts inside of
[2:12:43] them and a little subtle thing that
[2:12:46] people don't recognize but yet it lays
[2:12:48] there in the human conscience
[2:12:51] but deep down they really don't believe
[2:12:54] that Jesus loves them in that
[2:12:56] way oh they know that you loved them
[2:12:59] enough to save them but somehow deep in
[2:13:01] their hearts they feel they're fitted
[2:13:03] for Destruction God help us help us Lamb
[2:13:08] of God let it be that a change will
[2:13:11] occur Lord that you will not only clean
[2:13:14] out our
[2:13:15] consciences but clean out our
[2:13:18] subconscious All the Little Seeds of the
[2:13:20] devil lord May May there be May there be
[2:13:23] ground turned
[2:13:24] over
[2:13:26] Hallelujah may you come with a great
[2:13:28] tiller of your word in your spirit may
[2:13:31] you te up the ground and take out them
[2:13:32] old seeds of
[2:13:35] discrepancy Lord Jesus may we be planted
[2:13:38] a new with the word that's been preached
[2:13:40] today you love us you love us
[2:13:44] Lord as I said if you came down to each
[2:13:47] of our seats asking us to worship you to
[2:13:50] love you which one of us would smack you
[2:13:52] in the face of course we'd say
[2:13:54] no but if our attitude is such that we
[2:13:58] just really don't believe you love us we
[2:14:01] don't enter into the word we don't enter
[2:14:02] into worship we don't enter into praise
[2:14:04] we don't enter into singing All These
[2:14:07] Little Things They prove that somewhere
[2:14:09] deep inside of us we're just not
[2:14:12] convinced yet let it change us this
[2:14:15] morning the word I mean let it change us
[2:14:18] permanently I pray in the name name of
[2:14:21] the Lord Jesus for each of your
[2:14:23] believing children do a lifechanging
[2:14:27] work here this morning
[2:14:29] Lord and Lord though they may not feel
[2:14:31] maybe a certain thing happen maybe the
[2:14:34] evidence would present itself in the way
[2:14:38] that they would feel or see
[2:14:39] later maybe as they come back to church
[2:14:42] tonight they
[2:14:43] notice might be subtle but maybe they
[2:14:45] would notice they feel different in
[2:14:47] their worship yes Lord they feel
[2:14:48] different the way they praise
[2:14:51] when they said amen that time it just
[2:14:53] felt better somehow than it did before
[2:14:55] God let him recognize this because
[2:14:56] you've done a work here this morning
[2:14:59] that things are different maybe that
[2:15:00] person that would cut them off on the
[2:15:01] road this afternoon or on the way home
[2:15:03] or something that feeling that used to
[2:15:06] raise up in their heart they have a
[2:15:07] different thought that comes behind it
[2:15:09] now a little bit more merciful a little
[2:15:11] bit more
[2:15:12] gracious Lord let them know that's
[2:15:15] because the work has been accomplished
[2:15:17] today lord it's been kind of a little
[2:15:19] bit of a more of a
[2:15:21] my it's been a difficult service in one
[2:15:24] way not because of the people but the
[2:15:27] material what's being preached it's hard
[2:15:31] for us to receive this Lord help us do
[2:15:34] so today Lord in Jesus name I
[2:15:38] pray
[2:15:40] amen everyone now let's just raise our
[2:15:42] hands to him let's just thank him just
[2:15:46] love him in our own way let's just thank
[2:15:47] him now for doing a work inside our
