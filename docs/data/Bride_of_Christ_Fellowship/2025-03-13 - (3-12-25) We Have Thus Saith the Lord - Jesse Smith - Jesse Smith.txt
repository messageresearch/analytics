TRANSCRIPT
========================================
God's grace James 5 verse 10 and then amamos 37 and 8 I think I know why I say that honey because I Corvin Amos I think I I always said his name Amos yeah that's why I say that there just a little side note there Allelujah so I want to just preach on this uh we have thus sayith the Lord by God's grace now every Christian has it because they have the entire Bible but we've been visited by a prophet in this day uh brother William brandham and he gave us many thus sayith the Lords so I want to go over some of those here tonight by God's grace and I like to at some point get them all all in one spot together and uh I just need to work on that I got a document and it's got 33 Pages it's got 41 pages of all these thus sayi the Lords and I'm slowly trying to put them onto one uh Pres presentation where we can all put them there together by God's grace so um uh James 5:10 by the grace of the Lord now notice what does a prophet do they speak in the name of the Lord all right so let's read that on three ready one two three take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord for an example of suffering Affliction and of patience praise God now if you go to Amos 37 and eight we'll read that by God's grace Daniel Hosea Joel and Amos now of course I never really heard this scripture preach until I came into the ministry of the message of uh those preachers that were preaching the Revelations from the Bible God gave to William brandom so this verse just really did a lot for us uh it's so important uh as we see it all down through the Bible you know you can take every one of these prophets from the Old Testament and almost every book starts off with the vision came to this Prophet or the word of the Lord came to that prophet and each time God gave a prophet a revelation and so that's what we have today God gave brother brandham the secrets of the Seven Seals praise God and I would even uh make a case where uh gave him the secrets of the seven Church ages and the Seven Stars I would make that um that argument as well or that case because I don't like to call it argueing I don't like to argue uh but I make that case with humility by God's grace so Amos 3 7 and 8 let's read seven together there by God's grace and then I guess we can read eight ready one two 3 surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets the lion hath roared who will not fear the lord God hasth spoken who can but prophesy let's have one more word of prayer if you have any on your heart let's make it own to god father my hands up Lord God I'm so thankful to be here tonight Lord In The Presence of Jehovah Lord God thank you Lord I ask that the Holy Spirit Lord would take control Lord God and just Minister through the word Lord this is your ordained way through the five full ministry Lord God to preach Lord one man preaching to men and women to try to get them to believe the word of God and Lord I need to believe too each one of us need Faith Lord raise our faith tonight Lord God we thank you for visiting us Lord in this hour this generation these last few generations with the prophet William brandham Lord God and now father we look to the word of God lord and we ask that the spirit of Jesus that's here today as your Prophet taught us Jesus is the prophet of this hour Lord God hallelujah and Lord just take the words now on the pages of the Bible make them real to us and I pray Lord God our faith will be raised today in Jesus Christ's name name and the Saints said amen amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God I will set a timer here again just to kind of watch the clock here uh by God's grace okay I want to uh put up some quotes here now I preached this a number of years ago and I added some things in here so hope this will be okay uh by God's grace so I just want to preach on we have thus sayith the Lord and again uh as I've said before you know I went through um over 1,000 I think it was 600 quotes from brother bradam that all all use either thus sayith the Lord or in the name of the Lord now the thing you'll find right away is a lot of times he was just saying thus sayth the Lord from the Bible he wasn't actually prophesying so it actually you know took that number of 1 1600 or what 1300 whatever it was and it narrowed it down and that's what I put on my 40 some page document there I think it was 41 but it doesn't really matter but anyways um you know and I boiled it down remember a few weeks ago I showed how there's at least six thus sayith the Lord's future that brother Adam told right and then there could be those 10 that the brother sent me with the Divine Healing where he would tell people thus sayith the Lord you're going to get well so there could be up to 16 now remember now that's a small number compared to remember we looked at Jeremiah Jeremiah and Isaiah had over 100 they had over hundred thus sayith the Lord just in their books so we believe brother Ram was a a major prophet but as far as his number of prophecies we would say it's smaller than what's written in just the book of Isaiah or Jeremiah or Ezekiel because they had hundreds of prophecies like we said they prophesy to Edom and Egypt and uh Assyria and Babylon then back to Israel so many thus sayith the Lord so many prophecies in the name of the Lord but of course uh God promised this ministry we looked at it a few weeks ago it would turn it was the spirit of Elijah that would turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers praise God and so brother baham tells us that he even gives us thus sayith the Lord on that so it's either a lie or it's Truth Now how do we know it's true because everything brother Brandon taught us was in the word of God hallelujah all right so he's poting us back to the scriptures Hallelujah so I want to look at this here tonight and uh now brother man tells us in the church age book he said God will never give us a different Revelation from what he's given in here now everything brother R says is outside of here just like almost any Prophet right uh that was after that was after the the cannon was finished right the New Testament Cannon was finished any Prophet after that or any prophecy after that will be outside of this but what's true it will still line up with with what's in here right and so when a when it's a gift of Prophecy it's it's a modern prophecy or something uh that's that's from a living Prophet or a recent Prophet that's not in the scripture he lived after the Canon was finished uh then it it it's it's it's it's not like we're adding to the word of God we're never adding to the word of God but whatever the prophecy is it will have to agree with this right and then no prophecy will take anything it'll never take one word away from it and never add one word to it and the words brother Ram uses he said he'll give us more information on the same Revelation Hallelujah that's that's how brother teaches it uh it doesn't give us a different Revelation the same Revelation it just gives us more information on it Hallelujah so as we look tonight here um that's kind of what we'll see with these different prophecies from brother brandom and the times when we got it will go to the scripture because some of these are just more information on the same scripture but it doesn't take away from the word doesn't add to the word of God if that was the case it would be against the word of God and then we know brother Brandon wasn't a true Prophet but we know he is by God's grace because he pointed us to the word of God hallelujah thank God for that now I like what brother R says here uh because he says uh in order for God to deal with his church and I mean to deal with it to make it his bride we have to leave denominations okay that's what we have to do brother tells us thus sayith the Lord now where is that in the scripture it's right there in the in the uh gospels right the you had to leave the Pharisees the Sadducees you had to leave any man-made denomination in order to follow the present truth right Hallelujah yes that's right even uh uh even uh you know we saw it with Ephesians in Acts 18 they had truth but they didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and so uh quill and Priscilla had to bring them higher to a greater Revelation now mainly it was the man right Aquilla but Priscilla must had some testimonies in there because there's no such thing as a woman preacher in the Bible she must had some testimonies in there a word of wisdom or a word of knowledge or something like that uh by God's grace okay but we see it all through the scripture anytime a group organizes now what every denomination does as the Bible tells us uh they make their own tradition right they make their own tradition and then if if the group fails to move on from that tradition into the full word of God then their worship becomes none effect right it becomes vain that's why God's had all these movements right from Luther to Wesley and brother tells us the Wesley movement was a rebuke to the Lutheran because the Lutheran wouldn't come out into more truth and then brother R said uh the Pentecostal move of zusa street was rebuked to the uh wesan right because they they wouldn't accept more truth and now brother R says his ministry uh point us to the Bible that's a rebuke to Pentecostals because they won't come out of wearing makeup wearing high heels sexy clothes all these things like that all their all their world it's a rebuke to them because they won't come out of that but we got to come out of it by God's grace and thank God we have hallelujah amen I I was raised as I said I was raised in assembly of God's sweetest people though I'm Ser so thankful but when you see a greater light you got to respond to the light amen every living plant when there's a light it grows to the light Hallelujah right a living a living being will will will gravitate and move and you know you've seen the plants and the vines they twist all over they'll do anything just to get there some light Hallelujah that's right glory to God so brother man tells this in 1961 he said he said the same things happened to the the church uh they PA went Methodist Baptist Presbyterian we got a degree out of Hartford or weaton we got a Bob Jones degree or a bachelor of art we got a DD LED what is it amount to a bunch of nonsense he said it's the way it was in Egypt and God never did deal with Israel till she came to her Homeland hear me thus sayeth the Lord he's talking about Israel coming out of Egypt and he's likening the denominations unto Egypt because they have worldliness in them because because they haven't moved on to the greater light thus say the Lord God will not deal with his church till she comes back to the Homeland right the message of the Hour come back to the original which is the original Church the book of Acts Church Hallelujah right it has no women preachers right uh has no crossdressers Glory Hallelujah he said get away from you this is a 1961 get away from the Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostal assemblies Oneness threeness he says Fess whatever is see anytime a man or a church puts a period and says this is all God's going to reveal they've just limited the Holy Spirit right there right and that's what he's talking about and remember brother says brother says in other quotes I'm not against the people they're good people it's the system of denomination I'm against because once they rally around these ideas and they fail to move on they fail to receive more of God's revelation okay he said it's all Antichrist movements because right look at the lutherans today look look at uh honey what was what ecl ecla you were raising okay she was raising the ecla now when she was growing up they had some things okay but now some of them now they're going so far right and you know homosexuality uh transgender all this I mean look look look what's happened and and brother Ram said this and people could take this so offensive but look it's an antichrist movement now they might have nice people in there and I'm sure everybody in there doesn't agree with what the denomination does but that's why Revelation 18 says come out of her my people hallelujah that you be not partakers of her sins and her plagues Hallelujah right it's the plague of homosexuality the the plague of transgenderism or the the plague of of crossdressing women preachers it's the plague it's a stain upon the church and so God says come out of her the mother heart at Rome and then all of her daughters come out of her my people that you be clean under the cleaning the washing of the water of the word hallelujah amen glory to God Amen now let's read that because you got it uh let's start go back to Matthew 15 let's read it just so you got it Matthew 15 talks about the denomination this if this isn't denomination that I don't know what one I don't know what one is because they they grow or I'm sorry they write down their their bylaws or their We Believe web page and they won't move from there in fact it just gets more corrupt as the years goes on now now CH could there be some faithful lutherans out there yes I'm sure there are I'm sure I mean faithful to what Luther taught you know there no doubt Wesley and Pentecostal no doubt about that and even message people right some message people they get off the beaten paath too right they make themselves a denomination around brother Ram's teachings they'll take a false Doctrine they'll make their own false Doctrine they'll make their own denomination well they got to come out of that now nobody is a a a subject I'm sorry no nobody's uh uh what's the word there exempt yeah no one's exempt from the enemy trying to bring in false Doctrine we all got to fight it off we all got to get the leaven out of us and the church said if if the Corinthian Church had to get the leaven out and Jesus said there's leaven of the Pharisees leav of the Sadducees leav of Herod there's all there's all these leavens and these sin addictions then we got to get ours out too praise God that's why we got to use church discipline and get sin out of the church hallelujah or else that's going to corrupt the church and you know what it does it creates such an atmosphere such a dismal atmosphere right it's a distraction to the Holy Spirit our attention needs to be on the Holy Spirit not on evil spirits Hallelujah that's right amen glory Matthew 15 verse uh now look in verse two it's why do thy disciples transgress are I'm just going to add this because you understand it a denominational tradition of the elders that's what it means see because they had Traditions you got to wash your hands and all these things it was a denominational tradition just like the traditions of spring sprinkling babies that's a denominational tradition you don't find that in the Bible Church the tradition of ordaining women like Rick Warren last what was a year a couple couple years ago he said he said oh now it's okay to ordain women preachers that's a lie from hell and all due respect to him you know as far as just being respectful no no anger no hatred but when you start transgressing against the word of God now you've got your own tradition and now the holy spirit's grieved and the worship is in vain is that right Church that's what Jesus said and so he says for they wash not their hands when they and that's not even in the Torah Moses never even wrote that they developed their own Creed but he answered and said to them why do you also transgress the attrition of God I love how Jesus turns it right back on him that's what we find all these people that accuse us we can just turn it right back on them why do you do this right Hallelujah for God commanded saying honor thy father and mother and he that curses father and mother let him die the death now skip down to verse uh six and honor not his father nor his mother he shall be free so they were given them excuses don't take care of your parents give that money instead to the the Pharisees and the sad Pharisees and he said you have made the Commandment of God of none effect by your tradition see Traditions or Creeds of man that are not found in the Bible they hinder the Holy Spirit and they make them verse seven they make them Hypocrites well did Isaiah prophesy in you saying this people draw unto me with their mouth and honor to me with their lips but their heart is far from me now here it is verse nine here's where it is a denomination if they're not careful it becomes vain worship now Church remember three years ago William and I walked into 12 different churches and church God's my witness in most churches people are just sitting there dead they're not even really worshiping God they're just there go through the song Everybody stand everybody kneel everybody stand where's where's the real contact with God where's somebody who really loves God hallelujah they're dead they're living brother said they're living off he said they're Liv living off the heat of a painted fire I love that it's like they talk about the Holy Ghost but he's not there Hallelujah they talk about the spirit they talk about miracles I'll say like this for our church they talk about the spirit of burning but where is the spirit of burning Hallelujah where's the spirit to burn out the sin in our lives hallelujah amen see so we must apply that to ourselves as well I can't I can't let the spirit or I I can't let this church become a denomination the first that Satan would want to do it would be me because I'm the pastor but I've got to overcome that evil spirit and I got to keep the fire of God in my life you got to keep the fire of God in your life we've got to keep the revival going praise God else we become a denomination to ourselves that's right but verse n but in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men now our family just started the video that I made last year we have over 110 doctrines that brother brandom corrected the church on so that means almost every other church has hundreds I'll say this hundreds of uh scoops of leav I don't know what else to say it it's a leav of a woman Pastor right it's 11 of of homosexuality L of adultery L of all these things they have hundreds of scoops of leav but brother Ram cleaned out the house Hallelujah brother raham labored to get the church to clean be cleaned out because that's that's what he's saying here God won't deal with us until we get all the sin out of our lives and come back to the word of God hallelujah where there's no denomination right where where there's no Creed but Christ no book but the Bible no law but love hallelujah amen now the one I read uh previously was uh uh Revelation 18:4 most of you familiar with it and then we'll see how the she she's a she's a a mother of children if she's a mother she's got to have children why would the Bible waste its breath uh and say something wrong if if she's a mother and she don't have children and church you see all these people going back to the Catholic Church brother rod do you see it all these famous people going back they say going back to Mama that's what they say they're going back to the mother church I mean you can't see it you need some isav Hallelujah you need some Holy Ghost isav amen that's right Revelation 184 now actually you know what let's go down to verse two and church if this ain't the truth then uh we're blind but we're not blind we're we see it and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the great is Fallen is Fallen has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird in other words every evil spirit dwells in the Roman Catholic church and I'm sure certainly not going to get popular for saying that right but look at it look at the child abuse look at the clergy abuse look at the money and the and the uh the wealth and all these things look at all this a false Doctrine intercession to dead people praying their intercession to evil spirits that church holds every demon in it and she's got daughters well look at verse four and I've heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not her plagues see so that that's why the Holy Spirit was in brother Braham saying this you've got to come out of these things he could have threw in Catholic in here he could have he could have threw in any Lutheran he could have threw any denomination because just give it a few years and if they don't stay with the Holy Spirit they're going to denominate develop their traditions and then God leaves them right they're not moving on the Holy Spirit God leaves them and I shared this last time I told my mom that that Vision brother brandom had and uh brother R said there'll be he said I saw the church dancing to rock and roll and I asked my mom she was raised in Assembly of God I you might remember this story and I said uh cuz I told a couple times I said Mom I said when you were born in 1950 in early in the church what are your earliest memories did they have rock and roll she's like oh no they just had the the grand piano or the spinet piano whatever they had I said Mom did you ever think there'd be rock and roll in your Assembly of God Church and she said no I never thought that but then around 2000 or 2005 she started going to the youth conventions and to to get the kids hyped up and jumping they brought in rock and roll and then she said then they brought wrap in then they brought that crazy heavy metal in and and she said now they got everything and she said I really don't even like that part of the the meeting but she still goes because she's loyal to her denomination but I was telling Mom Mom you don't want to be loyal to denomination you want to be loyal to the word and I said in your life you have seen brother Ram's Vision fulfilled what a privilege now I was raised family of God too so I've seen some of that too I I guess I could say I've seen that very end of it because when I first came in oh it was it was nothing but piano and then now uh well at the church I went to they still got piano but at other churches like that it's like a rock and roll concert right they turn on the lights why you turnning on the lights like what what what's what's going on uh strange things happen in dark you know what I mean like we want all the lights on we want everybody to see what's going on we don't want any foolishness or anything like that we're not we're not the copy of the world we're supposed to come out of the world Hallelujah all right Revelation Chapter 2 where she's got daughters verse now in verse 20 it talks about that woman Jezebel who is Jezebel except the Roman Catholic Church right that's that's the woman Jezebel calls herself a prophetess right they call the pope they call the Pope's a prophet every word I'm sorry not every word but when he sits at the uh St Peter's Basilica it's he's infallible at that seat that's what the catechism says he's infallible when he sits at that seat St Peter's Basilica so they make him a prophet there now look at verse uh 22 and I will cast her into a bed and then that commit adultery with her into Great Tribulation except they repent of their deeds and I will kill her what children well who's the children of the Roman Catholic Church it's the denominations that came out but then went right back to her ways right Hallelujah see she got children with death and all the churches should know that I am he which searches the Reigns in the hearts and I will give unto every one of you according to your Works Hallelujah so see you can prove it by the Bible there's a mother church and then there's daughter churches and so this doesn't add anything to the Bible it vindicates the Bible Hallelujah it backs up the Bible it's it's just a modern understanding of what's already written in the scripture Hallelujah and then God will start dealing with the church Hallelujah that's right now the next one now brother gave us lots of thus sayith the Lord on Doctrine and this is kind of what I was talking about uh previously with over 110 I I I I made a list of 110 doctrines brother random corrected and brother man said there's hundreds of them but I just haven't devoted time maybe this summer that's always my that's always my my idea maybe this summer I have all this time and then summer gets here and I feel like I'm busier than during the school year but here's brother Ram gave us thus sayith the Lord on all these doctrines and they're all found in scripture the church ages now that's what that's what Amos Amos 37 and8 I just got it's gonna take me time not Amos brother random revealed the secrets of who the Seven Stars are they're not not Heavenly Angels they're Earthly preachers right because why would Jesus say um John write a letter to Ephesus and tell that angel to do this and this and that why why would a man write to a Heavenly angel that makes no sense where can you find that any other time when does a Heavenly Angel need a message from a man written on parchment he doesn't he's actually he sent to the man not the man sent to the Angel and the church said their ministering Spirit sent to those who be Heirs of Salvation they're sent to us hallelujah they bring us messages the Angels comforted Jesus right after his temptation the angels are for us we're not for the Angels that's good that's fresh right there but God's grace so brother man gave us thus say the Lord on that he he gave us God did nothing except he revealed secrets to his servants the prophets brother R got the revelation of the church ages from Jesus Christ he got the revelation of the Seven Seals from Jesus Christ the revelation of all these things marriage and divorce modest clothing hair length baptism of Holy Ghost and I like this one classical preaching or I just say it today modern Joel oin preaching nothing against that Gody but he he he says it it's like a business it's all a business to him and he says that he won't preach on Abominations that means the people that means what is it unclean spirits are dwelling in that church if you don't clean it out if you don't preach against it it's going to live there just like revelation 18 said Hallelujah no nothing against a man I'm sure he's a nice man he looks nice you know he he looks he looks clean looks nice but by his Doctrine by their fruits they're known remember he said in that interview he'd go to a homosexuals wedding if they were friends and agree that God will bless an Abomination God will never bless an Abomination how do you know because he's the same yesterday today and forever Malachi 3:6 says I am the Lord and I change not Malachi glory amen God changes not Hallelujah it cannot change this ought to be an easier sermon to say Amen because I'm not preaching on you guys really ton much tonight okay I ought to get some more amens out of there that's that's okay if you don't amen I'm the pastor so at the end of the seventh seal brother man said now the vision that was the vision of going out west to the Snow White pyramid Cloud right we got a picture of it out there it was prophesied two months in advance with thus sayith the Lord he's going to meet a a a pyramid a constellation of Angels the Vision Plus the word plus the history brother man brought out from history on the church age and the Seven Seals plus the church ages and all Blends together it Blends beautifully together and so I could truly say that to the best of my understanding and according to the word of God and the vision the Revelation the interpretation thereof is thus saith the Lord now show me where Benny Hinn said that or Billy Graham or or Roberts or Joel ostein show me where any of these guys said that they didn't what why not cuz they're not prophets and all these other guys that say it they don't give any real I'm talking about the modern NR n guys uh New Apostolic re Reformation but they're not even prophets they're just pretend prophets because they miss all the time most of them miss when they said Trump's going to get two consecutive terms the Lord show me that the Lord showed you nothing the Bible that's right the Bible said you made that up in the imagination of your own heart your own dirty heart it wasn't the Lord that said that God doesn't lie Hallelujah said qualifies all of them right away show show me where anybody ever said something like this that had real Bible Vindication nobody did it that proves brother random is this Elijah for the end time Hallelujah now here look at this here church now this is not really a thus say th statement but look he's saying he he's talking about all these verses that God sent him to fulfill he said the Bible said Malachi 4 what would happen today the hearts of the children back to the fathers we looked at that a couple weeks ago Revelation 10 how the seals would be open and reveal all the Mysteries that's been hid through these reformers church we know what all the Seven Seals are we know what the four beasts are we know who the four horse riders are in the church said right we we know the fifth seals the Jews we know the six seals of tribulation we know the seven seal is the the the Rapture it's the moment unknown day and hour of the Rapture and it starts the beginning of the end Hallelujah brother an taught us that he said how it be done it's in the Bible thus sayith the Lord God has completely perfectly Vindicated that what he's perfectly Vindicated Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 hallelujah it's been perfectly Vindicated Hallelujah if you've got eyes to see and ears to hear it's been perfectly Vindicated by the cloud and of course by also by the harmony of everything he taught it harmonizes with every other Bible verse that's right he Vindicated to be the truth by signs wonders in the heavens in the skies everything else for 33 years so he's talking about when he first got his seven major Visions in 1933 we went over it last time remember uh the seven major Visions I think I got it right up here remember that so said this was like his first major prophecy hallelujah oh yeah and I just heard well I heard Elon mus say it today that those cars come out next year without steering wheels that's what he said now of course they're always off a couple years right we've been hearing that since 2020 it's always one more year one more year one more year and so we see this you know we see yeah we see this the moral problem with women and the the Roman Catholic Church did you know most of and correct me if I'm wrong with Austin most of Trump's appointees are Roman Catholic his cabinet people how many knew that most of them are staunch Roman Catholics yeah it's true somebody sent me a video that I was like oh my Lord have mercy yes that's right he converted converted now brother is talking about when he prophesied that cloud we got a picture of there from February 28th 1963 and he said thus sayith the Lord he said he was going to meet seven angels that would commission him to go back east and preach the Seven Seals for Christ he said I saw the seven angels come didn't like magazine packet I got the Life magazine in my office that has it the fog it floated across here 27 miles high 30 mil across he talks about the brothers that were there stood right there when them seven angels appeared right here on the hill it shook the hills for miles around there stood seven angels and throw a sword in his hand saying go home and open the Seven Seals that are given and here they are the true mystery of marriage and divorce and the serpent seed and all these things that's been fussed about it's thus sayith the Lord what a blessing Church we don't have uh maybe this is an man's idea this is the best commentary we got on it no friends we've got thus sayith the Lord hallelujah in other words something in something in the Seven Seals will will will agree with everything that's in the Book of Ezekiel or Jeremiah or the Book of Job Hallelujah it will all agree together nothing will break any continuity with God's word that's right now let me show you that marriage and divorcement it's been I think we went over a couple weeks ago go but just to refresh uh the Revelation on marriage and divorce brother R said is that there's only one cause a man can divorce a woman and then remarry and it's not even adultery it's not it's unconfessed fornication uh that the woman gave a false vow before they were married and then if he finds out and he doesn't love her he could put her away and remarry another that's the only cause so let's go to Matthew 19 then we'll go to Matthew 5 then m Matthew 1 we just go down right like that that's the only cause and every other church church I've listened to and I've been to numerous churches I've listen a lot of preaching on marriage and divorce every other church has it wrong brother Ram's the only one who points back and agrees with every scripture Matthew 19 and so and church wouldn't that make sense that means all the other denominations are allowing their people to be adulterers and church will adulterers inherit the kingdom of God no and so again it shows how their daughters of the mother they're produc they're not producing Sanctified they're not producing Sanctified fire baptized Holy Ghost Saints they're not producing it praise God because they let them live in sin Glory just got a little fiery Zeal here tonight by God's grace I got smile too by God's gra Matthew 19 there's only one cause verse 9 199 and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication now how many know the Bible has to interpret the Bible so just just can't mean uh well someone committed foreign eation it can't mean that it's got there's got to be another Bible example now we'll get to it's in it's Mary and Joseph remember from Matthew chapter 1 and shall marry another committeth adultery and whosoever Marth her which is put away doth commit adultery now we don't have time but we could go to Romans 7 we go to First Corinthians and it shows uh you the man and wife are bound to each other until death in the New Testament and Jesus said there's only one cause for divorce and remarriage fornication but what kind of fornication that's what we see in uh Matthew Chapter 5 and Matthew chapter 1 all right so go to Matthew 5 so if he if brother man was right on the Seven Seals and he's right on the seven Church ages and he's right on denominations well I think he's going to be right again on marriage and divorce don't you think that church Hallelujah when have you seen a prophet hit a couple things right in the name of the Lord and miss the other things in the name of the Lord they don't do it the only time it was confusing like we showed a few weeks ago was with Isaiah when God gave Hezekiah the permissive will of God or the other one was balum God said okay don't go they says okay go ahead and go because it's God giving someone their selfish permissive will right instead of the perfect will of God but that that doesn't mean God changed God did never God never changed his mind God knows the beginning from the end praise praise God he knew what they were going to ask for it was a test all right Matthew 5 I think it's 32 I could be wrong but let me get there I got to turn one more page got 31 and it hath been said whosoever shall put away his wife let him give him her her a writing of divorcement verse 32 but I say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication causes her to commit adultery and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery now church we have no other divorce stories in the ENT entire New Testament that I'm aware of except Matthew chapter 1 it was a potential divorce but the Holy Ghost stopped it Hallelujah see how God hates divorce see how God God hates divorce let's go to Matthew 1 so see the Bible must interpret the Bible Jesus if he defined what marriage and divorce is then we have to find all the other Bible verses agreeing with it that's what Isaiah 28 said who can he teach Doctrine it's got to be line upon line precept upon precept word upon word amen scripture upon scripture verse upon verse Hallelujah see so Matthew chapter 1 this is why brother could stand there and say that's thus sayith the Lord after preaching marriage and divorce if you haven't listened to that listen to that what a message my goodness Matthew 1 now verse 18 now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband being a just man not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privately so here he's going to divorce her why because they took a vow she said she was a virgin but then he finds out oh she's got child this is the case this is the only case where a man can divorce a woman he was going to put her away privately and then he was going to take another wife but see he Jo Joseph didn't understand what the Holy Ghost was doing so what do the Holy Ghost do he comes around and Crush Joseph but while he thought on these things behold the angel of Lord appeared on him in dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee marry thy wife so that proves again once you say I do and you get engaged you're married in the sight of God we don't let our children grow up and change their engagements that's sin so once our children get engaged you're engaged for life and if you leave that one to marry another you're living in adultery now Americans don't know about that that's because they don't read their Bible the Bible hasn't changed America changed that's right for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost okay now look at verse 24 then Joseph being raised from his sleep did as the angel Lord had been him and he took unto him his wife and he knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name Jesus now you know the Roman Catholic Church says Mary was an Ever virgin she and Joseph never came together that's that that verse will condemn all those Liars on the day of judgment because it said he knew her not till she had brought forth Jesus and the church said and there's Peter with the mother-in-law and you they'll say Peter was a pope he was no Pope he was no papa he was an apostle he was one sent by the Holy Ghost so see the Bible has to interpret the Bible so the only way that a man could divorce a wife and marry another is if after they get married they find out she lied and she committed fornication now if she had fornication before marriage all she has to do is confess confess it before they get engaged and he if he still wants to marry her praise the Lord God you know the man probably had fornication himself right the way the the day people are these days I mean so it's it's just sin you just got to confess everything you just want a per you just want an honest vow like the Book of Numbers I think it's numbers 18 we're not going to read it but numbers 18 says The Vow must be a pure vow must stand and so Jesus said there's only one reason there's only one case for marriage and divorce brother Brandon brought back to that no wonder he could say that's thus sayith the Lord and church every other church I know allows adulterers and then they'll allow those aduls to preach they'll allow the adulter aduls to be uh uh deacons or treasurers and all this what do you got a bunch of a bunch of adulterers running around what's supposed to be a pure church and the Bible said let a bishop be the husband of one wife not two not three like Paula White and she's even a woman all right yeah we're talking about Paul White God have mercy oh my now again he's telling this these are all similar quotes about how he's got thus sayith the Lord and He throw a sword in hand and said go home and open these Seven Seals that are given and here they are the true mystery of marriage and divorce and the serpent seed and all these things that's been fussed about it's thus sayith the Lord and church Mar serpent seed is thus sayith the Lord can you this struck me uh Cam and I were doing the podcast I put it out yesterday can you imagine most theologians think today that uh the Nephilim or the Giants came from Angels who could Fallen Angels demons who could create their own human bodies and then marry women and and and procreate with married with human women and then have half angel or half demon and human people that's what they believe and they'll look at us and say you're a heretic you believe uh Eve had adultery with a serpent and I'm like like you think I'm crazy you're the crazy one you think demons have power to create bodies they don't they don't have power to do that only God can do that Hallelujah and some of them are going as far as saying well see the sons of God saw the daughters of men and so these Fallen uh demons even had like wedding ceremonies with these women and created this half angel half uh hybrid race now the the truth is there is a hybrid but it's because the the the serpent was a beast of the field the Bible said he was so much like a man and whatever fruit they ate it produced two offsprings so it ain't an apple it ain't an apricot either praise God it's not a banana it's not an orange amen it's the fruit of adultery and brother R gave us thus sayith the Lord on serpent seed because it's it's God started serpent seed in Genesis 3:15 God's the one that said that it's thus sayith the Lord right whatever fruit they ate of in genes early in Genesis 3 Verse 6 whatever fruit they ate of it caused them to be naked and brother B said if they ate apples someone needs to pass out the apples today so then these women will know they're naked right with their yoga pants and their bra straps or whatever we're talking about hanging out someone needs to pass out the apples today or realize oh maybe it wasn't apples maybe it was adultery that made them realize they were naked verse 15 who started the serpent who said there's two seeds was it was it a man was it brother brandom it was God and I will put hatred enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed a woman doesn't have seed and her seed so God's going to give the woman seed through Adam and that's eventually going to become who Christ right through the woman's seed right or the woman's line there of course through Adam and Eve and it shall bruise thy head that's speaking of the calvary and thou shalt bruise his heel right so Jesus at Calvary he bruised the Serpent's head right he bruised Satan's power and we got the we got the Forgiveness of the blood of Jesus Christ we got the power of the Holy Ghost Satan's power against us is limited and the church said am the Bible said Jesus died to destroy the works of the devil in our lives hallelujah amen in Hebrews right but who said there's two seeds God said there's two seeds and whatever fruit they ate of it went and caus them to cover their private their loins when does eating an apple make you want to cover your loins it doesn't and why are all the punishments on Eve and in and they all relate to Bringing forth seed or children because that because she accepted the wrong seed from the serpent hallelujah it's all about and why does her desire now got to be to her husband after the fall because her desire was to the serpent Hallelujah huh why do it got to be on her husband now I thought I thought it was on her husband before it wasn't she was looking at the fruit of adultery and like oh this is good for the eyes oh this is good this is good see and now it's got to go there and remember at the end of uh chapter 3 the Bible said uh the Bible said Adam calls her name Eve because she's a mother how is she a mother if they ate apples she's a mother because she's received two seeds and then in chapter four you have twins born Cain and Abel two two two seeds from two different seed sers one field two seed sewers there it is Matthew 13 one field two sers amen Glory Hallelujah and that's what Paul said let's go to Second Corinthians 11 Paul said I don't want you uh given over to adultery like Eve in other words the deception of her mind second Corinthians 11 verse two for I'm jealous over you with The Godly jealousy I've espoused you I've engaged you to one husband that I may present you as a Chase virgin to Christ so he's saying Corinthians I want you to be virgin not like Eve who lost her virginity verse three but I fear lest by any means as the serpent begou Eve through his subtility so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that's in Christ so Paul connects losing virginity with Eve getting tricked by the devil hallelujah how about Peter Peter said the same thing he said sin entered the world through lust not through a desire for fruit through lust let's go there second Peter chapter 1 uh I'm only at 40 minutes my goodness Glory feel pretty good second Peter chapter 1 sin did not enter the world through uh looking at a fruit tree like oh my I can't wait to eat this fruit it entered through lust which is a forbidden craving all right second Peter chapter 1 verse four whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature have having escaped the corruption that's in the world through lust lust it was lust and whatever they partook of It produced two seeds right now go to Proverbs uh 30 is it Proverbs 30:20 I'm just going off the memory of the Holy Spirit right now by God's grace proverbs 30 verse2 yep that's right that's right thank the Lord guess all those years of study pay off sometimes but awesome what was the fruit in the garden what was the fruit the Bible tells us right here such is the way of an adulterous woman so Eve sin produced an adultery that was the fruit the fruit of adultery it start it first started in here right sin cons sin uh sin enticed sin conceived and then she committed the sin and then it produced death but the adult adultery started here the sin was here but the fruit of that evil thought was adultery such is the way of an adulterous woman she eats eating is liken unto adultery where's it's got to agree with the rest of the Bible amen where's that in the Bible Genesis chapter 3 hallelujah it's got to agree with the rest of the Bible it don't say it don't say apples it says adultery is like an eating right she eateth she wipeth her mouth and saying she's saying I've done no wickedness it's right there hiding in plain sight and the church said brother bam said you got to read between the lines right it's right there but you gotta you got to understand everything else around there you got to read right that's good virtue right there you want to read right right there she's putting up her fingers like that you gotta read between the lines see adultery is a fruit adulter is a fruit that's the fruit they partook of in the garden that's why you produce Cain and the Bible said Cain is not of Adam Cain was of the wicked one first John if you get it before I do I think it's two or three well read that Cain was not of uh Adam Cain was of the wicked one yeah verse chapter 3 vers2 312 1 John 312 not as Cain who is of that Wicked one well now those are fighting words you're you're calling Adam a wicked W one well that's almost fighting words right there a Son of God you're calling a Son of God a wicked one no sir sons of God are blessed not cursed Hallelujah now of course we wouldn't fight I'm talking spiritually get out my my sword get out my Bible I don't want to cause any confusion and slew his brother wherefore he slew him because his own Works were evil and his brothers righteous and brother raham said we got thus saith the Lord on that I heard something pretty astounding too this is totally unrelated but this was an astounding scripture I heard today now it might not be to you so bear with me but in Luke 16 the rich man of Lazarus go to the heart of the Earth right and what does the rich man say let me go back and so they'll believe right but what does Abraham say no even if someone come back from the dead they won't believe even if they've been to Hell he said they got the scriptures to believe Church there is so much power power just in the word of God if you really believe this with all your heart and soul then you won't want to miss church praise God look everybody's faithful church members here you're faithful to your church yes we just love the we just love the word of God see all these signs wonders and miracles are experience that people have if that doesn't make them love the word more they've missed it now you know why this struck me so hard because all these false Apostles these these modern NR n people they all say they go down to Hell and God sent them sent them back to warn people about it well let me give you some news the Bible said that won't help anybody I thought that was astounding to me I was in my car I literally went what that wasn't a very good face but that was my Revelation face like what and all these people say God sent me down to Hell and showed me to come back and give me a Ministry to tell you about hell don't they know that's not even gonna and then then all their stories on hell are different all their stories on Heaven are different it's a lie that's from hell that's a deception from Hell the word of God is truth hallelujah amen if you won't just believe the written word of God you're not fit for heaven Hallelujah but if we believe the written word of God then we're fit for heaven hallelujah we're fit to be called the Sons and Daughters of God we're fit to rule and reign in the Millennium hallelujah thank God so I'll take any experience but make sure it goes back to the word of God hallelujah and if it don't throw it away get you some new ones Hallelujah and start with the experience of reading your Bible every day I'm not preaching you guys I'm preaching out there but I guess it's for the little ones too by God's grace H thus sayith the Lord church we are not playing around we know we got thus sayith the Lord look what they believe an apple produced all this trouble look what they believe angels can create their own bodies if that was the case brother cam brought out this beautiful point I don't know if he got it from somebody else he said if they can create their own bodies why don't Satan just keep creating bodies and he can kill all the humans when did he lose that power to create bodies it was after the fall but Cam said no look he said look Satan still has to fill he had to fill Judas I was like brother cam you got some Revelation man Hallelujah why why don't he just create his own if angels could do that then why can't they do it now see the Bible will never come contradict itself amen hallelujah we live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God hallelujah see their lies are going to find them out eventually and the truth will prevail glory to God brother cam made at the same point too why with the Antichrist we believe it's gonna be the pope or Donald Trump or Elon Musk but I believe it's gonna be the pope but why don't he just Why don't Satan just create his own body rather than fill another person's body if he did that in the beginning to make Giants why don't he do it now bunch of nonsense and then they'll call you and I ridiculous for believing all those scriptures that we just went through and that's not even half of them I got three videos on it you could spend you can spend hours on it I have I wrote a chapter about it and where's all these people trying to correct it there's nobody trying to correct it because they don't have anything to correct because it it was sent to us from a prophet pointing us back to Jesus Christ's word the Bible hallelujah amen GL I'm feeling a little embolden here tonight by God's grace he said what is it it's the quickening power coming to the church making her ready this hour that we're approaching in quickening power oh God help us to receive it help us to believe it see just depends on what attitude you take whether it's going to do you any good or not though see you have to believe that you don't believe that it won't do you one bit of good what about all these people that leave brother brandom's message see it don't do them any good if they don't believe it's the scripture you got to believe it's the scripture because that's what we're all pointing to that's what I fall in love with since I became in the message of of the Bible brother brandom I fall in love with the scripture I'm not going to Fall in Love with a Church Creed I left all that to come out and and and to come out with God's people and believe just the word of God and that's the way we want to stay we want to have an attitude we want to have a respectful attitude and receive thus sayith the Bible thus say the word of God because God sent a prophet to reveal his secrets to us hallelujah amen amen remember these secrets are for us and our children so thank God my children have received it by God's grace Hallelujah let's read that Deuteronomy 29:29 I got that one memorized too by by the help of the Lord not my help Deuteronomy 29:29 see Mysteries are for the people of God remember Paul even said we preached on them months ago uh we speak the wisdom of God in Mysteries they can't even understand what we're saying because they're not the children of God remember Jesus told the Pharisees he said you can't understand my speech because you're not my children Church you ought to thank God you have ears to hear the truth hallelujah most people can't receive it they love the world and Jesus the Bible said if you love the world the love of God's not even in you praise God that's why they don't care to read their Bibles or come to church or be faithful to God or listen to they won't even listen brother brand they'll just hear something and then condemn brother brandom same thing they do to Jesus right it would be the same thing they do to Paul they do the same thing to any any true servant of God just condemn them and the Bible said he that answers a matter before he heareth it it's a shame and Folly unto him see they're shameful they're full of folly they're fools to judge the ministry of brother randam before actually searching it out by the scripture and we could have said that about Martin Luther right same thing same thing John Wesley uh aus stre what the name uh what's the name of the zus street man William Seymour thank you and by the end he had the right Revelation on a lot of things by the end of it he had to go through some awful trials but he had the right Revelation uh by the end of it didn't live very long because a servant of God like that all the pressure all the uh all all the difficult life Deuteronomy 29:29 uh am I there no let's let's read 29 together got your Bibles let's read on three one two three the secret things belong unto the Lord Our God but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever that we may do all the words of this law why are these Mysteries revealed so we can keep the commands Jesus said if you love me keep my commands that's why our church is keeping the commands while other denominations are not most of the adults here were raised in denomination uh sister Nomi was the only one blessed to be raised in the message here bless their heart but all of us then in denominations have seen the Folly of denominations we could all raise our hands see the Foles of the denominations we were raised in and God brought us out of that so we so we would believe the word of God and live all the word of God hallelujah and they belong to us and we're supposed to pass it on to our children this is how you serve God this is how you believe God this is how you please God this how you please God young man that's how you do it the revelation of God comes to you and look now they know how to do marriage and divorce before they wouldn't know they'd be adulterers but they're for us and for our children Hallelujah I'm at okay at 53 minutes okay H okay brother I'm talking about sexy dressed women here let me see is there a thus say the Lord in here oh well here brother yeah here's a good one okay yeah okay yeah this one's on uh hair hair length now he's talking about a woman that would wear shorts now look at they they do less than that she's counted as a prostitute the same as the woman in the act of prostitution see she doesn't know that how does she know her ultimate what's her what's an ultimate it's the last word the ultimate is the amen the so be it it's the end of all Strife your ultimate and if your church a Pentecostal Church that tells you long hair and stuff is just fanaticism you got a spare tire the back of your head and so forth them kind of things that man is possessed of the devil a man that'll let a woman cut her hair he's possessed by the devil because the Bible said it's a shame now that word shame means repulse or disgusting thing in the Greek I pre I I did a video on it I preached on that she brings shame on her husband and then that brings shame on who Christ and who does that bring shame on the invisible father because it's father son man woman Hallelujah and now we let's let's let's well let's read it first cor because I'll just finish with this one because this will be the last quote I read uh yep yeah let's read that we'll just finish with this one here that man's possessed with a devil because Church all you have to do now Rod probably knows history all you have to do is go to the Roaring 20s what's the first thing they did to get their independence they cut off their hair that's right you didn't you send me a letter yes I still got that somewhere in my piles that's right no go ahead brother yes that's right that's right but she wasn't following the Methodist way right that she tried her hair oh that's right the friend was okay the friends one to cut that's right wonderful okay your grandmother was found the word yes wonderful that's right that's right yes thank you I yes I knew there was a connection yes s again I think my grand right right I don't want to that's what I misunderstood shees a Saint she's not a haint very good brother very good and if you just study the 1920s that they first cut off their hair then they put on uh uh they put on the the short skirts right then they went out partying at night what they call them there the uh Flappers that's what they call Flappers and they dancing all night and drunkenness and all these things like that and look what God did God brought a depression upon the people to try to wake him up and it did shake the country up because by the 1950s Church attendance was at its highest so God sent the depress ression and the war to try to shake the country before brother raham gave her her last chance in 1956 brother Braham said thus sayith the Lord you have your last chance it was 50 years since 1906 he said either this year you'll accept the Revival of his ministry and all the brothers preaching that or you'll go into destruction and look where she's at today thus sayith the Lord church we have thus sayith the Lord hallelujah we've been visited with thus said the Lord from a genuine prophet of God now 1 Corinthians 11 that's actually where I was goingon to I was almost ready to preach on Corinthians 10 and 11 here tonight but uh I thought well I want to preach this because I want to review all these thus say the Lord I because I want to get them in I want to get all of them on this slide or this presentation here okay now verse three every man praying or prophesying having his head covered desth his head now our our dear uh our dear Amish friends and our dear menite friends think it's a cap but there's not one word in the Bible that talks about a cloth cap the covering is the hair verse 15 says it but if a woman have long hair it's a glory to her her hair is given her for a cloth covering no just a covering good you C that the hair is the covering and church remember when I told that to those women out there brother it was a New Year's no it was Christmas eve two years ago when I shared that to the women there they were depressed those uh the former Amish women I shared it in that room over there the night I shared that with them they said all the all the uh all the pressure all the Demonic pressure to wear that cap came off they took him off but that night the devil attacked me and took away my breathing at a little after midnight and I couldn't breathe and I thought I was going to die I was running around I was running around the room and I ran to the bathroom and finally my wife said Jesus Jesus and I felt that it was someone was choking me I felt it go off me and that was the demon that didn't like to being exposed Church there's a real God and there's a real devil thank God for a faithful wife thank God for the word of God and now every one of them now they finally feel free to take it off because it was it's the bondage it's the had a bondage if you take it off oh you're a heathen you're you're dead to us a cloth so they made that cloth the baptism of the Holy Ghost just like brother am's son they make plain tapes the baptism Holy Ghost that's not the baptism it's a experience where God comes into your soul and fills your soul with the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's not a piece of cloth it's not playing a tape it's not going to a certain church it's Jesus Christ it's Christ in you the hope of Glory Hallelujah and if you got it it'll guide you into all truth I got one minute left okay perfect timing could it be any better than that by God's gra I got a 30 minute song service and an hour sermon in one sermon or one service what's going on here there's a transformation going on here verse verse five but every every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonor that means repulse disrespects repulses her husband for that is even all as if she were saving so even if she trims it it's the same as cutting it all off look what Miley Cyrus did that's those look at Britney Spears what do they do when they Rebellion they cut off their hair right to show their and and from what I've heard recently Britney Spears was under control of her dad I guess he was stealing all her money or something like that so that's why she cut it off to show she's not under his uh bondage or whatever let see that's what it says verse six for if the woman be not covered let her also be Shor so if she don't want to let her hair grow uncut she might as well be Shor Paul says just shave it all off if you're not going to honor God and church this still stands i' I've challenged people for years show me one verse where God asked a Godly woman to cut her hair there's none but every time I'll show you it was always evil women who cut their hair e it was always right it was always evil woman that wear makeup Hallelujah so and then and then they say oh we speak where the Bible speaks and we're silent where the Bible's silent well the Bible's silent on Godly women cutting their hair right so that means it's speaking they're supposed to never cut their hair and then you have this there's my hour then you have this entire first 16 verses where a woman is never to cut her hair see now verse seven for a man indeed ought not to cover his head U for as much he's the image and glory of God but that woman is the glory of the man now I'm going to skip down to finish up here verse 13 judging yourselves is it calmly or is it correct that a woman pray to God uncovered so or seemly is it right that a woman prays to God with her haircut doth not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it's a shame un him because 40% of men go ball hey God bless you R you haven't lost your hair praise God that's what I know I'm going to get too my grandpa had his hair thin out too uh but see even nature itself 40% yeah I was looking I was at a a meeting there with with hundreds of teachers the other day I looked at almost every man had a bald head bald oh thank God I still got here brother brother BR went bald and he had to buy he had to wear a wig because if he didn't wear it he gets sick you know all the cold air blowing in verse 15 but if a woman have long hair a glory to her for her hair is given her for covering but if any man seem to be contentious we have no such that word such means other no other custom neither do the Churches of God see some people read that say well see Paul said oh you don't have to follow it that's not what he's saying he said we have no other practice Yeah if you look in the other translations it's no other practice there's no other way we handle hair than this in all the Churches of God because again show me one verse where Paul said women can cut their hair you're not going to find it now the last one as we uh I'm trying to close I'm not try not to go over 1 Timothy 2 verse 9 I think it is and I hold I wrote a whole book on modesty so uh if people can't see it it's just because they're ignorant they they're they're willingly ignorant that's the worst kind of ignorance they're willingly trying to avoid it if they don't want to understand remember the Bible defines it you got to cover from the shoulder down to the shin at least then I ask our sisters to go lower because I do you don't see me we walk around with with half shorts on or skirs or what are they called what what what are the men those long shorts men wear what do they call nickers yeah yeah I don't see me walk around like that see how much sun I can get on my calves goodness gracious see the man's got to model modesty he's the leader of the church he's the leader of the family he's got to be the example right 2 verse 9 in like manner also so that women Adorn themselves in modest appar with shamefacedness and sobriety not with broided hair that means expensive hairstyles or gold or pearls or costly array lyia has a lot of great pictures from the times of Rome where they had super expensive hairstyles I need to show the church that that was a that was a marvelous F there great job I need to compliment All My Children sometimes I leaves some out all right let's stand and let me read this for God's word said it's a shame for a woman to cut her hair she'll dishonor her head musician can if she dishonors her husband and her husband is the church and the church is Christ she's dishonorable religious prostitute naked and don't know it naked don't the Bible say the woman's covering is her hair isn't her hair given to her for a covering and the church said look brother man says someday Yonder at the Judgment bar I've tried to pour the medicine the medicine of 1 Corinthians 11 the medicine of 1 Timothy 2:9 I've tried to pour that in your mouth and hold it in with my hands and you spit it right back out between your fingers God will judge them someday that's thus sayith the Lord just like Jeremiah Ezekiel and Isaiah they told them told them told them and they just didn't want to obey they got more stiff neck they got more rebellious same thing brother Bram experienced the majority of the people just kept cutting their hair wearing makeup wearing pants all these things and he said on the day of judgment that's what it'll be like I tried to give you the medicine but you spit out the medicine you spit out the word of God Church let's swallow the word of God I said it before if if you swallow the word of God life will swallow up
