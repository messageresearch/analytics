[27:21] [Applause]
[27:38] [Applause]
[27:45] [Applause]
[27:48] [Music]
[28:09] our Bibles this evening by the grace of
[28:12] Lord and try to be mindful the time the
[28:14] grace of the Lord we have a couple
[28:19] portions of Scripture I'd like to read
[28:21] from tonight I just want to take the
[28:22] thought I never finish it last week
[28:24] about the just shall live by faith I
[28:26] want to preach on that tonight by the
[28:28] grace of God I look at that thought and
[28:33] kind of look at look at salvation again
[28:35] by the grace Lord and justification we
[28:37] look at that if we can by the grace of
[28:40] God so there's numerous scriptures here
[28:43] let's go to Romans 5:1 let's just read
[28:46] that by God's grace
[28:47] [Music]
[28:55] you know we looked at the Sardis Church
[28:57] age last Wednesday and saw how Martin
[29:00] Luther was the messenger and his main
[29:04] message was the just shall live by faith
[29:06] now didn't you hear brother Craig preach
[29:08] on that on Sunday morning he brought him
[29:09] out with Martin Luther on Sunday morning
[29:11] I thought well praise the Lord he kept
[29:12] hitting the church ages and he doesn't
[29:14] listen to our services so it was just it
[29:16] was God encouraging us right it's God
[29:18] encouraging us that we got to stay right
[29:20] with the word you know we got a pay
[29:22] attention that all the all these things
[29:24] are important everything God has given
[29:25] us the same thoughts the same thoughts
[29:27] all the time so after he preached out I
[29:29] just felt that I just really want to go
[29:31] look at the just shall live by faith and
[29:32] look at faith again salvation again
[29:34] because how many know that the Bible
[29:36] said that David lost the joy of his
[29:38] salvation he didn't lose his salvation
[29:40] he just lost the joy of it I mean no the
[29:42] Bible says that in Psalms 51 so we want
[29:45] to look at that again tonight and
[29:46] because brother Graham said truly if the
[29:49] Lutheran's would get back to doing what
[29:51] Luther said and what he taught they
[29:53] would be acceptable unto God today if
[29:55] they got back to that so I want to see
[29:57] how important that is for us tonight and
[29:59] look at the just shall live by faith
[30:00] Romans 5:1 if you have your Bibles there
[30:03] Romans 5:1
[30:07] let's read let's the read verse 1
[30:10] together and now read verse 2 let's read
[30:12] verse 1 let's begin one two three
[30:14] therefore being justified by faith we
[30:18] have peace with God through our Lord
[30:19] Jesus Christ and I'll just read verse to
[30:21] myself by whom also we have access by
[30:25] faith into this grace wherein we stand
[30:28] and rejoice in hope of the glory of God
[30:32] so are we standing in grace tonight or
[30:34] in works tonight we're standing in grace
[30:36] tonight and how do we have access to
[30:38] that we have access by faith through
[30:40] grace to Lord Jesus Christ through his
[30:43] blood amen let's just bow our heads if
[30:45] ever needed on your heart just making
[30:46] known unto God as we preach his word
[30:48] here have any father we love you tonight
[30:51] Lord we've sung your songs though the
[30:53] way be stormy or thorny will praise the
[30:55] Lord dear God we all worship you will
[30:57] sing to you will rejoice Lord God
[30:59] rejoice children say yes servant Lord I
[31:03] love that that verse there say yes
[31:05] servant say yes say yes say yes Lord so
[31:08] our hearts say
[31:09] we'll keep serving we'll keep loving is
[31:12] one day we want to fly away Lord with
[31:14] you dear Jesus that's our desire whether
[31:16] it be Lord through death and the body
[31:18] change Lord or just through the body
[31:21] change while we're living the quicken
[31:22] made alive Lord the quicken swallowed up
[31:25] Lord and life - your God either one
[31:28] father we want to fly away to our ternal
[31:30] home Lord fill with the Holy Ghost and
[31:33] pleasing you Lord God speak to us here

[31:38] Jesus and father bless the hungry hearts
[31:41] that are here help us have the right
[31:42] attitude lord help us to get in your
[31:44] presence and have the right approach we
[31:46] thank you for every soul and Lord every
[31:48] opportunity to hear your word in Jesus
[31:51] Christ's name in every said Amen god
[31:53] bless you mean see the praise the Lord
[31:55] someone look at the just shall live by
[31:57] faith and so I want to just take that
[32:08] thought like we left off last week
[32:11] [Music]
[32:15] Luther before we get into the rest of
[32:17] the Sardis Church age I just want to
[32:18] stop and look at are we living by faith
[32:22] and do we feel justified tonight at the
[32:24] end of the message that's what I want
[32:25] you to ask yourself that as we go
[32:27] through and at the end I'll remind you
[32:29] do you feel justified tonight do you
[32:31] feel righteous that means righteous and
[32:34] if you don't hopefully by the end you do
[32:37] by the grace of Lord that's what I want
[32:38] everybody to be able to to grasp here
[32:40] tonight because how many ever how many
[32:43] fights ain't real hard this week anybody
[32:45] fights ain't real hard and you and you
[32:48] feel that you tries to make you feel
[32:49] discouraged he tries to make you doubt
[32:51] he tries to make you fear he tries to
[32:54] discourage you in any way you can but
[32:56] the just live by faith not by their
[32:59] feelings but by faith in the Word of God
[33:01] so we're look at that tonight here by
[33:04] the grace of God the just shall live by
[33:07] faith
[33:07] remember this was Martin Luther's main
[33:09] message he he did a lot of teaching a
[33:11] lot of the writing he was uh he was a
[33:14] very famous author in his day he was
[33:16] like what we call like a Joel Osteen
[33:18] today or a TD jakes
[33:20] or somebody that's like Oprah Winfrey
[33:22] except
[33:23] oddly person right a godly rogue alley
[33:24] person he was a top seller his tracks
[33:28] and the pamphlets and the papers that he
[33:29] wrote was the best-selling he was the
[33:31] most sought-after preacher he was the
[33:34] the most popular writer as well because
[33:37] he was giving people the revelation of
[33:39] the hour amen
[33:41] and so let's look at this here are we
[33:42] you didn't actually I didn't do that
[33:44] text I forgot to change that screen so
[33:46] that's my phone I forgot to change it
[33:47] but here's where we left off last week
[33:49] but for all that God used Martin Luther
[33:52] let it not be said that his intentions
[33:54] were wrong let it only be said his
[33:56] judgment failed and remember they failed
[33:58] with the peasant wars now brother Craig
[34:01] even mentioned that on Sunday morning
[34:02] too brother Ram said there's history
[34:04] that the peasants or the poor people
[34:08] that heard Martin Luther teach and was
[34:09] reading his tracks they kind of got
[34:11] upset and they wanted rights so they all
[34:14] form like a militia and he started
[34:16] fighting against the government and
[34:18] thousands of them were slain by the
[34:19] government and so brother Branham said
[34:21] that history says that Martin Luther had
[34:24] part of the responsibility of stirring
[34:26] them up and so that's what we read last
[34:29] week we actually read that last week as
[34:31] well they were called the peasant Wars
[34:32] you can read that in history during the
[34:34] Reformation there so so Martin Luther
[34:38] was not a prophet but he was a godly man
[34:40] remember he had all nine gifts of the
[34:42] Holy Spirit what about what of what a
[34:43] testimony that is to say that all nine
[34:46] gifts of this Holy Spirit have flowed
[34:47] through me my I've only had a few you
[34:49] know but he had all nine flow through
[34:52] him what a man of God well here's the
[34:55] statement I want to focus on truly if
[34:57] the Lutheran's get back to his teaching
[35:01] and serve God as this gracious brother
[35:04] served him then that people would surely
[35:07] be a credit and praise to the great God
[35:10] and Savior Jesus Christ help me believe
[35:14] that well Graham wrote that in 1965 and
[35:16] he's saying if the Lutheran's got back
[35:18] to what Martin Luther actually preached
[35:20] they would be us they'd be a blessing to
[35:23] the kingdom of God now if they just stay
[35:25] with Martin Luther would they be fill
[35:27] with the Holy Ghost no but would they be
[35:29] justified you better believe it they'd
[35:31] be justified because that's why God
[35:33] needed the star of Martin Luther
[35:35] the brightness of Martin Luther's
[35:37] message which was a just shall live by
[35:39] faith so I want to bring this out does
[35:41] anybody know what Luther taught you know
[35:43] what he actually said here's what he
[35:44] actually said now by the end of eight or
[35:48] 15 18 according to most scholars Luther
[35:50] reached a new understanding of the
[35:52] pivotal Christian notion of salvation or
[35:54] reconciliation with God over the
[35:57] centuries the church had conceived the
[35:59] means of salvation in a variety of ways
[36:01] but common to all of them was the idea
[36:03] that salvation is jointly effected by
[36:06] humans and by God by humans through
[36:10] marshalling or mastering their will to
[36:13] do good works and thereby to please God
[36:16] and by God through his offer of
[36:18] forgiving grace Luther broke
[36:20] dramatically with this tradition by
[36:23] asserting that humans can contribute
[36:25] nothing to their salvation glory
[36:29] salvation is fully and completely a work
[36:32] of divine grace I mean like that the
[36:35] Roman Catholic Church and the Anglican
[36:37] and all the churches that are broken off
[36:38] they had all mixed works back into
[36:41] salvation that you you know you've that
[36:45] God is offering it but you've got
[36:47] something to do it and if you do the
[36:49] right thing now you're righteous because
[36:50] you did it and Martin Luther breaks from
[36:53] that and said man has no part in his
[36:56] salvation it is God giving him the gift
[36:59] to salvation amen and we're gonna find
[37:04] out that our messenger said the same
[37:06] thing
[37:06] aim ahead Martin Luther said you it's
[37:09] God's divine grace you can give nothing
[37:12] to God right member the Bible said what
[37:15] house will you build me as beautiful and
[37:18] building a Solomon could built really
[37:20] was that beautiful to God no because in
[37:22] a few years what it fell apart and
[37:25] member God does not need the works of
[37:27] our hands God doesn't have to have you
[37:30] know our efforts for us to get to heaven
[37:32] God doesn't need that does God make us
[37:34] like we talked about at the youth group
[37:36] tonight there's God want us to do good
[37:39] works yes he created us to do good works
[37:41] but he doesn't need our works for us to
[37:43] get to heaven
[37:43] all's he needs is just for us to say yes
[37:46] and believe in his free gift that's all
[37:49] i need's
[37:49] so we have nothing that we can give for
[37:52] our salvation it is fully a gift of God
[37:55] now Martin Luther came to this
[37:57] understanding after a long inner
[38:00] conflict in which he agonized even
[38:02] despair over his inability to marshal
[38:05] his will adequately to do good work so
[38:07] even as a Catholic priest Martin Luther
[38:09] just couldn't master his his will very
[38:11] well and he's always had this inner
[38:13] conflict while meditating on Romans 1:17
[38:16] so let's go there real quick let's go
[38:18] Romans 1 I'll just pull it up real quick
[38:20] here Romans 1:17 I think I forgot to put
[38:24] the slide in there so he was meditating
[38:26] on Romans 1:17 and he had what he called
[38:31] like heaven opened up to him for therein
[38:35] is the righteousness of God revealed
[38:38] from faith to faith as it is written the
[38:41] just shall live by faith so Martin
[38:44] Luther is meditating on this this is
[38:46] what the history says about him the
[38:48] righteousness of God is revealed to man
[38:51] from faith to faith in other words God
[38:54] will give you a revelation for salvation
[38:57] and then it'll give you a revelation for
[38:58] the next step but all the time it's God
[39:00] revealing it to us it's not us working
[39:02] our way into it it's God revealing it
[39:05] amen
[39:06] it's God showing us so here he he's
[39:10] meditating upon this and look what it
[39:12] says he experienced an illumination that
[39:16] he later described as a kind of
[39:17] conversion it was if the very gates of
[39:21] heaven had opened before me Amen I'm not
[39:25] earning my salvation God showed me I'm
[39:27] saved
[39:29] God God revealed to me the faith to be
[39:33] saved amen I didn't work for it God gave
[39:36] it to me God showed me I'm saying isn't
[39:39] that how you felt when you first gave
[39:40] your heart to the Lord oh God's always
[39:42] wanted me to be saved
[39:43] this is his gift to me he was always
[39:45] chasing me all those years then he was
[39:48] always near to me he was always guiding
[39:50] me he always loved me and finally I've
[39:53] surrendered and he's revealed faith to
[39:57] me Amen that's right glory the dramatic
[40:02] and intensely
[40:03] personal nature of this experience helps
[40:06] to explain Luther's determined refusal
[40:09] during the indulgences controversy to
[40:12] recant his theological views because
[40:14] remember in his day people would go to
[40:17] the priests and pay money and then the
[40:20] priests would write out a piece of paper
[40:21] yes you're already forgiven for the sin
[40:24] you're going to do and they would go to
[40:26] the sin like they would rape rape a
[40:29] person or they would murder or they
[40:30] would steal or they would slap somebody
[40:33] or they would do something evil they
[40:34] would steal from someone they had the
[40:36] paper that says you're already forgiven
[40:38] for it because they paid money for it
[40:40] and luther saw this and just had pain in
[40:44] his heart until he read this and
[40:46] realized my heaven is open here i can't
[40:49] pay for salvation i can't pay for
[40:51] forgiveness god already paid for an amen
[40:54] god i already paid for my salvation
[40:57] we can't pay money for it but god
[40:59] already paid for through his son jesus
[41:01] amen but see he was seeing all the
[41:04] indulgences and he had to god had to
[41:07] show him it's not by man's contributions
[41:10] it's what God did it's God revealing to
[41:12] man the faith that he needs to be saved
[41:15] aren't you glad you have faith to be
[41:16] saved amen it's a gift of God the Bible
[41:19] said so what about the brand embrace
[41:22] your brother Brandon preached that well
[41:23] you know you got you're saved if you do
[41:25] the right works you're only saying if
[41:30] you God will save you if you do the
[41:31] right works no that's not it brother and
[41:36] said now works are fine but they don't
[41:39] save you oh because you stopped smoking
[41:42] Beau Geste I'm gonna save you no no
[41:45] that's not it it's not by my works they
[41:48] don't save me they don't even make you
[41:51] perfect right because you can do nice
[41:53] things you can fast and pray and give to
[41:56] the poor that doesn't make you perfect
[41:57] you still straddle a sin the sin that
[41:59] dwells within you right it is Christ or
[42:03] perish it is not even Christ and works
[42:06] like like like Luther was seeing it is
[42:10] Christ alone this age began the years of
[42:13] Arminianism that does not believe in
[42:15] Christ as the reality it
[42:17] not seeing of nothing but the blood
[42:18] force things nothing but the blood and
[42:20] my own conduct would that be an awful
[42:24] song nothing but Jesus blood and all my
[42:27] good conduct all the good things I do
[42:30] what we'll see now I've got a part in
[42:32] Salvation but that's not what the song
[42:34] says the song says nothing but the blood
[42:36] hey nothing but the blood of Jesus this
[42:39] is all I see this is all my hope and
[42:41] peace nothing but the blood of Jesus I
[42:45] love that now I believe in good conduct
[42:48] if you are saved you will do righteously
[42:52] we have already gone over that but let
[42:55] me tell you now salvation is not Jesus
[42:57] Plus well I'm saved by the Amen because
[43:00] I go to message Church no I'm say
[43:04] brother Adam because I'm a preacher and
[43:06] I've given God all my life no that's
[43:08] that's a lie I'm saying because Jesus
[43:11] died for me and God gave me the faith he
[43:14] revealed the faith for me to be saved
[43:16] and that's why that's why I'm saying
[43:18] because he revealed it from faith to
[43:21] faith the just shall live by faith amen
[43:25] not my works not because I have six kids
[43:28] or not because I treat my wife good or
[43:31] because I work hard and pay my tithes
[43:33] and offering that's not why I'm saved
[43:35] i'm saved by jesus's efforts amen it is
[43:39] Jesus alone salvation is of the Lord and
[43:42] don't you think how many need reminders
[43:44] of this sometimes I do I beat myself up
[43:47] more than anybody I criticize myself
[43:49] more than anybody I get all myself all
[43:53] the time and this is what we need
[43:55] reminders of that we must live by the
[43:57] faith that's inside of us we live by
[43:59] that and our faith is in God's Word amen
[44:02] from start to finish that means even
[44:05] right now tonight it is all God amen
[44:09] let his life be in me the only way I'll
[44:13] do anything good is if I let his life
[44:15] flow through me I just got to heal I
[44:17] just got a surrender let it be his blood
[44:22] that cleanses me I love this life in me
[44:24] blood cleanses me let his Spirit fill me
[44:28] hallelujah let it be
[44:30] his stripes that heal me amen hallelujah
[44:33] glory let it be Jesus and Jesus alone
[44:37] not by works of righteousness which I've
[44:40] done no sir
[44:41] Christ is my life amen that's what the
[44:45] Philadelphia Church cake we're not quite
[44:46] there yet we're one church age away and
[44:49] remember the scripture if I for by grace
[44:51] are you saved through what the faith and
[44:55] that faith is not of yourself that faith
[44:57] is even a gift from God because already
[44:59] showed you it's revealed from God from
[45:02] faith to faith that faith is a
[45:03] revelation and not of works lest any man
[45:07] can boast so when it comes to salvation
[45:10] nobody can brag and say or not and I've
[45:13] just put it up here so you can
[45:15] understand brother Branham cannot boast
[45:17] about being saved well I went around the
[45:20] world seven times brother and I saw
[45:22] visions 80% of my life was in visions he
[45:25] can't boast on that hears nothing he can
[45:27] boast of Paul labored more than all the
[45:30] other apostles right he labored more
[45:31] than all of them
[45:33] he can't say well I'm saying because I'm
[45:35] the apostle to the Gentiles look how
[45:37] wonderful I am and and look what I'd
[45:39] done he there's no bragging in heaven
[45:42] amen
[45:43] can you say amen to that there's no
[45:45] there's not gonna be any pride in heaven
[45:46] right it's gonna be Jesus getting all
[45:50] the glory amen and the Bible said it's a
[45:54] free gift you are being justified freely
[45:58] by His grace through the redemption that
[46:02] is in Jesus Christ but the Hosea was
[46:03] talking on the way to Jeffersonville
[46:04] yesterday and he said this he said if we
[46:08] had a sign free food everybody would
[46:09] stop cuz they love free stuff right but
[46:12] then he said if anyone wants free
[46:14] salvation through Jesus Christ nobody
[46:16] would stop right because they don't they
[46:21] don't love Christ or I say like this it
[46:23] hasn't been revealed to them or they're
[46:25] running away from what's God is trying
[46:27] to reveal them because remember the
[46:28] Bible said God's Christ is knocking on
[46:30] the church let me in the church I want
[46:33] to fellowship with you I want to take
[46:34] you out to eat I want to order to meet
[46:36] with you I want to be I want to I want
[46:38] to fellowship I want to be your friend
[46:41] they want free natural things but they
[46:44] don't want what
[46:45] free and it's the most valuable thing
[46:47] but church we should rejoice in this
[46:49] justified freely by His grace amen amen
[46:54] he declared me righteous and I didn't
[46:57] have any I didn't pay anything for it he
[46:59] freely gave it to me right by his
[47:02] unmerited favor grace
[47:05] that's just his favor to me he wanted to
[47:07] do us a favor right that's grace we're
[47:11] justified freely by His grace through
[47:12] the redemption that is in Christ Jesus
[47:16] amen hallelujah can we say praise the
[47:19] Lord we said praise the Lord Amen free
[47:21] it's a free justification a free gift
[47:25] you know if you do anything you just
[47:27] have to receive it and say Amen
[47:28] I believe it how did Christ freely
[47:31] justify us let's go back and get some of
[47:34] these wonderful scriptures he shall see
[47:36] the travail the so in Isaiah 53 one of
[47:37] those beautiful chapters in the whole
[47:39] Bible like I told my wife and family I
[47:41] think I told my wife that if I pass away
[47:43] read Isaiah 53 at my funeral because I
[47:47] was wounded for my transgressions and
[47:49] with His stripes I'm healed amen
[47:52] freely not because I what I did freely
[47:56] by his blood amen
[47:57] I'm I'm healed freely by him hallelujah
[48:01] because I love it because we love him
[48:03] because God revealed faith to us amen
[48:05] Gouri he shall see the travail so God
[48:10] will see the travail of Christ's soul
[48:11] and shall be satisfied with it by his
[48:15] knowledge shall my righteous servant and
[48:17] justify many see Jesus Jesus had
[48:19] knowledge that he had to go to the cross
[48:20] remember Elisha Moses come told him
[48:22] about it you've got to go to the cross
[48:24] they spoke of his decease coming he had
[48:27] knowledge and he had to obey that he had
[48:28] to go to the cross and by doing that he
[48:31] would justify many people for he shall
[48:34] bear their iniquities so how does Jesus
[48:37] make us justified or righteous he took
[48:40] our sins amen Romans 5:19 for my one
[48:45] man's disobedience many were made
[48:47] sinners so by the obedience of one many
[48:49] shall be made righteous so Satan's
[48:51] trying to accuse you of your sins and I
[48:52] tell them no Jesus took it praise God
[48:55] Jesus took it Jesus already bore mice
[48:58] I'm not going to hell I'm not gonna pay
[49:00] for my sin Jesus already bore them amen
[49:04] freely freely freely gave me the gift
[49:08] freely saved me it's not Jesus plus I'm
[49:10] in the message or Jesus plus I memorized
[49:12] this book of the Bible or that quote
[49:14] it's not Jesus plus that it's Jesus
[49:16] alone amen whom God has set forth to be
[49:20] a propitiation through his blood to
[49:23] declare his righteousness for the
[49:26] remission of sins that are past through
[49:29] the forbearance of God there's a lot of
[49:32] important things in there to declare I
[49:34] say at this time his righteousness that
[49:36] he might be just and the justifier of
[49:38] him that believeth in Jesus how many
[49:40] believe in Jesus if you believe in Jesus
[49:42] he's the judge he's your justifier amen
[49:46] he's the one that will make you
[49:48] righteous praise God where is boasting
[49:50] then who's gonna brag that his brother
[49:52] Brad I'm gonna brag brother Jesse your
[49:54] brother Craig your brother Jose didn't
[49:56] anybody here gonna brag about what
[49:57] they've done
[49:58] there's no boasting it is excluded by
[50:01] what law by or works nay but by the law
[50:04] of faith God gives you the gift of faith
[50:06] and now you operate by the law of this
[50:09] face substance inside of you it's a gift
[50:11] of God freely given to those who believe
[50:15] now propitiation has two meanings
[50:18] Jesus is made God the propitiation
[50:22] through faith in his blood that's a big
[50:26] fancy word remember how many remember
[50:28] what it means another word for is mercy
[50:30] seat God made Jesus to be a mercy seat
[50:34] for us okay and I'm gonna show I'm just
[50:38] gonna jump ahead for this because this
[50:39] might review for some of us but the Ark
[50:40] of the Covenant this lid is the mercy
[50:44] seat everybody familiar with that the
[50:47] only way so so so the law the law was
[50:50] against God's people so God designed
[50:53] this this Ark in a way where the law
[50:56] would be covered up the law had to be
[50:58] cover up for God to fellowship with any
[51:00] man how many understand that because all
[51:03] men had sinned so God could have no
[51:07] fellowship unless he put a cover on the
[51:09] law because we can't stare the law in
[51:11] the face and said I'm
[51:13] I can keep all that law we need that law
[51:16] covered up and not only covered up but
[51:20] somebody has to be covered up and then
[51:23] someone has to pay the price for our
[51:24] sins for us to even hear from God
[51:27] because the Bible said God said Moses
[51:30] I'll speak to Aaron from above the mercy
[51:33] seat right but before he can do that
[51:36] there has to be seven drops of blood on
[51:39] the mercy seat that's why I drew seven
[51:41] drops there I just drew those with
[51:42] fellow illustrator and then remember the
[51:45] type there it was seven seven drops so
[51:49] it was ephesus simona Pergamos Thyatira
[51:53] Sardis Philadelphia and Laodicea amen
[51:57] there was seven measures of blood there
[52:00] was seven measures of blood or seven
[52:02] measures of life that was paid there was
[52:04] blood for every age Amen there's a
[52:07] sacrifice for every age other words that
[52:09] means Jesus was going to sit in heaven
[52:11] at the throne of God as an intercessor
[52:14] for seven church ages and the blood of
[52:16] Christ would last for all seven Church
[52:18] ages hey man that's right
[52:22] so look at that picture
[52:24] Christ is the mercy seat he's the cover
[52:26] and then we must have faith in that
[52:29] blood when we have faith that God
[52:32] accepts that blood now God can talk to
[52:35] us in the holiest praise God now we can
[52:39] hear God's voice saying oh yeah you
[52:40] should do this yeah I'm gonna lead you
[52:42] to do this and your life is going to be
[52:44] this for this this purpose but first we
[52:47] have to know Christ as our mercy seat
[52:50] he's our cover and we must have faith in
[52:53] Christ's blood do you see any of Aaron's
[52:57] works here you see anything Moses did
[52:59] here so God can talk to them there's
[53:01] nothing they did it wasn't their blood
[53:03] it wasn't their sacrifice they just
[53:06] brought the blood that was sacrifice
[53:08] into the place and sprinkled it and
[53:10] that's all we've got to do we've just
[53:12] got to bring of the blood of an innocent
[53:14] one into God's presence and got to
[53:17] receive us amen that's all we got to do
[53:19] it's not our works it's not well I
[53:23] fasted this long or I did this we should
[53:25] do that
[53:26] should pray but it should be God leading
[53:28] us to do that it's not well I attended
[53:31] this many services so now God's gonna
[53:32] answer my prayer it's not by our works
[53:35] were saved it's by his blood amen
[53:39] now you see this word propitiation a few
[53:41] more times in the scripture first John
[53:43] 2:1
[53:44] my little children these things write I
[53:45] unto you that you sin not so he would
[53:49] write them letters so they wouldn't sin
[53:50] praise God and if any man sin we have an
[53:54] advocate which means that defense
[53:55] counsel a lawyer write a defense lawyer
[53:59] if any of you sinned you have a defense
[54:02] counsel with the father Jesus Christ the
[54:06] righteous so now Jesus Christ is not
[54:08] only your mercy seat he's also your
[54:11] defense lawyer so if you're getting
[54:13] accused of something in the court of God
[54:15] if saint is accusing you day and night
[54:17] you can talk before you talk or before
[54:19] they call you to the stand you can talk
[54:21] to your lawyer in other words your
[54:22] lawyer will talk for you because your
[54:25] lawyer knows the law is pretty good
[54:27] right your lawyer works in the court
[54:29] system he understands all the law he
[54:31] gets paid the big bucks he knows all
[54:33] about the court system and you've seen
[54:36] it you've probably seen it on TV or the
[54:37] news where the lawyer will talk and the
[54:39] defendant just sits there he just sits
[54:42] there the lawyer talks Church I hope we
[54:44] can do that by God's grace I hope we can
[54:46] let the word talk for us amen hallelujah
[54:49] now try to make excuses where I would
[54:52] have done this or I should have done
[54:53] this all right but let Christ the word
[54:55] speak for us amen because he's our
[54:58] defense counsel hallelujah and he is the
[55:03] propitiation for our sins and not for
[55:05] ours only but also for the sins of the
[55:08] whole world but they have to believe and
[55:09] hereby we do know that we know him if we
[55:12] keep his commands he that saith I know
[55:16] him and keepeth not his commands is a
[55:18] liar and the truth is not in him so how
[55:21] could you say you know God and know the
[55:23] blood and then don't deny what that
[55:26] voice is saying above you can't John
[55:29] says if you love God you'll keep his
[55:32] commands because he has his Mercy's
[55:35] forgiving us it like that he's giving
[55:36] you the mercy seat so I added some words
[55:39] can you see the words I had
[55:40] there Christ the Advocate our defense
[55:42] attorney the mercy seat all right and
[55:46] the law is the judge we'd say this is a
[55:48] court system the laws the judge but we
[55:51] have a defense witness we have a defense
[55:53] counsel we must have faith in Christ's
[55:56] blood and then God speaks to us from
[55:58] there how many know that the Bible said
[56:00] the church is a judgment is a courtroom
[56:03] remember we preach on that first John
[56:05] I'm sorry first Peter 3:17 that judgment
[56:08] begins we're at the house of God every
[56:11] time we do or don't come to church this
[56:13] is the courtroom right here by God's
[56:16] grace how many understand that God will
[56:19] speak to us and like that sometimes I
[56:21] just like to step off to the side
[56:22] because it's not me if God speaks behind
[56:25] this desk or this pulpit this is where
[56:28] God speaks right through the fivefold
[56:30] ministry so if we believe Christ is our
[56:33] defense and we have faith in Christ
[56:35] blood and we accept what God is saying
[56:36] then God's life will speak to us and we
[56:41] can't say we know God and not keep the
[56:43] commands for what he's saying up here we
[56:44] can't do that because we love the word
[56:47] so much we love God so much that
[56:49] anything this anyone that would forgive
[56:51] me and spare my life I would do anything
[56:54] to serve them and that's how it is with
[56:55] Christ if he spares us and eyes for us
[56:57] then we should live for him I think
[57:02] there's one more in perpetuation first
[57:04] John 4:9 and this was manifested the
[57:07] love of God toward us because that God
[57:10] sent His only begotten Son into the
[57:12] world that we might live through him
[57:16] here in his love and that we loved God
[57:19] I'm sorry here in his love not that we
[57:21] loved God it was he's not our works but
[57:23] that he loved us and sent his son to be
[57:27] the propitiation of our sins so the
[57:30] cover beloved if God so loved us we
[57:34] ought also to love one another so in
[57:38] God's courtroom only Christ has
[57:40] righteousness you and I we have no
[57:43] righteousness we can bring praise God
[57:45] because second Peter 1:1 tells me that
[57:48] Simon Peter a servant and apostle of
[57:50] Jesus Christ to them that have obtained
[57:53] like precious faith
[57:54] with us through the righteousness of God
[57:57] and our Savior Jesus Christ amen
[58:01] you've obtained faith through whose
[58:03] righteousness how did you get righteous
[58:05] in God's courtroom it was Christ's
[58:07] righteousness amen so if grace and
[58:11] justification is free how are so many
[58:13] lost if this is free and such a powerful
[58:17] gospel why are so many lost well the
[58:20] Bible says they fall back or retreat
[58:23] from the gift of God in other words they
[58:25] turn their back and run from the gift of
[58:27] God or they turn their back and run away
[58:28] from the preaching of the gospel that's
[58:31] what the Bible says that's why so many
[58:33] will be lost they won't just sit and
[58:35] listen and let faith but faith cometh by
[58:38] what hearing they won't even sit and
[58:40] hear the humble word of God Church
[58:42] you're so blessed if you're here in the
[58:44] humble Word of God tonight and you're
[58:46] receiving it praise to the heart you're
[58:48] so blessed it's not Jesus plus it is
[58:51] Jesus alone amen look at I saw the Bible
[58:55] said he failed grace he failed the gift
[58:59] of God and God hated Esau looking
[59:04] diligently lest any man fail the grace
[59:06] of God lest any root of bitterness we
[59:09] talk preach on that recently springing
[59:11] up trouble you and thereby many be
[59:13] defiled member or East always bitter
[59:15] towards his parents bitter towards Jacob
[59:17] how was he bitter well he was bitter
[59:19] anyone to kill Jacob so he had a
[59:21] murdering spirit on him instead of
[59:23] giving grace to Jacob and grace towards
[59:25] his parents he was bitter toward them
[59:27] right he in other words he turned his
[59:30] back on the gift of God the grace of God
[59:32] he said I'm gonna just I want to murder
[59:34] I want to just I want to marry as many
[59:36] wives I would be a fornicator I'm not
[59:38] gonna marry a Christian we'd say I'm not
[59:40] gonna wear a Jewish woman I'm not gonna
[59:42] I'll just do despite God's grace so he
[59:46] turned his back on the gift of God so
[59:49] see when we turn our backs on the word
[59:50] of god we're turning our backs on the
[59:52] grace of god the grace of god remember
[59:55] the bible said this now the just shall
[59:57] live by faith but if any man draw back
[1:00:01] my soul shall have no pleasure in him
[1:00:05] but we are not
[1:00:07] them who draw back unto perdition but of
[1:00:11] them that believe to the same you save
[1:00:13] me of the souls that help by God's grace
[1:00:15] you see that's how so many people will
[1:00:17] be lost it's so free God is offering his
[1:00:20] arms wide open he wants everybody to be
[1:00:23] saved why are so many lost they know
[1:00:25] what that they don't want it they draw
[1:00:28] back they'd rather live and have these
[1:00:29] feelings and and do their will then
[1:00:33] humble themselves and believe on God's
[1:00:35] gift
[1:00:36] look what drawback means Church it means
[1:00:39] a timid the timid timidity of one
[1:00:43] stealthily retreating so it's retreating
[1:00:45] right it's a it's a soldier who retreats
[1:00:48] in there in the midst of the battle it's
[1:00:50] someone who gives up fighting we have no
[1:00:54] part in shrinking back we are free from
[1:00:57] coward cowardice of etc how many brave
[1:01:02] Christians we got in here you better be
[1:01:04] brave you better stand be brave and
[1:01:07] gainst all evil right that's always sing
[1:01:09] glory because cowards turn their back
[1:01:13] for fighting and contending and
[1:01:15] believing for Christ they turn their
[1:01:17] back on that and they retreat from the
[1:01:20] war right that we're called to the
[1:01:22] battle that were called to what did Paul
[1:01:24] say he said I fought the good fight of
[1:01:27] faith I didn't retreat I didn't give up
[1:01:28] fighting I fought the good fight so
[1:01:32] that's the illustration that we see with
[1:01:34] salvation it's a fight right God gives
[1:01:38] it to us but we got to fight for it like
[1:01:40] the promised land
[1:01:41] lay hold on eternal life whereunto thou
[1:01:44] art also called and as profess a good
[1:01:47] profession before many witnesses Jude
[1:01:51] 1:3 says beloved when I gave all
[1:01:54] diligence to write unto you of the
[1:01:55] common salvation it was needful for me
[1:01:58] to write unto you and exhort you that ye
[1:01:59] should earnestly contend or fight
[1:02:02] strongly for the faith which was once
[1:02:04] delivered to the Saints so when you see
[1:02:07] salvation you so fall in love with God
[1:02:10] that you want to fight against God's
[1:02:11] enemy does everybody see that but those
[1:02:15] who are lost say well oh I want it's
[1:02:18] okay for me to live in sin and I want to
[1:02:20] live in sin I want
[1:02:21] enjoy the pleasure of the world so
[1:02:22] instead of fighting for God and fighting
[1:02:24] for Christ
[1:02:25] they actually retreat from from Christ
[1:02:27] and they go to the devil side we say
[1:02:30] here's another illustration Israel
[1:02:35] Israel leaving the Egypt but not
[1:02:38] possessing the promised land that's
[1:02:39] another illustration so the illustration
[1:02:45] is journey to the promised land it's the
[1:02:47] make believers or the mixed multitude
[1:02:48] that came out in Exodus 12 38 Jude says
[1:02:53] for there are certain men crept in
[1:02:55] unawares who were before of old ordained
[1:02:57] to this condemnation ungodly men turning
[1:03:00] the grace of our God into lawlessness
[1:03:03] right lasciviousness live any way you
[1:03:04] want you're under grace and denying the
[1:03:08] only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:11] I will therefore put you in remembrance
[1:03:13] though you once knew this how that the
[1:03:16] Lord having say the people I land of
[1:03:19] Egypt afterward destroyed them that
[1:03:21] believe not right why do you destroy
[1:03:25] them because they drew back instead of
[1:03:27] like Joshua and Caleb saying we can take
[1:03:29] the land we can possess the land God is
[1:03:31] with us God loves us God will help us to
[1:03:34] defeat our enemies how many feel that
[1:03:36] way tonight God will help me to feed my
[1:03:37] enemy amen God will help me overcome I'm
[1:03:40] more than able not me but because God's
[1:03:42] with me amen if I keep the Word of God
[1:03:44] there doesn't have to be a Red Cross in
[1:03:46] this camp in this church like Graham
[1:03:48] said we have to have a hospital in this
[1:03:50] church no one's going to get hurt if we
[1:03:52] just keep the loving words of our Savior
[1:03:54] amen
[1:03:54] that's the illustration for salvation
[1:03:57] they draw back and say we can do it I
[1:04:00] can't overcome smoking and drinking I
[1:04:02] can't overcome lust and I can overcome
[1:04:04] this and so they stopped fighting the
[1:04:06] good fight of faith and they draw back
[1:04:09] they're cowards and they are be brave
[1:04:11] and say I can do this because I can do
[1:04:13] all things through Christ who's in me
[1:04:15] but maybe Christ isn't in them because
[1:04:18] they're not they're not hungry for God
[1:04:19] they're not grateful they haven't that
[1:04:22] they sold out the faith or something
[1:04:24] like that right now I just thought I'd
[1:04:26] drop this in here because whether Ram
[1:04:29] brings this thought out and it deals
[1:04:32] with attitude like brother Craig
[1:04:33] preached on Sunday
[1:04:35] attitude our attitude and I want to look
[1:04:37] at our attitude just towards being saved
[1:04:39] and just being just coming to church and
[1:04:42] our attitude towards the house of God
[1:04:43] and and loving God I want you to see
[1:04:45] what brother Branham talks about this
[1:04:46] now the illustration is that Israel came
[1:04:50] out of Egypt but most of them didn't
[1:04:52] make the promise then we know that and
[1:04:54] numbers 21 said the people spake against
[1:04:57] God and against Moses wherefore have you
[1:04:59] brought us up out of Egypt to die in the
[1:05:01] wilderness
[1:05:02] for there is no bread neither is there
[1:05:04] any water and our soul oh this is like
[1:05:06] bread now wants to notice did they have
[1:05:09] bread yes they were just tired of God's
[1:05:12] bread can buddy see that they had God's
[1:05:16] bread but they just got tired of it what
[1:05:19] was wrong their attitude praise the Lord
[1:05:22] or their taste buds they're a little bit
[1:05:24] picky a little bit complacent the the
[1:05:28] bread that they once loved that was the
[1:05:31] answer their prayer is now common ly
[1:05:33] used to love it
[1:05:34] now it's common I've had it so many
[1:05:35] times I just can't we gotta have
[1:05:37] something else and the Bible said they
[1:05:40] hated this light angel bread this angel
[1:05:42] bread and the Lord swore the Lord do Oh
[1:05:45] bless your hearts you didn't mean that
[1:05:47] no he actually chasing them he sent
[1:05:50] fiery serpents among the people they bit
[1:05:52] the people much people of Israel died
[1:05:54] and then they repented after this and
[1:05:56] verse 7 they repented and God forgave
[1:05:58] them so in other words when we complain
[1:06:01] about what God has called us to do when
[1:06:03] we complain about our situation
[1:06:05] God might give us a little spankin God
[1:06:07] may God give us a little correction but
[1:06:10] we got to come back and say I'm sorry I
[1:06:11] got to change my attitude so brother
[1:06:14] here's what brother Aaron says about
[1:06:15] loathing this light bread program
[1:06:17] compares it to coming to church and I'm
[1:06:20] not making this up that you can really
[1:06:21] listen this but man said then in their
[1:06:25] chatting well we wish we were back in
[1:06:26] Egypt our souls loathe this light bread
[1:06:28] in other words if I take it historically
[1:06:31] now that's what they said now in the
[1:06:33] modern day this would be oh every
[1:06:35] Wednesday night prayer meeting every
[1:06:37] Sunday morning back to church what do we
[1:06:39] hear the same thing the preacher stand
[1:06:41] up and preach songs he said go on back
[1:06:46] so what does a prophet
[1:06:48] how does the Prophet try to relate
[1:06:50] loathing your light bread to come into
[1:06:52] church and getting tired of coming to
[1:06:53] church just the same thing see that
[1:06:56] complaining attitude right how many
[1:07:00] believe it was a prophet how many
[1:07:02] believe you know what he's talking about
[1:07:03] see then you're just going line-of-duty
[1:07:06] see it's no longer love now it's lost
[1:07:10] your love you're not a worshipper then a
[1:07:12] worshipper goes there to worship to
[1:07:15] express himself before his God to praise
[1:07:17] God for His goodness to every word he
[1:07:20] hangs on to it remember I was I'm gonna
[1:07:25] do my next video after a revelation I'm
[1:07:27] gonna do my next video on Ty's money and
[1:07:29] the Bible and God told those men he said
[1:07:33] when you come to church you got to come
[1:07:34] three times a year
[1:07:35] think about that only come to church
[1:07:37] three times a year we wouldn't get very
[1:07:39] close to God would we we get tired we
[1:07:40] get lazy right we all do it right but he
[1:07:44] said you come three times and he said
[1:07:46] don't come empty he said bring something
[1:07:50] with you now think about that is that
[1:07:52] how we come today I come here with
[1:07:55] something in my heart to give to Jesus
[1:07:57] Christ did you come that way today
[1:07:59] my RAM said if we just come and complain
[1:08:02] about coming to church he said that
[1:08:03] we're not worshiping the right way our
[1:08:05] attitude has to be I'm coming to bring
[1:08:07] Jesus praise tonight for whatever he
[1:08:10] gave me a week of work he provided for
[1:08:12] my needs he gave me this sir he's on
[1:08:14] this he died for me amen if you have
[1:08:16] nothing else he died for you praise God
[1:08:18] if you've lost all your natural
[1:08:20] blessings in your job you can say truly
[1:08:23] the Lord gives and the Lord takes away
[1:08:25] he could say blessed be the name of the
[1:08:26] Lord amen he gave me salvation through
[1:08:28] Jesus Christ so that's how brother
[1:08:31] branham relates people complaining oh
[1:08:33] another Wednesday night service all's we
[1:08:36] do is sing and pray and this isn't here
[1:08:38] preaching again another Sunday service
[1:08:40] be careful Church just be careful
[1:08:43] spiritual Israel you don't want to
[1:08:46] loathe the bread of God but see a real
[1:08:48] worshiper hangs on to every word I'm
[1:08:50] gonna need this now listen church
[1:08:52] someone might need this tomorrow you're
[1:08:54] gonna talk to they might be so
[1:08:56] discouraged and you might be the vessel
[1:08:58] God's gonna use to bring that to them
[1:09:00] right like on Sunday
[1:09:04] Monday we had a guy work come and put
[1:09:06] some windows in for us and I was so
[1:09:08] stirred up from Sunday I had a word just
[1:09:10] a witness to him I got the witness to
[1:09:11] him he never called me back I gave my
[1:09:13] car and everything like that but I was
[1:09:14] just so stirred up I said are you a
[1:09:16] Christian and I started telling my I
[1:09:17] said I'm a Jesus fanatic you know I'd go
[1:09:20] to church three times a week and we love
[1:09:21] the Lord and jesus healed my amount of
[1:09:23] cancer and it was just flowing out see
[1:09:26] because I had something to give the word
[1:09:28] that I heard had impacted me and I want
[1:09:30] to give it out to somebody and that's
[1:09:33] what we have to be so I'm saying the
[1:09:34] word tonight well it might be something
[1:09:36] you need for tomorrow how about when
[1:09:39] Satan tries to discourage you tomorrow
[1:09:40] what can you say I'm not saved by my
[1:09:42] works I want to do better Christ will
[1:09:44] help me do better I'm saved by grace I
[1:09:47] am going to heaven because he freely
[1:09:49] gave me the ticket to heaven praise God
[1:09:52] I believe in Christ he freely gave me
[1:09:55] freely justified me I'm justifying the
[1:09:57] sight of God amen
[1:10:00] bromance is just like a love affair so
[1:10:02] he compares coming to church as the love
[1:10:04] affair if you was going with the girls
[1:10:07] who talks about a boy courting a girl
[1:10:09] because you knew it was a duty or you're
[1:10:11] going with the boy when you were young
[1:10:13] mama wants me to go with this guy but I
[1:10:14] just can't stand them imagine a arranged
[1:10:18] marriage aren't you glad you don't have
[1:10:19] arranged marriages it's what if you
[1:10:21] really didn't like that person that's
[1:10:23] her brother Brahim says that's what he
[1:10:24] compares about your attitude to coming
[1:10:25] to church well I guess I got to go to
[1:10:27] church he that's like a girl this is
[1:10:29] when I guess I got a date this guy I
[1:10:30] guess I got a court this guy I don't
[1:10:32] really like him he said you don't get
[1:10:36] nothing from him you don't get nothing
[1:10:38] of him coming to see you why does this
[1:10:40] guy keep coming to see me why is this
[1:10:41] why do I keep coming to see this girl my
[1:10:43] mom wants me to come date this girl or
[1:10:45] be with this girl he said that's your
[1:10:48] attitude you go with her but she bores
[1:10:52] you mama wants you to go with her
[1:10:54] because she's the type of girl that mama
[1:10:56] likes see it bores you there's no love
[1:11:00] affair but you don't care you don't want
[1:11:03] to clean up you don't want to go see her
[1:11:05] why it's a horrible thing and when he's
[1:11:07] coming to see him I just wish he'd hurry
[1:11:08] and go home that's not how I was with my
[1:11:12] wife I I took a shower you know before I
[1:11:15] go see my wife you know
[1:11:17] comb my hair I got my nicest shirt on
[1:11:19] sprayed some Cologne on I wanted to
[1:11:23] impress her I want to know that I cared
[1:11:25] about her I was in love with her that's
[1:11:28] the same way it is with you why does he
[1:11:34] preach so long because that's when I go
[1:11:41] this with what I battle all the time
[1:11:42] right
[1:11:43] as a preacher why does he gotta preach
[1:11:45] so long again tonight that means you're
[1:11:49] not in love with me or you're not in
[1:11:50] love with Christ but brother Han says
[1:11:53] you need to be in love with the Christ
[1:11:54] inside of the person well Jessie might
[1:11:58] have some problems I might
[1:11:59] I must i-i've said inside but you should
[1:12:01] still love the Christ inside of me see
[1:12:05] so same thing getting ready to be
[1:12:08] married coming to church same thing and
[1:12:12] I'm not making this up listen to this
[1:12:14] tonight it's 1961 July 23rd he said see
[1:12:18] you're not loved what about all this
[1:12:20] stuff you see but when you really hang
[1:12:22] on to every word as the spirit gave you
[1:12:24] warning this morning hanging on every
[1:12:26] word that might be what he's has been
[1:12:29] talking to you about holding on its
[1:12:31] eternal life every word of God it's a
[1:12:34] joy to go to church this and under any
[1:12:37] circumstance if we could just see that
[1:12:40] church I think it'd help our attitudes
[1:12:41] wouldn't it if we could see every time I
[1:12:44] go to church it's a joy
[1:12:45] I remember brother Ram said he never
[1:12:46] went to church and regretted one time he
[1:12:49] never left saying oh I knew I should not
[1:12:52] I went you know because it's not between
[1:12:55] him and the people it's between him and
[1:12:57] God right in other words his love he
[1:13:00] loved the people but his main love was
[1:13:01] he's going there to see Christ and to
[1:13:04] hang on every word for eternal life amen
[1:13:09] see it's a joy to go to church under any
[1:13:12] circumstance whether it's hot cold
[1:13:14] indifferent whether people are fussing
[1:13:16] growling whatever they're doing it's
[1:13:18] still a joy to hear the word of the Lord
[1:13:19] then you're in love with Christ and you
[1:13:23] love to go to church well honey here at
[1:13:26] Sunday morning again I guess we have to
[1:13:27] wash up the young ones and get down
[1:13:28] there my it's bore 'some he said
[1:13:30] you're not loved but if you really love
[1:13:34] you just can't wait til Sunday morning
[1:13:35] comes and you've got to get down there
[1:13:37] with them and we get and we leave the
[1:13:40] people of God they don't bore you why
[1:13:42] they're brothers and sisters as I used
[1:13:44] to say you get as thick as sorghum
[1:13:46] molasses on a cold morning it don't run
[1:13:49] it just stays together you know clings
[1:13:51] tight now that's a rude expression but
[1:13:53] it's trying to let you know what I mean
[1:13:54] you see you stick together the colder
[1:13:56] gets the tighter they stick that's the
[1:13:59] way it ought to be with us the harder it
[1:14:03] gets as the years go on the more we
[1:14:05] should stick together right because
[1:14:07] we're the family of God and here's where
[1:14:09] he says that and what we love is each
[1:14:11] other it's not because that we're
[1:14:14] somebody because it's the Christ in one
[1:14:17] another that we love I love the Christ
[1:14:20] in you you should love the Christ in me
[1:14:21] right and not complain about what's
[1:14:24] going on right if something's wrong it's
[1:14:27] called talk to the person correct it if
[1:14:28] not hang on every word and try to see
[1:14:31] what Christ is trying to get you to see
[1:14:32] tonight that's right weatherman talks
[1:14:38] about how we should have the church
[1:14:40] atmosphere well Graham said I travel
[1:14:42] around the world a lot this is from
[1:14:44] Israel the church 1953 and the stickiest
[1:14:48] nastiest places the lay down is in the
[1:14:50] desert everything there has got a
[1:14:52] sticker on it you know why every kind of
[1:14:54] little old weeds a cactus you can't lay
[1:14:56] down know where it's sticking you the
[1:14:58] reason of it is then don't got no water
[1:14:59] water makes it soft where there's lots
[1:15:02] of waters you don't have any thorns and
[1:15:04] thistles
[1:15:05] where there's lots of water and I tell
[1:15:07] you brother you take an old church
[1:15:08] that's dry this bone and no Holy Ghost
[1:15:10] in it and no salvation no divine healing
[1:15:13] no power of God no shouting no joy and
[1:15:16] it's always this oh she did this and he
[1:15:18] done that and he then this sticker
[1:15:19] sticker sticker see when people are
[1:15:23] complaining well add them to this and
[1:15:25] Lydia did that and brother Jesse to that
[1:15:27] when people are complaining about one
[1:15:29] another there's no real joy there's
[1:15:31] God's Spirit can't move there's no water
[1:15:34] there right but we need water we need
[1:15:37] rain to pour out on us tonight Amen
[1:15:39] that's right what you need is a good
[1:15:43] old-fashioned out
[1:15:44] a gusher of the Holy Ghost to soften up
[1:15:47] a little bit in other words to love
[1:15:48] people a little bit love them that means
[1:15:52] so be it but now look brother branham
[1:15:55] Tabernacle needs a good dose of that -
[1:15:57] that's right so look he tells the church
[1:15:59] that he's pastor we need a dose of that
[1:16:00] what if I said we need a dose of a Holy
[1:16:03] Ghost gusher in here would you agree
[1:16:05] well would you pray for that so let's
[1:16:10] see it's a pass or telling the church we
[1:16:12] need the water of God we need the Holy
[1:16:14] Spirit we need some salvation in here
[1:16:16] amen we need some we use some Holy Ghost

[1:16:41] people left but I can still have joy
[1:16:43] even when people leave because I've got
[1:16:45] salvation glory you have salvation we
[1:16:49] can even if people leave and they don't
[1:16:50] receive it or they fall away or their
[1:16:52] ground is stony or their ground is full
[1:16:55] of thorns we can still have joy in our
[1:16:58] salvation and we can still pray and
[1:17:00] intercede for them because remember you
[1:17:01] are a priest you are supposed to
[1:17:03] intercede for them I did talk to one of
[1:17:07] the brothers have left I talked to his
[1:17:08] mother this week so keep them in prayer
[1:17:10] they're going through some hard times
[1:17:11] keep them in prayer by God's grace but

[1:17:43] not be happy about that how can we know
[1:17:46] that we even baptized the right way

[1:17:50] titles we even baptize the right way and

[1:18:31] can I know what I know and not be happy
[1:18:33] tonight amen that's beautiful church
[1:18:37] that's beautiful just getting back to
[1:18:39] the joy of our salvation mmm salvation
[1:18:44] is by faith it's a revelation right we
[1:18:46] said this earlier I'm not ashamed the
[1:18:50] gospel it's the power of God t that
[1:18:54] believeth for therein is the
[1:18:55] righteousness of God revealed from faith
[1:18:57] to faith the preaching of the word the
[1:19:00] gospel the good news Christ is here to
[1:19:03] save us Christ here to fill us Christ is
[1:19:05] here to heal us to give us joy he was
[1:19:07] victory that good news is revealed to us
[1:19:12] through the preaching right and that
[1:19:14] brings a righteousness to us and it goes
[1:19:17] from faith to the next revelation from
[1:19:19] the first revelation to the next
[1:19:21] revelation to the next revelation as it
[1:19:24] is written the just shall live by faith
[1:19:26] how many hungry for another revelation
[1:19:28] brother Ram said the thing you pray for
[1:19:30] the most is what revelation which is
[1:19:32] faith how many need a how many need a
[1:19:35] fresh vision from the Lord I mean a
[1:19:37] fresh revelation of am I gonna be healed
[1:19:39] or is this person gonna be saved
[1:19:42] we should that's why we come to hear the
[1:19:44] word of God so we can go from faith to
[1:19:46] the next faith to the next revelation to
[1:19:49] the next understanding that's how we
[1:19:51] approach the Lord so now I added I added
[1:19:56] just a few words here faith in Christ
[1:19:58] blood this is the only righteousness at
[1:20:01] church is Christ's righteousness praise
[1:20:04] the Lord we still have crises our
[1:20:06] defense we've got the law we're guilty
[1:20:09] of the law but we've got a cover for the
[1:20:11] look
[1:20:11] our selves Christ is our cover Christ is
[1:20:14] our cover
[1:20:16] but the only thing righteous about this
[1:20:20] place is Christ Jesus hey man
[1:20:23] and then God will speak to us if we come
[1:20:26] that way
[1:20:27] hallelujah hey men first Peter 2:24 said
[1:20:31] who his own self bare our sins in his
[1:20:34] own body on the tree that we being dead
[1:20:38] to sins should live unto righteousness
[1:20:41] to see if Christ is our righteousness
[1:20:44] and we should try to live righteous by
[1:20:47] whose stripes you were healed so Christ
[1:20:49] bore our sin so we should and will live
[1:20:53] unto righteousness the word righteous
[1:20:56] here I believe the right meeting there's
[1:20:58] three me I'm sorry one two there's four
[1:21:00] meetings I believe it's this one we
[1:21:01] should live unto righteousness in
[1:21:03] tegrity virtue we should have strength
[1:21:06] with virtue means strength purity of
[1:21:08] life rightness correctness of thinking
[1:21:11] feeling and acting we should live if we
[1:21:14] have Christ's righteousness we should
[1:21:15] live a righteous life we should have a
[1:21:17] strenght strong life a life of integrity
[1:21:20] little children let no man deceive you
[1:21:22] he that doeth righteousness is righteous
[1:21:26] even as he is righteous amen and Simon
[1:21:30] Peter answered and said thou art the
[1:21:31] Christ of Son Living God and Jesus
[1:21:33] answering said him blessed art thou
[1:21:35] simon barjona
[1:21:36] for flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[1:21:38] unto thee but my father so faith was a
[1:21:41] revelation he same into that faith was a
[1:21:44] revelation
[1:21:45] we have no works that justify us before
[1:21:50] God Galatians 3:10 tells us this for as
[1:21:54] many as are of the works of the law are
[1:21:56] under the curse for it is written cursed
[1:21:59] is every one that continueth not in all
[1:22:01] things which are written in the book of
[1:22:03] the law to do them
[1:22:05] but that no man is justified by the law
[1:22:08] in the sight of God it is evident or
[1:22:11] it's some clear no man is justified by
[1:22:13] the law but works for the Josh I live by
[1:22:16] faith hey hey man we live by faith
[1:22:20] substance inside of us we live by that
[1:22:24] praise the Lord Romans 4:3 for what
[1:22:28] saith the scripture abraham believed God
[1:22:30] and it was counted unto him for
[1:22:32] righteousness just just by believing he
[1:22:34] believed what God said God made him
[1:22:36] righteous now to him that worketh is the
[1:22:39] reward not reckoned of grace but of debt
[1:22:43] but to him that worketh not but
[1:22:45] believeth on him that justifieth the
[1:22:47] ungodly his faith is counted for
[1:22:50] righteousness so can I use a quick
[1:22:52] illustration here the thief on the cross
[1:22:54] here's the scripture about the thief on
[1:22:56] the cross they just use a quick quick
[1:22:57] quick illustration he was a murdering
[1:23:01] thief is everybody understand that
[1:23:02] that's why he was dying that's why he
[1:23:04] was crucified he was a murderous thief
[1:23:06] right so yeah and the Bible said no man
[1:23:09] that murders has eternal life so he
[1:23:11] didn't have eternal life he was a
[1:23:12] murderer but Jesus gave him salvation
[1:23:16] and justified him just by his attitude
[1:23:19] that's what brother Craig was preaching
[1:23:20] that's a brother branham's preaching
[1:23:21] just your attitude determines your
[1:23:23] eternal destination right your attitude
[1:23:26] towards the gospel well so what was his
[1:23:29] attitude he rebukes the man that's
[1:23:33] rebuking Jesus and says don't you fear
[1:23:35] God seeing thou are in the same
[1:23:38] condemnation so what did he have Church
[1:23:41] he had fear of the Lord and fear the
[1:23:43] Lord is the beginning of wisdom so see
[1:23:44] he had the first step to being wise he
[1:23:47] had fear of God don't you fear God and
[1:23:50] we indeed justly so we deserve this for
[1:23:53] we receive the due reward of our deeds
[1:23:54] but this man had done nothing amiss so
[1:23:57] he feared God and he also recognized
[1:24:00] that God's servant was a true servant
[1:24:02] he's done nothing wrong
[1:24:04] he considered his sacrifice a righteous
[1:24:06] sacrifice right a pure sacrifice he's
[1:24:09] pure I'm impure how many can say that
[1:24:11] tonight I'm impure but Christ is pure
[1:24:14] amen I do things that are impure and of
[1:24:17] course when I confess them yes then my
[1:24:19] mind is pure yelling and there's no
[1:24:21] accusations against me in heaven but
[1:24:22] overall we do impure things but Christ
[1:24:25] is always pure amen and so and he said
[1:24:32] unto Jesus Lord so look even calls him
[1:24:34] Lord you're my ruler
[1:24:35] Jesus is my ruler I fear God
[1:24:38] Jesus is perfect hey men he's my Lord
[1:24:42] and he gives a simple request remember
[1:24:45] me when you come into your kingdom how
[1:24:48] many want Christ to remember that may
[1:24:49] men I always wanted to remember my
[1:24:50] prayers remember my my love for him
[1:24:54] remember me Jesus and without coming
[1:24:57] into thy kingdom and Jesus said unto him
[1:24:59] in a matter of minutes
[1:25:01] verily I say in you today thou shalt be
[1:25:04] with me in paradise praise God how is
[1:25:09] this man justified was it his works
[1:25:11] all's he did was look at the blood of
[1:25:13] Jesus and say this man is perfect I fear
[1:25:17] God right he says remember me when you
[1:25:20] come into your kingdom
[1:25:21] you're pure you're the word I'm guilty
[1:25:24] and Jesus said you're saying Amen you're
[1:25:27] justified hallelujah because your
[1:25:30] attitude towards the word was the right
[1:25:32] attitude aren't you thankful for the
[1:25:34] Word of God amen this gives us such
[1:25:37] great hope see we we become the
[1:25:42] righteousness of God when we're
[1:25:44] believing in Christ we become his
[1:25:47] righteousness free I've made him to be
[1:25:49] sin for us who knew no sin that we might
[1:25:52] be made the righteousness of God in him
[1:25:57] see we've got to be in Christ we got to
[1:25:59] have faith in Christ and then we become
[1:26:02] the righteousness of God when we're
[1:26:04] believing in Christ and this was seen on
[1:26:07] the day of atonement remember the day of
[1:26:09] atonement Aaron had to lay both his
[1:26:11] hands on the the goat the live goat in
[1:26:15] this case not the scapegoat but the live
[1:26:16] goat and when he laid his hands on him
[1:26:19] he confessed all the knick Matiz of the
[1:26:21] children of Israel and all their
[1:26:23] transgressions and all their sins and
[1:26:25] they're put on the head of that goat
[1:26:27] right david Tolman remember this was
[1:26:31] this was on top of all the other
[1:26:34] sacrifices they had knew right so if the
[1:26:37] Jewish priest rabbi was reading this the
[1:26:39] Torah and he said you've done this sin
[1:26:42] you have to do this sacrifice they had
[1:26:44] to go to that sacrifice but once a year
[1:26:47] God said if you miss any sins I'm gonna
[1:26:50] put it all on this goat right here
[1:26:52] if you've forgotten to make any sins and
[1:26:55] Church how many of us forget sometimes
[1:26:56] they do think we should do we forget we
[1:26:59] forget to make this rider forget to do
[1:27:01] that so God said because of that I'm
[1:27:03] gonna take one day and I'm gonna put all
[1:27:05] the sins of everybody on this one goat
[1:27:08] and the Bible said they kill the goat
[1:27:12] now I'm skipping verse 29 but it says
[1:27:14] for on that day show the priests make an
[1:27:16] atonement for you to cleanse you that
[1:27:18] you may be clean from all your sins
[1:27:20] before God so God foreshadow this all
[1:27:24] the sins of the sin all those sins of
[1:27:26] the people were on the live goat that
[1:27:28] would be killed and then the people were
[1:27:31] then righteous how many thankful that
[1:27:34] all your sins were placed upon Christ
[1:27:36] are you thankful for that tonight amen
[1:27:38] and now you are righteous you are clean
[1:27:42] through what he did
[1:27:44] are you living my faith tonight the just
[1:27:46] shall live by faith tonight amen
[1:27:50] when are we made the righteousness of
[1:27:53] God when we have faith or believe as
[1:27:56] soon as you believe the Bible said God
[1:27:59] imputes it to you for righteousness
[1:28:01] right and the scripture is Romans 4 with
[1:28:07] with Abraham come with this blessing us
[1:28:10] upon them the circumcision only or upon
[1:28:13] the uncircumcision only for we say that
[1:28:15] faith was reckoned or imputed to Abraham
[1:28:17] for righteousness how was it then
[1:28:22] reckoned how was it given to Abraham
[1:28:23] when he was in circumcision or
[1:28:25] uncircumcision not in circumcision but
[1:28:28] in uncircumcision
[1:28:29] we know that when was Abraham righteous
[1:28:33] was that once he got circumcised and got
[1:28:36] the token or was it when he first
[1:28:37] believed the Bible said when he first
[1:28:39] believed he was already righteous before
[1:28:43] in other words before he got the baptism
[1:28:45] the Holy Ghost
[1:28:45] he was already righteous in the sight of
[1:28:47] God Amen that ought to be an
[1:28:51] encouragement and he received the sign
[1:28:53] of circumcision which is the type of the
[1:28:55] Holy Ghost a seal see a type of the Holy
[1:28:57] Ghost a seal a seal the righteousness of
[1:29:01] the faith which he had yet being
[1:29:02] uncircumcised that he might be the
[1:29:05] father of all them that
[1:29:06] though they be not circumcised that
[1:29:08] righteousness might be imputed unto them
[1:29:11] also and the father of circumcision to
[1:29:15] them who are not of the circumcision
[1:29:17] only but who also walk in the steps of
[1:29:19] that faith of our father Abraham which
[1:29:23] he had yet being uncircumcised okay hope
[1:29:29] everybody can see this I didn't I should
[1:29:30] have put a picture of this up there but
[1:29:33] abraham believed God so when God called
[1:29:36] him and he believed now he's righteous
[1:29:38] in the sight of God he became the
[1:29:39] righteousness of God he was a righteous
[1:29:41] person it wasn't when he got circumsized
[1:29:44] a few years later and got the token it
[1:29:47] was as soon as he believed so for us
[1:29:50] that means we are righteous in the sight
[1:29:52] of God as soon as we repent me baptize
[1:29:55] and as soon as we believe were righteous
[1:29:58] how many understand that by God's grace
[1:30:00] we are righteous and God recognizes that
[1:30:04] before you're born again because look
[1:30:09] what I said about lot the Bible said and
[1:30:10] delivered just lot justified yet he was
[1:30:15] vexed with the filthy conversation of
[1:30:17] the wicked for that righteous man
[1:30:19] dwelling among them and seeing and
[1:30:21] hearing vexed his righteous soul from
[1:30:22] day to day with her unlawfully deeds
[1:30:26] so here's lot living among homosexuality
[1:30:29] and God said he was already righteous
[1:30:32] because he believed God did he live as
[1:30:35] high as Abraham not even close but did
[1:30:38] God forgive him and it was he saved he
[1:30:41] was saved so remember I preached this
[1:30:46] back in November of 2016 the foolish
[1:30:48] versions are saved but there's going to
[1:30:50] be few of them they're gonna be safe
[1:30:53] what's the word foolish mean it means
[1:30:55] foolish and pious or godless now it's
[1:30:57] not godless because they do have God
[1:30:58] working in their lives but they're
[1:31:00] foolish they don't take the time to get
[1:31:02] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:31:04] what's a virgin mean there's two
[1:31:06] definitions this is the one that works
[1:31:08] for us best because spiritually we're
[1:31:11] kind of foolish virgin a man who has
[1:31:13] abstain from all uncleanness and
[1:31:15] whoredom attendant on idolatry has kept
[1:31:19] his chastity
[1:31:20] one who has never had relations with
[1:31:21] women but we're looking at the spiritual
[1:31:23] foolish virgin they don't have any
[1:31:26] uncleanness or any idolatry they just
[1:31:29] never got borned again program said
[1:31:31] virgin means purity they were all good
[1:31:34] people every one of them burgeoned
[1:31:36] sanctified vessels of god he calls them
[1:31:39] but those who had oil in their lamps
[1:31:41] went in and the others was left out they
[1:31:43] were all virgins everyone people that
[1:31:46] you couldn't put your finger on for
[1:31:48] anything wrong look at that church look
[1:31:51] at that then they they everyone believe
[1:31:55] in the coming of the Lord they are ready
[1:31:57] to go meet him but some of them let
[1:31:59] their oil go out my butt man and said
[1:32:05] don't let that be your case don't let
[1:32:06] your oil go out keep oil in your lamp
[1:32:10] oil is the spirit the Holy Spirit never
[1:32:12] let it drain from you when you feel your
[1:32:14] love dying away your sincerity to Christ
[1:32:16] and to the cause quickly go to him who
[1:32:19] has the fountain of oil and buy for
[1:32:20] yourself a filling of the Holy Spirit
[1:32:23] hallelujah you see that by God's grace
[1:32:26] a foolish version is pure to everything
[1:32:31] you know he said you can't put a finger
[1:32:33] and say at work he compromised at work I
[1:32:36] got him there you can't put a finger on
[1:32:38] it
[1:32:38] oh he compromised at church I put it I
[1:32:40] got him there at church I put his thing
[1:32:42] oh there at home he come for my ice at
[1:32:45] home you can't put your finger on him
[1:32:47] that's how close they're living to God
[1:32:49] how many believe that honey bee program
[1:32:51] said that my program said the sleeping
[1:32:57] version that went out to meet the
[1:32:59] bridegroom they let the oil gather lamp
[1:33:01] they never entered into this the baptism
[1:33:04] Holy Ghost they never let Christ take
[1:33:06] control so he could work miracles and
[1:33:08] speak with tongues and do wonders and
[1:33:11] things to prove that he lived in his
[1:33:13] church honey want Christ to take control
[1:33:15] oh we should all desire that Christ take
[1:33:20] full control of my life take full
[1:33:21] control of me tonight
[1:33:22] every night so you can manifest yourself
[1:33:25] and me to your glory
[1:33:26] the foolish version doesn't do this they
[1:33:29] don't give Christ all the control in
[1:33:31] their lives we got to give him all the
[1:33:33] control of our lives
[1:33:34] amen now look about and says here this
[1:33:37] is questions and answers he's talking
[1:33:39] about at the time of the tribulation the
[1:33:41] Gentile bride is in heaven the sleeping
[1:33:44] version the Gentile virgin is not to be
[1:33:46] saved during that time she's already
[1:33:48] been saved but she's been rejected in
[1:33:51] the bride so the reason I read that is
[1:33:54] that so you know there are people
[1:33:56] walking around in the nomination today
[1:33:58] and also message churches that are saved
[1:34:02] but they're not born again but they are
[1:34:04] righteous in the sight of God amen
[1:34:08] they're justified in the sight of God
[1:34:11] because God justifies them as soon as
[1:34:14] they believe and as long as they're
[1:34:16] living all that they know then they are
[1:34:18] a virgin to the word aren't you glad
[1:34:20] they're pure to the word honey want to
[1:34:22] be pure to every word that no matter
[1:34:24] what's being preached to me when Craig's
[1:34:26] preaching in her brother cam wherever
[1:34:28] that when I hear I'm pure to that and I
[1:34:30] say yes Lord I want to live that or I
[1:34:32] believe that I want to be pure to every
[1:34:35] word of God amen
[1:34:37] remember said the first virgin she's
[1:34:39] already saved see because as soon as
[1:34:42] they believe just like Abraham they're
[1:34:44] already righteous they're righteous
[1:34:47] because the Bible said God gives them
[1:34:49] faith and when they have faith are
[1:34:51] trusting in the blood Jesus Christ their
[1:34:52] righteous brother Graham goes on to say
[1:34:57] this now look she's not saved during
[1:35:01] that time the tribulation she's saved
[1:35:03] now from the eternal death
[1:35:05] so the booze version is not saved from
[1:35:07] going through the tribulation but she is
[1:35:10] saved from the lake of fire can I say
[1:35:12] like that they were under sin that I
[1:35:15] just want to make sure you see that the
[1:35:18] foolish version walks around saying I
[1:35:20] believe the foolish version a lot of
[1:35:21] them since there's very few of them I
[1:35:23] believe a lot of them are in the message
[1:35:24] churches that's hard to say because
[1:35:26] there are so many people and in churches
[1:35:27] but you have to live all the word you
[1:35:30] have to love God so much that you live
[1:35:31] everything that he tells you most people
[1:35:35] have turned their back on the word right
[1:35:37] they go to church but when the word says
[1:35:39] this they turn their back on it or so
[1:35:40] most of the preachers the preachers turn
[1:35:42] their back on the word and they won't
[1:35:43] preach the word the truer to the people
[1:35:45] so that's hurting the people
[1:35:48] we don't hurt the people we want to save
[1:35:49] the people praise God we want to help
[1:35:51] the people we want to preach the for
[1:35:53] word of God
[1:35:54] [Music]
[1:35:57] alright I'm gonna skip past that quote
[1:35:59] yeah here brother have said they're just
[1:36:01] gonna be a few of them go in a few
[1:36:03] foolish version we know that as was the
[1:36:05] days of Noah eight souls were saved so
[1:36:07] shopping the coming of the Son of Man
[1:36:08] there's just a few soul saved I don't
[1:36:10] say eight might be eight hundred I don't
[1:36:13] know how many eight thousand I don't
[1:36:14] know might be eight million so look it's
[1:36:17] gonna be a small number compared to the
[1:36:19] number that are lost
[1:36:20] very few people's in other words very
[1:36:23] few people love Christ so much that they
[1:36:25] want to live all the Word of God that's
[1:36:29] why we can say what seven slowly ghosts
[1:36:31] remember it's living all the word for
[1:36:33] your age that's the true evidence the
[1:36:37] proof that you're a holy ghost feel
[1:36:38] description you live all the word you
[1:36:40] love all the word for your age hey now
[1:36:43] what brother Adam say his message was he
[1:36:45] said my message is exactly today what is
[1:36:48] this message justification
[1:36:50] sanctification the baptism Holy Ghost
[1:36:55] did he leave out justification no that's
[1:36:58] still part of his message right
[1:37:01] sanctification is still part of I'm glad
[1:37:04] brother branham preach sanctification so
[1:37:06] I could be sanctified he just preached
[1:37:08] on the Holy Ghost all the time he pries
[1:37:09] justification sanctification and the
[1:37:13] baptism Holy Ghost Luther just preached
[1:37:15] basically justification but that's the
[1:37:18] message that's our message aren't you
[1:37:19] thankful for that message you thankful
[1:37:22] for that amen
[1:37:23] I got a few more here let me close I
[1:37:26] want you to see that I had all these
[1:37:28] other scriptures he had all these other
[1:37:29] scriptures I want to read through I
[1:37:31] never ever have enough time to preach
[1:37:32] all I like to preach so let's just let's
[1:37:38] just go here and we have a couple more
[1:37:40] slides now remember I've taught this and
[1:37:42] I believe this is the revelation of the
[1:37:44] hour the statue perfect man is listed
[1:37:47] over here
[1:37:47] the three works of grace are next to it
[1:37:50] side by side when a person gets
[1:37:52] justified they're righteous they receive
[1:37:55] faith right because they go from faith
[1:37:57] to faith they get baptized when they get
[1:37:59] baptized they're justified
[1:38:02] and then the Holy Spirit sanctifies them
[1:38:04] through these six works then they get
[1:38:07] the baptism Holy Ghost then in the eyes
[1:38:09] of God their holy but the Bible said
[1:38:12] they're righteous down here does
[1:38:13] everybody understand that by the grace
[1:38:14] of the Lord that's what the teaching is
[1:38:17] for our day he says my message
[1:38:18] justification same occasion the
[1:38:21] Bachelors of Holy Ghost and they said
[1:38:22] you can't be born again do you have all
[1:38:23] the virtues flowing through you you so
[1:38:25] you can't have charity until all the
[1:38:27] virtues are flowing through you O God
[1:38:29] flow through me amen Holy Spirit flow
[1:38:32] through me hallelujah in closing go to
[1:38:35] first Peter chapter
[1:38:36] I'm sorry 2nd Peter chapter one let's go
[1:38:38] there 2nd Peter chapter 1 let's look at
[1:38:42] that stature I know I know a couple
[1:38:44] months ago I into the Sermon on the
[1:38:45] statue over man but remember Peter said
[1:38:47] I'm always gonna remind you of this even
[1:38:52] after I'm dead I want you to remember
[1:38:54] the statue of a perfect man that's how
[1:38:57] important this is because if you love
[1:38:59] Christ and if you're really saved you
[1:39:01] want to go on you want God to use you
[1:39:02] and you want to go on and add more of
[1:39:05] Christ your life more of Christ more
[1:39:07] faith from faith to faith how many
[1:39:10] believe that
[1:39:10] amen glory I like that so the statue of
[1:39:15] man is just like adding from faith to
[1:39:16] faith and on now verse 3 if anybody
[1:39:31] lacks any spiritual thing in here
[1:39:32] tonight I just want to remind you that
[1:39:34] you can have it you might lack it now
[1:39:37] but you can have it praise the Lord
[1:39:40] because the Bible says right here verse
[1:39:41] 3
[1:39:41] accordin has divine power is given unto
[1:39:43] us what all things anything you're
[1:39:47] lacking all things that pertain unto
[1:39:51] life and godliness through the knowledge
[1:39:53] of him that have called us to glory and
[1:39:55] virtue so you if you're lacking some
[1:39:57] tonight stay pray and say God you
[1:39:59] promised I can have this and I'm hanging
[1:40:01] on to your promise you're gonna give it
[1:40:03] to me
[1:40:03] you said I have all things I need for
[1:40:05] godly life amen
[1:40:07] and be like Israel I'll go take the land
[1:40:09] I'll walk my way to that I'm gonna
[1:40:10] believe my way to that and God's gonna
[1:40:12] give it to me exactly right
[1:40:15] and how do you get at verse 4 by promise
[1:40:18] you've got to claim the promise you and
[1:40:20] I I have to claim the promise we all
[1:40:21] have to claim the promise for what we
[1:40:23] need
[1:40:24] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:40:25] great and precious what promises that by
[1:40:29] these can number say by these can we say
[1:40:31] that by these by what by the promises by
[1:40:35] these promises you might be partakers of
[1:40:38] the divine nature having escaped the
[1:40:40] corruption that is in the world through
[1:40:43] lust so see that you and I are not going
[1:40:45] to express divine power of God without
[1:40:48] believing God's promise hey you got to
[1:40:51] believe it you and I have to believe it
[1:40:53] I have to believe God's going to give me
[1:40:55] a victory over let's say temper or God's
[1:40:57] going to God has brought me the victory
[1:40:58] over lust or greed or arrogance or pride
[1:41:01] and if I claim that promise then God is
[1:41:05] going to allow that promise to come to
[1:41:07] come to manifestation or material in my
[1:41:10] life amen
[1:41:12] that's how I partake of divine nature
[1:41:14] through the promise of God amen
[1:41:17] verse 5 I lose my voice I'm I got to
[1:41:20] stop here in a minute
[1:41:21] mercy and beside this giving all
[1:41:23] diligence add to your faith virtue
[1:41:24] virtue knowledge and the knowledge
[1:41:26] temperance temperance patience and to
[1:41:28] patience goddess and godliness brotherly
[1:41:29] kindness and to brotherly kindness
[1:41:30] charity for if these things be in you
[1:41:33] and abound they make you that ye shall
[1:41:35] neither be barren nor unfruitful and the
[1:41:37] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ now
[1:41:42] look at verse 9 that's what I want to
[1:41:43] get to but he that lacketh these things
[1:41:45] is blind and cannot see far off and he
[1:41:47] has forgotten that he was purged from
[1:41:49] his old sin he forgot he was justified
[1:41:51] if people aren't constantly yielding to
[1:41:54] the Holy Spirit and having faith and
[1:41:56] virtue and letting all these they forget
[1:41:59] they have spiritual amnesia I forgot
[1:42:03] that I was a messege believer I forgot
[1:42:04] that I'm living the word for the hour I
[1:42:07] forgot I was even saved
[1:42:08] I forgot what how glorious my baptism
[1:42:10] was like I forgot how glorious the
[1:42:13] preaching used to feel to me
[1:42:15] they forgot and it's not God's fault
[1:42:17] it's their attitude right it's their
[1:42:20] attitude their loathing the life the
[1:42:23] bread their loathing God's bread instead
[1:42:25] of hanging on and believing every word
[1:42:27] just becomes common
[1:42:29] and usually that's why because they're
[1:42:32] flirting with Delilah they're flirting
[1:42:35] with the world they're feeding on other
[1:42:36] things so the word of gods doesn't seem
[1:42:38] as doesn't seem as exciting as it used
[1:42:41] to feel and then when that happens we
[1:42:44] get spiritual amnesia we forget what we
[1:42:46] should be and we forget we're even even
[1:42:50] justified the Bible said you forgot you
[1:42:52] were purged from your old sins you
[1:42:53] forgot you were justified
[1:42:55] forgiven for so an entrance shall be
[1:42:58] ministered under you abundantly into the
[1:42:59] everlasting kingdom of our Lord and
[1:43:01] Savior Jesus Christ amen
[1:43:03] wherefore I will not be negligent to put
[1:43:06] you always and remembers of these things
[1:43:08] Peter was always gonna remind them about
[1:43:10] the stature of man though you know them
[1:43:14] so see you've already heard it preached
[1:43:15] and be established in the present truth
[1:43:18] yeah I think at me as long as I'm in
[1:43:20] this Tabernacle to stir you up by
[1:43:22] putting you in remembrance knowing that
[1:43:24] shortly I must put off this my
[1:43:26] Tabernacle even as our Lord Jesus has
[1:43:29] showed me moreover I will endeavor that
[1:43:32] he may be able after my decease to have
[1:43:35] these things always and remembrance
[1:43:36] let's say into our feet Peter said I
[1:43:39] always want you to remember this there
[1:43:43] will be an entrance to heaven for you if
[1:43:45] you keep believing if you keep going
[1:43:47] from faith to faith from revelation to
[1:43:50] revelation hungry on every word of God
[1:43:53] feeding on every word of God rising in
[1:43:55] spiritual things amen I'm glad I want to
[1:43:58] rise in spiritual things Church I want
[1:44:00] to rise I want to grow in spiritual
[1:44:02] things so just ask yourself do we
[1:44:05] believe Luther's teaching our
[1:44:07] justification
[1:44:08] absolutely I'm saved not by my works I'm
[1:44:13] saved by the grace I'm saved by the
[1:44:16] blood of Jesus Christ it's not my blood
[1:44:19] on the mercy seat
[1:44:20] it's Christ's blood on the mercy seat
[1:44:21] it's not what I did
[1:44:23] it's what Christ did and do we feel
[1:44:26] justified tonight that's why I want you
[1:44:29] to think about for a minute let's just
[1:44:30] bow our heads here let's just take a few
[1:44:32] minutes and talk to Jesus do we feel
[1:44:35] like Christ has taken all of our sins or
[1:44:39] have we forgotten
[1:44:41] what the cross actually did have we
[1:44:44] forgotten how free it was and we don't
[1:44:47] have to work our way into it we just
[1:44:49] have to believe the promise have we
[1:44:52] forgotten these things let's take a
[1:44:54] moment and think about that with our
[1:44:59] heads bowed let's think about this here
[1:45:00] just for a moment it's worth our time
[1:45:03] it's worth any effort and any
[1:45:07] remembrance that we can put into these
[1:45:10] spiritual things it's so valuable where
[1:45:12] we have to hang on every word
[1:45:17] Heavenly Father Lord tonight we thank
[1:45:19] you for this night dear Lord we thank
[1:45:21] you for the word that we've heard the
[1:45:23] just those that are justified or
[1:45:26] righteous will live by faith hallelujah
[1:45:31] and faith is a substance

[1:45:38] Lord we thank you for the remembrance of
[1:45:40] these things Lord God as a pastor Lord I
[1:45:45] feel like it's my responsibility Lord
[1:45:47] God as Peter did to remind the people
[1:45:50] Lord that we never forget or we never
[1:45:53] get negligent we never neglect our
[1:45:55] spiritual lives because we don't want to
[1:45:58] forget how much you've done we don't
[1:46:01] want to forget the cross we don't want
[1:46:03] to forget how the blood paid the price
[1:46:05] for our sins we don't want to get
[1:46:07] prideful we don't want to get distracted
[1:46:10] we want to be forever Lord remembering
[1:46:14] what you've done for us Lord that will
[1:46:16] give us joy in the house of God that
[1:46:18] will make us hang on every word when we
[1:46:21] hit when we realized I'm not saved
[1:46:22] because I'm a preacher I'm not saying
[1:46:25] because I quit chewing tobacco I'm not
[1:46:27] saying because I did anything I'm saved
[1:46:29] by God's love by His grace for me father
