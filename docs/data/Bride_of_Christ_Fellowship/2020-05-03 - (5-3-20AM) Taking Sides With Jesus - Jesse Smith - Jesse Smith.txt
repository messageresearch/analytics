praise the Lord I'd like to uh Lord willing read a couple texts let me just say over the livestream for my wife honey if you can't hear me let me know cuz I have to use this when it doesn't work sometimes I don't know I'm not sure what happens I'm not an audio tech guy so let's uh let's read our text for today and then we'll read on the reverse ask sister Karen for a scripture so she gave us a great scripture for our text that I'd like to read acts 14:23 I like to it's kind of long the same lines of this Philippians series but I just want to just preach a few sermons on taking sides with Jesus it's programs it's basically his pattern for apostolic ministry so I just want to preach you know his apostolic vision he calls it his vision so I want to just preach on that ex 14:23 it kind of just grounds you and establishes you in the truth that we are doing exactly what the church always has done we're no different than the day of Pentecost Church we're doing the exact same thing and so that's what brother man came to do he came to point us back to the Bible back to the Apostolic fathers so let's just read acts 14:23 then when we read our memory verse from sister Karen out of Isaiah 12 but let's start with acts 14:23 okay if you're there say Amen let's read this one together here acts 14:23 one two three and when they had ordained them elders in every city and had prayed with fasting they commanded them to the Lord on whom they believed praise God now let's go to Isaiah 12 verse two just a beautiful scripture here appreciate you sharing that when sister Karen beautiful scripture about the Lord is our strength in our salvation let's sing unto the Lord praise God I stay at 12 we'll do 12 I'm sorry I was a twelve two three four and five just a beautiful portion thereof scripture okay let's read that and that's the Lord to write it on our hearts here Isaiah twelve verse two let's begin on three one two three behold god is my salvation i will trust and not be afraid for the lord jehovah is my strength and my song he also is become my salvation therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation and in that day shall ye say praise the lord call upon his name declare his doings among the people make mention that his name is exalted sing unto the Lord for he hath done excellent things this is known in all the earth praise God what a beautiful scripture beautiful that's how word of Prayer if you have another need on your heart just make it own unto the Lord by raising your hand or whispering and prayer here Heavenly Father we love you we're happy to be gathered in your house today father we just pray you'll speak to us through your word anoint us Lord you set apart from you we could do nothing so Lord we know none of us have any power here if we could we would heal everybody if it was up to us or we would we would do everything we could if we could do it ourselves but we can't we need your leadership we need your anointing so father just anoint us God for your glory today to hear to believe to understand to act upon your word Lord God and be with all those requests Lord that that we made known Lord God earlier I just pray you be with each person Lord God in a special way to guide us into your truth in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless you to me and she did praise God okay so I got a text from my wife said we can hear you perfectly praise the Lord Amen thank the Lord and again they be here except my you know Lydia kind of got sick right before we were about ready to leave so we prayed for her little stomach bug there alright so I want to basically like I said preach down just through this this portion of taking sides with Jesus it's become more clear to me over the last few weeks that this is important for us to to see and understand about the apostolic pattern of churches and I think and even through this this particular portion of taking sides with Jesus because remember there's too it's a ministers meeting when he preaches this it's in June of 62 the first half it's divided in two halves the first half is directly about how his vision is for how to spread the message that's his that's the first half the second half he just preaches about how when you if you were on earth at Jesus's time you would have had to take sides with him and you would have begin you would have been against all the religious people that day and you would have had to stand with Jesus you had have taken sides with Jesus and the example was the the man that was blind that Jesus gave His sight and then they brought him before the the the church elders right and and brought it I'm sorry I brought his parents and him before the elders and the parents took sides with you know the religious Pharisees but the the man that was made well he took sides with Jesus and then brother man said Jesus found him after they cast him out but a man said that's what God will do God will find us after the church is cast us out amen so I'm thankful he found me praise God amen I was cast out rejected counted out but Jesus found me praise God and I'm happy to be with you praise God God's a despised few praise the Lord so I just felt led you know to preach on this today maybe a couple more services we'll see by God's grace and then tonight we'll have four o'clock service here if you want to come if you want to stay at home that's fine like I said I just want to respect everybody during this time but I really feel burdened to get back to the house of the Lord like I said fifty days you know I just I feel it's just the time to do it you know some churches I know have never have never stopped gathering for any service which is okay I think that's fine if they feel led to do that the Constitution doesn't it's not against that the Constitution's for it that's the reason men like I was telling I think Haven asked me this morning daddy is it wrong and when we go to church I said no men died men and women died that we could have this freedom that's the whole purpose of this Constitution was to give us the freedoms we want to use wisdom in the midst of it but we're doing nothing wrong it's wrong to say you can't do what we're doing today praise God that's what's wrong so we're doing what's right but again if people have their convictions that's fine but we got to do what we feel led to do and we're thankful for the freedoms that men and women died for praise God so we want to look at this here I'll just call it take inside with Jesus and as you as you as you listen to this first half a lot of things become clear about what's going on today in the message and then a lot of things become clear just about brother branham's own doctrine how it's been he you know he grew in his understanding he had progressive revelation and I want to go through those too so I'll try to get through maybe half today so I copied and pasted the entire portion it's it's 13 pages of just plain text but I won't i won't preach all that but i just want to go through it because i think it's really important i think you can see a lot of truce here and now you know anybody if anybody in here could tell about all the the attempts satan has had to try to discourage the church and probably sister Karen because she's lived through a lot of it and I sat down with her in Loris one time years ago we talked about it but they they've seen since the beginning you know the nineteen seventy seven people fall away from that prediction they they just left the message a lot of people left just totally and then through the 80s you know you had different groups rise up the seven thunders group which they said they said the statue perfectman was the seven thunders but that was the wrong interpretation and they started worshiping the leader of that move to the point where after he died they they sat around waiting him for a resurrect there was a prophecy saying he would resurrect from New York and he never did then you had the parousia move of the 80's and 90's as well where Purusha is a Greek word that means his coming and it's a Greek word from the Bible the Lord's coming well a group rose up in Ohio the Manson's passed on when a group rose up and said the Lord's already come and they looked at the cloud of 63 and said the Lord already came there in other words and I don't know how far they took that but some people have taken that that quote at understanding not quote understanding and they said the rapture Artie took place and so they say there's no more need to fast no more need to pray and they live like heathens that they don't have any devotion to Christ now that in particular Church of Ohio didn't do that but they believed because they said this because Christ already came we don't need Holy Ghost anymore we don't need people to pray and speak in tongues or prophesy miracles they said we don't need anybody to shout in the services because these they said he's already here so they don't need it and that's wrong that's of the devil the Bible said quench not the Holy Spirit praise God amen and so see Satan's whole job is to try to get the true believer off the the genuine Reb elation of Jesus Christ amen and it's gonna be a small group that stays right with this word but I'm happy to be one of them today praise God we're a group I believe that's staying with the Word of God all the way praise God I believe that with all my heart if I didn't like I'll reprogram says if I did it I would go join the church that was if I believe there was a church that was more on the word I'd go join them I would it's hard being a pastor preaching all these times it's not easy I'd much rather it be a lot easier to sit under another faster and just preach once a month or be a lot easier but if there was another group that I believe had more truth bang I'd go join them you and I'd say brother let's go join them we're the trustees let's close down the church let's go join them but it's never been that way I believe there's churches that have the equal revelation we have I don't believe anybody ascends above our revelation like we've missed something or something like that I believe we're being fed manna from heaven praise God angels food praise the Lord things the Angels have desired to look into Peter said this new this new covenant the new New Testament revelation I believe God's giving us that praise God why do you I pray for it every before every service I pray for it for 30 minutes that's why I believe we're getting it I believe that's the right thing to do praise God we have to bring our oil to the house of God we know that but if anybody could see it of course it'd be sister Karen and now since I've come in the message the biggest wins have been against Jeffersonville in 2001 there's a move about the copyright and it almost went to court about who can make tapes both sides one side was saying only we can make tapes and the other side's saying anybody can make tapes and it almost went to court but then the side dropped the lawsuit it was trying to control now look at that church there's either two spirits these are the Holy Spirit or there's a Antichrist spirit just watch that and then in 2008 there's a great dispute about who was the absolute was it brother Branham or the word and it's the word praise God brother we saw last week program is pointing to the absolute praise God any man born in sin is not the absolute he's pointing to the absolute praise God Amen it's hard for people to understand that but that's because they don't pray enough praise God that's because they don't love God enough they don't read their Bibles enough to know that Jesus Christ is the only absolute praise the Lord they don't even listen to the tapes enough they only I don't know which tapes are listening to but it's not the tapes that we've been given praise God because all the tapes say Jesus Christ is the one the only absolute there's no other absolutes there could be no other one praise God and then in 2015 the tape church movement started I'm sorry I skipped 2012 was the believe the sign move anyone that had any questions or anyone that doubted brother Brandon as a prophet they left they still leave a little bit that was 2012 that's I call that the apostasy but I say that with kindness in my heart I I love those people I try to talk them back into it praise God but that was 2012 then 2015 the tape church movement started saying that we've got to sit down pastors need to they can still pass her but they shouldn't preach as much they should play tapes and that's been the latest move around the message of those two those are the wins that I've seen blow through recently and so we have to be very careful after watch as the years go on if the Lord tarries we just have to see which we have to see which moves which winds are blowing through and we have to look at it and we have to stay what was the romance oh you have to discern the two spirits within the framework of the church and if you're able to withstand the Antichrist spirit he said you'll be an invincible army praise God amen he didn't say he'd be a huge army he said you'd be invincible praise God hey I think we never claimed to be big as far as numbers but we claim to be invincible with God's Word in our hand praise God because what devil can stand before the anointed Word of God amen the Bible said the demons tremble at the name of Jesus Christ amen the Word of God so we have nothing fear about because perfect love casts out all fear amen but we have to stand we have to pray we have to stay true to God's holy word and so we shall by God's grace now let me begin here I want to just I won't be reading all the quotes but the ones I felt led to the Lord and kind of want to emphasize here so Ram says it plainly says we're going to start off with the early church and I can show you the vision I have for the future so if anyone wants to know what was brother branham's vision for his message if anyone wants to know right here taking sides with Jesus you have to wonder what did brother Ram want the brother man want Joseph to come and take over Billy Paul Rebecca Sarah who did he want to take over did he want anybody to take over there's no there's no there's no wondering about it at all brother man lays it completely out on the tapes praise God and to make sure we know whatever he would say it'd have to be the same thing Paul already said in God's Word because my RAM can't add one thing to what Paul said neither could Paul Paul said though we or an angel he said let it be cursed if if any person tries to change one word of Paul's gospel or this Holy Bible the Bible said they're cursed and may be temporary it may be a long time curse but we must not change one thing and he says we begin at Pentecost where the church was inaugurated the Holy Ghost found them he said and I believe all these things have a time of lingering waiting it's waiting for the time of the scripture to be filled fulfilled he said everything in order waiting he said many times we get impatient just like a child how many could say amen to that I get impatient right we all get impatient he said but he said we have great anticipations and many times we jump way ahead and that just hinders the work until the work gets caught up see we must just move reverently have a purpose in heart thank God if he would desire to use us and such as such away but wait till he makes the opening because he has got to go ahead of us and many of these moves that sister Karen has seen and I've seen a couple preachers they'll get a little thought and and what they'll do is they'll get a head of the Holy Spirit like with the thought about the seven thunders I mean that let's go it was all preparing them for the rapture they thought you know the because brother Aaron says the thunders will prepare us though the thunders will be revealed about the time of the rapture now we know he corrected that later he correct that and said the funders was the revelations in the seven seals he corrected that later but see they get one little thought and they try to make a big doctrine of it and they jump ahead that what if they really wanted at the beginning to see the rapture and they thought by preaching those seven thunders they would get the rapture but they didn't get it praise God they got ahead of the move of God amen we don't want to get ahead we don't want to fall behind we want to stay right in the middle of God's moon I want to walk in the light praise God not in front not behind how to walk in the line as he's in the light praise God and so see it's it's an impatience and especially in preachers our men get impatient and they try to exalt their false doctrine and they get ahead of the plan of God happens all the time but brother man said member David before he went out he waited till he felt the Holy Spirit in the mulberry trees the Holy Spirit manifested as a natural wind did it not and it blew and the mulberry bushes and David said now I can go out and I can repossess all all that I lost for he's God so though Graham says you a he said before you do anything wait till you see the Holy Spirit move praise God wait till you see the leadership or the Holy Spirit in our lives then we move upon the scene that's why you as a Christian Church it's so easy I shouldn't say easy it can be so easy just to do God's perfect will because you don't do anything until you know God's told you to do it it can be what I mean is it can be very simple to stay in God's perfect will if we want to be true to God if we want to be the bride it can be very easy just don't do it until you know for sure brings God weight do you see God supernaturally move and then go with it praise God amen it's such an important lesson that we need to be patient and no reason why they didn't you know why they're impatient because they never grew up on their stature perfect man because that's part of that's part of God's building and amen faith virtue knowledge patience praise God they never they never went all with God they never stayed in the truth of God so they can never be built up to have enough patience to really stay with God's Word nah but manna said if we only do that brethren knowing the battle must come but we must wait to see the hand of God going before us to make away now brown lays it out next paul established new churches and ordained pastors now we read that in let's go to acts 14 let's keep your place there acts 14 let's read that again by God's grace because brother Branham will say it plainly his vision is to continue what Paul started not to change one thing now this is Paul's first missionary trip member in chapter 13 I believe it is yea they fasted and prayed with the preachers and the prophets and the teachers and the Holy Ghost said separate me Paul Barnabas for the work I've called them to do and they went out on their first missionary trip Paul had tremendous success that's when the Jews blast fiend and said and then Paul said fine we shook ourselves of the dust and we say from henceforth we go to the Gentiles Paul tried he tried to go to the Jews you know just because of his love but then because they blaspheme he went to the Gentiles now chapter 14 they're working Iconium and Derbe and Lystra they have a great miracle at Lystra the impotent man is healed they try to worship but he gives all the glory to Christ and now verse 23 is what we read actually a scope - 21 X 14 21 and when they had preached the gospel to that city and had taught many they returned again to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith that we must through much tribulation enter to the kingdom of God can you imagine they started all these churches and then they would move on and then come back and say now listen we're back housing how's the picnic going is that what he said how was the picnic going is everybody is everybody enjoying the Millenium is that what he said no he said through much tribulation you're gonna fight you're like loaves I'm sorry you're like sheep among wolves right he told them you must go through Great Tribulation if you want to be a part of the kingdom of God how many willing to fight praise God how many willing to endure hardship remember Paul told Timothy endure hardship it's going to be hard people are going to come against you at every hand but you must endure hardship in order to be a part of the kingdom of God verse 23 and when they had ordained them elders in every city and then pray with fasting they commended them to the Lord on whom they believed see that to pray and fast say God show us which man is your God called man which man will be the man that will Shepherd the people and only preach them your word and then they before he left he'd ordained that person the Holy Spirit would mutt made it known to him he ordained that man the pastor verse 24 and after that passed through throughout beside iya they came to Pamphylia and when they had preached the word in purga they went down into italia and that sailed to Antioch from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled when they were come together and gather the church together they rehearse all that God had done what a testimony meeting brother Wow what a testimony meeting praise God rehearse all that God had done and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles and they abode long time with the disciples I wonder if he rehearsed earlier in the chapter where he told the man who never walked rise up on your feet in the name of Jesus Christ amen what a testimony meeting praise God he would establish the churches spend a few years on the trip and come back to where he started that's what brother BAM said he said wherever Paul went the Lord led him and established a church and when they preached the message and many was converted if he left the people in that condition they would wander right back out into their pagan gods in the Judaism whatever more because the people had no one to teach them the converse had no place to go so Paul established churches in different parts of the countries and each of these churches left someone who is in order a man that was trustworthy a man that was known as a pastor a shepherd or that after this church became other little churches come out of it young men and old men raised up and become churches out of that the man that was over the first church was called the bishop and then he and his that went out of him his children were called Shepherds or pastors and then this group of little churches all come back to this Bishop now go to first Timothy 3 Bishop is a Bible word now the denomination steal it and they make a lot of evil lordship with it but it is a Bible word Bishop is like the pastor and people use it you know to exalt people and it's not right but it's a godly word it means overseer first Timothy 3:1 this is a true saying if a man desire the office of a bishop he desireth a good work a bishop then must be blameless the husband of one wife vigilant sober of good behavior given the hospitality apt to teach so he should be very able just to teach praise the Lord Amen so see the word bishop it just means another word for pastor doesn't mean the same but it has the same idea its overseer and a pastor as a shepherd a feeder oversees sheep so Bishop is a Bible word and so we don't want to think there's a wrong with the word Bishop what's wrong is when men try to lord over men that's what's wrong when you get a denominational bishop praise God now brother him said this now let me just say this - I've always thought - if God ever raised up another Church in Akron I would not be let's say it's far away I don't know where far would be an acrobat if it's too far away I wouldn't I would not be against two different churches in Akron I would not be against that I don't I'm not I don't know I don't have to be the pastor of all Akron because if a church Springs out another church it could be God right now usually it's not a good idea but there I mean there are cities that have to message churches in them and they're good Holy Ghost filled churches and they can have a good fellowship look at Lima look at Loraine good good godly churches right multiple churches in one city but yet they still have fellowship and unity that's how all the Christian churches should be we should all have unity we shouldn't have any competition or any backbiting or any religious spirits on that manner now buh-bam says i rainiest carried on the same thing paul did Martin carried on the same thing Polycarp carried on the same thing right down through the age he said that was Paul and when Paul left John took over the church and when John left Polycarp then Polycarp Iranians and on down Martin and so forth and both ever said no God promised to restore again that same thing how did it get praise God oh it makes me happy because brother Graham came out of Jeffersonville all right and out of him came ventually brother Brooks and I came out of brother Brooks and cam came out of our church cams Church now so see it's the same thing God's doing the same thing today hallelujah one out of another God promised to restore that same setup you know there's a church there's a brother that came out of cams Church very nice brother but he came out in the wrong way and bang might know what I'm talking about I'm not speaking bad but I'm just showing you the example he came out of cam Church start his own church and guess who ordained him his dad not even a preacher that right there breaks the apostolic order of God's church God's church is for the lead the pastor if a church Springs out of his he needs to go ordain that man as the pastor and that's where his sovereignty ends now that passed with a new church now he is a sovereign leader over that church by the Holy Spirit amen not a denomination but a living organism praise God and so man might know who I'm talking about and cam has met with that brother since and the brother even apologized sister Karen and said I hope God can have forgive me on this because I didn't do it the Apostolic way that's why it's so important that brother Brooks ordained me as a pastor here right we have the special meetings right he ordained me and it's everybody knew that this man of God is anointing another man of God a faithful man to preach his word to preach God's Word amen and he's Jesus said or Joel said I will restore the same thing Paul did I'll restore that and we're seeing it today Church we're living in the days of the fulfilling of God's Word amen just us meeting every day every every weekend multiple times a week and then keeping this apostolic pattern we're fulfilling prophecy we're a part of Joel's prophecy amen now we all want to see the rapture part but hold on we'll get to that by God's grace let's do the Apostolic part first and then if we're faithful with that then we'll be faithful for the rapture thank the Lord as her brother and said God promised to restore that same nation again now look what brother Aaron says I want to read this for our sake and your sake listen well BAM said I believe there's not too much he said that would break this thing my interpret my interpretation may be wrong in the scriptures that Jesus could not come tonight I believe what little is left to be fulfilled could be fulfilled before daylight in the morning now look what he's saying he's saying Road RAM saying there's so little to be fulfilled in the scripture Jesus Christ could come in the morning right but look what he says next he said and I may be wrong on the time of that but it's at hand I believe it everybody with me program says there's there's hardly a and there's numerous quotes where boban says there's nothing to be fulfilled left there's very little be filled left and people will major on those quotes but I wanted to show you this program says right here I could be wrong and I think I by God's grace I believe from brother Graham's other sermons there's at least two scriptures to be fulfilled from pick up your pen and write brother Aaron said revelation 13:6 t the the Antichrist system will force the bride to stop preaching that was written when he said pick up your pen and write and it's revelation 13:16 and then revelation 3:10 because you've kept the word of my patience I'll keep you from the hour of temptation which will come upon to try them all that are on the earth so see brothers rogram whoa he'll say quotes where there's nothing left to be fulfilled but yet here he says I could be wrong on it but I know it's near I didn't hear praise God now why do I get so happy because I know so many preachers brother bang that go overboard and they won't hear any other quotes and the quotes they believe and then then they get this quote they won't even look at it see that's a lack of humility if we're humble that means we can learn more if we're humble that means we can be corrected praise God and that's what we want to be I want to be humble I want to be corrected if I'm wrong praise God but look at he says I may be wrong on the time of that fulfilling but I know it's near I hear ya praise God bro Graham said what if God would have told John the Revelator now it's going to be 2,000 years before my coming but BAM said John might have went back and been discouraged and told the church he said well I guess we might as well eat drink and be merry because there's going to be many durations brother bam sense of humor he said see Jesus ain't coming for 2,000 years see he said the church would have been loose if you and I knew the day or hour we might be kind of loose until like the week before praise God if you knew you had a couple more years oh well then I always wanted to buy that always want to travel there there's nothing wrong we wouldn't travel here hoping God on purpose God doesn't tell us because he doesn't want us to live for today he doesn't want us to live loosely spiritually but man said he wants us to be on the mark praise God he wants us focused on one target and he wants us to hit that target being prepared keeping her hearts clean for the coming of the Lord the Bible said we must be blameless he will preserve us blameless under the coming of the Lord praise God so it's a good point everyone must live like Jesus is coming and then right after that is the quote that ties him with brother amens dream he had that dream where Jesus said I'm coming now remember that Abraham says and taking sides of Jesus we've got to be looking for him coming right now even God I wondered what that dream was about well now I know cuz brother man says when you get a reality of Jesus Christ you live like he's coming now praise God hey man that's what that means amen I told you another one it could be it were now in the season the rapture if that's possible but I know for sure this is the right River at least one of the revelations of it you see God didn't tell John it's going to be 2000 years and remember all the disciples were around John because supposedly Jesus said he's not going to taste death though he sees the Lord's coming which was true but not physically it was the vision that he saw John saw Jesus is coming on Mount Transfiguration that's what Jesus meant but the people misunderstood it they misunderstood what the Prophet said all we see that a lot today they misunderstand what the Prophet said but those who are born again will catch the revelation of it that's right because they got the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will guide us into all truth that's exactly right so see all these statements rubberband makes everyone has got to be taken back to the word well Ram said he said try me he said he said it's come to the time where everything I've said has got to be either proven right or wrong he said because the Bible said prove all things hey hallelujah so God used taken sighs with Jesus to show me a men's prayer or a men's dream what that mean it means that we got to be looking for right now look for me now live like he's coming now I says this next brother now to carry on we've got to put footprints here on the sands of time that others can see if John haven't went I'm sorry if Paul hadn't went on the way he did then John wouldn't have known how to follow if John hadn't went on Polycarp would not have known how to follow if Polycarp when I went on a radius would have known how to follow if I radius would have went on Martin would have known how to follow see what I mean each one has to put footprints on the sands of time see Church the same Holy Ghost baptism that led those men and let me say like this without cell phones without Paul's sermons right right in their pocket where's mine they didn't have all Paul's words in their pocket like we got oh let me see if brother Ian didn't say that real quick let me check here they couldn't do that they had to pack backpacks of scrolls and my can you imagine all the scrolls they would have to carry and so see it shows that the strength that's going to keep us in the truth is not a natural thing it's a spiritual thing praise God another words the funny ghost field the proof that Jesus lives in you is not a physical proof it's a spiritual revelation it's God's presence in your soul you know I've been debating with this in a nice way this message believer from overseas all week he's didn't like my video on Jesus Christ is the absolute of brother Graham he didn't like that one at all and we finally came down to the end this morning I'm like brother I said I'm done I'm done talking about this you're not gonna convince me either way you didn't either I'm not gonna convince you but his last question was will then brother Jesse if the tapes are not all absolute and infallible then who is going to judge what's inspired and what's not inspired and I said brother the same thing that they used in the days of Paul to judge is the same thing we're going to use today it's the Holy Ghost praise God amen it's never changed it's the same thing that they that Paul Iranians Polycarp Martin Martin Luther all those godly men the same thing they had to judge what's right or wrong is the same thing we do it's God's Holy Spirit it never changed praise God but they think it's checking on their Apple and make another and say that would not so don't get me wrong we respect that we do that we do want to check back but the way to know you're right is that the Holy Spirit promised jesus said the reason I'm leaving is so you'll have me on the inside praise God to guide you into all truth praise God and that's the same thing Jose's not here but it's the same thing with Jose and William and Aaron and I sat in voice of God's office it came down to that well then brother Jesse he said how do you know what's inspired and what's not and I said brother the gift of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost in my heart tells me because it was sent for me the gift is to help me rightly divide it praise God and I said brother I says all right so I told her brother this morning on the text I said brother if I'm wrong if that's wrong well then I'll go teach the church too pray to the third person of the Trinity today like brother Brandon he said no no brother don't do that I won't do that to you but I'm I'm making a point there's a time brother Ram thought the Trinity was okay he called Jesus the second person the Trinity he said father I pray the third person attorney will come down and reveal your word to their hearts these people I don't know why sister Karen they just want to worship something anyone worship a man they want to worship something other than God Almighty praise God but not you and I we are going to worship one and only person the absolute person the eternal person the invisible person the Lord Jesus Christ amen yea I became visible I know that too but his real person is invisible because he's the invisible God Jesus Christ is the image of the invisible God but the invisible God is his spirit praise God see so what is my wife shared it with me obviously share it with her and she gave me a good description this morning she said but and I said I said honey they're just scared they live in fear and she said you know what that's right she said Peter said perfect love casts out all fear the reason they're worried in jeffersonville the reason they're worried all these churches I better not preach the reason they're worried is because they don't have the love of God amen but when you've got the love of God it gets rid of all your fear praise God amen when you really love God and gods in your soul you're not afraid you've got strength you've got power you've got confidence because Christ lives in you praise God so as time goes on we have to Ernest Lee contend for the faith that was delivered to Paul how many believe that it's gonna be a earnest fight there's gonna be all kinds of isms rise up here like I said every couple years another one rises up today's one is to limit the preaching is to make preachers and they and I even got the quote that costs make believers if we wonder well should the pastor preach or play tapes they said you're a make believer well I'm not a big believer because I don't wonder that I don't have any questions in my mind about that I know who called me to preach it's the one who vindicated me why not praise praise God I can't vindicate myself Christ came and vindicated my word Amen I'm preaching his word it ain't my word to begin with I have no word that can help anybody there's nothing good in me the only good thing is Jesus Christ and so see they want to take away and I've heard him say - I've heard from their lips they said brother I've ever heard his own family say that brother Ram fulfilled all the five fold ministry we don't need it anymore that's what they said oh they're so close but they're so far away they're close and the fact that brother Branham could have all five gifts but they're so far away saying he fulfilled them and we don't need them anymore they're so close but so far away let me prove that to you because it's scriptural I think I got it down here I just want to show it here there it is 1st Timothy 2 let's go there 1st Timothy 2 first Timothy 2:7 the church we can prove that Paul had at least three of the five gifts of the fivefold ministry just by scripture and then by common sense you can see he had the other ones too look at verse yeah first Timothy 2:7 we're on - I am ordained a preacher and in a apostle I speak the truth in Christ and lie not a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and Verity so by his own words he says I'm apostle and I'm teacher well 1st Thessalonians 4 says I speak to you in the name of the Lord that the dead in Christ will rise first amen he gives prophecy so he's a prophet and then brother Ram said he was the first pastor in Ephesus right and the last one evangelist he hadn't been advantageous because evangelist goes to churches that are already established right and just straight that's what evangelist does he brings us fire he sets a fire in the church that's already started and then leaves town but see a missionary he goes there stays there gets a say so for a little bit sets it in order and then he leaves and he ordains a pastor over there before he leaves so that people don't wander back into sin right they don't wander out into denominations and or organizations and things like that so can everybody see that is that clear they're so close brother Ram did have all five but he didn't do away with them all right just want to share that with you hope that was okay by God's grace I know it's okay I shouldn't say that I know I know it's alright no one's gonna bawl me out after service for preaching that I know that okay now here's my brother Ram says well if I thought there was a denomination or any other group of believers that had anything better than what we have here I would want to merge this little body with it right quick I said the same thing look how home over the RAM was if there was a church that had more revelation I'd go merge my church with theirs but there wasn't same thing I believe if there's someone more correct with more of the word and more anything let's go join them but where we going to go we want it we want a church here for our family praise God we want to church here because it's close to us praise God we want that we want to church here because nobody else is fishing here praised it there should be there's some more chances to go fishing here praise God hallelujah that's what we feel led to do and so far it's been vindicated by the souls that have been saved praise God that's right and then brother M goes to his own ministry he goes back to the fifties where he went to Bombay and he said Bombay India and he there hadn't been at least a hundred thousand that gave their lives to Christ and he said I had no church nothing I could do there was nobody to give to them he's talking about preachers what would if program could give new Congress anything what would he give them a preacher a preacher praise God I knew yeah not his takes a preacher take for good we need them but the living creatures what will brother and one to give him he said what can i what could I do there's nobody to give to them there wasn't even a Pentecostal denomination that would cooperate with me and he says those souls can you imagine a hundred or two hundred thousand he said those souls probably drifted right back to the shiites the Jains the buddhist and whatever they came because there was no place to put them now what a shame that's a disgrace because I had no cooperation because of the stand that I take and then he gives an example the only church that won that crop rate with him was a father son Holy Ghost church where they baptized three times face forward and three times backward he said he said I couldn't have any fellowship with them and they do three in the father and three in the son and three in the Holy Ghost he said how can I cooperate with that right now let me balance this out too if anybody got the Holy Ghost at that meeting there's no way they could have went back to Hinduism because the Holy Ghost is a sealed Saints until the day of redemption it seals the desire for sin out and it seals holiness in yeah so see you got to be out of balance all these out because you understand programs he's just he's just kind of sharing his heart with the people but Jesus Jesus said all that the father has given me will come praise God and no man is able to pluck those predestinated souls out of my father's hand now the make believers yeah they would have wandered right back they just had an emotional confession I'm giving my heart to Jesus and never really died out to themselves and really repented yeah they would have wanted right back to the Sikhs and the Jains but not a real experience with Christ now brother man gives it a hypothetical example he says what if brother and I had revival here and we got through in a big revival you brother and I just got converted and there wasn't a Church of this type in the country and I've been the advantage list and now I'm leaving out you may never see me again what would you do I mean I'm inside this church let me just be real real what if the Holy Spirit called me to go overseas and I moved overseas what would you do I'll tell you what you do he said you'd be so burned with it till one of you lay members Vanger amen would feel like starting up a church and start preaching it yourself cuz your heart would burn for the Word of God and you would feel bad for the people that left the same way you did now isn't that right program said you'd feel so bad if you're the only man you'd stand up and start preaching praise God hey hallelujah that's what would happen that's what my mam said that's what must happen in India people got saved by Ram left well I can't go back to the world but Ram he even says in this quote we can't go back to the Pentecostals where they stripped their women and their clothes and and watch evil movies and he said we can't go back there where are we gonna go we'll start our own praise God hey now don't care if it's small I don't care what the word were poor Jesus said if there's two or three he's right there in church with you praise God hallelujah that's why I don't care how loud it is I preach like this whether there's a hundred people here or I got two people here because I know Jesus is here Christ is here amen I always preach for him because his his sphere is a reality in my life I can't live without him I can't make any more decisions without him I need him in everywhere every area every day of my life I need him that's what you do god call me elsewhere man would start preaching or a man with sour preaching somebody would start preaching you wouldn't sit there and say well let's all just close shop and let's just all go to the Methodist Church now why don't we do that you wouldn't do that somebody would stand up praise God let me say like this that's kind what happened when Tim Myers left God caught him well somebody's got to stand up and preach I'll preach nobody else into it I'll do it I feel that Lord to do it I feel like the Lord's given me a good understanding of his word and if I say true he'll keep me true praise God that's exactly what you do if God called me off the scene or called me somewhere else he said though you knew Jesus was coming you thought he was coming tomorrow yet you'd want to do something today to help those people fellow citizens of the kingdom of God you want to fellowship with them he said so that's the way I want to do something today to help God's people what's the best thing I can do tell me about Jesus tell him remind them of God's promise it will never fail you Church he'll never leave you he'll never forsake you jesus loves you he died for you his spirits here to help you that's the best thing I can do is tell you that Jesus Christ is here he loves you praise God hey man if I knew he's coming tomorrow I'd do that same thing today remember the RAM goes into how God led him to build the tabernacle and then he said we went through pastor after pastor he said and then God finally raised up Ormond Neville did you know brother Ram said I love hearing my pastor preach you know he said that he didn't say I love when my pastor sits down and plays the tape he said I love when my pastor preaches Hey praise God amen now program he goes into this thought against the brothers some of them were saying well nobody's hearing we're not growing nobody's hearing our preaching look what he says he said now you say well brother Ram if they will hear these signs and wonders of the Great God of heaven how are we going to do it so brother bam addresses the discouragement of the preachers you ever been discouraged because people don't believe the message you ever felt like how come people just don't believe him why can't they see that these are supernatural things why can't they see that when I see why can't they see the pillar fire program addresses these ministers were discouraged we've shown these signs wonders and miracles and they're not even moved program said well now what if st. Paul had that same idea what if Saint Paul were to quit you want to quit you don't see much people coming the message you want to quit so that what if Saint Paul would have quit but then said si no but he didn't those bishops say just as loyal to the message and Paul ever so often you reading the Bible he'd come back and visit the churches and we're having brother Brooks come later this month the man that helped establish this church by the authority of the Holy Ghost he's coming back to see how we're doing with amen I'm gonna show them you're real good praise God I'm feasting on God's Word I'm preaching his word instant in season and out of season I'm feeding God's little lambs praise God he said back and talk with the pastors the bishops took relief from the people member the Philippians gave him his food and clothing nobody else would give him food and clothing at the end except the Philippians all the other churches they didn't care yep Paul it started their churches can you imagine that it'd be like your brother Brooks said oh I had a need and I'll be like I don't care I don't care what brother Brooks needs I'm a pastor I can't I can't set him a love offering I can't send him some clothes or something like that he said only the Philippians helped and I was in chapter 4 he says okay now let's read it Acts 1536 let's go back there do you feel more apostolic all the time long we go over that Magnum Ric where Apostolic Church we started the right way and we're gonna finish the right way I hope we finish at the rapture though honestly I don't have to diagnose the grave but if I do fine that's fine I hope we get to finish where we don't have to taste death praise God I hope by God's grace that's our calling in life here acts 15 36 he said just remain as loyal as ever even if people turn you down even if they won't accept the signs miracles and wonders he said just remain ever as loyal as possible I know I've got a revelation in that church I have a revelation of that I know I'm not coming here for money or for popularity or anything like that I'm coming here because I know Jesus is watching and I want to be loyal to Jesus Christ that when I see him face to face he'll say well done you kept my word you were faithful you were faithful with little I'll make you ruler over much not that I want much I just want to be faithful X 1536 and some days after Paul said to Barnabas let's go visit again and visit our brother in every city let's see how those Saints are doing huh where we have preached the word of Lord and see how they doing how are they I love that's a real father's heart right there right let's see how our children are doing verse 37 and Barnabas determined to take them with them John whose surname was mark now look at this here come up here and barn verse 30 38 but Paul thought not good to take him with them who departed that from them from Pamphylia and went not with them to the work look at this church look at verse 39 and the contention was show so sharp between them that they departed asunder one from the other and so Barnabas took mark and sailed under Cyprus can you imagine these were the two men it'd be like it'd be like two brothers shoulder-to-shoulder we went on the first missionary trip and the whole Bible and then a few years later they get so mad at each other that's so sharp they'll say fine I won't go on the next missionary trip with you you'll go by yourself he said fine go ahead and go and yet they both had the Holy Ghost Milka see you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and God will even use your humanity to accomplish his will no doubt Church there was something Barnabas needed to preach somebody needed Barnabas's message over there and somebody else needed Paul so God said fine I'll use your disagreement I'll feed both of them praise God that's why church when you see this I can understand why was brother man he's so thought 1977 he so thought it sometimes brother hey man men are so sure they're right that they're willing to separate from other Holy Ghost filled men because I think I'm right and God will even allow that and said I'll even use that contention for my glory praise God many sometimes church when there's splits between preachers that don't mean there are the will of God it may be God is doing something differently God's gonna meet other needs that he couldn't meet any way so anytime you see a division against preachers don't judge it you know unless you can tell someone's off the word but you can also see how men can get so sure they can be so convinced I'm right and yet God will use that for his glory look at verse 40 and Paul chose Silas and the parted being recommended by the brother unto the grace of God and he went through Syria and Cecilia confirming the churches confirming just means a strengthen to edify so Paul just went back and said hey brothers how you doing now look here we got the world Lord here look at these other letters I got look at these revelations he just went to encourage them let me encourage you he said but you must enter the kingdom of God through much persecution and just that visit just that visit I imagine brother amen was enough to encourage those brothers and said my Paul can do it I can do it hallelujah Paul can withstand all the powers of darkness I know I can withstand it too I don't have it by the other text but that brother from Texas here he said just by talking to me this week he said he was totally strengthened let me see if I can find it real quick I was telling that but to brother amen good morning I just want express my gratitude to you for the encouragement and insistence on speaking to me cuz he at first he said aw you don't have to call me but I just felt let Lauren last Sunday night I was washing dishes many men I was washing dishes there and I just felt let he said oh you have to call me I just felt led I've got to call this brother I just got to talk to him I felt led now usually I'd be like oh great I don't talk to him I can go to bed it's like you have to worry about something else he said it lifted me up from a low low place and allowed me to take the next step forward as a result the condemnation has begun to leave me bringing me a peace I've been longing for for a great while by the Lord's grace I didn't in church your words are so powerful praise God whatever the Holy Ghost had me say sister Naomi I don't know what it was but it removes the devil of condemnation off that man this week that demon a condemnation you're condemned you're nothing because of the words I spoke by the Spirit of God that devil done left I just cast out another devil but the manga didn't realize it's here it's true it left he said for 20 years he's been under that condemnation and just a few words from anointed voice of vessel of God is able to remove that devil amen and the church said I say Amen to God's Word that's the same thing Paul did Paul felt led I got to go back to this church let me go and courage that brother let me go encourage that one and but was Paul Superman no Paul got solo one time for the amen he said God had to send me Titus and Titus refresh me o shirt you never know when you're gonna refresh somebody so be ready praise God be ready let the Living Waters of life let the praises of God be flowing out to you your words may bring a cool divine refreshment into someone's dry dry life si like that they're dry desert hot dusty life your words may just flow like waters out and refresh those thirsty souls I better stop cuz I'm gonna preach hard all day I got a preach tonight TV okay let me find one thing to close here let me close to this program says we've got to think of the others coming behind us these young people a place for our children our daughters we don't want them out in the world and things like that we want them girls raised like their mothers we've got our arrangements for that if there's no tomorrow we don't know that if there's no tomorrow we haven't done nothing but been at the Masters business and been found at our post of duty when he does come that's what I like bangs idea to build a church because it'll give the generations if there's another generation it will give them someplace to go you gotta have someplace to go right you sell those big message churches whether they have they have Friday night youth night Saturday night youth why are they doing that to keep the youth out of the world you gotta have somewhere to go you gotta have someplace the fellowship right as Jane gets older and Lily and Eden come on over to my house you know let's have a Friday night youth at my house we'll have to do something they got to have someplace to go praise God we got to think about them if the Lord tarries now if God wants a bill to church he'll send us the money to do it I don't need our help bill in the church when did God ever need a man's help to build a house I don't need anybody's help praise God but it'll send us the ability to do it if there's another if that's his will for this this area for example brother Randy sighs they're still renting out that cheap that church he's been a pastor there almost his whole life up in there in Lorraine they're still renting it and they still have a very good ministry thriving ministry godly people supernatural he was telling me last time I seen at the funeral he was tell me he's preached on divine healing and he said the church swept or the Holy Spirit swept right to the Church and a couple people got healed right there in the service yet there right the church they never felt led to build so that's fine let him go with the leading of the Lord praise God right that's just one one idea but then Tim Pruitt he said the Holy Spirit told him to build a church which he got a lot of criticism for it but then he built it and he said now they they build it with absolutely no debt I'm talking like a millions of minutes people just donated their time building they had all these construction workers they just donated it and they have no debt at all he said God build this church it was right for that that that woman had cancer and he said God told me to build the church and he said greater miracles gonna be done there they built the church the woman had cancer that's where they scanned it there was cancer she went she got the Holy Ohr she had the anointing of the Holy Ghost in her service said she was healed she went back and there was no cancer and they put it on Facebook if God wants to build a church you ain't gonna stop him praise God but if God wants to keep us here renting God will keep us here renting the thing to do is say God let your will be done and let me let me find your leading or the Lord that's my prayer to let me find God's leading you said you got to think of others now I'm gonna close to this so I suggest this let's into our feet so I suggest this to brother Neville let's carry this on just as we have let's let it just the way it is huh if ever brother Rand had a chance to tell these preachers to stop preaching and play my tapes this was it he had all of me I brother Crais here brother jr. Jackson he had brother Snelling he had brother Neville he had all these brothers here if he ever wanted to tell them you need to sit down and press play he would have done it but he didn't he said let's keep it just the way it is and musicians you can come by they meant if you got a song let me know buddy now boy bear says I'm grateful for these young ministers oh that makes me feel so good brother man that's it I just I say thank you Lord see actually at the day of judgment for this entire valleys through here there will be no excuse because we've got little churches setting out everywhere outpost listening-posts waiting for the coming of the Lord so brother man never never limited the fivefold ministry in fact at the end of this sermon let me go down to page 20 whatever it is he said I pray you bless these preachers each one of them in thy name you will keep them in the faith that was once delivered to the Saints that never will they vary from that and out of this group may you send pastors teachers evangelists Oh God granite and that they may hold the fort everywhere wherever they are may they continually work until Jesus comes okay we all say amen amen that's brother man's prayer he said don't change a thing and just so you're sure Church just so you're sure where is this one six months later he says the same thing I'm sorry nine months later in the seals they ask brother Graham should've and just continued on the field of course don't change a thing six months after that in 64 August brother Adam of are you the only person that should preach no every man that feels that god of call a call of God on his life get into the ministry and start preaching we need them it'd be a lot easier just to play sit down amen brother Branham amen hey be allowed to
