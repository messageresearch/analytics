forgot to read the memory verse this past weekend so sorry about that i just kind of forgot about that the guest minister and everything ephesians chapter 3 verse 5. look at the mystery of the jew and gentile church tonight part 5 ephesians chapter 3. you know some of those scriptures we've been preaching last few weeks i've been praying in my prayer closet i've been speaking i've been reading i wrote it on a sheet you know and i've just been speaking that i am a child of god i am a partaker of his blessings i've been reading that you know when i pray in the morning i've been feeling so encouraged praise god it's been uh the other one is oh i am god's beloved i am a i'm in the family of god just saying it makes you feel good i am god's beloved praise god these scriptures are just so powerful we always must remember all the blessings that we have right forget forget not his benefits it's so easy to forget with all the trials of life and uh different uh distractions you know out there it's uh it's easy to forget all the blessings that we've inherited but we are the children of god we are the people of god we are the saints i like that song we are the saints we are the children of the most high god amen ephesians chapter three verse five and six we'll read five and six here thank the lord praise god thank the lord the brothers uh that you know the brothers that visited they just sent some texts and just saying what a wonderful time they had and they appreciate the fellowship so thank you for treating them uh like your christian family they had a wonderful time uh we just had a great time together with the brothers he said they left refreshed now that's good you travel yet you leave refreshed yeah you got that jet lag and everything i like that i'm glad they felt refreshed and we're so blessed by the fellowship ephesians three five and six let's read that together in verse verses five and six on three one two three which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit that the gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel amen psalms 19 let's go there please verse 13 and 14 psalms 19 13 and 14. now let's read our memory verse there together psalms 19 13 and 14. let's begin on three one two three keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins let them not have dominion over me then shall i be upright and i shall be innocent from the great transgression let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight oh lord my strength and my redeemer amen let's have one more word of prayer if you have a need on your heart let's make a known unto god and let's go before the lord here tonight surely there's many needs as we saw we had at least six or seven requests there and no doubt we all have unspoken needs uh we're in need of god's strength tonight to finish the week and glorify god in our homes and on the job and everywhere we go lor even in public by god's grace let's pray to the lord heavenly father lord we just come again reverently thank you god that we serve a tremendous god who's who's made a promise and kept and keeps every promise lord and you promised us all these wonderful things lord and yet we know we must go through trials but even in the midst of trials or we see the blessings that come lord god and we know you give us overcoming grace lord this when we're in the trial the standard gets raised we see you raise the standard raise power raise strength a raise protection maybe we didn't even see it coming or didn't even know we had that kind of strength but yet lord you fill us with your grace and your mercy lord you're walking with us right through the trial just like you were with shadrach meshach and abednego thank you for being with us in the trials lord god and giving us grace to overcome help us tonight lord god we're in need of you lord god and i pray you speak through me and and lord hear through all of us lord god we all need to hear from you and be blessed and strengthened and encouraged tonight father god we know you're alive and well and lord we just pray god just lord speak to us in a special way lord in these these moments that go by so fast may we just enjoy them lord god and benefit from them may this be such a wonderful special time tonight we ask that the holy spirit will have his way in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god all right i'm going to try to preach 45 minutes we'll see how that goes tonight here now if you would uh let's go back to romans 2 16 can you put that up there i just kind of want to end or i'm sorry start where i kind of left off last week so romans 2 16 we kind of left off with this thought about paul's gospel as the judgment standard and i think uh i think i want to read this scripture one more time and i want to look at a few uh scriptures i had yeah yeah okay there's yeah i was looking for revelation 21 okay and that day when god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according to my gospel just leave that up there just a moment uh so we ended uh last wednesday by by recognizing that all secrets of men are going uh to be judged by jesus christ according to paul's apostle i'm sorry paul's epistles rather sorry the apostle paul his epistles every secret now church you know as i was driving to church here i just had this thought uh you know in revelation 21 8 you know you can pull that up there if you'd like uh verse 7 revelation 21 verse 7 says he that overcomes inherits all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son so i'm sorry 21 21 yeah thank you so we must overcome right we sing about it tonight we overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of his testimony now if you look at the next scripture here's what the blood of jesus christ is supposed to help us overcome right verse eight the fearful so the blood of jesus christ gives us victory over fear the blood of jesus christ gives us victory over unbelief right so some of us are gonna have to overcome fear some of us are gonna have to overcome unbelief right abominable abominations right some of us are going to overcome abominations temptations that were abominable uh seemed tempting to us but we had to overcome it by the blood of the lamb praise god in other words we had to seek jesus for forgiveness for any sins related to these right and that and now but think about this also sorcerers okay so we we understand that sorcerers you know witchcraft workers idolaters that's what i think a lot of brother branham worshipers are going to be guilty of that i believe many of them will i'm sure many of them will be lost if they don't repent making brother branham an idol right i was listening to it this week and i was remembering uh uh that that uh and i think i was actually i was listening to last week's sermon and that revelation kind of struck me uh that people that follow brother branham worship or exalt him above paul because they can admit paul had opinions and not every word paul said was thus saith the lord but every word brother branham says they say is thus saith the lord they've exalted brother branham above paul and to equal state of jesus right but what did what did john the baptist say i must decrease he must increase amen they all they so forget about these other scriptures right they get so caught up on certain scriptures but church there'll be a lot of people around the message that are lost because of idolatry they worshipped a man rather than worshiping god almighty now liars people that they wouldn't tell the truth and this lie kept them from being saved right it wouldn't let them receive repentance and justification because of lies now let's just stop there for a moment keep that up there remember church remember some of these are going to be secrets right that we don't find out to the white throne judgment people we thought around the message were doing pretty good or were really good they seem to have a really sound testimony remember that judas hung around for three and a half years and nobody detected him except jesus right so some of these people we're going to meet at the white throne we're going to see them missing in the millennium right we're going to see them missing at the rapture they'll be missing in the millennium and the secrets of their hearts they didn't confess their fear right they didn't confess their unbelief they didn't confess their abominable sins like i've had a brother who keeps uh doesn't live around in this nation but i have a brother who keeps emailing me from overseas and he battles homosexuality and i keep praying for him there's actually a couple of brothers that do that they say pray for me brother jesse i forgot to pray for him tonight i need to do that but the email sits in my inbox and i've got to pray for them now i like that now i like that they're reaching out for prayer because if it's kept secret and it's not confessed they'll be guilty of it but i like a repentant heart not that you have to tell people all your deep dark secrets but you got to seek jesus christ you have to seek his blood and seek his forgiveness that god will deliver you from our secrets right we must have deliverance from our secret sins kind of like that scripture we read that ties in real good with our memory verse keep me from those presumptuous sins right from those really evil ones and this is what and see hormones people that had now let's think about some of our presence like jfk think about all the whoremongering he did they tried to keep it for a secret but it's come out now let's see church we can't hide anything right anything that was a lie think about all the lies that people have had uh they're all gonna be exposed either now or later see so the thing to do is the blood of jesus christ will urge you to come clean and and go through the humiliation now or the shame now and recognize that that we must confess and that jesus actually paid for your shame jesus took your guilt jesus took your shape he paid for it on the cross and he makes you the forgiven one praise god but these are the ones that won't accept it they're going to hide their secrets but paul's gospel came that we could confess all of these personal secret sins and live with a clear conscience amen i'm glad church said that we can come to the house of god and we can really sing we can really praise god we can really have joy in the house of the lord because everything's been confessed amen there's no secrets that we're trying to hide or try to keep people away from looking at our phone or keep people out of this area of our life or something like that you know we all have sins but we're trying to overcome our little mistakes that we make our sins that we make but i'm talking about big things that keep people from being saved we ought to have the helmet of salvation on we ought to know that we're saved and not let anybody talk us out of that praise god because we've gone to the word we've gone to this bible and we said lord i want you to take away my sins now forgive me of my sins i want to overcome these things amen i want to be an overcomer i don't want to be overcome i don't want to be a victim i want to be a victor praise god i want to be an overcomer praise god i don't want to be a complainer i want to be a conqueror amen hallelujah we've got the overcomers here tonight amen we've got any conquerors we've got any victors here tonight amen victors not we're not victims but we're victors amen we're more than conquerors in christ jesus these things will not overcome us we'll overcome them amen oh that's a blessing so i just want to go back and remind you that on the white throne judgment all all these secrets are going to be revealed and we're going to stand there and watch them right and the overcomers will judge those who kept these secrets and didn't confess them hallelujah i'm glad we can confess them and as we're always reminded when they're confessed they're thrown in the sea of forgetfulness you never hear from them again amen i think they just totally washed away totally uh drowned out and totally done away with totally uh put out of all memory right totally forgiven that's the blood of jesus amen glory now i want to start looking here paul teaches extensively on the revelation of one church okay there are about six i'm sorry five books of the of his of his of his new testament five books where he he definitely majors on this he labels this a mystery he gives plenty of evidence that the jew and gentile are in one church so let's go to romans 16 if you would romans 16 25 and 26 romans 16 25 and 26 now i can't wait to preach on this book if the lord tarries and the lord gives me grace to keep preaching i can't wait to preach on the book of romans i'm going to preach all the way through just like i've done galatians ephesians and philippians i this when i looked at romans this summer or last summer i was blown away uh if you haven't read the entire book lately i encourage you to do it chapters one to five show the universal need for jews and gentiles to receive the righteousness of christ that he's graciously offering because we're all sinners we all fall short of the glory of god but then the bible says therefore uh being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ amen the first five chapters deal with how do we get peace with god jew gentile greek right heathens how do we get peace with god through faith in jesus christ now chapters 6 7 and 8 teach how the new man or the spirit-filled believer overcomes sins how he understands the mosaic covenant and walks in the holy spirit praise god because there's no condemnation to that or them that are in christ jesus amen that walk not after the flesh but walk after the spirit is that how you feel church you feel clean going to work every day you feel clean coming to church you feel clean like there's nothing there's nothing hindering me i'm walking in the holy spirit praise god i don't feel any condemnation i don't feel anything is wrong i'm an overcomer i'm freshly washed i freshly wash my garments my garments are clean amen that's how we should feel we should walk in the spirit and we won't fulfill the lusts of the flesh verse i'm sorry chapters 9 through 11 show israel's blindness 9 10 and 11 show israel's blindness we preached on that mystery before this mystery that's what verses 9 10 11 now chapters 12 13 and 14 15 16 uh show the guidelines for christian living okay now paul ends this book look at look how he ends this book what a tremendous ending to the book uh quite uh quite uh simple but look at his ending his last few words he tells the the romans here he says in verse 25 now to him that is a power to establish you that's to to to stabilize you according to my gospel and the preaching of jesus christ according to the revelation of the mystery so see what when you receive a revelation it makes you stable right it makes you stable like here's an example the mystery of israel's blindness here's a recent one how many know they're getting under major fire right now israel from hamas have you seen the iron dome they have a defense system in israel they're so smart over there they got the blessing of god on their lives since they moved back to the land they're so blessed hamas i saw a video they'll shoot hundreds of missiles and israel has the iron dome where they have missiles ready to fire up and it it destroys them in the air hundreds i think they did 400 the other day israel just has all this so when the enemy comes in god raised up a standard against him and they're so they're so smart they're so protected because god has favor upon them right because god promised he said even though even though you forsake me he said i could never forget you israel amen but see without this revelation that god still honors israel people might say and there's a lot of sinners that do a lot of liberals like democrats and even some republicans they say oh you know israel deserves that you know because they're mistreating palestinians and everything like that well i don't know all the details but one thing they should not be attacking god's people right and so see that so someone might agree with striking israel if they don't have the revelation of israel's blindness that god's mercy still goes out to israel does that make sense i hope i made that okay to understand with my uh my primitive uh understanding here or my primitive language right see someone might think it's okay for israel to be bomb but it's not okay it's god's people and when you've got the revelation of that you're more stable towards that that subject right oh i understand and church we should be praying for israel i should have prayed for them tonight i didn't even think of that let me write it down for sunday uh let's pray throughout the week but we have to pray for israel despite all those attacks they're under how many believe god can hear our prayers to protect israel remind me at the end later malachi lydia remind me at the end let's pray for israel i forgot about that but that's just one area when you understand the revelation of the mystery then you will uh you won't condemn israel you'll pray for them you'll pray for peace right and that's what paul says my preaching establishes you oh according to the revelation which was kept secret since the foundation of the world since the world began these were all secrets but now they're revealed verse 26 but now is made manifest and by the scriptures the prophets according to the commandment of the everlasting god made known to all nations for what the obedience of the faith what does god want from the united states he wants obedience what does god want from south africa obedience from australia obedience from africa from europe what does god want from all these nations obedience to the faith he wants men and women that obey the word of god they understand it they know it they obey it and they honor him they bring glory to their creator that's what it is he said that's what it's for why was the mystery made manifest so that you and i will obey the gospel praise god amen why are all these revelations why did god have to finish the mystery of god so he would have us to obey the word of god that we might enjoy his blessings we might enjoy his presence now that we might have the overcoming blood now praise god we might experience the blessing of god now that now you'll have christ in you praise god that we won't just always sing oh in the sweet bye and bye things will be you know things will be great then things can be great now when you walk with christ amen right we always sing that song in the sweet bye we shall meet on that beautiful shore that's all right right we are going to do that one day but we should see the blessing of god now we should have a zeal for god now we should enjoy the benefits of serving god right now we should be overcomers now we should be the joshua generation now amen now's our time to overcome so see so part of it we can't put it off we can't put our victories off to the future we should be victorious right now more than conquerors now praise god he said you are the children of god now he said you have the spirit of adoption now i'm not an orphan i'm an adopted son praise god and i've got the benefits of being an adopted son are the rights and privileges and blessings we've seen them we thank god for healing we thank god for salvation we thank god for the baptism of the holy ghost we thank god for a transformed mind amen oh hallelujah thank the lord so what are these what are these great mysteries why do we say the word mysteries and why do we rejoice because they help us obey the word of god right one of the mysteries the mystery of god's will when we obey we get all the benefits of obeying god's will that we can be assured like we said last wednesday we can have an expected end we know when we die we don't have to fear at death at death's door we won't have to fear we know exactly what jesus is going to say well done praise god amen it's an expected end praise god right because we obeyed on this earth we knew the word on this earth and now we have an expected end and can somebody say amen tonight hallelujah that's right we have an expected end church now look at this this is glorious all's god wants is the gentiles to obey the faith that's all he wants does that sound familiar like deuteronomy 29 29 can you pull that out there deuteronomy 29 29 it's such an amazing thing that's one thing satan can't do satan can't obey the word of god right he can't obey it he can't keep it but thank god you can amen and not by your power but by the power of god amen thank god see you can do something satan can't satan can't now he can do some things you can't he has power of darkness and the prince and power of the air and he can do some of these things you know just at his own will when god allows it but see satan can do those things but we can do greater things we can obey god we can love god amen and satan can't do that see the secret things belong to the lord our god moses says it right before he dies in deuteronomy 29 but those things which are revealed belong unto us and our children forever that we may do all the words of this law praise god i'm glad i can lay hands on the sick and they recover amen praise god hallelujah i'm glad i can have peace that passes all understanding amen the world can't have that right they have to have drugs to go to sleep at night right they've got to have drugs to wake them up in the morning they've got to have but we have peace that passes all understanding amen we have so many benefits that they can't experience we can actually have forgiveness in our hearts praise god and we can actually forgive our enemies we can actually do good to those who persecute us amen we can have a positive attitude towards those that have sinned against us because we have the love of god and you'll know all the disciples by our love that they have one for another and our love for our enemies as well we can live in a way they can't even dream of praise god because we're overcomers amen because we've obeyed the faith we've obeyed the mysteries praise god we've done the words of the law so we have the power of the law hallelujah i'm trying to think of a more recent example of that remember i had that i told you about that hindu man that came into our service one time years ago when we were at the waterloo and he's like i can't believe you can preach like that he said if i said any of those things my wife would laugh at me i remember that hindu guy so he was amazed at the power that we had as christians we had power to live above so many sins right we have power to not be a slave to our cell phones right we're not a slave to these things now some people have apps that you know block websites and that's a good thing but see if you're born again you've already got the blocker you you got the blocker right here praise god i already got that downloaded from heaven amen now you can add that it'll be good for your kids until they're born again that'll be good but if a grown-up person who says they got the holy ghost has to have something like that to keep them from evil then they don't have the power of god yet praise god because these these temptations are common to all man right every generation has to overcome these things but every generation has had the opportunity to have the power of god inside of them right and to be more than conquerors this power's been been available all these years and god's people always receive it praise god thank god amen we can do the word they can't do the word but we can do it amen praise god we can pray in secret and not brag about it right we can give alms and not tell other people about it right we can give in secret not go brag about it on facebook right we can do that we can pray in secret right we can do alms in secret we can fast and not tell anybody we're fasting right we can do that because we've got the power of god we're not going to be the pharisees and go try to get compliments from at church right or out in public our best prayers should not be in public our best prayers should be in private right because the pharisees love to pray in the marketplace so they love to play pray in the temple to be seen of men jesus said verily they have their reward he said but i'll reward you when you pray in secret when you pray in secret i'll meet you in there and i'll reward you openly see they don't have the revelation of these things and so they don't get the blessings of them but we have the revelation of them praise god so what does god want from this revelation he wants all nations to obey the word of god now would you pull first corinthians 12 13. first corinthians 12 13. here's how both jew and gentile become a part of the one church for by one church membership by one water baptism no that's not it by one tape no by one church attendance no no by one spirit amen are we all baptized into one body praise god see each person has to have one holy ghost experience praise god where god comes and he approves of your life and he comes to live inside of you so you're no longer living to yourself you're living for others amen i like how brotherhood says that by one church membership by one creed by one denomination no by one spirit whether we be jews or gentiles bond or free we've all been made to drink into one spirit praise god so see one baptism of the holy ghost experience gives you all the rights all the benefits all the inheritances praise god amen now that's the main those are two main scriptures right there we're going to do five romans 16 first corinthians 12 go to galatians 3 hun galatians 3. now remember galatians 3 is a basically an explanation of genesis 12 3. so i'm going to you leave that up galatians 3. go to galatians 3 7 hun i'm going to turn up uh i'm sorry i'm going to pull up genesis 12 3. i don't want you to forget this paul takes almost a whole chapter to explain what genesis 12 3 meant for abraham okay let me read genesis 12 3 leave that up there uh it says and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curses thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed okay that's a simple scripture we read it heard it many times but paul paul gives us the divine interpretation of this scripture this doesn't just mean jews right it just doesn't mean hebrews that will come out of abraham right this means all the families of the earth will be blessed okay so this is in chapter uh 3 of galatians paul now quotes this and it's amazing to see how much god put into this one verse in genesis 3. i'm sorry genesis 12 3 rather genesis 12 3. now i want you to see church anyone with faith in jesus christ is of the seed of abraham praise god look at verse seven now let's i'm sorry let's read verse seven know ye therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of abraham how many are of faith are you of faith are you of unbelief i'm a faith i'm a faith child got any faith children here tonight i'm a child of faith i'm i'm a person of faith that means i don't act by what i see i act by what i believe amen i'm a child of faith praise god i didn't feel like coming to church tonight i was actually sleeping on the couch because i was kind of tired i took a little nap before church that's probably one reason we were kind of late i i didn't really feel like coming but i don't go based upon my feelings because now i feel pretty good amen i go by faith what god promises and god said if you assemble together more i'll meet you there praise god amen i don't live by what i see i live by faith i'm a child of faith amen hallelujah like when we spoken about your dad we just spoke to that mountain i didn't speak by what i saw it looked awful to what i saw or heard but i spoke by faith because i'm a child of faith amen hallelujah praise god now go to verse 9 so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful abraham four times paul says anyone with faith is a seed of abraham and if abraham called those things not as though they were that's what you and i must do as well but we must have a promise of god for it praise god we must have a promise like abraham had and quote that promise in other words we must have a promise that's real to us amen what's real to you tonight church what promises are real healing is healing real to you is salvation real to you it's holy ghost baptism real to you amen it's joy and peace and blessing and and all those statues of perfect man all the fruits of the spirit those should be real to you how about investing in your talents is that real to you all these blessings must be real to us just like they were real to abraham amen i'll say like this thank god a body change was real to abraham a body change will be real to us as well amen a body change to bring forth the promised son verse 26 now go to verse 26. there's four verses where paul says if you have faith you are a child of abraham four is the number of deliverance right or you could say a double confirmation brother brahms tells us that for ye are all children of god by faith in christ jesus remember faith is revelation right faith is also assurance our assurance is in christ jesus and that makes you a child of abraham and we're a children we're a child of god all of us are the children of god by faith in christ jesus praise god and the last one verse 29. galatians 3 29 and if ye be christ i like the if there right there's got to be if in other words you have to believe you have to surrender you have to be born again and if you be christ then ye are abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise so let me go back there how many seed of abraham do we have in here tonight well if you're the seed of abraham god is going to bless you he said i'm going to bless them that bless you curse them that curse you praise god that's what the bible says and the bible says you will be blessed and you will be a blessing to other people praise god that's a promise for your life you can you can claim that promise when you don't feel blessed you can say lord you promised i'd be blessed you promised if i had faith in christ i'm the seed of abraham so lord bless me amen let me see the blessings pour out from heaven you promise to do it bless me lord i'm claiming your promise just like abraham he claimed it even though he didn't see it lord i don't see it but i'm claiming it i'm claiming your blessing amen hallelujah thank god thank god we're into the promises of god we are part of that spiritual lineage of abraham so we can say like this with my daddy my great great great daddy he believed for 25 years and he finally got it he didn't give up after 24 he didn't give up after 20. he didn't give up after 15 or he didn't give up he kept believing until he received it and if my great great great daddy can do that i can do it too because i'm a child of his i'm just like him amen that's in my family lineage right if he did it i can do it too praise god we must not forget that church that we're brought into this family remember remember jesus said he said some of you will sit down with abraham isaac and jacob in the kingdom of god because i'm the god of the living not of the dead amen some of us are going to sit down right by some of these saints amen why because they're our family members amen i should be sitting by them because i got the same faith they got faith in christ amen it's true i'm of i have faith in jesus christ i'm a son of abraham praise god hallelujah i'm just now the son of snooki and ruby smith i'm a son of abraham i'm a son of god i'm joy heirs with christ amen i'm a joint inheritor with jesus christ we both inherit the blessings of god the father amen now i'm going to preach on that sometime a joint heir with christ i'm a co-inheritor with christ so see there are certain blessings that christ and you and i get just because we're human and we overcame this uh satan's eden down here praise god he overcame satan's enemy so did i praise god by his grace and so there's certain things we inherit that are equal praise god joint heirs i'm a joint i join in with that inheritance i want to study on that more and preach on that by god's grace joy heirs with christ because we're in the same family we're both trusting we're both trusting in god to get us through how many trusting in god the father to get you through amen trusting in your father tonight to get through well then you got to pray the same way if you're trusting and you've got to pray the same way lord not my will but thine be done that's right so there's four scriptures church if you're in christ you believe in christ you're you're a seed of abraham you're a seed and he said all nations all nations will be blessed see paul takes that one scripture genesis 12 3 and he expounds on it now here's the here's the highlight right here it's verse uh well i didn't write down but genesis 3 i have to go look for i didn't write it for some reason i can't believe i didn't write that down okay give me a moment it's right at the end of genesis chapter 3 i'm sorry galatians chapter 3. yeah forgive me i couldn't believe that there yeah verse 20 26 yeah we're all children of god by faith in christ jesus verse 27 for as many of you have been baptized into christ have put on christ there's neither jew nor greek there is neither bond nor free that there is neither male nor female for you're all one in christ jesus look at that all one male or female sisters you want to feel bad you have faith like sarah praise god right you have faith like hannah and jochebed and all these mighty women of god right zipporah we preached on that recently all these sisters that had mighty faith and were able to manifest the love of god in their lifetime we're all one in christ jesus we're all receiving the blessings of god through christ jesus now that wasn't the scripture though that's a good scripture that wasn't the one i was looking for here we'll read verse yeah okay we read verse 29 at the blessing of abraham that's what i'm looking for lydia do you see the blessing of abraham in chapter three oh there it is verse 13 14. sorry go to verse 13 and 14. i i use this scripture when we preach on the blessing and cursing series christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law aren't you glad church no curse rests on your life because i'm redeemed from the curse i don't have any curses because i'm redeemed from the curse being made a curse for us for it is written cursing is everyone that hangeth on the tree here it is that the blessing of abraham might come on the gentiles through christ jesus that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith amen what is that that's the baptism of the holy ghost what is the blessing of abraham the baptism of the holy ghost christ living in you the messiah taking up abode in you his permanent residence to live with you inside of you all the days of your life and all throughout eternity the spirit of god constantly dwelling constantly moving constantly guiding you into all truth oh thank the lord amen hallelujah this is the blessing of abraham because we're abraham's seed as many has been baptized into christ have put on christ and inherit all the blessings to the jew first and also the gentile the bible says praise god go to galatians chapter 4. galatians 4 now that i i'm sorry now i say that the heir as long as he's a child different nothing from a servant though he be lord of all but as under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father even so we when we were children we are in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem that we're under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because ye are sons god has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abba father therefore thou art no longer a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of god through christ hallelujah you are a full family member praise god right you can i say like this we kind of hire people to do jobs at our house right like we had the uh the granite guys come today right now do they go into our fridge and eat whatever they wanted did they hop in the car and drive the car on did they they hop on the lawn mower and drive the lawnmower around those guys why because they're not family members right same idea right we hire outside work they come in but do they have all the access and privileges like we got no because they're not family members but the bible says you were a servant but now you're a family member praise god now you have access to all of god's blessings amen god don't want you to feel strange coming to him god welcomes you and says god wants you to come it says come unto me all you that labor and heal me heavy laden i'll give you rest for your souls amen he's inviting us to come and experience the blessings and benefits of being a child amen we're no longer servants we're children of god we're adopted into the family and i like verse six brother rahm calls verse six paul verse six brother branham calls this the capstone revelation about the baptism of the holy ghost because it goes back to sovereignty because ye are sons god has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts cry abba father so this is speaking of foreknowledge god knew you were a son that's why you were born again amen in other words if you're born again you should have a lot of thankfulness in your heart and it should prove to you god has called me to faith god god has called me to this message god has called me to the rapture god has called me to the marriage supper of the lamb because i am born again amen that proves i am a child of god he knew beforehand that i want to receive it so he made a way i could receive it oh thank the lord amen oh it's a blessing church look at verse 29 galatians 4 29. well it seems like so so long ago i preached on that by actually it's going to 28 now we brother as isaac was are the children of promise but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now now some of our people in the church can relate to this if you're being persecuted we kind of talked about it recently when you're being persecuted that's a very good sign that you're a child of god especially when you're being persecuted by church members right if you're being persecuted by church members the one who is doing the persecuting is normally the one who's not the one that's born again it's usually the the foolish virgin or the one who's a make believer right because the bible says the the children of the flesh persecute those that are the children of the spirit oh that's why the bible said rejoice when you're persecuted because that proves you're the child of god amen you're the blessed one in this situation you might not see it yet but the blessing's on the way praise god oh thank god hallelujah what a promise yep so when people call me pitiful like they do on youtube or life or they call me a sad condition i rejoice because i know i'm a child of god they're the ones persecuting me i know i'm standing on truth so i thank god that i can be the child of god i'm a child of promise and i can return their evil words with prayers of forgiveness hallelujah that's one thing they can't do right that's one thing they can do they can't show the love of christ and they can't receive remember jesus said that's one way you know they're not the children of god because they can't receive the spirit of truth right jesus said the world cannot receive it can you pull that up in uh john i believe it's john 17 whom the world cannot receive the spirit of truth it's not always in just the the signs miracles and wonders we got to have those and we thank god for those i'll pull it up there john yeah i'm sorry john 14 17. i'm sorry john 14 17. i knew there was a 17 in there see just the in any situation church when you can see the truth that proves you're being led by the right spirit praise god right john the baptist how many miracles did he do none but what spirit was he led by the holy spirit he preached the truth he told the pharisees they were a bunch of generation of vipers did he not he spoke the truth he recognized the two spirits in the framework of the church ah hallelujah praise god now we are called to do miracles right the church will do miracles so i'm not saying we don't have miracles what i'm saying is that we have the spirit of truth and in every situation we should be able to discern the right spirit against the wrong spirit look at that john 14 17 even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth them not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelt with you and shall be in you there's something about a christian can recognize the truth like even with the situation you know this family situation we had recently you know i was my wife and i were involved with that with some conversations there was just something that was on uh you know the anointing that's on my wife and i that we can just simply recognize truth things i mean just recognizing us a plain truth right something is this a liar is this wrong right sorry is this a liar is this true but there's something on a christian that can just recognize something that's the truth right no matter what a famous person says no matter what doctors say no matter what reports say no matter what famous people say it doesn't matter what they say it matters what the holy spirit says amen and when you are born again of the holy spirit you can receive the truth while other people can't receive the truth jesus said they cannot receive truth so it's so important to have the truth of god is anybody being blessed tonight praise god these are all your privileges the blessing of abraham upon you the blessings of being born again the bible says all these blessings are upon you you are a child you are a child of promise so what promise do you need tonight what promise are you trusting in what promise has god given us in the word of god that you believe is for you when you're a child of god you hang on to that promise despite the situation right despite the circumstances praise god i think i'll stop right there i'm right about it 45 minutes because if not i have to start something else and i have to jump in something else here the blessings of god how many thankful for the blessings of god i'm going to go real quick here uh yeah musicians you can come here since i'm in galatians yeah let's go right over there church there is something about you and i being made new constantly we are new creatures in christ jesus if we don't feel new something's wrong with our mind we stopped get we stopped laying ourselves on the altar of sacrifice because we're a living sacrifice look at galatians 6 verse 15. i remember using this numerous times for in christ jesus neither circumcision availed anything nor uncircumcision but a new creature what is god looking for in our life god is looking for us to be made new we're constantly being made new in our thought life right and what are we thinking about we're thinking about the promises of god hallelujah we're think we are not remember jesus said don't let your uh don't build up your treasures on this earth storm treasure's in heaven praise god the only thing that counts is that we become new in christ every day right as children of abraham just like abraham abraham as he got closer to the promise he started having more changes he was dead and his physical body was dead sarah's womb was dead but as they got closer to the promise they got closer to being changed and pretty soon they started changing and pretty soon a 90 year old woman looks beautiful grandma don't look so much like the gray hair anymore grandma's got that nice black hair back as they got closer to the promise the promises became more real praise god and church as we go close to the promises we become new creatures and we start to see the changes the reality of the changes in our lives amen we start acting more like christ we start acting more like the rapture's coming praise god because we're not falling away we're not we're not getting cold on god we're pressing toward the mark of the high calling we're blessed not cursed amen we see abundance in our lives we see the spirit of god blessing our lives not chastening our lives let's stand to our feet here so what promise are you hanging on tonight church what promise here's some good ones the fruits of the spirit now you might have healing in there too right you might have the salvation of loved ones which we've even prayed about tonight let's remember to pray for israel but the fruit of the spirit is love how many need that promise having any trouble loving anybody joy how about that that's a fruit peace peace in our hearts long suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law can you pull it up there real quick so that people can see that verses 5 22 and 523 galatians we are children of promise which means many things church we've been promised but we don't see it yet how many times have you prayed haven for a lost friend guess what you're children of your child of promise you still believe it amen we're children of promise we're not children of a flesh well i've got to feel something i've got to see something to believe it now sometimes you need that right sometimes sometimes you need that but overall we should be children of faith that we see it with different eyes right hey when we don't see what the natural we see with the spiritual eyes as eagles were able to rise up like the eagle right and see long we can see afar off amen i see that god is going to answer because i'm a child of abraham amen amen it's a promise in his word he promised it and so we must see which promises apply to us we're not children of the flesh we're not children of uh of shortcomings right we're not children of unbelief we're children of faith so i guess we'll just close with that how many want to be encouraged praise god how many want to keep confessing the promises of god that's what abraham did and i love it god always came around to encourage him whenever he fell short just like tonight if you were discouraged by any any means tonight i hope you'll leave here encouraged because the holy spirit will come from time to time to encourage our hearts and remember you're not a you're not a child of sight you're a child of faith and that's real sight praise god that's the real spiritual sight amen the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law praise god so church look at the promises of god which one do we have need of tonight these are all promises i may not be totally manifesting it now but i've got a promise and i'm hanging on to that promise i told brother i told brother amen i'm going to preach a little message called uh what the i am says i am because we've seen that song well i've heard the people in psalms sing i am who i am because the i am tells me who i am right it's kind of a that's the bridge or whatever more that's the bridge but i like that thought that's a good thought i am what the i am says i am if he says i'm a child of promise i'm a child of promise right see they've tapped into so many truths but they don't know what they got but we we should know what we've got amen but see the devil fights us so hard we sometimes we forget and sometimes with them with the other groups that's all they do is think about what they got and they forget about what they need to get rid of we've gotten rid of a lot church amen right i can look at my pictures when i was younger i got rid of god's got rid of a lot out of my life a lot of the flesh moved out of my life but see they don't have that but they're still looking for all the blessings the promises but we've got a cleaned out life plus amen i like that plus we have cleaned out life plus the promises of god to come hallelujah thank you jesus see some of them will sing songs like oh yeah we're going to be the bride and but then they got homosexuals amongst them that ain't the bride they're going to be disappointed right because they preach and allow that or they got women preachers they're going to be disappointed or those all those women cut their hair right and they're singing about going to meet god well they're going to meet god at the white throne judgment look at that church they're look they can sing so beautiful can't they sister to help me they can sing so beautiful about going to meet god but they cut their hair and they're wearing makeup and they cross-dress and wear a bottle of things they're singing our songs amen they're singing about our blessings praise god but we ought to have the reality of it that that's all that promise in the bible is really a bible promise and that's for us amen that's for us they're singing a song for us now some of them can come out of those systems right they can come out of them and they can make that song real thank the lord i'm so thankful to be a child of god in this hour praise god let's bow our heads for a word of prayer church what promise are you believing in what are you still hanging on right now what are you hanging on for we're halfway through the year almost think about that we are almost halfway through 2021. where is this time gone what promise are you still hanging on is it just as

hallelujah praise god royal seed of abraham hallelujah a spiritual seed i'm just like him i've got the blessings i've got the patience i've got the promise let's start seeing ourselves as abraham and sarah can we do that jacob isaac rebecca let's see ourselves as some of these that inherit the promises praise god i'm a modern day abraham i am nature god sent me away from my family he said separate yourself from lot he didn't tell me he did him himself and he moved me away from my family away from my kindred that i would serve god i'm the only one my wife we can relate to that we're children of promise and we do exactly what the lord tells us to do let's pray together heavenly father we thank you for tonight lord you made us children of the promise that we would have obedience father we're

heart tonight that they are like abraham they're like sarah they will inherit the promises of god and lord as the scripture said sarah receives strength hey lord may each believer receive strength to conceive the promises of god hallelujah may they receive it tonight lord god amen may they be strengthened tonight in your divine presence in your holy spirit presence dear god bless them i pray
