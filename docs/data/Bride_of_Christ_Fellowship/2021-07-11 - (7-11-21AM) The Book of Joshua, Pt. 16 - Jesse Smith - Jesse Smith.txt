========================================

verses one to six then we have a memory verse uh sister who is turning to the memory verse so thank you for giving us the memory verse out of jeremiah 29 let's start with joshua chapter six please i'm sorry josh chapter 10 rather joshua chapter 10 please now i'll read verses one to six and then i will read uh jeremiah 29 together now came to pass when adonai zedek heard or king of jerusalem had heard how joshua had taken ai and utterly destroyed it as he had done to jericho and her king so he had done to ai in her king and how the inhabitants of gibeon had made peace with israel and were among them that they feared greatly because gibbon was a great city as one of the royal cities and because it was greater than ai and all the men thereof were mighty wherefore adonai zedek king of jerusalem sent unto ho ham king of hebron and unto pyram king of lakish and unto dibir king of aglan saying come up unto me and help me that we may smite gibeon for it hath made peace with joshua and with the children of israel therefore the five kings of the amorites the king of jerusalem the king of hebron the king of jarmath the king of lakish and the king of egon gathered themselves together went up they in all their hosts and then camped before gibeon and made war against it and the men of gibeon sent unto joshua to the camp to gilgal saying slack not thy hand and thy servants come up to us quickly and save us and help us for all the kings of the amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us amen let's go to jeremiah 29 verse 11. jeremiah 21 11. 11 12 and 13 so some beautiful scriptures i think we looked at these a few months ago what uh what an assurance that we have in christ god knows our beginning god knows our end he knows the hairs on our head he knows all the number of our days what a blessing to know this about our heavenly father jeremiah 29 read 11 12 and 13. let's begin on three one two three for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end then ye shall call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart praise god let's have a word of prayer you have a need on your heart let's just make it known unto god here today by raising up our hand or acknowledging the prayers of the saints today heavenly father lord we just join in prayer today lord we know there's power in community prayer lord god as they the saints prayed for peter and you come out of prison lord god as hezekiah and the saints cried out to you lord you gave them victory over their enemies lord so father we know there's power in prayer so father we just thank you lord god that you hear our request lord god we thank you god that lord uh you know the thoughts you think toward us and their thoughts of peace lord these these were thoughts lord to israel when they were slaves lord how much more us that are free how much more are your thoughts of good for us who are free by the blood of jesus christ having left the world of the abominations of this world in this age serving you lord how much more are your thoughts unto us by the blood of jesus christ lord we we consider this a privilege to be in your household we ask you anoint me anoint your people lord god may we feel your presence the holiness of jesus christ this morning father god speak to us and bless us and help us today we're all depending on you lord god and father lord help us to seek you lord god as you you constantly draw us closer to you lord god it is not by our works or our merits but it's your holy spirit drawing us you are the first mover you are the initiator you are the creator oh god and lord you're drawing us in your love to you may we seek you may we respond to your love call where we respond to your invitation as we approach the communion in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god have you started the live stream yet okay that's fine just by a show of hands how many how many need to do communion after the first service could you raise your hand if you just want to do after the first service okay okay praise god so we'll do that happy to do that i thank the lord for all the saints in the house of lord today praise god i'd like to look at the day the sun stood still i like to preach on that today that's kind of what this chapter is about i have some slides here and we'll uh preach here by the grace of the lord thank you for your prayers we had to travel on friday and uh yesterday to see our family my mom you know she's 70 and she wanted to do another meal with the family so i haven't seen her license uh since the new year i think she had a major surgery she had female trouble at major surgery but she seemed to be doing really well and i said there's about 30 or 40 of our family members there i heard cam witnessing cam was witnessing the family members and i didn't really get a chance to witness to too many people but we didn't get a chance to pray for my cousin he was an awful car accident back in december he's still walking in the lymph he's younger than me he's like 35 or something like that we were able to pray for him i was able to point the scripture i showed in the scripture confess your faults one to another and the bible says call me out of the church and you'll be healed and so i told put your confidence in that word i know he's been backslidden i wrote him a letter after the accident and he apologized never got back to me but i said no problem man you're going through surgeries and get stitches all over his face and everything but we're shining the light of jesus and praying for them and so thank you for your prayers it was just a nice trip and great to see the family by the grace of the lord so in joshua chapter 10 we'll look at this thought you know look at the day the sun stand stood still and we'll try to preach this chapter today by the grace of god i'll try to watch my time here because i know um do you have work tonight stephen do you have work oh you were gonna stay okay we'll praise the lord all right hallelujah thank the lord so um we'll try to just look at this thought here and then tonight we'll look at a different thought so we'll look at the day the sun stands still uh this was a quite a day some people call this the very pinnacle of joshua's ministry uh and it's because he spoke to the sun and the moon and they uh literally stood still literally stood still now brother branham has a different take everybody's got a kind of different take on this on how the sun stood still but the point is that that day god hearkened to the prayer of a man right and and god was just approving joshua god was basically blessing joshua and vindicating joshua as a faithful leader praise god and how many want to see god bless and vindicate your life praise god that's i think that's every every warrior every christian warrior's desire is to see god eventually reward all your years of service right and somehow just you know show you your destiny for your life and just give you just a great testimony that you can you can realize wow that was god's will god wanted to do something great in my life and i can see what god did in my life you know i was i shared this example a few weeks ago but the queen of sheba her great the great testimony jesus is going to use on the day of judgment is that she crossed a a a thiefful desert right a desert full of thieves and robbers she risked her life and her whole uh her whole reputation she risked everything to cross that hot desert she risked her health her life her money she risked everything just to hear thus saith the lord and jesus said that's what she's going to be used for on the day of judgment that was her one great uh act of life where where everything was building up to that and after that moment she was never the same praise god right because then she got in the presence of the holy ghost praise god and she said i have no more questions the holy ghost has answered all my requests praise god and she could return to her people a changed woman praise god and jesus said that's what you'll be used against i will use a women a woman one woman against thousands of jewish priests that turned down a greater than solomon that wouldn't cross uh the land of palestine that wouldn't cross a city remember jesus on the night he was arrested he told the you know after after all the all the armed guards fell down they stood back up and he says why do you come out against me with all these spears wasn't i daily in the temple teaching the people god was so humble all those look how close god was god was sitting in the porch of solomon right there by herod's temple and all the pharisees had to do was walk a few yards to hear someone greater than solomon but they wouldn't do it so god is going to raise up a woman who crossed an entire desert risk her life spent months on the road traveling extra distances god will raise up that woman to condemn those unbelievers you should we should thank god that we're believers today praise god and in our trials we should be able to say lord thank you for allowing this it's going to give me a testimony on the day of judgment praise god i am tested for a testimony for god i very well preached that was brother diggs right got him coming september and i was texting him about that this week i just sent him a text i was going over my book and i came to the part where i i quote brother this in the book and i say a picture friend of mine brother diggs says it well he says we are tested for a testimony i said brother diggs i just want to tell you you're on page 294 in my book or whatever and it's a brother that means so much to me he said because right now he's being tested so just pray for brother dick his wife has left the message and divorced him i don't know if you knew that that happened a few years ago but i just want to tell you and he said i have lived off that statement all these years that his wife has been gone he is going through a test but it's for a testimony now look at look how god may use brother dick this may be the greatest trial of his life he was already healed of brain cancer church and we would have thought no we would think that was what god will use him for now god may do that but god may also use it when someone so close to you forsakes christ but you have to cling you still have to stay true you still have to worship with no one else in worship god may use him for that see church we don't know the story of our song many times till later like that psalm says we may we may not understand it better until by and by praise god but one thing's for sure he's going to answer all of our questions over there he will dissolve all of our doubts over there praise god but here let us show our love and our faithfulness and our devotion let us do what we feel led by the holy spirit for god will use it god is pleased when we're tested that we overcome it's the story of your life no one has a story just like nobody has a fingerprint like you right no one has a dna just exactly like you everybody has a special blueprint on this life and you're going to make a special mark that nobody else can make that mark right in your family nobody else can make that testimony and maybe in your church nobody else can have that testimony like you can have so see the thing to do is trust jesus christ trust him with all your heart lean not upon upon your own understanding but in all your ways acknowledge him and he will make your past straight glory and so i just want to encourage you that you know joshua had one of the greatest victories ever of his life on this day such a marvelous day and can i say it like this it was a day that had the most sunlight he ever experienced or any man ever born on that ever lived in that entire time that was the day with the most sunlight there ever was there'd never been a day that long i know in alaska or whatever they have days that are long sunlight but they never according to the bible they never had a day with this much sunlight as joshua had praise god amen it was a special day it was a highlight day praise god it was one of those uh days where god god did something that was totally unexpected praise god because there was a need for the army of god there's a need for the people of god how many god needs today praise god and god can meet your need today and if not just hang on he never promised the exact time to do it but he said i will do it i'll be faithful i will finish what i started amen hallelujah now uh in joshua chapter six we were ten we keep saying six chapter 10 we we read our texts here now let's read and i already read one through six i'm not going to read it but i'll just review it here the jared jerusalem's king at adonai zadek feared israel greatly notice he's he's afraid he's heard about jericho he's heard about gibby or i'm sorry ai and now he's heard about the gibeonites surrendering to israel now in church these were mighty men right gibeonites were mighty men in the bible says so he rallies four other kings to try to destroy the gibeonites it's interesting he doesn't go against israel he's trying to go against the servants of israel he's too afraid to fight god's army so he goes against the servants of god's army right that's how satan is satan can't attack god so he goes against his servants would you just remain faithful god will fight for you praise god just like this show this shows god will fight for you praise god amen now see they were previously a great royal city look at verse 2. gibbon was a great city one of the royal cities there's a few cities in the promised land that were greater than others and gibeon was one of those cities and they were not full of cowardly men they were full of mighty men right gibeon was full of mighty men but these mighty men had enough respect for god that they realized we cannot defeat jehovah these other gods we've defeated but this one can't be defeated you don't want to fight that guy you don't want to fight that god in battle amen he's a man of war praise god he'll do all kinds of things right we heard about egypt uh he'll turn water to blood he'll send swarms of locusts praise god he'll smite you it'll smite you with all kinds of plagues boils he'll kill all your cattle this god is he's just untouchable we don't don't mess with that god they had enough wisdom to know you do not mess with god's elect praise god don't mess with this god but as we saw last week god was so rich in mercy praise god and god save the gimme nights and i do want to make a correction last week i said something a little wrong so forgive me you know i tend to do that i'm human you know so forgive me and if i make a mistake you can always try to correct me by god's grace but i i made the mention how uh the ark stayed at gibeon until the days of uh solomon but that wasn't right the act the ark actually moved a few times it moved from gibeon to shiloh so some of you may remember that right i got that out of easton's bible dictionary so that's where my source was so and i'd forgotten about shiloh right i i knew that ark was at shiloh i knew that you know i just i forgot because i'm not perfect i can't remember everything just so you know i just want to make a little correction there the ark wasn't gibeon for a while but then it was also shiloh but it was true that when god met solomon he met solomon at gibeah or gibeon and that was a great place and that's where they brought in the days of solomon that's where they brought the vessels of the house of god and all the instruments they brought them out of gibeon to solomon's temple after it was finished uh i believe it was 13 years to finish if i'm not mistaken or was it seven i can't remember which one of us might have been seven uh yeah about probably seven so uh here we see that uh the gibeonites were uh uh a people that fear the lord and we saw last week even god was willing to forgive people even if they they were kind to god's people right god forgave the giving knights 440 some years of sin and god had already pronounced judgment on them but because they came and and they they humbled themselves before god god forgave them that sounds an awful lot like matthew 25 right and they even got forgiven through deception but because they didn't look here because they didn't fight against god because they didn't fight against god god forgave them over 440 years of wicked abomination that's why god was wiping out that's why he's going to wipe out all these kings today we'll see it he wipes out all these kings because they're abominations their wickedness that they've done but because the gibberish just asked for mercy and they feared god and they didn't want to die god spares them and makes them wood choppers and water hewers for the house of god so that's interesting and i may preach on that later as i've at church it's just been i've always speculated in my mind about matthew 25 there is jesus going to grant people salvation just by being kind to his brethren without repentance or not i don't know in the past i thought maybe he'd do it without repentance then i thought well he's had to use repentance so it's just one of those mysteries but here but the reason i thought that is because look the gimme nights they're given life just because they didn't fight against god's people they're giving the entire leash on life because they don't fight against god's people let's be careful with our words let's not fight against god's people amen let's be like david we'll touch not god's anointing even if people even if god used somebody one time and they fail to use them again uh uh we won't say anything about it we'll just pray for them to repat praise god now of course we'll rebuke false prophets and all that kind of stuff like that we're not talking about that we're talking about people that backslide like saul was so he was always a real warrior for god for a number of years but then he backs them with a murderous spirit he never falls prophesied he was you know he was eventually saved the bible said samuel said you'll be with me tomorrow in paradise right he was eventually saved because he repented at the end of his life but we don't want to fight against god's anointed praise god we want to fight for god's anointed amen now uh verse i'm sorry i want to give you the the the picture so so israel crossed the red sea of the mighty miracle they camp at gilgal and joshua says we need circumcision this this army needs a permanent separation from the reproach of egypt right and then after that then they go to jericho they walk around 13 times get the victory and then they say oh we'll just take ai with 3 000 men right and then they they don't consult their lord and so then they they got to go back to gilgal they got to repent and so they got they got to clean out aiken sin then they go back at a great victory right then the gibby knights come and deceive them i'm sorry they're coming to see them that gilgal okay well now we're at the spot where jerusalem's king adenizadek hears about the giving knights surrendering and so he gathers these four other armies these five so five total kings come against the people of god in church don't ever forget with god you and god are a majority this was a tiny army compared to these five nations of mighty men these were these were warriors these were heathen these were scary people these were demon-possessed people but as long as they had the ark of god as long as they had all the sin out of their lives god was going to fight for them and no man would they will be able to stand before them all the days of their life praise god church i don't care what the what the what the odds are i don't care if it's five armies against one with mary magdalene it was seven devils against jesus and jesus cast out all those seven devils amen with legion it was 12 000 against one and jesus said go and the 12 000 had to go whenever god's presence is with you you're more than a conqueror amen numbers never scare god they scare us and we need to look beyond the numbers right and we know see with eyes of faith that god is for me he's not against me god is with me he's going to help me he's going to deliver me as long as jesus is on my side god will work it out amen so don't really matter and look daniel it was one man and daniel was praying against all those demons in heaven and one great demon called the prince of persia but because daniel kept praying daniel kept praying kept believing god used daniel's prayer to send over michael and michael come up and fight against and wrestle with the prince of persia and overcame this this chief devil praise god so if there's chief devil church let's just keep praying keep believing our god breaks every chain our god is the mighty conqueror he does great things we must stay in the channel of prayer because remember you are his beloved just like daniel was his beloved praise god roman says the people that were not his beloved have caught become his beloved amen he'll fight for you church hallelujah so see whether it's 12 000 5 7 whatever it is as long as jesus is with you you got the victory praise god you're going to get the victory hallelujah now verses six to eight and the men of gibeon verse six set unto joshua to the camp of guild wars gilgal saying slack not thy hand from thy servants come up to us quickly and save us and help us for all the kings the amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us now notice it's god's servants saying uh army of god can you come rescue us come help us lord will you help us fear surrounding we are overwhelmed can you say hell but just imagine god saying oh i can't wait to send him i've been waiting 440 years to do this right he was waiting 440 years to clean the land amen to purge the land the bible said the land was crying out to god there's so much wickedness done here the land was crying out the blood of all the innocent people was calling out saying god cleanse the land and god's saying it's time i'm going to deliver my people i'll help anybody that wants help amen hallelujah whether you're a gibbonite or an israeli whether you're a gentile or jew whether you're just just repenting yesterday or you've been a servant in the army lord all the days of your life amen or most the days your life right so much to raise the house of god we thank god for that verse seven so joshua ascended from gilgal he and all the people war with them and all the mighty men of valor and the lord said unto joshua fear them not for i've delivered them into thine hand there shall not a man of them stand before thee now notice according to the bible the bible places it as joshua hears about their cry for help so joshua starts going and then the bible says on his day he's the lord so see some you know many times you know uh we understand that if if we see there's somebody we can help we just need to go move to help them and then maybe on the way god will give us some fresh inspiration or something but see god and joshua to move he wouldn't see joshua take the word and act on it and go help my brothers because he knew if god spared the giving nights and now they're getting attacked well god would want to spare them god would want to save them god wouldn't save you to have you killed right god would save you to protect you and joshua found something good he could do for the people of god so church when we find something we can do for the people of god let's do it amen because that's what joshua did and this is the day where the greatest miracle happened in his life when he was what helping others he wasn't even protecting israel church he wasn't even protecting his own wife and kids and his own family it was protecting the servants of god because of this just the foolish verses just like abraham allah i didn't hear you praise god abraham defeated four kings amen when he went out to rescue lot church god is in the rescuing business amen god is in the business of saving people against all odds god's ones god wants to save god wants to deliver god wants to show his strong hand in our lives amen oh that's beautiful first night i don't know i'm sure wait i'm not sure if i finished verse eight he said fear not for i've delivered them into thy hand there shall not a man of them stand before thee not one of those men will stand before you verse nine joshua therefore came unto them suddenly and went up from gilgal all night okay so i just kind of skipped in extra verse so give me night setting for help right joshua ascends and the lord assures him you're going to get the victory church eternal life is living for others joshua says i'm going to live for my wood choppers i'm going to live for my water packers in other words for us we're going to live for the people who clean the toilets right we're going gonna live for the people that serve us food all right that we're gonna live for we'd say the lowest of the low right or the the most humble the meekest of the meek the low we should live with eternal life live for other people who don't have it off as good as we do that's beautiful church that's beautiful notice god's response he's going to help his servants joshua's army was the true church right gibby knights they were just servants you see can i say like this you'll find the greatest blessings when you're serving people that are less than you now i say poor than you or i'll say like this don't know as much about god as you you'll find the greatest blessings in condescending yourself right the bible says condescend yourself to men of lower estate you see when we serve other people and help other people that's actually god working through us to show eternal life and to bring a great victory in people's lives amen this is beautiful what a testament no wonder god honored his word look he's fighting for other people that can't defend themselves he's fighting for the oppressed amen he's fighting for the outnumbered amen he's fighting for some new believers praise god he's fighting for them and no wonder god hears his prayer praise god now verse 9 and 10. i already read nine they went up suddenly by night look at night it was a night attack i'm sorry they traveled by night verse 10 and the lord discomforted them before israel and slew them with the great slaughter of gibeon and chased them along the way that goethe up to beth horan and smote them at asaka and untop makida now notice church look at this they come suddenly they trap after traveling i i didn't mean training i met traveling all night and the lord discomforts the enemy now look they walked 15 miles in one night see we complain if we got to drive 15 miles on a detour out of the way but they these were such warriors under the anointing of god they traveled by night 15 miles and they use a surprise attack to get the advantage don't you like how god does it every battle's different right with jericho they just sit out there here we are we're gonna walk around we're gonna torment you to the end right with ai they did the ambush remember that they sent some people in brought out all the people and then the ambush came in the other way well here it's just a surprise attack right at night early in the morning surprise attack oh it's war time god knows how to do it every time church let's ask god to show us wisdom how to do it praise god how can i get the victory lord show me how to get the victory guide me help me to use your word give me your wisdom praise god because i know all your ways are in wisdom wisdom hath building the house praise god has seven pillars amen now look their obedience gives them the power it's in church this is what we're always going to see the obedience to the word of god always brings the victory that's the only way to assure you that you're going to get the victory obedience is not legalism obedience is love jesus said if you love me keep my commands right legalism is adding to the word like oh you got to be circumcised or you got to have long sleeves on all the time or this i mean just nonsense oh you can't wear a beard if you're a man i mean come on show me that in the word they they can't they can't uh can't back up any of these false doctrines and these legalistic ideas in the word of god but see obedience is always going to get the blessing now church remember god had given him the power to slay their enemies as he had promised at mount ebal now we preached on that about three or four weeks ago remember after ai they got the victory after the ambush and remember moses had them stand between two mountains remember that two mountains he had the ark in here and then he read deuteronomy 27 and 28 he read all the blessings and all the people would shout amen after each blessing and then he read all the curses and all the people on this side would shout amen after all the curses so these promises are freshly on their mind what a picture church that we see the word that we hear every week should be freshly on our mind so when we go out to the battle we'll be able to quote it and remember and overcome by the word of god see they just heard all these promises you'll defeat your enemies if you keep the word just love god with all your heart you will defeat all the enemies and so they're able to use that in battle shortly thereafter see god gives us a word in due season hallelujah amen so be careful church be careful what you're hearing and make sure you apply it to your lives like over the years we've had so many people backside and fall away but the word that was coming was telling them to be more devoted to the word right be devoted to your home church pray fast read your bible spend time with god right be faithful respect the fivefold ministry and you know all these simple things give give alms right help out the poor and yet people will turn those down they turn down pre-sermons about fasting they've turned down sermons about uh seeking god or getting the baptism of the holy ghost how many sermons have we preached on the baptism holy ghost and yet it just it goes one in ear out the other they don't apply the bible says you must mix the word with faith amen god is not a mixer with sin and unbelief but god is a mixer with the word and faith oh hallelujah thank god amen see so we feel bad when people don't take the word of god but it's not as if they haven't been told they have been told right you've heard the word so you're acting on it you're overcoming with it what makes you different from them you've loved god you heard the word and you mix it with faith so when you went out of church you didn't forget what you heard you kept quoting that word believing that word and you conquered in jesus name and ultimately we know he conquered for us right we're not going to get any we're not going to get any credit we don't want any credit but this is what it's all about the obedience remember the scripture church this was the scripture should come to pass if thou shalt hearken dealt you into the voice of the lord thy god to observe and do all his commandments which i command you this day that the lord thy god will set thee on high above all the nations of the earth now look they just said went over this a few maybe days or weeks ago at mount evol and god said blessed shall thou be when thou come us in and blessed art thou and now go us out now look josh was going out to help the giving night so god's gonna bless him see when you're going out to help somebody god's gonna bless you to help somebody see because you're diligently harking you're keeping the words of god and god's gonna use that and he's gonna exalt you in honor above other people like sinners right that's what he said i'm gonna exalt you above all the nations people are gonna know your life is a real christian life yeah you'll have some persecutions you have some people not like you you will have some of that but the majority of people in your life they will see honor for you because you're under the power of god you've got a different spirit than they got you don't got the spirit of american idol you don't got the spirit of netflix you got the holy spirit praise god amen you got the spirit of truth you speak the truth you speak the word you've got a different spirit on you just like joshua and caleb praise god you're a different breed amen hallelujah because you're obeying the word of god see joshua people remember this they were going out they kept all the word of god the lord will cause thine enemies to rise up against you to be smitten before thy face they shall come out against thee one way and flee before these seven ways that's exactly what happened this isn't the story they scattered all over they defeat these five armies they scatter they kill most of them there's a few that get away and they go off into these different fence cities and everything like that but joshua said we'll get them later we got most of them today praise god we'll get the rest later he had many more battles coming up the church let's take courage this morning by the grace of god that if let's just make sure we are diligently hearkening onto the word of god amen remember you don't chase the blessings the blessings chase you you chase the heart of god amen you chase the word of god you spend more time in this word and then don't worry about the blessings god's blessings will find you on the way to your battle praise god just like they did joshua he said the lord said not a man will stand before you in this entire battle yep five armies that's thus saith the lord joshua okay i believe it how many believe god saith the lord see we've got to make sure it's not saith the lord praise god now next one verse 11 joshua 10 11. i didn't put a bookmark in here let me turn to the bookmark and it came to pass as they fled from before israel that they were going down to bethlehem that the lord cast great stones from heaven upon them unto asaka and they died there were more which died with hail stones than they whom the children of israel slew with the story first look at this you have all these armies running away and god is like throwing darts kind of knocking these people off can you picture that israel's chased them so you ever seen a chase before and these guys are getting hit with the hailstones but israel's not i mean god god's word is going to come to pass if he said i'm going to drive him out he's going to drive him out if he said he'll protect you in church he'll protect you praise god amen so god was throwing the hailstones that one that one that was and god was doing that god was aiming at them god knows how to defeat our enemies amen he knows just like he knows where you are he knows right where they are and god is perfect with his targets amen i didn't hear you praise god you imagine you're chasing after them all of a sudden this huge hailstone comes out and just destroys this crowd of people there you are saying with your sword well praise god let's go get some others you know that's just what it was like they were just falling from the skies one after another god was trying to show them something praise god god was trying to show them that yeah you killed a few with your sword but i'm gonna kill the majority of them with the hailstones in other words i'm the one fighting for you you're winning this because i'm fighting for you praise god i'll let you have a little taste of the battle but it's really not you doing it it's god doing it god is driving out your enemies god is for you god is with you god is the conqueror see he was showing his strong hand to save them he wanted them to see without question god was the reason they got the victory god didn't want him going home you know wiping their swords all the blood and said look how strong look how strong these arms are i killed 50 with this one i killed 50 with that i mean god didn't want him to do that obviously you can't really taste the victory but the main victory come from me because you honored me i bless your going out and i bless your coming in because you've diligently hearkened under the voice of god right some of you we went through our testimonies last summer right in every testimony you gave was it ever you that did it it was no it was never us that did it we just waited on the lord right we were just there when he did it praise god and if there was any time it looked like we might have did it it was just because god had possessed our mind he and spoken his words and moved our hands and done something like that it was always god god is all and god is in all amen it's not by our efforts we're not saved by grace church i'm sorry we're not saved by work sorry we are saved by grace we're not saved by works now we talk a lot about works but that's because once you're saved you should have so much gratitude that you want to do something for god and jesus is going to hold you accountable he's going to say mj i gave you five talents i gave you two towns i gave you one town and mj wants to say lord i was faithful with it right so see there's something about yeah we need to get up about it and do some work let's be up and at it if god has given me these talents i want to invest it but i'm not saved because i'm investing in that i'm going to be blessed because i'm investing in that praise god i'm saved by grace i'm saved by the cross i'm saved because a holy man took my place a sinner's place a holy man became a sinner that a sinner might become holy praise god that's why i'm saved not by my works but by his works of righteousness i just read titus i finished titus this morning titus talks about over and over how you need to have good works he said show yourself a pattern of good works you know what a pattern is a pattern of repeats look at johnny's tie my tie look at the patterns on on the clothes a pattern repeats so we need to have a pattern of good works in other words on monday we're doing good tuesday we're doing it don't skip wednesday wednesday do good go to church all right or listen live stream thursday new good friday every day show a pattern of good works that's what a thankful gra a grateful christian will do they'll constantly show god thanks and praise as a pattern of their love and appreciation for him praise god oh my so many people stumble at the faith versus works but anybody with any sense knows we are all saved by grace and then if we have faith the bible says faith works dead faith is not faith at all right but faith that's real works and helps out the poor helps out the cold people it feeds the poor you know things like that it's easily settled if you understand god's amazing grace now just so you know church this is one of the i was listening to uh listening to jehovah's witness in church they're not even guaranteed salvation they have to go to so many numbers of doors like their wording in their creed is if you don't keep constantly increasing in your number of doors you visit they said if you do that then you're assured eternal life if if you fall away you're lost now look at that that's why they go to you go to your doors now during cover they didn't come to our doors but they sent us a letter so they must have got permission from their false prophets oh it's okay this year there's coven you you need to be scared of chronovirus and don't go to people's doors so you can write them letters and i'm going to write i say that letter for a year i'm going to write her back or maybe i'll go visit their church sometime but see their their in their creeds they're not assured salvation because it's based upon works but ours that's what makes real christianity different it's not based upon anything you can do all you've got to do is believe believe in the son of god believe in the blood that was shed except his gift amen just receive his pardon receive his gift and you have eternal life amen your name is on the book of life in heaven that wasn't in my notes but i thought i preached after joshua 10 12. then spake joshua to the lord in the day when the lord delivered up the amorites before the children of israel and he said in the sight of his name look he's all in front of everybody he said son stand still i'm sorry stand thou still upon gibeon and thou moon in the valley of agile so he was out one of those days where the sun was up and the moon was still out too and so he must have been there fighting maybe in front of everybody and all of a sudden he just shouts son stand still moon stay in the valley of agilent well the ram said he didn't ask permission and say lord could you please i'll show you the quotes in just a minute he didn't ask for permission he just spoke what he needed right now verse 13 and the sun stood still and the moon stayed until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies it's not this written the book of jasher so the son stood in the midst of the heaven and hastened not to go down about a whole day and there was no day like that before or after it that the lord hearkened on the voice of a man for the lord fought for israel now i said look the lord gave joshua this public testimony now notice moses didn't even have this kind of a gift now brother rahm said joshua had a harder commission than moses lebron said that and as i was with moses i'm not sure about that but that's what he said now it might be true because god gives joshua even a greater miracle there was other waters that were parted right like just like joshua there were other times you know the moon would not so the sun would not shine and and plagues and everything there was all kinds of things like that but here god never did this for moses he only did it for joshua and this was a proof that god was fighting for them see god sometimes church he'll give us testimonies so we know he's fighting for us now look at this church there was never a day like that ever again so all joshua's life he could point back to that day and say god heard our prayers that was a tremendous testimony i'll always know god is with me because of what he did right there praise god he never did that i never saw that in moses's ministry i never saw that in anyone else's ministry that was a special gift to us in our generation amen hallelujah praise god now remember brother branham types this uh to blind bartimaeus there was a blind man in the bible and he kept he said jesus he said lord jesus heal us right heal us there was actually a couple of blind men crying out i'm sorry was it uh leprous weren't they lepers yeah i'm sorry blind no it's blind blind monomers i'm sorry i think there's two stories where there you have you have uh blind people crying out to jesus then you have lepers crying out jesus sorry but blind bartimaeus he cries out for healing and the crowd says shut up shh he's busy but he cries out all the more and he said son of man son of david have mercy on me and brother man dramatizes that jesus is walking and when he hears that loud cry the son stands still and he says what do you want and he says my sight and jesus says you have it receive your sight and brother says this is just like joshua that you and i church when we crowd to god god will hear our prayers at times now at times not every time right we don't get everything we want but when we cry out to god god can stand still and it feels as if god is listening personally to you praise god and then god will give you what you have need of amen so brother uses joshua sun stands still to represent the s-o-n jesus christ standing still when we call upon god for help how many need is help at times amen aren't you glad he's just a call away praise god amen so that's one application that we have for the son standing still remember hezekiah wanted more time and got it so we know and actually time went backward in hezekiah's story let's go to that you got your bible second kings 20. second kings 20 kings kings and chronicles see god god had worked in time before he'd adjusted time now in verse one hezekiah is sick and verse two he then he turned his face to the wall and prayed to the lord and he asked for more years and then as soon as isaiah leaves the middle of the court the word lord comes to him in verse 4 and verse 5. he turns again to go back to hezekiah and said thus saith the lord the god of david i've heard that prayer i've seen thy tears behold i will heal thee on the third day thou shalt go up to the house of the lord now hezekiah asked for a sign and look at verse 11 and isaiah the prophet cried in the lord and he brought the shadow 10 degrees backwards by which he had gone down the dial of hayas this was a sundial you ever seen a sundial it's just like a piece of stone or wood and then wherever the sun's at it sets a shadow on it well in the days of hezekiah god did something similar god move the shadow back a few hours right to give him a sigh that god was going to give hezekiah more years to live praise god so in other words god is the one who created time so god controls time amen he don't do it very often like with josh you only did it one time but here with hezekiah he makes the shadow move you ever moved a shadow no i never have god's the only one that could move a shadow because that works with the sun right god is the only one so here god works with nature with hezekiah again showing that he's the same yesterday today and forever and church we must redeem the time praise god but don't forget i will restore all the years of renewing time he can take years and years of pain all the joy victories he can put it in a short amount of time just like samson amen hallelujah samson wasted all those years in those last few moments of his life he got prayer he had a revival prayer brother william praise god he felt that covenant he had a renewing and god did more at the end of his life than all the other years before see god knows how to restore praise god amen god knows how to make time more valuable more precious give you more blessings in less amount of time amen never give up never to be discouraged god is fighting for us amen the very last moments of his life samson gets the greatest victory of his entire life don't worry about time church you just give all your time to jesus you just redeem all the time give it all to jesus he'll bless you oh hallelujah here's some quotes from brother brown about son standing still now watch this he gives some beautiful applications here you know what happened joshua wasn't the type of a man that he talked about earlier to get his eyes off the revival joshua needed time in the revival the sun was going down he known if the enemy ever built up the revival is almost at the end of the close of it like we stand today he knew if he ever waited till the army got fortified against him it'd be hard to win that battle you know what he did you know that god promised that land he needed more time so the sun was about to go down he said sun stand still amen a paradox indeed the sun stood there for a full day and never moved and the moon over agilent never moved also because the bible said here was never a time before since they're like it that god hearken to the voice of a man you say oh if i know we just lived in that day so he talked about people that oh i just wish i could live in joshua's day and brother man quotes the scripture and he says jesus said in mark 11 24 if you say to the mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you've said will come to pass you can have what you said still grace and the paradox on down into our age sure praise god in other words just like joshua calls something to stand still jesus said you can cause things to move amen hallelujah praise god and the situation will change if we're believing the word if we're led by the holy spirit aren't you glad you're led by the spirit of god amen to speak the word praise god to believe god's promises oh my that moon and sun stood still until joshua fought his way through with israel avenged themselves upon their enemy why it was in the line of duty now if you get out here and say mountain move i want you to show i can do it it won't do it see it all goes back to your motive and objective well i want to show everybody how powerful i am that ain't gonna move it it has to be sincerely in the hour of duty right he was in the midst of a battle he's watching people die he's watching hailstones fall he's watching people get cut with the sword we're right in the thick of the battle he needs more time and god looks at a need of his child said i'd like to meet that need of my servant joshua jehovah's my salvation i'm going to show him the real salvation of the lord amen went to the line of duty when god has commanded you to do something like he said to moses why cry to me speak to the children i thought i said a timer maybe i did he said people ask today is crying all the time lord what next just speak and go forward that's right god has commissioned us to do something let's do it don't stand around and think and say well how can it happen why is it that makes any difference if god said do it do it anyhow he's still the god of miracles so church if you find yourself in a situation where you need god to show up and if you feel led of the holy spirit not for your glory not for your selfishness then we're told to speak the word praise god we have that confidence now the times has happened to me i wasn't even thinking about it i was so under the anointing i wasn't wondering should i speak or not i just spoke it right and that's how many times it'll be like joshua he's in a battle he's some of the anointing he knows when to speak the word right you'll speak the word under the anointing praise god don't do it for yourself we don't do it for selfish gain but we speak it under the anointing and it has to happen now here's where it says brother said it's a paradox amen god stop the entire earth from turning because a man said stand there still till i fight this battle through that's a paradox amen right because we're taught in science that uh everything revolves around the sun right there's still a debate on that i'm not sure i've never claimed to be a scientist i do teach science but it's very simple science life science and matter and everything i don't teach all this uh universe science astro astronomy but according to brother branham and at least in this quote you know the sun is spinning around so according to brother ram when joshua said sun stands still the earth stood still that's another ransom and then all that light would just stay on it it wouldn't go turn and you know go to the end of the day the earth just stopped now we're told the earth goes about 1 000 some miles per hour you imagine god just hitting the brakes on that okay joshua keep fighting i'm going to hold my foot on the brake here go ahead and all day the sun kept kept shining they're like are these guys like where do we go where's the sun going to go now what time and the israelites are we got all day we got plenty of light the sun is here to stay until we get to victory god's light will shine until you're defeated amen trust god's light to shine until you get the victory amen in other words call out for god's strength trust in his strength i just gotta make it a few more days right i just got to make it a few more weeks just trust in the strength of god let god's light shine amen hallelujah so god puts the brakes on it stops the earth and it's very uh very orbit that's our god never a day like it never a day before i wonder if everybody got backlash you know when they stopped it like that i wonder if everybody felt a little backlash probably not god's so gracious he probably just slowed it down and just brought it to a stop just like that and then it stayed in its orbit and the sun kept shining the moon stay right where it was wow that means he made because the moon orbits he made the moon stand still too wow that's right he wouldn't because the moon rotates on its own right it's got an orbit of its own so he caused the earth and moon to stop right where they were amen our god is great our god is greater our god is stronger praise god all to help out some heathen gideonites that were now saved that had respect for god he did all that to protect heathens church you know god's going to save heathens praise god anyone that wants to anyone that reverences god god's going to save anybody who wants to be saved we'll leave it up to him how he does it praise god amen now here's another sober one this is beautiful this is a different application what brother ram says about sun standing still so just stay with me here i got a little bit longer to go we'll see if i finish early i just might do everybody communion right now after this service okay if i can finish up early we'll see i don't know if that's possible all things are possible yeah the sun can stand still right all the things about i can breathe charges all things are possible yes brother some of these old earth some days this old earth is going to stand still some of these days time's going to stand still i just talked about time time is going to stand still so there physically in joshua the earth actually stopped but now he talks about time standing still listen to god speak you'll stop sometime oh you say i got my kids are raised now this is most of us that got parents or our parents he's talking about people that won't stop even though they have children they're all busy how many are busy with children i got kids to raise i got this to do i got the wash i got how many sisters got to wash when they get home we wash all the time there's there's no end to our washing i got a plow these things have got to be done how many brothers got to go to work and plow and sweat stand he said stand still a minute see our lives get so busy church what does god want us to do stand still so now it's not the sun it's you you standing still he said let god speak he'll do something for you one of these days he'll speak and the sun will turn no more he will speak and the moon will fail to give us light yes brother someday i'm going to preach my last sermon someday i'll pray my last prayer and i'll put this old bible for it's the last time and every mortal wheel in the body of mine will stand still but at that time i'm going over to zion to live forever with him the wheels of modern life will come to a standstill now look he said you poor decrepit sinner friend tonight won't you stand still for a minute this brings it down to the center stand still center let god speak to you when the services begin when the holy ghost is here now the great holy ghost the resurrected christ who's here in the form of the holy ghost the holy spirit is christ in spiritual form when he's here tonight the same yesterday today and forever and the faith that stopped that old from that old blind beggar there bartimaeus could stop him in in the road is the same faith the woman touches dartmouth went and turned and looked he's the same yesterday today and forever different quote now that's the way the church is today doesn't know what it believes it jumps from pillar to post and every little thing comes along it jumps after it and therefore all the beauty and perfume of the church has been sprayed away that's right be still someday everything's going to stand still time's going to stand still it'll blend into eternity the moon will stand still the sun will stand still men will stand still i'm saying this tonight brother that that'll be a great time the sinner will be there talking about the last judgment the bible said all are going to be gathered like sheep everybody's going to stand still one day so he says stand still today and talk to the lord listen to the holy spirit today oh you that's running from this nightclub and everywhere trying to find peace you'll stand still one day brother elvis presley will be there he will be really shook up too at that time if he don't repent arthur godfrey will be there with his little godfreys blondes brunettes and so forth it'll be a shaken time for him all the hail mary's in the world will never clean your guilty soul it'll take the blood of christ and did you know that church i'm just going to go ahead and share this here there's a famous show called the chosen right and a lot of the workers on there are catholics and did you know that show is turning a lot of people to the catholic faith the man who plays jesus on there had an interview the other day no it's okay we watched we watched all the shows i haven't watched them i don't i'd rather go study you know say that my family watches why i go study because i i watched so many movies when i was in the world i'm like i can't do it anymore i can't i i mean they're good shows but see you got to watch your influence so some people look at that man jesus and they watch a video and he says he he uses the hail mary beads all the time for prayer that man that plays jesus the catholic and he said he's getting testimonies from people turning to catholicism because he's a catholic is that right children you watch that they watch the video i didn't watch it i'm just going to be i'm just saying just be very careful praise god be very careful who we're influencing right we still might watch them you know we still might watch some of them but we just got to be very careful now when we watch them it's awesome because our children always critic criticize all their false teachings on there oh there are false things from history i like that but come and tell me daddy i didn't like this that's good good job catching that all right it's okay to watch brother and watch ten commandments there's a lot of things that on there that aren't very they're not completely accurate right there's a woman that there's kind of interesting modestly you know i don't know if i'm gonna turn his face away but i'm just saying every movie most likely he's gonna have some evil in it so you gotta be very cautious how you're being influenced okay but look he said all the hair mirrors in the world will never cleanse your guilty soul takes the blood of christ such nonsense as hail mary's that four or five psychiatrists trying to keep him and going it takes the blood of jesus christ to clean a man's soul and the pollution and the souls i might hurt you your little pet idea now your idol see that is this is a culprit them kind of things is what's damning our nation and the rock and rolls and boogie wiggly and all the other kind of stuff and nonsense the devil is placing that hearts through such timing rod as that god be merciful let's get still once and get before god amen see a movie is good like we watch him i watch other movies but that's not the gospel the preaching of the gospel is foolishness to them that don't believe but to us it is the power of god under salvation the highest form brother branham says of god speaking to his people is preaching god through man amen plays are nice movies are nice that's all nice but it's the real word of god the true word preaching the power and demonstration of the spirit that's when the blood of jesus christ becomes a reality that's when i got the holy ghost when brother brooks preached on the blood of jesus christ that's when it came to me that's when it will come to you praise god amen i never got the holy ghost watching the ten commandments i never got the holy ghost watching those other nice shows they're nice shows but it ain't the gospel the gospel is the truth amen and it's all truth in the gospel praise god that's why you must limit your screen time limit your entertainment time i didn't plan to say that either that wasn't in my notes i had no idea i was gonna say that just i just hope it helps somebody you gotta be careful gotta be careful what you watch careful how you're influenced see these people fall in love with this fake jesus oh he's so nice and come on i'm glad he's i'm glad he's a catcher but he ain't jesus he knows nothing about him that's jesus he's a sinner right he's a catholic he's trusting in mother mary to save him he ain't trusting in jesus christ amen yeah be very careful who you listen to that's why i'm glad i'm on facebook i've noticed since i got on facebook my life is a whole lot peaceful a whole lot more peaceful because before i was like i would try to you know i want to share things with my family but then everybody wants to argue about brother branham and argue about this and i would just be nervous waiting for the next one did he reply did she reply like i'm fighting all the time in church you know that is in the time when we have the most money the most technology people are the most sad we have more suicides now than before because they get on there and they see their other people's lives they get jealous and they think they're so depressed and that it doesn't help many people i'll tell you what's going to help people the gospel of jesus christ the blood of jesus christ and it will set your affections not on things on earth but on the things that are in heaven amen let's get still and get before god how many one do that i'm glad i love doing at church i love doing at home i love doing wherever i can verses 15 to 19. now for time's sake i'm probably gonna i'm not gonna read over the whole text josh returned to the camp and heard of the five kings hiding in a cave that's interesting after that great victory they got victory over there he goes back to camp and they then a messenger comes and says hey those five kings went and hid in a cave so joshua says oh yeah go get stones to cover the mouth of the cave while the soldiers finished pursuing their enemies the lord had delivered the enemies in their hands so josh was like don't quit now he must have been taking a break or something i don't know why he went back to the he must have been taking a break but he's like all you soldiers keep uh keep routing them keep chasing them keep driving them out keep trying to get all the victories you can so here we see the importance of finishing the fight against sin joshua tells him don't stop when you got him on the run kill him right if you got that guy on the run don't let him run kill him right you got that little sin on the run if you're starting to get victory over that sin don't stop don't let it come back kill it praise god make a promise like job i made a vow with my eyes never to look on a make a vow make a pledge let the word of god anoint you let the holy spirit anoint you and kill that influence and never be a slave to it again get the victory praise god i heard a preacher say like this i liked it he said god is so interested in getting the victory he wouldn't let five kings hang out in a cave god didn't want five little sins outside of that five little habits just hiding away god didn't want it hidden god want all sin confessed god wants all of our sins all of all the potential sins right because they were just potentially evil in that cave god wants all of our potential sins confessed and he wants everything hidden to be made brought to the light that all of our sins are confessed so anything church hiding in our lives let's confess it by the grace of god okay in verses 20 21 israel achieved a great slaughter some enemies remained alive but could not speak against any israeli so the ones that did get away to the cities they wouldn't say anything bad against jehovah because they'd seen the hailstones they seen the sun stand still how could you speak against that after seeing the mighty americas of god how could they deny it they couldn't deny it brought fear to their heart and that should be our prayer god show our family members miracles do mighty things to our family members so they won't speak against this word even the sinners wouldn't speak against god's word because they've seen the power of god joshua wanted all men of israel their captains to see the demise of these evil kings joshua finally quotes be strong and of good courage that he'd heard so many times from moses the lord and the captains of israel remember that i preached on that at the beginning i dramatized it while moses was alive moses told joshua he said be strong and of good courage that's right okay they cross over into jordan i'm sorry before they cross jordan god tells joshua he says joshua be strong and very gracious yes lord before they cross over the captains tell joshua joshua be strong and very courageous but it isn't until joshua has his head on the neck of these kings that finally he's the one speaking the word he's the one that says now israel all you captains all you men of god look what god has done today be strong and be of courage satan will be brute shortly under your feet praise god amen the word had become a reality the promise had become real god's word was manifested before joshua it was a reality to him he'd heard it all those years we're the invincible bride we're the bride who's going to get the latter rain we're the bride going the rapture we're the brides we're the bride with the oil we're the wise virgin bride one of these days church it's gonna be a total reality praise god amen there'll be no denying it just like joshua the promises became manifestable form that's such a beautiful beautiful story after all these great moves joshua stands there on top of his enemy and now he says you be strong you'll be courageous they just had great victories see church we got to take the momentum from one victory take it to the next day right don't get lazy on god don't get tired on god take the victory that you had the first day take it to the next day keep keep speaking the word of god stay strong in the lord my note says god still granted joshua's greatest victories and miracles now look despite the hail and the speaking of the sun moon despite failing do you remember that remember his failures 36 men died because him and his captains didn't they didn't ask god about ai now moses had killed one man right now joshua makes a mistake 36 men die but did he quit did he give up no he just got rid of the sin in the can no doubt would have had to say sorry too right do that repent see this gives us great lessons see church many times your greatest miracles will come after your hardest battles or your biggest your biggest faults right so we gotta stay faithful to god admit when we're wrong say we're sorry and then watch how god shows his love to you shortly afterwards he'll prove his love to you even though you made mistakes i'm the god of mercy remember last week i'm the god who delights in mercy i'm the god i'm ready to party just come to me just confess your sins i'm ready to pardon i'll do something great joshua i know you made a mistake there you got to see right there everyone do something great for you sir i've watched all your service i reward you in due season church god is going to reward you in due season don't leave god just because you made a few mistakes god knows you're going to make mistakes if you didn't make mistakes you you'd be god you'd be god if you if you've never made any mistakes god expects you to make mistakes but god knows you'll come back repent and get refilled with power and courage get your vision straight again and press on for the mark of the high calling amen like i remember when i told you i made different mistakes as a pastor and i'm looking at it now some of those mistakes i made was in 2009 the greatest meetings ever saw was in 2010 11 12 13. the greatest miracles i've ever seen was after one of my biggest mistakes was sister lady remember i shared that i advised her to move over to saudi arabia without a home church that was probably my biggest mistake as a pastor i think but look i asked god to forgive me i repent and the greatest meetings ever had was directly after that amen see god knows i'm going to make mistakes but i'll never make that mistake again david made that mistake with adultery but he never made it again let that be our testimony we might have made a mistake but we'll never to make it again by the grace of god now look 22-27 we learn god wants all hidden sin extinguished from our lives just like those five kings he didn't let them live right hidden sin should not stay hidden sin needs to go the bible said now look here's where we'll get to this now beseech you brother mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which you've learned and avoid them so brothers that bring division sisters that cause the vision of the church avoid them for they serve not our lord jesus christ but their own belly watch how their own they just want more money more uh whatever they just want they want they want themselves to be blessed instead of blessing other people and by good works and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple now look he's talking about evil people right battles write them up battles against dividers for your obedience has come abroad unto all men i'm glad therefore on your behalf but yet i would have you wise unto that which is good and simple concerning evil so you've been tried to be divided you have withstood those dividing spirits right you stay true to the word of god and you obey the word of god church and the god of peace shall brew satan under your feet shortly the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you amen in other words all those lies of all those demons that are trying to divide you and deceive you and steal your money or whatever or whatever you're trying to do steal your church you're going to put them under the feet spiritually speaking very soon amen satan will be bruised under your feet very soon amen so see our battles are different right we're not going off to fight battles like afghanistan or something like that we're that's not that's not our real battles our battles are against false doctrine our battles are against sickness right our battle is against people that worship themselves and idolatry that's what our battle is against but we still have the same power as joshua to put the enemy under our feet by obedience i know i know you're getting tired i can feel it so let me try to finish up here i'm sweating a little bit but not too much here so okay in the word i'm sorry the word bruise in greek means to break in pieces to shiver to tread down put satan under foot as a conqueror trample on him to break down to crush to tear one's body and shatter one's strength shattered so in the new testament the powers that are trying to attack us get shattered they get dissolved or broken the power of the enemy gets broken and no you're no longer under the power of the enemy you're the power of christ shattered broken shred down stomped under walking over it it's not hindering it's not bothering you you're walking over it praise god you have power over it nothing's stopping you praise god i thank the lord what did jesus now the same word put satan under your feet is used right here in the uh forget what church age this is chapter two so it's probably the third of four churches he's overcometh and he with my words to the end to him when i give power over the nation he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers even as i received of my father look the father gave jesus go brew satan under your foot and he did amen praise god that was his power that was his ability to put satan under his feet and just destroy all that influence and the bible says that's what the overcomer gets in the millennium power to rule over nations right rule them with a rod of iron that's right power over nations the overcomer so anything that rises up against a believer will be instantly taken down by the power of jesus christ in verses 28 to 43 israel gained repeated victories now we're not going to read this but sure just read it they go from victory to victory they kill everything over and over and over again they destroy everything because the lord commanded it and they do it all swiftly just a swift quick victory and afterwards they come back to gilgal church what's gilgall gilgal is your first left gilgal is a place of your circumcision that place where you entered the covenant i love you jesus i'll serve you all the days of my life fill me with the holy ghost boom filled with the holy ghost that's skill goal praise god the world's cut out christ is sealed in praise god so after all these victories where they go back to gilgal back to their first thought back to that place of remembrance ah this is where we first came in i remember when i first came in i remember when i first got that great victory i remember when the world was cut away i remember the pain of it but also remember the victory of becoming a part of god's covenant in church what is this for us it's a return to the cross it's a return to remembering jesus death burial and resurrection how many can understand that everyone understand it okay we must never forget what god has done for us how he separated us from our life of sin how he brought us into the covenant he brought us across jordan he brought me out of egypt the blood of the lamb brought me out he's given me all these victories after victory after victory he's giving me all these victories every now and then i show this slide let me show it again one time i just wanted to make a little list of uh spirits i never finished it let me make it bigger i want to make a list someday but think about all these victories we get we get victory over some familiar spirits like false prophecies the spirit of divination or jealousy we got to get victory over jealousy everyone ever been jealous of somebody i've battled that preacher's got more time and more maybe they're more gifted than me or you know i battle jealousy everybody battles jealousy lying spirit we're tempted to lie i'm gonna never battle the lying spirit by the ram battle that ever battle the perverse spirit how about the spirit of pride anybody ever battled that but see joshua went on this role where he defeated pride he defeated whoredoms in other words right spiritually speaking he defeated infirmities the deaf and dumb the spirit of bondage the spirit of fear seducing spirits anti-christ spirit spirit of air spirit of death every every battle they went up against they won it was a great string of victories it was a host of victories all because they diligently hearken to the voice of god and serve god in obedience let's stand to our feet praise god i think we have time for communion for everybody we'll just do it all this morning that way it's not a big deal musicians can come if you like
