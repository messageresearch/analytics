[13:02] everything went red praise god
[13:07] [Music]
[13:10] maybe seated here let's take a few
[13:12] prayer requests as at this moment we
[13:14] have the same request we don't have
[13:15] anything new
[13:17] um i do want to give a further
[13:19] announcement on this morning uh with the
[13:21] columbus meetings
[13:23] the brother uh
[13:25] sarah
[13:26] serge
[13:27] sergei okay i keep saying sarah j that's
[13:29] not sarah j
[13:31] it's sergey
[13:32] he also invited me to preach um chris
[13:35] i'm sorry christmas
[13:36] easter morning forgive me
[13:41] give me a moment here
[13:43] settled my mind down a little bit after
[13:44] all that shouting and praising god
[13:47] um so anyways but it's tentative so
[13:49] that's why i didn't say anything on the
[13:50] text now i got brother simon he he would
[13:53] tentatively cover for me on easter
[13:54] morning
[13:56] if i preach in columbus on easter
[13:58] morning but it's tentative
[13:59] because they they share a church with a
[14:02] baptist church they're they're a small
[14:04] message church he said we have from 10
[14:05] to 15 people
[14:07] so they have a very small church down
[14:08] there we thought we had a small brother
[14:11] and we were small at the beginning but
[14:12] we've grown out of that by god's grace
[14:14] but um very small church so it's
[14:17] tentative so at this time it's just a
[14:19] saturday night you're all welcome down
[14:20] to come saturday night
[14:22] but i have brother simon as my backup
[14:25] here on easter morning
[14:28] uh if there's if he indeed wants me to
[14:31] if they can get that church and rent out
[14:33] that church for the the sunday morning
[14:35] but the baptist pastor would have to
[14:36] give up this the service so i doubt it
[14:38] but i do have brother simon on standby
[14:42] so that's just one announcement okay so
[14:43] it's going to be a very busy week and
[14:44] i'll probably cancel that wednesday
[14:46] service before the good friday
[14:48] so let's see that would be the 13th
[14:51] so april 13th i'll cancel the wednesday
[14:53] night service we can have good friday
[14:54] service all together
[14:56] the church
[14:58] we'll take communion on friday night
[15:00] saturday night we'd be in columbus
[15:03] and then i may or may not be in columbus
[15:05] on saturday morning but i'll definitely
[15:06] be here
[15:07] saturday afternoon because i sent out
[15:09] those uh
[15:10] postcards and i gave we have they sent
[15:12] us some extra ones so i gave some to
[15:14] austin and um but they meant if you like
[15:15] some ones that give out let me know like
[15:17] we have we i think we got like 10 extra
[15:19] ones or something like that
[15:21] uh because we have sent out 5 000 and
[15:23] maybe somebody will come you know last
[15:24] time we sent out 2 500 and two people
[15:26] came so maybe we'll send out five
[15:28] thousand maybe five people will come so
[15:30] i don't know the
[15:31] all the math behind that it's all about
[15:32] god's calling right we heard that this
[15:33] morning it's all god's calling come and
[15:35] see
[15:36] many are called if you were chosen
[15:38] but just want to give the people a
[15:39] chance
[15:40] so that would be the only announcement i
[15:42] believe by god's grace
[15:45] anybody else have a uh any other new
[15:46] requests tonight or any song specials

[34:35] sometimes can't be
[34:39] brother bang's oldest or
[34:41] bang's boy there kicking up i mean
[34:43] that's sometimes how i feel trying to
[34:44] get up to work
[34:46] i don't want to go
[34:48] i just want to do what i want to do
[34:51] you got to fight past that
[34:55] so um
[34:56] anyhow all's well here we just
[34:59] want to be
[35:00] a blessing to
[35:03] the bride of jesus christ and
[35:06] i've been in your seat shoes many many
[35:09] times and
[35:10] it's like every second shift second
[35:12] second second services
[35:14] sometimes that sleepy spirit now i got i
[35:17] got a gift i might
[35:18] sleep anytime almost anywhere
[35:20] any situation of college we had uh the
[35:23] dorms we had fire
[35:24] alarms and this that i'd sleep right
[35:26] through them that r.a would have to go
[35:27] in there and wake me up and say you're
[35:29] gonna die i'm like
[35:30] i didn't even know
[35:33] the place is on fire well i didn't hear
[35:35] anything
[35:38] i'm gone so um
[35:40] let's turn to matthew 25.
[35:42] now if you start feeling tired just
[35:44] stand up and just
[35:46] wave your arms a little bit and just
[35:48] just
[35:49] do what you got to do and do the little
[35:50] circles this way
[35:52] big circles and
[35:55] little calisthenics and
[35:58] bodily exercise profit little but it
[36:00] profits a little bit even especially at
[36:02] service you know so sometimes i'm
[36:04] struggling on a wednesday i just got
[36:05] done working
[36:06] and i'm getting older now i can't work
[36:08] like i used to and i get tired you know
[36:09] sometimes
[36:11] if i get an opportunity i'll take a nap
[36:12] after work
[36:13] for 45 minutes you know half an hour an
[36:15] hour or whatever
[36:17] let's get tired and
[36:21] that that seems to help
[36:23] but wednesday night at service there
[36:25] i'll stand in the back you know and not
[36:26] sit beside my wife and
[36:28] she just has to
[36:29] take it
[36:31] and she's okay with it so
[36:33] uh let's get into the word of god here
[36:34] in matthew 25
[36:37] uh verse one
[36:44] matthew 25 verse 1
[36:47] says then shall the kingdom of heaven be
[36:49] likened unto ten virgins which took
[36:51] their lamps and went forth to meet the
[36:53] bridegroom and five of them were wise
[36:55] and five were foolish
[37:00] they that were foolish took their lamps
[37:02] and took no oil with them
[37:05] but the wise took oil in their vessels
[37:07] with their lamps
[37:08] while the bridegroom tarried they all
[37:10] slumbered and slept
[37:12] and at midnight there was a cry made
[37:14] behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out
[37:16] to meet him
[37:19] then all those virgins arose and trim
[37:21] their lamps
[37:24] and then let's turn to revelations
[37:27] 3
[37:30] and 19.
[37:41] revelations 3 and 19. now notice what
[37:44] the bible says here
[37:46] as many as i love i rebuke and chasten
[37:48] be zealous therefore and repent
[37:53] behold i stand at the door and knock
[37:56] if any man hear my voice
[37:58] and open the door i will come into him
[38:02] and will sup with him and he with me
[38:05] so say a word of prayer
[38:09] dearly father lord jesus so we come
[38:11] before your humble lord reverent lord
[38:13] and
[38:13] you know we're so grateful lord for your
[38:15] word lord we thank you for this
[38:16] revelation and we thank you for
[38:19] your long-suffering lord not only just
[38:21] to the world lord but to us lord for the
[38:23] bible says even the righteous are
[38:25] scarcely saved god
[38:27] lord your bride there's so few that make
[38:30] it lord there's so few are going to make
[38:32] it into the rapture god and lord god is
[38:34] we see time dwelling down lord your
[38:36] prophet said though that
[38:38] it would come down to a razor's edge
[38:40] honing god lord that's how few there
[38:42] would be lord
[38:44] just little sets of believers lord here
[38:46] and there and
[38:48] oh god we know there's a separation
[38:50] coming even within the message lord
[38:52] uh for things are going to happen lord
[38:55] lord god we certainly love you lord
[38:57] bless the people god lord maybe humble
[38:59] ourselves god lord as the song said lord

[39:04] higher and higher lord god our lord
[39:06] jesus lord just anoint us all lord hear
[39:09] god lord and we rebuke any tiredness god
[39:11] lord in the name of jesus christ or even
[39:13] upon myself god over the lord may we
[39:16] find that holy ghost got that anointing
[39:18] that gives us strength and energy and
[39:20] power lord and
[39:21] the spirit's always willing lord uh but
[39:24] the body is the weak and lord we
[39:26] certainly love you bless the people god
[39:28] in the name of jesus christ amen
[39:30] you may have your seats here
[39:46] so
[39:47] uh
[39:50] as far as like picking and choosing a
[39:54] a topic here you know i just had like
[39:56] really two in my satchel i brought two
[39:58] messages with me my satchel that was it
[40:00] so
[40:00] i'm not captain inspiration i
[40:03] i just can't pick up a thought and just
[40:06] close everything down and go
[40:08] but i just i'm a teacher uh maybe i
[40:11] guess if i would have to describe myself
[40:13] i have to study it i have to look at it
[40:15] i have to
[40:16] uh see how
[40:18] how much time has given me how to place
[40:20] things and
[40:22] and those sort of things as well and
[40:25] uh first service there at the end

[40:42] i taught it pretty thoroughly and now i
[40:44] have vindicated what i've taught
[40:45] [Laughter]
[40:47] i battle the old memory so brother
[40:48] austin
[40:50] ah now your witness is to see how see
[40:52] how rough that is
[40:52] [Laughter]
[40:54] well that's high you're 44 no i've been
[40:56] like that since i was born
[40:57] [Laughter]
[40:59] yeah that's uh i got issues
[41:02] but one day that spirit realm that
[41:04] memory is going to be just fine
[41:06] and we'll know all things that will
[41:08] always know them so
[41:10] i'm looking for i'll tell you why
[41:11] everybody's like oh i want to do this
[41:13] and i'll do that in the millennium i
[41:14] just want to be able to remember stuff i

[41:20] be right on tip of my tongue it'll just
[41:21] fly off and i'm like
[41:23] memory amazing so
[41:26] uh anyhow uh brother austin here i wanna
[41:29] i wanna i wanna bring this little quote
[41:30] here for you by god's grace you know
[41:32] just encouragement and
[41:34] and the prophet god said he says i can
[41:36] go on record for this tonight
[41:38] he says if any people will take the
[41:40] right mental attitude towards any divine
[41:42] promise what's the greatest divine
[41:44] promise to receive the baptism of the
[41:46] holy ghost if you've been baptized in
[41:48] his precious name
[41:50] he says if you he says yeah that will
[41:53] god will ever made and claim it as yours
[41:56] so you just gotta go keep con confessing
[41:58] it claiming it believing it
[42:00] and say i've already got it i've already
[42:02] got the promise i've did what was
[42:03] required the bible says uh that god
[42:06] gives those uh the holy ghost to those
[42:08] that obey him amen absolutely he will
[42:11] god will bring it to pass if you take
[42:13] the right mental right attitude towards
[42:15] it knowing that if god said it so the
[42:18] promise is yours and it's your personal
[42:20] property the very minute you receive it
[42:22] that way
[42:23] so listen it's like a know that you know
[42:26] that you're going to receive it uh if i
[42:28] was short on money or uh uh or however
[42:31] or needed this or i lack that or however
[42:34] if i just look in the word of god said
[42:35] and the jesus christ is the is the
[42:37] healer he's a great physician once i
[42:39] catch the revelation that scripture by
[42:41] his stripes are healed i've already got
[42:43] it i know i'm healed
[42:46] it's going to come so
[42:48] um
[42:49] he says if the very many receive that
[42:51] way then it has to come to pass so it's
[42:54] it's coming so as we read in the
[42:56] scripture there
[42:58] i want to emphasize notice here where
[43:01] uh
[43:02] this is very very familiar we've all
[43:04] been looked at these scriptures many
[43:06] many times
[43:08] wise and foolish virgin
[43:10] and this is
[43:13] really at this point maybe some of us
[43:15] still battle you know while i'm a judas
[43:16] or this or that you know and we've got
[43:18] the castes of aside right now we are
[43:20] interested in one thing that's becoming
[43:22] the bride of christ we can't even let
[43:24] that enter into our minds judas no no
[43:27] we have received the word of god we love
[43:30] it we we're trying to live by the very
[43:32] best we can i'll tell you if there's one
[43:33] person that knows me it's my wife knows
[43:35] my weaknesses my
[43:37] sometimes i cut up some sometimes i cut
[43:39] up more than sometimes and then
[43:42] she knows everything about me uh
[43:44] failures
[43:45] weaknesses i mean she just knows it all
[43:47] so i can't i can't put a show on in
[43:49] front of her
[43:50] she knows me
[43:52] she knows if i'm up here speaking truth
[43:54] or not or however and those sort of
[43:55] things uh about my life her life our
[43:58] life
[43:58] uh those sort of things so here
[44:01] uh we want to go into these things as
[44:03] far as uh
[44:05] uh the wise and foolish um
[44:08] and just show you here now we we we then
[44:11] we of course we brought this scripture
[44:12] here and um
[44:15] now notice here he
[44:16] god is addressing that church a jesus he
[44:19] says uh
[44:21] he said there there i know that works
[44:23] and he had a heart hole he's dealing
[44:24] with the lukewarmness he's doing he's
[44:25] dealing with he says because thou sayest
[44:27] i am rich and increased with goods and
[44:29] need of nothing he's going into the
[44:31] condition of the church and then he
[44:33] shows you the uh uh the he gives you the
[44:38] symptoms of the problem and then he
[44:39] gives you the the problem to the
[44:41] solution or the solution to the problem
[44:44] is like counseling to buy me gold tried
[44:46] in the fire and he shows you how to get
[44:48] fixed up he shows you he says come to me
[44:50] he says i'll fix you up and this and
[44:51] this and this and and i'm going to deal
[44:54] with you i'm going to get you in
[44:55] position and then he says
[44:57] he says uh and and he says
[45:00] in this age
[45:01] all he brings forth is rebuke and
[45:03] chastisement
[45:06] that's how because if we sit the longer
[45:08] we sit in luxury
[45:10] in the ease of this the weaker we get
[45:14] if i don't eat
[45:16] at 10 a.m in the morning i'm gonna get
[45:18] cranky
[45:19] if i don't have my paycheck sitting
[45:22] right there on a wednesday afternoon
[45:23] before i go to work if i'm it's not
[45:25] there i am that's it i'm gonna call my
[45:28] boss
[45:29] if i don't have this certain thing kind
[45:31] of way happen at this certain time
[45:32] moment then
[45:34] i'm gonna i'm gonna voice my opinion
[45:38] and everything has to be our way or my
[45:40] way and it's gotta work out this way
[45:42] saints of god we need to ask and lay
[45:44] before the lord said lord what is your
[45:46] will for our lives
[45:50] right amen sure so he brings all this
[45:52] rep repentance uh rebuke chastisement
[45:55] then now notice he says he's at the door
[45:57] now of the church
[45:58] he's at this church age and the bible
[46:00] says he's knocking but notice one thing
[46:04] he says i behold i stand the door and
[46:06] knock if any man hear my
[46:08] voice
[46:10] so we have to recognize that voice okay
[46:13] so
[46:14] uh i guess this afternoon here
[46:18] we want to get into this and i would
[46:19] like to teach on this
[46:21] the difference between a wife
[46:23] uh and a virgin or a
[46:25] clean living sister i'll say like that
[46:28] it's like this a difference between a
[46:30] wife
[46:31] and a virgin absolutely so
[46:36] let me say it like this
[46:41] i kind of started out this way maybe at
[46:43] home
[46:44] and i can only like really pick on one
[46:46] sister here and that's lydia
[46:50] sister lydia
[46:52] how old are you now sister
[46:54] 17 years old
[46:57] now i i'm looking at sister lydia
[47:00] i'm looking to the right of her
[47:03] looking to the left of her and i see no
[47:06] man i don't see a man there i don't see
[47:07] a husband
[47:09] tells me
[47:10] and i have previous knowledge of this as
[47:12] well but she's not married
[47:13] [Laughter]
[47:15] and she's not courting anyone no one's
[47:17] courting her i'll say like that
[47:19] that i know of
[47:21] my dress is gonna be jess is probably
[47:23] gonna be staring me down with those
[47:24] laser eyes right now as i'm speaking
[47:25] these things okay and mama too maybe
[47:27] we'll see
[47:28] mama eagles
[47:29] feathers are a little roughing
[47:31] up
[47:32] and that's okay because i'm in control
[47:34] right now so
[47:36] we're gonna use we're gonna we're gonna
[47:38] talk about sister lydia today for
[47:40] tonight a little bit okay is that all
[47:42] right
[47:42] now it's sister lydia's life right now
[47:44] she's 17 years old and
[47:48] she's been brought up by wonderful
[47:50] parents that have taught her the word of
[47:52] god and if there is a group of parents
[47:54] that have taught the word of god it
[47:55] would be these two
[47:59] very
[48:00] few have went this far and have been
[48:02] this diligent
[48:05] they've exceeded my own mother
[48:07] of course my mom was
[48:09] by herself which is quite a bit rougher
[48:11] but nonetheless they've done a fantastic
[48:13] job reading the bible
[48:15] i believe brother jesse has read the
[48:16] bible with them
[48:18] once twice maybe a couple times
[48:20] going through it at night
[48:22] going through those things and however
[48:23] so sister lydia has been raised up
[48:26] in the admonition of the lord
[48:29] of course sister keisha is right next
[48:31] that as well
[48:32] sure um
[48:34] coming up as well right behind her
[48:36] uh and right now she's at a point
[48:42] where she's looking forward to 18. she's
[48:45] looking forward to 19 20.
[48:47] and as your as their parents are maybe
[48:49] praying that the god would withhold a
[48:51] husband for a little time when they
[48:54] gather some time with her as she gets
[48:56] older and get to
[48:57] go from parents to friends almost you
[49:00] know it's got to because it's got a
[49:02] transition to something like that
[49:04] lydia may
[49:06] land a fantastic job somewhere instead
[49:08] of sorting apples she'll be sorting
[49:10] applications
[49:12] she'll be sorting stocks and bonds
[49:14] she'll be sorting uh tax returns who
[49:16] knows what she's going to be doing and
[49:18] she'll maybe she'll make a little extra
[49:20] money and and if she would make choices
[49:24] uh
[49:25] and right choices financial decisions
[49:28] and really uh plan her life to continue
[49:31] on and be prosperous even without maybe
[49:34] let's say a husband uh
[49:37] she would now have decisions she could
[49:39] make she would have opportunities
[49:41] now as she's been raised up in the
[49:43] admonition of the lord and she no doubt
[49:46] will continue in that way because we see
[49:48] that she loves the lord she she's
[49:50] faithful to church she's playing piano
[49:52] she's doing those things she i believe
[49:54] that she has a relationship with jesus
[49:56] christ and she wants to read his word
[49:57] she wants to pray she wants to continue
[50:00] on and no doubt deep within her heart
[50:01] and even maybe as is pressing his way
[50:03] out she desires a godly husband okay so
[50:06] but until that moment takes place she is
[50:09] on she she actually has a free wheel
[50:12] okay
[50:13] so as she gets older let's say she makes
[50:15] a little money she gets her her car
[50:17] going uh uh as most younger sister have
[50:20] the beater honda or the beater foreign
[50:22] car or something like some kind of a
[50:24] beater car with a i just drove emma's
[50:26] car the other day and the handle doesn't
[50:28] hardly work the other one's missing it
[50:30] and then she hit something and the the
[50:32] side windshield mirrors off and
[50:35] emma jane i remember those beater car
[50:36] days
[50:40] and at that point where she's unmarried
[50:42] she's free
[50:44] to do what she will
[50:50] she could technically
[50:52] call on her cell phone
[50:54] and call up emma jane salmi
[50:56] and ali
[50:58] pick up one of her sisters and say hey
[51:00] let's go on a little road trip for a day
[51:02] or two and then they'll get in the car
[51:03] and they'll ride and they they can go
[51:05] and see sights they could literally pack
[51:08] up those sisters
[51:09] and they could take a little trip
[51:11] and if they wanted to hit a gas station
[51:13] and get some snacks they could get some
[51:14] snacks if they wanted to eat over a
[51:16] cracker barrel they could eat a cracker
[51:18] barrel and then they could drive to
[51:19] let's say a big uh a meeting in in a
[51:22] message a good sermon you know a
[51:24] three-day sermon they could go there
[51:25] they'd get a hotel and the three three
[51:27] four sisters could uh could stay
[51:29] together they could have a good time and
[51:30] laugh and talk till midnight and all
[51:32] those sort of things they because they
[51:34] would be free
[51:36] yes sir
[51:39] and as they would go to the service
[51:42] they could hear the preaching and they
[51:43] could they say amen and praise god and
[51:46] those sort of things at the end of the
[51:47] service there would be like the little
[51:48] time where they would fellowship and go
[51:50] to eat crumpets and and sip on teas and
[51:53] coffees and all that after a service
[51:55] maybe a saturday night you know how they
[51:57] have where they little dainties to eat
[51:58] or whatever and and the sisters will be
[52:01] standing there and there'd be a group of
[52:02] brothers over there
[52:04] and the sister would be giggling and
[52:06] laughing to themselves and however and
[52:07] the brothers would be over there talking
[52:09] okay now i'm just bringing this as an
[52:11] example okay
[52:13] and let's say one man or a group of
[52:16] brothers get the courage which is very
[52:20] highly unlikely
[52:21] but let's say a young group of brothers
[52:23] gets some courage and goes up to that
[52:25] group of sisters and they say well hello
[52:27] sister god bless you and there's like
[52:28] four or five brothers right there young
[52:30] man
[52:31] hot wives
[52:34] and each one of those brothers young men
[52:38] shake sister lina's hand said god bless
[52:39] you
[52:40] god bless you sister god bless you
[52:42] sister god bless you sister now when she
[52:45] first hear those voices neither one of
[52:47] them rings a bell
[52:49] they're brand new
[52:52] that man's voice that young man's voice
[52:53] doesn't mean any more to me than that
[52:55] other man's voice over there
[52:57] and there's beginning four or five
[53:00] brothers could shake her hand and not
[53:02] one of their voices rings anything
[53:04] there's no meaning to them right
[53:07] okay
[53:11] and then later on
[53:13] let's say she meets someone else
[53:17] and he wants to quarter
[53:23] and brother jesse
[53:26] does the checklist
[53:29] five port five-point interview process
[53:34] with multiple visitations
[53:37] multiple spy cameras
[53:39] all kinds of things going on here
[53:42] calls in the uncle for reinforcements
[53:49] not trying to report just
[53:52] and then let's say they continue
[53:54] on and they court for months and months
[53:58] his voice becomes very familiar
[54:02] now they could not be even engaged yet
[54:05] and as they're just courting sister
[54:07] lydia can still go around
[54:09] and take emma jane salmi
[54:11] and occasion the other sisters they can
[54:13] go off here and there and they can just
[54:15] travel and do whatever they want to do
[54:18] within their
[54:20] means yes
[54:24] and if lydia is still court being
[54:27] courted
[54:29] and she'd be at these other services and
[54:31] young men would come up and say well
[54:32] hello sister
[54:35] that's she would recognize right now
[54:37] that's not the voice of the one quoting
[54:38] her right
[54:42] amen
[54:43] now let's continue on here
[54:45] now in first corinthians 6 and 17
[54:48] but he that is joined unto the lord is
[54:50] one
[54:51] spirit
[54:52] notice what he the prophet the prophet
[54:54] god hear he says he says he says flee
[54:57] fornication every sin that a man doeth
[55:00] is without the body but he that
[55:02] committeth fornication sinneth against
[55:03] his own body what know ye not that your
[55:06] body is the temple of the holy ghost
[55:07] which is in you which you have of god
[55:10] and ye are not of your own so here if
[55:13] you have been bought by the holy ghost
[55:15] this temple this very body we live in is
[55:17] not even our own but it's been purchased
[55:21] it's been now it now and and there was
[55:23] the the one that's bought it now wants
[55:25] to live in it is i purchased that house
[55:28] i purchased this temple and i want to
[55:31] live in it because now it's mine i have
[55:33] rice to it now would you yield your
[55:36] rights to let him come and live within
[55:38] his own temple the one to be purchased
[55:39] absolutely we want to do that lord god
[55:42] help me lord to yield and to make sure
[55:45] this temple is fit
[55:47] and worthy to be lived in by the god
[55:49] almighty amen
[55:51] absolutely he requires he wants you not
[55:53] he doesn't want to you to produce the
[55:55] word he wants you to believe the word
[55:58] that was brought to you amen
[56:00] absolutely now he says for you borrow
[56:02] the price therefore glorify god in your
[56:04] body and in your spirit which are
[56:07] gods absolutely and now uh dealing with
[56:10] our young sister here she has kept
[56:12] herself and and she lives accordingly
[56:14] and she's done her very best uh from
[56:16] what her her was it her sister or her
[56:19] brother i can't remember his acacia or
[56:21] brother uh malachi said that her work
[56:24] environment's kinda rough
[56:27] welcome to the real world
[56:29] it's not easy when you hear swear words
[56:31] all day filth all day long that's all i
[56:35] hear
[56:36] every other i mean literally it's that
[56:38] bad every other word now is literally
[56:41] i mean let's be honest
[56:45] but even through that filth she is
[56:46] keeping herself clean amen sure now in
[56:50] romans 6 he says he says let not sin
[56:52] therefore reign in your mortal body they
[56:54] shall not obey it in the lust thereof
[56:56] neither yield you neither yield ye your
[56:59] members as instruments of unrighteous
[57:01] unto sin but yield yourselves unto god
[57:05] as those that are alive from the dead in
[57:07] your memories are instruments of
[57:08] righteousness god for sin shall not have
[57:10] dominion over you if you're not under
[57:11] the law but under
[57:13] grace right now so here's scriptures
[57:15] dealing with how we're to keep our
[57:17] vessels how we're to keep our lifestyles
[57:20] clean and pure and and those sort of
[57:22] things absolutely sure but now notice if
[57:25] we go back to matthew 25 you see the
[57:27] wise and foolish virgins now remember
[57:29] they're both called
[57:30] virgin because what they are clean
[57:32] living they've been not they have uh uh
[57:35] kept themselves from the the i was like
[57:37] this the
[57:38] uh from committing spiritual adultery
[57:41] spiritual fornication those sort of
[57:43] things they are actually virgins they
[57:45] kept themselves what to the word of god
[57:47] they lived according to what the word of
[57:50] god and so much so that god himself even
[57:53] called them pure even called them clean
[57:56] that was his witness that was his
[57:57] discernment of these two sets of people
[57:59] they were both clean absolutely sure he
[58:03] says uh he says
[58:05] neither ye yield as yourselves as
[58:07] instruments and rises under sin but
[58:08] yield yourselves into god as those that
[58:10] are alive from the dead and your members
[58:12] as instruments of righteousness unto god
[58:13] for sin shall not have dominion over you
[58:16] for ye are not under law but under grace
[58:18] absolutely so what if we yield sin shall
[58:20] not have dominion over you now notice
[58:23] i beseech you therefore brethren by the
[58:25] mercies of god that ye present your
[58:27] bodies a living sacrifice both sets wise
[58:31] and foolish were doing this
[58:33] they yielded their bodies as living
[58:35] sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which
[58:38] is your reasonable service it's a
[58:41] reasonable in other words we owe this to
[58:43] god
[58:44] it's reasonable it's without a shadow of
[58:46] a doubt there's no question on how we're
[58:48] to keep ourselves and how to live
[58:51] do we fail absolutely sure but we've got
[58:53] to do why because god look at all that
[58:56] jesus christ did for us
[58:59] literally he has done it all
[59:03] if i could i mean i i am so ashamed of
[59:06] my failures uh i mean
[59:09] i'll say this for the amount of
[59:10] revelation we have
[59:12] for the amount of understanding that's
[59:14] been given to us in this day and then
[59:16] still to see myself fail and fail and
[59:20] continue to falter and to to come up
[59:23] short
[59:25] it's so hard i i and you just kind of
[59:28] want to be rough on yourself you know
[59:30] not like to the catholic mode but just
[59:31] like come on inside
[59:34] you want to encourage yourself get your
[59:36] god spanks me i speak myself
[59:38] [Laughter]
[59:40] oh my
[59:43] he says and be not conformed to this
[59:44] world but be transformed by the renewing
[59:47] of your mind that you may prove what is
[59:50] what is that good and acceptable and
[59:53] perfect will of god absolutely sure
[59:57] now let's continue on here
[59:58] now part of this study here
[1:00:02] um
[1:00:04] just seeing a couple things pop up
[1:00:08] uh
[1:00:09] you know saint paul said in corinthians
[1:00:11] he says he says i've heard rumors
[1:00:14] of this and
[1:00:16] i've heard from the house of chloe
[1:00:19] this is going on okay he's heard these
[1:00:21] things and he said i'm pretty sure
[1:00:23] they're true
[1:00:25] so i've heard some things coming through
[1:00:27] the old grapevine in the message there
[1:00:29] as you would maybe once say and
[1:00:31] i wanted to maybe address these things
[1:00:33] all right
[1:00:34] so now notice i love this in first
[1:00:36] thessalonians
[1:00:38] verse let's say this verse 16. he says
[1:00:40] rejoice evermore pray without ceasing
[1:00:43] and in everything give thanks for this
[1:00:45] is the will of god in christ jesus
[1:00:47] concerning you quench not the spirit
[1:00:50] despise not prophesying prove all things
[1:00:54] hold fast to that which is good abstain
[1:00:56] from the appearance of evil and the very
[1:00:58] god of peace sanctify you wholly he says
[1:01:01] and and i pray notice he says i pray god
[1:01:04] your whole spirit and soul and body be
[1:01:07] preserved blameless under the coming of
[1:01:09] the lord jesus christ and that's exactly
[1:01:11] right there the condition what of wise
[1:01:14] foolish or why isn't forced virgins
[1:01:15] except obviously the first virgin didn't
[1:01:17] have the soul realm correctly
[1:01:18] uh but the rest the body and the salt
[1:01:21] the body and the spirit were
[1:01:23] right on they have kept themselves kept
[1:01:26] the spiritual round clean keeping these
[1:01:28] thoughts getting all these these black
[1:01:30] birds from landing and planting and
[1:01:32] building nests up here and you know the
[1:01:34] battles amen absolutely it's not easy he
[1:01:37] says faithful
[1:01:39] he says it is that uh faithful is he
[1:01:42] that called you who also will do it
[1:01:45] brethren pray for us greet all the
[1:01:46] brethren with the holy kiss i charge you
[1:01:48] by the lord
[1:01:50] that this epistle be read unto all the
[1:01:53] holy brethren so here this was commanded
[1:01:56] to this this this study right here or
[1:01:58] this this uh letter to be read to them
[1:02:02] why it was that important that they had
[1:02:04] to know these things to keep themselves
[1:02:06] prove all things pray without ceasing
[1:02:09] all those things then of course what's
[1:02:10] else is written i mean in the uh the
[1:02:12] rapture's in there too as well so
[1:02:14] he said so these things were what for
[1:02:15] our edification for what our knowledge
[1:02:18] for our revelation sure and it was it
[1:02:20] was made plain absolutely great
[1:02:22] plainness of speech right here yeah sure
[1:02:24] now let's continue on here
[1:02:27] he says now i would have you
[1:02:30] i would have you without carefulness
[1:02:32] he that is unmarried
[1:02:34] cared for the things that belong to the
[1:02:36] lord how he may play how many how he may
[1:02:39] please the lord so notice saint paul
[1:02:42] is is dealing with these he's dealing
[1:02:44] with the married and he's dealing with
[1:02:46] the unmarried so we want to find the
[1:02:48] difference here now notice he's dealing
[1:02:50] with the
[1:02:51] he's dealing with i'll say this natural
[1:02:54] life right now notice he says to the
[1:02:56] unmarried to the unmarried right now
[1:02:58] sister lydia
[1:03:00] can give herself to fasting
[1:03:03] is it hard to fast when she sees all
[1:03:05] those apple pies and those peach pies
[1:03:09] probably not
[1:03:10] but after a couple more months she'll
[1:03:11] probably be sick of them it won't be any
[1:03:13] any issue fasting in front of it and
[1:03:15] then what she can give herself to
[1:03:16] attention lord she's like dad give me
[1:03:18] the church keys i'm going to go a little
[1:03:19] early and pray at the altar oh my and
[1:03:22] then she might get here she says pray
[1:03:24] but let me enter into the presence of
[1:03:26] the lord first and get the tambourine
[1:03:28] and play the piano and bring the
[1:03:29] presence of god down say send me a
[1:03:31] minstrel
[1:03:33] let me get the presence of god then i'm
[1:03:34] in the presence of god there now notice
[1:03:36] she's single she can do these things
[1:03:37] there's no headship over outside her
[1:03:38] father well keep that always but then
[1:03:41] then of course uh but as far as having a
[1:03:43] husband she doesn't her only voice right
[1:03:45] now is her papa and so then she then the
[1:03:48] the presence of god is there then she
[1:03:50] kneels down the altar and starts praying
[1:03:52] and just praising god and preparing this
[1:03:54] place for service
[1:03:56] and she can do that
[1:03:59] as a single sister
[1:04:01] and she can do that continually as long
[1:04:03] as she be single but notice how the
[1:04:04] bible says in verse 33 but he that is
[1:04:07] married cares for the things that are of
[1:04:09] the world right brothers
[1:04:13] we've got to make some money
[1:04:16] we have to be faithful to our job we
[1:04:18] have a profession we have to provide now
[1:04:20] that we're married we have to provide
[1:04:21] for the wife
[1:04:23] she's got to eat
[1:04:25] she needs a new skirt
[1:04:28] she wants new uh uh what does my wife
[1:04:30] just bought some more
[1:04:32] bed sheets because
[1:04:34] ours are cheap and they're already bad
[1:04:38] so she wants new beds she
[1:04:40] say yeah go ahead buy them she bought
[1:04:41] them absolutely
[1:04:43] but now we i have to come well this is
[1:04:45] this is coming up this is we got to we
[1:04:46] got a plan we got to deal with the world
[1:04:48] we got to get everything the natural
[1:04:50] consumes us a lot of times right
[1:04:53] uh and that's how how he may please his
[1:04:56] wife correct amen and now the married
[1:04:59] sisters now they're bringing up children
[1:05:02] they're caring about bills and they're
[1:05:03] they're caring about this say hi what
[1:05:05] are we what are we fixing for supper
[1:05:06] what are we there's cares of the life of
[1:05:09] our sister lydia
[1:05:12] if she gets on her own
[1:05:14] she gets off work
[1:05:16] she stops grab some chick-fil-a or
[1:05:19] some chipotle real fast cause why is she
[1:05:21] single why not
[1:05:22] goes grabs her chick-fil-a eats it at
[1:05:24] home boom she's done now she can do
[1:05:26] whatever she wants
[1:05:28] if she wants to start painting
[1:05:30] a class she can start doing painting
[1:05:31] classes if she wants to do his arts and
[1:05:33] crafts if she wants to start an etsy
[1:05:34] shop she can do whatever she wants
[1:05:38] right
[1:05:41] sure i don't notice here
[1:05:43] but i would have you without carefulness
[1:05:45] no no absolutely now notice in verse 34
[1:05:48] he says now there is a difference
[1:05:50] between a wife he says and a virgin the
[1:05:54] unmarried woman careth for the things of
[1:05:57] the lord
[1:05:59] that she may be holy both in body and
[1:06:02] spirit
[1:06:03] but she that is married careth for the
[1:06:06] things of the world how she may please
[1:06:08] her husband right now notice saint paul
[1:06:12] is dealing with this in the natural
[1:06:13] realm as far as looking at the natural
[1:06:16] life but i want you to think this
[1:06:17] morning or this afternoon i'll say it
[1:06:19] like that
[1:06:20] think of this in the spiritual yes amen
[1:06:25] think of this in the spiritual
[1:06:27] those that have the holy ghost
[1:06:31] we are now consumed on how we will
[1:06:33] please the lord jesus christ
[1:06:41] those that are without the holy ghost
[1:06:45] they can still serve the lord
[1:06:48] but now notice they are they
[1:06:51] they don't have a real headship
[1:06:53] that's right
[1:06:54] okay
[1:06:56] notice they still care for the lord but
[1:06:58] notice that lord is not a husband yet
[1:07:02] there's a difference
[1:07:04] very good amen there's a big difference
[1:07:07] i heard i heard a minister preach one
[1:07:09] time he said he says the name of god is
[1:07:11] the lord jesus christ
[1:07:13] some people just want jesus
[1:07:16] jehovah's savior some just want to be
[1:07:18] saved and then live any kind of life
[1:07:21] they want
[1:07:23] but when jesus the savior jehovah lord
[1:07:25] becomes your savior he wants to be lord
[1:07:28] as well
[1:07:29] and what is that lord that's moving now
[1:07:31] into what a a romantic headship
[1:07:35] he wants to be you want your husband
[1:07:36] absolutely and then he wants that then
[1:07:38] they want the christ the anointing to be
[1:07:40] with it as well he want all that he is
[1:07:44] he is the lord he is your savior he is
[1:07:46] the anointing he is your all-in-all amen
[1:07:49] sure
[1:07:51] sure absolutely
[1:07:53] so what's the one difference really and
[1:07:56] unto the woman he said i will greatly
[1:07:58] multiply thy sorrow thy conception and
[1:08:00] sorrow thou shalt bring forth children
[1:08:01] and thy desire shall be to
[1:08:04] thy
[1:08:05] husband notice god had to place it that
[1:08:08] when a sister gets married what her
[1:08:10] desire will be to her husband amen sure
[1:08:13] now notice he's dealing with what one of
[1:08:15] his godly seed sure and he shall what
[1:08:19] rule over thee so i'll say this when you
[1:08:21] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:08:24] there is a spiritual connection that
[1:08:26] takes place and that spiritual
[1:08:28] connection that takes place makes you
[1:08:30] want and has it gives you the desire to
[1:08:32] serve the lord jesus christ amen
[1:08:35] amen and i told the the our home church
[1:08:37] there
[1:08:38] if you've ever watched elon musk you
[1:08:41] know who elon musk is he's that uh super
[1:08:44] smart uh car
[1:08:46] slash space slash doing everything guy
[1:08:48] right solar plant oh roof guy right does
[1:08:51] it all i mean he like does everything
[1:08:54] and if you ever watch one of his
[1:08:56] interviews
[1:08:57] like elon and they'll just ask him like
[1:08:59] a random question elon
[1:09:01] what do you think about forests
[1:09:05] and if you watch any questions he'll be
[1:09:07] like this
[1:09:14] and he'll take about 10 or 15 seconds
[1:09:16] 20.
[1:09:17] he won't say
[1:09:18] anything and then boom he gives his
[1:09:21] answer
[1:09:23] and people wonder why does he why elon
[1:09:25] why do you do that
[1:09:26] he said
[1:09:28] every question asked i want to answer it
[1:09:33] and base my answer on whether this will
[1:09:36] get me to mars faster or not
[1:09:40] he can ask you can ask about anything
[1:09:41] but his whole focus is getting to
[1:09:43] people on mars
[1:09:45] so if he answers this way will this
[1:09:48] impact or
[1:09:49] change my way or my my whole goal is to
[1:09:51] get to mars will this i want to answer
[1:09:53] this the way so this this goal right
[1:09:54] here gets done faster
[1:09:56] good
[1:09:57] so his whole mind is because he's like
[1:09:59] pretty much married to mars okay
[1:10:01] now if we could get that way in the
[1:10:02] christian faith
[1:10:06] [Applause]

[1:10:09] vang
[1:10:13] you're gonna have another child
[1:10:15] brother bangs can sit there like this
[1:10:20] and in his mind she'll be like is this
[1:10:22] going to help me get in the rapture or
[1:10:23] not
[1:10:25] well one more child hinder me from
[1:10:27] making this rapture
[1:10:28] you know i'm saying just an incarnate
[1:10:30] way but anyway we are in our decisions
[1:10:32] in life
[1:10:34] is this
[1:10:36] because each one of us has decisions
[1:10:37] every day we get asked this we got
[1:10:39] there comes a situation how do i react
[1:10:42] to this
[1:10:43] the main focus is this going to help me
[1:10:45] the way i react is is this going to help
[1:10:47] me make the rapture or not is this going
[1:10:50] to hinder my spiritual life or not is
[1:10:53] this going to keep the anointing away
[1:10:54] from me or not
[1:10:58] yeah absolutely
[1:11:00] why because you're married and you want
[1:11:02] to please your husband
[1:11:06] amen
[1:11:08] see that that is the mindset of a
[1:11:11] married woman
[1:11:14] sometimes i'll be working at like 1 30
[1:11:16] and i'm just jammed i'm just hanging off
[1:11:19] a piece of piper in a liftlessness and
[1:11:22] my wife's calling me i'm like come on
[1:11:27] and she was like hey what do we want for
[1:11:29] eating time like
[1:11:32] i'm like
[1:11:33] why now
[1:11:35] i keep thinking and i'm thinking
[1:11:37] she needs to know
[1:11:39] okay
[1:11:41] i'm thinking wow
[1:11:43] she has no idea what i'm doing right now
[1:11:46] but she so cares
[1:11:50] she wants things to be just right when i
[1:11:53] get home
[1:11:56] so that very small tiny i would consider
[1:11:58] tiny decision
[1:12:00] or tiny action
[1:12:03] compared to where i'm at 30 foot in the
[1:12:04] air hanging off this and trying to weld
[1:12:06] and
[1:12:10] that was
[1:12:11] that's a big thing for her
[1:12:13] yes amen because she wants to know what
[1:12:15] i what would make me happy
[1:12:19] and i've always got to keep that in mind
[1:12:23] [Laughter]
[1:12:25] what is sweet honey over there
[1:12:27] [Laughter]
[1:12:31] brother has been there
[1:12:32] yeah that's right sisters all as well
[1:12:38] hey man absolutely so you see what i'm
[1:12:39] saying i mean
[1:12:41] single sister you want to stand here
[1:12:43] remember call your husband's at 3 35
[1:12:46] [Laughter]
[1:12:48] as soon as i get off work unless it's
[1:12:50] emergency now
[1:12:52] now notice the headship
[1:12:55] a married holy ghost child woman
[1:12:59] to christ
[1:13:02] that we henceforth be no more children
[1:13:04] tossed to and fro carried about with
[1:13:06] every wind of god doctrine by the slight
[1:13:08] of men and cunning crafts whereby they
[1:13:10] lie away to deceive
[1:13:12] but speaking the truth and love may grow
[1:13:14] up into him all things which is the head
[1:13:17] even christ so who if we are baptized
[1:13:20] with the holy ghost are we the body of
[1:13:21] jesus christ
[1:13:23] absolutely are we then now the now who
[1:13:26] is our if we are the body who's the head
[1:13:28] jesus christ
[1:13:30] where's the thoughts coming where's the
[1:13:32] thinking come from
[1:13:33] christ
[1:13:34] now remember
[1:13:36] it's like this
[1:13:38] how much connection would there be
[1:13:41] if i could take my head off well i'll
[1:13:43] say like this you would wonder
[1:13:46] if i said in my mouth which is
[1:13:47] connecting my head which is my head
[1:13:50] i'm going to move my left arm and i go
[1:13:52] like this
[1:13:54] he's like man this guy's got major
[1:13:56] issues
[1:13:57] because the head wants to move the left
[1:13:59] arm and here my right arm
[1:14:01] moves
[1:14:02] it shows there's what a disconnect
[1:14:04] something's
[1:14:05] not exactly wired correctly it's not
[1:14:08] having the right signal sent
[1:14:10] but the body's missing the signals of
[1:14:13] what the head's desiring
[1:14:15] amen see so then
[1:14:18] it's especially like that in the
[1:14:20] spiritual
[1:14:22] yes
[1:14:23] when god wants something to take place
[1:14:26] and he's tries to convey the message and
[1:14:28] gets that signal down to the body
[1:14:31] is the body reacting correctly or is
[1:14:33] that signal being jammed somewhere is
[1:14:36] that signal not reaching the body
[1:14:38] because the body should be doing the
[1:14:40] very will of jesus christ if it's the
[1:14:42] head amen
[1:14:44] if we have that connection with god we
[1:14:45] should be doing exactly what he wants
[1:14:48] god help us absolutely sure
[1:14:51] now notice here in ephesians 5 and 22
[1:14:53] wives submit yourselves unto your own
[1:14:54] sends husbands to the lord for the
[1:14:56] husband is the head of the wife now
[1:14:59] notice even as christ is the head of the
[1:15:02] church and he is the savior of the body
[1:15:05] once again christ is the head of the
[1:15:08] body absolutely
[1:15:10] the natural wives
[1:15:12] have natural husbands
[1:15:14] and the wife must react
[1:15:17] and do things accordingly
[1:15:19] sure
[1:15:21] and notice
[1:15:22] no man ever yet hateth his own flesh he
[1:15:24] says but nourishes it and cherishes that
[1:15:26] it even as the lord the church he says
[1:15:30] for we are members of his body look at
[1:15:32] we are direct we are one
[1:15:35] we are one with christ if we have the
[1:15:38] baptism holy ghost we're just coming
[1:15:39] brother if we are one we are connected
[1:15:42] with christ absolutely we are one
[1:15:45] but then now
[1:15:46] as this thing takes place we've got to
[1:15:49] get in tune with the connection or the
[1:15:51] moving of or the mind of christ
[1:15:56] he says we are members of his body of
[1:15:58] his flesh and of his bones for this
[1:16:00] cause shall a man leave his father and
[1:16:02] mother and shall be joined unto his wife
[1:16:03] and they too shall be one flesh now
[1:16:05] notice this is a great mystery by but i
[1:16:08] speak concerning christ and the church
[1:16:10] now notice
[1:16:11] how powerful is it now notice he says
[1:16:14] remember in corinthians there it says he
[1:16:16] says uh the virgin is concerned about
[1:16:19] how he she pleases the lord and while
[1:16:21] the married one is concerned about how
[1:16:23] she pleases her husband and if you look
[1:16:25] here a beautiful example this is in
[1:16:27] first peter three and six and it talks
[1:16:30] about how he's dealing with holy women
[1:16:32] and sisters of this and sisters that
[1:16:34] notice even as sarah obeyed abraham
[1:16:37] calling him lord see so even your
[1:16:39] husband can become lord to you and
[1:16:42] absolutely that's exactly what it is
[1:16:44] the the virgin knows them as christ as
[1:16:46] lord but the wife knows him as lord and
[1:16:49] husband absolutely whose daughters you
[1:16:53] are he says as long as you do well and
[1:16:55] be and are not afraid with any amazement
[1:16:58] now
[1:17:00] there's a couple things i want to
[1:17:03] because i
[1:17:04] i've heard some things
[1:17:07] through the grapevine and
[1:17:10] now notice this in hosea 11 10
[1:17:13] they shall walk after the lord he shall
[1:17:16] roar like a lion when he shall roar then
[1:17:19] the children shall tremble from the west
[1:17:21] what's the interpretation is brother
[1:17:24] i don't know all i know is the lions
[1:17:26] roaring
[1:17:28] and lions roar for certain things
[1:17:31] sometimes for
[1:17:33] hunger
[1:17:36] sometimes to show
[1:17:37] territory
[1:17:40] and this time
[1:17:42] looks like for judgment
[1:17:44] for thus saith the lord
[1:17:47] for thus hath the lord spoken unto me
[1:17:49] like as the lion and the young lion
[1:17:51] roaring on his prey notice he's coming
[1:17:55] to get he's going to destroy he says
[1:17:58] when a multitude of shepherds is called
[1:18:01] forth against him he will not be afraid
[1:18:04] of their voices see there is pastors
[1:18:06] coming that are going to dis discredit
[1:18:08] god almighty
[1:18:11] nora base himself from the noise there
[1:18:13] there's there are some pastors that's
[1:18:15] going to blast christ they're saying
[1:18:18] he's not coming and we can do whatever
[1:18:19] we want and debase god and god says
[1:18:22] there's coming to a point where he's
[1:18:23] going to say that's enough
[1:18:26] and now notice
[1:18:28] he says nor basis of self from the noise
[1:18:31] of them so shall the lord of hosts come
[1:18:33] down to fight from mount zion
[1:18:36] who is zion
[1:18:38] we are the bride is zion
[1:18:41] absolutely see so he's going to what
[1:18:44] there's going to be people coming to
[1:18:45] fight god in other words they're
[1:18:47] fighting the bride
[1:18:48] but when you fight the bride you're
[1:18:50] fighting god
[1:18:54] he says for lo i begin to bring evil on
[1:18:56] the city which is called by my name and
[1:18:58] should be uh utterly unpunished shall
[1:19:02] ye shall not be unpunished for i call
[1:19:04] upon a sword upon all the inhabitants of
[1:19:05] the land or the earth sorry saith the
[1:19:08] lord of hosts therefore prophesy thou
[1:19:10] against them
[1:19:12] all these words and say unto them the
[1:19:14] lord shall roar from on high and utter
[1:19:17] his voice from his holy habitation
[1:19:21] he shall mightily roar out his
[1:19:23] habitation upon his habitation he shall
[1:19:25] give a shout
[1:19:26] as they that tread the graves against
[1:19:28] all the inhabitants of the earth sounds
[1:19:29] like the coming of the lord
[1:19:32] and notice he's roaring out
[1:19:34] he's bringing forth notice it's the lion
[1:19:37] of the tribe of judah
[1:19:41] he's coming to destroy
[1:19:45] now notice here
[1:19:46] in verse 14 12
[1:19:49] let them give glory unto the lord and
[1:19:50] declare his praise in the islands the
[1:19:53] lord shall go forth as a mighty man
[1:19:55] he shall stir up jealousy like a man of
[1:19:59] war he's going to stir up jealousy
[1:20:02] why did why let me say this why the
[1:20:04] pharisees said she wanted to kill jesus
[1:20:05] christ when he came the first time of
[1:20:07] jealousy
[1:20:09] because god was blessing his works he
[1:20:12] was god was performing works through
[1:20:14] jesus christ god was performing all
[1:20:16] these works he was performing all these
[1:20:18] works in in his
[1:20:20] original church
[1:20:21] science ones are miracles that were
[1:20:23] untold he was performing these and what
[1:20:24] they the devil got jealous and anointed
[1:20:27] his children to start destroying that's
[1:20:28] right
[1:20:29] right
[1:20:31] but notice this time god's going to do
[1:20:33] it again
[1:20:35] i wonder if this has to do with
[1:20:38] the greater works
[1:20:40] that last anointing that anointing comes
[1:20:42] down upon his bride and she does the
[1:20:44] greater works exploits the bible says
[1:20:47] and what the entire world or those that
[1:20:49] can see it will become jealous
[1:20:51] and he shall cry a roar he shall prevail
[1:20:54] against his enemies he says i have long
[1:20:56] time holding my peace
[1:20:58] i have been still and refrain myself now
[1:21:01] while i cry like a travailing woman i
[1:21:02] would destroy and devour once
[1:21:05] he's done playing games
[1:21:08] so now notice
[1:21:10] and here's where i'm kind of
[1:21:12] wondering about
[1:21:17] i'm worried
[1:21:18] i'm a little concerned about
[1:21:21] the message believers we've got to
[1:21:24] because we know the seven thunders are
[1:21:26] coming
[1:21:27] as far as the classes clarity
[1:21:32] and what they will produce
[1:21:33] but notice this is the voice of jesus
[1:21:36] christ
[1:21:37] will they be able to recognize what
[1:21:40] these are if this is the voice of christ
[1:21:43] then his wife will be able to discern
[1:21:45] these and call them out for what they
[1:21:47] are and it will move them into action
[1:21:52] so notice here
[1:21:56] read verse one and i saw another mighty
[1:21:58] angel come down from heaven so here's
[1:22:00] christ coming down clothed with the
[1:22:02] cloud
[1:22:03] and a rainbow was upon his head and his
[1:22:05] face as it were the sun and his feet
[1:22:06] pillars of fire and he held in his
[1:22:08] little hand an open book and he set his
[1:22:10] right foot upon the scene his left put a
[1:22:11] foot upon the earth
[1:22:12] and notice this angel this christ this
[1:22:15] is the the anointed one
[1:22:17] cried with a loud voice as when a son a
[1:22:19] lion roarth and when he had cried seven
[1:22:22] thunders uttered their voices
[1:22:24] when he cried seven thunders under the
[1:22:26] voices
[1:22:28] and when the seven thunders and other
[1:22:29] voices i was about to write but now
[1:22:31] notice what takes place
[1:22:33] the one that was descending blasts them
[1:22:36] out
[1:22:36] but notice a voice from heaven
[1:22:40] says unto me seal up those things which
[1:22:43] the seven thunders under and write them
[1:22:45] out notice the father says
[1:22:46] hold back
[1:22:50] the son of god's the blasting is out and
[1:22:52] yet it's not time he says write them now
[1:22:54] seal those things up which the seventh
[1:22:56] one is under and write them out not and
[1:22:58] the angel which i which i saw stand upon
[1:23:00] the scene upon the earth lifted up his
[1:23:01] hands in heaven square by those things
[1:23:03] and moving on now
[1:23:05] so notice there's two voices right there
[1:23:06] there's the voice of the son of god
[1:23:09] and then the voice from heaven
[1:23:11] and then now notice in verse seven
[1:23:13] there's another voice
[1:23:14] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:23:16] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:23:18] sound the mystery of god should be
[1:23:20] finished as he declared unto his
[1:23:21] servants the prophets right yes sure and
[1:23:24] now notice
[1:23:25] and the voice which i heard from heaven
[1:23:27] directly after this
[1:23:29] we're supposed to hear another voice
[1:23:31] from heaven
[1:23:33] spake unto me again and said go take
[1:23:36] that little book which is open in the
[1:23:37] hand of angel what this book had the
[1:23:39] seven seals ripped off of it and now
[1:23:41] that book is delivered down and what the
[1:23:44] the holy ghost tells them go take this
[1:23:46] book
[1:23:47] right
[1:23:48] so now they've taken this book and now
[1:23:50] he's supposed to eat it and now he's
[1:23:52] supposed to
[1:23:53] not only eat it but then what prophesy
[1:23:55] again correct
[1:23:59] but to do all those things they have to
[1:24:01] be able to recognize the voice
[1:24:08] you know my pastor brother cam
[1:24:10] just got a book in the mail
[1:24:16] that said the seven thunders
[1:24:18] were the seven church ages
[1:24:20] or something of that fact
[1:24:22] and guess what he had quotes
[1:24:24] he had quotes
[1:24:28] but does that ring true through the
[1:24:30] scripture
[1:24:31] is that what the spirit is trying to say
[1:24:34] through that
[1:24:36] or is that the prophet just saying it
[1:24:39] in a kind of a
[1:24:40] cloudy kind of way
[1:24:42] or was he thinking something else was he
[1:24:43] not quite clear on what he was trying to
[1:24:45] say
[1:24:46] right or maybe the prophet was just
[1:24:48] presuming right or just guessing he did
[1:24:50] a lot of that sure yeah absolutely
[1:24:53] so now
[1:24:55] moving on here
[1:24:57] and i was thinking of these things uh
[1:25:00] and i kept thinking
[1:25:02] it just blows me away the
[1:25:05] the level of deception and
[1:25:07] and i know i focus on this a lot because
[1:25:09] i don't want to be deceived
[1:25:13] and now i'm going to go like am i going
[1:25:14] to go every night i'm going to be like
[1:25:16] am i going to try and work no i'm going
[1:25:18] to be like lord but my mind is focused
[1:25:20] on it's like lord show me what i need to
[1:25:23] see
[1:25:26] and i have to put faith
[1:25:29] in what i have asked of him that he is
[1:25:31] going to reveal everything we need so we
[1:25:36] will not be deceived but it's going to
[1:25:38] be by the holy ghost the holy ghost is
[1:25:41] going to drop these revelations he's
[1:25:43] going to show you certain quotes that
[1:25:45] have never been touched before he's
[1:25:46] going to show you things that have never
[1:25:48] been brought this way in the scripture
[1:25:49] he's going to show you types in the old
[1:25:51] testament that are going to ring true
[1:25:54] absolutely that's why these seals are so
[1:25:56] important you can you can see it all the
[1:25:57] way through let me say this
[1:25:59] i was talking brother randy
[1:26:01] he said brother you can see that first
[1:26:04] the four horse riders are writing
[1:26:05] revelations 4. i'm sorry genesis 4
[1:26:08] we see cain go up with his false worship
[1:26:11] which was a false doctrine
[1:26:14] abel had the right one because there's
[1:26:16] twins
[1:26:17] there's the white horse rider
[1:26:19] trying to show abel who went up the
[1:26:20] worship first came
[1:26:22] trying to show
[1:26:23] abel how to worship
[1:26:25] abel says
[1:26:28] abel goes and worships this way brings
[1:26:30] the lamb slays the blood and the blood
[1:26:32] is indicated
[1:26:34] that's the first word right what's the
[1:26:35] next horse rider
[1:26:36] the red horse rider who kills who kane
[1:26:39] then kills
[1:26:40] abel
[1:26:41] right there's your tourist writers
[1:26:43] what's the what's the black horse rider
[1:26:46] it is a a blackness but it's also a
[1:26:49] famine and notice the judgment that
[1:26:51] comes on cane
[1:26:53] upon the ground fruits will not grow
[1:26:56] any more on the ground for you anymore
[1:26:58] there's what a family right there
[1:27:00] black horse rider
[1:27:02] now it's the pale horse is what we know
[1:27:04] the name of the pale horse it's death
[1:27:06] and the bible says what god gave cain a
[1:27:08] mark
[1:27:10] spiritual death and then he what he then
[1:27:12] and the brother man said what he said
[1:27:14] this was his fatal mistake
[1:27:16] he left the presence of god
[1:27:20] there's your four horse riders right
[1:27:22] there in genesis 4.
[1:27:26] what because now the seals are opened
[1:27:28] and we can see them
[1:27:31] and trace them
[1:27:35] absolutely amen sure
[1:27:38] but reign is a revelator
[1:27:40] now and i kept thinking about these
[1:27:42] false now notice
[1:27:44] dealing with the false now how do they
[1:27:46] get so anointed
[1:27:49] right
[1:27:50] because there's anointed ones you see
[1:27:51] him i mean beth just visited upc church
[1:27:55] anointed
[1:27:56] holy ghost falls over there but they
[1:27:58] still believe in tongues is the evidence
[1:28:00] of the holy ghost
[1:28:02] they can't get past it that's an
[1:28:04] absolute to them
[1:28:05] now notice what he says he says the same
[1:28:07] holy spirit
[1:28:09] that anoints the church
[1:28:11] that gives them desire to save souls
[1:28:15] that gives them power to perform
[1:28:17] miracles
[1:28:19] notice what the holy ghost does the holy
[1:28:20] ghost what makes you want to win souls
[1:28:22] it wants to do and show that jesus
[1:28:24] christ is alive
[1:28:26] but notice he says it falls on the just
[1:28:29] the unjust just the same as the just
[1:28:33] the very same spirit
[1:28:38] he says now you can't make it any other
[1:28:40] way understand matthew 24 24
[1:28:42] he said there shall fall rise false
[1:28:44] christ false anointing to us anointed
[1:28:46] with the genuine thing
[1:28:49] but be false prophets of it false
[1:28:51] teachers of it right
[1:28:52] what would make a man want to be a false
[1:28:54] teacher of something that's truth the
[1:28:56] anointing
[1:28:58] he can have in his heart a belief a
[1:29:00] false belief but because he can the
[1:29:03] presence of god will fall down on him he
[1:29:05] believes he's correct
[1:29:07] because he's seeing results we're seeing
[1:29:09] the moving of the spirit he's seeing
[1:29:11] what signs wonders and miracles and what
[1:29:13] the people are catching fire and yet
[1:29:15] he's teaching something false
[1:29:19] i kept thinking lord how does this
[1:29:20] really really work
[1:29:24] what would make a man want to be a false
[1:29:26] preacher that's something of something
[1:29:28] that's true now we can get down to the
[1:29:30] mark of the beast a few minutes and
[1:29:31] you'll see its denomination
[1:29:36] remember that seed line is all i'll say
[1:29:39] like this
[1:29:40] i taught this a while back in at home
[1:29:46] this nature we battle
[1:29:52] you know this guy
[1:29:53] simon smith
[1:29:55] this thing
[1:29:56] is full of problems
[1:29:59] it gets
[1:30:01] think think of this in your mind
[1:30:04] adam and eve in the garden
[1:30:08] adam and eve just happy
[1:30:11] everything is wonderful
[1:30:14] and let's say like this
[1:30:16] adam and eve were walking
[1:30:18] and a big wind because the prince of the
[1:30:20] power of the air is there
[1:30:22] a big wind lord tornado comes into the
[1:30:25] garden of eden
[1:30:26] and eve's like what is this head what is
[1:30:28] this adam's like
[1:30:29] no fear he's like
[1:30:32] peace be still
[1:30:36] and the tornado subsides
[1:30:38] do you think adam went
[1:30:40] stupid wind
[1:30:43] there was nothing haughty about adam
[1:30:47] his nature now notice there's two
[1:30:49] natures here we're dealing with two
[1:30:51] natures
[1:30:55] there's the natures of the sons and
[1:30:56] daughters of god
[1:30:58] and there's the natures of the serpent
[1:31:00] seed
[1:31:03] animal nature
[1:31:05] though they're falling watch animal
[1:31:07] nature
[1:31:09] you know what i don't like being unhappy
[1:31:13] because that was not my original nature
[1:31:19] adam and eve walk in the garden
[1:31:21] and they haven't went this path in the
[1:31:23] garden a little bit and a tree had grown
[1:31:25] up past and blocked one of the the
[1:31:27] pathway kinda and it's in their way and
[1:31:30] eve's like adam how are we gonna get
[1:31:32] past this thing how are we gonna get the
[1:31:33] best tree adam goes
[1:31:36] tree be plucked up and move over there
[1:31:40] and boom the tree sucks up
[1:31:42] tippy toes on his roots like a ballerina
[1:31:46] sucks back in the ground up here
[1:31:48] right
[1:31:48] adam and eve go through the little path
[1:31:50] and this and that do you think adam went
[1:31:53] i've never liked that tree
[1:31:56] that tree had it out for me i knew it
[1:31:58] did
[1:31:59] last time i went through here that tree
[1:32:00] was giving me a bad eye
[1:32:04] there was absolutely no evil thought
[1:32:06] against that tree ever
[1:32:09] and you think adam said i'm gonna watch
[1:32:11] i'm gonna keep my eye on that tree from
[1:32:12] now on
[1:32:14] that was not his nature
[1:32:18] see all these things you're battling
[1:32:19] you're battling serpent nature
[1:32:24] let me prove it to you
[1:32:25] in genesis 4
[1:32:27] as soon as cain left the garden
[1:32:29] we see kane what building cities
[1:32:32] creating civilization
[1:32:34] then we see a man take two wives
[1:32:36] polygamy
[1:32:38] in a lust problem right then we see what
[1:32:41] people building uh
[1:32:42] working with metal and all those sort of
[1:32:44] things and then we see the same man who
[1:32:46] had plugged me he went into what he
[1:32:47] became a serial killer he killed two men
[1:32:50] look at all this
[1:32:52] things look at what these animal nature
[1:32:54] did it produced all this wickedness
[1:32:57] good very good
[1:33:00] let's get out of that genealogy
[1:33:02] genesis 5 and we look through and this
[1:33:05] is the generations of adam
[1:33:08] and adam begot seth and seth was a
[1:33:10] warmonger doesn't say that
[1:33:12] that's right
[1:33:14] you don't see anything negative in that
[1:33:16] seed line it was that pure still
[1:33:21] this thing we're battling here is
[1:33:23] serpent nature
[1:33:25] bitterness evil thoughts
[1:33:28] you name it that paul saint paul said
[1:33:31] would not inherit the kingdom of god
[1:33:33] that is serpent
[1:33:35] well now we're stuck with this nature
[1:33:39] that's why jesus had to send the holy
[1:33:41] ghost
[1:33:43] because we're stuck with it now
[1:33:46] we it's not it's not christ's fault did
[1:33:47] he set the stage for it he's at the
[1:33:48] stage four but we he gave us free moral
[1:33:50] agency and he allowed adam and eve to
[1:33:52] fall into this
[1:33:54] and now that it was their choice we're
[1:33:55] stuck with it but god gave a way out and
[1:33:57] that is what be those that are led by
[1:34:00] the spear are the sons and daughters of
[1:34:02] god amen and if you live by the spirit
[1:34:05] and walk by the spirit you'll not
[1:34:07] fulfill the lust of the flesh
[1:34:10] amen sure
[1:34:14] so now let's continue on here hope that
[1:34:15] was all right now now the prophet of god
[1:34:17] breaks this down pretty easy as dealing
[1:34:18] with the the the false anointed
[1:34:22] and you know how simply he taught it he
[1:34:24] taught it with the orange tree and he
[1:34:25] was down in florida there or whatever
[1:34:28] and he went over this man's house
[1:34:29] whatever there's this tree and it had
[1:34:31] tangelos it had lemons
[1:34:34] it had grapefruit and then it had
[1:34:36] oranges and brother bran was like what
[1:34:38] kind of tree is this
[1:34:40] what's going on here
[1:34:42] and he started asking question after
[1:34:43] question
[1:34:47] he said look at this he says oh i guess
[1:34:49] it was in arizona he says he had a
[1:34:51] citrus farm and he had a tree there that
[1:34:53] was on or and it was an orange tree and
[1:34:55] yet it was bearing grapefruits
[1:34:57] lemons tangerines tangerines and i
[1:34:59] forget how many different fruits on that
[1:35:00] tree
[1:35:02] and brother man says what kind of tree
[1:35:03] is that
[1:35:05] this is a tremendous teaching in a
[1:35:06] moment of the holy ghost for the prophet
[1:35:09] and he said the tree itself is an orange
[1:35:11] tree the brotherhood rams confounded
[1:35:14] what
[1:35:16] why does it got grape grapefruits and
[1:35:18] lemons on it
[1:35:20] and this man gave a tremendous statement
[1:35:22] he said they're grafted
[1:35:24] into it
[1:35:26] this is brand new to brother graham he's
[1:35:27] like what
[1:35:29] he said
[1:35:30] they're grafted into it
[1:35:33] i said
[1:35:34] why is it god he says well i see he says
[1:35:38] i said now next year when the the tree
[1:35:40] comes forth another crop of fruit
[1:35:43] he says which they were all ripe and
[1:35:45] about the same time i said then will it
[1:35:46] bring forth all together oranges
[1:35:50] so now he had a question he said he's
[1:35:52] seeing all these different fruits all
[1:35:54] these different branches in the same
[1:35:55] tree and he says now like okay
[1:35:57] all these fruits are going to go because
[1:36:00] they pass
[1:36:02] the tree is going to be bare
[1:36:03] they said but now when life comes back
[1:36:05] in the spring
[1:36:08] are all these gonna have oranges on it
[1:36:11] and the man said
[1:36:13] no sir every grafted branch will bring
[1:36:16] forth of its kind
[1:36:18] you mean the lamb and vine will bring
[1:36:20] forth the lemon out of the orange tree
[1:36:21] he said yes sir
[1:36:25] do you see why we're seeing what we're
[1:36:26] seeing in the message
[1:36:29] whatever someone is is what they will
[1:36:33] produce
[1:36:42] when i was a pentecostal
[1:36:44] i was trying to witness to bring people
[1:36:46] in to be a assemblies of god
[1:36:50] because that's that's what i was i was
[1:36:53] part of that branch at the time
[1:36:56] i'd say like that
[1:36:59] and a baptist when he witnesses to you
[1:37:02] he's gonna try and make you a baptist
[1:37:04] and i just met an american baptist it's
[1:37:05] another whole branch i never heard of it
[1:37:06] before it's called the american baptist
[1:37:10] and i got to witness to him and he was
[1:37:11] like
[1:37:12] i don't know about that once we get over
[1:37:14] there we'll figure it all out i'm sure
[1:37:16] i'm like no i'm telling you i can shoot
[1:37:17] he's like
[1:37:19] well from my teaching i've studied i've
[1:37:21] studied a lot but it's probably not what
[1:37:23] you're saying but okay all right
[1:37:25] that's what that branch says
[1:37:29] he says will the will the grapefruit
[1:37:31] bring forth grapefruit out of the orange
[1:37:32] tree he said yes sir that's the nature
[1:37:36] of the branch that's grafted into it i
[1:37:39] said praise be to god
[1:37:41] what he said the great the guy is like
[1:37:43] what do you mean he says one more
[1:37:44] question the prophet the prophet is
[1:37:47] spiritual here he's looking at things
[1:37:48] like
[1:37:49] evan the revelation is breaking and he
[1:37:51] says one more question now will that
[1:37:53] oris tree ever bring forth oranges again
[1:37:56] he says when it puts forth another
[1:37:58] branch
[1:37:59] hey
[1:38:00] man
[1:38:06] why do you think we're seeing so much
[1:38:07] division
[1:38:09] in this message
[1:38:12] i'm going to tell you how this works at
[1:38:14] least from what my best understanding
[1:38:18] the message has went out into the world
[1:38:22] the gospel net and it's called this and
[1:38:24] it's called that
[1:38:26] and god allows their eyes to let them
[1:38:28] see the good word and taste it of the
[1:38:30] spirit and all those things they come in
[1:38:32] and if they are not from the original
[1:38:35] spoken word in genesis 1
[1:38:38] if they were not a son of god originally
[1:38:40] and they entered they and they grabbed
[1:38:42] themselves in with the message
[1:38:44] and start taking
[1:38:47] message principles which is gospel
[1:38:50] and catch the revelation and they have a
[1:38:52] gift of faith
[1:38:54] and they pray and fast and as the angel
[1:38:57] will tell the prophet if you'd be more
[1:38:58] sincere you'll see greater
[1:39:00] things
[1:39:02] so something false can come in and
[1:39:05] copy the exact same technology i'll say
[1:39:07] like that spiritual technology
[1:39:09] on how to bring the spirit down no
[1:39:11] notice balaam said
[1:39:13] let me get in the spirit first
[1:39:15] let me let's worship correctly let's get
[1:39:17] into the worship first he knew the
[1:39:20] proper approach to bringing god down
[1:39:23] but because he was the wrong kind of a
[1:39:26] branch
[1:39:27] still incorporated because the bible
[1:39:29] said jesus will not not he'd not turn
[1:39:31] anyone away
[1:39:33] anyone that wants to give god glory
[1:39:35] anyone wants to serve god god is going
[1:39:36] to let him serve him but it depends on
[1:39:38] what they are is what they'll bring
[1:39:40] forth
[1:39:43] that's why we're seeing so
[1:39:45] many deeds
[1:39:49] interesting stuff and that holy ghost is
[1:39:51] still going to anoint them good and bad
[1:39:55] because what they've grabbed they've
[1:39:57] they're they're pulling from this they
[1:39:58] still believe the same promises
[1:40:01] i'm healed
[1:40:03] and yet not even not even orange tree
[1:40:06] i can do this and i can do that i can
[1:40:08] speak to the mountain it's still not
[1:40:11] orange
[1:40:12] because what they've caught the concepts
[1:40:14] they caught the revelation of it
[1:40:16] saint paul said though i know all
[1:40:17] mysteries they'll have all faith and
[1:40:19] move mountains and do this and that he
[1:40:20] says if you were not sealed with the if
[1:40:23] you're not married
[1:40:25] to the ones he says it'll profit you
[1:40:28] nothing amen
[1:40:30] sure
[1:40:31] right
[1:40:32] wow i'm already an hour i'm sorry no
[1:40:37] and here's here's what i'm i want to hit
[1:40:39] some things here now
[1:40:42] uh i want to touch touch this real quick
[1:40:45] dealing with here one little change this
[1:40:46] and this
[1:40:48] uh
[1:40:49] and i was dealing with false apostles
[1:40:50] here in the first church age
[1:40:52] um but we're going to skip that i want
[1:40:54] to do this
[1:41:00] so here the prophet says what is the new
[1:41:03] birth then
[1:41:05] you'd say well brother branham what is
[1:41:07] the new birth it is the revelation of
[1:41:09] jesus christ personally to you
[1:41:12] amen see not to join a church you shook
[1:41:14] a shook a hand you've done something
[1:41:16] different you set a creed you promise to
[1:41:19] live by a code of rules
[1:41:21] but christ the bible he is the word that
[1:41:24] was revealed to you
[1:41:29] and no matter what anyone says what
[1:41:31] takes place it's christ it's jesus
[1:41:33] christ pastor priest whatever it might
[1:41:35] be it's christ in you that is the
[1:41:37] revelation that the church was built
[1:41:39] upon
[1:41:41] absolutely
[1:41:42] now notice
[1:41:43] and i'm going to hit something here
[1:41:44] because
[1:41:45] this was recently mentioned to a brother
[1:41:48] in our assembly
[1:41:50] but i'm going to read this quote here
[1:41:51] first by god's grace
[1:41:53] now notice what is it it's christ being
[1:41:55] revealed he is the word
[1:41:58] and when the word is revealed it
[1:42:00] expresses itself see that's god's
[1:42:02] purpose for jesus christ was to express
[1:42:04] himself to take his own laws and live by
[1:42:06] his own laws and fulfill his law by
[1:42:08] death and christ god died in flesh in
[1:42:11] order to condemn sin in the flesh that
[1:42:13] he might bring to himself a glorious
[1:42:15] bride redeemed back
[1:42:17] that will believe only in the word of
[1:42:21] god
[1:42:22] now that's the headship believes what
[1:42:25] the body will believe the word of god if
[1:42:28] they if the head
[1:42:30] has been connected to the body
[1:42:33] it literally only
[1:42:36] now that body's head is the head and
[1:42:39] that's christ and the thought that's
[1:42:41] going this body and this has been said
[1:42:42] is the scripture and the revelation of
[1:42:45] what this is
[1:42:47] yes
[1:42:50] and why are people so the quotes are the
[1:42:51] absolute the message of the absolute
[1:42:53] what is the message
[1:42:55] where's the clarity on that maybe we
[1:42:56] could do it i'm sure jess or brother
[1:42:58] jose's even got that figured out already
[1:43:02] now notice
[1:43:05] believe only in the word of god and not
[1:43:07] swap it like eve did for intellectual
[1:43:09] conceptions of man you see that's
[1:43:10] christ's idea that's god's ideal he says
[1:43:13] what the new birth reveals this
[1:43:17] you know what i like doing i like going
[1:43:18] the message software and say
[1:43:21] uh new birth reveals or the new birth
[1:43:24] does this the new birth does that what
[1:43:25] does the new birth do it points to god
[1:43:28] almighty it points to his word
[1:43:31] if the bible in the holy ghost are not
[1:43:33] your absolute
[1:43:35] have you been born again i'll say it
[1:43:36] like that yes
[1:43:38] sure now notice then the body bride must
[1:43:41] follow the hand why because she's
[1:43:43] married for it is part of his
[1:43:45] resurrection and part of the mystery
[1:43:47] it's impossible not for it to go oh how
[1:43:50] it's part of god's mystery how god
[1:43:52] revealed himself here and raise it up by
[1:43:53] the word so he reveals the church and
[1:43:55] raises up by the same
[1:43:57] word it's a part of his threefold
[1:43:59] mystery now notice
[1:44:00] as the head was took from the grave
[1:44:03] as the head christ was took from the
[1:44:05] grave so must the body follow him back
[1:44:08] to eden
[1:44:11] where the head the family head of the
[1:44:13] family the man the bridegroom the bride
[1:44:16] being the body of the bridegroom must
[1:44:17] follow the follow the bride because
[1:44:19] that's the hand sure wherever christ is
[1:44:22] is where the body will follow that's why
[1:44:24] he's a rapture because of the if the
[1:44:26] headship comes down
[1:44:28] he's looking for his body his bride and
[1:44:30] then when the headship goes up the body
[1:44:32] goes with him sure and the head head is
[1:44:36] revealed and come back with eternal life
[1:44:38] and the head must follow that because it
[1:44:40] is husband and wife again amen and as
[1:44:42] long as you're pregnant with the same
[1:44:43] word which is his body took his body
[1:44:46] become in him and you took the word not
[1:44:47] a creed the word oh my sure now notice
[1:44:51] therefore the body
[1:44:53] those born again those in the bride
[1:44:56] cannot recognize he said don't fail this
[1:45:04] the body therefore cannot recognize any
[1:45:06] other headship
[1:45:09] than the word
[1:45:11] because the head is connected with the
[1:45:13] body and the head is the word it's the
[1:45:15] same word one headship
[1:45:17] therefore denominations holy fathers and
[1:45:20] everything else is dead dung i'll say
[1:45:22] this organization
[1:45:24] there is one headship that's christ the
[1:45:26] body recognizes one thing
[1:45:28] the word absolutely now
[1:45:32] i'm going to share this real quick with
[1:45:33] you guys i know it's where a second
[1:45:35] shift or second shift
[1:45:36] second service and i'm already getting a
[1:45:38] little long here okay now
[1:45:41] now notice this
[1:45:42] dealing with the deeds of nicotines you
[1:45:44] know how these deeds and the doctrine
[1:45:45] started
[1:45:46] it first become a saying
[1:45:49] okay
[1:45:50] in other words a minister would say
[1:45:52] such and such
[1:45:54] and this man right here would hear it
[1:45:55] and be like and he would start repeating
[1:45:56] it
[1:45:57] and then another man would hear and
[1:45:58] starts repeating it
[1:46:00] so something was just said to our
[1:46:01] brother in our church
[1:46:04] and the brother was talking to another
[1:46:06] brother and they said well our church
[1:46:08] teaches this and the brother said well
[1:46:10] that's probably because they they are
[1:46:11] addicted to pornography
[1:46:17] you know why because that laity member
[1:46:19] heard a minister say that
[1:46:22] so in other words if you disagree
[1:46:25] with something a another minister or a
[1:46:27] big-name minister or however
[1:46:29] if you disagree with some of his beliefs
[1:46:31] it's probably because you have a
[1:46:33] pornography issue
[1:46:35] and that saying now is going out into
[1:46:37] the message because it was just said to
[1:46:39] one of our brothers in the church
[1:46:42] these guys have
[1:46:43] gifts beyond profit level or just as
[1:46:46] profit level do they
[1:46:47] or are they starting a saying to
[1:46:49] demonize things
[1:46:54] you see where this thing's going i i was
[1:46:56] just blown away when this brother told
[1:46:58] me this
[1:46:59] and then it becomes a doctrine didn't
[1:47:00] they didn't they not say jesus was
[1:47:02] beelzebub
[1:47:03] he said thou has to devil and jesus said
[1:47:04] i don't have a devil you have a devil
[1:47:08] but notice who throws the first stone
[1:47:13] see sure now i want to rehash this real
[1:47:15] quick
[1:47:17] because i taught this already here once
[1:47:20] but i want to rehash
[1:47:22] this and i want if there's anything in
[1:47:24] this this little study here at the end i
[1:47:26] want you to remember this
[1:47:29] because remember there's a difference
[1:47:30] between a virgin
[1:47:32] and the bride
[1:47:34] and the married and the married will
[1:47:36] only
[1:47:38] the married
[1:47:39] this is her absolute right
[1:47:43] and we've hit this before i'm gonna show
[1:47:44] it to you okay
[1:47:46] remember this
[1:47:49] brother van can can you read this one
[1:47:51] and two
[1:47:52] go ahead and read that out loud
[1:48:07] thank you brother
[1:48:10] so these men these pharisees and
[1:48:12] sadducees are watching christ they're
[1:48:13] watching jesus
[1:48:15] and they're his disciples
[1:48:18] and they notice one thing
[1:48:20] why are they not washing their hands
[1:48:23] before they eat
[1:48:25] remember this
[1:48:27] before they eat bread why don't they
[1:48:29] wash their hands
[1:48:32] why is this in the bible
[1:48:35] why is this
[1:48:37] god anointed
[1:48:38] matthew to record this in the scripture
[1:48:41] why
[1:48:42] remember this
[1:48:44] thank you brother
[1:48:46] because of
[1:48:47] this was going on at that time
[1:48:51] at that time of christ's appearance
[1:48:54] the words of the scribes this was the
[1:48:57] saying this was the mentality this was
[1:49:00] the anointing of their spirit on that
[1:49:02] day the words of the scribes are lovely
[1:49:05] beyond the words of the
[1:49:08] law
[1:49:10] for the words of the law are weighty and
[1:49:13] light there's some deep things and
[1:49:14] there's some
[1:49:17] but all
[1:49:19] the words of the scribes are all weighty
[1:49:22] was pastored so and so when brother
[1:49:24] so-and-so preached this and this and
[1:49:26] this i'm like yeah wasn't the word
[1:49:28] you should have heard him say listen i'm
[1:49:30] like yeah but isn't the word
[1:49:33] i have to try every word anyone's i have
[1:49:36] to i have to try my own sermons i have
[1:49:38] to teach my own bible studies i have to
[1:49:40] try it by the word of god my own
[1:49:41] thoughts right
[1:49:43] now there's two men who had great
[1:49:46] schools at that time in the time of
[1:49:48] christ or just before
[1:49:50] hillel and
[1:49:52] shamiyah
[1:49:53] the two heads of their famous schools
[1:49:55] and other ancient doctors from
[1:49:58] whom were delivered by one to another
[1:50:00] certain rules and laws of their own
[1:50:02] devisings which had no foundations in
[1:50:04] the world of god or the word of god so
[1:50:06] there's two great men who had teaching
[1:50:08] schools in the jewish era
[1:50:11] pre-christ or however
[1:50:13] and they started making their own
[1:50:15] doctrines
[1:50:17] 20 years ago
[1:50:19] behind the pulpit this was a no-no
[1:50:22] you know my pastor but i can before he's
[1:50:24] a minute before he's even ministering
[1:50:27] he went to work one day worked a 10-hour
[1:50:29] day
[1:50:31] and we lived an hour and 10 minutes away
[1:50:32] from church in lima
[1:50:34] but the cam got in his car
[1:50:36] probably dressed while he drove which he
[1:50:38] could do i couldn't do that
[1:50:40] putting on the tie just driving like you
[1:50:42] know
[1:50:43] he gets down there and they call him the
[1:50:45] lead songs he's like okay brother
[1:50:47] and he's going up and he's prepping to
[1:50:49] sing and a brother comes back there and
[1:50:50] says brother what's what's this right
[1:50:53] here
[1:50:55] kim's like what do you mean he goes
[1:50:57] don't you know you got a bad spirit if
[1:50:59] you don't shave before you sing songs
[1:51:01] kim's like
[1:51:03] i just worked a 10 hour day i drove an
[1:51:04] hour and 10 minutes i got dressed
[1:51:07] and you're worried about this
[1:51:09] i didn't have time to shave
[1:51:11] you know he didn't say that
[1:51:13] but what they're making up these
[1:51:15] doctrines
[1:51:17] they're saying he had a bad spirit
[1:51:19] because he had facial hair
[1:51:21] because he didn't have time to shave
[1:51:23] before service and yet he drove
[1:51:25] sacrificed all this to drive down there
[1:51:27] to lead songs to enter into worship
[1:51:29] because he's got a voice
[1:51:32] but they demonize it
[1:51:37] now everybody in the message is growing
[1:51:38] a beard preaching
[1:51:43] and our god almighty jesus christ came
[1:51:46] down with a beard absolutely
[1:51:48] yeah amen
[1:51:50] certain rules and laws of their own
[1:51:52] devising which had no foundation in the
[1:51:54] word of god and of these scribes and
[1:51:57] pharisees were more tenacious than of
[1:51:58] the scriptures they would hold faster to
[1:52:01] these main man man-made doctrines than
[1:52:03] to the word of god
[1:52:09] watch watch what's coming in the message
[1:52:10] i'm worried i'm a little nervous
[1:52:12] know then that the words of the scribes
[1:52:14] are more lovely than the words of the
[1:52:16] law
[1:52:17] now notice
[1:52:19] this other guy says
[1:52:20] if a man does not read he only
[1:52:22] transgresses the an affirmative but if
[1:52:24] he transgresses the words of the school
[1:52:26] of this big man he is guilty of death
[1:52:31] you see anything outside of the word of
[1:52:33] god brings forth death
[1:52:35] it doesn't matter
[1:52:37] because he hath broken down a hedge and
[1:52:39] his servant shall bite him puts a curse
[1:52:40] on him
[1:52:42] if you do not follow this man's
[1:52:43] teachings on how he's this or this and
[1:52:45] however this and this he says he says
[1:52:47] not only are you worthy of death there's
[1:52:48] a curse coming something's going to bite
[1:52:50] you
[1:52:52] and puts it on the people
[1:52:53] and they believe
[1:52:56] it he says the words of law having them
[1:52:59] both
[1:53:00] prohibition and permission some of them
[1:53:03] light some of the heavy but the words of
[1:53:04] the scribes are all them heavy sure my
[1:53:08] weightier are the words of the elders in
[1:53:11] the words of the prophets
[1:53:13] my goodness sure
[1:53:15] notice
[1:53:19] my son attended the words of the scribes
[1:53:21] more than to the words of the law for in
[1:53:23] the words of law are affirmatives of
[1:53:25] negatives but the words of the scribes
[1:53:28] everyone that
[1:53:29] transgressed the words of the scribes is
[1:53:30] guilty of death so now they're going as
[1:53:32] far farther than that
[1:53:34] and notice it comes down to this whoever
[1:53:37] eats bread without washing your hands is
[1:53:39] if you lay with a
[1:53:42] makes it completely equal
[1:53:44] you become a whoremonger if you didn't
[1:53:46] wash your hands
[1:53:47] they're putting an evil spirit on you
[1:53:49] they're judging you by something that
[1:53:51] they have made a doctrine he that
[1:53:54] blesses food with defiled hands is
[1:53:56] guilty of death
[1:53:59] whosoever does not wash his hands as as
[1:54:02] is as as is fitting
[1:54:04] although he is punished above he is
[1:54:07] punished below
[1:54:09] they've already put him in hell
[1:54:12] didn't wash your hands
[1:54:13] obviously you're a serpent seed
[1:54:15] you can't even be saved
[1:54:18] carry on
[1:54:22] this was the condition of what laodicea
[1:54:24] in the old testament
[1:54:27] laodicea our age in the old testament
[1:54:30] what more is coming
[1:54:33] and to fright people in observant to
[1:54:35] this tradition they talk of shibta a
[1:54:39] sort of an evil spirit that hurts such
[1:54:41] as eat as eat without washing their
[1:54:44] hands in other words if you do not wash
[1:54:46] your hands an evil spirit called this
[1:54:49] guy
[1:54:50] is going to get you
[1:54:52] they say he sits upon their hands and
[1:54:54] upon their bread and leaves something
[1:54:56] behind which is very dangerous
[1:54:59] it just becomes from one insanity to the
[1:55:01] next
[1:55:04] now notice this isn't the true
[1:55:06] church of god
[1:55:09] this is not
[1:55:10] moloch's temple or the philistine temple
[1:55:12] or dagon's temple this is in the the
[1:55:14] very god of jerusalem's temple his
[1:55:17] teachers his ministers
[1:55:21] and it is recorded to the praise of our
[1:55:23] akbar
[1:55:24] this guy this man
[1:55:26] that he chose rather to die
[1:55:29] notice how this false doctrine was so
[1:55:31] instilled that he would rather die than
[1:55:33] to transgress this tradition for being
[1:55:36] in prison and in want of water what
[1:55:39] little he had he washed his hands with
[1:55:41] it instead of drinking it and he died
[1:55:43] because of dehydration
[1:55:46] because he would rather hold to a
[1:55:47] tradition he would die the natural death
[1:55:53] eliezer ben what's his name was
[1:55:55] excommuted for excommunicated for
[1:55:57] despising the tradition concerning
[1:55:59] washing of hands
[1:56:01] and when he died the sanhedrin sent and
[1:56:04] put a great stone upon his coffin to
[1:56:06] show that he had died in this
[1:56:08] excommunication and then they stoned his
[1:56:10] coffin
[1:56:11] for not washing his hands before he ate
[1:56:18] amen
[1:56:19] now let's stay on the stand
[1:56:21] i mean i'm an hour and 20. god have
[1:56:22] mercy you guys are
[1:56:25] pray for me
[1:56:26] you guys are great god bless you stan
[1:56:28] let's go like this a little bit are we
[1:56:29] okay
[1:56:30] all right there you go
[1:56:33] amen praise the lord let's just finish
[1:56:35] here right here
[1:56:36] what is the difference between
[1:56:38] a virgin and a wife
[1:56:43] he said
[1:56:44] what was left over don't let us stay
[1:56:46] till morning
[1:56:47] to come into another age burn it with
[1:56:49] fire be destroyed
[1:56:50] that age you're living in the message of
[1:56:53] this age
[1:56:54] he says what is this message of this age
[1:56:56] got to do
[1:56:57] it's got to be brought out of the
[1:56:59] scriptures
[1:57:00] and vindicated and proved by god that
[1:57:03] it's god doing so
[1:57:05] then you either receive it receive that
[1:57:08] or reject it he said that's
[1:57:11] eternal life the leadership of the holy
[1:57:14] ghost leading his church
[1:57:17] do you know when he preaches
[1:57:19] this is the second sermon before the
[1:57:21] prophet left
[1:57:23] the second service
[1:57:25] before the second the last sermon that
[1:57:27] god would allow this man to preach
[1:57:29] the prophet of the hour and he said this
[1:57:31] message has to be vindicated through the
[1:57:33] scriptures
[1:57:37] and you know what
[1:57:39] who's going to get us there are the
[1:57:40] quotes going to get us there
[1:57:42] did you know there was a speaking in
[1:57:43] tongues and interpretation in this
[1:57:45] sermon
[1:57:46] and i listened to part of it guess what
[1:57:47] this interpretation was the second last
[1:57:50] sermon
[1:57:51] this is an evil hour this is an evil day
[1:57:55] and thou shalt not be deceived
[1:58:00] listen push play and obey
[1:58:02] don't say that holy ghost does not say
[1:58:04] that holy ghost says study every message
[1:58:07] know it by the back of your hand look at
[1:58:10] every quote my prophet said he does not
[1:58:12] say that
[1:58:13] notice what the holy ghost says and thou
[1:58:15] shalt be led by my spirit
[1:58:18] and be conformed to my
[1:58:20] word
[1:58:22] and be and behold i will keep thee and
[1:58:24] preserve thee and shall keep thee true
[1:58:27] and i shall revive thee unto the day of
[1:58:30] light
[1:58:31] of my coming r
[1:58:35] it is all the working of the holy spirit
[1:58:40] amen
[1:58:42] all right one last one last scripture
[1:58:43] here i was gonna actually dramatize this
[1:58:45] but we're not gonna do this
[1:58:47] eliezer comes down
[1:58:49] finds the great rebecca right
[1:58:53] at least come on girl let's go
[1:58:55] mama mama and brother like no she's
[1:58:57] staying 10 more days hey ladies come on
[1:58:59] man i'm already blessed let me go let my
[1:59:02] people go
[1:59:05] and finally say well let rebecca come
[1:59:07] and say what she wants to say what's her
[1:59:08] choice she says
[1:59:10] i'm going elijah's like right on let's
[1:59:12] go
[1:59:13] they all get up on their camels start
[1:59:16] rolling
[1:59:18] and eliezer
[1:59:20] from the time they leave to the time
[1:59:22] they get there is telling her about
[1:59:24] isaac
[1:59:26] you know isaac's isaac's three persons
[1:59:28] she's like really i'm marrying three and
[1:59:31] he's like yeah
[1:59:33] the next day
[1:59:34] ellie easter's like
[1:59:36] no isaac's one person what you just said
[1:59:39] the other day that no he's one she's
[1:59:41] like okay
[1:59:42] he's a nice guy he's a nice guy
[1:59:44] then eliza starts breaking other things
[1:59:46] you know ellie easier is like you know
[1:59:48] when you become pregnant and and you
[1:59:50] receive his seed you know it's two
[1:59:52] different things
[1:59:53] and she's like huh
[1:59:55] and then right before they get done off
[1:59:57] these camels elusive is like
[1:59:59] okay when you get pregnant you've
[2:00:00] actually received the seed it's one of
[2:00:02] the same she's like
[2:00:03] that's what i thought okay praise the
[2:00:05] lord
[2:00:07] and so she's hearing all these things
[2:00:08] and she's like well he's a really really
[2:00:10] good brother really great guy i'm so
[2:00:11] great so grateful that isaac abraham
[2:00:14] would send him to me to get him
[2:00:17] but at the end of the ride
[2:00:19] but at the end of the ride after all
[2:00:21] this talk about isaac and this and this
[2:00:23] and this
[2:00:25] in verse 64 rebecca lifted up her eyes
[2:00:28] and when she saw isaac she lighted off
[2:00:30] the camel she jumped off the camel
[2:00:34] and she said unto a servant what man is
[2:00:37] this that walketh in the field to meet
[2:00:39] us and the servant said it is my master
[2:00:42] therefore she took a veil
[2:00:46] and covered herself yes
[2:00:49] when she first got on the ride to go to
[2:00:51] meet isaac did she veil herself before
[2:00:53] eliezer
[2:00:56] no why what does the veil prove
[2:00:58] the veil proves that she's moving now
[2:01:01] into headship
[2:01:06] a woman cannot do what she wants the
[2:01:08] bible says a woman is a byproduct of man
[2:01:10] she's not even in the original creation
[2:01:12] or
[2:01:13] that's exactly right she was took from
[2:01:14] the man she was a man with both
[2:01:17] feminists now no listen did you notice
[2:01:19] when rebecca was went to meet isaac when
[2:01:21] she jumped off the camel she veiled her
[2:01:23] face why she was coming to her head
[2:01:28] they don't know it they have to do it
[2:01:30] anyhow did you notice a woman when she
[2:01:32] gets married she puts a veil over her
[2:01:33] face why she's coming to her head and
[2:01:36] the church the church being the bride
[2:01:39] should veil herself to any creed
[2:01:42] cover her headship to any creed she's
[2:01:45] coming to her head the word christ is
[2:01:47] the word and he is the head
[2:01:51] amen
[2:01:53] one last here
[2:01:55] notice what john the baptist said
[2:01:57] he that is the bride he that hath the
[2:01:59] bride is the bridegroom
[2:02:02] but the friend of the bridegroom who's
[2:02:05] that brother branham who's that john the
[2:02:06] baptist who's that eliezer the friend of
[2:02:08] the bridegroom which standeth and
[2:02:10] heareth him rejoices greatly because of
[2:02:13] the bridegroom's voice that my joy
[2:02:15] therefore is fulfilled amen praise be to
[2:02:18] god
[2:02:19] brother branham is not our head
[2:02:23] christ jesus christ is our head the holy
[2:02:26] ghost is our headship amen
[2:02:28] so that is the difference that is the
[2:02:30] difference
[2:02:31] a married woman those of the holy ghost
[2:02:34] can recognize the voice of the holy
