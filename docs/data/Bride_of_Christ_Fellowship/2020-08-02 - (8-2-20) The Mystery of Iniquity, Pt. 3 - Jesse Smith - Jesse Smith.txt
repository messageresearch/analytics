thessalonians chapter two i forgot brother forgive me oh yeah i'm sorry yes okay thank you brother wonderful let's go to second or second thessalonians chapter two forgive me yes sir sorry about that brother let's read our scripture for our texts we'd like to look at the mystery of iniquity part three this morning we like also like to read our memory verses as well so second thessalonians 2 verse 7. okay let's read verse seven together let's read it on three one two three for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way praise god and i'm sorry brother but our brother gave us the memory verse it's matthew 6 26 to 34. is that right good thank you matthew 6 26 sermon on the mount praise god that's where i was hoping to get today for my sermon too so praise the lord matthew 6 26 praise god okay that's fine brother okay yes sir yeah let's do so let's go to 6 30 30 to 34. beautiful beautiful portion of scripture here aren't you thankful for the red letter words praise god amen the literal words of our lord jesus christ praise god matthew 6 30 to 34. let's read those together on three one two three wherefore if god so clothed the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you o ye of little faith therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewith all shall we be clothed for after all these things do the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof let's all say amen amen god bless you as being seated praise god thank you brother i'm sorry about that i forgot you sent me that forgive me how many had a busy week this week anybody else have a busy week okay praise the lord but it's been a great week in the lord thankful for god's mercy uh and his grace i want to uh just have a little visual here acacia so you can switch over here uh we'll look at uh mystery of iniquity again but i just like to um you pull up the three parts of a man here briefly and just use it as an illustration here if we can we'll try to be real careful with the time here by god's grace i forgot to recognize solomon right salmon uh johnny and sarah's nephew let's give him a round of applause god bless you sir [Applause] looks a lot like his dad harry don't he looks and i like it god bless you simon good to see the saints appreciate the sacrifice saints have made pressing out to the house of the lord today you know wednesday by god's grace we started looking at the characteristics of satan and cain and how iniquity started in satan's heart in heaven and then on wednesday we saw how when he came to earth uh that nature uh of course of satan it went into the serpent and then the serpent seed passed into cane and then cain because he had the wrong seed started producing the same characteristics of his father for adam was not his father praise god uh adam was a son of god cain was the son of the wicked one but of course we now know through the flood and everything that that nature has creeped into every human being and that's why god had to send a greater nature praise god on the day of pentecost he sent the divine nature amen down into the soul of man deeper than the flesh where you could feel him on your body deeper than the mind where you would think beautiful thoughts and prophesy and see dreams and visions but down into the soul down into the very nature of the christian amen praise god remember you're directed the nature of your mind is your soul so we want to look at that lord willing today a little bit more by god's grace we saw five characteristics of the mystery of iniquity and so the first one is they go through vain yet beautiful religious acts creating their own traditions and so we want to make sure our it's okay to have traditions the bible says that paul said it's okay to keep traditions as long as they're bible traditions praise god as long as they're as long as they are are are sincere and as long as they're pleasing to the lord there's nothing wrong with having a tradition we know there's christian liberties right uh you can have different liberties paul says there's some people that really honor this day there's some people that really honor that day paul said as long as you've got goodness in your heart as long as you're not causing to stumble he said that's fine go ahead and do that praise god so we are thankful for christian liberties praise god but uh the the the spirit of uh antichrist in the spirit of iniquity develops sinful traditions that break the word and we saw on wednesday that it creeps it slowly creeps into the house it's slow it's a slow thing it's not instant usually it's usually slow one one day uh it gets in a little bit the next day a little more a little more a little more uh like you know i'll just be honest i had a gentleman from overseas text me this week and he was trying to get he he started off by watching uh the evil movies just like rated our movies and uh and then he went to pornography and then he was even uh hiring prostitutes and he's like how do i get rid of this brother jesse pray for me he said he said i know the righteous a prayer of the righteous man availed much and so i was sharing with him how it slowly creeps in it starts with one little mistake and then that if you don't repent of that and clean that up it goes a little further a little deeper a little deeper until it's a total corruption it's like the power of leaven but i thank god that uh the spirit-filled christians life is the opposite its footsteps are possession one step at a time amen one day at a time sweet jesus that's all i'm asking of you praise god it's for each day to grow closer to the lord each day at a time and let holiness uh further take over our houses praise god and secondly workers of iniquity don't abide in the truth they despise the truth as cain left the presence of the lord and john said they went out from us because they're not of us and remember church this all happens here in this in this realm here because remember in your soul you start with a holy desire now i wish i would have put that in there the holy thirst but abraham says every every person starts with a holy thirst and and if they fill their minds and so they fill their spirit minds with with evil thoughts with evil desires if if they keep feeding their mind evil things then they will hush this this holy thirst in the soul and then the soul disbelieves because the soul that sinneth the soul that disbelieveth it shall die and so the mystery of iniquity is is is going through acts religious acts uh but filling the mind with evil thoughts right and then ultimately that hushes the holy thirst where they don't desire for all of god remember church we're not kept outside of the holy spirit the holy the veil's been torn we're invited in praise god i'll say like this there's angels inviting us come in in other words let the be born again let the holy spirit fill your soul let god's nature become your nature praise god the angels of god are trying to usher us into the presence of god amen and yet the antichrist spirit will deny that and it will create its own traditions and then it will lead the presence of god third they deny the full power of the holy spirit they have power for miracles right they have power for prophesying powerful anointings but it's only temporary it's not permanent and then we saw forth that satan's children just lie all the time they lie they lie in their doctrine they lie in their their daily lives they lie all the time in fact i was listening to brother peregrine's testimony brother jose and he was talking about these well-known ministers that were wrong with brother branham are not going to name their names because it might really it might really stumble people is that what you were thinking praise god amen men that were very close to brother branham and years after brother and passed they would go talk and they would they would assemble together and they and they would get to talking about different doctrines and the brothers some of them that were very close to brother branham would admit to hating other preachers in the message now isn't that a sad thing when we when we think we're so smarter we think we've got so much revelation that we can start hating other people the only thing we should hate is sin praise god and a lot of that church is in your flesh it's in your members there's a part of us that we hate a part of us amen not the soul but the flesh amen but see this is how people can be so close to brother abraham now look they can l they live so holy church because they know the man of god is holy but when he goes off the steam they backslide because their holiness never was their own it was somebody else's but i don't want to know jesus through somebody else i want to know of myself amen i want to know him in the power of his resurrection so i can see his life resurrected living in me amen and that's when it comes down to the life these people were anointed uh in brotherhood's time they respected brother brahm but the life never got into them and so they hate and you know what i'm talking about they would hate and they'd try to get a repent these brothers wouldn't even repent they said well that's how brother graham said i was that doesn't mean brotherhood never said it's okay to remain in sin praise god so see they have all these excuses and i'm not saying everybody that's just a few but see they lie they lie and they hate they're full of hatred see because they they hush this holy thirst they won't let god into the very depths of their being and so they backslide here more and more and more all the time in their minds they think that wrong thoughts they say the wrong words and then they persecute and kill the righteous we know like lucifer starting wars and kane the first murderer and jesus said if you're even angry with somebody without a cause you're in danger of hell fire now the sixth attribute the last one i have at least lord willing in the book here uh will be satan's seed have sorrow over their sins but they never repent now that's worldly sorrow i've preached that to you many times but let me just go over briefly everybody feels bad when they sin right and when and when a worker of iniquity sins they feel bad but their life never changes see how it's all about the life amen it's all about the life of the seed of god within us amen they don't have the life they never change their behavior now cain doesn't have a record of godly sorrow about murdering abel you know but you know what he has he has sorrow because god cursed him from the earth isn't that awful first listen to this i wrote this i felt led of the holy spirit god sentenced him to become a fugitive in a vagabond and look the pitiful lying wretched cane he's only sorry for himself look think about that he just killed his brother and he's not sorry for his brother he's sorry about the punishment for himself that's serpentine right he's complaining about his punishment no remorse for his dead brother and so see church serpents eat our workers of nuclear they only care about themselves now jose interesting he he could cry his own voice in my he said my uh my punishment's greater than i can bear but he couldn't hear the blood of his brother crying from the ground amen oh god now church i'll say like this there's times i pray and i feel like i can hear the the blood of these innocent children that were aborted it feels like i can feed them i can hear their voices crying out to heaven this nation's under judgment and god help us just to pray and save as many as we can in this wicked age 46 million since 1964 46 million uh blood voices crying up to god for vengeance upon this earth oh my all he can do is think about himself he has emotional pain but it never he has pain here but it never breaks down to where he would change his desires see see souls that choose hell are worthy of it i hate to say that but it's because they refuse to respond to their sorrow see sorrow and pain is a good thing i was listening to a testimony from a preacher and he was saying he met a woman whose daughter was born and she couldn't feel pain so she would touch hot stoves it would burn her skin but she couldn't feel it and it broke the mother's heart she would touch you know like needles and bleed and wouldn't feel it and the the preacher was making a point he was saying the mother prays now she gets injured right she got injured and her body's injured but she can't feel it and the mother he's making the point the mother is praying god help my daughter to feel pain ah in church god thank god that god allows us to feel pain praise god see potentially that little girl can lose her life because she doesn't feel pain thank god for pain amen thank god for conviction is what i'm saying amen thank god that we feel bad when we sin because that's the way we rejoice in mercy and forgiveness amen that mother praise god help my daughter to feel pain and that's my prayer today isn't it yours amen god help me to feel the pain if i hurt my brother if i hurt my sister god help me to feel that so i can make it right and not cause people pray but cause of joy praise god pain is a good thing sorrow here is a good thing that's right church but yet the serpents see they hate holiness they fight against it they blaspheme it and god will strive he'll be patient he'll send them pain pain pain to finally he knows when they sell their souls to the devil which is called the reprobate mind and the bible says god shall send them a strong delusion to believe a lie that they all might be damned who believe not the truth but add pleasure in unrighteousness we should thank god for pain we should thank god when we're ashamed of ourselves praise god the bible says we can hate our sin and jude 1 23 hating even the garment spotted by the flesh jude is not talking about your clothes getting a stain of barbecue sauce on it that's not what he's talking about he's talking about your spiritual uh your spiritual character getting a stain of guilt on it and he's talking about we should hate the garment we should hate our spiritual state that's spotted by the sins of our flesh amen yes our souls if we're born again our souls never sin but paul said everybody but jude says here your spirit in your mind your mind gets defiled in church if you lose that battle you your soul can't do much if your spirit's not winning the battle praise god sometimes you wonder where's my spiritual armor how come i'm not winning the victories because the soul the life of the soul has to come out to the mind right and it's gotta we gotta have full confidence in our mind that god's gonna hear me because i've confessed my sins i've washed my garments white and i can have confidence that god will hear my prayer yes it's the garment spotted by the flesh that human mind now when i preach it i said how sinners have worldly sorrow they have emotion they feel awful for their sins but they don't bring forth fruits of repentance praise god can you look at your life and see fruits of repentance so like if if a friend was causing you to struggle did you see a repentance where you confess your sin or maybe you separated yourself from your friend or can you see if you offended a friend that you had enough fruit to go back and say i'm sorry that's fruit let me understand what i'm talking about that's real fruit that proves you are really sorry that proves you really felt the sorrow of how that that that sin hurts the heart of god yes that's right and so church that's what the the the mystery of iniquity they won't have the fruits of repentance it's never visible in their life now they get close right because you can you can be very close pharaoh and here's the examples pharaoh admitted he sinned against the lord on multiple occasions and he even asked moses to bless him oh everybody wants to be blessed right but they don't want to live the life balaam admitted to the angel that he was sinning when he when the uh he met him there and the donkey kicked him remember he admitted it but the angel still let him go now balaam really would have been sincere he would have said no i realize i'm wrong i'm going to go back but see he wanted to go so the angel let him go aiken acknowledged his sin but the fierce anger of god caused him to be stoned and burnt by israel king saul admitted his sins of rebellion and stubbornness against god to the prophet samuel but then he spent years hunting david's life and finally repented right before he died ahab is one of the most amazing examples ahab repented and he and god told elijah go look how he humbles himself he fasts and rents his clothes now church when was the last time you know when you fasted because of your sin when was the last time you said god i'm not going to eat because i i don't want to sit in this this manner again that's that's real sincerity that's real sincerity now we don't have to fast like we're not catholics right we don't have to fast to prove it with our penance or anything like that but that i'm trying to show you the level of sincerity that ultimately a serpent seed went but he never he never obeyed in holiness it was just a short temporary sort of victory it wasn't a permanent victory because remember later just a few chapters after that makaya comes back and uh remember jehoshaphat's there and he says shall we go up to raymond gilead and jehoshaphat's like you got 400 prophets you got anybody else see he could feel that that this this crowd is wrong you ever felt that way you go to certain churches i know this crowd is wrong they might look happy they might look excited but i know they're wrong they got the lying spirit on them remember he says he said you got anybody else he's got yeah i've got one more holy roller preacher but i hate him a man that was just fasting sorrowful for his sins a murdering letting jezebel murder these problems he was fasting and upset and then a few if you see a few weeks later months later whatever years later he's back to hating righteous people again oh my how many are falling in love with your enemies we got anybody out there falling in love with your enemies as time goes on are you making more friends or more enemies church which one are you making now one way you might be making more enemies but you still should love them right i mean but look at this periods of real devotion sister look at that sister wendy of really fasting and asking god humility brother it real humility but then hating the word of god later righteousness that's iniquity he knew better because he fasted he knew it was wrong he bastard humming himself but now he's not humbling himself now he's exalting himself in pride like he's got a he knows more about it than a prophet the prophet knew more about it because he had visions amen god showed him the throne of god amen and the lying spirit come up to deceive ahab he had greater understanding now let me uh make sure i hit this real quick uh one of those six attributes is they leave them the ministry of god the fightful ministry okay so let me pull this up i've never seen this quote in this way before i think the holy spirit revealed to me this week here now just a simple thing uh my next video will be about uh the tape boys are not in the fivefold ministry i'm gonna keep blasting that that it's wrong it's wrong i know i laugh but it is so wrong brother man said you can't change one word you can't change one word now uh but here's where my brother ram says let me turn the sideways there we go that's better and then it skips down the silly thing i don't like evernote very much sometimes okay brother ram says he said some in the church teachers apostles prophets healings workers and miracles all these things are sent to church do you believe that i never did say i never did say where they'd be set out of the church he said them in the church for the perfecting of the church and to be in the church until he comes again remember church you have to take all these quotes back to where the bible where does the bible say pastors need to stop preaching and press play can somebody ever show me that can anybody no you'll never be able to find it and so when you look at the quotes overall you can see how brother branham was a word prophet and he told us to stay with the word they asked brother bran point blank are you the only preacher he said no we need all of god's men that are called to preach the gospel now there's lots of quotes here i'm going to skip past some of these brother bran's vision for the future and i look what he says and taking sides with jesus he's talking to brother christ brother junior jackson he said you're young man i'm getting old brother neville's getting old we're middle-aged men if time rolls on we're going to walk off the scene after a while and you've got to press play is that what he said no he said you've got to fill our shoes praise god he said go out there press play church the meaning of preach means to publish the news to publish with your voice what's already happened brother then jesus christ has raised from the dead amen and he's here in the power of his holy spirit to minister to all those who love him amen publishing with your voice and one of the points i'm going to make in that video lord willing if the lord will help me the bible said how beautiful are the feet of him who bring the good news and publish the gospel of peace since when does a cell phone or a tape player have feet on it do they have features does the tape player have feet no a preacher's got to have his own voice he's got to be living and he's got to have feet praise god and how beautiful these are now church they don't look very beautiful to me there i got new shoes on but they're they're not very that beautiful as far as my feet you should see my toenails hold on let's not go there but the bible says look at look at the one look who's willing to sacrifice john wesley traveled 40 000 miles a year on horseback amen preaching the gospel how beautiful are the feet of those who preach and proclaim god's good news to this generation that all they see is bad news but christ is good news how beautiful are those feet that will publish peace it's god's system when my days is finished i'm done best if i be god's servant god will raise him up another tape in that day when i'm gone so there's no need of me sitting around here in my theology it's me to live the life that i have wait on god for the next generation to come he will have a tape there when that generation comes up isn't it ridiculous church and yet millions church millions of people are swayed by that what is it brother jose it's the mystery of iniquity one word one word one word now watch there's a lot of there's a real there's a lot of people in there but if they've got the holy spirit god will guide them out of that because it breaks the word it exalts a man uh there i hate to say like this but they're letting dead a dead man preach and they they act like he's alive he is alive in the other dimension but not here and god he said god told joshua moses my servant is dead it's your turn amen you preach you lead him in there amen my servant brother bran was dead but now christ is in the fullness of the bird amen it's iniquity get off on one word just get them off on one word and then there'll be a snowball effect all right now there's so many quotes like this but amen bifold ministry for the perfecting of the church there's five offices he names the five gifts but they're all little lines of god aren't you glad there's a line there's a little phone line my phone's being used there but there's a little line from heaven and god's speaking to us today through the fivefold ministry right not just because i'm here no matter who's preaching god's got a little line he can talk to us aren't you glad god's put god's put that in the church for the perfecting of the saints those are for the perfecting of the church that is his proof amen glory his ministering spirit to the church to bring the body of christ together amen brother amen what is united you and i the gift of god through the preaching of the word the five full ministry with brother cam and brother simon and brother brooks and all these brothers preach sister wendy what is united us the five full ministries a line from heaven we hear from heaven it unites us it strengthens us and we get closer to god and one another it unites the body of christ amen he goes through all things that all of them are for the perfecting of the body of christ he said i said good on this one this is a good one here right here you're gonna like this one this one's good now those gifts are for the perfecting the church to keep the church in order thank god keep me in order jesus i don't want to get out of order i want to stay in order amen teachers evangelists profit somewhere now it's gifts now no matter how much these men here are gifted to preach you've got to also believe what they preach and i'll say it like this i've got to believe what i'm preaching right we've all got to believe i need to believe it praise god in other words when you come up for prayer i've got to have the same faith i've got to cast down all my doubts and just believe god's word and ask god to do what he promised to do amen amen to believe it we've all got to believe it you can do one good just to preach on and on you never get saved you die right in the pew and be lost that's it we're sitting right there you've got to believe what they're saying i love this preachy brother man now this one by the way i don't know if you've ever seen this one god is fortified and fortifying his army what is it with himself so god fortified fortifies his army with himself what he's himself in the form of prophets apostles teachers pastors what do you do what is god doing listen you ever think that the officers of the churches it's god's dress inside dress an apostle a prophet a seer i think i did this a few months ago didn't i god comes down like this and he puts on a dress and then he preaches behind me it's god preaching behind me right this is just brother jesse well jesse can fall he just he's nobody god can take this off but when god's preaching it's gone god's behind me it's saying it's children my children listen to my word love me obey my word do what's right amen let me complete your life let me fulfill your life let me move in your life let me move in your heart let me creep without creeping to your home throw open the door so i can get into your home amen god's dressed up in his church in the these offices is god's dress wear when you see those offices what is that that's god's dress where god's presence amen working through men and if any office denies do you see this any they're denying the prophet office and teacher then it's not god's dressing ah okay now i understand those aren't really the gifts of god then if they deny one word no not that that's wolf in sheep's clothing oh i'm so glad i found this quote watch that watch that fellow beware of him everybody like bows down to jeffersonville right they bow down you should hear some of the things they say every word is infallible every words thus saith the lord i don't worship brother branham but i worship the god in him now when did god ever tell us to do that when did paul ever say worship the god that's in me when did paul ever say that when did brother branham ever say that all of you stand and worship the god that's in me that's idolatry they say that all the time i just heard of this week somebody sent me a video of the leadership there saying that that's that's not it that's not what we do we worship the god that's in all of us amen the god that's in us the god that's with us the god that's above us the god who goes before us the god who goes behind us we worship the god who is unlimited amen but see they want to put all of god in brother ham in fact i saw i heard another idolatrous thing this week where the leadership said uh brother branham was exactly like jesus christ except the corporate body that's paganism right because jesus had a perfect mind brother vayne brother branham did not right you got three parts body spirit soul so they're saying brother branham has jesus mind fully fully and fully jesus's soul i'm sorry that's blasphemy that's my humble opinion i'm not saying thus saith the lord that's my humble opinion and that's the leadership there that's the family and you should see the people i can show you the video after but i'm trying to show you after service but i can show it to you everything they're shaking their heads like this everybody's shouting screaming praise the lord that's nonsense we should we only shout and scream for jesus christ he's the one amen he's the one that we give all worship honor he's the only one that can perfect us amen remember though that's god god's hiding behind this dress work now here's the quote i want to get to everybody look at this here this is in questions answers part 2 64. let me know there's four parts right so the questions answered 64. so in the second part brother man said the bride's elected of god the church goes through whosoever will don't come but the bride is the elected of god there's five offices now it goes through the offices now i'm skipping down god did that man has deacons so forth everything but god said in the church for the perfecting of the church can't divide it okay now how many remember the quotes i read earlier the the church is perfected through the five full ministry but it's christ in the five full ministry it's not me i can't i can't perfect you i can't do anything i can't help anybody only christ can help somebody now here's a quote where now uh the leadership will say uh we don't need the fivefold ministry to perfect us but watch the quote closely remember one week before he said we're perfected by the five-fold ministry a week later a person that he already knows from oregon says ephesians 4 do we get the perfecting the saints through the tapes or should we be here where the gifts of the spirit are operating and different places offices of the church to help us now this person from oregon i believe i know who it is so brother man knows this person see it's oh yes i certainly do okay your boy the person's here i know you're not it might have been last sunday your son flies conservations he knows a lot about him he's the one that invited me over to go elk hunting with your brother in oregon this is that's right now i know the person in my letter and so no they want to come to the church for the for the perfecting so look at brother man a week before he said perfection is through the fivefold ministry but now a certain family wants to move to jeffersonville to be perfected in jeffersonville that that'd be like saying we all need to move to jeffersonville so we can be perfected by that part of the five full ministry and broadband says no they want to come here for the perfecting he said that's we get fellowship with uh one another here at the church but the perfecting because it comes between us and god so see these are people brother amen they're trying to worship brother brown they're trying to just think well i can only get perfected if i go to jeffersonville the blood of christ is what perfects us in the holy spirit so see the leadership in jeffersonville will take this and say oh see we don't need the fivefold ministry but man says the perfection doesn't come through the fivefold ministry yeah but he did a week earlier so if this seems like a contradiction you've got to dig a little deeper and that's where you do it he says they want to come here they thought coming to jeffersonville would perfect them but he brother has to take it off and say it's not coming to the physical building it's coming to hear the preaching and then that will perfect you between you and god alone so see how he's see how church he's discerning spirits for all these years he say the fivefold ministry perfects the fivefold ministry perfects one person says we've got to come to jeffersonville to be perfected he said no it's between you and christ see the balance there everyone understand see this will stop this will stumble people because they don't read the other quotes oh forgive me what happened and one thing i want you to know i put it up there brother abraham never said perfection comes through the tapes only they asked him does it come to the tapes does it come through coming to jeffersonville he says it's between you and christ and the blood of christ amen thank the lord for that hallelujah and remember brother i'm never said rapturing faith is on the tapes he said rapturing faith is a ladder rain but do we listen to tapes absolutely that's where we get our inspiration from all right i got about 10 minutes here so let me jump back here that's where i left off in my studies is that okay by god's grace you would you'd be surprised one quote can cause a person who has an antichrist spirit on them to reject all the other quotes and just hang their soul on this one quote that shows it's the wrong spirit because the bible said if you've got the holy spirit you'll search the scriptures daily now this ain't a bible but you'd search the scriptures daily whether those things are right that means brother johnny i preach on sunday it's your job my job to go read the bible on monday it's all your jobs brothers sisters it's all your jobs search the scriptures daily christ is going to perfect you if you accept christ preaching on the weekends amen if you if you accept this week as preaching on the weekends and wednesday and then you're studying all through the week oh you're going to grow up into a real creature in christ jesus a new creation in christ because it's an everyday walk with the lord kind of like with brother amen and i on wednesday i had two songs i wanted to sing and i didn't tell brother amen he sang one of them and i didn't even ask him during the song service and then i was saying then he sang the second one at the end of the service and those the very ones i had written down on my sheet of i want to sing those i didn't tell them and probably said see the holy spirit will get into the psalm service and vindicate the preaching by the song service or vice versa amen see it it's what it's supposed to be a unity the holy spirit dealing through the songs dealing through the word dealing with our hearts to meet our needs that we need praise god so i hope that was i just felt led to stop and go over there now one more point jesus in the parable church of the the wedding garment je the king comes down to the banquet right before the rapture and so the holy spirit is going to come down in the latter rain right before the rapture and go through and take out all the foolish virgins out of the church that don't have the holy ghost praise god i mean that's what i believe that's part of the latter reign the holy spirit has to make one more trip he's got to make sure okay sealed sealed sealed sealed sealed sealed oh you're missing the baptism the holy ghost notice i didn't point any of you guys did you know what i'm saying sealed sealed sealed not sealed or not sealed you see him in there he's got to come down one more time amen glory the king himself brother amen the holy spirit himself has got to come down one more time and you got to separate those who have the garment from those who don't i want to be one of those who have the wedding garment on praise god i've got a testimony i can speak my testimony with my mouth i've been saved i've been satisfied i've been filled with the holy ghost thank god for the wedding garbage see even christ will come down and he'll separate even though they're not a even though the man without the wedding garment wasn't a worker of iniquity he wasn't born again so he still has to separate that desire that person who didn't desire to be born again he still got to separate them from the church now just got a few minutes here let me let me close with this thought here now let's just go back here i just want to briefly go over this again how does iniquity originate so in the book i'm going to call how iniquity originates in and fills the human mind now most of us know what we're talking about here iniquity originates in the human spirit right because we start with the holy thirst here but satan starts working on this to tempt us here in this realm of the human spirit right the mind he has full access to the body and mind as long as god allows it but thank god god has to allow it it'll never give us a battle we can't handle see everybody begins with that holy thirst and then jesus describes it in luke 12 we're not going to read it but we read it recently the rich man who desired to build his new barns he silenced his own souls thirst for god he said soul that has much goods laid up for many years take your eaves eat drink and be merry he said stop thirsting for god settle down just enjoy the pleasures of this life instead of preparing for the next life in his mind he got so preoccupied with his architectural drawing of his new farm buildings and his his grain bins ah brother he could see it he drew it out on one of those cab programs those computer cad programs he had a 3d printer print off a little copy of him oh guys look at this look here's there's my barn for my my seeds and here's this here's my dried fruits and here's my dried meat and whatever he had i don't know what else he had but he was so consumed with with his fleshly needs he told his soul stop thirsting for god when jesus said you ought to sell your goods and give them to the poor and come follow me and then you'll have treasures in heaven see told his soul stop trying to have treasures in heaven lay up treasures on this earth progress that was the same man as rich young ruler so that's a concrete example see that's where iniquity filled his mind and jesus said you fool your soul is going to be demanded back this very night he let all these thoughts come in and no we don't we don't see any adultery we don't see any murder just love of money just love of the world oh big barns financial bank accounts we i mean we all need savings but this guy was going way above and beyond church this guy was going for more than one month savings right or a thousand dollars in the bank account he's talking about years and decades and decades of money he'd probably never be able to spend that's why jesus says fool you should have given some of this to the poor so in his mind it was all about him just like judas i'm sorry just like cocaine it's all about him his life was all about himself instead of helping other people and church please sometimes i ask some of you this face to face but please if i can help you in any way financially if i can help you with any spiritual blessing or prayer or bible study please let me know i'm just begging everybody now if i can help you help me to know so i can help you if the holy spirit don't show me maybe then you just gotta tell me okay i'm not mr discernment like brother man i can discern all the thoughts and tense of all your heart well naomi needs this when he needs that i pray i pray for that i pray for your needs but if there's some way i can help you please let me know praise god because brother bang i don't want to live for myself and i pray for everybody here i pray for them but i want to live a life where i can store treasures in heaven where i can help out the people god sent me to there's my time so give me two minutes boy that went fast today's one of those days i could probably reach two hours but i'm not going to next week i probably will just because this is really hard i want to preach it um but you understand right everybody understand those are all pretty simple concepts but uh this is so helpful now and church oh my help me jesus bill i was studying billy graham's book this week billy graham has a book you can read most of it online it's called the holy spirit how to activate your faith and activate the spirit billy graham believes as soon as you as soon as you say you're sorry you're baptized with the holy ghost baptized with the holy ghost he said one baptism many refillings and church i watch his son go on interviews and they sit across from these painted up jezebels and high heels showing off their their chest you can see billy graham do the same thing he goes have interviews with people that are these women that are half naked and these are like sister i don't know about that i don't know but brother amen it was so clear to me this week that's why god had to send this message to take our holiness past the flesh past and see most of them billy graham's message thank god for it but it only got to repentance here it never got down to the desire of the soul it never got down to the where the person says all i want is christ amen i don't want anything with the world all i want is christ he never got he never got done he never got down to that realm and he gives his examples he gives us all his supposed reasons but he never mentions this never mentions how man has three parts and how you have to be sanctified and then fill with the holy ghost and so see then they can never live the kind of life that god has called us to live the church don't get me wrong god's calling everybody in every church to live the way we're supposed to live but we can see it because we've accepted it in ephesians two verse two i'm gonna read a few scriptures here as i close in church this is where the revelation i believe i believe this is fresh revelation in the last few years about the soul thirst when i listen to that last year i believe this is fresh revelation because i've never understood this before but everybody starts with that holy soul thirst and then your mind your conscious your active conscience here it either satisfies that thirst of the soul or it satisfies the thirst of the flesh right bigger barns bigger bars more money or it says forget that more of god amen more of the word amen hallelujah more of jesus amen do one or the other ephesians 2 verse 1 and you hath thee quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins where in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince and power of the air now look at this the spirit that worketh in the children of disobedience where does that spirit work inside them in their human minds remember there the bible already says sin dwelleth in your members your flesh already wants to go right along with with the devil right it's all ready you don't even you don't got to prime it right you don't got to prime up your flesh already wants to do it unless you just got off like a fresh anointing or something like that you wake up in the morning most of the time your flesh will go right along with the world and so see paul saying when you were dead in sins you had a spirit of disobedience in you in other words the antichrist spirit the spirit of iniquity obeying the desires of the flesh in verse three among whom also we all had look all church all of us were sinners all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh see there's that fleshly thirst right oh now this message is perfect when you get to the revelation of it like the man said you got a human side and you got an inspired side and you have to rightly divide the word of truth see somebody that just says oh everything on the tape they don't know they don't know if 1977 annihilated the world or not they don't know because it says that it's going to they don't know if the white horse riders the antichrist or the holy spirit they don't know they can't say because it's all inspired but we know because god has made it known to us because we desire to know because the mysteries of god are given to you amen blessed are your eyes blessed are your ears for they here is my promise brother rams promise joseph billy paul or is it joseph because he said it's billy paul in 1951. oh thank god for the holy spirit the lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind see you have desires in your mind oh i'd like to think about that barn oh i want to think about that ah that new car whatever it is and we're by nature see the children of wrath even as others let's stand verse four but god who's rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved bride of christ fellowship even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace ye are saved and has raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus so that what can happen verse seven so that in all the ages to come what is he gonna do he's gonna show the exceeding riches of his grace and his kindness i wonder what that first age will be like in the new jerusalem what if they'll call it the ephesian age i don't know what they're going to call it with that first age he's going to show us how kind he was to us he's going to show us the grace but amen i wonder if he'll take the first age for the old testament saints and just show all the grace that he gave them with adam and eve how you forgave them how when they're walking out the garden god looks back and said but but don't forget i'm gonna bring you back praise god i might be driving you out now but pretty soon i'm gonna bring you back and all the saints will cried weep and praise the lord all because of his grace and his kindness instead of letting the spirit of disobedience work in our minds instead of letting letting that that iniquity spear that antichrist spirit fill our minds instead of that we've cast that down and we've set our affections on things above and now we're not dead we're risen from the dead in christ jesus thank the lord let's have a word of prayer i want to be there at that first age don't you church i want to be there at the new jerusalem how many ages could eternity have i especially want to be there in the age where he goes through the laodicean bride because that'll be the age where i got to see how i overcame so show me again how he protected me from the car accident yesterday he'll show me again we'll see brother jesse here's where i had the angels at their post of duty here's where i had you just gently pat that break instead of slamming on the break and causing back whiplash on your children or having the car behind you smashing to you and people destroyed and died oh that's where i had my angels posted at their posted [Music] are right there by your dad possibly he's not making any noise for two weeks he's not talking then you go in there brother hey maybe you had that prayer cloth there i don't know where he had it a couple days later you stand up for life you speak the word for life a few days later angels kind of push them wake up wake up it's time to go home his kindness he could have took your dad right but he showed his kindness and his grace to us i'll tell you i'm looking forward to eternity [Music] age after age after age we can see the goodness of god [Music] let's pray together [Music] i'm going to say lord perfect me by the word of god let's pray again heavenly father we want to be perfected we know it comes through keeping every word and we know [Music] as we're looking at it in our minds to fulfill the desires of the soul that hold it first please god let us not let the spirit of disobedience work in our minds to fulfill the lusts of the flesh [Music] to obey the holy spirit and grow in godliness [Music] and discern that antichrist spirit [Music] let's develop godly habits godly thought life dear lord lord if there's anybody i can help lord in this church please let me know god give me a vision give me the serpent if anybody needs anything oh god i want to help i pray the same for them i'm sure all the genuine saints are going to help out other people [Music] father of none of us we will gather in that first age they will rejoice [Music] that you've given for every generation with your great love [Music] thank you for your mercy lord bless your people in jesus christ [Music] my [Music] [Applause] is [Music] but until then [Music] [Applause] [Music] my [Music] aren't you glad for his great love he's rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Applause] is [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
