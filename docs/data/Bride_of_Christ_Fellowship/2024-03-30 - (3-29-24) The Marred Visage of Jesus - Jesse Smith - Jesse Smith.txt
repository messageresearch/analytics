thankful for the Honey in the Rock Hallelujah every time I keep going to get some honey I keep finding it praise God every time I need a blessing God's always got one Hallelujah so I'd like to just preach a little message on the marred Visage of Jesus tonight as I said on Wednesday uh by God's grace looks like the live stream's working tonight so God bless the live stre streamers sorry it kind of went the last few services but for some reason it just started working tonight so thank God for that the marred Visage of Jesus of course we're looking at the cross and Calvary tonight being that it's good Friday I put out a video today with just a lot of good quotes from Brother brandom about how we was constantly trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ I don't know about you but that just makes the cross seem re like brand new to me when brother bram's like I've got to trust in Jesus Christ I he said uh he said I have no merits on my own the he said I cannot get into heaven on my merits only on the merits of Jesus Christ it's so refreshing so refreshing to hear that a man that never built a a mega church you know just a man who was humble and served God it's and yet with all these tremendous Miracles and Revelations and the Seven Seals and the mysteries of God yet he would say uh he would tell us uh don't look at me he said put all this grace on Jesus Christ that's our real servant of God right there Hallelujah so let's go to Isaiah 52 uh verse 13 by God's grace again we appreciate everybody's prayers and everybody's dedication to the house of the Lord you know these last few weeks here and of course the whole time but uh appreciate everybody's dedication and sacrifice Hallelujah uh Wednesday you know I preached on that little thought about the sun shall be darkened and I looked at you know eclipses in the Bible uh if you didn't hear that let me know if you'd like to hear that by God's grace me personally I don't see any connection with April 8th to anything significant to the Gentiles I mean we in one way we can say every eclipse is some type of a sign right I mean everything in the heavens is a sign but as far as like scripture and prophecy is an eclipse and there's four every year right around the world at least four sometimes there's seven uh is every uh Eclipse you know some type of sign will maybe but as far as for the Rapture you know we don't I don't personally see that in the scripture of course I'm open to correction by God's Grace but what I feel like is it's a lot of a fear-mongering on YouTube or you name it Instagram or whatever it is X you know a lot of people get all sred up and then after it happens well what happens to those people they just keep going on telling lies and trying to get bait clips and whatever they call it uh but at some point it's going to it's going to be real at some point but that's in the tribulation period that's what I showed you I think I think seven or eight scripture was even after I think I went off the live stream I went and I just typed in while we're singing like sun and dark and I found four or five more and it's all speaks of the time when uh Jesus Christ comes back speaks of the tribulation period of course speaks of Armageddon by God's grace but sorry to go so long Isaiah 5213 you I'm really looking forward you know to Brother Brian coming for all of you and I'm looking forward to going to brother cams I'm going to share some of our testimonies you know uh that God's done this last year because I don't think I've been to brother cam since last April if I'm not mistaken it's been a whole year it's hard to believe right um so I'm going to you I write down all of our testimonies I'm going to share a lot of those with the Saints try to encourage them by God's grace Hallelujah I know I I love hearing like brother diggs's testimonies he was telling me more when we drove up to the airport and all those were from one Church in London all those testimonies were in one church so that church has a lot of uh faith for Supernatural uh obviously they're gifted right you know no man can add one cubit to a stature you know uh they have these gifts of faith and uh these expressions of faith and so he he said uh it was just a real blessing to hear all those testimonies there by God's grace Isaiah 52 13 14 15 I'll read 15 um and I'm sorry I'll read 13 and 15 we'll just we'll read 14 together okay so it'll be me all of us and then me just to save us we can kind of keep our voices together verse 13 behold my servant shall deal prudently he shall be exalted and extolled and be very high of course this does not come without a price if you want God to honor you there's always a price to pay yes huge Price to Pay Brother Ram said don't never wish you were a prophet because of all the suffering that goes along with it right blessings but also make a mistake there's great punishment especially for preachers now let's read verse 14 1 2 3 as many were astonied at thee his Visage was so Mar more more than any man and his form more than the sons of men Now read 15 so shall he sprinkle many nations the Kings shall shut their mouths at him for that which had not been told them shall they see and that which they had not heard shall they consider of course that's speaking of the Gentiles right many nations thank God for the cross Hallelujah remember the cross knocked down the wall there's a great wall between Jew and Gentile the cross of Jesus Christ Christ knocked it down Hallelujah so now we get the blessings amen let's have one more word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord just speak to the people's hearts Lord God we're so encourag from our evangelist brother brother Diggs raising our faith telling us to go look in our go look in our contract Hallelujah and quote the contract make sure the contract's being followed hallelujah thank God for the Bible contract Hallelujah Lord thank you for Spiritual placement as he preach to us and Lord we stand on the word tonight as we look to the word of God strengthen our hearts Lord God and just draw us closer to you we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and everybody say amen God bless you as you being seated praise God so I want to look at this thought here of uh the marred Visage of Christ I'm going to try to watch the time here just because got to preach the next two days as well after today never stops me anyway but I I try to think of it might help by God's grace um we read our text here and we see that just these words I was reading uh or I was I can't remember if I was reading at home I think I was reading at home or somebody preached it and they mentioned this that his face was so marred it didn't even look like a man and you know so this week I was going online looking at face transplants you know that they could never transplant a face until 2005 so for 6,000 years of human history if someone had an awful accident with their face they they were just left with this this image that doesn't it didn't look like a human uh but then starting in 2005 they've been able to do facial transplants and now they got it pretty good I mean it can look really good where you know you can tell maybe it's something's a little different but uh the face looks very normal but before that you know and when I and I I was just shocked by and I thought about showing them tonight but with the kids I thought I better not do that you know I want to have a little bit of wisdom by God's grace but I just loved you know I just love looking at the before and after and I couldn't help but think of Jesus how as he's dying on the cross you would not have been able to know that was a man if you just looked at him because of his face and his form that's what the Bible says here his Visage was so marred more than any man and his form more than the sons of men everybody want you know every what I mean is everybody all humans they want the glory and the uh the rewards of verse 13 right where God will God will exalt you in due season right we all like to know that God's going to exalt you new season but we often forget about the suffering that must come with that Hallelujah and uh no one is exalted as high as Jesus hallelujah praise God Amen no one will ever be exalted he's the only way they can describe it is very high there's no other words to describe how high Jesus will be exalted amen but he he's worthy of that praise God he's worthy because he took the the most uh most awful punishment that could ever be taken you you think about some of the Saints you know the Bible says they were saw aunder remember in Hebrews 11 cut in half cut in cut in pieces and I hate to be this descriptive that wasn't in my notes you know but I'm just thinking you know whatever Jesus endured was far worse than any person's ever endured now remember Paul was whipped five times Jesus once but that it seems like Paul would just be whipped and then let go but Jesus was compounded everything was compounded for that whole morning of abuse you know leading up to the ninth hour when he finally gave up the ghost uh after three hours of suffering there on the cross with the the sun had turned off its light think of that think about that God was God turned off all the light showing I'm putting all this Blackness on my son I'm putting all bride of Christ fellowships on sins on my son the sins of the whole world and God said I'm turning off the light to show this is what sin looks like sin sin is so dark sin is so black and then the one that is going on you can't even tell that's a human being God was going to prove to us all what sin was but also what love was amen hallelujah praise God he showed us what real Sin looked like and then he showed us what love look like hallelujah we're thankful for the love of Jesus Christ amen I can't preach one of these services without showing the three things brother brandom said Calvary means to US every year you're going to hear me say that I think I started that in 2017 well just just going to keep continuing as long as God terries it settled the sin question amen Satan's power was broken amen and we in return now we do the works of Christ amen hallelujah and were even given power to impart eternal life I remember when brother Simon prayed for brother amen and he got the Holy Ghost you know he felt that warm hand on his back you know that that God by his grace allows us to impart eternal life to others hallelujah praise God what a privilege amen amen may God help us to live so close to God that eternal life can be imparted hallelujah amen to those that are hungering for eternal life hallelujah oh and I forgot that's right brother Simon's going to be ordained Sunday as a minister he's never been ordained all these years and so cam asked me what I thought and I was like oh of course you know look at the fruit you know right here right here is the fruit of brother Simon's Ministry and me you know he and my life my my testimony so uh I forgot to let you know about that Saint so I'm sorry about that hopefully cam told him if not and Hope hopefully Simon doesn't listen to the sermon he's going to get a happy happy surprise but um you know we're just thankful for you know uh God using each person's gift praise God whatever God's called you to be do it with all your heart praise God the Bible said do it with everything that you got Hallelujah but we're thankful for these three works of of Calvary Hallelujah I like how brother bam kind of just summarized it in those three settles the same question Satan's power is broken over our lives and then we do the works of Christ amen now what is Jesus's blood done this is again a little bit of review I there's this little section in this book I have where it talks about the Feast of Israel and it goes through all that the blood of Jesus Christ did so the day of atonement was the one day of the year in September usually when Israel uh would would sacrifice the Two Goats you know had the escape goat and the Goat that died and all the sins of the whole year would be forgiven in one day think about that everything all the sins of the whole year would be just done away within one day and the nation from that from that day they could rejoice and then they break into the next Feast the Feast of Tabernacles the Millennium amen hallelujah praise God that's what it does right Jesus's blood forgives us and we feel like we entered into a place of rest amen the soul has rested Hallelujah the soul is resting that's what brother Ram said the whole Christian walk he said is resting on the Promises of God Amen in the soul praise God of course we'll battle in our minds every day seem like the battle never stops right but if we can overcome the Mind battles we can rest in our soul Hallelujah and we can have the peace of God that passes all understanding amen like I was listening to brother Dennis's sermon from uh Napoleon last week or I'm sorry today I was listening to it from a few weeks ago and he used that scripture God promises if we keep him in mind he'll keep us in perfect peace amen what a promise I mean we we have the ability to walk in total peace every day as long as we keep our hearts on Jesus amen amen how important it is to keep our minds on the Lord hallelujah that we can walk in the peace of God of course it's not easy it is called the greatest battle ever fault because Satan knows how to how to uh he knows how to battle us he studies us his demons study us right all throughout the day he's like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour and he makes his attractions more attractive all the time right to try to trick us but we got to stand with the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah we got to stand by the Holy Spirit and cast out anything that exalts itself against the word of God hallelujah amen I just reminded of this power the blood of Jesus Christ it lists about 13 things and I'm just going to go through them quickly the blood of Jesus Christ justifies you it declares you righteous we have communion through the blood of Jesus Christ that means you can talk to God because of the blood we have Redemption which is buying you back from a market I looked it up yester or today buying you back from from a slave market you are purchased out of the slave market amen I'm no longer a slave anymore Hallelujah I'm a Child of God Amen you can say I'm not in the slave market anymore with those other slaves I'm a slave to Christ now amen I'm a prisoner so sometimes this is very helpful to remember remember the Bible said both Paul and Peter said stir up their pure Minds by way of remance amen amen also Ephesians 2:13 says you have access to the presence of God through the blood amen we can know today when we pray we've confessed all our sins we can know for sure that we can go right to the holiest of holies and God hears our prayers next we have reconciliation through the blood Colossians 1:14 and Colossians 1:20 reconciliation so that means two parties that were uh out of Fellowship are now back in Fellowship Hallelujah in other words we're not fighting against God hallelujah we have communion with God we're not in a spot where we don't hear from God we always hear from God Amen we constantly hear from God hallelujah he's telling us how to walk he's telling us how to live Hallelujah he's speaking his love secrets to us hallelujah amen amen next we have remission or pardon through the blood of Jesus Christ Hebrews 9:22 the remission of sins he sends your sins away Hallelujah your sins don't lie at your door like they did Cain right hallelujah praise God the sins are not at your door the sins are in the sea of God's forgetfulness praise God GL how many was it seven miles under the sea seven miles under the water Amen to the very lowest of the lowest spot that's where God places your sins and the devil can't bring them up hallelujah amen brother ra said for the devil to bring him up he'd have to get buried and and baptized in the blood of Christ the same Hallelujah and we know he won't do that praise God Amen cuz remember the Bible said he that overcomes he takes his garments to the Fountain and he has Jesus wash his garments in the fountain Hallelujah that's what Revelation says hallelujah how do these people overcome how they come over out of tribulation how they come out of their persecutions they took their garments of Jesus and wash them Jesus make me clean this will get me through the trials if I just got clean garments Hallelujah I can make it through life if I've known you've forgiven me hallelujah amen that's what makes us the Overcomer Hallelujah that we know where to go to get our laundry done amen our Dirty Laundry we know where to take it to that's right sweet King Jesus Hallelujah we give him our dirty garments he gives them back clean as white Hallelujah white as snow hallelujah amen we have a covenant by the blood that means a an oath God remember brother brother di said immutable God cannot lie that's right the blood of Jesus Christ puts you into a covenant God in other words God makes promise proes to you I'm talking about Good promises amen we saw some of those good promises amen hallelujah and whatever God reveals to you believe it with all your heart praise God Amen uh the next one is we're Sanctified by the blood that means purified Hallelujah God purifies us through the blood Hallelujah which means the Holy Spirit Hallelujah through the sacrifice of so us remembering the sacrifice of Jesus Christ his life comes upon us and it purifies Our Lives see church when we look at the cross of Jesus Christ we can't continue sinning that's right we're not workers of iniquity that's right the cross does something to us amen right when we look at Jesus when we look at the blood when we look at the sacrifice when we look at the scripture uh brother says how could you not love him back how could you deny such mattress love brother R says amen Hallelujah if he died to redeem me from the these why would I build this again Paul says in in Galatians I made a transgress if I build again the things that I've already destroyed Amen in other words remember uh you've got victories but you're going to have to keep fighting to keep those victories hallelujah amen amen the Bible said your conscience is purged by the blood so sometimes we walk around with a guilty conscience well you did this and you're no good and how can you say you're born again how can you say you're bride how can you say that but the Bible says the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses that conscience amen hallelujah praise God I'll say like this if anybody's going to make it it's going to be us hallelujah amen by God's grace because we love the word of God because we honor God's word hallelujah just the simple commands of God hallelujah amen most people don't even read their Bibles that go to church I'm talking about I go to church it's going to be by the blood and so we constantly our minds cleanse by the blood of Jesus Christ amen we have cleansing through the blood daily cleansing 1 John 1:7 if we confess our sins we walk in the light and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all unrighteousness amen that means the the spirit of God through the blood of Christ is each day going to cleanse our minds you know Paul said I Die daily not weekly I thought about that today he just didn't confess his sins and die to himself every Sunday it was daily every day in other words every day he knew that sin nature would resurrect he's got to kill it again he's got to crucify it again take up his cross daily and follow Jesus amen amen cleansing every day he had to be cleansed by the blood Hallelujah and then the Bible gives these amazing words we can enter into the holiest through the blood of Jesus Christ and Hebrews 104 and Hebrews 1019 and 20 we act this goes along with the access scripture we have access in the holiest place in heaven through the blood Amen in other words you can get wherever you want by the blood hallelujah amen hallelujah just I mean what better place would you want to get to talk about you know I got to have have to have my badge to get into my school we've got we have something very similar to get into God's headquarters amen we've got the badge of the blood hallelujah amen we got to pass right to the throne of God Amen and make our request known unto God hallelujah amen the Bible gives us that Assurance entrance within the veil by the blood we get admission to Heaven because the blood is there Hebrews 9: 7 through 25 admission to Heaven hallelujah we're going to make it to Heaven by God's grace amen amen there's a seat at that table for me amen there's a seat at the table of the marriage supper for you amen am there's a seat at the marriage supper for each one of us by God's grace just have no excuses just uh just destroy all your excuses that's what the parable said this man made excuse I got lands I got a wife I got homes I got all these things they made all the excuses not to come to the wedding supper just destroy rip up all your excuses and there will be a seat for you at the marriage supper of the Lamb hallelujah amen amen just get rid of all your excuses amen I can have the kind of life I want I can serve Jesus the way I want to I can overcome I can be the kind of Christian I've always wanted to be hallelujah amen all our excuses can be wiped away hallelujah amen it's not Perfection as far as why never sin it's recognizing the perfect sacrifice each day Hallelujah that's the that's the beauty of the believer if Enoch could be raptured under the blood of bulls and gats will be raptured by the blood of Jesus Christ amen CU we're walking after the Holy Spirit praise God we're walking with God Amen how me walk with God how me talk with God this week in your home see you're walk you don't have to raise your hand but you're walking with God Amen am right you weren't talking to me amen wasn't like oh I'd like to talk to brother Jesse he said got Jesus right right brother awesome you got Jesus amen now you can text me I'll text you back you know you got a question I'll text you back but your walk is with Christ the Risen Savior amen the Risen one Hallelujah the king of kings and Lord of lords we have a mission into heaven because of Christ Hallelujah we also have a propit by the blood I love that word it's the wratht taker we have someone who's taken our wrath through the blood in other words God's not up there and say I'm so mad brother amen and I've got some wrath sort up for sister Zur and and and sister uh beatric and you put brother Jesse he's not up there saying I've got wrath he said I've got Mercy for them they're my children hallelujah amen I let them into the Throne of the throne room of God I accept their prayers I hear their prayers and when we give uh alms fast and pray God's God's angels build memorials in heaven to us amen amen or for us they build they the Angels build memorials for us in memory of us just like Cornelius that encourages me praise God Amen I might have the smallest Memorial but there's a memorial memorial up there with my name on it praise God Amen my prayers my little fastings my little arms whatever it is I've got some Memorial up there in heaven praise God hallelujah and we have a pritu through the blood Jesus became the wratht taker he took God's Wrath against us and put it on Christ and then we are Overcomers by the blood of the lamb and the word of Our Testimony that's actually speaking to to the 144,000 in context but what if we look there then at Revelation 2 and 3 we see the Gentile Church were to overcome as well right Hallelujah and so we see it's the same idea the 144,000 are going to get the Holy Ghost too they're going to get the sealed of the Holy Ghost they're going to a nation's going to be born in one day amen let me just drop this in here my wife and I were talking about Israel you know not all Israel is Israel so even in the war with Israel and go and Hamas we've heard that Israel has done some things that maybe weren't right on purpose well that's because not all of them are saved right not all of them are blinded right so we got to keep that in mind and there's only going to be 1% last time I looked up their population 144,000 was like 1% of the population only 1% of that population is going to be justified and Sanctified and ready to be born again that's a very small number that means 99 are not that's a big portion kind of like akan right we we got less than 1% here we got less than less than one tenth of 1% but there's going to be a small Remnant praise God you have to remember that but each one will overcome Satan by the blood of the Lamb see Satan does not like the blood because the blood speaks of a sacrifice that's covered all his accusations remember it's it's a battle of Rights each one of us are a house Jesus tells us in Matthew 12 right and if we open up our our our minds to evil spirits Satan can come and build a complex or a castle in our houses he's got a right there and the only way to get him out is to say I don't want this anymore forgive me Jesus let your spirit come in and clean me out amen which is basically saying I'm letting the blood in praise God Satan no longer has a right here Jesus died to set me free Jesus died to pay for that sin and forgive me Hallelujah and take that away and then fill my house with good things Hallelujah amen filled with love and joy and peace and longsuffering and gentleness and self-control Hallelujah all the fruits of the Holy Spirit he wants to fill our houses with all the good things of God Amen so that's a little review there now let's get to this back to this marred Visage here by God's grace I just can't help that I just every year I think of Good Friday what a glorious day it is hallelujah now John Gil he was a preacher in the 1800s a faithful man of God brother man mentioned him in the church age book he said the greatest preaching and writing came from uh the Philadelphian Church age John Gil said his Visions V I can never say that word his Visage was so marred more than any man and his form more than the sons of men though fairer than the children of men as he was the immediate workmanship of the Divine spirit so he must have been a beautiful baby right but then we know as he got older the the Pharisees said you not even 50 so he looked older and the and the and the Bible say a Man of Sorrows right so all the effects of casting out all the evil spirits the labor of getting up you know all H having prayer services and getting up early to go pray all that had taken an impact on him and the Bible said he had no beauty that we would desire him so he was low on sleep physically tired at times fasting often to cast out Devils you know he he didn't look like a but he was born beautiful he would have been because he was he was a Son of God so that's what that's the point John Gil's making he said but his griefs and Sorrows he bore and the troubles he was met with with the watchings and the fastings with laborous preaching constant traveling about to do good with what sweat and blood with buffetings and scourgings never was any man's face more marred or his form more altered than his was now you've heard it too with the cross your shoulders go out of joint and so his shoulders look really really gross right and then he was stripped naked whipped down you know we'll get to these scriptures in just a moment he was beautiful at Birth but as the effects of the ministry so he was look he was probably looking really good till about 30 you know then he started his ministry around 30 that's when all the suffering happened now look at Psalm 226 there okay if you would Psalm 22:6 again I was going to put a picture up here of this but I thought well it might be too tough on the children look what the scripture says David was writing by the Holy Spirit and he said but I am a worm and no man now picture of earthworm and as I was studying this I was listening to this I was walking in school and it was raining the other day and there was worms all around me I thought well that's another sign maybe I'm supposed to preach this Jesus Jesus inspired David to sayi am a worm I'm not even a man a reproach of men and despise of the people even his own Shepherd I'm sorry even his own sheep scattered from him the shepherd now in the Hebrew this word worm it means maggot or grub or worm now we got chickens and they dig up the grubs right they're they're pretty good at it that's what they're made to do but Jesus was made to Humble himself where when he was at the cross before he said it was finished he looked not even like a man more like a worm now I looked at some microscopic pictures of worm faces probably don't want to see them the kids they got some really strange faces but Jesus you imagine so you know I could have put some pictures up here imagine no the nose wasn't there you know these the distinct ly human elements of Christ were not noticeable his body was mangled and twisted you know uh bones out of joint or I'm sorry yeah bones out of joint no doubt about it now none none of the bones were broken but this is the this is the closest thing the Holy Spirit would give us to try to picture Calvary so now when after we've seen Mel Gibson's movie that that's not even that's not even a tenth of what Jesus would have looked like because you could still you could still tell he was a man right how many you seen that I've seen that and you know he still looks kind of like a man you know they're swelling and everything but it was so awful the Bible said his Visage was marred more than any other man so they took extra time when they're beating him they took extra time to hit his face on purpose right because face is the most important part of a person right it's just like it's like speaking against God right they they speak they BL asking God's name it's like uh rejecting him and saying it right to his face right the most one of the most disrespectful things in the Bible was spitting in someone's face remember they had laws about that if certain people dis disrespected others they could actually spit in their faces it's one of the worst things uh you could possibly do to disrespect somebody because face represents the presence of that person and so Jesus became as a worm like a worm more like a worm than a man scoffield said this uh CI scoffield the literal rendering is terrible so marred from the form of man was his aspect that his appearance was not that of a son of man not human the effect of the brutalities described in the gospels so these Roman soldiers were so brutal with him he didn't even look like a man it didn't look like a son of a man or son a man a human being that's how awful it was now remember Church Jesus knew the whole time he was going to this he tried to tell the disciples I've got to go to Jerusalem and I've got to be crucified and they're like oh you're not going to die Jesus he said get behind me Satan he wasn't playing around he wasn't laughing he's like I know what I've got to suffer I know the scripture I am the scripture he knew this he knew he'd have to suffer he wasn't oblivious to this that's why he begged God take this cup from me if it's possible sometimes church we want God to take all of our trials away it might be forming us into what he wants us to be as we heard on last weekend right it's uh it's the scripture you know I I never thought about these scriptures but as I was I heard that I just started thinking my that's right that's right that that that that all these things he didn't even look like a man now if you got your Bible Well case you can put up there Isa Isaiah 50:6 uh Isaiah 50:6 notice I gave my back to the smiters he didn't hide his back he didn't try to run from it he gave himself up for it he he accepted it willingly why for you and I amen praise God he didn't run from the Abus abuse he gave himself to the abuse so that we could be free from abuse praise God and I gave my my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair so remember Ezra did that Ezra Nehemiah they were pulling out beards but Jesus let himself totally just let the people pull out the hair I hid not my face from shame and spitting how many of those soldiers just spit right in his face the the Pharisees right the at the Sanhedrin Council he just gave himself and he knew what he was doing he was taking a upon himself Church the sins of the whole world Hallelujah Isaiah 532 would go 2 three 4 and five let's remember Calvary Hallelujah let's remember Jesus's death till he comes for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he ha no form nor kindliness and when we shall see him there's no beauty that we would desire I'm just speaking of the res the crucifixion right because he would have been a beautiful baby verse three he's despised and rejected a man a man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not verse five or four sorry surely a bore our griefs amen hallelujah amen and carried our sorrows remember uh three years ago I preached on God's receipt remember that I'm G to preach that at cams I think by God's I'm going to pass out those receipts we got we got the devil's receipts Hallelujah that means mental Sorrows jesus carried all your mental Sorrows he already bore for you so you don't have to so I was thinking about how can I apply that and I said well the only reason only time receipts come in handy for me is when I'm walking out of Walmart or walking out of somewhere and like oh that happens at Aldi too sometimes right and that's what it is like when we're serving God God gives us these blessings let's say we got our joy back right and we got the receipt from the sermon right and we're walking out his church and all of a sudden we get in the car and the devil uh no you got to give me that back nothing's going to change and church we can either say okay take my joy back or we can say look it's mine it's bought and paid for I've got the receipt hallelujah amen what's he gonna say what's all he gonna say they're gonna say just go on all right I'm walking off with all my goods amen they can't stop me cuz I got The Possession glory and I got the receipt hallelujah it's been paid for amen bought and paid for with the precious blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen I got the receipt to show for it praise God hallelujah Psalm 22:15 and then we'll go to verse 17 Psalm 22:15 I guess I could my strength is dried up like a pot shur so piece of clay a dry piece of clay and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws now get your jaws his tongue was sticking to his jaw on the side of his mouth and thou has brought me into the dust of death so remember they they they didn't give him drink that whole time they waited till the end to give him the vinegar he said I thirst well no kidney thirsted he'd been beaten and bloodied and bruised and spit on and slapped and hair ripped out and his tongue was sticking to the side of his mouth and we think we get thirsty sometimes see this is what our Lord suffered thank God he suffered it hallelujah thank God that he did it for you and I verse 17 if you could go to 17 I may tell all my bones they look and they stare upon me and even brother brandham says it I got the quote down here later brother Bram says this maybe I can find it real quick yes he says finally beaten with a big lash till his ribs were showing through his skin and the little robe he had on his back they took it off they beat him to a post what was it that was a true Royal Seed of Abraham so his ribs were actually now the passion did a good job on that his he could look down and he could see his ribs and no doubt uh maybe some other bones his bones were staring at him his tongue is cleaving to his jaw he doesn't even look like a man looks like some form word this is what Christ endured because of his joy that was set before him praise God amen hallelujah hallelujah amen Psalm 102:3 Psalm 102: 345 for my days are consumed like smoke and my bones are burned as in hear verse four my heart is smitten and withered like grass so I forget to eat my bread verse five by reason the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin this was just an an awful condition where the bones are being exposed right he's been beaten all over his back but no doubt they would have missed a couple times like they showed in the movie and they would have got all this open and exposed and that's what the Lord suffered for you and I hallelujah thank you Jesus remember he said because of all that you are healed praise God because he suffered you're well amen praise God because he was ripped open you are mended amen hallelujah you're healed because he was he took all the punishment right he took all the all the pain all the punishment all the all the curse he took the curse that the blessing could be poured out upon us praise God Amen that's a God I'll serve hallelujah praise God Amen so we see Jesus in this great sacrifice that he gave Hallelujah I want to read what brother Ram said in blind Bard andus he's talking about Jesus on the day he was crucified on his mind he knew that he was going to Calvary up that road on that road he knowed he was going to Gethsemane he was going to pil judgment Hall he was to be beat and mocked and then his great gifts of God was to be put at trial so he knew he was going to a court trial going to put a rag around his head and smack him on the head and say now if you know all that's in the people's hearts and minds tell me you hit you and all these things faced him he knew that was going to happen brother R said a quivering bittering death there he had to face a quivering bittering death he knew also hanging in his mind here that he was going up to have his hands placed around a pole his clothes stripped off him and lashes that would burn Plum into the bone was going around him and his blood would bathe his sides and a cruel thorn crown would be placed on his head and he'd be nailed to a cross and hang there bleeding bleeding dying as the most bloody sacrifice was ever offered in the world and remember uh David wrote about this a thousand years before the or 1500 years before the Romans even invented crucifixion it was I mean prophecy again proves that God is real praise God and all of that confronting him and he's walking I can see him in his air of quietness because he's thinking about it brother say he's quiet as he walked straight and the disciples going on putting the people off the road so remember let's just recall that he was the bloodiest sacrifice he had to been a burnt offering out of the out of the five old testment offerings he had to been the Burt one because he gave his entire being away to God H Allelujah he gave everything he poured out everything absolutely everything was given to God as a sacrifice for us then brother Ram says this and uh and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies brother R talks about him being accused in the courtyard he said the only thing they found against him was breaking the Sabbath day but he said I'm the lord of the Sabbath and he was and he they said he's making himself God but he was God Amen Hallelujah and there are all those false accusing and things and false Witnesses they had against him finally beaten with a big lash till his ribs was showing through and the little robe he had on his back they took it off beat him to a post what was it that was the true Royal seat of Abraham that's where we stand tonight my faith is built on nothing less than Jesus blood and righteousness when all around my soul gives way then he is All My Hope and stay amen when I lose all hope or I get discouraged I've got one place to go there's only one place I need to go that's the calvary praise God on Christ the solid rock I stand all other grounds is sinking sand that's where I take my hope right there on that Solid Rock What's My Hope For The Rapture the cross amen how do I believe I'm going to go in the rapture because I've been to Calvary amen amen I appreciate what he did at Calvary and that is impacting my life right now praise God Amen as the Bible said in Romans I church we are walking in the newness of life because of the cross of Jesus Christ Hallelujah the see the cross doesn't impact these mega churches I'm talking about like denominational mega churches it doesn't impact them their lives don't change very much just to a religious form but the soul the Nature has not changed Hallelujah but our nature is changed Hallelujah we don't have an unbelief nature well the Bible says a woman shouldn't cut her hair well that's just for the that was just for the old days we've got a nature of we believe the word hallelujah just one simple example there's 110 examples I came up with I asked Cam and Simon can you get me a more list there I like I like a bigger list one of these days I'll do that by God's grace now I love this brother R breaks into this thought of Jesus he was Abraham seed he possessed every gate even to death and hell I want you to see what he says here see him there had a mockery now he doesn't say the word but a mockery gate that woman trying to wash his feet again put a rag over his face and said if you're a prophet tell us who hit you and we'll believe you and on the cross they said if you're the Son of God come down and we we'll believe you they wouldn't believe him anyhow no matter what he done he didn't mind them so brother Braham says here Jesus had the possessed the Gate of mockery and sometimes we get really sad when we get mocked well I do online they put me in a new video this week I was actually the front and cover one this week I'm like hey I made it to the cover they didn't say much about me but well praise God that's a good sign I ought to leap and dance tonight but brother R said Jesus had to conquer the Gate of death hell but also mockery and we've got to and what the Bible says because we're Abraham's seed we can possess those same Gates Hallelujah the Gate of sickness the Gate of being persecuted or lied on right we can possess every gate because it's already been conquered hallelujah amen he's already conquered it for us we've just got to take the word of God and possess every footstep footsteps our possession and go claim that gate and possess that gate Hallelujah amen amen so what do he have to do to do that he had to love the mockers he had to ignore them and not curse them right that's how he overcame the Gate of being mocked that's right I love this quote I preached this a while ago but I'm going to read it again the infallible word of God 1956 brother Bram said Jesus had finished it everything was completed Jesus would have not sat down in heaven if it had not have the completed the work no no man sits down until his job is over that's right he said and Jesus took his blood and went through the heavens of heaven and condemned every devil took the keys of death and hell and then he sat down in heaven amen I love this quote praise God hallelujah brother Ram said on his way down remember today he would already been crucified because it's already 7 it's almost 8:00 he died he would have died at the 9th hour so that would have been 3:00 he would have died 300 p.m. but here he would have after he died he dismissed his Spirit at some point after that the Bible said his Spirit went down and it preached to souls that were in prison but brother Ram said as he went down he condemned every devil on the way down so I can see Jesus remember I have this list of evil spirits I did when I preached the doctrines of devils I had a list of evil spirits Jesus condemned the devil of divination the famili The Familiar lying Spirit he condemned that devil he condemned jealousy he condemned lying because he always told the truth amen hallelujah he condemned that perverse spirit because he always did what was right he always walked upright praise God that's why I believe a lot of these false doctrines are there perverse demon Spirits perverting the right way and going the false way he condemned now this one we got to watch out too he condemned that hoty Spirit of Pride that's one I think it impacts us most in America I mean me too right he condemned that because he was always humble praise God he possessed the gates of his enemies hallelujah praise God there's no prideful devil that say well I got I cause you to sin I cause you to sin no he said I overcame and I've got I've got blood fresh up there on the on the cross Hallelujah and I paid the price for this and I'm coming down to get the keys of death and Hell Hallelujah and nobody can stop me amen because I possess I'm possessing every gate none of you could cause me to fall none of you have the right to stop me I can do whatever I please because I'm the Virgin born son of God hallelujah amen didn't have the sin nature Hallelujah just had a body likened under sin the Bible says because it could die it could get tired as we said it could be beaten but he never sinned he never had the sin nature he condemned the spirit of heaviness like depression that's what depression is he condemned that Spirit Hallelujah he condemned the spirit of whoredoms right lust of the eyes lust of the flesh he condemned that and he never had evil thoughts he never went to a evil club or anything like that or any Evil movies right or anything like that he condemned that he was pure Hallelujah he condemned the spirit of infirm ity the deaf and dumb Spirit he condemned the spirit of fear he condemned the seducing Spirit he condemned the spirit of air he condemned the Spirit of Slumber spiritual blindness he condemned every unclean and foul Spirit he condemned the spirit of bondage he condemned the spirit of the world and he condemned the spirit of the Antichrist amen that's a mighty conqueror church amen hallelujah and he rose and he gave you the right to conquer those Gates as well praise God you have the right to say because of Jesus Christ because of the blood of Jesus Christ I have the right to be free I have the right to possess this gate to conquer this battle and I can overcome I can get past this I can overcome this because Jesus gave me the power to do it hallelujah amen glory that's what I'm going tell too you know brother uh McBride servant helped me out so much I'm still enjoying the victory praise God from that sermon on secret sins and then I preached on it and God showed me how there's two kinds of secret sins it's such a tremendous blessing praise God what can we do church we can possess the gates how many glad they can possess the gates amen you you don't have to you don't have to say well I can't take any more ground I can't be a better Christian no you can possess those Gates you can be like Jaz Saints and you can possess more ground amen you can be faithful over more areas of your life how many want to do that by God's grace am brother random he said that day on Calvary he saidthe sinful world had a blackout the sun went down in the middle of the day it had a nervous prostration The Rock shook the graves rent and the dead bodies bursted from the grave what did do god zeroed in on Calvary he wounded that animal called Satan forever Hallelujah brother B said now Satan's been more vicious since then because it brought to light to the human race and anyone knows that a wounded animal is its most vicious crawling around with its back broke he said but now Satan was knocked out at Calvary so he's wounded and knocked out the Earth proved that it was the greatest price that was ever paid the one and only that could pay it come and done it at Calvary that's where the great price was paid that's one of the main things about Calvary and the scripture said after Jesus gave gave up the ghost the Bible said that the earthquak the Rocks rent Hallelujah there's such an earthquake and I just had this simple thought you know that was actually a fulfillment of what the Garden of Eden prophecy was the Bible said the seed of the woman will bruise the head of The Serpent and the Bible says Heaven is God's Throne Earth is my foot stool so when Jesus said it was finished it was if as it was if it was as if God took his heal and he crushed the head of the serpent and it caused an earthquake amen hallelujah he crushed it that's where the earthquake came from amen it was the Christ it was God bruising the head of that Serpent and the Bible said because of that Jesus was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil church and that means and the influence it means to loose you it doesn't mean Satan's dead but it means you're loose from his powers hallelujah amen you're loose from the is it Venom or what is that what a snake has venom I always get that mixed up venom and poison I get those mixed up Mali corrected me on that years ago but I forgot but it looses us from that the effects of the Venom from the the bite of the serpent we all had it in us but when when Jesus died he crushed that and he says if you believe on me if you confess your sins I'll heal that Venom I'll heal that bite praise God hallelujah and the life of God the life of the Lamb will come into us hallelujah amen amen for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil hallelujah what a promise Church what a promise so Satan is more Vicious he's wounded right brother B says he's like a lion without teeth he'll just roar at you but it gets pretty loud and the church said sometimes he Roars like you're going to die or this going to this awful what's going to happen next year with the election or this year or you know how close we going to get in the squeeze you know to uh to any suffering you know he tries to he tries to be more vicious but we've got an overcoming power tonight amen hallelujah if we keep our mind stayed on Christ God will keep us in perfect peace Hallelujah no matter what may come Satan was knocked out at Calvary hallelujah amen thank God it's 8:00 already my goodness so Jesus was marred in such a way that we could be spotless right he was totally ripped up mangled disfigured so we could be a spotless woman Hallelujah he was covered in his own blood with his bones staring at him look like a worm he was made to look like a worm a bloody beaten worm disfigured so we could look like a beautiful clean white uh purified Bride on her wedding day like brother Austin and sister Lena last year Hallelujah Lena was a picture of what Christ does for us amen hallelujah but it it it it wasn't what we did it was what Christ did hallelujah amen and this m church this is a gift hallelujah salvation is a gift Hallelujah but he did it because of his love for you and I hallelujah amen he did it for the joy that was set before him remember that was his people the Bible said he washes us Ephesians 5:27 that he might present to himself a glorious church not having spot nor or wrinkle or any such thing think about that I'm I'm always interested and I I don't want any wrinkles in my shirt that's that's why I take them to the dry cleaner my wife kind of rolls her eyes you know well I I work around a lot of rich people you know so I don't want to look like I'm you know I guess I got these complexes but Jesus was beaten and bloodied and bruised to make his bride where there's not even one Wrinkle in her clothes in her dress there's no spots there's not even one stain amen totally pure praise God or any such thing amen any bad thing that that happen to your laund Tre a hole sometimes they go to school they got holes in it they ask Mr Smith why do you got holes in your sweat sweater I'm like I didn't look I don't know I'm sorry that's my fault I just have holes I don't even see him but not Jesus bride there's no such thing she's completely purified she's completely dressed for the occasion because Jesus dressed her hallelujah amen amen right he said but that she should be holy and without blemish so he was Mo that you might be pure he was disfigured so you might be in the right figure Allelujah now Ephesians 5 shows it from God's perspective right you know so in other words us having no spot or blemish God already sees us as that way right but Peter gives us our perspective because we know our lives are not always without spot Hallelujah sometimes we know there's spots in our lives that we're guilty of we walked in some mud so second Peter 3:14 gives us this I thought as I was going through the scripture I'm like wow that's right God sees us as perfect but Peter tells now if anybody would have been known about being washed by Jesus and then defiled right afterwards was was Peter Peter said wash not just my feet wash all of me amen and then a few hours later I don't even know I don't even know him I don't know him denied him more than Judas did right as far as the number of times of verbal denials but what does Peter say wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things be diligent that you might be found in of him in peace that's why we preach on the Christian family what's the one thing we want in our home well there's three things right righteousness joy and peace peace with God Amen Hallelujah we got reconciliation with God hallelujah have peace with God and the only way to have that is to keep his commands so be diligent that you may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless but if we go back to the other verse he's the one that makes us that way he does he will if we let him Hallelujah if we'll yield him if we'll surrender he'll keep us without spot and without blemish and he'll present to himself a glorious Church without spot or wrinkle Hallelujah Glory now back to Isaiah 50:6 with this thought of being marred I gave my back to the smiters and my cheeks to them that plucked off there look he he just gave his face he just gave his face the presence think about that you're in the presence of God and you strike him you're Creator the one who gave you breath the one who gave you your lungs and your your nervous system and your your oxygen and everything everything's working the very one who gave it to you you slap him across the face but he just gave it go ahead because it was a symbol of what we all would have done right the Bible said all we are scattered like sheep right he took upon us he took upon himself the sin of the whole world we all we all would have rejected him we all would have despised him he had to pay the penalty for our sins and then he says I hid not my face from shame and spit so God wanted to show the whole world that he was willing to take all the brunt all the punishment he was willing to take all of our shame all of our guilt all of our revist words all of our Blasphemous words he was to take that in the face to show his amazing grace to us hallelujah remember the Sho bread is called the presence of the face that was God you know the it's the second step of Grace right outer Court washing water baptism blood forgiveness the second stage you got light from the church ages and you got the bread it's called the bread of his face in other words God I'm going to eat in your presence we're going to have Fellowship we're going to commune together amen but on the cross it was as it was as if every person was saying I don't want to eat from you I don't want your bread I don't want to I don't want anything from you I'm totally denying you I'm blaspheming you like Paul said I blashe you ignorantly the Bible said in other words all Humanity was showing their disrespect to God and God stood there and took it Hallelujah because he knew there would be somebody that would want his love and his Mercy as well praise God Amen Hallelujah see we all would have rejected the face of God and yet he forgives us and invites us back to seek his face Hallelujah I don't I forgot to pull up that scripture from Psalms where the Bible said uh you'll seek my face I I heard you say Seek my face and hit your face Lord I will seek I don't know if you can pull that up there somebody could find that on their phone but this proved all of us you know God opened up his face and that was the part that was unrecognizable you couldn't recognize who is that Jesus of Nazareth who is this couldn't recognize him but see he took that in his face he took all of our sin upon his face that later he could with his healed face with his face transplant Hal should I should say face transformation hallelujah amen hallelujah with his transformation then the Bible said in Revelation 223 there shall be no more curse but the Throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it and his servant Shall Serve him Revelation 22:4 and they shall see his face and his name shall be in their foreheads amen oh my Hallelujah so we get his name here and we get to see his face Hallelujah whereas before in our sinful life we would have disrespected the face of Jesus we would have done everything despite to dishonor the face but now because of his blood now because of his sacrifice now because he allows us as brother dig says he allows us to touch him ah he made a way we could touch him amen he didn't keep us from him he invites us into him he said come unto me all you that are weary and heavy laden and I'll give you rest for your souls amen if anybody's weary or burdened tonight come to Jesus hallelujah amen come talk it over with Jesus have some communion look full in his wonderful face hallelujah amen amen hallelujah so because he took all the all of the the sin upon his face now his face shows us Mercy when we accept his forgiveness when we love him and keep his commands now his face is changed back Hallelujah so Saints he became unrecognizable so we would be recognized praise God the Bible says now children we are the children of God hallelujah now we are the sons of God the Bible says now we're accepted in the Beloved in heaven amen hallelujah so he had to be unre recognizable so that Jesus now knows our name hallelujah what a blessing Paul speaks of it in 1 Corinthians 13:12 for now we see through a glass Darkly speaking of prophecies tongues and visions and all these things we're trying our best to understand it all but then face to face how many looking forward to that time praise God Amen like we've heard brother Ram say we'll get to ask questions to Jesus all of our unanswered questions will be answered there Hallelujah I imagine a lot of the answers will be Lord why'd you allow this for your good let me show you how it worked out for your good maybe it was Generations down the road it turned out for your good to your family remember like brother di said Abraham died and only had a few descendants it wasn't like the stars of Heaven he died not inheriting the promise yet Glory but it's the power of yet God's promise is still going to come to pass Hallelujah haven't seen it yet but it's going to come to pass Hallelujah and then shall I know even as I'm known well that tells me now that I'm already known in heaven I we've already showed you we already have access in the presence of God God must know us if he lets us in his presence Hallelujah and then I'll know others even as I am known in heaven I just read it through this week in Daniel chapter 10 where Daniel's fasting for 21 days and the angel says Daniel don't worry you are beloved in heaven heaven loves you Hallelujah Church isn't that great to know Earth might despise you this world might despise you your co-workers your friends might despise you but Heaven loves you Hallelujah you are beloved in Heaven by the grace of God Amen praise the Lord let's remember Calvary as we're closing here by God's grace let's remember Calvary today Hallelujah every I want to just close with this every gate every promise that we need to con possess is available to us if we'll walk into the possession Jesus conquered every single gate and then the Bible says you are more than a conqueror see because you you get more than just conquering something then you you get to rule then you get to Reign then you get eternal life then you get a theophany body Hallelujah you're more than just a conqueror you're a bride hallelujah praise God you're more than that and every gate is accessible to us tonight musicians can come let's stand to our feet by God's grace I'm going to look up that scripture face will I seek we remember this one second Corinthians 7:14 If my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face that was exactly one hour turn from their Wicked Ways then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land yes this is the what I was looking for psalms 27 this is actually the rap rapture chapter that's right brother BR used verses 1-5 Psalm 27 1-5 is the rapture text verse 8 when thou said us seek my face my heart said unto thee thy face Lord will I seek now friends I don't know about you but I look at these moments when we have extra Services I look at these moments like this like God is calling me to seek him more right because remember in the greatest sacrifices always come the greatest blessings Hallelujah that means we got some great blessings coming tonight by God's grace if you haven't already yet got them by God's grace Hallelujah the Courage the strength to go on remember the Bible said Paul would just go around on his missionary journey and the Bible said he encourage the the Saints in other words they were discouraged but then when he got done preaching they walked out there encouraged ready to overcome ready to possess the gates of the end me brother bang Hallelujah ready to overcome by the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah see he became unrecognizable that we could recognize him and then we would be recognizable Hallelujah let's bow our heads how many know that he's going to say Well done good and faithful servant he's going to recognize your service to him remember he did it all throughout the church ages remember the ther Church age he starts off by saying I know your works I know your love your patience and then he says I know your Works Jesus doesn't forget one thing that you do for him because he knows you Hallelujah he died for you hallelujah praise God let's bow our heads for a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for tonight Lord God Lord thank you for the marred Visage that's right Lord you became a curse you were like a slaughtered lamb unrecognizable you became ugly that we might become beautiful by the blood of Jesus Christ we thank you God for the great sacrifice of the Cross Hallelujah father we want to walk Lord today in the newness of life we want to appreciate the cross and we want to possess the gates of our enemies that our Lord has already conquered for us and father as we look at these extra services or these times Lord we look at it as a chance to seek your face we feel your presence drawing us closer I know that's how we all feel Lord God if we miss church one time and we're sick we feel like oh I missed out and oh my I can't wait to get back into the presence of God where the spirit of God is pouring out on me Hallelujah as your Prophet said we must always stay where the spirit of God is pouring out great Holy Spirit pour your blessings out on us to tonight dear God may we be encouraged as we leave this place father God but Lord we want to worship we want to enjoy your presence here tonight Lord we remember your death we remember your suffering that you might give us life you became our sin that we might become your righteousness thank you Lord for making us your righteousness Lord God hallelujah thank you Jesus bless us as we worship if there's any needs on the hearts I just pray God we could pray for one another in Jesus Christ's name the Saints said if you desire prayer you're morning than welcome to come up I'd be happy to pray with anybody that needs a prayer Hallelujah
