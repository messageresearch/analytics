TRANSCRIPT
========================================
seven Church ages and the Seven Seals by God's grace Revelation chapter 5 let's go to verse five we'll start there by let's try to maybe we can all read verse 5 six and seven together let's try that by God's grace we'll read three verses here okay let's read verse 5 6 7 together ready 1 2 3 and one of the elders saith unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been said slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne amen may God add his Blessing to the reading of this Thy word Lord may be seated Hallelujah bless our word Lord here tonight hallelu so just a really Brief Review U we looked at on Sunday uh the breach between the seven Church ages and Seven Seals the breach means a gap and brother R this is not the Seven Seals or the church ages it's the Gap in between there but as we'll see tonight this is actually very uh this is connected to the Seven Seals because this is the time when the lamb takes the book and that's the seven seal books there is a connection but brother man's just pointing out you know between the church ages and the seals there's this breach here or this Gap and it deals with of course chapter four which are the things that should be Hereafter John being caught up and then the enthroned elders and then the four living creatures then chapter four then chapter five is the seven seal book Hallelujah and Christ coming to take the seven seal book amen uh we looked at how the book of redemption is the main thing uh of this sermon here from brother brandham and then brother Ram dealt immediately with Revelation 10 after reading his text and showing how uh the seventh Church age Messenger will be on earth when this book is revealed revealed hallelujah amen so people that say the Seven Seals are not revealed uh they they're going against that quotation right they're going against that but we don't want to go with it I'm sorry we don't want to go against it we want to go with the word of God hallelujah and we saw that how though some may say Jesus is here in some ways and yes in one way is Spirits here uh we saw that we're still looking for the Corporal body hallelujah we're still looking to Heaven brother Ram said for the coming of the Corporal body Hallelujah so we don't want to get caught up in false doctrines and false moves and so forth and thank God we're not uh we're thankful that the kinsman redeemer is what we see in this chapter brother Ram of course dealt with uh Ruth and Naomi and Boaz Hallelujah as we looked at at the end there and I didn't spend a lot of time on that I'm not going to spend a lot of time on that either tonight I just kind of felt led to go to these other routes here uh but we see Revelation five reveals the kinsman redeemer I'll say like this the true kinsman redeemer right because although Boaz was a wonderful kinsman redeemer Boaz died right Boaz sinned but there came a kinsman redeemer that never sinned hallelujah amen there came a kinsman redeemer that could redeem more than just Ruth and Naomi there there came a kinsman redeemer that could reveal all of us redeem all of us Hallelujah by the grace of God think of that from the dawn of time till now these 6,000 years of human history that one great kinsman redeemer the Divine kinsman redeemer was able to redeem all of us hallelujah there's power in the blood of Jesus tonight amen and we know that you know law had requirements and there were very strict requirements no one could meet it Grace met the requirements Hallelujah and then we saw again how uh Boaz was a type and I just thought that was beautiful wasn't it beautiful just to see how uh Boaz was so thankful for the respect that uh Ruth had shown to the word of God wasn't that beautiful just a real beautiful love story Hallelujah that God places in there and she respected the headship of her previous husband so much so uh that God honored her by giving her a Boaz Hallelujah and that's just one thing IID like to here thank God that we respect the headship of the word of God hallelujah remember I preach this in the uh in the series on the Mysteries every other denomination they have a head but it's not the it's not Christ it's their Creeds their headship is not God because if it would if it was they'd accept all the revelations of the Bible right and that's one of those great types I saw there in re in Ephesians chapter 5 the head of the woman is Christ the head of the church is Christ so the the word of God is our absolute amen not a Creed not an idea not a tradition of man not a saying not a writing from a church father but our absolute is the headship of Jesus Christ the word amen hallelujah I just thought for me I just want to place that in there a little more uh emphasis there by God's grace Hallelujah that's our headship that's why we type or the anti-type of Ruth Ruth is the type we're the anti-type Hallelujah does the Bible say in Romans 7 we areed married to sin remember that but the Bible said that that husband has died now we can be married to Christ hallelujah amen we should be married to another Hallelujah the one who died and rose again that's who we're married to hallelujah amen oh my it's an invisible Union hallelujah praise God there's coming a day though when our face shall be sight Hallelujah and it will be a visible Union amen the Bible said when we were when when we're with Christ when we meet him in the air we shall ever be with the Lord hallelujah amen amen my what a blessing now the next thought and this is the one I kind of skipped over Sunday because I I knew I had a little more on this and I didn't uh go into this one real depth real in depth but it kind of ties in actually pretty quite similarly with this this song that we've been preaching through right the song uh recognizing you today serpent seed perfect Faith now we're on the breach but this tied imperfectly and believe it or not did anybody listen to uh the breach this week okay Believe It or Not brother random when he reads about the kinsman redeemer his statement is about serpent seed which I preached a few weeks ago brother BR said oh when I think of that scripture now let's go to the scripture he's talking about uh Revelation 5 verse uh 9 and 10 and they sung a new song saying thou are worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and H has redeemed us to God by thy blood amen out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth Hallelujah this is a beautiful thought I never I never really caught this if I did I forgot it but brother R says oh when I think of that scripture for thou has redeemed us back to God and we may Reign and be Kings and Priests on the earth did you catch that these Saints are now saying we you've redeemed back what Adam lost Adam was the the original King Adam was the original priest and now by the blood of Jesus Christ he gives it back to us hallelujah he restores us back now of course this is for the Millennium but right now we're spiritual Kings and Priests but the Millennium will be natural and spiritual Kings and Priests it'll be just like the first day amen hallelujah Glory Hallelujah it'll be that honeymoon Hallelujah that thousand year honeymoon the millennial rain and the Bible said we reign as kings and Priests on the earth back with the same Dominion that Adam had hallelujah amen it's all connected to this seven seal book this Revelation and brother Adam gave it to us with thus sayith the Lord hallelujah oh my thank God I think about it sometimes it just it's overwhelming my goodness oh my what the kinsman redeemer oh what a story we would have here he says notice the law required a kinsman redeemer to redeem a law substance Grace met this requirement in the person of Jesus Christ a Kinsman must be born of the human race Hallelujah he said and now now he could we could be when every man that's born anybody that couldn't see that it was adultery well there well is totally blind because every man that was born was born of a woman so this is an amazing thought and I never really caught it I've been preaching all these years I've been preaching 20 years and I'm going to share this in just a moment but I've always wondered why would brother Brandon bring in serpent SE to the Seven Seals and I just might as well read the quotes right now here's a quote this one stumped me for years Saints from a sham 1965 July 11th there he is with them Angels he's talking about that picture of the cloud out there which is a supernatural Cloud the message which was the seven breaking of them Seven Seals that revealed serpent seed and all these things here now that always stumbled me the Seven Seals revealed the serpent seed because I think about the first seal I think about the second seal now I don't see any serpent seed in there third seal anybody try think of them now four seal this six seven like I don't see any serpent seed in there and then all all on the way to drive the church on Sunday morning it struck me while I'm sitting there praising God the serpent seed is seen in chapter five because no man is worthy it's hidden in there and because every man was born of Woman except Adam and then he sinned so we see the seed of the woman not the seed of the serpent the seed of the woman is the only one who could Prevail hallelujah oh oh I hope you see it by God's grace no one was worthy so it took a virgin born kinsman redeemer the seed of the woman Genesis 3:15 Hallelujah not the seed of the serpent the seed of the woman so right there serpent seed is in it because of the evil of serpent seed at the beginning God had to create a kinsman redeemer he created his own son Hallelujah and he sent that son to redeem us back to God oh 20 years of preaching and I got the Revelation driving to church amen oh my it's amazing amen I didn't get to it I wonder that for 20 years why did Brother Ram say serpent seed with those Seven Seals I never saw it before until Sunday now you all might be way ahead of me but let me Rejoice for a few minutes if you already saw that hallelujah hallelujah he said he said there's this covering he says Seven Seals and revealed serpent seeds Seven Seals rais for serpent seed yes it did chapter 5 and it shows that it is his very ing his supreme authority that cloud is the supreme authority the head like a cloud he said the Supreme he's the wigged one the Bible said he changed his countenance and changed himself amorph the word comes from the Greek word Amor he said God is changing his mask and doing another act you know we went to a play we had a field trip at our school we went to a play and this one guy changed his mask about seven or eight times and by the end he was sweating I thought wow that's just like Christ right you see Christ in in Adam in Adam's life you see Christ in Noah's life you see Christ in Abraham he keeps changing his mask but God don't sweat Hallelujah God don't get tired amen he don't sleep nor does he get weary amen he's always there when we need him Hallelujah he always shows up he changes his mask Hallelujah he manifests himself Hallelujah I was just reading this week again how he hides himself so many times in scripture remember in John chapter 5 he healed that man that blind man and then the Pharisees kick him out of church he says who are you to teach te us the fair that's that demonic uh spirit from the spirit of the serpent you can't teach them nothing they think they know it all but he said who are you to teach us get out of here and the Bible said then Jesus went and found him because Jesus was hiding oh God my Hallelujah and then he revealed himself he said he saidh do you believe in the Son of God he said I I don't know who he is he said the one that speaks to you is the Son of God Church the one that opened our eyes is the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah the Son of God Amen so true and that remember he hid himself uh on the on the road toas he act like he was going to walk away remember that he act like he's going to walk away sometimes God's acting like he's going to leave our presence to see if we want him to stay Hallelujah so what do we got to do we got to invite him back Jesus don't leave me Jesus stay with me keep your anointing on me praise God remember remember out there on the sea of giley he act like he was going to walk by he's actually walking by his disciples in their boat in the storm he's walking by like not not even looking at him right what does he do he wants you to cry out Amen brother man said God likes it when we're like children and we cry out for his Blessing Hallelujah God wants us to cry out and say I Need You Jesus Lord I need you every hour I need you amen oh Hallelujah there he is changing his mask here's another beautiful one along the same lines these two quotes always stump me there's probably others what a day what a time we're living this great mystery of God being finished bringing in the godhead showing what it is how these little isms and went off and made this and somebody made him this and somebody made him that but the angel Lord came down and brought up all their isms and pulled out that truth of it that's exactly right and presented it and there it is just as perfect as it can be no other way you could go there it is that's what he is see serpent seed all these different things that's been so mysterious among the people see what it is it's the sign to unite he says Hallelujah that's what we've been doing Church in our lives we've been uniting with the word right everybody okay tonight by God's grace amen all right did I say something wrong Hallelujah well if I said something right you can say Amen to it hallelujah amen sign to unite and that's what uh William and uh beatress have been doing since they come in the message they've been uniting with the word and now here our next Generation what are we doing we're uniting with the word I need more of the word I want to be with the word I want the word in me praise God I want to speak the word I want to live the word I want to do the word hallelujah but notice he ties in oh now he ties in the godhead with the seals the godhead is in the seals I had to go look but I found it before service hallelujah amen my goodness it's amazing so now now now now that I see the serpent seene in Revelation chapter 5 and I just was I was praying up here it just kind of struck me so I wrote them down so we see the serpent seed in Revelation 5 that's part of the seals we see the godhead in Revelation 5 because it's the line of the tribe of Judah and the root of David so somebody was before David and we know Jesus told us in the in the uh in in the gospels who that was who's the root and offspring of David who came before David and after David that's no man that's got to be God hallelujah is that right amen so the God and then and then Jesus comes and takes the book out of the right hand of him that sits on the throne now we know God's invisible right so we don't we don't know there there wasn't there wasn't like a uh we we don't know what the throne was like but somehow Jesus comes like a lamb and he comes and brother man said he proceeded out of Eternity amen hallelujah brother said he proceeded out of Eternity and come come forth from the intercessory Chambers the Bible said remember there's the Bible said your hope is in the is in the holiest of holies your hope anchors in heaven remember that that from Hebrews so out of the throne comes forth the lamb and the lamb takes the book and he comes to open the book amen oh my there's the godhead not two persons not three persons didn't say there was a dove there and an old man there people confuse Daniel chapter 7 but it all works together if you got a spiritual mind Hallelujah so there the godhead is in Revelation chapter 5 as well the church ages are in the seals because the four beasts are the four anointings on the church ages and the church said the oil and wine is in the third seal what's that what's the oil the baptism of the Holy Ghost you don't get the Holy Ghost when you first get saved you got to be Sanctified you then you got to be filled Hallelujah Glory so many people can't see that they're blind they're blinded by the the systems of this world but thank God your eyes can see hallelujah oh my thank God the baptism of the Holy Ghost are in the seals amen hallelujah so is the god so serpent seed so is the church ages Israel's blindness that's a big topic right Romans 11 Hallelujah Romans 10 Romans N9 Ephesians 2 Ephesians 3 is and then the fifth seal is Israel's blindness Hallelujah the mystery of iniquity the White Horse right that's the Antichrist Spirit that's the mystery of iniquity that's what the Antichrist does it commits iniquity Hallelujah and then you got the Rapture the Rapture is a seven SE seal oh my no wonder Bram could say when those seals broke it it finished the whole mystery of God it ties all these things together every other Doctrine can be tied in together perfectly and we've got the mind of Christ oh my Hallelujah now while I'm on this I'm going to read a few things here uh by God's grace because the serpent seed remember and I was reading it just tiing it with everything I was reading here this week I was reading I'm reading through the Book of John the Gospel of John and Jesus is speaking to Pharisees we know there's a lot of Pharisees out there today Jesus proved it Jesus said few there be that find the narrow road so that means most people associated with churches are Pharisees going to hell it's sad to say that but that's what Jesus said not what I said Jesus said few there find the the narrow road that leads to life right but notice what Jesus told these phes he says in in uh John 8:23 you are from beneath I am from above this is the part where Jesus is not pulling punches with these Pharisees Hallelujah if you believe not I am he you shall die in your sins he said uh verse 37 I know you are Abraham's seed but you seek to kill me because my word has no place in you so see what are the attributes they want to kill they want to silence God Jesus Hallelujah he said if you were Abraham's children in verse 39 you do the works of Abraham Hallelujah he said vers verse 41 you do the Deeds of your father Oh my he said if God were your father you would love me for I proceeded forth and came from God in verse 42 verse 43 he says why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word now I'm talking about Pharisees I'm talking about people that go to church and they can't understand the word of God blessed are your ears for you can understand Hallelujah because look this is the dominant Spirit of this day people that go to church claim to know all about it but you can't teach them anything they can't learn new revelation and they're going to hell if they don't repent right the majority few there be that find the narrow road my verse 44 and ye are of your father the devil because the lust of your father ye will do see outwardly they had it all good but inwardly Jesus said they were dead men's bones inwardly they wanted best seats in the market right they wanted the greetings in the market they wanted the best clothes and they uh they cared so much about the little things and they left out the bigger things of the gospel and they wanted everybody else to do the work but the Jesus said you wouldn't even lift a finger let's not forget many times we're surrounded by these people is that right Church Hallelujah remember I went through that list of 110 false doctrines a lot of those deal with sanctification so most most Pharisee churches today allow people to sin and we can go through the list in 1 Corinthians 6 and Galatians chapter 5 fornication adultery homosexuality right revilers heresies all these things that's the mark of people that are uh under the Pharisee spirit thank God we've got the Holy Spirit hallelujah hallelujah amen this is what separated them verse 47 he that is of God hears God's word amen that's why we can see serpent seed and godhead and the rapture we can see all that in the Seven Seals Hallelujah because we we know God's word hallelujah oh my it's creating a greater separation every day right the Bible said this they're getting darker we're getting lighter they're becoming more like the beneath we're rising up on that stature Hallelujah ready to unite with the Capstone hallelujah amen we're building up in here ready to unite with the Capstone hallelujah we're uniting with the word of God hallelujah amen they said he's got a devil verse 49 Jesus answered I not a devil but I honor my father and you dishonor me Hallelujah then he he just uh he he does a mic drop at the end he said I he said Abraham saw my day and was glad he said you're 50 years old have you seen Abraham he said before Abraham was I am amen mic drop right there Hallelujah and then they they they tried to get him but what the Bible said he hid himself there it is amen God hiding himself in Simplicity Hallelujah God hides himself in the word the simple Bible Revelation God is hiding himself tonight hallelujah thank God that we can find him Hallelujah the Pharisees will never find him now remember I have uh how many I got there's six attributes I put in my book about the uh attributes of serpent seed I thought I'd go through this because brother saw serpent seed in here Hallelujah and I showed you the nine proofs a few weeks ago when I preach on serpent seed right number one the serpent seed they go through they're Lawless and they go through vain beautiful religious acts uh and create their own Traditions that's the first attribute I lift Cain there's all the I mean there's all these Bible verses in here footnote upon footnote second they do not abide in the truth and therefore they despise the truth right that's why we got to be careful when people leave a message church or you know they got to be careful they can take the wrong Spirits right that's 1 Timothy 4:1 if you accept a false Doctrine you've got a seducing Spirit right or even somebody in a message church right number three the Lawless deny the full power of the Holy Spirit the Bible said they deny the power thereof they have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof amen any anyone need God's power Hallelujah see they want to shut down God's power but we've got to cry out for for God's power amen they deny it they don't want it they get used to not having it we've got to cry out for it Hallelujah number four Satan's Children lie that's what Jesus said there are their father the devil Liars Hallelujah fifth they persecute and kill the righteous and if they can't kill you physically they try to silence you like herodias silenced John the Baptist that Spirit of Elijah oh can you see it today Hallelujah everybody see today oh my thank you Lord thank you Jesus amen woo Hallelujah that made me happy because I want to hear the spirit of Elijah Hallelujah we get to hear it praise God Amen oh my so brother man said anyone that can't see that was adultery they're totally blind because every other man in Revelation 5 was born of a woman it required a kinsman redeemer he said every man on Earth was born of a man a woman of an act I'm taking out some of the words for the children he said now you don't don't see now don't you see that's where it come from that's where sin started so see where it's at now then there he comes your seed of the serpent in so that's where Cain came in right it was in the garden but Jesus was promised 4,000 years later I'll send the seed of the woman and he'll crush the Serpent's head church that doesn't mean uh kill physically it means to stop the influence Jesus Jesus has delivered us from the influence of Satan oh Hallelujah my thank the Lord amen hallelujah now the the scripture I want you pull up is second Peter 1:4 we've been getting some good timely scriptures out of second Peter 1 lately I forget the other one but somebody found it might have been Malachi somebody found me might have been Lydia oh yeah yeah the uh life he's given to us life and godliness all things that pertain to life and godliness yes that's right Hallelujah that I think that was at Junction City when the Holy Spirit brought that to us in other words uh yeah Jesus said John 16:13 the Holy Ghost will guide you into all truth how many believe that but that doesn't mean like you'll know every secret like the Rapture or you know the new name it just means everything Glory that pertains to life and godliness God will guide you into it right let's let's find that one can you find the scripture about life and godliness is that is that verse three he's given to or is it verse five pertaining to life and godliness is that it yeah according as divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain to life and godliness and the church said God will guide you into the truth but it's not every single thing in the every knowledge every single fact or Revelation but it's all the life and godliness you need for today and your lifetime Hallelujah think about that Martin Luther John Wesley they didn't have the Seven Seals open right but they had all things that they needed for a Godly life hallelujah amen oh my thank the Lord Lord Heen now so now I can finally understand why brother Ram connected serpent seed with the seals it just struck me on Sunday morning Hallelujah so corruption came by lust let's read verse four sorry how did Sin get in the world the Bible said lust I don't know anyone that's lusted after an apple right I mean it's it's very clear the the the words that God uses see we we we you know Jesus gave us these promises that we might be partakers of divine nature having escaped the corruption that's in the world through lust lust so we can see it plainly now corruption came in the world by lust so adultery but Redemption came by virginity or Purity right Redemption came by the seed of the woman corruption came by the serpent seed so so no man was a able to look on the book get that Dominion back get that eternal life back no one was able to look on it except a seed of a woman that was created for that purpose hallelujah oh my amen hallelujah so now I can I might make a video about that one next week by God's grace Hallelujah because I like to share these fresh Revelations like oh I never seen it and then today while I'm praying I'm like there's one two three four five six seven eight major maybe major is not the best word but eight very important teachings Hallelujah re Revelations even Mysteries right godheads a mystery Rapture is a mystery Israel's blindness is a mystery Church ages are mystery serpent part of the mystery of iniquity mystery of iniquities mystery so those are all right there in a part of the Seven Seals amen all right now uh acts 2028 brother said now notice now he must be Kinsman so you see an angel couldn't do it a man couldn't do it well it must be a man but he can't be born of a woman of a male and female act so the Virgin birth the Holy Spirit overshadowed Mary therefore Jesus was not a Jew Jesus was not a gentile Jesus was God Amen Hallelujah that right that's exactly his blood didn't come from a human uh Marriage Act he was the Holy created blood of God and we're not saved by Jewish blood nor by Gentile blood we're saved by the blood of God that's according to the Bible it says so hallelujah oh where does it say that in Acts chapter 20 Hallelujah take heed this is Paul's last message to the Ephesians right we want to be Ephesians we want to be mature Christians right you forget about that lately I I did take Eed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost has made you overseer so that's what a minister we're supposed to oversee and make sure everybody's doing good by God's grace everybody's feeding on the word of God watch over the flock make sure sure everybody's doing good by God's grace feed them the word of God to feed the Church of God which he has purchased with his own blood so that wasn't Mary's blood it wasn't Joseph's blood it was the blood of God hallelujah and the church said so the real kinsman redeemer didn't have blood from a natural man and woman he had blood from God hallelujah created blood amen that's what brother says he said so you see Jesus was God he was not no third person I like that grammar not no third person fourth person second person he was the person he was God see he was God Emanuel God come down from his glory revealed himself I love that song of Booth cliber uh oh love of God how rich and pure hallelujah amen I love that song now of course he then he sings it there oh how I love him oh oh how I adore him my breath my sunshine my all and all the great Creator became my savior and all God's fullness dwells in him oh my amen maybe we'll sing that at the end here by God's grace now he says Christ has redeemed us now we're now redeemed everybody say now but he has not claimed his possession yet so he hasn't come down and claimed his wife yet actually come down the living the living wife right now you might differ with that and even the Earth right he hasn't come down and taken over the Earth yet he hasn't that's his possession he purchased the Earth with his blood right brother man Tau the water of Noah's day that's type justification Jesus SP filled his blood on the cross that's sanctification by the blood and the fire that's going to burn the Earth over for the Millennium that types the baptism of the Holy Ghost water blood spirit right water Blood Fire Hallelujah so Jesus has uh he's washed it he's uh Sanctified it but he hasn't come down and claimed it as his own yet he's already purchased it though he's redeemed it amen he said now you might differ with that but just hold on a minute see we'll see he hasn't climed it see if he took the book of redemption everything that Adam had and everything that he lost Christ redeems back and he's already redeemed us but he hasn't took the possession yet he cannot until the time appointed and then come the resurrection and the Earth will be renewed again and then he'll take possession his possession which he got when he redeemed us but it will do it at the appointed time oh my hallelujah oh there's an appointed time church amen Jesus is going to come back and he's going to claim his possession he's going to take what belongs to him and that's what the Rapture is about he's taking his bride he's claiming his bride before he pours out his wrath upon the Earth right now if you got your Bible go to Jeremiah 326 this is a very little known scripture do you remember this verse brother Diggs read this last time he was here on his opening text but then he never preached it the rest of the time did everybody anybody catch that all right oh yeah virtue did all right amen me too Jeremiah 32 so I was waiting I'm like I've always wondered about this verse I I said in my mind I was like brother BR preach it in the seals but it was the breach Jeremiah 32 so let's read it and then we'll see how brother Braham uses this here Jeremiah 32 and it's verse 6 6 to5 just a little portion there by God's grace what I say 6 to 15 keep looking for the oh okay there all right yeah all right now verse six and Jeremiah said the word of the Lord came unto me saying behold Hanam the son of shalam thine Uncle shall come unto thee saying buy thee my field that is in anoth for the right of redemption is thine to buy it okay so there's a land that belonged uh his uncle and then he's supposed to buy it it belonged to his uncle right he's supposed to buy it and that's his right so he must have been the nearest of kin to the the uncle right but you got to buy it church we can talk about uh uh our possessions all we want right we can talk about God's promises all we want but we got to buy it we got to believe it right the Bible says buy the truth and sell it not Hallelujah we got to believe he says uh no I lost my spot verse eight so Handel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the Lord they said to me by my field I pray thee that is in anathoth which is in the country of Benjamin for the right of inheritance is thine and the Redemption is thine buy it for thyself then I knew that this was the word of the Lord verse nine and I bought the field of Han hamile my uncle's son that was in ameo and weighed him the money even 17 shekels of silver and I subscribed the evidence and sealed it and took Witnesses and weighed him the money in the bounces so he paid it he's got evidence of it and it's sealed Hallelujah sound pretty good those are some pretty good Bible words right there right Redemption bu it evidence sealed amen sounds like the Holy Ghost to me Hallelujah sounds like the Seven Seals to me and the church said Hallelujah by verse 11 so I took the evidence of the purchase both that which was sealed according to the law and the custom and that which was open and I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baro the the son of nah the son of Mah in the sight of Hann Hanam mine uncle's son and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison so he did it in the front of witnesses didn't Jesus rais from the dead and he proved it to uh countless Witnesses Hallelujah when God does something doesn't he give a witness hallelujah our spirit Bears witness with his spirit that we are the children of God Hallelujah right on Mount Transfiguration when Jesus got that saying right hear ye him what happened God took Witnesses up there Hallelujah when you get married there's Witnesses we Are Witnesses hallelujah amen coming up on a year by God's grace we're Witnesses God always has Witnesses Hallelujah and so this is purchased it's redeemed it's bought it's paid for it's got evidence it's sealed and then there's witnesses to it oh Hallelujah didn't Boaz have to get Witnesses before he could purchase Ruth and Naomi Hal he's got to get Witnesses Hallelujah God always has a witness of the truth hallelujah amen verse 13 and I charged barug before them saying thus sayith the Lord of hosts the god of Israel take these evidences this evidence of the purchase both which is sealed and the evidence which is open and put them in an earth and vessel that they may continue many days for thus sayith the Lord of hosts the god of Israel houses and Fields and vengers shall be possessed again in this land amen amen Hallelujah I'm going to buy this I'm going to purchase this I'm going to seal this but then I'm going to hide it away for the right time I can get it back hallelujah oh my Hallelujah sound familiar Church how many know what I'm talking about you know the punch line already all right but let me before that one let me read this here uh John Gil said this he bought it so it might continue many days even many years to the end of the Captivity oh my my that's the natural captivity what about the end into the spiritual captivity hallelujah oh my as it was designed they should when Jeremiah's heirs having some of them when they were deposited might take them up and claim the estate so Jeremiah bought it oh Jeremiah bought it so his heirs years later could possess the promises the promises of inheritance amen oh my do you see it church amen we got it on two levels here the resurrection and then the opening of The Seven Seals Jesus resurrection and the opening of The Seven Seals oh right is that right oh my brother Bram says this now where I lost my spot there he said now if you'd like to look in the scripture you can get over in Jeremiah and find out there anybody remember listen that one when he was going to the Captivity land you know he bought his uncle's Sons had some property and went through that ceiling and if we took it we got all that also in the seven Church ages them seals and so forth in there so you see a seal on the Old Testament was like a roll and then brother R demonstrates a roll I'll just do it like this so brother R said the old the old books are like you've seen the Scrolls right so brother would said that that'd be the first seal and then the second seal was another paper he'd wrap around that right it' have a seal on you have to put that wax seal on there right then you put another one that's the first well in this case it might be the seventh seal because it's all the way in there right I wish I had seven papers to make it more scriptural tonight but you understand so that if I put a wax seal on there now there two seals same book right but all seven had to be broken hallelujah amen he says no so he explains that he said we have books now but they they they were called Scrolls he says and then when he break the other one loose you can see what the claim was and the whole thing here is Seven Seals got the mystery of God from the foundation of the world all sealed up in there and revealed by seven different seals that if God willing let us pull back these seals and look down through the book and find out what it's all about see I hope we have a great time remember this is right the day before he preached the first seal there the mystery of redemption is sealed this book could not be broken until the last Angel's message the scroll is there we know it was there we know it was Redemption we believe it was Redemption Jer I said the scroll must be kept as you read it in there he'll say he must be kept in an earn vessel now here it is listen you hold on a long time with this quote he said oh what a beautiful thing I could talk about a while the scroll was kept in an earn vessel a vessel that once became flesh Glory died rose again and kept in an earth and vessel until the time of purchase Oh My beautifully amen and church not many people say Amen on it right because they weren't it was the first time they' heard it Hallelujah but now you can see it Jesus came down and he purchased the possession he purchased it he gave evidence for it and it was sealed they tried to seal him in but he broke the Easter seal he broke the Roman seal hallelujah amen and the Bible said he he revealed himself he made a show of them openly Hallelujah he made a show of all the principalities and Powers he showed them and gave them W many witnesses that I am alive I was dead but now I live Hallelujah and then he sealed up these Mysteries right in an earth and vessel until a later time when it could be possessed Hallelujah and when was that that was in 1963 We Believe by God's grace now the reason we say that is because brother R would preach a seal and then he say that's thus sayith the Lord and then we see it line up with scripture it's got to be right because it lines up with everything else in the scripture Hallelujah so now God has brought the book back to us so we can redeem we can uh we can live the blessings of being a redeemed child of God we can enjoy the rights of being a Christian hallelujah how many appreciate the rights of a Christian amen you have rights of the the scripture these are your rights hallelujah hallelujah they were they were hidden a vessel for seven Church ages amen hallelujah these some of these seven seal Revelations were hidden there for seven Church ages Hallelujah and now they've been brought out for you and I hallelujah oh my hallelujah oh thank the Lord amen thank the Lord let's see where I better finish right here let me finish with this one I made a video on this one today I just had a I like 10 minutes to throw together a video and put out there it was a real blessing to me now brother man goes back to uh Revelation 5 we're going to try to close here by God's grace 5 yes verse verse 5 Revelation 55 and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lon of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the look out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne oh we got a beautiful picture in here brother Bram says brother Bram said we the Bible tells us we come to we we announce that a lion has prevailed and brother BR said John looked over expecting to see a lion but he saw a lamb Hallelujah because we know Jesus is both The Lion and the lamb how many you see that in your life sometimes you got boldness like a lion sometimes you got to be real humble like a lamb and take some beating or take some I'll say like this take take some uh chastisement can I say it like that I shouldn't say beaten but chastisement some people get offense at words like that nowadays you know chastisement got to take some correction or remember and and the Bible says sometimes you'll suffer for your mistakes but the Bible said you'd have to deal with that but the Bible says God gets Glory when you suffer for something you didn't do Peter says that that's real suffering that's partaking in Christ suffering when you're persecuted just for being a Christian just for your stand on the word of God Amen so John turns to see a lion but instead he sees a lamb and look he's all bloody so this again proves you can't have the Seven Seals without the cross the blood of Jesus Christ amen and that proves it to us if the Seven Seals were open this day then we need to know about the blood we have people that have been to Calvary amen they've confessed their sins they they've called on God they repented been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and filled with the Holy Ghost amen that's what we need today we see it here you can't have the Seven Seals without a real experience with the the bloody lamb I'll say it like that amen there's that lie going around of course it went around for many years that you got to you got to know brother brandom to be saved you got to know brother brandom and that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost that's a lie you've got to confess your sins and become a Christian amen that's how you get saved you got to trust in the blood of Jesus Christ to be saved am and then you got to get Sanctified got to walk through your Wilderness you got to get a a new heart that justification new spirit then you got to get God's spirit hallelujah oh we're thankful Hallelujah for God's grace oh my so we see it's all connected here by God's grace we can see all these and can everybody see all these uh revelations in here all these topics all tied in with these Seven Seals it's amazing it just blew my mind now I'm going to read this quotee this be my last quote I think by God's grace I might pull up another one actually just because I put this one on the video okay this one's from the first one's from the breach here by God's grace just give me a second here I want to pull this other one up uh I remember it's Amos and lion okay thank you thank you for your patience okay all right let me start with this one sorry that's quite quite a long pause there have some time to get your breath there and the line of the tribe of Judah prevailed but said don't weep John for the line of the tribe of Judah the root of David has prevailed he's already overcome he has done it it's over John Woo oh my he produced a bleach that sends sin along back to the greasy hands uh that defiled it that defiled the human being so back to hell right back to Satan all the punishment for the sin goes back on Satan right the Bible tells us that right he'll have a he'll have an end time the Bible say he shall be no more that proves he won't burn eternally like this uh Catholic Doctrine it's a Catholic dog Dogma Lydia showed that with me I still got to preach that I gu still got to make a video on that I got to show that how uh there's no eternal hell like it was a Catholic created Doctrine remember that you Shar that with me no okay somebody did I know I got in my notes that's okay if you didn't hun sorry somebody Shar with me he says but when John turned to look he saw a lamb what a different from a lion he said the lion has prevailed see I can use that here God hiding him in Simplicity amen he looks for a lion but God's hiding in a lamb oh my he's called a lion but he looks like a lamb am hallelujah oh my we look like just regular flesh we just like look like flesh and Bone but really we're the we're part of the word hallelujah we're God's children Hallelujah we look like we're just regular but we got Christ in us the hope of Glory Hallelujah that's why you live like a Christian because you've got Christ in you like I heard brother R say like you can't train a a a hog to dress up like a tuxedo and go out to some nice restaurant or something like that you don't have that nature I mean you you can dress him up like that but he's not going to act different and that's how you know brother brother said you don't have to go up to your sheep uh or your dogs you have to go up your dogs or sheep and say can you grow some hair here or a sheep can you grow some wool yeah let me work on that yeah I'll start on that you know no you just do it naturally it's just part of your nature nature right you when you got the nature of God it produces the life of God Amen that proves you're a Christian because you become more like Christ all the time you don't got a pig dog nature you don't got a a skunk nature something you've got the nature of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen because it naturally does it right I've got the I've got the desire to be like God I've got the desire to worship I got the desire to read my Bible I got the desire to become more like Jesus hallelujah oh it's a brother said it's automatic Hallelujah you have this you have this desire it's automatic desire yes you'll fight the flesh but you got the desire the ultimate desire the desire that wins the day is The Life of Christ he say there he goes I can use that again God hiding himself in Simplicity look there's a lion but there goes a lamb he said there's a lion that's the king of the Beast the lion has prevailed the strongest thing there is is a lion I've laid out there in the jungles of Africa and heard the giraffe squealing and the Great Mighty elephant with his trunk in the air we we wee we saw family member I didn't tell you this hun we saw one of your family members and she was going to Africa this week uh and she saids yeah I love just sitting out there she said I love sitting out there for game and she said I love hearing and she named those two she said the giraffe and the Elephant I'm like she's preaching my sermon right here you're not a preacher it's just a testimony and I was just shocked I'm like wow she's going to Africa where brother went to Africa I heard the giraffe she said giraffe and I love to hear it and then she said I love to hear the lon Roar I'm like that was in my notes I almost preach that today it it was just amazing moment there God vindicating I felt like this was what he wanted me to preach just a humble just my my guess brother man I hear the giraffe squealing the mighty elephant is trunk in the air he says wee wee wee and then I hear the little Savages of the desert screaming out their bloody curdle cries yeah sometimes we hear those uh don't we hear foxes out in the field and they're who's got the blood curling cries out there the foxes man they sound crazy they found like they sound like screaming women like fck violent fights or something like that we can hear their bloody curdle cries yeah it's amazing what he hear out there he says and The Beetles till he said Billy Paul and I laying on a little old piece or place covered over stickers but then way off in the distance a lion will Roar so it's not even loud a lion will Roar he said and everything in the desert shuts up even The Beetles stop hollering so from the biggest animals down to the littlest beetle the king speaks he said oh my now he's talking about Revelation 5 the he's looking for a lion comes out and sees a bloody lamb he said I tell you he says that's when denominations and doubts fall to the ground and the church said everything gets quiet he says when the king speaks and this is the king that's his word hallelujah praise God Amen this is the king speaking Hallelujah when the word of God is preached and it's Purity the lion is roaring the king is speaking it's God's word amen every denomination shuts up right as I told you I'm still waiting for somebody to challenge me on my two books or my videos on the Seven Seals and all these major doct even water baptism still waiting for somebody to challenge and they can never do it right all they can say is well you've got your opinion and I've got mine but no I've got more of opinion I've got the word of God because there's not one scripture uh where a person was ever baptized in titles right or God's ever God's never called two persons or three persons that's the absolute truth so they can make all their excuses all they want God's word Roars like a lion hallelujah amen God's word cannot be stopped God's revelation is true it's right it's Vindicated Hallelujah and it Roars like a mighty lion hallelujah amen let's stand to our feet by God's grace I better stop right there I'm going to read that quote I went searching for Mal you can come brother BR said I believe it was Amos as I was referred to him a while ago when he said he was not a prophet neither a son of a prophet but said when the lion roars who can but fear then he says he tells this story again and if anyone ever heard a real lion roar in the wilderness these you hear in the cages around here are just meowing right how many been to the Aran zoo I went to ACO one time and he kind of roared a little I was like that wasn't really that impressive but that's CU he's inside that's CU he's in a cage what if he was outside and he had all his his livelihood but they're just meowing they just meow at the Aran Zoo but when one Roars in the wilderness everything takes heed I've laid in the jungle to hunt them he's the king of the beasts I've laid he says when the lion roars even The Beetles stop holling everything does the jackals hyena screaming other animals squawking the baboons and monkeys beetles you can hardly think to your self but in the distance let a line Roar and every Beetle will stop hollering see everything is afraid of him yet there's many things that can kill him like a humans but he's recognized as the king amongst the beasts and he said when the lion roars who can but fear he said then God has spoken who can but prophesy pull up uh Amos 37 and 8 I believe it is this is a this is a Bible requirement for a Prophet this is why we know so many people that say they prophets are not false I'm sorry not prophets they're false prophets because they've never revealed any secrets in the Bible they they they they introduce false doctrines they introduce confusion and lust of the flesh right that the people can do the lust of the flesh but this is how we know this is one proof brother R was the prophet of God surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealed his secret unto the Servants of the prophets brother R revealed Secrets right and we just named some of them here especially the Seven Seals I proved it Hallelujah by God's grace Hallelujah he says the lion hath roared who will not fear the lord God has spoken but who can but prophesy so we see here any prophet of God who's speaking thus sayith the Lord Roars like a lion and everything else gets quiet everything else is quiet everything else brother R says every denomination in other words every church every doubt and fear will get quiet and church what we need in our life we've had brother random come but what we need in our life is for God's word to speak to us and it will calm all of our doubts it'll take away all of our fears amen because the line Roars and everything has to come to peace Hallelujah peace be still is what Jesus said amen let's bow our heads Hallelujah father God we thank you for tonight we thank you for the word of God that we've heard Lord God thank you for the truth of the Holy Ghost thank you that our eyes can see thank you that we're the seed of God hallelujah oh God thank you Lord God the serpent seed is so rampant Lord as you said few there be that find the narrow road that leads to life thank you for the seed of the Holy Ghost Peter calls to The Incorruptible seed the word of God which is in you which liveth and abideth forever Hallelujah Lord may we automatically just continue to grow in Grace and knowledge of the Lord give us all things that pertain un life and godliness Lord God and Lord let your voice speak to us Lord that all the doubts and all the denominations and all the lies Lord any trial we're going through Lord let the word of God speak let the line speak and everything else will come come still Lord God and we can have peace in our hearts God we can have Victory Lord by the Holy Ghost Lord thank you God for the blessing of God thank you for these promises Lord as Jeremiah said they'd be sealed up for many years but then release at the right time Lord God thank you for these truths we give you the glory tonight Lord God and Lord just minister to your people as we worship and sing father God may you deal with them Lord God may you bless them God For Your Glory thank you Lord for the truth of Thy word thank you that a lion has roared a prophet has roared Lord God and we have thus sayith the Lord we thank you God for your blessings in Jesus Christ's name amen hallelujah praise God hallelujah I got some songs here by God's grace list Sing Your Love defends me Hallelujah we saying Lord I need you how many need the Lord to defend them Hallelujah sometimes we have enemies come against us but the Lord will defend us the Lord will fight for us hallelujah we're trusting in Him we don't trust in man we trust in the Lord Jesus
