[37:34] you know the lord just gave us grace and
[37:36] uh he sent
[37:37] another individual just happened to be
[37:39] in that area and
[37:40] and uh they were crying out for truth
[37:42] and and just felt like
[37:43] he told me he said he said the closest
[37:44] thing i could find was a oneness
[37:46] pentecost with the bible
[37:47] he said and then i just ran upon you
[37:49] guys website on the internet there
[37:51] and uh just happened to move right in
[37:52] town at the same time he said i'm i was
[37:54] looking for truth and this is where god
[37:56] told me to go
[37:57] so i've seen this now three times
[37:59] supernaturally vindicated
[38:02] we don't just go by like i said uh a
[38:05] sign isn't our proof
[38:06] but i'll tell you what you line up with
[38:07] the word uh you know you're on to
[38:09] something so i believe that uh we are

[39:24] through the scriptures uh just laying in
[39:26] a little topic for you
[39:28] on trying to tie a few of those things
[39:29] in like i said this is a lot going on
[39:35] and that's been kind of my problem i
[39:36] come here and i preach these really long
[39:38] series and i like to get into the depths
[39:40] of every subject i can
[39:42] and uh i feel like that's uh what lord
[39:45] gives me and i just
[39:46] and i i like to jump in everything i
[39:48] hear i like to tie it in with the
[39:49] scriptures
[39:50] and uh people can interpret things the
[39:53] way they want and i feel the liberty to
[39:55] allow the holy ghost
[39:56] to uh to bring things to me likewise
[39:59] amen
[40:00] um i don't have any bitter spirits or
[40:02] feelings towards anybody no matter what
[40:04] they've done or where they've gone or
[40:05] or how it is um but this is uh
[40:09] this is a day and age where you know
[40:10] we're doing our best to make the rapture
[40:12] and i believe that this is going to
[40:13] produce it and i've seen plenty enough
[40:15] evidence to believe it so
[40:16] um we will continue on daniel 12 1.
[40:20] here it is quite a start here
[40:24] it says and at that time shall michael
[40:27] stand up the great prince which standeth
[40:30] for the children of thy people
[40:31] and there shall be a time of trouble
[40:34] such as never was since there was a
[40:37] nation even
[40:38] to that same time and at that time thy
[40:40] people
[40:41] shall be delivered uh every one that
[40:44] shall be found
[40:46] written in the book all right and many
[40:49] of them should that sleep in the dust of
[40:51] the earth shall
[40:52] awake and some to everlasting life some
[40:54] to shame and everlasting contempt
[40:56] and they that be wise shall shine as the
[40:59] brightness
[41:00] of the firmament and they that turn many
[41:03] to righteousness
[41:04] as the stars forever and
[41:08] ever amen one more portion revelations 8
[41:10] 1
[41:11] we're not going to fully deal with this
[41:13] unless the inspiration would lead me to
[41:15] go that way
[41:17] but just knowing that the end of
[41:20] all things is at hand uh we see that
[41:23] daniel 12 there it works with the great
[41:25] tribulation period moving in
[41:27] uh setting in and uh it looks like we
[41:30] are going to be that church that will
[41:33] rise
[41:34] above that in a rapture amen uh so we're
[41:36] looking for that we're
[41:38] believing that we're going to avoid
[41:39] those uh those trials that soon will
[41:42] come
[41:43] um if the blands are listening there on
[41:45] on live stream god bless you brother
[41:47] johnny i didn't get to say hi to you
[41:49] there
[41:49] i i thought you might be your second
[41:51] service and uh lord knows so god bless
[41:53] you
[41:53] uh sure love you in the lord as well as
[41:55] everyone else who wants to make it back
[41:56] amen that might be listening amen
[41:58] but it's good to see uh uh like i said
[42:00] everybody who's pressing the house of
[42:01] god tonight
[42:02] amen revelations 8 1 it says here it
[42:05] says and when he had opened
[42:06] the seventh seal uh there was silence in
[42:09] heaven
[42:10] about the space of half an hour amen
[42:14] uh let's go ahead and bow our heads and
[42:15] we'll we'll say a word of prayer and
[42:16] we'll get we'll get rolling on this as
[42:18] quick as we can amen uh lord jesus
[42:21] here we come once again before you lord
[42:24] uh realizing that you are the author and
[42:26] the finisher of our faith
[42:28] and uh yet tonight uh once again coming
[42:30] lord thou know us so lord we
[42:32] we had uh a great time with you this
[42:34] morning and we're asking that you
[42:36] our great invited guest uh would be
[42:39] in the midst of your people god speak to
[42:41] them wholeheartedly
[42:42] and as i would desire lord and lord
[42:45] maybe
[42:45] we all get a side of ourselves and just
[42:47] let your holy spirit have preeminence in
[42:49] this place
[42:50] and uh surely oh god if there's a
[42:53] direction you'd like me to go please
[42:54] anoint me to do so
[42:56] and i will be quick to answer thee lord
[42:58] the best i can so
[43:00] uh in all this we know that we're all
[43:02] sinners saved by grace lord but we sure
[43:04] love you and appreciate you for all the
[43:05] mercy that you've given us
[43:07] so lord we just ask you to have your way
[43:09] now for the lord jesus christ's name we
[43:10] pray in the church says
[43:12] amen you may be seated
[43:18] okay
[43:21] a lot of scriptures to go through i'm
[43:23] going to try to paint a picture for you
[43:25] today through the scripture
[43:26] um perhaps maybe a little bit like this
[43:28] morning uh but i believe it will help
[43:30] you
[43:30] and uh it'll also show your expectation
[43:33] where it should be
[43:34] and i think a lot of times we're we're
[43:36] really expecting uh uh
[43:38] perhaps maybe even a life of ease going
[43:40] into these things
[43:41] uh but i want you to see where we're at
[43:43] of course you know we're living in the
[43:45] season
[43:46] uh of that seventh seal right and uh
[43:48] we're living right at the coming of the
[43:50] lord
[43:51] um which is it had to be a mystery right
[43:54] and uh when we
[43:55] began to go through and and look at the
[43:57] the seventh seal
[43:58] we've all done it uh when it really came
[44:01] to the opening of it it just brought us
[44:03] this one portion that uh when that
[44:05] seventh sealed
[44:06] was open there was silence in heaven for
[44:08] the space of a half hour
[44:11] that's really not a lot right and uh yet
[44:13] when we begin to
[44:14] look at it and look at what the prophet
[44:16] says we find that it really was only
[44:19] opened up to one fold he said in the
[44:21] seventh seal
[44:22] and that was up to the opening of the
[44:24] seven thunders right
[44:26] now i want to begin to work with this
[44:28] because all these things were left
[44:30] mysterious right because remember if
[44:33] satan ever got a hold of it
[44:35] it would do great damage right so
[44:38] remember that's one of the things you
[44:39] never do if you say it out loud or if
[44:41] lord reveals something to you sometimes
[44:43] he tells you to keep that quiet right
[44:45] and the reason why is that because satan
[44:47] gets a hold of it
[44:48] he'll do anything in his power to try to
[44:52] what to destroy what that will bring
[44:54] right
[44:55] so notice tonight we're going to deal
[44:57] with this idea safety in goshen all
[44:59] right
[44:59] and the uh and knoweth it not in 65 815
[45:03] 170
[45:04] uh he's talking about these things and
[45:06] he said and he said
[45:07] there'll be hideous sights upon the
[45:10] earth
[45:12] locusts with hair like women
[45:15] long hair to haunt them women
[45:18] that cut their hair teeth like lion
[45:21] stingers in their tails like scorpions
[45:24] they would torment men
[45:26] months just wait till we get
[45:31] into opening them plagues and seals and
[45:34] then
[45:34] them seven thunders watch what takes
[45:37] place
[45:37] oh brother and this is where we're gonna
[45:39] focus tonight he says
[45:41] oh brother uh uh we're on
[45:44] slide four it says oh brother you better
[45:47] get to goshen
[45:49] while there's time to get to goshen
[45:52] don't pay any attention to this
[45:56] outside phenomenal quote
[46:00] but it's working with what moving into
[46:03] the tribulation period right
[46:06] and uh of course he talks about those
[46:08] plagues and the thunders and remember
[46:10] uh we find that evidence after the seals
[46:12] that it was his desire to get
[46:14] some time and to actually go and preach
[46:16] on the vials
[46:18] preach on the trumpets preach on the
[46:20] thunders
[46:21] and uh notice uh it never got to a place
[46:24] outside of the trumpets where he could
[46:25] actually do that
[46:27] but notice and this is where we want to
[46:29] focus
[46:30] because he actually begins to relate
[46:33] that tribulation period
[46:34] and he said you better get to goshen
[46:37] before
[46:38] that time all right all right because
[46:41] there's
[46:42] only going to be a certain amount of
[46:43] time to get there
[46:46] so that tells me right there when you
[46:48] look at the coming of the lord
[46:50] you can actually go back to the
[46:53] scripture
[46:54] and then going back to the scripture you
[46:57] can find that there should be a picture
[46:59] that plays with goshen all right
[47:02] now notice this let's take a look at
[47:04] goshen here
[47:05] in genesis 45 remember god had actually
[47:10] allowed joseph to perfectly
[47:13] type christ but in the end it was
[47:15] actually to save life wasn't it
[47:18] in genesis 45 7 it says and god sent me
[47:21] joseph speaking before you to preserve
[47:24] you
[47:25] a posterity in the earth and to save
[47:28] your lives by
[47:29] a great deliverance oh my god so now it
[47:33] was not you that sent me hither
[47:35] but god isn't it something you don't
[47:37] have to blame your brother for anything
[47:39] you have to be bitter at people that
[47:41] disagree with you or do bad things to
[47:43] you
[47:44] right you don't have to get like that
[47:46] because why
[47:48] because if you can actually see that the
[47:50] footsteps of the righteous are
[47:52] ordered then you can still love them
[47:53] amen
[47:57] joseph was able to actually move into
[47:59] the mind of god
[48:00] and realize that those things were
[48:02] actually done
[48:04] he allowed them to betray him so that he
[48:06] could actually save them
[48:09] hallelujah it's okay if you disagree but
[48:11] i believe i
[48:12] trust that what the movement of the holy
[48:14] spirit on a true believer
[48:16] that no matter if they've gone or
[48:18] wherever they're at it will allow that
[48:20] true believer by faith to bring them
[48:22] back to a place they can get saved right
[48:24] amen as was evidenced by the prayers
[48:28] that we've seen here
[48:30] hallelujah now notice he
[48:34] says uh and he hath made me the eighth
[48:37] verse a father to pharaoh
[48:39] and lord of all his house and a ruler
[48:41] throughout all the land of egypt
[48:43] hate she and go up to my father and say
[48:45] unto him
[48:46] thus saith thy son joseph
[48:49] god hath made me lord of all egypt come
[48:51] down unto me
[48:53] tarry not in the desert condition come
[48:56] down to joseph look
[48:57] and thou shalt dwell in the land of
[49:00] goshen
[49:02] and thou shalt be near unto me
[49:06] thou and thy children and thy children's
[49:08] children that flocks my herds and all
[49:09] that
[49:09] thou hast and there will i nourish thee
[49:12] for yet there are five years of famine
[49:15] lest thou in thy household and all that
[49:18] thou has
[49:18] come to poverty amen now let's look at
[49:21] this the original intent of god
[49:24] for goshen was actually so god
[49:27] would what he would give his church a
[49:30] place
[49:31] so joseph would nourish them
[49:35] goshen is a place of nourishment
[49:40] remember joseph was a type of christ
[49:44] now bringing the church back and while
[49:47] we find that he doesn't give them the
[49:49] worst of the land the desert land
[49:51] he gives them the ocean
[49:55] and there was a place to be nourished
[49:58] all right let's continue
[50:00] genesis 47 4. moving on he says
[50:04] they said moreover unto pharaoh for to
[50:07] so adjourn in the land are we come
[50:10] for thy servants have no pasture for
[50:12] their flocks
[50:13] for the famine is soar in the land of
[50:14] canaan now therefore we pray thee let
[50:17] thy servants dwell
[50:18] in the land of goshen right he's given
[50:21] us permission right
[50:22] he says in pharaoh speak unto joseph
[50:24] saying thy father and thy brethren are
[50:26] come
[50:26] unto thee the land of egypt is before
[50:30] thee
[50:30] in the best of the land make thy father
[50:34] and brethren to dwell
[50:39] whether you see it or not if you're in
[50:41] goshen
[50:43] you are in the best place to dwell
[50:48] now i want you to see this because this
[50:50] is going to move into something all
[50:52] right
[50:52] it may not be what you think it is but
[50:54] at least show you where you're at
[50:56] so he says in the land of goshen let
[51:00] them dwell
[51:00] and if thou knowest any men of activity
[51:02] among them make them rulers over my
[51:04] cattle
[51:04] and joseph brought us in his jacob his
[51:07] father and set him before pharaoh and
[51:08] joseph blessed
[51:10] jacob blessed pharaoh all right so
[51:12] notice goshen was the best
[51:14] possible land that they could live in
[51:17] all right
[51:18] now let's continue so let's get to the
[51:20] definition what is goshen what does it
[51:22] mean all right
[51:24] next next slide here it says goshen
[51:26] actually has two meanings all right
[51:28] one is an approaching or a drawing near
[51:34] we are drawing near brother sister but
[51:37] notice
[51:37] the second definition is reign
[51:40] or the dew of heaven in blessings
[51:46] so it's a what an approaching or a
[51:48] drawing near
[51:50] to the rain amen or to the dew
[51:54] of blessings all right we're looking for
[51:57] a ladder right amen and what goshen is
[52:01] typing what moving or approaching near
[52:04] that that time when you'll be able to
[52:07] pull the blessings of the reign of god
[52:09] out
[52:11] in a time of trouble all right
[52:14] so in type it was given because of
[52:16] joseph
[52:18] right goshen is given to you and taught
[52:22] it's also set before he was sent before
[52:26] to deliver joseph norse them
[52:28] it was the most fertile land that they
[52:30] had now let's
[52:31] look at this in the token in 64.
[52:34] it says israel coming out of egypt as i
[52:37] said a few minutes ago
[52:39] is a type of the bride
[52:43] coming out of the church
[52:46] when moses began his ministry
[52:49] israel gathered together in one place
[52:52] in goshen begin to pray
[52:56] because they knowed that the hour was at
[52:58] hand
[52:59] because they knew something was there
[53:02] the delivery had already come
[53:04] god was working doing things showing
[53:05] what he was going to do
[53:07] they come from all parts of egypt just
[53:10] like they will at the day
[53:11] of his coming they'll take
[53:14] people out of the methodist baptist
[53:17] lutheran right remember in revelations
[53:19] 18
[53:19] 4 it's come out of her my people and be
[53:22] not partakers of her sins
[53:24] that the plagues come not upon thee all
[53:26] right he'll say what and
[53:28] all those who are identified in christ
[53:31] by the token
[53:32] god will take them with him when he
[53:35] comes amen
[53:37] so notice going into goshen is what a
[53:40] type of the bride coming out of what
[53:42] is coming out of the church and what
[53:46] into the fertile lands where they can be
[53:49] separated
[53:50] all right now we're going to begin to
[53:51] look at this all right
[53:54] i want you to see this in one
[53:57] sense we look at goshen and we say wow
[54:02] what a place of blessing and i'm gonna
[54:04] hit that tonight
[54:05] just a little bit and then we're gonna
[54:07] come back around
[54:10] because you hear it so many times but
[54:12] there's light in the ocean sister when
[54:15] there's light and goshen it ain't
[54:16] nothing but a blessing glory to god
[54:18] we're in goshen
[54:20] hallelujah and it's so easy for us to
[54:23] get caught in that type
[54:24] or that idea that goshen is nothing but
[54:28] a place of blessing and no challenge
[54:31] all right it sure sounds like it let's
[54:34] look
[54:35] as the plagues next slide are are coming
[54:38] down
[54:38] on the earth uh uh the ten plagues of
[54:41] course the plagues that fell from moses
[54:43] there
[54:43] it says exodus 8 20 says the lord said
[54:46] unto moses
[54:47] rise up early in the morning and stand
[54:50] before pharaoh
[54:51] he cometh forth to water and say unto
[54:54] him thus saith the lord
[54:56] let my people go that they may serve me
[54:59] else if thou wilt not let my people go
[55:02] behold i will send swarms of flies upon
[55:05] thee
[55:05] and upon thy servants upon thy people
[55:07] into the houses and the houses of the
[55:09] egyptians
[55:10] shall be full of swarms of flies and
[55:12] also the ground
[55:14] whereon they are all right so remember
[55:17] he gave the sign of of the rod get
[55:20] thrown on the ground it was a snake
[55:23] and what pharaoh had some magicians
[55:26] that could do the same thing amen
[55:28] although it was
[55:30] actually what moses stick that ain't
[55:32] theirs amen
[55:34] hallelujah that's quite the snake right
[55:37] but now look at this so now pharaoh
[55:40] refused him and said it was a cheap
[55:41] magician's trick
[55:43] and now god is sending a plague of flies
[55:45] upon pharaoh in his house
[55:48] now look at what this says in the 22nd
[55:50] verse it says and i will sever
[55:53] in that day the land of goshen
[55:56] in which my people dwell that no
[56:00] swarms of flies shall be there
[56:03] oh glory to god no plagues
[56:06] in goshen hallelujah
[56:09] to the end that thou
[56:12] mayest know that i am the lord
[56:16] in the midst of the earth amen
[56:20] so when these plagues were actually
[56:22] coming down remember which was a type
[56:24] of of the church or the the bride
[56:27] leaving the church
[56:30] god was actually severing goshen from
[56:33] the rest of the judgment
[56:36] we should look for that amen to not have
[56:39] the same judgment that's upon the earth
[56:42] right why because we're living in the
[56:45] ocean
[56:47] hallelujah the approaching near the rain
[56:49] the dew of blessings right
[56:52] now notice 8 23 and this is huge
[56:56] and i will put a division
[57:00] between my people and thy people
[57:03] tomorrow shall this sign be
[57:06] and the lord did so and there came a
[57:08] grievous swarm of flies in the house of
[57:09] pharaoh
[57:10] and into his servants houses and into
[57:12] all the land of egypt the land was
[57:13] corrupted by reason of the swarm of
[57:15] flies right
[57:17] the commandment was let my people go let
[57:19] my people out of egypt
[57:22] god is doing that right now he's trying
[57:24] to get us out of egypt amen
[57:29] now notice this but god has to want
[57:33] he has to show a difference between
[57:36] goshen and the rest of egypt all right
[57:40] and notice it's his desire to put
[57:43] division that is what viewable
[57:48] that there's a supernatural protection
[57:50] over the bride of jesus christ
[57:54] notice they couldn't kill moses
[57:57] they couldn't kill aaron his spokesman
[58:00] they couldn't touch them amen
[58:02] they were ordained for a job and until
[58:05] the job was finished they could not be
[58:07] touched why
[58:09] because they were what they were called
[58:11] in an hour to bring forth
[58:13] the church hallelujah so notice
[58:16] there had to be division now we want to
[58:18] hurry through this here
[58:20] uh looking in the lamb's book of lies he
[58:22] said then this wise virgin went away in
[58:24] translation
[58:26] and these others who came and knocked on
[58:27] the door what happened what taken place
[58:29] the bible said they were cast into outer
[58:32] darkness where there was weeping and
[58:33] wailing and gnashing of teeth
[58:34] israel when the tribulation period hit
[58:37] egypt
[58:38] there wasn't one thing ever struck the
[58:40] israelites because they were in god's
[58:42] provided place
[58:43] goshen no tribulations at all see
[58:46] the rest of them was in the tribulation
[58:48] but not this one now all those things
[58:50] being shadows they've got to type
[58:52] something amen there was a type of
[58:56] judgment falling out
[58:57] right now remember
[59:00] the bride we're going to see the start
[59:04] because remember why were those 200
[59:06] million demons released
[59:09] they were aimed at the bride but they
[59:12] will miss
[59:12] the bride because the bride goes into
[59:15] rapture and they will fully manifest on
[59:17] the church
[59:18] all right now let's look once again hell
[59:21] when hale came in in exodus 9 26
[59:23] only in the land of goshen were the
[59:25] children of israel where the children of
[59:27] israel were
[59:28] was there no hail no plagues are there
[59:30] exodus 10 20 it says but the lord
[59:33] hardened pharaoh's heart
[59:34] so that he would not let the children of
[59:36] israel go and the lord said unto moses
[59:38] stretch out thine hand towards the
[59:39] heaven that there be
[59:41] there may be darkness over the land of
[59:43] egypt even darkness which
[59:44] may be felt and moses stretched forth
[59:47] his hand towards heaven
[59:49] and there is a thick darkness in all the
[59:51] land of egypt three days
[59:53] they saw not one another neither rose up
[59:55] any from his place for three days but
[59:57] all the children of israel had light
[59:59] in their dwellings so while the plagues
[1:00:03] were falling on
[1:00:04] the unbeliever the church was protected
[1:00:08] and taken care of
[1:00:10] amen sounds good all right so notice
[1:00:15] goshen was the place of separation your
[1:00:17] prophet said you better get to goshen
[1:00:19] while you can get there
[1:00:20] amen so goshen is a place where the
[1:00:24] blessings of god are it's the most
[1:00:25] fertile land
[1:00:27] all right next slide
[1:00:32] so i went through that pretty quick
[1:00:34] these i got two sermons in one here so
[1:00:36] i'm not able to fully do it as good as
[1:00:37] i'd like but i want you to see this it
[1:00:39] said
[1:00:39] we tend to think the life of israel was
[1:00:42] rejoicing in pleasure
[1:00:43] as their deliverance comes right
[1:00:46] that's what we focus on there's light in
[1:00:48] goshen all there is having a hallelujah
[1:00:51] a good time
[1:00:52] well i think the pledge that they were
[1:00:54] missing was probably a hallelujah good
[1:00:56] time
[1:00:58] but just because they were missing the
[1:01:02] brunt of those plagues
[1:01:04] don't think that there was not
[1:01:06] opposition and
[1:01:08] challenge to the movement that god was
[1:01:11] trying to do
[1:01:12] in them amen now next we'll work with
[1:01:16] exodus 3 9.
[1:01:17] now even before as these things are
[1:01:19] coming look at what god tells moses he
[1:01:21] says
[1:01:22] now therefore behold the cry of the
[1:01:24] children of israel has come up
[1:01:26] unto me and i've also seen the
[1:01:28] oppression where with the egyptians
[1:01:29] oppress them
[1:01:30] come now therefore and i will send thee
[1:01:33] unto
[1:01:34] pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth
[1:01:37] my people the children of israel out of
[1:01:40] egypt they were already in slavery
[1:01:46] when the pledge began falling they did
[1:01:48] not lose
[1:01:50] the servitude of slavery
[1:01:53] although they missed the lot
[1:01:56] the plagues fallen they were still
[1:02:00] living under the toil of life
[1:02:03] all right let's go a little further when
[1:02:06] you see this exodus five
[1:02:08] we'll draw here a little bit one and
[1:02:10] afterwards
[1:02:11] moses and aaron went in and told pharaoh
[1:02:14] thus saith the lord god of israel let my
[1:02:17] people go that they may hold a feast
[1:02:19] unto me in the wilderness
[1:02:20] and pharaoh said who is the lord that i
[1:02:22] should obey his voice to let israel go
[1:02:25] i know not the lord neither will i let
[1:02:26] israel go
[1:02:31] supposed to go easy
[1:02:34] they said the god of the hebrews hath
[1:02:36] met with us let us go
[1:02:38] we pray thee three days journey into the
[1:02:40] desert and
[1:02:41] sacrifice unto the lord our god lest he
[1:02:44] fall upon us with pestilence or with the
[1:02:46] sword
[1:02:47] and the king of egypt said unto them
[1:02:50] wherefore do ye
[1:02:51] moses and aaron let the people from
[1:02:54] their works
[1:02:55] get you unto your burdens
[1:02:59] and pharaoh said behold the people of
[1:03:01] the land now are many
[1:03:03] and you make them rest from their
[1:03:04] burdens
[1:03:06] so pharaoh didn't say you know what the
[1:03:08] plagues are coming uh those plagues are
[1:03:10] here and i don't know your god so you
[1:03:11] know what i'm going to let you guys rest
[1:03:13] and just
[1:03:13] enjoy life and take it ease and be laid
[1:03:15] to sin
[1:03:18] but we find out that he said your people
[1:03:21] are many
[1:03:22] i ain't gonna do that you get to your
[1:03:25] burden so notice
[1:03:27] notice even in the time of the
[1:03:30] deliverance of the church
[1:03:31] they still had to carry their burdens
[1:03:36] they had to have something to fight
[1:03:40] let's go next verse and he continues
[1:03:44] and pharaoh commanded the same day the
[1:03:47] task masters of the people
[1:03:49] and their officers saying ye shall no
[1:03:51] more
[1:03:52] give the people straw to make brick as
[1:03:55] heretofore
[1:03:56] let them go gather straw for themselves
[1:04:00] that's the easy life right there oh wait
[1:04:03] it's actually getting harder the closer
[1:04:06] they get to their deliverance
[1:04:09] well they we're crying out for a body
[1:04:11] change amen
[1:04:12] we're tired looking to be delivered from
[1:04:15] the slavery of this world amen
[1:04:18] being bound to system being bound to
[1:04:20] flesh being bound to
[1:04:21] anything but to the original garden of
[1:04:24] life that god called us to
[1:04:27] but look you think it'd be easy
[1:04:31] here it is it actually
[1:04:34] it says here you should no more give the
[1:04:37] people straw to make brick
[1:04:38] as heretofore let them go and gather
[1:04:40] straw from themselves
[1:04:43] and the tale of bricks which they didn't
[1:04:45] make to make you hear for
[1:04:49] it says ye shall lay upon them ye shall
[1:04:52] not diminish ought thereof
[1:04:54] for they be idol therefore their cry
[1:04:58] saying let us go and sacrifice to our
[1:04:59] god
[1:05:00] you see all they want to do was go serve
[1:05:02] their god
[1:05:03] all they originally were asking is what
[1:05:05] just let us go three days journey into
[1:05:07] sacrifice
[1:05:10] but pharaoh did not want the people to
[1:05:13] lose their slavery amen
[1:05:15] right we are a free people amen
[1:05:18] but what we constantly have to fight the
[1:05:20] slavery of this thing amen
[1:05:23] in in in the political life in in the
[1:05:25] social life
[1:05:26] in in physical flesh we have to fight
[1:05:29] right
[1:05:30] it's not giving us something easy but as
[1:05:33] the as the the uh the going away
[1:05:37] actually strikes and the exodus
[1:05:40] it actually gets harder
[1:05:44] and that should be the challenge
[1:05:48] is getting greater
[1:05:51] right i talked to i talked to older
[1:05:54] brothers at times and
[1:05:55] and they would say oh you know 30 years
[1:05:56] ago man the holy ghost would just come
[1:05:58] down and your service isn't
[1:06:00] phenomenal well why do all things get
[1:06:01] all quiet
[1:06:07] very simple because the challenge is
[1:06:09] getting harder
[1:06:11] right your prophet said this age would
[1:06:13] be many times
[1:06:14] harder than any other age so he said how
[1:06:18] can i overcome
[1:06:22] it's that fact that's a fact we're gonna
[1:06:25] have to battle to get out of here
[1:06:27] amen all right it says let there
[1:06:30] more work be laid upon the men that they
[1:06:32] may labor therein
[1:06:33] and let them not regard vain words
[1:06:37] and the task masters of the people went
[1:06:40] out and their officers and they spake
[1:06:41] the people saying thus say pharaoh i
[1:06:44] will not give you straw
[1:06:46] so everything's getting harder
[1:06:50] they're expected to do the same things
[1:06:52] but they got a greater burden than they
[1:06:53] had before
[1:06:55] well why are you saying this because
[1:06:57] this is what we're looking at
[1:06:58] it's harder to watch to get the spirit
[1:07:01] of god in the midst
[1:07:04] because why we got so many things to
[1:07:06] fight
[1:07:08] right even now we gotta fight we gotta
[1:07:10] fight cell phone addiction we gotta
[1:07:11] fight
[1:07:11] we gotta fight all these little areas of
[1:07:14] every portion of your life
[1:07:17] it's not easy it's getting more
[1:07:20] challenging
[1:07:21] yeah but one thing is factual when you
[1:07:23] look at the scenario
[1:07:26] judgment is falling all over the earth
[1:07:27] right now
[1:07:29] sometimes i thank god i said thank god
[1:07:31] for ohio because in a lot of these other
[1:07:33] places they
[1:07:34] they got their whole entire californians
[1:07:35] burning down to the ground everywhere
[1:07:37] can't even go to church oh thank god for
[1:07:40] the freedom we have amen
[1:07:42] honestly god has gave us some grace yes
[1:07:44] sir i hope i don't blow your mind to
[1:07:45] some of these things because this is
[1:07:46] this is
[1:07:47] this right scripture now notice even
[1:07:49] continuing
[1:07:50] you think you think israel is all really
[1:07:52] excited about this yes it's getting
[1:07:54] harder
[1:07:55] this is great the rapture's here
[1:07:57] hallelujah
[1:07:58] and they became more pentecostal all the
[1:08:01] time
[1:08:04] well i'll see what the scripture says
[1:08:06] next portion of scripture
[1:08:10] the officers of the children of israel
[1:08:11] move down to the 19th verse
[1:08:13] did see they were in evil case
[1:08:17] after was said ye shall not mish ought
[1:08:19] from your bricks
[1:08:20] of your daily task and they met
[1:08:24] moses and aaron who stood in the way as
[1:08:26] they came forth
[1:08:28] from pharaoh i bet they got a good
[1:08:30] report let's see what they say
[1:08:32] and they said unto them the lord look
[1:08:35] upon you
[1:08:38] and judge because you have made our
[1:08:41] savior
[1:08:42] to be abhorred in the eyes of pharaoh
[1:08:46] and in the eyes of his servants to put a
[1:08:49] sword in their hand
[1:08:50] to slay us
[1:08:54] and moses returned unto the lord and
[1:08:56] said lord
[1:08:57] wherefore as thou so evil and treated
[1:08:59] this people
[1:09:00] why is it that thou hast sent me for
[1:09:03] since i came to pharaoh to speak in thy
[1:09:05] name
[1:09:05] he hath done evil to this people neither
[1:09:08] hast thou delivered thy people at all
[1:09:13] so the leaders of israel actually stood
[1:09:16] against
[1:09:17] moses and aaron as the trial got harder
[1:09:24] oh my oh my
[1:09:27] there's doubting in the cab because oh
[1:09:30] it just became too hard to deal with
[1:09:36] things got a little bit too difficult
[1:09:39] yes
[1:09:40] so notice they turned on the messenger
[1:09:45] and yet they still we're in goshen
[1:09:50] yes sir yes sir good so i'm saying
[1:09:53] should we when you hear oh get the gosh
[1:09:55] and get there while there's still time
[1:09:59] we like to think oh it's nothing but
[1:10:01] daisies and roses out here
[1:10:05] but it's not that way the challenge
[1:10:08] is here amen the temptations are here
[1:10:12] but what the spirit of the lord remember
[1:10:16] the bible says when the enemy comes in
[1:10:18] like a flood the spirit of the lord
[1:10:20] raises a standard amen it's time to dig
[1:10:24] in deep amen realize that we're children
[1:10:26] of the king amen
[1:10:27] and we're going to act like children of
[1:10:29] the king amen
[1:10:32] we'll stay with the lord we'll keep
[1:10:34] moving forward
[1:10:35] and we'll believe every promise amen
[1:10:39] there's always going to be those that
[1:10:40] get a bad report
[1:10:43] but remember these same ones there's a
[1:10:44] mixed multitude coming out
[1:10:46] but this rapture is not that way it was
[1:10:49] a spiritual type amen
[1:10:51] hallelujah that goshen what it is the
[1:10:54] fertile nourishing land amen
[1:10:57] but it doesn't mean that you're free of
[1:10:58] the world he's right
[1:11:02] i'm looking forward to leaving it aren't
[1:11:04] you
[1:11:05] amen so even moses
[1:11:09] is asking god what's going on god
[1:11:13] these plagues all oh i mean you told me
[1:11:16] to tell him to let my people go
[1:11:18] let not my people let your people go let
[1:11:20] them go
[1:11:23] and it just kept on getting harder yes
[1:11:29] oh my let's continue
[1:11:36] exodus 6'5 next passage it says and i
[1:11:38] have also heard the groaning of the
[1:11:40] children of israel
[1:11:41] whom the egyptians keep in bondage and
[1:11:44] i've remembered my covenant
[1:11:46] wherefore say unto the children of
[1:11:48] israel
[1:11:49] i am the lord and i will bring you out
[1:11:52] from under the burdens of the egyptians
[1:11:55] so god god told me what they're still in
[1:11:57] burdens now it's double
[1:12:00] and why god brings the message to them
[1:12:03] that he's going to set them free now i
[1:12:05] want you to see this this is very
[1:12:06] powerful here
[1:12:08] and i'll bring you from the burns of the
[1:12:10] egyptians and will rid you out of their
[1:12:12] bondage
[1:12:12] and i will redeem you with a stretched
[1:12:15] out arm
[1:12:15] and with great judgments
[1:12:19] and i will take you to me for a people
[1:12:22] and i will be
[1:12:23] to you a god and ye shall know that i
[1:12:26] am the lord your god which bringeth
[1:12:30] you out from under the burdens of egypt
[1:12:33] of the egyptians and i will bring you in
[1:12:36] unto the land
[1:12:37] concerning the witch i did swear to give
[1:12:40] it to abraham isaac and jacob
[1:12:41] and i will give it you for in heritage i
[1:12:43] am the lord. now look at this
[1:12:46] the old underlying part exodus 6 9 and
[1:12:49] moses
[1:12:50] spake so unto the children of israel
[1:12:53] but they hearkened not unto moses
[1:12:57] for anguish of spirit
[1:13:01] and for cruel bondage
[1:13:06] that was a word of prophecy a word
[1:13:09] straight from god to encourage them
[1:13:14] in all their burdens even double foam
[1:13:17] get ready it's not going to last much
[1:13:21] longer i'm going to redeem you set you
[1:13:24] free
[1:13:26] but i want you to see this they were so
[1:13:28] much
[1:13:29] placed into a servitude
[1:13:35] so much into being worn out by all the
[1:13:38] surrounding conditions
[1:13:41] that were around them the bible says
[1:13:44] they weren't even able to hearken
[1:13:47] unto the voice of moses and he said it
[1:13:51] was because
[1:13:52] they had anguish of anguish of spirit
[1:13:55] and for cruel bondage
[1:13:59] the challenges of the world were just
[1:14:00] too much
[1:14:03] oh my let's look at anguish
[1:14:07] so they had what spiritual anguishment
[1:14:10] here
[1:14:11] extreme pain either a body or mind
[1:14:14] as bodily pain that may differ from
[1:14:16] agony
[1:14:17] which is such the stress of the whole
[1:14:19] body as to cause contortion
[1:14:21] whereas anguish may be a local pain as
[1:14:23] an author or gout but anguish and agony
[1:14:26] are nearly synonymous
[1:14:27] as pain of the mind it signifies any
[1:14:30] keen distress
[1:14:31] from sorrow remorse despair
[1:14:34] and kindred passions did get that
[1:14:39] they had their expectation of what
[1:14:42] deliverance would look like
[1:14:45] they thought deliverance was to have the
[1:14:47] biggest church
[1:14:49] they thought it was to have the biggest
[1:14:51] ministry maybe maybe they thought every
[1:14:53] all the unbelievers would convert over
[1:14:56] because oh
[1:14:57] we're in israel look at it look at how
[1:14:59] we we uh
[1:15:00] look at all the blessings that god has
[1:15:02] done to abraham isaac and jacob
[1:15:04] but it wasn't that way
[1:15:09] and you can see why your prophet typed
[1:15:11] this right in
[1:15:12] with the great tribulation period moving
[1:15:14] on in
[1:15:16] because that anguish of spirit says it's
[1:15:20] as
[1:15:20] pain of the mind and what it's
[1:15:23] distressed from
[1:15:24] sorrow remorse despair and kindred
[1:15:27] passions
[1:15:27] [Music]
[1:15:29] life was going the way that they didn't
[1:15:32] expect it to go
[1:15:35] they were expecting more they had
[1:15:38] expectations of what that would be
[1:15:41] they thought well when we came here it
[1:15:43] was nothing but blessings
[1:15:46] we had the newest land they still had it
[1:15:50] they were still in the best part of
[1:15:52] egypt
[1:15:54] they were still free of the plagues
[1:15:57] but they left the toil of slavery
[1:16:01] hallelujah right i mean we weren't free
[1:16:04] from this thing and you can't get away
[1:16:06] from it amen
[1:16:07] it wants to sin it wants to do
[1:16:09] everything contrary to the word
[1:16:11] it's something you must fight to keep
[1:16:13] under subjection amen
[1:16:16] right almost so many times like oh i can
[1:16:17] just get away from this thing
[1:16:23] and look the closer they got
[1:16:26] to the exodus
[1:16:29] you would have thought they would have
[1:16:30] got more excited because of all
[1:16:33] are the plagues falling in egypt
[1:16:36] but the scripture says they couldn't
[1:16:37] even receive the word of prosperity from
[1:16:40] the lord
[1:16:45] spurgeon talks through he says anguish
[1:16:47] of spirit whether it comes from god's
[1:16:49] hand
[1:16:51] in the form of personal affliction or
[1:16:53] from man's hand in the form of
[1:16:54] unjust oppression may become the
[1:16:57] occasion
[1:16:58] of neglecting the salvation of christ
[1:17:03] he's talking about anguish of spirit
[1:17:06] you just get so distressed oh i'm so
[1:17:08] stressed out i can't hardly handle this
[1:17:11] you think about this we're not we're not
[1:17:12] in these countries that have no food
[1:17:15] ethiopia some of these countries they
[1:17:16] only have any food locus ate their
[1:17:19] complete crop
[1:17:19] up we better get goshen because it might
[1:17:23] come our way next
[1:17:28] hallelujah
[1:17:30] he says beware of neglecting your
[1:17:33] spiritual
[1:17:34] state and interest while you are well
[1:17:38] in the expectation that distress when it
[1:17:40] comes will make you
[1:17:42] religious are you catching with ss
[1:17:46] right there's your desperations a lot of
[1:17:49] people
[1:17:49] wait for the emergency or wait for the
[1:17:53] challenge
[1:17:54] because they think that they'll just
[1:17:56] rise to the challenge
[1:18:01] even your prophecy he said don't wait
[1:18:02] for the emergency now is the time
[1:18:05] it's time to prepare now
[1:18:09] the freedom that we have it's time to
[1:18:11] watch
[1:18:12] to nourish the spirit of god in our
[1:18:14] midst amen
[1:18:15] and to get in operation get the gifts
[1:18:18] going get the holy ghost in our midst
[1:18:20] more than ever before
[1:18:21] and watch and get so spiritually on fire
[1:18:24] amen
[1:18:25] that when trouble comes we won't get
[1:18:27] anguished as spirit
[1:18:28] we won't get a burden from the trials
[1:18:30] we'll walk right through it with the
[1:18:32] shining of the token amen
[1:18:37] but notice because there's a really big
[1:18:39] truth to this
[1:18:41] we think that the stress is going to
[1:18:42] make us religious
[1:18:45] right right
[1:18:48] i've had people come come to church and
[1:18:50] they've got no money
[1:18:53] they ask for money for toilet paper
[1:18:57] because they don't have any toilet paper
[1:18:59] but they got a brand new phone
[1:19:02] they would rather pay their phone bill
[1:19:05] than buy toilet paper
[1:19:10] right
[1:19:15] they can't live without the phone
[1:19:18] but they can live without toilet paper
[1:19:23] everything is so set up
[1:19:27] that the people's minds have been so
[1:19:29] altered away from the things that matter
[1:19:31] that's right what matters right now is
[1:19:35] getting ready for the coming of the lord
[1:19:37] the people of needs have needs and what
[1:19:38] by god's grace we meet what we can
[1:19:40] but watch we find out that what it's so
[1:19:44] easy to misplace what the purpose of
[1:19:47] right now is
[1:19:50] we plant our potatoes absolutely
[1:19:53] but what we don't get so lukewarm
[1:19:56] that the lord would spew us from his
[1:19:58] mouth
[1:20:01] hallelujah we gotta stay at a condition
[1:20:04] that will what we see we see the
[1:20:06] judgments
[1:20:07] the judgments are sent so we can get
[1:20:10] ready for
[1:20:10] exodus amen that's one of the greatest
[1:20:14] challenges because
[1:20:15] people thought 60 years ago this thing
[1:20:17] was going to happen while
[1:20:18] while the seven things was here it
[1:20:21] didn't happen
[1:20:21] yes here we are 60 55 whatever 60 years
[1:20:25] it is later
[1:20:27] and you know what we've just dipped
[1:20:30] so far from what the expectation should
[1:20:33] be
[1:20:34] [Music]
[1:20:35] but what is it everything around you is
[1:20:37] trying to aid that
[1:20:39] it's trying to aid the transformation
[1:20:42] away from the true word
[1:20:44] and move it into what a lukewarm word
[1:20:48] a lukewarm state right right that
[1:20:51] accepts anything
[1:20:52] now notice there's no truth in nature
[1:20:55] more certain
[1:20:56] than this that the time of health and
[1:20:58] happiness is the best time for cleaning
[1:21:01] the christ
[1:21:01] and making our calling and election sure
[1:21:05] like that then it could be best done if
[1:21:08] men would then do it
[1:21:10] right
[1:21:13] beware unless you let you be letting the
[1:21:15] best time slip past
[1:21:17] and the worst time draw on while you are
[1:21:20] not saved
[1:21:21] it is true that god sovereign mercy
[1:21:23] often uses affliction to bring us to
[1:21:24] christ
[1:21:25] but he does so because we would not come
[1:21:28] to christ
[1:21:29] at all earlier and better time the mind
[1:21:32] maybe
[1:21:32] may be heavenly without sore bondage and
[1:21:34] earthly with it
[1:21:37] i love the man some phenomenal
[1:21:41] phenomenal thinkers and and spirit-led
[1:21:43] men
[1:21:44] but notice we find that what now is the
[1:21:47] day of salvation today it is amen
[1:21:50] today's the way the time to get ready
[1:21:56] when they tell you that there's a great
[1:21:57] reset and a new normal
[1:22:00] that should tell you that you need a
[1:22:01] reset and a new normal
[1:22:04] but those two are contrary same thing
[1:22:07] with their idea
[1:22:08] and what the bible's idea are two
[1:22:10] separate things amen
[1:22:12] we're looking for a great recess reset
[1:22:14] amen and
[1:22:16] that's that's that rain paulie pouring
[1:22:18] down on the week amen
[1:22:21] the bible says cry out unto the lord in
[1:22:24] the time
[1:22:24] of the latter rain amen
[1:22:28] they're talking about uh a one world
[1:22:30] order we're talking about getting the
[1:22:32] holy ghost
[1:22:33] in what in such a measure we can get out
[1:22:36] of this earth amen
[1:22:40] hallelujah
[1:22:44] let's look at let's look at moses again
[1:22:47] i get this right yep next next verse
[1:22:51] exodus 6 10
[1:22:52] and the lord spake unto moses saying
[1:22:55] so there they were they couldn't even it
[1:22:57] was so hard to receive the word
[1:22:59] did it mean they weren't israel no no
[1:23:02] but it was the challenges that they had
[1:23:05] to face
[1:23:06] in the conditions of the exodus yes
[1:23:11] right it's what it is yes but you know
[1:23:14] what
[1:23:14] there's still a difference of being in
[1:23:15] goshen and being in egypt
[1:23:18] that's what you've got to see right
[1:23:22] don't get jealous of the sons of men
[1:23:23] when they're rich and they got all this
[1:23:25] stuff and
[1:23:25] don't go get jealous of that you look at
[1:23:28] your
[1:23:28] spiritual condition amen ephesians said
[1:23:32] you'd be blessed with all spiritual
[1:23:34] blessings
[1:23:35] in heavenly places amen
[1:23:39] now's not the time to to see how rich
[1:23:42] you can get
[1:23:43] it's time to see how spiritually rich
[1:23:44] you can get
[1:23:48] exodus 6 10 and lord speak unto moses
[1:23:50] saying go in speak unto the pharaoh king
[1:23:52] of egypt that he let the children of
[1:23:54] israel go
[1:23:55] out of his land and moses spake before
[1:23:58] lord saying
[1:23:59] behold the children of israel have not
[1:24:00] hearkened unto me
[1:24:02] how then shall pharaoh hear me who am
[1:24:05] of uncircumcised lips
[1:24:09] see this just wasn't hard for the the
[1:24:11] children of israel
[1:24:14] this season was so challenging now
[1:24:17] notice
[1:24:18] this is his thoughts he's expressing his
[1:24:20] thoughts to god
[1:24:23] he said not even i mean sometimes
[1:24:25] pastors can get like that
[1:24:28] right
[1:24:31] right oh the holy ghost told me to
[1:24:33] preach after the church and they and
[1:24:34] they just
[1:24:35] they didn't even receive it right
[1:24:38] how's the unbeliever gonna hear my
[1:24:39] church when you hear it
[1:24:41] you know not uh it's not us you know
[1:24:44] certain churches out there somewhere
[1:24:48] so notice he even got into a
[1:24:52] anguish of spirit himself
[1:25:00] and he's talking to god he's talking to
[1:25:03] god
[1:25:04] i was like oh i'm talking to god i would
[1:25:06] never have one problem in my life
[1:25:09] right it's so easy to think that way oh
[1:25:12] if i was tied in like a problem oh glory
[1:25:13] to god
[1:25:16] no you wouldn't right remember he even
[1:25:19] said it he said
[1:25:19] he said he said he said a lot of people
[1:25:22] envy this type of a position but you
[1:25:23] don't realize
[1:25:24] the challenges that go with it
[1:25:26] [Applause]
[1:25:28] can you imagine all these people need
[1:25:29] healing in you and god will tell you go
[1:25:31] here you feel like to go this way and
[1:25:32] that person dies
[1:25:34] and then these people blame you these
[1:25:36] people are calling you a false prophet
[1:25:37] these people are bringing false
[1:25:39] prophecies that your that your family is
[1:25:40] going to die and you're going to die
[1:25:42] and all these things like that
[1:25:45] every hindrance imaginable thrown right
[1:25:48] in his face
[1:25:51] what do you think he had yes sir
[1:25:55] pharaoh's laughing in his face pharaoh's
[1:25:58] saying okay i'll let the people go
[1:26:00] and so he stops the plague and next day
[1:26:02] again they won't let nobody go
[1:26:05] happen time and time again
[1:26:09] it was a wearing out type of season
[1:26:14] that's why the bible says in isaiah 40
[1:26:18] 30
[1:26:18] they that way upon the lord shall
[1:26:22] renew their strength they shall rise
[1:26:25] up with the strength as eagles amen why
[1:26:28] did those eagles need to renew their
[1:26:30] strengths
[1:26:31] why is an eagle type of
[1:26:34] yes today it's speaking to the eagle age
[1:26:38] right now saying only it spoke to all
[1:26:40] the ages but this one particular because
[1:26:42] this is the eagle age
[1:26:44] oh i wish i had time to go there because
[1:26:47] you find out
[1:26:49] that this is the age because the the
[1:26:50] special thing about that eagle
[1:26:52] is is upon renewal it can soar back in
[1:26:54] the skies
[1:26:55] and fly above all the trials of the
[1:26:57] earth
[1:27:00] it can go so high that it can go above
[1:27:02] the storm
[1:27:03] yes hallelujah
[1:27:07] i'm telling you this this is a in in a
[1:27:10] very interesting time brother sister
[1:27:12] the eagle populations are really rising
[1:27:15] i just seen it the other day
[1:27:17] i seen an eagle on a dead carcass on the
[1:27:18] road
[1:27:21] and remember eagles are supposed to only
[1:27:23] eat living things that's right
[1:27:25] the fresh meat yes
[1:27:29] why is that going on i i told him i told
[1:27:32] the guy at work
[1:27:32] and he said oh you said i live up by oak
[1:27:34] harbor where there's a ton of eagles he
[1:27:35] said
[1:27:36] they do all there too
[1:27:39] everybody's looking for an easy what an
[1:27:42] easy meal
[1:27:51] can't we just have it the easy way it's
[1:27:52] too hard to hunt all these things
[1:27:54] [Music]
[1:27:56] it's too hard to hunt for a revelation
[1:27:57] it's too hard to hunt for the word of
[1:27:59] god amen it's too hard to hunt until
[1:28:02] god gives you the answer
[1:28:05] oh i'll just i'll just settle for this
[1:28:07] dead carrying over here
[1:28:12] true
[1:28:16] but the fact still remains eagles they
[1:28:19] that wait on the lord shall renew their
[1:28:20] strength
[1:28:22] but you see that is one of the greatest
[1:28:24] mistakes that we miss and you know your
[1:28:25] prophet said this
[1:28:26] he said we don't wait on god enough
[1:28:29] i am guilty to god help me
[1:28:33] because communion is not one-sided yes
[1:28:37] when we have set our prayers it doesn't
[1:28:39] matter how long that prayers you
[1:28:40] some of us you can talk god for five
[1:28:42] hours but you know if the pill is
[1:28:44] sitting there you could probably talk to
[1:28:44] the pillar for five hours
[1:28:47] right
[1:28:53] but what am i saying
[1:28:57] it's not prayer is not the expectation
[1:28:59] that you're just going to say something
[1:29:00] to somebody
[1:29:03] because prayer is communion you're
[1:29:05] praying to god
[1:29:07] you're bringing worthy and and glory
[1:29:10] unto his name
[1:29:10] unto unto him in an intimate way
[1:29:14] and then you expect just like you come
[1:29:15] to the house of god you're expecting the
[1:29:17] holy ghost to speak to you
[1:29:21] that's what we're missing yes sir and
[1:29:22] remember here's voice 58 what your
[1:29:24] prophet said
[1:29:25] i'm just going to inspiration now so
[1:29:26] this must be needed
[1:29:29] but he said many people will pray but
[1:29:31] they don't pray long enough
[1:29:32] to a place where they have what where
[1:29:35] all the voices have got aside
[1:29:37] and there's nothing but faith to hear
[1:29:39] from god let's paraphrase
[1:29:41] but that's what it says
[1:29:45] see what it is when you're actually
[1:29:47] praying you're praying
[1:29:48] until the voices in your head
[1:29:52] leave you know the issue with the
[1:29:54] neurotic time
[1:29:58] you know the real issue with a neurotic
[1:29:59] time is or if or if you're near a
[1:30:00] traumatic state
[1:30:03] right you've got you've got big problems
[1:30:04] in your life i find as a pastor even
[1:30:07] dealing with things it is
[1:30:08] harder i thought it'd be easier to pray
[1:30:10] when when when all hell is loosed on you
[1:30:12] it's not you'd think it'd be easy to
[1:30:16] pray when it's loosed on you like that
[1:30:18] it's not it's ten times harder because
[1:30:20] you start talking to god and the next
[1:30:22] thing oh i could do with it this way
[1:30:23] well i could do it this way i could do
[1:30:24] that way and i could do this
[1:30:25] and then think oh what if what if what
[1:30:26] if you got all these things going around
[1:30:28] your mind
[1:30:31] it gets that much harder to wait on god
[1:30:33] because then when you go to wait on god
[1:30:35] your mind's still trying to run right
[1:30:38] you see how we have to
[1:30:39] separate ourselves from that type of a
[1:30:43] mindset
[1:30:44] and move into the position that we can
[1:30:46] get a perfect faith
[1:30:48] that god wants to speak to us
[1:30:53] remember your prophet said he said he
[1:30:54] said he might not speak you today it'll
[1:30:56] speak to you tomorrow
[1:30:57] it may not be tomorrow it may be next
[1:30:59] week but you're at what constantly in
[1:31:00] the expectation
[1:31:02] that you move into that personal walk
[1:31:03] with god where he can lead you in a
[1:31:05] greater way in his perfect will
[1:31:07] amen we know his word is his will
[1:31:11] that's easy but what about finding the
[1:31:13] mystery of his will for you
[1:31:15] yes sir yes sir hallelujah
[1:31:21] that's for somebody praise god
[1:31:24] let's go to the next quote perseverance
[1:31:28] you fight every inch of the way
[1:31:33] god down in egypt give palestine to the
[1:31:35] jews
[1:31:36] but they fought every inch of the way
[1:31:38] god told joshua every everywhere the
[1:31:39] souls of your feet rest that have i
[1:31:41] given you
[1:31:42] footsteps mean victory possession just
[1:31:44] as far as you can climb into the kingdom
[1:31:46] of god
[1:31:46] if you just want to climb a little peace
[1:31:49] and say well i believe i may not have to
[1:31:51] go to hell
[1:31:52] but i believe that i'll be saved in the
[1:31:53] end if i join church you ain't got much
[1:31:55] ground yet
[1:31:57] but every promise in the bible is yours
[1:32:00] but you'll have to fight
[1:32:01] every devil guard away from it
[1:32:04] with a two-edged sword and claim it for
[1:32:06] yourself be persistent
[1:32:08] walking right into it
[1:32:13] what do you think goshen was sure they
[1:32:16] missed those plagues like that
[1:32:18] but they had to fight every inch of the
[1:32:19] way
[1:32:21] the spiritual oppression was so great
[1:32:24] that it seemed like what seemed like
[1:32:27] they'd never get out of it
[1:32:29] oh god when when are you going to do
[1:32:31] this for me oh god when are you going to
[1:32:32] get that
[1:32:34] right that's some of the greatest
[1:32:36] challenges
[1:32:37] right many of us here we've prayed and
[1:32:39] we've been prayed for several times for
[1:32:40] maybe even the same thing
[1:32:44] and after a while you just sit back and
[1:32:45] say well i just accept it and
[1:32:47] you start getting down about you say god
[1:32:49] why aren't you answering me
[1:32:51] i love because i searched that out years
[1:32:52] ago and i found the prophecy he said you
[1:32:54] might have been up here six
[1:32:55] six times or seven times something like
[1:32:56] that and he said he said but today's
[1:32:57] your day
[1:33:03] that's where we gotta be amen hallelujah
[1:33:06] you're crying out for a healing for the
[1:33:08] holy ghost you sit right there and say
[1:33:10] you know what i didn't get anything
[1:33:12] there but i'm right here and i still
[1:33:14] believe it amen
[1:33:18] hallelujah next just got a few more
[1:33:21] we're almost done
[1:33:22] honestly we're almost done this time 61
[1:33:25] revelations chapter 5.
[1:33:26] he says now satan will constantly punch
[1:33:28] at you until you're finished here on
[1:33:30] earth
[1:33:31] just remember that you'll never have a
[1:33:33] time
[1:33:34] but what there's a punching going on all
[1:33:36] the time
[1:33:38] because you're in a battle did you ask
[1:33:40] to come to christ to go to a picnic
[1:33:43] see we want goshen why should be able to
[1:33:47] be rich and not be in debt and not have
[1:33:49] any problems
[1:33:50] i should have an easy life i'm in the
[1:33:51] bride
[1:33:53] what kind of bride is that
[1:33:57] the scripture says to him that
[1:33:58] overcometh will i give all and to
[1:34:00] inherit all things
[1:34:02] right good brother i've been on the
[1:34:06] field for 31 years and i fought every
[1:34:08] inch of the way that's right
[1:34:09] israel to fight every inch of the way
[1:34:11] palestine was given to them but they had
[1:34:12] to fight every inch of the way to get it
[1:34:17] are you an every inch fighter yes hey
[1:34:20] man
[1:34:21] but the thing to do is to recognize what
[1:34:24] state are you in
[1:34:26] see you have to remember that no matter
[1:34:28] what comes your way
[1:34:29] and what the toil is you're in goshen
[1:34:33] you're not in egypt yes right i think
[1:34:36] proverbs 3 talked about
[1:34:37] i talk about don't fear what happens to
[1:34:39] the sons of men
[1:34:42] don't even fear don't even worry about
[1:34:43] what comes to them right
[1:34:47] because you're different amen amen
[1:34:50] [Music]
[1:34:51] you're still gonna have challenges but
[1:34:54] you have what
[1:34:55] you have a predestinated life that god
[1:34:57] gave you
[1:34:59] amen next scripture
[1:35:03] so the good part to all this is all that
[1:35:05] anguish is spirit
[1:35:07] all those challenges that they have
[1:35:10] exodus 11 1
[1:35:13] and the lord said unto moses yet will i
[1:35:16] bring
[1:35:16] one plague more upon pharaoh
[1:35:20] and upon egypt afterwards he will let
[1:35:24] you go
[1:35:24] hence when he shall let you
[1:35:28] go he shall surely thrust you out
[1:35:32] hence all together speak now in the ears
[1:35:36] of the people
[1:35:37] and let every man borrow of his neighbor
[1:35:39] and every woman of her neighbor
[1:35:41] jewels of silver and jewels of gold and
[1:35:43] the lord
[1:35:44] gave the people favor in the sight of
[1:35:48] the egyptians
[1:35:49] moreover the man moses was very great in
[1:35:52] the land of egypt in the sight of
[1:35:53] pharaoh's servants and in the sight of
[1:35:55] the people
[1:35:57] they might have been dealing with the
[1:35:58] toils they might have been suffering in
[1:36:00] that way
[1:36:01] but notice god came in the season
[1:36:04] of the final showdown
[1:36:09] now notice this did the people do it
[1:36:12] absolutely the scripture says they
[1:36:14] spoiled the egyptians
[1:36:16] [Laughter]
[1:36:19] hallelujah you couldn't get away from
[1:36:22] the blessing of god
[1:36:25] but god had to get them ready for the
[1:36:27] exodus
[1:36:30] so there was that trial period to say
[1:36:33] who's going to stay
[1:36:34] who's going to believe it has enough
[1:36:38] mental fortitude by the holy ghost
[1:36:40] to withstand the challenges of this hour
[1:36:43] hallelujah
[1:36:44] right that's what i'm saying that quote
[1:36:46] can overcome he said the demons in this
[1:36:47] hour
[1:36:48] are many times harder to fight
[1:36:51] they're hard to fight absolutely
[1:36:54] because they'll take you this way then
[1:36:56] they'll take you that way the best thing
[1:36:58] to do is just sit there right with the
[1:36:59] promise of god
[1:37:00] and saying god has already revealed it
[1:37:01] amen i believe
[1:37:03] that there's going to be a bride she's
[1:37:05] going to be pure and spotless
[1:37:07] amen god called me to it i'm staying in
[1:37:10] my post
[1:37:11] i'm going to stick with this rapture and
[1:37:13] i'm going to make it amen
[1:37:19] so it all comes to an end right
[1:37:23] it's the same way with the seven seal
[1:37:25] don't worry everything's going to happen
[1:37:27] just the way it's supposed to happen
[1:37:29] hey man remember that's why that's why
[1:37:31] your prop said numerous times he said
[1:37:34] don't fear or worry about it any of it
[1:37:38] he said you just go on and live a good
[1:37:40] christian life
[1:37:42] and the lord will take care of the rest
[1:37:47] because what is that that's living in
[1:37:50] goshen
[1:37:51] that's living where you're free amen
[1:37:53] that's living in a place that you don't
[1:37:55] have to worry about tomorrow
[1:37:57] she said take no thought for tomorrow if
[1:38:00] god cares for the sparrows
[1:38:02] how much more does he care about you
[1:38:05] amen
[1:38:07] all right almost done so what do we find
[1:38:11] come the less plague the death angel
[1:38:14] that says 12 11.
[1:38:15] and thus shall you eat it with your
[1:38:16] loins girded your shoes on your feet
[1:38:19] your staff in your hand and you shall
[1:38:21] eat it in haste it is the lord's
[1:38:22] passover
[1:38:23] for i'll pass the land of egypt this
[1:38:25] night and will smite all the firstborn
[1:38:27] in the land of egypt both man and beast
[1:38:29] and against all the gods of egypt i will
[1:38:32] execute judgment
[1:38:33] i am the lord and the blood shall be to
[1:38:36] you for a token upon the houses where
[1:38:39] you are ye are and when i see the blood
[1:38:41] i will pass over you
[1:38:42] and the plague shall not be upon you to
[1:38:44] destroy you
[1:38:46] when i smite the land of egypt see the
[1:38:49] place not for you
[1:38:51] it's not for you but what is it
[1:38:54] you have to put the blood on the
[1:38:56] doorpost and the lentils amen amen
[1:38:59] you have to apply the blood yes the
[1:39:02] token
[1:39:02] is the holy ghost and you have to get
[1:39:04] behind
[1:39:06] that that door with the blood on it
[1:39:09] right
[1:39:11] and this day shall be unto you for a
[1:39:13] memorial
[1:39:14] and you shall keep it a feast to the
[1:39:16] lord throughout your generations you
[1:39:17] shall keep it
[1:39:18] a feast by ordinance forever god did
[1:39:20] never want them to forget about it
[1:39:23] aren't you glad that they wrote about it
[1:39:24] because it tells you
[1:39:26] that you know what just get the token
[1:39:29] and be ready to go
[1:39:30] in the time of exodus amen now's the
[1:39:33] time for the token
[1:39:35] now's the time to believe it now's the
[1:39:37] time to what
[1:39:38] just like in a baby eel she's got to
[1:39:40] flutter her wings but she's going to
[1:39:42] stay right there and keep doing it until
[1:39:44] she can fly amen
[1:39:47] that's what we got to do so notice
[1:39:51] in closing token 63
[1:39:54] i'm trying to press upon your minds
[1:39:56] friend that the hour has struck and
[1:39:58] something has got to be done by it
[1:40:00] we must do something it's either in or
[1:40:03] out
[1:40:04] that's all the hour has come where the
[1:40:06] token must be there
[1:40:08] if there's ever this church ever expects
[1:40:10] to remain
[1:40:12] alive until jesus christ comes the token
[1:40:15] will have to be there
[1:40:16] be here that's all if death don't
[1:40:20] it'll take the death mark and soon it's
[1:40:23] in congress right now the big machine
[1:40:24] set up to make all churches come into
[1:40:26] that federation of churches
[1:40:27] and you better really have the token
[1:40:30] shining
[1:40:31] but the hour is here for the exodus
[1:40:34] did you get that
[1:40:38] if you ever expect to make it to the
[1:40:40] coming of the lord
[1:40:42] you better have the token amen
[1:40:45] if you want to be those and first leslie
[1:40:47] phones before it says to them that are
[1:40:49] alive and remain
[1:40:51] we shall be caught up to meet him in the
[1:40:53] air
[1:40:55] notice you better really have the token
[1:40:58] shining
[1:41:00] see them see what i'm saying i just told
[1:41:01] this to the church the other day
[1:41:04] that when you look at the whole scenario
[1:41:06] of jesus christ the word
[1:41:08] and i said i preach this because this is
[1:41:09] also challenging for me
[1:41:12] but everything that's going on around
[1:41:14] you right now
[1:41:17] i told the church of course
[1:41:20] those things will make you nervous
[1:41:23] right yes right yeah but we have that we
[1:41:26] have that
[1:41:27] even the one fellow there he's he's
[1:41:29] talking he had all these dreams about
[1:41:31] things that were going to happen and by
[1:41:32] november and in november and all these
[1:41:34] things like that
[1:41:35] a lot of it didn't happen but they even
[1:41:38] even when they first showed it to me
[1:41:39] somebody showed it to me saying you got
[1:41:40] to check this out it's going to happen
[1:41:41] over here
[1:41:42] we're going to have you in and
[1:41:46] and i just listened and one thing he
[1:41:48] said
[1:41:50] he said he said why why listen to 40
[1:41:52] news
[1:41:53] channels a day i look at 40 news
[1:41:55] channels a day or something like that
[1:41:57] and i'm like
[1:42:01] the alarm was going off because
[1:42:04] if we have scriptural understanding we
[1:42:06] know how dreams work
[1:42:09] dreams can come from god absolutely
[1:42:12] they're a gift of god
[1:42:14] but the bible also says that dreams come
[1:42:16] from a man of business
[1:42:19] if all you do is feed yourself with all
[1:42:22] the neurotic stuff that's going on
[1:42:24] how are you not going to be neurotic
[1:42:28] and also dream about neurotic things
[1:42:32] you see what i'm saying so we got to
[1:42:35] watch that
[1:42:39] i'm telling you i just had to back up
[1:42:42] who's gonna be president i don't know i
[1:42:43] don't know strive me nuts
[1:42:46] we're living in a uh not just an
[1:42:47] unprecedented time in american history
[1:42:49] we're living in an unprecedented time
[1:42:50] of corruption going un unprosecuted
[1:42:56] so what do we do about it you running
[1:43:00] for mayor next month
[1:43:04] is that how we're going to do it right
[1:43:09] talked to somebody's talking to us one
[1:43:10] time they said we know how we're gonna
[1:43:11] do it we're gonna get it one baby at a
[1:43:12] time
[1:43:14] we have big giant families well populate
[1:43:16] them
[1:43:17] huh so season of the exodus
[1:43:21] you see what i'm saying but but it's
[1:43:22] easy because your mind just runs to all
[1:43:25] these places
[1:43:27] right
[1:43:32] don't think things don't come to your
[1:43:33] mind right like i bet i can fix this
[1:43:38] i do this and i do that that net why
[1:43:41] don't you try this
[1:43:46] why don't we try just to get closer to
[1:43:48] jesus christ amen amen
[1:43:52] because he said these times would be
[1:43:53] here
[1:43:55] i hope this helps everyone
[1:43:59] i know i know the church i'm in i even
[1:44:01] know myself
[1:44:04] it can be so easy to get caught up in
[1:44:06] all this stuff
[1:44:10] but you see what you're doing
[1:44:13] trump says he's a christian biden says
[1:44:14] he's a christian
[1:44:16] but look at the fruit quite a starting
[1:44:20] point
[1:44:22] maybe it should be a stopping point
[1:44:24] that's why brother ramsay said i'm
[1:44:25] voting for jesus christ
[1:44:29] not saying that we i'm not saying that
[1:44:30] we don't want uh we don't want
[1:44:33] godly things to prosper in our country
[1:44:38] but if all these things are building up
[1:44:39] why is it happening
[1:44:42] it's happening to get us out of our
[1:44:45] normal condition
[1:44:47] and to get us to a place that we start
[1:44:49] what realizing that we need to make more
[1:44:52] sacrifice in order to get right with god
[1:44:58] because that's why these things come
[1:44:59] remember you still have your freedom
[1:45:01] right now
[1:45:03] don't wait till anguish anguish of
[1:45:04] spirit
[1:45:06] and the bondage of slavery comes in even
[1:45:08] harder
[1:45:11] if you see it it's obvious either way
[1:45:13] you go
[1:45:14] there's no place for you in there
[1:45:20] because you're either going to be part
[1:45:21] of the system or you're going to lose
[1:45:23] freedom or religion either way you're
[1:45:24] going to do it
[1:45:26] right so where's the place for you hey
[1:45:30] did you see that cloud up there
[1:45:34] all right the only thing you can look
[1:45:35] for is to look up for your jump to draw
[1:45:37] 9.
[1:45:39] you see it right let's stand
[1:45:45] little botched up sermon i pray that was
[1:45:47] all right but i wanted you to understand
[1:45:49] that
[1:45:49] that when you look at where we're at all
[1:45:52] these things type in just perfect
[1:45:55] they say it's so easy for for someone to
[1:45:57] look at someone going through a great
[1:45:58] trial
[1:45:59] and they say oh they're probably just
[1:46:01] backslid and wicked and blah blah blah
[1:46:03] blah blah
[1:46:05] ain't no blah blah with that
[1:46:08] right here if you're really serving god
[1:46:11] you're going to fight every inch
[1:46:13] amen i would be more worried if you have
[1:46:15] no challenges at all
[1:46:19] right right just because just because
[1:46:22] they say they believe and they gotta
[1:46:23] and they got a porsche that don't mean
[1:46:25] anything
[1:46:26] and they're best buddies with a big
[1:46:28] preacher or whoever it is
[1:46:30] that don't mean nothing
[1:46:33] the only thing that means something
[1:46:36] is if you know you have the baptism of
[1:46:38] the holy ghost that's right
[1:46:40] and you're watching the fruit of what
[1:46:43] you are
[1:46:44] being likened to mourn to christ that's
[1:46:46] right
[1:46:47] right i hope you love him
[1:46:51] it's a very simple sermon brother sister
[1:46:53] like i said i come here i try to get
[1:46:55] things right with the word
[1:46:56] i had a lot of things to preach i didn't
[1:46:58] know what to preach and uh this is where
[1:47:00] the lord kind of brought me
[1:47:01] but i want you to see so you could be
[1:47:05] happy where you're at
[1:47:07] you'll be absolutely happy with whatever
[1:47:09] challenge or trial you got in your life
[1:47:10] thank god for it
[1:47:12] be happy about it because this is all to
[1:47:14] test you
[1:47:16] it's seeing what you're going to do
[1:47:19] as we said before as for me in my house
[1:47:21] we shall follow the lord
[1:47:23] we're going to serve the lord that's
[1:47:25] right amen
[1:47:27] have you decided to follow jesus there's
[1:47:29] no turning back
[1:47:31] there's no turning back don't let the
[1:47:34] greatest battle ever fought overcome you
[1:47:38] it's not you you're looking what
[1:47:41] you're looking at your sacrifice let the
[1:47:43] nature of god bring
[1:47:46] basically the the emphasis of christ in
[1:47:49] you
[1:47:50] because that's what will come the more
[1:47:52] you look at your sacrifice the more you
[1:47:53] trust god the more you give up to god
[1:47:55] having faith in him it will bring change
[1:47:58] in your life that's right
[1:48:00] is there any witnesses that believe that
[1:48:02] i've seen that in your own life
[1:48:04] i've seen some of my greatest trials
[1:48:05] brother sister and and i feel so far
[1:48:08] away from god and it's some of the
[1:48:09] greatest character i've received
[1:48:11] yes sir some of that stuff could be 10
[1:48:13] years old still hurts
[1:48:15] but you know i'm so glad i got it
[1:48:18] because it taught me love it taught me
[1:48:21] grace
[1:48:23] and one thing you know because you can
[1:48:25] always point and say well that person
[1:48:26] this and that person
[1:48:28] but you know what what if you look at
[1:48:29] the mirror of the word of who you are
[1:48:32] you see what i'm saying what if you look
[1:48:33] at yourself compared to what jesus
[1:48:34] christ did for you
[1:48:37] right you say beautiful
[1:48:41] you should always have compassion don't
[1:48:43] ever give up on anybody
[1:48:45] the holy spirit don't tell you then you
[1:48:46] have hope and you trust that god will
[1:48:48] help people
[1:48:51] went down the ark and i heard ken ham
[1:48:54] stated as on the
[1:48:55] whatever radio or something like that
[1:48:57] but but somebody said i'm praying for my
[1:48:59] relatives
[1:49:00] can you keep my relatives in prayer ken
[1:49:03] ham said he said this it got
[1:49:04] stuck out in my head he said he said
[1:49:06] well if you believe the bible he said
[1:49:08] everybody's your relative
[1:49:14] he said we all came from noah at this
[1:49:16] point in time
[1:49:19] now we know the two seed lines but
[1:49:20] understand what we're saying
[1:49:23] that's your fellow man they're made in
[1:49:24] the image and likeness of god
[1:49:26] let god do the separating and you you do
[1:49:29] your best to put them in there until god
[1:49:30] does otherwise amen
[1:49:32] you love lord amen let's bow our heads
[1:49:36] amen
[1:49:38] maybe tonight you're saying oh god this
[1:49:41] sermon was
[1:49:42] based just to give you a little relief
[1:49:44] of mind that
[1:49:45] if you're going through stresses if
[1:49:46] you're going through challenges
[1:49:49] that's all right because that's what
[1:49:51] living in goshen is
[1:49:53] it's not the easy life it's not the
[1:49:55] laodicean life
[1:49:57] but it's a time of self-sacrifice and
[1:50:00] trusting god in his promise and his
[1:50:02] prophecy
[1:50:03] as the time is getting close there's a
[1:50:06] rain coming

[1:50:49] drawing near
[1:50:51] to the ring of blessings
