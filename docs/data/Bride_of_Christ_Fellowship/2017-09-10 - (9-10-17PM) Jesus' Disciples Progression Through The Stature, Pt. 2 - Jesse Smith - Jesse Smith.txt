[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] let's tend to read a scripture here then we'll just do the Bob City race before let's go to Acts chapter 1 where the three first five of course he's a red letter words important words here my wife might be trying to hear so use the mic here God let's go the bank god bless you see it god bless you sir that's uh x1 first fine I just want to read this verse I believe it's very important because it shows how even after Jesus died and resurrected he was pointing the disciples to the baptism of the Holy Ghost to power for service so let's look at that here let's look at verse five everybody god that's Rita on three one two three four John truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days father we gettin thank you for the songs the prayers Lord you know you hear our prayers thank you for hearing our prayers thank you for the song that my brother setting or wouldn't encourage it or whatever what a mighty song or dance for each behind then give us the faith for rapturing power when we know according to your word it's already in a slore toddler were formed again so father leave each and every heart be born again Lord Jesus bring each and every person to a new birth Lord God so the rapture is already inside of them because the seed of God is inside their souls Lord God we thank you your love and mercy bless us now as we teach your word Jesus Christ me every set even may be sees it alright so now I'm going to switch over I'm just going to put that picture but I modified it a little bit by about three works of grace the children did a good job reading last weekend yeah so I just want to put that one up there I kind of simplified a little bit we've been going through Jesus's disciples and how they had to go through sanctification or to be born again with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we're showing examples of sanctification in the Gospels now program said when Peter went up the Pentecost he got on the full armor of God so that's why I place that up there to remember that remember that remember that once Peter God the Holy Ghost now he had the full armor of God on and then program set up you're born again you have the fruits in the spirit I found another quote about that the church age book the Prophet taught that as well the fruits of the spirit come after baptism with the Holy Ghost so so the children can see that because for justification getting baptized sanctification and cleaned out and adding all these strengths into our lives then you get borned again with the love of God and then at that moment you have the armor of God and then in time you start bearing fruits of the spirit and that's also called your adoption or placing I can place you in the body wherever he wants you to be so it's that exact okay towards that simplified a little bit I think last week I had all that all the armor pieces listed up here plus all the fruits of the spirit so that was a lot of room up there I thought I'd simplify that so we went through a lot of examples and even Wednesday we did a lot of examples so I'll just briefly review so Jesus you know on the earth administered for three and a half years his disciples walked with him for three and half years it was God in the flesh but the disciples were never born again that's why he breathed on them after the resurrections they received the Holy Ghost received the Holy Ghost and then last week we looked at faith we look at how Jesus prayed for Peter that his face wouldn't fail and of course all the disciples as well is remember they all beat their chests and said we all die with you right this man-made virtue this man made his testosterone but they never never really had the true virtue of God to stay there till death so we spent time on faith and then we spent time on virtue they also all disciples scatter to Jesus the rest praying they couldn't prayed watch for one hour they never hurt you to watch for one hour it's good even pray one hour then they didn't have to hurt you to cast out the demon out of the child but Jesus said you have to be praying and fasting to fast out I'm sorry to cast out a deaf and dumb spirit so that's virtue and that comes through prayer and fasting and then we saw modern examples like men that can hold offices in the church and then flirt with women or costs or all kinds of evil things and a woman that says she believes the message but that it should wear pants to work or school or something like that don't have the virtue to really live the life out in public alright we skipped over now so we're new knowledge today there's a lot of knowledge examples the disciples that have the knowledge or understanding and then will be patience and godliness on Wednesday night went over all the probably kindest examples right arguing about who's the greatest with your brothers forgiving your brother right brotherly kindness gotta forgive they said crease our faith how can I forgive so-and-so somebody at seven times in one day letting brothers have ministries outside of your ministry that's brotherly kindness the disciples refused children to come to Christ that they were being kind in their sisters right the sister just wanted prayer for their children and they couldn't be kind enough to let the sisters come to Jesus and bring their children to Jesus and then the cycles were filled with sore displeasure would James and John's mother came and said King James and John sit on the right hand and left hand so they really like a lot of brother kindness can every see that they always were upset sometimes they got upset in our Gita who was greater got upset with each other didn't have the love of God like we should have so let's go over a lot of the knowledge examples and then we try to close with where the disciples so let's go up there now all right let's go in the scripture let's go to John chapter 2 verse 18 John 2:18 everybody okay with using the mic again to read you don't have to occasion how do you feel sir you feel like okay reading with the mic or done liddie once it passes over if you feel comfortable you can do that John 2:18 st. John 2:18 the first example which I thought was a pretty powerful example as I went through the scriptures did some reading was the disciples didn't understand Jesus when he said you destroy this temple I'll raise it up in three days I did not understand this I think it's pretty striking to see what is actually said about this alright so Lydia do you want to read 18 verse 20 says then said the Jews forty in six years was this temple one building and wilt thou rear it up in three days verse 21 but he spake of the temple of his body look at this next Scripture this is this is what I thought was so powerful when therefore he was risen from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them and they believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had said now why is that striking and striking because at Jesus's trial at the high priests house before he was crucified remember they brought in false witnesses against Jesus and what did they say he was guilty of blasphemy by saying he would raise up the temple in three days so isn't it striking that Jesus's own disciples didn't remember even preach this until after the rest but yet his enemies understood this as far as they have been remembered it so his enemies remember it his disciples did not remember it until after the resurrection I imagined Peter was out there he was already lacking virtue and here he clearly lacked knowledge because uh one of those false witnesses would raised up and said oh you're your master said this for that and Peter might have shrugged his shoulders and said I don't remember that I don't you remember because the Bible said he didn't remember - after the resurrection so there's a good example of not having the knowledge like you would expect them to have about the prophecies okay so I thought that was pretty striking to see then okay so let's go the next one let's go to Matthew 16 let's go to Matthew chapter 16 they didn't understand the miracles of the bread and the fishes now we can look back now we can see all I can see the understanding behind these miracles but that's only because you know we're after the fact we're not living in those days remember what we said last year if we would have been alive in those days we would have the same thing Peter did right we would have made the same mistakes because we're all human and we all need a Savior so we're not we're not putting the disciples any lower than ourselves in fact we should always put them way above us right we should humble ourselves but just showing how they needed to grow in God right they needed to be sanctified so Matthew 16 1 there's a lot of reading in here you know just because there's so many I think I'll just talk about a few of these let's go to verse 6 now remember in verses 1 to 5 they were sailing across looks like a body of water and they they forgot that take bread along with them then verse 5 it says that they'd forgotten to take bread ok now verse 6 and then jesus said to them take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees and the reason among themselves saying is because we have taken no breath which when Jesus perceived he said them o ye of little faith why reason ye among yourselves because she had brought no bread do you not yet understand mmm acknowledges understand do not yet understand neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many baskets you took up neither the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many baskets you took up how is it that you do not understand that I speak it not to you concerning bread that ye should beware of the leaven of the pharisees and the sadducees then under then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and the Sadducees all right so see they they didn't understand which bread was most important they thought all he's reminding us we didn't bring the natural bread but what did they find out what bread was more important than that regret me spiritual bread now that might seem so easy to us but we're living after the fact right but to them they thought Jesus was talking about the natural bread but it shows how dangerous false doctrine is doesn't it as Jesus said beware of the leaven or the bread height of the Pharisees and Sadducees but they didn't understand that right brother bang the kitty right now the guy they didn't understand that look they're talking about the false teaching of the Pharisees we think all that so simple but I suppose were on the other side of the atonement right we're on the other side of Pentecost so see they didn't even have an understanding of what leaven bread was it was the false doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees alright that's the second example so two examples of not having enough the understanding of the word okay let's go to Matthew 19 10 and 10 through 12 we'll see they didn't have understanding about marriage and divorce where we'd say just the they didn't have the understanding of the power that would keep a marriage strong so Matthew 19 10ft 1910 alright Matthew 19 dead his disciples said to him if the case of the man be so with his wife it is not good to marry now look the disciples are saying wow this is the case there's only one cause for a divorce and remarriage it's good for a man not to marry but didn't God say in Genesis chapter 2 it's not good for man to be alone right so here's the disciples they don't understand yet the power when the Holy Ghost comes it's not gonna be hard for a couple to stay together because they're both gonna be born again they're saying oh it's good for the men not to get married but Jesus says this in verse 11 all men cannot receive this saying save save then they determine is given so Jesus says there's only some people that can receive this the true children of God right is the the make believers non-believers they're going to get divorced remarried divorced remarried it's not given to them it's only given to the believer to see so the disciples didn't even understand wow they don't understand the power of the Holy Ghost that would be in them to keep their marriages strong so Paul right later he said no husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church right and wives submit to your husband's as the church should submit to Christ but their cycles is almost not good for men to marry but see they just lacked the understanding of the Holy Spirit about marriage of the horse and about how powerful God became how much power they would have rather to keep their marriages strong okay let's do another one here mark 7:14 so they're marking 14 mark 7 14 to 23 Bible calls this a parable which is interesting this is a parable so I think he's referring to the parable earlier in the chapter about how a man is like a cub and if you might wash the outside it doesn't really do any good you got to clean the inside of the cup right we want our heart sleep BB what the inside of our thoughts and emotions when everything will I end up with the Word of God I think that's what we referred to here now look at verse 14 did you want to read 14 15 and thank you that's where Jesus taught when the Bible calls us a parable so when you compare a human to a cup right or suppli core whatever where Jesus was describing it that's I guess it's a pair of a pair of a pair of arable sorry according to scripture verse 18 they say them them are you so without understanding also do you not perceive that whatsoever thing from without enters into the man it cannot defile him because it enters not into his heart but into the belly and goeth out into the draught perching all meats and he said that which cometh out of the man that defiles the men for from within out of the heart of man proceedeth proceed evil thoughts adulteries fornications murders thefts covetousness wickedness deceit lasciviousness and evil eye blasphemy pride foolishness all of these evil things come from within and defile the man so me too much candy bars is that going to defile your spiritual state No that will enter in your body it's gonna hurt your body but that's not gonna cause thatch to come out of your mind out of your heart right it's the evil that's already inside of you that's what it's got to be cleaned out Jesus says nothing can go into a man and really defile him it's what's in the heart that defiles a person and then Jesus said don't you understand he said hearken unto me and understand this the Pharisees were all concerned with washing hands and meats and tithing on every little ounce and every little milliliter everything they are all concerned with these outward things but Jesus said don't you understand it's about the inside it's about the heart how many children what a pure heart before God so let's when we pray we'll said God please approach our hearts clean not hearts of our inside to be pure so that these things don't come out of our mouths right these actions we don't steal we don't lie we don't last feel like we don't commit all these evil acts all right so that's another one they didn't understand they didn't understand that it's the inside it's what's already inside a man that defiles it will give us go to Luke 18 verse 31 Luke 18:31 here's another thing they didn't understand they didn't understand what Jesus was foretelling his death and Luke 18 31 through 34 in church this is one of the saddest ones in the Bible of course but the person was forgiven but remember when Peter rebuked Jesus himself Peter reviewed Jesus and said surely you're not going to die remember Jesus looked at Peter what did he call it what did he call that spear that Jeep Peter was speaking out remember behind me Satan one of the saddest examples I would say of a person getting the wrong spirit on them but thankful that God forgave Peter this is why it's so important to understand the prophecies understand what God has said to us Luke 18:31 234 all right so sorry verse 31 that he took unto him 212 instead of them the old we go up to Jerusalem and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the son of man should have accomplished for he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles and shopping mocked and spiteful he's treated and spit it on and they shall scourge him and put him to death and the third day he shall rise again look at this verse 34 and they understood what how much of this none of these things and this saying was hit from them neither knew they the things which were spoken Jesus told them I'm gonna be offering to rise on the third day he told them this I couldn't be delivered to the Gentiles in romance and I lashed on the third day and they didn't understand because the Bible said it was hid from them and right after this in Luke 16 I'm sorry Matthew 16 Peter rebukes Emmanuel himself Peter rebukes God himself and then God asked Jesus has to say get behind me Satan it wasn't a flesh and blood affair wasn't it was battling the spirits behind them so can all the beat all the children see it's important to understand what Jesus is saying it's important understand those prophecies were to understand and remember what he said okay now some of these was gift as we're getting about halfway done with the time there remember the new birth when Nicodemus said explain to me the new birth again what did Jesus say he said art to a aren't you a master of Israel you don't understand these things he said what do you mean I'm gonna have to enter my mother's womb and be born to get how is that possible in Jesus kind of your beauty princess you don't understand it you're a master in Israel you don't understand any born-again event being born again of those of the soul right he meant that that's another example in Ezekiel he said as equal were told us a new heart a new sphere and my sphere and still this master in Israel didn't understand that we went over this briefly but Jesus is preaching in John chapter 6 he said I am the living bread that came down from heaven the Jews thought he was saying that he must eat their literal flesh and drink his literal blood but we know he was speaking of symbolically right he was speaking of the spiritual word and of course our taking the holy spirit and the disciples didn't understand that at all let's go to Luke 10:17 this is a good one always to remember whenever God does America remember it's okay to rejoice but we should remember there's more important things than miracles salvation is more important than miracles let's go to Luke 10:17 so this shows some of the preachers I believe this is with anis emiti return some of them didn't understand the principle either Luke 10:17 they didn't read 17 you want to read 19 thank you appreciate that thank you Lydia and Sarah verse 20 notwithstanding and this rejoice not so they're rejoicing in Jesus's don't rejoice just because you have power right so if we do a miracle we should you know God allows us to do americorps see miracle who shouldn't get more excited about that and the fact that the person can be saved actually the most important thing this person is living a change life right are saved from their addictions they're saved from their sins right that's mo that's more important we that's um something to rejoice about right like we said last week with Haven being baptized and different ones being baptized if your name is in heaven that's more to rejoice on than just seeing America you're injured in heaven because the next verse Jesus says that verse 21 in that hour Jesus rejoice in spirits that I think the O Father Lord of Heaven earth that house hid these things from the wise and the prudent that's revealed them unto babes even so father we're so it seemed good in thy sight so even preachers needed the right understanding right even I need the right understanding everyone needs the right understanding we should have more rejoicing to see people's soul saved and seeing a real change life than just miracles Jesus had to correct them he said don't rejoice over that be thankful for that but don't rejoice and Joyce said something got state all right so that takes you through some of the examples on under oh sorry knowledge you can see how the disciples lacked a lot of knowledge right yeah and remember we would have been the same way we're not exalting ourselves at all we would did exactly the same thing about Bramson we would have did the same thing like Adam and Eve if we would have been there in the garden of you okay let's look at temperance I'm just going to quickly read one we're not going to read it but in Matthew chapter 4 the example for the Granby or temperance was Jesus when he was hungry he had self-control not to turn the stone into bread so Jesus clearly had temperance course he had already received the Holy Spirit it came down like a dove at his baptism the spirit drove him out in the wilderness so can everybody see that he had temperance he had the self-control even though I'm hungry I'm not gonna try to do a miracle or do something for myself I'll wait until God gives me permission okay let's see that was the example brother name of temperance I couldn't find another one of the disciples with temperance anybody think of one I thought about how they ate corn number they were hungry on the Sabbath and they ate corn but Jesus allowed them to do that and Jesus backed them for doing that so that really was an example of any failure with temperance but they didn't they didn't do it when Jesus said they could do so I couldn't think of any other temperance examples and when I was in reading I didn't find any other examples of temperance Harmy that's do it yeah that that's I'm gonna bring that one later with God they actually have that for godliness oh yeah that could be one two that could be one two and some of these overlap I'm using some of these Oh we'll get to later for godliness some of them overlap that's a good one this isn't really nut higher I was really blessed by this was Matthew 15 22 let's go here this is the woman of Canaan and her daughter was possessed with the devil this is a really good example of patience the disciples didn't have enough patience Matthew 15 22 all right Matthew 15 22 also called the syrophoenician woman or the Canaanite woman and behold a woman of Canaan came unto I'm sorry came out of the same coasts and cried at him saying have mercy on me O Lord thou son of David my daughter's grievously vexed with the devil and she I'm sorry he answered her not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away or she cried after us so they're so impatient with her just come up she's seen let me see Jesus let me see your Savior he won't answer he won't even look at her remember because she wasn't son of David to knit to her right and he said he told his disciples go to the lost house of the sheep of Israel right so that's what my mind tells us they're so impatient they say Jesus would you please send her away she keeps crying after us they'd lost their patience send her away we've tried to send her away she won't leave look at verse 24 but he answered and said I am NOT sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel then came she had worshipped him saying lord help me and he answered and said it is not meet to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs and she said truth Lord yeah the dogs heat up crumbs which fall from their master's table then jesus answered and sent her o woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou wilt and her daughter was made whole from that very hour praise God to see how God ant honors great faith this great faith give up on your prayers or does it keep Craig what do you think true it keeps cracking keeps crying out Jesus hear me Jesus into my prayer that's what great faith does and we'll keep praying right for God to answer our prayers as well but do you see how the disciples lack patience they got impatient with the movement send her away send away Jesus she won't listen us you send her away and again the disciples were going to send another group away in Matthew 14 let's go to Matthew 14 the previous chapter they were going to send away the multitude so again showing the lack of patience Navy lack of compassion the disciples are trying to send them away but Jesus went to help them so Jesus actually looked at this multitude in Matthew 14 13 and the Bible said he had great compassion upon them if you look at Matthew 14:14 he looks at the multitude and had compassion upon them okay look at verse 15 when it was evening his disciples came to him saying this is a desert place and the time is now past send them all to do the way but they both may go into the villages and buy themselves victuals so again the disciples are sending them away we can't help them master send them away and the next chapter they tried to send no Canaanite woman away but then but they didn't know that Jesus would had compassion upon them okay so then Jesus instead tells him to stay and he performs the miracle of multiplying the loaves of the fish grace God there's another good example the cycles want to send away but Jesus says no I have compassion upon this people I'm going to feed them all right so let's do I got two more to go and then we'll try get to our closing scriptures here again this show this so now let's go to godliness I'll never remember brother Branham said about godliness he says be being godly is being like God and loving those who don't love you and then program gave the scripture where Jesus said the heavenly father sends rain upon the just and the unjust so we want to look at some scriptures and this is what we're sister Wendy that caught that one two about Peter cutting off his enemies a year instead of loving his enemy what he tried to do yeah so three that one first is sort of John 18 John 18 10 is the actual description so I thought this was a good example it could be patience as well I think I think a lot of these more together temperance even of self-control but clearly we can see by what brother Graham said about godliness he's not being kind to his enemy these are enemies they're coming to take his Lord the one he said a few hours ago I'll die with you so John 1810 okay every day then Simon Peter having a sword drew it and smoked the high priests servant and cut off his right hear the servants name was Malchus then said Jesus are the Peter put up thy sword into that the sheath the cup which my father hath given me shall I not drink it remember another portion said they who take the sword will die with the sword so should we take a natural sword try the Me's if someone says oh you're you shouldn't dress like that and that goes godly clothes and those those skirts all those are old-fashioned so we want to get that back and hurt them back or should we want to pray for them to pray for this you don't want to fight them back they might try to fight us it's not really that it's a spear behind it we have to be godly and love those who don't love us that's one good example and here's the last one I have for godliness I can find luke 9:51 luke 9:51 this is a story where one of Jesus disciples wanted to call fire down from heaven just because they rejected Jesus so these are people that have rejected Jesus seemingly there were enemies to Christ and Jesus has to correct correct him and this is the disciple of love as well he became later the disciple of love Saint John the Divine so see before the Holy Ghost he was a he was a I would call them sons of thunder right judgment judgment oh man any any enemy let's just make God judge them send fire on them but after the Holy Ghost look how the capstone of love came down upon his heart and now he's praying for his enemies right afterwards and then you memory read this morning he said if you don't love your brother you're a liar you don't love God see so we have to love our enemies if God changed his heart they got I can change any of our hearts to because you really want to see these people destroyed by fire what does he fire come down upon a city burn up people does that sound nice does that sound kind like a fruit of the Spirit no no does it but jesus corrected it he Jesus is here he crept us as well luke 9:51 okay so Lydia Sarah maybe we can read a couple more then you read 51 52 53 please they're good thank you I mean that Jesus was so focused on his crucifixion that that's all I could think about and the Bible said they didn't receive him because he had such focus on the cross isn't that striking goodness look at verse 54 and when his disciples James and John saw they said Lord will not forgive them and something they said will you forgive them now they said Lord wilt now that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them even as Elias did they wanted fire to come down all because they rejected Christ is that what Jesus wanted the Jesus want fire to come down upon every person I rejected him no their scriptures I've talked before where God doesn't delight when sinners die it's sad if a burden is it he doesn't want to see people go to hell and brother Branham said if you want to see how to go to hell we need to go back to that doctor repent and get saved we don't want to see anybody lost look at verse 55 but he turned and rebuked him so clearly Jesus is upsetting you change these sons of thunder these dozens of the sons of great emotion right and zeal wow he rebukes him even though he was focused on Calvary he hurts the he hears these words that were not very godly they're not very patient were they he turns around he rebukes them and he says you know not what men our spirit Europe so in other words he says you got the wrong spear don't that's the spirit of the devil right I said you got the wrong spirit that's not God's Spirit for this this particular Thailand season the diverse 56 let's read together children ready one two three more the Son of Man has not come to destroy men's lives but to save them they went to another village so can you see how the disciples didn't have brother godliness yet they weren't quite like God yet they did a lot of good things that miracles if they're very very godly disciples but they had certain character traits that were lacking and it crew that's why Jesus breathed on them and said receive the Holy Ghost put your hand on something and look at them real serious and say receive the Holy Ghost receive as a very serious look yeah that's what Jesus did he looked at them real serious receive because we can't have these types of attitudes we can't want judgment to fall on people that reject us we want God to have mercy on people that won't come to our church we want to ever have mercy on people that call us old-fashioned or oh you're in a cult we won't have mercy on people that say that that judgment mercy those scripture is pretty helpful can you see now so now we've gone through faith virtue now I'll enter you there's a lot of examples that now is went through temperance with Jesus patience of the woman and the sight bowls you know who cycles need have more patience with the woman of Canaan godliness and Wednesday went through brotherly kindness they didn't treat each other right all the time didn't they argued amongst themselves so now let's go through I just want to go through the end of the disciples and this just was such an encouragement to me we preached on this recently but I just want to show it again let's go to Matthew 19:27 and remember I'm not we're not trying to look down upon the disciples at all but we just want to see how they were lacking these things that Peter taught later it's clear they were lacking some of these things just like we can look at our lives and sit home sometimes it's clear that I'm not being kind of my brothers and sisters sometimes as clear I'm not being nice to those people who reject our teaching Matthew 19:27 alright Lydia in deciding game by the way to pass that back to Malachi all right are you gonna read 27 and 28 necessary to read 29 we will be a forsaken on how these which Jesus said unto them verily I say to you that wish that he which have followed me in their regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory he also Thank You Sara thank you great job wonderful appreciate your home in verse 30 but many that our first should be last and the last shall be first did everybody see what Jesus was going to reward them with they were clearly not perfect they lacked a lot of strength during Jesus earthly ministry but Jesus knew that they would have then should be born again and so who can tell me what were they going to sit on different see that description or they're gonna sit up twelve Thrones and that these Thrones kind of mind you of Narnia make how they go instead of growth after they overcome right they sit in the throne of his glory and then they can judge I think the children can all see that then we're lacking a lot of these but by these virtues but once they got the Holy Ghost and went through some Lord trials and put on the armor of God neither through the spirit then once they died and crossover they'd be they'd have the character to judge other people right in a character to rule but they had to be willing to go to the Pentecost the Holy Ghost and then really fight for God with the armor of the armor of the Lord okay so again I I just want you to know if I would place myself amongst the disciples idea the very bottom the cycles be way up here and we want to put ourselves where we're the least of the least right where the were the lowest of the low you want to humble ourselves and we're looking at a lot of their mistakes but I want you to know these were some of the finest godliest men because geez just promise then you will judge the 12 tribes of Israel most these men have to all them except Saint John died for Christ as martyrs so these were mighty men of God once they got the baptism the Holy Ghost God really used them in some tremendous ways never understand that these are some really wonderful servants of the Lord they just had to go through sanctification and get barred again are you are you children we're ready to go through sanctification be sanctified and serve God yeah if you do and you get filled with the Holy Ghost she has a throne for you I that's even better than our you know like we've been talking for Eve everything about Dean because it's real God has a throne because jesus promised us and never see if we overcome we sitting with him on it that's the promise for our day RH to sell the throne this is beautiful I'll buy this you want to cry here look 22:28 look at this Hawkins praise the Lord the 2229 it makes you want to cry because we've tried to continue with the word and all the trials that come along with it Luke 22:28 this is a parallel passage look at this it says ye are they which have continued with me in my look at this verse 29 and I have point unto you a kingdom as my father at 4.30 that's the baptism the Holy Ghost program so that's the kingdom of God that he may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom so now I was talking about the son of David Kingdom and sit on Thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel I hope I can explain this right to it this is why this makes me want to cry Jesus is going to reward them just for staying with him for the three and a half years of ministry and yet he knows they're gonna scatter and run away like she like scared sheep at his arrest right he knows that but he say because you hung with me and stay with me this whole three and a half years even though others have verse akin me I've been rejected because you stay with me this three and a half years he said I'm gonna point you Thrones to sit on and he knew they were gonna fall short that's what maybe that's what's so beautiful for us because even though we lack understanding or we might not understand everything about the rapture or things to come what can we do can we still continue with the Lord throughout through these temptations in truck absolutely we'll just stay with the word of the hour like brother Lawrence is thinking about we'll just stay with us saith the Lord we'll stay with the word of God we might not understand everything and there's a throne for us to sit on don't bring it don't bring us to it just like he brought the disciples now think about this after Jesus raised from the dead did the disciples go looking for him or did Jesus come looking for the disciples so even if we make mistakes they'll come looking for us so Jesus would reward them for staying with him through his previous temptations he knew they would forsake him at the arrest and the and the cross except John's I was there and women were there those godly sisters but he would seek them out later like a shepherd and bring them back and love that jesus said if he loved me feed my sheep just preach to them preach God's Word feed that machine food right that proves you really love the book amen let's see let's look where the Bible said they actually sat on those Thrones that you know it's in the Bible revelation 4 let's go revelation 4 verse 4 Jesus said you're gonna sit on twelve Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel well revelation gives us a picture of them sitting with the other twelve sons of Jacob revelation 4 4 can Jesus tell a lie children no he said you'll sit on these thrones because you continue with me these three and a half years through all these campaigns the up and down of his ministry remember in 2nd year was a year of popularity but in the third year as the year of his rejection that's what Thompson cheating's concordance says his initial introductory year of first year second year as popularity third year he lost all his popularity because of his preaching he was rejected but he said because you stayed with me these three and half years you will sit on the twelfth rows all right revelation 4 4 how about we all read that together ok let me get there I hear everybody's voice on three one two three and round about the throne were four and 20 seats and upon the seats I saw four and 20 elders sitting clothed and white raiment and they had on their heads crowns of gold that beautiful jesus promised he said because you stay with me because you haven't left the word even though I've seen all your faults with the status for men I've seen all your faults you're going to get barred again and then you're gonna have a throne you're gonna go through the armor of God you're gonna go through adoption placing your the manifest the fruit of the Spirit you're gonna die as martyrs but you're going to have the throne that I promised you praise the Lord okay and let's go one more scripture revelation 14 5 I preached this one let's preach on the throne of God this is my closing scripts you want to preach on the on the table revelation 14 five this is a hundred forty-four thousand Jews and in verse 1 the Bible said they get the Holy Ghost but it's called the father's name written in their forehead but we know that symbol written your forehead means your sealed with the Holy Spirit he's God so before the throne of God is there any sin against them know when you're born again God is living inside of you and you have no false before the throne of God that's how important that charity is up there can everybody say capstone ready - stone that's how important that cash so it is he caps your life and ultimately caps your destiny you have a that your destiny that before the throne of God you have a throne - and jesus promised in the church ages and you will judge nations remember that was an authority in church age will judge a nation that you can be born again if you can love God with all your heart soul mind and strength that would let you judge nations remember what the Bible said there is no more what search with the sea there's no more crying okay it starts with them there's no more kind of nation to them that are Christ Jesus right so this scripture says those who are born again there's no fault before the throne of God Paul said there's no condemnation that are in Christ Jesus and no one can lay any what - God's elect any charge good Lydia there is no charge to God's own that no one can accuse you of anything when you're born again because Jesus has totally forgiven you how does that make you feel that make you want to be born again basically I just make my calling election sure I believe I'm born again but it makes you live even closer to the Lord so there's no condemnation chorus right if I've said no kind of nation that I said no one can lay any charge before the throne of God your without fault before the throne of complication has no charges no one can say you're guilty this you'll do that like that song one drop of blood that's a reality there's no charges because the Bible said God nailed them to Jesus's cross the handwriting that was against you it was nailed to Jesus's cross and you don't have to pay for any charges anymore praise God well that concludes that I think I'll stop right there that's about an hour any questions on how Jesus's disciples had to go through sanctification any questions or any examples you thought that might be helpful if we go through this the future in other examples of faith virtue knowledge temperance and patience and godliness and brotherly content examples okay just something I told my families but I have a desire to preach the whole ministry of Jesus that's been a long series that I want to preach Matthew Mark Luke and John I just had that design and I think as we go through there we'll pull out some of these revelations the reason is because brother Branham said the ministry the bride must match Jesus's ministry before he comes back the capstone must match and must fit perfectly on top of the pyramid that's why I felt such a burden for last couple of years I want to preach Jesus his whole ministry and so I found my Bible brother bang Thompson Chaney and corns lays out all four Gospels in chronological order it's beautiful and I think it has like 400 events so it gives me a real good start to preach Jesus's ministry I'm hoping to do that at some point in the next maybe few months or year once I finish the church ages I want to get to know Jesus's ministry so much that our ministry looks like Jesus praise God because it has to match and that capstone comes out of the rapture Jesus comes out at the rapture teen girls can you bring the capstone down the boy like this bring it down and then set it on the top Grady when it comes down the ministry of the bride must match jesus's ministry perfectly that's why that's such an important topic for me Thompson Jane got me started there's really okay well that's our heads and what do we say we pray forward or we can pray to God we'll what do we say there's something particular eyes let's just pray that think about those virtues again and see which one I want to pray for again is there a new one this week might want to pray for that you pray for the sanctification our lives Kember the exact words but yeah the continual sanctification something along those lines yeah that we'd be sanctified yeah right honey well how many want to be sent if I didn't live a sanctified that means cleaned out all the bad things out don't when you take a drink of water from a cup don't you want that cup nice and clean it's Biggins ban dad you are nice and clean so God won't see our hearts cleaned out okay so that's ours the word of Prayer Emily father Lord we come to the close of the day father this is such a touching the subject to me for some reason and just meant so much to me so the closely other disciples lives Norman I'm just humbled to see how much they failed but of course they had so much victory as well during this three and a half years no doubt about that but I'm humbled to see despite their failures how highly you exalted them dear God because you said if we humble ourselves you'll exalt us in due season and then Lord we can open up the book of Revelation and see how you never told a lie everything you said will come to pass you promised them Thrones that there we see them sitting on these throne in the regeneration you rewarded them for the three-and-a-half years of labor although they didn't understand a lot even though they forgot a lot of the prophecies you reward them for continuing with you in your temptations Lord how highly you'll reward us Lord God for continuing with the message despite our temptations despite the accusations against the message of the our Lord God how highly will you will reward us as long as we continue with Lord I believe you said awesome revelation 3:10 because you continued with the word despite the temptation I'll keep you from the hour of the temptation because you have patience and kept the word of my patience yes there it is I'll keep you from the hour temptation will come upon the interval Lord what if what a promise or God what a glorious promise today or as I told these children Lord your your word is true you promised us a Oh to see if we overcame label to see as the trials and temptations than Antichrist spirits we would sit with you in your throne even as you set down with your father and his we don't take these promises like a big order we don't take any service or Bible study lightly warn as Malachi reminded us Lord my hands up lord please sanctify me the children Lord they raised their hands earlier Lord God is heaven what have you cleaned out we one of these tickets and when our garments white we want to be capped off and with the baptism of the Holy Ghost your chooses is that upon our children fall upon the adults who need Lord Jesus granite Laura develop our for service Lord Jesus power to be a witness power to manifest the armor of God the fruits of the spirit Lord Jesus how merciful you are of us to know what spirit we're of Lord God was just like God opposed to be counted off and have all these virtues Adam to us what we need to be more sanctified they we subtract they we purge any sin or any fleshly desire or gun that's keeping us from being sealed Lord or letting your spirit flow through us if we are poor commander that's such a precious thought lord thank you for giving us these thoughts Lord God I can see the value Lord of every single time together or what it listen Thank You sweet Jesus for your promises it was the same that the case you desire for the young ones in order for our lives we know you'll do it because you're rich in mercy Lord God because we continue with you for all these years Lord God you know your father thank you we love you Lord in Jesus Christ's name the children said hey let's see nuts [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] obviously not again to her maybe he shot it with God sometime this week if you find some three times in the morning and then evening did you say Bob Bobby can I go and pray for a few minutes not really think about that God would lead you and me shut in with God to seek the sanctification seek some time with the Lord I think that'd be a good idea [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] let's pray that you're the adult all of us would try to shut it with you a little bit this one to act among the things that we've heard your profits that they always ask thank you for the faith that we've seen our lives our virtue knowledge temperance the patience that God literally kindness add to it dear God of great add two more chances [Music] there's such reward if we continue with your word in this son with the Ministry of the hour help us to strive to never be discouraged but to be encouraged your God you're letting us continue or walking with me or God we love you Lord be with these souls that our body be baptized father we just pray that be sincere that then we'll receive a real salvation thank you for the blessings Lord your word this atmosphere we love you hard all of our lives in Jesus Christ every set [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
