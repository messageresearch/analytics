jesus christ's name and the church said amen praise god take your bibles let's go to second thessalonians chapter two i like to look at the mystery of iniquity part two tonight and continue to deal with this i'm happy to say i got uh the philadelphia church age finished this week and working on laodicea by god's grace coming towards the end of this 13th chapter out of 14 chapters we're getting so close i'm just chomping at the bit ready to get done here by god's grace also i don't know if you saw it on youtube i had numerous requests for my book to be put on audio form so i have chapter one done i posted on youtube last night so if you don't have a chance to read it and you like to listen to it you can do that now i'm working on chapter two now by god's grace i recorded it today i just gotta edit it tomorrow and hopefully put it up there we'll try to get all eight chapters done soon in the next few weeks and uh it's free if they can't buy it they can listen to it so there's no excuses you know god will make no excuses on the day of judgment all men are without excuse and so we want to do everything we can to get the word of god out praise god so thank you for your support church thank you for all you do all your support you know giving tithes and offerings it's a great blessing it supports the ministry uh we're going to keep it going by the grace of the lord so the second thessalonians chapter 2. i like could just read one verse let's conserve our time and um let's look at verse seven second thessalonians two verse seven all right let's just read verse seven together on three one two three for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way that god has blessings reading his word you may be seated just a real interesting scripture church and even in verse seven i've had a couple emails this year already god hides can you pull that up verse 7 god hides the end of the gentile dispensation in this scripture and people just miss it they can't see it because it's hidden from the eyes of the wise and prudent people see he and then he and they think it's two people but it's not it's one see iniquity is already working paul says only he the holy spirit will now let it until he the holy spirit and the church be taken out of the way yes so they miss it there so people think it's it's two people or they think it's you know one's the antichrist and one is one is the holy spirit and they totally mix it up but brother and clears it up for us in the first seal and he tells us this is the one and same self-same person the he the holy spirit the holy in other words the holy spirit is letting satan have his way right the holy spirit's letting satan run around the earth and and accuse the brethren day and night in heaven the holy spirit is letting him be god of this world until the holy spirit's ministry is taken out of the way right and then he has free course and then he has then his fullness will be headed up in the antichrist because verse 8 says and then shall that wicked be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming so see the holy spirit is letting satan do little things little things but once the holy spirit goes up and then satan can come down in his fullness in the person of the pope antichrist oh my but thank god church we know of course before when when the holy spirit goes up we go up praise god amen thank god for that he's going to let it go until he be taken out of the way the holy spirit christ and his bride be taken out of the way of destruction praise god because god will not suffer the righteous to be destroyed and tormented with the wicked we know that and we thank god for his mercy now just real brief a brief uh review what is the revelation of the mystery of iniquity it's the antichrist fills and deceives the hellbound majority into blaspheming god's truth under their mask of sin loving religious experience so it's a it's a mystery that most people don't know right most people don't most people don't think the antichrist is in the churches but he is that's the mystery of it it unmasks a religious front right it unmask and exposes it for what is it what it is it's a mother harlot it's a mother catholic church and her daughters who are uh purposely infiltrating the world with their wickedness and their abomination oh but god has unmasked that today and the revolution revelation is known to us praise god on sunday night we saw how this iniquity started it started in heaven but then it came down to earth praise god and it came down in the form of the serpent praise god or satan possessing the serpent and he questions god's word and he deceives eve and that's where we get the original sin so it's beautiful uh as far as the revelation to see how it started in heaven it got kicked out of heaven by a stronger angel michael praised god it got kicked out and then it come down to earth and the only one satan could deceive was a woman and it was because god was allowing it as a type so don't just see you know eve as a woman and all the women see all the church in there as well right see yourself you you us as a church we would have failed had it not been for our husband praise god we would be dead except christ overcome for us praise god amen because we have all fallen short of the glory of god we all had a chance to stand up we all had a chance to overcome but all of us fail in ourselves but we all conquer through jesus christ because the church is eve types the church the entire church praise god amen and christ adam types christ amen hallelujah who died and taking on her sin he purposely died taking the curse upon him that he might have continued fellowship with her amen amen and redeemer praise god that's the beauty of that story now so we see how iniquity came to earth and it was first satan's nature was introduced into the human race it wasn't originally the human race but it was introduced in the human race through the mystery of this serpent seed and there's uh nine evidences i'm just going through them quickly the the first evidence is that serpent seed is supported from genesis to revelation moses taught it and it goes to jesus to paul to john to revelation all the way it's all through the scripture second the two trees were not literal trees because uh they were not good for food the bible said there was trees that were good for food but then it said there was two trees and the bible said uh they were different trees praise god because any tree that will kill you is not good for food praise god so there are there was trees but then there was two spiritual trees christ and satan in the garden of eden so it's truly it's truly proven by the word of god the third proof is that the tree of life was jesus's spirit because there's only one way to eternal life if you make the tree of life a natural tree now you've got two ways to eternal life but there's only one way and that's through substitutionary sacrifice praise god a natural tree does not give you eternal life it was a spiritual tree it was god's spirit that gives us eternal life amen the fourth evidence is the serpent seed explains the purpose of the virgin birth praise god amen it had to be a sin sexual sin the beginning uh uh because the first sin came by sexual sin it was a sexual sin and it perverted the human race so god had to bypass sexual uh activity and bring forth his his new seed uh the seed of god without sexual sin through a virgin birth amen and that proves the mystery of god's seed amen the serpent seed came through sex but the seed of god came without it praise god through a virgin birth amen and then the fifth one is adam and eve covered their loins after eating the forbidden fruit that's all they covered was their loins so they went around covering their private parts because that's what they sin with their private parts praise god they didn't they didn't put masks on like we got today they didn't put hoods on like people wear today they put on loins because they were ashamed and it proves sexual sin always causes shame praise god that's right number six god's punishments for eve centered on her sexual reproduction and longing for adam remember she was punished in childbearing and bringing forth children she'd have pain in children and not only that so so there's pain as she brings for seed she has pain every time she brings forth seed as a universal sign that that's where her first sin took place with her reproductive parts praise god so she'll always have pain bringing forth natural seed because she received the wrong natural seed in the beginning and then god had to punish her because her longing was for the serpent instead of her husband and so afterwards god said so see now you're going to have to long for your husband because beforehand you long for the wrong man and that was the serpent seven the serpent was human-like before the fall he wasn't on his belly he was upright he had the ability to talk and he was a very beautiful creature because the bible said eve looked at him and thought he was beautiful and lusted after him with her eyes remember all three channels lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life eve was seduced in all three areas but christ overcame in all three areas praise god amen where the woman fell the man overcame praise god amen and that's us we would fall except christ makes a way we can overcome amen so see he was human-like before the fall so much so that his seed could mingle with human seed and number eight cain was the serpent's son and not adams the scripture's clear on that praise god that cain was the son of the wicked one and adam is never called wicked adam is always called the son of god just like you are called a child of god amen thank god and lastly the seed of the woman was a literal man jesus christ just like the seed of the serpent was a literal man came praise god so if we know the seed of the woman had to come a natural man apart from human male instrumentality apart from human seed so did the serpent seed have to be a literal man apart from human seed it was serpent seed see that everybody see that by god's grace the serpent his seed was not literal human seed he came apart from human seed so did christ amen hallelujah now church if that don't prove it then people are just bombastic they're just blind they just don't want to see it right and i showed you a few weeks ago or months ago rather genesis 4 1 is the literal interpretation of genesis 3 6's symbolism genesis 3 6 partaking of the fruit is symbolic right of a physical sex act that genesis 4 1 records amen now let's get to some new material here tonight now i found church there could be more but i found that iniquity has six attributes which six is the number of man it's the number of anointed man but it's also the number of fallen man okay so if you got your bibles here let's go through this by god's grace now we've seen satan's uh we've seen iniquity starting place in lucifer's heart and then he injected that nature into the heart of cain and then it passed down through six simple examples of iniquity now church take this attitude tonight as we go through these six you need to acknowledge them but you also need to overcome them so in other words learn from satan's six uh attributes and do the opposite praise god because what about ram say when the church gets a revelation of the antichrist spirit and withstands it shall be invincible praise god amen i believe it like this i believe there's a greater invincibility for the rapture no doubt about that but i believe the blood bought the blood purchased the overcoming bride has been invincible since the day of pentecost amen i believe that with all my heart in other words what i'm saying to you is that you and i are invincible by the blood of jesus christ and obeying the holy spirit right now praise god amen right because no man can pluck us out of the father's hand praise god doesn't mean we won't fall short doesn't mean we won't make mistakes but what it means is over the long-term battle you and i are invincible because we're sealed in to being victors in christ jesus amen thank the lord amen i believe that with all my heart praise god just like god said about job god said he's perfect he was invincible right he made a few mistakes on earth he was fearful you know he hated the day he was born he said some things maybe he shouldn't have said but overall he was invincible because god saw the end from the beginning god saw he was going to overcome now the first attribute of the uh the iniquity heart of satan and cain because now now this iniquity has gone from satan's heart to cain's heart the first one is they go through vain beautiful acts of worship religious acts of worship and they create their own traditions that's the first attribute church i don't know how long but there was a long time satan joined i don't know how it looked but he was playing as he had remember he had pipes in heaven he had pipes built in he must had wings and all kinds of things he he was for a long time maybe millions of years he enjoyed singing to god but at some point he was only going through the motions right he was only playing the instruments he was only preaching just for just going through the motion just because i have to be here my livelihood is here i was called here in other words he let he let his religious acts just become common oh god help us not to let him become common help us to enjoy every worship activity praise god help us enjoy cracking open that bible amen reading that bible say it in prayer coming to church worshiping glorifying god god help us to enjoy it praise god and not just go through the motions now at times are you have to yes you're going to bring your body into subjection but just keep pressing through just keep pressing through pretty soon you're going to enjoy it pretty soon you're going to shout and actually mean it praise god amen but see just like lucifer at some point he stopped enjoying it and he thought i need this i deserve this and then we know what happened he did the church split and then he started singing for more for his glory and to try to see everybody how beautiful he was was it was he not he convinced a third of them how great a singer he was and how a great musician he was singing all for his glory so see now he wanted to be the object of their worship instead of god cain did the same thing he brought a beautiful colorful offering fully aware that's not what god wanted he knew it abel had brought it before abel's was accepted he knew it was wrong he purposely went through vain acts fully aware he was wrong so church what was he he was stubborn i don't care what other people do the church i'm doing it this way i don't care what other people amen i'm not going to amend that because i don't believe that i think that's off the word because i've got my own revelation you see how he got he he was purposely willingly stubborn to worship like everybody else i think we shall worship like brother amen don't you with all of his heart right or who if i'm needing so and we don't have amen here you should worship like me right if i'm if i'm worshiping god and i'm surrendered and our brothers surrender to god that's what he's the song leader praise god he's trying to lead us into the presence of god amen you trust right you're trusting god's system that your leader will lead you into worship look at his smile when he sings look at his tears when he cries amen what is he trying to do lead us in the presence of god because he's already in god's presence hallelujah praise god that's what they're supposed to do lead us just like with joshua right they led they led before the ark came those leaders and singers and the our men they led the way they were already ahead praise god oh my you see that but see we shouldn't be stubborn and come here and not want to praise god or not want to amend the word we shouldn't be stubborn like that we should be obedient and willing amen submissive but see going through the motions is just a mask like the serpent hid behind uh his lie with eve oh you can be like god you can be just like god he's hiding right the religious act quoting the serpent talking about god was a mask he was but hiding behind that was a lie he wanted to slip in same thing it is with uh any false doctrine right they they say good things but then they slip in a little lie right just like a little yeast to make the whole uh dough leaven the scripture says as jesus talked and taught us about paul says the same thing the workers iniquity have a form of godliness an outward resemblance of godliness but inward the bible says they're dead men's bones right they're slowly corrupting themselves now see church that's why we got to be careful our our lives are our worship uh shouldn't be slowly going worse it should be steadily getting better and church you are the only one you're a creator praise god i'm a creator we create an atmosphere it's up to you praise god it's up to me it's up to each one of us to slowly create an atmosphere to slowly fall more in love with jesus to make sure our lives are pure and our worship is sincere because it's either going to slowly get better or slowly get worse until you despise coming to church writer despise the message or despise brother random sermons or despise the gospel so with the workers of iniquity they despise the truth slowly i was watching sermons of a brother in the message just from six years ago who used to be in the message now he's way out he was speaking so highly of brother branham and then i fast forwarded just four years he's left the message now he calls brother man i'm a liar he's a charlatan and all these things it didn't happen overnight church it was slow one week at a time even when he first left the church that's a preacher from lima you probably know what i'm talking about even when he first left the church he still said good things how faithful he was about brother man's fast forward three more years now he's a liar to charlatan oh my if people can't see that they're blind you're either slowly growing in grace more gracious more loving more forgiving or you're slowly corrupting into sin and anger and democracy let's let's slowly grow up into holiness praise god righteousness godliness and yet they go to church they're pastors you know they but it's either slow growth or it's slow corruption now you know what the scripture says paul says how to do it they creep into your house imagine that remember jesus or god told cain sin lies right at the door if you don't obey and worship like your brother sin is lying right here that church when they open that door it's canaan to confess that demon spirit is going to creep in it's going to slowly creep into the house and it's going to corrupt the house like death like the waters of separation right once one thing dies in there it corrupts the whole atmosphere paul said they'd creep into houses lead silly women let us stray i'll say other silly men too right let's not put it all on women it's there's a lot of men that are pretty corrupt as well just as many right but i like it you know i like i like jesus on the road to emmaus he walked with a guy the new gentleman cleopas and his friend for six miles and then jesus makes he pretends like well i gotta go guys and what do they do they beg him they say come in the house come in and eat with us please come in that's what jesus wants us to do tonight praise god god go home with me amen let me take that word let me take that song i heard at church let me take it into my house praise god let the holy spirit come in here and not just creep in here but flood in here praise god amen praise god but satan likes to slowly creep in and get through the door right and just come in and just change a couple little things here and slowly pervert until the house is just void of the holy spirit void of repentance void of humility right void of holiness void of worship he likes to slowly creep in and do that but thank god we're creators thank god that he made us with the ability to cast down anything that's exalts itself against the knowledge of god jesus wants you to invite him in i remember i preached at albion for the first time i had people people were screaming women were screaming in that service and one of the sisters came up and said that's exactly what she needed she i said i said you stay right here she said i want revival i said you stay right here and beg him to come in and he'll come in she just prayed for two minutes but amen pretty soon she's screaming and crying and she thanked me after the service for it praise god i remember her name too i'm not going to say it right now but but see that's how that's how it was in other words god wants us desperate for change amen he wants us that he wants to know that he's loved he wants to feel our love and our desperation and our worship he wants to feel love because he's a man he's a husband and we're the wife the bride praise god it's a romance right it's a divine romance and he wants to feel love he wants to feel like you want to love him praise god i love you jesus amen hallelujah come into my bed on the way home come into my my office when i get home just come into my mouth come into my vocal cord come into my mind anoint me that lord that you're always welcome in my life amen you see iniquity slowly creeps in it's not quite noticed right away slowly changes things creeping into houses and the bible said they lead families into lustful indulgences that's in second timothy 3 1-7 in church you know this they create their own traditions that they live by instead of living by the word they know what brother branham said now this is the sad part they know what brother abraham said they know what the bible said but they still do whatever they want oh okay well that's what brother jesse preaches or that's just what the brother preaches no if the bible preaches it then you need to do it praise god if the bible says it i need to do it and that settles it praise god in matthew 15 jesus rebuked the scribes and the pharisees he says you transgress god's commands by your traditions remember they were letting church they were letting the the jews instead of supporting their retired and old parents they were letting them give that money to the temple instead of their parents and they made it a tradition it was called a corbin now where did they get that tradition it was actually written in the book called the mishnah the the mishnah was the oral law that was passed down from rabbis uh about a hundred years or a thousand years after moses so about a thousand years after moses israel went to exile right they came out of babylon with their own oral law this is what we remember about what moses said now they had the law but they had their own book trying to understand the law that was the problem their their book their book their bylaws their denominations their creeds their traditions that was wrong they should not have taken the misha and in that mission it said well you can do this you don't really have to obey the word of god and jesus said when you do that your worship's invade oh god help us to live by the pure words of god not to add our ideas or our interpretation let's just obey the simple humble complete word of god for today oh god and i was thinking about that this week amen in the eighth chapter of that book i challenge everybody i go through every doctor and i preach in that book and i said i challenge anybody to show me where it's outside the word and in a year and a half i haven't got one person challenging me whether that's the perfect will of god or not because it wasn't me it was god's word it's not a traditional man dressing modestly isn't a tradition of man it's a tradition of christ amen amen i put that challenge in there and all i hear back is crickets you know why because nobody can stand against god's word praise god and in church when you stand with god's word you're standing on the winning side i'm glad to be standing on the winning side praise god and i've had different i've had my own uh gym teacher from elementary read my book brother amen she's probably 70 now and she had nothing to say about it she just said well i don't i don't want to live that that's what she told me on the text she read the whole thing the day it came out talk about sincere and thank god she had an open heart to read it and i've had my own family members that read it and say nothing about it so see the challenge has been issued out the word has gone forth and the word fights for itself praise god amen we're to defend it but really the word defends itself hallelujah nobody says it's not it's sad but it's just like that person who didn't have the wedding garment on i offered the challenge i said anybody i said proof convince me of sin show me where i've gone wrong in this book show me where god's word about modesty is wrong and nobody can convince it of sin because it's right hallelujah right now i'm in exchange with a brother from the uk actually a 16 year old brother he sent me about 40 emails i can show them to you and every time the word is right all these questions all these things about this and you know thighs and and shoulders and breasts and tattoos and jewelry every time the word is right and i said sir why you emailing me so much he said because you're a real pastor he said joe ossi won't email me back benny hinn won't email me back none of these guys email me back but you'll email me back and he says you got a gift to teach god's word i said well praise god that wasn't me that was you saying that but let me say it like this god's word will always overcome amen and god's word understand amen and church that encourages me because i know we're standing not on the the shifting sands of man-made creeds we're standing on a rock amen a silent rock of god's word that cannot change has never changed and will forever stand amen that's right and i forgot about that challenge i placed in there but it was the holy spirit that wrote that book not me i got proof of it too they tell me that you see but see it's not a man-made creed like the mishnah every modern church creates their own mishna they just call it the assemblies of god doctrine or the cma by-laws like i was talking to some people years ago so sea turtles now we know the first attribute of iniquity is vain beautiful religious acts created by your own tradition now we know our denomination started in genesis actually in satan's heart but right then it got down to earth and then it went cain's heart that's how you guys came in the message right there that's what it was about why we're against denomination why i think i preached why i'm against organized religion because it started there in genesis amen and god condemned it there but there thank god there was a true worshiper there there was an abel there there's someone who believed in the blood they have very the blood to cause you to come to the altar and weep for your sins and ask god to forgive you just like i did praise god amen that's a real revival that's real holy ghost religion praise god i think about that today we have had a revival anytime you get anybody to to have a new life and throw it on the trash that's revival thank god for the revival this bride's revival is still going on amen and if you haven't pushed the trash out of your life by crying well then you're just missing out on the revival but i love it praise god and it's still going on hallelujah amen that's right amen the brother said the denominations have not recognized the awakening of the bride the bride was sleeping but the shout went out behold the bridegroom cometh go you out to meet him trim your lambs amen the bride is awake she's trimming her lips she's having revival she's not sleeping she's awake trimming sanctifying getting ready for the procession of the rapture praise god amen i don't know about you but i'm having a revival all the time praise god pushing out the sin growing closer to god being more dedicated learning more about god growing in grace experiencing god's love and mercy in my daily life if you're not experiencing that please do please come to the altar like these two have shown us right like other ones have shown us please come to the altar and let the holy spirit wash all this trash out of your life praise god yo you'll be revived then you'll enjoy coming to church then hallelujah you'll enjoy worship you'll enjoy time with jesus amen because he done washed you made you clean that's right that's the first attribute they create their own vain religious creeds and go through the motions seconds oh i never set my timer brother okay 15 more minutes yeah i got to respect that because remember i pushed myself so hard i didn't have a voice really to preach i could barely squeak my way through that and i wouldn't i wouldn't do that again to anybody i don't want to put anybody through that awful uh experience now second what do they do the workers of iniquity what does it make what do you do like it did in cain and satan they would not abide in the truth and they despised it so they despised the truth and they ran from it satan did not abide in heaven right he didn't abide there he left his original heavenly position and cain left the presence of now god encourage you church that if you're still here you're in the presence of god hallelujah we know we're the prince of god amen why because it's a holy presence hallelujah it's making us live holy that's how we know amen amen his holy presence promotes holiness and holiness is consecration or dedication or full devotion to one thing god almighty and his word so praying for my children i'm still praying for all the children i think i've cried out all the names of the church this week i think i did by god's grace but i didn't forgive me but i thought i did just praying that god will give each person a revival in their life a revival for the children salvation for the children sanctification for the children the baptism of the holy ghost for the children praise god remember cain left he went out from the prince of the lord and then we know john 2 says they went out from us because they were not of us if they were of us they would have no doubt continue with us but they had to be made manifest that they were not all of us now see church remember this the mark of the beast is already here that's what i'm trying to get austin to see the mark of the beast has it's been here the whole time right if if god's mark is here thank god it's here amen amen thank god the holy ghost is here amen amen but if god's mark is here satan's mark has to be here as well true now so see the mark of the beast comes on a person when they blaspheme the holy ghost or they they deny christ for the final time and god knows when only god knows when that is right only god knows now let's look at this i want to read it in three places it's called a reprobate mind in the scripture so romans 1 28 2 timothy 3 8 and titus 1 16. three times paul calls this a reprobate mind it means a rejected mind my church did you catch that that means god is no longer going to accept anything from that person's mind he's rejected their human spirit god's not going to accept anything from that spirit or soul anymore it's fully sold out to satan he's rejected it there's no more desire in that person there's no remember the holy thirst they've they've killed that holy thirst and god's rejected it and instead they're just thirsting for the love of the world and god just with the reprobate mind he says i've rejected it i'm done with it so they won't stand the truth and they despise what is truth romans 1 28 please thank you sweetheart and even as they this is speaking of homosexuals and even if they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient now this scripture shows someone has to blaspheme the holy spirit before they go into homosexuality because god gave them over to a reprobate mind now there's some people that may do it we know have been rescued right different churches have people that testified they were homosexual but god brought them out thank god but in the majority of cases just like sodom and gomorrah the majority of cases they blaspheme the holy spirit because god god tells them over and over male and female male and female and they finally blaspheme that and god gives them over said fine do what's inconvenient do what's disgusting do what's hateful i'm giving you over to reprobate mind and church don't you know this i've heard a preacher preach it the black lives movement is really a homosexual trans movement are black lives important yes every life is important chinese lives matter right white lives matter right spanish life you name it every life matters but just go on i've gone on their website i saw it this week or last week black lives matter says they want they came to destroy the nuclear family so part of their agenda is to destroy man and woman and say a family can be anything a man and a man a man and a woman that's why they're rioting because they've got the spirit of sodom on them and that's what the men of sodom did they rioted is that right it's completely true you know somebody asked me for my school asked me to go march in the black lives matter and i emailed back i said no sir i said i'm not going to support that organization that organization wants to destroy nuclear family in other words they are out to destroy the family that god ordained and there's so much for it they're willing to destroy things because they they hate they don't like to retain they don't want the knowledge of god and they they despise it so much they'll fight against it they'll ride against it oh but they don't really realize the real weapons are not those bombs and those those gasoline bombs the real weapon is the word of god hallelujah this is the real weapon amen and we can pray and cry we can speak the word of god and this will fight more than all their bombs and their lasers and their guns this is a greater weapon because it's eternal amen so god help us to pray i pray for those people more than i ever have that organization started a long time ago but we pray for them now that god will save those who have not blasphemed the holy spirit if if black lives matter to them so much why don't they go to their local abortion clinic and why don't they tear that down because those black lives are being killed by the hundreds of thousands right why don't they go to the white neighborhoods or any neighborhood where there's an abortion clinic why don't they go there and destroy that because that's destroying lives satan comes to steal kill and destroy but god came that we might have life and have it more abundantly amen praise god it's hypocrisy sin is always hypocrisy satan is the the lord of this the god of this evil age destroying lives and destroying souls praise god the third attribute they deny the full power of the holy spirit iniquity workers are all about temporary feelings that's what they're all about they just want to go get a temporary fix now the sad part is uh what was that brother man said they're like a crow they can eat the good things and the bad things i'm glad i can only eat good things praise god right they can they can go they can go hang out with the church people and enjoy a little bit of preaching a little bit anointing a little bit of singing and praying but then they go out and they enjoy the things of the world as well they can enjoy both they're all about just a quick fix but see a christian's not about that a christian is about a permanent staying in the presence of god living in the holiness of holies living by every word that proceeds not the mouth of god not just a temporary uh not just a temporary state but with a permanent residence in the presence of god amen but not the workers of iniquity they're all about just a quick fix and you can ask that's what my cousin did who god delivered him but that's what he would do you saw him he would come to church and praise god he'd play the music but then after that quick fix of god then he'd go over there and he wouldn't be ashamed if i said that because that's what he was doing he told me and then he go right out and do the drugs again just see from back and forth see god doesn't want like a back and forth god doesn't want you tossed like waves god wants you anchored praise god amen god wants us anchored into his presence hallelujah amen stable but see the iniquity workers they deny the full power of the holy spirit you see they can do great miracles sometimes but they don't have the miracle of living a righteous life i love how stephen said it stephen said in acts 7 51 stephen rebuked the high priest and the jewish council because they resisted the holy spirit he said because you stiff-necked and uncircumcised in hearts so you always do resist the holy ghost ah that church now look at that the holy spirit was constantly trying to get them to repent constantly doing miracles around them to try to get them to repent and yet they wouldn't yet they they despise the truth they despise even they despise the preaching of christ oh my god and they had the wrong attitude they wouldn't let the they would they would kick against it they would they would reject it they would turn away from it oh but stephen's an example of somebody fully submitted fully yielded fully surrendered to the holy spirit amen so much so we know he wasn't even a preacher yet he preached a powerful message before he died he wasn't even a preacher amen he was a deacon and he preached maybe a 30-minute long sermon there in the book of acts chapter 7 went through the whole history of god saved abraham and and then dave moses and david and solomon and he said but god has wants another house god doesn't live in man's houses god lives in the soul of man hallelujah he brings it down to that yet they resist it and he said you always resist the holy spirit so you see church if there's if we feel like the there's not enough power of the holy spirit that we need to get sincere with god right if we feel like there's there should be another channel i can go up let's get sincere with god let's say god show me where we're uh where i'm falling short i want the full power of god working through my life like i was happy to see it today somebody gave us a real or a nice real kind of new refrigerator and the guy that dropped it off i was looking through that i was like my this is brand new this is free i said praise the lord and looked at me and said oh this is going to be a good wine fridge and i said sir i'm a i'm saying i'm a christian i'm a preacher of the gospel i don't put wine in here i said i'm going to put kombucha in here and he started laughing he's like ah but you should have saw his face changed he went from wine to awesome see that's the power of christ amen to cast down anything that exalts itself against the word of god amen praise god just seeing the power of christ how many times did we wish we would have said something and we did it can we get any can i get an amen on that there's many times i wish i would have said something but i felt the holy spirit rise up with me and say he's not gonna say that in my house are you not gonna say that in my garage no sir i'm a man of god i'm a child of god amen yes i am praise god i want the full power of the holy spirit operating through my life not just a little bit i don't want to deny his power i want to let his power flow through me praise god how do we do that we obey the holy spirit we obey the holy spirit and the power of god flows through us fourth satan's children lie we might lie from time to time brother graham lied to our us but he said he's sorry but satan's children love to lie satan is the liar and the father of lies that's the fourth attribute of cain and satan so the fourth attribute of iniquity they lie all the time john 8 44 says that cain lied to the holy spirit in genesis 4 9. he said i don't know where abel is yet he knew the whole time people said i don't know where the holy ghost is i don't know where the truth is and they're lying they know exactly where it is it's in god's word amen it's preaching this church amen i don't know how to get closer to god i don't know how to make a rapture you liar it's god's word it's god's people it's in god's church judgment begins with the house of god amen amen liars like a man was emailing me this week and said uh i never felt god and there is no god i said sir i said when was the last time you were convicted of sin because that was god the bible said the holy spirit will convict you of sin any person that ever lied any person ever stole any person ever gossiped any person that ever cussed any person ever lost in their heart there was some conviction at some point because the law of god is written their minds and i said sir that was when you felt god and then when he emailed back he totally didn't even said oh he didn't even address it so i emailed him again i said answer that question because the bible said jesus said when the holy ghost has come he'll convict you of your sins oh thank god that we can feel the holy spirit when we fall short of god's glory but that we can leave our sin and we can be washed and walk with jesus and wash our garbage and make them spotless in the blood of the lamb praise god so i never felt the holy spirit yes you do all the time praise god they feel the holy spirit all the time anytime they're convicted they do it the only reason they don't is if they're blasphemed the holy spirit they took a reprobate mind he said how do you know god's alive how do you know the bible's right i gave him all the answers he avoided all those and went off on something else i said the bible's right how do you know you're right i said we got thus saith the lord that's how i know we've got the original faith of paul and peter and james and john we got the original gospel praise god and we see god do some of the original things amen that's right like god talking in your ears saying don't wear those earrings right like god's saying throw out that can of tobacco get rid of that yeah that wasn't me that was god amen it's god speaking to us it's god's presence there is a living god that will just listen to a still small voice satan's children lie most notably peter says in second time or second peter 2 9 most most often preachers lie they promise people things that they themselves never attained pull that application would you uh second peter 2 19. now by god's grace i've tried not to promise anybody anything unless it's something i've received myself i've tried to if i have if i promise you something and you haven't received it god forgive me i don't want to promise anybody anything now what i do church is i try to point to god's promise we all want the rapture well that's going to happen and i'll i i can't promise you'll be there but i can tell you if you obey god's word you'll be there because he said let whosoever will let him come praise god amen he promised that if we just meet his conditions he'll answer our prayers and he'll back up his promise if i can promise you you'll be delivered i can promise you you'll be filled with the holy ghost because it's happened to me god thank god amen thank god for the word of god look they promised them liberty preachers oh you'll be so free yet they themselves are the servants of corruption the whole time they're they're slaves to sin they're addicted to corrupt lives and yet they're promising everybody all these blessings from whom a man is overcome of the same as he brought into bondage i'm glad i'm not addicted to pornography by the amen because i can promise people you'll be delivered oh god i'm not addicted to video games anymore or movies because or sports because i can promise them god will deliver you amen i promised sister barb i said god will deliver you of cigarettes because he delivered me of cigarettes and she got delivered praise god amen i'm not promising people things that i don't know i haven't received the bible says be followers of them who've obtained the promises amen amen hallelujah thank god i'm going to close with the fifth one so just give me two minutes here a few minutes by god's grace there's a real good atmosphere in here tonight praise i feel really free in the holy spirit amen thank god i love that i love to feel free church that and that's the time when you feel free that's the time to receive god's blessing that's the time to speak god's word let the holy spirit flow through you praise god amen and get the victory by the grace of god the fifth one because the sixth one we've already gone over the sixth one was they have worldly sorrow instead of god they saw i preached out of a month or two ago i probably won't spend much time on that one on sunday what that's right we own well yeah we'll only have one service on sunday i gotta go to that graduation party lord willing so the fifth one what is another characteristic of the workers of iniquity they persecute and kill the righteous let's be careful who we're criticizing i've always tried to remember this speak about people as if they were right there standing right there god help us to do that because that would mean we wouldn't we wouldn't persecute someone or gossip about someone right to their face right but the wicked will persecute and kill the righteous lucifer accused heaven's leadership before fighting the war right cain committed the first murder rose up against abel's brother and slayed him in the field jesus christ said murderers will surely perish but he also said you're in danger of hell fire for harboring unjust anger against others if they never hurt anyone this shows us we can murder someone in our hearts even without committing the violent act let's stand to our feet musicians if you'll come you have a psalm in here you know i was telling malachi i said we're going to sing i'm a child of god yes i am at the end of service remember the amen saying it on the second psalm that's a beautiful song by the praise god i just felt like to sing that song i'm going to sing that song today i feel like to sing that it's nice to see the holy spirit give us a witness there praise god you enjoy the word tonight church amen that's why this this mystery is so important so you can see how does the antichrist spirit work it works like this so we do the opposite we value religious acts right we we always tell the truth don't we by god's grace we're not gonna lie we're not gonna leave the truth we're gonna permanently reside in the truth i'm going to stake my claim in the truth i'm not going to despise it i'm going to enjoy it i'm going to be thankful for it you know i had that the same guy that delivered that refrigerator today i'd apologize to him because when he was there the first time i got critical of the first workers that worked at our house i said my they left dents in the walls i said they left awful paint jobs and i was so critical and i was so condemned as soon as he left i thought oh god thank god that the holy spirit was there to convict you and so when he came we got you know just a little uh small talk and pretty soon i said sir i said please forgive me i acted like a christian shouldn't act i said forgive me i was critical of our first workers and he said oh no no it's a i said no sir i said please forgive me i should be thankful and i quote the scripture i said in everything give thanks for this is the will of god in christ jesus see church that's the power of the holy spirit just being able to recognize your sins and then make it right how many believe that yes i i lied right i was critic i was critical i should not have been i mean they might have made some mistakes but i should not have been so critical about it in other words i didn't tell the truth i was critical i made the reputation look bad but but today by god's grace christ was able to wash me clean i was able to do what was right instead of what was wrong how many would raise your hand say brother just pray for me that i will do the attributes of godliness yes church i'm so thankful god has given us these revelations my he sent a prophet
