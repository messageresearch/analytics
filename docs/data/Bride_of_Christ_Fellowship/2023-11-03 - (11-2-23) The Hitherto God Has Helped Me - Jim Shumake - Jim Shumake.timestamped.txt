[5:19] before the Lord and fasted on that day
[5:21] and said there amen we have sinned
[5:23] against the Lord and Samuel judged the
[5:25] children of Israel in mispah and when
[5:27] the Philistines heard that the children
[5:29] were gathered together in mispah the
[5:31] lord of the Philistines went up against
[5:33] Israel and the children of Israel heard
[5:36] it and they were afraid of the
[5:38] Philistines and the children of Israel
[5:40] said to Samuel cease not to cry unto the
[5:42] Lord for us that he will save us from
[5:45] the hand of the Philistines and Samuel
[5:47] took a suckling lamb and offered it for
[5:49] a burnt offering holy unto the Lord and
[5:52] Samuel cried un the lord of the of
[5:54] Israel and the Lord God heard him aren't
[5:57] you glad to know that we can cry unto

[6:00] us amen and Samuel was offering up and
[6:03] as Samuel was offering up the the the
[6:06] burnt offering the Philistines Drew near
[6:08] to battle against Israel but the Lord
[6:11] thundered a great Thunder out on that
[6:13] day upon the Philistines and
[6:15] discomforted them and they were smitten
[6:18] before Israel and the men of Israel went
[6:21] to mispah and pursued the Philistines
[6:23] and smote them until they came to bethar
[6:27] amen and Samuel took a stone own and he
[6:30] set it between mispah and Shen and
[6:33] called the name of it Ebenezer saying

[6:55] again guard my lips Lord God am me let
[6:58] it not be a man's thought Lord Lord God
[6:59] but I believe Lord the spirit of God
[7:01] Amen directed me to go this way tonight
[7:03] Lord God to encourage the people Lord to
[7:06] encourage our hearts as brother Jesse
[7:07] said to revive our faith tonight Lord
[7:09] God Amen we want our faith revived I
[7:12] want my faith revived tonight I want my
[7:14] strength revived tonight Lord God I pray
[7:16] tonight that these words that you placed
[7:18] on this page don't just become something
[7:20] of the past something that we read and a
[7:23] thing of history but Lord God let it be
[7:24] an everpresent word to us tonight Lord
[7:27] God a present help in the time of
[7:29] trouble
[7:29] father God we realize there's trouble
[7:31] all around Lord God there's trouble Amen
[7:33] in each one of our lives but Lord God we
[7:35] know that thou art a God Amen that
[7:37] hither to has helped us and will
[7:39] continue to do so father God we come to
[7:41] you tonight Lord God asking youd have
[7:42] your way among us as we commit our time
[7:44] and ourselves and these people into thy
[7:46] hands in Jesus name amen you can be
[7:48] seated tonight man I want to look at
[7:51] that thought again tonight and U I don't
[7:53] know I just take Liberty sometimes with
[7:55] things the way I see it and uh and it
[7:57] kind of types out you know brother
[7:58] Braham said he was a typologist how many
[8:01] knows he said he was a typologist he
[8:02] looked at some things I said I never saw
[8:04] that as a type like that but you know
[8:06] what he'd Ed these things and he would
[8:07] type them out and I do that sometimes
[8:09] too me and I find a great blessing of it
[8:12] because the the prophet go also said the
[8:14] word is of a manifold interpretation you
[8:16] can say Well it means this or it means
[8:18] that I mean I'm sure it does but it
[8:19] could also mean this or it could also
[8:21] mean that so I want to look at a
[8:23] different May meaning that maybe you've
[8:24] looked at if you've ever read this
[8:25] scripture we find here that Samuel is a
[8:28] prophet how many knows we' had prophet
[8:29] in our day amen and they had a Samuel
[8:32] come the prophet of God he spake un how
[8:34] many knows the word of God always comes
[8:35] to the prophet amen so here it is the
[8:38] word of God Amen is who they are
[8:40] appealing to he said Samuel spake un the
[8:43] house of God to return unto the Lord
[8:45] with all your hearts and put away the
[8:47] strange Gods from before among you and
[8:49] prepare your hearts unto the Lord and
[8:51] serve him only and he will deliver you
[8:54] out of the hand of the Philistines the
[8:55] word of God is coming to the people
[8:57] telling them how to be escaped how how
[8:59] to escape their enemies he's coming
[9:02] through a man by the name of of of
[9:04] Samuel but he's still the word of God
[9:06] still comes to the prophet and it's the
[9:08] word of God that's telling them this
[9:09] isn't just some man's idea he's got an
[9:12] idea from the Lord the word always
[9:14] speaks to his Prophet he's telling them
[9:16] how to be delivered he's not telling
[9:18] them something he hasn't told us too in
[9:20] this hour we've had a prophet in our day
[9:22] tell us the same thing amen you got to
[9:24] turn away from your sin turn away from
[9:26] all those things turn away from serving
[9:27] different God and serve me only amen how
[9:30] many wantes to do that tonight you know
[9:32] I think sometimes we get some Gods set
[9:34] before himen they get in our way amen
[9:36] and he saw the problem the prophet saw
[9:39] the problem he saw that same problem in
[9:40] our day and he said the children of
[9:42] Israel did put away balam and astroth
[9:45] and serve the Lord only how many put
[9:47] away the gods of the old man how many
[9:49] put away the gods of the old man and are
[9:50] trying to serve God to the best of your
[9:52] ability tonight glory amen that means
[9:55] the devil's defeated no he says right
[9:56] here the devil was still fighting or he
[9:59] might be defeated in your life but that
[10:01] doesn't mean he won't come and bother
[10:03] you that doesn't mean he won't come and
[10:04] bother your mind amen it wasn't me he
[10:06] won't come to try and put fear in your
[10:08] heart you know that brother BR said that
[10:10] is the weapon the devil uses most
[10:12] effectively against the bride is fear he
[10:15] tried to get you to fear oh I got a
[10:17] sickness oh I got this I got that oh
[10:19] there's a situation I don't know and
[10:21] fear starts to grip your heart but
[10:22] Church what we got to do is look back
[10:24] here and look at this word and say
[10:26] hither to God had delivered me he will
[10:28] continue to deliver me because he's the
[10:30] same yesterday today and forever how
[10:33] many believes that tonight they put away
[10:36] the God God forgave them of their sins
[10:38] God put them on the right path but the
[10:40] devil was right there Amen to attack
[10:42] them Samuel said gather all the Israel
[10:45] to mbah I will pray for you unto the
[10:46] Lord amen and he gathered together to
[10:49] misbah and they drew water and they
[10:50] poured it out before the Lord and fasted
[10:51] on that day and he said there and and
[10:54] said there we have sinned against the
[10:56] Lord and Samuel judged amen their
[10:58] judgment was passed upon their sins
[11:00] right there that day when the water was
[11:02] poured out how many know there's the
[11:04] Wasing washing water of the word that
[11:06] was poured out for you and me in this
[11:08] hour amen it was poured out and he said
[11:10] right there I offered my I offered up my
[11:13] sacrifice of of the bloody lamb amen and
[11:16] the water washed my sins away and the
[11:19] blood amen covered them amen how many

[11:24] that amen he says and he gathered the
[11:26] children he drew the water poured it out

[11:32] sin was judged there the water washed
[11:34] them away the wash and water the word
[11:36] but was delivering the people from their

[24:43] this oh the greatest of all time
[24:45] preachers I know what you what your
[24:46] pastor teaches on that and I know that

[24:55] greater preachers the likes of the
[24:57] spurge spons and then he goes on and he
[24:59] starts to name I can't remember the
[25:00] message it was in amen but he said the
[25:02] likes of the Spurgeon and and he goes
[25:04] down and names all those oldtime

[33:38] what brother Bram said hither to amen
[33:41] the Lord has helped us how many believes
[33:43] he has up to this pointen but hither to
[33:46] God Amen points to the fact that we
[33:48] haven't got to the end yet and that God
[33:50] is still with us hither to he helped us
[33:53] he's right here helping us today and he
[33:55] will help us tomorrow amen how many
[33:57] believes that he said I want you to

[34:01] problem is don't miss this study it good
[34:03] man has always been this way amen he

[34:13] you know this quote he been you could
[34:15] probably finish it for me he looks
[34:16] forward to what he will do he said but
[34:19] he ignores what God is doing right now
[34:22] and he misses it we miss our we miss our
[34:25] joy we miss our are are leaping about
[34:28] like lands because we think oh God
[34:30] someday he's going to help me know he's
[34:32] a present help right now amen I'm not
[34:35] waiting for him to come on the scene
[34:36] he's on the scene let's just have faith
[34:38] to believe while we're in the midst of
[34:40] the trial amen he says and you missed
[34:43] the whole thing I hope you get that gee
[34:46] he said ignoring what he's doing he
[34:48] knows what he has done I mean how many
[34:50] knows you've been set free from sin how
[34:53] many knows the blood of the Lamb has
[34:55] covered you up how many knows the
[34:57] promises the enemy will not be able to
[34:59] chase you amen why because I put my
[35:01] trust in the blood of Jesus amen he said
[35:04] but he knows the promise what he will do
[35:06] but he fails to see that he's the same
[35:09] yesterday today and forever amen he's
[35:12] not going to deliver he not has
[35:14] delivered he is delivering right in the

[35:43] looking at the problem we get to looking
[35:44] at how big the giant is we get to
[35:46] looking at the situation and our faith
[35:48] starts to WAN how many knows it's true
[35:51] brother Bram said in one place I think I
[35:53] have a quote here some place he said
[35:54] that's because faith is being taught
[35:56] wrong it's not a faith in the future
[35:58] it's not a faith in a god of the past
[36:00] but it's a faith in a present help God
[36:02] right now amen he said oh you

[1:05:12] told him that was able to keep the

[1:06:03] giving God the glory amen oh what a
