========================================

uh here we can see the kind of the context here Hosea is rebuking the people of course and um let's read it here by God's grace so why don't we uh read one and two together then I'll read verse three by myself because it's a little bit longer there so let's read one and two together one two three come and let us return unto the Lord for he hath torn and he will heal us he has smitten and he will bind us up after two days will he revive us in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight now verse three then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord his going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the rain as the latter and former Reign unto the Earth may God add His blessings to rema's word you may be seated praise God now I'm just skipping back back a little bit here uh God bless the live streamers did you start H thank you sweetie uh to to uh CI Scofield's brief notes he says Hosea was a contemporary of Amos in Israel and of Isaiah and Micah in Judah and his ministry continued after the first or Assyrian captivity of the northern kingdom according to 2 Kings 15 his style is abrupt metaphorical and figurative in this book Israel is Jehovah's adulterous wife reput repudiated But ultimately to be purified and restored this is hosea's distinctive message which may be summed up in his two words Lo am I not my people and am I My People Israel is not merely apostate and sinful that is said also but her sin takes its character from the exalted relationship into which she has been brought okay and if you're familiar you know uh chapter three was or chapter one two and three is about the prophet Hosea was called to marry a prostitute right Goomer and it was a sign to all of Israel right Goomer was a type of Israel being so unfaithful to Jehovah right but then God restores Goomer a beautiful type of God going to restore Israel praise God so uh we'll go to chapter six then here by God's grace I'm going to keep reading uh chapter 6 verse4 oh Ephraim what shall I do unto thee Oh Judah what shall I do unto thee for your goodness is as a morning cloud and as a early do it goeth way so there wasn't much goodness left in Israel okay verse 5 then therefore have I hewed them by the prophets I have slain them by the words of my mouth and thy judgments are as light that goeth forth so of course hug means to chop down like a tree right so God sent Prophet after Prophet to Israel right and each time the prophets were chopping them down the judgments repent or perish right and so each time the majority of the people failed to repent right so ultimately led to the Captivity and then we know God showed Daniel God was going to God brought him back right through zerubabel and so forth Ezra Nehemiah we know about that but here uh God says here's how he did it through prophets and the words of God's mouth and the judgments were like light verse six for I desired mercy and and not sacrifice and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings now what's amazing church I mean I I don't know Simon talked about how much he loves animals how many love animals here the amazing amazing part to just hard to understand as much as we love animals Israel would uh would just sacrifice so many animals but without a real sincere heart you know they would they would go to the lengths of of examining the animal make sure it was a good sacrifice the priest could accept it they examined it and yet they would offer in vain right and the the the parallel to that is today people will go to church and pay ties and and do all kinds of religious acts but if their hearts not in it it's still in vain so we want a heart that's into our sacrifice Hallelujah we want a real genuine sacrifice brother McBride preached on that even with u you know fasting there as we looked at in Isaiah 58 Isaiah 58 says they fasted they sought God every day but they only fasted in order to win an argument amongst themselves that's the only reason they would fast but God said the right kind of fast is to afflict your soul and then go feed the poor hallelujah clothe those that are they're naked that's what the Bible says and and then if you focus on others at the fast then God will bring your health forth speedily the Bible says he said then the Bible says then you'll call and I'll answer Hallelujah so we realize fasting is to be for other people praise God but I just think it's is amazing is my brother Simon loves animals you know and uh we love our chickens you know we love our animals too but to think you know what kind of condition someone would have to give in or to be in a a religious I mean an awful religious a bad spiritual state to see their animals killed and not change their life and not honor God right just just obey part of God's word but not all of God's word how many want to be a believer that obeys all of God's word hallelujah that's exactly right I just thought that I just didn't have that in my notes I just thought my what a amazing thing they would let their animals be burnt completely not eat any of the meat and just a total burn offering but then just leave church the same way they came man brother Brooks said this many times maybe I'm kind of preaching for him because he'll be here this weekend but uh brother Brooks said many times when I come to church I want to leave changed am and brother Brooks said he's learned that over the years you know my wife and I know when we first come in the message and everything it was so glorious but brother Brooks has told us you know he used to focus so much on the the noise and the the worship and the the clapping and you had to have a loud clap had to have a loud shout you know loud scream but brother Brook said he learned over the years that's fine but if your life isn't changed after the service it doesn't do any good right right and we get the same idea here what good is animal sacrifices if your life isn't changed Hallelujah verse so just important there to know verse 7even but they like men have transgressed the Covenant they there they have dealt treacherously against me so see they sacrifice animals they go through all this religious acts but they transgress other elements of the Covenant and church let's just be honest you know God knows our hearts Hal and God knows if we want to keep the Covenant Hallelujah God will help us keep the Covenant Hallelujah if we really want to keep it God will help us do it Hallelujah but we have to be willing to surrender everything to God and we know church we know we're the we're the one who gets to look in the mirror every night right before bed we know forgiving all we can for Jesus Christ Hallelujah and any shortcomings at the end of the day what do we say Lord Jesus forgive me help me tomorrow Hallelujah let me be an overcomer let me wake up with new mercies tomorrow morning Hallelujah verse 8 Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity and is polluted with blood so again look at this idea of iniquity make God help us not to be workers of iniquity iniquity means lawlessness so see church if if if if the holy spirit is convicting you to keep the word of God you are not a worker of iniquity you're a worker of righteousness see and make sure our works aren't polluted you know are we have to ex ask ourselves is there any pollution in our text messages is there is there any pollution in our emails is there any pollution in what we're setting before our eyes is there any pollution in our words may God help us to have pure words Hallelujah pure actions P pure motive and objective Hallelujah is the motive and objective pure amen hallelujah so see we get a lot of good understanding in here we can apply to the New Testament right because Jesus said in Matthew 7 uh many will come in that and they say Lord did we not cast out Devils did we not prophesy in thy name and done many everybody say many many wonderful works these these were people that did many wonderful works and they'll say depart from me you workers of iniquity I never knew you because you did not do the will of my father that's interesting people can do Supernatural Miracles and prophecies but that isn't all the will of the father there's more to the message there's more to the Bible than just Supernatural works there's obedience hallelujah amen but we got to have both Hallelujah by God's grace amen now verse eight and as troops of robbers wait for a man so the company of priests murder in the way by consent for they commit lewdness now murder now remember Jesus says for us we none of us are murderers of course but Jesus said if you call your brother a fool without a cause you're in danger of Hellfire he says right of course Jesus is going to Great Lengths like hyperbole right he says pluck out your eye if you're lusting right cut off your hand if you're stealing he's he's showing us these these are serious matters if you don't stop that sin it's going to control you it's going to take your life you got to go to Every length to live a Pure Life Hallelujah go to go to the lengths necessary to live a pure and Godly life Hallelujah verse 10 I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel there is whoredom of Ephraim Israel is defiled now of course this could be natural whoredom like adulteries or fornications or homosexuality or beastiality or it could also be spiritual whoredoms remember we saw the quote brother Simon preach it on Sunday the same spirit that produces natural adultery or fornication is the Same Spirit of denominations and Antichrist Spirits Same Same Spirit think about that when a person falls in love with their church more than they fall in love with the word of God right and the way to know is you ask them uh well what what's true is the Bible true is your Church's Creed true and if they side with their Church it shows they love their church more than God's will word right is God is God three persons or one well if you love your church you'll say three persons right but if you love God you'll say God's one person Hallelujah that's true Hallelujah if you love your church you'll say well father son Holy Ghost sprinklings okay but if you love God you'll say full immersion in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ baptism right if you love your church you'll say women can preach but if you love God's word you'll say women are not called to have authority over men Hallelujah that's that's the word of God Amen that's right amen glory verse 11 also oh Judah he has set in Harvest for thee when I return to the Captivity of my people course speaking of when they come back right with Zur he's speaking of the Harvest there okay now I got a lot of quotes from Brother brandom here I'll try to get through uh as much as I can here by the grace of God now we seen that song then I heard recognizing your day anybody raise your hand if you've heard that sermon who's heard that sermon anybody heard that one lately okay maybe maybe one late one okay great great message I encourage you it's less than two hours so if you haven't listened to it i' would encourage you go listen to it I'm going to just hit the highlights here brother random reads Hosea 6 and says this is a type or a foreshadow of the condition we're currently in right now right and it's true right God's people were backsliding and if you look at America and most Christian churches most Christian churches are backsliding right because they add to the word of God or they take away and there's severe repercussions for that right so brother Adam says now he says in the 12th paragraph I want to say that this has been the hardest message I ever did try to prepare until last night brother Ram goes through all these things he went through he was it was hot he was tired he was falling asleep just fun kind of funny he ate some corn the night before and it didn't sit well in his stomach so he felt sick and he tried for a couple of days days to get a thought and he couldn't get a thought he said he went down to the basement to cool down and he fell asleep trying to read his Bible and as a preacher I can say Amen sometimes I've been so tired I've tried to study but I fall asleep sometimes right most preachers can relate to that or anybody trying to study right try to study God's word you fall asleep said it was just so hot there in uh uh this would have been uh July he said uh but then he said about 8 o'clock this morning so 8 o'clock on that Sunday morning he happened to pick up that scripture and that astounded me so think about that Hosea 61-13 the whole chapter astounded brother brandom he said uh so it may seem the Lord has a message for us this morning that Satan has tried to keep from us hallelujah and then I just want to say you know brother Ram says this message here uh recognizing your day and it's message he says is a teaching message he said I had two other services or sermons I was going to preach on broken sisters how many heard that one all right okay and then sewing to the wind and we reaping the Whirlwind brother Ram said those are just he said just gospel messages so brother R says there's two kind of sermons there's teaching sermons and there's just general gospel good news messages okay that's important to know because there's that that's still true today there's deep teaching and then there's also just general uh truth that we declare called gospel messages right um the Bible said Jesus the Bible calls it preaching and teaching the Bible said John the Baptist Jesus and the the apostles they went preaching and teaching okay so when they had to really instruct to show somebody how to do something or something important they would teach it through the word of God they instruction instruction instruction but if there's just a a if there's just a a preaching message just to declare what God is and what God's done then we just call it a preaching sermon preaching means to declare hallelujah thank the Lord amen so remember just two kinds uh there there's two kinds of services preaching and teaching Hallelujah now as brother Rams praying before he reads his text he said dear God we're unworthy to take this book into our hands for we read in the scripture that no man in heaven or Earth or beneath Earth was worthy to even take the book or look upon it how many remember that Revelation chapter 5 he says but one like a lamb came and took the book he looked like he'd been slain he was worthy and we're looking to him this morning to reveal that these contents that's written the book because it's the book of redemption hallelujah amen so church that's what we need tonight we need Jesus to reveal the contents of this scripture to us tonight hallelujah amen and then he reads Hosea 6 1-1 now the next thought he brings out that the ones I'm going to highlight brother Ram said uh now the week before he preached on the the trumpet the trumpets of Israel the seven trumpets he said and I thought they would Break Forth just like like the Seven Seals did now who remembers how the Seven Seals broke open every day the Holy Ghost would visit brother brandom and show him the Revelation on the seal and then he'd spend the rest of the day' see a vision or a dream or an angel will visit him he'd spend the rest of the day going through the concordance and making sure this Revelation lined up with the Bible because galatian 1 said though we or an angel preach anything other than what we've received let it be cursed amen that's a real Prophet right there an angel would visit brother Ram shown the revelation he take the rest of the day to make sure that angel was the right kind of Angel that's a real man of God brother Ram said though I thought the the trumpets now remember the seven trumpets right in Revelation chapter 8 and N he said I thought they would break open just like that he said but they didn't he said I've noticed he said uh that it was different and so we'll get to the answer in just a little bit here by God's grace Hallelujah now the next quote I want to read is brother Ram said you see before the Seven Seals that hid all the mysteries of the Bible so when brother Ram uh was led by the Holy Spirit to give us the revelations of the Seven Seals from the Holy Spirit it gave us Insight on all the Mysteries and that's what I wrote my 2021 book about the 12 New Testament Mysteries he said and he said uh these things are revealed so we'll know the very spiritual application of this hour and then he said the next next message that opened up the Seven Seals which undone all the hidden mysteries of the Bible the doctrines and so forth so brother Ram tells us when he got the revelation of the Seven Seals it was March 1963 all the symbols in there of the horse riders the colors right all the symbols of the Seven Seals gave interpretation helped us interpret interpret the rest of the scripture hallelujah amen hallelujah because we see that we see that in Revelation uh six Jesus Takes the the seals he breaks the seals in Revelation 10 that open book now comes down to earth right and and a seventh angel finishes the mystery of God that was brother br's Ministry and then John said I've got to eat it I got to take it to Every Nation well anyone that studies history knows John never did that so that means somebody else like John it would be the Believers the Believers would have to eat the Revelation and then prophesy again to many kindreds nations peoples and tongues amen and then that goes with Matthew 24:14 Jesus said the end cannot come until the gospel has been preached to Every Nation so every nation still needs to hear the Revelation that God gave to brother brandom that's the best that I can understand it by God's grace amen hallelujah now the next I want to just read this one here uh brother R was talking about he says another thing he said the Bible said whoever whoever will take one word away or add one word to it in Revelation 2218 and 19 he said said people put their own interpretation upon the word as it's been given trying to make it say something it did not say and he said and not my word it's his word so clearly brother R was saying it's not every word on my sermons it's the word that comes from the Holy Spirit that's the word you can't add to that's the word you can't take away from Hallelujah this right here hallelujah amen that's exactly right now brother Brandon wanted to preach those seven trumpets of Revelation 8 and9 he said I told my wife I'm going in to pray and I sincerely knelt down before God to pray and he revealed to me them seven trumpets sounded under the six seal and I've already done preached it supernaturally hallelujah praise God see it's the hand of God the whole thing it pertains to Israel amen so see Church the seven trumpets pertain to Israel Hallelujah that's right and we picked it up on under the Sixth Seal all you who have that now how the persecution of the Jews now if you got your Bible go to Revelation 6 keep your spot there in Hosea if you want to go to Revelation 6 let's read that six seal by God's grace now how many was expecting a book of Roman sermons tonight Hallelujah I about did but then I was like well I got six hours to drive I need to hear some more from Brother bradam here by God's grace I've always wanted to preach those five sermons see you kind of close together so you when you sang that song you'd appreciate that song If you haven't heard the message of Grace go listen to that one I heard that that years ago I preached on that years ago it's a beautiful message brother R just shows how every believer amen down through the Old Testament New Testament every believer needed God's grace Hallelujah and we need it to we need it today Hallelujah even Paul said Jesus told him my grace is sufficient for you even when God doesn't answer God doesn't heal God doesn't do something you want God's grace is still sufficient hallelujah it's still by Grace not by works it's the grace of almighty God remember Paul said I labored more more than all the apostles not I but the grace of God that was given to me Hallelujah it all goes back to Grace Hallelujah so let's go to Revelation 6 I believe it's I don't remember the verse maybe it's verse six Revelation 66 uh 69 Hallelujah Revelation 69 so brother Ram said during this time this is a time period no I'm sorry it's not verse N9 it's verse 12 sorry Revelation 612 now verses 9 10 and 11 though deal with Israel We Believe brother Rod the souls under the altar were the blinded Jews that have been blinded since the days of Jesus crucifixion all the way to the current day because Revelation Romans 11 says Israel was blinded that God might Graft in the Gentiles now we believe that brother because brother brandom said thus sayith the Lord that's the interpretation so we just humbly we believe that was God it's it's quite a statement and and to prove it in in the fif seal they had the testimony for the word of God which they they didn't have the testimony for Jesus Christ that's also mentioned in Revelation chap 1 and then they say they asked for revenge for their blood and a Christian never asked for Revenge because Jesus said lay it not to their charge right and so did stepen step said don't lay it to their charge so only a person who wasn't born again would ask for revenge and then uh more of their servants had to be killed of course that's could be the 144,000 in the tribulation period we're not quite sure but there's more Jews that need to be killed um because they said let his blood be upon us and our children was that such a sad thing to say but that's what blinded people would say they would crucify their own Messiah that was sent to them but now verse 12 is where we want to go brother Ram said the seven trumpets were supernaturally preached they're part of The Sixth Seal in other words The Sixth Seal is the seven-year tribulation period now some people think it's three and a half I believe it's seven it don't matter it don't pertain to us anyway praise God so let's not get upset with each other let's love each other amen hallelujah let's hope it's three and a half years but I believe it's seven I mean I believe I can prove that by history Daniel 70 weeks of course and the scripture but it doesn't matter you know we just don't want to be here by God's grace we want to be with Jesus in Glory Hallelujah verse 12 and I beheld and lo when he had opened the sick seal Lo there was a great earthquake now that might be the earthquake brother bam said thus say the Lord Los Angeles will fall into the ocean that might be that I don't know and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood and the stars of Heaven fell into the Earth think about that what would one star do if it fell to the Earth this says the Stars so more than one star falls to the Earth even as a fig tree castes her untimely figs when she's shaken of A Mighty Wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it's rolled together and every mountain and Island were moved out of their places think of Philippines right think of Japan think of Hawaii all these islands are moved out of their places verse 15 and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the Mighty Men And every Bond man every free man hid themselves in the dens and the rocks of the mountains and said of the mountains and rocks Fallen us and hide us from the face of him that sth on the throne and from the Lamb of sorry from the Wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath is come and who shall be able to stand and so we're not going to read it but if you read Revelation 8 and N is it 10 to let me check I can't no it's not 10 it's 8 just 8 nine that's right eight and nine yes 8 n there's seven trumpets and it all speaks of judgment each of the seven trumpets speak even the first one a third of the waters turned to blood and a third of all the trees are burned with fire a third think about the Amazon rainforest a third just on the first trumpet that's God's Wrath that's not God's mercy that's God's judgment but brother ad said see I was I thought when I preached the the the seven trumpets they'd open up just like the Seven Seals but brother man said I already preach them they're part of The Sixth Seal they're part of the Great Tribulation period all right now that might be a little deeper so I'm sorry if that's a little deeper now I want you to go back to uh Hosea 6 I hope you kept your spot there I I said I guess I didn't tell you to do it for sure but verse two Hosea 62 after two days he'll revive us in the third day he'll raise us up and we shall live in his sight now brother Bram starts preaching at this point and brother brandom says after two days means after 2,000 years God will raise Israel up and I think that's absolutely right if Jesus was crucified around 30 or 33 ad look Church we're coming up to the 2,000 years we are getting very close because the B Peter said a day with the Lord right is as a thousand years with man so brother R he prophetically says Hosea was prophesying to Israel after two two days after 2,000 years I'm going to revive you through the 144,000 of Revelation chapter 7 12,000 from each tribe hallelujah amen Hallelujah and then the third day so beginning that third thousand year right because after 2,000 years you begin that third day or that third group of a thousand uh Years brother bam said oh how thankful how no wonder we're so grateful I feel we're not grateful enough for the great things God is making known to us he said my he said after two days he'll revive us he said give us a Revival bring us together he's speaking of the Jews on these trumpets Hallelujah and we shall live in his sight again or have eternal life we'll be in his sight again the Bible said here in Hosea we shall live in his sight that's his own life eternal life right because there's only one kind of life that's that's going to be Eternal that's God's life Allelujah there's natural life we live and die and that's true but God's life is the only eternal life Hallelujah God's going to give us life we want eternal life where we'll never die Hallelujah and then brother man brings out that great scripture out of Timothy she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she's alive that's speaking of the Soul right because a woman who live lives in pleasure she's alive naturally her body's got natural life but her soul is not quickened right Paul said we were dead in sins but we've been quickened by the life of God hallelujah amen in Ephesians chapter 2 glory amen hallelujah Glory he said after two days in the third day he'll revive us again and give us life in his sight there's your trumpets coming in that's the hour We're living the day that we're living Hallelujah now brother Ram brings this thought out here brother Ram said there was a magazine in' 64 it was called The Herald of his coming now I've never seen that one he said uh brother Jack Moore and his wife put that magazine out do you know Jack Moore brother okay he was associated with brother brandom for the beginning part of brother br's Ministry Jack Moore he was a Pentecostal Man by God's grace but they put out this um he said they put out their magazine the Herold of his coming now if you've been around the message for a while you've heard this quote before so just bear with me if you haven't uh then probably haven't been around the message too long but it's okay so he said their magazine you see it all the time they say fast pray fast pray it's all you hear fast pray we're going to have a great breaking of the day this is a great thing going to happen all of you pray pray pray we're not too late yet he says now why do they do that they want a Great Awakening they're crying believing they'll be Awakening they're good people why is it what have they done now look what he says here this is the quote I'm going to say they haven't recognized The Awakening of the Bride so brother saying there's these Pentecostal people they're saying fast and pray we might have a Revival might have Awakening yet but brother man said the bride has already been awakened through his ministry I know that sounds crazy but that's what every Prophet had Hallelujah right you the only way you could be awakened in John the Baptist day is to receive John the Baptist right I mean it's it was that way every day Hallelujah and the proof of it brother Ram said was all these Pentecostal people that rejected his message they broke the word of God they had adulteries fornications the women cut their hair and God never asked a Godly woman to ever cut her hair right she wore makeup and paint she painted her face up uh living worldly doing all these kind of sins men smoking cigarettes and doing all kinds of wickedness watching dirty movies dirty magazines and calling themselves is Pentecostal that's not Pentecostal amen Pentecostal is Holiness with power Hallelujah Holiness with power I'll just say this humbly I believe the power of just last Wednesday night's prayer allowed that young man to get saved That's The Power of Pentecost if I can't do it God will send somebody to do it praise God Amen just in the Simplicity of prayer and sincerity Hallelujah because we don't live worldly lives we sh we we do all we can to shun evil amen we do all we can Church to abstain from wickedness Hallelujah daily confessing our sins Hallelujah recognizing if the Bible's right and I'm wrong then I want to I want to be right I want to confess and I want to be like the Bible amen I want to obey the Bible not uh not not a Creed not a church not a denomination I want to be a real Christian hallelujah amen glory so brother said they haven't awaken recognized The Awakening of the Bride but by being a Christian they feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done that's what's making them feel that way they know something's supposed to happen but you see they're looking for it the way off in the future to come but it's already happened right by you so think about that brother BR my goodness brother R if you haven't listened to one of his sermons he'll bring up sometimes five 10 15 people and just tell them the thoughts and intents of their heart I mean there's no way a man could memorize that many details about somebody I don't care what they say oh he can memorize those prayer cards no way not after preaching through hours amen it's impossible and they didn't have those ear devices back then it was a gift of God Amen he's standing there and said I'm waiting I can't do it I'm waiting for the angel of the Lord to come Hallelujah glory and the Pentecost people would say oh we like his gift but we don't like his Doctrine well if his Doctrine is the Bible then you don't like the Bible I listened to a podcast this week and they went through you know how or Roberts was off the word uh you know into money and prosperity and they named all these other guys that fell into I think a Allen fell into alcohol and God for go God forgive me if I'm wrong but they just went through all these sins and this person went into fornication adultery and the only negative thing they could say about brother brandom was he got off on his Doctrine but anybody that studies it knows it's the right Doctrine right no women preaches there's no Trinity hell doesn't last eternally right it was created for the devil and Angels if it had a beginning it's got to have an ending right all these Revelations God gave to brother Brandon with thus sayeth the Lord and we can back it up by the Bible Hallelujah I just I was so happy listen to that even though they were bashing our Prophet I was so happy that's the only thing they can say they don't agree with his Doctrine but he lived a holy life and the power of the Holy Ghost was on his life amen Glory Hallelujah they just disagree with his Doctrine amen hallelujah and then brother R would challenge them and say there's 400 preachers out there he said come he said you disagree with me on the serpant seat on the water baptism on no women preachers he said I challenge you bring your Bible up here and stand before me and disprove me now he said it was the quietest group of preachers you ever heard see in the presence of that angel they wouldn't challenge the angel of the Lord hallelujah it's exactly right and brother Ram said what are they doing he said those Pentecostals were fasting and praying believing for the ministry of the two prophets let's read the ministry of the two prophets keep your spot there in Hosea go to Revelation 11 so hope by the end of this you'll be edified but I'm also hoping you'll be able we'll be able to sing that song with a little better understanding I'm so glad God let me here recognizing your day in this message amen it's Elementary it's very simple right it's a it's a wonderful simple message but I just want you to have an experience of it and know some of the major quotes in here and sermons and scriptures I'm sorry scriptures brother R used in this sermon okay everybody got that by God's grace okay now verse three Revelation 11:3 and I'll give power to my two witnesses and they shall prophesy 1,2003 score days clothe and sackcloth these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth that's also in Zechariah Chapter 4 and if any man will hurt them fire proceeds out of their mouth and devour their enemies and if any man will hurt them he must in this manner be killed these have power to shut the heaven that it rain out in the days of their prophecy and have power over Waters to turn them to blood and to Smite the Earth with all plagues as often as they will now see church this is what brother brother said this is is what the Pentecostals were praying for power like this to turn the waters to blood and and power to shut the heavens brother Ram said they're missing that's not for the Gentiles that's for the Jews and we just saw it with that solar eclipse didn't we we see all these Gentile preachers say this solar eclipse is and they use the scriptures they use these scriptures to say it's for the Gentiles and it's not they missed it those signs are for the Jews right everybody catch that they even use that verse where Jesus said uh uh the sign of Jonas will that's the only sign that will be given to this uh generation because they said the uh the path of the shadow of the solar eclipse passed through Seven Cities called Nineveh that's totally out of context when Jesus quoted that scripture he's saying the sign of Jonah is I'll be in the heart of the Earth from Friday to Sunday but I'll raise up Sunday morning Hallelujah that's the sign of Jonas amen not a solar eclipse or a lunar eclipse or any Eclipse that's not a sign to the Gentiles all of that is to the Jews so here we are what was that 64 59 I'm sorry 60 years 60 years ago and there we're still in the same condition the churches think all these signs all these signs and the blood moon and and the eclipse they think that's for the Gentiles no that's going to be for the Jews after the Rapture and they haven't recognized that God's got a bride awake do we have any bride members in here that are awake to the gospel Hallelujah I like a hearty Amen on that one by God's grace amen try not to pull I'm try not to beg to for too many amens Hallelujah I think we ought to have a hearty amen for that I know I was blind to denominations I know I'm awaken to the message of God hallelujah I know my life has changed Hallelujah the power of God is on my life it's on your life amen we're awakened to the the the the bride and the going home of the Bride of Jesus Christ the Gentile Rapture hallelujah we're awakened to that we're not going to miss that that's basically what brother sermon is about recognizing your day amen the Gentile Rapture and its message Hallelujah Oh Glory we see Pentecostals they get and other people too not just I'm not down in Pentecostals I love them I'm against the system I'm not against the people just like I'm I'm against I'm not against evangelicals I'm just against the denominational systems so whether it's Catholic or Protestant whatever it is uh denominational non-denominational we're against their transgressions of the word of God and their systems that won't allow them to accept more Revelation right they write their bylaws and that's it God can't do nothing else well shame on them they should have they should have ended their Creed with a comma brother and I ended my book with a comma just so you know as a tribute to brother brandom because brother Bram said all the Christians when you got a Doctrine you should end that Doctrine with a comma not a period I know everything we don't know everything but as much as God has revealed to us we keep that until more comes Hallelujah we know God will never bring us a a different Revelation than he's already give us but he'll give us more information about the same Revelation hallelujah oh I feel good tonight hallelujah praise God I didn't feel good a few hours ago so thank God for that we had some more attacks on our identity theft but I was really mad so I feel better now by God's grace took a little singing and a little repenting by God's grace my goodness these people are wicked anyways thank God for the Holy Ghost Hallelujah Now Catch This brother Ram said Hosea in in Hosea chapter 6 he said said the same thing John the Revelator said in in the leoan letter in Revelation 3 so let's read that we're already in Revelation 11 let's go to Revelation 3 I believe it's 14 I'm just kind of ballparking there the letter to Le oosa was it uh 14 oh it is 14 glory and the angel of the Church of leans write these things say at the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou are neither hot nor cold does that sound like Hosea they got iniquity they're murdering yet they're sacrificing animals they have a they have a form of godliness but denying the power thereof the power to live a holy life Hallelujah I would thou W cold or hot finishing 15 going to 16 so then because thou are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I'm rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire now gold is time tested Faith that's what Peter said the trying of your faith is more precious than what good church good and that thou mayest be rich and white reignment that thou mayest be clothed now white Rond is Jesus's rightousness right Revelation 19 tells us that so the way you the way you have white rment on is you accept Jesus righteous and not try to make your own righteousness amen I have no righteousness brother Rod sister Zer I have no righteousness if anything good comes out of my life it's Christ righteousness hallelujah amen that thou mayest be clothed and that th shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with Isa that thou mayest see eyes is always understanding Enlightenment the Bible said Paul said our eyes must be enlightened with understanding so it's spiritual understanding as many as I love I baby no did I read that right no as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent brother Ram said the same spirit that spoke through Hosea spoke through John and said then the church in the last days will be naked blind and will put him outside the church remember he's on the church saying let me in outside the church saying let me in the church now of course that can apply to the individual but also the church because we know a lot of churches I'm sure robod does too we know a lot of churches where the Holy Ghost can't even get inside one of the members right he can't even convince one member to repent of their sins right but yet they go through the works they go through the acts they go through the sacrifices but they haven't repented of their sins Hallelujah because their churches allow them to live in sin that's right yeah they encourage it absolutely so isn't that something who would have thought who would have thought uh if you read Hosea last week who would have thought if you read Hosea 6 wow that's just what John said but the Holy Ghost showed to brother Brandon and church remember I preached uh remember when I preached the Christian family the prosperity trap all those verses are applying to the ly and church age because they're rich and increased with good Havey nothing in other words always Israel once they got the blessing they got rich that's when they forgot about God it's a general principle like I'm just saying right it's it's not nothing you haven't heard before I'm just saying just apply that to today Hosea said they were Rich they were sacrificing but they didn't repent they weren't repenting they were just sacrificing right but the sacrifices of God are a broken and contrite heart when was the last time you cried over your sin when was the last time we cried over someone else's sin that's what we need a a sincerity a humility praise God a hatred for sin Hallelujah he said they just didn't get it those uh Jews of hosea's day much like the Jews of Old Times blinded leod DEA today riches theology hostile with the church hostile towards the message aren't they hostile towards brother R's message look how hostile those Jews was with John look how hostile they were with Jesus Jus and he was the very one they claimed they were looking for my goodness and then brother Ram breaks into this he goes uh he shows how uh most people failed to recognize Noah's day in its message they missed it only eight people caught it and Jesus said as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the days of the coming of the son of man so it's going to be a very small group he said Moses made the people ready for their Exodus they recognize their day and its message brother said they did not recognize John the Baptist in his message most of them didn't he said but the woman at the well recognized her day in its message Jesus discerned the thoughts and intents of her heart and she said I perceive you are a prophet amen we can look at brother R's life I perceive he's a prophet Hallelujah his sermons answered my questions hallelujah amen brother ra taught me how to cast out Devils by pointing me back to the Bible amen I literally seen the words of the Bible come off the pages brother Ro brother R pointed me there I preach them and I literally seen them come to life hallelujah amen oh my it's a reality brother said Jesus was the interpretation of the scripture his life interpreted the scripture amen hallelujah I'm having a good time tonight by God's grace oh I love this message bye brother said don't you see the message of this hour can you recognize where we are the message itself from the scripture interprets you the hour that we're living in so see brother Ram says it's the scripture that helps you recognize the day we're living in right not just brother Ram's words because brother Rod brother brandom's family well some of not all it some of his family has started like a worship of brother brandham they say only listen to brother brandom don't have preachers anymore just press play and Obey they sit at home they don't even go to church anymore it's so simp that so that that's why I bring some of those things up I got to I got to separate brother brandom from the word because brother Bram he said I'm not the word Jesus is the word amen the word was made flesh and dwell Among Us Hallelujah in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the word got a good Bible Church here hallelujah and remember Church there's 30 verses I made that remember I taught the Sunday school kids that 30 verses brother man gave us 30 verses on what the message is what do the message today he said it's Acts Chapter 2 get the Holy Ghost be baptized in Jesus Christ's name how many you believe that Glory I'm going to read a few more I'm not going to read all Malachi 45 and 6 turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers right turn the hearts of the the children at the second coming back to the hearts of the Believers at the first coming right because John turned the hearts of the uh Believers at Jesus first coming he turned their hearts to the Believers at the second coming they were all looking for the coming of Jesus he said Revelation 10 1-7 is is the message of this hour Matthew 20:6 the 11th Hour worker is the message of this hour Hallelujah he said Revelation 18:4 brother Simon preached it come out of her my people and be not partakers of her sins and plagues come out of denominational systems Matthew 25 1-13 the parable of the wise and foolish virgins that's a great Revelation to me brother Rod when Jesus showed us that there's two kinds of Christians there's a wise Christian who's got the oil and there's a Christian who's pure but she got the oil Hallelujah it was a great Revelation and you can see it all through the Bible Abraham was the type of the wise lot was the type of the foolish right hallelujah oh you can find all through the Bible Jesus right and then you got the thief on the cross right Jesus was the the full the fullness of the word Thief barely got saved right at the end Hallelujah see to all through the scripture uh there's more many more there I have 30 on that video if you want to watch that yeah the the fivefold ministry Ephesians 4 6 18 he said that's the message of the hour sure the bride has PA Apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors is that right he said the bride of Christ now I'm not going to go through all of them I'll wear you out I'll wear myself out here you can go watch that we've been through that here by God's grace okay now brother Ram uses Hosea 6 I'm gonna go back there hope I kept my place there trying to finish this up here by God's grace now verse uh speaks of the hueing verse five now brother Mar gives us also a different thought on this here verse five therefore have I hewed them by the prophets I have slain them by the words of my mouth and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth brother says this he says I Hosea said I have Hue now why Israel is talking to I have hewed or other words I've chopped them out through the prophets that's how God does his people he chopped them out from the rest of the Nations by what his two-edged sword his word so now brother is giving a positive application to this remember John said the ax is laid to the root of every tree right but now brother R says but you could also chop just to get a certain piece of wood out there right you could use the wood right we know lots of people that burn wood right and so they'll chop it up to get they'll use that wood for a good purpose or how about those uh how about those Amish people that make some good Amish furniture down there right Jake's Amish that's where we got that uh shelf out there Jake's armish furniture they do a good job chopping out that wood they use it for God's glory to help his people he said he chopped them his Nation from the Nations I like that Israel was a was a people out of the Nations right and now the Bride is a people out of the Nations the New Testament bride he said so has he chopped his bride from the denomination oh glory amen by the power of His word hallelujah he promised by Malachi 45 and6 that Elijah would turn the hearts that's our hearts back to our fathers in the last day chopped out his bride hewed her from the rest of the churches he hewed out his bride so brother gives us that illustration God saw you and I in this tree and he chopped us out and now he's got his bride Hallelujah that's a good application like that too Hallelujah good thought now brother is bringing this down to the close it's in paragraph 191 he said now the church the's speaking of like the people that have rejected his message that the church has not recognized her day like Israel Israel's forced back to Palestine she's going to be forced in the world Council of churches why she didn't recognize her Hour come out of her my people be not partakers of her sins flee your life or you'll be caught up with the mark of the beast and can't do no nothing else about it right we see the current Administration now uh all this uh persecution on Christians well at some point the government is going to unite with the churches and if you're not with them at some point maybe our lifetime maybe not you can't buy or sell church it's never been this close before it it it shocks me every day almost to see some of the news things I honestly brother Rod I don't think I ever thought I'd see it my day you know I just but it's it's happening so rapidly the persecution against Christians right and you see this week they're they're chanting death to America well what does that mean it doesn't mean the name America is going to be removed it's going to mean they're going to kill all the Christians because that's what America's about freedom of religion right that's what they're trying to do take get rid of the Christians because they stand for truth they don't want they don't care necessarily if the name changes that's not what they care about they care about taking away the right the protection where they and then you can't buy or sell without the mark of the beast that's what they want because then they have death right that's what they want death to the Believers that's right but said Flee for Your Life that's the message that's recognizing your day and its message let him that's filthy be filthy still let him that's holy not will be holy Hol is now hallelujah how many Are Holy right now by God's grace the Bible said that Jesus made the church holy unblameable unreprovable without spot or blemish Church you're holy if you're trusting in Jesus tonight Hallelujah not your Holiness Christ's Holiness in you amen amen that's right Glory brother says not a bobbed haired woman because remember if she dishonors it that word dishonor means a repulse it's a dishonor for a woman to cut her hair the same for a man to grow his hair out like a woman same thing it's it's a repuls thing to God repulsive it's disgusting thing to God she can't be the bride that sounds very flat but that's the scripture 1 Corinthians 11 1-16 the Bible says she dishonors her head and her head is her husband and his head is Christ so she dishonors Christ said how can she be dishonorable or repulsive and not be filthy let him that's filthy be filthy still it's it's really something Church really something people better be praying for God's grace they better be repenting Hallelujah if they want to be saved he said okay I'm going to move on because I got to close it's already 8 o'clock man see how much more I got I really don't want to do a part two on this I'd like to finish it here tonight and church you know oh yeah I also got uh I got uh brother Brooks coming this week and then next Sunday we got brother Keith Randol coming but I'm going to be at Junction City so that's three Sundays in a row you don't have to hear me preach no that's a joke I know you enjoy hearing me preach man it just gives it a break um brother Keith member lost his wife and he said Thank You Jesse this means so much to me to invite me I need to stay busy because I've lost my wife so I said yeah brother you come preach for us right and last time you preached brother cams asked brother cam they had a real move of the Holy Ghost people are shouting rejoicing down at the altar screaming praying just getting some victories amen getting some Deliverance Hallelujah so it's all about our approach right and the of course the timing of God but we want to be under the blood of Christ we want to have all of our sins confessed and expect God to move amen he said now look Israel she's back in her Promised Land he said uh National Force put Israel back in her promis land all the nations right National Force will put the church in the world Council of churches for the mark of the beast but the power of God will put the people in The Bride Hallelujah nobody's going to force us to be in the bride God's power puts us in the bride Hallelujah is that what you believe didn't God put you in the bride didn't God's power bring you to this word hallelujah I didn't force you to come to church tonight God brought you to church tonight Hallelujah God put you in the bride amen hallelujah the spirit of God which is the word of God my word is spirit and my word is life will put the bride into her place because she'll recognize her position in the word that she's in Christ will put her in her place no National Force will do it the National Force did Drive Israel to the Homeland he said but the power of God will raise the bride into Glory out of it oh people recognize your day as Jesus warned you the sign of Sodom right as it was the days of Noah as it was in the days of lot Luke 17 26-30 that's another scripture about the day that we're living in and the church's condition of this day Hallelujah so see brother man says we must recognize our day and our message and we have Hallelujah now I'm going to skip over some of this because I want to finish this here brother Bram said don't miss it today he said recognize the day and the signs recognize where Israel's at and where the bride is he said look where the bride is standing you see where we're standing Church we're standing on the word of God chur Church think about this we're standing in a spot where America is falling apart it is literally falling apart around us literally the the the judge sorry the the Judicial Systems uh uh the Justice systems I everything is politics uh the financial systems everything is falling apart and yet we're standing here recognize we're the bride we're the bride we're the bride amen Jesus loves us amen hallelujah I love Jesus and he loves me amen am has never been like this in America and here we're at this time if there's any ever a time we need to recognize our day's message it's right now Hallelujah brother Ram said the majority of churches have rejected the very message God sent to them what is this message it's basically it's the book of Acts restored it's Paul's letters restored hallelujah it's the Mysteries revealed it's the bride get the oil ready go out to meet the bridegroom Amen brother R restored Jesus said in Matthew 17:11 he said Elijah will surely come and restore all things that was brother Adam's Ministry at the Spirit of Elijah to restore the apostolic Doctrine to finish the mystery of God to restore our faith in the promised word of God how many have restored Faith hallelujah amen I believe with all my heart Hallelujah so we understand our day and our message Hallelujah God has sent us a message for this day we must recognize our D's message but Ram said the churches are getting the the message of Israel confused with their calling right the two prophets are not for us we've already had a prophet sent Amen brother R warned us hallelujah with thus sayith the Lord hallelujah many times he said thus sayith the Lord remember I showed I got the video six thus sayith the Lords that were prophesied came to pass and then he gives us eight thus sayith the Lord on Doctrine and then he gives us 11 future prophecies that haven't come to pass yet that but we know they will because we already have these other ones we already have these 14 Hallelujah then he says this he said them preachers he says we'll get up there and just stir up the crowd and say there's coming a great Revival the hand Lord is going to be upon the Earth he says they don't realize that's under the trumpets for Israel see they're pumping them up about blood moons and uh all these things we read about and stars from from the heavens and the two prophets but that's not even for us that's for Israel God said when he go the Bible said in re Romans 11 when he goes back to Israel he cuts off the Gentiles that means no more Mercy wherever you are at the Rapture wherever you are whether you're you're holy or righteous that's what you're going to remain he cuts off the branch and whatever's that's whatever the branch is that's what what it is and then God goes back to Israel to get the 144,000 that's the scripture Hallelujah they don't realize that's under of the trumpets for Israel why do they do that he said they don't realize they're rejecting the very message that's sent to them he said now you know you see why Satan didn't want me to preach this now back to the beginning he ate corn he had a stomach ache falling asleep trying to study now do you see why Satan was fighting this because we had to recognize our day in message don't try to we we're not looking for what Israel is looking for right we're not looking for two prophets we already had a prophet Hallelujah we've got to do what the prophet said amen hallelujah we must be on fire we got to be hot we can't be lukewarm or cold we're not going to be cold so we just got to battle lukewarmness Hallelujah remember that's just in your mind if you're born again your soul can never be cold you're your soul can never be lukewarm right remember that remember that good Revelation 1 John 3:9 put up 1 John 3:9 H if you got there by God's grace there's a part of you that never sin in the first place you got if you got the Holy Ghost now in your soul that seed of God that spirit of God in you it never did Sin to begin with hallelujah amen hallelujah that's the part that's hot Hallelujah that's the part you feed on that's the part that uh when you pray God speaks to that part Hallelujah whosoever is born of God does not commit sin amen my mind will commit sin My Flesh will commit sin but my soul can never commit it's in Hallelujah CU that my soul is baptized it's filled it's immersed with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah for a seed remains in him and he cannot sin because he's born of God hallelujah am oh what a revelation amen thank you Jesus amen remember just two chapters before that he said if anybody says they're not a sinner they're a liar and the sameen two chapters later says you got a part of you that never sinned and can sin what is it it's a mystery it's a the mystery of Christ in you the hope of Glory Hallelujah hidden from the ages before but now it's been revealed to us hallelujah amen as it was to the Colossians in Colossians chapter 1 26 and 27 Hallelujah he said there you are we're just waitting God is just waiting for the bride to take her out of the way so the two prophets can come the Hebrew prophets they'll recognize Israel recognize those two two Hebrew prophets now how many remember when brother ran was in chiro Egypt and he was going to get on a plane to go to Israel to show them the prophet gift I remember that story he was he was there in the uh I think he called it the hanger I don't know exactly let me look brother Braham said oh he said Lord here I am ready I jumped on the plane took the money got me a ticket stopped in Cairo said yeah I'm Ready the H spirit said this is not your place he was going to go show them the gift of the Prophet this is not your time he said see I got ahead of myself I thought oh my I came over here I'm going I'm going to go but something said stop right here don't you go that way turn on and go into India don't go over that go over to India don't you go there I think it was 1954 if I'm not mistaken or 55 I have to go look that up I thought why Lord so I walked out behind the hanger right where the planes were and I said Lord Jesus what does this mean and then he made known to me no Gentile these prophets are the one it has to be according to the scripture Moses and Elijah has to come to Israel so see the holy spirit said Israel is not going to receive a gentile they're only received two Jews right he said that's according to the scripture and besides that the bride hasn't been taken out of the way yet and then prophets will return and then they'll do the sign of the Prophet to Israel that's the scripture there it is all fulfilled there perfectly Israel as a nation will be born in one day the Bible says he says amen let me show you how he closes this here so brother R prays for the people and here's what he says he asked people to come out of denominations now you're all churches here right are you're all members here for the most part now rod and Nia are not but that's okay but everybody else every service usually we only have we rarely have visitors just CU most people don't like our preaching but that's okay they don't have to but brother R says if you're still in denomination he said come out of it because it's Rome Revelation 184 come out of the system because all those systems are going to bow to the Roman Catholic Church brother Ram says would you raise your hand and say God be merciful to me let the spirit of God come into me condemning me now of all my sins in other words convicting me and my frustrations all my bad habits and my high Temperance now look what he says he
