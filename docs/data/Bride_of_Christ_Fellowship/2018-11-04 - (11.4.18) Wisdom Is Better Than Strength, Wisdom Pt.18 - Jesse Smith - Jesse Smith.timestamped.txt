[37:47] said unto them suffer the little
[37:48] children to come unto me and forbid them

[42:10] just heading on my heart a few days ago
[42:13] to ask sister Tonya if we could if we
[42:17] could do either Bible studies with her
[42:18] or however however we like to do we like
[42:20] her to introduce her to our foundational
[42:23] beliefs and and so I said well how about
[42:26] I just on Sunday morning how about I
[42:28] just preached for like 45 minutes on my
[42:30] topic for the whole church and then I
[42:32] can spend about half an hour going over
[42:35] some of our foundational beliefs by
[42:37] God's grace so she's on her way I know
[42:39] she's not here yet but I sent her a text
[42:41] and she said she's on her way so I like
[42:44] to plan to preach about a hour and a
[42:45] half this morning and hour and 15
[42:48] minutes
[42:48] Lord willing sorry because we only have
[42:51] one service and I'll try not to wear
[42:53] myself out and try not to wear you out
[42:55] as well but I want to do that and I want
[42:58] to you know Tanya's been coming so
[43:00] faithfully the last what six months or
[43:02] so and I just I kind of just been too
[43:05] forgetful to you know invite her to do
[43:09] Bible studies and things like that to
[43:10] kind of show her are all of our Bible
[43:12] based beliefs because everything we
[43:14] believe is in here by God's grace so we
[43:18] want to do that and so I'll set a little
[43:20] timer and Lord winning will be able to
[43:22] when she gets here you know at the end
[43:24] of the message just go over some of our
[43:25] core beliefs so let's read Ackley's ask

[43:32] 9 verse 16 sorry we're going to start
[43:36] preaching in Ecclesiastes 7 and then we

[43:41] want to finish preached chapter 7 8 9
[43:43] this morning by the grace of God I
[43:46] [Music]
[43:47] believe church God has given me much
[43:50] revelation and understanding of the book
[43:52] of proverbs and Ecclesiastes through
[43:54] this series I want to say it tell the
[43:56] Lord thank you for that
[43:57] praise God for I could never understand
[44:00] some of these things before but it seems
[44:01] like the Holy Spirit just kind of keeps
[44:03] opening up things so we can understand
[44:05] the word of the Lord we're very grateful
[44:08] for that please ask these 9:16 let's
[44:10] read it together
[44:11] 1 2 3 then said I wisdom is better than
[44:16] strength nevertheless the poor man's
[44:19] wisdom is despised and his words are not
[44:22] hurt amen let's have one more word of
[44:24] Prayer Heavenly Father Lord we've read
[44:26] your eternal Word and father we know
[44:28] that wisdom is better than strength dear
[44:30] God well we heard last week even with
[44:34] brother Joe ministering Lord and how
[44:36] Lord no matter what as we fight battles
[44:39] were outnumbered and all the Bible
[44:41] characters and all their stories were
[44:43] outnumbered Lord and and you always came
[44:46] upon the scene and and Lord it boiled
[44:48] down to wisdom
[44:49] was better than human strength dear God
[44:52] your your ways and your thoughts and
[44:55] your will is always better than physical
[44:57] strength or the amount of numbers of
[45:00] people so father we we know that we're
[45:03] assured of that quicken it to our hearts
[45:05] Lord God as we preach your word and Lord
[45:07] let the wisdom of the Holy Spirit our
[45:09] lives father but there'll be one virgin
[45:11] Lord God who's raptured and that's the
[45:14] wise one Lord God and we want to be that
[45:16] wise virgin according to Matthew 25 Lord
[45:19] the parable you told Lord God we want to
[45:22] have our lamps trimmed and clear we want
[45:24] to be burning bright with the light of
[45:25] the Holy Spirit Lord in this hour so we
[45:28] thank you for that bless every heart and
[45:29] soul that's gathered in thy divine
[45:30] presence and ministered every need in
[45:33] Jesus Christ's name and the church said
[45:35] Amen god bless yous B&C the praise the
[45:37] Lord so we like to start there let's now
[45:45] if you got your Bibles let's go back to
[45:47] Ecclesiastes 7 iLike to just look at you
[45:50] know Wednesday we looked at verses 1 and
[45:54] we went all the way to about 24 so we we
[45:59] looked at we actually preached
[46:02] Ecclesiastes chapter 5 6 and almost all
[46:04] of 7 by the grace of the Lord so we're
[46:07] almost through the book by God's grace
[46:09] and if we can stay on track will almost
[46:10] be done maybe we can finish Wednesday
[46:12] night amen
[46:14] I like to I like to get things finished
[46:15] praise God I start my personalities so
[46:18] often to start things and and it takes
[46:21] me a while to finish but I want to
[46:22] finish it by God's grace so we see today
[46:26] that are opening scripture is that
[46:29] wisdom is better than physical strength
[46:32] remember two weeks ago we preached on
[46:34] Jehoshaphat in the book of 2nd
[46:36] chronicles chapter 20 and we saw how he
[46:40] was outnumbered the the armies of Moab
[46:44] and the armies of the ammonites were out
[46:46] numbering him he was totally surrounded
[46:47] and his kingdom was Judah so Judah was
[46:51] completely surrounded and he was
[46:54] outnumbered but in that case wisdom was
[46:57] better than strength the strength of the
[47:00] Moab Moabites and the ammonites was
[47:02] physically
[47:03] greater than Israel but Israel had a
[47:05] strength that they couldn't see and that
[47:08] strength was in worship amen they
[47:10] worshiped the one true God and as they
[47:13] worship and as they prayed the Holy
[47:15] Spirit put it on the Kings heart to call
[47:17] the prophet and the Prophet gave him
[47:19] thus saith the Lord let's say the Lord
[47:21] that you overcome army and then you'll
[47:25] overcome by by worshiping the Lord amen
[47:29] forgive me and that's how we overcome
[47:32] today by worshiping God no matter what
[47:35] the situation looks like no matter what
[47:37] the conditions are we still give a
[47:40] continual sacrifice of praise because we
[47:42] know God has ordered our steps we know
[47:45] God knows the beginning from the end and
[47:48] we know the plans that God has for us
[47:50] they're not plans of evil they're plans
[47:53] for good but you know the world thinks
[47:56] good only means millions of dollars and
[47:58] and popularity and all these things but
[48:00] the Christian knows that's not always
[48:02] what God's into many times God's not
[48:04] into that but we know good for us means
[48:07] God's will praise God that we keep the
[48:10] Word of God without sinning and so we
[48:13] know the will of God good for us means
[48:16] obedience to the Word of God and God's
[48:19] will that he's already laid before us
[48:21] amen so Jehoshaphat put the worship
[48:24] first and he had the wisdom to do that
[48:26] he had the wisdom to know when I'm in
[48:28] trouble I've got to pray to God when I'm
[48:30] in trouble I've got the worship God and
[48:33] let God fight for me amen
[48:34] so wisdom was better than strength so
[48:38] was it in the days of Elijah when he was
[48:40] against 450 BHEL prophets wisdom was
[48:43] better than strength praise God he had
[48:45] wisdom to let them cut themselves and
[48:48] dancing and do all their all their
[48:50] enchantments to try to call on the names
[48:52] that are gods
[48:52] he had wisdom just to wait and not get
[48:56] swayed by that can you imagine 450 verse
[48:58] 1 alright and then Elijah just stood
[49:02] there but but God had showed him a
[49:03] vision the Bible said and he saw he said
[49:06] he he saw the gods on the wait until
[49:08] they're all done and then rebuild that
[49:11] altar of worship and then God would send
[49:13] fire down from heaven and so Elijah stay
[49:16] with the word
[49:17] he had wisdom to know I've got to stay
[49:19] with what God showed me and so do we
[49:21] have wisdom to know we must stay with
[49:23] what God has showed us they men no
[49:25] matter how much we're outnumbered
[49:26] we've got to reestablish true worship
[49:29] the right water baptism the right ideas
[49:31] about the Godhead the right kind of
[49:33] clothes to wear the right way to use our
[49:35] money the right way to invest our time
[49:37] once we've got the reorder of the altar
[49:40] of worship and when we do that God will
[49:41] vindicate it with the pillar of fire
[49:43] amen amen
[49:45] by healing by saving by delivering amen
[49:49] by granting us his will remember Elijah
[49:52] and his Hayes's servant were outnumbered
[49:55] by the Sirians army but Elijah wasn't
[49:58] shaken at all he said Lord open his eyes
[50:00] that he can see that there's more with
[50:02] us than there are with them amen see
[50:05] wisdom let him know that that wisdom is
[50:07] always better than human strength amen
[50:10] and we know today were small in number
[50:13] were small in you know maybe finances or
[50:17] we're small even as a building but we
[50:22] know that doesn't matter to God because
[50:24] wisdom is better than having a
[50:26] megachurch where there's no spiritual
[50:29] truth being priests amen we know the
[50:31] wisdom of God is better than strength in
[50:34] numbers amen and the world only the
[50:38] world would be deceive a true Christian
[50:39] would not be deceived by judging well if
[50:42] there's more people there they must be
[50:44] more blessed by God or if there's if
[50:46] they have a bit bigger building then
[50:48] they must be closer to God but a true
[50:50] Christian knows that that that's not
[50:52] always the determining factor praise God
[50:54] in fact God's people were almost always
[50:56] outnumbered and that's the way it is
[50:59] Jesus even said in the last days Jesus
[51:01] said phew there will be that fine the
[51:04] narrow road it's not a great many people
[51:07] it's very few that will be saved and so
[51:10] those are the words of Jesus in Matthew
[51:12] 7:14 and so we must take those and we
[51:15] must say God make me one of those few
[51:17] praise God
[51:18] because the paul said evil men and
[51:21] seducers will wax worse and worse
[51:23] deceiving and being deceived but Jesus
[51:27] came that we might have truth
[51:29] the way that we might receive the truth
[51:31] and the truth would set us free amen
[51:34] go glory so wisdom is better than
[51:38] strength praise God now in your Bible
[51:40] and it please a c7 on Wednesday we
[51:43] preach how the value of a good name how
[51:46] it's so important that people call you
[51:49] say good things about your name it's
[51:51] better than precious ointment amen
[51:53] also the reality of mortality the Bible
[51:56] said it's better to be at a funeral than
[51:59] to be at a party and that's true right
[52:02] because the sad countenance makes our
[52:04] heart better when we're faced with the
[52:06] reality of death when we're faced with
[52:07] the reality that we have to stand before
[52:10] God it makes us live a better Christian
[52:13] life amen hallelujah and the Bible said
[52:15] the day of your death is better than the
[52:18] day of your life and that's true as well
[52:19] because on the day of your death you
[52:21] finally see Jesus amen
[52:23] hallelujah amen and that's better than
[52:26] the day that you're born although we
[52:27] thank God for the day that were that
[52:28] were born hallelujah and so we saw the
[52:33] wisdom of God that corruption is so
[52:36] pervasive
[52:37] according to Solomon even in his day and
[52:39] that the end of a thing was better than
[52:42] beginning but we saw then how wisdom
[52:44] gives life amen so we feel like ours
[52:49] were spiritually dead or if we feel like
[52:52] there's no hope and and all the hopes
[52:54] are dead that we know one thing for sure
[52:56] that if we can find God's mind if we can
[52:59] find the Word of God for our situation
[53:01] if we can find God's will for our lives
[53:03] we know that we'll bring life to us and
[53:06] we'll feel rejuvenated will feel
[53:08] strengthened we'll be transformed amen
[53:12] as many times church in American art our
[53:15] troubles not physical persecution it's
[53:17] mental depression right it's mental
[53:21] persecution it's it's spiritual
[53:23] wickedness in high places our
[53:25] persecution right now is more here in
[53:28] America where we've got to overcome
[53:29] being discouraged we've got to overcome
[53:32] being depressed we've got to overcome
[53:34] feeling hopeless and even celebrities
[53:37] take their lives all the time because
[53:39] they feel hopeless yet with millions of
[53:41] dollars in the bank
[53:42] because they reject the life that God
[53:45] offers them and that life is only in the
[53:47] Word of God amen hallelujah that's the
[53:50] only place where you find the life of
[53:52] God is and the wisdom of God amen
[53:54] it's in the Word of God and so we can
[53:57] have hope in the midst of darkness in
[53:59] the midst of a nation that's backsliding
[54:01] from its from its original foundations
[54:04] that's totally backs it and churches are
[54:07] backslide in the midst of this wicked
[54:09] and darker age we can stand on the life
[54:12] of God because God's Word remains
[54:14] unchanged amen glory now in let's go to
[54:20] Ecclesiastes 723 we'll pick up there all
[54:24] this have I proved by wisdom I said I
[54:26] will be wise but it was far from me that
[54:28] which is far off an exceeding deep who
[54:31] can find out so remember let's just
[54:33] remember where Solomon's at at this time
[54:35] Solomon is at the end of his life he
[54:37] started off on fire for God but he back
[54:41] slid horribly so much so by the end of
[54:44] his life the Bible said that the Lord
[54:46] was angry with Solomon God can you
[54:50] imagine having God upset with you we
[54:52] don't want to walk like that church amen
[54:55] we don't know that we weren't a God to
[54:57] be pleased with us amen but Solomon had
[55:00] sold he had so read despised the Word of
[55:03] God the Bible said because his heart was
[55:06] turned from the Lord which had repaired
[55:09] to him twice God physically appeared by
[55:12] a vision to Solomon twice and yet
[55:14] Solomon still went against the commands
[55:17] of God and married all those women the
[55:20] Bible said that the women the muhabba
[55:22] said the King Solomon loved many strange
[55:25] women and the Bible said 700 wives
[55:28] princesses and 300 concubines and the
[55:33] Bible said that there's wives when he
[55:35] was old turned his heart away after
[55:37] other gods oh there's nothing more
[55:40] shameful than to see somebody start off
[55:42] on fire for Jesus but then slowly see
[55:45] them start loving the world more than
[55:48] they look Jesus
[55:49] nothing's more shameful than that to see
[55:51] them prayer and read their Bible and
[55:53] love God raise their hands at work
[55:55] of shout and cry and praise the Lord but
[55:58] then at some point they just sit there
[55:59] stiff and starchy and pretty soon they
[56:01] stop coming to church and pretty soon
[56:03] their life spiritual life is all dried
[56:06] up there's nothing more awful than that
[56:08] and it was so true in Solomon's life
[56:11] that God stopped being happy with him
[56:13] and God got angry with him amen because
[56:18] Solomon loved the women God was angry
[56:21] with him it was his responsibility and
[56:24] he lived contrary to the way God had
[56:27] called him to live amen the Bible said
[56:31] he built a high place so he built an
[56:33] altar for every false God and the Bible
[56:36] said he built them on the hill before
[56:38] Jerusalem did you catch that before you
[56:42] got to Jerusalem and so what is it
[56:44] showing Satan took preeminence over over
[56:47] God's temple
[56:48] so before you got to God's temple you
[56:50] had to see all these false idols and
[56:53] what was it it was Satan taking the
[56:55] preeminence Satan's altars were seen
[56:57] first our youth me and so that's how it
[57:02] was in his life
[57:03] the travelers that were the worshipers
[57:05] that came in before they could even get
[57:07] to the Lord they had to be exposed to
[57:09] all this false religion and I had Dollar
[57:12] Tree oh my but they should have been
[57:15] torn down amen when he was living right
[57:17] with God all these idols were torn down
[57:20] well the same thing that happens to our
[57:21] life but we just you know we start off
[57:24] strong and there's no idols but then
[57:26] we'll bill let things build up and
[57:28] instead of us getting fully focused on
[57:30] the Lord and and God just having
[57:32] preeminence in our in our lives we set
[57:35] up idols that come before the house of
[57:38] God nothing should be come before the
[57:40] house of God but we should let God have
[57:42] first place in our lives amen
[57:45] at the beginning of Simon's reign you
[57:48] never would have saw idols on the way to
[57:50] church right you your own you would not
[57:53] have passed those things but as he got
[57:54] already started backsliding and
[57:56] compromising well this is okay just one
[57:59] just want to do this and pretty soon he
[58:01] was so far back stirred that you could
[58:03] even recognize that this is your 'some
[58:06] because it's filled with idolatry Omaha
[58:10] so look Church and now he's at this spot
[58:13] where he says he says I want to be wise
[58:16] but it's far from me now that isn't a
[58:19] statement about of exciting experience I
[58:21] don't know what is he was filled with so
[58:24] much wisdom at the beginning that he
[58:26] wrote the whole book of Proverbs and the
[58:28] Bible said he had three thousand
[58:29] proverbs he was at the beginning of his
[58:33] work he was so filled with wisdom and
[58:35] now he's at the end he's so far from God
[58:38] so far back slidden
[58:40] that he said wisdom is so far from me
[58:42] yet he's the one that wrote the book of
[58:45] Proverbs can you imagine that you used
[58:48] to feel so close to God but now you feel
[58:50] so far and you want to get back right
[58:52] with God but you can't get back to where
[58:54] you were because of your sins oh thank
[58:58] God today though that God still restores
[59:00] he said I will restore saith the Lord
[59:03] amen if you feel far from God don't be
[59:08] discouraged repent of your sins break
[59:10] down the idols because that's what
[59:12] Hezekiah did a few hundred years after
[59:14] Solomon he broke down every Idol the
[59:16] Bible said he smashed them to sand and
[59:19] pieces and then he took all the pieces
[59:21] of those idols and threw him in the
[59:22] Jordan amen hallelujah and that's the
[59:26] only way to get back to God is to
[59:28] destroy all your idols and start all
[59:30] over clean it out and then God's
[59:32] presence will return amen that's right
[59:36] he's so far from God now go to John if
[59:39] you got actually let he just put up John
[59:41] 327 I was gonna read one scripture thank
[59:43] you darlin he's wondering where's God's
[59:46] wisdom he's so far back slid he said
[59:49] these things are exceedingly far off
[59:51] they're so deep who can find it out look
[59:55] what John 327 says John answered and
[59:57] said a man can receive nothing except to
[1:00:00] be given him from heaven ha ha ha ha
[1:00:05] Solomon III need how can anybody know
[1:00:08] anything deep how can anybody ever
[1:00:10] figure out the wisdom of God wisdom
[1:00:12] seems so far from me see Solomon had
[1:00:15] stopped reaching out to heaven for four
[1:00:19] things instead he was reaching out to
[1:00:21] his wives for physical play
[1:00:22] sure and of course the the the fathers
[1:00:26] of their lives for money and political
[1:00:27] gain he was reaching out to those things
[1:00:30] instead of reaching out to heaven but
[1:00:32] when he was reaching out to heaven God
[1:00:34] said I'll bless you I'll answer your
[1:00:36] requests and I'll give you things you
[1:00:38] didn't even ask for amen
[1:00:40] Oh church we've got to look up to heaven
[1:00:42] if you receive anything good it's not
[1:00:44] for me it's not from anybody here it's
[1:00:47] from God Almighty amen hey man God send
[1:00:50] us something good today praise God that
[1:00:52] we can leave here and say I've heard
[1:00:54] from heaven I received something from
[1:00:56] heaven God spoke to me it was God's Word
[1:00:58] it was God's direction and I've received
[1:01:01] it from heaven not from a man not from a
[1:01:03] woman but God spoke to me God met my
[1:01:06] need and I've heard from heaven and Oh
[1:01:08] hallelujah
[1:01:12] the Solomons channel was cut off because
[1:01:16] of all the idols in his life didn't have
[1:01:19] time to pray like he used to didn't have
[1:01:21] time to focus on the wisdom like he used
[1:01:24] to
[1:01:24] and so the blessings of heaven are cut
[1:01:27] off who could know these deep things my
[1:01:28] the word is so deep I just can't
[1:01:30] understand these things see heaven was
[1:01:33] cut off because he was so attached to
[1:01:35] the things of the world that's why we
[1:01:37] need a fresh circumcision praise God if
[1:01:39] you need one you can get a fresh
[1:01:41] circumcision like Joshua he brought the
[1:01:43] people back in and he had a freshly
[1:01:45] circumcised the new generation as a
[1:01:48] symbol to cut off the things of the
[1:01:50] world be separated from the things of
[1:01:52] the world and be committed only to God
[1:01:55] amen now the reason church I preached
[1:02:00] all that is to get to the end of the
[1:02:02] chapter look at the end of the chapter
[1:02:04] verse 25
[1:02:07] so he's searching for deep things he
[1:02:09] can't get through to God and this is an
[1:02:12] often too misunderstood scripture here
[1:02:14] it seems as though Solomon's blaming
[1:02:17] women like like it's the woman's fault
[1:02:19] that he's back slidden
[1:02:21] it's not will woman's fault it's his
[1:02:23] fault it's easy for her it's easy to
[1:02:27] blame other people for your problems
[1:02:29] isn't a church but really whose fault is
[1:02:31] it it's ours it's your fault it's my
[1:02:35] fault
[1:02:36] when I said it's not someone else's
[1:02:38] fault it's not even the devil's fault
[1:02:39] it's my fault exactly
[1:02:43] look at verse 25 I applied my heart to
[1:02:46] know in the search and to seek out
[1:02:47] wisdom and reason of things and to know
[1:02:49] the wickedness of folly even the
[1:02:50] foolishness and madness and look what he
[1:02:54] found
[1:02:54] and I find more bitter than death the
[1:02:56] woman whose heart is snares and nets and
[1:02:58] her hands as bands who so pleased with
[1:03:01] God shall escape from her but the sinner
[1:03:03] shall be taken by her isn't that
[1:03:06] interesting he's talking about a sinner
[1:03:08] being taken by women and he was taken by
[1:03:10] a thousand and that's striking he can
[1:03:14] see everybody else's mistakes but what
[1:03:17] about you that's how we all right oh we
[1:03:20] can see oh this sermon would be good for
[1:03:21] somebody else but what about the sermons
[1:03:23] good for us when are we gonna get a
[1:03:26] sermon for us so it's like well this one
[1:03:29] should go to him that really helped her
[1:03:31] that really helped her but how about you
[1:03:33] when is God talking to you God ought to
[1:03:35] be talking to us every service amen amen
[1:03:39] he ought to be talking to each one of us
[1:03:41] we oughta just not be assigning the word
[1:03:43] to other people we all let the word be
[1:03:45] assigned to us amen how can I serve God
[1:03:48] better what can I do more better for the
[1:03:51] kingdom of God where's my short places
[1:03:53] where's my weaknesses that they might
[1:03:55] become strengths amen
[1:03:56] Oh hallelujah so he says I want to know
[1:04:00] about wickedness and I found more bitter
[1:04:02] than death the woman who to traps me and
[1:04:05] sin putting the blame on the woman
[1:04:11] that's what Adam did right remember in
[1:04:14] the Garden of Eden who dad-blame he said
[1:04:16] Adam why you've done this he said the
[1:04:17] woman that you gave me did this or
[1:04:21] brother branham said his yeast packet
[1:04:23] he's passing the buck always passing the
[1:04:25] responsibility onto somebody else no we
[1:04:27] need to take responsibility for
[1:04:29] ourselves now there are sins of course
[1:04:33] that could have been done to you as a
[1:04:34] child or that even as an adult that you
[1:04:37] didn't have control over
[1:04:38] don't fret God will bring those people
[1:04:40] in a judgment for that
[1:04:42] and still in the midst of that pain we
[1:04:45] should still as Christ a God be merciful
[1:04:46] bring that person to repentance but many
[1:04:50] times shirts you know those aren't the
[1:04:51] things that get Christians many times
[1:04:53] that things are things that we've done
[1:04:55] that Satan tries to to deceive us and
[1:04:57] make us blame other people rather than
[1:04:59] taking responsibility for ourselves the
[1:05:03] spirit we're gonna battle hardest church
[1:05:05] is the religious sphere of the Pharisees
[1:05:07] and Sadducees who outwardly look good
[1:05:10] but inward were full of dead men's bones
[1:05:13] oh and I come to church I don't want to
[1:05:16] be dead on the inside I want to be alive
[1:05:18] on the outside I've got a stain on my
[1:05:20] jacket I'm not gonna let that hinder me
[1:05:22] from coming to church I'm not gonna
[1:05:24] worry about that I don't one of these
[1:05:25] seat stains on my life amen I don't want
[1:05:29] any sin stains in my heart I want to be
[1:05:31] allowed to the word I want to love the
[1:05:33] word I want wisdom to bring me life amen
[1:05:36] so when I go home my children will see
[1:05:38] the life of Christ in me that my wife
[1:05:40] will see the life of Jesus lived through
[1:05:43] me so that the hundreds of children that
[1:05:46] I ministered to every week will see the
[1:05:48] life of God in me praise God and it
[1:05:51] won't be me it'll be Christ in me the
[1:05:52] hope of glory if they don't see that
[1:05:55] they're gonna see some some sinner who
[1:05:57] needs God's great well we all need God's
[1:05:58] grace but we want to be reflecting we
[1:06:00] want to be obedient children and we will
[1:06:02] be manifesting the life of Jesus Christ
[1:06:04] to this generation hallelujah now let's
[1:06:10] look at the next verse so he blames
[1:06:12] those women verse 27 behold this have I
[1:06:15] found say the preacher counting one by
[1:06:17] one to find out the accounts he counted
[1:06:19] every one of these women behold this I
[1:06:23] found saved the props art verse
[1:06:24] twenty-eight yet which my yet my soul
[1:06:26] seeketh but I find not one man among a
[1:06:29] thousand have I found but a woman among
[1:06:31] all those have I not found lo this only
[1:06:35] have I found that God hath made man
[1:06:37] upright but they have sought out many
[1:06:39] inventions
[1:06:39] now this scripture is true for churches
[1:06:46] it's hard to find one good woman one
[1:06:50] good church out of a thousand churches
[1:06:52] is that right that's exactly right
[1:06:56] amen this scripture applies to churches
[1:07:00] and brother Branham applies this of
[1:07:01] course to the authority of church age
[1:07:05] and he applies it to the Jezebel spirit
[1:07:08] from the book of Revelation chapter 2
[1:07:11] the Thyer to you in church aid program
[1:07:13] says a dominating female is the greatest
[1:07:15] curse in the world the wisest man the
[1:07:18] world ever saw Solomon said that and we
[1:07:20] just read that so brother baron applies
[1:07:23] this to the Jezebel church system which
[1:07:26] we know as hard as is to say we know the
[1:07:29] Jezebel church is the Roman Catholic
[1:07:31] Church because of and I have three
[1:07:33] videos on my youtube channel with 14
[1:07:35] proofs Kandam 10:14 there's 14 proofs
[1:07:38] that proved that Jezebel Church or the
[1:07:41] mother church which they call themselves
[1:07:43] a mother church - is the Roman Catholic
[1:07:45] Church but don't forget that mother had
[1:07:48] daughters the Bible says so every
[1:07:51] denominational Church that came out
[1:07:53] after the Roman Catholic Church when
[1:07:55] they denominated and failed to move on
[1:07:57] with the Holy Spirit they denominated
[1:07:59] they limited God and then they started
[1:08:02] dying themselves that's right now let's
[1:08:07] look at Solomon again so Solomon looks
[1:08:08] and eke out a thousand women he can't
[1:08:11] find one good women out of the thousand
[1:08:13] now church this is the same man that
[1:08:15] wrote proverbs 31 are you with me this
[1:08:20] man earlier in his life he ended the
[1:08:23] book of Proverbs by salting the godly
[1:08:26] woman higher than rubies Amen and we
[1:08:29] found out that was over five million
[1:08:30] dollars in the value of rubies beginning
[1:08:34] of Solomon's life he exalted the godly
[1:08:36] woman she's worth more than five million
[1:08:38] dollars Amen hallelujah the Bible said a
[1:08:43] woman that fears the Lord Solomon said
[1:08:45] she shall be praised amen so the same
[1:08:48] man that was before in his godly
[1:08:50] position he was seeing women as godly
[1:08:52] the godly women as a wonderful thing but
[1:08:55] now in his back sitting condition also
[1:08:57] you can see his women that are lowdown
[1:09:00] and dirty just like him are you with me
[1:09:03] and I wonder which a thousand women he
[1:09:06] was counting around him probably as
[1:09:08] heathen wives
[1:09:10] and of course out of a thousand heathen
[1:09:12] wives you're not gonna find one good one
[1:09:14] if they don't work Jehovah
[1:09:15] are you with me church but this
[1:09:19] scripture does not show that let me say
[1:09:21] this plenty this scripture does not show
[1:09:24] that women are worse than men
[1:09:25] spiritually it doesn't show that so
[1:09:28] brothers if you got that idea you've got
[1:09:30] the wrong idea
[1:09:31] amen praise God because the Bible says
[1:09:35] in Galatians chapter 3 the Bible says
[1:09:38] that you're all children of God by faith
[1:09:41] in Christ Jesus
[1:09:42] the Bible said there's neither Jew nor
[1:09:44] Greek neither male nor female you are
[1:09:46] all one in Christ Jesus
[1:09:49] amen so men are not greater as far as
[1:09:53] salvation the eyes of God they're not
[1:09:56] greater than women but see some men will
[1:09:58] take description they'll say say yeah
[1:09:59] say there's hardly any good women out
[1:10:01] there well let me say like this there's
[1:10:02] hardly good men out there I don't see
[1:10:05] many real good men standing on the Word
[1:10:06] of God amen
[1:10:08] that are leading their families
[1:10:09] according to the Bible that they're
[1:10:11] praying and seeking God fasting and not
[1:10:13] eating and trying to get closer to God
[1:10:15] and put God above everything I find very
[1:10:18] few men that do that in fact in our
[1:10:20] church we find a lot more women that do
[1:10:22] that in our church because we just have
[1:10:25] outnumbered and we have more women than
[1:10:27] men so see you if someone takes an idea
[1:10:32] they're just a plain old woman basher
[1:10:34] and shame on them for bashing God's
[1:10:36] women the Bible doesn't tell us either
[1:10:39] one which is easier to find
[1:10:40] but in Solomon's day he's counting a
[1:10:42] thousand he's back slitted he's blaming
[1:10:44] the women for putting him in traps when
[1:10:46] it's his fault he's in the traps
[1:10:48] it wasn't the woman's fault because
[1:10:50] Solomon could have said no but he
[1:10:53] couldn't turn down that almighty dollar
[1:10:55] could he he couldn't turn down that
[1:10:57] political power well if I can get all
[1:10:59] these nations on my side I could I can
[1:11:02] make more money I can be more powerful
[1:11:04] shame on that you and I should never
[1:11:07] compromise with sin in order to get more
[1:11:09] money we should rather be fit be better
[1:11:11] to be more poor but yet to be pleasing
[1:11:13] in the eyes of God amen
[1:11:15] more money does not always equal God's
[1:11:18] favor many times it's the opposite amen
[1:11:20] hallelujah and so we must stay with the
[1:11:23] word of
[1:11:25] because Church we can't forget a few
[1:11:27] things here we want to remember all
[1:11:33] these things we want to remember that
[1:11:35] Solomon is at the end of his life he's
[1:11:37] depressed and he blames the women more
[1:11:40] bitter than death are these women who
[1:11:42] put them and put me in instance snares
[1:11:45] well that's true that's that's evil that
[1:11:48] the women tried to put him in a snare
[1:11:49] but it's evil that he gave into it as
[1:11:51] well and let me ask you this church who
[1:11:55] is ultimately behind every evil woman
[1:11:59] that Solomon's talking about who's
[1:12:01] ultimately behind every evil woman a man
[1:12:06] the son of the morning and the church
[1:12:09] said who's ultimately behind every one
[1:12:13] who's all three behind the Roman
[1:12:14] Catholic Church and not the people but
[1:12:16] the system who's ultimately behind
[1:12:18] Jezebel system who's ultimately behind
[1:12:21] know that it's a dirty old man named
[1:12:23] Lucifer so behind though of the women
[1:12:27] there's a dirty man is that right Church
[1:12:33] see Jezebel the Bible says was in the
[1:12:36] depths of Satan Satan she was in the
[1:12:41] depths of a man Satan amen hallelujah so
[1:12:48] see we got a Solomon here be a little
[1:12:50] you know we got to understand his
[1:12:51] spiritual state he's blaming the women
[1:12:53] instead of him taking a countability
[1:12:57] that's right we can't so brothers today
[1:12:59] we can't have a complex toward women
[1:13:01] you remember brother branham battle the
[1:13:02] complex toward women brother Bram said
[1:13:05] some pretty harsh things against women
[1:13:06] because he had a complex toward him
[1:13:08] when he was growing up cause he saw you
[1:13:10] know his dad was making moonshine all's
[1:13:12] he saw was women that were dressing him
[1:13:14] orally staying up all night leaving
[1:13:15] their children at home I could party and
[1:13:17] get drunk and so he got a really bad
[1:13:19] attitude towards women and the church
[1:13:22] said now everything he preached from the
[1:13:24] Word of God was true but see there's
[1:13:28] some things he said about women that
[1:13:29] were a little too far in my opinion
[1:13:31] because they were just a little rough I
[1:13:34] think and so
[1:13:36] some of those things I won't even repeat
[1:13:37] just because they're so rough but listen
[1:13:40] Church sometimes you and I say things
[1:13:42] that are so rough that I wouldn't want
[1:13:44] to repeat some things you say is that
[1:13:47] right how would you like it if I
[1:13:50] recorded you in your sinful years and
[1:13:52] then I brought that out before everybody
[1:13:53] years later wouldn't that be awful that
[1:13:58] would be awful
[1:13:59] I used to condemn people I used to say
[1:14:01] go to blank and I said oh I thank God
[1:14:03] that that's all under the blood of Jesus
[1:14:05] Christ because I don't say that anymore
[1:14:08] he's cleansed our hearts because from
[1:14:10] the abundance of the heart the mouth
[1:14:12] speaks we should not be cursing anything
[1:14:14] except cursing those demons that are
[1:14:16] behind sickness we should be cursing
[1:14:18] Satan in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:14:22] that's exactly right so don't forget
[1:14:26] who's behind every evil woman it's an
[1:14:28] evil man that's right so bear with me
[1:14:34] here brother branham said now you say
[1:14:37] you're awful hard on us women all right
[1:14:39] men here you are any man that will let
[1:14:41] his wife wear those kind of clothes and
[1:14:43] smoke cigarettes that shows what you're
[1:14:45] made out of I got little respect of you
[1:14:47] even being a man so they would accuse
[1:14:51] brother branham you're so hard on women
[1:14:52] he's like all right let me bounce it out
[1:14:54] he said if you let your wife act like
[1:14:56] that you're not even a real man amen he
[1:15:00] says later on if you listen to dirty
[1:15:02] music and put posters up of evil women
[1:15:04] he said I got little respects of you
[1:15:06] even being a man he said I don't care
[1:15:08] how big your muscles are you're not even
[1:15:10] a man he said the only way to judge that
[1:15:12] you're a man is when you're on your
[1:15:13] knees in prayer amen
[1:15:15] that's how you judge a man which men are
[1:15:17] playing which ones are trying to find
[1:15:19] the voice of God the win of God now
[1:15:22] you'll find no real man amen
[1:15:24] that's exactly right so see he bought
[1:15:27] out men too but see he had he had a
[1:15:30] complex about women so he struggled with
[1:15:32] that now the things from the Bible we
[1:15:34] said are true all these things but I'm
[1:15:37] letting you know this Solomon he seems
[1:15:39] to be placing all the blame upon the
[1:15:42] women that set traps for him
[1:15:45] [Music]
[1:15:47] that'd be just like as we were talking
[1:15:49] let me just like well well I I got
[1:15:52] caught up into this dirty joking and and
[1:15:55] it was all that person's fault and I
[1:15:57] laughed at it and I just said a dirty
[1:15:58] joke back no it's not their fault it's
[1:16:00] your fault because you should have been
[1:16:02] so strong the Bible said you should cast
[1:16:04] down anything that exalts itself against
[1:16:07] the Word of God the Bible said take cap
[1:16:10] into captivity any thought that exposes
[1:16:13] itself against the Word of God take that
[1:16:15] into captivity and cast it down in Jesus
[1:16:17] name
[1:16:18] don't let it be exalted in your mind
[1:16:20] don't let it be exalted we're supposed
[1:16:22] to be kings and priests this morning
[1:16:24] amen
[1:16:24] we're supposed to be spiritual rulers
[1:16:27] that can judge between right and wrong
[1:16:29] and cast out evil and let the good reign
[1:16:32] in our lives
[1:16:33] amen oh I feel free in the holy spirit
[1:16:36] this morning amen I do yeah praise God
[1:16:41] now is there truth of this of course I
[1:16:44] believe spiritually it's more true
[1:16:46] because spiritually out of a thousand
[1:16:49] churches you're to be hard to find one
[1:16:51] good one because remember any group of
[1:16:53] religious people is a church according
[1:16:55] to the Bible any gathering this morning
[1:16:58] where people are gathering the Bible
[1:17:01] calls it a woman because Christ is the
[1:17:03] man and the people are likened unto
[1:17:05] women is that right amen
[1:17:09] that's why our church is called Bride of
[1:17:11] Christ fellowship because we want to be
[1:17:13] married to Jesus Christ the husband the
[1:17:17] Bible said this is a great mystery but
[1:17:19] marriage is a symbol of Christ and the
[1:17:22] church he's the husband and we're
[1:17:25] supposed to be the obedient wife
[1:17:27] thankfully our husband never makes any
[1:17:29] mistakes amen
[1:17:31] he's never gonna apologize he's the
[1:17:33] God's got never got to change anything
[1:17:35] he said everything he says right is
[1:17:37] perfect the first time
[1:17:38] we're the ones we have to humble
[1:17:40] ourselves and apologize amen but not
[1:17:43] true in the natural many times the most
[1:17:45] mistakes I make in our marriage is my
[1:17:47] mistake that's just what brother Branham
[1:17:49] said you know brother may have said he
[1:17:50] said my wife is my correction did you
[1:17:52] brothers know that said brothers don't
[1:17:55] you know my wife is my correction I've
[1:17:58] had that so many times I left Church and
[1:17:59] we're on the drive home and now I'm
[1:18:01] I'm scared to talk to my wife when after
[1:18:02] I get done preaching she's gonna point
[1:18:04] out my mistakes which I appreciate well
[1:18:08] you know as a man I don't want to make
[1:18:10] any mistakes I don't want to I don't
[1:18:12] want to make any mistakes but many times
[1:18:14] my wife has helped me see where I might
[1:18:16] have overlooked something made a mistake
[1:18:17] said something wrong and I appreciate
[1:18:19] that I don't want to be wrong I want to
[1:18:22] be right and whatever channel God can
[1:18:25] use to get me to be right
[1:18:26] I say hallelujah to that so Solomon out
[1:18:33] of a thousand women didn't find one
[1:18:36] godly well it depends where you go
[1:18:37] looking if you go to the Cleveland
[1:18:41] Browns game today you're gonna have a
[1:18:42] hard time finding a thousand do it one
[1:18:43] good woman out of a thousand or a man
[1:18:46] because they're all drunk with their dog
[1:18:47] faces on and cussing and swearing and
[1:18:49] cursing the dealers or Patriots whoever
[1:18:52] it is you're and the Bible says if you
[1:18:53] say one evil word the Bible said your
[1:18:55] religions in vain think about all those
[1:18:59] customers they say the Bible says if you
[1:19:00] say one cuss word your religions in vain
[1:19:03] your religion is not working inside of
[1:19:06] you our religion should work so that
[1:19:08] only good things fall out of our mouths
[1:19:10] and we have nothing good to say we
[1:19:11] shouldn't say anything at all it'd be
[1:19:15] hard to find one good man down there at
[1:19:16] Cleveland this morning unless they're
[1:19:17] playing away game it'd be hard to find
[1:19:19] out wherever they're at I think you
[1:19:21] understand what I'm saying or the Cavs
[1:19:23] game last night or whoever played last
[1:19:24] night or the house Tate game yesterday I
[1:19:26] know they played in Columbus yesterday
[1:19:27] because woman was talking to me about it
[1:19:29] on the Verizon on the phone so it's hard
[1:19:33] it's hard to find a godly person if
[1:19:36] you're looking in the wrong spot now say
[1:19:39] like this is we know Jesus said few
[1:19:41] there be that find it it's gonna be hard
[1:19:42] to find godly people today in this hour
[1:19:45] that's right now let's go to
[1:19:47] Ecclesiastes chapter 8
[1:19:48] how many put on time yeah I appreciate
[1:19:53] - I appreciate that these ask you
[1:19:56] chapter 8 let's go a little bit further
[1:19:58] here and then I want to stop and I want
[1:19:59] to do some there's some foundations for
[1:20:02] our sister Tanya it's good to see her by
[1:20:03] God's grace the Lord bless you sister
[1:20:08] now I think we'll just maybe get down
[1:20:10] here we'll try to get maybe through like
[1:20:15] the first we'll try to maybe down and
[1:20:19] get down to verse 13 or something like
[1:20:20] that I hope everybody can see that I
[1:20:24] don't want to have a you know I've heard
[1:20:26] many churches especially the message
[1:20:27] where the preachers get in the flesh and
[1:20:30] they just condemn women all the time
[1:20:31] there are more harsh on the women than
[1:20:33] they in the met than they are the men
[1:20:34] and they let the men do evil things and
[1:20:36] they won't say nothing about it shame on
[1:20:38] the churches that do that God has one
[1:20:41] standard for everybody man or woman
[1:20:43] everybody needs to obey the Word of God
[1:20:44] no one's above any other as far as
[1:20:47] they're in their stance and as far as in
[1:20:49] the eyes of God now of course the Bible
[1:20:51] says men are called to lead men are
[1:20:53] leaders but all that means is they have
[1:20:54] more responsibility enough to answer to
[1:20:57] God at the day of judgment for more
[1:20:59] responsibility praise God remember in
[1:21:04] the beginning Eve was a helpmate so as
[1:21:07] sisters as your the wives you're
[1:21:08] supposed to just support the vision that
[1:21:11] your husband got from God Almighty how
[1:21:14] do you aim in your husband's supposed to
[1:21:16] pray and seek God until he catches the
[1:21:18] vision of God and then she's there to
[1:21:21] complete you she's there to complete you
[1:21:24] and help you amen
[1:21:26] that's exactly right I thank God for my
[1:21:29] wife she's helped me that she's just
[1:21:30] been a tremendous help mate the vision
[1:21:33] God gave me to Pastor a church 12 years
[1:21:35] ago sometimes I think I was crazy for
[1:21:37] starting a church but you wouldn't have
[1:21:39] to tell me that 12 years ago and I'm
[1:21:42] okay with it now of course you know but
[1:21:44] there's just so much the constant
[1:21:46] pressure like as soon as I get done with
[1:21:47] the service today
[1:21:48] I'll have that pressure oh you know you
[1:21:49] got to get a sermon ready for Wednesday
[1:21:51] it's just like and that could great if I
[1:21:53] don't balance that if I don't let off
[1:21:55] the pressure and just relax and pray
[1:21:56] that pressure makes me feel stressed out
[1:21:59] at home and that makes the atmosphere at
[1:22:02] home not very good either so
[1:22:05] learn better learn continually how to
[1:22:08] balance that pressure but my wife helps
[1:22:10] me by the grace of the Lord she's called
[1:22:12] the vision amen all right Robert please
[1:22:16] ask each chapter eight let's try to
[1:22:17] maybe get through the first let's read
[1:22:19] verse one who is as the wise man and who
[1:22:22] knoweth the interpretation of a thing a
[1:22:24] man's wisdom maketh his face to shine
[1:22:27] and the boldness of his face shall be
[1:22:29] changed
[1:22:31] now honey know that when you have the
[1:22:36] glory of God upon you the Bible says a
[1:22:38] merry heart maketh medicine how many
[1:22:41] know the Bible says that when you're
[1:22:42] happy in the things of God your smile or
[1:22:46] your words or your heart is like
[1:22:48] medicine how many know that your smile
[1:22:52] your life your countenance your joy your
[1:22:55] happiness if you should be like a
[1:22:56] walking medicine around the people that
[1:22:58] you are amen can I just read this out of
[1:23:02] friend text me on Friday morning let me
[1:23:04] just read this to you I thought it was a
[1:23:06] blessing he says he said I do have to
[1:23:12] say I'm so blessed to be around people
[1:23:14] like you your you say he said you're
[1:23:17] God's true disciple I didn't ask him to
[1:23:18] say this he said thank you for being the
[1:23:21] voice of God he said Oh hallelujah
[1:23:25] he said thank you I got it right here I
[1:23:28] can show you after if you want to see it
[1:23:29] he said they give her being the voice of
[1:23:31] God it helps especially since some of us
[1:23:33] get off track he says now hundred ask
[1:23:36] for this but he's looking at me saying
[1:23:38] you're a true disciple and you are he
[1:23:41] said the voice of God to me Church isn't
[1:23:44] that what all of us should be we should
[1:23:46] all be voices of God amen
[1:23:48] arrived she just speaks something about
[1:23:51] God is holy God is to be served God is
[1:23:54] to be worshiped God has to be reverence
[1:23:56] god is good God is faithful
[1:23:58] God's Word is true our lives should be
[1:24:00] voices of God amen
[1:24:02] it's exactly right and if you are the
[1:24:08] voice of God then your face shines the
[1:24:11] Bible says
[1:24:13] glory a man's wisdom maketh his face to
[1:24:17] shine how do you get god's face to shine
[1:24:24] upon you obey the word of god because
[1:24:26] even sinners you see him on the cover of
[1:24:28] People magazine and a National Inquirer
[1:24:30] you see sinners smiling there and yet
[1:24:32] you know they're in the homosexuality or
[1:24:34] or they're in them they murdered people
[1:24:36] or something like that and yet they can
[1:24:39] sit there and smile now the way to know
[1:24:41] how come sinners can smile and Christian
[1:24:43] smile too well the way to know is start
[1:24:46] talking about the Word of God amen
[1:24:50] tell them that it's a sin to murder tell
[1:24:52] them it's a sin to watch dirty filthy
[1:24:55] shows like that tell them it's a sin to
[1:24:56] homosexuality and all these and then
[1:24:59] watch their face after that now you'll
[1:25:02] see who's got the countenance of the
[1:25:04] Lord now praise God
[1:25:06] amen as that's exactly right see anybody
[1:25:11] can smile that's not that what he's
[1:25:12] talking about
[1:25:13] he's talking about when the word is in
[1:25:15] your life now who has the countenance of
[1:25:17] God upon their face remember Stephen was
[1:25:21] getting stoned the Bible said his face
[1:25:23] look angel and all the other faces were
[1:25:26] all angry and throws those why because
[1:25:29] he was saying you guys need the Holy
[1:25:31] Ghost you need to get born again and
[1:25:33] that's what we're saying these
[1:25:34] denominations the Holy Ghost they got to
[1:25:37] be born to get amen and if we're not
[1:25:39] born again then you better get born
[1:25:41] again amen
[1:25:42] and now your response to that shows what
[1:25:46] kind of face you got amen
[1:25:49] I see some good faces in here that's
[1:25:51] wonderful now it shows the wisdom of God
[1:25:57] what have you told some your closest
[1:26:00] friend your family member your church is
[1:26:01] actually off the Word of God your church
[1:26:03] is Baxton your church is filled with
[1:26:05] doctrines of devils jesus said now watch
[1:26:08] their face see who responds well to that
[1:26:11] one oh of course it is yeah I love going
[1:26:13] to a church that has doctrines of devils
[1:26:15] yes well then that's so deep a demon
[1:26:17] spirit - right but tell somebody how
[1:26:21] long they are in the word and then watch
[1:26:23] their countenance that will show how
[1:26:25] much wisdom they
[1:26:27] it's exactly right
[1:26:29] the proof is k-member God said Cain if
[1:26:32] you sacrifice like Abel by the blood of
[1:26:35] the Lamb you'll be accepted the Bible
[1:26:37] said his countenance got angry and he
[1:26:39] turned from the perfect will of God
[1:26:40] brother Branham said he turned from them
[1:26:42] and the Bible his countenance got angry
[1:26:44] and wrathful and he went out the prints
[1:26:46] of God he went and killed his brother
[1:26:48] right after that so your countenance
[1:26:51] says a lot your countenance in church
[1:26:52] your countenance when you're reading
[1:26:54] your Bible your countenance when you're
[1:26:56] hearing the word of God there's a big
[1:26:57] important part to that brother Aaron
[1:26:59] even says when demons know they're gonna
[1:27:01] be exposed he said their people's faces
[1:27:03] get all different and all nervous and
[1:27:04] all upset and all angry like that and
[1:27:06] I've seen it before
[1:27:07] people don't like you preaching on their
[1:27:09] sins and so their faces get all angry
[1:27:11] and all I had and get all kind of
[1:27:13] looking down and won't look in the eye
[1:27:15] all over there's something about the
[1:27:17] glory of God on the face that knows
[1:27:19] their life is innocent that knows their
[1:27:21] forgiving that knows they may they've
[1:27:24] given those true worship to God there's
[1:27:26] something about that face that is rise
[1:27:28] and it has the countenance of God's
[1:27:30] glory on it oh yes sir
[1:27:34] oh my verse two thank you lord
[1:27:44] yeah these these sinners all over the
[1:27:47] media there they smile but yeah give
[1:27:49] them the word test see if their smile
[1:27:50] for that verse - I counsel lead to keep
[1:27:54] the Kings commandment and in the regard
[1:27:56] of the oath of God be not hasty to go
[1:27:59] out of his sight stand not in an evil
[1:28:02] thing for he doeth what server pleases
[1:28:04] him so was talking about being in the
[1:28:05] presence of a king be very careful the
[1:28:08] prends of the king shouldn't we apply
[1:28:09] that to ourselves we should be very
[1:28:11] careful how we act in the presence of
[1:28:13] the King King Jesus now look at verse 4
[1:28:19] where the
[1:28:21] King is there's power and who may say
[1:28:25] unto Him what doest thou whoso keeping
[1:28:28] the commandments shall feel no evil
[1:28:29] thing in a wise man's heart discern if
[1:28:31] both time and judgment now we can look
[1:28:35] at this at the eyes of Jesus how many
[1:28:37] know Jesus is the king of kings and Lord
[1:28:39] of lords there's power in the words of
[1:28:42] Jesus now let me bring it down to you
[1:28:46] how many are spiritual Kingdom priests
[1:28:48] unto God the Bible says we are we are
[1:28:51] kings and priests right now and if you
[1:28:55] are a king then you've got power in your
[1:28:57] spoken word jesus said if you say to
[1:29:01] this mountain be moved and cast in the
[1:29:04] sea you'll have what you asked for
[1:29:06] amen and we got to be careful how we use
[1:29:09] that we just can't throw that around and
[1:29:11] try to do what we ever we want we've
[1:29:13] gotta wait until God gives us the option
[1:29:16] or gives us the inspiration it said then
[1:29:18] when it's said like that then it will
[1:29:20] come to pass like I told you with my
[1:29:22] friend Tom Atkinson I went the prayer
[1:29:23] closet that night I heard about it and I
[1:29:25] cried I said God I speak to that
[1:29:27] mountain in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:29:29] I command that heart condition to move
[1:29:30] the next day he opened his eyes amen the
[1:29:34] next week he was talking the week after
[1:29:36] that he was walking the week after that
[1:29:38] he was home and I'm still trying to set
[1:29:39] up an opportunity to go talk to him hey
[1:29:41] man you see it was speaking to them I
[1:29:44] didn't do it it wasn't me it was
[1:29:45] something inside of me amen
[1:29:47] it wasn't me if something is it isn't
[1:29:50] you it's something behind you it it's
[1:29:53] something in you
[1:29:54] God's got to move you to do that hey man
[1:29:57] remember 2015 Jose we spoke to that
[1:30:00] mountain of infertility and to two women
[1:30:02] got their babies they could have babies
[1:30:03] to him and got babies in 2015 because a
[1:30:06] king the word of the king there's power
[1:30:09] amen
[1:30:11] it's exactly right Jesus said speak the
[1:30:15] word we've got to speak the word and now
[1:30:16] remember what the Bible said I can do
[1:30:18] all things through Christ which
[1:30:20] strengtheneth me let's say together
[1:30:21] ready I can do all things through Christ
[1:30:25] which strengtheneth me amen
[1:30:27] we've got to say that more when things
[1:30:29] get hard we've got to say that out loud
[1:30:31] I can do all things through Christ who
[1:30:33] strengthens me
[1:30:35] amen you cannot question the king you've
[1:30:39] got to keep the command of the king in
[1:30:41] fear no evil hallelujah
[1:30:43] now let's go down to verse it's here
[1:30:52] because every purpose there is time and
[1:30:54] judgment therefore the misery of man is
[1:30:58] great upon him and look with this guy's
[1:30:59] look at Solomon I love Solomon but
[1:31:01] listen Church he wasn't born again and
[1:31:03] so we've got to be careful how we read
[1:31:05] Ecclesiastes if we're not careful we'll
[1:31:08] just have a complex against every woman
[1:31:10] well saman couldn't find one out of a
[1:31:11] thousand what about you judging women
[1:31:13] now you're the evil one right Lydia like
[1:31:17] that one there amen
[1:31:20] see that makes you self-righteousness
[1:31:23] see there's not even all these women
[1:31:25] can't even at my job they don't even
[1:31:27] treat me good well it's probably because
[1:31:29] you've got an awful attitude on you the
[1:31:31] attitude on you probably jumped on them
[1:31:33] or vice versa exactly right but see look
[1:31:39] what he says he says man it has great
[1:31:42] misery because he knows all things will
[1:31:44] come into God's judgment a church I
[1:31:47] don't know about you that sounds like a
[1:31:49] pretty depressed King brother hey man my
[1:31:53] life is just filled with misery because
[1:31:54] I know all my works are gonna come into
[1:31:57] God's judgement why would you be
[1:32:00] miserable as a Christian this man says
[1:32:05] every man is miserable because he knows
[1:32:07] God's going to judge him but then the
[1:32:09] Bible says in the New Testament that we
[1:32:12] should have joy unspeakable and full of
[1:32:15] glory amen
[1:32:17] Solomon saying is all miserable thinking
[1:32:20] about the judgments of God but then Paul
[1:32:22] says I can't wait to be offered he said
[1:32:25] because I've got a crown of
[1:32:26] righteousness waiting there for me
[1:32:28] praise God
[1:32:29] amen hallelujah he said in Paul said
[1:32:35] Jesus will show himself to all those
[1:32:37] that love his appearing so Solomon sees
[1:32:40] and men are filled with misery when they
[1:32:42] when they meet God but Paul's saying oh
[1:32:44] when you see Jesus you'll love him
[1:32:47] because you'll be like
[1:32:48] Jim amen you see this this is written by
[1:32:53] a man who is back slit and God was angry
[1:32:56] with him of course he's going to be
[1:32:58] miserable thinking about the day of
[1:33:00] judgment because God's angry with him
[1:33:02] but the Bible says Christians have peace
[1:33:05] with God through the blood of Jesus
[1:33:07] Christ in other words you say God
[1:33:09] forgive me when that evil deal forgive
[1:33:12] me when I said that forgive me when I
[1:33:13] hate that person forgive me when I
[1:33:15] mystery that and you really mean it when
[1:33:17] you say that the blood washes all your
[1:33:19] sins away and you'll not answer for that
[1:33:22] day man
[1:33:23] Laurie and if you repeat a little that
[1:33:26] there's a crown of righteousness waiting
[1:33:29] for you that the Lord Himself will give
[1:33:31] you because you fought the good fight
[1:33:33] you've won the war you've run the race
[1:33:35] and God's going to give you a crown of
[1:33:37] righteousness amen
[1:33:41] every time Aaron talks about somebody
[1:33:43] died and they're happy right FF Bosworth
[1:33:46] he was happy
[1:33:48] Paul Rader he was happy he said this is
[1:33:51] my coronation day this is my crowning
[1:33:53] day in other words lower amen
[1:33:56] he wasn't scared to meet God because he
[1:33:58] knew the blood of Jesus Christ forgave
[1:34:01] them of all sins so should we know that
[1:34:03] today the blood forgives us of all of
[1:34:06] our transgressions if not it's time to
[1:34:09] talk to Jesus after church there's an
[1:34:11] altar right here if you knew that your
[1:34:13] seat or dude here your choice but you
[1:34:15] better talk to Jesus and make it right
[1:34:18] amen amen
[1:34:20] glory that's what the Word of God says
[1:34:22] no more on Sunday night but the RAM said
[1:34:25] you are not saved because you feel safe
[1:34:27] and many times I don't feel safe I'm
[1:34:30] saying because I've met God's
[1:34:32] requirements Amen I'm saying because
[1:34:35] God's Word cannot fail and I've met the
[1:34:38] requirements of God's Word so no matter
[1:34:40] what I feel I'm saved because God
[1:34:42] promised they men and God will not break
[1:34:45] his promise amen
[1:34:47] hallelujah there's misery so he's so
[1:34:53] depressed
[1:34:53] there's misery on every man all life is
[1:34:56] so miserable because God's gonna judge
[1:34:58] me
[1:34:58] you should have felt like that if you
[1:35:01] done the thing Solomon did you
[1:35:02] good feel like that if you let a
[1:35:07] thousand demons into your life if you
[1:35:09] built if you fill up your home instead
[1:35:11] of the things with God and you filled
[1:35:12] your home up with Hollywood or something
[1:35:14] like that yeah you ought to fear God on
[1:35:16] the day of judgment but if the blood of
[1:35:18] Jesus Christ has so cleanse your heart
[1:35:21] and your motives and your objectives and
[1:35:22] your thoughts that now you let that
[1:35:25] wisdom flow out of you - cleans out your
[1:35:27] natural house - cleans out the things in
[1:35:30] your car still cleans out the things in
[1:35:32] your office now you're getting closer to
[1:35:34] God and you have no fear on Judgment Day
[1:35:38] it's exactly right
[1:35:40] oh ho thank you Jesus amen glory that's
[1:35:51] the give her seven I'm sorry please ask
[1:36:00] these eight verse let me go back and
[1:36:02] we'll go back to verse 6 because every
[1:36:04] purpose there was time and judgment
[1:36:05] there for the misery of man is great
[1:36:07] upon him Church I don't live on ms i
[1:36:09] don't live a life full of misery to you
[1:36:11] if you do you've got to let that load of
[1:36:14] sin off you've got to lay it down at the
[1:36:17] cross of Jesus Christ
[1:36:19] if life it's miserable and you know you
[1:36:21] got all these sins bound upon you then
[1:36:23] you've come to the right place this
[1:36:24] morning
[1:36:25] a man you come to the right place
[1:36:27] because Jesus is inviting all of us to
[1:36:30] lay down our sins confess your faults
[1:36:32] one to another then lay hands on them
[1:36:34] and pray for them and God shall forgive
[1:36:36] oh hey man glory that's the way God
[1:36:40] brings his children into the kingdom of
[1:36:42] God it's exactly right you're walking
[1:36:46] around with the miserable countenance
[1:36:47] it's time you got a new countenance the
[1:36:49] time you left there's the sunshine of
[1:36:51] God shine upon your face
[1:36:53] oh thank you Jesus I remember when I got

[1:37:02] outlook on life a new joy a new hope
[1:37:04] that nothing else could give me praise
[1:37:07] God verse 7 for he knows not which shall

[1:37:24] and when but the Christians like it does

[1:37:30] God's time you may not know how you may
[1:37:35] not know when but he'll do it again a
[1:37:37] man there's a good song right there
[1:37:38] brakes God but the person would the
[1:37:41] midst of the person living in misery and

[1:38:08] over the spirit to retain the Spirit
[1:38:10] sees much of those rich people want to
[1:38:13] try to pay the doctors to keep alive
[1:38:14] they're gonna be here they're not gonna
[1:38:16] be here on one second longer than God
[1:38:18] wants them to be neither happy power in
[1:38:21] the day of death and there's no
[1:38:22] discharge in that war oh well there is
[1:38:26] actually there's a resurrection brace
[1:38:28] God amen
[1:38:30] I'd say most the time there's no
[1:38:32] discharge in that war but Lazarus had a
[1:38:34] discharge Church all right with me death
[1:38:37] and death was keeping him for a while
[1:38:38] but I was suddeniy sir excuse me
[1:38:40] brothers I hear that I heard Jesus

[1:38:52] there's life in the voice of God there's
[1:38:54] life and the wisdom of God life from the
[1:38:58] mouth of Jesus call Youm come forth and
[1:39:00] one day he'll call all of us forth amen

[1:39:05] us all forth and we'll shall go to meet
[1:39:08] him in the meeting in the air Amen
[1:39:10] hallelujah because that's the unchanging
[1:39:13] Word of God hallelujah there's no
[1:39:18] discharge in that war neither shall
[1:39:20] wickedness deliver those that are given
[1:39:22] to well that's true and that's that
[1:39:23] part's true now let me read this
[1:39:27] for mother baron from 1963 victory day
[1:39:29] he says it seems like the Christian life
[1:39:31] if the fellow is not absolutely centered
[1:39:35] on Christ the Christian life it seems
[1:39:38] like it holds so many disappointments
[1:39:42] praise God
[1:39:44] if you and I don't keep our lot balanced
[1:39:48] upon the Word of God if we don't let our
[1:39:51] life just be balanced on the word we get
[1:39:54] an off balance what's gonna happen if
[1:39:58] you don't say right on the middle of the
[1:39:59] row with the Word of God and get
[1:40:01] unbalanced life's gonna seem like so
[1:40:04] disappointing life is so miserable why
[1:40:08] am i I all mind well as might as well
[1:40:10] just end it it's so miserable
[1:40:14] Somnath end of his life so this is so
[1:40:16] miserable but Ron tells us when your
[1:40:19] life is not centered on the word you get
[1:40:22] miserable you get disappointed with life
[1:40:25] because you think you should be getting
[1:40:27] something else or something else should
[1:40:29] be happening the thing to do is Center
[1:40:32] your life on Christ so that you know
[1:40:34] you're standing and obeying every word
[1:40:37] of God then you have a place to stand
[1:40:40] then when the storms of life come you
[1:40:42] built your house upon a rock and those
[1:40:45] storms will make you depress those
[1:40:47] storms will take away your hope those
[1:40:49] thorns won't take away your joy because
[1:40:51] you're centered on the rock of God's
[1:40:53] Word
[1:40:54] amen pastoring has not been a
[1:40:59] disappointment by the Amen for the Aaron
[1:41:03] being a husband of seven children has
[1:41:05] not been a disappointment brother it's
[1:41:07] been a blessing praise God it's because
[1:41:13] I've centered my life on the Word of God
[1:41:16] that means everything at home is got to
[1:41:18] go through the word first if it breaks
[1:41:20] the Word of God if it has any sin in it
[1:41:22] it's got to go it cannot stay in my
[1:41:25] house because my house has to be
[1:41:26] centered on the Word of God I don't want
[1:41:30] to unbalance house where they're sitting
[1:41:32] there and then they're lightening to fly
[1:41:35] feels so disappointment Wow I regret
[1:41:37] this I should have did this I should
[1:41:38] have done that no Eve we were happy
[1:41:40] that we obey the Word of God amen
[1:41:47] now I better stop right there let me
[1:41:50] make let me make a note right here I'm
[1:41:53] stopping right here can I just say one
[1:41:58] more thing though about Solomon before
[1:41:59] we close or before we move on to this
[1:42:01] foundational thing this the thought just
[1:42:04] struck me yesterday now Church we hear
[1:42:06] so many things and it's true jesus said
[1:42:08] a greater than Solomon is here we hear
[1:42:10] always hear so many things about Saha
[1:42:12] Solomon was so great and Church he was
[1:42:14] at the beginning but not at the end
[1:42:20] the Bible says better is the end of a
[1:42:23] thing than the beginning of it so
[1:42:27] Solomon's walk is more important how he
[1:42:29] walked at the end of his life I think a
[1:42:31] sister Beatrice who has grandchildren
[1:42:32] now I think of my mother-in-law has
[1:42:36] grandchildren now there there there
[1:42:39] towards more towards the end of their
[1:42:40] life I'm almost 40 oh you know the Bible
[1:42:42] says you got I got 70 years so I'm over
[1:42:44] half way past my halfway point here but
[1:42:49] the end of our lives should look so
[1:42:51] grand or our lives should have such a
[1:42:54] testimony at the end the end should be
[1:42:57] better than the beginning praise God
[1:42:58] amen and we've got to make sure we don't
[1:43:01] get discouraged while we're on the way
[1:43:02] to the end and compromise on the word or
[1:43:05] or disobey the Word of God we've got to
[1:43:08] stay with the word we got to keep our
[1:43:10] revival as Jesus said we've got to keep
[1:43:12] him as our first love we've got a love

[1:43:26] word has to be the thing we love the
[1:43:28] most
[1:43:28] amen and that was that's my testimony
[1:43:32] back then when I first started serving
[1:43:33] Jesus and that's my testimony now amen
[1:43:36] that the Word of God is our first love
[1:43:42] the end of the
[1:43:43] life is better than the beginning
[1:43:45] because you can look back and see the
[1:43:47] fruits of all your labors ha ha ha the
[1:43:51] end of the harvest season is better than
[1:43:53] the beginning and the church said my
[1:43:56] wife and children plant a lot of seeds
[1:43:58] at the beginning and they talk about all
[1:43:59] the weeding and all the hot and all
[1:44:01] things like that but I'll tell you the
[1:44:03] end of the end of the planting season is
[1:44:05] better than the beginning amen I see
[1:44:07] Malachi carrying the potatoes or see the
[1:44:09] girls carrying the peppers oh ma the end
[1:44:12] is better than the beginning so as
[1:44:15] Christians we can look back and say
[1:44:16] thank God that God saved me there thank
[1:44:19] God that God saved me there thank God
[1:44:21] that he provided there now I can see the
[1:44:23] fruits in my life look what God's
[1:44:25] accomplished look what he's done in me
[1:44:27] it was all his grace and now I'm ready
[1:44:29] for the harvest amen amen
[1:44:33] the end of it's better than the
[1:44:35] beginning amen and I know church that's
[1:44:39] going to be true for me the end of my
[1:44:40] life is going to be more powerful than
[1:44:42] the beginning because if God Terry I'll
[1:44:44] be to look back and say it's a good
[1:44:46] thing you didn't let that TV in your
[1:44:47] house with all the the Netflix and the
[1:44:49] rock and roll the good thing is paid
[1:44:52] tithes and offerings and put God first
[1:44:53] it's a good thing you always went to
[1:44:55] church more than the football games and
[1:44:57] basketball games
[1:44:58] hallelujah it's a good thing you didn't
[1:45:01] let your girls wear those sexy clothes
[1:45:03] and good thing to let maokai watch so
[1:45:05] sexy movie things like that it's going
[1:45:08] to be better at the end because I'll be
[1:45:11] able to see the fruits of love look you
[1:45:13] baptized for your hopefully all seven of
[1:45:15] your children hopefully now I'm looking
[1:45:17] ahead you know looking back right
[1:45:18] looking ahead then looking back all your
[1:45:21] children are serving God all your
[1:45:23] children look maybe your son's doing
[1:45:25] this maybe your daughter's doing this
[1:45:26] for the kingdom of God that's the that's
[1:45:28] that's what we want to see at the end we
[1:45:30] know n will be greater than the
[1:45:32] beginning praise God
[1:45:36] let me say this last thing that's what I
[1:45:39] couldn't can't even get to it
[1:45:41] Thank You Lord glory Solomon was so
[1:45:46] great in the eyes of men but then Jesus
[1:45:49] come around a thousand years late and he
[1:45:52] said I Got News for you
[1:45:54] he said you were not to see a prophet
[1:45:56] John the Baptist
[1:45:57] attea he was more than a prophet he said
[1:46:01] this is my messenger which was set
[1:46:03] before you to prepare the way of the
[1:46:05] Lord and he said no man born of a woman
[1:46:09] is greater than John the Baptist
[1:46:12] hallelujah why because some and just
[1:46:15] taught the wisdom of God for a few years
[1:46:17] he just got the wisdom but John hailed
[1:46:20] the word amen Solomon was hearing
[1:46:26] hearing the word thinking about the word
[1:46:28] thinking about the earth but John always
[1:46:30] thought about it he held it amen he held
[1:46:33] the Word of God and baptized him and
[1:46:36] then so the Holy Ghost has said can you
[1:46:38] imagine it must been right next to him
[1:46:40] right there imagine he's trembling at
[1:46:46] the presence of God nobody else there
[1:46:48] just kind of what time is it time to go
[1:46:51] they bee's been baptized some people
[1:46:53] holiday who's ready to go home and have
[1:46:55] some some lunch their John's Truman the
[1:46:59] greatest man born of woman greater than
[1:47:02] Solomon amen and he saw the Holy Ghost
[1:47:05] descending like a dove kuhu kuhu
[1:47:09] cool and the Bible said that abode
[1:47:13] anointed Jesus and remained on him Jesus
[1:47:18] went down he came up anointed with the
[1:47:22] Holy Ghost and now when Jesus walked out
[1:47:26] Larry said John didn't you baptize Jesus
[1:47:28] he said follow him over there may man
[1:47:32] the greatest man born a woman did not
[1:47:35] point to himself he pointed to Jesus
[1:47:37] Christ amen
[1:47:38] the anointed Jesus Christ the Anointed
[1:47:41] Messiah even grand Solomon a man because
[1:47:46] he handled that word that word was made
[1:47:48] flesh it wasn't just 3,000 proverbs it
[1:47:52] was a living proverb watch that the word
[1:47:56] was made flesh and dwelt among us Jesus
[1:47:59] was the Word made flesh and that made
[1:48:03] him greater than Solomon saman had 40
[1:48:07] years as king
[1:48:09] John the Baptist had six months brother
[1:48:11] Jose haha and six months of ministry was
[1:48:15] greater than 40 years of ministry
[1:48:17] because of Solomon's backsliding the end
[1:48:22] of a thing is better than the beginning
[1:48:25] you might have started off serving God
[1:48:27] really good with Church we can't stop
[1:48:29] there we've got to keep serving God you
[1:48:33] got to keep your zeal what's you got to
[1:48:35] keep your hunger what's what's more
[1:48:37] enjoyable than the Word of God
[1:48:39] what's taking the place of the Word of
[1:48:40] God nothing should be more important
[1:48:42] than the Word of God amen
[1:48:47] so that thought struck me last night I
[1:48:49] went to bed I was the too tired to get
[1:48:51] up and write down I said Lord if you'll
[1:48:53] just remember I'm sorry you'll just
[1:48:54] remind me that tomorrow I'll preach that
[1:48:56] by your grace thanks for reminding me
[1:48:59] was that a blessing to you see some if
[1:49:02] we're not careful we have to put Solomon
[1:49:04] away above everybody else in fact if
[1:49:05] you're not careful you'll put Solomon
[1:49:07] above GE or brother branham or Jesus now
[1:49:10] no one's above Jesus but we hear Solomon
[1:49:13] was the wisest wisest wisest but in all
[1:49:15] reality John the Baptist was greater
[1:49:17] than Solomon because he handled the Word
[1:49:23] of God he prepared the way for the
[1:49:27] Messiah and how'd he do it by preaching
[1:49:31] against sin the hey man
[1:49:34] Laurie amen that's how he saw me he
[1:49:39] became greater he lived what he preached
[1:49:44] he lived what he preached all right give
[1:49:50] me 50 let me just do 15 minutes I've
[1:49:52] already preached 45 minutes just give me
[1:49:53] 15 minutes let me sister Tonya this
[1:49:55] gonna be for you okay all right sister
[1:49:59] Talia I apologize I've thought about
[1:50:00] having Bible studies with you too most
[1:50:02] more slowly teach these things but I
[1:50:05] just forgot about it so please forgive
[1:50:07] me let's just take a few moments here
[1:50:09] and I'll show you in the scripture some
[1:50:10] of our beliefs okay is that all right
[1:50:12] sister Lord bless you praise God and we
[1:50:17] all know it's God that brought you here
[1:50:19] remember God even healed our sisters
[1:50:21] good had trouble raising her arm and we
[1:50:23] prayed for we bound that devil and loser
[1:50:26] from that devil and your arms okay is
[1:50:28] that right sister
[1:50:29] oh yeah praise the Lord amen God is
[1:50:33] healing people in our midst not only
[1:50:35] physically but spiritually amen and only
[1:50:40] Jesus can do a church now we're giving
[1:50:42] all the glory to Jesus amen will tell of
[1:50:45] his wonderful love we'll give him all
[1:50:47] the glory to Jesus and tell this
[1:50:49] wonderful love so it runs to sixteen I
[1:50:52] just want to read it so our sister Tanya
[1:50:56] knows this but if you haven't heard this
[1:50:58] lately I hope you'll I hope you'll grab
[1:51:01] on to it and not let it leave your heart
[1:51:09] alright so Romans 2:16 now who can read
[1:51:13] that for me what is someone like to read
[1:51:14] that out loud for me
[1:51:17] amen
[1:51:18] here we roll out Romans 2:16 now leave
[1:51:27] out there Lydia now sister Tanya the
[1:51:29] most one of the most important things
[1:51:30] I'd ever like to start with with you is
[1:51:32] that Paul said each one of us will be
[1:51:34] judged by what's written in this book we
[1:51:38] might have secrets that we hide from
[1:51:39] people and we just wouldn't tell them
[1:51:41] and that's fine I mean now if we've
[1:51:43] sinned against somebody we need to go
[1:51:44] tell them that if we really hurt
[1:51:46] somebody we that we can't we shouldn't
[1:51:48] keep that a secret
[1:51:48] but maybe there's things we've done
[1:51:50] we're so ashamed of we don't have to
[1:51:51] really share those secrets but we've got
[1:51:53] to confess it to Jesus Christ say Lord
[1:51:57] I'm sorry forgive me help me to never do
[1:51:59] that again because listen we're all
[1:52:00] gonna stand before the judgment seat and
[1:52:02] the judge is gonna have this book open
[1:52:04] and they'll say Jesse Smith I'll say yes
[1:52:06] sir you know the angel Lord you know
[1:52:09] you're here to answer for all the work
[1:52:11] she did on this earth and I'll say yes
[1:52:12] sir
[1:52:12] and you say I'm judging you by the
[1:52:14] gospel that you preached amen and we
[1:52:19] were all sister we all have to stand
[1:52:21] there and Jesus Christ is going to judge
[1:52:24] us by what Paul wrote because the Bible
[1:52:27] says that Jesus Christ gave it to Paul
[1:52:30] let's read that Galatians one Lydia
[1:52:32] pulled up I believe this Galatians 1 12
[1:52:34] I know it's right around there
[1:52:35] I may have miss corded it that's quite a
[1:52:47] statement a lot of people don't know
[1:52:50] that but we're gonna be judged by this
[1:52:52] Bible that's why I want to preach verse
[1:52:54] by verse I don't leave out any verses
[1:52:58] praise it hard I want to preach every
[1:53:01] single one that I can
[1:53:02] okay so Paul says neither received it I
[1:53:05] am man neither was I taught it but by
[1:53:07] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:53:09] so Paul said my letters didn't come from
[1:53:11] my thoughts Jesus Christ met me in a
[1:53:14] vision and he told me what to write and
[1:53:16] I'm writing it unto you and then he told
[1:53:18] the Romans he said God will judge the
[1:53:21] secret of your hearts by the gospel
[1:53:23] which I preached because it was Jesus
[1:53:27] Christ gospel so sister that's why
[1:53:31] that's why if the Bible says it we
[1:53:36] believe it and everything we believe is
[1:53:38] from the Bible there's nothing I preach
[1:53:42] by the grace of God that's not in this
[1:53:44] Bible that's always been our stance
[1:53:50] go to Ephesians 4:5 let me put it up
[1:53:53] here Ephesians 4:5 just just I just want
[1:53:57] to lay this in here and of course sister
[1:54:01] Tonya at anytime if you have any
[1:54:02] questions feel free to text me you know
[1:54:05] we can talk about it for church heathens
[1:54:08] four five one Lord
[1:54:13] one faith one baptism there is only one
[1:54:15] faith there's only one and it's not the
[1:54:19] Catholic faith it's not the Lutheran
[1:54:21] it's not the Methodist it's not even the
[1:54:23] Branham faith
[1:54:24] it's the Jesus faith right cuz William
[1:54:28] Bram's not God he was just a prophet of
[1:54:30] God there's only one faith that's the
[1:54:32] faith of Christ Paul said the life I
[1:54:34] live I live by the faith of Jesus Christ
[1:54:37] amen amen
[1:54:39] in other words sister there's only one
[1:54:41] way to believe the Bible and that's
[1:54:43] Jesus's interpretation of it not a
[1:54:46] denomination interpretation it's not my
[1:54:48] interpretation of it it's God's own
[1:54:50] interpretation of his words so that's
[1:54:54] the next thing I'm gonna lay down there
[1:54:55] we're all gonna be judged by the word
[1:54:57] there's only one way to understand
[1:54:59] there's not two ways there's only one
[1:55:00] way the next thing is about God God is
[1:55:04] only one person Hebrews 1 verse 3 let's
[1:55:07] read em God is not three persons and
[1:55:09] there is not one scripture in the Bible
[1:55:12] that says God is three persons that was
[1:55:16] actually coined the term Trinity was
[1:55:17] coined two hundred years after the last
[1:55:20] apostle died the word Trinity is not in
[1:55:23] the Bible nor is the definition God
[1:55:26] never said here o Israel I'm one of
[1:55:28] three persons God never said that would
[1:55:31] be silly if he did right the Bible says
[1:55:34] in the Old Testament that God says in
[1:55:35] Isaiah he said I am the only god there's
[1:55:38] none beside me the Bible says there's
[1:55:41] one Savior there Bible says there's no
[1:55:43] Savior beside me Hebrews 1:3 now I'm
[1:55:49] gonna skip down here I'm sorry no here
[1:55:51] this Jesus who Jesus being the
[1:55:53] brightness of his glory and the Express
[1:55:55] image of his person so Jesus is the
[1:55:59] image of the invisible God that we will
[1:56:02] never see God's invisible sphere unless
[1:56:04] it becomes like a vision to us so
[1:56:08] because God's invisible he had to make
[1:56:10] himself a mask he had to hide behind a
[1:56:14] mask he had to make himself an image and
[1:56:17] that image that he built for himself so
[1:56:18] he could be seen was his son Jesus
[1:56:20] Christ
[1:56:23] now that
[1:56:25] that that son is not a different person
[1:56:27] than him that son is the same person it
[1:56:29] just has different attributes for
[1:56:32] example the body's flesh but the Spirit
[1:56:35] is spirit but that doesn't make him a
[1:56:38] section for a separate person it's a
[1:56:41] different manifestation and again listen
[1:56:45] if everybody can listen three persons is
[1:56:48] not in the Bible how to turn Tarun email
[1:56:50] me last week and I did it real nice as I
[1:56:52] always do but I said please show me one
[1:56:54] verse it says God three person they said
[1:56:55] polished Holy Ghost I said that doesn't
[1:56:57] say three persons that verse says
[1:56:59] there's one name of the Father Son and
[1:57:02] Holy Ghost ten days later Peter used
[1:57:05] that name he baptized them in the name
[1:57:07] of the Lord Jesus Christ Jesus staying
[1:57:10] right there said Peter don't baptize
[1:57:12] them in the name of the Father Son Holy
[1:57:13] Ghost he said praise the Lord I will he
[1:57:15] went down there he started praying ten
[1:57:17] days later he got the Holy Ghost and he
[1:57:18] said let me baptize somebody I'm gonna
[1:57:20] baptize you in the name of the Father
[1:57:22] Son Holy Ghost I'm gonna baptize you in
[1:57:24] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ hey
[1:57:25] man boring there's not one scripture in
[1:57:30] the Bible where anyone who's ever
[1:57:31] baptized with or sprinkled like the some
[1:57:34] Catholics do or Lutheran's or Methodists
[1:57:36] whoever does it there's no sprinkling
[1:57:37] the Bible there's nothing there's none
[1:57:40] in the Bible that's a perversion that's
[1:57:42] not that's not right now I'm not
[1:57:45] condemning them but I'm saying it's
[1:57:46] wrong teaching there's nothing in the
[1:57:49] Bible about that so there's one name to
[1:57:51] the father's and Holy Ghost that's the
[1:57:53] name of the Lord Jesus Christ so the the
[1:57:58] term Trinity and three persons was two
[1:58:01] hundred years after John died Saint John
[1:58:04] so what what the churches have done
[1:58:07] sister Tonya these denominational
[1:58:09] churches that believe in Trinity they
[1:58:10] have attacked they have actually exalted
[1:58:12] the the false doctrine above the Bible
[1:58:16] writers and now they've got themselves
[1:58:19] into idolatry because you cannot have
[1:58:22] three separate persons you cannot have a
[1:58:24] separate person without having a
[1:58:25] different personality
[1:58:27] Jose's got a little bit different
[1:58:29] personality than me Aaron's got a lot
[1:58:32] different personality than me I'm just
[1:58:34] joking but
[1:58:36] mine's the bad window here's a good one
[1:58:39] you cannot have different personality
[1:58:43] without being a different person
[1:58:46] unless English has lost its meaning
[1:58:48] completely remember the Bible said this
[1:58:51] go to Lydia proverbs 30 verse five and
[1:58:53] six let's go here this is these are the
[1:58:55] simple scriptures I've I've been
[1:58:56] emailing these Trinitarians which I pray
[1:58:58] for them I love them you know I was a
[1:59:01] Trinitarian until I knew better
[1:59:05] so you'll never you never hear say
[1:59:07] Blessed Trinity er cuz that's not in the
[1:59:09] Bible there's no such thing as a Trinity
[1:59:11] of gods that's not in the Bible so look
[1:59:15] at this every word of God is pure he's a
[1:59:16] Shield of them that put their trust him
[1:59:17] next verse the Bible says do not add to
[1:59:21] his words if you add and column three
[1:59:24] persons God's gonna reprove you he's
[1:59:25] gonna correct you and you're gonna be
[1:59:27] called a liar the Bible writers never
[1:59:30] said God is three persons so
[1:59:32] Trinitarians they just willingly add to
[1:59:34] the Bible it's kinda like this like it's
[1:59:37] kind of like they do like this well
[1:59:37] God's Word is not enough so I've got to
[1:59:39] add my Trinity doctrine in here look
[1:59:41] what they've done they just add it to
[1:59:42] the Word of God well God's gonna call
[1:59:45] them liars if they don't reap if they
[1:59:47] don't repent of that but that's what the
[1:59:49] Bible says I know that's harsh but
[1:59:52] that's true did you know there's lots of
[1:59:58] false false religions that have
[2:00:00] Trinities
[2:00:01] Hinduism has a trinity of the Braman
[2:00:04] there's Brahma Vishnu and Shiva and
[2:00:07] they're all three different persons but
[2:00:08] they're ultimately Braman that's a
[2:00:11] that's a pagan idea three persons as one
[2:00:13] god that's a pagan idea that's never in
[2:00:15] the scripture the Egyptian Trinity is
[2:00:19] called it's Amon but it's raw and Fatah
[2:00:23] all in one how many knew that the
[2:00:28] Babylonian Trinity has a Trinity as well
[2:00:31] it's got ninki later became Ishtar and
[2:00:34] then Enki and then Marduk all three
[2:00:39] persons one God that's pagan because
[2:00:43] there's not one
[2:00:44] God said I'm three persons there's you
[2:00:46] cannot add to God's Word nor take away
[2:00:48] from God's Word and there's more there's
[2:00:50] more there's more net all right go to
[2:00:54] Jude verse four Jude verse four let's go
[2:00:57] out let's move on that's that's
[2:00:58] basically the gist of that we could go
[2:01:00] on more and more but you'll never hear
[2:01:03] Holy Trinity here you'll never hear
[2:01:04] Blessed Trinity or anything like that
[2:01:06] because God never said I'm a Trinity of
[2:01:08] persons God said I am THE LORD thy God
[2:01:11] and I changed not he does not change
[2:01:16] he never was three persons now we know
[2:01:20] he has three manifestations just like me
[2:01:22] I'm a father I'm a husband I'm a pastor
[2:01:24] I'm a teacher I got a lot of role but I
[2:01:26] fill I got a lot of roles so do you oh
[2:01:29] grandma you know grandma mother sister
[2:01:32] I'm a brother I have all these men at
[2:01:34] all these roles but I'm still one person
[2:01:36] same thing with God God was a father he
[2:01:38] created the son to join him and God is
[2:01:40] the Holy Spirit God is the Holy Spirit
[2:01:43] they're not three separate they're one
[2:01:46] that's right and if you add to that then
[2:01:49] the Bible says God's gonna call you a
[2:01:50] liar to add to that so grace now this is
[2:01:57] Grace sister Tonya this is how we teach
[2:01:59] grace because the Bible says certain men
[2:02:02] will creep in the church they're gonna
[2:02:03] creep in reminds me of the Grinch Stole
[2:02:06] Christmas he creeps in there and who
[2:02:13] were before of old ordained to this
[2:02:15] condemnation ungodly men and what did
[2:02:17] these people do they turn the grace of
[2:02:19] God into lasciviousness what is
[2:02:21] lasciviousness lasciviousness is
[2:02:23] lawlessness or in other words a license
[2:02:27] for immorality so sister Tonya true
[2:02:31] grace is God's unmerited favor to us but
[2:02:35] that does not give us the right to
[2:02:37] continue living in sin
[2:02:38] it means it's it it by God's favor
[2:02:42] forgives us all of our sin but then
[2:02:45] expects us to lovingly walk in obedience
[2:02:48] afterwards because we hate sin so much
[2:02:51] we don't want anything to do with it
[2:02:52] because of that great gift of grace
[2:02:55] that's
[2:02:57] but see churches there so you're saved
[2:03:00] you can still be homosexual
[2:03:01] you can still marry as many times as you
[2:03:03] want you can still cuss smoke drink do
[2:03:07] drugs get drunk you can still do all
[2:03:09] these things they make grace a light as
[2:03:13] long as you come to my church and pay
[2:03:14] money I'm okay with that I'll tell you
[2:03:16] no we're not okay with that here if
[2:03:19] you're not going to keep God's Word
[2:03:20] I'm gonna pray God a movie out of the
[2:03:21] church and you know God will do it
[2:03:23] because you've seen it amen I've seen it
[2:03:26] we do not want leaven among us we want
[2:03:30] to be a unleavened body of believers
[2:03:32] amen we want to be a group that has no
[2:03:36] sin among us so then God can heal our
[2:03:38] sick God can save our lost God can
[2:03:41] minister in our lives God can do
[2:03:42] whatever you want to do because there's
[2:03:44] all 11 out of our house amen so see
[2:03:50] that's what we believe out grace grace
[2:03:52] is God's total favor to us as sinners
[2:03:54] but we cannot say well because I'm
[2:03:57] forgiven well I can really drunk now
[2:03:59] I'll really go for indicate now because
[2:04:03] I've got grace I'm going to heaven no
[2:04:06] you haven't actually received grace yet
[2:04:07] you need to go back to Calvary because
[2:04:10] you never went there in the first place
[2:04:16] all right
[2:04:18] let me just do let me set a timer here
[2:04:20] ten more minutes
[2:04:21] okay everybody take a deep breath I
[2:04:24] don't know where yeah the first thing
[2:04:29] you notice about our our church though
[2:04:31] is probably the way we dress okay so
[2:04:33] let's go to first Timothy 2:9 it is an
[2:04:36] absolute Bible command that we dress
[2:04:38] modestly and the Bible defines areas of
[2:04:42] our body that we should show and errors
[2:04:44] we should not show oh that's what my
[2:04:47] books about my books all ready to go I'm
[2:04:48] just waiting on the on the designer
[2:04:50] she's real busy it's all ready to go
[2:04:52] I've got the work cited page done
[2:04:53] I have comb through that book time and
[2:04:55] time again brother brother van I got 42
[2:04:57] thousand words I've read that thing so
[2:04:59] many times I'm tired of reading it I'm
[2:05:01] gonna read it one more time because John
[2:05:02] wants it on audio I'm gonna read my book
[2:05:05] one more time
[2:05:07] first Timothy 2 to 9
[2:05:09] there we go Lydia so sister Tanya this
[2:05:11] is why we asked the women and the men
[2:05:13] you'll see me walking around here
[2:05:15] showing off my body parts either no
[2:05:17] women and men but this specifically
[2:05:19] speaks the woman Paul says in the manner
[2:05:21] also that women adorn themselves in
[2:05:23] modest apparel now modest means not
[2:05:25] drawing attention to yourselves with
[2:05:29] shaped face honest that's being a saint
[2:05:31] you know just shameful realizing
[2:05:32] realizing how little we are thinking God
[2:05:34] is great and thinking that we're a
[2:05:35] little and sobriety's seriousness not
[2:05:39] with broided hair because in those days
[2:05:40] they could pay hundreds of or they can
[2:05:42] pay all kinds of money to get fancy
[2:05:43] hairdos and gold Imperials and cost the
[2:05:46] array so see the Bible commands it and
[2:05:48] remember this is the same man brothers
[2:05:51] sisters that said you're gonna be judged
[2:05:52] by my by my gospel on the day of on the
[2:05:56] day of judgment Jesus Christ will judge
[2:05:58] all the women in America and of course
[2:06:00] all the other nations by this right here
[2:06:02] they're gonna be judged
[2:06:02] did you wear modest clothes or not
[2:06:04] because my Bible commands you to wear it
[2:06:07] now women that's really the main one
[2:06:09] right because most men don't walk around
[2:06:11] near half-naked but women in America
[2:06:14] walk they if they're not saying they
[2:06:15] they show off their breasts they show
[2:06:17] off their thighs their bottoms they show
[2:06:19] off all kinds of parts that they should
[2:06:21] not show off is that right Church and
[2:06:25] the Bible tells us what to cover and I
[2:06:28] just in my book I just did a rule you
[2:06:29] got to cover from your shoulder down to
[2:06:31] your shins
[2:06:32] now that can even me right here right at
[2:06:33] the top of your shin but the Bible says
[2:06:36] in Isaiah 47 if you show your thigh this
[2:06:39] is nakedness see God God gives us the
[2:06:42] dress code and the church said the Bible
[2:06:45] does have a dress code just like schools
[2:06:48] have a dress code
[2:06:49] just like funeral homes will have a
[2:06:51] dress code right even Envy I saw in the
[2:06:55] news even MBA games have a dress code
[2:06:57] one of the women tried to walk into a
[2:06:58] game recently dressed like one of the
[2:07:00] dancers and all kinds of immoral clothes
[2:07:01] and they kicked her out even they got
[2:07:03] dress codes who would have thought about
[2:07:04] that everybody has dress codes so God
[2:07:08] has a dress code hey man that's why you
[2:07:13] won't see me showing off shorts and
[2:07:15] showing off my that's why I don't take
[2:07:16] off my shirt anymore I used to be I
[2:07:18] don't do that anymore
[2:07:18] cuz I don't wanna not that it would but
[2:07:20] you know I don't want to cause anybody
[2:07:22] to stumble I don't want women to lust or
[2:07:24] a man if they're homosexual I want them
[2:07:25] to lust after me I want to be modest
[2:07:27] like the Bible says to be modest
[2:07:29] I go to first Corinthians 11 I got a few
[2:07:33] more minutes
[2:07:35] and again I'm open at any time that's
[2:07:38] why I put on the website put everywhere
[2:07:40] I tell my friends I put on Facebook if
[2:07:42] I've ever done anything wrong I've
[2:07:43] taught anything wrong somebody come
[2:07:45] correct me with the Word of God
[2:07:46] and I've never had anybody correct me
[2:07:47] with the Word of God now that doesn't
[2:07:50] make me anything that just makes the
[2:07:51] Word of God something first Corinthians
[2:07:56] 11 now this is where the Bible says a
[2:07:58] woman should not cut her hair and a man
[2:08:00] should not grow his hair long though
[2:08:02] Jesus did not have dreadlocks like some
[2:08:04] people want to say Jesus had these
[2:08:06] dreadlocks hanging down that's nonsense
[2:08:08] that's nonsense the Bible says ashamed
[2:08:12] in those days they would take it like
[2:08:13] this from what I've read in the Almanac
[2:08:14] the men would take it like this just
[2:08:16] real quick they'd take a knife and just
[2:08:17] cut it and it'll just kind of hang down
[2:08:19] here at the bottom of their neck maybe
[2:08:20] top of their shoulders when it got
[2:08:21] really long but a woman never cut her
[2:08:24] hair in the Bible and this is what I put
[2:08:27] that challenge out there for all these
[2:08:28] years can anyone ever show me one godly
[2:08:30] woman the Bible that cut her hair you'll
[2:08:32] never find it there's not one in the
[2:08:35] entire Bible I've searched I've read
[2:08:37] that thing I've read the Bible that
[2:08:38] beautiful thing how decisions I think
[2:08:39] I've read that glorious I read this book
[2:08:41] four or five times now our families read
[2:08:43] the whole thing Malachi Lee did you ever
[2:08:45] see
[2:08:46] where God told a godly woman to cut her
[2:08:47] hair no because woman when her hair's
[2:08:50] long it represents that she's under all
[2:08:52] the authority of her husband right and
[2:08:56] if she cuts it it's a dishonor she's
[2:08:58] saying I don't have to be under your
[2:08:59] headship I wanted to be on your
[2:09:01] leadership I can I can lead myself but
[2:09:02] God said the woman has to submit to the
[2:09:05] husband okay let's read it
[2:09:08] first Corinthians 11 that's why sister
[2:09:15] Tonya you'll see all the women that we
[2:09:16] have you know as long as God will let
[2:09:18] their hair grow right you know either
[2:09:20] whenever's in your DNA you just let it
[2:09:22] grow as long as you can God's not
[2:09:24] looking for three feet 16 inches 12
[2:09:27] God's just looking for uncut for sisters
[2:09:30] and for men it better be cut no men
[2:09:32] don't walk in here like you're a woman
[2:09:33] I'm gonna pull you aside and say you
[2:09:35] know you need to cut your hair sir
[2:09:37] you're starting to look like a woman you
[2:09:39] starting look like your wife that's true
[2:09:43] that's true I did tell one of the
[2:09:47] brothers I just helped one of the
[2:09:47] brothers about that yeah yeah you have
[2:09:50] to do that because that's what the Bible
[2:09:51] says
[2:09:52] so God and that's why we'll get to this
[2:09:54] one next but that's why women have to
[2:09:56] wear dresses too in our society at least
[2:09:58] in America instantly when when someone
[2:10:01] looks at you they should be able to tell
[2:10:02] a man or a woman by your hair and by
[2:10:05] your outward clothing if not confusion
[2:10:09] sets in and now we've got people
[2:10:11] emailing me from UK oh and the guys
[2:10:16] pleading with me what do I tell my wife
[2:10:17] she thinks that she thinks God's puts
[2:10:20] male spirits and females and puts female
[2:10:23] spirits in men's bodies I say God would
[2:10:26] never do such a thing is that God would
[2:10:30] never do that God is not the author of
[2:10:32] confusion
[2:10:34] that's nonsense use got look at your
[2:10:37] body that will tell you what you are
[2:10:39] that's a pretty good clue right look at
[2:10:43] this first cousins 11 I never even said
[2:10:45] it today look at verse 13
[2:10:50] now if you read all the chapter those
[2:10:51] sister Tanya you'll see that the Bible
[2:10:53] says is a shame for a woman to cut her
[2:10:55] hair and then prophesy speak in tongues
[2:10:58] or even pray look at verse 13 judge in
[2:11:03] yourselves is it calmly or is it fitting
[2:11:05] that a woman pray to God uncovered that
[2:11:07] means with cut hair is it right for a
[2:11:10] woman to pray with cut hair
[2:11:11] next verse doth not even nature itself
[2:11:15] teach you that if a man have long hair
[2:11:17] isn't a shame unto him so what does Paul
[2:11:21] say don't you know it's wrong for a
[2:11:24] woman to cut her hair and try to pray to
[2:11:25] God the Bible says nature itself teaches
[2:11:30] you that it's a shame for men to have
[2:11:32] long hair well how does nature teach you
[2:11:34] that 40 percent of men go bald I looked
[2:11:38] it up I looked it up you can look it up
[2:11:40] I'll send you the link is from BTech
[2:11:42] Britannica so almost 1 out of every 2
[2:11:45] men after a while has no hair huh this
[2:11:48] must be speaking something to me like
[2:11:50] God wants men to have short hair that's
[2:11:53] what the Bible says nature the nature of
[2:11:56] man 1 huh - almost it's for him to lose
[2:11:59] his hair I sure hope mine don't lose
[2:12:01] very soon here ha ha it's a shame a man
[2:12:07] walks are around here with uncut hair
[2:12:10] shame on that man he looks like a woman
[2:12:13] next verse but if a woman have long hair
[2:12:17] now this long means uncut I can prove it
[2:12:19] down later in the verse it is a glory to
[2:12:21] her so see when we see our sisters here
[2:12:24] with is this long uncut hair that's a
[2:12:27] that's a particular kind of glory in
[2:12:28] other words there there being the image
[2:12:31] that God wants them to actually be they
[2:12:33] and it's a glory in the sight of God God
[2:12:36] says ma that's a true female right there
[2:12:38] that female is truly manifesting God's
[2:12:41] Word see for her hair is given her for a
[2:12:45] covering not a cap I appreciate the
[2:12:49] Mennonite women who never cut their hair
[2:12:50] you know and the Amish women that wear
[2:12:53] the caps the Bible don't say a cap is
[2:12:55] your covering the Bible said the hair is
[2:12:57] your covering but a cap won't send you
[2:12:59] to hell we know that you know we know
[2:13:02] that the cap won't send somebody to help
[2:13:04] it's probably like a area of Liberty
[2:13:08] verse 16
[2:13:09] look what the Bible says but see if any
[2:13:11] man seem to be contentious we don't have
[2:13:13] it we have no such this means other we
[2:13:16] have no other custom neither do the
[2:13:17] Churches of God if people are gonna
[2:13:19] argue about this we don't have any other
[2:13:20] custom men need to cut their hair women
[2:13:23] need to let it grow uncut we have
[2:13:25] another customer the NIV says we have no
[2:13:28] other practice and neither do the
[2:13:29] Churches of God that makes it a little
[2:13:30] more clear in more modern terms of
[2:13:33] course that Bible has a lot of works
[2:13:34] missing and there they'll be judged for
[2:13:36] that but they did translate that one
[2:13:38] right of all the ones they missed they
[2:13:40] did practice they didn't do that one
[2:13:41] right Oh
[2:13:46] Deuteronomy 22:5 let's close with that
[2:13:49] one you're let's say to our feet you've
[2:13:50] been you've been a very patient audience
[2:13:51] thank you Wow hour and 15 minutes thank
[2:13:56] you thank you dude army twenty to five
[2:14:05] now now try to answer this the best I
[2:14:10] can
[2:14:10] this is why we asked women to wear
[2:14:13] skirts and men wear pants okay the Bible
[2:14:16] says that the woman shall not wear that
[2:14:17] which pertaineth unto a man neither
[2:14:19] shall a man put on a woman's garment I
[2:14:21] notice it doesn't say robes doesn't say
[2:14:24] pants it doesn't say skirts it just says
[2:14:26] whatever garments are men's garments
[2:14:29] women should not wear them whatever
[2:14:31] garments are women's men should not wear
[2:14:33] them so in the days that this is Moses
[2:14:36] of course for all that do so are an
[2:14:38] abomination to LORD thy God
[2:14:40] so in Moses day men had robes of course
[2:14:45] and their robes went a little bit past
[2:14:47] their knees according what I've read
[2:14:48] womens went all the way to the ground so
[2:14:52] women's garments actually rubbed against
[2:14:54] the ground from what I've read and then
[2:14:59] and also had bigger girdles I mean there
[2:15:01] was things about their outfits that were
[2:15:03] told you could tell right away okay this
[2:15:04] is woman or man can tell right away
[2:15:06] there's also different styles okay so
[2:15:09] maybe they're made of different
[2:15:10] materials different colors so in the
[2:15:13] days of Moses you could look right away
[2:15:15] and say okay that's a man that's a woman
[2:15:17] plus you had their out you had their
[2:15:19] arter garments and then also had their
[2:15:20] hair could tell - woman's hair was
[2:15:24] really long
[2:15:24] men's was cut short now remember Jesus
[2:15:29] the Bible said Jesus never sinned one
[2:15:32] time so that means Jesus never wore
[2:15:35] women's clothes never Jesus preached the
[2:15:39] New Testament with men's robes men's
[2:15:42] garments and then this is important
[2:15:44] cross-dressing in his abomination and
[2:15:47] that's why even though this is in the
[2:15:50] Old Testament it still applies in the
[2:15:51] New Testament because homosexuality was
[2:15:54] an abomination
[2:15:56] so his bestiality all those things were
[2:15:59] abominations in the old and they still
[2:16:01] remain abomination than the new okay and
[2:16:06] I've done his history I that's what my
[2:16:09] book I have a whole chapter on the
[2:16:10] history in my book it's chapter 6 and
[2:16:14] Americans honored know cross-dressing
[2:16:16] into the 40s 50s and 60s I'm a teacher
[2:16:19] and I get magazines they sent me a
[2:16:21] magazine my second year teaching they
[2:16:22] said women can never wear pants in
[2:16:24] schools until 1970 and they had matching
[2:16:28] suits their jacket had to match their
[2:16:31] pants and people used to preachers used
[2:16:35] to preach it they used to preach it we
[2:16:39] should have separate garments so our
[2:16:40] country now let's see what see what they
[2:16:41] did they started cross-dressing they
[2:16:45] started letting the hippies grow hair
[2:16:46] like women they start experimenting with
[2:16:49] drugs and sexuality and now what do we
[2:16:51] got now all these years later we got
[2:16:53] people that don't even know if they're
[2:16:54] male they went to all kinds of perverted
[2:16:56] men want to walk in women's restrooms
[2:16:57] what is wrong with these people
[2:16:59] they're filled with demons but the seeds
[2:17:03] of that was planted back here in the 40s
[2:17:05] 50s 60s when they started letting the
[2:17:07] when women cross dress Levi's did not
[2:17:10] open up a division of pants until
[2:17:12] nineteen
[2:17:13] viii praise God
[2:17:16] you could a woman had to have just
[2:17:18] borrow a pair of man's pants before that
[2:17:21] never understand now so that's why we
[2:17:24] believe some of these things and
[2:17:25] everything we believe of course it's
[2:17:28] right in here
[2:17:29] God's Word because I know sister Tonya
[2:17:31] on that day I've got an answer for what
[2:17:34] this Bible says the secrets of my heart
[2:17:36] will be judged by Jesus Christ according
[2:17:39] to Paul's gospel and so I want a life I
[2:17:43] want to don't you Church don't you want
[2:17:45] to live a life that pleases God don't
[2:17:49] you want to obey every word of God in
[2:17:51] the Bible now we can get to makeup
[2:17:53] makeup is three times in the Bible
[2:17:55] makeups condemned you know bless my
[2:17:56] mother's heart the children not we're
[2:17:58] talking remember we were talking to my
[2:17:59] mom about makeup and she said I said mom
[2:18:02] I said can I show you the three
[2:18:05] scriptures and remember that I said it
[2:18:06] real nice I said mom can I show you the
[2:18:08] three scriptures in the Bible that talk
[2:18:09] about women not wearing makeup and she
[2:18:11] said all we're not going to talk about
[2:18:12] that I said come on mom you go to church
[2:18:16] and you don't want to read the Bible
[2:18:18] Church what are we gonna be judged by
[2:18:20] right here right here
[2:18:22] American women never wore makeup to the
[2:18:24] 1920s during the Roaring Twenties
[2:18:26] when they started cutting their hair
[2:18:28] with bobbed hair started smoking
[2:18:30] cigarettes started drinking carousing
[2:18:33] all kinds of evil things now not all the
[2:18:35] women thank God for the I'm not bashing
[2:18:38] women I'm just saying
[2:18:39] God Satan anointed some of those women
[2:18:41] to break the word of God and all these
[2:18:44] years later we forget
[2:18:45] oh but sooner they're gonna remember the
[2:18:50] Word of God and they're not just gonna
[2:18:51] remember it they're gonna keep it

[2:19:06] help sister Tonya alright praise the
[2:19:09] Lord how many love the Lord today Amen
[2:19:12] let's have our musicians come here so
[2:19:17] thankful
[2:19:17] the wisdom of God icing that we we fear
[2:19:21] though we feel the way of the Lord or we
[2:19:23] somebody we choose the fear of the Lord
[2:19:26] Amen that's right I choose the fear I
[2:19:28] choose the way I choose all of Jesus
[2:19:30] safety all of Jesus now hope everything
[2:19:35] was understood this this I think I think
[2:19:37] the only thing that might have been
[2:19:38] misunderstood was Ecclesiastes 7 but
[2:19:41] personal Church I don't see more women
[2:19:43] that are sinners than men I see both I
[2:19:45] see equal I could be wrong on that but I
[2:19:49] don't want men in our church to take
[2:19:50] this as like we're better than women
[2:19:51] you're not on the plain of God we're all
[2:19:55] level I thank God for our sisters in
[2:19:59] this church that'll shout in the spirit
[2:20:01] or speak in tongues raise their hands
[2:20:03] that glorify God I thank God for systems
[2:20:05] like that who did Jesus show the
[2:20:07] resurrection first man or woman woman a
[2:20:10] woman that had seven demons cast out by
[2:20:14] Jesus amen a woman who been washed by
[2:20:17] Jesus amen that's we showed the
[2:20:20] resurrection to first so brothers I just
[2:20:23] don't want I just don't want our
[2:20:24] brothers being exhausted I want to be I
[2:20:26] don't ever think I'm better or God loves
[2:20:28] me more than a woman that's not right he
[2:20:30] doesn't God loves all his children the
[2:20:33] same just like me I don't think Malachi
[2:20:34] more than my girls although I got a lot
[2:20:36] more girls I don't get Malachi special
[2:20:40] treatment I love all night chill PC I
[2:20:44] know who sent them to me the Lord Jesus
[2:20:48] Christ they're all his really I just got
[2:20:52] him brother amen for a few years but I
[2:20:54] got these arrows for a few years and
[2:20:57] I've got a modem and I've got to teach
[2:20:58] him to read this Bible Andre so that
[2:21:01] when they're older they can take down
[2:21:03] Satan's influence
[2:21:05] they can destroy Satan's Kingdom somehow
[2:21:08] because the Bible said Jesus was
[2:21:10] manifest to destroy the works of the
[2:21:12] death
