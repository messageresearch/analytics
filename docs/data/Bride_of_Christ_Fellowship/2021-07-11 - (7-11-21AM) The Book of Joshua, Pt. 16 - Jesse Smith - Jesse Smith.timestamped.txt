[0:41] had taken ai
[0:42] and utterly destroyed it as he had done
[0:44] to jericho and her king
[0:46] so he had done to ai in her king and how
[0:49] the inhabitants of gibeon had made peace
[0:51] with israel
[0:52] and were among them that they feared
[0:55] greatly because gibbon was a great city
[0:58] as one of the royal cities and because
[0:59] it was greater than ai
[1:01] and all the men thereof were mighty
[1:03] wherefore
[1:04] adonai zedek king of jerusalem sent
[1:07] unto ho ham king of hebron and unto

[1:17] aglan saying come up unto me and help me

[1:33] of egon gathered themselves together

[5:15] kind of what this chapter is about i
[5:17] have some slides here
[5:22] and we'll uh preach here by the grace of
[5:24] the lord
[5:27] thank you for your prayers we had to
[5:29] travel on friday and uh yesterday to see
[5:31] our family my mom
[5:32] you know she's 70 and she wanted to do
[5:34] another meal with the family so i
[5:36] haven't seen her license
[5:38] uh since the new year
[5:42] i think she had a major surgery
[5:45] she had female trouble at major surgery
[5:46] but she seemed to be doing really well
[5:48] and
[5:49] i said there's about 30 or 40 of our
[5:51] family members there
[5:52] i heard cam witnessing cam was
[5:54] witnessing the family members and
[5:56] i didn't really get a chance to witness
[5:57] to too many people but we didn't get a
[5:59] chance to pray for my cousin he was an
[6:00] awful car accident back in december
[6:02] he's still walking in the lymph he's
[6:04] younger than me he's like 35 or
[6:07] something like that
[6:08] we were able to pray for him i was able
[6:10] to point the scripture i showed in the
[6:11] scripture confess your faults one to
[6:12] another
[6:14] and the bible says call me out of the
[6:15] church and you'll be healed
[6:17] and so i told put your confidence in
[6:19] that word i know he's been backslidden i
[6:20] wrote him a letter
[6:21] after the accident and he apologized
[6:23] never got back to me but i said no
[6:25] problem man you're going through
[6:26] surgeries and
[6:27] get stitches all over his face and
[6:28] everything but we're shining
[6:31] the light of jesus and praying for them
[6:33] and
[6:34] so thank you for your prayers it was
[6:36] just a nice trip and great to see the
[6:38] family
[6:39] by the grace of the lord
[6:43] so in joshua chapter 10 we'll look at
[6:45] this thought you know look at the day
[6:46] the sun stand stood still
[6:49] and we'll try to preach this chapter
[6:51] today by the grace of god
[6:53] i'll try to watch my time here because i
[6:55] know um do you have work tonight
[6:57] stephen do you have work oh you were
[7:00] gonna stay okay we'll praise the lord
[7:01] all right
[7:02] hallelujah thank the lord
[7:07] so um we'll try to just look at this
[7:10] thought here and then tonight we'll look
[7:11] at a different thought
[7:14] so we'll look at the day the sun stands
[7:16] still uh this was a
[7:18] quite a day some people call this the
[7:20] very pinnacle of joshua's ministry
[7:23] uh and it's because he spoke to the sun
[7:26] and the moon
[7:27] and they uh literally stood still
[7:30] literally stood still now brother
[7:32] branham has a different take everybody's
[7:33] got a kind of different take on this
[7:35] on how the sun stood still but the point
[7:38] is that that day
[7:39] god hearkened to the prayer of a man
[7:42] right
[7:42] and and god was just approving joshua
[7:45] god was
[7:45] basically blessing joshua and
[7:47] vindicating joshua as a faithful leader
[7:50] praise god and how many want to see god
[7:52] bless and vindicate your life praise god
[7:54] that's
[7:54] i think that's every every warrior every
[7:57] christian warrior's desire
[7:58] is to see god eventually reward all your
[8:01] years of service right
[8:03] and somehow just you know show you your
[8:04] destiny for your life and just give you
[8:06] just a great testimony that you can
[8:08] you can realize wow that was god's will
[8:11] god wanted to do something great in my
[8:13] life and i can see what god did in my
[8:15] life
[8:16] you know i was i shared this example a
[8:17] few weeks ago but the queen of sheba
[8:20] her great the great testimony jesus is
[8:22] going to use on the day of judgment
[8:24] is that she crossed a a
[8:27] a thiefful desert right a desert full of
[8:31] thieves and robbers
[8:32] she risked her life and her whole uh her
[8:36] whole reputation
[8:37] she risked everything to cross that hot
[8:40] desert she risked her health
[8:42] her life her money she risked everything
[8:45] just to hear thus saith the lord
[8:48] and jesus said that's what she's going
[8:50] to be used for on the day of judgment
[8:52] that was her one great uh act of life
[8:55] where
[8:57] where everything was building up to that
[8:59] and after that moment
[9:00] she was never the same praise god right
[9:02] because then she got in the presence of
[9:04] the holy ghost praise god
[9:05] and she said i have no more questions
[9:07] the holy ghost has answered all my
[9:09] requests praise god
[9:10] and she could return to her people a
[9:13] changed woman
[9:14] praise god and jesus said that's what
[9:16] you'll be used against
[9:17] i will use a women a woman one woman
[9:20] against
[9:20] thousands of jewish priests that turned
[9:23] down a greater than solomon
[9:25] that wouldn't cross uh the land of
[9:27] palestine
[9:28] that wouldn't cross a city remember
[9:30] jesus on the night he was arrested
[9:33] he told the you know after after all the
[9:35] all the armed guards fell down they
[9:37] stood back up and he says
[9:38] why do you come out against me with all
[9:40] these spears wasn't i daily in the
[9:42] temple teaching the people
[9:44] god was so humble all those look how
[9:46] close god was god was sitting in the
[9:48] porch of solomon right there
[9:50] by herod's temple and all the pharisees
[9:52] had to do was walk a few yards
[9:55] to hear someone greater than solomon but
[9:57] they wouldn't do it
[9:59] so god is going to raise up a woman who
[10:01] crossed an entire desert
[10:02] risk her life spent months on the road
[10:05] traveling extra distances god will raise
[10:07] up that woman
[10:08] to condemn those unbelievers you should
[10:10] we should thank god that we're believers
[10:12] today praise god
[10:13] and in our trials we should be able to
[10:15] say lord thank you for allowing this
[10:17] it's going to give me a testimony on the
[10:19] day of judgment praise god
[10:21] i am tested for a testimony for god
[10:25] i very well preached that was brother
[10:27] diggs right got him coming september
[10:29] and i was texting him about that this
[10:31] week i just sent him a text i was going
[10:33] over my book and i
[10:34] came to the part where i i quote brother
[10:36] this in the book and i say a picture
[10:38] friend of mine brother diggs says it
[10:39] well
[10:40] he says we are tested for a testimony i
[10:43] said brother diggs i just want to tell
[10:44] you you're on page 294 in my book or
[10:46] whatever
[10:46] and it's a brother that means so much to
[10:48] me he said because right now he's being
[10:50] tested
[10:51] so just pray for brother dick his wife
[10:52] has left the message and divorced him i
[10:55] don't know if you knew that
[10:57] that happened a few years ago but i just
[10:58] want to tell you and he said i have
[11:00] lived
[11:01] off that statement all these years that
[11:03] his wife has been gone
[11:05] he is going through a test but it's for
[11:07] a testimony
[11:09] now look at look how god may use brother
[11:11] dick this may be the greatest trial of
[11:12] his life
[11:13] he was already healed of brain cancer
[11:14] church
[11:16] and we would have thought no we would
[11:17] think that was what god will use him for
[11:19] now god may do that but god may also use
[11:22] it when someone so close to you forsakes
[11:24] christ
[11:25] but you have to cling you still have to
[11:27] stay true you still have to worship with
[11:28] no one else in worship
[11:30] god may use him for that see church we
[11:32] don't know the story of our song many
[11:33] times
[11:34] till later like that psalm says we may
[11:36] we may not understand it better until by
[11:38] and by praise god
[11:40] but one thing's for sure he's going to
[11:42] answer all of our questions over there
[11:44] he will dissolve all of our doubts over
[11:45] there praise god but here let us show
[11:47] our love and our faithfulness and our
[11:49] devotion
[11:50] let us do what we feel led by the holy
[11:52] spirit for god will use it god is
[11:54] pleased
[11:55] when we're tested that we overcome
[11:58] it's the story of your life no one has a
[12:00] story just like nobody has a fingerprint
[12:02] like you
[12:03] right no one has a dna just exactly like
[12:05] you
[12:06] everybody has a special blueprint on
[12:08] this life and you're going to make a
[12:09] special mark that
[12:11] nobody else can make that mark right in
[12:13] your family nobody else can make that
[12:14] testimony
[12:15] and maybe in your church nobody else can
[12:17] have that testimony like you can have
[12:19] so see the thing to do is trust jesus
[12:21] christ trust him
[12:22] with all your heart lean not upon upon
[12:25] your own understanding
[12:26] but in all your ways acknowledge him and
[12:28] he will make your past straight
[12:31] glory and so
[12:35] i just want to encourage you that you
[12:38] know
[12:40] joshua had one of the greatest victories
[12:41] ever of his life on this day
[12:43] such a marvelous day and can i say it
[12:45] like this it was a day that had the most
[12:46] sunlight he ever experienced
[12:48] or any man ever born on that ever lived
[12:51] in that entire time
[12:53] that was the day with the most sunlight
[12:55] there ever was
[12:56] there'd never been a day that long i
[12:58] know in alaska or whatever they have
[12:59] days that are long sunlight but they
[13:01] never according to the bible
[13:02] they never had a day with this much
[13:05] sunlight as joshua had praise god
[13:08] amen it was a special day it was
[13:11] a highlight day praise god it was one of
[13:13] those uh
[13:14] days where god god did something that
[13:17] was totally unexpected praise god
[13:19] because there was a need for the army of
[13:21] god there's a need for the people of god
[13:23] how many god needs today praise god
[13:25] and god can meet your need today and if
[13:27] not just hang on
[13:28] he never promised the exact time to do
[13:30] it but he said i will do it i'll be
[13:32] faithful
[13:32] i will finish what i started amen
[13:35] hallelujah now
[13:36] uh in joshua chapter six we were ten we
[13:39] keep saying six
[13:40] chapter 10 we we read our texts here now
[13:43] let's read and i already read one
[13:45] through six i'm not going to read it but
[13:46] i'll just review it
[13:47] here the jared jerusalem's king at
[13:50] adonai zadek feared israel greatly
[13:54] notice he's he's afraid
[13:56] he's heard about jericho he's heard
[13:57] about gibby or i'm sorry ai
[14:00] and now he's heard about the gibeonites
[14:02] surrendering to israel
[14:04] now in church these were mighty men
[14:07] right gibeonites were mighty men in the
[14:08] bible says
[14:09] so he rallies four other kings to try to
[14:11] destroy the gibeonites it's interesting
[14:13] he doesn't go against israel he's trying
[14:16] to
[14:16] go against the servants of israel he's
[14:18] too afraid to fight god's army
[14:20] so he goes against the servants of god's
[14:22] army
[14:24] right that's how satan is satan can't
[14:26] attack god
[14:27] so he goes against his servants would
[14:30] you just remain faithful
[14:31] god will fight for you praise god just
[14:33] like this show this shows god will fight
[14:35] for you praise god
[14:37] amen now see they were previously a
[14:41] great royal city look at verse
[14:43] 2. gibbon was a great city one of the
[14:46] royal cities there's a few cities in the
[14:48] promised land
[14:49] that were greater than others and gibeon
[14:51] was one of those cities
[14:54] and they were not full of cowardly men
[14:56] they were full of mighty men
[14:59] right gibeon was full of mighty men but
[15:01] these mighty men had enough respect for
[15:04] god
[15:06] that they realized we cannot defeat
[15:08] jehovah
[15:10] these other gods we've defeated but this
[15:12] one can't be defeated
[15:13] you don't want to fight that guy you
[15:15] don't want to fight that god in battle
[15:16] amen
[15:17] he's a man of war praise god he'll do
[15:20] all kinds of things right we heard about
[15:22] egypt
[15:23] uh he'll turn water to blood
[15:26] he'll send swarms of locusts praise god
[15:29] he'll smite
[15:30] you it'll smite you with all kinds of
[15:32] plagues boils
[15:34] he'll kill all your cattle this god is
[15:36] he's just untouchable we don't don't
[15:38] mess with that god they had enough
[15:40] wisdom to know
[15:41] you do not mess with god's elect praise
[15:44] god
[15:45] don't mess with this god but as we saw
[15:48] last week god was so rich in mercy
[15:50] praise god
[15:52] and god save the gimme nights
[15:56] and i do want to make a correction last
[15:57] week i said something a little wrong so
[15:59] forgive me you know i tend to do that
[16:01] i'm human you know so forgive me
[16:02] and if i make a mistake you can always
[16:04] try to correct me by god's grace but
[16:06] i i made the mention how uh the ark
[16:08] stayed at gibeon
[16:10] until the days of uh solomon but that
[16:12] wasn't right the act
[16:13] the ark actually moved a few times it
[16:16] moved from gibeon to shiloh so some of
[16:18] you may remember that right
[16:20] i got that out of easton's bible
[16:22] dictionary so
[16:23] that's where my source was so and i'd
[16:25] forgotten about shiloh right i
[16:27] i knew that ark was at shiloh i knew
[16:29] that you know i just
[16:30] i forgot because i'm not perfect i can't
[16:32] remember everything just so you know i
[16:33] just want to make a little correction
[16:35] there
[16:35] the ark wasn't gibeon for a while but
[16:37] then it was also shiloh
[16:39] but it was true that when god met
[16:41] solomon he met
[16:42] solomon at gibeah or gibeon
[16:46] and that was a great place and that's
[16:47] where they brought in the days of
[16:48] solomon that's where they brought the
[16:49] vessels of the house of god and all the
[16:51] instruments they brought them out of
[16:53] gibeon to
[16:54] solomon's temple after it was finished
[16:57] uh i believe it was 13 years to
[16:58] finish if i'm not mistaken or was it
[17:00] seven i can't remember which one of us
[17:02] might have been seven
[17:03] uh yeah about probably seven so uh here
[17:06] we see that
[17:07] uh the gibeonites were uh uh a people
[17:11] that fear the lord and we saw last week
[17:13] even god was willing to forgive people
[17:16] even if they they were kind to god's
[17:19] people
[17:20] right god forgave the giving knights
[17:24] 440 some years of sin
[17:28] and god had already pronounced judgment
[17:29] on them but because they came and
[17:31] and they they humbled themselves before
[17:33] god god forgave them
[17:36] that sounds an awful lot like matthew 25
[17:40] right and they even got forgiven through
[17:43] deception
[17:45] but because they didn't look here
[17:48] because they didn't fight against god
[17:52] because they didn't fight against god
[17:53] god forgave them over 440 years
[17:57] of wicked abomination that's why god was
[17:59] wiping out that's why he's going to wipe
[18:00] out all these kings
[18:01] today we'll see it he wipes out all
[18:03] these kings because they're abominations
[18:05] their wickedness that they've done
[18:07] but because the gibberish just asked for
[18:08] mercy and they feared god and they
[18:11] didn't want to die
[18:12] god spares them and makes them wood
[18:14] choppers and water hewers
[18:16] for the house of god
[18:20] so that's interesting and i may preach
[18:23] on that later as i've
[18:24] at church it's just been i've always
[18:26] speculated in my mind about matthew 25
[18:28] there
[18:28] is jesus going to grant people salvation
[18:31] just by being kind to his brethren
[18:33] without repentance or not i don't know
[18:36] in the past i thought maybe he'd do it
[18:38] without repentance
[18:40] then i thought well he's had to use
[18:41] repentance so it's just one of those
[18:42] mysteries
[18:44] but here but the reason i thought that
[18:46] is because look the gimme nights
[18:47] they're given life just because they
[18:50] didn't fight against god's people
[18:54] they're giving the entire leash on life
[18:56] because they don't fight against god's
[18:58] people let's be careful with our words
[19:00] let's not fight against god's people
[19:02] amen let's be like david
[19:04] we'll touch not god's anointing even if
[19:06] people even if god used somebody one
[19:08] time and they fail to use them again uh
[19:10] uh we won't say anything about it we'll
[19:12] just pray for them to repat praise god
[19:14] now of course we'll rebuke false
[19:16] prophets and all that kind of stuff like
[19:17] that we're not talking about that we're
[19:18] talking about people that
[19:19] backslide like saul was so he was always
[19:22] a real warrior for god for a number of
[19:23] years
[19:24] but then he backs them with a murderous
[19:26] spirit he never falls prophesied he was
[19:28] you know
[19:29] he was eventually saved the bible said
[19:31] samuel said you'll be with me tomorrow
[19:33] in paradise right
[19:34] he was eventually saved because he
[19:35] repented at the end of his life but we
[19:38] don't want to fight against god's
[19:39] anointed praise god
[19:40] we want to fight for god's anointed amen
[19:44] now uh verse i'm sorry i want to give
[19:46] you the the
[19:47] the picture so so israel crossed the red
[19:50] sea of the mighty miracle they camp at
[19:52] gilgal
[19:53] and joshua says we need circumcision
[19:55] this this army needs
[19:57] a permanent separation from the reproach
[20:00] of egypt
[20:02] right and then after that then they go
[20:03] to jericho they walk around 13 times get
[20:05] the victory
[20:06] and then they say oh we'll just take ai
[20:08] with 3 000 men right and then they they
[20:09] don't
[20:10] consult their lord and so then they they
[20:12] got to go back to gilgal
[20:14] they got to repent and so they got they
[20:15] got to clean out aiken sin
[20:17] then they go back at a great victory
[20:20] right then the gibby knights come and
[20:21] deceive them
[20:22] i'm sorry they're coming to see them
[20:23] that gilgal okay well now we're at the
[20:26] spot where jerusalem's king adenizadek
[20:29] hears about the giving knights
[20:30] surrendering and so he gathers these
[20:32] four
[20:33] other armies these five so five total
[20:36] kings
[20:37] come against the people of god in church
[20:39] don't ever forget
[20:41] with god you and god are a majority
[20:45] this was a tiny army compared to these
[20:48] five
[20:49] nations of mighty men these were these
[20:52] were warriors
[20:53] these were heathen these were scary
[20:54] people these were demon-possessed people
[20:57] but as long as they had the ark of god
[20:59] as long as they had all the sin out of
[21:01] their lives
[21:02] god was going to fight for them and no
[21:04] man would they will be able to stand
[21:06] before them
[21:07] all the days of their life praise god
[21:09] church i don't care what the
[21:10] what the what the odds are i don't care
[21:12] if it's five armies against one
[21:15] with mary magdalene it was seven devils
[21:17] against jesus
[21:18] and jesus cast out all those seven
[21:20] devils amen
[21:21] with legion it was 12 000 against one
[21:24] and jesus said go and the 12 000 had to
[21:28] go
[21:28] whenever god's presence is with you
[21:30] you're more than a conqueror amen
[21:33] numbers never scare god they scare us
[21:36] and we need to look beyond the numbers
[21:38] right
[21:38] and we know see with eyes of faith that
[21:40] god is for me
[21:42] he's not against me god is with me he's
[21:44] going to help me
[21:45] he's going to deliver me as long as
[21:47] jesus is on my side
[21:49] god will work it out amen
[21:52] so don't really matter and look daniel
[21:54] it was one man
[21:56] and daniel was praying against all those
[21:58] demons in heaven
[21:59] and one great demon called the prince of
[22:01] persia
[22:02] but because daniel kept praying daniel
[22:04] kept praying kept believing
[22:06] god used daniel's prayer to send over
[22:08] michael and michael come up and fight
[22:11] against and wrestle with the prince of
[22:12] persia
[22:13] and overcame this this chief devil
[22:16] praise god
[22:17] so if there's chief devil church let's
[22:19] just keep praying
[22:20] keep believing our god breaks every
[22:22] chain our god is the mighty conqueror
[22:25] he does great things we must stay in the
[22:27] channel of prayer because remember
[22:29] you are his beloved
[22:32] just like daniel was his beloved praise
[22:34] god
[22:35] roman says the people that were not his
[22:37] beloved
[22:38] have caught become his beloved amen
[22:41] he'll fight for you church
[22:44] hallelujah
[22:47] so see whether it's 12 000 5 7
[22:51] whatever it is as long as jesus is with
[22:53] you you got the victory praise god
[22:55] you're going to get the victory
[22:56] hallelujah now verses six to eight
[23:00] and the men of gibeon verse six set unto
[23:02] joshua to the camp of guild wars
[23:04] gilgal saying slack not thy hand from
[23:06] thy servants come up to us quickly and
[23:08] save us and help us for all the kings
[23:10] the amorites that dwell in the mountains
[23:11] are gathered together
[23:12] against us now notice it's god's
[23:15] servants
[23:16] saying uh army of god can you come
[23:18] rescue us
[23:19] come help us lord will you help us fear
[23:22] surrounding we are overwhelmed
[23:24] can you say hell but just imagine god
[23:27] saying oh i can't wait to send him
[23:29] i've been waiting 440 years to do this
[23:32] right
[23:32] he was waiting 440 years to clean
[23:36] the land amen to purge the land the
[23:38] bible said the land
[23:39] was crying out to god there's so much
[23:42] wickedness done here the land was crying
[23:44] out
[23:44] the blood of all the innocent people was
[23:47] calling out saying god
[23:48] cleanse the land and god's saying it's
[23:50] time i'm going to deliver my people
[23:52] i'll help anybody that wants help amen
[23:57] hallelujah whether you're a gibbonite or
[23:59] an israeli
[24:00] whether you're a gentile or jew whether
[24:02] you're just just repenting
[24:04] yesterday or you've been a servant in
[24:05] the army lord all the days of your life
[24:08] amen
[24:09] or most the days your life right so much
[24:11] to raise the house of god we thank god
[24:12] for that
[24:15] verse seven so joshua ascended from
[24:16] gilgal he and all the people war
[24:19] with them and all the mighty men of
[24:20] valor and the lord said unto joshua fear
[24:23] them not
[24:24] for i've delivered them into thine hand
[24:25] there shall not a man of them stand
[24:27] before thee
[24:27] now notice according to the bible the
[24:29] bible places it
[24:31] as joshua hears about their cry for help
[24:33] so joshua starts going
[24:35] and then the bible says on his day he's
[24:38] the
[24:38] lord so see some you know many times you
[24:42] know
[24:42] uh we understand that if if we see
[24:45] there's somebody we can help
[24:47] we just need to go move to help them and
[24:49] then maybe on the way god will give us
[24:51] some fresh inspiration or something
[24:53] but see god and joshua to move he
[24:56] wouldn't see
[24:57] joshua take the word and act on it and
[24:59] go help my brothers
[25:01] because he knew if god spared the giving
[25:03] nights and now they're getting attacked
[25:05] well god would want to spare them
[25:06] god would want to save them god wouldn't
[25:08] save you to
[25:09] have you killed right god would save you
[25:11] to protect you
[25:13] and joshua found something good he could
[25:14] do for the people of god
[25:16] so church when we find something we can
[25:18] do for the people of god
[25:19] let's do it amen because that's what
[25:21] joshua did
[25:22] and this is the day where the greatest
[25:25] miracle happened in his life when he was
[25:27] what helping
[25:27] others he wasn't even protecting israel
[25:31] church
[25:32] he wasn't even protecting his own wife
[25:33] and kids and his own family it was
[25:35] protecting
[25:36] the servants of god because of this just
[25:38] the foolish verses just like abraham
[25:40] allah
[25:41] i didn't hear you praise god abraham
[25:43] defeated four
[25:44] kings amen when he went out to rescue
[25:47] lot
[25:48] church god is in the rescuing business
[25:50] amen
[25:51] god is in the business of saving people
[25:53] against all odds god's ones god wants
[25:56] to save god wants to deliver god wants
[25:58] to show his strong hand
[25:59] in our lives amen
[26:03] oh that's beautiful
[26:07] first night i don't know i'm sure
[26:10] wait i'm not sure if i finished verse
[26:11] eight he said fear not for i've
[26:13] delivered them into thy hand there shall
[26:14] not a man of them stand before thee
[26:16] not one of those men will stand before
[26:19] you verse nine
[26:20] joshua therefore came unto them suddenly
[26:22] and went up from gilgal
[26:24] all night okay so i just kind of skipped
[26:25] in extra verse so give me night setting
[26:28] for help right
[26:30] joshua ascends and the lord assures him
[26:32] you're going to get the victory
[26:34] church eternal life is living for others
[26:38] joshua says i'm going to live for my
[26:40] wood choppers
[26:42] i'm going to live for my water packers
[26:46] in other words for us we're going to
[26:47] live for the people who clean the
[26:49] toilets
[26:49] right we're going gonna live for the
[26:51] people that serve us food
[26:53] all right that we're gonna live for we'd
[26:55] say the lowest of the low right or the
[26:56] the most humble the meekest of the meek
[26:59] the low we should live with eternal life
[27:02] live for
[27:02] other people who don't have it off as
[27:05] good as we do
[27:10] that's beautiful church that's beautiful
[27:12] notice god's response
[27:13] he's going to help his servants joshua's
[27:16] army was the true church right
[27:18] gibby knights they were just servants
[27:23] you see can i say like this you'll find
[27:25] the greatest blessings when you're
[27:26] serving
[27:27] people that are less than you now i say
[27:30] poor than you
[27:31] or i'll say like this don't know as much
[27:33] about god as you
[27:35] you'll find the greatest blessings in
[27:37] condescending yourself
[27:41] right the bible says condescend yourself
[27:43] to men of lower estate
[27:46] you see when we serve other people and
[27:48] help other people
[27:50] that's actually god working through us
[27:52] to show eternal life and to bring a
[27:54] great victory in people's lives
[27:56] amen this is beautiful
[28:00] what a testament no wonder god honored
[28:01] his word look he's fighting for other
[28:03] people that can't defend themselves
[28:05] he's fighting for the oppressed amen
[28:07] he's fighting for the outnumbered amen
[28:10] he's fighting for some new believers
[28:12] praise god he's fighting for them
[28:14] and no wonder god hears his prayer
[28:16] praise god
[28:18] now verse 9 and 10. i already read nine
[28:21] they went up suddenly
[28:22] by night look at night it was a night
[28:24] attack i'm sorry they traveled by night
[28:27] verse 10 and the lord discomforted them
[28:29] before israel and slew them with the
[28:30] great slaughter of gibeon
[28:32] and chased them along the way that
[28:33] goethe up to beth horan
[28:35] and smote them at asaka and untop makida
[28:39] now notice church look at this they come
[28:42] suddenly they trap
[28:43] after traveling i i didn't mean training
[28:45] i met traveling all night
[28:47] and the lord discomforts the enemy now
[28:48] look they walked 15 miles
[28:51] in one night
[28:54] see we complain if we got to drive 15
[28:56] miles on a detour out of the way
[28:58] but they these were such warriors under
[29:00] the anointing of god
[29:02] they traveled by night 15 miles
[29:08] and they use a surprise attack to get
[29:10] the advantage don't you like how god
[29:12] does it
[29:12] every battle's different right with
[29:14] jericho they just sit out there here we
[29:16] are we're gonna walk around
[29:17] we're gonna torment you to the end right
[29:20] with ai they did the ambush remember
[29:22] that they sent some people in
[29:24] brought out all the people and then the
[29:25] ambush came in the other way well here
[29:27] it's just a surprise attack right at
[29:29] night early in the morning
[29:31] surprise attack oh it's war time god
[29:34] knows how to do it every time church
[29:36] let's ask god to show us wisdom how to
[29:37] do it praise god how can i get the
[29:39] victory lord show me
[29:40] how to get the victory guide me help me
[29:42] to use your word give me your wisdom
[29:44] praise god because i know all your ways
[29:46] are in wisdom
[29:48] wisdom hath building the house praise
[29:50] god has seven pillars amen
[29:54] now look their obedience gives them the
[29:56] power
[29:57] it's in church this is what we're always
[29:59] going to see the obedience to the word
[30:01] of god
[30:01] always brings the victory that's the
[30:04] only way to assure you
[30:07] that you're going to get the victory
[30:09] obedience is not legalism
[30:11] obedience is love jesus said if you love
[30:15] me keep my commands
[30:17] right legalism is adding to the word
[30:20] like oh you got to be circumcised
[30:22] or you got to have long sleeves on all
[30:24] the time or this i mean just nonsense
[30:26] oh you can't wear a beard if you're a
[30:28] man i mean come on
[30:29] show me that in the word they they can't
[30:32] they can't
[30:32] uh can't back up any of these false
[30:34] doctrines and these legalistic ideas in
[30:36] the word of god
[30:37] but see obedience is always going to get
[30:40] the blessing now church
[30:41] remember god had given him the power to
[30:44] slay their enemies as he had promised at
[30:46] mount
[30:47] ebal now we preached on that about three
[30:49] or four weeks ago
[30:50] remember after ai they got the victory
[30:52] after the ambush and remember moses had
[30:54] them stand between two mountains
[30:56] remember that
[30:56] two mountains he had the ark in here and
[30:58] then he read deuteronomy 27 and 28
[31:01] he read all the blessings and all the
[31:02] people would shout amen after
[31:04] each blessing and then he read all the
[31:06] curses and all the people on this side
[31:08] would shout
[31:08] amen after all the curses so these
[31:11] promises are freshly on their mind what
[31:13] a picture church
[31:14] that we see the word that we hear every
[31:16] week should be freshly on our mind
[31:18] so when we go out to the battle we'll be
[31:20] able to quote it and remember
[31:22] and overcome by the word of god see they
[31:25] just heard
[31:26] all these promises you'll defeat your
[31:29] enemies if you keep the word
[31:30] just love god with all your heart you
[31:32] will defeat all the enemies
[31:34] and so they're able to use that in
[31:36] battle shortly thereafter
[31:38] see god gives us a word in due season
[31:40] hallelujah
[31:41] amen so be careful church be careful
[31:44] what you're hearing
[31:45] and make sure you apply it to your lives
[31:48] like over the years we've had so many
[31:49] people backside and fall away
[31:51] but the word that was coming was telling
[31:53] them to be more devoted to the word
[31:56] right be devoted to your home church
[31:58] pray fast read your bible
[32:00] spend time with god right be faithful
[32:03] respect the fivefold ministry and
[32:05] you know all these simple things give
[32:07] give alms right help out the poor
[32:10] and yet people will turn those down they
[32:12] turn down
[32:13] pre-sermons about fasting they've turned
[32:15] down sermons about
[32:16] uh seeking god or getting the baptism of
[32:19] the holy ghost how many sermons have we
[32:20] preached on the baptism holy ghost
[32:22] and yet it just it goes one in ear out
[32:24] the other they don't apply the bible
[32:26] says you must mix the word
[32:28] with faith amen god is not a mixer with
[32:31] sin and unbelief
[32:32] but god is a mixer with the word and
[32:34] faith
[32:36] oh hallelujah thank god amen
[32:41] see so we feel bad when people don't
[32:43] take the word of god but it's not as if
[32:44] they haven't been told
[32:46] they have been told right you've heard
[32:49] the word
[32:50] so you're acting on it you're overcoming
[32:52] with it what makes you different from
[32:54] them
[32:54] you've loved god you heard the word
[32:57] and you mix it with faith so when you
[33:00] went out of church
[33:01] you didn't forget what you heard you
[33:02] kept quoting that word believing that
[33:04] word
[33:05] and you conquered in jesus name and
[33:08] ultimately we know he conquered for us
[33:09] right
[33:10] we're not going to get any we're not
[33:12] going to get any credit we don't want
[33:13] any credit
[33:15] but this is what it's all about the
[33:17] obedience remember the scripture church
[33:20] this was the scripture should come to
[33:22] pass if thou shalt hearken dealt you
[33:24] into the voice of the lord thy god to
[33:25] observe and do all his commandments
[33:27] which i command you this day that the
[33:29] lord thy god will set thee on high above
[33:31] all the nations of the earth now look
[33:33] they just said went over this a few
[33:34] maybe days or weeks ago at mount evol
[33:37] and god said blessed shall thou be when
[33:40] thou come us in and blessed art thou and
[33:41] now go us out now look
[33:43] josh was going out to help the giving
[33:45] night so god's gonna bless him
[33:48] see when you're going out to help
[33:50] somebody god's gonna bless you to help
[33:52] somebody see because you're diligently
[33:54] harking
[33:55] you're keeping the words of god and
[33:57] god's gonna use that and he's gonna
[33:58] exalt you in
[33:59] honor above other people like sinners
[34:03] right that's what he said i'm gonna
[34:05] exalt you above all the nations
[34:06] people are gonna know your life is a
[34:08] real christian life
[34:10] yeah you'll have some persecutions you
[34:11] have some people not like you you
[34:13] will have some of that but the majority
[34:15] of people in your life
[34:16] they will see honor for you because
[34:18] you're under the power of god
[34:20] you've got a different spirit than they
[34:22] got you don't got the spirit
[34:23] of american idol you don't got the
[34:25] spirit of netflix you got the holy
[34:27] spirit praise god amen
[34:29] you got the spirit of truth you speak
[34:31] the truth you speak the word
[34:33] you've got a different spirit on you
[34:34] just like joshua and caleb praise god
[34:36] you're a different breed amen hallelujah
[34:40] because you're obeying the word of god
[34:44] see joshua people remember this they
[34:46] were going out
[34:47] they kept all the word of god the lord
[34:50] will cause thine enemies to rise up
[34:52] against you to be smitten
[34:54] before thy face they shall come out
[34:56] against thee one way
[34:57] and flee before these seven ways that's
[34:59] exactly what happened
[35:01] this isn't the story they scattered all
[35:03] over they defeat these five armies
[35:05] they scatter they kill most of them
[35:06] there's a few that get away and they go
[35:08] off into these different
[35:08] fence cities and everything like that
[35:10] but joshua said we'll get them later
[35:13] we got most of them today praise god
[35:14] we'll get the rest later
[35:16] he had many more battles coming up
[35:19] the church let's take courage this
[35:21] morning by the grace of god that if
[35:23] let's just make sure we are diligently
[35:25] hearkening onto the word of god amen
[35:29] remember you don't chase the blessings
[35:31] the blessings chase you
[35:35] you chase the heart of god amen you
[35:37] chase the word of god you spend more
[35:39] time in this word
[35:40] and then don't worry about the blessings
[35:42] god's blessings will find you on the way
[35:44] to your battle praise god
[35:46] just like they did joshua he said the
[35:49] lord said not a man will stand before
[35:52] you in this entire battle yep five
[35:53] armies
[35:54] that's thus saith the lord joshua okay i
[35:57] believe it how many believe god saith
[35:58] the lord
[35:59] see we've got to make sure it's not
[36:00] saith the lord praise god
[36:02] now next one
[36:05] verse 11 joshua 10 11. i didn't put a
[36:09] bookmark in here let me turn to the
[36:10] bookmark
[36:12] and it came to pass as they fled from
[36:14] before israel that they were
[36:16] going down to bethlehem that the lord
[36:18] cast great stones from heaven
[36:20] upon them unto asaka and they died
[36:24] there were more which died with hail
[36:26] stones than they whom the children of
[36:28] israel slew with the story
[36:30] first look at this you have all these
[36:33] armies running away
[36:34] and god is like throwing darts kind of
[36:37] knocking these people off can you
[36:40] picture that
[36:41] israel's chased them so you ever seen a
[36:43] chase before
[36:45] and these guys are getting hit with the
[36:46] hailstones but israel's not
[36:50] i mean god god's word is going to come
[36:52] to pass
[36:53] if he said i'm going to drive him out
[36:55] he's going to drive him out
[36:57] if he said he'll protect you in church
[36:59] he'll protect you praise god
[37:01] amen so god was throwing the hailstones
[37:04] that one
[37:04] that one that was and god was doing that
[37:07] god
[37:08] was aiming at them god knows how to
[37:10] defeat our enemies amen
[37:12] he knows just like he knows where you
[37:13] are he knows right where they are
[37:15] and god is perfect with his targets amen
[37:18] i didn't hear you praise god you imagine
[37:21] you're chasing after them all of a
[37:22] sudden this huge hailstone
[37:24] comes out and just destroys this crowd
[37:26] of people there you are saying with your
[37:27] sword well
[37:28] praise god let's go get some others you
[37:30] know that's just what it was like they
[37:32] were just falling from the skies
[37:34] one after another god was trying to show
[37:36] them something praise god
[37:38] god was trying to show them that yeah
[37:40] you killed a few with your sword
[37:42] but i'm gonna kill the majority of them
[37:44] with the hailstones in other words
[37:46] i'm the one fighting for you you're
[37:48] winning this because i'm fighting for
[37:50] you praise god
[37:52] i'll let you have a little taste of the
[37:53] battle but it's really not you doing it
[37:56] it's god doing it god is driving out
[37:58] your enemies god is for you
[38:00] god is with you god is the conqueror
[38:04] see he was showing his strong hand to
[38:05] save them he wanted them to see without
[38:08] question
[38:10] god was the reason they got the victory
[38:13] god didn't want him going home you know
[38:15] wiping their swords all the blood and
[38:16] said
[38:17] look how strong look how strong these
[38:18] arms are i killed 50 with this one i
[38:21] killed 50 with that i mean god didn't
[38:22] want him to do that
[38:24] obviously you can't really taste the
[38:25] victory but the main victory come from
[38:28] me
[38:29] because you honored me i bless your
[38:32] going out and i bless your coming in
[38:34] because you've diligently hearkened
[38:36] under the voice of god
[38:40] right some of you we went through our
[38:42] testimonies last summer right
[38:43] in every testimony you gave was it ever
[38:45] you that did it
[38:46] it was no it was never us that did it we
[38:48] just waited on the lord
[38:50] right we were just there when he did it
[38:53] praise god
[38:54] and if there was any time it looked like
[38:56] we might have did it it was just because
[38:57] god
[38:58] had possessed our mind he and spoken his
[39:00] words
[39:01] and moved our hands and done something
[39:03] like that it was always god
[39:05] god is all and god is in all
[39:08] amen
[39:13] it's not by our efforts we're not saved
[39:16] by grace church
[39:17] i'm sorry we're not saved by work sorry
[39:19] we are saved by grace
[39:20] we're not saved by works now we talk a
[39:23] lot about works but
[39:24] that's because once you're saved you
[39:26] should have so much gratitude that you
[39:27] want to do something for god
[39:29] and jesus is going to hold you
[39:30] accountable he's going to say mj i gave
[39:32] you five talents
[39:32] i gave you two towns i gave you one town
[39:34] and mj wants to say lord i was faithful
[39:36] with it
[39:37] right so see there's something about
[39:40] yeah we need to get up about it and do
[39:41] some work
[39:42] let's be up and at it if god has given
[39:44] me these talents i want to invest it but
[39:46] i'm not saved because i'm investing in
[39:48] that
[39:48] i'm going to be blessed because i'm
[39:50] investing in that praise god
[39:52] i'm saved by grace i'm saved by the
[39:54] cross i'm saved because a holy man
[39:57] took my place a sinner's place a holy
[40:00] man became a sinner
[40:01] that a sinner might become holy praise
[40:03] god that's why i'm saved
[40:05] not by my works but by his works of
[40:08] righteousness
[40:11] i just read titus i finished titus this
[40:13] morning titus talks about over and over
[40:15] how you need to have good works
[40:16] he said show yourself a pattern of good
[40:19] works
[40:20] you know what a pattern is a pattern of
[40:22] repeats look at johnny's tie my tie
[40:24] look at the patterns on on the clothes a
[40:26] pattern repeats
[40:27] so we need to have a pattern of good
[40:29] works in other words on monday we're
[40:30] doing good
[40:31] tuesday we're doing it don't skip
[40:32] wednesday wednesday do good go to church
[40:34] all right or listen live stream thursday
[40:37] new good friday
[40:38] every day show a pattern of good works
[40:40] that's what a thankful gra
[40:42] a grateful christian will do they'll
[40:44] constantly show god thanks and praise
[40:46] as a pattern of their love and
[40:48] appreciation for him praise god
[40:52] oh my so many people stumble at the
[40:55] faith versus works
[40:57] but anybody with any sense knows we are
[40:59] all saved by grace
[41:01] and then if we have faith the bible says
[41:04] faith works
[41:05] dead faith is not faith at all right but
[41:08] faith that's real
[41:09] works and helps out the poor helps out
[41:11] the cold people it feeds the poor you
[41:13] know things like that
[41:16] it's easily settled if you understand
[41:18] god's amazing grace
[41:22] now just so you know church this is one
[41:23] of the i was listening to uh
[41:27] listening to jehovah's witness in church
[41:29] they're not even guaranteed salvation
[41:33] they have to go to so many numbers of
[41:35] doors
[41:36] like their wording in their creed is if
[41:38] you don't keep constantly increasing in
[41:40] your number of doors you visit
[41:42] they said if you do that then you're
[41:43] assured eternal life if if you fall away
[41:45] you're lost now look at that that's why
[41:47] they go to you go to your doors
[41:48] now during cover they didn't come to our
[41:50] doors but they sent us a letter
[41:52] so they must have got permission from
[41:53] their false prophets oh it's okay this
[41:55] year there's coven
[41:56] you you need to be scared of chronovirus
[41:58] and don't go to people's doors
[42:00] so you can write them letters and i'm
[42:01] going to write i say that letter for a
[42:02] year i'm going to write her back
[42:04] or maybe i'll go visit their church
[42:06] sometime but see their their in their
[42:08] creeds they're not assured salvation
[42:11] because it's based upon works but ours
[42:13] that's what makes real christianity
[42:15] different
[42:15] it's not based upon anything you can do
[42:18] all you've got to do is believe
[42:20] believe in the son of god believe in the
[42:22] blood that was shed
[42:24] except his gift amen just receive his
[42:27] pardon
[42:28] receive his gift and you have eternal
[42:30] life amen
[42:31] your name is on the book of life in
[42:33] heaven
[42:37] that wasn't in my notes but i thought i
[42:39] preached after
[42:43] joshua 10 12.
[42:47] then spake joshua to the lord in the day
[42:49] when the lord delivered up the amorites
[42:51] before the children of israel
[42:52] and he said in the sight of his name
[42:53] look he's all in front of everybody he
[42:55] said son
[42:56] stand still i'm sorry stand thou still
[43:00] upon gibeon and thou moon
[43:03] in the valley of agile so he was out one
[43:06] of those days where the sun was up and
[43:07] the moon was still out too
[43:11] and so he must have been there fighting
[43:12] maybe in front of everybody
[43:14] and all of a sudden he just shouts son
[43:17] stand still
[43:19] moon stay in the valley of agilent
[43:22] well the ram said he didn't ask
[43:24] permission and say lord could you please
[43:26] i'll show you the quotes in just a
[43:27] minute he didn't ask for permission he
[43:29] just spoke what he needed
[43:31] right now verse 13 and the sun stood
[43:35] still
[43:35] and the moon stayed until the people had
[43:37] avenged themselves upon their enemies
[43:39] it's not this written the book of
[43:41] jasher so the son stood in the midst of
[43:43] the heaven
[43:44] and hastened not to go down about a
[43:46] whole day
[43:48] and there was no day like that before or
[43:50] after it that the lord hearkened on the
[43:52] voice of a man
[43:53] for the lord fought for israel
[43:57] now i said look the lord gave joshua
[43:59] this public testimony
[44:00] now notice moses didn't even have this
[44:03] kind of a gift
[44:05] now brother rahm said joshua had a
[44:06] harder commission than moses lebron said
[44:09] that
[44:09] and as i was with moses i'm not sure
[44:12] about that but that's what he said
[44:15] now it might be true because god gives
[44:17] joshua even a greater miracle
[44:21] there was other waters that were parted
[44:23] right like just like joshua
[44:26] there were other times you know the moon
[44:27] would not so the sun would not shine and
[44:30] and plagues and everything there was all
[44:32] kinds of things like that
[44:34] but here god never did this for moses
[44:38] he only did it for joshua and this was a
[44:41] proof
[44:42] that god was fighting for them see god
[44:45] sometimes church
[44:46] he'll give us testimonies so we know
[44:49] he's fighting for us
[44:51] now look at this church there was never
[44:53] a day like that ever again
[44:54] so all joshua's life he could point back
[44:56] to that day and say
[44:57] god heard our prayers that was a
[44:59] tremendous testimony i'll always know
[45:01] god is with me because of what he did
[45:03] right there praise god
[45:05] he never did that i never saw that in
[45:06] moses's ministry i never saw that in
[45:09] anyone else's ministry
[45:10] that was a special gift to us in our
[45:13] generation amen
[45:14] hallelujah praise god now remember
[45:18] brother branham types this uh to blind
[45:20] bartimaeus there was a blind man in the
[45:22] bible
[45:23] and he kept he said jesus he said lord
[45:26] jesus heal us right
[45:27] heal us there was actually a couple of
[45:28] blind men crying out i'm sorry was it uh
[45:32] leprous weren't they lepers yeah i'm
[45:33] sorry blind no it's blind blind monomers
[45:35] i'm sorry
[45:36] i think there's two stories where there
[45:37] you have you have uh blind people crying
[45:39] out to jesus then you have lepers crying
[45:41] out jesus sorry
[45:42] but blind bartimaeus he cries out for
[45:44] healing
[45:45] and the crowd says shut up shh he's busy
[45:49] but he cries out all the more and he
[45:51] said son of man
[45:52] son of david have mercy on me and
[45:55] brother man
[45:56] dramatizes that jesus is walking and
[45:58] when he hears that loud cry
[46:00] the son stands still and he says what do
[46:03] you want
[46:04] and he says my sight and jesus says you
[46:06] have it receive your sight
[46:09] and brother says this is just like
[46:11] joshua
[46:12] that you and i church when we crowd to
[46:14] god
[46:15] god will hear our prayers at times now
[46:18] at times not every time right we don't
[46:19] get everything we want
[46:21] but when we cry out to god god can stand
[46:24] still and it feels as if god is
[46:26] listening personally to you praise
[46:28] god and then god will give you what you
[46:30] have need of amen
[46:32] so brother uses joshua sun stands still
[46:36] to represent the s-o-n jesus christ
[46:39] standing still
[46:40] when we call upon god for help how many
[46:42] need is help at times amen
[46:44] aren't you glad he's just a call away
[46:46] praise god
[46:48] amen so that's one application that we
[46:52] have
[46:52] for the son standing still remember
[46:55] hezekiah
[46:56] wanted more time and got it
[46:59] so we know and actually time went
[47:01] backward in hezekiah's story
[47:04] let's go to that you got your bible
[47:05] second kings 20.
[47:11] second kings 20 kings kings and
[47:14] chronicles
[47:17] see god god had worked in time before
[47:21] he'd adjusted time
[47:30] now in verse one hezekiah is sick and
[47:32] verse two he then he turned his face to
[47:34] the wall and prayed to the lord
[47:35] and he asked for more years and then as
[47:37] soon as isaiah leaves the middle of the
[47:40] court the word lord comes to him in
[47:41] verse 4 and verse 5.
[47:43] he turns again to go back to hezekiah
[47:44] and said thus saith the lord the god of
[47:46] david
[47:47] i've heard that prayer i've seen thy
[47:48] tears behold i will heal thee
[47:51] on the third day thou shalt go up to the
[47:52] house of the lord now
[47:54] hezekiah asked for a sign
[47:57] and look at verse 11 and isaiah the
[47:58] prophet cried in the lord and he brought
[48:00] the shadow 10 degrees backwards by which
[48:03] he had gone down the dial of hayas this
[48:05] was a
[48:06] sundial you ever seen a sundial it's
[48:08] just like a piece of
[48:09] stone or wood and then wherever the
[48:11] sun's at it sets a shadow on it
[48:13] well in the days of hezekiah god did
[48:15] something similar
[48:16] god move the shadow back a few hours
[48:19] right to give him a sigh
[48:21] that god was going to give hezekiah more
[48:23] years to live praise god
[48:25] so in other words god is the one who
[48:26] created time so god controls time amen
[48:30] he don't do it very often like with josh
[48:32] you only did it one time
[48:33] but here with hezekiah he makes the
[48:35] shadow move you ever moved a shadow no
[48:38] i never have god's the only one that
[48:40] could move a shadow because that works
[48:42] with the sun right
[48:43] god is the only one so here god works
[48:45] with nature with hezekiah again
[48:48] showing that he's the same yesterday
[48:50] today and forever and church we must
[48:52] redeem the time praise god
[48:54] but don't forget
[48:58] i will restore all the years
[49:02] of renewing time he can take years and
[49:04] years of pain
[49:07] all the joy victories he can put it in a
[49:09] short amount of time just like samson
[49:11] amen
[49:12] hallelujah samson wasted all those years
[49:15] in those last few moments of his life he
[49:17] got prayer
[49:18] he had a revival prayer brother william
[49:19] praise god he felt that covenant
[49:21] he had a renewing and god did more at
[49:24] the end of his life
[49:25] than all the other years before
[49:28] see god knows how to restore praise god
[49:31] amen
[49:32] god knows how to make time more valuable
[49:34] more precious
[49:35] give you more blessings in less amount
[49:37] of time amen
[49:39] never give up never to be discouraged
[49:41] god is fighting for us
[49:43] amen the very last
[49:46] moments of his life samson gets the
[49:48] greatest victory of his entire life
[49:54] don't worry about time church you just
[49:55] give all your time to jesus
[49:57] you just redeem all the time give it all
[49:59] to jesus he'll bless you
[50:03] oh hallelujah
[50:07] here's some quotes from brother brown
[50:09] about son standing still now watch this
[50:11] he gives some beautiful applications
[50:12] here
[50:13] you know what happened joshua wasn't the
[50:14] type of a man that he talked about
[50:16] earlier to get his eyes off the revival
[50:19] joshua needed time in the revival the
[50:22] sun was going down
[50:23] he known if the enemy ever built up the
[50:25] revival is almost at the end of the
[50:26] close of it like we stand today
[50:30] he knew if he ever waited till the army
[50:32] got fortified against him it'd be hard
[50:33] to win that battle
[50:35] you know what he did you know that god
[50:37] promised that land he needed more time
[50:38] so the sun was about to go down he said
[50:40] sun stand still amen a paradox indeed
[50:43] the sun stood there for a full day and
[50:45] never moved
[50:46] and the moon over agilent never moved
[50:49] also
[50:50] because the bible said here was never a
[50:51] time before since they're like it that
[50:53] god hearken to the voice of a man
[50:55] you say oh if i know we just lived in
[50:57] that day
[50:59] so he talked about people that oh i just
[51:00] wish i could live in joshua's day
[51:02] and brother man quotes the scripture and
[51:04] he says jesus said in mark 11
[51:06] 24 if you say to the mountain be moved
[51:09] and don't doubt in your heart but
[51:10] believe
[51:11] that what you've said will come to pass
[51:13] you can have what you said still grace
[51:15] and the paradox on down into our age
[51:18] sure praise god
[51:20] in other words just like joshua calls
[51:22] something to stand still
[51:23] jesus said you can cause things to move
[51:25] amen
[51:26] hallelujah praise god and the
[51:29] situation will change if we're believing
[51:32] the word if we're led by the holy spirit
[51:34] aren't you glad you're led by the spirit
[51:35] of god
[51:36] amen to speak the word praise god to
[51:39] believe god's promises
[51:41] oh my that moon and sun stood still
[51:44] until joshua fought his way through
[51:46] with israel avenged themselves upon
[51:47] their enemy why it was in the line
[51:50] of duty
[51:53] now if you get out here and say mountain
[51:55] move i want you to show i can do it
[51:56] it won't do it see it all goes back to
[51:58] your motive and objective
[52:01] well i want to show everybody how
[52:02] powerful i am that ain't gonna move it
[52:04] it has to be sincerely in the hour of
[52:06] duty
[52:08] right he was in the midst of a battle
[52:09] he's watching people die he's watching
[52:11] hailstones fall he's watching people get
[52:13] cut with the sword
[52:14] we're right in the thick of the battle
[52:16] he needs more time
[52:18] and god looks at a need of his child
[52:20] said i'd like to meet that need of
[52:21] my servant joshua jehovah's my salvation
[52:25] i'm going to show him the real salvation
[52:26] of the lord
[52:27] amen went to the line of duty when god
[52:30] has commanded you to do something like
[52:31] he said to moses
[52:32] why cry to me speak to the children
[52:35] i thought i said a timer maybe i did
[52:39] he said people ask today is crying all
[52:41] the time lord what next
[52:43] just speak and go forward that's right
[52:45] god has commissioned us to do something
[52:46] let's do it
[52:47] don't stand around and think and say
[52:48] well how can it happen why is it that
[52:51] makes any difference if god said do it
[52:52] do it anyhow
[52:53] he's still the god of miracles so church
[52:57] if you find yourself
[52:58] in a situation where you need god to
[53:00] show up and if you feel led of the holy
[53:02] spirit
[53:03] not for your glory not for your
[53:05] selfishness then we're told to speak the
[53:07] word
[53:09] praise god we have that confidence now
[53:11] the times has happened to me
[53:13] i wasn't even thinking about it i was so
[53:15] under the anointing i wasn't wondering
[53:16] should i speak or not i just spoke it
[53:19] right and that's how many times it'll be
[53:20] like joshua he's in a battle he's some
[53:22] of the anointing
[53:23] he knows when to speak the word right
[53:25] you'll speak the word
[53:26] under the anointing praise god don't do
[53:29] it for yourself we don't do it for
[53:30] selfish gain
[53:31] but we speak it under the anointing and
[53:33] it has to happen
[53:35] now here's where it says brother said
[53:37] it's a paradox amen god stop the entire
[53:39] earth from turning
[53:43] because a man said stand there still
[53:45] till i fight this battle through
[53:46] that's a paradox amen
[53:50] right because we're taught in science
[53:51] that uh everything revolves around the
[53:53] sun right
[53:56] there's still a debate on that i'm not
[53:57] sure i've never claimed to be a
[53:59] scientist i do teach science but it's
[54:00] very simple science
[54:02] life science and matter and everything
[54:05] i don't teach all this uh universe
[54:06] science astro astronomy
[54:09] but according to brother branham and at
[54:10] least in this quote
[54:12] you know the sun is spinning around so
[54:14] according to brother ram
[54:15] when joshua said sun stands still the
[54:17] earth stood still
[54:20] that's another ransom and then all that
[54:22] light would just stay on it it wouldn't
[54:23] go
[54:24] turn and you know go to the end of the
[54:25] day the earth just stopped now we're
[54:28] told the earth goes about 1 000 some
[54:29] miles per hour
[54:31] you imagine god just hitting the brakes
[54:33] on that
[54:35] okay joshua keep fighting i'm going to
[54:37] hold my foot on the brake here
[54:39] go ahead and all day the sun kept kept
[54:42] shining they're like are these guys like
[54:43] where do we go
[54:44] where's the sun going to go now what
[54:46] time and the israelites are we got all
[54:48] day
[54:48] we got plenty of light the sun is here
[54:50] to stay
[54:51] until we get to victory god's light will
[54:54] shine
[54:54] until you're defeated amen trust god's
[54:57] light to shine
[54:58] until you get the victory amen
[55:02] in other words call out for god's
[55:03] strength trust in his strength i just
[55:05] gotta make it a few more days right i
[55:07] just got to make it a few more weeks
[55:08] just trust in the strength of god let
[55:10] god's light shine amen
[55:13] hallelujah so god puts the brakes on
[55:17] it stops the earth and it's very uh
[55:20] very orbit that's our god
[55:24] never a day like it never a day before i
[55:27] wonder if everybody got backlash you
[55:29] know when they stopped it like that
[55:30] i wonder if everybody felt a little
[55:32] backlash probably not god's so gracious
[55:34] he probably just slowed it down
[55:36] and just brought it to a stop just like
[55:38] that
[55:39] and then it stayed in its orbit and the
[55:40] sun kept shining the moon stay right
[55:42] where it was
[55:44] wow that means he made because the moon
[55:45] orbits he made the moon stand still too
[55:48] wow that's right he wouldn't because the
[55:49] moon rotates on its own right
[55:51] it's got an orbit of its own so he
[55:53] caused the earth and moon to stop right
[55:55] where they were
[55:56] amen our god is great our god is greater
[55:59] our god is stronger praise god all to
[56:02] help out some heathen gideonites that
[56:04] were now
[56:05] saved that had respect for god he did
[56:08] all that
[56:09] to protect heathens church you know
[56:13] god's going to save heathens praise god
[56:15] anyone that wants to anyone that
[56:16] reverences god god's going to save
[56:18] anybody
[56:18] who wants to be saved we'll leave it up
[56:21] to him how he does it
[56:23] praise god amen now here's another sober
[56:27] one this is beautiful
[56:28] this is a different application what
[56:30] brother ram says about
[56:32] sun standing still so just stay with me
[56:33] here i got a little bit longer to go
[56:38] we'll see if i finish early i just might
[56:40] do everybody communion right now
[56:42] after this service okay if i can finish
[56:44] up early we'll see
[56:47] i don't know if that's possible all
[56:48] things are possible yeah
[56:51] the sun can stand still right all the
[56:52] things about i can breathe charges
[56:54] all things are possible yes brother some
[56:56] of these old earth
[56:57] some days this old earth is going to
[56:59] stand still
[57:01] some of these days time's going to stand
[57:02] still i just talked about time
[57:05] time is going to stand still so there
[57:07] physically in joshua the earth actually
[57:08] stopped but now he talks about
[57:10] time standing still listen to god speak
[57:13] you'll stop sometime oh you say i got my
[57:15] kids are raised now this is most of us
[57:17] that got parents or
[57:18] our parents he's talking about people
[57:20] that won't stop even though they have
[57:21] children they're all busy
[57:22] how many are busy with children
[57:28] i got kids to raise i got this to do i
[57:30] got the wash i got
[57:31] how many sisters got to wash when they
[57:33] get home we wash all the time there's
[57:35] there's no end to our washing
[57:38] i got a plow these things have got to be
[57:39] done how many brothers got to go to work
[57:41] and plow and sweat
[57:43] stand he said stand still a minute
[57:46] see our lives get so busy church what
[57:48] does god want us to do
[57:49] stand still so now it's not the sun it's
[57:52] you
[57:54] you standing still he said let god speak
[57:57] he'll do something for you
[57:58] one of these days he'll speak and the
[58:00] sun will turn no more
[58:02] he will speak and the moon will fail to
[58:04] give us light yes brother
[58:05] someday i'm going to preach my last
[58:06] sermon someday i'll pray my last prayer
[58:10] and i'll put this old bible for it's the
[58:11] last time
[58:12] and every mortal wheel in the body of
[58:14] mine will stand still but at that time
[58:15] i'm going over to zion
[58:17] to live forever with him the wheels of
[58:19] modern life will come to a standstill
[58:22] now look he said you poor decrepit
[58:24] sinner friend tonight won't you stand
[58:25] still for a minute
[58:27] this brings it down to the center stand
[58:29] still center
[58:32] let god speak to you when the services
[58:34] begin when the holy ghost is here now
[58:35] the great holy ghost the resurrected
[58:37] christ who's here in the form of the
[58:38] holy ghost
[58:38] the holy spirit is christ in spiritual
[58:40] form when he's here tonight the same
[58:42] yesterday today and forever
[58:43] and the faith that stopped that old from
[58:45] that old blind beggar there
[58:46] bartimaeus could stop him in in the road
[58:49] is the same faith the woman touches
[58:51] dartmouth went and turned and looked
[58:52] he's the same yesterday today and
[58:54] forever
[58:57] different quote now that's the way the
[59:00] church is today doesn't know what it
[59:01] believes
[59:02] it jumps from pillar to post and every
[59:04] little thing comes along it jumps after
[59:05] it and therefore all the beauty and
[59:06] perfume of the church
[59:07] has been sprayed away that's right be
[59:09] still someday everything's going to
[59:11] stand still time's going to stand still
[59:13] it'll blend into eternity the moon will
[59:15] stand still the sun will stand still men
[59:17] will stand still
[59:18] i'm saying this tonight brother that
[59:20] that'll be a great time the sinner will
[59:22] be there
[59:23] talking about the last judgment the
[59:24] bible said all are going to be gathered
[59:25] like sheep
[59:28] everybody's going to stand still one day
[59:30] so he says stand still today
[59:32] and talk to the lord listen to the holy
[59:34] spirit today
[59:37] oh you that's running from this
[59:38] nightclub and everywhere trying to find
[59:40] peace
[59:40] you'll stand still one day brother elvis
[59:42] presley will be there he will be
[59:44] really shook up too at that time if he
[59:46] don't repent
[59:47] arthur godfrey will be there with his
[59:49] little godfreys blondes brunettes and so
[59:51] forth
[59:51] it'll be a shaken time for him all the
[59:53] hail mary's in the world will never
[59:55] clean your guilty soul
[59:56] it'll take the blood of christ
[59:59] and did you know that church i'm just
[1:00:00] going to go ahead and share this here
[1:00:02] there's a famous show called the chosen
[1:00:05] right and a lot of the workers on there
[1:00:08] are catholics
[1:00:10] and did you know that show is turning a
[1:00:12] lot of people to the catholic faith
[1:00:15] the man who plays jesus on there had an
[1:00:16] interview the other day no it's okay we
[1:00:18] watched we watched all the shows i
[1:00:19] haven't watched them i don't
[1:00:20] i'd rather go study you know say that my
[1:00:22] family watches why i go study because i
[1:00:24] i watched so many movies when i was in
[1:00:26] the world i'm like i can't do it anymore
[1:00:28] i can't i i mean they're good shows
[1:00:32] but see you got to watch your influence
[1:00:33] so some people look at that man jesus
[1:00:35] and they watch a video and he says he he
[1:00:38] uses the hail mary beads all the time
[1:00:40] for prayer
[1:00:41] that man that plays jesus the catholic
[1:00:43] and he said he's getting testimonies
[1:00:45] from people turning to
[1:00:46] catholicism because he's a catholic is
[1:00:48] that right children you watch that they
[1:00:49] watch the video i didn't watch it
[1:00:51] i'm just going to be i'm just saying
[1:00:52] just be very careful
[1:00:54] praise god be very careful who we're
[1:00:57] influencing
[1:00:58] right we still might watch them you know
[1:01:00] we still might watch some of them
[1:01:01] but we just got to be very careful now
[1:01:03] when we watch them it's awesome because
[1:01:05] our children always critic
[1:01:06] criticize all their false teachings on
[1:01:08] there oh there are false things from
[1:01:10] history i like that
[1:01:11] but come and tell me daddy i didn't like
[1:01:13] this that's good
[1:01:14] good job catching that all right it's
[1:01:16] okay to watch brother and watch ten
[1:01:18] commandments there's a lot of things
[1:01:19] that on there that aren't very
[1:01:21] they're not completely accurate right
[1:01:23] there's a woman that there's kind of
[1:01:24] interesting modestly you know
[1:01:27] i don't know if i'm gonna turn his face
[1:01:28] away but i'm just saying every movie
[1:01:30] most likely he's gonna have some evil in
[1:01:32] it so you gotta be very cautious
[1:01:34] how you're being influenced okay
[1:01:38] but look he said all the hair mirrors in
[1:01:39] the world will never cleanse your guilty
[1:01:41] soul
[1:01:41] takes the blood of christ such nonsense
[1:01:44] as hail mary's
[1:01:45] that four or five psychiatrists trying
[1:01:47] to keep him and going it takes the blood
[1:01:49] of jesus christ to clean a man's soul
[1:01:51] and the pollution and the souls
[1:01:55] i might hurt you your little pet idea
[1:01:57] now
[1:01:59] your idol see that is this is a culprit
[1:02:01] them kind of things is what's damning
[1:02:02] our nation
[1:02:03] and the rock and rolls and boogie wiggly
[1:02:05] and all the other kind of stuff and
[1:02:06] nonsense the devil is placing that
[1:02:08] hearts
[1:02:08] through such timing rod as that god be
[1:02:10] merciful let's get
[1:02:12] still once and get before god amen
[1:02:15] see a movie is good like we watch him i
[1:02:18] watch
[1:02:19] other movies but that's not the gospel
[1:02:22] the preaching of the gospel is
[1:02:24] foolishness to them that don't believe
[1:02:26] but to us
[1:02:27] it is the power of god under salvation
[1:02:30] the highest form brother branham says
[1:02:32] of god speaking to his people is
[1:02:34] preaching god through
[1:02:35] man amen plays are nice
[1:02:39] movies are nice that's all nice but it's
[1:02:41] the real word of god
[1:02:43] the true word preaching the power and
[1:02:45] demonstration of the spirit
[1:02:47] that's when the blood of jesus christ
[1:02:48] becomes a reality
[1:02:50] that's when i got the holy ghost when
[1:02:52] brother brooks preached on the blood of
[1:02:53] jesus christ
[1:02:54] that's when it came to me that's when it
[1:02:56] will come to you praise god
[1:02:59] amen i never got the holy ghost watching
[1:03:01] the ten commandments
[1:03:03] i never got the holy ghost watching
[1:03:04] those other nice shows they're nice
[1:03:06] shows
[1:03:06] but it ain't the gospel the gospel is
[1:03:08] the truth amen
[1:03:10] and it's all truth in the gospel praise
[1:03:12] god
[1:03:14] that's why you must limit your screen
[1:03:15] time limit your
[1:03:17] entertainment time i didn't plan to say
[1:03:19] that either that wasn't in my notes i
[1:03:21] had no idea i was gonna say that just i
[1:03:23] just hope it helps somebody
[1:03:24] you gotta be careful gotta be careful
[1:03:26] what you watch careful how you're
[1:03:28] influenced
[1:03:30] see these people fall in love with this
[1:03:31] fake jesus oh he's so nice and
[1:03:33] come on i'm glad he's i'm glad he's a
[1:03:35] catcher but he ain't jesus
[1:03:37] he knows nothing about him that's jesus
[1:03:39] he's a sinner right
[1:03:40] he's a catholic he's trusting in mother
[1:03:42] mary to save him he ain't trusting in
[1:03:43] jesus christ amen
[1:03:46] yeah be very careful who you listen to
[1:03:48] that's why i'm glad i'm on facebook i've
[1:03:49] noticed since i got on facebook
[1:03:50] my life is a whole lot peaceful a whole
[1:03:53] lot more peaceful
[1:03:54] because before i was like i would try to
[1:03:55] you know i want to share things with my
[1:03:56] family but then everybody wants to argue
[1:03:58] about brother branham and argue about
[1:03:59] this and
[1:04:00] i would just be nervous waiting for the
[1:04:01] next one
[1:04:04] did he reply did she reply like i'm
[1:04:07] fighting all the time
[1:04:09] in church you know that is in the time
[1:04:11] when we have the most money the most
[1:04:12] technology people are the most sad
[1:04:15] we have more suicides now than before
[1:04:17] because they get on there and they see
[1:04:18] their
[1:04:19] other people's lives they get jealous
[1:04:20] and they think they're so depressed
[1:04:22] and that it doesn't help many people
[1:04:24] i'll tell you what's going to help
[1:04:25] people
[1:04:25] the gospel of jesus christ the blood of
[1:04:28] jesus christ
[1:04:28] and it will set your affections not on
[1:04:30] things on earth but on the things that
[1:04:32] are in heaven amen
[1:04:40] let's get still and get before god how
[1:04:43] many one do that
[1:04:45] i'm glad i love doing at church i love
[1:04:47] doing at home i love doing wherever i
[1:04:48] can
[1:04:50] verses 15 to 19. now for time's sake i'm
[1:04:52] probably gonna
[1:04:54] i'm not gonna read over the whole text
[1:04:56] josh returned to the camp and heard of
[1:04:58] the five kings hiding in a cave
[1:05:00] that's interesting after that great
[1:05:02] victory they got victory over there
[1:05:04] he goes back to camp and they then a
[1:05:06] messenger comes and says hey those five
[1:05:08] kings went and hid in a cave
[1:05:11] so joshua says oh yeah go get stones to
[1:05:13] cover the mouth of the cave
[1:05:15] while the soldiers finished pursuing
[1:05:17] their enemies
[1:05:18] the lord had delivered the enemies in
[1:05:20] their hands so josh was like don't quit
[1:05:21] now he must have been taking a break or
[1:05:22] something i don't know why he went back
[1:05:23] to the
[1:05:24] he must have been taking a break but
[1:05:25] he's like all you soldiers keep
[1:05:27] uh keep routing them keep chasing them
[1:05:30] keep driving them out
[1:05:31] keep trying to get all the victories you
[1:05:33] can
[1:05:35] so here we see the importance of
[1:05:37] finishing the fight against sin
[1:05:41] joshua tells him don't stop when you got
[1:05:43] him on the run
[1:05:44] kill him right if you got that guy on
[1:05:47] the run
[1:05:48] don't let him run kill him right you got
[1:05:51] that little sin on the run if you're
[1:05:52] starting to get victory over that sin
[1:05:54] don't stop don't let it come back kill
[1:05:56] it praise god
[1:05:59] make a promise like job i made a vow
[1:06:01] with my eyes never to look on a
[1:06:03] make a vow make a pledge let the word of
[1:06:05] god anoint you let the holy spirit
[1:06:07] anoint you
[1:06:08] and kill that influence and never be a
[1:06:10] slave to it again
[1:06:11] get the victory praise god
[1:06:16] i heard a preacher say like this i liked
[1:06:18] it he said god is so interested in
[1:06:20] getting the victory
[1:06:20] he wouldn't let five kings hang out in a
[1:06:23] cave
[1:06:24] god didn't want five little sins outside
[1:06:26] of that five little habits
[1:06:28] just hiding away god didn't want it
[1:06:30] hidden god want all
[1:06:32] sin confessed
[1:06:35] god wants all of our sins all of all the
[1:06:37] potential sins right because
[1:06:39] they were just potentially evil in that
[1:06:41] cave god wants all of our
[1:06:43] potential sins confessed and he wants
[1:06:46] everything hidden to be made brought to
[1:06:47] the light
[1:06:49] that all of our sins are confessed so
[1:06:52] anything church
[1:06:53] hiding in our lives let's confess it by
[1:06:55] the grace of god
[1:06:57] okay in verses 20 21 israel achieved a
[1:07:01] great slaughter
[1:07:02] some enemies remained alive but could
[1:07:03] not speak against any israeli
[1:07:05] so the ones that did get away to the
[1:07:07] cities they wouldn't say anything bad
[1:07:09] against jehovah
[1:07:11] because they'd seen the hailstones they
[1:07:13] seen the sun stand still
[1:07:15] how could you speak against that after
[1:07:17] seeing the mighty americas of god how
[1:07:18] could they deny it
[1:07:19] they couldn't deny it brought fear to
[1:07:21] their heart and that should be our
[1:07:23] prayer god show our family members
[1:07:25] miracles do mighty things to our family
[1:07:27] members so they won't speak against this
[1:07:29] word
[1:07:32] even the sinners wouldn't speak against
[1:07:33] god's word because they've seen the
[1:07:34] power of god
[1:07:38] joshua wanted all men of israel their
[1:07:40] captains to see the demise of these evil
[1:07:42] kings
[1:07:43] joshua finally quotes be strong and of
[1:07:45] good courage
[1:07:46] that he'd heard so many times from moses
[1:07:48] the lord
[1:07:50] and the captains of israel remember that
[1:07:51] i preached on that at the beginning i
[1:07:53] dramatized it while moses was alive
[1:07:55] moses told joshua
[1:07:56] he said be strong and of good courage
[1:07:57] that's right okay
[1:08:00] they cross over into jordan i'm sorry
[1:08:01] before they cross jordan god tells
[1:08:03] joshua
[1:08:04] he says joshua be strong and very
[1:08:05] gracious yes lord
[1:08:07] before they cross over the captains tell
[1:08:09] joshua joshua be strong and very
[1:08:11] courageous
[1:08:12] but it isn't until joshua has his head
[1:08:15] on the neck of these kings
[1:08:17] that finally he's the one speaking the
[1:08:19] word he's the one that says now
[1:08:21] israel all you captains all you men of
[1:08:24] god look what god has done today
[1:08:26] be strong and be of courage satan will
[1:08:29] be brute shortly
[1:08:30] under your feet praise god amen
[1:08:33] the word had become a reality the
[1:08:36] promise had become real god's word
[1:08:38] was manifested before joshua it was a
[1:08:41] reality to him
[1:08:43] he'd heard it all those years we're the
[1:08:45] invincible bride
[1:08:47] we're the bride who's going to get the
[1:08:48] latter rain we're the bride going the
[1:08:49] rapture
[1:08:50] we're the brides we're the bride with
[1:08:52] the oil we're the wise virgin bride one
[1:08:55] of these days church
[1:08:56] it's gonna be a total reality praise god
[1:08:59] amen
[1:09:00] there'll be no denying it just like
[1:09:03] joshua
[1:09:04] the promises became manifestable form
[1:09:13] that's such a beautiful beautiful story
[1:09:15] after all these great moves
[1:09:18] joshua stands there on top of his enemy
[1:09:20] and now he says
[1:09:22] you be strong you'll be courageous
[1:09:25] they just had great victories see church
[1:09:28] we got to take the momentum from one
[1:09:29] victory
[1:09:30] take it to the next day right don't get
[1:09:33] lazy on god don't get tired on god
[1:09:35] take the victory that you had the first
[1:09:36] day take it to the next day keep
[1:09:38] keep speaking the word of god stay
[1:09:41] strong in the lord
[1:09:42] my note says god still granted joshua's
[1:09:44] greatest victories and miracles
[1:09:46] now look despite the hail and the
[1:09:48] speaking of the sun moon
[1:09:49] despite failing do you remember that
[1:09:51] remember his failures
[1:09:53] 36 men died because him and his captains
[1:09:56] didn't
[1:09:57] they didn't ask god about ai
[1:10:00] now moses had killed one man right now
[1:10:03] joshua
[1:10:03] makes a mistake 36 men die
[1:10:07] but did he quit did he give up
[1:10:10] no he just got rid of the sin in the can
[1:10:13] no doubt would have had to say sorry too
[1:10:15] right do that repent
[1:10:18] see this gives us great lessons see
[1:10:20] church many times your greatest miracles
[1:10:22] will come after your hardest battles or
[1:10:24] your biggest
[1:10:25] your biggest faults right
[1:10:30] so we gotta stay faithful to god admit
[1:10:32] when we're wrong
[1:10:33] say we're sorry and then watch how god
[1:10:35] shows his love to you shortly afterwards
[1:10:38] he'll prove his love to you even though
[1:10:40] you made mistakes
[1:10:41] i'm the god of mercy remember last week
[1:10:43] i'm the god who delights in mercy
[1:10:45] i'm the god i'm ready to party just come
[1:10:48] to me just confess your sins
[1:10:49] i'm ready to pardon i'll do something

[1:10:54] something great for you sir i've watched
[1:10:55] all your service
[1:10:56] i reward you in due season church god is
[1:10:58] going to reward you in due season
[1:11:01] don't leave god just because you made a
[1:11:02] few mistakes god knows you're going to
[1:11:04] make mistakes
[1:11:05] if you didn't make mistakes you you'd be
[1:11:07] god you'd be god if you if you've never
[1:11:10] made any mistakes
[1:11:11] god expects you to make mistakes but god
[1:11:13] knows you'll come back
[1:11:14] repent and get refilled with power and
[1:11:16] courage
[1:11:17] get your vision straight again and press
[1:11:19] on for the mark of the high calling
[1:11:24] amen
[1:11:28] like i remember when i told you i made
[1:11:30] different mistakes as a pastor and i'm
[1:11:32] looking at it now some of those mistakes
[1:11:33] i made was in 2009
[1:11:34] the greatest meetings ever saw was in
[1:11:36] 2010 11
[1:11:38] 12 13. the greatest miracles i've ever
[1:11:40] seen was after one of my biggest
[1:11:42] mistakes was sister lady remember i
[1:11:43] shared that
[1:11:44] i advised her to move over to saudi
[1:11:46] arabia without a home church that was
[1:11:47] probably my biggest mistake as a pastor
[1:11:49] i think but look i asked god to forgive
[1:11:52] me i repent
[1:11:53] and the greatest meetings ever had was
[1:11:55] directly after that
[1:11:58] amen see god knows i'm going to make
[1:12:00] mistakes but i'll never make that
[1:12:02] mistake again
[1:12:03] david made that mistake with adultery
[1:12:05] but he never made it again
[1:12:07] let that be our testimony we might have
[1:12:08] made a mistake but we'll never to make
[1:12:10] it
[1:12:10] again by the grace of god
[1:12:13] now look 22-27 we learn god wants all
[1:12:16] hidden sin extinguished from our lives
[1:12:19] just like those five kings he didn't let
[1:12:21] them live
[1:12:22] right hidden sin should not stay hidden
[1:12:24] sin needs to go
[1:12:28] the bible said now look here's where
[1:12:30] we'll get to this now beseech you
[1:12:32] brother mark them which cause divisions
[1:12:33] and offenses contrary to the doctrine
[1:12:35] which you've learned
[1:12:37] and avoid them so brothers that bring
[1:12:39] division sisters that cause the vision
[1:12:41] of the church
[1:12:42] avoid them for they serve not our lord
[1:12:46] jesus christ
[1:12:47] but their own belly watch how their own
[1:12:49] they just want more money more
[1:12:50] uh whatever they just want they want
[1:12:52] they want themselves to be blessed
[1:12:53] instead of blessing other people
[1:12:56] and by good works and fair speeches
[1:12:58] deceive the hearts of the simple
[1:13:00] now look he's talking about evil people
[1:13:02] right battles write them up battles
[1:13:04] against dividers for your obedience has
[1:13:07] come abroad unto all men
[1:13:09] i'm glad therefore on your behalf but
[1:13:12] yet i would have you wise unto that
[1:13:14] which is good
[1:13:15] and simple concerning evil so you've
[1:13:17] been tried to
[1:13:18] be divided you have withstood those
[1:13:20] dividing spirits right
[1:13:22] you stay true to the word of god and you
[1:13:24] obey the word of god church
[1:13:26] and the god of peace shall brew satan
[1:13:29] under your feet shortly
[1:13:30] the grace of our lord jesus christ be
[1:13:32] with you amen
[1:13:34] in other words all those lies of all
[1:13:36] those demons that are trying to divide
[1:13:38] you and deceive you and
[1:13:39] steal your money or whatever or whatever
[1:13:41] you're trying to do steal your church
[1:13:42] you're going to put them under the feet
[1:13:44] spiritually speaking
[1:13:46] very soon amen satan will be bruised
[1:13:49] under your feet very soon amen
[1:13:53] so see our battles are different right
[1:13:54] we're not going off to fight battles
[1:13:56] like
[1:13:58] afghanistan or something like that we're
[1:14:00] that's not that's not our real battles
[1:14:01] our battles are against false doctrine
[1:14:04] our battles are against sickness
[1:14:06] right our battle is against people that
[1:14:07] worship themselves and idolatry
[1:14:09] that's what our battle is against but we
[1:14:11] still have the same power as joshua
[1:14:13] to put the enemy under our feet by
[1:14:15] obedience
[1:14:18] i know i know you're getting tired i can
[1:14:20] feel it so let me try to finish up here
[1:14:23] i'm sweating a little bit but not too
[1:14:24] much here so okay in the word
[1:14:27] i'm sorry the word bruise in greek means
[1:14:29] to break in pieces to shiver
[1:14:31] to tread down put satan under foot as a
[1:14:33] conqueror
[1:14:34] trample on him to break down to crush to
[1:14:37] tear one's body and shatter one's
[1:14:39] strength
[1:14:41] shattered so in the new testament
[1:14:45] the powers that are trying to attack us
[1:14:47] get shattered
[1:14:49] they get dissolved or broken the power
[1:14:52] of the enemy gets broken
[1:14:53] and no you're no longer under the power
[1:14:55] of the enemy you're the power of christ
[1:15:00] shattered broken shred down stomped
[1:15:03] under
[1:15:03] walking over it it's not hindering it's
[1:15:06] not bothering you
[1:15:07] you're walking over it praise god you
[1:15:09] have power over it
[1:15:11] nothing's stopping you praise god
[1:15:14] i thank the lord what did jesus now the
[1:15:18] same word
[1:15:19] put satan under your feet is used right
[1:15:21] here in the uh
[1:15:23] forget what church age this is
[1:15:26] chapter two so it's probably the third
[1:15:27] of four churches he's overcometh and he
[1:15:29] with my words to the end to him when i
[1:15:31] give power over the nation
[1:15:33] he shall rule them with a rod of iron as
[1:15:36] the vessels of a potter shall they
[1:15:38] be broken to shivers
[1:15:41] even as i received of my father look the
[1:15:44] father gave jesus
[1:15:45] go brew satan under your foot and he did
[1:15:49] amen praise god that was his power
[1:15:52] that was his ability to put satan under
[1:15:54] his feet and
[1:15:55] just destroy all that influence and the
[1:15:57] bible says that's what the overcomer
[1:15:59] gets
[1:16:00] in the millennium power to rule over
[1:16:03] nations right
[1:16:04] rule them with a rod of iron that's
[1:16:06] right power over nations
[1:16:08] the overcomer so anything that rises up
[1:16:12] against a believer
[1:16:13] will be instantly taken down by the
[1:16:15] power of jesus christ
[1:16:19] in verses 28 to 43 israel gained
[1:16:22] repeated victories now we're not going
[1:16:23] to read this but
[1:16:24] sure just read it they go from victory
[1:16:26] to victory they kill
[1:16:27] everything over and over and over again
[1:16:30] they destroy everything because the lord
[1:16:33] commanded it
[1:16:34] and they do it all swiftly just a swift
[1:16:36] quick victory
[1:16:38] and afterwards they come back to gilgal
[1:16:40] church
[1:16:42] what's gilgall gilgal is your first left
[1:16:46] gilgal is a place of your circumcision
[1:16:48] that place where you entered the
[1:16:50] covenant
[1:16:51] i love you jesus i'll serve you all the
[1:16:53] days of my life fill me with the holy
[1:16:54] ghost
[1:16:55] boom filled with the holy ghost that's
[1:16:57] skill goal praise god
[1:16:58] the world's cut out christ is sealed in
[1:17:01] praise god
[1:17:03] so after all these victories where they
[1:17:05] go back to gilgal
[1:17:07] back to their first thought back to that
[1:17:09] place of remembrance ah
[1:17:10] this is where we first came in i
[1:17:13] remember when i first came in
[1:17:14] i remember when i first got that great
[1:17:16] victory i remember when the world was
[1:17:18] cut away
[1:17:19] i remember the pain of it but also
[1:17:20] remember the victory of becoming a part
[1:17:22] of god's covenant
[1:17:24] in church what is this for us it's a
[1:17:26] return to the cross
[1:17:29] it's a return to remembering jesus death
[1:17:32] burial
[1:17:33] and resurrection how many can understand
[1:17:36] that everyone understand it okay
[1:17:39] we must never forget what god has done
[1:17:41] for us
[1:17:42] how he separated us from our life of sin
[1:17:47] how he brought us into the covenant he
[1:17:49] brought us across jordan
[1:17:51] he brought me out of egypt the blood of
[1:17:53] the lamb brought me out
[1:17:55] he's given me all these victories after
[1:17:57] victory after victory he's giving me all
[1:17:58] these victories
[1:18:00] every now and then i show this slide let
[1:18:01] me show it again
[1:18:03] one time i just wanted to make a little
[1:18:05] list of uh spirits i never finished it
[1:18:08] let me make it bigger
[1:18:14] i want to make a list someday but think
[1:18:16] about all these victories we get we get
[1:18:18] victory over some
[1:18:19] familiar spirits like false prophecies
[1:18:21] the spirit of divination or jealousy
[1:18:24] we got to get victory over jealousy
[1:18:26] everyone ever been jealous of somebody
[1:18:28] i've battled that preacher's got more
[1:18:30] time and more
[1:18:31] maybe they're more gifted than me or you
[1:18:33] know i battle jealousy everybody battles
[1:18:34] jealousy
[1:18:38] lying spirit we're tempted to lie i'm
[1:18:41] gonna never battle the lying spirit by
[1:18:42] the ram battle that
[1:18:44] ever battle the perverse spirit how
[1:18:46] about the spirit of pride anybody ever
[1:18:48] battled that
[1:18:50] but see joshua went on this role where
[1:18:51] he defeated pride
[1:18:53] he defeated whoredoms in other words
[1:18:54] right spiritually speaking
[1:18:56] he defeated infirmities the deaf and
[1:18:58] dumb the
[1:18:59] spirit of bondage the spirit of fear
[1:19:01] seducing spirits anti-christ spirit
[1:19:03] spirit of air spirit of death
[1:19:04] every every battle they went up against
[1:19:07] they won
[1:19:08] it was a great string of victories it
[1:19:10] was a host of victories
[1:19:12] all because they diligently hearken to
[1:19:14] the voice of god
[1:19:15] and serve god in obedience let's stand
[1:19:18] to our feet praise god
[1:19:22] i think we have time for communion for
[1:19:23] everybody we'll just do it all this
[1:19:25] morning that way
[1:19:27] it's not a big deal
[1:19:32] musicians can come if you like
