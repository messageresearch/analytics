[13:07] it shows pictures from the nineteen
[13:08] 1900s before Israel started coming back

[31:46] temperance patience and to patience
[31:50] godliness praise God for the first
[31:52] Thessalonians 5:14 this is our monthly
[31:55] memory verses verses 14 to 23
[32:11] beautiful beautiful portion of the
[32:12] scripture I was reading yesterday about
[32:14] you know some historical things and and
[32:17] some people believe this was the first
[32:18] letter Paul ever wrote some people
[32:21] believe it was the earliest letter I
[32:23] believe around ad 51 and if that's true
[32:27] that'd be awesome because he writes
[32:28] about the rapture in this letter praise
[32:33] God so verse 14 down to 23 let's begin
[32:36] on three one two three now we exhort you
[32:40] brethren warn them that are unruly

[32:51] none render evil for evil unto any man

[32:58] among yourselves and to all men rejoice
[33:02] evermore pray without ceasing in
[33:05] everything give thanks for this is the
[33:08] will of God in Christ Jesus concerning
[33:10] you quench not the spirit despise not

[33:25] wholly and I break
[33:28] your whole spirit and soul and body be
[33:31] preserved blameless unto the coming of
[33:34] our Lord Jesus Christ let's just have
[33:36] one more word of Prayer if you have a
[33:37] need on your heart just make it on unto
[33:38] God by raising of your hand or in your
[33:41] heart just say a little prayer Heavenly
[33:43] Father we love you or gathered here not
[33:44] to be seen or heard Lord of men but
[33:47] we're here to hear from heaven and to
[33:49] make our requests made known to heaven
[33:52] dear God and we want your spirit to have
[33:54] free course today Lord God let your will
[33:56] be done we don't want to quench the Holy
[33:57] Spirit we want the Holy Spirit to flow
[34:00] so lord help us to Lord God to do that
[34:02] to yield to surrender and father to let
[34:06] thy will be done bless your people
[34:08] especially the fathers and the mothers
[34:10] and the families Lord each one of us
[34:12] Lord and and minister to each and every
[34:14] soul we pray on this special day in
[34:16] Jesus Christ's name sure said amen god
[34:19] bless you didn't see the praise God so
[34:28] I'm just gonna have one little slide up
[34:30] here Acacia so if you can switch over
[34:32] just a moment here just want to give a
[34:40] visual again we're all familiar of
[34:42] course with a statue of a perfect man we
[34:46] only have one appreciation sister Wendy
[34:47] she printed out that this week and we're
[34:50] willing we'll hang it up this week by
[34:51] God's grace the statue of a perfect man
[34:54] praise God we appreciate that let's give
[34:56] her a round Bob thank you sister
[35:00] [Applause]
[35:02] as we preached on recently you know the
[35:04] last few years I like how it's his faith
[35:10] it's his virtue it's Jesus's knowledge
[35:14] it's a portion of his anointing and so
[35:17] we all know that we're all familiar with
[35:19] that but as the revelation continues to
[35:22] unfold we know there has to be a full
[35:27] understanding so as Mother Branham
[35:30] preached the revelation that the Holy
[35:32] Spirit gave him we saw that faith as
[35:34] justification and then you work your way
[35:36] up to sanctification to the baptism of
[35:39] the Holy Ghost when love comes down
[35:42] and then once you're born again now you
[35:43] have the the armor of God but the RAM
[35:47] said Peter had to go up to the day of
[35:48] Pentecost to put on the armor of God and
[35:51] then you start manifesting the fruit of
[35:54] the spear after you you're born again
[35:56] and you daily feast on the Word of God
[35:58] and daily repent and live such a godly
[36:01] life you start manifesting the fruits
[36:02] it's also called your adoption because a
[36:05] son has the seed of the father right the
[36:08] placing in your position so the baptism
[36:11] of the Holy Ghost is so crucial but it's
[36:14] not the end it's just the beginning
[36:15] praise God the beginning of a life of
[36:18] adoption praise God we know the final
[36:21] adoption though takes place when you get
[36:23] a new body because that's what Paul says
[36:25] to it the adoption he said the
[36:27] redemption of your body so once you're
[36:29] born again you start growing into
[36:31] adoption God God trusts you a little
[36:34] more with more of the word amen that's
[36:37] how it should be my God's grace we
[36:39] should be seeing more of God's Spirit
[36:42] flow through our lives and that's
[36:45] exactly what Christianity is all about
[36:47] more and more submission to the Holy
[36:49] Spirit now today by God's grace we want
[36:52] to just briefly review what we looked at
[36:54] on Wednesday the fourth anointing of the
[36:58] Holy Spirit you get is temperance so
[37:01] first God gives you faith where you
[37:03] believe you become a Christian you get
[37:05] saved baptized in water then he gives
[37:07] you virtue which is like what Ruth had
[37:10] strength virtue strength to live it
[37:12] publicly Jesus told him right away said
[37:15] if you believe the biggest war is gonna
[37:17] be against those in your household right
[37:20] I'm gonna be said I'm gonna set father
[37:22] against mother right daughter against
[37:25] son-in-law or daughter
[37:26] mother-in-law father-in-law he said your
[37:29] your enemies will be those of your
[37:31] households you need virtue to love them
[37:34] praise God and stand for Christ and then
[37:37] of course live it on the job as well
[37:38] then he gives you knowledge to
[37:40] understand to turn on the lights about
[37:43] why about why we walk this way gives you
[37:46] the why knowledge is the why the deep
[37:49] understanding it's the key right to
[37:51] understand the Christian walk praise God
[37:54] and then now
[37:55] gives you temperance and temperance is
[37:59] according to the Greek its self-control
[38:02] it's the virtue of one who masters his
[38:05] desires and passions especially his
[38:09] sensual appetites so we all know that we
[38:12] have two appetites
[38:14] we have unholy appetites I should say
[38:17] three we have unholy appetites right we
[38:21] have physical appetites and then we have
[38:24] spiritual appetite so we have at least
[38:27] three appetites and we must feed the
[38:32] good ones praise God and then crucify
[38:36] the lust of the flesh praise God
[38:38] you must crucify that one the sinful
[38:41] desire in our minds and of course in our
[38:44] flesh as well sin is in our members so
[38:48] this is an anointing so see Church you
[38:53] and I you know we need the anointing of
[38:55] the holy spirit and it's the anointing
[38:59] that breaks the yokes
[39:01] I say that plainly says that he says you
[39:04] know when we are addicted to sensual
[39:08] pleasures whether it's as we looked at
[39:11] you know drunkenness or cigarettes or
[39:15] you know sexual addictions eating
[39:19] overeating pride well you know political
[39:24] positioning whatever whatever temptation
[39:27] it is
[39:28] those must be crucified it's a it's a
[39:34] yoke right it's an addiction but when
[39:37] the believer who is addicted when even
[39:41] though his house you know it's full of
[39:43] demons we'd say is - may have demons
[39:45] that have robbed his his victory once he
[39:48] confesses that he says I'm sorry Lord
[39:51] forgive me I want to be free from these
[39:53] addictions once he admits that then the
[39:56] Holy Spirit can come in to his house
[39:58] praise God and command all those
[40:02] squatters to leave he's got rebuked all
[40:05] those spirits caused them to leave the
[40:07] mine praise God
[40:09] and then then take we'd say dwelling
[40:14] praise God and then let the anointing is
[40:16] of God bring these back so let's just
[40:19] use cigarettes because that's one thing
[40:20] I battled for when I first became a
[40:22] Christian you know I was still I was
[40:24] trying to serve God but I had a
[40:26] cigarette addiction and chewing tobacco
[40:27] addiction and so I had tried many times
[40:31] to quit over the course of years I even
[40:33] told my wife before we got married I
[40:34] said I don't know if I'll ever be able
[40:36] to quit chewing tobacco such a it was
[40:38] such a demonic hold in my life but I
[40:40] kept praying kept believing and I just
[40:43] kept confessing I'm I'm wrong I know
[40:45] it's wrong it's evil it's dirty it's
[40:47] gonna cause me mouth cancer someday I
[40:48] know it's awful and then uh well then
[40:51] one Sunday after I threw out a pack of
[40:54] cigarettes or a can of two I can't
[40:56] remember which one it was I went to
[40:58] church and it must have happened at that
[41:00] church service but I I confess and I got
[41:05] such an anointing that this is my
[41:07] testimony you believe it or not two
[41:09] weeks later or two Sundays later my mind
[41:13] just kind of opened up and said wow I
[41:14] haven't smoked or had any chewing
[41:16] tobacco for two weeks and I knew right
[41:18] there I was always going to be free from
[41:20] that moment and so see when I could
[41:24] infect that last time all those demons
[41:26] were exposed and I must have went to
[41:28] church and worship God or something
[41:30] something but some power came in to me
[41:32] praise God a greater power set up being
[41:36] yoked hosts the addiction the demons of
[41:39] addiction
[41:39] I became yoke to Christ amen and his
[41:43] anointing came in and has now given me
[41:45] temperance that has lasted almost twenty
[41:48] years I think it's about 17 or 18 years
[41:52] since I've had any tobacco product and
[41:55] so that's just one simple example that's
[41:57] just one small example of how we have we
[42:00] have sensual physical appetites but they
[42:03] must be confessed they must be daily
[42:06] crucified because I every to this day I
[42:08] still walk in Walmart and Target and my
[42:10] flesh wants to buy it I've never had a
[42:12] day where my flesh didn't want it right
[42:15] but it must be crucified every day
[42:17] praise God in my mind I know I'll never
[42:19] go back
[42:20] praise God but Johnny Satan even gives
[42:22] me dreams
[42:23] multiple times a year Bella Johnny oh
[42:25] and in my dream I'll be chewing tobacco
[42:27] like how did I go back to this I'll be
[42:30] smoking like how in the world did I fall
[42:32] back to this and I'll wake up and my
[42:33] mouth will feel like I've had chew it
[42:36] too in there I don't know it's so often
[42:37] so strange don't know how to describe it
[42:38] but when I wake up I say praise God I
[42:41] did not bow to that demon Amy so see
[42:44] Satan is constantly try to work and he
[42:47] you see what he tried to be trying to
[42:48] get our anointing he's trying to come
[42:50] into his house I'm sorry he's coming
[42:53] he's trying to come into our house and
[42:54] our minds and get us to compromise and
[42:56] think about those things he's trying to
[42:58] take our minds captive but the Bible
[43:01] said we don't let Satan take us captive
[43:03] we cast down anything and exalts itself
[43:06] against the learn of God we don't let
[43:10] the devil's come in right we don't let
[43:11] them come into our house we cast them
[43:13] down out of our minds and that's just
[43:15] one small example with with temperance
[43:18] that I know for sure worked in my life
[43:21] absolutely
[43:23] undoubtedly work in my life let alone
[43:25] many other things that the Lord had to
[43:28] deliver me from so when you get the
[43:31] anointing of temperance you're no longer
[43:33] serving your five senses all the time
[43:36] you start living and serving your sixth
[43:38] sense faith praise God you start that
[43:42] that gets more attention than your five
[43:46] senses okay and on Wednesday we looked
[43:50] at the three channels of every
[43:52] temptation the lust of the flesh the
[43:53] lusts the eyes and the pride of life and
[43:56] we saw the lust of the flesh you'll
[43:58] battle drunkenness in Scripture
[44:01] overeating sexual sins and drugs just
[44:05] drug use because that's called
[44:06] witchcraft in the Bible they use drugs
[44:08] everything they've always used drugs
[44:09] centers have always used ropes down
[44:11] through the years but that's witchcraft
[44:12] a lust of the eyes would be sexual
[44:15] attraction property material possessions
[44:18] and financial prospects the pride of
[44:21] life is reputation is what you'll battle
[44:23] to try to build your own reputation
[44:26] greatness arguing the cycles argued who
[44:29] is greater strife which is
[44:32] electioneering for people's positions
[44:35] that are not your own
[44:37] and then murder would be a of pride as
[44:40] well because Cain killed Abel because he
[44:42] was jealous of him pride of life
[44:45] but and then we close wednesday by
[44:48] showing how Eve and Jesus were tempted
[44:52] in all three by the devil right lust of
[44:56] the eyes and Eve fell to all three but
[44:59] Christ overcame all three by simply
[45:01] obeying and loving righteousness amen
[45:05] the Bible said he loved righteousness
[45:08] and he hated iniquity amen
[45:11] that's it that's all we need to overcome
[45:13] any of Satan's temptations is to hate
[45:16] the sin and love the obedience and that
[45:20] is the full power that that can be the
[45:23] full power of the Holy Spirit manifests
[45:26] in our lives so many times we just want
[45:27] to see like the dead raised which is
[45:29] great but there's also power in
[45:32] overcoming everyday temptations praise
[45:35] God Jesus proved it right there he was
[45:37] he was tempted by Satan he was full of
[45:39] the Holy Ghost and all powered heaven
[45:41] earth was available to him but he proved
[45:44] the best way to overcome is to love
[45:46] obedience to love the Word of God and
[45:49] hate iniquity he proven it can be done
[45:52] any believer the weakest Christian can
[45:55] overcome Satan anytime anyplace anywhere
[45:59] by simply loving a righteousness and
[46:02] hating iniquity praise God in any church
[46:06] you'll go to any special meeting you'll
[46:08] go to any place you'll go that is the
[46:10] theme of every special meeting right
[46:13] just quoting the word put the word in
[46:15] your mouth let the word be the sword let
[46:17] the word be your scepter right that's
[46:20] a--that's a theme of everyone is getting
[46:22] the people of God away from beating the
[46:25] lust of their flesh and living and
[46:27] feeding the sixth sense the word of God
[46:29] and it'll be it's the theme of everyone
[46:33] so see it doesn't matter which which
[46:35] places you go to now let me say this or
[46:38] something wrong with going to special
[46:39] meetings but see if you can live it in
[46:41] your daily life
[46:42] if you're not getting the victory in
[46:44] your daily life then an occasional
[46:46] deliverance isn't gonna have
[46:48] you need the anointing to help you
[46:50] everyday
[46:51] praise God amen so you don't backslide
[46:54] into those things right that is the
[46:57] power of temperance because it gives you
[47:01] an anointing go this morning amen
[47:04] it gives you a power where your
[47:07] spiritual man his desires are greater
[47:11] than the natural man praise God amen
[47:15] it's so true and so I would look at a
[47:20] few things here before we get to what I
[47:23] want to close with now temperance you
[47:29] see is this word about self-control now
[47:33] I want to give a couple of examples it's
[47:38] a very it's not a word used very much in
[47:42] Scripture it's a rarely used word so
[47:45] let's look at the first time it's used
[47:46] in the New Testament acts 24 24 Paul is
[47:51] a prisoner of the Lord everybody thought
[47:55] he was a prisoner of Rome he was but
[47:57] really he's a prisoner of Christ right
[48:00] because he knew Jesus when you have to
[48:03] suffer many things for Christ's sake and
[48:05] part of that was imprisonment and so
[48:09] here he comes before Felix and his wife
[48:12] Drusilla and she was a Jew she knew what
[48:17] the word said and that awesome Paul
[48:20] wants to witness right he said remember
[48:21] in Philippians he got the witness to
[48:23] everybody in the whole jail even and
[48:26] everyone in the palace knew he was a
[48:27] message believer glory and here as he's
[48:32] here before Felix is great ruler and
[48:35] Drusilla
[48:36] they send for Paul and they want to hear
[48:40] about his his belief in the Messiah see
[48:44] that's why she won here she's a Jew she
[48:46] knew they're looking for a messiah well
[48:48] let's hear this Holy Roller let's see
[48:49] what he's got to say about the Messiah
[48:51] now let me before I get to this
[48:53] scripture go to I'm sorry I'm gonna read
[48:55] out of this lexicon about Felix Felix
[48:58] means happy so here's a happy sinner
[49:01] he's a role in pure curator of Judaea
[49:05] appointed by emperor claudius in 53 ad
[49:08] he ruled the province in a mean cruel
[49:12] manner his spirit office was full of
[49:16] troubles and submissions and this is
[49:19] when Paul is brought before him at
[49:21] Caesarea and he remained in prison and
[49:25] kept two more years in hopes of
[49:29] extorting money from him he badges
[49:31] Philip would keep a prisoner hoping
[49:34] somebody would give him money for this
[49:36] prisoner that was his whole motivation
[49:38] not justice but money isn't that our
[49:41] political system today right it's both
[49:44] sides Church it just ain't Democrats
[49:46] it's Republicans do right every four
[49:50] years the Republicans will say semi
[49:51] money we're against abortion and they
[49:53] never end it with me how come they don't
[49:59] do they got enough votes why they do it
[50:00] see it's cuz they're all about money
[50:03] many of them they just want the money
[50:06] oh my thank God I'm not a Republican or
[50:10] a Democrat I'm a Holy Ghost field safe
[50:12] praise God
[50:14] now I'd normally vote Republican but
[50:16] what good I'm sorry what good have they
[50:18] done we got we go there are voices we
[50:20] got to pray for that first and then make
[50:22] our voices heard that's right now he
[50:27] says this now let's read our scripture
[50:31] here so you can see this man was the
[50:34] husband of Drusilla she was a daughter
[50:37] of Herod Agrippa who was the third wife
[50:40] my his third wife whom he persuaded to
[50:44] leave her husband and marry him me see
[50:46] these guys were adulterers these guys
[50:49] and gals the Gauss - they didn't have
[50:51] temperance ladies God they just married
[50:55] one I'll marry another I'll bear and
[50:56] I'll put this one away I'll get another
[50:57] and a real man of God will tell them the
[51:01] truth of God's Word
[51:02] look at verse 24 after certain days with
[51:05] Felix came with wife Drusilla which was
[51:08] a Jewess he sent for Paul and hurt him
[51:10] concerning the faith in Christ I love
[51:13] this I was I loved when brother Johnny
[51:15] or
[51:16] amen will tell me they just got a chance
[51:18] to witness the message isn't that one
[51:20] the best feelings you can do is just
[51:21] witnesses somebody about Jesus Christ oh
[51:23] it's one of the great greatest feelings
[51:25] Church to share and testify of the God
[51:28] you know and like the Bible says God
[51:31] opens the door of utterance for you amen
[51:35] they want to hear about faith in Christ
[51:38] and of course there are adulterers now
[51:40] look at verse 25 and as he reasoned of
[51:45] righteousness so he knows there
[51:48] adulterers he knows his man's a dirty
[51:51] murderer he's cruel he knows he's a
[51:55] money-grubber writer oh that's right
[51:58] where he's just like money
[52:00] he wasn't fair he's a very unfair man he
[52:05] starts reasoning here of righteousness
[52:08] which means to dispute or argue now of
[52:11] course we know Laurentiis christians
[52:12] don't argue so he was reasoning with a
[52:15] calm voice we'd say he was just giving
[52:19] reasons why listen you need to live
[52:21] righteously because of these reasons
[52:23] it's the right thing to do in other
[52:26] words your life is going to be judged by
[52:28] Jesus Christ according to my gospel at
[52:31] the Judgment praise God he was trying to
[52:35] reason with them you need to live
[52:36] righteously and what else did he reason
[52:39] about temperance he was trying to argue
[52:43] with him and give him reasons you need
[52:45] to be more temperate and self-control
[52:47] and not what a fourth wife and actually
[52:52] get rid of your third and second to you
[52:55] can't you get back your first so let
[52:56] live single right when I get to that
[52:59] point just live single if you really got
[53:01] a heart for God that's right so he's
[53:05] giving him reasons how to control his
[53:08] sensual appetites and we know Herod
[53:12] memmer Herod a first birthday they had
[53:14] big birthday parties right and then he
[53:16] had his stepdaughter dance that sensual
[53:19] dance see and if that was Herod Agrippa
[53:23] what about these men you know it was an
[53:25] awful time period they probably had all
[53:28] more awful things and with them no doubt
[53:30] they didn't do what the Bible says they
[53:32] did we preached on that not long ago
[53:34] about Ephesus and how it was just it was
[53:36] just wherever the Roman government was
[53:39] it was rampant with sin I'll tell you
[53:43] about anything these guys stuck out like
[53:44] a sore thumb
[53:45] these Holy Ghost filled women these Holy
[53:47] Ghost filled men they stuck out like a
[53:49] sore thumb because they actually loved
[53:51] their lives and they were true to one
[53:55] wife praise God
[53:56] and they actually love their children
[53:58] amen didn't beat their wives they didn't
[54:01] beat their children they and they
[54:03] respected the slaves you know kiss
[54:05] Lavery was still around that time even
[54:07] God's ended up in the Jewish religion
[54:10] when they respected them as equals right
[54:12] as equal under God praise God they they
[54:16] were so different and people look at our
[54:19] lives they should see the same today
[54:20] we're a different people are something
[54:22] about us we're just so different because
[54:25] we have the love of Jesus Christ our
[54:28] lives are so different and so he really
[54:37] tries to give him all these arguments
[54:38] you need to be temperate and look at
[54:42] this and judgment to come if you don't
[54:44] repent you're gonna be judged Felix
[54:48] Felix tremble I like that look at that
[54:51] oh he must have might under a powerful
[54:53] anointing to argue the Word of God
[54:55] you're gonna face my Lord Jesus one day
[54:58] if you don't repent of this adultery you
[55:01] don't repent of this extortion that's
[55:02] money laundering laundering if you don't
[55:04] repent of that you're gonna face my
[55:05] Jesus and you're gonna be guilty and so
[55:08] he starts trembling now what a what a
[55:10] what a difference today you tell people
[55:12] about Jesus they laugh it off they get
[55:14] they fill up their car with gasoline
[55:15] drive away don't even think about what a
[55:17] difference see but they travel and don't
[55:22] forget Church you and I should tremble
[55:24] too because the Bible says work out your
[55:26] salvation with fear and trembling amen
[55:29] there should be times not every service
[55:31] of course when there's to be seasons
[55:32] where we come to church and we're just
[55:34] trembling and we just want to make sure
[55:36] everything's right we want to make sure
[55:37] we're anointed with all of these are
[55:39] known
[55:41] we don't want one missin if one's
[55:43] missing brother amen we get nervous
[55:45] listen even if I don't see this I don't
[55:46] have this anointing on me Oh God
[55:49] I need it send the Oh Lord send the
[55:51] power just now praise God see we don't
[55:55] want to be weak
[55:56] we don't want to be taken captive we
[55:59] want to be overcomers amen
[56:01] we want to be strong in the faith
[56:03] hallelujah so we search out our
[56:05] salvation with fear and trembling many
[56:09] times before service when I'm praying
[56:10] here I'll just tread water the power of
[56:12] God knowing I've got to answer to Jesus
[56:14] Christ for what I preached that day but
[56:17] also I don't want to fall short of the
[56:19] glory of God and I want to live what I'm
[56:23] preaching praise God because I have to
[56:26] answer and I want to be right with God I
[56:30] want to make my calling and election
[56:32] sure Oh everybody to know which side I'm
[56:36] on praise God so he trembles in the
[56:39] answers that go that way for this time
[56:40] for when I have a convenient season I
[56:43] will call for thee and the numbers 26 he
[56:46] don't also that money should have been
[56:48] given him appalled that he might loose
[56:49] him
[56:50] wherefore he sent him for the oftener
[56:53] and commune with him my his only
[56:58] motivation see his wife wanted to hear
[57:00] the word this this new revelation this
[57:02] new message but he's trembling realizing
[57:06] he's under the conviction of the Holy
[57:07] Spirit but he said I'll just keep her
[57:09] around to try to get some money see how
[57:10] people can be so look how close he was
[57:12] to salvation all right he was right he
[57:15] could have been saved right there there
[57:16] was trouble he was at a valley of
[57:18] decision but he turns it down and just
[57:21] get out of my presidency we got to hang
[57:23] around Holy Ghost fell Saints Amen when
[57:26] you feel conviction hang around church a
[57:28] little longer praise God if everybody
[57:31] rushes out after service thank God
[57:32] they've got no we got things to do
[57:34] fellowship whatever but if you're
[57:35] trembling and on friends hanging around
[57:37] request more prayer seek God with all
[57:40] your heart trembling in fear is a godly
[57:43] attribute and I say we need it more
[57:45] praise God we don't need it less we need
[57:48] a bar even but you know but you see it
[57:51] less praise God
[57:52] I'm sure Wesley in his church
[57:54] with Johnny used to go to the church
[57:55] there I'm sure I'm sure we see it at all
[57:58] at all churches right we got look at our
[58:00] church as well are we are we trembling
[58:04] in fear for our salvation are we more
[58:07] concerned about other things after
[58:08] church see it has to be a constant
[58:12] examination praise God we got to be
[58:15] constantly examining ourselves and
[58:17] making sure we have this godly
[58:19] temperance that we're supposed to have
[58:21] praise God
[58:23] now the only other time it's used is
[58:26] where we get to at the end the only
[58:28] other time it's used in Scripture is
[58:30] Galatians 5:23 where Paul talks about
[58:32] the fruits of the spirit and we'll get
[58:36] to that at the end by God's grace he
[58:39] lists he lists all the sins that will
[58:41] not inherit the kingdom of God they'll
[58:43] have no rulership in the kingdom of God
[58:45] they will not sit on the throne
[58:47] adulterers murderers drunkards revelers
[58:53] emulators those have variants those with
[58:55] hatred witchcraft they will not inherit
[58:58] the kingdom of God they're not worthy
[59:00] but see when we obey God's Word it makes
[59:03] us worthy amen that's right
[59:06] he said he told the Sardis church he
[59:08] said you are worthy because you walked
[59:10] with me and why praise God
[59:12] your daily walk your daily innocent
[59:15] Christian walk makes you worthy to rule
[59:17] and reign with Christ for a thousand
[59:19] years
[59:21] that's right church he said but the
[59:26] fruit of the Spirit in Galatians 5:22 is
[59:28] love joy peace long-suffering gentleness
[59:32] goodness faith so see faith is you have
[59:35] two you can have two annoying things of
[59:37] faith an anointing when you just get
[59:40] saved but then you have faith that is
[59:43] mature faith that people can look at
[59:45] your lives and you're an experienced
[59:47] Christian now and they see a fruit of it
[59:50] it is evident it is clear they have an
[59:54] assurance ain't no this faith is an
[59:56] assurance faith is a revelation so a
[1:00:00] mature Christian has the fruit of faith
[1:00:02] it's so evident it's clear
[1:00:05] this person's got a revelation they have
[1:00:07] an assurance that Christ is real praise
[1:00:10] God it's rare you don't find this very
[1:00:14] often like we said when we preach it you
[1:00:16] don't find these fruits burnouts and
[1:00:18] they're very rare
[1:00:19] and Jesus said something very rare
[1:00:21] because there was only four kinds of
[1:00:23] grounds only one of them produced any
[1:00:25] freaked one out of four kinds right and
[1:00:31] so building off of that now when I look
[1:00:36] at a few more things here I want to deal
[1:00:42] a little bit with a little more on the
[1:00:46] flesh here so let's go to Philippians
[1:00:47] three I'm sorry
[1:00:56] Philippians four metal roof ins for for
[1:01:01] now we're not there we're not to chapter
[1:01:04] four yet in the Philippians were still
[1:01:05] in chapter one I haven't been on that
[1:01:08] series lately the last few weeks cuz
[1:01:10] I've been feeling led to preach on this
[1:01:16] so Paul is closing the letter he's
[1:01:19] greeting people he's kind of correcting
[1:01:21] people here in Chapter four at the end
[1:01:22] of the letter verse three and I treat
[1:01:26] the also true yoke fellow help those
[1:01:28] women which labored with me in the
[1:01:30] gospel with Clement also and with other
[1:01:33] my fellow laborers whose names are in
[1:01:35] the book of life and they're yeah people
[1:01:39] that labor faithfully for Christ their
[1:01:41] names in the book of life when were they
[1:01:44] placed there before the foundation of
[1:01:45] the world verse four rejoice in the Lord
[1:01:49] always and again I say rejoice now the
[1:01:53] next verse is where I want to get to let
[1:01:55] your moderation be known unto all men
[1:01:58] the Lord is at hand the Lord is at hand
[1:02:04] means he's near he's you have near
[1:02:08] access to God his time of coming is
[1:02:13] imminent it's soon to come to pass so he
[1:02:16] said let your moderation
[1:02:18] be known to just the church no let your
[1:02:24] moderation be known just to your family
[1:02:27] no to everyone see where I'm going
[1:02:32] now moderation means fairness mildness
[1:02:38] gentleness patience and physical
[1:02:41] moderation a church let me say like this
[1:02:46] you and I and our church has a our
[1:02:51] church has a reputation this is why I
[1:02:53] want to get to churches in Lima all have
[1:02:56] a reputation all right
[1:02:58] Mansfield churches have a referee
[1:03:00] reputation Pennsylvania churches have a
[1:03:02] reputation so do we everybody has a
[1:03:06] reputation praise God
[1:03:09] Paul says you need to be known your
[1:03:14] reputation
[1:03:15] should be established upon moderation
[1:03:20] gentleness and self-control praise God
[1:03:25] why because the Lord is soon to come
[1:03:28] right see every nun think about this
[1:03:33] every church has a reputation I can
[1:03:34] think right now churches that are known
[1:03:36] for the plays they put on that's what
[1:03:38] they're known for
[1:03:39] our plays okay well yeah they can be
[1:03:42] okay but is that them should that be the
[1:03:45] main thing when a church is known for I
[1:03:47] don't think so that's why I don't do
[1:03:50] many here they're fine if you want to do
[1:03:52] one every now and then right
[1:03:53] how many how many know a church this no
[1:03:55] more place how many know a church that's
[1:03:57] known for their youth meetings I know
[1:04:01] that that can be good especially if
[1:04:03] they're Holy Ghost meetings praise God
[1:04:04] oh yeah that's what you want but then
[1:04:09] there's other churches we know that are
[1:04:11] known for arguing fighting division
[1:04:16] church splits worldliness right
[1:04:23] compromise and the church said see every
[1:04:28] shirt you have a reputation letting know
[1:04:31] it or not
[1:04:32] we have a reputation whether you know it
[1:04:34] or not and Paul says here your
[1:04:37] moderation your control is what everyone
[1:04:42] should know about you hey churches like
[1:04:45] this everybody else in the world's like
[1:04:46] a loose cannon they shoot all things
[1:04:50] with their mouths they'll take in
[1:04:52] everything in their body they'll wear
[1:04:54] anything they'll say anything go do
[1:04:57] anything but you would hire to be known
[1:04:59] that we can control this devil right we
[1:05:02] can control these Devils we can rebuke
[1:05:04] these that way we can control this devil
[1:05:06] nature in our bodies why because they've
[1:05:09] got a greater power than the signature
[1:05:12] we've got divine nature amen praise God
[1:05:16] a lot of churches are known for their
[1:05:21] food and fellowships that's okay but is
[1:05:25] that what we're supposed to be known for
[1:05:27] you're supposed to be known for your
[1:05:29] moderation praise God and of course the
[1:05:34] Holy Ghost and fire like we said you
[1:05:35] services where the Holy Ghost fall
[1:05:37] that's great that's awesome so see
[1:05:41] Church everybody has a reputation and we
[1:05:45] want our reputation to be moderation
[1:05:48] we want our reputation to be the Holy
[1:05:51] Ghost praise God God's pure word a made
[1:05:55] love of the Brethren right loving your
[1:05:59] neighbor as remember there's only two
[1:06:03] thirsts and Satan's right or two
[1:06:05] directions of the thirst right to the
[1:06:06] world or to holiness and so it's one or
[1:06:11] the other praise God and we all see
[1:06:14] churches that have a reputation of
[1:06:16] feeding the black dog writer or feeding
[1:06:19] the worldly lusts and they don't have
[1:06:22] the temperance they don't have that they
[1:06:25] don't have that Co weed Saturday they
[1:06:27] don't have that reputation praise God
[1:06:29] but we should have it by the grace of
[1:06:31] the Lord amen let's go to back to
[1:06:34] proverbs 23 I want to just bring this
[1:06:36] out again briefly
[1:06:43] proverbs 23 20 and 21 so let's look at
[1:07:01] gluttony a little bit more by God's
[1:07:02] grace cuz I believe this is one of the
[1:07:04] biggest hindrances upon the American
[1:07:06] church
[1:07:07] how many would say amen to that I know
[1:07:09] lots of churches that have a lot of
[1:07:11] great feasting but now how many have a
[1:07:13] any fasting hello I know a lotta they
[1:07:18] can cook a lot of good things which we
[1:07:20] like it times we like that sometimes but
[1:07:25] not all the time if you like that all
[1:07:27] the time
[1:07:27] you are certainly lacking this and if
[1:07:29] you're lacking that I got a lot of
[1:07:30] concern you're lacking that you don't
[1:07:34] understand what's going on to you if
[1:07:37] you're lacking that I doubt you're
[1:07:38] living it very well there and you might
[1:07:40] just have that because at least you can
[1:07:42] come to church you know what I mean
[1:07:45] so proverbs 23 20 21 let's let's read 19
[1:07:54] though 23:19 here that my son of be wise
[1:07:57] and guide thine heart in the way see got
[1:07:59] a guided W eyes verse 20 be not among
[1:08:04] wine-bibber x' among riotous eaters of
[1:08:07] the flesh he says for the drunkard and
[1:08:11] the glutton II shall both come to
[1:08:14] poverty and drowsiness shall close a man
[1:08:18] with rags okay so I was dealing with
[1:08:22] this a little bit on Wednesday night I
[1:08:23] didn't feel like I had finished the
[1:08:25] thought and I'd like to finish this a
[1:08:27] little bit more here or deal with it a
[1:08:29] little bit more Paul says let your
[1:08:31] moderation be known to all men everyone
[1:08:33] to know how much control you have if not
[1:08:36] you have sinned against the Lord amen
[1:08:40] the Holy Spirit Guides us to this and
[1:08:44] then he gives us the next one and the
[1:08:46] next one and the next it's a journey huh
[1:08:49] me on a journey with the Lord praise God
[1:08:50] amen
[1:08:51] yes you're on the journey and so
[1:08:55] Solomon the wisest man who actually fell
[1:08:58] to this eventually write drunkenness and
[1:09:00] women and he places drunkenness and
[1:09:03] gluttony together which is very fitting
[1:09:06] and he says it'll bring you to poverty
[1:09:09] so see because you get lately says there
[1:09:12] you get lazy when you eat too much you
[1:09:14] get lazy brother branham got sick
[1:09:17] because he ate too much I have a quote
[1:09:22] on that this is from 1965 so now we were
[1:09:29] just come back from of the east I kind
[1:09:31] of run myself down a little by
[1:09:32] overeating and he says why over kindness
[1:09:36] of all the people down the mountains so
[1:09:38] he was visiting people down the
[1:09:39] mountains he's out on a hunting trip
[1:09:40] visiting and you know how he said he's a
[1:09:42] guest and you know how people like to be
[1:09:44] hospitable and he got sick from
[1:09:48] overeating
[1:09:49] and what to do it took him down he said
[1:09:53] so I got sick and I haven't felt good
[1:09:55] this week so you pray for me so seen he
[1:10:00] kind of he admits he just ate because
[1:10:02] the people set the food in front of me
[1:10:04] ever been guilty that don't worry though
[1:10:06] people just set something Brody will
[1:10:09] tell you you need an anointing to say no
[1:10:11] thank you
[1:10:15] you'll get it if you ask for church
[1:10:17] that's right temperance Amen Jesus was
[1:10:21] 40 days hungry but they met and Satan
[1:10:23] said turn this stone to bread and he
[1:10:26] said man does not live by bread alone
[1:10:27] but by every word ever see the mouth of
[1:10:31] hey man it don't have to be eaten I
[1:10:36] understand my brother branham would I
[1:10:38] probably the same thing but as the more
[1:10:40] times I went four times in South America
[1:10:42] each time I went add more grace just to
[1:10:43] say no thanks cuz all they have is pop
[1:10:45] over there and pop is the worst thing
[1:10:47] for me but even if I drink pop you I get
[1:10:50] rashes all over here I get red rashes if
[1:10:54] I drink pop because it's it's awful it's
[1:10:57] gonna kill people it's gonna get people
[1:10:58] diabetes right okay so I would buy the
[1:11:00] third or fourth time I'm like no I don't
[1:11:02] want your pop I didn't care because I
[1:11:05] gotta take care of God's man
[1:11:08] you know brother said that you have to
[1:11:11] take care of the Lord's man but they
[1:11:14] meant Satan's trying to kill you kill
[1:11:19] the man or a woman that you are but you
[1:11:21] got to take care of God's man that you
[1:11:24] are God's woman that you are did you
[1:11:26] know that dr. Bosworth of told brother
[1:11:33] Branham this it was in 1961 brother
[1:11:39] Bosworth said stop preaching too long
[1:11:41] and too hard and both man kept trying to
[1:11:44] say well I'd rather wear out than rust
[1:11:46] out my brother BAM realized he was gonna
[1:11:48] wear out and that's why he started
[1:11:51] increasing his hunting trips because the
[1:11:53] trips would wear him down physically and
[1:11:56] so he had to go back up there to rest
[1:11:58] and restore and recover and then he
[1:12:05] tells his story of Paul Rader Paul Rader
[1:12:07] was a wonderful preacher and I think he
[1:12:09] wrote hymns as well he said I remember
[1:12:12] Paul Rader how many ever met Paul Rader
[1:12:15] he's a great man of God told a little
[1:12:17] story one time he was going on a train I
[1:12:19] listen this story you like this and he
[1:12:21] was with another man and said this man
[1:12:23] tried to get back at him because he
[1:12:25] slept in a Pullman that night
[1:12:27] now Pullman was kind of like we'd say
[1:12:29] like a first-class bed or seat on a
[1:12:31] train so there was preachers on the
[1:12:35] train and Paul Raiders like I need to
[1:12:37] get a Pullman I need to ride first class
[1:12:38] and the other preachers are like they're
[1:12:42] upset at him because he rode first class
[1:12:44] we'd say now did something similar that
[1:12:46] I don't know exactly but I looked it up
[1:12:48] on the dictionary that's what it says
[1:12:49] okay so I'm doing the best I didn't live
[1:12:51] back then so I don't know I don't ride
[1:12:52] trains either so I'm just doing the best
[1:12:54] I can and then at the morning breakfast
[1:12:58] a group of ministers was going somewhere
[1:13:00] for a convention and so this man sent
[1:13:02] right next to Paul you ever meet a
[1:13:04] Christian like that they just want to
[1:13:06] sit by you so they can criticize you
[1:13:08] I let them they purposely come around
[1:13:12] you just to tell you you're wrong and to
[1:13:15] criticize you well let me tell you
[1:13:17] that's Satan is he's the accuser of the
[1:13:18] Brethren this guy comes around
[1:13:21] he watchin imagine he's carried his
[1:13:23] Bible and he watches Paul go in the
[1:13:25] first class a man of God take first
[1:13:28] class and so he says the next morning
[1:13:31] I'm gonna sit by him I'm gonna fall him
[1:13:33] on I'm an embarrassing in front of all
[1:13:35] the preachers oh I can't wait to
[1:13:37] embarrass him and when you act like that
[1:13:39] you know you're devil possessed maybe
[1:13:42] not in your body but in your mind now
[1:13:48] look at the story now of course he said
[1:13:51] well praise God he said i sat in a chair
[1:13:54] car a chair car last night and I saved
[1:13:59] the Lord some money look at these look
[1:14:01] at this pride he's around the table and
[1:14:04] he knew he slept in the first passage I
[1:14:06] slept in a chair last night I saved the
[1:14:08] Lord some money
[1:14:16] Paul said praise God I took a Pullman
[1:14:21] and I saved the Lord's man worried about
[1:14:30] money but Paul knew I've labored really
[1:14:34] hard I preach really hard I need some
[1:14:37] rest if I don't get some rest
[1:14:39] I'm gonna be an awful angry person
[1:14:41] tomorrow and you won't want to hear me
[1:14:43] preach tomorrow you see that so he said
[1:14:48] oh I saved the Lord some money bless God
[1:14:51] he said I slept in first-class
[1:14:53] I saved the Lord's man a church I've
[1:14:58] never flown first class God is my
[1:15:00] witness
[1:15:01] but if I was desperately tired sister
[1:15:04] Wendy I consider it if I thought I was
[1:15:06] going to like pass out the next day
[1:15:08] really amen I consider it but I've never
[1:15:11] been that harsh I've never been that
[1:15:12] sick or tired before but I've never
[1:15:15] labored like some of those brothers
[1:15:16] labored either remember one vision that
[1:15:23] struck Daniel he got sick for many days
[1:15:25] if brother Branham had vision after
[1:15:27] vision after vision let him go up in
[1:15:30] there for two-three weeks let him go
[1:15:31] over there for a month he's just trying
[1:15:33] to recover so he can serve God's people
[1:15:36] so see there's a ballast to all this and
[1:15:39] I'm just saying that from I'm using
[1:15:40] myself as a decimal I would only use the
[1:15:43] first class if I absolutely needed it
[1:15:45] and so far it's been good I haven't he
[1:15:47] really needed it because I have a
[1:15:48] labored like them but if somewhat of a
[1:15:51] man or a woman was desperately tired or
[1:15:53] sick or labored and they needed to treat
[1:15:55] their flesh a little more gently go
[1:15:58] ahead you're taking care of God serving
[1:16:00] praise God
[1:16:01] oh thank the Lord
[1:16:05] get a good night's rest Church you're
[1:16:08] tired go to bed early save God's woman
[1:16:12] you mothers your time dads take care of
[1:16:15] that put the kids down let the moms go
[1:16:17] to bed early save God's woman praise God
[1:16:20] don't let him die and wear themselves
[1:16:23] out and frustrate themselves help people
[1:16:26] so they can recover and get back and
[1:16:28] have more strength so when the enemy
[1:16:31] comes they'll have more strength to be
[1:16:33] able to cast him down praise God and you
[1:16:35] know whether they have said his hardest
[1:16:37] temptations was when he was most tired
[1:16:39] and the thing is it's proven by Jesus
[1:16:42] when he was the most tired after forty
[1:16:43] days not eating not drinking
[1:16:45] that's when Satan came your hardest
[1:16:48] battles are going to come when you're
[1:16:50] the most tired when you're the most weak
[1:16:55] so save God's men they meant save God's
[1:16:59] man he's been doing a good job and let
[1:17:01] me give an example when we have special
[1:17:03] meetings four in a row I was like by the
[1:17:05] Amen instead of you doing all four song
[1:17:07] services can I lead a couple now first I
[1:17:10] don't remember I don't know but you have
[1:17:12] to correct me on this one man I don't
[1:17:14] know if he was open to it right away but
[1:17:16] after a couple of times he's like yeah
[1:17:17] he's like he's like brother Jesse can
[1:17:18] you lead two of them and I'll lead to
[1:17:20] him he's trying to save God's man praise
[1:17:23] God and that's why I set my timer I'm
[1:17:28] trying to save God's man not today I'm
[1:17:30] not trying to save God's man he's only
[1:17:32] got one service I'm gonna preach to them
[1:17:35] longer today by God's grace yeah I could
[1:17:38] secret tomorrow brother Wesley if I want
[1:17:41] so you see it Church it's about having
[1:17:45] wisdom
[1:17:48] how many the wisdom of God so I have to
[1:17:52] balance everything I have to balance on
[1:17:54] you know starving my body crucified my
[1:17:57] desires but also recognizing this might
[1:18:00] be a moment when I need to rest a little
[1:18:03] more because I know the Christian life
[1:18:06] is not a flowery bed of knees it's a war
[1:18:09] it's a cross caring journey take up your
[1:18:13] cross every day and follow me it's gonna
[1:18:15] be a slow death slowly learning to obey
[1:18:18] slowly learning to live with this
[1:18:20] anointing I know most the time it's
[1:18:23] going to be a hard battle but if there's
[1:18:24] a time if there's a juniper tree frames
[1:18:27] behind it and there's a place I can find
[1:18:29] those arrests then I believe God will
[1:18:31] guide me to it I want to be open to
[1:18:33] embrace not and what God to give me to
[1:18:35] feed me like you did Elijah and I want
[1:18:37] to be able to go in that food for 40
[1:18:39] days crazy you understand what I'm
[1:18:41] saying praise God in other words I want
[1:18:43] a fresh anointing praise God
[1:18:45] in my moment of weakness my hours
[1:18:50] weren't tired which really took compared
[1:18:51] to Jesus we're really not we don't have
[1:18:53] it that hard at all compared to Paul and
[1:18:56] a prison here it's really not that hard
[1:18:58] [Applause]
[1:19:01] well yet what's hard is our mind battles
[1:19:05] there's never been a harder time of mind
[1:19:09] battles than right now
[1:19:10] and that's because Paul said evil
[1:19:13] seducers will wax worse and worse
[1:19:16] deceiving and being deceived
[1:19:19] so church many times our bodies are
[1:19:22] going to be tired because our minds have
[1:19:24] been laboring and fighting all day to
[1:19:27] cast down all these thoughts and
[1:19:29] temptations and distractions and
[1:19:31] deceptions it's never been this hard on
[1:19:34] the human spirit then right now I got
[1:19:37] one more to prove to you Jesus said
[1:19:38] because iniquity shall abound the love
[1:19:40] of many shall wax cold Church this world
[1:19:45] is getting more and more full of
[1:19:47] iniquity
[1:19:48] they are literally going to be workers
[1:19:49] of iniquity children of hell that Jesus
[1:19:53] pours the vials of judgment the woes of
[1:19:56] judgment the trumpet of judgment afar
[1:19:59] because all they knew
[1:20:01] god help us to be anointed to work
[1:20:04] righteousness amen yeah and that starts
[1:20:08] with conquering your body's passions
[1:20:13] that's where it starts it has to start
[1:20:15] right away in the morning most the time
[1:20:22] I don't have to sleep in I every morning
[1:20:24] where they run Johnny I probably get up
[1:20:26] at 5:00 5:30 every morning I have to
[1:20:28] sleep but I go to bed 10:30 11:00 I get
[1:20:30] up at 5:30 no problem no problem
[1:20:33] it's so what I'm saying is most of the
[1:20:36] time I've got to be careful not to give
[1:20:39] in to the lusts of the flesh in other
[1:20:41] words I rarely have to rest my physical
[1:20:43] body like gods man like the large man in
[1:20:47] the Pullman I don't many other times do
[1:20:51] that and so you and I need to focus on
[1:20:56] being anointed with temperance to deny
[1:21:00] the sensual lusts of the flesh
[1:21:04] because remember gluttony and
[1:21:06] drunkenness go together they get all
[1:21:08] their money's on food all their money's
[1:21:10] on drink and so the Bible says most of
[1:21:13] them will become poor they have no
[1:21:14] savings because all their money is into
[1:21:18] their current pleasures what do I have
[1:21:19] now what I have right now I got to feed
[1:21:21] my pleasure right now and they're not
[1:21:23] sitting anyway for the future so see and
[1:21:29] we're all going to have a reputation in
[1:21:32] fact you don't have to tell anybody your
[1:21:34] reputation just then being around you
[1:21:36] they know your reputation amen because
[1:21:43] the Bible said let your light so shine
[1:21:45] that they might see your good works and
[1:21:47] glorify your father in heaven and he
[1:21:51] said he said all men are gonna know your
[1:21:53] reputation reputation but you have to
[1:21:55] make sure your reputation is moderation
[1:21:57] Oh everybody knows pastor Jesse's the
[1:22:03] first one in line at the buffet and he's
[1:22:06] the last one to leave what kind of
[1:22:09] reputation would that be for a preacher
[1:22:10] but you know a lot of preachers got that
[1:22:14] they do everybody knows that right most
[1:22:18] people know that see you're gonna
[1:22:22] develop a reputation among us and this
[1:22:26] should be moderation it should be
[1:22:30] self-control well I just can't do it I
[1:22:34] happen to know somebody who can
[1:22:36] Jesus I mean it's anointing annoying
[1:22:42] thing praise God you're just gonna ask
[1:22:44] believe I just can't overcome this I
[1:22:52] just get on just this this fleshly thing
[1:22:55] I know something that can Jesus can
[1:22:57] overcome it he gives you an anointing
[1:23:01] which is power and authority he gives
[1:23:04] you power authority over the sensual
[1:23:06] desires amen
[1:23:08] because really your body's not your own
[1:23:14] see when you feed God's body more than
[1:23:19] it needs or when you feed God's body
[1:23:21] things it doesn't need you're wrong it's
[1:23:27] not your body how many number first
[1:23:29] gonna insist you are bought with the
[1:23:32] price you can't say well I can eat
[1:23:34] whatever I want I can drink whatever I
[1:23:36] want I can spend my money on whenever I
[1:23:38] want no you can't I bet you you're gonna
[1:23:41] answer for it and if Paul was here he'd
[1:23:45] argue with you Oh glory that's what he
[1:23:53] would say you're feeding your sensual
[1:23:56] desires you need to be temperate cuz
[1:23:59] there's coming a judgement a praise God
[1:24:00] and God is giving us a power that can
[1:24:03] overcome this body amen
[1:24:05] I know yeah oh thank you lord
[1:24:14] so see it's an anointing instead of
[1:24:17] being anointed with the desire for I'm
[1:24:18] just using buffets you know because it's
[1:24:20] a big place of it's a big place of
[1:24:24] gluttony it's an obvious place of
[1:24:26] gluttony
[1:24:27] that's one of the most things that you
[1:24:29] see I'm so sad that's why I don't go to
[1:24:31] buffets at all
[1:24:32] curses they're dirty as well a lot of
[1:24:35] germs you know about day one reason I
[1:24:38] don't like going there is because I see
[1:24:40] people and they're like slaves to the
[1:24:41] buffet line they are very very unhealthy
[1:24:43] I'm just gonna say like that and they
[1:24:45] just keep going back and keep and then
[1:24:47] plate after plate and Turk that breaks
[1:24:49] my heart
[1:24:50] look what they're doing to the temple of
[1:24:52] God it's not even their temple it's
[1:24:55] God's temple now if you need an extra
[1:24:59] plate that's what we knew done I don't
[1:25:04] know your calorie income that you need
[1:25:06] or your calorie matter on it I don't
[1:25:08] know what you need but you know what you
[1:25:10] need like I imagine look at Johnny and
[1:25:13] I'll even use myself
[1:25:15] Johnny how are you 6 4 6 6 praise God
[1:25:18] look at that he could probably eat way
[1:25:21] more than all of us and it doesn't even
[1:25:23] it won't even go to like fat right
[1:25:27] like his body needs that much let me
[1:25:29] give example when I was in college
[1:25:30] football explained attacker
[1:25:31] I could eat to Chipotle burritos in one
[1:25:34] city now I can hardly one now Wesley but
[1:25:40] when I was working out seven days a week
[1:25:41] and I was trying to be tough mr. copped
[1:25:45] my calories and protein high PD two of
[1:25:47] those burritos okay he's like you're
[1:25:52] crazy I know I was I was crazy I was a
[1:25:57] sports fanatic I didn't have this but
[1:26:00] actually you know what I needed that
[1:26:02] actually others say like that I actually
[1:26:03] needed that I was trying to be 190 and
[1:26:06] everything like that but I'm just giving
[1:26:07] you an example like there's some people
[1:26:08] that just need it and then some people
[1:26:10] are made bigger and wider than others
[1:26:12] and some are like skate flagpoles you
[1:26:16] others are so skinny but God loves a
[1:26:19] variety but the point I'm trying to make
[1:26:22] is that it's the anointing that allows
[1:26:26] you to treat God's body the right way
[1:26:28] they praise God we just have to reject
[1:26:30] the wrong anointing and take the holy
[1:26:33] anointing of God like yesterday now I'm
[1:26:37] gonna give you an example what I ate
[1:26:38] yesterday my wife said my breakfast
[1:26:40] isn't very
[1:26:41] we're talking on the way here and I
[1:26:42] admit it but most days I get up at 5:00
[1:26:45] I'll drink a lot of water now this has
[1:26:49] worked for me I don't know what will
[1:26:50] work for you I'm gonna make changes this
[1:26:51] week honey so hold hold hold me to it
[1:26:53] down it's Father's Day I'm gonna turn a
[1:26:56] corner today actually I'm gonna try to
[1:27:00] anyways
[1:27:01] I'll wake up a five-dollar water before
[1:27:03] I come to study the church I'll just
[1:27:04] have an apple too orange
[1:27:06] see healthy sugars are okay I'm sorry
[1:27:07] natural sugars okay well my wife says I
[1:27:10] need more like was a healthy fats in the
[1:27:12] morning and protein and healthy
[1:27:14] cholesterol so this week I'm gonna buy
[1:27:17] some hard-boiled eggs with a mint
[1:27:19] I hate taking time to make the food I
[1:27:21] just want to eat and go on I just thank
[1:27:24] God for wives that you know thank God
[1:27:25] for mothers I would sit there and take
[1:27:27] that time and they'll make sure it's
[1:27:28] healthy me I just want to let's go let's
[1:27:30] pick it up in I can eat so fast you
[1:27:33] should see me brain and I can eat man I
[1:27:35] can eat fast
[1:27:35] I just want to get it done to move on
[1:27:39] and then for lunch I have a huge meaty
[1:27:41] salad you know
[1:27:42] and then for supper yesterday I had the
[1:27:45] chicken and then one piece of pizza rice
[1:27:50] then I got home I had some meat that was
[1:27:53] all I mean very very little and so I've
[1:27:56] learned over the years to try to eat as
[1:27:59] little as I can and then I don't we try
[1:28:01] too fast regular Luna tea right you'll
[1:28:03] be very healthy if you fast regularly at
[1:28:04] least once or twice a week
[1:28:05] it's called intermittent fasting and God
[1:28:09] showed me 20 years ago I stopped
[1:28:11] drinking pot 20 years ago because
[1:28:13] everybody knows sugar is gonna produce
[1:28:15] diabetes and let me tell you I'm not
[1:28:17] gonna name this person but I sat down at
[1:28:19] the table with the person lesss so he
[1:28:21] already passed away few years ago but I
[1:28:23] sat down with the person and he was
[1:28:26] diabetic and I he I saw how he got there
[1:28:29] I'll just say like that cuz he wrote
[1:28:30] down every day all the calories diet
[1:28:32] coke or I'm sorry the coffee was sugar
[1:28:34] in the morning gonna see oh here's a pad
[1:28:36] in here hey was it a go or Legos or
[1:28:41] pancakes and syrup a cherry cherry
[1:28:48] pastry for lunch pizza
[1:28:54] and then the evening upper sandwich and
[1:28:57] a burger oh and in each time in between
[1:28:59] drinking diet pop all day the man died
[1:29:04] of cancer and he had that so I'm saying
[1:29:07] is he became a type two diabetic and
[1:29:10] that this is the sad part the doctors
[1:29:13] were telling him you're pretty healthy
[1:29:14] and he's feeding himself trash all day
[1:29:17] and then they wonder why is it this way
[1:29:21] because it's all sugar no temperance see
[1:29:27] that's just one example I want to give
[1:29:29] you because I saw a man with her away in
[1:29:31] the last ten years I've seen him wither
[1:29:32] away till he died of cancer
[1:29:34] I just eaten eating and drinking sugar
[1:29:36] all day right we got to eat healthy
[1:29:40] Church right you got to eat Whole Foods
[1:29:44] try to eat it in the way God made it if
[1:29:47] you can now brothers I'm gonna give you
[1:29:49] some meat afterwards and it's probably
[1:29:51] not in the right state but it says
[1:29:54] natural on the label so let me say eat
[1:29:59] it in moderation don't eat it all one
[1:30:03] city but see like I told you we we have
[1:30:08] to be known for our moderation we can
[1:30:10] fast at times or then we can when we
[1:30:13] need a meal we can get a good meal but
[1:30:16] we really have to use wisdom because my
[1:30:18] wife and I have seen it we've seen
[1:30:19] people curse the devil for them getting
[1:30:22] cancer or diabetes and it's their own
[1:30:25] fault it wasn't the devil that that gave
[1:30:28] them that cancer the devil might have
[1:30:30] tricked him to having that bad diet it
[1:30:32] was the bad diet it was the lack of Holy
[1:30:34] Ghost anointing praise God
[1:30:36] and then then after all those years and
[1:30:39] decades of not having any temperance
[1:30:43] lacking that anointing now they wasn't
[1:30:44] God anoint them for healing in church
[1:30:46] sometimes God has done it
[1:30:47] thank now if that's a if that is a mercy
[1:30:50] I don't know what is you purposely feed
[1:30:53] yourself God's body God's temple you
[1:30:56] purposely defile God's temple then you
[1:31:00] get mad when it suffers the consequences
[1:31:02] of it I think Steven you and I talked
[1:31:06] about this one time I used
[1:31:07] get fast food fanatic I told a madness
[1:31:09] in college brother I had so much money I
[1:31:11] grew up poor Stephen and so I got a full
[1:31:13] scholarship and they would just send me
[1:31:15] a huge check once a semester it was like
[1:31:18] I don't even know what does that felt
[1:31:19] like a rich man I said to pay my rent
[1:31:23] and all this money for food well-dressed
[1:31:24] even in the morning I do my eggs and you
[1:31:26] know and then for lunch I would always
[1:31:29] do my eggs but every night I just treat
[1:31:31] myself you know I'm just so proud of
[1:31:33] myself for getting a college degree of
[1:31:35] playing college football
[1:31:37] each night I had a different fast food
[1:31:39] choice Monday was Chinese Tuesday was
[1:31:45] Mickey D's and you name it you know on
[1:31:48] down and after I got done playing
[1:31:51] football it
[1:31:52] that was a bad habit and it got worse
[1:31:54] brother Wesley then every morning I was
[1:31:56] going for an Egg McMuffin at McDonald's
[1:31:58] and when I started getting when we got
[1:32:01] engaged I started realizing wow and my
[1:32:05] wife's like just fiance
[1:32:07] you're spend a lot of money on fast food
[1:32:08] Jesse we're gonna get married and sorry
[1:32:13] finally started a trend you're stirring
[1:32:15] up there oh yeah this probably isn't the
[1:32:17] healthiest way plus it's not a good use
[1:32:19] of money either and so God had to take I
[1:32:22] was addicted to dr. pepper as well and
[1:32:26] that's when I would get the rashes and
[1:32:28] everything like that and that's when God
[1:32:30] had to show me I had no temperance
[1:32:32] praise God
[1:32:34] I couldn't even control myself it's like
[1:32:38] it's kind of got felt like a shaking on
[1:32:40] the inside Stephen I needed that double
[1:32:43] pounder or double quarter-pounder with
[1:32:44] cheese it was awful and that's what
[1:32:49] that's what my wife knew me as that was
[1:32:52] what I was known as a fast-food junkie a
[1:32:56] dr. pepper drinkin junkie Church we
[1:32:59] don't want that kind of reputation we
[1:33:03] don't want the reputation of the person
[1:33:05] who eats the most cake right we don't
[1:33:11] want the reputation of the person you
[1:33:14] name it at the at the fellowship that
[1:33:16] goes up for four or five plates or the
[1:33:19] person who every day is known
[1:33:21] okay there's a certain family member I
[1:33:22] love but they're known for drinking
[1:33:24] gallons of Mountain Dew that's going to
[1:33:28] destroy them teeth first and then later
[1:33:32] all the effects of that gonna absolutely
[1:33:34] destroy them like now we laugh a little
[1:33:37] bit cuz every now and then we like a
[1:33:38] little splurge right that's okay
[1:33:40] brother Graham did it every now and then
[1:33:42] but it's moderation it's a very few
[1:33:46] times but see it takes an anointing to
[1:33:51] do that did you know that church you
[1:33:53] need anointing just to sit down at the
[1:33:55] dinner table you can see who's anointed
[1:33:58] is they like that we can see who's
[1:34:01] anointed
[1:34:02] at the dinner tables who's got the
[1:34:06] anointing of the Holy Spirit for
[1:34:07] temperance now that just matches one
[1:34:09] area
[1:34:10] remember all those other ones I listed
[1:34:11] you know sexual temptations and pride
[1:34:13] and division this is just one area one
[1:34:17] one area but we have one anointing that
[1:34:20] covers all the areas let me try to find
[1:34:32] a place to close now I don't have the
[1:34:37] scriptures but I didn't have time to
[1:34:39] look it up you could find them very
[1:34:39] easily God foretold Israel he said
[1:34:43] you're gonna start doing the Promised
[1:34:44] Land he said but when you get full when
[1:34:48] you get rich when you get complacent
[1:34:51] that's when you're gonna get other gods
[1:34:53] to yourself read I just got done with
[1:34:56] Deuteronomy right numbers I think it's a
[1:34:59] new drawing me God told Moses tell those
[1:35:01] people when they get in there once you
[1:35:04] get a lot of money a lot of food and if
[1:35:08] you see if you don't notice if you don't
[1:35:10] exercise temperance that's when idols
[1:35:12] will spring up in Our Lives praise God
[1:35:15] and I can find it if if I try real quick
[1:35:22] here maybe give me a second see if I can
[1:35:24] fold up here I'm just trusting in God's
[1:35:28] grace
[1:35:31] oh yeah here's a warning Deuteronomy
[1:35:42] 8:11 the warning is Deuteronomy 8:11
[1:35:47] beware that they'll forget not the LORD
[1:35:48] thy God and not keeping his commandments
[1:35:51] and his judgments and his statutes which
[1:35:52] I command you this day less when thou
[1:35:54] has eaten an artful and has built God
[1:35:57] goodly houses and dwell therein and when
[1:36:00] I heard thy flocks multiply thy silver
[1:36:02] thy gold is multiplied and all that thou
[1:36:05] hast is multiplied then heart be lifted
[1:36:08] up and now forget the LORD thy God which
[1:36:11] brought thee forth out of the land of
[1:36:13] Egypt from the house of bondage
[1:36:15] hallelujah
[1:36:16] I didn't even know the words I was gonna
[1:36:18] search for so thank the Lord that was a
[1:36:20] warning at the onset a church what about
[1:36:23] us word Laodicea we have access to
[1:36:28] everything we can get credit I could get
[1:36:30] right now then again I got 15 or thirty
[1:36:33] thousand dollars in credit on discover I
[1:36:35] could just go run that up but I gotta
[1:36:37] have temperance on that so we have
[1:36:41] access to almost anything we could
[1:36:44] possibly want proving it's a Leo to see
[1:36:46] an age Amen
[1:36:48] but as October the Amen the zeal of the
[1:36:51] hour is to zealously repent don't give
[1:36:55] God a half-hearted repentance you've got
[1:36:58] a zealous repentance and do your first
[1:37:02] works Oh ain't it works it's all about
[1:37:04] you what you're saying it's all about
[1:37:07] your works you're saved by grace through
[1:37:11] faith
[1:37:11] but then if you've got faith faith works
[1:37:14] by love Amen see so app you're saying
[1:37:18] it's all about your loving works what
[1:37:22] which works are you gonna produce
[1:37:23] whichever one you love the most
[1:37:25] if you love the flesh or who works for
[1:37:28] the flesh if you love the spirit you'll
[1:37:29] do works for the spirit
[1:37:33] what a great warning to us once you get
[1:37:38] enough money that's the time you got to
[1:37:39] be careful great how many can say amen
[1:37:42] to that
[1:37:43] I've been going through that the last
[1:37:45] few years you know God has finally
[1:37:46] helped me pay off all my bills and all
[1:37:48] my debts I got only one left in mortgage
[1:37:50] well sir I got a house loan to
[1:37:52] renovation loan that one's almost paid
[1:37:54] off but I've noticed it too with all the
[1:37:57] extra money I noticed it like I just
[1:37:59] feel better like as far as fleshly
[1:38:02] better like I feel more comfortable and
[1:38:04] I don't like that feeling you me like
[1:38:06] because when your partner like Oh Lord
[1:38:08] you know you're constantly praying how
[1:38:10] am I gonna make ends meet am I gonna pay
[1:38:12] the bill I'll be the hottest Church once
[1:38:16] you get all these bills paid off we got
[1:38:18] to be careful careful not to get
[1:38:21] complacent and then start compromising
[1:38:23] on the word of god what what's gonna
[1:38:27] help you overcome be anointing of
[1:38:28] temperance Lord yoke me yoke me let me
[1:38:33] be let me work with temperance in my
[1:38:36] life so the zeal of the hour is to
[1:38:42] repent you see yourself get a little
[1:38:45] fleshly you know given your flesh too
[1:38:48] much pleasure right
[1:38:50] you got a zealous li repent and say God
[1:38:52] I'm sorry right it's all about your
[1:38:58] motivation
[1:38:59] it's all about your motivation I'd like
[1:39:05] to in a few more things by God's grace
[1:39:10] let's go to first cuttings 9 here

[1:41:31] nine
[1:41:45] so Paul's compares himself he says he's
[1:41:48] a he's a prophet he's a teacher the
[1:41:50] Gentiles he's a messenger from God and
[1:41:53] he compares himself to a runner in the
[1:41:56] Olympics or some Olympic sort of game
[1:42:01] verse 23 and this I do for the Gospels
[1:42:06] sake that I might be partaker thereof
[1:42:07] with you know ye not that they which run
[1:42:10] in a race run all but one receiveth the
[1:42:13] prize so run that ye may obtain how many
[1:42:23] ever ran in a race before did you want
[1:42:27] to win or lose when Paul says run the
[1:42:33] Christian race like you're gonna win
[1:42:36] that means you got to go to every
[1:42:40] lengths to win brother amen without
[1:42:43] cheating but man's gotta play by the
[1:42:45] rules
[1:42:47] there's no shortcuts the temperance amen
[1:42:50] it must be daily acted upon daily habits
[1:43:01] let me read this real quick how many
[1:43:03] know Michael Jordan I just looked up one
[1:43:06] time what was his diet like breakfast
[1:43:10] oatmeal with strawberries blueberries
[1:43:11] and raisin scrambled eggs white glass of
[1:43:14] orange juice wait did I see fruity
[1:43:18] pebbles in there
[1:43:23] this man performed at the highest level
[1:43:26] you could perform look when he fed his
[1:43:29] body lunch chicken breast sandwich or
[1:43:31] lean hamburger just the breast right
[1:43:34] just the burger pasta baked potato small
[1:43:37] green salad did they say Baconator in
[1:43:43] there did I miss them
[1:43:46] dinner whatever he wants so he would be
[1:43:50] real temperate oh but the last one you
[1:43:52] got whatever he was look Paul says you
[1:43:59] need to act and treat your body like
[1:44:02] you're trying to win the race I was a
[1:44:06] state champion I know if you know that
[1:44:07] village honest a champion in the hundred
[1:44:08] meter 200 meter and long Joe in Ohio now
[1:44:13] I could eat whatever I wanted back then
[1:44:15] I could I never competed on the level
[1:44:24] but here's a professional on this level
[1:44:26] and you don't see junk food in here
[1:44:29] right Paul says you need to have the
[1:44:32] attitude like you are a professional
[1:44:34] Runner and run like you're gonna win the
[1:44:41] race praise God
[1:44:45] verse 25 and every man that striveth you
[1:44:49] at the war where the word strive is a
[1:44:51] war striveth for the mastery see you are
[1:44:54] fighting again it's a war against your
[1:44:56] flesh it is an absolute war Paul wasn't
[1:45:03] joking around I know I told some jokes
[1:45:05] at him it's not it's not a joke when it
[1:45:07] comes down to it because it shows
[1:45:09] whether are you take the world's
[1:45:11] anointing or God's anointing you're
[1:45:17] fighting for the mastery is temperate
[1:45:19] and only some things
[1:45:21] oh you're temperate two-thirds of your
[1:45:27] meal every day like Michael Jordan now
[1:45:29] you got your three once a week have your
[1:45:33] splurge you know really that'd be good
[1:45:36] once a week if you'd only Spurs once a
[1:45:37] week how much more healthy would we boot
[1:45:39] you I think I try to do that now there
[1:45:43] was times my wife Bobby let me be honest
[1:45:46] here sometimes I get in the bad habit
[1:45:50] most even to buy an ice cream sandwiches
[1:45:52] I'll have one per night
[1:45:54] it's I'll eat oh I kind of do the
[1:45:56] Michael Jordan one
[1:45:57] Oh eat real healthy you know I gotta
[1:46:00] have something nice something nice you
[1:46:02] know but Alice I haven't had many those
[1:46:05] the last few weeks by God's grace you
[1:46:07] know it goes in you know it's a battle
[1:46:10] it's a battle striving for the mastery
[1:46:14] and church we need to be temperate in
[1:46:16] all things let me look up this is a
[1:46:19] different Greek word I didn't realize
[1:46:21] that temper at all things oh it's a very
[1:46:30] similar work yeah
[1:46:32] self-control continent exhibiting
[1:46:35] self-government conduct oneself temper
[1:46:40] temperately in a figure drawn from
[1:46:42] athletes who in preparing themselves for
[1:46:44] the games abstain from oh unwholesome
[1:46:47] food wine and sexual indulgence food
[1:46:53] wine and sexual indulgence athletes have
[1:46:56] to be very enough to take very good care
[1:46:58] of their bodies right and Paul says you
[1:47:01] and I are running for glory we're
[1:47:03] running away more important race than
[1:47:06] the Olympics that they rescheduled for
[1:47:08] later on who cares who cares and they
[1:47:12] run around like they're half naked
[1:47:13] anyway bunch of heathens that's what
[1:47:15] they are now I love them I pray form you
[1:47:18] know fashion them I'm saying they know
[1:47:21] better right God with the conscience and
[1:47:25] every mod and every person knows better
[1:47:27] than that
[1:47:28] but we're running even a greater race to
[1:47:31] that amen hallelujah the eternal ray
[1:47:35] nice amen
[1:47:36] the hard part is but Johnny I was a
[1:47:38] sprinter but now I'm a distance runner
[1:47:41] I'm talking about the spiritual and I
[1:47:45] didn't like distance at all I still
[1:47:47] don't
[1:47:48] patience is that what huh not my
[1:47:51] favorite thing but God give me grace I
[1:47:54] said like this I have a portion of it by
[1:47:56] God's grace because I've seen it I've
[1:47:59] seen God help me but see we have to run
[1:48:03] up we have to have the mindset
[1:48:04] I'm a distance runner who's patiently
[1:48:08] laying aside
[1:48:10] anything willing to lay it down and run
[1:48:14] the race with patience makes me go run
[1:48:18] right down haven't run for years and
[1:48:22] this is the illustration Paul's trying
[1:48:25] to get the Corinthians and member
[1:48:26] there's many games there's many sports
[1:48:27] events around quorum that was huge on
[1:48:29] sports cuz they worship anything with
[1:48:30] God he said we must be temperate if
[1:48:33] you're gonna fight for that first place
[1:48:35] in everything sighs if you're gonna
[1:48:37] fight to rule and reign with Christ you
[1:48:39] must be temperate in all things not just
[1:48:47] some what you eat right what you say
[1:48:50] what you do all those how you act your
[1:48:56] words its temper and everything but food
[1:48:59] is the most common one we see in America
[1:49:01] we all know it okay it's not like some
[1:49:03] it's not like a fly on the wall I can
[1:49:06] you know we know we're it's it's real to
[1:49:09] us all
[1:49:10] verse 26 therefore so I run not as
[1:49:13] uncertainly and that means punching with
[1:49:15] a blindfold on like you're not you're
[1:49:19] not aimlessly serving Christ right you
[1:49:21] know where you're running he said so
[1:49:23] fight I not as one that beateth here I'm
[1:49:25] sorry that's what that means the beating
[1:49:27] the air uncertainty means with no finish
[1:49:30] line so church we know we're running
[1:49:33] we're running to godliness right we're
[1:49:35] running to a real fruits of the Holy
[1:49:37] Spirit this is where we're running to be
[1:49:39] like Christ to have real fruits of the
[1:49:42] spirit so Paul says that's how I run I
[1:49:47] run to be temperate in all things I know
[1:49:53] Gouri I know where I'm running and I
[1:49:55] know who I'm beating up praise God I
[1:49:58] know I'm fighting and I know where I'm
[1:50:00] going Bray's God Boston where the guys
[1:50:03] are gonna fight the most is yourself and
[1:50:08] I'll tell you one way to do it give her
[1:50:10] a good get yourself a buddy with John
[1:50:12] Graham got in my life and of course my
[1:50:13] wife first she really helped me John
[1:50:15] Graham got my life and he really he
[1:50:17] rubbed me the right way with being more
[1:50:19] temperate and making sure ie to the
[1:50:21] right way and make sure I went to bed
[1:50:23] early
[1:50:24] got up early like you want to be more
[1:50:26] golly talking fellowship with people
[1:50:28] that are godly if you want to if you
[1:50:33] want to run in Olympics should you hang
[1:50:35] around the the harley-davidson
[1:50:37] motorcycle gang no you better get
[1:50:40] yourself a running group right you
[1:50:43] better get up at 6 a.m. and do your
[1:50:44] running every day with your running
[1:50:46] group you want to go in the rapture you
[1:50:48] better get with Holy Ghost field Saints
[1:50:49] amen
[1:50:52] you have to and you have to be
[1:50:54] accountable because listen everybody
[1:50:56] knows your reputation anyway praise God
[1:50:59] so be talk with people and surround
[1:51:03] yourself with people that are into these
[1:51:05] things and it'll lift you up praise God
[1:51:07] cuz you can't do it alone
[1:51:10] don't run uncertainly you don't know
[1:51:13] where you're running you don't know why
[1:51:14] you're starving yourself or robison they
[1:51:16] starving you don't know why you're being
[1:51:18] moderate no you know why you're trying
[1:51:22] to get victory over the flesh you're
[1:51:26] you're not beating the air you're seeing
[1:51:28] your punches have an impact pressure's
[1:51:30] high amen he said when I keep under my
[1:51:34] body and bring it into subjection that
[1:51:37] means beat til it's black and blue
[1:51:40] that's what that word means bruise it he
[1:51:44] said I bruised my body to bring it under
[1:51:47] subjection lest by any means when i have
[1:51:50] preached to others i myself should be a
[1:51:53] castaway see a castaway is a ship that
[1:52:02] sails away in the wrong direction
[1:52:04] someone that's unfit someone who's
[1:52:06] unproved or not approved someone who's
[1:52:09] reprobate and doesn't stand the test
[1:52:11] like that we could even say a sinking
[1:52:13] ship how many want to reach your
[1:52:16] destination I don't want to sink and see
[1:52:19] my testimony go down in the seas of this
[1:52:22] world I don't want to be a castaway
[1:52:24] well how you do it Paul you have to
[1:52:26] bruise and beat your body not physically
[1:52:29] but you have to starve it yep not
[1:52:33] another's deny it bring it into OB
[1:52:37] it's to the Word of God because you
[1:52:39] gotta live like you're the only one
[1:52:40] that's gonna make the rapture they run
[1:52:43] like you're the one who's gonna win the
[1:52:45] prize
[1:52:47] praise God that's glorious I'm closing
[1:52:52] with this yeah I'm going a little bit
[1:52:54] longer today and I appreciate your
[1:52:57] patience with me I'm closing with this I
[1:53:00] you know there was numerous examples as
[1:53:01] I wrote this chapter and I was just
[1:53:03] meditating on it I just thought of these
[1:53:05] simple examples look at the temperance
[1:53:07] Daniel and the three Hebrew children had
[1:53:09] they had every food laid out but the and
[1:53:13] it's proven by the Book of Daniel
[1:53:14] they started not partaking of it and
[1:53:17] they continued not partaking in it and
[1:53:20] when Daniel fast and later on and like
[1:53:22] the Bible said he didn't eat the great
[1:53:25] even the meats he just ate fruits and
[1:53:28] vegetables that's why Rick Warren
[1:53:29] started that Daniel fashion ever heard
[1:53:31] of that the Daniel 5 I never did it I
[1:53:33] never felt like I needed it but if you
[1:53:35] need it that's a good thing to do eat
[1:53:38] eat what gods made eat the foods God has
[1:53:41] given us and be give thanks for them
[1:53:43] praise God Joseph look at Joseph now
[1:53:48] this is a different one Joseph was about
[1:53:50] 27 or 28 can you imagine he's at the
[1:53:53] peak of his sexual desires and
[1:53:57] Potiphar's wife every day now brothers
[1:53:59] think about that every day she's like
[1:54:02] come lay with me here's his schedule now
[1:54:05] look she gonna print it out in that day
[1:54:07] right she could here's my husband's
[1:54:09] schedule look you just saw me here and
[1:54:12] she's begging him every day but look at
[1:54:14] the temperance Joseph had 28 he's in the
[1:54:18] prime of life some of your sisters in
[1:54:20] Rosa you're in the prime of life for
[1:54:22] your passions are the hardest what did
[1:54:24] Joseph have he had temperance praise God
[1:54:27] every day this woman would beg him come
[1:54:30] lay with me and if we we have power we
[1:54:33] can go in this chamber here and nobody
[1:54:36] nobody nobody nobody he's in the very
[1:54:40] height of his passions but he had such
[1:54:42] an anointing of the Holy Spirit I love
[1:54:45] what the Bible says he I love this when
[1:54:48] the devil's trying to get you do
[1:54:49] something ask the devil question
[1:54:51] he says how can I do this great
[1:54:53] wickedness and sin against God as the
[1:55:05] devil that question how can i sin
[1:55:07] against the one who's brought me to
[1:55:08] Egypt to save life and he wasn't even he
[1:55:11] was still in that you're still just a
[1:55:12] slave there but he had such tempers with
[1:55:16] aim and every day oh I know the girl
[1:55:18] just brothers praise God doesn't it we
[1:55:21] could have such an anointing of tempers
[1:55:24] how do you know it's not by my power
[1:55:26] Church it's by the power of the Holy
[1:55:28] Spirit not by my mind not by my power
[1:55:30] but by the power of temperance sayeth
[1:55:33] the Lord amen
[1:55:35] that's how I do it how do you turn on
[1:55:38] those cookies and those brownies by
[1:55:40] God's Spirit I turned on that dr. pepper
[1:55:44] that cigarettes by God's Spirit argue it
[1:55:47] not by my might or power I my flesh was
[1:55:50] freely given but it's by the anointing
[1:55:53] that God has placed upon my life thank
[1:55:57] the Lord last one Philippians ends lets
[1:56:04] go back to Philippians for that just
[1:56:06] can't get out this Philippians here here
[1:56:09] Paul Church as we read this he's been
[1:56:11] serving Jesus Christ for thirty years
[1:56:18] he's been shipwreck lows at three times
[1:56:21] beaten five times 39 stripes each time
[1:56:24] this man has given his body soul and
[1:56:28] mind to Jesus Christ
[1:56:30] after serving Jesus Christ 30 years
[1:56:33] let's look at his temperance here what
[1:56:36] will our lives look like I see it you
[1:56:42] know what some of the Lima Saints like
[1:56:45] let me just give an example
[1:56:46] Marilyn Brown she was in brother Graham
[1:56:49] church we went to a fellowship last year
[1:56:52] and I was just purposely watching her
[1:56:54] kind of life does she live as she would
[1:56:57] laugh and smile you know
[1:56:59] she's precious here she's got that meek
[1:57:03] and quiet my wife and I was just
[1:57:04] that meek and quiet spirit I love it
[1:57:08] praise God but I watch how she was in
[1:57:11] she barely had a little bit they know
[1:57:12] she's a little older of course too I
[1:57:14] just thought what a good example cuz I
[1:57:16] know a lot of old people that don't do
[1:57:17] that we could all point to numerous
[1:57:20] people that are older that they don't
[1:57:22] have much temperance like I told you
[1:57:27] brother Brooks is a great example he's
[1:57:28] 65 I think 64 he still runs four five
[1:57:32] six miles a day because his metabolism
[1:57:34] is really slow and he wants to serve God
[1:57:38] better than he ever has before now
[1:57:41] that's a godly example right there he's
[1:57:44] big-boned he tells me he's like how are
[1:57:46] you so skinny I'm like I was born that
[1:57:47] way he's like I was born this way some
[1:57:51] people are just bigger than others but
[1:57:54] that don't mean you have to let yourself
[1:57:55] go and lose your temperance because you
[1:57:59] can easily get it back from the Lord
[1:58:01] Jesus this is about 64 AD Philippians 4
[1:58:10] right after we just read earlier
[1:58:12] moderation be known to all men verse 10
[1:58:18] but I rejoice in Lord greatly that now
[1:58:21] at your last care of me have flourished
[1:58:23] again wearing to you all
[1:58:24] you were also careful but you lacked
[1:58:27] opportunity but I'm sorry not that I
[1:58:31] speak in a respect of want for I have
[1:58:33] learned look at this after 30 years of
[1:58:37] being robbed beaten shipwrecked I have
[1:58:44] learned what did that what did the Lord
[1:58:45] teach him what kind of temperance did
[1:58:46] God teach remember he just said be
[1:58:48] moderate everybody needs them know your
[1:58:49] moderates I'm sorry your moderation
[1:58:51] rather he learned this whatever state I
[1:58:55] am I am content so if we go to the
[1:59:01] buffet I'm content I'll get a salad
[1:59:03] there if we don't go to the buffet I'm
[1:59:06] content we'll go home and have some eggs
[1:59:08] and cheese then I'm just trying to make
[1:59:12] it real for us right first well I know
[1:59:15] both how to be abased humbled
[1:59:17] know how to abound everywhere and in all
[1:59:21] things look all things again it's always
[1:59:24] all things temper in all things modern
[1:59:26] and all things see preference is a way
[1:59:28] of life it's a way of habit building
[1:59:32] that's that's our word for it but before
[1:59:35] it wasn't habit it was temperance now
[1:59:37] our word is habit it's you have good
[1:59:41] habits everywhere they're everywhere and
[1:59:46] in all things I am instructed both to be
[1:59:48] full and to be hungry and to abound and
[1:59:51] suffer need where's he at right now
[1:59:53] Church he's in the palace did they feed
[1:59:55] him did Romans a Roman prison is known
[1:59:58] for being a picnic like American prisons
[2:00:00] absolutely not
[2:00:01] they were awful conditions beaten
[2:00:04] disease the toilet you know the system
[2:00:08] was awful I mean these do for naught
[2:00:09] this was not a party and then in the
[2:00:13] midst of this he says verse 13 I can do
[2:00:16] all things through Christ which
[2:00:20] strengthens me I can do I can abound or
[2:00:25] I can be humbled I can be hungry I can
[2:00:28] be full and I'll do all of it through
[2:00:30] Christ so this is the context Paul's
[2:00:37] writing at the end of his life two years
[2:00:39] before he died
[2:00:41] what does temperance look like what is
[2:00:43] the fruit of temperance look like looks
[2:00:44] like this you learn amen
[2:00:48] god help us to keep learning amen we
[2:00:51] keep learning we learn from every
[2:00:53] situation God puts us through we learn
[2:00:56] how to serve God with more contentment
[2:00:58] and more self-control if that's what he
[2:01:02] learned I think we're learning the same
[2:01:04] thing because he said everywhere at all
[2:01:06] things
[2:01:14] now he received their gift in verse 17
[2:01:17] not because I desire a gift I love this
[2:01:19] aim and I are talking about this but I
[2:01:21] desire fruit that may abound to your
[2:01:23] account Paul did not like to get gifts
[2:01:28] now most of us like gifts right I like
[2:01:30] this yeah who doesn't like a nice kid
[2:01:32] but Paul said the reason I wanted a gift
[2:01:35] was it because I wanted it myself
[2:01:38] but I wanted people to send me something
[2:01:41] because I know God will reward them in
[2:01:44] heaven a church how many of us think
[2:01:48] about this how many of us believe would
[2:01:50] be willing to go to jail lack food just
[2:01:56] so other Christians can visit us or give
[2:01:59] us food so that they'll have a reward in
[2:02:01] heaven
[2:02:02] in other words who wants to go through
[2:02:04] hard trials so that someone has to give
[2:02:07] you something but what do we like we
[2:02:09] like being a controlled everything we
[2:02:11] like I know Idina like being control I
[2:02:13] could be like everything's going my way
[2:02:14] I've got Paul said I'm okay I'm okay
[2:02:18] we're never say that God puts me in I'm
[2:02:21] okay because I can do all things through
[2:02:23] Christ who strengthens me and God has
[2:02:28] allowed me to come in prison so that
[2:02:29] other people can get heavenly rewards
[2:02:33] you know maybe said many times sure I
[2:02:35] think that's why older people get in the
[2:02:36] hospital get diseases so other people
[2:02:38] can Christians can come and pray for
[2:02:40] them when I was sick you came and
[2:02:45] visited me a lot of Christians in the
[2:02:50] message going they get sick right just
[2:02:52] it's the end of their end of their life
[2:02:54] and somebody goes to visit them or
[2:02:58] someone goes to pray for them Paul says
[2:03:04] this is what that's why I got a gift
[2:03:06] that's why I wanted to give not because
[2:03:08] I wanted it but because I know God has
[2:03:11] put me in prison to further the gospel
[2:03:13] and to give other people a chance to
[2:03:16] earn a heavenly reward because when they
[2:03:18] give to me they're really not given to
[2:03:20] me they're given to Christ
[2:03:25] verse 18 but I have all and abound I am
[2:03:30] full having receipt of a preferred itis
[2:03:33] the things which were set from you and
[2:03:35] odor of sweet smell a sacrifice
[2:03:37] acceptable well pleasing to God but my
[2:03:40] God shall supply all your need according
[2:03:43] to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus

[2:04:27] is the whole purpose of the plant right
[2:04:29] we want things to come to fruition right
[2:04:31] our lives come to fruition when we can
[2:04:34] we can laugh things but yet we're still
[2:04:36] content we can be gentle even when
[2:04:40] people are harsh we can love even when

[2:06:39] moderation
[2:06:40] John was known to be fasting all the
[2:06:43] context Jesus was known to be eating
[2:06:45] over time but he said after I go go fast
[2:06:49] then see every group is known by what
