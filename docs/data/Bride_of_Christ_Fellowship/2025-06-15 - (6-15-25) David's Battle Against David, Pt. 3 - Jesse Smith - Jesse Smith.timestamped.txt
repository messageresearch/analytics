[0:00] The Bible said, "The worship of the Lord
[0:01] is calmly. It's beautiful. It's
[0:02] peaceful." Hallelujah.
[0:04] Hallelujah. We've been looking at this
[0:06] thought here the last few uh services. I
[0:08] think I maybe I can finish it today.
[0:09] Maybe not. Might have to go another uh
[0:12] sermon on this topic here by God's
[0:13] grace. But I'd like to look at uh
[0:18] this thought again of David's battle. He
[0:20] was battling the iniquity inside of him.
[0:23] He was battling the sin nature inside of
[0:24] him. That was his biggest enemy was
[0:26] himself. Hallelujah.
[0:29] Uh so let's read that here. Uh by God's
[0:32] grace just writing down a thought I had
[0:34] while I was praying. Okay, let's read
[0:36] that if we can. 1 2 3. For innumerable
[0:39] evils have compassed me about. Mine
[0:42] iniquities have taken hold upon me so
[0:46] that I am not able to look up. They are
[0:49] more than the hairs of mine head.
[0:52] Therefore my heart faileth me. Let's
[0:55] have a word of prayer. If you have a
[0:56] need on your heart, let's make it known
[0:58] unto God today. Father God, we thank you
[1:00] for today. Lord, you are a good, good
[1:02] father. Lord, we don't even have the
[1:04] words to really explain how awesome and
[1:06] how good you are. Lord, you're called
[1:08] heavenly father. You're called full of
[1:11] compassion. You're called rich in mercy.
[1:13] Lord, how can we even understand it?
[1:14] Lord, we can't always understand it, but
[1:16] we do believe it. Lord God, we're so
[1:18] thankful. We've seen your hand of mercy
[1:20] in our lives just time and time again,
[1:22] countless times extend to us. We want to
[1:24] thank you for being such a faithful
[1:26] father, Lord. Lord, maybe some of us had
[1:28] faithful fathers and we rejoice in that
[1:30] today. Some of us maybe didn't, Lord
[1:32] God. So Lord, may each one of us though
[1:34] recognize the amazing work of our
[1:36] heavenly father today, Lord God, and be
[1:38] grateful and give you thanks and praise
[1:40] in your house. For this is the house of
[1:42] God. This is the house of prayer, Lord.
[1:44] And we came out this morning to give you
[1:46] the glory and give you the thanks for
[1:49] all the blessings you've been swed upon
[1:50] us, Lord God. The greatest being that
[1:53] you've forgiven all of our sins, Lord
[1:55] God, which David said are like the
[1:57] number of the hairs of mine head. So,
[2:00] Father, we give you the glory and honor
[2:02] and praise today. We worship you in the
[2:04] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. May you
[2:06] meet all the needs and the church said,
[2:08] "Amen." God bless you as you're being
[2:09] seated. Praise God. God is good.
[2:12] Hallelujah. So, I want to just uh pick
[2:15] up kind of where we left off on
[2:16] Wednesday. We've been looking at uh
[2:18] David battle against himself. Uh we know
[2:21] Paul said the same thing. Paul said,
[2:23] "When I want to do good, evil's right
[2:24] there with me." He said, "And sometimes
[2:26] I do what I hate instead of what I know
[2:29] is right." He said, "Oh, wretched man
[2:32] that I am." He said, "But thanks be to
[2:33] God who gives us the victory through our
[2:35] Lord Jesus Christ." Hallelujah. And the
[2:37] very next verse, he says, "There is now
[2:39] therefore no condemnation to them that
[2:42] are in Christ Jesus." Amen. Who walk
[2:45] after the spirit and not after the
[2:47] flesh. Church, you've come to the house
[2:48] of God. Let's believe God's word. Let's
[2:51] walk after the spirit. Praise God.
[2:52] Hallelujah. Because there's no
[2:54] condemnation to them that are in Christ.
[2:56] Hallelujah. How do you know you're in
[2:57] Christ? Because Christ is in you. Amen.
[3:00] Hallelujah. That's right. Hallelujah.
[3:02] His spirit is poured out. The Bible
[3:04] said, uh, the love of God is poured
[3:06] abundantly into your hearts by the Holy
[3:08] Ghost. Hallelujah. So, we're thankful
[3:10] for God's grace today. I want to, uh,
[3:12] look at again David's life here. Now, I
[3:14] want to go to Psalm three. Uh, I'm
[3:16] sorry, Psalm 7:3, pardon me.
[3:19] Psalm 7:3. I want to read a few verses
[3:22] in here. I want to look at this here
[3:25] about I love how David was so honest. We
[3:28] know at least one time he hid his sins,
[3:30] right? He hid uh the murder and
[3:32] adultery. We know he he hid that. But
[3:34] many times we know David did not hide
[3:36] his sin. God, he would just go confess
[3:38] it to God. Hallelujah. Psalm 7:3. Oh
[3:42] Lord my God, if I have done this, if
[3:44] there be iniquity in my hands, if I have
[3:47] rewarded evil unto him that was at peace
[3:49] with me, yay, I have delivered him that
[3:52] without cause is my enemy. Let the enemy
[3:56] persecute my soul and take it. Yay, let
[3:58] him tread down my life upon the earth
[4:00] and lay mine honor in the dust. Sila. So
[4:04] I like what David David's saying, if I
[4:06] did wrong, Lord, I'll suffer the
[4:08] consequences. Hallelujah.
[4:11] Right? I love that because he was
[4:12] willing to be honest. If if if I need a
[4:15] spanking, I'll take it. Right? If I need
[4:18] chasing the Lord, then Lord, you do what
[4:19] you have to do. But also the other
[4:21] side's true. Lord, if I haven't done
[4:23] wrong, then deliver me from my enemies.
[4:25] Hallelujah. Amen. Now go down to verse
[4:28] eight. The Lord shall judge the people.
[4:30] Judge me, oh Lord, according to my
[4:33] righteousness. Here's the other side.
[4:34] Lord, if I haven't done wrong, then you
[4:36] be my judge between my enemies and me.
[4:39] according to mine integrity that is in
[4:42] me. Integrity is doing what's right.
[4:45] Hallelujah. Whether anyone's watching or
[4:47] not. Hallelujah. Oh, let the wickedness
[4:50] of the wicked come to an end. In other
[4:52] words, let the season end where I'm
[4:54] going through persecution and trials and
[4:56] all these things, but establish the
[4:58] just, for the righteousness of God tryth
[5:01] the hearts and the reign. So David knew
[5:04] my battles come to try me, to test me,
[5:07] to make me more like Christ. Hallelujah.
[5:10] Verse 10. My defense is of God.
[5:13] Hallelujah. Which saveth the upright in
[5:16] heart. So David knows if I'm guilty,
[5:18] I'll suffer it. But if not, Lord, you're
[5:21] my shield. Fight my battles. Give me the
[5:23] victory. Let me know there's victory
[5:25] ahead. Hallelujah. Amen. Glory.
[5:29] And I love what David says here uh in
[5:31] Psalm 32:1 and two. A psalm of David
[5:35] Mazill. He said, "Blessed is he whose
[5:38] transgression is forgiven, whose sin is
[5:40] covered. Blessed is the man unto whom
[5:43] the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in
[5:46] whose spirit there is no guile." God
[5:49] doesn't like pretenders.
[5:51] God doesn't like people who hide sin.
[5:54] Right? God God will fight against that.
[5:57] But if you humble yourself and
[5:58] acknowledge your sin, then God will
[6:00] forgive you and God will bless you for
[6:02] that. Hallelujah. Blessed is the man.
[6:05] See, in other words, just be honest
[6:07] about your sins. Hallelujah. And God
[6:10] will bless and forgive you and keep you
[6:12] on the path of righteousness.
[6:15] Now, let's let's look at what David said
[6:17] right after he was uh caught in murder
[6:19] and adultery. Let's go back to Psalm 51
[6:21] for a moment. Let's review that. Psalm
[6:23] 51:1 to the chief musician of Psalm of
[6:26] David. When Nathan the prophet came unto
[6:28] him, after he had gone into Basheba,
[6:32] have mercy on me, oh God, according to
[6:34] thy loving kindness, according to the
[6:36] multitude of thy tender mercies, blot
[6:38] out my transgressions.
[6:42] So imagine being guilty of murder.
[6:44] Imagine being guilty of adultery. What's
[6:47] the first plea from a guilty person?
[6:49] Lord, I'm trusting in your loving
[6:51] kindness. Amen. You have to look outside
[6:54] yourself. You can't get redemption
[6:56] inside of yourself. You've got to look
[6:58] somebody. You got to look to somebody
[6:59] who has the power to redeem. Amen. And
[7:03] what's the power? It's the love of God.
[7:05] Hallelujah. That's why we sang that thy
[7:07] loving kindness is better than life.
[7:10] David says this on numerous occasions.
[7:12] The very first thing you have to appeal
[7:14] to is the love of God.
[7:17] Hallelujah.
[7:19] I wonder, let's read this and see if he
[7:21] ever rebukes Nathan for pointing out his
[7:22] sin. Let's see that. Sometimes we get
[7:24] mad if somebody points out of our sin.
[7:26] David didn't do that. Hallelujah.
[7:30] Now, it all depends on the spirit that
[7:32] they bring it in. But I want you to see
[7:33] here. Does he ever bring up Nathan? No.
[7:35] Nathan was God's tool to bring him back
[7:38] to himself, to bring him back to living
[7:41] in integrity. There it is. Amen.
[7:43] Hallelujah. You got to look at that. God
[7:44] uses people in your life to bring you
[7:46] back to the state of integrity. Amen.
[7:48] Because God doesn't want you to pretend.
[7:50] God wants you to be you. Hallelujah. God
[7:52] wants you to be who he made you to be.
[7:55] Amen. Verse two, wash me thorly from my
[8:00] iniquity and cleanse me from sin. In
[8:02] other words, it's not going to it's not
[8:03] just a simple prayer. God, forgive me of
[8:05] my iniquity. You got to say, God, I
[8:07] really need I really want to die out to
[8:09] be forgiven. Amen. Wash me thoroughly.
[8:11] Anybody ever had a really bad stain in
[8:13] your clothes? It just won't come out.
[8:15] You can't do it was with one wash. Now,
[8:17] some I spilled I think I spilled pizza
[8:19] sauce on these a few weeks ago. I just
[8:21] put a little water on there and they're
[8:22] gone. Well, I was lucky. I'll say like
[8:24] that. I was fortunate. But there's some
[8:27] there's some stains you can't do that.
[8:30] It's going to take further washing. My
[8:32] wife says sometimes you got to put chalk
[8:33] on it and stuff like that. Sometimes you
[8:35] got to put extra soap on there. Maybe
[8:36] it's got to be cold water or something
[8:38] like that. There's special instructions.
[8:40] And David said it's going to take more
[8:42] than just a superficial prayer. It's
[8:44] going to take a dying out to self.
[8:46] Hallelujah. Amen. Uh-huh. Wash me thorly
[8:50] for my iniquity. Remember, what is
[8:52] iniquity? It's wickedness or lawlessness
[8:54] when you already know it's wrong.
[8:57] Hallelujah.
[8:59] And David said, remember I went back to
[9:00] that scripture. Everybody touch your
[9:01] hair one time. David said, "Mine
[9:03] iniquities are like the hairs of mine
[9:06] head." Everybody averages about a
[9:07] 100,000 hairs right now. That's a lot of
[9:10] sin. But David said, "God, you can take
[9:13] all that away if I just if I just let
[9:16] you wash me thoroughly." Praise God.
[9:18] Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. And
[9:21] doesn't the Bible say Jesus knows every
[9:23] one of the numbers of your hairs of your
[9:26] head? Amen. And that was in I care for
[9:28] you. That's in the context of I care for
[9:31] you. I know all the hairs of your head.
[9:33] In other words, and the same is true for
[9:34] the other side. I know all your sins,
[9:36] but I'm still faithful to wash them.
[9:38] Hallelujah. Amen. Because I'm greater
[9:41] than your sin. Hallelujah. My love, my
[9:44] innocence, my purity, my precious holy
[9:47] blood of my son is greater than your
[9:50] sins. Hallelujah.
[9:52] Amen. Thank God. Verse three. For I
[9:55] acknowledge my transgression, and my sin
[9:58] is ever before me.
[10:01] Against thee. Thee only have I sinned
[10:03] and done this evil in thy sight, that
[10:04] thou mightest be justified when thou
[10:06] speakest, and be clear when thou judge.
[10:09] See, this is how you get forgiven by
[10:11] God. You justify God. You you declare
[10:14] how great God is and you sh you say and
[10:16] share how wicked you are.
[10:20] Verse five, behold, now look, I like I
[10:22] like what David, he goes back to this.
[10:23] He said, God, thank you for your loving
[10:25] kindness. Wash me thoroughly, but Lord,
[10:27] I was shapen in iniquity.
[10:30] In other words, I have a sin element in
[10:32] my members. I have a sin nature that's
[10:35] built into me. and in sin did my mother
[10:39] conceive me. In other words, the sin
[10:40] nature of my parents passed unto me.
[10:44] Right? We saw with Abraham and Isaac.
[10:46] What was Abraham's main sin? Lying. It
[10:48] passed right into Isaac. Isaac lied
[10:50] about his wife as well. Hallelujah. So,
[10:53] a lot of the sins of our parents come
[10:54] down to us. But that doesn't mean we
[10:56] just accept them. We say, "God, wash me
[10:59] thy." Praise God. Wash me thoroughly
[11:02] from my sin. Don't let me have a
[11:04] superficial pretending Christianity. Let
[11:07] me have no guile. Let me have integrity.
[11:09] Let me be clean before you. I confess my
[11:12] sin. I acknowledge my sin. And you are
[11:14] faithful to forgive me of my sins. Amen.
[11:17] Glory. Verse six. Behold, thou desires.
[11:20] What does God desire? He just desires
[11:22] truth in your heart. That's all he
[11:25] desires. Just be true. Just tell the
[11:27] truth.
[11:29] And in the hidden part, thou shalt make
[11:31] me to know wisdom. So see, once you can
[11:33] confess all your sins and be true to
[11:35] God, then God will give you wisdom.
[11:39] Purge me with hissup and I shall be
[11:41] clean. Remember, hissup was a common
[11:43] weed. Brother calls that common faith.
[11:45] In other words, you can have common
[11:46] faith. If I confess my sins, then I know
[11:48] God's going to forgive me. It's very
[11:50] common. God is faithful to forgive. God
[11:53] is pleased. God is willing very easily
[11:56] to pardon our sins if we'll tell the
[11:58] truth. Amen. Glory.
[12:03] Wash me and I'll be whiter than snow.
[12:06] Hallelujah.
[12:07] Verse eight. Make me to hear joy and
[12:10] gladness that the bones which thou hast
[12:12] broken may rejoice.
[12:14] Sometimes God has to break our bones.
[12:17] Sometimes God has to break our hearts.
[12:19] Hallelujah. In order to humble us.
[12:22] Hallelujah. Whoever the Lord loves that
[12:25] he chastens.
[12:26] Hallelujah. Now I like verse nine. Hide
[12:29] thy face from my sins and blot out all
[12:33] my iniquities.
[12:36] Hallelujah. Every single one of them.
[12:38] Blot them all out. I'm here, Lord. I'm
[12:40] confessing my sin. Blot. Take everyone
[12:43] away. Make me whiter than snow. Amen.
[12:47] Verse 10. Create in me a clean heart, oh
[12:50] God, and renew a right spirit within me.
[12:52] Sometimes I don't think we really
[12:54] understand when we when we hear that
[12:55] song played over here, how we love it.
[12:57] But I sometimes we we don't understand
[12:59] that what that song's really about.
[13:01] Amen. Take away my murderous heart.
[13:04] Amen. Take away my adulterous heart.
[13:07] Amen. And give me a a clean spirit.
[13:10] Amen. Give me a heart that wants the
[13:12] best for my enemy. That wants the right
[13:14] attitude towards men or women. Give me
[13:17] that kind of heart. That's what I need.
[13:18] And don't take your spirit from me. Let
[13:20] the spirit stay upon me. Hallelujah.
[13:23] Glory.
[13:26] Prayer from a murderer, an adulterer
[13:29] created me a clean heart. I'll say like
[13:32] this. Is anything too hard for God?
[13:34] Amen. No. Nothing's too hard for God. So
[13:37] God can create a clean heart.
[13:39] Hallelujah. God will restore the joy of
[13:43] your salvation. Hallelujah.
[13:46] Glory to God. Verse 11. Cast me not away
[13:50] from thy presence and take not thy holy
[13:53] spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy
[13:55] of thy salvation, and uphold me with thy
[13:59] free spirit. Then will I teach
[14:02] transgressors thy way. See, then you can
[14:04] help somebody else when you know you're
[14:05] forgiven. Amen. Hallelujah. That's
[14:08] right. And sinners shall be converted to
[14:11] thee. Somebody's going to get saved if
[14:12] you get forgiven. Amen. Hallelujah. If
[14:15] you accept God's grace, then God will
[14:17] allow you to be used to save somebody
[14:20] else. Hallelujah.
[14:22] Glory. Go to Psalm 65:1. I'm going to
[14:25] stop there as far as that chapter. Psalm
[14:28] 65:1. I got a ways to go, but I'm not
[14:30] going to get there. To the chief
[14:32] musician, a psalm and song of David,
[14:34] praise waited for thee, oh God in Zion.
[14:37] Is that how you felt today? When you
[14:39] were at home, do you say, "God, I got a
[14:40] song I'm going to sing. I can't wait to
[14:42] get to your house. I'm going to praise
[14:43] you when I get there." That's how David
[14:46] thought, "I can't wait, Lord. I got to
[14:48] worship. I've got a song special when I
[14:50] get to your house. I thought I'd sing
[14:53] one to my heavenly father today.
[14:55] Hallelujah. Cuz I read this this
[14:56] morning. Glory. He says, "Praise waits
[15:00] for you, oh God, and unto thee shall be
[15:03] the vow be performed. I'll keep my
[15:05] promises."
[15:06] Oh, thou that hearest prayer, unto thee
[15:09] shall all flesh come. Go down to verse
[15:10] three. Iniquities prevailed against me.
[15:13] As for our transgressions, thou shalt
[15:16] purge them away. So, I want you to see
[15:19] verse three. See, church, when you do a
[15:21] sin you know is wrong. What happened is
[15:22] you lost the battle.
[15:25] You gave into the spirits you lost. You
[15:27] you set down you set down your your
[15:29] shield. You set down your sword and you
[15:31] let the enemy wound you.
[15:34] You were prevailed against. You lost.
[15:37] But you don't have to stay a loser.
[15:39] Amen. That's the beauty of Christianity.
[15:41] David didn't have to stay a loser to
[15:44] murder and adultery. He could overcome.
[15:46] and say, "God, help me to pick up the
[15:48] joy of my salvation. Help me to pick up
[15:50] the helmet of salvation and put it back
[15:52] on, and I'll never do it again." Amen.
[15:56] Hallelujah. So, we got to admit, oh, the
[15:59] flesh prevailed against me, or I gave
[16:01] into the enemy, but he doesn't have to
[16:03] prevail anymore. Hallelujah.
[16:06] God is my uh defense. God is my
[16:09] fortress. Hallelujah. That's right. I
[16:12] love verse four. Verse verse four speaks
[16:14] of predestination.
[16:16] Blessed is the man whom thou chooses.
[16:20] Amen.
[16:22] And causes to approach unto thee. I
[16:25] didn't go choosing God. God chose me.
[16:28] Amen. Uhhuh. I wasn't looking for God.
[16:31] God came looking for me. Amen. And it
[16:35] wasn't my great holiness that made me
[16:37] want to come to church. It was God that
[16:38] brought me to church. Amen. Amen. Just
[16:41] like Lot, the angels had to pull him out
[16:43] of Sodom. Same thing for all of us. The
[16:46] Bible said God chose us and then he
[16:48] caused us to come to the house of God.
[16:50] He's the great shepherd. He left the 99
[16:53] to go get the one. Amen.
[16:56] Oh yes, sir.
[17:00] That he may dwell where? In thy courts,
[17:03] the house of God. Church, we don't
[17:05] really understand how blessed we are to
[17:07] be in the church.
[17:09] You could be a lot of other places, a
[17:10] lot of low, dirty, dark places, but
[17:13] today you're in the house of the
[17:15] heavenly father. Amen. Why? Because he
[17:18] chose me. He invited me. It's just like
[17:20] the Shulamite and Solomon. Solomon's out
[17:23] there on his charity. He's not married.
[17:24] He's a single man. You know, he's an
[17:25] outstanding great man. And he sees down
[17:27] a little uh shepherd girl. And she said,
[17:30] "Oh, I'm just black and calmly. Who am
[17:32] I? My my uh my my family sent me out
[17:34] here with the shepherds." Something
[17:36] caught his eye. I see something
[17:38] beautiful there. She doesn't see it in
[17:40] herself, but I see it in her. That's
[17:42] what Christ saw in you. Amen. You were
[17:45] nothing to yourself. You were just
[17:46] forgotten. Nobody special. But God saw
[17:49] his love in you. Praise God. He saw
[17:52] something he learned. And then Solomon
[17:54] invites her. Come, my darling. Come.
[17:56] We're going to get you cleaned out for a
[17:58] year. We're going to go all through
[17:59] these processes just like Esther. And
[18:01] then you're going to be mine. You're
[18:03] going to be my bride. I'm choosing you.
[18:06] I'm causing you to come to the temple.
[18:08] Hallelujah. That's what Jesus did for
[18:11] us. He's calling us to the new
[18:12] Jerusalem. Hallelujah.
[18:16] Oh my. Glory to God.
[18:20] I didn't earn it. If I can quote the
[18:22] song, I don't deserve it. Still, he
[18:24] gives himself away.
[18:26] Oh, the precious love of God. Verse
[18:29] five. By terrible things in
[18:31] righteousness will thou answer us, oh
[18:32] God, of our salvation. Who art the
[18:35] confidence of all the earth of the uh
[18:37] I'm sorry. Yeah, confidence of all the
[18:38] earth. Praise God. I might have had a
[18:40] mistype on my copy and paste here.
[18:44] Now, let's go to Psalm 66:17. When I did
[18:47] church on Thursday and Friday when I
[18:48] studied, I went through every time the
[18:50] word iniquity was used in Psalm to see
[18:52] how did David use all the word iniquity
[18:54] all throughout his life, all the songs
[18:57] that he wrote. It'd be like going
[18:58] through all of Austin's songs and
[19:00] saying, "How did Austin use iniquity?
[19:02] How did
[19:03] or all Haven's poems?" Haven's got like
[19:05] three books of poems. Where's Haven?
[19:07] There she is. And if I had a word
[19:10] search, it'd be like that. I'll type in
[19:11] a computer. Uh, let me look up little
[19:13] Lee in Haven's uh poems. That's our
[19:16] chicken that we love.
[19:18] But that's kind of what I did. I just
[19:20] How would a man who is after the heart
[19:22] of God, how would he talk about his
[19:24] iniquity?
[19:26] He would confess his iniquity. That's
[19:28] what David did.
[19:31] Psalm 66:E1 17, I cried unto him with my
[19:36] mouth. You got to say something. God
[19:37] wants you to hear you say it. And he was
[19:40] extolled with my tongue. If I regard
[19:43] iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not
[19:46] hear me. See, that's how you know your
[19:48] prayers are not going to be answered if
[19:50] you don't confess your iniquity. But if
[19:52] you just confess it, then you've got
[19:54] confidence he's going to hear my prayer.
[19:57] I may have to wait till next week or
[19:59] next month or next year or the next
[20:02] decade. But it doesn't matter because
[20:04] I'm waiting on the Lord and he'll renew
[20:06] my strength like the eagle.
[20:09] But we know for sure David knew God's
[20:12] not going to hear me if I keep iniquity
[20:15] in my heart. Why you hiding it? Just get
[20:17] rid of it. Let's not be aching. Let's
[20:19] not hide it. Let's confess it. Praise
[20:20] God. Amen. Hallelujah. Let's bring
[20:23] blessing upon our house. Amen. Achan
[20:26] brought curses on his house. Let's not
[20:27] bring curses. Let's expose the evil.
[20:30] Let's tell God about it. And he's
[20:31] faithful to and just to forgive us of
[20:34] all iniquity.
[20:36] That's right.
[20:40] Now, Psalm 78:37, Psalms 387, I'm sorry,
[20:44] Psalm 78:37, pardon me. for their heart
[20:47] was not right with him. Speaking of
[20:49] Israel out in the wilderness, neither
[20:51] were they steadfast in his covenant.
[20:53] See, church, there's something to be
[20:54] said for faithfulness. God wants us
[20:57] steadfast.
[20:59] Just stay with it. Don't give up. Don't
[21:02] quit. Just stay with it. Be faithful.
[21:04] Hallelujah. Amen. That's right. Verse
[21:07] 38.
[21:09] But he So God's looking at Israel.
[21:11] Remember, most of them sinned 10 times
[21:13] in the wilderness and then God shut all
[21:15] that were 20 and older. God shut them
[21:17] out of the promised land except Joshua
[21:18] and Caleb. He put up with all their
[21:21] complaining, all their tempting, all
[21:23] their idolatry. He put up with it most
[21:25] of it for a point and they said that's
[21:27] it, right? But what did God do? Even
[21:31] verse 38, but he being full of
[21:33] compassion.
[21:36] Hallelujah. Forgave their iniquity.
[21:39] Church, you got to understand that when
[21:41] you're confessing your sin, God is just
[21:43] full of compassion. And church, he never
[21:45] changes. That means he can't lose any
[21:46] compassion. Amen. He can't lose any
[21:49] love. If he express love to you, he
[21:51] doesn't lose love. He still got it.
[21:53] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. He's a unceasing
[21:57] fountain flowing with compassion and
[22:00] love and mercy and truth and grace. It's
[22:04] freely flowing out. And we just have to
[22:07] acknowledge our sin. And that love will
[22:09] flow unto us.
[22:12] Oh my. He's full of it. Full of
[22:14] compassion. And he forgave their
[22:16] iniquity and destroy them not.
[22:20] Hallelujah.
[22:23] Yay. Many a time turned he his anger
[22:25] away, and did not stir up all of his
[22:28] wrath. For what did God remember? That
[22:31] they were just flesh. A wind that passes
[22:35] away and cometh not again. And isn't
[22:36] that what the book of James says? Lord,
[22:39] uh, remind us that we're just like a
[22:41] flower. Today it's here. Tomorrow it's
[22:43] gone. How many little beautiful flowers
[22:45] have we enjoyed these last few months?
[22:47] Well, where are they now? They're gone.
[22:49] That's what your life is. So, let's use
[22:51] this life for the glory of God. Amen.
[22:54] Let's remember he's full of compassion.
[22:57] Hallelujah.
[23:04] Psalm 85:1. To the chief musician, a
[23:06] psalm for the sons of Kora. Lord, thou
[23:09] has been favorable unto thy land. Thou
[23:11] has brought back the captivity of Jacob.
[23:13] Thou has forgiven the iniquity of thy
[23:16] people. Thou has covered all their sin.
[23:19] Silah.
[23:21] So think about that. All the 10 sins of
[23:23] the whole community. And then all the
[23:24] sins down in Egypt, God looked at that
[23:27] and he forgave that by the blood of
[23:29] bulls and goats. And we have better
[23:31] blood than the blood of bulls and goats.
[23:34] Amen. We the life of the bull and goat
[23:36] could not come upon the believer, but
[23:38] the life of Christ can come upon you and
[23:40] I. Hallelujah.
[23:42] And then the Bible said we have can have
[23:44] no more conscience for sin.
[23:47] In other words, you'll start living so
[23:48] close to God, you don't even remember
[23:50] you did some of those things. May God
[23:52] help us to have somebody to have that
[23:54] today. Praise God. You you believe God's
[23:56] promises so much you that the devil
[23:58] can't even remind you. Amen. Amen.
[24:00] Because the spirit of God has so
[24:02] cleansed your conscience that you know
[24:04] you're a child of God and you've got a
[24:06] faithful heavenly father who's covered
[24:08] all your sins and he's full of
[24:10] compassion. Amen. He chose me and he
[24:14] called me to come worship him in his
[24:16] house. Amen.
[24:21] Glory.
[24:25] Now, if you would put up uh Romans 4:16.
[24:28] I don't want to forget this. I mentioned
[24:30] this at the end of last Sunday's
[24:32] service. I just thought as I was
[24:33] preparing, I better read that one
[24:35] because I mentioned it. I wanted wanted
[24:36] everybody to catch this here.
[24:41] 4:16.
[24:48] Now before you go to before we read 16,
[24:50] go back to verse five.
[24:53] But to him that workketh not, but
[24:54] believeth on him that justifith the
[24:56] ungodly, his faith is counted for
[24:57] righteousness. Even as David also
[25:00] described the blessedness of the man,
[25:01] unto whom God imputth righteousness
[25:03] without works. See, God makes you
[25:06] righteous without you doing anything.
[25:09] All you have to do is confess your sins.
[25:11] Brother said, all you have to do is meet
[25:12] the conditions of the Bible. If you meet
[25:15] God's conditions, he'll forgive you.
[25:17] Amen. And what's the con what's the
[25:19] condition? Repent
[25:21] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[25:24] Christ for the remission of sins and ye
[25:27] shall receive the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[25:30] That's right. Without works.
[25:33] Verse seven, saying, "Blessed are they
[25:35] whose iniquities are forgiven and whose
[25:37] sins are covered. Blessed is the man to
[25:40] whom the Lord will not impute sin."
[25:44] Think of the thousands of sins in
[25:45] David's life and our life. And brother
[25:47] Ram even talked about it as well. We'll
[25:48] read that soon. All the thousands of
[25:51] sins. And yet God will not impute one of
[25:53] them to you. Church, it's a clean slate.
[25:57] If there ever was a clean slate, it's a
[25:59] clean slate from God Almighty.
[26:01] Hallelujah.
[26:03] That's how much he forgives us.
[26:07] Now the Bible says this is not only to
[26:09] Abraham because in verse 9 and 10 11 he
[26:12] talks about was this just on the
[26:13] circumcision or unc uncircumcision. He
[26:16] says it's on both.
[26:19] Let let's go to verse 13. For the
[26:20] promise that he should be the heir of
[26:21] the world was not to Abraham or to his
[26:23] seed through the law but through the
[26:24] righteousness of faith.
[26:27] Verse 16. Therefore, if is if it is a
[26:29] faith, then it might be by grace to the
[26:32] end the promise might be sure to all the
[26:35] seed.
[26:37] Hallelujah. Amen. If God forgave
[26:40] Abraham, then God was going to forgive
[26:42] all of Abraham's seed. That's a promise.
[26:47] It'd be like you if you had billions of
[26:48] dollars. Well, and you and before you
[26:50] died, you said, "Okay, this is going to
[26:51] my seed and then and my children, then
[26:53] my grandchildren all the way down. It's
[26:55] in writing. It's my will. everybody's
[26:57] going to get it. Well, God does better
[26:59] than that. He knows money doesn't
[27:01] satisfy. So, he said, "I'll give you
[27:03] forgiveness." Hallelujah. I'll give
[27:05] forgiveness to every generation, every
[27:08] generation of Abraham's seed. And it's
[27:10] sure. It's a sure thing. You can't
[27:13] question it. You can't doubt it.
[27:15] Forgiveness for all iniquity is given
[27:17] freely to all of Abraham's seed.
[27:22] Thank God. Thank God. Hallelujah.
[27:25] It's sure,
[27:27] church. Tomorrow's not sure.
[27:30] Brother said that many times. Anybody
[27:32] could die tonight, could die tomorrow.
[27:33] We're not even tomorrow is sure, but
[27:35] forgiveness is sure.
[27:38] I'm going to have forgiveness tomorrow,
[27:40] brother Nia.
[27:41] It's sure to all the seed. And I'm a
[27:45] seed child of Abraham through faith in
[27:48] Jesus Christ, my Lord. Amen.
[27:51] Hallelujah.
[27:53] Oh my. Glory to God.
[27:56] So I just want you to see that it's God
[27:58] forgave all their iniquity and he'll do
[28:01] the same for the Gentiles and it's sure
[28:03] it's a sure thing to Abraham's seed.
[28:08] All you have to do is confess your sin.
[28:11] Hallelujah.
[28:13] That's right, church. Psalm 103 is one
[28:16] of the most beautiful psalms I've ever
[28:18] read. Verse one, a psalm of David. Bless
[28:20] the Lord, oh my soul, and all them that
[28:23] and all that is within me, bless his
[28:25] holy name. Church, when was the last
[28:27] time you left this church and you said,
[28:28] "I blessed God with everything I had."
[28:31] Or do you save some for Wednesday?
[28:34] We need some times where we give God
[28:36] everything we had. A lot of times I walk
[28:38] out of here, especially on a Wednesday
[28:40] night, I'll walk out of there and say,
[28:41] "I know I gave everything I had. That's
[28:42] all I got. I'm going to try not to
[28:44] collapse on the drive home."
[28:47] Right? That's what David said. I gave
[28:50] him everything in the house of God. When
[28:52] I start sweating, I know I'm brothers,
[28:53] I'm getting pretty close to giving
[28:54] everything I got here, right? All that's
[28:58] within me. Bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[29:00] Forget not. Don't forget. Don't let the
[29:02] devil cause you to forget all the
[29:04] benefits of being a Christian. Praise
[29:06] God.
[29:07] Don't let him distract you and look at
[29:09] other things. Stop looking at that. Look
[29:11] at God's promise. Hallelujah.
[29:13] I won't forget it. That's what David
[29:16] said. So many distractions out there.
[29:18] You can forget about things, but let's
[29:20] not forget what God promised. Amen.
[29:23] You're my son. You get an inheritance.
[29:26] You got benefits. Don't forget about
[29:28] them. Praise God. How many times I do
[29:31] this all the time. How many times you
[29:32] look in your bag, you're like, "Oh, I
[29:33] got a gift card here. I've had this for
[29:34] like six months." You forgot your
[29:36] benefits. Church, let's take out your
[29:38] your spiritual book bag. Let's look for
[29:40] some spiritual gift cards in there.
[29:42] Mercy, I've got all this free
[29:44] forgiveness. I got all this joy. I just
[29:47] got to go cash it in. Hallelujah. I
[29:49] won't I sometimes I forget, but God help
[29:52] me not forget all the benefits you've
[29:54] given to me. Praise God. Oh my.
[29:59] That's right. Who forgiveth some of
[30:02] thine iniquities.
[30:04] No, I said that wrong.
[30:07] All thine iniquities. That means every
[30:10] time you said, I don't care what the
[30:11] word says. I'm giving into my flesh.
[30:14] God will forgive that every single time.
[30:19] Amen. That's a God who's full of
[30:21] compassion.
[30:25] Who health health all thy diseases.
[30:28] Amen. Uhhuh. Trust in the Lord with all
[30:31] your heart. Lean not to your own
[30:33] understanding. Praise God. Who redeemth
[30:36] thy life from destruction.
[30:40] who crowneth thee with loving kindness
[30:43] and tender mercy. So Mali, just sit
[30:45] right there. So God comes by and he puts
[30:47] a crown on him of loving kindness.
[30:52] You're the ruler of loving kindness.
[30:55] See, that way you can extend it to other
[30:57] people. Amen. Amen. And not only that,
[31:01] I'm going to give you that. I'm also
[31:02] going to give you tender mercies. You're
[31:05] crowned with it. You're the king of
[31:06] having mercy on me, especially you
[31:09] having mercy on me. I always use him as
[31:11] examples in the church.
[31:14] That's what he crowns your life with.
[31:16] Hallelujah.
[31:17] Let me tell a few stories here quickly.
[31:20] I'm not going to say quickly. I'm going
[31:22] to take my time today. Praise God. We
[31:24] only got one service today. What am I
[31:26] worried about? Praise God. I'm gonna
[31:29] stop looking at that clock.
[31:31] You know, over the years, we've had a
[31:32] lot of people come in and out, and I've
[31:33] been in contact with numerous people,
[31:34] many people. And church, some of these
[31:37] situations with their fathers have
[31:40] really stood out to me or just being a
[31:42] father.
[31:45] You know, I think I've told the story
[31:46] before with me. You know, my dad
[31:47] divorced my mom when I was 13. Uh, and I
[31:51] I remember I wasn't a Christian yet. So,
[31:53] I remember I I you know, I wrote the
[31:55] date on a door. You know, I wrote the
[31:56] date on a door. And I thought, well, if
[31:58] uh my hero at that time was Bo Jackson,
[32:00] a a famous baseball football player. I
[32:02] said, if Bo Jackson could become a
[32:04] professional player uh without a dad,
[32:07] well, I could do it, too. And I almost
[32:09] got there. I got to the college, but I
[32:10] never got to the pros. But see, I had my
[32:13] eyes on the wrong example. Jesus wasn't
[32:16] my example. But I grew up hating my dad
[32:19] until I became a Christian.
[32:22] And then when I became a Christian, my
[32:24] dad had moved away. He'd run from the
[32:26] family. Uh this was uh five years later
[32:28] I was no uh I would have been 19. Six
[32:30] years later I became a Christian and I
[32:33] wrote him a letter. That's before cell
[32:34] phones everybody before cell phones. I
[32:36] we had to write letters actual
[32:38] handwritten letters back in the old
[32:40] days.
[32:42] And as I'm writing I still remember I
[32:44] said I started crying. I said God I said
[32:46] Dad I love you and I forgive you that
[32:48] you left me. Amen. And it's just become
[32:52] clear to me over the years. If I've been
[32:54] forgiven of hundreds of thousands of
[32:56] sins and I can like feel them.
[33:00] If I've been How can I not extend that
[33:02] forgiveness to somebody else? Praise
[33:04] God.
[33:07] If you know what forgiveness is like,
[33:09] then you can extend it to others. Praise
[33:11] God. Amen.
[33:14] Hallelujah. That's why Jesus said, "If
[33:16] you can't forgive others, I'm not going
[33:18] to forgive you." Amen. Uhhuh.
[33:23] I've had two brothers in particular,
[33:25] fine brothers, some of the finest
[33:27] friends I've ever probably had in my
[33:29] life.
[33:32] One brother wasn't a really a a
[33:34] believer. He was I think he was a sinner
[33:36] when he had his little children. But
[33:37] then when he grew up, he came in the
[33:38] message and for years he let the devil
[33:41] beat him up. Look what you look, you
[33:43] didn't train your your oldest children,
[33:45] your oldest child. You didn't train them
[33:48] the way you should have. And I remember
[33:49] him coming to the altar and I'm like,
[33:51] "Brother," he's crying. I'm like,
[33:53] "Brother, this is guilt from Satan."
[33:56] The Bible said, and I don't know if I
[33:57] said this, but I said, "God forgives all
[34:00] your iniquities."
[34:03] And I said, "Brother, here's what you
[34:04] do. You go to your oldest child and say,
[34:06] I'm sorry for the sins that I did and
[34:09] list them."
[34:12] Hallelujah. Amen. And then and then say,
[34:15] "Forgive me." And if they forgive you,
[34:19] then it's it's over. You don't have to
[34:21] live under the guilt of your sins
[34:23] anymore.
[34:25] And he did that. And he felt better by
[34:27] God's grace. Now, the devil comes back
[34:29] every now and then and brings it back on
[34:30] you. What do you got to do? You got to
[34:32] cast down that lying devil.
[34:35] He's the father of lies. He lies all the
[34:39] time. You don't have to believe a liar.
[34:42] Amen. Amen.
[34:45] You don't have to believe somebody who
[34:47] lies for a living. That's what the devil
[34:49] does. Amen. But our God is the God of
[34:52] truth. Hallelujah. Amen.
[34:56] And church. And then if that child then
[34:58] holds it against them, that father for
[35:00] doing that, then shame on that child.
[35:03] It's sin in their heart
[35:06] because that person did everything Jesus
[35:08] said. When you've do when you've done
[35:09] something wrong, go confess your sin and
[35:11] then then go back to the house of God
[35:13] and offer your gift to God. That's all
[35:15] you got to do. Amen. Hallelujah. Do not
[35:19] live under the guilt of past sins if
[35:22] you've confessed them to someone. Amen.
[35:25] That's what Satan loves to do. Don't
[35:27] forget your gift card benefits.
[35:31] Look back there in your bag and pull out
[35:32] your gift card. Ah, I do got
[35:34] forgiveness. Hallelujah. For all the
[35:37] past sins, all my past, all my present,
[35:40] all my future sins are forgiven because
[35:42] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[35:45] forever. And that's my benefit. Amen.
[35:48] Yes, sir.
[35:51] There's another brother. Now, he's kind
[35:53] of taking this the wrong way. This is my
[35:56] opinion.
[35:58] He felt bad, you know, about how he
[35:59] treated his children when they were
[36:01] young. And I said the same thing. You
[36:02] coming for prayer? I said, "Brother,
[36:04] just go to them and say you're sorry."
[36:07] But as we talked numerous times, he felt
[36:10] so bad for what he did that he let down
[36:13] the standards in the home.
[36:17] And then it causes the children to go
[36:18] astray. And the excuse is, well, I just
[36:21] want to be better friends with them. The
[36:22] best friend you can be is to tell
[36:25] someone what sin is and what
[36:26] righteousness is.
[36:30] Amen. That's the only kind of friend
[36:32] they need. Hallelujah. And if they
[36:34] complain about it, then they don't love
[36:36] God. Hallelujah. Amen. But that child is
[36:38] under your home, under your leadership.
[36:41] And see how the devil, you know, and so
[36:43] that proves the brother, the father
[36:45] never really accepted forgiveness.
[36:48] Because if he would accepted it, then he
[36:50] would have confessed to the children and
[36:52] then kept the standard. Now, let's all
[36:54] join hands. Let's all pray. Let's all
[36:56] try to live true to one another. Let's
[36:58] hold the standard of the gospel. Let's
[37:00] let the Holy Ghost keep us pure.
[37:04] Hallelujah.
[37:06] Instead of compromising
[37:09] and opening the gates and let the goats
[37:10] in the house.
[37:13] Hallelujah. Amen.
[37:17] And the last one I was praying these
[37:19] kind of came to my mind. So I didn't
[37:21] plan to preach it. So that's how I take
[37:22] it. That's the Lord telling me to preach
[37:23] this. Okay. That's just what I
[37:27] just trying to be humble about God's
[37:28] grace. The last one over the years I
[37:30] dealt with a brother and I said,
[37:32] "Brother," numerous times I said,
[37:34] "Brother, uh, oh yeah." And one time on,
[37:36] uh, Father's Day, I said, "Brother, you
[37:37] ought to text your father and tell him
[37:40] you love him." And he's like, "No, I
[37:41] can't do that." I said, "Brother, if you
[37:43] don't forgive him, it's going to come
[37:45] back and haunt you."
[37:48] Now, church, some of our dads have done
[37:49] awful things. I'm not saying you got to
[37:51] love everything they You don't have to
[37:53] love their sin, but you should have
[37:55] compassion on their soul. Amen.
[37:59] If you want to see somebody go to hell,
[38:00] you're probably not even saved. Amen.
[38:03] You should see want to see everybody
[38:05] repent of their sins and come back to
[38:07] God.
[38:08] And I told the individual as we went
[38:10] through the over the years that because
[38:12] you didn't forgive that person, then
[38:14] whenever somebody goes against you, you
[38:16] lash out at them because you still have
[38:19] sin a complex in your spirit and then
[38:22] you'll hold resentment. You'll hold
[38:24] things against them because you haven't
[38:25] forgiven the one at the beginning.
[38:27] Church, we should offer forgiveness
[38:29] freely. Shouldn't we be full of
[38:31] compassion if our father's full of
[38:33] compassion? Hallelujah.
[38:36] Amen. The Bible said, "Neither give
[38:40] place to the devil."
[38:43] If you don't forgive your dad or
[38:44] somebody, grandpa, mom, if you don't
[38:46] forgive them, you're given a place of
[38:47] Satan.
[38:50] Now, that's what was on my heart when I
[38:52] was praying.
[38:54] Hallelujah.
[38:59] He crowns you with loving kindness and
[39:02] mercy. See, you got the crown of loving
[39:03] kindness on.
[39:06] God can trust you to show loving
[39:08] kindness. God can trust you to show
[39:10] mercy to other people.
[39:12] I've had people tell me before, "Just go
[39:14] ahead and rebuke me, Brother Jesse."
[39:16] Guess what I do? I don't rebuke them. I
[39:19] just say, "Go confess your sin to the
[39:21] person you sinned against."
[39:24] I could have rebuked people.
[39:26] I'll let the Holy Ghost rebuke them.
[39:28] If you really feel sorry, you'll go
[39:30] confess to the person you sinned against
[39:32] if you really feel sorry about it.
[39:38] Verse five, who satisfaith thy mouth
[39:41] with good things, so that thy youth is
[39:44] renewed like the eagle. Verse eight, the
[39:47] Lord is merciful and gracious. He's slow
[39:49] to anger, plenteous in mercy.
[39:53] He will not always chide, neither will
[39:55] he keep his anger forever. For he hath
[39:57] not dealt with us after our sins, nor
[40:00] rewarding us us according to our
[40:02] iniquities.
[40:04] Did God punish you as much as you
[40:06] deserve? No, he didn't.
[40:10] Did David get punished as much as he
[40:11] deserved? No, he didn't. He should have
[40:14] died when he had committed adultery. He
[40:17] should have died when he had Uriah
[40:18] killed. But God didn't punish him as
[40:21] much as he deserved.
[40:23] We ought to be thankful today.
[40:26] We serve a God who's plenteous in mercy.
[40:29] We don't even get what we deserve for
[40:32] our our wickedness, our iniquities.
[40:36] Verse 11, for as high, I'm sorry, for as
[40:39] the heaven is high above the earth, so
[40:42] great is his mercy toward them that fear
[40:44] him. I thought that numerous times this
[40:47] summer. I've looked up that up up at
[40:48] that uh sorry I loo looked up that
[40:50] beautiful blue sky and I thought my Lord
[40:53] look how high that is. That's how high
[40:54] your mercy is towards me.
[40:58] Anybody uh can anybody touch the
[41:00] heavens? Anybody ever touch the moon?
[41:02] Huh? No. Nobody's ever touched the
[41:04] planets with your hand. You ever reach
[41:06] out and touch it? Well, neither can you
[41:08] grasp how much mercy God has on your
[41:10] life. Amen. How can God forgive me?
[41:13] We'll just try to reach up a little
[41:14] higher. That's how he can because it's
[41:17] beyond your grasp. Amen. It's something
[41:19] beyond human control. It's so I can
[41:22] hardly imagine. That's why I love that
[41:24] song. I can hardly think. I can hardly
[41:26] fail how much mercy God has to all those
[41:29] who will acknowledge their sin, confess
[41:31] their sin, and depart from iniquity.
[41:34] Amen.
[41:41] So great is his mercy toward them that
[41:44] fear him.
[41:48] As far as the east is from the west,
[41:52] so far he hath removed our
[41:55] transgressions from us.
[41:58] That means that means, you know, if
[42:00] you're in the east, when you get to the
[42:02] west, it's still beyond that. Praise
[42:04] God. For us, you got to go back. For us
[42:06] in the world, you got to keep going.
[42:08] It's just like an unending circle. It's
[42:10] like a maze. It's just a cycle of God's
[42:12] grace over soon as you get west and you
[42:14] got to go back east again. Praise God.
[42:16] You'll never You'll never reach the
[42:18] grasp of how great the love of God, how
[42:21] merciful and how much compassion and
[42:23] grace he has upon our lives. Amen.
[42:25] Cannot grasp it.
[42:28] Like as a father pityth his children, so
[42:31] the Lord pityth them that fear him.
[42:34] You ever pity your children? You know, I
[42:35] think Zion stubbed his toe a few week a
[42:37] few days ago and I was like, "Oh, I feel
[42:39] so sorry for this guy." Like, oh, it's
[42:40] almost like I could feel that because I
[42:42] stubbed my toe on the dishwasher. You
[42:43] know, I Oh, I feel pity for this guy or
[42:46] they fall down or you know, Victoria's
[42:48] falling down. And what what does a dad
[42:50] do? You see me in the parking lot? What
[42:51] do you run over there and pick her up?
[42:53] Bring her into the bathroom, wash it
[42:54] off. That's a father's pity. I don't
[42:56] look there and say, "Oh, you deserve
[42:58] that. That's what you deserve,
[42:59] Victoria." Or, "Caris, that's what you
[43:01] deserve. Z, you deserve that. Haha." No.
[43:04] And how much more would God do that for
[43:06] us, right? When we fall down and skin
[43:08] our knees spiritually, God rushes over
[43:10] and say, "Oh, come here. Let me clean
[43:12] you up. Confess your sins. Let's get
[43:14] this cleaned out. Let's get feeling
[43:16] better." Praise God.
[43:21] No. If you got parents that don't run to
[43:23] you, well, just pray for them.
[43:25] But God is the ultimate parent.
[43:28] Brother Ram said, "We're part I just
[43:29] listened to it yesterday." Brother Ram
[43:31] said, "We're part of the masterpiece
[43:33] family."
[43:35] It's the better version of Adam and Eve.
[43:37] That was the masterpiece. But then Satan
[43:39] got in there. But brother said, "God's
[43:40] bringing us back to a Garden of Eden
[43:42] condition." Hallelujah. In the new
[43:44] Jerusalem, the future hope. And Christ
[43:47] is going to have a masterpiece, family,
[43:50] unity, one accord. Holiness, obedience,
[43:54] eternal love. Hallelujah. Amen.
[43:58] Glory.
[44:01] As a father pies his children, so the
[44:02] Lord pityth them that fear them. I mean,
[44:06] I just think of some examples in your
[44:07] life. When my children cry for water,
[44:08] what do I do? I pull over and buy some
[44:10] water if I don't got any.
[44:12] And I said this wrong last year in
[44:13] Kentucky. I I I think I just regret it
[44:16] all the time. I said, I love to spoil my
[44:18] children. And I was just in a like a
[44:19] laughing mood. I wish I would not have
[44:21] said that. But the point is, I love to
[44:23] be good to my children. I don't think I
[44:25] spoil them, but I really want to be good
[44:28] to them. You know, I didn't have as much
[44:30] nice things when I was growing up. So,
[44:32] the fact that I can have some nice
[44:34] things and give to them, it just makes
[44:35] me so happy. Amen. Why not have a little
[44:38] fruit strip every now and then? Why not?
[44:41] Hey, it's Monday night. Why not?
[44:42] Everybody gets two scoops of ice cream.
[44:44] Why not? I love my children. That don't
[44:46] happen every night. hasn't happened for
[44:49] a long time. Actually, I did a couple I
[44:50] think I did last Monday. But like I just
[44:53] look on them and I just want them to be
[44:54] happy and give them a something to be
[44:56] happy about. Make their life happier
[44:58] because they make my life happy.
[45:01] Hallelujah. Right. And that and if
[45:04] that's me, what about God? Amen. Amen.
[45:06] What about when you get a check in the
[45:07] mail and you don't deserve it? Praise
[45:09] God. Amen. What about when God answers a
[45:13] prayer and didn't seem like it was going
[45:14] to be possible? God brought healing or
[45:16] God made a way when it didn't seem there
[45:18] was going to be a way. It's because he
[45:20] loves his children. Hallelujah.
[45:22] He pennies us. Praise God.
[45:27] You got to look at that. Sometimes,
[45:28] church, if you're at the altar or you're
[45:29] crying, "Oh, God, get me through this
[45:31] difficult time." God looks down in
[45:33] compassion. Oh, the answer's coming,
[45:34] brother. Or the answer's coming, my son.
[45:36] You just keep trusting. I pity you. I
[45:38] care about you. I'm going to do it in my
[45:40] time and season. That's right. He looks
[45:44] down on love like, "Oh, that's my job."
[45:47] Hallelujah. Just like I taught him. Just
[45:49] like I taught her. Cry out to me and
[45:51] I'll answer. Amen. Hallelujah. Call upon
[45:55] me and I'll deliver you. Hallelujah.
[45:58] Glory.
[46:01] That's right. Verse
[46:05] ah
[46:06] 14. For he knoweth our frame. He
[46:09] remember that we are dust. As for man,
[46:12] his days are as grass as a flower of the
[46:14] field, so he flourisheth.
[46:17] For the wind passes overth, and it's
[46:19] gone, and the place thereof shall know
[46:21] it no more. I was looking through my old
[46:23] pictures a few days ago. I thought, my I
[46:25] had no white hair, and now I've almost
[46:27] got a white goatee,
[46:30] the flower passing away.
[46:33] Hallelujah.
[46:35] So enjoy that nice hair, buddy,
[46:39] church. It f goes fast. Goes fast. It
[46:42] also made me so happy. I saw these
[46:44] pictures with my children and all such
[46:45] happy times. I remember God God has to
[46:48] help us remember all of our benefits.
[46:51] Hallelujah. That's right. For he knoweth
[46:54] our frame and remember that we are dust,
[46:57] the flesh. As for man, his days. Okay.
[47:00] Verse 16. For the wind passes over. I'm
[47:02] no I'm sorry. Go to 17. But the mercy of
[47:04] the Lord is from everlasting to
[47:07] everlasting upon them that fear him, and
[47:10] his righteousness unto his children's
[47:13] children.
[47:15] My grandpa Garza prayed for my
[47:18] grandmother when she was dead in the
[47:20] hospital, and God raised her from the
[47:21] dead.
[47:23] Hallelujah. And all and he gave up. He
[47:26] he was a he was alcoholic and and and my
[47:29] grandma almost divorced him. But one
[47:32] night he found himself staggered. He he
[47:34] came into the service drunk
[47:37] and he found himself somehow after the
[47:38] preaching singing he come up to the
[47:40] altar. He gave his heart to the Lord and
[47:42] instantly he was sober. Amen. That's my
[47:45] grandpa. Amen. And I'm my grandpa's
[47:48] children's children. Amen. And now the
[47:51] righteousness that my grandpa lived is
[47:54] upon me. Hallelujah. Amen. And I
[47:56] preached the gospel for 25 years and
[47:59] I'll keep preaching it by the grace of
[48:01] God. And so the righteousness of Christ
[48:03] will be on me and my children and their
[48:06] children. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah.
[48:10] Yes. It's the power of God. It's God's
[48:13] mercy from everlasting to everlasting on
[48:16] them that fear the Lord. Amen.
[48:18] Now, my grandpa's got three preachers. I
[48:20] always like to say that. My mom's got
[48:22] three preachers. Maybe some more.
[48:24] Hallelujah.
[48:26] That's what we need by God's grace
[48:29] to such as keep his covenant to those
[48:31] that remember his commandments to do
[48:33] them. Not talk about them. Not just hear
[48:35] him preach, but go home and do them.
[48:37] Amen.
[48:40] The Lord hath prepared his throne in the
[48:41] heavens, and his kingdom ruleth over
[48:43] all. Bless, bless the Lord, ye his
[48:46] angels that excel in strength, that do
[48:47] his commandments. Hearken unto the voice
[48:49] of his word. Bless ye the Lord, all ye
[48:51] his hosts, ye ministers of his that do
[48:53] his pleasure. Bless the Lord all his
[48:56] works in all places of dominion. Bless
[48:58] the Lord, oh my soul.
[49:02] Church, I also found out this week
[49:03] there's iniquities that have dominion
[49:05] over you and then there's iniquities
[49:07] that don't have dominion over you.
[49:11] Psalm 119 verse 133. Everybody got your
[49:14] Bible.
[49:18] There are some iniquities if people
[49:19] don't confess them, they will those de
[49:22] those iniquities will have dominion.
[49:23] they will rule their life
[49:25] like drug addiction like right all these
[49:27] things we're talking about uh sexual
[49:28] perversion all these things even
[49:30] bitterness even fear
[49:34] people can just live under uh the
[49:36] depression or a spirit of fear and that
[49:39] has dominion over them
[49:42] hallelujah what was it Psalm 119 133 119
[49:47] 133 big big numbers there chapter in the
[49:50] Bible Psalm 119 biggest song ever
[49:52] written
[49:54] Order my steps in thy word. In other
[49:57] words, let me step from word to word to
[50:00] word to word. In other word, I only step
[50:04] if I'm stepping on the word. Praise God.
[50:07] Amen. I'm not going to step in the
[50:08] permissive will of God. I'm only going
[50:10] to step if I've got a scripture to step
[50:12] on. Amen. Praise God. Yes. Like I said
[50:16] with that father, well, I'll just let
[50:17] the girls wear a little bit of makeup.
[50:19] You stepped out of the word. Amen.
[50:22] Hallelujah. Uh-huh. I'll just let them
[50:24] watch a little bit of the Super Bowl.
[50:25] I'll let them watch a little bit of them
[50:26] dirty movies. You stepped outside the
[50:28] word.
[50:30] Your steps are not ordered in the word
[50:32] anymore. Hallelujah.
[50:36] And let not any iniquity have dominion
[50:39] over me. Well, David said, "I got
[50:41] 100,000 iniquities, but not all of them
[50:43] had a dominion over him." In other
[50:46] words, they all didn't turn into like a
[50:48] daily complex. I every day I lose to
[50:51] this church is if we if we got that
[50:54] problem, it's time to confess our sins.
[50:56] It's time to seek God for deliverance.
[50:58] It's time to pray and fast until that
[51:00] demon comes off you. Amen. Amen.
[51:02] Hallelujah. Because some demons only
[51:05] come out by prayer and fasting.
[51:09] I heard a story from uh
[51:15] Sydney Jackson. If you know brother
[51:17] Ram's tapes, he was a a a big supporter
[51:19] of Brother Ram. He's from South Africa.
[51:21] He said there was a sister that came to
[51:23] Brother Bam and said, "Uh, I I can't
[51:25] read. I want to be able to read." And
[51:27] Brother Bam prayed for her and Brother
[51:30] told her, "You go fast and pray so you
[51:31] can read the Bible." That's all she
[51:33] wanted. Now, church, what are we praying
[51:35] and fasting for?
[51:37] She just wants to be able to. And you
[51:39] and I have the privilege of having we
[51:40] have it here or here. There's Lydia. We
[51:43] got to hear here. We can read the Bible
[51:46] anywhere and and it becomes common to
[51:48] us. But she's like, "Brother Bam,
[51:49] prophet of God, I just want to read the
[51:51] Bible."
[51:54] Brother Bam said, "Pray and fast about
[51:55] it." I just listened to the story this
[51:57] week. She prayed and fasted. I forget
[51:58] how many, might have been a year. And
[52:00] one day while she's praying, she looked
[52:02] over at her Bible and she just could
[52:04] start reading it. Amen. From South
[52:07] Africa.
[52:09] And then after that, she's rejoicing.
[52:11] She goes in the kitchen and tries to
[52:12] read the newspaper and the cookbook. She
[52:14] can't read that. God only let her read
[52:17] the Bible. Amen. And the church said,
[52:20] "Amen." Ah, if that's all that God did
[52:22] for her, that's enough. Hallelujah. Cuz
[52:25] now she can read all the benefits that
[52:27] God has for her. Hallelujah.
[52:30] Now she can remember all the benefits
[52:33] God did.
[52:35] What gift cards do I got? I hope next
[52:37] time I hope on the drive home, you think
[52:38] about all your gift cards you got.
[52:41] Brother Austin, I got one for you,
[52:42] buddy. I've been I've had this up here
[52:43] for a while. I'm giving this to you
[52:45] after service. But that's it. I didn't
[52:48] even plan that. I was preaching on gift
[52:51] cards. I didn't realize it was in there.
[52:53] I'm giving you that, buddy. Amen. Cuz I
[52:55] know you've done Door Dash before.
[52:59] That's right. Now, see, some of them are
[53:02] going to have dominion over you. You got
[53:04] to pray and fast. When was the last time
[53:05] you prayed and fasted to be free from
[53:08] this said sin?
[53:10] When was it that important for you to
[53:13] have integrity?
[53:16] When was when was it that important for
[53:18] you to have integrity before God and a
[53:21] fear of God that you'd pray and fast for
[53:23] deliverance? Amen.
[53:26] Hallelujah.
[53:29] Glory. So, just keep that in mind. David
[53:32] had 100,000, but not all of them had
[53:34] dominion. Oh, just one day I struggle
[53:36] with this. I don't struggle with it for
[53:38] a while. Oh, that might struggle there.
[53:39] See, it didn't have dominion.
[53:42] Hallelujah.
[53:47] Psalm 130, chapter 130, verse one. These
[53:51] are all David's insights.
[53:54] I know this church loves David here.
[53:55] Praise God. Sight and sound David, too.
[53:59] Verse one, a song of degrees. Out of the
[54:02] depths have I cried unto thee, oh God.
[54:04] See, it wasn't just like, oh God, can
[54:06] you help me? It's like, God, I need you.
[54:10] The deep cause to the deep. Praise God.
[54:13] I need something, God. I got to have it.
[54:16] This is from the depths of my soul. Yes.
[54:19] Hallelujah.
[54:21] That's how David prayed. Lord, hear my
[54:23] voice. Let thine ears be attentive to
[54:25] the voice of my supplication. If thou,
[54:27] Lord, should mark iniquities, Lord, who
[54:30] shall stand. Would brother Brandham
[54:31] stand if God marked iniquities? No.
[54:34] Would David stand? No.
[54:36] See, it's a rhetorical question.
[54:38] Nobody's going to be good enough to make
[54:40] it to heaven on your own.
[54:44] Hallelujah. If God marked all the times
[54:47] I made mistakes, it'd be like this. It'd
[54:49] be like there's a lot of them, huh?
[54:52] And and so, so David had the
[54:54] realization, wow, God just God God can't
[54:57] uh God can't remember all those. It's
[54:59] got to be all or nothing. Praise God.
[55:01] Hallelujah. It's got to be all or
[55:03] nothing. And so God takes all the marks.
[55:05] The Bible said everything that was
[55:07] written against you was nailed to the
[55:09] cross. Amen. Right? It's paid for. Bam.
[55:13] Bam. Bam. All the list. All the marks
[55:15] against you. The cross is paying for
[55:17] this. Hallelujah. And then you can take
[55:20] that receipt. Say you've got God's
[55:21] receipt. And you can say, "Look, devil,
[55:23] it's paid for. My forgiveness is paid
[55:26] for. Paid in full." Hallelujah.
[55:30] Look, devil, it is finished. Hallelujah.
[55:34] All my iniquities forgiven and all my
[55:36] diseases healed.
[55:40] Ah, I got the receipt. Hallelujah.
[55:47] That's right, church. That's right.
[55:49] Verse four. But there is forgiveness
[55:52] with God. See, other people might not
[55:55] forgive you, but God will forgive you.
[55:58] Right, brother Arley? Some people may
[56:01] never forgive you, but God will forgive
[56:03] you.
[56:05] Hallelujah. Right, brother Andy?
[56:08] Some of us were so our past is we're so
[56:10] ashamed of our past.
[56:12] Other people might they might battle
[56:14] evil spirits, but we know God gives us
[56:17] forgiveness. Amen. Hallelujah.
[56:20] And that's why we can walk in the
[56:22] freedom of the Holy Spirit. That's why
[56:24] we can be crowned with loving kindness.
[56:26] We can be kind to our wives even when
[56:29] they're not kind to us. Hallelujah.
[56:32] Because we're crowned. God put that
[56:33] crown on us.
[56:35] You're the You're the king of loving
[56:37] kindness, brother.
[56:39] You're the king of mercy. Don't the
[56:41] Bible say we're kings and priests unto
[56:43] God?
[56:45] See, in other words, what does that
[56:46] mean? That means you you have dominion
[56:49] over sin and you're able to express
[56:52] mercy and loving kindness to others.
[56:54] You've conquered that sin. Oh, there it
[56:56] is. Amen. You've conquered that. You've
[56:58] defeated that spirit. And now God's
[57:00] crowned you. You've overcome that. And
[57:03] now you can offer love. You can offer
[57:05] forgiveness because you've fought the
[57:07] battle. You've overcome. You've fought
[57:09] the good fight of faith. And you're a
[57:11] conqueror in Christ Jesus. Hallelujah.
[57:13] Oh my. Hallelujah.
[57:18] But there is forgiveness with thee, that
[57:20] thou mayest be feared.
[57:27] All right,
[57:29] I think I'm going to close with this
[57:30] here. I got I'm going to get down to
[57:31] closing. I can tell when everybody
[57:33] starts to get a little more quiet,
[57:35] little bit of tiredness. Amen.
[57:38] So, let me try to find a place to close,
[57:41] which is about 15 or 30 more minutes,
[57:44] just in case you're new here.
[57:47] This one really struck me. I meant to
[57:48] preach this in part one, but I never got
[57:50] to it. So, I trust it's the Lord's
[57:51] leading for today. Proverbs 16:6. Will
[57:54] you pull up there, hun? Proverbs 16:6.
[57:57] Let me show you how iniquity gets
[57:59] cleaned out of your life. I've preached
[58:01] off and on on it, but let me just show
[58:03] you a scripture. You can take this
[58:05] scripture to the bank of heaven.
[58:08] Hallelujah. Didn't God say, "Prove me
[58:10] with your tithes and offerings." Didn't
[58:11] he say that? You can pay your tithe and
[58:12] offerings to God and say, "God, you said
[58:14] prove me." Amen.
[58:17] Right? Like I told brother Chris, I
[58:18] said, uh, we went to that scripture on
[58:20] the Bible study on, was it Friday night?
[58:22] I said, "Jesus Christ is the high priest
[58:24] of your profession. Whatever you say."
[58:28] Hallelujah. You confess the promise. You
[58:31] confess what you have need of. And Jesus
[58:33] will make intercession for your promise.
[58:35] I'm sorry, for your confession of his
[58:37] promise. Amen. Hallelujah.
[58:40] And this is the scripture you can take.
[58:41] If you need deliverance from iniquity,
[58:43] here's your verse to use.
[58:46] You can say, "God, you told me in your
[58:48] word that my iniquity is purged through
[58:51] these three steps."
[58:54] Hallelujah. Amen. It's so simple. I
[58:57] thought, man, how do I get purged?
[59:00] What's the word purge mean? The word
[59:02] purge means to cover, to make an
[59:05] atonement. Atonement means to make one
[59:07] again. If you have two companies or
[59:10] parties that are opposite or are not in
[59:12] in a in a in accord, atonement means you
[59:15] make them one again.
[59:18] So your sin separates you and God.
[59:22] But atonement brings you back together.
[59:27] To purge means to cover. Purge make
[59:30] reconciliation.
[59:32] to cover with pitch
[59:36] to coat
[59:38] to pacify the anger of God. Right? To
[59:41] satisfy the anger of God. God's no
[59:43] longer sat no God's no longer angry at
[59:45] me.
[59:47] It means to atone for sin by legal
[59:50] rights.
[59:52] Right? I love how Ray Comfort gives that
[59:54] example. If you got a speeding ticket,
[59:56] which I don't recommend you get one
[59:58] because I've had three over the last few
[59:59] years and man, I'm ashamed of myself.
[1:00:02] That's why I drive like a grandma. I
[1:00:04] don't care if people honk behind me. I'm
[1:00:05] like, just go. I'm go. I'm just fine
[1:00:07] right here. You just wait now. That's
[1:00:10] what I say. They're like, who is this
[1:00:13] dude?
[1:00:15] I'm not getting another ticket. I'm not
[1:00:17] You're gonna have to wait.
[1:00:20] Hallelujah. I forgot what I was going to
[1:00:22] say. Oh, yeah. Now, if you're Ray
[1:00:23] Comfort, so I got a choice. I can either
[1:00:26] pay it online or I can go into the court
[1:00:30] now. Let's let's let's say I don't have
[1:00:31] any money. And I'm like, I got to go
[1:00:34] into the court.
[1:00:36] I'm like, judge. He's like, yeah,
[1:00:38] present your case. Uh, I was going 55
[1:00:40] and a 35. That's what I did to you. I'm
[1:00:43] ashamed of myself.
[1:00:47] He said, okay, got to pay the fine. I I
[1:00:49] don't have any money, judge.
[1:00:51] Okay, lock him up
[1:00:54] over $200 or whatever it was. All of a
[1:00:58] sudden, they get ready to lock you up.
[1:00:59] All of a sudden, uh, somebody says, "Uh,
[1:01:02] judge, excuse me, judge. I'll pay his
[1:01:04] fine."
[1:01:07] I look, turn around. Who is it? It's
[1:01:09] Jesus.
[1:01:11] Jesus like, "Here, I got the $200.
[1:01:14] Pay the fine." He's like, "All right,
[1:01:15] thank you. I'm satisfied. The legal
[1:01:18] penaltyy's been paid. Now you go free.
[1:01:20] That's what Jesus did for our sins.
[1:01:22] Hallelujah. Amen. We couldn't pay for
[1:01:25] our sin debt. Jesus came and paid the
[1:01:28] wages of death. Hallelujah. Amen. He
[1:01:31] paid the wage of death and now you can
[1:01:33] go free legally. The price has been
[1:01:37] paid. It's finished. Hallelujah. You and
[1:01:39] I are free men and women today. Praise
[1:01:42] God. So, can't we offer that to somebody
[1:01:44] else? Amen. Amen.
[1:01:47] Oh, it's easy to take it for you, but
[1:01:49] now give it to somebody else. Praise
[1:01:51] God.
[1:01:53] Hallelujah. Amen, buddy. Hallelujah. I
[1:01:55] like that. Glory. I like when the little
[1:01:58] ones get preaching.
[1:02:03] So, here's the three steps. First, you
[1:02:05] must accept God's mercy. Listen, church.
[1:02:07] Judas's Scariot wouldn't accept it.
[1:02:11] He's like, "How could God have mercy on
[1:02:12] me? I betrayed him." So, he wouldn't
[1:02:14] accept the mercy of God. You have to
[1:02:17] say, "God, I believe you'll have mercy
[1:02:19] on me." Church, how many times have I
[1:02:20] said that, "Lord, if you forgave Moses
[1:02:22] at a murder, if you forgave David and
[1:02:24] all his sins, if you forgave Abraham,
[1:02:27] surely you'll forgive me." Amen. Because
[1:02:29] I haven't I haven't done those things.
[1:02:30] Uhhuh.
[1:02:33] Right. By mercy, you have to accept
[1:02:36] God's mercy. And then truth. This is the
[1:02:39] truth of confessing your sins. Judas
[1:02:41] never went to conf and told Jesus the
[1:02:43] truth. He should have went and said,
[1:02:44] "I'm sorry. I wanted money more than
[1:02:46] your fellowship. Forgive me.
[1:02:49] He should have said that. But he
[1:02:51] wouldn't go tell Jesus the truth.
[1:02:55] By mercy and truth is iniquity purged.
[1:03:02] You accept God's mercy and you tell the
[1:03:05] truth. All the truth.
[1:03:09] Don't whitewash it. Don't try to say,
[1:03:11] "Well, it kind of my it was your fault.
[1:03:13] It wasn't kind of. It was all my fault.
[1:03:15] Praise God. Don't blame anybody else.
[1:03:18] Blame yourself. Praise God. Amen.
[1:03:22] And then what's the verse say? By mercy
[1:03:24] and truth, iniquity is purged. And
[1:03:26] here's the third. Then you depart and by
[1:03:29] the fear of the Lord, men depart from
[1:03:31] it. Then you walk right away from it.
[1:03:35] That's what brother Ram said. They asked
[1:03:37] Brother Ram in questions and answers 64.
[1:03:39] He said, "What do you what if you have a
[1:03:40] betting sin?" And brother Ram says,
[1:03:43] 'Well, remember you do the opposite.
[1:03:46] Brother Ram said, "Your bees setting sin
[1:03:47] is like a rattlesnake or some mama." He
[1:03:49] said, 'You don't have to keep fighting
[1:03:50] against it. He said, "Just walk away
[1:03:52] from it." Amen, Lord. Hallelujah. Why
[1:03:56] are you fighting with it? Why you
[1:03:57] playing with Don't focus on the snake.
[1:03:59] Amen. Don't focus on the devil. Don't
[1:04:01] focus on the sin. Turn your eyes upon
[1:04:03] Jesus. Look forward in his wonderful
[1:04:05] face. Get the fear of the Lord on you
[1:04:07] and depart from iniquity. Praise God.
[1:04:10] Amen.
[1:04:15] And now you've got a receipt.
[1:04:19] The receipt is Proverbs 16 verse 6.
[1:04:23] Hallelujah. You can also take Psalm 103
[1:04:28] verse three.
[1:04:30] I am the Lord thy God who forgives all
[1:04:33] thy iniquities.
[1:04:38] I believe that with all my heart.
[1:04:45] I'm going to show a visual real quick
[1:04:47] here just to remind the saints.
[1:04:52] Would you click over here just briefly?
[1:04:55] I went through a couple of these
[1:04:57] just to show the visual. Remember we
[1:05:00] looked at the life of Abraham through
[1:05:02] Genesis 12 all the way to Genesis 25.
[1:05:04] His whole life is in those chapters. He
[1:05:06] got saved. He got justified here and
[1:05:07] then he got sanctified in type. Then he
[1:05:09] got filled with the Holy Ghost. And
[1:05:11] these red marks are all the bad
[1:05:12] decisions he made. But when God wrote
[1:05:16] about him,
[1:05:17] the Bible said he didn't stagger at all.
[1:05:21] Now, I forgot all those dots went away
[1:05:23] on my other slide. I couldn't find the
[1:05:24] other slide. I was looking for it this
[1:05:25] morning. But in other words, all those
[1:05:28] all those mistakes just vanish away.
[1:05:31] God doesn't see them anymore.
[1:05:34] Because if God would mark iniquities,
[1:05:35] who's going to see him? If God marked
[1:05:38] all my iniquities and yours, none of us
[1:05:40] would go to heaven. Amen. We have no
[1:05:43] hope except except our only hope is
[1:05:46] Jesus, our living hope. Praise God.
[1:05:48] That's the only hope we have. Praise
[1:05:50] God. Amen.
[1:05:56] Which one of you brothers, husbands, now
[1:05:58] have ditched your wife just to save your
[1:06:00] own skin? That's what Abraham did. Not
[1:06:04] once, twice.
[1:06:07] Well, honey, I thought you said you'd
[1:06:08] love me. You never do it again. Sorry.
[1:06:10] Forgive me my iniquity. Right? What else
[1:06:13] could he say?
[1:06:17] God would have told Sarah, "Forgive him.
[1:06:18] He's my prophet." Right?
[1:06:20] Forgive him. Just please forgive him.
[1:06:24] Remember, Brother Ram, he had uh when he
[1:06:26] got saved, uh he was pastoring in the
[1:06:28] yellow and then the blue uh evangelism.
[1:06:32] Oh, no. That's first poll. Green was
[1:06:34] second poll. Orange was third pole. Yet
[1:06:37] he had all these big mistakes in there.
[1:06:39] We went through that. But when the
[1:06:40] brother said, "I hope when my when God
[1:06:42] writes about my life in the book of life
[1:06:44] that he'll say the same thing he said
[1:06:46] about Abraham, he staggered not at the
[1:06:48] plan of God." Amen. But was strong in
[1:06:51] faith, giving God glory.
[1:06:54] Hallelujah.
[1:06:59] And I just thought I'd do one for my
[1:07:00] good friend David. Like I told you in
[1:07:03] heaven, I can't wait till I can get up
[1:07:04] and go to heaven and say, "David,
[1:07:08] your testimony was such a blessing to me
[1:07:10] on the earth.
[1:07:12] I struggle with this. I struggle with
[1:07:13] that." But it seemed like every time God
[1:07:16] would point me right back to your life.
[1:07:18] Thank you for trusting in the
[1:07:20] forgiveness of God. Thanks for all those
[1:07:21] songs you wrote me that I got to sing at
[1:07:24] church.
[1:07:27] Hallelujah. Your testimony, it meant
[1:07:29] something to me.
[1:07:32] The fact he could believe that God would
[1:07:35] forgive him, that meant something to me.
[1:07:38] That that means I can believe God can
[1:07:40] forgive me of my sins.
[1:07:44] So this morning, I thought I'd just make
[1:07:45] a quick little list of all the highs and
[1:07:47] lows of his life.
[1:07:50] He was anointed by the prophet Samuel,
[1:07:52] just like Christ. Christ was anointed
[1:07:54] there on the River Jordan. He played
[1:07:57] music for King Saul. He cast out devils.
[1:07:59] Then he slew the giant Goliath.
[1:08:05] He won all these battles for the king.
[1:08:07] And I didn't put up there. He had women.
[1:08:09] He had he had uh he had choirs, brother
[1:08:11] Benjamin. He had choirs singing Saul has
[1:08:14] slayed his thousands,
[1:08:17] David his 10.
[1:08:20] He's like walking into a place of people
[1:08:22] singing about me.
[1:08:24] Man, I'm pretty good guy. By God's
[1:08:25] grace. By God's grace, I'm pretty good
[1:08:27] guy.
[1:08:29] I mean, look at these highs in his life.
[1:08:33] It wasn't too long, church, where he
[1:08:34] started getting some low times.
[1:08:39] People tried to murder him.
[1:08:41] He lied to the pastor. I'll say like
[1:08:43] that. He lied to the priest. He lied to
[1:08:46] the evangelist.
[1:08:48] He pretended to be insane.
[1:08:52] He joined with the Philistine army. But
[1:08:54] later they dismissed him. even they
[1:08:57] wouldn't let him fight in in in their
[1:08:58] army. That's how much God protects you,
[1:09:01] church. Oh, amen. Hallelujah.
[1:09:04] But then he spares Saul twice. He could
[1:09:06] have taken revenge on this man that cut
[1:09:08] him down. Talk about revenge.
[1:09:12] Talk about the spirit of resentment and
[1:09:14] revenge.
[1:09:16] And yet he overcame it twice.
[1:09:20] See, look. It didn't have dominion over
[1:09:22] him.
[1:09:23] See that?
[1:09:26] Let's serve God so that our iniquities
[1:09:28] do not have dominion over us.
[1:09:32] Hallelujah.
[1:09:34] Then he became king over Hebron. Then
[1:09:36] seven years later of all Israel. He
[1:09:39] danced before the Lord with the ark
[1:09:43] and God looked down from heaven and
[1:09:45] said, "There's a man after my own
[1:09:47] heart."
[1:09:48] Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:09:52] Now look, church, to do that, he had to
[1:09:54] forget about all these other mistakes
[1:09:56] when he danced before the Lord.
[1:09:59] He couldn't have danced and praised God
[1:10:00] and said, "Hallelujah. Oh, glory be his
[1:10:03] name." Well, he's thinking about all my
[1:10:04] sins. Oh, I failed God there. Oh, I
[1:10:07] failed God there. I failed. He had to
[1:10:10] forget about that. He had to trust that
[1:10:12] God had expressed God had shown him
[1:10:15] compassion on his life.
[1:10:18] He had to believe he was a forgiven
[1:10:20] child of God.
[1:10:24] And then he even captured Isra uh uh
[1:10:26] Jerusalem from the Jebusites, which
[1:10:28] Joshua never did.
[1:10:30] He expanded the borders to fulfill God's
[1:10:32] promise to Joshua. He conquered all the
[1:10:35] land when other when when Joshua and the
[1:10:37] other ones couldn't do it. But then
[1:10:40] church, we know a lot of low points at
[1:10:41] the end of his life.
[1:10:44] He committed adultery. He had Uriah
[1:10:46] murdered. He committed a a prideful
[1:10:49] census. He had he had polygamy. He had
[1:10:52] at least I think eight wives. He had he
[1:10:54] was a poor father
[1:10:57] with Amnan and also uh with uh Abselon.
[1:11:02] He wasn't the father he should have
[1:11:04] been. But you know what, church? In
[1:11:07] heaven, God got rid of all those lows.
[1:11:10] And God's going to say, "David, you
[1:11:12] staggered not at the promise of God
[1:11:14] through unbelief."
[1:11:17] Because God knows how to wash us from
[1:11:19] our iniquities.
[1:11:21] Hallelujah. God knows how to purge us
[1:11:24] thy.
[1:11:26] Oh, let my life be like this. That God
[1:11:29] only sees the high points of my life.
[1:11:30] And God doesn't God doesn't remember all
[1:11:33] the times I failed him.
[1:11:38] All right, let me close with this.
[1:11:40] Get your Bibles here. I'm closing with
[1:11:41] this one.
[1:11:45] What would the last words
[1:11:48] be of a man who was after the heart of
[1:11:52] God?
[1:11:55] What would the last words be of a giant
[1:11:57] killer,
[1:12:00] king, poem, poet, prophet, and yet also
[1:12:05] adulterer, murderer?
[1:12:09] What would the last words recorded out
[1:12:11] of his mouth be?
[1:12:14] Oh God, forgive me of my sins. Forgive
[1:12:16] me of all iniquities. Let's see what his
[1:12:18] last words would be. Let's see if he
[1:12:20] accepted forgiveness.
[1:12:24] 1st Chronicles 29:10.
[1:12:34] David caught a revelation of what it was
[1:12:36] like to be forgiven.
[1:12:41] He could have said, "I deserve death. I
[1:12:44] deserve hell, but Jesus has, but God has
[1:12:47] forgiven me." Right? Jehovah has
[1:12:50] forgiven me. Yahweh has washed away all
[1:12:53] my iniquity.
[1:12:56] 1 Chronicles 29:10.
[1:13:02] Wherefore David blessed the Lord before
[1:13:04] all the congregation.
[1:13:08] These are parallel passage with another
[1:13:10] verse. 2 Samuel 23 says, "Now these be
[1:13:14] the last words of David."
[1:13:20] Read verse 10. Wherefore David blessed
[1:13:22] the Lord before all the congregation.
[1:13:24] And David said, "Blessed be thou, Lord
[1:13:26] God of Israel, our father, forever and
[1:13:28] ever." What's the first thing he does?
[1:13:30] His last words, bless the Lord. Keep
[1:13:33] blessing God. Keep praising God. Our God
[1:13:36] is rich in mercy. Thine, O Lord, is the
[1:13:39] greatness and the power. Is he bragging
[1:13:41] about his greatness and all the things
[1:13:42] he accomplished in his life? He's
[1:13:45] talking about God's greatness.
[1:13:48] See, church, the longer you serve God,
[1:13:50] the greater God ought to become in your
[1:13:52] mind. Amen. Not how great you are,
[1:13:58] how great God is.
[1:14:00] He didn't say, "I'm a giant killer. I
[1:14:02] conquered all the land that Joshua never
[1:14:04] conquered." He's not talking about
[1:14:05] himself. He's talking about God.
[1:14:10] Thine, O Lord, is the greatness and the
[1:14:12] power and the glory and the victory and
[1:14:14] the majesty. For all that is in the
[1:14:16] heaven and in the earth is thine. Thine
[1:14:18] is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art
[1:14:20] exalted as head above all.
[1:14:25] Both riches and honor come of thee.
[1:14:27] Notice I didn't get this for myself. God
[1:14:29] gave it to me. And church, God makes
[1:14:31] some people poor. God makes some people
[1:14:33] rich. It all comes from God's hand.
[1:14:37] Hallelujah. We ought just to be thankful
[1:14:38] that we're rich in God's forgiveness.
[1:14:40] Amen. That God's been rich in mercy to
[1:14:42] us. We can all say, "I'm rich in God's
[1:14:44] forgiveness."
[1:14:46] That's what matters. Because remember,
[1:14:48] riches are a snare many times,
[1:14:51] right? People get a little extra money.
[1:14:52] Brother Ram says, pretty soon they don't
[1:14:54] even come to church anymore. Pretty soon
[1:14:55] they're in the things of the world just
[1:14:57] because of the snare of riches. They
[1:15:00] don't need God.
[1:15:05] Verse 12, both riches and honor come of
[1:15:07] thee, and thou reignest over all, and in
[1:15:08] thine hand is power and might, and in
[1:15:10] thine hand is it to make great and to
[1:15:12] give strength unto all. Therefore, now,
[1:15:16] therefore, our God, we thank thee and
[1:15:18] praise thy glorious name. Anything in
[1:15:20] here about his sins or uh all his
[1:15:22] failures? Was he focusing on his sins?
[1:15:25] He was focusing on the grace of God.
[1:15:29] But who am I and what is my people that
[1:15:31] we should be able to offer so willingly
[1:15:33] after this sort? For all things come of
[1:15:35] thee, and of thine own have we given
[1:15:38] thee? For we are strangers before thee,
[1:15:41] and sojourers as were all of our
[1:15:42] fathers. Our days on the earth ours
[1:15:44] shadow, and there is none abiding.
[1:15:50] Now, let's go back to 2 Samuel 23:1.
[1:15:56] 2 Samuel 23:1. Now these be the last
[1:16:00] words of David. David the son of Jesse
[1:16:02] said, "And the man who was raised up on
[1:16:04] high."
[1:16:06] But church, wasn't he also brought low
[1:16:08] in murder and adultery and pride?
[1:16:12] But when it's recorded about him, it's
[1:16:14] recorded that he's raised up on high.
[1:16:16] God only remembered the times when he
[1:16:19] would raise up in the Holy Spirit.
[1:16:23] the anointed of the God of Jacob and the
[1:16:26] sweet psalmist of Israel said, "The
[1:16:28] spirit of the Lord spake by me." And I
[1:16:31] hope that's my testimony today. Praise
[1:16:33] God. That God's spirit is speaking
[1:16:35] through me just like every other
[1:16:37] preacher, just like anyone that sings a
[1:16:38] song special, that we would be so
[1:16:40] privileged that God could forgive all
[1:16:42] the marks against us and God would speak
[1:16:44] through human lips
[1:16:47] of unworthy vessels.
[1:16:50] Hallelujah.
[1:16:52] And by his word, I'm sorry, and his word
[1:16:54] was in my tongue. The God of Israel
[1:16:56] said, "The rock of Israel spake to me.
[1:16:57] He that ruleth over men must be just,
[1:17:00] ruling in the fear of God. And he shall
[1:17:02] be as the light of the morning, when the
[1:17:04] sun riseth, even a morning without
[1:17:06] clouds, as the tender grass springing
[1:17:10] out of the earth by clear shining after
[1:17:12] the rain." Let's stand to our feet.
[1:17:14] Praise God. What does God promise?
[1:17:17] If you confess your sins and you rule
[1:17:20] over sin and you bring sin into
[1:17:22] obedience to the word of God, the Bible
[1:17:24] says you'll come forth like a brand new
[1:17:27] morning.
[1:17:30] You'll have the freshness.
[1:17:32] You'll have the glory and the beauty of
[1:17:35] a brand new morning.
[1:17:38] One of my favorite things is to go see
[1:17:39] my little baby in the morning. Hold her
[1:17:42] up by the light. Light shining through.
[1:17:44] She's all happy. She's all fresh. I'm
[1:17:46] all fresh,
[1:17:48] the sunshine shining on it. And the
[1:17:50] Bible says, David said, his last words
[1:17:52] are, if you confess your sins, if you
[1:17:54] give God all the glory, if you let God
[1:17:56] be the Lord of your life, he'll make you
[1:17:58] brand new like the morning.
[1:18:02] He said, "Fear God, all Israel,
[1:18:05] give God praise." How many want to
[1:18:07] praise him today? Musicians can come.
[1:18:09] Let's praise him. Let's have a word of
[1:18:10] prayer. Hallelujah.
[1:18:13] the last words of a man after God's own
[1:18:17] heart. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[1:18:22] Heavenly Father, we thank you for today,
[1:18:24] Lord God. So awesome to see that David's
[1:18:26] last words were not, "Oh, I'm such a
[1:18:28] failure. I don't even know if I'll make
[1:18:29] it to heaven.
[1:18:31] I'm such a disgrace."
[1:18:35] Lord, we know he did that in the temple
[1:18:36] after he committed adultery and murder.
[1:18:40] I forget how many days he laid there on
[1:18:41] his face pleading for the life of that
[1:18:43] child. And no doubt in those prayers, he
[1:18:46] confessed his sins again and again and
[1:18:49] again. Yet Lord, he comes to the end of
[1:18:52] his life and he says, "Let's give God
[1:18:54] glory. Everything comes from God.
[1:18:58] He's full of compassion. Let's give him
[1:19:00] thanks. Let's give him praise.
[1:19:04] Let men rule in the fear of God." And if
[1:19:08] they do that, if they live in the fear
[1:19:10] of the Lord, they'll be like the bright
[1:19:12] morning shining forth in its strength.
[1:19:16] They'll have a freshness about them.
[1:19:18] Glory. They'll be crowned with loving
[1:19:20] kindness and mercy. They're the kings of
[1:19:23] kindness. The kings of mercy
[1:19:27] because they've accepted your mercy.
[1:19:31] They've accepted your loving kindness.
[1:19:33] Hallelujah, Jesus.
[1:19:36] Oh, what a what a promise, dear God.
[1:19:40] No wonder David said, "Bless the Lord,
[1:19:42] oh my soul, and all that is within me,
[1:19:45] bless his holy name,
[1:19:48] who forgiveth all of our iniquities and
[1:19:51] health all our diseases." Hallelujah.
[1:19:54] Oh, God, you're so great.
[1:19:58] Thank you, Lord, for such amazing love.
[1:20:01] Thank you that you're full of compassion
[1:20:02] on sinners like us. Sinners saved by
[1:20:05] grace.
[1:20:08] Lord, we know we're saved. We know we're
[1:20:10] going to heaven. But Lord, let not
[1:20:11] iniquities have dominion over us, Lord
[1:20:13] God.
[1:20:15] But give us dominion over them
[1:20:18] by mercy and truth and departing from
[1:20:23] evil.
[1:20:25] Lord, we've got a receipt. When the
[1:20:28] devil tries to tell us, "Oh, you can't
[1:20:30] have you can't be forgiven." We've got a
[1:20:31] receipt and say, we can say, "Jesus
[1:20:33] purchased it for me."
[1:20:36] Here it is. Proverbs 16:6. By mercy and
[1:20:40] truth, iniquity is purged out of my life
[1:20:43] and I've left. I've departed from
[1:20:46] iniquity.
[1:20:49] Oh God, we thank you for the forgiveness
[1:20:51] that you offer. Lord God, surely you're
[1:20:54] rich in mercy. Surely you're full of
[1:20:57] compassion.
[1:20:59] We can only stand by your mercy and the
[1:21:02] blood of Jesus Christ our Lord. Thank
[1:21:04] you, God, today for these promises. Let
[1:21:07] these words be written upon the tables
[1:21:10] of the hearts of your people, Lord God.
[1:21:13] As we praise your holy name,
[1:21:18] Lord, one day it's going to be our time
[1:21:20] to say our final words. May we have
[1:21:22] words like this. Thank you Jesus for
[1:21:26] saving a wretch like me. All praise goes
[1:21:30] to the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:21:33] Oh, let my children praise Jesus. Let my
[1:21:36] children's childrens praise Jesus. May
[1:21:38] Jesus be the center of everyone's life.
[1:21:41] May he be magnified. May his name be
[1:21:43] lifted up continually. For our God is a
[1:21:47] God full of compassion. Our God is great
[1:21:51] and his mercy endureth forever.
[1:21:54] Hallelujah. From everlasting to
[1:21:56] everlasting as far as the east is from
[1:21:58] the west, Lord. As high as the heavens
[1:22:02] is above the earth, Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:22:08] So is your mercy to them that fear you,
[1:22:10] Lord God.
[1:22:16] Grant it, Lord God.
[1:22:18] May we have mercy, your mercy. May we
[1:22:21] repent of our sins, God. Give us truth
[1:22:25] in the inward parts. That's what you
[1:22:26] desire. Hallelujah. And that we depart
[1:22:30] from evil
[1:22:31] like David. And surely you'll say,
[1:22:34] "Brother so and so, stagger not at the
[1:22:36] promise of God. Sister so and so,
[1:22:39] stagger not at the promise of God, but
[1:22:41] was strong in faith, giving God glory.
[1:22:45] Let your people be strong in faith and
[1:22:47] give you glory today. Me included in
[1:22:50] Jesus Christ's name.
