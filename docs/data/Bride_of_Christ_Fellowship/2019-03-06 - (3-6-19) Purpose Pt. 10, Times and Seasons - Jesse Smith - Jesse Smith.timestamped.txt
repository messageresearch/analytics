[26:24] an anthem of my heart I know he is yours
[26:26] too I say in our feet here and let's
[26:28] take our Bibles let's go to John chapter
[26:30] five like looking at times and seasons
[26:33] again tonight I kind of sat down to
[26:36] study on those fourteen different
[26:38] seasons but then the Holy Spirit kind of
[26:40] directed me to go read every time
[26:42] brother Branham said times and seasons
[26:44] so there's a hundred and fifty of those
[26:46] I got through twenty-five so I'm gonna
[26:48] preach those 25 tonight so I felt it was
[26:51] the Holy Spirit redirected my thoughts
[26:53] so John chapter five like to look at
[27:07] times and seasons here tonight
[27:08] leave us verses 1 to 8 kind of familiar
[27:11] scripture here John 5 1 through 8 where
[27:23] the RAM uses this text a lot to talk
[27:26] about how God's compassion is different
[27:28] than our compassion always keep the
[27:31] balance though - don't don't forget that
[27:32] there was times jesus healed everyone
[27:35] the Bible says that there was times
[27:37] everyone was healed but then there's a
[27:40] time like this where only one was healed
[27:42] so that again tells us the wisdom of God
[27:45] sometimes God wants to heal everybody
[27:47] sometimes God just wants to heal a few
[27:50] it all depends on his great leadership
[27:51] praise God that's why we got to be
[27:53] constantly looking for the leader the
[27:55] leading of the Lord by God's grace so
[28:01] john 5 the bible says after this there
[28:03] was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went
[28:05] up to Jerusalem now there is at
[28:06] Jerusalem by the Sheep market a pool
[28:08] which is called in the Hebrew tongue
[28:10] Bethesda having five porches in these
[28:13] lay a great multitude of impotent folk a
[28:16] blind halt withered waiting for the
[28:18] moving of the water a notices in verse 4
[28:23] for an angel went down at a certain
[28:25] season in the pool we're looking at
[28:28] times and seasons tonight and troubled
[28:31] the water who sever then first after the
[28:35] troubling of the water stepped in was
[28:37] made whole of whatsoever disease he had
[28:40] and a certain man was there which had an
[28:43] affirmative thirty and eight years
[28:45] that's how old I am I'm 38 but this man
[28:49] had this infirmity for as old as I am
[28:52] when Jesus saw him lie and knew that he
[28:55] had been now a long time in that disease
[28:57] so I guess that means I'm a long time
[28:59] old 38 in that case he saith unto Him
[29:03] wilt thou be made whole
[29:04] I like this how Jesus puts it on his
[29:06] faith will you be made whole the
[29:10] impotent man answered him sir I have no
[29:12] man when the water is troubled to put me
[29:15] into the pool but while I am coming
[29:17] another step it down before me Jesus
[29:21] saying to him rise take up thy bed and
[29:23] walk and immediately the man was made
[29:25] whole and took up his bed and walked and
[29:28] on the same day was the Sabbath praise
[29:31] God let's have a word of Prayer if you
[29:32] have a need on your heart just make a
[29:33] known unto God here tonight I really
[29:36] just felt like the Lord took over my
[29:37] studying this morning and kind of led me
[29:39] to this direction so I'm just trusting
[29:41] the Holy Spirit to bless you
[29:43] speak to you or speak to me and help us
[29:45] here tonight
[29:47] Heavenly Father again we bow our head
[29:49] Lord God we come near reverently we ask
[29:51] that your spirit Lord would have its way
[29:53] help me Lord God to preach Lord your
[29:56] word and father help me to be a true
[29:58] witness Lord God help each person Lord
[30:00] to receive your word and father may it
[30:03] be a word and new season father we pray
[30:05] Lord I felt strangely Lord you
[30:09] redirected my thoughts this way so
[30:11] father just have your way tonight Lord
[30:13] we feel your presence Lord God we're
[30:15] aware Lord that you're here you promised
[30:17] to be here and father have your way
[30:19] tonight Lord have free course have
[30:22] Liberty tonight by the Holy Spirit in
[30:24] Jesus Christ's name and the church said
[30:26] Amen god bless you to be in see the
[30:28] praise the Lord
[30:37] so let's look at this here tonight let's
[30:39] look at this is part ten on the purpose
[30:40] series and like I said I just felt led
[30:44] strangely I was studying on those
[30:46] fourteen seasons for a little while and
[30:50] then all of a sudden it just seemed like
[30:51] the Holy Spirit directed me to go look
[30:54] up for the Rams quotes on times and
[30:56] seasons so let's look at those tonight
[30:58] you can switch over and every ready huh
[31:01] there was all there was a hundred fifty
[31:03] of them so I got through 25
[31:04] so this sermon has about 25 of those
[31:06] quotes so look forward to that I started
[31:09] in 1946 or 47 and kind of worked my way
[31:13] up to 1954 I think is where I left off
[31:15] this morning so let's look at these
[31:18] thoughts here now let's look at brother
[31:21] branham's thoughts on times and seasons
[31:23] now some of these I'll just be bringing
[31:25] a few quotes and then we'll kind of look
[31:27] at a few real in-depth here by God's
[31:29] grace so but hey I'm saying now Jesus
[31:33] here was speaking he said father the
[31:34] time has come now there's seasons for
[31:36] everything do you believe that he said
[31:38] you so in a certain season you reap it a
[31:40] certain season there's seasons when the
[31:42] time comes that's right for things that
[31:44] happen do you believe that the time came
[31:47] one time for God to destroy the world
[31:49] with water and he sent a man by the name
[31:52] of Noah and God got the world ready for
[31:54] judgment the time came for Noah to go
[31:57] into the ark isn't God doing the same
[31:58] thing today he's getting the world ready
[32:00] for a judgment of fire not on a judgment
[32:02] of water but a judgment of fire and he
[32:05] says and when the time of the promise
[32:07] drew nigh so now he moves that now to
[32:10] Moses they're raised up a pharaoh who
[32:12] did not know Joseph why this season was
[32:16] there so for Moses his time and Noah's
[32:19] time both times had to come to the right
[32:21] season and then God could bring forth of
[32:23] Noah and then caught God could bring
[32:26] forth a Moses it had to be the right
[32:29] time because they'd respected Israel
[32:31] that till that time but the season was
[32:34] therefore no more respects that God
[32:37] could shower down his judgments upon the
[32:39] people the time had come
[32:41] remember we're nearing the time when all
[32:43] of Israel I'm sorry Israel is going to
[32:46] be gathered against by every nation
[32:48] I remember that from the Book of Daniel
[32:49] we preach on that a few years ago all
[32:52] nations the Bible said will gather
[32:54] themselves against Israel did you see
[32:56] this week some of the Democrats come out
[32:58] against Israel more forcefully to see
[33:00] that some anti-semitic talk in their
[33:04] real awful but you know that's what the
[33:08] prophecy were under you know thank God
[33:10] some people are for Israel thank God for
[33:12] that but there's gonna come a time just
[33:15] like in these times when all the nations
[33:17] are gonna be against Israel well you and
[33:20] I you and I keep praying for Israel
[33:22] praise God
[33:23] there's blessings if we pray for Israel
[33:25] we know that praise the Lord
[33:27] now the Prophet goes now to the three
[33:29] Hebrew children
[33:30] he said the Hebrew children when they
[33:32] were carried over in Babylon listen the
[33:34] time come when they had to stand for
[33:36] what was right the King made a
[33:38] proclamation he said whosoever will not
[33:41] bow down to the image to be thrown in
[33:42] the fiery furnace the time came for
[33:44] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego to show
[33:46] their colors their faith in God so they
[33:49] turned their back to the image hey hey
[33:52] man getting closer to you and I shown
[33:55] our colors right our true colors you
[33:59] know seems like now like message people
[34:00] just get to kind of hide in our small
[34:02] churches but there's going to come a
[34:04] time when this government is not going
[34:06] to like you and I and we're not gonna be
[34:09] able to hide our faces right they're
[34:11] gonna they're gonna try it like
[34:12] rubberband said last Wednesday we saw it
[34:14] they're gonna bring a mark of the bees
[34:16] and they're gonna ask every Church and
[34:18] demand that every church agree with
[34:20] their mark and you and I are gonna have
[34:23] to show our colors there's not going to
[34:25] be any more hiding after that they're
[34:26] going to be anybody more kind of played
[34:30] it easy we're gonna have to stand we
[34:33] have to bow to the world or if the stand
[34:35] for Christ we have to stand amen amen
[34:38] if you've got on the full armor of God
[34:40] you'll stand Amen that's right now look
[34:45] he said they said God our God is able to
[34:47] deliver us for this fiery furnace but
[34:49] nevertheless will not bow down to the
[34:51] World Council of Churches si like that
[34:55] because that's the image under the
[34:57] beasts will not bow down to the churches
[35:00] uniting with the United States
[35:01] government
[35:01] well not bow down to that he said that
[35:04] it is it was time this season was there
[35:07] so then the time came that when he was
[35:09] going to throw them in the fire furnace
[35:11] burned that religion out of them amen
[35:15] you can't burn the Holy Ghost out of
[35:17] somebody because it's a fire burning
[35:19] inside them amen their Holy Ghost is the
[35:22] true fire they've just got natural fire
[35:25] but we've got real supernatural fire
[35:28] amen to see it was the time and season
[35:31] and but they're not you know you Sunday
[35:34] night you were working but on Sunday
[35:36] night I looked at the number 17 which
[35:37] and I shared your name how you giving me
[35:39] a lot of those deep insights I
[35:41] appreciate that but at the end of that
[35:43] we showed how Paul said in the first
[35:47] Thessalonians 5 that you need not know
[35:51] the times and Caesars you don't need to
[35:53] wonder what the times in season are for
[35:54] the rapture remember that you don't have
[35:56] to wonder about the times and seasons
[35:58] because you and I know it's going to
[36:01] come like a thief in the night and the
[36:03] world is going to be saying peace and
[36:05] safety right and they're going to be
[36:07] overtaken like a thief you and I don't
[36:10] have to worry well what's the time and
[36:11] season like we already know God's given
[36:14] us thus saith the Lord amen we know it's
[36:17] going to come down like a mark now we
[36:19] will be here when it actually gets laid
[36:21] down but we'll be in the part of the
[36:23] squeeze part of it right we'll be a part
[36:26] of that and we'll see the pressure
[36:28] coming up and we'll see the government's
[36:30] uniting with the world countless of
[36:31] churches so we have to wonder what time
[36:34] it is we have to wonder about which side
[36:37] we have to stand on we've got to stand
[36:39] on God's Word amen and we've got to have
[36:42] the full armor of God on because that's
[36:44] what Paul said in first Thessalonians 5
[36:45] if you and I want to stand we've got to
[36:49] put on the full armor of God did you do
[36:50] that this week I did a couple of times
[36:52] this week I got on my knees right in the
[36:54] morning at 4:30 or 5:00 and I said Lord
[36:56] by faith I'm putting on the breastplate
[36:58] of faith you do that this week I hope
[37:02] you do it soon
[37:02] I said by faith Lord I'm putting on the
[37:05] helmet of salvation
[37:06] amen by faith I'm putting on the belt of
[37:11] truth praise God my mind's ready
[37:13] by faith I'm putting
[37:15] the feet shod with the preparation of
[37:16] the gospel of peace by faith I'm picking
[37:19] up the shield of faith amen and my faith
[37:22] I'm taking the word and I rebuke Satan
[37:25] right in my prayer closet amen see
[37:28] that's what we got to do and if we do
[37:30] that if we put on the full armor of God
[37:32] and have the real baptism of the Holy
[37:34] Ghost then the Bible says that we'll be
[37:37] children of the day and we won't be
[37:38] surprised when the rapture comes we'll
[37:41] expect it
[37:44] we'll expect Jesus to return amen that's
[37:48] what a real Christian should have now
[37:51] remember I was listening to this week
[37:52] also this is this week I was listen
[37:54] brother Brian preached of putting on the
[37:55] whole armour of God from 62 remember
[37:58] what he said about Peter he said Peter
[38:00] did it he said he had courage enough to
[38:03] chop a man's ear off but not the real
[38:06] courage to stand up and say I'm one of
[38:08] those that follow Jesus so I hope
[38:12] everybody catches that cuz that really
[38:13] struck my heart in other words you and I
[38:16] could have real courage to defend
[38:18] ourselves with our guns or you know to
[38:21] shut our doors or defend ourselves by
[38:23] throwing stones that's not real courage
[38:26] physical fighting is not real courage
[38:28] the real courage is when your life is on
[38:32] the line and you you you don't deny
[38:34] Christ but you confess Christ that is
[38:37] real courage but have said so net he
[38:40] said Peter and have the real courage so
[38:43] he had to go up to Pentecost get the
[38:45] Holy Ghost and then he had real courage
[38:47] after that how many want real courage in
[38:49] their life see and we get little
[38:51] glimpses how much courage we have
[38:53] especially at work or family functions
[38:55] not so much a church although it's good
[38:57] to have your courage at church but I'm
[38:59] saying it's like when we get tested when
[39:01] we get put to the test when people say
[39:04] now you do you really believe that we
[39:06] get we get little glimpses of how much
[39:08] curves we have if we're born again we'll
[39:10] stand on the word and say yes I believe
[39:12] that the Bible says that amen but if we
[39:16] sure Kawai that we really got to look
[39:19] inside ourselves and say what am I made
[39:21] of am i putting on the full armor of God
[39:23] do I have real spiritual courage because
[39:26] you and I've got
[39:27] have it if we expect to go in the
[39:28] rapture amen see it was the time and
[39:33] season so they had it say our God is
[39:35] able to deliver us from the squeeze but
[39:38] nevertheless even if he does it will not
[39:40] bow down to the will of the government
[39:42] or the will of churches will only obey
[39:45] the will of God is that right so we got
[39:50] to have real courage tonight we got a
[39:51] real courage all the days of our life
[39:55] amen now brother and now goes to Ruth
[39:59] like I said I started 46 or was it 47 I
[40:02] can think was 47 wasn't it then the
[40:04] quote start in 47 yeah I think it was
[40:06] 1947 yeah sorry I keep thinking 46 cuz
[40:09] that's when he got the Commission okay
[40:10] sorry Ruth now this is beautiful look at
[40:14] this this a beautiful quote now let's
[40:15] get the picture right quick why are we
[40:17] running along this line if we can not
[40:19] notice and she would not but she went on
[40:21] and did you notice they only returned in
[40:24] barley season just exactly at the right
[40:27] time when they were gathering barley her
[40:32] timing was perfect
[40:34] Laurie and Boaz was her kinsman and he
[40:38] was harvest in his grape fields the Lord
[40:41] of the harvest and Ruth the young
[40:44] Gleaner went out into the field to glean
[40:47] a look at this a type of the Gentile
[40:50] church gleaning amen
[40:53] picking up just what they could the
[40:56] Gleaners going ahead oh they say you all
[40:59] haven't got the Pentecostal blessing oh
[41:01] yeah we're gleaning all right amen glory
[41:05] you and I are Gleaners we're not coming
[41:09] back you know when there's a big huge
[41:12] harvest we're coming back to glean glory
[41:15] we're coming back just to fly there's
[41:17] last few Souls hallelujah that's what
[41:20] we're back for that's the real Bride of
[41:22] Christ that's our type and we got to be
[41:25] content with that we got to rejoice when
[41:27] we find a few Souls
[41:28] thank God for a few souls we're just
[41:31] cleaning we came at the right time this
[41:33] is God's time for me to clean all these
[41:36] wheat wheat plants amen
[41:38] this is the right time
[41:40] this is what I was called to do because
[41:42] I type truth hey man thank you Lord he
[41:47] said oh say oh they haven't got to see
[41:49] how they doubt us oh you're just a small
[41:51] church
[41:51] oh there's really nothing going on there
[41:53] they said oh yeah we're gleaning all
[41:55] right we've how many do these are souls
[41:58] that we baptized in last few years all
[41:59] those little souls back there we're
[42:01] cleaning all right amen glory amen
[42:07] to see church we just got to be thankful
[42:10] we got to understand that God works
[42:12] everything in his time in season brother
[42:19] him says about Eli he's to notice
[42:21] sometimes in that day like it was now
[42:23] when our prayers are a little bit
[42:24] lingered we become dull sense bound so
[42:27] Zacharias doubted that they could be so
[42:29] he didn't believe it now notice after he
[42:31] had plenty of examples now Sarah and
[42:34] Abraham how old they were when Isaac was
[42:37] born Hannah came to the temple past the
[42:39] age of bearing went to the temple that
[42:41] day to serve God all right so now he's
[42:44] looking at how Zacharias doubted God
[42:46] could give Elizabeth the baby
[42:48] so did Abraham and Sarah Sarah laughed
[42:50] Sarah lie right in God's face right
[42:53] but God was bringing the son of men
[42:55] ministry there to prove to her to
[42:57] discern her heart and prove his word to
[43:00] her isn't that what God is doing to us
[43:02] God sent brother Branham with a sign in
[43:04] discernment and know people make doubt
[43:06] they've though mean we made out though
[43:08] others may doubt God's gonna get Sarah
[43:10] ready God's gonna change her doubting
[43:12] too laughter amen and God is going to
[43:14] bring forth his promised son in this
[43:16] hour amen we believe it praise God what
[43:20] I mean I mean this chart change maybe
[43:22] not this decade maybe not this 50 year
[43:24] period maybe not even this generation
[43:26] but in this church age God is going to
[43:28] bring forth the bride that's right amen
[43:32] look what he says probably the women
[43:34] holding up to Shiloh now now he gets to
[43:36] Eli and Hannah maybe to see what kind of
[43:39] hats won another war but not Hannah so
[43:42] Hannah Hannah then go to church and look
[43:43] at everybody's clothes she went up with
[43:46] something in her heart she wanted to
[43:48] talk to God amen
[43:51] and she prayed in such a deep since
[43:53] - the priest misunderstood er like today
[43:57] sometimes were called fanatics because
[43:59] we pray and cried to God
[44:00] we're not fanatics were just
[44:02] misunderstood that's all ah thank you
[44:06] lord amen but when he thought he was
[44:09] drunk so Eli thought Hannah was drunk
[44:11] they did the same thing on Pentecost
[44:14] they do the same thing today she said
[44:15] she was not drunk but she was praying
[44:18] God take her away her approach he
[44:20] blessed her and as soon as she received
[44:23] the blessing from the priest noticed
[44:24] didn't wait now God could have put the
[44:26] baby in her arms right then you know I'm
[44:30] not gonna say the name but somebody
[44:32] recently was telling me about a former
[44:33] pastor they used to had and this pastor
[44:36] basically blasting the Holy Ghost and
[44:38] said that speaking in tongues and that
[44:40] crying at the altar and that shoutings
[44:42] all of the devil and it wasn't long
[44:44] after that he got cancer and died one of
[44:47] my friends was telling me that I'm not
[44:49] gonna name the names but that's a
[44:51] reality amen God demands respect search
[44:56] praise God and if we can just give the
[44:59] right respect to God don't you think
[45:01] we'll see more of God don't you think so
[45:04] like brother can't preach on the
[45:06] heavenly places
[45:07] who's going to create that atmosphere
[45:08] it's not going to happen on its own it's
[45:10] going to be sons and daughters of God
[45:12] who come to church expect him to talk to
[45:15] God just like Hannah did amen Oh glory
[45:22] like I heard one time well I told you
[45:25] one time Simon was at a meeting and one
[45:29] of the women there he was talking about
[45:32] serpent seed he was telling about Surma
[45:33] seed and when the women she she walked
[45:36] out of that meeting and said they'll say
[45:37] the Lord serpent seeds of the devil and
[45:39] it wasn't long after that her husband
[45:41] came down with Parkinson's and still
[45:43] struggles with it greatly today and then
[45:46] that same church had about twenty people
[45:48] die in the next year or two and they
[45:51] knew man and I know I know people that
[45:53] were going there they knew something was
[45:54] going on wrong see you don't speak
[45:57] against God's Word if you don't know you
[46:00] just should leave it alone you should
[46:01] just have respects praise God
[46:06] we gotta respect the Holy Ghost gospel
[46:08] you and I have to believe maybe God can
[46:11] feel somebody with the Holy Ghost
[46:12] tonight a man could be one these little
[46:14] ones hey we gotta just love God we just
[46:17] gotta love worship we just got to praise
[46:19] the name of the Lord and get out of our
[46:22] tiredness or get out of our complacency
[46:23] say we're sorry repent and get right
[46:26] with God get our garments wash and just
[46:28] worship God the way he needs to be
[46:30] worshiped amen we should not we should
[46:34] have to have people pump us up into that
[46:36] we should go in the prayer closet and
[46:37] the Holy Ghost should pump itself out of
[46:40] its out of our lives and it should when
[46:44] we pray should be God just pumping us up
[46:46] with Morris Perry praise God if it's a
[46:50] man or a woman singing a special if that
[46:53] has to pump us up something's wrong
[46:55] praise God our own walk with Christ our
[46:58] personal walk with Christ should stir us
[47:01] up amen
[47:03] that's right church like brother like
[47:08] brother man you know was right after
[47:09] brother cam left i Sabri it was reading
[47:12] a quote by brother Branham and he said
[47:13] no Minister can pack a revival in their
[47:16] briefcase brother cam can't bring a
[47:19] revival I can't bring a revival but Ram
[47:22] says you bring a revival you each one of
[47:26] us have to bring a revival from our
[47:28] homes amen
[47:30] so I guess I'm bringing the revival from
[47:32] my prayers this week I hope you are too
[47:35] I hope you are too because that's how
[47:38] we're supposed to get revived be
[47:40] dedicated in a home be dedicated all day
[47:42] bring that same dedication to church and
[47:44] gods right there with us amen here in
[47:46] the church yes it's a revival it's a
[47:50] strengthening God strengthens us in our
[47:53] home and then that overflows to the
[47:54] church that's right amen
[47:58] Oh God sent us a revival preacher send
[48:00] us the Holy Ghost in our house that's
[48:02] really the revival preacher we need amen
[48:05] we don't have a guest preacher for a few
[48:08] more weeks but doesn't really matter we
[48:09] can have a revival tonight you can have
[48:11] a revival on Sunday we could have at any
[48:13] time we would God send us a revival in
[48:15] our homes
[48:17] that's the whole key to it that's the O
[48:20] key to it she said she's not drunk and
[48:27] it was not drunk she was praying to God
[48:29] to take away a reproach he blessed her
[48:32] and as soon as she received the blessing
[48:33] from the priest notice didn't wait now
[48:35] God could have put the baby in her arms
[48:37] right then but she went home happy
[48:39] knowing that in due season God would
[48:42] bring it to pass
[48:43] oh yeah that's the kind of people we
[48:47] need today taking God at His Word
[48:50] hallelujah
[48:51] how many one say God had his work
[48:52] tonight I do too
[48:54] and then he doubted to be so but God's
[48:58] going to confirm his word don't you
[49:00] worry God's able these stones the right
[49:02] children Abraham said John now watch
[49:03] then all that what taking place God was
[49:06] sure to bring it to pass because it was
[49:08] at the season at the time his words
[49:10] every cog must fit the same place when
[49:14] their prophetic wheels began to roll
[49:16] together it's got to happen amen the
[49:19] prophetic wheels rolling together it's
[49:22] got to happen now this was our text the
[49:25] healing from John 5:1 to 8 now look what
[49:29] Burnett says he says nothing look there
[49:31] letting a man over there on a pallet or
[49:33] little cut for 38 years now here comes
[49:37] Jesus coming down bias this market and
[49:39] as he passed through the buy the market
[49:41] he goes down amongst these sick crippled
[49:43] people do you believe he was kind
[49:45] hearted do you believe he was loving do
[49:49] you believe he had compassion on the
[49:50] people then why did he heal all those
[49:52] sick people there and you imagine that
[49:55] church can you imagine that
[49:58] it's just like going to the hospital
[49:59] when was last time you went to the
[50:00] hospital I went a couple months ago
[50:02] think about all those rooms that passed
[50:04] right that's kind of what Jesus did he
[50:08] just walked past all those people that
[50:09] sick of infirmity and he went to one man
[50:12] who been sick for 38 years was how many
[50:16] believe Jesus was kind-hearted how many
[50:18] believe that how many believe he was
[50:20] loving I do do my hands up but instead
[50:24] of that he went by the blind man he
[50:26] passed the withered man he passed the
[50:28] crippled child he
[50:30] ask the child he went over to a
[50:34] man that had an infirmity let's say
[50:35] sugar diabetes or something other he had
[50:38] at 38 years he walked over that man and
[50:40] knew not now that he'd been a long time
[50:42] that way he said will you be made hope
[50:43] he said sir now he wasn't crippled he
[50:46] said well I'm coming down to the water
[50:48] somebody can stop him before me and they
[50:50] get healed so every time he went up to
[50:52] get healed and the next time happen
[50:58] again here oh no Saddam somebody how
[51:02] would you feel that happened here you
[51:05] come up her prayer you're trying to
[51:07] sneak up for prayer and all of a sudden
[51:09] somebody steps right in front yeah you
[51:12] go back to your seat thank God it's not
[51:14] like that in our church to be hidden but
[51:17] that's how it was Angel's heal and
[51:20] they're angels that they had this
[51:22] commission from god you're just healing
[51:24] the first person that still be wouldn't
[51:27] that still be merciful though at least
[51:29] they had divine healing right a lot of
[51:31] churches don't like divine healing or
[51:33] reject divine healing don't believe in
[51:35] it at least the Jews had divine healing
[51:37] by way of angel he said somebody just
[51:42] kept getting the blessing before I did
[51:44] the angel only had one blessing and I
[51:46] just can't get after all these years he
[51:51] said just only one at a time and then
[51:53] the angel they waited again for another
[51:55] season maybe a month or whatever it was
[51:58] for a certain season oh I didn't get a
[52:01] blessing this month my it's March I
[52:03] didn't get the blessing maybe I'll get
[52:05] it in April wow what a sad well is that
[52:09] a sad condition to be in church you and
[52:12] I don't have to be like that do we
[52:15] now it may be God doing that for us
[52:18] right but it don't have to be like that
[52:21] in other words God can heal more than
[52:23] one person a month and the church said
[52:25] see it don't have to be like that now
[52:27] God may be dealing with you for a longer
[52:30] or not like we said last week maybe
[52:31] another month wait maybe God may be
[52:33] dealing with you like that but what I'm
[52:35] saying is God's not limiting his holy
[52:38] spirit to just one person healed a year
[52:40] here our sister who experienced
[52:43] something I
[52:43] our experience in all these years she
[52:45] felt a holy wind come in hit her and
[52:47] then Amen said she's so well he said I'm
[52:50] still struggling with my sickness but
[52:51] she's completely made whole
[52:53] that's a holy wind now thank God that
[52:56] happened to Sunday nights ago but that
[52:59] don't have to we don't have to wait till
[53:00] April for that to happen again
[53:01] it can happen tonight praise God that's
[53:04] what I'm trying to say like we don't
[53:06] have to say well maybe next month we do
[53:07] you know what the limit God let's not
[53:09] limit the Holy One of Israel let's
[53:11] believe the Holy One is let's let him be
[53:15] unlimited let's ask God to raise our
[53:18] faith that all things are possible to
[53:20] them that believe amen
[53:23] he said he come down again he said while
[53:26] I'm coming someone else step said to me
[53:27] and Jesus said take up that bed and go
[53:29] to that house go on and he walked right
[53:31] away he left that great crowd of people
[53:32] laying there lame halt line withered
[53:35] impotent is that Scripture well here it
[53:37] is I'm reading right off it walked right
[53:39] away from there now Church I don't know
[53:46] about you but it seems like Jesus would
[53:48] heal everybody maybe out in the away
[53:51] from the big cities or maybe there was
[53:54] other cities for eg of people but a
[53:56] scene like in Jerusalem there was so
[53:58] much unbelief that it hindered his
[54:00] miraculous miracles you know they all
[54:03] follow the Pharisees and they all fall
[54:05] under there their fear tactics right all
[54:08] those fear tactics just like the treaty
[54:10] internat Aaron's trying to say oh you
[54:13] don't you don't confess a Trinity you're
[54:15] going to hell it's not easy to do a fear
[54:16] tactic on you they say trying to explain
[54:19] it and you lose your mind but try deny
[54:22] it you lose your soul that's just a mere
[54:23] tack right same thing here
[54:27] oh you will even that rabbi Messiah oh
[54:29] you're going to him and so there was a
[54:31] reason
[54:32] in some places everybody could heal
[54:34] everybody could be healed ah you can
[54:37] hear it on tape where brother Graham
[54:38] says you can hear him praying if people
[54:40] get healed up in the discernments like
[54:41] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[54:43] forever in 63 one person gets here and
[54:46] he tells another one to rise up from the
[54:48] from the cotton he said why don't you
[54:49] rise up and walk
[54:50] and everybody starts shouting embracing
[54:52] God and everybody just receives her heal
[54:54] amen and other times nobody gets healed
[54:58] all right the gift can operate because
[55:01] of unbelief
[55:02] same thing with Jesus except he heal way
[55:05] more than anybody could ever imagine
[55:06] right because no books on the earth
[55:08] could even handle all the books of all
[55:10] the things that Jesus did right so it's
[55:15] interesting he can walk in here by the
[55:18] Solomon's porch and heal one man and
[55:20] leave all the rest lying there and yet
[55:24] he's a kind-hearted God that's true
[55:29] now if we went was in such a hurry I
[55:31] read it but you scholars understand
[55:33] there was lying underneath porches
[55:35] haen't lame hot blind withered waiting
[55:37] for the moving of the water for an angel
[55:40] to come down in a certain season trouble
[55:41] the water
[55:42] the first one stepping in just when it's
[55:44] on what every two or three months he
[55:46] says but the first one stepping in after
[55:51] the troubling of the water was made
[55:53] whole of what summer disease he had is
[55:56] that right amen
[55:57] now you've reached it last week brother
[55:59] Branham said he said Lord I just come
[56:02] business every once in a while to let us
[56:04] know we're still walking with you
[56:05] remember that quote I believe in that
[56:07] too
[56:07] like I said in other words I'm not gonna
[56:10] say well God you have if I don't see a
[56:12] miracle this week or next week I'm
[56:13] giving up on my faith I'm not I'm not
[56:15] gonna treat God like that so we respect
[56:18] it and we respect the God heals at his
[56:22] season we just don't want to limit this
[56:24] season that God wants to heal in other
[56:27] words we don't want to miss God's
[56:28] healing season praise the Lord I think
[56:32] you feel that way too don't you I don't
[56:34] want to miss the season where God can do
[56:35] something in my life that's right now
[56:40] let's look at this saw a little bit
[56:42] further healing in seasons because this
[56:48] is kind of dealing with our church now
[56:50] we can start applying this to our church
[56:52] and our life healing God does healing in
[56:56] season now let me turn there before I
[56:58] forget in Ecclesiastes 3 because there's
[57:00] a beautiful scripture there we read on
[57:02] Sunday
[57:08] please ask these chapter 3 alright now
[57:17] there's a scripture about there's a time
[57:19] to heal let me find that there yeah
[57:24] verse 3 there's a time to kill and a
[57:27] time to heal a time to break down and a
[57:30] time to build up so the Bible tells us
[57:34] plainly there's a time to kill and then
[57:37] there's a time to heal so there's a time
[57:40] and season for every purpose under
[57:41] heaven aren't you glad God heals you
[57:44] Church I'm begging for those seasons
[57:47] when God heals me usually I got to get
[57:49] sick though to experience the healing
[57:51] well Bank over those seasons of God's
[57:53] healing his member again the Bible said
[57:57] an angel went down at a certain season
[57:59] not every season but a certain season
[58:02] and this is what I found even when you
[58:05] know sister tiny got healed the Holy
[58:08] Spirit was just anointing us for healing
[58:10] for that season like Aaron's heart from
[58:13] that one night where you came up for
[58:14] prayer you said God instantly he'll feel
[58:16] better yes and these all happen within a
[58:20] matter of like a few weeks or months or
[58:21] it was a season it was a season of
[58:24] healing and then our sister who you know
[58:27] a couple months later we move on a few
[58:29] more months to February 2019 we just
[58:33] wait a few more months and God does
[58:35] another healing so it's at a certain
[58:37] season and I remember when Tanya got
[58:40] healed I remember that day before I was
[58:44] studying on something else and the Holy
[58:45] Spirit just totally changed my sermon
[58:47] and brought me to the keys of the
[58:49] kingdom I was even plan on preaching it
[58:50] I think I've never seen that before the
[58:51] service and I prayed for right here and
[58:55] I saw I took the keys of the kingdom and
[58:57] I rebuked the devil in Jesus name may
[58:59] she be made well I don't know what I
[59:01] think was the next day God and touched
[59:02] her it rose that night while she was
[59:04] singing the worshipping and cooking
[59:05] dinner God healed her arm and she could
[59:07] raise her arm again amen you know church
[59:10] one time the same thing happening at
[59:11] Pennsylvania a few years ago I was there
[59:14] preaching and I was preaching a sermon
[59:16] on our face seeking out space and
[59:20] maybe to preach on Jezebel and how she
[59:24] painted her face
[59:26] this was so strange and there was a one
[59:29] of the back foot pads on and makeup on
[59:31] her face an older woman and all of a
[59:35] sudden while I was preaching
[59:37] she just started raising up her hand
[59:39] prays to the Lord oh that's wonderful
[59:41] I just want to freeze a sermon couple
[59:43] people came up for prayer raised for
[59:44] them well walk out and talk to the
[59:46] pastor under service he said god bless
[59:48] you he said brother Jesse I want to tell
[59:49] you a little testimony why you were
[59:51] preaching that woman with makeup on she
[59:54] said she came into church and she
[59:56] couldn't raise her arm and she said all
[59:58] of a sudden she felt somebody tap her on
[1:00:00] the shoulder and she looked and she
[1:00:03] thought it was her husband it wasn't her
[1:00:04] husband she looked over it wasn't her
[1:00:06] husband tapping on the shoulder she's
[1:00:08] the all of a sudden her shoulders
[1:00:09] started feeling good she started raising
[1:00:11] her arm that she couldn't raise before
[1:00:12] and that was the reason she was waving
[1:00:14] it during the service God healed her
[1:00:17] shoulder while I'm preaching the word
[1:00:19] now she never came back after that we
[1:00:21] never heard from her again but to me it
[1:00:24] was God showing her that she should not
[1:00:26] paint her face and indicate that I was
[1:00:29] preaching the truth God healed her
[1:00:31] shoulder that's the twice that happened
[1:00:36] where a woman could God's God here on
[1:00:38] the shoulder right when I was preaching
[1:00:39] the word and God raised faith for the
[1:00:41] healing but you know what it came in a
[1:00:44] certain season that woman never came and
[1:00:48] any other season back to the church as
[1:00:49] far as I know it was just for that
[1:00:51] service praise God
[1:00:54] amen and so God wants us to be ready at
[1:01:00] the right season right now look what
[1:01:04] program says he said God's got a time
[1:01:06] for all things
[1:01:07] we play he's got a time we plant corn a
[1:01:10] time we that we plow corn then at that
[1:01:12] time we harvest the corn the spring
[1:01:14] rains come to drop through the summer
[1:01:16] the fall rains the snows you just can't
[1:01:19] say I plant my wheat today and tomorrow
[1:01:21] go out and harvest it same things true
[1:01:23] well I'm gonna plant my faith today to
[1:01:25] see my grandpa Seder my my dad or mom
[1:01:28] Savior or I'm gonna see my son or
[1:01:30] daughter steak well hope to see them
[1:01:32] same tomorrow we can't
[1:01:33] expect that it's gotta be the right
[1:01:35] season 13 oh gods encouraging me tonight
[1:01:39] amen Thank You Lord amen you can't just
[1:01:42] walk out I plan it yesterday oh I'm
[1:01:44] gonna get some wheat tomorrow that's not
[1:01:46] how God works now doesn't work in the
[1:01:48] natural that way so God usually doesn't
[1:01:50] work in the spiritual that way God has x
[1:01:55] for season he has seasons for his word
[1:01:59] he has times in the scripture here where
[1:02:01] it said and the presence of the Lord was
[1:02:03] there to heal the sick how many let's
[1:02:06] the scripture in Luke chapter 5 that's
[1:02:10] when Jesus was ministering to at the
[1:02:13] Friends of the Lord was there to heal
[1:02:16] the sick maybe at other times the
[1:02:19] Friends of the Lord wasn't there to heal
[1:02:21] the sick and we found out that God works
[1:02:23] everything seasonally a man and now in
[1:02:29] Moses what he failed to do was the time
[1:02:31] living on God now I'm not gonna get to
[1:02:33] Moses I'm gonna just dwell on this stuff
[1:02:35] and it came to pass on a certain day as
[1:02:38] he was teaching there were Pharisees and
[1:02:40] doctors of Lawson Iman which would come
[1:02:42] out of every town of Galilee and Judea
[1:02:43] Jerusalem and the power the Lord was
[1:02:46] present some people say of apologizing
[1:02:52] you're just doing some teaching so
[1:02:54] there's nothing there's no anointing
[1:02:55] there to heal the sick let me tell you
[1:02:57] friend let me encourage you brother
[1:02:59] sister even if the pastor's teaching the
[1:03:02] word the power of the presence of the
[1:03:04] Holy Ghost can still be present studying
[1:03:12] the Word of God because teaching is just
[1:03:15] one of the five gifts it's just one of
[1:03:17] them there's four other and Jesus Christ
[1:03:20] had power to heal even while he was
[1:03:23] teaching the people hey man oh yeah some
[1:03:28] people have criticized me well all you
[1:03:30] do too much teach and or you do too much
[1:03:32] of that I just brushed it off it just
[1:03:34] goes water off my back
[1:03:36] right I've got off a duck's back or a
[1:03:37] Dean goes back everyone is saying
[1:03:39] because it's not scriptural what
[1:03:42] Scripture is that God will heal us and
[1:03:44] his ordained season amen
[1:03:46] and whether it's teaching or whether
[1:03:49] it's prophesy or whatever it is we're
[1:03:52] brothers just rebuking sin getting
[1:03:54] people to repent whatever it is it all
[1:03:56] depends on God's season that's right is
[1:04:01] that the state the Word of God that's
[1:04:03] not my thought that's your prophet
[1:04:05] saying that and then that's the Bible
[1:04:06] saying it was teachers see I didn't
[1:04:08] highlight teaching because I didn't
[1:04:09] strike me this morning like it didn't
[1:04:11] now that's why I turn he just can't be
[1:04:14] critical god help us to just not be
[1:04:16] critical help us to be open to receiving
[1:04:18] fresh revelation from the Holy Spirit
[1:04:20] like this morning I was a little bit
[1:04:23] upset that man who emailed me and said I
[1:04:26] was a rich young ruler he called me the
[1:04:29] rich young ruler
[1:04:30] I'm just meditating on the word you know
[1:04:32] because I teach a few things about the
[1:04:35] serpent see that that brother Graham
[1:04:36] doesn't specifically say that's because
[1:04:40] brother Graham and I showed this
[1:04:41] gentlemen there's a few quotes about man
[1:04:43] says he just has their contradictory
[1:04:45] which is that's we all know that you
[1:04:47] know there's times the Prophet learn
[1:04:49] more and change his teaching so he
[1:04:54] doesn't believe for the serpent seed
[1:04:56] this brother doesn't believe that Adam
[1:04:59] knew his wife in Genesis chapter 3 he
[1:05:03] doesn't believe that the fruit she went
[1:05:05] and took and gave the Adam was another
[1:05:06] act but I do believe it was because God
[1:05:09] said there's two seeds in genesis 3:15
[1:05:12] already I'm gonna put mg between thy
[1:05:14] seed and her seed so there's already two
[1:05:17] seeds well he doesn't believe that well
[1:05:19] anyways he calls me the rich young ruler
[1:05:21] and he says you're you're so popular
[1:05:24] because of your false teaching just like
[1:05:25] the rich young ruler I said sir
[1:05:27] I said I'm the least popular preacher I
[1:05:30] know he said we have 29 thousand views
[1:05:34] on your Surrency I said that might be
[1:05:36] right but I've got a small dwindling
[1:05:38] Church which is okay you know because
[1:05:44] God's got a season for everything and I
[1:05:49] said I'm not making any more money I
[1:05:51] don't have to I have to beat people and
[1:05:54] make them sit you know we don't we don't
[1:05:56] have an overflow room because we're so
[1:05:58] popular
[1:06:00] you know I'm just being honest you
[1:06:03] understand what I'm saying like I'm not
[1:06:04] discouraged I'm just trying to be honest
[1:06:06] with this guy
[1:06:06] I said I'm not getting more popular I'm
[1:06:11] not making more money I'm not here I'm
[1:06:13] not getting more people in our church
[1:06:14] preaching the Serpent's eat is not
[1:06:16] making me more popular is actually just
[1:06:18] making me more or less popular and
[1:06:20] that's okay that's how Jesus was
[1:06:22] that's how brother Branham was that's
[1:06:23] how Paul was that's how I'm gonna be too
[1:06:25] and I'm okay with that
[1:06:28] but here's what the Holy Spirit brought
[1:06:30] to me the oice first said remember
[1:06:31] brother Branham said serpents see does
[1:06:34] not pertain the salvation
[1:06:35] so even if I'm wrong which I believe I'm
[1:06:39] right I don't leave I'm wrong
[1:06:41] even if I'm wrong and he said look at
[1:06:44] all those people that you're leading
[1:06:45] astray on serpents eat I said even if
[1:06:48] I'm wrong
[1:06:49] serpents see does not pertain to
[1:06:51] salvation brother Branham said it
[1:06:53] doesn't save you and he said it doesn't
[1:06:55] condemn you anybody want to read that
[1:06:58] raise your hand is anybody wanna read
[1:07:00] that I can show it to you okay I already
[1:07:02] got it
[1:07:02] okay good I don't have to show that so
[1:07:04] see that's unsafe like people
[1:07:06] misunderstandings they make some doctors
[1:07:08] major dr. Manson you can never measure
[1:07:11] on a minor back and I said with all the
[1:07:14] grace of my heart appreciate your ideas
[1:07:17] but I said I believe you have an heir
[1:07:19] and I believe you're making a minor a
[1:07:22] major and I said I don't believe I'm the
[1:07:25] rich a ruler I just believe I'm a
[1:07:27] faithful servant to Christ amen but see
[1:07:32] teaching see you know people get real
[1:07:34] critical but we have to be I have to
[1:07:36] understand that love will conquer all
[1:07:38] that right praise God I didn't leave the
[1:07:43] word to become rich
[1:07:46] I left riches I left the world to follow
[1:07:48] Christ I see myself more in James and
[1:07:52] Peter and John than I do the rich young
[1:07:55] ruler but that's again my opinion I
[1:07:58] believe that's my testimony but see the
[1:08:01] power of God can be here to t even know
[1:08:05] why he's teaching you God can give us
[1:08:07] power to teach you can empower me to
[1:08:09] teach and it can give you power to
[1:08:10] receive healing that's right
[1:08:13] so it's the right attitude now look at
[1:08:17] this have you ever thought of this type
[1:08:19] Saints never thought about this this is
[1:08:22] an ecclesiastic chapter one one
[1:08:23] generation passes away another
[1:08:25] generation cometh but the earth abideth
[1:08:26] forever
[1:08:27] the Sun Also Rises and the Sun go down
[1:08:29] and hastens to his place where he arose
[1:08:31] doesn't seem like that let the Sun just
[1:08:33] gets faster faster let it seem like your
[1:08:35] life's going faster and faster it does
[1:08:37] for me and about you the wind go toward
[1:08:41] the south and turneth about unto the
[1:08:44] north it worlds about continually and
[1:08:47] the wind returneth again according to is
[1:08:49] what circuits are we know the wind has
[1:08:53] paths in circuits let me know that so do
[1:08:56] the waves in the ocean they all follow a
[1:08:59] circuit Debra's trying to see where I'm
[1:09:01] going on this healing comes in seasons
[1:09:07] because I know somebody who preached his
[1:09:09] first doctrine ever was on the baptism
[1:09:13] the Holy Ghost
[1:09:13] and that man was the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:16] he said Marvel not a son of the must be
[1:09:19] born again the wind bloweth where it
[1:09:22] listeth so what is the Holy Ghost like
[1:09:26] it unto the wind how does the wind blow
[1:09:46] [Applause]
[1:09:50] go get discouraged if you don't feel it
[1:09:53] or we'll hear another testimony for a
[1:09:54] while don't get discouraged the wind he
[1:09:57] said so is everyone that's born of the
[1:10:00] Spirit ha ha ha amen thank the Lord
[1:10:05] now you can't tell what it's coming you
[1:10:08] just got to be ready when it's coming I
[1:10:11] mean honestly I believe flow right
[1:10:14] I've even hit sister Naomi and who at
[1:10:16] the same time does she scream at the
[1:10:18] same time she got hit by the wind amen
[1:10:22] you don't know it is coming you can't
[1:10:24] tell well will it be
[1:10:26] the morning service or evening or
[1:10:27] Wednesday night if you can't tell but

[1:10:34] if it comes back inside I want to be
[1:10:36] there when it happens hey man I don't
[1:10:41] know which service Malachi Liddy's going
[1:10:43] to get the Holy Ghost but I'm gonna be
[1:10:45] there and every one of them praise God
[1:10:46] and then I can say I was there wind
[1:10:57] travels in circuits and he's going to
[1:11:00] show up pretty soon again thank you
[1:11:04] thank you Jesus for your word that's
[1:11:07] right

[1:11:13] cold he says we could ask we would ask
[1:11:17] to bless our dear pastor brother Neville

[1:13:57] amen the hard times and people left and
[1:14:01] we felt all alone and people fell away
[1:14:03] and people we baptized wouldn't serve
[1:14:05] God all these things but look at that
[1:14:07] there's Jesus the one that we were
[1:14:08] serving the whole time ha ha ha ha
[1:14:10] amen that'd be wonderful just a look and
[1:14:15] see his features now program says this
[1:14:22] is a new quote now in this city tonight
[1:14:24] I think there's 2 or 3 more of I was
[1:14:26] going on on healing services we're not
[1:14:28] here to be competitors of those brethren
[1:14:30] we're only here to do our part and we're
[1:14:32] believing God and asking to help all the
[1:14:34] sick and afflicted everywhere where
[1:14:36] people are praying for the sick in every
[1:14:38] Church and every denomination
[1:14:40] we believe that God will hear the prayer
[1:14:43] of any sincere person that we believe
[1:14:44] and there's no other man that's a divine
[1:14:46] healer
[1:14:46] we're just ministers of the gospel to
[1:14:48] preach the braveness say God's divine
[1:14:50] healer and
[1:14:51] God can do for you he did it in Jesus
[1:14:53] Christ your work of redemption for soul
[1:14:55] and body is completed even to your
[1:14:59] rapture is already completed and with
[1:15:02] Jesus rose from the dead God justified
[1:15:04] justified by faith believing that God
[1:15:06] rose enough from the dead and we are
[1:15:08] waiting for the rapture which will come
[1:15:10] everything will happen and sees that our
[1:15:12] salvation our healing and everything was
[1:15:15] completed when Jesus died at Calvary
[1:15:22] how many can look back on your salvation
[1:15:25] and see my I can understand that was the
[1:15:27] real season for me to get saved I can
[1:15:29] see him perfectly for mine I had to be
[1:15:31] away from my church God brought me three
[1:15:33] hours away from everybody my mom dropped
[1:15:35] me off I told you story many times I
[1:15:37] felt all alone just 3-4 months after
[1:15:39] that I gave my heart to the Lord
[1:15:41] God had to separate me that was the
[1:15:43] right season for me to get saved right
[1:15:45] and then for healing and then for
[1:15:49] everything everything comes at the right
[1:15:51] time and season because God's ordained
[1:15:53] your seasons oh that's right see healing
[1:15:58] happens in seasons now how to remember
[1:16:04] this story there's a woman that that
[1:16:06] died a young mother got it here and then
[1:16:10] she died and brother Graham said Lord
[1:16:13] you owe me understanding how many member
[1:16:14] that story well the woman that died her
[1:16:19] family was known to brother and he said
[1:16:21] they were real friends but but just one
[1:16:23] of those kinds of people that when
[1:16:25] revival is going on they will come to
[1:16:28] church I'm sure we've had some of those
[1:16:32] and I'm sure other churches some
[1:16:34] churches have people that could go to
[1:16:35] church only when there's guest preachers
[1:16:38] or they'll only come to church really
[1:16:41] excited they'll only pull on the word
[1:16:43] when there's a guest preacher there and
[1:16:46] the church said right because he said
[1:16:50] one of those kind of people that can
[1:16:52] only come to church when the revival is
[1:16:53] going on people are excited people just
[1:16:55] got healed by their testimonies some
[1:16:58] people can only come to church during
[1:16:59] revival season but when the revival was
[1:17:02] off and the
[1:17:04] load was polling nobody would pull all
[1:17:10] the children was here on the cradle roll
[1:17:12] and we had our classes and things so see
[1:17:15] church even a brand's a vertical there
[1:17:17] was times and seeds the good services
[1:17:18] and other times where feels like I'm
[1:17:20] just pulling I'm just trying to pull
[1:17:23] then I just use this as an illustration
[1:17:26] tonight this is a little more for that
[1:17:28] sometimes you come to church and you
[1:17:30] feel like this I'm just trying to pull
[1:17:33] the hammer over I have a good service
[1:17:35] that feels hard doesn't it and there's
[1:17:44] other times it's just so easy it's just
[1:17:47] so easy to have a good service right
[1:17:50] there's other times like somebody
[1:17:52] helping the preacher I could always know
[1:18:03] the difference because when it's when
[1:18:06] people are following my just flows out
[1:18:08] and everybody's into it praise the Lord
[1:18:10] and doesn't matter if you heard me
[1:18:11] preach your name's honors God's presence
[1:18:13] there and the pole is all but there's
[1:18:17] other times when people are really
[1:18:19] pulling or they're tired which I'm tired
[1:18:22] sometimes dude it just feels like I
[1:18:25] gotta get to the end of the service
[1:18:28] somebody help me polish some people can
[1:18:37] only come to church when there's revival
[1:18:41] on ok it was a nice illustration I
[1:18:46] wasn't planning on doing that some
[1:18:51] people can only come to church when it's
[1:18:53] revival and they're really excited but
[1:18:55] then there's other people that will come
[1:18:57] all the time I'm gonna be one of those
[1:18:59] that come all the time oh as soon as I
[1:19:03] return from California the Lord willing
[1:19:04] what the Branham tabernacle needs is a
[1:19:07] revival they need to revival in a
[1:19:11] filling of the Holy Ghost and that's
[1:19:13] what the great need of the tabernacle
[1:19:14] some of the finest people in the world
[1:19:15] comes here what we need is that
[1:19:18] Moli goes church I'd say the same thing
[1:19:20] what we need is everyone baptized with
[1:19:24] the Holy Ghost right right is that right
[1:19:28] because then when you got the baptism
[1:19:31] all he goes but America says you're not
[1:19:34] living in the outer Court where you're
[1:19:36] down and out of the time or even the
[1:19:37] holy place you're living in the Friends
[1:19:39] of God and if you're living in the
[1:19:41] presence of God that you manifest the
[1:19:43] presence of God amen
[1:19:46] see so the brand tabernacle would go
[1:19:49] through seasons to hot cold hot cold now
[1:19:55] that's finishing the quote but he's
[1:19:57] talking about giving instructions and
[1:19:58] had prayer meetings to receive the Holy
[1:20:00] Ghost the resurrection of Lazarus now
[1:20:07] let me skip to the court I want to get
[1:20:08] to here now brother man and this quote
[1:20:12] says that Lazarus was a scribe how many
[1:20:14] he said that Lazarus was a scribe and he
[1:20:18] had a good character he's very religious
[1:20:20] in a standing Mary and Martha did
[1:20:23] needlework and tapestries and he said at
[1:20:28] this time when Lazarus had died Jesus
[1:20:30] foster father Joseph I suppose was gone
[1:20:33] and Jesus had to come and dwell with
[1:20:35] them and he become so famous to his work
[1:20:37] just about scattered a place where he
[1:20:38] had to go away now he was living it had
[1:20:40] to come to season so Lazarus miracle
[1:20:44] happened at a specific time and season
[1:20:48] he says everything comes right in its
[1:20:52] season do you believe that you plant the
[1:20:54] wheat in the fall of the year in the
[1:20:56] spring of the year it brings itself
[1:20:57] forth or God brings it forth and you
[1:20:59] plant the corn in the spring in the fall
[1:21:01] you harvest it everything has its time
[1:21:03] just like his life
[1:21:04] it had its beginning as that's best part
[1:21:06] and it had a shadow as he closes you
[1:21:09] gots that you've got a beginning part
[1:21:11] then you've got your best part and then
[1:21:14] your life ends like a shadow he says our
[1:21:22] ministries becomes the same brethren it
[1:21:26] has our best our beginning our middle
[1:21:29] part the best then close
[1:21:33] your life starts as a baby then your
[1:21:36] adolescence then the middle age then
[1:21:37] closes same as the Sun rise in the east
[1:21:39] and sets over the West everything is
[1:21:41] beginning and ending how many would it
[1:21:43] be at their best at some time there's a
[1:21:48] season for you to be your best
[1:21:51] spiritually there's a season remember
[1:22:01] what the Bible said about John the
[1:22:03] Baptist Jesus tell him about John the
[1:22:04] Baptist he was a burning and shining
[1:22:06] light and you were willing for a season
[1:22:09] to rejoice in his light they just
[1:22:11] rejoiced for a season what was it Church
[1:22:14] six months oh they're going right there
[1:22:16] that proves it amen I was wondering how
[1:22:18] long this season was well at least I was
[1:22:20] using months right so a season could be
[1:22:22] six months okay
[1:22:24] praise the Lord I like that all right
[1:22:26] there you go they're willing to rejoice
[1:22:29] for a season
[1:22:33] Luka program says in 1954 11 years
[1:22:39] before he passed he's 45 years old look
[1:22:43] what he says this is striking cuz after
[1:22:46] you get 45 years old it's the idea of it
[1:22:48] is now of course if I'm ever going to be
[1:22:51] in any season or any age to be the best
[1:22:54] for the Lord it'd probably be right now
[1:22:59] hmm
[1:23:00] look what he says because all the kid
[1:23:03] things are passed away you ever feel
[1:23:05] like that Lord I wish I could just grow
[1:23:07] up a little bit
[1:23:09] wish I could just be more mature in
[1:23:11] Christ how many could save rid of that
[1:23:14] exit so all his kid things are finally
[1:23:17] passed away at 45
[1:23:19] I got what seven more years so I get
[1:23:22] there all my kid things may be passed
[1:23:24] away by the sea and you're settling down
[1:23:28] turning gray you know just the time of
[1:23:30] life where you should really be anchored
[1:23:32] and strong enough yet and just at your
[1:23:36] very best mellowed out the kid part
[1:23:44] and the boyhood beat out just at the
[1:23:48] time to enter the field brother
[1:23:50] Bannister 45 the best time of my life
[1:23:54] now we know Church the best time
[1:23:56] actually came later I'm gonna get rid of
[1:24:00] that
[1:24:01] brother at his best time actually came
[1:24:03] at 54 55 and 56 because that was the
[1:24:09] third pole when did Moses work best
[1:24:20] eight legs
[1:24:21] we was 40 80 Moses best work started
[1:24:29] when he was 80 years old so see even in
[1:24:41] our own thinking it's not always what we
[1:24:43] think will best will be the best season
[1:24:45] it's what God calls for his scene yes
[1:24:50] like right now I could make ever excuse
[1:24:52] well I don't have time to preach I don't
[1:24:55] have time to do this I'm time to write
[1:24:57] books I'm time to make youtube videos I
[1:24:58] can make all these executions and this
[1:25:00] is not the season my life but I'm not
[1:25:03] looking at that I'm looking at what the
[1:25:05] Holy Spirit's leading me to do grace God
[1:25:09] I've had numerous people ask me how in
[1:25:12] the world could you write a book I said
[1:25:13] one paragraph at a time
[1:25:16] praise God over here and a half you
[1:25:21] write enough paragraphs a day you're
[1:25:22] gonna preach didn't have a book to go
[1:25:24] along with it but see we don't know we
[1:25:29] might think all this season possible it
[1:25:31] may be the seasoning I want you to
[1:25:34] overcome remember brother says I like a
[1:25:38] man who has goals I like the man who's
[1:25:42] got ambitious or agrees on that with him
[1:25:44] around Lincoln I just see a man who
[1:25:46] knows what he's called to do hey man
[1:25:49] praise the Lord bless your heart
[1:25:58] the church we just got to understand
[1:26:01] even though our thinking may think well
[1:26:02] I'll be the best of 25 I already passed
[1:26:05] 25 I guess that was my best days I'm I
[1:26:09] so relax on Jesus because those were the
[1:26:12] best season of my life no let's not
[1:26:14] limit God remember Abraham Moses all use
[1:26:18] the older ages right brother branham use
[1:26:21] best at the end of his life
[1:26:23] God could finally convince him after
[1:26:26] dream dream dream all those dreams God
[1:26:28] can finally convince him to leave
[1:26:30] Jeffersonville his church his family
[1:26:32] leave everything so you can go out of
[1:26:33] the wilderness to get the revelation of
[1:26:35] those seals hi amen
[1:26:39] get that revelation of marriage on and
[1:26:42] divorce
[1:26:42] oh thank God in church thank God he did
[1:26:50] so no matter where at Jose no matter
[1:26:53] where you're at God could have a greater
[1:26:55] season ahead of you praise God sister
[1:26:58] Beatrice no matter where you're at I
[1:27:00] could have a greater season ahead of ya
[1:27:03] amen
[1:27:04] no matter where I am God it's what God
[1:27:11] is already playing now and for days and
[1:27:14] there's no devil hell that can stop God
[1:27:17] season for you and I amen
[1:27:20] well I'll be my best at 45 and that's
[1:27:24] what I'll really serve God know it might
[1:27:25] be after that just stay faithful watch
[1:27:29] God move the season watch God use you
[1:27:32] give me all you can give all diligence
[1:27:34] to serve God and your faith virtue all
[1:27:36] those things put on the fool and I've
[1:27:38] got serve God with all your heart and
[1:27:40] you'll be ready at that time in season a
[1:27:44] brother man never stop preaching he
[1:27:46] never said well I'm giving up I'm past
[1:27:48] 45 I just give up on God I'll just
[1:27:51] retire no he just kept going and trusted
[1:27:54] God for the right time in season why
[1:27:57] didn't God preached that long on that
[1:27:58] quote and if I'm ever gonna do anything
[1:28:02] that I have I should do it now and I'm
[1:28:05] so thankful what he has shown me in the
[1:28:07] Gospels and how I'm so glad of that
[1:28:10] says this in 1954 he did not have the
[1:28:13] tenth Bishop he didn't gonna realize the
[1:28:15] third polis company until two years
[1:28:18] later program thinks this will be the
[1:28:20] best time right now I'm 45 this would be
[1:28:23] the best time and he's little did he
[1:28:24] know two years later God was going to
[1:28:26] show up I got so much greater things for
[1:28:28] you you think you're you're probably now
[1:28:30] he's actually not you actually be at
[1:28:32] your best at the end of your life Thank

[1:28:44] limit on God let's be open to what God
[1:28:47] wants to do with us in the future look
[1:28:51] at this he says this in 54 and yet I
[1:28:54] just can't satisfy myself somehow I just
[1:28:57] hunger for God how many hunger for God
[1:29:00] out there there's just something I ought
[1:29:03] to be doing looks like and I just can't
[1:29:06] get to doing it right

[1:29:13] I could just reach after something to
[1:29:14] almost touch it you see it just seems
[1:29:17] like to me there's something else out
[1:29:19] there I'm just almost touching somewhere
[1:29:23] if I could only get to that spot and
[1:29:26] then it would be fine it was right there
[1:29:36] something he can almost touch Oh

[1:29:56] ha ha ha he was so feathering sharp he
[1:30:00] said oh my and just fit perfectly in my
[1:30:03] hand but 9 years earlier he's like I
[1:30:07] just feel like I'm so close to something
