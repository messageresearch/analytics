[27:46] like to go back to the church ages
[27:48] tonight back to the book of life okay
[27:50] Revelation chapter 3 about how important
[27:57] it is to go slowly on a topic so pardon
[28:01] me I really enjoy going sober sometimes
[28:04] I feel like with is it my boat too slow
[28:07] but I wanted to show you something
[28:10] practice it it's so important at times
[28:13] to go slow so I just wanna show that
[28:17] boundaries Revelation chapter 3 verse
[28:38] relation three five and six praise God I
[28:45] read verse five and then we call e46
[28:48] he's overcometh the same shall be
[28:50] clothed in white raiment I will not blot
[28:54] out his name but I will confess his name
[28:59] before my father and before his angels
[29:02] let's all read verse six one two three
[29:05] either happening here they didn't hear
[29:08] what the spirit saith need on your
[29:13] hearts to make an order to God somehow
[29:15] God's really sees every need here
[29:17] tonight Heavenly Father we bow our heads
[29:19] together thank you for the songs we
[29:21] could sing or
[29:22] then we have to Malachi playing video
[29:24] help you on the computer grateful Lord
[29:27] to be here bless all the senator came
[29:28] out so grateful to be in your house here
[29:31] tonight North afraid speak to us nor
[29:33] strengthen us by your grace and mercy
[29:36] direct us for you direct me help me get
[29:39] out of your way Lord Jesus and tonight
[29:41] as it was a burden on the heart like to
[29:43] see just importance of going slowly we
[29:48] just give you glory honor and praise
[29:50] though we just pray Lord our lives of
[29:52] these so worthy the gospel or God that
[29:54] you would not not on our names Florida
[29:56] that you would invest our days before
[29:58] your father we love you give you praise
[30:03] in Jesus Christ
[30:13] [Music]
[30:34] when I look at part seven our text here
[30:40] focus on focusing still in the book of
[30:42] life
[30:43] let me go through these benefits of
[30:44] teaching verse by verse willing to share
[30:46] do you think's here that the Prophet
[30:47] said about the benefits are going verse
[30:52] by verse now this is from the message of
[30:58] seven churches in 1954 this was quite a
[31:02] while before he preached the second
[31:06] teacher changes but look what he says
[31:08] here is you're getting ready to preach
[31:10] this message needs to bring your Bible
[31:11] long and in your pencil paper we and you
[31:14] want to take down scriptures that you
[31:17] just don't think that's just exactly
[31:18] right right here little note and put it
[31:21] on for the next night so I like that
[31:24] brother Graham was always open to
[31:25] questions I want to be that way to our
[31:27] boys try to be that way if there's
[31:29] anything I said that was wrong please
[31:31] let me know I try to share or maybe I
[31:33] feel like that was the
[31:35] when teaching program said I remember
[31:38] staying a year and six months just in
[31:41] the book of Revelation in the tabernacle
[31:43] here that's what I like he said in
[31:45] teaching
[31:46] I just love teaching oh my I think it's
[31:51] wonderful it gives the basis and settles
[31:54] the church like that so it gives you a
[31:57] foundation on the scripture praise the
[31:59] Lord and this is interesting it on the
[32:02] adoption series he preached for sermons
[32:04] on the adoption series in 1960 and it's
[32:09] kind of on the book of Ephesians like
[32:10] we've been you just got back into on
[32:12] Sunday program just to be reading verses
[32:14] four or five which you can read on
[32:15] Sunday they said watch this master
[32:18] teacher Paul the first thing he does is
[32:20] knock out all the idea fall in the way
[32:22] knock out all the idea of ever being a
[32:25] Christian things mom gone the next day
[32:27] God be dead me and the next day I'm back
[32:31] again
[32:31] that's nonsense this book is not
[32:33] addressed to an evangelistic teaching
[32:37] evangelist service he said we don't I
[32:40] don't touch this on the fields I bring
[32:44] this to the church where Paul addresses
[32:46] it to the sings those that are caught
[32:48] and preserved in our film and our set
[32:50] aside and are in the Holy Spirit already
[32:53] in canyons life so if you see what
[32:55] brother Graham saying like I'll address
[32:57] this letter to the Saints and Paul
[32:59] getting Rugrats and I can't teach this
[33:01] out one of the advantages I'm only there
[33:03] one service right there Global Services
[33:05] yeah he said I only way I can teach this
[33:07] what Paul did verse by verse is to be in
[33:10] the local church amen and he said I love
[33:12] teaching the Word of God this is for
[33:14] solid believers this is for everybody
[33:17] who's solid and Christ who's already
[33:19] crossed Jordan into the Promised Land
[33:21] amen he said he's all trying to tell
[33:24] them the first thing is get get it out
[33:26] of your mind that you're going to get
[33:28] lost and you're gonna do this and you're
[33:30] scared of this don't be scared of it
[33:32] where he's trying to tell you where
[33:34] you're at who you are and understanding
[33:36] don't you agree that you know let me
[33:38] preach on occasions or other scriptures
[33:40] it tells you you're already in heavenly
[33:42] places
[33:43] it tells you you already child of God
[33:45] does
[33:46] they remind you of your position in
[33:49] Christ he said now you ought to do
[33:51] things and are now you might not do
[33:54] things wrong I'm sorry I said you might
[33:56] do things wrong and every time you do it
[33:59] anything wrong you're going to get paid
[34:00] for it
[34:01] yes sir you reap what you sow but that
[34:04] adds about one thing to do with your
[34:06] salvation when you're going scared of
[34:09] God you got your life and you can no
[34:11] more die than God you can die you're a
[34:14] part of God you're a son of God
[34:16] I like that remember the Bible said Paul
[34:18] said wherefore my beloved as you have
[34:20] always obeyed not as in my presence only
[34:23] but now much more in my absence work out
[34:26] your own salvation with fear and
[34:28] trembling so God God knows our salvation
[34:32] and when we look at God's plan we know
[34:34] we'll never be lost but Paul says while
[34:37] you're out here on earth if your
[34:39] attention to him make sure you're living
[34:40] the red life check up every hour right
[34:43] work on to your salvation with fear and
[34:44] trembling now I want to uh just go to
[34:47] this scripture real quick I just had
[34:48] this on my mind to write here Hebrews
[34:51] five and I just want to read these this
[34:54] I'm singing of these scriptures here for
[34:56] one a time you ought to be teachers you
[34:59] had need that one teach you again which
[35:01] be the first principles of the Oracles
[35:03] of God and our become such as have need
[35:07] of milk and not of strong meat for
[35:11] everyone that uses milk is unskillful
[35:13] on the word of righteousness for he's a
[35:15] baby I like this strong meat belongeth
[35:19] to them that are of full age even those
[35:23] who by reason of use have their senses
[35:26] exercised to discern both good and evil
[35:29] so a real mature Christian who can
[35:33] handle the meat of the word is able to
[35:35] have the discernment of the Holy Spirit
[35:37] to recognize good and evil even is most
[35:40] deceptive forms right the Prophet talked
[35:45] about God missing evil age and how even
[35:48] how can overcome the Randstad the the
[35:50] the Christian is one who can recognize
[35:52] Satan and every one of his tricks and
[35:54] that's when you know you becoming a real
[35:56] solid Christian
[35:57] you can discern just little irreverent
[36:01] attitudes or real little small things
[36:03] that enter the walk with the Lord now
[36:05] look at the very next scripture I
[36:07] thought that was really good but I'm
[36:09] sorry before I move that would know we
[36:11] ought to be so deep in the Word of God
[36:13] that we could teach others
[36:15] my mother's you could teach your
[36:17] children right you're so deep in the
[36:20] word you're so deep in the word you can
[36:22] teach somebody else about the church age
[36:23] it's got to say that or the seven seals
[36:26] are or the water baptism or the God then
[36:29] keeping the word that we can teach
[36:31] others pause it if not then we need to
[36:34] go back and learn those things again
[36:35] right because those are we say note or
[36:40] beginning doctrines right and so we want
[36:44] to be able to do that now sisters don't
[36:46] teach like publicly but like I said they
[36:48] teach sugar or they testify right now
[36:51] look at chapter six verse one tells us
[36:54] what eat the milk doctrines are then
[36:59] upon leaving the principles of doctrine
[37:00] of Christ let us go on to perfection not
[37:03] laying again the foundation of
[37:04] repentance from dead works you're just
[37:06] getting saved just repenting you should
[37:08] have left you should repent of that
[37:10] custom you should a repentant of that
[37:12] makeup wearing or you know - maybe you
[37:14] can apply these more simply that's a
[37:17] very milk doctrine right and I'll pay
[37:20] toward God you need to have faith in God
[37:22] not trust in the world or trust in money
[37:24] or trust in jobs you're not faith in God
[37:26] right the doctrine of baptisms there was
[37:29] a baptism in water and the fact is with
[37:31] the Holy Ghost amen the leg on at hand
[37:34] that's a helmet very doctrine if you're
[37:36] sick call upon the elders of the church
[37:37] have a lay hands on you praise the Lord
[37:39] and on the resurrection of the Dead
[37:42] we're all going to be raised some day
[37:43] right you're either in the first
[37:45] resurrection the rapture or the second
[37:47] resurrection that goes to the white and
[37:49] I'm judgment and of eternal judgment
[37:52] right we're all those who are lost we'll
[37:57] be eternally judged right there will be
[37:59] a judgment that last eternally at some
[38:01] point they'll come to annihilation but
[38:03] that judgment that they were that they
[38:06] were unworthy with everlasting life
[38:08] unworthy of eternal life we'd say that
[38:10] judgment lasts eternally that's right
[38:13] and all sin will go on into deeper
[38:16] things if God will prevent us I'm going
[38:18] to say God permit us to go on a deeper
[38:20] things that's a night I'd say tonight by
[38:22] God's grace and bro dad told us how to
[38:24] do that he said you go
[38:25] you said go through the scripture it's
[38:27] like you can reread there go through and
[38:29] get them get them a foundation get them
[38:33] settled in the Word of God all right
[38:37] let's go here now let's go back to the
[38:39] churches here now we left off at the two
[38:42] things being blotted out last Wednesday
[38:45] Dan and Ephraim remember that and we
[38:48] looked at how idolatry we have it with
[38:50] idolatry medicine is not free so very
[38:53] much but it's a huge problem because
[38:55] people will worship all kinds of things
[38:58] and the Prophet told us in Deuteronomy
[39:00] 29 that's where God pronounces that
[39:04] names will be removed because of
[39:06] idolatry and I and we showed how there's
[39:09] a type of the first thing they did with
[39:11] idolatry in the days of Raya Boehm and
[39:14] Jeroboam they cut the people from going
[39:17] to church we saw that last Wednesday and
[39:20] that they built up an idol and that's
[39:22] what we see today people will leave the
[39:24] house of God and they'll set up idols
[39:26] now what I found amazing is that because
[39:31] of their idolatry these two tribes
[39:34] missed the baptism of the Holy Ghost I
[39:36] don't know if you caught this as you
[39:37] read the book or not but Dan and Ephraim
[39:41] are missing in Revelation 7 4 so let's
[39:44] go there well I guess I'll just go there
[39:46] right here revelation 7 4 we'll just do
[39:49] that right here might as well I'll save
[39:51] milk or let's say Malachi from going
[39:52] back over revelation 7 for this is quite
[39:56] a thought I thought as I read this this
[39:59] is kind of what jumped out to me and I
[40:01] heard the number of them which were
[40:02] sealed and there were sealed 144,000 of
[40:05] all the tribes that showed of Israel of
[40:06] the tribe of juda were sealed 7 or
[40:09] 12,000 the tribe of Reuben sealed 12,000
[40:12] of the tribe of GAD sealed 12,000 of the
[40:15] tribe of Asher sealed 12,000 of the
[40:17] tribe of Neff talam were sealed 12,000
[40:21] the tribe of Manasseh
[40:22] we're CEO 12-thousand tribe of Simeon or
[40:24] C 12,000 of the tribe of Levi were
[40:26] sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Issachar
[40:28] were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of
[40:31] Zebulun were sealed 12,000 of the tribe
[40:33] of Joseph were sealed 12,000 and the
[40:36] tribe of Benjamin were sealed 12,000
[40:38] amen now look Dan and Ephraim are
[40:41] replaced by Joseph and Benjamin and they
[40:44] do not get born again because of
[40:47] idolatry what uh what that was a
[40:49] striking thought to me because as I said
[40:51] I put up there
[40:52] this proves those who allow idols in
[40:55] their lives cannot be born again because
[40:58] God doesn't let Dan and Ephraim get born
[41:00] again all because of idolatry and look
[41:03] at this hosea was written in 786 between
[41:06] this and 746 BC and that's when God
[41:10] actually pulled their names off the book
[41:12] that's when they started idolatry Hosea
[41:14] said leave Dan alone he's joined with
[41:17] idols this means God was going to blot
[41:19] out their names from under heaven for
[41:21] around 2800 years and counting can you
[41:24] imagine that almost 3,000 years God has
[41:27] kept their names off the book of life
[41:29] under heaven now this is quite a thought
[41:32] and I don't quite understand this but
[41:34] that's what the scripture tells us now
[41:37] it seems God has mercy upon the two
[41:39] tribes because their idolatry was under
[41:42] the Old Testament but I think you and I
[41:45] understand under the New Testament I
[41:47] doubters will not inherit the kingdom of
[41:49] God there is no inheritance
[41:51] frye doubters because that's what it
[41:54] says in 1st Corinthians 6:9 and
[41:55] Ephesians 5:5 idolaters will not inherit
[41:59] the kingdom of God
[42:00] so church and this is why I said I don't
[42:02] understand this so bear with me I can't
[42:04] explain this perfectly but the Bible
[42:06] says somehow by the grace of God the two
[42:09] tribes show back up in the Millennium
[42:11] now can you get a picture of this dan
[42:14] and Ephraim have tribes today but their
[42:17] names are not on the book of life
[42:19] because of idolatry still today but
[42:22] somehow the rapture is going to go and
[42:24] then during the tribulation Dan and
[42:27] Ephraim will not be born again the Holy
[42:28] Ghost now this is under this is striking
[42:32] I can't explain it and then number what
[42:34] happens after that
[42:36] there's fire because in the Millennium
[42:37] the righteous walk upon the ashes of the
[42:39] wicked remember that from Malachi
[42:41] chapter 3
[42:42] I'm sorry chapter 4 so somehow the
[42:46] tribes of Dan and Ephraim live through
[42:49] the tribulation period and then in the
[42:51] Millennium their names are put back on
[42:54] the book of life I can't explain that
[42:56] church and I don't know but remember
[42:58] there's a lot about the millennium and
[42:59] future home we can't understand right
[43:02] because remember the Bible said about
[43:03] the Millennium that a child will die a
[43:06] hundred years old remember that preach
[43:07] on that a few years ago I think it was
[43:08] just last year preach on the millennium
[43:10] a child will die a hundred years old
[43:13] and then remember at the end of the
[43:14] millennium Satan's gonna gather all the
[43:16] nations and come against the camp of God
[43:18] and God's gonna burn up all those
[43:19] nations now I can't explain that I don't
[43:22] know how that's gonna happen it's gotta
[43:23] go that some people go through the
[43:25] Armageddon and make it in the Millennium
[43:27] I don't know is he gonna allow you know
[43:30] allow people to make you spoken word
[43:31] created I don't know how that's gonna
[43:32] happen but somehow there's gonna be
[43:35] people that make it into the millennium
[43:37] and then they got to get destroyed at
[43:40] the Battle of Gog and Magog that's
[43:42] that's pretty deep and I can't explain
[43:43] all that but I just want you to see that
[43:46] so let's go back to zico 48 now so I
[43:48] want you to see that this subscripts
[43:49] your brother Branham gives us are the
[43:50] Millennium let's read X I'm sure we
[43:53] haven't read that lately I know I
[43:54] haven't read that like the unless I read
[43:57] it when we preach on the Millenium last
[43:58] year Ezekiel 48 and this is all in the
[44:02] church age book as you're probably aware
[44:03] of now I'm just gonna read
[44:12] one two and five all right because well
[44:16] uh three five and six one two five and
[44:19] six because you'll see Dan and Ephraim's
[44:20] name are back in the tribes all right
[44:24] now verse one now these are the names of
[44:26] the tribes from the north end to the
[44:27] coast of the way of Heflin as one goeth
[44:29] Tehama 'the hayes Arion the border of
[44:32] damascus northward to the coast of hema
[44:34] 'the four these are the sides east and
[44:36] west a portion for Dan there's Dan and
[44:40] by the border of Dan from the East Side
[44:44] west side a portion of for Asher I go
[44:47] down to verse five and by the border
[44:49] Manasseh from the east side and the west
[44:51] side a portion for Ephraim and by the
[44:54] border of Ephraim from the east side
[44:55] unto the west side a portion for Reuben
[44:57] we'll stop right there so somehow they
[45:00] get back in their names in the book of
[45:04] life I can't explain that
[45:05] but if God's Word says that brother Ram
[45:07] keeps repeating this over and over again
[45:09] if God says something about the book of
[45:11] life in the Bible we just have to accept
[45:13] it we don't want to argue with God's
[45:15] book we just want to agree with God's
[45:17] book hey we have not if we understand we
[45:20] have a right to sometimes question
[45:22] brother Branham because he was a man do
[45:24] you understand what I'm saying well
[45:25] because he might make a mistake right we
[45:27] ever sometimes because every man must
[45:30] every word a man says must be taken back
[45:32] to the Word of God right prove all
[45:34] things but we don't have a right to
[45:36] question God you never understand that
[45:38] because every word God said is thus
[45:40] saith the Lord and we would never cross
[45:42] question brother Ram Michael I wonder if
[45:44] he's a prophet we're beyond that we know
[45:46] we know his teaching was the say at the
[45:48] Bible we know that I'm just saying like
[45:50] understanding minor doctrines there it
[45:52] can does that make sense everybody we
[45:54] have to take everything brother Ram said
[45:56] back to the word okay if not we're gonna
[45:58] get confused on a few doctrines because
[46:00] he was a man he grew an understanding
[46:02] all right so I hope that's okay now I've
[46:07] had a busy week so I don't get a chance
[46:08] to put all the scriptures and quotes up
[46:13] here so I just wrote down the page
[46:14] numbers I'll read them out of the church
[46:16] age book and we'll go from there by the
[46:19] grace of God now that's my prayer in
[46:20] church and hope for the church that as
[46:22] we go through the church ages and any
[46:24] series we do
[46:26] that you and I get so settled and
[46:28] groundedness that nobody can deceive us
[46:31] right nobody can trick us nobody can
[46:33] bring a lie or a false doctor in the
[46:35] church and if a false doctrines brought
[46:37] in the church the Holy Spirit will
[46:39] discern that and we'll talk to the
[46:40] brother afterwards or you'll talk to me
[46:43] afterwards if that will be so found in
[46:45] the Word of God that no man may deceive
[46:47] us this Jesus said I like that that's
[46:50] what we need to be sound like that by
[46:53] the grace of the Lord okay so let me get
[46:56] out my book here let's go to chapter I'm
[46:59] sorry go to page 272 in the church age
[47:01] book I want to read this page here or
[47:04] this paragraph it starts with another
[47:07] illustration okay so if you have your
[47:09] Bibles brother Ram quotes first
[47:12] Corinthians 10 so you got your Bibles
[47:14] it's gonna first corinthians chapter 10
[47:15] and we'll read verses 1 to 4 first
[47:19] corinthians 10 1 to 4
[47:30] first Corinthians 10 one through four
[47:32] okay
[47:34] now the purpose of this paragraph as the
[47:38] first word say brother Adam gives us
[47:40] another illustration of idolatry I'm
[47:43] sorry our names being removed he gives
[47:45] us another illustration of names being
[47:48] removed and a lot of these are more
[47:49] illustrations further showing more Bible
[47:52] examples all right so let's read verses
[47:55] 1 to 4 moreover brethren I would not
[47:58] that ye should be ignorant how that all
[48:01] our fathers were under the cloud and all
[48:04] baptized through the sea and we're all
[48:08] baptized unto Moses in the cloud and the
[48:12] sea and did all eat the same spiritual
[48:15] meat and it all drink the same spiritual
[48:16] drink for they drank of that spiritual
[48:18] rock that followed them and that rock
[48:21] was Christ their Christ is in the Old
[48:23] Testament he's the same yesterday today
[48:26] and forever amen hallelujah verse 5 but
[48:29] with many of them God was not well
[48:31] pleased for they were overthrown in the
[48:33] wilderness now it's 1 stop right there
[48:37] this is why we it's so important that we
[48:39] preach both sides we have to preach the
[48:42] truth but then we have to preach warning
[48:44] as well because anybody can be baptized
[48:47] look look at this 2 million people were
[48:49] baptized but we want to rejoice when the
[48:52] little kids get baptized you know we
[48:53] want to rejoice when the adults get
[48:54] baptized we want to do that because
[48:56] we're just hoping that they're their
[48:58] true kind of believer but time will tell
[49:01] as with everything God makes everything
[49:04] beautiful his own time amen time is
[49:06] gonna tell can we stand the test of time
[49:09] praise God and that's what we see here
[49:12] that's it brother Anderson here's
[49:14] another illustration of idolatry now go
[49:18] to verse 6 now these things were I'm
[49:22] sorry now these things were our examples
[49:23] to the intent we should not lust after
[49:25] evil things as they also lusted neither
[49:30] be idolaters as were some of them as it
[49:34] is written the people sat down to eat
[49:35] and drink and rose up to play neither
[49:41] commit fornication as some of them
[49:43] committed and fell in one day three and
[49:45] twenty thousand so so far what does he
[49:49] warned us of idolatry right and
[49:52] fornication the next one number nine
[49:54] neither let us tempt Christ as some of
[49:57] them also tempted Christ and were
[49:59] destroyed of serpents 9 verse 10 neither
[50:04] murmur ye as some of them also murmured
[50:06] and were destroyed of the destroyer I
[50:09] wish you those are we gonna battle the
[50:10] most I don't know I would I might say
[50:13] murmuring what would you say
[50:15] idolatry I would think idolatry
[50:17] murmuring might be the most that would
[50:20] affect I'm talking about us Salah
[50:21] believers that love the Lord I'm this
[50:22] I'm talking about those who come to
[50:24] church all the time those who pray read
[50:25] their Bible and praying and seeking God
[50:27] with all their hearts that's what I'm
[50:29] talking about
[50:31] murmuring complaining when things don't
[50:33] go our way or or we don't see the answer
[50:35] to our prayers or times get hard
[50:38] I think idolatry oh is is hard is a hard
[50:43] battle at many times because of the
[50:46] cares of the world can anybody say amen
[50:47] to that
[50:48] you know the cares of the world come in
[50:51] the pressures of life and if we're not
[50:54] careful things become more important
[50:57] than God things we get more excited
[51:00] about the new gadget then reading our
[51:02] Bibles I was praying that this morning
[51:04] you know because last few weeks new
[51:06] phones have come out the new Apple phone
[51:08] and the new Google phone came out today
[51:09] and I like technology but I was praying
[51:12] that lord help you know look I was
[51:13] looking at my life am i more excited
[51:15] about reading my Bible or new phones and
[51:17] they come out that's a good indicator do
[51:20] we get more excited about the new
[51:21] receipe you know for our sisters or the
[51:25] the new washing machine I might come out
[51:27] you know how to know what sister was
[51:28] like but that's a reality we've got to
[51:32] make sure we don't let anything come
[51:33] more precious than Jesus amen you see
[51:36] those are the ones I feel like we need
[51:38] to check our lives for we don't let
[51:41] idolatry come in a fornication usually
[51:44] shows up right away and and there are
[51:46] certain situations I know you know where
[51:48] I've got to be careful we're not
[51:50] supposed to eat with fornicators so I
[51:53] was on guard Sunday if we had certain
[51:55] visitor
[51:55] and certain people come I was on guard
[51:57] to tell people I was told my wife on the
[51:59] way there I said I might tell people
[52:00] they can't eat with us today because
[52:01] we're not allowed to eat with
[52:03] fornicators the Bible said Bible says
[52:05] that doughnut you with fornicators
[52:07] because you're supposed to show a
[52:09] difference between holy and unholy
[52:11] that's what you're supposed to do so I
[52:13] was ready if we had certain visitors I
[52:15] know there's certain things as a pastor
[52:16] I know about I was gonna tell people I'm
[52:18] sorry I'll give you some food I'll give
[52:19] you a plate but you can't eat with us
[52:21] because it's the Bible says you do that
[52:23] to shame them to bring them back to
[52:26] repentance all right
[52:27] there's ever we do we know that's in the
[52:30] scripture do one read death okay do we
[52:33] know okay okay but notes inscription all
[52:34] right that has to be done the number
[52:36] Paul said in first Corinthians five and
[52:37] six get that person out of the church if
[52:40] they don't repent of that get them out
[52:41] of the church because that's a cancer in
[52:44] the church that's a lust demon that's
[52:46] gonna try to it's on this brother or
[52:47] it's on this sister and it's gonna try
[52:49] to jump on somebody else that's exactly
[52:51] right so that's what I'm saying you know
[52:55] the Bible says here where the RAM gives
[52:57] us these examples these are
[52:58] illustrations to help us not to have
[53:00] idols in our lives not to murmur not to
[53:03] complain right and not to tempt the Lord
[53:07] now verse 11 now all these things happen
[53:11] to them foreign samples and they're
[53:13] written for our admonition ends of the
[53:16] world are come wherefore let him that
[53:20] thinketh he standeth take heed lest he
[53:23] fall so can everybody see why it's so
[53:26] important at all times we should always
[53:29] have the attitude of oh I just want to
[53:31] be right with the Lord I've got to watch
[53:33] my life we can never walk into here and
[53:36] take a Wednesday night service for
[53:37] granted because that's when people fall
[53:40] when they feel like they've arrived when
[53:42] they're patting themselves on the back
[53:43] look what I've done and look you know
[53:44] look how great of a message believer I
[53:46] am like that's why we got to have
[53:47] constant humility to recognize we're
[53:49] nothing if we take this for granted
[53:51] we're gonna fall so see that's why we've
[53:54] got and we got to make these services
[53:56] new we've got to refresh our minds renew
[53:58] our hearts and minds right get our first
[54:00] love back constantly amen we have to do
[54:03] that or else we're gonna fall into sin
[54:04] and temptation verse 13 there hath no
[54:08] temptation
[54:09] taken you but such as is common to man
[54:12] now let me stop right there that's where
[54:14] a lot of people get into self-pity right
[54:16] they say I preach on that often you know
[54:18] people said well nobody has it as hard
[54:19] as I do
[54:20] well this brother has it so easy this
[54:22] sister has it so easy well yeah in our
[54:24] local church you know you might be the
[54:26] only person that experiences certain
[54:28] things but what about other churches
[54:30] what about churches around the world we
[54:33] have to remember we're not the only
[54:34] message believers right
[54:35] there's people all around the world
[54:36] battling the same thing and if other
[54:39] people are getting the victory through
[54:40] the power of the Holy Spirit we can get
[54:42] that as well
[54:42] amen and we got to take courage we got
[54:45] to say God if I can't look beyond my
[54:47] local church lord send me a testimony
[54:49] from somebody help me to find a
[54:51] testimony on youtube or help me to find
[54:53] a testimony through my mom or somebody
[54:55] like my dad or somebody that will
[54:57] encourage me to keep on the fire lines
[54:59] because the Bible said we've all been
[55:02] tempted in the same ways right there's
[55:04] different temptations we battle help me
[55:06] to take courage in my temptation and
[55:08] help me to be an overcomer
[55:10] the Bible said but God is faithful who
[55:14] will not suffer you to be tempted above
[55:15] that you're able but will with the
[55:17] temptation also make a way to escape
[55:19] that you may be able to bear it
[55:22] wherefore my dearly beloved flee from
[55:25] idolatry see how he puts idolatry and
[55:28] then he ends with idolatry we've got to
[55:30] run away from anything that starts
[55:32] taking our love away from God so
[55:34] anything that takes away from your
[55:36] prayer life anything takes away your
[55:37] time from your daily devotions for the
[55:39] moms in the morning with the the
[55:40] children or or the dads at night you
[55:42] know anything that's taking those away
[55:44] we've got to run from those things amen
[55:47] run from the movies right or run run
[55:50] from the tablet timer whatever
[55:52] whatever's taking time away from God run
[55:55] from that and run to Christ that's the
[55:57] only way we're gonna get victory in this
[55:58] hour now that's the scripture brother
[56:01] I'm quoted here he said this is another
[56:04] illustration is the story of Israel
[56:06] leaving Egypt for Canaan he says but
[56:12] when they came to Moab those who join in
[56:14] the feast of el peor all died their
[56:19] carcasses fell in the wilderness for it
[56:21] was
[56:22] they're that they refuse the Word of God
[56:24] and turned from it
[56:27] okay so that's that's the illustration
[56:29] all of Egypt filed the cloud followed
[56:32] followed the pillar fire right they all
[56:34] came out following Moses the pillar of
[56:36] fire a lot of people put up brother
[56:38] branham's picture with the pillar of
[56:39] fire a lot of people start out with that
[56:41] picture a lot of people get baptized in
[56:44] the name of Lord Jesus Christ a lot of
[56:46] people get healed a lot of them drink
[56:47] from the spiritual rock the spiritual
[56:49] blessings right but then they fall away
[56:52] and that's what Israel did at bale peor
[56:55] they married into fornication or their
[56:57] or they they had fornications or
[57:00] unlawful relations with people that were
[57:03] not Israelites they entered into false
[57:05] relationships or evil relationships and
[57:08] the Prophet said that's what I mean we
[57:10] must not do now the next trip's forgives
[57:13] as Hebrews 6 let's go there Hebrews 6:1
[57:16] where we just start with one but let's
[57:19] go back to Hebrews 6 then that's right
[57:22] we read verses 1 and 2 and 3 I believe
[57:23] Hebrews 6 started 3 probably there we go
[57:34] Hebrews 6 now we read verse 3 that start
[57:38] verse 4 for it is impossible for those
[57:41] who were once enlightened and a taste of
[57:43] the heavenly gift and were made
[57:44] partakers of the Holy Ghost and have
[57:48] tasted the good word of God and the
[57:50] powers of the world to come if they
[57:52] shall fall away to renew them again unto
[57:55] repentance seeing they crucify to
[57:57] themselves the Son of God afresh and put
[58:01] him to an open shame all right that's
[58:06] the warning the Prophet gives as Israel
[58:08] came out they had all these supernatural
[58:11] things as they came out they fell away
[58:14] by joining themselves with bail peor
[58:16] which was idolatry right and so the
[58:20] proper the Bible gives us that same idea
[58:22] if we partake of spiritual things but
[58:26] don't continue on the Word of God then
[58:28] we'll become idolaters as well we got to
[58:30] continue into every promise of God and
[58:35] we know the promise of God today the
[58:36] promise of God today is the fullness of
[58:38] Pentecost we'll be in the bride amen
[58:40] that's our promise for today rapturing
[58:43] faith is our promise today amen
[58:45] that's our promise we've heard a shout
[58:47] we're listening the shout we're looking
[58:49] for a voice of an archangel amen which
[58:52] program said Christ does all three as he
[58:54] descends so Christ somehow will give the
[58:56] word to Archangel and we'll hear the
[58:58] voice that we're growing into that
[59:00] that's the word were we're desiring to
[59:02] fulfill in this hour a bride who makes
[59:05] herself ready we're constantly getting
[59:06] ready for the coming of the Lord we're
[59:08] looking for Christ's coming amen
[59:11] but see we can't shy away from that we
[59:13] can't draw back if we draw back we
[59:15] become my doubters we must go in all the
[59:18] word for our day now the Prophet says
[59:22] this next he says you can't go along
[59:26] with just part of the word you have to
[59:28] take all the word amen there are people
[59:32] and listen this statement there people
[59:34] who seem involved in the things of God
[59:37] almost 100% he says they are like Judas
[59:42] that's quite a statement Judas was
[59:45] almost a hundred percent I don't want to
[59:47] be 99 Church I want to be a hundred
[59:49] percent I want my whole life to be
[59:52] involved with the things of God Judas
[59:54] was maybe 99 I don't know you could go
[59:57] higher I lower I don't know but he
[59:58] wasn't a hundred we know that he wasn't
[1:00:01] a hundred percent involved in things of
[1:00:03] God because he was stealing on the side
[1:00:05] you got a little thief business on the
[1:00:07] side that's right well all of our
[1:00:09] business to be godly all of our
[1:00:11] preparation look at us and say that if
[1:00:13] the I ever met a Christian that's the
[1:00:14] Christian they they told me they're
[1:00:17] gonna pay me they paid me they owed the
[1:00:20] old interest they paid their interest
[1:00:22] you know that's a real Christian amen
[1:00:24] somebody who's faithful in all areas he
[1:00:27] said that's what Judas was he wasn't in
[1:00:29] the word all the way but RAM said Judas
[1:00:33] did exact there came a day when Judas
[1:00:35] did exactly what Israel did at bale peor
[1:00:38] he decided he wanted to join the false
[1:00:40] vine forces enter into the financial
[1:00:43] political organization of anti word
[1:00:46] antichrist religion and he did so
[1:00:49] was fooled and he catch that word he was
[1:00:53] fooled the other eleven were not they
[1:00:56] could not be four they were the very
[1:00:58] elect
[1:00:59] so when Judas left and betrayed the Lord
[1:01:02] his name was removed from the book of
[1:01:04] life to catch that word he was fooled
[1:01:07] now that's interesting word because we
[1:01:09] know people are gonna be saved and
[1:01:10] they're still called foolish virgin
[1:01:13] right so see the foolish virgin is only
[1:01:16] foolish to the Holy Ghost
[1:01:18] they got justification down they've got
[1:01:21] sanctification down but they're foolish
[1:01:23] to being born again they don't let the
[1:01:25] Holy Ghost flow through them in power to
[1:01:28] be clothed or and do with power from on
[1:01:31] high they just which is good they got
[1:01:33] st. vacation and justification but they
[1:01:35] don't have the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:37] to live the life all the time
[1:01:39] amen but now Judas is so foolish he
[1:01:42] leaves that the true message of the hour
[1:01:45] and joins with them politically and
[1:01:48] religiously
[1:01:49] somebody see that so see we don't want
[1:01:54] to be involved 99% we want to backup
[1:01:57] everything God's doing a hundred percent
[1:02:00] in church what did he do he pulled away
[1:02:02] from the message of the hour and that's
[1:02:05] why when we see people pull away from
[1:02:06] church or pull away from the message and
[1:02:09] go out denominational churches that you
[1:02:11] see why that burdens me you see why that
[1:02:13] should burden you to not to get
[1:02:15] discouraged you know or be critical of
[1:02:18] others we don't want to do that but it
[1:02:20] should burden us because they're doing
[1:02:21] the same thing that Judas did and they
[1:02:23] don't even know what they're doing like
[1:02:26] they leave the standards of holiness
[1:02:27] they'll start drinking publicly and all
[1:02:29] these things like that like I follow
[1:02:31] though I follow these groups that left a
[1:02:33] message I'm not gonna say their names
[1:02:35] because I don't want to criticize them
[1:02:36] like that I mean I sometimes I do but
[1:02:38] I'm gonna say something real real
[1:02:40] personal here I listen to some of their
[1:02:42] broadcasts to see what they're doing and
[1:02:43] they're talking about which wine is
[1:02:45] their favorite wine and now that and see
[1:02:48] now they left the message now they feel
[1:02:50] like I'm free to drink wine out in
[1:02:52] public and do all these things and you
[1:02:54] see how that's a stumbling block Paul
[1:02:55] said if I drink wine and make somebody
[1:02:57] stumble he said I cause he said because
[1:03:00] of my liberty he said a brother
[1:03:03] parish in Christ posted that so he said
[1:03:05] I won't drink wine or eating meat
[1:03:07] sacrificed to idols as long as the world
[1:03:10] standeth he said so I don't cause
[1:03:12] anybody to stumble you see how that can
[1:03:15] be a real they leave a message and
[1:03:17] though now I can drink publicly now I
[1:03:19] can do these things and and that can
[1:03:22] cause people to stumble they let their
[1:03:24] women wear tight pants and and got holes
[1:03:27] in it you know I've seen pictures of my
[1:03:29] friends or some of my friends that left
[1:03:30] on the message on Facebook they're
[1:03:32] sisters now where and you know and they
[1:03:34] have holes right here in their genes
[1:03:35] you've seen it right they buy jeans and
[1:03:37] there's holes in them have you seen
[1:03:38] those I see teenagers you know all the
[1:03:40] time they have holes right here and so
[1:03:41] these women that usually go to message
[1:03:43] churches now they got skin tight pants
[1:03:46] on and they're hugging their pastor dads
[1:03:47] or you know the preacher dads that used
[1:03:49] to preaching the message with high heels
[1:03:50] on and they're all smiles and like this
[1:03:52] is the right thing to do they're fooled
[1:03:55] are you with my church they're fooled
[1:03:58] they're revealing parts of the body that
[1:04:00] the Bible says our nakedness and they're
[1:04:05] drinking and doing things they shouldn't
[1:04:06] do what happened they got fooled now
[1:04:08] they're not even living their food into
[1:04:10] not even living a sanctified life and
[1:04:12] you see if they don't catch that and get
[1:04:15] corrected by the Holy Spirit it's
[1:04:17] possible if they're not careful they
[1:04:19] could have their names removed from the
[1:04:20] book of life right so see that's why
[1:04:23] whenever people draw back from God or
[1:04:25] they're less dedicated to God that's why
[1:04:28] it's such a burden to me because I don't
[1:04:30] want to be involved 99 percent or 75
[1:04:33] percent or 50 percent I want to be a
[1:04:35] hundred percent I don't want there to be
[1:04:38] any doubts how much I'm dedicated I want
[1:04:40] to be a hundred percent
[1:04:42] does that help by God's grace and I you
[1:04:44] know I'm see I'm not trying to be
[1:04:46] critical I'm just saying this is the
[1:04:47] pattern we see foolish virgins don't go
[1:04:50] in although in the word all the way but
[1:04:53] the wise virgin do go all the way all
[1:04:55] the word that's being preached to them
[1:04:57] they say Amen now here's one thing I
[1:05:00] want to say to my brother Samuel told me
[1:05:01] this was a real lot of wisdom he said we
[1:05:04] know the prophecy for this day we were
[1:05:06] talking about the fullness of Pentecost
[1:05:07] being the bride and we're talking about
[1:05:09] the bride makes herself ready and he
[1:05:12] made a really good point and really
[1:05:13] helped me he said well Jessie we know
[1:05:15] the Word of God
[1:05:17] most of a fill he said we just got to be
[1:05:19] patient to see how God lets it come to
[1:05:22] pass in our lives I thought that's
[1:05:24] really wonderful boy did I need to hear
[1:05:26] that because he pardon me I want to see
[1:05:30] it happen right now
[1:05:31] right like don't you I mean wouldn't it
[1:05:33] be nice to see all the gifts in
[1:05:35] operation and people like everybody
[1:05:37] winning souls
[1:05:38] you know people staying here to pray
[1:05:40] before service and then staying after
[1:05:41] and people being baptized I mean we like
[1:05:45] to see like a revival right way I mean
[1:05:46] we like to see that but God doesn't
[1:05:50] always do that way you know and God has
[1:05:54] to allow us to go through trials and
[1:05:55] hard times and times that test our faith
[1:05:58] the Bible said our faith has to go
[1:06:00] through a furnace a fire and then our
[1:06:04] faith is comes out at the end in the
[1:06:06] right kind of faith like I told you when
[1:06:10] I first came in our church we had seven
[1:06:12] people and I thought God was just and
[1:06:13] then bounzer came in and then pretty
[1:06:16] soon more people come in and Adam I'm
[1:06:18] sorry uh Anthony Scruggs and all these
[1:06:20] different people start coming in Devon
[1:06:22] and yeah I'm thinking boy this is gonna
[1:06:23] be a revival forever that's wonderful
[1:06:26] you know but you see how it is God lets
[1:06:29] time go on God goes through seasons we
[1:06:32] know the word has got to be fulfilled we
[1:06:34] just got to hang on with patience and
[1:06:37] know that God won't give us a trial that
[1:06:39] we can't handle and I've seen that to be
[1:06:43] true as long as we hang on to God's Word
[1:06:44] God hangs on us but see that's why with
[1:06:49] this this issue here
[1:06:50] he gives us illustration people can be
[1:06:51] baptized they can believe the pillar of
[1:06:53] fire you know they can they can have
[1:06:55] healing waters flow out of the rock of
[1:06:57] Christ they can actually be healed all
[1:06:58] these things but then fall away if they
[1:07:03] don't go on with the word all right am i
[1:07:09] doing on time okay I got 20 more minutes
[1:07:10] bear with me here
[1:07:11] I know it's reviewed by church member
[1:07:16] it's settling us
[1:07:17] it's grounding us and the things of God
[1:07:19] praise the Lord all right I'm sorry next
[1:07:26] so broadband tells us that's when
[1:07:27] Judas's name was taken off the book of
[1:07:29] life when he was fooled and he left the
[1:07:33] the things of God and then he went out
[1:07:36] to join the political forces that's when
[1:07:38] his name was taken off so we even know
[1:07:39] exactly when his name left I'm sorry was
[1:07:42] removed rather when he left on that
[1:07:44] night of the communion all right now the
[1:07:48] next paragraph on 272 now I'm sure
[1:07:51] you've noticed that those whose names
[1:07:53] were in the book of life were a part of
[1:07:56] the religious order of that day that
[1:07:58] centered around the true God and the
[1:08:00] worship of him though they did not
[1:08:02] worship according to the truth or word
[1:08:07] like Judas they didn't go all the way
[1:08:10] see how Judas was chosen of God he was
[1:08:13] instructed in truth he shared of the
[1:08:17] knowledge of the mysteries he had a
[1:08:20] ministry of power granted unto Him and
[1:08:22] He healed the sick and cast out devils
[1:08:24] in Jesus name when the showdown came he
[1:08:26] sold out for gold and political power he
[1:08:31] did not go up to Pentecost to receive
[1:08:33] the Spirit of God he was devoid of the
[1:08:37] spirit now go to Jude 1 verse 19 go to
[1:08:40] Jude 1 verse 19 Jude 1:19
[1:08:51] so this paragraph the prophets making us
[1:08:54] aware he's pointing out again those
[1:08:56] whose names are removed from the book of
[1:08:58] life were actually gathered around the
[1:09:00] message of the hour it wasn't a false
[1:09:02] religion you just wasn't gather around
[1:09:03] Buddhism or Confucianism as Confucianism
[1:09:07] he wasn't involved around that a
[1:09:09] psychological idea he was gather around
[1:09:12] Christ the word and that's whose
[1:09:16] people's names are removed those that
[1:09:18] around the true word and leave the true
[1:09:20] word that's why these things are
[1:09:22] striking for us on a Wednesday night or
[1:09:24] any time because we are gathered around
[1:09:26] the true word and we got to make sure we
[1:09:28] stay with the true word all right I'm
[1:09:32] sorry
[1:09:33] Jude 1:19 now hide you and read out for
[1:09:35] me do you want 19
[1:09:40] [Music]
[1:09:41] all right what they do they separate
[1:09:44] themselves see being able to stay with
[1:09:48] God's Word and God's people is a good
[1:09:50] sign you are saved because Judas did it
[1:09:53] Judas left he sold out and memmer the
[1:09:57] seven he had already left it the big
[1:10:00] move had already left right and they're
[1:10:02] just down to their small group of
[1:10:04] preachers 70 preachers have left now
[1:10:07] they're down to 12 right that's right
[1:10:10] you know that's as ministers I hear when
[1:10:11] we talk with brother Brooks and
[1:10:12] different brothers you know and we just
[1:10:14] think well where are we in the message
[1:10:16] you know I've we got the spot where the
[1:10:18] big group of preachers is left and
[1:10:20] they're still Judas laughs you know how
[1:10:21] people like they like to think of
[1:10:23] because the scripture is prophetic these
[1:10:25] are types that repeat so we wonder about
[1:10:29] that have the majority of preachers left
[1:10:31] that are gonna leave or there's still
[1:10:33] more to come to come I don't know
[1:10:36] remember Judas hung around the longest
[1:10:39] he hung around to the very last moment
[1:10:41] and they didn't go up to get the Holy
[1:10:43] Ghost and he's not foolish virgin he was
[1:10:47] foolishly foolishly lost he was a
[1:10:49] foolish make believer right not even a
[1:10:52] foolish virgin because he wasn't true to
[1:10:54] all the word he loved the steel he never
[1:10:56] got a victory over stealing so see those
[1:10:59] who separate themselves from the true
[1:11:01] Church of God prove they don't have the
[1:11:04] Holy Spirit because they don't want to
[1:11:07] hang around the true Word of God they
[1:11:09] don't want to go deeper than things of
[1:11:10] God look at verse 20 but ye beloved
[1:11:15] building up yourselves on your most holy
[1:11:16] faith praying and the Holy Ghost keep
[1:11:19] yourselves in the love of God looking
[1:11:23] for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:11:24] unto eternal life so see this proves
[1:11:27] Judas was not praying in the Holy Spirit
[1:11:28] he was probably just saying as regular
[1:11:30] Hail Mary prayer you know something he
[1:11:32] was just saying repetitious prayers
[1:11:34] because those who are in the true church
[1:11:36] pray and build up their faith with the
[1:11:38] Holy Ghost prayer they start praying and
[1:11:41] they know it's not themselves now God's
[1:11:42] praying through me now I'm praying with
[1:11:44] the spirits anointing on me and they
[1:11:47] keep themselves in the love of God which
[1:11:49] the love of God is keeping all God's
[1:11:51] commands
[1:11:51] it's just that simple this is the love
[1:11:54] of God to keep all my commands okay so
[1:11:58] that's the example the Prophet gives
[1:12:00] there with Judas Judas left he separated
[1:12:04] himself from the people of God all right
[1:12:09] now he says make no mistake about it a
[1:12:11] person that's truly baptized with the
[1:12:13] Holy Ghost into the body of Christ
[1:12:15] receiving the fullness of the Spirit
[1:12:17] will be in the word all the way that is
[1:12:21] the evidence of being baptized with the
[1:12:23] Holy Ghost
[1:12:24] Judas failed multitudes fell right there
[1:12:26] and when they failed to go on in that
[1:12:28] word their names are taken off the book
[1:12:31] of life it's a serious thing to say I
[1:12:34] believe the message because if you don't
[1:12:36] go on in it with it it proves your
[1:12:38] name's gonna be removed right think
[1:12:41] about all the people we've known that
[1:12:41] have fallen away and no longer care
[1:12:44] about God and all these things we once
[1:12:47] we hear we've got to keep going we've
[1:12:49] got to possess the land amen we've got
[1:12:51] to take our position in Christ God wants
[1:12:53] people that will take their position and
[1:12:55] stand there as adopted sons and
[1:12:57] daughters amen we're there their name on
[1:13:00] the check is just as good as their
[1:13:02] father's amen
[1:13:03] they know what God wants done with the
[1:13:05] word amen hallelujah now I want to read
[1:13:09] that one too it's go to a first John and
[1:13:13] I want to read that one they went out
[1:13:17] from us because they were not of us but
[1:13:19] let me find it real quick if anybody
[1:13:20] finds it oh yeah they're just first John
[1:13:22] chapter 2 verse 18 remember this is what
[1:13:31] the prophet of God is showing here you
[1:13:33] have to go with the word all the way
[1:13:36] those who don't of the Holy Spirit they
[1:13:38] separate themselves from the true
[1:13:39] believers just like Judas verse 18 - 18
[1:13:43] little children it is the last time and
[1:13:46] as she ever heard that Antichrist shall
[1:13:47] come even now are there many antichrists
[1:13:49] whereby we know that it is the last time
[1:13:53] that was 2,000 years ago what about
[1:13:56] today much there's many more Antichrist
[1:13:58] there's many more tears today they went
[1:14:02] out from us
[1:14:03] but they were not of us see they were
[1:14:07] not wheat seed they were tears the whole
[1:14:08] time for if they had been of us they no
[1:14:11] doubt would have continued with us but
[1:14:15] they went out that they might be made
[1:14:17] manifest that they were not all of us so
[1:14:21] see the separation with Judas it had to
[1:14:23] come because it was going to manifest
[1:14:25] which side he was on and see these
[1:14:28] trials in our lives they happened so we
[1:14:30] can manifest which side were on amen and
[1:14:33] for us it's a good thing right for us
[1:14:35] it's a good thing because it shows that
[1:14:36] we are manifesting we're the true bride
[1:14:38] we want to go deeper in the word we want
[1:14:40] all the word but for other people follow
[1:14:42] the way it shows they're not the true
[1:14:43] bride because they separate themselves
[1:14:45] from the Word of God they can't handle
[1:14:48] the word they won't want to feed on the
[1:14:49] word they'd rather have cares of the
[1:14:51] world all these things but we want all
[1:14:53] the word amen all right okay here's a
[1:15:06] second example in order to further
[1:15:08] clarify so if you got your Bibles let's
[1:15:11] go to Exodus 32 30 please Exodus 32 30
[1:15:29] X is 30 to 30 so this is a second
[1:15:34] example of idolatry and names being
[1:15:38] removed from the book of life
[1:15:40] we saw Judas and now here's another one
[1:15:45] oh yeah we saw this was actually a third
[1:15:48] example right because we already saw Dan
[1:15:51] and Ephraim so here's a third example we
[1:15:53] saw Dan and Ephraim Old Testament they
[1:15:55] went to New Testament Judas now we go
[1:15:56] back to the Old Testament a third
[1:15:58] example Exodus 32 33 34 and it came to
[1:16:03] pass on the morrow that Moses and the
[1:16:05] people you have sinned a great sin and
[1:16:06] now I will go up unto the Lord
[1:16:09] peradventure I shall make an atonement
[1:16:11] for your sin and Moses returned to the
[1:16:13] Lord and said oh this people has sinned
[1:16:15] a great sin and has made them gods of
[1:16:18] gold yet now if thou won't forgive their
[1:16:21] sin and if not blot me I pray thee out
[1:16:24] of that book which thou hast written and
[1:16:26] the Lord said unto Moses whosoever has
[1:16:29] sinned against me him will I blot out of
[1:16:32] my book
[1:16:34] therefore now go lead the people into
[1:16:36] the place of which I have spoken unto
[1:16:39] thee behold mine angel shall go before
[1:16:42] thee nevertheless in that day when I
[1:16:44] visit I will visit their sin upon them
[1:16:46] alright can you say amen to that you
[1:16:48] like that now look at Moses his heart it
[1:16:52] was in his heart that his name would be
[1:16:54] removed because he didn't want to see
[1:16:56] the people miss it can you imagine that
[1:16:59] I guess what Paul had the same desire
[1:17:01] remember Paul said I wish I myself could
[1:17:04] be curse and Israel could be saved that
[1:17:07] was in Romans 11 Paul said that and most
[1:17:10] of the same thing God I saved this
[1:17:12] person but let me be lost can you
[1:17:14] imagine that there's a part of me I
[1:17:16] don't want to be lost let's see when you
[1:17:19] get so full of love there's no there's
[1:17:20] so much that you want to say god I'd do
[1:17:22] anything to see this person saved that's
[1:17:25] how I feel like with my dad I talked to
[1:17:26] on the phone and you know different
[1:17:28] things were said and I just thought I'd
[1:17:30] do anything to see this man saved is
[1:17:31] there anything I can do to see this man
[1:17:33] saved I'd give anything to see him saved
[1:17:36] and so this is the heart of Moses blot
[1:17:40] me
[1:17:40] take my name out that they can be say
[1:17:43] but God said no you keep living the life
[1:17:44] you keep leading the people of God
[1:17:46] don't leave your position Church stay
[1:17:48] right in your position amen
[1:17:49] I like that level he tells Moses there
[1:17:51] do not leave your position hallelujah
[1:17:55] now he says this the Prophet said it's
[1:18:03] more than evident that the names have
[1:18:04] been and will be removed from the book
[1:18:06] of life air time should be no more in
[1:18:08] this particular places because of
[1:18:10] idolatry
[1:18:11] even as when Dan the Ephraim lost their
[1:18:14] rights as tribes were worshiping the
[1:18:15] golden calves all who worship the idols
[1:18:18] had their names removed from the book of
[1:18:19] life let's close with one more go to
[1:18:22] Psalm 69 please and I might need some
[1:18:25] help
[1:18:25] maybe brother Adam and Malachi maybe
[1:18:28] reading some here Psalm 69 21 so I'm 69
[1:18:33] 21
[1:18:42] 69 21 now the profit gives one more
[1:18:52] example
[1:18:55] he says when Israel rejected Jesus
[1:18:58] Christ as Messiah God blotted the
[1:19:02] majority of their names out I took this
[1:19:05] you know why this is striking because
[1:19:06] Jesus prayed Father forgive them for
[1:19:10] they know not what they do
[1:19:13] Jesus even prayed for some of them to be
[1:19:15] saved but the Bible says most of them
[1:19:17] had their names blotted out so what
[1:19:20] happened God only saved the
[1:19:21] predestinated see that's how we are we
[1:19:25] don't know whose predestinated we say
[1:19:26] God have mercy on those who are
[1:19:27] crucifying the word and saying our
[1:19:29] doctrines offer you know we don't preach
[1:19:31] the truth when all we do is preach the
[1:19:33] Bible that's all we do is preach the
[1:19:34] Bible oh you know Jesse's a Holy Roller
[1:19:37] he preaches this or he's in a call I've
[1:19:39] heard people tell me that I'm just well
[1:19:42] I'm in a cult that believes the Bible
[1:19:44] and that's all I could say I'm just a
[1:19:45] Bible believing cup it's not a cult like
[1:19:47] you'd say you know but there's just a
[1:19:49] group of believers that love the Lord
[1:19:51] Jesus Christ and that's what I'm guilty
[1:19:53] of that's what I'm guilty of but I'm
[1:19:54] just guilty of believing all the Word of
[1:19:56] God but here the Prophet is one more
[1:20:00] examples here's a fourth example Dan and
[1:20:02] Ephraim Judas are the last one we just
[1:20:06] read which was who is that again
[1:20:08] oh the days of Moses the people Moses
[1:20:10] let out who worship the golden calf
[1:20:12] their names are removed and then now
[1:20:15] those who rejected Christ its verses 21
[1:20:18] to 28 so maybe we start with you by that
[1:20:20] I might be okay
[1:20:21] 21 you read 21 22 and 23 that be okay
[1:20:25] [Music]
[1:20:57] hey man thank you sir now remember this
[1:21:00] is right after remember this was when
[1:21:02] Jesus on the cross right he said I
[1:21:03] thirst and they give him that gall to
[1:21:05] drink right in the vinegar and this is
[1:21:08] what God said is going to happen to the
[1:21:10] Israelites who rejected Christ did it
[1:21:12] happen absolutely remember they said let
[1:21:14] his blood be upon us and our children
[1:21:15] and the Jew has been persecuted ever
[1:21:18] since are you with me Church you
[1:21:19] understand that this is what the Bible
[1:21:21] said and yet jesus prayed Father forgive
[1:21:23] them they don't know what they're doing
[1:21:25] the elect would be forgiven amen the
[1:21:28] elect would be forgiven those who God
[1:21:30] foreknew that's right
[1:21:32] now look at verse 25 I'm sorry 26 now
[1:21:36] can you read 26 and 27 28 please those
[1:21:40] three
[1:21:57] all right look at that let them be
[1:22:00] blotted out of the book of the living
[1:22:02] can you can you see that the majority of
[1:22:05] people in Jesus day even though he
[1:22:06] prayed for them the majority had their
[1:22:08] names blotted out because they rejected
[1:22:10] the Messiah that rejected the word of
[1:22:12] the hour all right and the Prophet gives
[1:22:15] one more example of y'all a scripture
[1:22:16] closer here's one more example of God
[1:22:20] doing this and it's in acts 1346 let's
[1:22:26] go there acts 1346 X 1346 is this
[1:22:33] beautiful my I just I love these things
[1:22:35] like I said I love teaching he said I
[1:22:38] love to go scripture by scripture Acts
[1:22:40] 1346 because now you can see why
[1:22:45] people's names get removed thirteen I
[1:22:49] think it's 46 to 48 yeah that's right 46
[1:22:52] to 48 yeah and that's why it's so
[1:23:00] important for us on a Wednesday night
[1:23:01] because we want to make sure our name is
[1:23:04] on the Lamb's Book of Life right God
[1:23:06] knows ultimately but we have to make our
[1:23:08] calling and election sure we have to
[1:23:10] work out our salvation with fear and
[1:23:12] trembling and the way to do that is to
[1:23:15] be in the word all the way don't draw
[1:23:18] back and relax on your walk with God
[1:23:20] press forward and give everything you
[1:23:22] got whatever's in the way sacrifice it
[1:23:25] let it fall to the wayside and put
[1:23:27] Christ first amen we have to do that if
[1:23:29] not we're gonna be idolaters there's so
[1:23:32] much to idolize in this world but we
[1:23:35] don't want to idolize anything we just
[1:23:36] want to love Christ there's so many
[1:23:38] temptations but there's also so much
[1:23:40] power for the believer yeah amen
[1:23:43] all right verse 46 out 40 I'll read
[1:23:45] these now actually if you know if you
[1:23:48] remember this they're the Paul martyrs
[1:23:51] preached to Sabbath days in a row so two
[1:23:53] Saturdays in a row they preached and
[1:23:54] then verse 45 the Jews saw it and they
[1:23:58] were filled with envy they're jealous of
[1:24:00] the big crowds and they spake against
[1:24:02] those things which were spoken by Paul
[1:24:05] contradicting and they
[1:24:06] fiend other words that's to speak evil
[1:24:08] of so they called the Jesus preaching
[1:24:11] the the preaching of Jesus and Messiah
[1:24:13] they called that we'd say tommyrot or
[1:24:15] nonsense or trash whatever they said
[1:24:18] they blaspheme the Holy Ghost
[1:24:19] look at verse 46 then Palm Armas wax
[1:24:22] bold and said it was necessary that the
[1:24:24] Word of God should have first been
[1:24:26] spoken to you but seeing you put it from
[1:24:28] you and judge yourself unworthy of
[1:24:31] everlasting life lo we turn to the
[1:24:33] Gentiles so he said they've already
[1:24:35] judged themselves they've already showed
[1:24:37] they're not going to be saved so we've
[1:24:39] got to leave them and we got to go to
[1:24:40] the Gentiles
[1:24:41] they've already blast seemed right
[1:24:43] they've already left it they turn from
[1:24:45] the truth they don't want to hear they
[1:24:46] were already going to separate
[1:24:47] themselves so let him go we'll go to the
[1:24:50] Gentiles for the lord hath commanded us
[1:24:52] saying I've set to be a light for a
[1:24:53] Gentiles that thou should it be for
[1:24:55] salvation unto the ends of the earth and
[1:24:58] when the Gentiles heard this they were
[1:24:59] glad and glorified the word of Lord and
[1:25:01] as many words were ordained to eternal
[1:25:03] life believed amen let's stay on our
[1:25:05] feet by God's grace praise the Lord hey
[1:25:14] that's why you know I was thinking I was
[1:25:16] coming here tonight which believer
[1:25:22] doesn't wanna examine their life and
[1:25:25] make sure they're obeying God's Word and
[1:25:27] which believer doesn't want to make sure
[1:25:30] they take heed lest they fall every
[1:25:32] believer wants to do that because the
[1:25:34] Bible says I'm shooting that you should
[1:25:36] never pull back from the things of God
[1:25:39] we should just invest more on the things
[1:25:41] of God alright well that's how I
[1:25:58] strengthened us here tonight
[1:26:00] to take heed that you don't fall let's
[1:26:03] just pray Heavenly Father grateful again
[1:26:06] tonight lord I trusts more of the people
[1:26:14] receive something from you sure that's
[1:26:18] what we saw for examples when you remove
[1:26:23] and your Bible said these are written
[1:26:26] for our admonition this was greater than
[1:26:29] that we can benefit from this helpless
[1:26:32] Lord God not to have any items in our
[1:26:34] life
[1:26:35] I'm just going to pray from the church
[1:26:36] and the pray for myself or is it I
[1:26:38] didn't said that prayer this morning I
[1:26:40] don't want to phone to become a tiger
[1:26:43] we don't want family to become idols
[1:26:46] where we put family above the Word of
[1:26:48] God we don't want cars we don't anything
[1:26:53] Lord God become my idol in our lives we
[1:26:56] want a hunger and thirst after you we
[1:26:59] want you to have preeminence Lord
[1:27:02] everything so father we're bringing over
[1:27:05] this you said to take heed lest he fall
[1:27:10] remember that our temptations are common
[1:27:13] to all men I'm a pastor I go through
[1:27:16] temptations I understand
[1:27:18] pastors all around the world go through
[1:27:20] these same temptations be safe trials
[1:27:25] held leader remember that God is
[1:27:27] faithful he won't give me something I
[1:27:30] get in here I miss all Lord in our walks
[1:27:34] of life in our positions where you
[1:27:36] places help us off to remember these
[1:27:38] things do help us to receive these
[1:27:43] things and if your prophet said to be
[1:27:44] more settled have a foundation Lord to
[1:27:47] be more secured Christ that's what it's
[1:27:51] doing for us a little god that's what
[1:27:53] it's doing for me Lord
[1:27:54] we're not pulling away as foolish first
[1:27:57] one we're not pulling away from the
[1:27:58] things of God we're in the things of God
[1:28:00] all the way whatever you're doing in
[1:28:05] this local assembly whatever you're
[1:28:06] doing Lord and I in our our lives we
[1:28:09] want it to get to you we want to be

[1:29:28] strength believe you would read that
[1:29:29] scripture on Sunday morning you told us
[1:29:35] one thing to do when we feel weak that's
[1:29:38] the way to party waiting for strength
[1:29:41] Wow and disobey don't get don't get any
[1:29:44] patient and try to act upon the word
[1:29:47] like Saul tried to do it himself
[1:29:49] help us to be patient and know that
[1:29:51] strength will come other drinking comes
[1:29:55] or any dollar it's just a drought too
[1:29:58] long did we attach the money more to
[1:30:02] somebody else working I know numerous
[1:30:07] people that told me when I get
[1:30:08] discouraged of Jesse I think of you and
[1:30:10] I appreciate such a small opportunity
[1:30:12] and I think if you can do it I can do it
[1:30:15] [Music]
[1:30:19] because I love nothing of other people
[1:30:22] have smaller churches that we have and
[1:30:24] it's not about the number as you Akaka
[1:30:26] Tallis it's about the quality of the
[1:30:28] homes the quantity of people the
[1:30:32] quantity of emotion or something like
[1:30:36] that or even gifts where's the quality
[1:30:38] of the word and the holy spirit so
[1:30:40] all the lives that we live help us to
[1:30:46] take hers norm so glad my needs will
[1:30:58] wait upon you Oh God
