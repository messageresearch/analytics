========================================

trying to trying to be a real man nowadays. And I realized I walk in I see brother Jose that's a real beard right there. I heard a brother say one time he said that's a beard that other beards are jealous of and uh that's a factual thing. So uh we appreciate our brother his uh his great gift God has given him because some of us others can't do stuff like that. So I think it was about 40 when it really kicked in that we could uh do such things. But uh we want to uh anyway just uh thank God for your pastor here and uh brother Jesse's a he's a real a real brother in Christ and uh we know that God will bring a rapture people into a rapture from this place. I'm confident about that. I'm I'm absolutely believe that 100%. Uh so that means that I'm I'm not just preaching to just some people today. I'm preaching to the bride of Jesus Christ. Oh my. Look at brother Vang's got one too. Wow. Hallelujah. But uh I do believe that the bride of Christ is here. Yeah. Yeah. You know how it goes. Um but um let's go ahead and get into our Bibles here. We we appreciate brother Jesse's sacrifice. It's a it's a very difficult thing to be a pastor, especially if you're a real pastor. Uh many have made a pastor a five-fold ministry that that that pastors all of it. Uh but we're so glad that God has uh ordained men to be faithful uh as a shepherd where they're called to be. And uh with that uh you know what it's it's a very thankless uh job so to say. Uh it's not a job but it's a calling. Um and if you think about it in the New Testament um uh how many times uh can anyone tell me how many times is the word pastor actually written in the New Testament? One time. five-fold ministry. One time a shepherd. Well, why? Now, think about it. In Egypt, uh Egypt viewed a shepherd as an abomination. It was a hated a hated occupation. That's why many times you see a shepherd will want to go out and preach everywhere and try to gain some sort of uh popularity or position or something. But a real shepherd uh is one who will spend most of his time, if not almost all of his time, right at home with the sheep. He he gets a smell of the sheep on him. And uh he's probably got a little smell himself, I reckon. I I suppose I do. Uh but we came here to be a blessing to you. And I'm I'm so glad I uh that's a real man of God right there. And uh I have no doubt about that. So uh and we got some real Christians here. And uh uh you know, sometimes I I come back. It's been a long time since I've been here, but uh we're glad to be here. And I I just trust that we can put our spiritual thinking caps on today. You know, you know, you know the way I am. Uh anyone that's been here long enough, I I I just dig right into the word and I just let her roll. So, that's just kind of the way I I've always been. I want to say one more uh thing is that uh um it won't be long, brother sister. It won't be long till this rapture. I'm confident of that. Um I'm watching things that are happening uh in the spiritual realm, in the natural realm. Uh it's not going to be long. So, we we've got to consecrate our way to God. Amen. and do everything we can uh to uh to just love him. &gt;&gt; Love him with everything you got. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not a merit. Uh but uh we understand that uh works is faith expressed. &gt;&gt; So uh we we show we love him by our works, but our works really don't mean much more than that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe you've been well taught here. I know that. Uh so we're not trying to do anything there. But uh I want to I want to preach something to set you free today. Uh uh just something just as I was praying, just laboring. I preached this at the home church just recently and uh we might uh just try to bring it all together for you if we can. Um but yet uh let's uh go ahead and get our Bibles out if we can. Uh we already done waved them before the Lord in worship. I see I got all my my beautiful nieces here, all these other Sister Naomi's daughters. Everybody's just growing up and uh just uh beautiful as ever. And I see some new faces, a couple little ones, and God bless them. And uh it's a great place that uh that we're at. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we're going to open up to Exodus 23:10. Um, these things could really, really, really be um preached uh in numerous numerous sermons. Uh, but we're going to try to bring a thought to you uh as quickly as concisely as we possibly can. Uh, seeing the time and uh by God's grace uh we will uh do our best to sew this in. And I want you to rejoice. Uh I I want you to love the Lord because you you are a very ordained people to be standing at the se end of the seventh church age. You're very blessed, tremendously blessed. Uh we are watching we're watching preachers fall away. We're watching individuals fall away uh at numbers that uh would be uh esteemed as amazing because um once you come into this this calling of God, I'm going to say it like that because it's not what we find is that preachers can get it on here in the mind level, individuals can have it on the mind level, but have they actually met the met the person or the God of this message? &gt;&gt; And that's where we're really at right now. How many want to meet God? Amen. just &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I wish I had 20 sermons. I got 20 sermons in a series right now going with that. Uh but uh I won't be able to do that today, but we'll we'll just uh sew in right here. Exodus 23:10. Then we'll go to Hebrews 4. Uh and then one more place, uh Exodus 23, it says uh and six years thou shalt sew thy land and thy and shall gather in the fruits thereof, but in the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still. I like that. &gt;&gt; The seven's always the rest. Ain't that right? Uh you realize this seventh church age, even though it's the hardest of all ages, this is actually an age of rest. &gt;&gt; Should be. &gt;&gt; We'll get to something in just a little bit. That the poor of thy people may eat. Uh and what they leave the beast of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard and with thy olive. Amen. Uh seventh year, what' they have to do? They had a sabbatical uh a sabbatical rest or a sabbatical year, right? Um, Hebrews 4:1. &gt;&gt; After that, we'll go to John 8. I've, uh, taken taken a lot of my sermons offline. Just kind of felt led to do that. Uh, didn't want to be anybody else's pastor. I thought that would be something appropriate. So, most you, if almost all of you, probably have not heard this, uh, which I trust would be a blessing to you. Uh Hebrews 4:1 it says, "Let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest." Uh this this should be the thing that we're worried about. Any of you should seem to come short of it. I don't want anybody here to come short of that. Your pastor don't, right? I don't want anybody at home to come short of it. For unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them. But the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it. Amen. Uh so this rest, notice it's actually a mixture of hearing the word and and placing faith on it. &gt;&gt; You've we've got to place faith on the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For we which have believed do enter into rest uh as he has as he said, as I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest, although the works were finished from the foundation of the world, it's already been finished. Hallelujah. Uh for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on the w on this wise and God did rest the seventh day from all his works and in this place again uh if they shall enter into my rest. Amen. We want to be a people of rest right. Uh rest that word rest means it means to cease from motion. So where's your trying? &gt;&gt; No wonder brother Brooks sung that song. It's not not in trying but in trusting. That's right. &gt;&gt; Okay. John 8:34, last one. We We like this. I know you do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus answered them saying, uh, answer them, verily, verily, I say unto you, whosoever committh sin uh is the servant of sin. You become a servant to it. Right? &gt;&gt; And the servant abideth not in the house forever, but the son abideth forever. Amen. And if the son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. Uh let's tap in today and see how free we are and then why we should be free and how much of amazing word God has given us to be free. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads for a word of prayer. God sees your needs, your hearts, and I believe these things have already been prayed for. But let's continue to pray. Uh pray unseeing, without ceasing. Lord Jesus, we approach you today, oh God, uh just the reading of the word, and we'd ask you to add your blessings to it, Lord. And Lord, as we've become so accustomed to being in your presence, uh so accustomed to how a gift works, oh God, uh we're asking today, Lord, that you just be mighty in this place, oh God. Uh I pray, oh God, that you'd be able to do marvels in the people's eyes uh uh in the spiritual realm, in their lives, oh God. uh as Lord, I I see that you're doing a transition in me, oh God. So Lord, we're believing that uh this word is is a word that's in season for this people, Lord. Uh it's been on my heart, oh God, the last uh day or so just to really go this way. So Lord, uh we're believing that you'll touch them. And Lord, we're asking, oh God, that you just uh uh we understand that, Lord, it's only you that can open the eyes of the people, Lord. And Lord, so many times we come to church and we hear something and we just move to the next word. But oh God, uh even so much and that's all right. But Lord, we would love to actually apply every word that you feed us with and to watch the result of that in our daily walk, Lord. So we're asking uh that you would allow that to be upon this people today. Let their eyes be wide open, oh God. Uh seeing the fullness of your spirit moving on their behalf in their midst. So Lord, we believe that you'll do that now. now and we're just asking that Lord we'd all be yielded because if we can get yielded and if we can get in one place in one accord uh surely oh God there's there's no limit to what you could do. So God move in our midst for the glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. This may have been preached over here uh before but we're going to rehearse it if it has been. Uh but then uh the Lord just kind of just seemed to uh unopen these things to us uh in a way that we believe it'll be a blessing to you. And uh today we're we're going to uh work with the Hebrew word here. Um maybe you've heard it uh and we want to touch today the unveiling uh unveiling the shmita and uh how many are familiar with the shmita? All right, that's good. I got no hands up. Hallelujah. We got a new one coming. But uh we've been preaching a series at home and the Lord just really gave us an uh an inspiration to do so. And we were w u with with leaving uh Israel leaving Egypt in an Exodus. And then uh they of course they entered a wilderness period. And uh uh anyway, they were not meant to be in that wilderness long, but yet it was an ordained season for them that it would be that way. And uh what we're actually finding today is that these things are actually ordained in our lives. Isn't it something that we could be 60 years after the death of a prophet and here we are? Uh why are we here? What's going on? Uh so uh we have a a very interesting circumstance and it's been hit in many ways and many thoughts and many ideas uh especially in the realms of the message. But uh uh of course that uh would talk about us, right? because we we believe this message, right? But we would like to uh just maybe uh move in a route according to something the Lord has shown us. Uh but notice the unveiling uh the Shmita there. Uh so we'd like to open your eyes to it. Now uh this is not an advertisement for a Jonathan Khan book. Some of you say, "Oh, I know what the Shmita uh he wrote a book uh uh about the Shmita." He sure did. Uh but we're not here to to advertise a book or even I can't even tell you what's in it because I don't don't fully understand that but I haven't read it. But uh we'd like to follow the word route for that this morning. And uh if you've read that then then uh you can apply what uh you so desire. Amen. Uh but we would like this to be unveiled to us. And uh if you can see this then this will be a great blessing to you. Uh so uh we want to start here that uh uh remember in God's law uh how he would orchestrate it amongst the people. Uh God always worked with sevens, right? Seven was always uh a finish. It was always a completion in God's mind. Uh but yet uh uh we understand that that was very important because uh there would there would be seven Old Testament church ages and then there would be seven New Testament church ages, right? uh even when God's seen a dispensation of time that was given for a specific people, he himself would actually come on the scene and uh he would do uh great things especially in that seventh, right? Uh aren't you glad that you've been born in the seventh church age? Amen. Uh as our prophet would say, he said, he said, "There no other age I'd like to live in, the age of the rapture." And then HE'D SAY, "OH, I HOPE I LIVE TO SEE IT." AMEN. We understand he he's gone now, right? Uh but thank God that there'll be a shout and then a voice and that voice will raise up uh those who had went before, right? Uh to move them into the season of this rapture, right? But uh we want to today start working with the sabbatical year. I'm not going to try to sit here very long because I've got to get to the schmita. All right. But uh in uh Leviticus 25:1, it says, "The Lord spake unto Moses and Mount Si." NOTICE IT THIS IS JUST LEAVING EGYPT WITHIN A COUPLE WEEKS, RIGHT? Uh a month at most. And what remember the people could not enter into uh the right covenant with God BECAUSE THEY WERE SCARED of God, right? Therefore, THEY WANTED A LAW. AND WHEN THEY WANTED A LAW, WHAT' GOD DO? HE SAID, "OKAY, MOSES, AMEN, you can enter into this communion with me. You come up on high and I'll reveal the word to you." Amen. UH SO HERE NOW MOSES IS ENTERING INTO Mount Si and notice UH THIS IS LONG BEFORE THEY GET INTO THE LAND BUT HE'S ACTUALLY giving them a revelation about the future. All right. And he said speak unto the children of Israel and SAY UNTO THEM WHEN YE COME into the land which I give you. All right. So notice this is uh remember they were wandering in the wilderness for 40 years. BUT HE SAYS UH GOD TELLS HIM WHEN YOU GO INTO THAT LAND, &gt;&gt; that land of rest, THAT LAND OF THE HOLY GHOST, &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH, then shall the land keep a Sabbath unto the Lord. The land would have a Sabbath. Oh my. Six years thou shalt sew thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof. But in the seventh year shall be a Sabbath of rest unto the land. A Sabbath for the Lord. Amen. It's for the land. But notice it's a Sabbath for the Lord. &gt;&gt; REMEMBER ON THAT SEVENTH DAY THE LORD RESTED. AMEN. And he says uh that which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest uh thou shalt not reap neither gather the grapes of the vine undressed. For it is a year of rest unto the land. Amen. And the Sabbath of the land shall be meat for you, for thee, for thy servant, for thy maid, for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojoureneth uh with thee. Amen. On that seventh year, uh what would happen of course IS GOD WOULD IN ONCE THEY WERE getting into the promised land that seventh year they were to rest. Amen. The land would have a rest. Hallelujah. The people would freely be able to live on a land at rest. Now understand what that means. That means when they went in there and they positionally placed it THAT WHAT? THAT NO ONE WOULD BE ABLE TO PLANT that ground. They would have to let it rest. &gt;&gt; The animals could eat wherever they want. The people could eat wherever they want. They could be a free people. Amen. &gt;&gt; NOW, THIS IS POWERFUL BECAUSE YOU'RE A FREE PEOPLE. AMEN. We're in a seven church age. WE HAVE A GOD THAT SENT A WORD TO SET US FREE. AMEN. AND BROTHER, SISTER, IT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE READ. THAT WHOM THE SON IS SET FREE IS FREE INDEED. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN REJOICE. ARE YOU FREE? AMEN. YOU CAN REJOICE. I'M FREE. AMEN. NOT BECAUSE OF MY WORKS, BUT BECAUSE OF HIS LOVE AND GRACE AND SHED BLOOD FOR ME. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; NOW, I'm going to get to something here that's very ironic because we find that this Sabbath, even historically, you hardly hear of anything of it in the Bible. It's not very uh often mentioned. And most of it is most likely because of this uh because even when God gave them the law, it was a conditional thing because frankly they were under the law. Now remember, are you under a law today? Hallelujah. Our prophet said you're under the unwritten law of choice. Hallelujah. But we're actually under grace. Maybe I'll go this way today &gt;&gt; later on. We'll see. Maybe I'll go through it now. I don't know. Whatever the Lord wants me to do, that's where I want to be. BUT NOTICE HERE, GOD actually gave them, remember, everything was talking about this land of milk and honey. Everything was talking how a great place it's going to be, and it's going to be the best thing ever for them. But when God actually sent them in in Leviticus 26 says, "But if you will not hearken unto me and will not do all these commandments, and if ye shall despise my statutes, or if ye your soul abhore my judgment, so that you will not do all my commandments, but that ye break my covenant." And he actually starts going through and showing how they're going to be destroyed in every single way you could think of. &gt;&gt; But now he moves down uh to a place they won't even be at the land. He says, "I will scatter you among the heathen." 33rd verse. AND WILL DRAW OUT A SWORD AFTER YOU, and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste. But notice, then your then uh shall the land enjoy her Sabbath as long as it lith desolate, and ye be in your enemy's land. Even the land shall the land rest and enjoy her Sabbath. &gt;&gt; The land was going to rest whether they were there or not. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just because they didn't want to enter into a love for God and stay in that land. They knew this beforehand and they still served other gods. They still did not put Christ where Christ belonged. How many want to put Christ where he belongs? Amen. He belongs in you. Amen. HE WANTS TO DWELL IN YOU, LIVE IN YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; He is life &gt;&gt; and life abundantly. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "And upon them that are left alive of you, I will send a faintness into their hearts and into the land of their enemies. Uh, and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them, and they shall flee as as fleeing from a sword, and they shall fall when none pursueth." Isn't that something? They wouldn't even be able to battle if they didn't love the word of God. If they didn't just serve the Lord. Isn't &gt;&gt; that something? But they still were in a land that was going to rest. So we have a choice. We can enter into something. &gt;&gt; Let's get into it. All right. So notice I actually preached this. This is what the part of the 20 sermons is. Is that God actually took them right up to the land of promise and what they took the report of uh the um the testimony of 10 false spies and they did not go into the land. But when you look at the scripture, uh God says two things. Uh he says that he would have to teach them to war and that he would have to teach them that man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God. He would prove them in the wilderness. He would teach them how to fight. &gt;&gt; He would teach them what UH HOW TO LIVE ON THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND, BROTHER, SISTER? GOD IS PROVING US RIGHT NOW IF we'll live by the word OF GOD. HE'S TELL HE'S SHOWING US THAT WE CAN LIVE UH under the condition TO BE A FIGHTER FOR THE LORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE A SOLDIER. AMEN. YOU'RE A FIGHTER. AND BROTHER, SISTER, NOTICE, IF THEY DIDN'T LIVE BY THE WORD, THEIR ENEMIES WOULD CONSTANTLY BEAT THEM UP. &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER, SISTER, IF YOU DON'T LIVE BY THE WORD, THEN THE ENEMY IS GOING TO GET SICKNESS IN YOUR LIFE. HE'S GOING TO GET WHAT? HE'S GOING TO GET WEAK SPOTS ALL OVER YOUR MIND WHERE YOU YOU CAN'T STAND ON THE WORD. YOU CAN'T DEFY THE DEVIL. BROTHER, SISTER, THERE'S A GOD THAT WE SERVE. AMEN. WHO COULD GET ON DAVID AND GO TO AN UNCIRCUMCISED PHILISTINE AND SAY, "TODAY YOUR HEAD WILL BE MINE." AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL IS NO MATCH FOR YOUR GOD. THE DEVIL'S NO MATCH FOR YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GOD TEACH US HOW TO LIVE BY THIS WORD. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO, we understand and let's just go through this very quickly and then we're going to get right moving. So, they always say you can't preach on Leviticus. Everybody will fall asleep. That's not true though, right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But I want us to see the sevens with God. We could have the Sabbath day right here if we wanted over here. But God actually and the commentators tell us that these sevens actually increase to a more powerful thing. Said God starts with a Sabbath, a day of rest, but then God would bring a schmita every seven years, a sabbatical year. But then God would actually at the end of seven sevenyear cycles, God would actually bring a jubilee. All these are of course very important. But notice uh every seven years, every 50 years. But notice the land use, the land lies follow. You can't till the ground in in the in the sabbatical year, the schmita. You you in the Jubilee, this is the difference. The land actually returns to its original owners. &gt;&gt; You see how it gets greater? We have a day of rest to rest our body, to rest in worshiping the Lord, right? But then God would ACTUALLY ALLOW THE LAND to have its rest. But at the end of it, he would not only let the land rest, but he would what? ALLOW IT TO GO BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL OWNERS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Notice debt forgiveness. Yes. This is going to become in play. Slavery. No. Yes. So the jubilee was not to uh relieve from slavery in its purpose. Even though at the end of that 49th year it was actually a shita as well. The purpose is different. Now this stuff's deep. So uh it's just tasty. Brother Jess be he might be smiling a little bit but let How many want to understand the schmita a little bit? &gt;&gt; All right. Uh okay. Let's uh get on Amazon. Let's go buy 12 uh Jonathan Khan books and we'll be ready to go. Let's just see what the word says until Amazon's probably late in delivery anyway. Deuteronomy 15. Let's begin to go THROUGH THIS. HERE IT IS. This is the sabbatical year. THIS IS THAT SEVENTH YEAR. NOW, now look at what the scripture says here. Uh this is God's word. It says, "At the end of every seven years, thou shalt make a release." All right. &gt;&gt; So, notice I THOUGHT THE LAND WAS JUST RESTING. They were going to have to make a release. And this is the manner of the release. Every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbor shall release it. He shall not exact it of his neighbor or of his BROTHER BECAUSE IT IS CALLED the Lord's release. This is actually a release for the people. Now, here's the thing. What does this word release? Release. I got an underline. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? IT'S ACTUALLY MEANS SHITA. &gt;&gt; That word schmida is ACTUALLY WHAT IS CALLED the release. NOW WATCH WHAT. LOOK AT HOW POWERFUL THIS IS. At the end of every seven years. Of course, that's typing something. Uh, IT'S ACTUALLY TYPING SOMETHING WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW. HALLELUJAH. I don't know if you know this, but we're at the end of the seventh church age. Notice, not at the BEGINNING OF IT, NOT AT THE MIDDLE OF IT, BUT IT'S RIGHT AT THE VERY END OF THE SEVEN-YEAR CYCLE. GOD LAID THAT IN HIS word from Sinai. AMEN. THAT WHAT? THERE WOULD BE A HOLY GHOST REST FOR THE PEOPLE. BUT IT WOULD NOT JUST BE THE LAND THAT'S AT REST. IT WOULD ALSO BE THAT THE PEOPLE WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE A SCHMITA. AMEN. &gt;&gt; A SHMITA. THEY THEMSELVES WOULD be released. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NOW NOTICE WHAT THAT IS. EVERY CREDITOR THAT LENDETH OUGHT UNTO HIS NEIGHBOR SHALL RELEASE IT. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; IT WAS TO RELEASE EVERY OUNCE OF DEBT, &gt;&gt; to a Hebrew, &gt;&gt; to a spiritual Israelite. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. DO YOU SEE IT, BROTHER, SISTER, THAT THEREFORE AT THE END OF THE SEVEN CHURCH AGE, THERE WOULD BE A RELEASE THAT WOULD STRIKE THE PEOPLE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THINK ABOUT IT. WHY AREN'T WE SMILING? &gt;&gt; WHY AREN'T WE WHY AREN'T WE UH UH EVEN EXPERIENCING THE SAME TYPE OF HOLY GHOST MOVEMENT THAT THAT ISUZA HAD &gt;&gt; THAT BROTHER BRANDHAM'S AGE HAD &gt;&gt; WITHIN THAT SESSION. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE REJOICING. THEY THEY WERE HALLELUJAH. GLORY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT NOTICE AT THE END OF THE SEVEN CHURCH AGE, IT WOULD WHAT? IT WOULD GET PROGRESSIVELY HARDER. There'd be MORE THINGS TO ENSLAVE. &gt;&gt; THERE WOULD BE MORE THINGS TO BRING YOU UNDER A DEBT. AMEN. AND WHAT? IT WOULD CAUSE YOU TO FEEL LIKE YOU ARE BOUND TO SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Now, this is going to become pretty powerful. And this is how the Lord revealed it to me. But notice, we see at the end of the seventh or at the end of the Sabbath year, the end of that seventh church age, there would be a release. Not right here. Not right here. Right here. &gt;&gt; It was for right there. That's why the Jubilee there was no release for it. Because the release, now think about this, seven cycles of seven and then there's a jubilee. The jubilee would start the 50th year. But remember, they were right at THE END OF THE seventh year, which was what? THE FEAST OF TRUMPETS, the feast day of atonement, the feast of tabernacles. And this IS THE TIME WHERE GOD WOULD SET THE PEOPLE FREE FROM THEIR WHAT? THEIR DEBT. &gt;&gt; BUT NOTICE I I WANT US TO CATCH THIS TODAY BECAUSE SO MANY TIMES WE MISS WHAT THIS IS. WHAT WAS THAT YEAR of release? It was actually based on the individual. It's the Lord's release. But notice any indebt THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO SOMEONE ELSE, any person WHO WOULD BE ABLE TO HOLD YOU &gt;&gt; TO BRING YOU UNDER THEIR OWN power to control you. Now watch how significant that is. It's brotherly kindness. &gt;&gt; Watch what release means. TO SET FREE FROM RESTRAINT of any kind. &gt;&gt; You're supposed to be in Christ completely free. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't know if we KNOW THIS, BUT BUT YOU YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WHO SHOULD ORCHESTRATE a a good portion of our amens and and our and our zeal and excitement for the Lord. It should be the inddwelling presence of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE WHAT THAT'LL MAKE YOU SO YOU DON'T CARE WHAT YOU'RE DOING NO MATTER WHERE YOU'RE AT. &gt;&gt; You can REJOICE UH IN CHRIST LIKE LIKE PAUL AND SILAS IN STOCKS AND BONDS SINGING WORSHIP TO GOD. AND WHAT THERE THEY WERE FREE. AMEN. IN STOCKS AND BONDS. BUT EVEN WHEN THEY DID IT, WATCH THE STOCKS AND BONDS WERE BROKE AND THEY HAD TO GO FREE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO THAT SHAMINA IT MEANS TO SET FREE FROM RESTRAINT OF ANY KIND either physical or moral. &gt;&gt; That's something many times we feel like someone has put us under uh some sort of legalism or law. This is why of course the four organ uh organizational spirits come into play because you see pastors are meant to be led of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; They are Holy Ghost leaders. But do you realize that in in the body of Christ that a pastor is not the head? There's only one head. It's Christ. &gt;&gt; Now he's an overseer. So he's watching the sheep. He's he's doing those things. But who ought to be your leadership? &gt;&gt; WHO OUGHT TO BE THE ONE TO SET YOU FREE? SO THAT'S WHY NICKELISM IS SO EVIL BECAUSE IT GETS YOU TO depend on the works and MERITS OF OF A pastor &gt;&gt; or a PREACHER AND TO NOT BE SOLELY SOLD OUT TO GOD YOURSELF TO DO EVERYTHING HE WANTS YOU to do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother, sister, we're not here JUST TO SIT ON A CHAIR AND AND HEAR THE WORD. WE'RE HERE TO SERVE GOD. AMEN. TO SERVE YOUR BROTHER, TO SERVE YOUR SISTER. AMEN. TO WANT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO FORWARD THE WORK OF JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. IT IS A BODY WORK. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I LIKE THIS. TO LIBERATE FROM PRISON. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; Confinement or servitude. &gt;&gt; Do you realize that we should not be constrained by one devil right now? Not even one. That's why the promise was when they got into the land that one of you would chase a hundred. &gt;&gt; 10 of you shall chase 10,000, right? However many it was. &gt;&gt; You are actually made to absolutely rampage Satan's kingdom. &gt;&gt; Who did this? Christ did this. Matthew 11:28. COME UNTO ME ALL YOU that labor and are heavy laden, AND I WILL GIVE you rest. Your pastor's going to give you rest. &gt;&gt; His preaching's GOING TO GIVE YOU REST. &gt;&gt; He's going to preach YOU THE WORD, BUT JUST BECAUSE HE'S PREACHING THE WORD DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU'RE ACCEPTING THE PERSON. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT TO ACCEPT THE PERSON OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "I WILL GIVE YOU REST. TAKE MY YOKE UPON YOU AND LEARN OF ME, FOR I am meek AND LOWLY IN HEART, AND YE SHALL FIND REST UNTO YOUR SOULS. FOR MY YOKE is easy and my burden is light. &gt;&gt; HE IS the rest. HE IS THE SCHMITA. AMEN. HE IS THE RELEASE. NO WONDER IN ISAIAH 61 HE COULD TALK ABOUT THE ACCEPTABLE YEAR OF THE LORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; TO SET THE CAPTIVES FREE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN BE FREE RIGHT NOW. NOT JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE LAYS THEIR HANDS ON YOU, BUT BECAUSE YOU ACCEPT THE WORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. REVEAL THAT TO ME. I'M FREE. I HAVE BEEN RELEASED. AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's why it's the unveiling of the schmita. &gt;&gt; Now, this is powerful. We're tying in a lot of stuff, but notice when you go to Deuteronomy 3:19, this is where it's really kicked in for me. And Moses wrote this law and delivered it under the priests, the sons of Levi. This is the 40th year. When you actually look at Deuteronomy and Numbers and so forth, you'll actually find that there's a ton said about the first year and a ton said about the 40th year. There's not a lot that's said in between. Hallelujah. But here it is IN THE 40TH YEAR. WATCH THIS. AND SO GOD TELLS THEM IN MOUNT SI, the land's going to have a release. BUT WATCH THIS. AND MOSES WROTE THIS LAW and delivered unto the priests the sons of Levi which bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord and unto all the elders of Israel. And Moses commanded them, saying, "At the end of every seven years, &gt;&gt; the Schmidita year, &gt;&gt; THIS WOULD ALSO HAVE TO HAPPEN &gt;&gt; IN THE SOMNITY OF the year of release, IN THE FEAST OF TABERNACLES, when all Israel is come to appear before THE LORD THY THY GOD IN THE PLACE WHICH HE SHALL CHOOSE. There's a lot there. I can't go into that. Thou shalt READ THIS LAW BEFORE ALL ISRAEL in their hearing. Isn't that something? So in the Schmidita year, remember, of course, they would have uh a weekly service and so forth, BUT THEY SAID WHAT WHAT MADE THIS DIFFERENT THAT when they actually came into that shita in the promised land THAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE THE PRIESTS ACTUALLY BRING THE REVELATION OF THE entire word, &gt;&gt; which of course at THIS POINT IN TIME, HOW MANY BOOKS OF THE BIBLE WERE THERE? FIVE. It's called the Pentatuk. Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND WHAT? GOD WOULD HAVE THIS WORD READ EVERY SEVEN YEARS. THE ENTIRE WORD REVEALED TO THE PEOPLE. CHECK THIS OUT. LOOK AT THIS. OH, OUR PREACHERS BEEN PREACHING ABOUT THIS, BUT LOOK, HE'S READING IT ALL. WE'RE GETTING THE WHOLE WORD RIGHT NOW. AMEN. AND THAT'S WHAT GOD DID, BROTHER, SISTER, WHEN GOD BROUGHT THAT SEVENTH ANGEL. AMEN. HE WAS SETTING UP THE SCENE SO THAT THE WHOLE WORD WOULD BE MADE KNOWN TO YOU. AMEN. SO YOU COULD BELIEVE IT. AMEN. YOU COULD WHAT? RECEIVE IT AND THEREFORE YOU WOULD BE RELEASED. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T HAVE A RELEASE WITHOUT THE UNVEILING OF THE BOOK. AMEN. I CAN GET EXCITED about that. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'VE RECEIVED. &gt;&gt; BROTHER, SISTER, you understand in the vast realm of Christendom, I would say that there's less. And our prophet said it. He said when it comes to the seventh angel, he said it would be 1/100th of 1%. Do you realize how important you are to God? HE LOVES YOU, BROTHER. AMEN. HE LOVES YOU, SISTER. AMEN. WHY? CUZ HE CHOSE YOU FOR THE HEARING OF THE WORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; So what does he say? Thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing. &gt;&gt; They had to hear the word. That's what your pastors use for the five-fold ministry. That's why the scripture says it's for the perfecting of the saints. Ephesians 4. &gt;&gt; Gather the people together. Isn't this something? Because every year they'd have to do this three times. But when it came to the shmita, everyone was gathered. Everyone. WATCH THIS. GATHER THE PEOPLE TOGETHER. MEN, WOMEN, CHILDREN, THY STRANGER, THE THE GENTILE, THAT IT'S WITHIN THY GATES, THAT THEY MAY HEAR AND THAT THEY MAY LEARN AND AND FEAR THE LORD YOUR GOD AND OBSERVE TO DO ALL THE WORDS OF THIS LAW. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; How many remember the feast? The feast said what? You shall gather your males three times a year. But when IT CAME TO THE UNVEILING OF THE WORD, EVEN A CHILD COULD HEAR IT. AMEN. EVEN A STRANGER COULD HEAR IT. AMEN. GOD WAS MAKING THE WORD AVAILABLE FOR EVERYBODY. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. And notice AND THAT THEIR CHILDREN WHICH HAVE NOT KNOWN ANYTHING. You realize Sunday school is not parents. You understand that Sunday school was not meant to teach your children the word and that's it. Right. &gt;&gt; You got to teach them, parent. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't even stop there as a pastor. I say, you know what? Everybody in this church should be what? Sewing the word into our children. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why? It's our responsibility. It's the next generation. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THEY DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING. STAY HERE AND learn to fear THE LORD YOUR GOD AS LONG AS YOU LIVE IN THE LAND WHETHER YOU GO OVER JORDAN to possess it. &gt;&gt; Oh my Oh my. Now I'm going to try to be quick with this. Now notice this. So in the sabbatical year says of a foreigner, a stranger, thou mayest exacted again. So the foreigner was not released in the sabbatical. still had to pay up. &gt;&gt; But that which is thine with thy brother. Brotherly kindness. &gt;&gt; Thine hand shall release. &gt;&gt; SAY WHEN THERE SHALL BE NO POOR AMONG YOU. FOR THE LORD SHALL GREATLY bless thee in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it. Hallelujah. They were called to BE IN THAT LAND A BLESSED PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; DO YOU FEEL BLESSED RIGHT NOW? DO YOU FEEL EXCITED ABOUT WHAT GOD HAS DONE FOR YOU? AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BROTHER, SISTER, I'M WATCHING A CYCLE RIGHT NOW THAT THAT WE LITERALLY HAD A DEMON-POSSESSED person come in the church and they came and THEY FOCUSED RIGHT ON ME AND AND WITHIN WITHIN FIVE minutes that demon left that man shaking, growling. Then he says, "MY KNEE HURTS." HE SAID, "WOULD YOU PRAY FOR ME AFTER YOU GOT DELIVERED?" WE PRAYED FOR HIS KNEE. GUESS WHAT GOD DID? GOD HEALED IT. HE SAID, "I'VE I'VE HAD THIS MY AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER, AND GOD HEALED HIM." &gt;&gt; Then on a PRAYER NIGHT, HE COMES AND HE SAYS, HE SAYS, "MAN, I" and he's adopted. He was he was an adopted person. Had to leave his family. His dad was a Satanist. And and he said he said, "Uh, MY BIOLOGICAL MOTHER." HE SAID, "Can you pray for my biological mother? Her ankle has hurt uh her whole life, too." And we prayed for him right there. It's just six or eight, 10 of us right there. And we prayed for him. He comes that that Thursday and he says, "Pastor, I got to tell you something." He said, "My mom called me yesterday." And she said, "She don't know what happened, but her ankle is healed." AND HE SAID, "SO I ASKED HER, I SAID, "WHEN DID IT HAPPEN?" AND SHE SAID, "IT WAS TUESDAY NIGHT. RIGHT? GOING ON DURING OUR PRAYER MEETING. AMEN. WHAT WE APPEALED TO THE GOD THAT'S AT THE MERCY SEAT. AND YES, IT IS TRUE. HE IS THE HIGH PRIEST OF OUR PROFESSION. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE IS EVER LIVING TO MAKE INTERCESSIONS FOR YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOT FOR JUST A PREACHER, BUT FOR YOU. YOU ARE HIS SONS AND DAUGHTERS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. He's worthy. &gt;&gt; HE'S A GREAT GOD. AMEN. HE'S WORTHY OF EVERY OUNCE OF PRAISE THAT COULD EVER COME FROM ANY OF OUR LIPS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND THAT MUCH MORE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WE OUGHT TO BE LIKE THE SARAPHIMS IN HEAVEN. HOLY, HOLY, HOLY. AMEN. HOLY, HOLY, HOLY. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said he said that's how they live in his presence. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Notice it's all blessing. I'm going to skip it for time sake. But now notice these were a stiff necked people. That's why God said, you know what, you won't even you probably if you don't love the Lord and and obey his word and want his word, then you won't even be in the land. But the land's going to be blessed nonetheless, whether you're there or not. Isn't that good? I I'll tell you, I want to be in that land. I want to live in there. Amen. Hallelujah. I want every waking moment to be bound as a prisoner of love to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now he even comes to the end of it and he says, "BEWARE THAT THERE BE NOT A thought in thy wicked heart, saying, the seventh year, the year of release is at hand, and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and that thou givest him not, and he crying unto the Lord against thee, and it be a sin unto thee." God already had to come against their thoughts. Because notice there would be people who are so attached to their worldly goods, so attached and loving money, loving their possessions, that when someone came for a need and it was the seventh year, they're like, "Well, I I won't even have a chance to get this back." So, they would cut them off. They just sit there and let them suffer. And God said that'd be a sin unto you. But he said, "And if thy brother, a Hebrew man," or so much here, I I can't go through it, but it says, "Or a Hebrew woman be sold unto thee and serve thee six years, then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee. And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go away empty." WE OUGHT TO GIVE AND LOVE. YES SIR. &gt;&gt; This is brother. &gt;&gt; We ought to do good to them. &gt;&gt; When thou sendest THEM OUT FREE FROM THEE, THOU SHALT NOT GO away empty. Thou shalt furn libery out of thy flock, out of thy floor, and out of thy wine press, out of out there wherewith the Lord thy God have bless bless thee, thou shalt give unto him. &gt;&gt; It was all based this sabbatical year. Their release was based on them releasing everyone else. And beforehand, they would have to what? They would have to still love their brother or sister enough to help. When's the last time you helped somebody? When was the last time you went out of your way and sacrificed your time, sacrificed your life to do something for someone and then fulfilled Jesus's words, hoping not to receive again? &gt;&gt; That the Lord would bless you richly. There's a lot here because you see, it's not just a physical thing, but it's spiritual. Notice Jesus brings this down. I'm going try to be quick here. It says, "There For the kingdom of heaven likened. Now he's talking about forgiveness. Seven times 70, right? He says, "Likeen under certain king which would take account of his servants." When he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him which owed him 10,000 talents. But for as much as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold and his wife, his children, and all that he had and payment to be made. Isn't this something? This is right in the word all the way through. THE SERVANT THEREFORE FELL DOWN and worshiped him. Who was the rest? Who is the release? And worship, SAYING, LORD, HAVE patience with me and I will pay thee all. Then the Lord of the that servant was moved with compassion and loosed him and forgave him the debt. HALLELUJAH. HE'S TALKING ABOUT THIS. HOW MANY TIMES CAN YOU FORGIVE SOMEONE? And he brings it down to a financial indictment, &gt;&gt; being bound to bound to them because uh they owe me. They said this to me. I'm mad at them and I'm going to hold them accountable. Sit there and just have attitudes. &gt;&gt; You hold that person in debt to you because they didn't treat you like you thought they should have. &gt;&gt; I gave them love and they had nothing but evil to give me back. It's going to get quiet. It better get quiet because that's how Satan constantly fights us. The biggest obstacle with the presence of God being here and not being here is being in one accord in one place. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit was made to join us. &gt;&gt; It it was made to to give us so much forgiveness to others. Because don't you understand if you hold someone else under that debt that debt will hold you as well. &gt;&gt; So nobody could be released if it went wrong. But look, this king would FORGIVE A MAN THAT OWED HIM everything &gt;&gt; when the law required that he would have to be taken completely into servitude. He loosed him, FORGAVE HIS DEBT. BUT THE SAME SERVANT WENT OUT AND FOUND ONE OF HIS FELLOW SERVANTS WHICH owed him a hundred pence. Oh my. He laid hands on him AND HE TOOK HIM BY THE THROAT SAYING, "PAY ME WHAT? Pay me that thou owest." Oh my. Brother, sister, we owe a great debt to our Lord. &gt;&gt; We owe so much debt to the Lord for what he's done for us. Even though he's loosed us, we should never ever be uh uh uh uh be uh uh to a place that we put someone under the debt that we ought to be under ourselves. &gt;&gt; That's why that's why of course when the word of God it says that he'll only forgive you as you forgive others. &gt;&gt; That's what this is. Watch this. HE TOOK HIM BY THE THROAT. PAY ME THAT THOU OWEST. AND HIS FELLOW servant fell down to his feet, besought him, saying, "Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all." And he would not, but went and cast him into prison till he should pay the debt. Oh my. SO WHEN HIS FELLOW SERVANTS SAW WHAT WAS DONE, THEY WERE very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done. Then his lord after that he had called him said unto him, "Oh, thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt because thou desires me. Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow servant, even as I had pity on thee? WE GOT NO RIGHT FOR A GRUDGE. WE GOT NO RIGHT FOR A HATRED OR AN UNFORGIVENESS TOWARDS ANYBODY, EVEN IF THEY'VE WRONGED US. THINK ABOUT IT. NO WONDER THE BIBLE SAYS IN EPHESIANS 6, IT SAYS WE WRESTLE NOT AGAINST FLESH AND BLOOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT THE INDIVIDUAL. IT'S THE DEMON ON THE INDIVIDUAL. BUT THAT SHOULD NEVER MAKE YOU THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THAT PERSON. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE JUST BOUND AND INDEBTED TO A SPIRIT THAT THEY GIVEN OVER TO. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; That's why they find some of the greatest cases of deliverance are with some of the worst. And it just would be that someone was praying for them, someone was loving them, and someone was going to a place where it would have looked like they were just setting themselves up for defraud. Oh, I want souls. I want the church to be full. Oh, we do. Hallelujah. One of the greatest testimonies I ever heard was was a a a nominal Christian pastor in California and and he took in Anton Levy's daughter, the writer of the Satanic Bible. And they took her in. She was completely demonpossessed, doing all sorts of crazy stuff. He said, he said, "All they did was pray and fast and trusted that God would keep them alive. And then finally one night after I was like six or nine months, six or nine months she had a breakthrough and then according to what it what happened according to the testimony Antony showed up doing out of body is what was it? transcendentalism or whatever it is. And he came out of body and came and said he was going to kill her and he was going to take her and go do those things. And he said they started praying and fasting again, getting very serious about it. And then the next thing they heard, they found out that Anton Levy died. And according to the testimony, he was actually doing the outof body experience to come and do those things when the prayer and the fasting broke it. And he actually died in that out-of- body experience. Brother, sister, what kind of people are we? &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. WHEN THAT MAN CAME IN DEMONPOSSESSED, I JUST WAITED RIGHT THERE AND IT SLIPPED INTO A DIFFERENT GEAR. BROTHER RAM SAID, "THAT'S WHAT WE DO. YOU just slip into a different gear." &gt;&gt; You speak with tongues, you're slipping INTO A DIFFERENT GEAR. YOU HAVE A A WORD OF PROPHECY, A WORD OF WISDOM, A WORD OF KNOWLEDGE. AMEN. INTERPRETATION OF TONGUES, YOU'RE SLIPPING INTO A DIFFERENT GEAR. AMEN. YOU'RE JUST YIELDING to the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; I DIDN'T TELL YOU THAT TO MAKE YOU SCARED. AMEN. BECAUSE THAT SHOWS THAT WITH THIS WORD, ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE. AND SATAN, WHAT? HE CAN DO A thing to the believer. and his lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors that till he should pay all that was due unto him. So likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if ye from your hearts forgive not everyone his brother their trespasses. You see how it's not the natural line. It's the spiritual line. When you won't forgive, it's likened to only a great debt. Now, watch this because when was that sbatical? It was at the end of the seventh year. Isn't that something? If we continue to read, the next thing that comes up working with the sabbatical year is the mark of the beast. Watch this. And thou shalt remember that thou was a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the Lord thy God redeemed thee. Hallelujah. Therefore, I command thee this day, this thing today, and it shall be, if he say unto you, the man THAT WAS IN WHAT? IN DEBT, IN SERVITUDE, in enslavement, a brother, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee, because he loveth thee in thine house, because he is well with thee, then thou shalt take an all, and thrust it through his ear unto the door, and he shall be thy servant forever, and also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise." They took him up. &gt;&gt; Watch this. It shall not seem harden unto thee when thou sendest him away free from thee, for he hath been worth a double-hired servant to thee, and serving thee for six years. And the the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all that thou doest. THEY HAD A CHOICE AT THE END OF THE SEVENTH year &gt;&gt; to take the all because they were happy being NOTICED ENSLAVED to an individual. No wonder you have the white horse rider, the red horse rider, the black horse rider and then the pale. Only the free are going out. Only those who have the release that have moved into a brotherly kindness. No wonder when brother Brandham went beyond the curtain of time, he said he said only divine love will be there. You ain't got nothing against nobody. And if anything, if someone's wronged you, you're praying for them. &gt;&gt; You're trying to do something. God help us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look what our prophet said. Now watch this mark of the beast. Now, but I want to tell you now there come a time that was called uh every seventh year. That was six years on the seventh year. Uh Bible students, ministers, things sitting around here know this to be true. Uh it was called the seventh year was uh called the Jubilee year. Uh everything rested. We know that was the 50th, but that's okay. It says everything rested. There's no crops planted on the seventh year. The land rested. Everything they just glean seed. Everything rested on the seventh year. And on the seventh year, there was a priest that sounded a trumpet. And if a if a man had been a slave, I don't care what his debts was, he was free. Now, watch what the prophet says. Now, that's a type of the gospel trumpet. &gt;&gt; You might have served the devil all these years IN CHAINS WITH DRINKING, SMOKING, GAMBLING, and sin, dirty things, no matter what you've done. BUT WHEN YOU HEAR the gospel trumpet sound, IT'S A SIGN THAT YOU can go free. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN GO. FAITH COMETH BY HEARING, HEARING OF THE THE WORD OF GOD. NOW YOU'VE HEARD THE FULL GOSPEL. YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY BOUND ANY LONGER. &gt;&gt; NOW, IF YOU JUST SAY, "OH, I LISTENED TO IT, BUT I DIDN'T hear it." See? All right. Then it ain't for you. It's for those who hear it. If you can hear it. Amen. BROTHER, SISTER, WE OUGHT TO BE AT A RELEASE POINT RIGHT NOW. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. TO THINK ABOUT. JUST TAKE A SECOND, THINK ABOUT UH UH UM WHO DO YOU HAVE AN ATTITUDE AGAINST SOMEBODY? DID SOMEBODY WRONG YOU AND YOU'RE HOLDING ON TO IT? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. ARE ARE YOU STILL MAD ABOUT A SITUATION OR ABOUT A PERSON OR OR DOES SOMEONE OWE YOU MONEY OR OWE YOU RESPECT OR OWE YOU SOMETHING? WE DON'T HEY, NOBODY OWES US ANYTHING. AMEN. BECAUSE THERE WAS A GOD WHO GAVE US EVERYTHING. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. But look at that. End of the seventh year and then we see the mark of the beast slipping right in. for seal. Now remember with that uh let's go ahead if you will. Uh he says uh with no bad feelings towards any people in any organization. No bad feelings because God has got children in the Catholic system. He's got children oh that's not right. That's not right. Let me cover that. That's right. &gt;&gt; He's got children in the Methodist system. He's got children in the Baptist system. How many of those all them different systems is represented here tonight that come out of it when you've seen light. Let's see your hand. Now remember, there's people out there just like you, but it's the system that kills. &gt;&gt; See, it's the Antichrist spirit that finally gets them to a place till they won't hear no truth. The wait, what was the truth? Remember, the whole word had to be given and they had to release. They had to fully move into brotherly kindness. Hallelujah. Now you remember the other night when I went through the ceiling, if a man heard the Jubilee call, he refused to go free. He was taken to the post and all and all marked his ear. Ear is where you hear AND FAITH COMETH BY HEARING. NOTICE THEY'LL NEVER HAVE FAITH. &gt;&gt; THEN if he hears AND REFUSE TO ACCEPT his freedom, then he has to serve his denominational master the REST OF HIS LIFE. AMEN. OH MY, ISN'T HE WONDERFUL. HALLELUJAH. I'm going to say it. WHETHER IT OFFENDS YOU OR NOT, I DON'T CARE. BUT BROTHER, SISTER, DENOMINATIONALISM has crept in this message. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THERE'S A FAITH THAT GOD IS WANTING FROM YOU ACCORDING TO HIS WORD. NO WONDER IN HEBREWS HE SAID, HE SAID, "WITHOUT FAITH, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO PLEASE GOD." AMEN. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Now, we got to move real quick. Only been an hour. &gt;&gt; You know, I usually hold you two, so I'm doing good pace right now. Jeremiah 34:8. This is actually the only time you see anyone doing this in the Bible that I see outside of Christ. In Jeremiah 34:8, notice what happened. The people actually started looking into the Shimita. And of course, they're they're going to have to what? After that, King Zedekiah has made a covenant with all the people which are at Jerusalem to proclaim liberty unto them. Think about it. They're not under a prophet administration right now. They've moved into a kingdom, a king ministry. Well, what's a king got? Servants. No wonder when Samuel said, he said, "You get a king, he'll make your sons and daughters, his maidervants, mans." So, finally, it looks like finally somebody's going to do this, right? Oh my. Look at this. This is all about how you treat one another. that every man should let his man servant his uh and every man his maid servant being a Hebrew or Hebrews uh go free that none should serve himself of them to wit of a of a Jew his brother. Now when all the princes all the people which had entered into the covenant heard that everyone uh should let his manservant everyone his maid servant go free that none should serve themselves of them anymore then they obeyed and let them go. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; WE'RE LIVING THE WORD OUT. OH, THAT OH, not that word. But there's always a But afterward they turned and caused the servants and the handmmaids whom they had let go free to return and brought them into subjection for servants and the handmmaids. See what it was? SEE HOW MAN LOVES TO CONTROL. &gt;&gt; EVEN WITH GOD'S WORD, THEY'LL LET THEM GO FOR a season, but they always want to control. Watch the political system that moves in this message. It's always a hierarchy. It's always a what? It's always trying to bring things under what? Control. &gt;&gt; So, brother Cam, if it was working right, what would we see? I mean, how do you prove that? Well, what what should it be right now? Should it be that that that pastors control the entire message and and that pastors preach all the big meetings? Wait, wait. I thought a pastor was a shepherd. A pastor supposed to be at home taking care of a sheep. He smells. Let's leave him at home. Smells like sheep. That's for the ministry. I'm not saying that a pastor can never walk out because that's not for me to judge. But I know what the position is. So, you ought to be super ecstatic when God gives you a pastor that loves you like that. He'll stay home with you. Well, how could he? How sweet you all are. Just a just a big bunch of divine love brotherly kindness believers just constantly reaching out, releasing. I release you, brother. I release you, brother. I'LL RELEASE YOU TOO, BIG GUY. You're doing good. You're doing real good. &gt;&gt; Be free. &gt;&gt; You're a great Christian. AMEN. YOU'RE SERVING THE LORD. HALLELUJAH. IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO? OH, YOU LOOK SAD. Let me encourage you. What's got you what's got you in debt today? &gt;&gt; There's a release today. &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't know if YOU KNOW THIS. IT'S THE END OF THE SEVEN CHURCH DAYS. There's a release going on right now. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. THE WHOLE WORD'S BEEN GIVEN. WE'RE UNDERSTANDING IT. IT'S STARTING TO MAKE SENSE. IT'S STARTING TO SHOW US WHO WE ARE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WE'RE ONE. WE'RE DISCERNING THE TWO SPIRITS IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE CHURCH. AMEN. AND WITHSTANDING THE ANTICHRIST SPIRIT, WE ARE ACTUALLY AN INVINCIBLE ARMY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AN ARMY. &gt;&gt; FIGHTERS. &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL COMES AND YOU ARE AN INVINCIBLE FIGHTER. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. But notice the issue. They wouldn't let him go free. They started to adhere to the word, but instead they took the people right back to the slavery. Do you realize this is what caused Babylon to take over? So he brought it right back to the law and he says what? And you were now turned. I got one more place I got to go. It's pretty important. and you were now turned and had done right in my sight in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor. That's how they treated the people. And you had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name. But ye turned and polluted my name and caused every man a servant, every man his handmade, whom you had set at liberty to their pleasure at their pleasure to return and brought them into subjugation subjection, excuse me, to be unto you for servants and for handmmaids. Therefore, thus sayaith the Lord, ye have not hearkened unto me in proclaiming liberty uh everyone to his brother, every man, to his neighbor. Behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, sayeth the Lord, to the sword, to the to the pestilence, and to the famine, and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth. &gt;&gt; So, notice, it wasn't just the land having a rest. &gt;&gt; You had to let everyone go free. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Of course, Gil goes into this and he says, he said, "This law, as it seems, had been long neglected, and servants had been retained in bondage beyond their due time through the oppression and covetousness of their masters, and the neglect of the civil magistrates, who should have took care that such a law was put in execution, and that servants were not oppressed." &gt;&gt; Oh my. That's right. &gt;&gt; You hardly ever see it. Now, my last spot, the word release. So, in Schmidita, it's actually only mentioned uh I believe it's five or six times. Uh all of them are right here except there's one in in Esther when uh the king chooses Esther. But the word release is actually used 18 times in the scripture, but it's actually only used specifically in two places. This is powerful. I hope you can catch this. Hold on. And I know I got you at an hour. Hold on. We We need a Pentecostal moment. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NOT IT'S NOT JUST MY Pentecostal moment, brother, sister. IT'S YOURS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, I got smiles now. Look at that. That's all you had to do. Now, remember, you can literally get in this message and you can find that Satan will, Brother Ram says, Satan will try to make you fall asleep in church. He wants you tired in church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. how he wants you tired when you're praying. &gt;&gt; It's a lie, brother, sister. He's a liar and the father thereof. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But this word release is actually only used outside of the sabbatical year, the once in Esther. It's only used in one other application. Are you ready? Are you ready? Oh, you knew it was going to come to Jesus, didn't you? You knew it was. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. WATCH THIS. JOHN 18:37. OH, WE'RE coming right down to the crucifixion. &gt;&gt; PILATE THEREFORE SAID UNTO HIM, "ART thou a king?" Then Jesus answered, "Thou sayest that I am a king. TO THIS END WAS I BORN, AND FOR THIS CAUSE CAME I INTO THE WORLD, THAT I SHOULD BEAR witness unto the truth. Everyone that is OF THE TRUTH HEARETH MY VOICE. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING THE WORD TODAY? ARE YOU CATCHING THIS? PILOT SAITH TO HIM, "WHAT IS TRUTH?" OH, THIS IS THE GREATEST OPPORTUNITY EVER HAD. THINK ABOUT IT. HE COULD HAVE BEEN RELEASED RIGHT HERE. UH-HUH. &gt;&gt; And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith TO THEM, I FIND NO FAULT, find in HIM NO FAULT AT ALL. &gt;&gt; Watch this. But ye have a custom. What is this? This is Passover. &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT IN THE BIBLE, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? This Jewish custom IS NOT EVEN IN THE BIBLE. What is the custom that I should release unto you one at the Passover? &gt;&gt; THEY SET UP THEIR OWN tradition &gt;&gt; that was not ACCORDING TO THE SABBATICAL YEAR. FOR A RELEASE OF ONE person &gt;&gt; a release &gt;&gt; that I should release unto you one at the Passover. Will ye therefore that I release unto you THE KING OF THE JEWS? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WOULD YOU WANT ME TO SHEAMITA, the king of the Jews? &gt;&gt; THEY HAD THEIR OPPORTUNITY. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; THE VERY GOD WHO GAVE THEM THE LAW. THE VERY GOD WHO WAS THE LAW. THE VERY GOD WHO GAVE THEM THE RELEASE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; They were moved to set up their own custom &gt;&gt; to release someone at the Passover. &gt;&gt; Then cried they all saying, "Not this man, BUT BARABUS." NOW BARABBUS WAS A ROBBER. Instead of releasing Jesus Christ, they released the robber. But don't miss this. John 19, next chapter, they what they're going to crucify him. Now, let's go down to the 10th verse. Says, "Then sayeth Pilot unto him, Speakst thou not unto me? Knowest not thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to RELEASE THEE?" PILOT SAID, "I GOT POWER TO RELEASE YOU." BUT WHAT THE BIBLE SAID THAT IT WAS THE LORD'S RELEASE. Notice what he says. Jesus answered, "Thou couldest have no power at all against me. EXCEPT IT WERE GIVEN THEE FROM ABOVE." THEREFORE HE HE THAT delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin. And from then forth PILATE SOUGHT TO release him. BUT THE JEWS CRIED OUT, SAYING, "IF THOU LET THIS MAN GO, THOU ART NOT CAESAR'S FRIEND. WHOSOEVER maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar." And they crucified him. But what was this? What was really going on here? Let's say it like this. Under the law, they had a release. God gave them a release. As long as they were in the land, as long as they loved him, it was a conditional release. That's why you hardly ever see it. THEY WEREN'T DOING IT RIGHT HERE. THEY WERE CAPTIVES IN THEIR OWN LAND. &gt;&gt; But notice, could Jesus really have been released? You see, he couldn't be released if you were actually to be spiritually released. &gt;&gt; HE HAD TO PAY THE PRICE TO GET you into the land. &gt;&gt; HE HAD TO PAY THE PRICE to get you released. &gt;&gt; That's right. Hallelujah. HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD SET YOU FREE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT, BROTHER. &gt;&gt; HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD PARDON YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO HE HIMSELF, EVEN ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE, THERE'S HARDLY THERE'S NOTHING THERE OUTSIDE OF THESE. YEAH, &gt;&gt; he came and when it was time for them to let him go, remember, no wonder Kaiaphas prophesied that one man would have to die for the nation. HALLELUJAH. PILATE THOUGHT HE HAD POWER TO RELEASE HIM, BUT HE WAS bound by the denomination. &gt;&gt; The Jewish denomination bound him. That's why they were saying, "Whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar." They said, "Crucify him. That's something Rome was bound to a denominational spirit. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THINK ABOUT IT. HE HAD TO WHAT? He had to be destroyed here. &gt;&gt; He had to be made sin so that you could be made the righteousness of God. &gt;&gt; Because the rest was not a natural land. The rest was a spiritual land. Glory. Remember, BROTHER BRANDHAM TOLD THE STORY ABOUT ABOUT THAT SOLDIER WHO ABANDONED everything and in the in the civil war and they went and they they tried to intervene for him and Abraham Lincoln said uh with tears and eyes pulled a piece of paper from his brief and he wrote on THERE, "I ABRAHAM LEAN pardon this man of such uh and shall not die and sign his name to it." And the man gave him God's blessings and returned back to prison and said to HIS FRIEND, "I HAVE YOUR PARDON." He pulled it out UPON A PIECE OF PAPER AND SHOW HIM. AND THE MAN SAID, "DON'T MOCK me here. I'm fixing to die." What? What did he do? He shut his ear. &gt;&gt; HE SHUT HIS EAR TO THE PARDON. &gt;&gt; HE SHUT HIS EAR TO THE RELEASE. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; HERE. I'M FIXING TO DIE AND THEN COME WITH SUCH AS THAT. I DO NOT BELIEVE IT. I just can't believe it. Isn't so any man could sign his name. Abraham Lincoln. He said, "But this is the president's signature." Said, "You are pardoned." And he turned his back and walked away. And the man died under a firing squad. And then here is a release from Abraham Lincoln, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, TO RELEASE this man. And yet they shot him. SO IT WAS TRIED IN THE FEDERAL COURTS. AND HERE was a decision. A PARDON IS NOT A PARDON UNLESS IT BE ACCEPTED as a pardon. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you released? ARE YOU FREE, &gt;&gt; SIR? &gt;&gt; CAN YOU LET IT GO? AMEN. CAN CAN YOU LET IT GO SO MUCH AND YOU SAY, "IT'S AT THE END OF THE SEVENTH YEAR. WE'RE IN the seventh church age. I want to do everything I can to help other people." &gt;&gt; WELL, I MIGHT NOT GET ANYTHING BACK. NO, I'M GOING TO DO IT. AMEN. BECAUSE MY GOD IS WHAT? ABUNDANTLY BLESSED ME IN ALL THINGS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; So this TONIGHT THAT I READ THAT GOD GIVES US ALL THINGS. HE GIVES US A A PARDON. IT'S A PARDON to those who want to accept God's word as pardon. &gt;&gt; BUT IT ONLY JUST US read it. It doesn't mean that you are pardoned. It means that you've got to accept it as your pardon. That God gave his son to die in yourstead. He wasn't released. &gt;&gt; He couldn't be to take your place. RELEASED FROM WHAT? RELEASED. WHAT ARE YOU RELEASED FROM? From guilt. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to say this and I might even go this way tonight. &gt;&gt; Your righteousness is filthy rags. &gt;&gt; We fail all the time. &gt;&gt; All the time, &gt;&gt; right, brother? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right. &gt;&gt; No. No. Not not righteous me. Oh yeah, we do. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; All All I got to do is line up your your Bible time and your prayer time with your cell phone. &gt;&gt; Ding ding match over. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Cam, that's just Bible and message and Oh, I Yeah, sure it is. Sure it is. Okay. Um settings, uh general um screen time. Okay. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We don't want to stay there too long. &gt;&gt; A PARDON FROM GOD is a release from guilt. &gt;&gt; Not the turning AWAY BY A PSYCHOLOGICAL DOCTRINE. Jesus is real. THIS IS NOT PSYCHOLOGICAL. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT JUST TRYING to play something with YOU HERE. A PSYCHOLOGICAL DOCTRINE OF SOME SORT THAT MIGHT IN SOME WAY GIVE you a little feeling that you have done what's right by joining church or taking UP SOME CREED BUT IT'S A release from your GUILT BY THE POWER OF CALVARY &gt;&gt; SOMETHING HAS RELEASED YOU &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO MORE GUILT SAYS I BELIEVE IN ROMANS 5:1 THERE IS THEREFORE NOW NO CONDEMNATION OF THEM THAT ARE IN CHRIST JESUS THAT WALK NOT AFTER THE FLESH BUT AFTER THE SPIRIT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Let's stand. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother, SISTER, WE ARE NOT BOUND BY GUILT. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN A POWERFUL TYPE THAT SHOWS AT THE END OF THE SEVENTH YEAR, THE WORD WOULD BE RELEASED. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND YOU COULD ACCEPT THAT PARDON. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; Think about what that is. There's now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; How far does that go with you? If I have a good day or I had a good day, I feel pretty free today. I'm I'm going to say something to you something to you all right now. Some of the greatest times of growth and experience with Jesus Christ have been when I've been at my worst. I'm not telling you to get worse, &gt;&gt; but I know this. When you start thinking you're doing good, that's usually when worse comes &gt;&gt; because God knows how to chasen his children because the word cannot lie. That's &gt;&gt; right, brother. &gt;&gt; Your righteousness is as filthy rags unto God. &gt;&gt; This is actually a move of grace that God is trying to bring to your revelation. Maybe I'll do that. Because this release God is trying to bring you, this release actually joins you to him. When you have a revelation, this is condemned. The effects of this flesh that work in your mind is condemned. &gt;&gt; It's not the real you. Oh, that sounds like a quote. &gt;&gt; Then how can't you be free? &gt;&gt; You see, most of the issue, brother, sister, is that frankly we're still trying to do it. That's right. &gt;&gt; Because if you're free, how can't you smile? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're free, how can you not rejoice? &gt;&gt; If you're free, especially under Christ's freedom, &gt;&gt; then what should Christ be unto you? Isn't it something when we look at all all the the the founding fathers of of Christendom in in the baptism of the Holy Ghost and how you know many of them struggled so much but yet they were so happy all the time. &gt;&gt; Peter would look at look at the trial the beatings and he say oh for the light affliction. How many times you've been beaten up for Jesus? Anyone's u um stone 40 save one or whip whip excuse me whip 40 save one peril peril in the sea ships going down and stocks and bonds light affliction so if you don't even have that then what what do you got is &gt;&gt; that something &gt;&gt; we have a life of ease understand what I'm saying compared to some of these things. But yet, where's our smiles? Where's our love? Where's our release? &gt;&gt; When God wants to release you. &gt;&gt; That's something. It's not of works that I have done. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Lord said a lot. And I held you good amount about an hour and 15. But what's the purpose of all this? When you come into church today, how did you feel? &gt;&gt; Feel overwhelmed, tired, stressed out, &gt;&gt; say, "God, when's this rapture going to happen? I've been saying it for 20 years. Oh, I got to do it again. Oh, &gt;&gt; do what again? &gt;&gt; This is the greatest place you could be. &gt;&gt; David knew that in such a way. He said, "Better is one day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To see your power and your glory as I've seen in your holy place, in your tabernacle. &gt;&gt; WHY? THERE'S RELEASE HERE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. DO YOU WANT RELEASE? DO YOU NEED MORE? AMEN. DO YOU NEED TO ENTER INTO IT? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THEN THEN WHAT? YOU GO TO THE ONE WHO WAS TAKEN CAPTIVE. &gt;&gt; He couldn't be set free so that you could be And God will woo that in your heart. He'll change the way you feel. He'll change the the mental restrictions that are in your mind saying, "Well, it's got to be this way. It's got to be that way, or it's just not right, and you're not going to be happy." But it'll actually in turn, not getting all in that ear, it'll actually begin to release faith because of the hearing of the word. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. I'M IN THE PROMISED LAND. I'M I'M HERE. THERE'S REST HERE. THERE'S JOY. THERE'S BURDEN. HIS YOKE IS EASY. &gt;&gt; The burden is light. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; What has Christianity become to you? Has it become the hardest challenge of your life to stay in this message, to stay in this word? Or has it become the greatest release? This is the greatest freedom &gt;&gt; that we could ever hear. You mean hearing something like that? Hearing anytime the word comes forth &gt;&gt; because it says faith cometh by hearing. Hearing brother Cam, hearing brother Jesse, &gt;&gt; hearing somebody else, hearing the word. HALLELUJAH. THE RELEASE IS ALREADY UPON YOU. THE RELEASE IS HERE. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. Deliverance is HERE IF YOU WANT IT. AMEN. GO TO THE GIVER OF THAT RELEASE AND HE WILL SET YOU FREE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; We're moving into season, best, sister. &gt;&gt; All right, we're going to pray. How many say Lord give me a greater Lord you said at this end of that seventh year that release would be upon the people. &gt;&gt; The thing is right in the word but they would have to accept it. They'd have to hear it. Brother Ram said some people can't even hear it. They just want to stay in a denominational form of the message or a denominational form of this or that. &gt;&gt; But Lord, I want ears to hear. I want I got a hungry heart. Lord, I I want the whole word. Lord, open the word to me. Amen. Honey, TEACH ME HOW TO LIVE &gt;&gt; BY THIS WORD. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what that means? That this word will feed you better than bread. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Cam, it's 12:30 and I'm hungry. This word could fill you up right now. &gt;&gt; Are you living by that? &gt;&gt; We're going to pray and I want to say, God, make that word like that to me. Show me how to live on that. Show me how to feed off of it. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. SHOW ME HOW TO FEED ON EL SHADAI. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; THE BREAST OF GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; It's all Jesus. The whole thing. &gt;&gt; I love him. I love him. &gt;&gt; Satan tries to play us so much on our spiritual and natural issues. He tries to tell you, "You're bad at this, you're bad at that. You shouldn't think like this or you shouldn't do that. You shouldn't do this." And he gets you all bound up. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'm saying that for a reason. I got closed two minutes ago, but something just keeps on moving me to do this. &gt;&gt; Because this word's supposed to do something. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm still mad about this. I'm still Let it go. It's time, &gt;&gt; Lord. Join me to you. &gt;&gt; Give me a release, Lord, today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, you died on that cross. The blood of God took my place. That's right. &gt;&gt; So, how could the life of that blood not come back on me? &gt;&gt; It has to. It can't fail. No, not one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many want that today? Hallelujah. Lord, I want to be the happiest believer in the world because of your spirit inside of me. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Not intellectualism, not any of this. I want to be free, Lord. Completely released. Let's pray. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God, your hearts, Lord Jesus, we approach you right now, knowing you're in this room, LORD, KNOWING THAT YOU'VE COME TO this people, Lord. And Lord, it was you that drew them here, oh God, all these weeks and years and and ALL THAT YOU'VE TRIED TO ESTABLISH in their hearts. And Lord, YOU'RE BUILDING THEM UP FOR SOMETHING at the end of this seven church age. OH GOD, WE KNOW IT'S NOT SOMETHING WEAK. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S LEODYSIAN. IT'S SOMETHING POWERFUL. LORD, you've seen the hands. You heard those voices. And they want to be free, Lord. They want to be released and release others. They want brotherly kindness. They want to be able to work harder for others, Lord, to try to strengthen them, exhort them, and love them. They want to let go of all the bondage that's on them where Satan fights them, tries to lord over their faith. We only have one Lord of the Sabbath. It's you, Lord. So we give ourselves to you right now, Lord. I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, that Lord, THE LIVING GOD THAT'S IN OUR MIDST WOULD GO TO EVERY HEART, LORD. THEY'LL SEE US WHERE they're at. This is more than an amen. This is a complete change of heart and life. Teach them how to live on that word. teach them how to be released that oh God there's no condemnation that could strike them because they've been freed in you. May it be so in the name of Jesus Christ. MAY THEY WALK OUT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THEY CAME IN. AND MAY THEY REJOICE IN A god who when it came time to say he wanted to be released, he was dumb as a sheep to the shears. Thank you for what you've done, Lord. We love you so much. Bring that freedom upon your children. For the glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. invite our our brother here of God. And I'm no longer a slave to fear. I am a child of God. Anyone need a prayer? Hallelujah. I'm no longer a slave to fear. I am a child of God. You unravel me with a melody surround me with
