[2:16] H let's take our Bibles here tonight by
[2:19] God's grace like I told you I just just
[2:20] like to teach on uh that video I put out
[2:23] yesterday that revelation God gave to
[2:24] Simon it's quite a revelation there then
[2:27] I'm going to give you a list of some of
[2:28] these wonderful Revelations God has
[2:31] revealed to us you know as we've gone
[2:32] along the journey you know serving the
[2:35] lord Jesus these uh now it's 23 years in
[2:38] the message by God's grace so very
[2:40] thankful I'll make a list of those by
[2:42] God's grace but I think we'll open up to
[2:44] let's go to Acts chapter
[2:45] 19 this is a very important uh section
[2:48] of
[2:51] scripture acts 191 to7 but for time sake
[2:55] I do got to watch the time
[2:57] here we just read
[3:00] some of those verses not all Acts
[3:05] 19 good to see brother B let's give
[3:06] brother B round Applause amen stand here
[3:10] bu oh just living okay is everybody else
[3:12] feeling okay or just tired or sick has a
[3:14] fever James okay remember to pray oh
[3:16] sorry about that yeah we've just been
[3:19] going through that so let's pray that
[3:21] it's
[3:21] short go and heals swiftly by the grace
[3:25] of God a lot of suffering in the church
[3:27] but by God's grace we're making it and
[3:30] God's healing our six so we're very
[3:31] thankful for
[3:34] that act chapter 19 I do have the live
[3:37] stream on but it's unlisted so I don't
[3:39] know if anybody texts you and needs a
[3:41] link I don't think anybody needs one but
[3:42] just just in
[3:44] case X9 1 to7 of course we're going to
[3:47] just focus on
[3:49] um the rebaptism element here um in the
[3:54] scripture because that's kind of the
[3:55] revelation God gave to brother Simon
[3:57] brother Simon shared it with brother
[3:59] Austin any any body else did Simon share
[4:00] with anybody else while he was
[4:02] here just just a real wonderful
[4:04] Revelation did anybody watch the video I
[4:06] put out yesterday with this on well good
[4:08] I almost preached it this morning so
[4:11] like I was wondering who watched it who
[4:13] would be bored if I preached it you
[4:14] know hoping nobody would be bor just be
[4:18] like another uh another review by God's
[4:21] grace Acts
[4:23] 19 and let's remember also uh before we
[4:25] get into the word of God we'll pray
[4:26] let's pray for those visitors you know U
[4:29] just interesting situation there um the
[4:32] one couple that came in first he said
[4:34] we'll see you again very soon we're
[4:36] going to come visit you so I don't know
[4:37] if they got a home church I'm just kind
[4:39] of you know interesting I want to watch
[4:42] that you know um and then the other
[4:44] group you know maybe they'll still yet
[4:46] come tonight the brother asked me do we
[4:48] do Sunday school and I said well no one
[4:49] feels led to teach Sunday school so I
[4:51] said I I just teach the little ones up
[4:53] here so he said he'd see us here tonight
[4:56] so we'll see if we get to see them and
[4:58] they moved from Texas to akan and they
[5:01] just got in school last week here in
[5:03] akan they're 12 minutes from the church
[5:05] so they're very close by I said you're
[5:07] closer to the church than I am I said
[5:09] shame on me I got to move
[5:11] closer I
[5:13] like but nice they're so close 12
[5:15] minutes from the
[5:17] church so we'll see what the Lord does
[5:19] you know I was telling brother amen in
[5:21] there you know I said sometimes God
[5:22] wants to add to the group sometimes you
[5:24] got we got to be careful you know said
[5:26] God if if Satan can't disturb our church
[5:29] he'll inject somebody with poison and
[5:30] send them in so I'm just every time I
[5:32] try to tell you that you know we just
[5:33] got to watch and see and I always want
[5:35] to be more excited about the people who
[5:37] stay and be excited about
[5:40] visitors so I love all the saints
[5:43] Hallelujah that come the pillars all of
[5:45] you that come every week I want to
[5:47] remember that I want to be more excited
[5:48] because brother Des MC bride told me
[5:49] that he's coming next week uh and he's
[5:52] one of the most trusted ministers I know
[5:54] he's one of the most Godly ministers in
[5:57] fact when I talked to Mike MOSI last
[5:58] time he said bride fasted the whole week
[6:00] so I don't know if that means every meal
[6:02] or some meals but brother uh Mike said
[6:05] he said uh brother Dennis preach two
[6:07] sermons and those two sermons discern
[6:09] everything going on in the
[6:11] church so I just love I love that when a
[6:14] man or woman is uned to the gifts of God
[6:16] in their lives and then the brothers can
[6:19] we like we can all look around and say
[6:20] this is God's doing you know God did
[6:22] something here so it's another good
[6:24] example of drawing nigh to God God will
[6:26] draw nigh to you amen but anyways I do
[6:28] believe brother is one of the um most
[6:32] scriptural
[6:34] humble Christians I know and I mean that
[6:37] in all sincer like like brother Jim you
[6:39] know all the brothers that we know and
[6:42] love last time he was here I forget he
[6:44] was correcting somebody it wasn't any of
[6:45] you it was a visitor and I was like Wow
[6:48] how's he going to correct this because
[6:49] the person said something way outlandish
[6:50] like and brother Dennis could have
[6:52] rebuked him I can't remember I think
[6:54] we're out there fellowshipping with some
[6:55] visitors or something and brother Dennis
[6:58] I was like how is he going to re Reed I
[7:00] just think I think I actually adjusted
[7:02] my arms like how are you going to
[7:03] correct that one
[7:04] man and he goes and this was his reply
[7:07] he said well let me just show let me
[7:10] just share with you how I see
[7:12] it so instead of rebuking them like
[7:14] saying you're wrong that's a devilish
[7:17] thought that's a serpent seed thought
[7:19] he's just like real humble let me show
[7:21] you how I see things I thought what a
[7:23] humble way to disagree with
[7:25] somebody I like to catch I like to REM I
[7:27] like to remember that by God's grace so
[7:30] uh next time I you know I'm in a nervous
[7:32] situation I like to use
[7:34] that let let me see can I just share
[7:37] with you how I see
[7:38] it I just love the how the Holy Spirit
[7:41] Works in different Brothers like
[7:44] that okay Acts 19 I'm sorry I just like
[7:46] to talk to you and tell you my heart and
[7:49] everything I know and I want to share
[7:50] with
[7:51] you Acts 19 verse2 we'll just start
[7:54] there uh he said to them have you
[7:56] received the Holy Ghost since you
[7:57] believed and they said un him we have
[7:58] not so much much as heard whether there
[8:00] be any Holy Ghost what's interesting is
[8:02] in the previous chapter they were
[8:04] baptized they knew the word of God they
[8:06] knew all the scriptures that spoke of
[8:07] Jesus from Apollos yet they didn't even
[8:09] know there was a holy ghost to receive
[8:11] right so they were believers they were
[8:12] Justified I believe Sanctified because
[8:14] look how quickly they got the Holy Ghost
[8:16] Paul just told them about it baptized
[8:19] them and they laid hands and they got
[8:21] the Holy Ghost so no doubt these people
[8:23] were Justified and Sanctified
[8:25] Believers the Bible said Apollos had a
[8:27] mighty gift to uh interpret the
[8:30] scriptures and preach I'm sorry preach
[8:31] the scriptures not interpret showing the
[8:34] scriptures and then verse three and he
[8:36] said to them unto what then were you
[8:37] baptized and they said un John's
[8:40] baptism and
[8:43] u i no I read verse two okay verse four
[8:46] then said Paul John barely baptized with
[8:48] the baptism of repentance saying to the
[8:49] people that they should believe on him
[8:51] which should come after him that is on
[8:54] Christ Jesus now let's read verse five
[8:55] together ready 1 2 3 when they heard
[8:58] this they are baptized in the name of
[9:01] the Lord Jesus so this text proves water
[9:05] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[9:06] Christ should we do Lord Jesus Christ
[9:08] children or father son Holy Ghost Lord
[9:10] Jesus Christ Hallelujah God bless your
[9:14] your Revelation there but also then in
[9:17] verse six and when they laid their hands
[9:19] I'm sorry laid his hands on upon them
[9:21] the Holy Ghost came on them and they
[9:23] spake with tongues and prophesied so
[9:25] again this is also a text not just for
[9:26] water baptism it's a text for the three
[9:28] works of of Grace other words
[9:30] justification what's
[9:32] next what's after that bapm yes
[9:36] Hallelujah my little Scholars up here
[9:39] let's have a word of prayer let's pray
[9:40] for our visitors and also safe travel
[9:42] and also the sick here father God we

[11:38] God all
[11:41] right so who's going to keep me on the
[11:43] clock Don you going to watch okay all
[11:45] right she raise her hand all
[11:47] right you got
[11:49] it get your Bibles let's go um we will
[11:53] start at Genesis
[11:56] 50 um T might be able to read that want
[11:58] try
[12:02] I forgot to
[12:03] get
[12:09] BGA it's a real simple study again when
[12:12] Simon shared this with Austin and I are
[12:14] just you're so blessed and I think
[12:17] you'll be blessed too here by God's
[12:24] grace
[12:27] okay before I get to this this Le there
[12:30] lesson 31 but I know I've been way over
[12:31] 31 lessons but that's the general chart
[12:34] that I put on the video um so we'll get
[12:36] to that in a little bit so the whole
[12:38] point is to show that you know Joseph's
[12:39] two burials were a foreshadowing of the
[12:42] two new testament
[12:44] baptisms that's the whole study it was a
[12:47] beautiful like I always wondered you
[12:48] know why why why two burials and we knew
[12:52] about you know uh Jesus leading
[12:54] captivity captive and everything we knew
[12:56] about that but here's the missing piece
[12:58] here's the missing kind of like the
[12:59] element why why did John's baptism and
[13:01] then the Lord Jesus Christ why it just
[13:04] it does a wonderful job of filling in
[13:06] those empty spots and Simon said uh he
[13:08] said he was teaching their in Thailand
[13:11] answering a question and the thought
[13:12] came to him and the brother's like wow I
[13:14] never seen that before and Simon's like
[13:15] I've wondered about this for 20 what he
[13:19] he's been the message just as long as I
[13:20] have well he was a few months earlier
[13:22] anyways the last 23 years he said I've
[13:24] wondered about this for 23 years and God
[13:26] finally gave me the answer so let it be
[13:28] encouragement your questions put them on
[13:29] the Shelf let's be willing to wait 10
[13:32] years or how about 23 months could we
[13:33] wait 23 months and then also be able to
[13:36] wait 23 years you know till God gives us
[13:38] uh Revelation and so forth now on the
[13:41] video though I put I'm going to actually
[13:44] exit out that one on the video I started
[13:46] off by showing uh this thought like
[13:49] brother brandom said um brother brand
[13:52] said the Holy Ghost will not give us a
[13:54] different Revelation the Holy Ghost will
[13:55] give us more Bible scriptures about the
[13:57] same revelation he calls it information
[14:00] the Holy Ghost will give us more Bible
[14:02] information about the same Revelation
[14:04] and the example is the birth of Jesus
[14:06] who knows the first prophecy of Jesus in
[14:08] the Bible anybody know the first
[14:10] prophecy in
[14:12] Genesis Genesis 3:15 right the seed of
[14:16] the woman would bruise the seed of the
[14:17] serpent right that's the first prophecy
[14:19] because that's what Jesus did on
[14:20] spiritually on the cross right he
[14:22] destroyed Satan's power to make us uh
[14:24] Servants of sin he destroyed that on the
[14:27] cross okay
[14:29] and then but there was other prophecies
[14:31] about Jesus uh later on Judah we know a
[14:34] governor would come out of Judah
[14:36] remember that verse in that's in Genesis
[14:38] also so we got there we got more
[14:40] information well now the Messiah is
[14:42] going to come out of Judah and then we
[14:44] get some other ones I think Micah said
[14:46] he'd be born in Bethlehem well now we
[14:47] know where he's going to be born and as
[14:49] time went on they got more Revelations
[14:51] Isaiah said he'll be born of a
[14:53] Virgin uh he he'll be called Messiah
[14:55] Prince of Peace Mighty he'll be the
[14:56] Mighty God it'll be God in the human
[14:58] body
[14:59] as time went on they got more and more
[15:01] Revelation uh so that that's what we're
[15:03] seeing even today as we've served God
[15:05] all these years we're seeing God give us
[15:07] more Bible scriptures about the same
[15:10] Revelations like I said I'm going to
[15:11] share a list with you in a moment here
[15:13] this just wonderful list of amazing
[15:16] Revelations and I'm sure I'll probably
[15:18] ask all of you to share some more if
[15:20] I've forgotten some here about God's gra
[15:22] but yeah I will take questions yes
[15:23] nature uh well this is not really
[15:25] related to that's okay preaching but
[15:28] would what name the top what
[15:33] name oh yeah the name of what I'm
[15:35] preaching it's rebaptism uh for shadowed
[15:39] in the Old Testament no I clicked the
[15:41] wrong one sorry here's I got the tile
[15:45] right here rebaptism foreshadowed in the
[15:47] Old Testament the video is called
[15:48] rebaptism foreshadowed or typed in the
[15:51] life of Joseph I had to shorten it you
[15:52] can only have 100 characters on YouTube
[15:54] on the title so it's rebaptism for
[15:57] shadowed in the old
[16:01] Testament okay good question that's the
[16:03] ti give it to your class good
[16:04] question all right so um let me go back
[16:09] to that thought here
[16:12] sorry so that's what I've seen you know
[16:14] as I've served God and you know I've
[16:17] also taken a little criticism for that
[16:18] if if if a preacher preaches a verse
[16:20] that brother Ram didn't use some people
[16:22] get upset about that well that's because
[16:23] they worship brother brah but I've
[16:25] always I've always known the liberty of
[16:27] the holy spirit that as as long as the
[16:29] scripture lines up with what brother
[16:30] random said and it doesn't take anything
[16:32] away then it's this it's just more
[16:33] information about the same
[16:35] Revelation I've always known that I've
[16:37] always believed that and I've always had
[16:38] the Liberty to do that I'm glad for a
[16:40] church that has allowed me to have that
[16:42] Liberty uh because brother R was never
[16:44] saying just PA at me just say what I say
[16:47] he he never said that you know brother
[16:48] ra didn't even preach the whole Bible
[16:50] like there are certain books he never
[16:51] even T talk talked about like habach and
[16:53] some of those other Minor Prophets he
[16:55] never even mentioned the book in all of
[16:57] his sermons well what do you do then you
[16:58] and you you can't preach the Bible you
[17:01] what if there's a scripture in there God
[17:02] wants to anoint to bless somebody with
[17:04] there's some beautiful scriptures in
[17:06] fact the just shall live by faith is in
[17:08] habach that was Martin Luther's verse
[17:10] that Paul wrote about in Romans uh
[17:13] chapter 4 and 5 the just shall live by
[17:14] faith I mean you got to have habach so
[17:18] uh I appreciate a church that loves the
[17:20] Bible and loves Jesus more than anything
[17:22] else right because we can have the
[17:24] balance as long as we follow the
[17:26] leadership of the Holy Spirit yes virie
[17:28] so this topic um this question is kind
[17:30] of
[17:31] up so when we get to have let's say like
[17:35] one of our loved ones aren't there are
[17:36] we going to be
[17:38] sad or what or what because there's no
[17:41] sorrow in
[17:43] heaven right uh that's a great question
[17:47] all I can say is I don't
[17:51] know so this is revelation 7 this is the
[17:54] uh I believe this is the bride brother
[17:56] Ram says in one place it's the foolish
[17:58] virgin in the seven seal he says foolish
[18:00] virgin but there's six other times he
[18:01] says the bride um and this is afterward
[18:04] I believe this is right at the uh marage
[18:06] supper the land because every nation
[18:08] there's they're waving palm branches
[18:10] honey um and the Bible says the lamb
[18:14] which is the midst of the throne shall
[18:15] feed them lead them in living Fountains
[18:17] of waters and God shall wipe away all
[18:19] tears from their eyes so we're in heaven
[18:21] we're in glorified bodies and then Jesus
[18:23] is wiping all of our tears
[18:26] away it's like we're not going to think
[18:28] about it
[18:29] I'm just saying I don't know I said Al I
[18:31] would say it's a possibility we might
[18:33] think about them we might yeah good
[18:36] question you have two claps can we think
[18:37] of anything else um there will come a
[18:40] time though when we will remember sin no
[18:43] more I can find that verse here's
[18:45] another one this is the New Jerusalem
[18:47] the New Jerusalem comes down time ends
[18:51] and the Bible said God shall wipe wipe
[18:53] away so yeah that actually Revelation 7
[18:55] might be at the beginning of the uh
[18:59] future home so I could I could be wrong
[19:01] on that because we see this we see the
[19:04] same language right God shall wipe away
[19:05] all the tears from their eyes we see the
[19:07] same language and there shall be no more
[19:09] death no sorrow No Cry neither shall be
[19:11] any more pain there it is and for the
[19:13] former things are passed away I think
[19:15] there's a verse about remember no more I
[19:18] preached on this I remember
[19:20] specifically uh no more is it no more
[19:26] remembrance new test or
[19:32] old okay so it must be an Old Testament
[19:34] verse the Bible says there uh there come
[19:36] a time when we will remember things no
[19:38] more so the ones that we loved like
[19:42] think about Jacob and Esau Jacob's twin
[19:45] brother is lost his twin brother the one
[19:48] he was best probably best friends with
[19:50] growing up Jacob have I loved Esau have
[19:53] I
[19:54] hated so that's very it's hard for us to
[19:57] understand right honey we also have to
[19:59] understand that God allows them to make
[20:00] their own choices and if they don't want
[20:02] to spend eternity with God then God's
[20:04] not going to force them to do
[20:06] that that that's the choice they made
[20:09] okay but it seem I I personally believe
[20:11] we will remember some of these things
[20:13] and then God will there come a time when
[20:14] Jesus will let us cry it out and then
[20:16] he'll he'll explain why like like we saw
[20:18] today all things work together for good
[20:20] he'll show us how it all work together
[20:21] for good and I know you know people
[20:24] being lost and annihilated that doesn't
[20:26] seem like good but God has to allow for
[20:29] them to have their free their free more
[20:30] agency and their their choices as
[20:33] well okay H does that help a little bit
[20:35] so you have two verses there in
[20:36] Revelation that says Jesus we're already
[20:38] in perfect bodies we already got white
[20:40] robes but he still has to wipe away
[20:42] tears from our eyes okay does that help
[20:46] okay you two classs anybody else have
[20:48] any other verses on
[20:51] that sometimes uh sometimes I can't
[20:54] remember all the
[20:55] verses I feel like Isaiah
[20:59] when it speaks of the
[21:00] Millennium I could be
[21:04] wrong remember there says the Holy
[21:14] Ghost okay so yeah that's a good
[21:18] question maybe it's
[21:27] remember appreciate your patience here
[21:29] there's the
[21:36] back yeah I must have had my verses
[21:38] mixed up but yeah that that's what I
[21:39] think honey I think we'll remember some
[21:40] of those things remember we'll be in a
[21:42] perfect
[21:43] body and we won't sin anymore we won't
[21:46] have any regrets because we we did all
[21:48] we could you all we can do we can't save
[21:50] other people all we can do is save
[21:51] ourselves Paul said save yourselves from
[21:53] this untour generation so that puts free
[21:56] moreal agency on each
[22:00] person I want to give you the scriptures
[22:02] I want to be more diligent with the
[22:03] scriptures this year
[22:06] um no I'm sorry that's Peter yeah Peter
[22:09] said with many other words that he
[22:10] testified and exort saying save
[22:12] yourselves so that's that puts it on the
[22:13] individual God knows what you're going
[22:15] to choose he has four knowledge right
[22:17] predestination election all those things
[22:20] but then when it comes down to it each
[22:22] person has in in this in this time and
[22:24] season in our current time we have the
[22:27] we have to make the choice okay give two
[22:28] class that's a good question I don't
[22:30] mean to go too long on that one but
[22:31] that's a good good question all right
[22:33] and then
[22:35] um and then on the video I put this idea
[22:37] about the message of the hour in the
[22:39] Bible so our trolls you know or uh uh
[22:43] the people that have left the message
[22:44] they attack everything we preach
[22:47] everything the one the one phrase they
[22:49] hate a lot is the message of the hour
[22:51] but I show but I showed on the video
[22:53] there was always a message of the hour
[22:55] there was always more revelation God was
[22:57] giving so if you Liv in the days of Adam
[22:59] and Eve there would be you know blood
[23:00] sacrifice right but when it came to time
[23:02] of Noah you had to receive the message
[23:03] of the hour right you had to receive it
[23:08] then Abraham now you got to be
[23:09] circumcised if you're a man you the
[23:11] Bible said if if you were not in that
[23:13] Covenant Abraham's if you were not
[23:15] circumcised Abraham would kick you out
[23:16] of the tribe I mean you you couldn't
[23:18] have fellowship with God you had to
[23:20] receive the message of the hour uh then
[23:22] 100 I'm sorry 1500 years later came
[23:24] Moses now you have more laws and now you
[23:27] have laws 613 laws um you had to receive
[23:31] the message of the hour after that you
[23:33] know the next change remember the
[23:35] covenants in my book I don't know if you
[23:36] remember that there's eight covenants
[23:38] then the next Covenant was the David
[23:40] Covenant and this is what this was so
[23:41] striking on the video I don't know if
[23:42] you saw it but uh how many know that
[23:44] David preach on David and Zion David
[23:48] established
[23:49] musicians Moses didn't have that but now
[23:53] David said every service we're going to
[23:54] have
[23:55] music we're have dancing hallelujah amen
[23:59] we're going to have singers shouters
[24:01] musicians and they're going to do their
[24:02] course they're going to they would
[24:04] devote a whole week or a whole month
[24:06] some of the priests would be there a
[24:07] whole month and they take a month off
[24:08] you know it was a real wonderful system
[24:11] uh so or yeah David established Solomon
[24:13] took it and ran with it even more
[24:15] because he had a more time of Peace than
[24:18] David did but you had to follow the
[24:20] message of yah like I put on the video
[24:22] some of those people could have stood
[24:23] and said Moses never told us to do
[24:25] instruments well what do you do you got
[24:28] to stay with you got to stay you got to
[24:29] see God is leading David he killed
[24:31] Goliath he's got the anointing he prayes
[24:33] a
[24:34] prophet he's led by the Holy Spirit
[24:37] there was a message of the hour they had
[24:39] to receive now that was a blessing to me
[24:41] another great blessing was in the time
[24:42] of zable God scattered Israel well they
[24:45] start coming back and who remembers they
[24:48] remember that small Temple I showed you
[24:49] they built a very small Temple and the
[24:51] young people like praise God we got a
[24:53] church and the old people are like oh
[24:54] this is so small compared to Solomon's
[24:56] day and the holy Spirit told uh
[24:59] Zechariah and hegi you tell those old
[25:01] people this is the day of small
[25:03] things stop weeping you're crying why
[25:06] you crying at least we got a
[25:08] temple so that's why I love having a
[25:10] small Church it it don't matter it could
[25:12] be a day of small things it's however
[25:15] God's leading in that hour so in that
[25:17] moment in Z's moment you had to receive
[25:19] the message of the hour that it's a day
[25:21] of small things it's not a and it was
[25:24] through the two prophets Zechariah and
[25:26] Hagi prophets with thus say the Lord
[25:28] that's what we got with brother Bron we
[25:29] got we got thus say the Lord and then
[25:32] what about John's day John says now you
[25:33] got to follow me and be baptized and
[25:35] water and I said show me where Moses
[25:37] ever told people to baptize Moses never
[25:40] told them to baptize look it up he said
[25:43] bring animals and you know you know the
[25:45] priest will wash with the labor and you
[25:47] can Waters a separation but there was no
[25:48] baptism in the Old Testament God was
[25:51] doing a new
[25:52] thing right and then once we get John's
[25:54] baptism established then Peter and Paul
[25:56] come around and say no now the Lord
[25:58] Jesus
[25:59] Christ right and then the church age all
[26:02] these Revelations were lost in the
[26:03] especially in the second third and
[26:04] fourth Church ages and then in the fifth
[26:07] Martin Luther gets the just shall live
[26:09] by faith but he has a lot of things that
[26:11] are similar with the Roman Catholic
[26:12] Church still God is bringing the church
[26:14] out so you had to follow Martin Luther
[26:16] you couldn't stay in the Catholic church
[26:18] right and so these people you know they
[26:20] just they just criticize no matter what
[26:22] you say so um again just it's so
[26:25] beautifully seen through the Bible and
[26:27] through uh the the scriptures yeah and
[26:30] brother's quotes here so let's let's get
[26:32] our Bibles ready here uh Victoria you
[26:33] got
[26:35] that so I think I'll get into this
[26:38] now where when do we want to stop about
[26:40] 3:45
[26:42] yeah 40 minutes okay let me set time I
[26:46] said a 30 minute
[26:49] time some people didn't maybe didn't
[26:51] think I could do it some
[26:54] people just kidding maybe maybe a lot of
[26:57] people think I could do I don't
[26:59] know I could do it by God's grace um so
[27:03] Victoria Genesis
[27:05] 50 24 and 25 then virt do you want to
[27:10] get um Exodus 13:19 could you get that
[27:12] on then Caris can you get
[27:15] mark4 uh we already read Acts 19 so
[27:18] you'll get the next one nature you get
[27:21] uh Joshua 2432 okay
[27:26] 2432 I might as well on this
[27:29] one I said Exodus 13:19 see that right
[27:33] there you're right
[27:35] here
[27:37] Victoria y i called Victoria Genevie
[27:42] Caris just like my mom did uh 5024 okay
[27:48] that's the right chapter there's verse
[27:50] 17
[27:52] 19 right there 24 and 25 I might sit
[27:55] right by you
[27:56] here said
[28:00] his and surely surely
[28:20] Vis
[28:26] Jacob
[28:38] [Music]
[28:42] great reading here to class job Victoria
[28:44] I'm so proud of you I want to encourage
[28:46] the younger ones like Eden and Victoria
[28:48] keep reading you're only going to get
[28:49] better right keep reading all the time
[28:51] beautiful scripture you know uh Joseph
[28:53] makes them promise bring my bones out of
[28:55] Egypt you got to bury me now but bring
[28:57] me out and you're going to come out what
[28:59] a prophet right who knows how many years
[29:01] they waited over 400 I think 430 if I'm
[29:04] not somewh some around there there's
[29:06] some different thoughts on those
[29:07] scriptures so he's saying in 430 years
[29:10] carry my bones out of here I'm coming
[29:11] out of here what a promise my goodness
[29:15] that's a real prophet of God um okay so
[29:18] he says he makes him he makes him swear
[29:21] to carry his bones out okay now virtue
[29:23] Exodus
[29:24] 13:19 and Moses took the bones of
[29:33] he straightly straightly swor the
[29:38] children of Israel saying God will
[29:40] surely visit you and you shall carry
[29:44] upon
[29:54] my give it to class great job so 430
[29:58] years later or so Moses actually
[30:00] fulfills that and carries out the
[30:02] prophet's
[30:03] desires so he's Buri that's his first
[30:06] barriel in Egypt okay um yeah right
[30:10] let's go now to n nature we'll come back
[30:12] to you K that's kind of what I want to
[30:14] do I want to show his two burials so
[30:17] Joshua 2432 nature and Bones of J
[30:22] children of Israel brought up and
[30:24] brought up out of of
[30:28] bir
[30:31] in in
[30:34] the of ground Jacob brought sons of
[30:39] H the father of
[30:43] Shem for aund pieces of became the
[30:49] inherit
[30:50] of all right give to Glass great job so
[30:53] 430 years later um Moses takes him out
[30:56] and then I think that to wait yeah 40
[30:58] years after that maybe if I'm not
[31:00] mistaken right because they had to
[31:01] wander 40 years in the desert wow so it
[31:04] might have been 47 years later I could
[31:06] be wrong on that I could be wrong on the
[31:07] math there I'm not for certain about
[31:09] that um but then when Joshua comes in
[31:12] later then he brings the bones in and he
[31:14] puts them in chichim which is a city in
[31:16] manasse FYI if you're you know
[31:18] interested in you know bibl biblical
[31:21] Archaeology is 34 miles north of
[31:24] Jerusalem and two I'm sorry 7 miles
[31:27] southeast of
[31:28] Samaria so it's kind of like North was
[31:32] it North yeah southeast of Sam okay yeah
[31:35] so it's between Samaria and Jerusalem is
[31:37] she so he got buried there okay
[31:40] wonderful let's go back to that
[31:44] here all right so there's his two
[31:46] burials so he was buried in a worldly
[31:48] place right and then he was buried in
[31:50] the promised land that's the important
[31:52] word for the type I'm sorry for the
[31:54] antitype this is the type and then this
[31:55] is the anti-type or the real reality of
[31:57] what this was speaking of the type is
[31:59] the foreshadowing what is it speaking of
[32:01] it's speaking of these events okay so
[32:03] now Caris Mark 1 verse four John did
[32:07] baptize in the wilderness and preached
[32:10] the baptism of repentance for all the
[32:14] missions of all right give two class job
[32:17] so John baptized that uh John baptized
[32:19] that way for repentance to repent their
[32:21] sins and then remit their sins send
[32:23] their sins
[32:24] away um so I see like a Moses worshipper
[32:27] right in that day could have come up to
[32:29] John and said well no the day of
[32:30] atonement takes my sins away you see how
[32:32] that caus a problem Moses said the day
[32:35] of atonement the two scap or the Two
[32:37] Goats one goat who killed and the
[32:39] scapegoat that takes away my sins Moses
[32:41] said that's how my sins are taken away
[32:43] see how that cause a religious problem
[32:44] if someone couldn't recognize the spirit
[32:45] of God what but that's why I love it a
[32:48] real Christian will go up to the person
[32:49] like John the Baptist and say John who
[32:51] are you are you the Messiah what' John
[32:53] say no I'm a voice of the one in the
[32:55] wilderness crying prepare you the way of
[32:57] the Lord hallelujah amen I feel like
[32:59] preaching tonight amen uh better not
[33:01] preach I got to stop pretty short here
[33:04] um that's so beautiful my what what a
[33:06] beautiful thought there brother said
[33:08] there's only one Moses not everybody had
[33:09] to be Moses there's only one Moses right
[33:11] there's only one John the Baptist
[33:12] there's only one Prophet praise God but
[33:15] see God was moving on God was uh moving
[33:17] or brother said turning a corner that's
[33:20] how he likened unto a new ministry or
[33:22] message of an hour okay and Paul repeats
[33:26] that and of course uh the Ephesians the
[33:28] 12 Ephesians uh there in Acts 1918 they
[33:31] were taught of course by Apollos uh that
[33:34] John's baptism was for repentance and
[33:36] remission of sins but they didn't know
[33:37] about receiving the Holy Ghost okay now
[33:40] here's here's the the key word here when
[33:42] Simon CH us with me I was like oh like
[33:44] when he said Promised Land I'm like
[33:46] promise we have the spiritual Promised
[33:49] Land the Holy Ghost baptism in the soul
[33:51] is the promise of the father hey Haven
[33:54] you got your Bible so Haven get Luke 20
[33:58] 449 and then look at the back of
[34:01] Victoria Victoria do you want to get
[34:02] acts 14 virtue acts 233 can you get
[34:07] that then um Caris Matthew 11:29 and
[34:21] acts act 233 got then Matthew 11:29 got
[34:26] it all right perfect okay
[34:29] so Joseph's second burial is liken unto
[34:35] it was a was a type of our burial inside
[34:37] the promise the promise in the name of
[34:40] the Lord Jesus Christ the promise of the
[34:42] Holy Ghost that's our promise praise God
[34:45] in other words we don't have a natural
[34:47] promis land sometimes I wish we did
[34:48] Brother Bank sometimes I wish I had some
[34:50] you know like 100 acres brother you know
[34:52] what's wrong with 100
[34:54] acres sometimes I wish I had some
[34:55] problems but I'll take what I got God's
[34:58] been good to me um but we don't have a
[35:01] natural promised land it's a spiritual
[35:03] land of the baptism of the Holy Ghost so
[35:06] Luke
[35:08] 24:49 you help her with that okay yeah
[35:10] you're really close
[35:12] actually Luke 24 for Luke
[35:18] 2 oh I'm sorry here acts 14 you're right
[35:22] hun good job
[35:25] one
[35:28] I appreciate that okay so you'll be
[35:30] there in just a moment y sorry I forgot
[35:31] I had to do Haven in the row number two
[35:33] all right Haven read uh Luke
[35:36] 2449 and behold I send the promise of my
[35:39] father upon you but you T in the city of
[35:41] Jerusalem until you be endued with the
[35:44] power from on high amen you to class
[35:47] right did you say promise in there did
[35:48] it say promise the promise of my father
[35:50] that's right okay there's promise so
[35:52] again Promised Land Joseph was in the
[35:54] promised land right and so when we get
[35:56] the Holy Ghost when we're seeking the
[35:58] Holy Ghost with the right baptism and
[36:00] the word of God the revelation of this
[36:01] hour We're in the promise we're part of
[36:04] the promise to Abraham right that God
[36:05] would bless all nations through the
[36:06] Messiah through Jesus Christ and that's
[36:08] another scripture let me see uh
[36:10] Galatians 4 let me look that up real
[36:13] quick I just want to fill everybody's
[36:15] hearts and Minds with the word of
[36:21] God yeah promise of the spirit yep so
[36:25] the promise of the Holy Spirit Galatians
[36:26] 3 14 that we might receive the promise
[36:28] of the spirit now to Abraham and a seed
[36:30] were these promises made how many
[36:32] children of the promise we got out there
[36:33] in this in the congregation today I'm
[36:35] living under a promise I'm not I I know
[36:38] go if I make a promise I'll fail I might
[36:39] fail but I know God will always keep his
[36:41] promise and I'm a child of promise I'm
[36:44] living by God's promise every day we got
[36:46] to remind ourselves of that God promised
[36:48] God's going to keep his promise God
[36:50] doesn't fail God doesn't lie God is not
[36:52] a man that he would lie right so we're
[36:54] Children of the promise Hallelujah he
[36:56] would do what he promised so he will
[36:58] fill you with the Holy Ghost right he'll
[37:01] uh for me I want to know other gifts and
[37:02] Ministries in my life I want to be
[37:04] faithful with the gifts he's given me
[37:05] that's why I keep drawing ey to God I
[37:07] don't want to miss God I definitely
[37:09] don't want to get complacent on God like
[37:10] Solomon because I've seen even I've seen
[37:12] a lot of message people as they get
[37:14] older they get complacent on God and I I
[37:16] can feel effects of that because I'm
[37:17] getting older but I don't want that to
[37:19] happen to me I want to keep I want to
[37:21] stir the gift of God up in my life
[37:22] praise God like Peter said stir up the
[37:24] gift of God in your lives don't becomes
[37:27] complacent and stale and church is no
[37:30] more wonder you don't have the Wonder of
[37:32] the Holy Ghost anymore you got to get
[37:34] yourself stirred up
[37:36] Hallelujah that's what I felt like this
[37:37] did for Simon it kind of stirred me up I
[37:39] don't know about you brother but this
[37:40] stirred me up like well I got to go
[37:41] study this out so I went my I new i b a
[37:44] new Bible and I wrote all this out on
[37:45] this the wide margin of my new Bible I
[37:48] put it on the video too so like I just s
[37:50] me up I'm like wow I want to remember
[37:52] this I don't want to forget this it's a
[37:53] beautiful type there okay acts 1:4 this
[37:55] is one one of my favorite scriptures
[37:57] regarding the Holy Ghost because Jesus
[37:59] said it's a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[38:02] okay so virtue or no is it yeah sorry
[38:04] vior sorry acts 1:4
[38:09] please
[38:11] being together with
[38:15] command that they should not depart from
[38:19] Jerusalem but wait for the promise of
[38:23] the Father
[38:25] which
[38:27] he have heard of great give her two
[38:30] claps great job now the next verse was
[38:32] the one I really like if anyone tells
[38:34] you oh there's no such like
[38:35] denominational people say oh there's no
[38:37] such thing as the baptism of the Holy
[38:38] Ghost where do you get that you're all
[38:39] about tongues and I'm like no I'm not
[38:41] all about tongues but I told them I said
[38:43] verse five for John truly baptized with
[38:45] water but ye shall be baptized with the
[38:47] Holy Ghost not many days hence who's the
[38:50] one that created this language of
[38:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost it was Jesus
[38:54] amen and the church said amen red
[38:56] letters these are red letters this is
[38:57] Holy Ghost words God wants my soul
[39:00] baptized God wants my soul immersed with
[39:02] the Holy Ghost Hallelujah God wants each
[39:04] one of your souls like that thank you I
[39:06] appreciate that okay virtue um and then
[39:09] here Peter says this is what we receive
[39:11] we receive the promise of the father so
[39:14] uh acts 233
[39:16] virtue therefore Beginning by the right
[39:20] hand of
[39:22] Cl exed in having re
[39:27] received the of the Father the promise
[39:32] of the Holy
[39:35] Ghost shed for this which ye now seen
[39:42] and give class great there's the seen
[39:45] and heard thing or not thing but the
[39:46] seen seen and heard principle I found in
[39:48] the Bible even in the book of Acts
[39:50] Whenever there was signs wonders and
[39:51] miracles you could see it and hear it
[39:53] brother Bram said wherever Jesus is
[39:55] there was a lot of noise right in other
[39:57] words the Holy Ghost was moving in
[39:58] people's hearts and lives and
[40:00] Supernatural Miracles were done okay but
[40:02] again the promise see that Peter says
[40:04] this is the promise that God promised
[40:07] his people okay and who knows acts 238
[40:10] what name are they baptized in the name
[40:12] of Jesus Jesus Christ right Jesus Christ
[40:15] all right girls great job there okay
[40:17] Matthew 11:29 this shows how the soulb
[40:20] to This Promise was for the soul it was
[40:22] more than just for the Flesh and the
[40:24] mind it was for the soul so Caris go
[40:26] ahead read that
[40:27] take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[40:30] for I am me
[40:32] and and in heart and you shall find rest
[40:36] unto your souls great give it to you
[40:38] class great that's the same rest
[40:40] remember from Hebrews 4 Paul said labor
[40:43] to enter in that rest work to
[40:46] rest seems like oxymora right you need
[40:48] to work in order to rest in other words
[40:51] you got to crucify you got to mortify
[40:53] this flesh right work mortify thish
[40:56] flesh and you'll enter into the rest in
[40:58] your
[40:58] soul Okay now what's funny I'll tell you
[41:01] a funny funny story um this is this is
[41:04] actually a revelation I need to add to
[41:05] my list of Revelations I guess I'm using
[41:07] my my phone up there um but when brother
[41:10] Brooks I was listening at brother
[41:10] Brook's sermon that Zer was tell me
[41:12] about and reminded me about and in the
[41:15] sermon brother Brook says you can get
[41:17] the Holy Ghost in a mother's womb just
[41:18] like John the Baptist did right and I
[41:21] said amen
[41:23] right and John did get it but he didn't
[41:26] get it the soul he got it in the spirit
[41:28] well it just that was it was a reminder
[41:30] to me look how much I've grown since
[41:32] 2007 I'm glad I grew at least a little
[41:34] bit since 2007 hope I grew a lot I
[41:36] believe I grew a lot since 2007 but I
[41:38] used to believe yeah I used to believe
[41:40] you know 2007 I believe you could get
[41:41] the Holy Ghost in your soul like John
[41:44] the Baptist but I read later in John
[41:46] chapter 7 veres 37 38 39 the Holy Ghost
[41:49] was not given until Jesus was what
[41:51] glorified glorified good now that's the
[41:53] word glor he wasn't glorified until
[41:56] resurrected with a new body and then
[41:57] they had to wait 10 days uh sorry wait
[42:00] 40 days and then 10 more days 50 days to
[42:02] Pentecost then the Holy Ghost fell in
[42:04] the souls okay so that's one area where
[42:07] even brother Jesse I was ashamed that I
[42:08] said amen but at at the same time it's
[42:11] the best that I knew but I was still
[42:12] Amen in the word of God I had a pure
[42:15] heart brother bang he knows me he's
[42:17] known me since then I've had a pure
[42:18] heart by God's grace I didn't mean to
[42:21] amen the wrong thing you know but just
[42:23] it's an area where I've grown as well
[42:26] okay and then we know acts 191 to7 of
[42:29] course Paul baptizes them uh you know
[42:32] you've been baptized with John but now
[42:33] you got to be baptized in the name of
[42:35] the Lord Jesus and you shall receive the
[42:37] Holy Ghost okay who who remembers how
[42:39] many people got the Holy Ghost in Acts
[42:41] 19 but remember might have mentioned it
[42:44] earlier this was a big huge Church wink
[42:48] wink I'm just winking big huge church it
[42:51] was BIG full of Faith anybody remember
[42:54] adults 12 people 12 people got the Holy
[42:57] Ghost it's acts 19:7 so they were they
[43:00] weren't big in number but they were big
[43:01] in faith okay so can we have a big
[43:04] church here yeah can God move amongst us
[43:07] here yeah we're we're a prime candidate
[43:09] for the Holy Ghost to move look at this
[43:11] we got a nice small church here God can
[43:13] move right amongst us through the
[43:15] through his holy spirit praise God but
[43:16] we got to be humble like brother said we
[43:18] got to keep the sin out we can't let
[43:19] religion become a a tradition there's
[43:21] nothing wrong with religion when it's
[43:23] pure religion okay there's nothing wrong
[43:25] with religion as long as it's pure
[43:26] religion because we have to bring our
[43:28] body into subjection if we're if we're
[43:31] real Christians should we have bad
[43:32] habits or good habits good we should
[43:34] have good habits we should have pure
[43:36] religion let me look up religion I think
[43:38] religion just means act let me get the
[43:41] actual
[43:45] definition so I can tell you some people
[43:48] say religion is not a good thing
[43:49] religion is just any uh ceremonies any
[43:52] ceremony like coming to church right
[43:53] song service prayer ceremony religious
[43:57] discipline see being disciplined right
[43:59] getting good habits keeping yourself
[44:02] free from the
[44:03] world that's it's like I Die daily it's
[44:06] that same idea Cru crucify the desires
[44:08] of the flesh mortify the Deeds of the
[44:10] flesh that's religion and the Bible said
[44:13] there's a pure form of that that's what
[44:15] we want we want pure religion praise
[44:19] God try not to get caught up in these
[44:21] Buzz words you know Buzz words these
[44:23] churches say uh I don't want a religion
[44:25] I want to Rel relationship well what
[44:26] about James 1: 126 I want religion and a
[44:30] relationship praise God in fact I'll
[44:32] have a better relationship if I got a
[44:34] good religion right right if I have
[44:37] impure religion I won't have a good
[44:38] relationship with the Savior the Lord
[44:40] Jesus but if I have pure religion I'll
[44:43] have a good relationship with Jesus so
[44:45] see how these churches they come up with
[44:46] these slogans and they just they don't
[44:49] go back to the word of God they're just
[44:50] it's just something like the Bible said
[44:52] they're ever learning there it is that's
[44:54] the truth right there I I really feel
[44:56] that from my heart my soul they're ever
[44:59] learning but never able to come to the
[45:00] knowledge of the truth they come up with
[45:03] fancy slogans cliches right like I was
[45:06] telling brother amen you know this U
[45:08] family member went they started a church
[45:09] in Columbus they moved up from Dayton to
[45:11] Columbus and they said we're in the city
[45:13] for the city now I love that
[45:15] saying but it's just become a cliche
[45:17] because now I think I think they support
[45:19] the LGB QT whatever agenda and they were
[45:22] Baptists at one time well now they've
[45:24] slid so far away but but see these
[45:27] cliches they just become a saying they
[45:29] don't really go back to the word of God
[45:31] but it should be that should be our
[45:32] slogan we're inacurate for the souls
[45:34] that AC praise God
[45:37] right so I I I love the word of God and
[45:41] we just got to be careful you know what
[45:42] we accept and believe of course I know
[45:44] you are I'm Just sh sh I over the years
[45:46] I picked these things up and like to
[45:48] point them out to you I think that'll be
[45:49] a help some time you know to you
[45:50] throughout your week and also you know
[45:53] in the years to come by God's grace so
[45:55] we'll go through these and then I want
[45:56] to share that list of of beautiful I I
[45:58] call them awesome Revelations the Lord
[46:00] has showed us over the years all
[46:03] right okay so here's the here's the uh
[46:06] what do they call it the kicker here's
[46:08] the climax of this thought it's such a
[46:11] beautiful thought right how many can see
[46:12] the the type and the anti-type so far
[46:15] promise Joseph had to be buried twice to
[46:17] have the promise so did the Ephesians
[46:20] they had to be buried in water twice to
[46:22] receive the promise well now here's the
[46:24] main thing we want out of this the main
[46:26] thing we want is the reward for being
[46:30] baptized right didn't didn't Jesus say
[46:33] you'll be rewarded he that overcomes
[46:34] will receive rewards yes right it's
[46:38] impossible to please God unless you have
[46:40] faith and God's a rewarder of those that
[46:43] love
[46:44] him Hebrews 11 he's a rewarder of those
[46:48] that diligently seek it there it is
[46:49] that's what I was looking for he's a
[46:51] rewarder he loves to reward his children
[46:54] just like I do who was it Cas did
[46:56] something right for me I Saida what do
[46:58] you need tell me anything you need if
[47:00] I'll buy it for you so I bought a little
[47:02] watch on
[47:03] Amazon then this morning she's you know
[47:05] wrapped around that blanket at our house
[47:07] I said honey you tell me I'll you tell
[47:09] me right now on Amazon I'm dramatizing
[47:12] at me I said tell me on Amazon if you
[47:13] want a robe I'll buy you a robe for the
[47:15] morning you know got to carry that uh
[47:17] that blanket around in the morning like
[47:18] that you tell me I'll reward you all the
[47:20] suppers she's cooked me you know all the
[47:22] all the breakfast she's Cooked our
[47:24] family she deserves a reward and if I if
[47:26] I think that way about my kids what does
[47:28] God think about you I'll tell you it's a
[47:31] million more than that but then
[47:33] sometimes we only learn through
[47:34] suffering so don't take that too far I'm
[47:36] not preaching Prosperity Gospel okay so
[47:40] the reward for J what was the reward for
[47:42] Joseph and I'm running out of time it's
[47:44] already almost 3:30 already my goodness
[47:46] that busy body um I'll just go through
[47:49] these okay the reward for Joseph getting
[47:53] his bones back in the promised land was
[47:55] a bodily
[47:56] Resurrection he was he was likely
[47:59] resurrected I believe with all my heart
[48:00] of course uh with job Abraham and Sarah
[48:06] David um all the Old Testament saints
[48:08] that were buried there new near
[48:11] Jerusalem the Bible said many not not
[48:13] few the Bible said many of the Saints
[48:16] Rose and were seen of many right so any
[48:20] saint that was Old Testament saint that
[48:21] was buried near Jerusalem got the bodily
[48:24] Resurrection praise God
[48:26] but you had to be buried there you had
[48:28] to be in the promise amen G that makes
[48:31] me happy because I'm in the promise of
[48:32] the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah
[48:35] I'm in the promise I'm not I'm not
[48:36] titles father son Holy Ghost I'm Lord
[48:38] Jesus Christ Hallelujah I'm a part of
[48:41] that
[48:42] promise so Matthew 27:52 53 that's where
[48:45] we believe Joseph was resurrected and
[48:47] then he hasc it to Glory right 10 days
[48:51] later I don't know how long yeah they
[48:53] would have yeah they would have had been
[48:53] seen 10 days because they could have go
[48:55] to heaven without Jesus Jesus is the one
[48:57] who said open up the gates of Heaven
[48:58] remember that in Psalm I think it was
[49:00] Psalms uh 19 or 18 or something like
[49:03] that open up ye G he Gates of Heaven let
[49:05] the king of glory come in who is the
[49:07] king of glory the lord strong and mighty
[49:09] in battle amen hallelujah praise God and
[49:12] then job remember job saw job foresaw
[49:14] this he said for I know my redeemer
[49:17] liveth and I'll stand with him on the
[49:19] earth at the last in the last days and
[49:21] the Bible says they were in the last
[49:23] days in the days of Paul right because
[49:24] the last days are last 2,000 years so
[49:27] 2,000 years ago was the resurrection of
[49:29] Jesus that was the that was the
[49:30] beginning of the last days the last
[49:31] 2,000
[49:32] years so job no doubt was there he saw
[49:36] that I will be in a brand new body and
[49:37] in my flesh I'll see God I'll see the
[49:39] Messiah I'll see Jesus right and then
[49:42] Ephesians 4:8 says uh Jesus led
[49:45] captivity captive those that were
[49:47] captive in Abraham's bosom he led them
[49:49] into a new captivity a Heavenly
[49:51] captivity Hallelujah the possession of
[49:54] the king of kings and Lord of Lord Lords
[49:55] the people of the promise amen
[49:57] hallelujah the people of the
[49:59] promise all
[50:02] right um okay so everybody see the
[50:04] reward if if he's Bap if he's reburied
[50:06] in the right place second time he gets a
[50:09] bodily Ascension to
[50:11] Glory Hallelujah and so church if we are
[50:16] uh buried or baptized in the name of the
[50:18] Lord Jesus Christ we also get a
[50:21] resurrection we get the first
[50:23] resurrection now when I left off here
[50:25] was uh Romans
[50:28] 6 Romans 6 says you're buried with him
[50:31] in baptism Romans
[50:35] 6:5 yes so that's why it was such a
[50:37] beautiful Revelation Simon's like Joseph
[50:40] Barry Joseph Barry he's like baptism is
[50:42] burial baptism okay so baptism
[50:45] represents a burial so that's why the
[50:48] the word is perfect there you're buried
[50:50] with him in baptism just like Joseph was
[50:52] buried naturally we're buried
[50:54] spiritually aren't you glad brother Vang
[50:56] the old Vang is gone he's buried
[50:59] Hallelujah the old Jesse the old Austin
[51:01] he's gone and buried Hallelujah never to
[51:03] be seen Again by God's grace buried and
[51:06] then there's also the Colossians verse
[51:09] that says you're
[51:11] buried I'm not
[51:14] mistaken yeah bury with him in
[51:16] baptism okay girls remember that when
[51:19] you got baptized you were buried that
[51:22] old life died remember he condem Jesus
[51:24] condemned all your sin he paid for all
[51:26] your
[51:27] sins and now you're forgiven right now
[51:29] you have a new life and you can serve
[51:31] God in the newness of the spirit all
[51:33] right remember that Hallelujah good good
[51:35] memory all right now I think that's what
[51:38] I left off that chart I kind of left
[51:40] that off that chart I didn't mean to do
[51:42] that okay so let's finish up
[51:45] here well yeah and I'll go to that list
[51:48] real quick it's almost 3:30 here okay so
[51:51] so what is our res what is our
[51:53] Resurrection so Joseph got a
[51:54] resurrection
[51:56] we get a resurrection it's called the
[51:58] first resurrection that's found in
[51:59] Revelation
[52:01] 21-5 right the Bible says all those who
[52:04] overcame the Beast and didn't receive
[52:05] his Mark right all those that that
[52:08] fought against the Beast and either were
[52:10] beheaded against the Beast or they they
[52:12] didn't receive the Beast system the
[52:14] Bible said all them get a first
[52:16] resurrection praise God
[52:19] yesen they had when you mentioned the
[52:21] last days how do we know we're in the
[52:24] last days
[52:26] yeah CU all the scriptures I have a
[52:27] video there's 14 proofs we're in the
[52:29] last days when uh the Bible says when
[52:31] Israel starts Gathering to her Homeland
[52:33] it's the last days it's uh summer draws
[52:37] nigh so what what happens at the end of
[52:39] summer all the fruits are what harvested
[52:42] harvested yeah so when we see Israel
[52:44] coming together like this and they're
[52:45] coming from all around the world uh
[52:48] coming back and they have their own they
[52:50] have their own Nation they have their
[52:51] own flag they've had now since
[52:53] 1948 when we see all that happen they
[52:55] had over 70 years when we see that
[52:57] happening we know summer's nine it's
[53:00] very close then we also see the other
[53:02] conditions uh there's 14 on there I
[53:04] can't remember them all now but remind
[53:07] me we'll watch that video that list all
[53:09] the verses on there 14 Bible verses the
[53:11] end time good question you ever seen
[53:13] class that's a great question now I
[53:14] don't I don't know if brother Works
[53:15] would mind me sharing this but uh in
[53:17] 2012 he also in 2013 he also said the
[53:20] Lord told me this is the
[53:22] last uh this is the last 13
[53:26] in other words he was saying we will not
[53:27] have
[53:28] 2113 so brother Brooks told me that in
[53:30] the name of the Lord so that means the
[53:32] raptures within however many years that
[53:35] is that's quite a statement to make so
[53:39] he was right on the other ones you know
[53:42] oh yeah we had a friend too uh brother
[53:44] Brooks told me numerous message
[53:45] preachers would die in 2012 there was
[53:47] five prominent ones and then somebody
[53:50] come over from
[53:51] overseas I forget who it was we were
[53:53] just talking about it the other day
[53:55] can't remember who was and then they
[53:57] heard about brother Brooks's prophecy
[53:58] and in their country it was some
[54:00] overseas country they had numerous
[54:01] preachers die that year as well so it's
[54:04] quite a
[54:05] statement um so you just got to watch
[54:08] that now none of us will lived to 20
[54:09] 2113 but yes what you mean the last 13
[54:14] like 20 so so 100 years from 2013 yes oh
[54:19] so that's what brother Brooks
[54:21] said that's what he said that's great
[54:25] yeah we're I mean trusting it is I told
[54:27] I don't know if I told the church this
[54:28] too but we were sitting out in our car a
[54:30] couple years ago when brother Brooks
[54:31] well four years ago when brother Brooks
[54:32] was here no it have been six years ago
[54:36] sorry and christien was pregnant with
[54:38] jev we didn't know if it was going to be
[54:39] a boy or a girl yet and brother books is
[54:40] like I almost want to prophesy this is
[54:42] going to be a boy but I feel like he's
[54:45] I'm not I'm not I'm
[54:47] not and then we found out it was a girl
[54:50] right but then he told me later he said
[54:52] I knew the next one was going to be a
[54:54] boy
[54:55] so I mean isn't that interesting like he
[54:57] foretold something and it came to pass
[55:00] and he's interpreted numerous dreams
[55:01] from Simon and different brother cam
[55:03] different ones like that we would call
[55:05] that like a minor prophecy gift you know
[55:07] minor Prophet I don't know what he said
[55:10] lately but I just remember that I'm like
[55:12] brother Brooks almost gave me a thus say
[55:14] Lord I'm going to have a son but he
[55:16] didn't say which one but I had a son
[55:18] another one by God's grace so just
[55:21] really interesting how the Holy Spirit
[55:22] works like
[55:23] that so so we Ascend into Glory because
[55:26] the Bible said we meet him in the air
[55:28] did you know what at some point in the
[55:29] future Girls by God's grace we're going
[55:31] to be able to stop in the middle of the
[55:33] air you're going to be able to stand on
[55:36] air everybody hear that you're going to
[55:39] meet Jesus in the air you're going to be
[55:41] able either float or fly or stand in the
[55:44] air it's not a meeting on the ground
[55:46] it's a meeting in the air and God's own
[55:48] son will be the leading one the meeting
[55:52] in the air uh the there the Bible calls
[55:55] it the first resurrection most church
[55:57] members don't know there's two
[55:58] resurrections there's the first
[56:00] resurrection that's the Rapture of the
[56:01] Gentile Church age and then there's the
[56:03] second Resurrection the white Throne
[56:05] judgment that's in later in the chapter
[56:07] that's verses 12 through 18 I think 12-5
[56:10] 12-8 I just put on the video yesterday
[56:12] and remember I read it this morning if
[56:13] you're baptized in water you are
[56:15] guaranteed to be resurrected with
[56:17] Jesus so see all this fits together if
[56:21] if if if if Joseph could be baptized or
[56:24] buried in the land he got Resurrection
[56:26] if we can be glory we can be buried in
[56:28] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[56:29] will have a resurrection
[56:31] hallelujah it's perfect it's beautiful
[56:34] it shows how we must have our rebaptism
[56:36] if we're just baptized unto repentance
[56:38] and then I put that chord on there
[56:39] brother Ram said I command you in the
[56:41] name of the Jesus Christ be baptized
[56:43] re-baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[56:44] if you've been baptized in titles father
[56:47] Son and Holy
[56:48] Ghost all right now let me see
[56:53] here
[56:56] okay all right can anybody see
[56:58] this yeah that's really small I'm sorry
[57:00] that's really and I this app doesn't let
[57:02] me uh yeah you're going to strain your
[57:04] eyes and I'll pay for your next doctor
[57:06] appointment okay your eye doctor
[57:07] appointment just let me know I'll give
[57:09] you a stiping on that um but these are
[57:12] just some of the major awesome
[57:14] Revelations God has shown us over the
[57:16] years I personally think the four
[57:18] classes of Believers is
[57:20] probably the most powerful Revelation
[57:23] that I've seen
[57:26] because it fits so many the parable the
[57:28] four
[57:29] grounds Paul says there's four types of
[57:32] vessels uh revelation 22 says you're
[57:35] you'll be in one of four conditions I
[57:36] mean that ties the Bible together thus
[57:40] sayith the Lord to me it's so beautiful
[57:43] I you never learn that I mean you'll
[57:45] never learn that out in denominations
[57:47] it's it's unheard of they they don't
[57:49] have like brother said we have prophetic
[57:51] insight and I know I'm getting close to
[57:52] 340 my wife's about getting her arm
[57:55] ready to wave there she warming up her
[57:57] arm there okay so um that to me is
[58:01] probably the most beautiful Bible
[58:03] Revelation because brother he remember
[58:05] he said there wasn't three crosses there
[58:07] he said there was four trees because
[58:09] Judas hung
[58:10] himself so at the same time there wasn't
[58:13] three there was
[58:14] four no denomination is going to catch
[58:16] that you know had your wise virgin Jesus
[58:20] foolish save thief and you got your
[58:22] makeb believer Judas you got your
[58:23] unbeliever the thief on the cross I mean
[58:26] it it's beautiful it's it's so
[58:29] clear um I love it okay now this is the
[58:32] one I put up here this is the new one
[58:33] Simon had uh rebaptism is foreshadowed
[58:37] in the Old Testament everybody's tired
[58:39] of here I'm going to try to finish up I
[58:41] know it's been a long week of sickness
[58:42] so God bless you for and we came early
[58:45] too um I love this from a couple years
[58:48] ago cam showed he preached on the Mount
[58:50] Zion and he just preached it but then as
[58:52] I studied the Lord opened up that's why
[58:54] we have a Mount Zion Showdown and how
[58:57] Jerusalem was uh was uh uh it was in uh
[59:02] you couldn't defeat it what's the word
[59:04] for you can't defeat something what
[59:06] unbeatable yeah it's unbeatable in
[59:08] Invincible that's yeah apparently it was
[59:11] invincible but it was through the
[59:12] Waterway through the secret passage that
[59:14] they defeated that uh the Mount Zion
[59:17] Showdown right and David represented
[59:19] Christ and so what ram calls the Rapture
[59:21] of Mount Zion Showdown how do we get in
[59:23] the rapture we got to do this secret
[59:25] works of God we got to Humble ourselves
[59:27] right we got to do the secret the secret
[59:29] things belong to the Lord and to us that
[59:31] we might do all the words of this
[59:33] law it's
[59:35] beautiful I love it um the Joshua type
[59:40] Manassa one more land but Joshua said
[59:42] you got to possess your own land before
[59:43] you go get other land and that's a
[59:45] perfect type how can a man of God rule
[59:47] the church if he can't rule his own
[59:49] house beautiful type and I got that from
[59:51] a pen or a Calvary preacher online he
[59:54] not even message believer I'm like wow
[59:56] what a revelation now Church don't feel
[59:58] bad because brother got a lot of
[59:59] Revelation from Clarence Lin a Baptist
[1:00:01] preacher somebody tried to Corner me on
[1:00:03] that the other day they said what do you
[1:00:04] mean you can get you can't get
[1:00:05] Revelation from a denominational
[1:00:06] preacher I said didn't brother brandom
[1:00:08] get the uh get some nice thoughts from L
[1:00:10] he's like yeah I stand corrected thank
[1:00:11] you he actually received some correction
[1:00:13] probably praise the Lord um Simon's
[1:00:17] Revelation uh it almost seems like the
[1:00:20] church age book is in Joshua 18 there's
[1:00:23] seven tribes that don't have have any um
[1:00:26] any land yet and so uh they send spies
[1:00:29] out and they bring he said bring back a
[1:00:31] book with with seven uh with seven uh
[1:00:35] portions of
[1:00:36] land right before we can place them
[1:00:39] right before Joshua died and brother
[1:00:41] baham gave us a seven Church AE book
[1:00:43] right before he died so we could place
[1:00:46] the seven Church ages I mean it
[1:00:49] beautiful um this is one I haven't
[1:00:51] preached on too much but remember there
[1:00:52] was partial fear of the Lord I I
[1:00:54] remember Naomi and we were talking about
[1:00:56] that fear of the Lord sermon from almost
[1:00:58] a little over a year ago that really
[1:01:00] blessed me I preach the cams too they
[1:01:01] really there too but I also found
[1:01:03] there's a partial fear of the Lord
[1:01:05] that's kind of like a dangerous fear of
[1:01:07] the Lord where you don't have enough
[1:01:08] fear of the Lord and that was in um 2
[1:01:12] Kings
[1:01:13] 17 these Babylonians that moved in after
[1:01:16] God dispersed Israel lions were killing
[1:01:19] all these Babylonians but then they
[1:01:21] realized if we just have a little bit of
[1:01:22] fear of the Lord the Lions won't kill us
[1:01:24] anymore and that's what the Bible said
[1:01:26] God didn't let the Lions kill them
[1:01:27] anymore because they had a little bit of
[1:01:28] fear of the Lord so that might be like a
[1:01:30] make believer type or a foolish virgin
[1:01:32] type but there's something powerful in
[1:01:34] there just a little bit of the fear of
[1:01:36] the Lord will keep a lot of evil away
[1:01:37] from you so I'm going to study I'm kind
[1:01:40] of put that that one on the Shelf can't
[1:01:42] preach this one the wise virgin Old
[1:01:43] Testament type you remember this this
[1:01:44] was December yeah 2020 that's right
[1:01:47] numbers
[1:01:49] 2633
[1:01:50] zof I can never say his name zof Fahad I
[1:01:54] can never say
[1:01:56] I'm almost out of time he had five
[1:01:59] virgin daughters and remember they were
[1:02:00] the ones that wanted to possess the land
[1:02:02] they had their their dad had no Sons so
[1:02:05] they wanted to possess the land that's a
[1:02:07] good type of the five wise virgins they
[1:02:10] wanted to possess the promises it's a
[1:02:12] beautiful type there I keep using the
[1:02:14] word beautiful tremendous that's my
[1:02:15] favorite word there brother Ram said
[1:02:17] this thus say the Lord Genesis 18 God
[1:02:20] Discerning Sarah's heart behind him he
[1:02:23] said that's thus say the Lord that's the
[1:02:24] last he said that's a type of my
[1:02:26] ministry that's the last sign to Abraham
[1:02:28] sea before the Rapture talk about a type
[1:02:31] that is awesome brother opened up his
[1:02:33] finger he said Lord what am I doing am I
[1:02:35] doing something wrong am I doing
[1:02:36] something wrong on the job show me my
[1:02:37] Ministry he opened up his Bible and
[1:02:39] pointed Genesis
[1:02:41] 24:7 Eliezer brother said that's me I'm
[1:02:44] getting the bride ready for Jesus like
[1:02:47] eler got a bride ready for Isaac these
[1:02:50] beautiful Revelations remember this one
[1:02:52] Joseph's life has all eight steps on the
[1:02:54] Statue of a perfect man all eight it's
[1:02:58] pretty awesome by God's grace
[1:03:00] everybody's ready for me to close right
[1:03:02] sorry I'm kind of zealous for this one
[1:03:04] here um Zeal this is another one amen
[1:03:06] and I were just talking about this one
[1:03:08] look at the power there's a thought in
[1:03:09] here there's a powerful thought about
[1:03:11] Zeal Phineas was given the priesthood
[1:03:14] forever just because he was zealous to
[1:03:16] stop the plague but Saul lost the
[1:03:19] kingdom forever because he was a
[1:03:20] compromiser and didn't have Zeal to obey
[1:03:23] the word of God so one man is given the
[1:03:25] entire Kingdom forever because of his
[1:03:26] Zeal another man loses the kingdom
[1:03:29] forever because of a lack of zeal that's
[1:03:33] why I'm glad when like brother Samuel
[1:03:34] comes in and say you got a lot of energy
[1:03:35] you got a lot of zeal brother Jesse
[1:03:36] that's what I want to have by God's
[1:03:38] grace there's types in the Bible about
[1:03:39] that and I can't lose that I got to
[1:03:41] labor to keep
[1:03:43] that oh yeah Proverbs 8:30 the Loos
[1:03:46] dance before the Lord Jesus was the
[1:03:49] first dancer in the Bible every remember
[1:03:50] that one by God's grace the first person
[1:03:52] dancing was Jesus the L
[1:03:55] before the foundation of the world Jesus
[1:03:57] was dancing judges 14:17 Samson's
[1:04:01] mystery wasn't revealed on the first day
[1:04:03] or the sixth day Samson's Revelation was
[1:04:05] revealed on the seventh day Cam said he
[1:04:07] got that from a preacher
[1:04:09] overseas beautiful type of Revelation
[1:04:11] 10:7 the mystery of God is finished on
[1:04:13] the last day it was made known from the
[1:04:16] husband to the bride right Samson the
[1:04:18] husband he made known the Revelation on
[1:04:20] the seventh day to the bride and then
[1:04:22] Zechariah 101 and then Joel 223 through
[1:04:25] 26 ask of the Lord reain in the time of
[1:04:28] the latter rain so that's that's a
[1:04:29] revelation I think we're going to see
[1:04:31] that if we live to see the rure we'll
[1:04:33] have to pray for the latter rain we'll
[1:04:35] have to be in the channel of praying
[1:04:37] saying God Send the Rain God Send the
[1:04:38] Rain God Send the Rain weren't they
[1:04:40] praying before the Holy Ghost fell on
[1:04:42] the day of Pentecost weren't they
[1:04:44] praying 10 days and then Joel 223
[1:04:47] brother says the fullness of Pentecost
[1:04:49] will be in the bride that's thus sayth
[1:04:51] the Lord all right let's stand to our
[1:04:53] feet God bless bless
[1:04:55] everybody I got uh oh I'm already am I
[1:04:58] passed my time yeah
