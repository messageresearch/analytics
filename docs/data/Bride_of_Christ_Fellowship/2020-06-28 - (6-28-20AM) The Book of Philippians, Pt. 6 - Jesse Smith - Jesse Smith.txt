that we're not lukewarm that we're hot on fire that's right we got a shot that's why we got to do everything we can to get out of any kind of lukewarm mental stance right we got to go on the mental state and get our minds back on the works of God doing something for God staying hot for the holy Spain he's God other than that of course means boiling so we got always have our minds boiling with the things of God you know the scripture is just boiling up in our mind all the time movement by the Holy Spirit well god bless everybody it's good to be in the house of Lord today appreciate all the sacrifices bro Steven thanks for driving that great distance serve god bless you good to see the Saints love everybody today by God's grace how you doing brother bank doing okay buddy good raise a lot Lilly you doing okay this morning tired baby good to see everybody today hallelujah let's go to flip Ian chapter one will just read out those scripture there I do have some quotes acacia after this after we read our scriptures so I like to go over those by God's grace like to look at the book of Philippians part 6 this morning Lord willing tonight we'll look at godliness on the stretch perform and let's cry what I'm feeling led to look at this morning so Philippians chapter 1 I believe it was verse I want to just read it verse 20 so thankful for the Word of God you know God has been extra gracious to us you know we live in a very dangerous time you know evil seducers wax worse and worse because iniquity abounds the love of many shall wax cold it's a very cold age where there's not much love but within the Bride of Christ there's a lot of warmth there's a lot of love please God we should really of all the people we should really love the people here by God's grace and so we got to keep that love strong we gotta keep our our sword sharpened we got to make sure we're not deceived and God loved us so much he gave us the whole Bible which men and women have died for for 2,000 years they've shed their blood for this holy word these Scrolls that have been interpreted translated for us and on top of that he sends us a prophet and gives us 1200 sermons to listen he prays God to show us what is a hot look hot light look like what is a family what does a hot local church look like and God gives us all these sermons to help us line up our lives with that and so this week I've been listening to the church ages again from 1960 with some Myrna Pergamos yesterday I listened to Pergamos just great to hear you know the Holy Spirit moving in the home church you know and how brother Branham dealt with these topics so let's go to Philippians 1 remember his church was just a continuation of the book of Acts we know God's restoring we should see him slowly restoring our lives to the book of Acts but we know his life was a star his life was a bright shining example of Jesus Christ and so that's why we thank God for the tapes we learned so much but we can also learn how our church can be more like Christ Philippians 1 verse 20 I'll read a little bit here I'll just read this and then we'll read our memory verse here verse 20 says according to my earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed but nothing I'm sorry but that with all bonus as always so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death for me to live is Christ and to die is gain but if I live in the flesh this is the fruit of my labor yet what I shall choose I what not for I am in a strait betwixt two having a desire to depart and to be with Christ which is far better nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you and having this confidence I know that I shall abide and continue with all with you all rather for your furtherance and joy of faith that your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ that whether I come and see you or else be absent I may hear of your affairs that you stand fast in one spirit with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel and let's go to our memory verse here 1st Thessalonians 4:13 before 14-minute verse Estonian is 5:14 let's read a 14 to 23 let's begin on three one two three now we exhort you brethren warn them that are unruly comfort the feeble-minded support the weak be patient toward all men see that none render evil for evil unto any men but ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all men rejoice evermore pray without ceasing in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you quench not the spirit despise not prophecized prove all things hold fast that which is good abstain from all appearance of evil and the very God of peace sanctify you wholly and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless under the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ let's have one more word of Prayer you can let's just bow our heads for word of prayer if you have a need on your heart let's make it known unto God today Heavenly Father we love you we're happy to be here we're so thankful for the beautiful weather this wonderful season we're living in Lord God it's also a great spiritual season to be living in where we can be high we can trim our lamps Lord garden where we can be zealous of good works and we can read your word Lord as it's a grand privilege Lord to be in your house today better is one day in the courts of Jesus than a thousand elsewhere so father help us to surrender as we sang Lord God and surrender our thoughts and Lord receive your thoughts meditate upon your word the Lord teach us Lord God these Commandments write these things upon the tables of our hearts more that we can see this restoration of the bride of Jesus Christ coming to pass in our lives we can see our lives transformed God by the renewing of our minds lets us Lord and bless all these saints that have made the sacrifices to be here and I pray you bless them in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless you being see the priests go so we like to just take a few maybe let's take an hour or willing and we'll preach on the this these thoughts here in chapter one and we're really we might even get started on chapter two by the grace of the Lord today and I have two other thoughts I want to get to I'll just see where the Holy Spirit Guides me you know we'll see what the Lord does here as he's guiding us also I want to let everybody know if if you would like a if you would like a copy of the message software I'll just hold it up here like brother amen I don't know if you know in 2010 voice of God recordings put out the software and it's a great tool and it has like I was mentioning on Wednesday it has all brother Rams books that he studied from there's like right 30 or 40 maybe more and you can search them by words and if you have a Windows computer and a work automatically I think I like Mac I just kind of got an apple you know a couple years ago and I just kind of stayed in that ecosystem but if you would like a copy of that voice of God said it's ok with what pastor buys it and the church can't afford it like most of you probably can't afford you know just five hundred dollars this month I mean which of you could which of you have just five hundred dollars laying around spy the software most of you don't I mean you have to have a savings that you know a rainy day savings which of you you know if you don't have five hundred hours laying around and you'd like a free copy of the software you're we can just share the software I want to make sure I offer that it's been a great help to me I have to buy but there may have to buy a crossover software to put on the Mac so I can run this old pc software so it cost me 40 bucks a year but to me that's nothing you know I can have programs books that he studied from it's worth every penny I love doing that so I just want to offer that if you haven't if you would like that software I can give it to anybody just got to bring your computer here I'll just take a few minutes maybe 15 minutes to put on the software but it's been a great help as we as I've been studying history I'm writing this second-to-last chapter on the church ages and it's been a great study through there so I want to look here as we look here in chapter one and like I said I want to get to two other thoughts by God's grace so we're looking at Philippians 1 the 22:26 I'm going to turn my Bible back there to the scripture I will be reading a few scriptures here so you might want to have your Bible handy now verse 20 I'm going to be again just reading the scripture and then making comments here preaching what the Holy Spirit placed upon my heart as I you know studied and prepared verse 20 now we know apologists got done he said he said my imprisonment was for the glory of God now that's contrary to what we would think we would think if somebody got arrested or was in a really awful persecution we would think the gospel would be hindered churches you know that even Diocletian he was the most evil of all Roman Empire do you know he and the other Emperor's that did this ten-year persecution they actually thought they would eradicate the name of Jesus Christ off the face of the earth and they were bragging history says they were bragging oh we we've taken the name of Jesus off the earth look at it now look how foolish they were they were so foolish to think if we kill Christians it's just gonna hinder Christianity in fact the opposite was true I don't know how God does it it's just a miracle but the more you try to destroy Christianity and Israel the bigger they grow even so God has a supernatural power I don't know how he does it but he just he multiplies the more you try to kill it the bigger it grows amen and so you know Diocletian that was in 303 to 313 ad this was you know which was like 2 over 200 years after Paul wrote this letter but Paul is even showing us this truth whenever people try to hinder Christianity or hinder the message it's only going to grow praise God because God needs to take it he said to every nation praise the Lord and Paul said even though I'm arrested he said it further the gospel in other words all those soldiers got to hear about Jesus Christ they all got the whispered say oh that's that fanatic who says he's a Christian they all say Jesus rose from the dead yeah right but if there is any desire or any those soldiers to know about Jesus and know the truth that was their opportunity to hear the message praise God and if they had a desire for God Paul already said God is not far from each one of us because in him we move and him we breathe and in him we have our being just churches you being on your job just you being with amongst your family it gives people a chance that are hungry and thirsting for God it just gives them a chance if they want to know God God's right there praise God you know why because he's right there in you amen so Paul realized even though I'm in prison he said I'm the gospel is being furthered praise God preachers are getting more encouraged amen they're getting more bold that some would despise him of course but he said most of them most of the real believers got stronger because of his persecutions amen in church the more we go through trials the more we go through tribulations or persecutions the stronger we're gonna get I haven't seen my life get weaker I've seen it get stronger praise God like I was saying you know I know I can list all the things they used to struggle with you know movies tobacco dirty movies and sports I don't see my life getting weaker brother bang I don't see my life you know surrendering back to those things in fact I find myself stronger towards those things brother Graham said in Ephesians H he said that was one of the reasons they could know they were backsliding the things they once left they went back to but if we stay o out of the things we once did that shows were still on fire it shows we still have our first love thank you darling I'm so thankful for the grace of God just as happy today as I was when I heard the message amen happy re man because God's Word it continues to unfold it can ten years to give us guidance and strength and protection and and health in this hour amen because you know church you know it's the truth there's gonna be a lot of message searches that take the mark of the beast because if they don't have a real love for Jesus Christ if they're not born again they're gonna take the mark because their money's tied into the system just like ours is the RAM says the Holy Spirit told the bride is going to be forced to stop preaching the word well churches that depend on the money churches that care about the money well they're gonna want to keep their truth doors open so they can keep getting their money but churches that don't care the real bride churches they will carry then take the money or take our church take whatever you want we're not taking we're not taking any association with the government and laws that that take our freedoms away we're going to we're going to keep the freedoms of the Holy Spirit well worship and brother Jesse's garage if we have to amen we worship we ever have to worship because we want to praise God amen so you see it's gonna eventually get to that if the Lord tarries you know if he comes in our life something like that is gonna have to happen and so we must be ready for it now praise God that's why you don't put too much emphasis on money right in buildings and things like that because that's not real what really matters what really matters is a unified Christian Church that you and I all want the same thing we want to see Jesus as a and that's all that matters amen that we are unified that in other words we don't love this world more we love the world to come or future holy we're looking for a marriage supper of the Lamb that is more important than anything we possess here praise God hey man it's so true and while we're waiting we shine the light like I'm thinking about for the Amen in his wife we've been able to go out to see his mother you know in Minnesota there what a great example of how while we're waiting that's your chance to further the gospel and and that neither of them have to preach anything because their lives will preach louder than their words amen now if God opens the door I know they'll testify I know you'll testify if God opens the door and people ask you bang how do you know Jesus is the Messiah I know you open your mouth and you'll testify but many times that's not how it will have to be Paul knew all these soldiers got got to hear the gospel because I'm here praise God they got to hear them to think about the name of Jesus Christ just because I'm here our lives further the gospel later it is our job to further the gospel and our lives will preach louder than anything we could say Paul knew it and he said just we pray for boldness in verse 20 his earnest desire was to be unashamed that's my desire I just want to be unashamed for what I believe and I want to be bold to presently magnify Christ in life or death see I want to make Christ greater with my life I want people to know Christ more through my life or dead so this retired requires a total submission up we looked at this a few month or last month rather than May so magnify means to declare great or to extort elebrate err so we we we make we make Jesus great by our lives or by death now Paul says I either whether I live or die I will make Christ great my life will make Christ's name to be praised amen praise God verse 21 he says for me to live is Christ and to die is gain so living here serving Christ he said is great but dying is gaining Christ so we're living for Christ here or if we die we gain Christ ah let's not feel bad for those who have passed away but they're real believer they've gained Christ they're not just living Christ they've gained him amen they're they've gained it they've arrived the Bible says right now we see glass darkly like this this is how we see you know we don't really know what's out there right but it's kinda like heaven Oh heaven I can see some glimpses of it in there but church women that when we can say this like we've arrived amen we can see it we will see Jesus amen amen and ball says if I live it's Christ but if I die I gained him praise God somehow like I said the last time I preached is somehow they'll come greet us and then maybe he'll go back to work I'm not sure how that works but we know things go a lot faster over there right we've got a speed up to go there because God's outside of time he says if I live in the flesh this in other words writing letters and helping the churches if I live in the flesh this is the fruit of my labor helping the churches yet what I shall choose I what not so see living here meant bringing forth fruit helping the churches and Paul but Paul was undecided about his preference he's like well I'm not quite sure what I really want to do but he tells us a little later in the next few verses he said for I'm gonna straight which means a pressure situation I'm gonna straight between the two choices heaven or state heaven or state having a desire to depart and to be with Christ which is far better than I imagined us this is the guy that went out in the wilderness mother May he went out in the deserts of Arabia and he met the pillar fire no wonder he went he probably wanted to go to heaven he remembers what it was like when they men to be in that room to be in that tent no not it was a tent he was a tech major he had a tent out of the winners and the pillar of fire would come in the tent no wonder he desired it's ok if I go home I'll be in the presence of that pillar of fire ah can you imagine most even I can't I've never seen the pillar of fire but can you imagine seeing it and then talking to it and seeing and talking that pillar of fire made him just like he was so he's so relaxed if I stay here praise God but if I die he's God I gain Jesus Christ the one that met me in Arabia amen the one that talked to me on the road to Damascus I'll gain that voice amen so you can see I've got desires the people really need me here but boy would I like to be with Jesus praise God now here this is why another reason why church which is different for us he had suffered greatly he wrote this letter at 56 years old now he lived from 85-82 64 or 67 ad so he lived to be 62 years old right now as he's riding this he's only 56 now we look at that and that's like that's like middle age right they say uh they say 50 is the new 40 but Paul he's gonna be he's 56 years old and he's he's I said I've already having this battle I'm only fit nah that's all her brother ran was when he died 56 and he's like I really want to go to heaven but I can see the people need me here the church he had suffered in his short ministry more than we've ever suffered remember he wrote now I mean we're gonna read this portion let's read his sufferings again real quick he wrote second Corinthians when he was 51 years old so five years after he lists Augustine he suffers he's like you said I'm just I got pressure I'm not sure it's hard to decide do I want to go home and I want to stay here so when he was 51 he already wrote this he said I'm in Labor's more abundant than everybody else I've been strikes in measure above measure even whipped above measure prison I'm in prison more often than any other preacher in death so in other words I've been the valley of the shadow of death very often of the Jews by times I received forty stripes save one now he wrote this that 51 I mean just think of that already often these face with death prison all the time wit four times three times was he beaten with rods once was i stoned thrice i suffered shipwreck a ninety today i been the deep so imagine that all night in a day you're in the deep is floating on a on a piece of wood how many would like that i get nervous just thinking about it like some you know sharks gonna bite me from below or something like that you know cuz they they say food i know my son and daughters like sharks you know he keeps and he's not even done he says I'm in journeyings often perils of water so waters that look like they're gonna drown him perils of robbers he'd been even nog too many times mud I've never been mugged now my car's been broken into but I've never had I never been at gunpoint well say like that he was often at gunpoint or knifepoint perros of waters robbers perils of my own countrymen Jews in perils by the heathen the heathen would want to kill him in perils in the city in perils in the wilderness in perils in the sea in perils among false brethren in other words everywhere he turned was trouble perils you think your life is gonna be easy when you become a Christian its peril now see that's a different age right that was the lion age we're in the Eagle Age right that was an appeaser nation now in the Laodicean age where it's rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing it's different agents right but still look what he says in weariness and painfulness in watchings often in hunger and thirst there was times he was very hungry there's times he's very thirsty and didn't have access to food and water fastings often in cold and nakedness beside those things that are without that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches so every day there were some church some needing something from him if he's not getting his mug if he's not getting beat if he's not getting stoned then everybody needs something from him all the time so mom and dad don't feel too bad berries god I was counting yesterday how many times does my tutor say daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy and that's cake that's that's nothing compared to what this guy went through and children you can always say my name just say is it understand you know what I'm talking about when people need me sometimes not my children need me which is great but look how much they need it Paul he said every day every day people need something from me remember he was just a humble tentmaker brother bang he didn't have millions of dollars in the bank account he did he was so poor he said send me that one coat right before he died bring that one coat with me that wasn't a rich man so when we think about all that these saints went through church we ought to rejoice you know we ought to be thankful praise God for all the God's done for us we ought to thank God for men and women that have hazard their lives for the gospel of Jesus Christ that he wrote that when he was 51 five years later no doubt we can see why he wanted how many can see why he might want to go home it's hard to be mugged it's hard to have everybody criticize you a name call you he said my countrymen the heathen everybody's against me except the churches but then the churches they always need something from me which they were poor he was a poor age it wasn't the Laodicean age right it was a poor age now look he next in the city looks like as he's riding the Holy Spirit writes this nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you so he's looking at it should I go Lord I want to go to heaven or stay here he said I'm he said I don't need to be interested in my needs I need to be interested in the needs of others so Paul models what a Christian should desire church when you have a desire well should I move here should I get this job should I do this our desire should always be what's best for where what's best for God amen what does God want for my life praise God and when we make decisions here locally what's best for the church what's best for the people of God you know Paul said it wasn't what was best for him it was what's what's more needful for God's people to see when it all comes down to it this is selfless Paul is humbling himself and he putting that he's putting the needs of others above himself I think that's a real godly thing to do don't you put yourself below other people that's humility others needs are more important than mine now verses 25 and 26 I'm gonna read him out of here because I don't have him up on the screen and having this confidence I know that I shall abide and continue with you all so he says now he said I've had this battle but I'm confident God wants me to stay and he did stay he said about five more years I'm sorry that was six more years yeah from 61 to 67 he stayed about six more years so he was confident I think God wants me to stay praise God oh my he wanted to go home and see Jesus he won the game Christ but Christ said you got six more years of labor he said I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith so Paul stank Paul knew his staing on earth he was gonna have more trouble more problems you know just the same old same old right but he knew the Saints would growing joy amen isn't that how you felt wasn't it great to see brother Brooks the other day one day Greg you see by the gamin what does that what does that automatically do it makes you full of joy amen it should at least right if you got the right heart right attitude so it you know along you know on top of the preaching and all the things the Word of God does just be with God's people makes you joyful because you know you're you're one of them you're one of your brothers and sisters your other children of God hey man it's your real family amen the children of God are your real family praise God so see was confident I I'm pretty sure God it's gonna allow me to stay here so you can have more joy so your faith can increase and your joy can increase that's what I say as a pastor if God wants me to stay here so that you guys everybody here gets more joy and faith I'm happy to do that I love this church I love coming this church I love it the whole time I want to be wherever I can be a blessing and be used by God right just like God told Abraham he said you're gonna be a blessing and people are gonna bless you amen that's what we want we want to bless other people and we want God to bless us so true verse 26 that your rejoicing may be more abundant see just Paul being alive who's gonna make them law rejoiceful is that a word I don't think so make them rejoice more may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again Paul knew if he gonna get just get there they'd rejoice they'd be so happy and I'm praying about our next guest ministers after brother Matthew I'm praying about which funds I've been praying about it asking God to show me which one that will bring us rejoicing right that will bring us joy and raise our faith amen I know he'll you know he's always right on time praise God God is always right on time see just Paul coming to see them again would make them reach and increase their faith like when I see brother Brooks preached hard like that I see cam preached hard like that that makes me one live closer to Christ amen right maybe it inspires me it raises my faith that makes me happy to say I'm so thankful these brothers are my brothers hey I'm so thankful to be associated with men of God like this amen because there's a lot of men of God that compromise I don't want to be amongst them I want to be amongst faithful brothers the real children of God now verse 27 I'll read it only now here we're looking this thought only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ now this is a strange word conversation actually means citizenship so he said he said I want to make you happy I want to make you rejoice if I stay he said but one thing just let your conversation let your citizenship become as the gospel of Christ in other words live the gospel may live like a citizen of heaven praise God remember this will give me the last letter he ever wrote as far as history wheat knows or says I don't think he ever got back to it Philip I he never really got to see him this was his last communication with them he said so let me give you my request he said just let your conversation your citizenship become as the gospel of Christ that whether I come to see you or else be absent see he said I might come to you I might not he wasn't Darren thing and he wasn't prophesied or anything got in his shoulder my prophecy that he was going to make it back but he said whether I come or not he said let your conversation become as the gospel of Jesus Christ he said let me hear of your affairs that you stand fast in one spirit with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel so Paul said whether I come or not I want to get word I want to hear how is the church at Philippi doing and I want to get the word there in one Accord there just like it wasn't Pentecost Paul says market say I wasn't there but I know what it would have been like to been there hey man cuz I've been dealing with the Holy Ghost amen I know what it would be like Paul prayed for them in court I'm sorry god I'll pray for them at Ephesus and the Holy Ghost fell that was and there's only 12 people there praise God but Paul knew what it was like to be at Pentecost because it always falls the same way and Paul said keep that same mind keep one Accord amongst the believers keep that feeling like it was on the day of Pentecost where you're so happy happy to rejoice and your faith is strong and you have joy in your heart he said keep that one mind let me hear you report that everybody's in one Accord and notice he didn't say he didn't say let me hear that all hundred people get baptized did he did he say that no he let me hear that a hundred people speak in tongues do you say that no let me hear that you knew a hundred miracles or ten people get raised from the dead did you say that no he just wanted to hear that everybody is in one Accord did I say like this if your one Accord those things happen praise God if we're one Accord these things happen that was verse 27 see he wanted to see unity one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel so yeah conversation is to be a citizen this is the Greek here manage your state to be a citizen behave as a citizen so Paul said let your behavior let your behavior and citizenship be as the gospel of Christ so behave like a real heaven born child right live in this kingdom like you're part of God's kingdom amen now this just reminds me the scripture we're at Paul back in Ephesians 2 he said he said you were dead in your sins but Jesus quickened you used to walk according to the course of the power of the Prince of the air the spirit that works the turn of disobedience whom also we had on conversation and that's the same Greek word citizenship so you have to be able to look at your behavior as a citizen of the world and this should be totally different then your behavior now that you're a part of the kingdom of God so just a simple idea see a spirit leads you a spirit either the unholy spirit or the Holy Spirit and when you're a sinner you follow the leadership of the unholy spirit and you act like a citizen of hell but when you become a believer you act like a citizen of heaven amen that's why we have classes where in America where you have become American citizen now we just went through it right last year she is a citizen now she had to pass the test and was it a long test sister Elissa short test a short desc so they had to make sure you know sister Naomi could answer these questions and they knew she was going to know these certain things about our country certain facts about America and then if she passed the test she became a citizen of our country praise God and they expect her now that she's a citizen they expect her to honor the country and obey all the laws of the country and if you're born again you obey the laws of God amen the heavenly laws of the citizenship of heaven praise God amen she Paul said used to walk according to the course of the scene used to walk court of the Spirit I'm just reviewing this your works reveal your spirit faith works by love so you start with love for God you gotta fall in love with God that gives you faith and then you have to have faith you work if you love sin you have unbelief and you'll do sinful work so I'm just reviewing that because it's helpful it's helpful to remind us the if we're disappointed in our works it's because we got to fall more in love with Jesus we've left our first love and we got a we got to go back to the crops or repent and just fall again in love with Jesus that will strengthen our faith and then faith will go to work now verse 27 he says my only prayer is that you have one conversation let your conversation be come let your citizenship be as the gospel of Christ whether I see or not you're standing fast in one spirit with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel so pause one request is that everybody have the same citizenship and here he says strive together so everybody is laboring that's what the Greek word means to labor at the same time as one another it means laborer strive with me the rest of the Saints for the one faith so everybody has work to do praise God we want everybody doing a job for Jesus Christ amen we don't want anybody taking a break it's not time to take a break this is not in the labor for Jesus amen it's a good thing you're here cuz you're laboring for Christ a he meant he said I even if I don't come I want to hear that you have one conversation one citizenship everybody has one spirit but he's standing pass in one spirit and you're working together for the gospel of Jesus Christ so his big thing was just unity I want to see a church that's unified in the power of the Holy Spirit to live it every single day praise God if you could have one just one request I want to know that the Bride of Christ fellowship is unified they're standing together they're laboring for the things of God for the gospel of Jesus Christ everybody wants the same thing praise God this one Paul's desire a profit desired everybody working together look at verse 28 now here's where often satan starts dividing the church he does it through fear right fear either people be persecuted or from outside the church or Satan will send somebody in the church and to buy the church and then this group is scared to talk to that group and it's fear Paul says it's fear verse 28 and in nothing he said in and nothing be terrified by your adversaries see sometimes your adversaries are in the church sometimes they're outside the church praise God sin others do not become terrified which means frightened in nothing be frightened by your adversaries which is to them an evident token of perdition so in other words there's people that want to frighten you they want to frighten you out of serving God they were too frightened you about money right they want to get you scared about money I want you to get scared about your relationships or your future or scare you about other people in the church you know anyone that comes to frighten you Paul says that is a token that they're headed for perdition amen anybody that's rise to persecute the bride of Jesus Christ they're heading for destruction if they don't repent yeah that's what he says it is an evident token that they're headed to perdition when they persecute the Bride of Christ that's true that's what he says anyone that tries to frighten you divide God's body divide the Church of Jesus Christ he said they're an adversary and it's proof they're headed for him that's what I found through history church that's what brother Branham found - I was listening yesterday he told us how did you choose the seven messengers can you imagine not have forty books and mother I'm reading these books which one do you choose think of that like for the second age you had Iranians you had Tertullian you had origin you had a Novation you had all these men how do you choose which one was the messenger and my man told us it's the one that was most like Paul praise God it was the ones that fought against the Antichrist spirit it was the ones that were dying that were giving their lives for the gospel praise God it was one that were speaking out against false doctrine it was the ones that were trying to unify and keep together the saint they were giving their lives for the Saints living neither humble lives those are the lives a man that wrote and said that's the real child of God but the ones that we're trying to scare the true believer those were the children of hell Jesus calls them the synagogue of Satan it's proof of their destruction when people try to frighten you when it's proof of your salvation then those are try to discourage you from serving God those are try to divide the church those that try to frustrate you it's very the very proof that you're being attacked is proof that you're a child of God that God set my timer here so let me said it real quick so thank you lord now how many believe this is Holy Bible I believe this is the Word of God course you do and you know Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever right Paul said the same thing in Galatians the children of the bondwoman will always persecute the children of the free sorry see and we're not persecuting anybody like that we're calling out sin or giving warnings but we're not the ones being the persecutors we're being persecuted praise God usually from your families usually right or people that will turn in the church turn on you yeah because that was Satan and Paul says it right there whoever's trying to frighten you and scare you that's the devil so the next time you get scared I hope the Holy Spirit will bring that back to your memories that's the devil so Paul said stand together as one army working hard for the Lord do labor and strive together and if anybody tries to frighten you he said stand against that and keep laboring and he said let it be a token he said let the persecutor be a token that they're going to Perdition and let you the ones who United let it be a token that you are the saved of God I tell you it helps to reduce the books nice and slow doesn't it we might have just read over that looking I'm gonna write right over looking for my favorite scripture right but if you go slow Church as we go slowly through these things you can see how we're just like that early church how come we don't have more people here it's because we've reached such a true doctor and praise God Paul said there will be a great falling away of the churches perilous troubling times you go praise God but Paul said what you've heard of me what you've seen of me what you've learned of me keep that unto the day of redemption praise God and that's what we're doing we're keeping what Paul said and I'm always open to any correction if I'm not doing something Paul said then God helped me to do it by God's grace come show me where I'm not doing I want to do better you do too right this is the gospel this is this is the this is the blueprint brother ran cousin this is the blueprint this is how God builds his Holy Ghost filled church his one desire just be United just labor together everybody think about the same things that's we're gonna get to it I think in a few moments here verse 29 for unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ now here we get they're getting a little bit of a balance here here you get a little bit of a bitterness there's a little bitterness for your belly right the Word of God tastes honey in your mouth but bailar bitter in your belly here's where Paul starts to bring it in no listen he says you're gonna have a lot of people trying to scare you the devil is gonna try to frighten you with Cova 19 they're losing your job or the economy tanking does that happen that happened in 2008 but remember with the house system went down or the real stakes I was nervous I was gonna lose my job they started laying off people frighten us he say don't allow all these things to frighten us Lisa don't he said don't be terrified by that be united in Christ for into you it's giving the behalf of Christ not only to believe on him but also to suffer for his sake so now Paul says see you have to have these people terrifying you we don't like it but we have to have people try to frighten you he said because not only do you have to believe on him you have to suffer for him yeah remember he said if you want to reign with him you have to suffer with him because power without character is satanic you you would not be fit to rule in the Millenium member if you're faithful with vibez five times for the man you'll make you rule over ten cities you and I would not be able to rule over ten cities unless we suffer here we wouldn't be one to be fit we wouldn't know how to do it in other words our trials now in these little tests teach us to rely upon the Word of God so that when the millennium comes no matter what the heathen nations do we'll rely more on the Word of God will we have a perfect a perfect application of the laws of God because we learn to keep the laws of God on this side praise God so see it's your adversities are given you for Christ's purpose see Christ has a place for you in the Millennial I know it's hard to believe Church it is for me sometimes too like that we use a little person like me and maybe rule over city yes because you can rule over sin now when it is just let's lay there in front of you like Joseph that with Popular's liven the temptations are just right there they're right there on your phone you know you can you can every temptation is right at your fingertips yet you deny it because you are the please God because your father is in heaven and you wouldn't even become because you're not a part of this kingdom really you're a part of heavens Kingdom that's Christ's purpose to believe on so we want you to believe in the midst of your trial and suffer in the midst of the trial verse 30 having the same conflict which you saw on me so Paul says you have the same conflict you have in me in other words the same thing Paul is battling the Lord I really like to go home I really would like to go to heaven now I want to get rid of this persecution I don't like living in this world Paul said you have the same trials you have the same conflict you rather go see Jesus so you'd have to suffer here for us it's like suffer through the temptations because nobody's been tempted like this day this is the greatest day of temptation and deception there ever has been right iniquity is abounding like it's never a bounded before it's like the days of Noah and not only is like the days of Noah it's like the base of lot I mean it's double at least double as far as temptations and tests and trials and mindmatters and demon powers trying to deceive and being the scene but Paul says you have the same conflict which you saw in me and now he to be in nice and now you need to hear see they'd heard about it from other people but now Paul says himself people had told that he know Paul really wants to go home he's 56 years old Paul really would like to go to heaven and they heard about it I wonder what the Prophet way no wonder why wouldn't want to stay and help us out we're now pausing with Paul tells him with his own words yes I like to go to heaven but it's more important that I stay here to increase your face oh yeah now let me get to this thought and then I'll I think I'll share these two thoughts well you know what yeah I guess we'll go okay now you're striving together okay some of my slides are sorry when the Bible said strive together it means actually you're fighting in a game fighting in a contest so it's kind of like football or baseball it's like we are on the same team and we're we're in a game we're in a contest and Paul says you have to all strive together to win the game Church have you ever seen a team sport where one person won the whole game for everybody have you ever seen that I never had I think about basketball then one person win that game know you've got to have all five people write soccer and I don't like soccer very much but I know a lot most the world does but you can't win soccer with just one player you've got to have everybody doing their part and they can't be distracted they got to be focused on the goal praise God that's what Paul Paul is using these sports analogies of these these military analogies to get them to see everybody plays a huge part in this game it's a great contest everybody's do everybody's part is so important and you got to be focused on being unified in one Accord for the game now there can't be any distractions Church we have to completely focus on get on the task at hand now I'm going to exports phonetics I'll just tell us a few just a little story you know some of the greatest sports heroes are ones that have had horrible situations half of their lives like their mom dad or mom southern mom dies their dad died and yet they'll go to the game the next day brother bang and had this great game and and and the sports writers will will honor them because they were able them to deal with the frustration and put the distractions away in and have a great game like that even matters right but see that's what a Christian is supposed to do praise God we're supposed to forget about any struggle any suffering and we're supposed to keep laboring and focusing on the gospel spreading the gospel furthering the gospel and Paul says that's what I want to hear about the one thing I want to hear about is that the church is focused on the game praise God on the contest amen but keep their mind on furthering the gospel above any I got something to tell you buddy this week a pastor called me up and he said we have a lot of extra money and he said what how much money could I give you brother Jesse I said I said let me pray about it because banging on I told him I said banging I were just talking about needing money to translate my book or go overseas remember we were talking about that last Sunday brother to preach to his people and it was just it was just something we were just basically talking just kind of generally talking about but I was I've always hoped been and Beggs always told me we've always talked we voice had that desire to go preach the gospel to his people and we've you know we've said in passing over the years Bay I kind of joke what time's a bang you could be my translator you know but you know I wouldn't have to be preaching just giving out the gospel like I said praying for people having a prayer meeting like Paul just have a prayer meeting you know my one that you know what brother said I've got I'll just say it $20,000 and they said they said we want to find that he said where he's looking at different churches but they were to find people that want to take the gospel and do something with the gospel you know I told I said the first thing that came to my mind is whether man said it by the hundred million dollars you know brother Graham would do he said I'd go around the country and set up meetings to preach to the Americans to get them ready for the rapture won't grogram do he told trip services so I said brother I said that was my first stop take the gospel somewhere I said let's pray fast let's have a outreach service in Cleveland or something I don't know I'll read service downtown Akron I don't know he said pray bite and that's the main thing church is praying about it remember the Holy Spirit told Paul don't go to Asia in Acts in acts 4 14 x-14 though is a 6-minute 16 I might be wrong boy let's see back in other words Bank and I have good ideas and we have hopes and dreams maybe someday when it's got to be led by the Holy Spirit that's why I went to eyes that's why I said I'm gonna take any money time pray about it but brother and I told the brother then I just talked to you and he said oh that looks like the timing of God so just so you know it's something we need to pray about maybe after service as we close in a little bit let's pray about that they got $20,000 that he said we got to churches so maybe 10,000 that church 10,000 us what would you do if somebody handed you $10,000 and they said do it for Jesus kind well also I would do try to preach the gospel I mean it's the foolishness of preaching to say then that would believe they always is that way preaching somebody that we have to get people here to here preaching Amen take the Breezy to them amen so I just thought I'd share that because that was very timely yeah it was the Monday so we talked Sunday I got a call Monday just and this person never calls me I'll tell you after church but I notice on livestream now I want to get people I'll go get money Jesse now yeah you'd be surprised how many emails I got a week I got to this week asking me for money I'm like oh man I don't even know these people I can't send money to other people unless I know who they are I just have to have that unless I feel definitely led of the Holy Spirit so it's something we need to pray about if somebody wanted to give you money what would you do well I try to preach the gospel so see we have all these distractions in life but we have to be able to set those aside and stay focused on the game the Christian contests praise God we have to work together everybody has to do their part in the gospel let me close with these uh let's just read verses 1 & 2 now I have notes on these first few verses let's just read let's go to get your Bibles here Philippians 2 1 2 this is a great thought here and church the more I study this book the more I see Paul's main thoughts for the believers and he knew they were gonna die he knew they were going to persecute it Paul knew he was gonna die what is his main subject its unity of the mind you and I got three parts we hate the flesh right the souls the back the seal of God the nature of God but we live most of time in the mind Paul's main idea through every letter is just everybody think the same way he wants us to be brainwashed it's true it's true the whole point of Paul's letters many times no with at least with Philippians was to get them to think the same thing now prove it to you look at verses 1 and 2 in chapter 2 if there be any consolation in Christ is their consolation in Christ yes if any comfort of love is their comfort of love Christ yes if any fellowship of the spirit is there fellowship with the holy spirit in Christ yes if any bowels and mercies is their bowels and mercies in Christ yes remember these were in chapters before or numbers that was in the 1300s they finally put the Bible with numbers in chapters I was only 700 years ago so memories finishing the previous chapter you have to believe in Christ suffer you have the same conflict whether go to heaven or stay here and now he says if you have any of these blessings of Christ verse to fulfill ye my joy in other words bring joy to my heart you know you're gonna die you're gonna suffer but he said bring joy to my heart by what Paul that you be like-minded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind to see Paul asked are these five things in Christ and you would say yes all of these things are in Christ so pause asking in this F thing if to kind of make a point here of course all these things are in Christ well Paul saying if these are so obvious that they're in Christ then make my heart happy bring me real Christian joy by being in one Accord what is consolation it's encouragement is there refreshment in Christ I love coming to vastly God I feel so refreshed amen I'd be like hopping around and jumping around just steering brain then sing and the Malachi Lydia everybody praising God it refreshes you Paul says is there any consolation of course is there comfort of love no love of course it's a gopping which means goodwill is there benevolence you comforted by everyone's goodwill in Christ yes do you get fellowship or joint participation or that brother won't talk to me that sister won't talk to me no there's participation in Christ there's fellowship in Christ is their bowels which means it means like your liver and your heart and your most inner part intestines and your your large and small it means like your very deepest inward parts which means your most intense feeling do you get the best feelings of your life in Christ yes yes it's the best feeling you have all week is to be in the house of God hey and rejoice with Jesus Christ is there mercies in Christ yes you know Christ pities you Christ is gentle with you he longs for you thank God I'm glad somebody pities neighbors God babe I'm weak and I get discouraged sometimes too easily I'm glad there there's mercies in Christ Jesus if there's all these things in Christ then he says fill to the top of my joy fill my joy tip off top off my joy in other words make my joy run over because there's so much love in Jesus there's so much mercy in Jesus he said overflow my joy and be united with the same mind I wonder what mindset do you have coming to church that's what we need to fix it's actually someone need to fix up a day which reminds that when you get up in the morning mine wasn't very good this morning my body's tired I think it was exercising a little too hard yesterday you know played some basketballs now a guy hey I didn't wake up feeling real good just to say the least but see he says what what do our minds focus on throughout the day we often every day we need to think about the same things Christ the gospel furthering the gospel sharing the message with other people worshiping God amen if there's any love if there's anything good in Christ make the Prophet happy by hearing his message that's right praise God make the Prophet happy to know that his preaching has impact in people's lives because Jesus's love is so great because his mercy is so great make the Prophet joyful by obeying what he said now look at this church 10 times you can look it up we'll go over it maybe tonight maybe we will just switch over and back to this here for tonight 10 times Paul says Inc the same think on good things I merchants mr. Hanley's member think on these things be like minded being one Accord I may never see you again but just stay unified and don't let the devil frighten you don't don't let the devil be discouraged don't let him divide you but stay united in the one contest the one game of furthering the gospel of Jesus Christ don't let anything divide Judy says ten times he focuses on the mind and no doubt because he's writing from prison if anybody was allowed if you would have mercy on anybody to have a mighty battle it'd be somebody in prison because they could get beaten starved ravished right if anybody could have mercy that we'd say well it's okay they went crazy because they were in jail because it's like lawlessness if anybody deserved could art could we can understand how they would have mine vandals would be someone in prison but Paul is imprisoned he says I'm rejoicing I see the Gospels being further he said let me hear let my cup run over by hearing that everybody's in one Accord everybody's got the same thoughts quite a thing isn't it quite a thing George I'm taking it by your quietness that you're thinking about that not saying a matter because you're thinking about my thoughts irony God to help me with my thoughts over and over Paul says same mind same Accord think on these things where's he dealing with which realm is he dealing with the flesh the soul my remember Church the mind is just I'm sorry the mind and words the outflow what's in your soul you know we can always tell many times many times you and I can tell what's on each other's minds by what comes out of our mouth right jesus said a good man brings forth good treasure out of his heart evil man brings out evil treasure for of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks you know we could talk all day about different things but the main thing we should talk about is our maybe loving our children how we can let our children how we can love our husbands and wives how we can further the gospel of Jesus Christ how would you do some mission work how we can make our music ministry better how we can make our preaching ministry better right it should all focus on how do we better serve God how can we further the gospel that God has shown us he thought Paul thought so much of it he gave us 10 scriptures on it in this one letter I have to say think about the same things don't think about other things that aren't gonna further the gospel think about the gospel of Jesus Christ now as we're closed in here I would just want to just share a couple things here maybe I'll save the other one for tonight I think I'll share this one for the morning yeah and I'll share the other one the first one I want to share is about how sin came in the early church the second one is just my experiences with cultural integration because we're have all this racial stuff going on in America now just a small group it's not most most people are most people are simple sane people in America there's just a small crazy group that they are actually insane and devil possessed it's not millions and millions the remember there's 325 million people in America most people are insane or I'm sorry most people are saying rather and they're not crazy like a lot of these youngsters you're bringing down the monuments and all kinds of things killing people killing shooting cops I think I'll save that one for tonight but for this morning since we're coming in to July 4th weekend I know you got some good plans something good traveling plan that's wonderful we wish we could travel too and we love when we have traveled but I just saw a connection with July 4th who is our biggest enemy Rome Rome Levin says don't fear communism Romanism yeah why because it's disguised Christianity it's an iniquity filled form of Christianity but sponsorship and Satan knows we'll never go over and you know sleep at the bar and become drug dealers say no they never do that but he tried to tempt us into a religious experience that's actually iniquity filled right workers of iniquity but I was looking at the early church and I'll just take just give me three minutes here there was churches in Rome member Paul wrote a letter to Rome Booker Romans Christian authors say it's the most powerful book on theology ever and I agree I agree he goes through sin and then Grace and justification baptism Holy Ghost in Chapter eight he's had and then he's renew your mind in Chapter 12 and then the mystery of Israel at the end I mean this is powerful Gentile dispensation he basically covers the whole span of history in one book many ways Christians were banned by the bang in AD 41 number the Holy Ghost fell in a t-33 or 30 so about 11 or 13 years late Christian's get banned out of Rome well some of the pretenders Saints hung around the church the real believers were banned for 13 years a brother band even says it its history I got just bought a new book on it real Christians were banned out of Rome in AD 41 you know what the first thing they heard about you know what they first stumbled on holidays so we're coming up to 4th of July so I just thought I'd share with you now the ones that might get us will be Christmas and Easter or actually Thanksgiving too because people watch football all day and overeat they'll get in the flesh and though they'll just do evil things but the first thing when the saints came back by the bank the first thing they saw according to history was that instead of celebrating Easter like the Lord's Supper they started participating they would go out and join the feast of Ishtar because the church leaders allowed them to go out and celebrate the holidays with the wicked and they didn't participate in everything just a few things when Polycarp came there about about forty years after after the saints came back the first church of rome when the saints came back they could enjoy so they had to start in the second Church of Rome because the First Church of Rome started worshipping and holidays and they started bringing in the the wickedness 40 years later pilot car cane just to watch remember I told you Oh Lindsey by that time 40 years later they'd already made their own wafer for communion and started transubstantiation and before they left they had to bow down to the statue of Peter before they left polycarb just sat there and watch it and tried to correct the bishop afterwards bishop victor i believe was his name but it started it started by Christians being around sinners a little too much and then participating in their acts so you might have a cookout for July 4th well I'm saying if there's a listener feeding if there's not a lot of Christians there don't say long unless you're witnessing praise God cuz you don't want to start doing the works that will make you lukewarm do you that's how it start it starts with one little compromise then within 40 years they had idolatry they had transubstantiation which is more idolatry fifty years after that so hundred years later Tertullian came in and he saw the priests church he saw the priests taking bribes they were already taking runs from people to pay off their sins that was only 150 AD the priests were already letting certain men divorce and remarry in other words adultery was taken over it would just be 400 years 400 years later that the that very church the Church of Rome would hire prostitutes and they were known as a prostitute church so all the bishops could have prostitutes see how one little compromise will grow and grow and grow into more wickedness let's see how obedience will grow more and more into holiness praise God why by keeping your mind on the things of God musicians if you'll come here give us some really big news now okay woman was this helpful today by God's grace the whole point of Philippians is Paul saying I want you to have one mind let's further the gospel let's keep out false doctrines let's keep out worldly practices let's keep the gospel pure so let me ask you church is there is there any consolation in Christ is there any fellowship of the holy spirit in Christ is there any vowels in Christ is there any mercies in Christ if there is let us have one life let us think how can we get people to come to hear the gospel how can we share our services with people how can we further the message how can we have God come more into our services and bless us and help us have it not just one month what a core that should be our prayer God make us just so focused on is the Holy Spirit moving in our homes moving in our church and furthering the gospel let's pray that God will keep us free from distractions how many would say I'm giving you a week's notice I say like that weeks notice [Music] let's pray the god give us one mind that we will contest together for the gospel [Music] bother through this scripture we can see the importance of having 1 upon 1 minus Oh striking translation the next day I'm offered lots of money we just want to say this humbly Lord we want your will or we just pray that now Lord use our travels may Christ each one of us to Lourdes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
