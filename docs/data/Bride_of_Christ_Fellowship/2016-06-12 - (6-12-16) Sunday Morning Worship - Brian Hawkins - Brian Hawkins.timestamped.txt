[1:17:16] 5 everybody there this morning praise
[1:17:22] God it says and when thou prayest Thou
[1:17:25] shalt not be as the Hypocrites are for
[1:17:28] they love to pray standing in the
[1:17:29] synagogues and in the corners of the
[1:17:31] streets that they may be seen of men
[1:17:34] verily I say unto you they have their
[1:17:36] reward but thou when thou prayest enter
[1:17:40] into thy closet and when thou H has shut
[1:17:43] thy door pray to thy father which is in
[1:17:45] secret and thy father which seeth in
[1:17:47] secret shall reward thee openly but when
[1:17:50] ye pray use not vain repetition as the
[1:17:53] Heathen do for they think that they
[1:17:55] shall be heard for their much
[1:17:57] speaking be not ye therefore like unto
[1:18:00] them for your father knoweth what things
[1:18:03] you have need of before you
[1:18:05] ask after this manner therefore pray ye
[1:18:09] and would you repeat with me everybody
[1:18:11] know this Our Father which art in heaven
[1:18:15] Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[1:18:18] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[1:18:21] heaven give us us day our daily bread
[1:18:25] and forgive us our debts as we forgive
[1:18:27] our debtors and lead us not into
[1:18:30] temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for
[1:18:33] thine is the kingdom and the power and
[1:18:35] the glory forever amen and then he says
[1:18:39] for if you forgive men their trespasses
[1:18:42] your heavenly father will also forgive
[1:18:44] you but if you if if you forgive not men
[1:18:47] their trespasses neither will your
[1:18:49] father forgive your
[1:18:51] trespasses look to the Lord in prayer
[1:18:53] this
[1:18:55] morning most gracious Heavenly Father we
[1:18:57] just appreciate you we thank you we love
[1:19:00] you Lord we ask for your guidance we ask
[1:19:03] for your help we ask for your spirit to
[1:19:04] come and be with us today and uh Lord
[1:19:07] there's there's nothing in me uh that
[1:19:09] can that can come and and do anything uh
[1:19:12] without you without your spirit without
[1:19:14] your scripture Lord we are absolutely
[1:19:16] nothing Well Lord God we just pray that
[1:19:18] you would come and Minister uh to these
[1:19:20] people this morning Lord what you laid
[1:19:22] on my heart you've shown me in the
[1:19:23] scriptures and and Lord any man can just
[1:19:25] lay them out but it takes you your
[1:19:27] spirit to anoint this word to to make it
[1:19:29] real in people's lives and uh Lord we
[1:19:31] just want to follow your anointing this
[1:19:33] morning Lord we want to follow your
[1:19:35] spirit and uh just fill us once again
[1:19:37] forgive us of every trespass every uh
[1:19:39] every sin every iniquity anything that
[1:19:41] would be hindering us this morning from
[1:19:43] a closer walk with you and Lord we just
[1:19:45] pray that you would place it under the
[1:19:46] blood of Christ Jesus that precious
[1:19:48] blood that was shed on Calvary for us oh
[1:19:50] God such a selfless act Lord you did it
[1:19:52] just for us and we thank you for that in
[1:19:54] Jesus Christ's name we do pray thank you
[1:19:57] Father
[1:19:57] amen please be
[1:20:01] seated bear with me this is the first
[1:20:04] time i' I've preached from one of these
[1:20:06] things and
[1:20:07] uh it's a little bit uh more organized
[1:20:12] than paper I guess but I think I'm used
[1:20:14] to it from writing stuff down and I'm
[1:20:17] not sure if I'm going to like this or
[1:20:18] not so bear with me this is something
[1:20:20] new uh but if you would uh turn to
[1:20:23] Matthew 26 and verse
[1:20:31] 30 what we read in Matthew 6 that's just
[1:20:34] a little um that's that's how Jesus had
[1:20:38] taught the disciples how to pray and we
[1:20:39] should follow the same
[1:20:42] pattern uh you know sometimes you get
[1:20:44] into prayer somebody asks you to pray
[1:20:46] for them and you get into pray or you
[1:20:48] get into the prayer meeting and I don't
[1:20:50] know what to pray about but then other
[1:20:53] times you get to thinking man there's so
[1:20:54] much to pray about you know you forget
[1:20:56] and we just tend to forget things that's
[1:20:58] that's all I mean there's all kinds of
[1:21:00] things to pray about you know if you
[1:21:01] just sit there and meditate on on things
[1:21:04] of of uh of your life and other people's
[1:21:06] lives and and just start going back and
[1:21:09] and thinking of what people would ask
[1:21:11] you you start remembering uh what you
[1:21:13] what you can be praying for what you
[1:21:14] should be praying for and the spirit
[1:21:17] will intervene for us you know say it'll
[1:21:19] cry out I have a father for us if we
[1:21:21] know not what to pray amen amen the
[1:21:23] Matthew 26 but we thank thank God for
[1:21:26] that intervening of the spirit to come
[1:21:28] in and help us and instruct us when we
[1:21:30] don't know what to do Matthew 26
[1:21:34] and3 it says and when they had sung A
[1:21:37] Hymn they went out into the Mount of
[1:21:40] Olives then saith Jesus unto them all ye
[1:21:43] shall be offended because of me this
[1:21:45] night for it is written I will Smite the
[1:21:47] shepherd and the sheep of the flock
[1:21:49] shall be scattered abroad but after I am
[1:21:51] risen again I will will go before you
[1:21:53] into
[1:21:55] Galilee and Peter answered and said said
[1:21:58] unto him though all men shall be
[1:22:01] offended because of thee yet will I
[1:22:03] never be
[1:22:05] offended sometimes we we think that's
[1:22:07] such an honorable thing we stand up and
[1:22:08] you know Peter probably thought that was
[1:22:10] a very honorable thing and no matter
[1:22:12] what I'm going to Stand By Your Side
[1:22:14] verse 34 he says Jesus said unto him
[1:22:17] verily I say unto thee that this night
[1:22:20] before the Crow Thou shalt deny me
[1:22:23] thce and Peter said unto him though I
[1:22:26] should die with thee yet will I not deny
[1:22:29] thee likewise also said all the
[1:22:31] disciples so it wasn't just Peter that
[1:22:33] agreed with this it was all the
[1:22:34] disciples that were present with him
[1:22:35] that said we're going to back you up no
[1:22:37] matter what we're not going to we're
[1:22:39] we're not going to be offended and we're
[1:22:40] going to be here with you the whole
[1:22:44] way verse 36 it says then cometh Jesus
[1:22:48] with with them unto a place called
[1:22:50] Gethsemane and saith unto the disciple
[1:22:52] sit ye here while I go and pray Yonder
[1:22:55] now does anybody know what Gethsemane
[1:22:57] means the the interpretation of
[1:22:59] Gethsemane it means an oil
[1:23:02] press uh looking it up in a in a
[1:23:06] dictionary uh under
[1:23:13] Webster it didn't save it for
[1:23:21] me
[1:23:23] but it's
[1:23:26] uh like mental uh spiritual and mental
[1:23:30] uh a place where the great suffering
[1:23:34] would be which we know that uh Jesus had
[1:23:37] had gone through great suffering In The
[1:23:38] Garden of Gethsemane which is what we're
[1:23:40] about to read
[1:23:41] here uh in verse 36 it says then cometh
[1:23:45] Jesus with them unto the place called
[1:23:47] Gethsemane and saith unto the disciples
[1:23:48] sit ye here while I go and pray Yonder
[1:23:52] and he took with him Peter and the two
[1:23:54] sons of Zebedee and began to be
[1:23:55] sorrowful and very heavy then saith he
[1:23:58] unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful
[1:24:02] even unto
[1:24:03] death tear ye here and watch with me and
[1:24:08] he went a little further and fell on his
[1:24:09] face and prayed saying oh my father if
[1:24:12] it be possible let this cup pass from me
[1:24:15] nevertheless not as I will but as thou
[1:24:17] wil so he's relinquishing his will unto
[1:24:22] the father's will and he knows what's
[1:24:24] set before him and he's trying uh and of
[1:24:27] course any man if we knew that we were
[1:24:28] going to go through the punishment and
[1:24:29] through the the uh
[1:24:31] the the the torture and the torment that
[1:24:35] he was going to go through certainly we
[1:24:37] wouldn't want to willingly uh want to go
[1:24:39] through that right you know we we'd be
[1:24:42] we'd be a little scared we'd be afraid
[1:24:44] and and who would uh would we be willing
[1:24:46] to
[1:24:48] uh do it voluntarily for our fellow man
[1:24:56] I probably wouldn't want to I probably I
[1:24:58] know I wouldn't want to do that you know
[1:24:59] knowing to that I would be getting ready
[1:25:01] to suffer what he was getting ready to
[1:25:03] go through so you can if you can enter
[1:25:05] into his anguish if you can enter into
[1:25:08] this the suffering of what he was going
[1:25:10] through that the just the mental
[1:25:12] suffering and the spiritual suffering
[1:25:13] that he was going through but he was
[1:25:15] willing voluntarily to let that aside
[1:25:18] and says not my will Lord but your will
[1:25:21] amen
[1:25:22] oh if we could just do that to one
[1:25:25] another and to the Lord himself if we
[1:25:27] could just let down our will and just
[1:25:30] abide by his
[1:25:32] will and it says uh verse 40 and and he
[1:25:35] cometh unto the disciples and findeth
[1:25:37] them asleep and saith unto Peter what
[1:25:40] could you not watch with me one
[1:25:44] hour could you imagine his
[1:25:46] disappointment when he came upon Peter
[1:25:47] and the
[1:25:48] disciples and they were sleeping and he
[1:25:50] asked them hey I asked you to watch with
[1:25:53] me can't you watch with me for one hour
[1:25:56] you know sometimes we have a hard time
[1:25:57] in service to stay away for half an hour
[1:25:59] when a Minister's preaching but
[1:26:04] yo but just imagine the disappointment
[1:26:07] that Jesus Jesus would have had when he
[1:26:09] came up to the disciples and he found
[1:26:10] them sleeping you know the ones that
[1:26:12] just beforehand said we're going to
[1:26:14] follow you all the way you know we're
[1:26:16] not going to be offended but we're there
[1:26:17] with you the whole way we got your back
[1:26:20] he says uh watching pray that you enter
[1:26:23] not into temptation the spirit indeed is
[1:26:25] willing but the flesh is weak but that
[1:26:28] uh what I'd like to talk on this morning
[1:26:30] is what could you not watch with me one
[1:26:35] hour in verse
[1:26:38] 42 he says it it says he went away again
[1:26:41] the second time and prayed saying oh my
[1:26:44] father if this cup may not pass away
[1:26:46] from me except I drink it thy will be
[1:26:49] done so he didn't just go once he went a
[1:26:51] second time and he prayed the same thing
[1:26:54] and he came and found them asleep again
[1:26:56] for their eyes were heavy you know it
[1:26:59] could have been late in the night I'm
[1:27:00] not sure what time it was it they might
[1:27:01] say it in there but I can't recall off
[1:27:03] hand but it it it could have been late
[1:27:05] at night you know they could have been
[1:27:06] busy that day you know just
[1:27:11] tired in verse
[1:27:13] 44 he says and he left them and went
[1:27:16] away again and prayed the third time so
[1:27:19] three times he's praying the same thing
[1:27:21] so if you can uh as I said if you can
[1:27:23] enter in the first first time that he
[1:27:25] went and prayed into the mental anguish
[1:27:27] that he was going through knowing that
[1:27:28] he goes the third time and ask for the
[1:27:30] same thing so he's going through this
[1:27:33] this turmoil and it's just a a suffering
[1:27:36] that he's going
[1:27:39] through but notice it says uh and he
[1:27:41] prayed the third time saying the same
[1:27:43] words now what we read in the in Matthew
[1:27:47] 6 it says use not vain
[1:27:51] repetitions saying the same words uh
[1:27:54] what he was doing that was a little bit
[1:27:56] different from what uh vain repetition
[1:27:59] is uh he was going with with the uh
[1:28:02] again with the mental anguish and the uh
[1:28:05] there's a word I'm trying to get out but
[1:28:06] it's just not coming to my mind but he's
[1:28:09] just uh toiling through this suffering
[1:28:12] and he goes the third time to try to get
[1:28:14] it to try to get out of this
[1:28:17] situation but vain repetition is is uh
[1:28:20] worthless words and repeating uh kind of
[1:28:24] like
[1:28:25] chanting uh a few of you know that I was
[1:28:28] called out of Witchcraft I I used to get
[1:28:30] into a little bit of the the black magic
[1:28:32] and Witchcraft and that's what vain
[1:28:34] repetitions are is U I don't mean to
[1:28:37] lift it up by any means but kind of give
[1:28:39] you a little instruction on it as far as
[1:28:41] uh if somebody was going to cast a spell
[1:28:43] you would uh write out some poem or
[1:28:46] something that's what you would
[1:28:47] concentrate and you would just repeat it
[1:28:48] over and over and over and over again uh
[1:28:51] that's not what Jesus was doing here so
[1:28:54] I've heard the argument that he was
[1:28:55] using vain repetition that is not vain
[1:28:58] repetition amen that's that's going to
[1:29:01] the unjust judge and and knocking
[1:29:03] knocking and knocking you know for
[1:29:05] something that you want you're there
[1:29:06] knocking something that you need you
[1:29:08] have a desperation you're there to the
[1:29:09] to the judge and you're just knocking
[1:29:11] because you have something that that you
[1:29:13] require you're requiring something you
[1:29:15] need something so badly that you're
[1:29:17] asking and asking and asking
[1:29:20] again that's how we should come to the
[1:29:22] Lord you know in our desperations
[1:29:28] right I can never keep those things
[1:29:31] on verse 45 it says then cometh he to
[1:29:34] his disciples and saith unto him unto
[1:29:37] them he says sleep on now and take your
[1:29:41] rest behold the hour is at hand and the
[1:29:44] son of man is betrayed into the hands of
[1:29:48] Sinners and then there there had to have
[1:29:50] been some kind of a time frame in there
[1:29:52] I'm sure he didn't say this right away
[1:29:54] uh then he says Rise let us be going
[1:29:56] behold he is at hand that doth betray me
[1:29:59] so we see things are uh beginning to uh
[1:30:02] unfold here of uh why he was in the
[1:30:05] garden because I guess it's it's known
[1:30:08] that they went there often you know
[1:30:10] Jesus took his disciples there often and
[1:30:12] he went there and and
[1:30:14] prayed so Judas a scary would obviously
[1:30:18] know where he would be
[1:30:20] found now
[1:30:23] he says and while he yet spake Lo Judas
[1:30:25] one of the twel came and with him a
[1:30:27] great multitude with swords and staves
[1:30:29] from the chief priests and Elders of of
[1:30:31] the people now he that betrayed
[1:30:33] him uh gave him a sign saying whomsoever
[1:30:37] I shall kiss the same as he hold him
[1:30:41] fast and forth with he came to Jesus and
[1:30:43] said hail master and kissed him and
[1:30:46] Jesus said unto him friend wherefore art
[1:30:49] thou come notice he calls him friend you
[1:30:51] know he was he knew what Judas was there
[1:30:53] for and he didn't call him enemy he said
[1:30:56] friend and it kind of reminds me of of
[1:30:58] uh brother brandham of of how people
[1:31:00] said people didn't know who his enemies
[1:31:03] were treated everybody the same you
[1:31:06] don't you wouldn't know whose enemies or
[1:31:09] who has an enemy or not you know and if
[1:31:11] we would just be uh behave ourselves
[1:31:13] that way nobody would know that we even
[1:31:15] had any
[1:31:18] enemies he says friend wherefore art
[1:31:21] thou come then came they and laid hands
[1:31:23] on Jesus and took him and behold one of
[1:31:26] them which were with Jesus stretched out
[1:31:27] his hand and Drew a sword and struck a
[1:31:29] servant of the high priest and smote off
[1:31:31] his ear so you see they're still
[1:31:33] sticking real close to him there even
[1:31:36] even what they were saying if I die I'll
[1:31:39] still be by your side you know I'm not
[1:31:41] going to leave you so even sming off the
[1:31:44] the the priest servant's
[1:31:49] ear then said uh then said Jesus unto
[1:31:52] him put up again thy sword into his
[1:31:55] place for all they that take the sword
[1:31:56] Shall Perish with the sword think as
[1:31:59] thou I cannot now pray to my father and
[1:32:02] he shall presently give me more than 12
[1:32:04] Legions of angels but how then shall the
[1:32:06] scriptures be
[1:32:08] fulfilled that thus it must
[1:32:10] be in that same hour said Jesus to the
[1:32:13] multitudes are ye come out
[1:32:16] against out as against a thief with
[1:32:18] swords and staves for to take me I sat
[1:32:21] daily with you teaching in the temple
[1:32:23] and ye laid no hold on
[1:32:25] me but all this was done that the
[1:32:28] scriptures of the prophets might be
[1:32:29] fulfilled and then here it is then all
[1:32:32] the disciples for forsook him and fled
[1:32:35] they got scared and
[1:32:41] ran this was the greatest emotional uh
[1:32:44] battle that Jesus uh that we know of In
[1:32:48] The Garden of Gethsemane before he was
[1:32:50] to be betrayed
[1:32:52] and like I said just before this or just
[1:32:55] before this took place they all agreed
[1:32:56] that they were going to stick by Jesus's
[1:32:58] side and
[1:33:00] uh all those disciples that were adamant
[1:33:03] I'm not leaving you I'm not going to be
[1:33:05] offended in you I'm going to stay right
[1:33:07] here what happened they fled they had
[1:33:11] to because Jesus had to bear this by
[1:33:13] himself you know this this was a this
[1:33:15] was a Warfare that he had to go through
[1:33:17] himself it was his own
[1:33:19] battle you know uh
[1:33:23] but this what I'm getting at as far as
[1:33:25] the the disciples they said I'm here to
[1:33:28] be with you to be by your side I'm here
[1:33:30] to help you at any given moment a lot of
[1:33:35] times we fail at that we say that we're
[1:33:37] going to be there for our brother for
[1:33:39] our sister uh when somebody asks us to
[1:33:41] pray uh we say okay I'm going to pray
[1:33:43] for you I'm going to go to I'm going to
[1:33:45] go to prayer but what happens is
[1:33:47] sometimes we
[1:33:48] forget or sometimes it might not be
[1:33:51] significant ific enough for
[1:33:53] us I hate to say it like that but some
[1:33:55] people probably think think that way but
[1:34:00] uh well that that's just something small
[1:34:02] I don't need to pray over that but to
[1:34:04] that person it may be so important to
[1:34:09] them and if they knew what you were just
[1:34:12] thinking in their in their minds they
[1:34:14] you know they wouldn't be able to trust
[1:34:16] you anymore they wouldn't be able to put
[1:34:18] their
[1:34:20] uh
[1:34:22] they wouldn't be able to look up to you
[1:34:23] I'll put it that way uh they wouldn't be
[1:34:26] able to you wouldn't be that go-to
[1:34:27] person there's a reason why people come
[1:34:29] and ask you to pray because they have a
[1:34:31] confidence in you they have a trust in
[1:34:33] you they believe that you're a prayer
[1:34:35] Warrior whatever it is but sometimes we
[1:34:37] have such good intentions that we forget
[1:34:40] we said we're going to be there for you
[1:34:42] what can I do for you anytime you need
[1:34:43] something call me 2 three in the morning
[1:34:45] I don't care what time it is but that
[1:34:46] those when those times come sometimes we
[1:34:49] don't follow through with what we say
[1:34:52] and know we can't pray for Jesus we
[1:34:54] can't sit there and watch in the Garden
[1:34:56] of Gethsemane with Jesus because he's
[1:34:57] already uh uh been crucified dead and
[1:35:01] and resurrected that wasn't our duty
[1:35:03] that was the disciples Duty that was
[1:35:05] what he asked the disciples to do there
[1:35:07] but what our duty is now is our fellow
[1:35:09] man our brothers and sisters that is our
[1:35:11] responsibility now is to watch and pray
[1:35:13] with our brothers and sisters
[1:35:16] amen but when Jesus was was teaching us
[1:35:20] how to pray and Matthew 6 uh in in the
[1:35:23] opening scripture it wasn't uh when you
[1:35:27] go to pray he said don't go as a
[1:35:29] Hypocrites do because they want to be
[1:35:30] heard they want to be seen you know they
[1:35:33] want to be heard for their much
[1:35:34] speakings and uh he was talking about
[1:35:36] the vain repetitions don't do that he
[1:35:38] says don't follow after that pattern but
[1:35:40] follow after the pattern which I lay
[1:35:41] before you which we which we read today
[1:35:44] and uh it it it isn't in some kind of an
[1:35:46] outward show prayer isn't an outward
[1:35:48] show it it's not a competition of of who
[1:35:51] who can remember what what uh prayer
[1:35:54] requests what who has what Revelation
[1:35:56] and it's not a competition among
[1:35:58] brethren we all know that we're all
[1:35:59] grown men spiritually mature here right
[1:36:01] so we know that prayer is not a
[1:36:03] competition it's not an outward show to
[1:36:05] to do before men to show how spiritual
[1:36:08] you are but where is the prayer supposed
[1:36:10] to be it's in a supposed to be in a
[1:36:11] secret closet before Christ or before
[1:36:14] God the Father alone
[1:36:17] amen but uh it should be an intervention
[1:36:20] prayer should be an intervention we're
[1:36:22] intervening it should be a communion
[1:36:24] we're communing with
[1:36:26] God it should be uh done with a pure
[1:36:29] heart with pure meaning with
[1:36:31] sincerity and backed up with action
[1:36:34] don't use meaningless Words which is the
[1:36:36] the Vain babblings and the vain
[1:36:37] repetitions that's just that's just
[1:36:39] something that's taking up time it's
[1:36:41] just taking it's just empty words that's
[1:36:43] making your prayer seem
[1:36:46] longer again making it an outward show
[1:36:49] when you have much speaking oh man that
[1:36:51] brother man he was praying a half an
[1:36:53] hour and 45 minutes man he must be a
[1:36:55] good prayer warri but you have no idea
[1:36:57] what that brother was praying he could
[1:36:59] have been just sitting there he could
[1:37:00] have fell asleep for all you
[1:37:03] know so we can't use other people as our
[1:37:07] pattern you understand what I
[1:37:11] mean say something let me know you're
[1:37:17] alive but a lot of times there's a
[1:37:19] problem the problem lies with then is we
[1:37:21] don't know what day or what time we're
[1:37:24] living in yeah we don't understand the
[1:37:27] crucial uh time that we have or or that
[1:37:31] we don't have I should say is uh we
[1:37:33] don't
[1:37:35] uh we don't understand how close we are
[1:37:40] we don't understand how much of a lazy
[1:37:42] age this is which a lot of times we
[1:37:45] slack in prayer it's not because uh
[1:37:47] we're not interested it's because we're
[1:37:50] lazy
[1:37:54] but you
[1:37:55] ever you ever wake up
[1:37:58] and
[1:37:59] uh you wonder who you are you wonder
[1:38:02] where you
[1:38:04] are am I late for work am I late for
[1:38:07] school you ever wake up like
[1:38:09] that wait who am I where am I what am I
[1:38:12] doing what am I supposed to be doing
[1:38:14] I've done that a few times my wife says
[1:38:15] it's okay it's Saturday you're not
[1:38:17] supposed to be just
[1:38:18] sleeping but sometimes you get your mind
[1:38:21] so focused uh or you're you're stuck on
[1:38:23] something me I don't like to be late so
[1:38:26] when I wake up like that and I feel like
[1:38:28] I'm late I start panicking you know am I
[1:38:30] late for work so you ever wake up like
[1:38:33] that you're into date you weren't
[1:38:38] focusing you just and that's what
[1:38:41] happens is sometimes we spiritually fall
[1:38:44] asleep and then when we're woken up with
[1:38:46] whoa where am I what am I doing what day
[1:38:48] am I in what am I supposed to be doing
[1:38:51] we get confused we have no idea what
[1:38:53] we're supposed to be doing but that's
[1:38:55] what happens sometimes just like the
[1:38:57] disciples fell asleep in the Garden of
[1:38:59] Gethsemane and they were
[1:39:01] adamant about being there with Jesus
[1:39:04] they were
[1:39:06] adamant about helping them out in this
[1:39:08] time of
[1:39:13] trouble Matthew 24 and verse
[1:39:18] 42 everybody with me
[1:39:28] amen sometimes that's scary just for a
[1:39:31] moment you wake up you don't know who
[1:39:32] you are where you are what you're doing
[1:39:34] I couldn't imagine somebody with amnesia
[1:39:36] you know just imagine the uh the fear
[1:39:39] that they would have on them you know
[1:39:40] not knowing any and it's not coming back
[1:39:43] anytime soon but when you wake up you
[1:39:44] know 101 15 minutes you're you're doing
[1:39:47] good get a cup of coffee and you're
[1:39:48] doing
[1:39:49] better for for those that drink
[1:39:52] coffee Matthew
[1:39:55] 24:42 it says watch therefore for you
[1:39:58] know not what hour your lord doth
[1:40:01] come but know this that if the good men
[1:40:04] of the house had known in which what
[1:40:06] watch the thief would come he would have
[1:40:09] watched and would have not suffered his
[1:40:11] house to be broken up so if we knew what
[1:40:14] time of the Rapture would
[1:40:16] come we'd probably just lolly gag until
[1:40:20] the time of the rapture
[1:40:23] came but what did he say he said watch
[1:40:26] therefore for you know not what hour
[1:40:28] your lord.com so you have to be ready at
[1:40:32] any given
[1:40:33] moment amen yes sir you know some people
[1:40:38] had I was I was looking at some things
[1:40:40] uh over the weekend and uh I had read
[1:40:42] some comments over a video that I had
[1:40:45] watched and uh this person put on there
[1:40:48] and uh these people were in church for
[1:40:50] so long and and uh they were s such a
[1:40:53] good churchgoer but they were kind of
[1:40:56] coming against the church
[1:40:58] and excuse me and said something about
[1:41:02] uh teachings of a secret
[1:41:06] Rapture that that you know that that's a
[1:41:08] false teaching um no it isn't because
[1:41:11] it's not a secret it's in the scripture
[1:41:13] so the Rapture is not a secret but the
[1:41:16] time of The Happening of the Rapture is
[1:41:18] going to be a secret because doesn't the
[1:41:20] scripture teach that it it's going to be
[1:41:22] as a thief so it's going to be a secer
[1:41:25] so we just read here a thief is going to
[1:41:27] come at a time that you're not paying
[1:41:28] attention that's when they're most
[1:41:30] likely that's when they're most going to
[1:41:33] attack is when you're not
[1:41:35] ready why because it's easier to do that
[1:41:37] do it that way yeah if I was a thief I
[1:41:40] wouldn't want confrontation I want to
[1:41:41] make it easy as easy as I can so I'm
[1:41:44] going to try and make sure that nobody's
[1:41:45] home because I don't want any
[1:41:46] confrontation you know I don't want any
[1:41:48] problems I I would want to uh
[1:41:52] as I said easiest way
[1:41:55] possible that way I don't get in trouble
[1:41:57] as easy you know because a thief is
[1:42:00] trying to avoid the
[1:42:01] trouble so a thief plans things so it's
[1:42:04] a secret thing a thief isn't going to
[1:42:06] come and and lay the plans at your door
[1:42:08] and say hey I'm going to be here at such
[1:42:09] and such time no you you prepare your
[1:42:12] home you try to get locks and you try to
[1:42:14] get a security system to try to keep the
[1:42:16] thief out right so you try to prepare
[1:42:19] yourself against a thief so why not SP
[1:42:20] spiritually why not prepare yourself for
[1:42:23] the the time of The Happening that would
[1:42:25] come as a
[1:42:31] thief verse 44 says therefore be ye also
[1:42:35] ready for in such an hour as you think
[1:42:37] not the son of man cometh and you know
[1:42:39] the world they just get tired of hearing
[1:42:41] this this stuff you know because they
[1:42:44] they they've heard it
[1:42:46] for decades they've heard it for
[1:42:49] centuries you know and people people
[1:42:50] just get tired of it
[1:42:53] uh verse 45 it says who then is a
[1:42:56] faithful and wise servant whom his Lord
[1:42:58] hath made ruler over his household to
[1:43:01] give them meat and do season blessed is
[1:43:03] that servant whom his Lord when he
[1:43:05] cometh shall find so doing verily I say
[1:43:08] unto you that he shall make him ruler
[1:43:11] over all his Goods but and if that evil
[1:43:14] servant shall say in his heart my Lord
[1:43:16] delayeth his coming that would be a
[1:43:19] tragedy for us Believers to say
[1:43:21] uh why is my Lord delaying his coming
[1:43:25] you know as I said people are grumbling
[1:43:27] for years hearing uh Believers
[1:43:31] Christians saying the end is near and
[1:43:33] the time is at hand get
[1:43:35] ready uh and verse 49 it says and shall
[1:43:38] begin to Smite his fellow servants and
[1:43:40] to eat and drink with the drunken so
[1:43:43] they get tired of waiting on the Lord's
[1:43:46] uh coming that they just go out with the
[1:43:48] world they go out and drink with the
[1:43:51] drunken that's what it says here
[1:43:54] right the Lord of that servant shall
[1:43:57] come in that day or in a day when he
[1:43:59] lookth not for him and in an hour that
[1:44:02] he is not aware of and shall cut him
[1:44:04] asunder and appoint him his portion with
[1:44:06] the Hypocrites there shall be weeping
[1:44:09] and nashing of
[1:44:12] teeth but like I said we don't we don't
[1:44:14] always follow through with what we
[1:44:16] intend to do you know good intentions go
[1:44:19] bad sometimes
[1:44:21] you know we have good intentions to do
[1:44:23] something but we just don't follow
[1:44:24] through with it you know and then your
[1:44:27] words become vain because you said you
[1:44:28] were going to do something and then you
[1:44:30] didn't uphold your
[1:44:31] end but we get caught up so much in our
[1:44:34] own lives that we forget about others
[1:44:36] that are uh in need of
[1:44:38] prayer you know sometimes after a great
[1:44:41] Revival or sometimes we might be in a
[1:44:43] slump in a little
[1:44:45] uh in a little rut not getting anywhere
[1:44:48] you know it depends on the situation
[1:44:50] what what's going on sometimes you get
[1:44:51] so caught up in yourself that you forget
[1:44:53] about uh others you know somebody that
[1:44:56] some somebody that asked you to pray for
[1:44:58] them like I said earlier some somebody
[1:44:59] that has trust in you somebody that has
[1:45:01] confidence in you they're going to come
[1:45:02] say hey I'm having this struggle I have
[1:45:04] this issue that I just can't overcome
[1:45:07] would you watch with me would you pray
[1:45:08] with me you know or an accountability
[1:45:10] partner uh somebody that you go and
[1:45:13] confess things to and uh they do vice
[1:45:15] versa you know somebody that you could
[1:45:17] trust somebody that somebody that's
[1:45:19] there uh is how would you feel if you
[1:45:22] went to somebody and you said look I
[1:45:24] really need prayer I'm really having a
[1:45:25] hard time I feel like I'm backs slitter
[1:45:28] I feel like I'm just lost all together
[1:45:30] and you okay sure no no
[1:45:32] problem and then and then you
[1:45:35] get well I've got to take care of this
[1:45:38] right now you know I got a baseball game
[1:45:40] to intend to I'll pray afterward or I
[1:45:42] got some cookies and bread to bake I'll
[1:45:44] get to it after that or um I got such
[1:45:46] and such going on I'll get to it a
[1:45:48] little bit later and then you just kind
[1:45:50] of Shug it off what can you not watch
[1:45:52] with me for an
[1:45:54] hour what about 30
[1:45:57] minutes what about 15 10 five can we
[1:46:02] give somebody five minutes of our time
[1:46:04] you know a lot of times that's all
[1:46:05] that's all it takes probably not even
[1:46:07] five minutes to just bow your head and
[1:46:09] and get into a sincere prayer you know
[1:46:12] you don't have to get all this incense
[1:46:13] out you don't have to get all these
[1:46:14] flowers out you don't have to get the
[1:46:16] music out just to prepare yourself for
[1:46:18] prayer at least we shouldn't have to we
[1:46:20] shouldn't be in that kind of condition
[1:46:22] anyways we should be able to at a drop
[1:46:23] of a hat be able to get into the
[1:46:25] presence of the
[1:46:26] Lord sometimes it does it doesn't always
[1:46:28] work that way I mean that that would be
[1:46:30] perfect that would be great if it did
[1:46:32] but there are times that we should be
[1:46:33] able to just uh pray without
[1:46:36] ceasing right we should always be in a
[1:46:38] in a season of prayer
[1:46:42] always
[1:46:43] uh one of the things that that helped me
[1:46:46] with this is uh my grandmother passed
[1:46:49] away uh
[1:46:51] what did I say it was about eight years
[1:46:54] ago
[1:46:56] U I had a I had had a surgery done
[1:47:00] and she had a surgery done uh like a day
[1:47:04] or two after my surgery and she called
[1:47:06] me you know hey how' your surgery go and
[1:47:08] she she was talking to me you know
[1:47:10] wanting to know how I was doing and uh
[1:47:14] so that was great that she called she
[1:47:15] was checking up on me and she said hey
[1:47:16] would you pray with me or pray for me
[1:47:18] I'm going to have my Sur where she had a
[1:47:21] a heart valve replacement I mean it's
[1:47:23] it's pretty serious surgery you know
[1:47:25] getting into messing with somebody's
[1:47:26] heart that's always a serious one is
[1:47:30] uh
[1:47:33] that well she came out okay or she came
[1:47:36] through the surgery okay but then a day
[1:47:39] later uh she passed away because of a
[1:47:41] blood
[1:47:42] clot and I tell you I felt so guilty
[1:47:46] because I didn't pray when my own
[1:47:48] grandmother asked me to pray
[1:47:51] at her time that she she was afraid of
[1:47:53] dying she had a fear of dying and she
[1:47:55] was so afraid of this surgery that she
[1:47:58] was going to die from this
[1:47:59] surgery
[1:48:01] and I had so much guilt after that
[1:48:05] because I realized afterwards she had
[1:48:07] asked me to pray and I did not get down
[1:48:09] in sincere prayer and pray for my own
[1:48:15] grandmother the same thing I had a
[1:48:17] brother pass away here a couple months
[1:48:18] ago his name was Shane
[1:48:20] and uh he was my step
[1:48:23] brother but I that step stuff kind of
[1:48:27] goes out of out the window you know when
[1:48:29] you lived together for so long and and
[1:48:31] you develop a relationship we we were
[1:48:33] brothers and uh I remember I started
[1:48:35] ministering this was uh some years
[1:48:38] ago and uh I was talking to him about uh
[1:48:42] being a minister and before I had left
[1:48:46] the house he was up visiting and uh he
[1:48:50] got me by my side and or he got me to
[1:48:54] the side by myself sorry I'm trying not
[1:48:56] to fall apart here so I'm concentrating
[1:48:59] on that
[1:49:01] um but he had pulled me to the side and
[1:49:04] he had said Brian I need you to pray for
[1:49:06] me you know I'm really struggling he
[1:49:09] wasn't a Believer but he knew something
[1:49:11] was there you know he he told me you
[1:49:14] know I know I know there's a change
[1:49:16] there's something there and he said I'd
[1:49:18] like for you to pray pray for
[1:49:21] me and uh I told him I
[1:49:24] would I might have done it once or twice
[1:49:27] but I wasn't as fervent as Jesus was in
[1:49:29] The Garden of Gethsemane because I I
[1:49:31] might have done it once or twice I I
[1:49:33] probably didn't do it three times or
[1:49:34] four times or I didn't do it every day I
[1:49:36] didn't do it every week I didn't even do
[1:49:38] it monthly or yearly and this was uh
[1:49:40] probably 10 years ago or
[1:49:43] more so you see what I mean about when
[1:49:45] somebody asks you to
[1:49:47] pray to not shrug it off
[1:49:50] when Jesus asked his disciples to watch
[1:49:52] and pray he meant he needed somebody
[1:49:55] there with him he needed to know that
[1:49:56] somebody is there with
[1:49:58] him I mean just he was a man at that
[1:50:01] moment he was a man and and a man of
[1:50:03] like passions as us we want somebody
[1:50:06] there we want a hold a hand to hold on
[1:50:08] to we want a shoulder to cry on we want
[1:50:11] somebody there to to to know that
[1:50:13] they're in our
[1:50:14] corner right it's exhilarating to know
[1:50:17] that you have somebody backing you up
[1:50:20] to encourage you to give you
[1:50:24] confidence to boost you
[1:50:27] up to help you to know that you can
[1:50:29] receive from the
[1:50:30] Lord because they might be in a
[1:50:32] condition that um they might be in a
[1:50:35] place where they they feel that they
[1:50:36] have no hope they might be in a hopeless
[1:50:39] condition what seems hopeless to them
[1:50:42] it's a desperate time for them so
[1:50:44] they're calling out to
[1:50:47] you can you not watch with me for one
[1:50:50] hour can we not pray for somebody for
[1:50:53] one hour but like I said what about 30
[1:50:55] minutes yeah what about
[1:50:57] five can we not we have 24 hours in a
[1:51:00] day some people sleep for eight of it
[1:51:02] some people work for eight of it so
[1:51:03] there's
[1:51:05] 16 so there's another eight left
[1:51:10] right so what do we do in that
[1:51:13] time we do our own
[1:51:16] thing yeah we have our own lives we have
[1:51:18] families some of us have amilies to take
[1:51:20] care of we have children to take care of
[1:51:22] we have homes to take care of but
[1:51:24] certainly we can find five or 10 minutes
[1:51:26] in there to pray for
[1:51:33] somebody but like I said they might not
[1:51:35] have any hope they might not have any
[1:51:37] Assurance they might not have any
[1:51:40] confidence they might not have any idea
[1:51:44] how to access God you know that's a
[1:51:47] benefit of being part of a priesthood
[1:51:49] you know we're priesthood 1 Peter 2:9
[1:51:52] says we're a royal priesthood a holy
[1:51:55] nation amen and one of the
[1:51:58] benefits of being a priest and being in
[1:52:01] a priesthood is you have access to God
[1:52:04] Amen so they might not know how to have
[1:52:07] access to God that you know some people
[1:52:09] believe some people really believe that
[1:52:11] they cannot pray or talk directly to
[1:52:17] God but we know that we have a direct
[1:52:19] line to God right we have a direct
[1:52:23] hookup all we have to do is talk to
[1:52:26] him but people are in that condition
[1:52:29] that they have no idea how to talk to
[1:52:31] God and that's where we come in is we
[1:52:34] show them that they have access to God
[1:52:36] too you know we're not a Catholic priest
[1:52:38] where people have to come to us and say
[1:52:40] confess their sins to us and and we go
[1:52:44] tell while go and say so many Hail
[1:52:46] marries and our father I don't know I'm
[1:52:48] not a priest I'm I'm not a Catholic but
[1:52:50] you know I don't have the rosary beads
[1:52:52] but we don't have to do that we have our
[1:52:54] own access to God we don't have to go to
[1:52:57] S pray to some dead saint but we could
[1:53:00] pray to a living God
[1:53:04] Amen but like I said it's it's not
[1:53:09] uh you were there to help them in this
[1:53:13] situation to you can instruct them amen
[1:53:18] because if you have direct access to you
[1:53:20] could show them have to have the same
[1:53:22] James 5:116 it says confess your faults
[1:53:26] one to another like I said it's not
[1:53:28] being a Catholic priest where somebody's
[1:53:30] confessing sins but like I said the
[1:53:32] accountability partner if you have an
[1:53:34] accountability partner you're going to
[1:53:35] confess your sins to them you know
[1:53:38] because you didn't trust them but it
[1:53:39] says confess your faults one to another
[1:53:42] and pray one for
[1:53:45] another we're not one of us is above
[1:53:48] above the other one yeah I'm not greater
[1:53:50] than anybody else in here and you're not
[1:53:51] greater than me
[1:53:55] right but pray one for another that you
[1:53:58] may be healed the effectual fervent
[1:54:01] prayer of a righteous man availeth
[1:54:07] much the effectual fervent
[1:54:11] prayer not just some vain repetition
[1:54:15] well bless Susie bless Bobby and have a
[1:54:17] good
[1:54:18] day but earnestly contending for them
[1:54:22] when they ask you earnestly and
[1:54:24] fervently with passion with Desire with
[1:54:27] a
[1:54:29] care I'm not saying that y'all don't
[1:54:31] care but you understand where I'm coming
[1:54:33] from I I I hope and first John 5:14 is
[1:54:38] is a what I'm saying is we're trying to
[1:54:40] give them a confidence to know that that
[1:54:43] they can know that they can receive from
[1:54:44] God too and this is the confidence that
[1:54:48] we have in him that that is Christ Jesus
[1:54:50] that if we ask anything according to his
[1:54:53] will he heareth us and if we know that
[1:54:56] he hear us whatsoever we ask we know
[1:54:59] that we have the petitions that we
[1:55:01] desired of
[1:55:02] him amen
[1:55:09] amen you know when Jesus went to pray
[1:55:11] for people he wanted to take care of
[1:55:14] things right now like I said you know we
[1:55:17] shouldn't uh we shouldn't have the
[1:55:19] mindset well after this baseball game I
[1:55:21] got a baseball game to go run off to or
[1:55:23] I got such such an crafting that I need
[1:55:25] to be at after that when I get back I'll
[1:55:28] go ahead and take care of that prayer
[1:55:29] you
[1:55:30] know but Jesus wanted to take care of it
[1:55:33] take gyrus for
[1:55:36] example when the people came and told
[1:55:38] the that that man that his daughter died
[1:55:41] Jesus said well let's go we're going to
[1:55:43] go take care of this situation right now
[1:55:46] you know he didn't say well we'll wait
[1:55:48] until next week or something you know
[1:55:50] well she's dead there's nothing we can
[1:55:51] do now he said let's go and take care of
[1:55:54] the situation right now and if he was in
[1:55:56] that house you ever hear that song he's
[1:55:58] in the
[1:55:59] house death has to
[1:56:01] flee oh my I wish I knew it I sing it
[1:56:04] for you I'm not you don't want to hear
[1:56:05] me sing anyway but if you get to hear
[1:56:08] that song it's such a a such a wonderful
[1:56:11] song to to get you in the spirit of
[1:56:14] worship to get you if if if you have
[1:56:16] need of something listen to that song
[1:56:18] he's in the and if he was in that house
[1:56:20] in their desperation he'll be in your
[1:56:22] house in your time of
[1:56:24] desperation you get it he's omnipresent
[1:56:27] he's not uh he's not a respector of
[1:56:32] persons he's not a respector of me
[1:56:34] brother Jesse brother John because of
[1:56:36] ministers he's not respector of any
[1:56:38] person like that he doesn't care what
[1:56:41] position anybody
[1:56:43] holds what is it the the weakest of
[1:56:46] Christians come on the weakest of
[1:56:48] Christians when they get down in prayer
[1:56:50] they Shake hell right
[1:56:52] amen so it doesn't matter if you have
[1:56:55] that little bit of Faith a little bit of
[1:56:56] light overcomes Darkness I don't care
[1:56:58] how small the light is it will overcome
[1:57:01] any Darkness it could be a little
[1:57:03] penlight it will overcome that Darkness
[1:57:06] a little bit of light overcomes amen
[1:57:14] amen everybody okay with me this
[1:57:17] morning all right
[1:57:20] I
[1:57:29] heard 1 Peter 1 and
[1:57:39] 21 it says who by him do believe in God
[1:57:44] that raised him up from the dead and
[1:57:46] gave him glory that your Faith and Hope
[1:57:48] might be in God
[1:57:51] but of course we don't want to put our
[1:57:53] trust in in man you know just like
[1:57:55] healing doesn't come from
[1:57:57] man it doesn't come from a rock it
[1:58:01] doesn't come from a candle it doesn't
[1:58:03] come from a
[1:58:04] handkerchief I'm kind of getting into
[1:58:06] the Witchcraft thing again because there
[1:58:07] was Rock magic candle magic Earth
[1:58:10] Elemental Magic you know and they just
[1:58:12] concentrate their things on on that item
[1:58:15] alone which we don't there is no healing
[1:58:18] there is no power in any of that in
[1:58:22] nothing even even the handkerchiefs in
[1:58:24] acts with with Peter there was no power
[1:58:27] in the
[1:58:28] handkerchief it was their faith that
[1:58:31] brought the healing right it was their
[1:58:34] faith amen so it says uh seeing ye have
[1:58:39] purified your souls in obeying the truth
[1:58:41] through the spirit unto unfeigned love
[1:58:43] of the Brethren see that you love one
[1:58:45] another with a pure heart fervently not
[1:58:49] with a relaxed heart but with a pure
[1:58:51] heart not with a an A A Heart full of a
[1:58:55] a heart full of uh Grudge a Heart full
[1:58:58] of
[1:59:00] hatred but it says love one another with
[1:59:02] a pure heart
[1:59:05] fervently and then Titus 2 verse
[1:59:13] 11 it says for the grace of God that
[1:59:16] bringeth salvation hath appeared to all
[1:59:19] men it's there available to all men it's
[1:59:23] up to them if they choose it or not it's
[1:59:25] their choice ultimately we can't force
[1:59:28] anybody to do anything we can't force
[1:59:30] our beliefs we can't force Revelation
[1:59:32] onto somebody we can't force salvation
[1:59:34] onto
[1:59:35] people uh verse 12 it says teaching us
[1:59:38] that denying ungodliness and worldly
[1:59:41] lust we should live soberly righteously
[1:59:44] and godly in this present
[1:59:46] world looking being alert now now
[1:59:50] looking for that blessed hope and the
[1:59:52] Glorious appearing of the great God and
[1:59:54] our Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself
[1:59:57] for us that he might redeem us from all
[1:59:59] iniquity and purify unto himself a
[2:00:02] peculiar people zealous of good
[2:00:06] works these things speak and exhort and
[2:00:09] rebuke with all authority let no man
[2:00:12] despise
[2:00:13] thee but in verse 13 going again it says
[2:00:17] looking for that blessed hope is
[2:00:18] something that we're looking forward
[2:00:22] to when you're looking your eyes are
[2:00:25] awake Your Eyes Are
[2:00:27] Open you're alert you're waiting for it
[2:00:30] to happen you're expecting
[2:00:34] it and ver uh first Thessalonians
[2:00:37] chapter 5 and verse
[2:00:39] 5 it says ye are all the children of
[2:00:43] light and the children of the day we are
[2:00:47] not of the night nor of Darkness
[2:00:50] therefore let us not sleep as others do
[2:00:53] but let us watch and be sober again he's
[2:00:55] saying don't follow after that other
[2:00:57] pattern follow follow the pattern which
[2:01:00] I had laid before you don't follow after
[2:01:02] the the Hypocrites and as the
[2:01:03] worldliness does for their mind is not
[2:01:06] toward him our minds ought to be
[2:01:09] concentrated on him our minds ought to
[2:01:11] be focused on him and on his appearing
[2:01:13] at his coming waiting for his
[2:01:16] return amen and not not being grudging
[2:01:20] why is he delaying why is he taking so
[2:01:22] long and then turning into the worldly
[2:01:23] things going and getting drunk with the
[2:01:27] world you know sometimes we we get uh
[2:01:31] you rub shoulders with the world enough
[2:01:33] you sometimes you might uh be tempted to
[2:01:36] get into the same things that they do
[2:01:37] well man that cigarette sure smells good
[2:01:40] well I sure could have a
[2:01:42] beer you got to be careful of those
[2:01:45] thoughts now that's not what you should
[2:01:47] be focused on I think I heard brother
[2:01:48] John say we should we should uh meditate
[2:01:51] on Godly things the righteous things I
[2:01:54] can't remember the scripture whatsoever
[2:01:55] things are lovely whatsoever things are
[2:01:57] pure and so on the scripture says
[2:01:59] meditate upon these things you know put
[2:02:02] away from you the uh worldliness and the
[2:02:05] the
[2:02:06] uh unrighteousness and the worldly lust
[2:02:11] amen it says for they that sleep sleep
[2:02:15] in the night and they that be drunken
[2:02:18] are drunken in the night that's when
[2:02:20] things happen that's when most parties
[2:02:22] happen is during the night I think it
[2:02:24] was brother brand said that's when the
[2:02:25] that's when the demon power really comes
[2:02:27] out is through the night
[2:02:32] time but let us who are of the Day
[2:02:37] Children of the
[2:02:39] light be sober putting on the
[2:02:41] breastplate of faith and love and for in
[2:02:44] helmet the hope of salvation for God ha
[2:02:47] not appointed us to wrath but would
[2:02:49] obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus
[2:02:51] Christ who died for us that whether we
[2:02:53] wake or sleep we should live together
[2:02:55] with
[2:03:00] him think I'm got to close with this I
[2:03:02] thought I was going to be a lot longer
[2:03:03] than this but I was kind of worried on
[2:03:05] the way here man I might have to cut
[2:03:07] some of this stuff
[2:03:08] out 1 Corinthians chapter
[2:03:17] 16
[2:03:21] it says watch ye Stand Fast in the faith
[2:03:26] quit ye like men amen that doesn't mean
[2:03:30] quit that doesn't mean give up that
[2:03:32] doesn't mean stop what you're doing that
[2:03:34] doesn't mean give up the ship
[2:03:37] surrendering quit ye like men means to
[2:03:41] act like a
[2:03:44] man be courageous be brave it means to
[2:03:47] stand strong quit ye like
[2:03:50] men stand up and be a Christian if
[2:03:54] you're called to be a soldier in this
[2:03:56] blessed glorious hope and stand to be
[2:03:59] the best soldier you could be right God
[2:04:01] can't use a cowardly
[2:04:03] Soldier even our own uh uh Armed Forces
[2:04:08] can't use a cowardly
[2:04:11] Soldier cowards
[2:04:13] run we need somebody that's going to be
[2:04:16] in the
[2:04:17] fight amen he says quit ye like men be
[2:04:22] strong but let all your things be done
[2:04:26] with charity and we know charity means
[2:04:28] love let all things be done with love
[2:04:31] amen
[2:04:35] amen I'm got to close with
[2:04:38] this
[2:04:40] uh
[2:04:47] quote
[2:04:51] brother brand says this he
[2:04:52] says now then as we see this day
[2:04:55] appearing and see God sending great
[2:04:57] revivals across the country I know y'all
[2:04:59] just had some meetings and I I don't
[2:05:01] know who preached what I I don't know
[2:05:02] what happened over the weekend uh I just
[2:05:05] heard uh I think Sunday morning after
[2:05:08] brother Jim uh preach the morning
[2:05:11] service I think it was brother Mike and
[2:05:13] sister Shirley they said uh you just
[2:05:15] preached exactly I don't know who
[2:05:17] preached Saturday night
[2:05:19] whoever the brother was preaching
[2:05:20] Saturday night it might have been Isaiah
[2:05:22] Brooks brother Isaiah and they told him
[2:05:25] and said You Preach exactly what brother
[2:05:27] Brooks preached he used the same
[2:05:29] characters the same scriptures you know
[2:05:31] I guess we didn't have to be here you
[2:05:33] know we heard the same
[2:05:35] thing and we wanted to be here but we
[2:05:37] just couldn't make
[2:05:39] it but
[2:05:41] uh and see God sending great revivals
[2:05:44] across the country you Baptist a Billy
[2:05:46] Graham you Methodist of Jack Scher you
[2:05:48] Pentecostals and Oral Roberts why what
[2:05:51] God has done great signs wonders and
[2:05:54] miracles has taken place throughout the
[2:05:55] Nations everywhere and continually the
[2:05:57] nation wads on into
[2:05:59] sin all these great things
[2:06:02] happening and people still go into
[2:06:07] sin oh that's such a great thing that
[2:06:09] happened but they don't turn their eyes
[2:06:11] to God they don't turn their lives to
[2:06:15] God continually getting worse all the
[2:06:18] time
[2:06:24] it reminds me of a little story a little
[2:06:26] thing that happened uh in Louisville
[2:06:28] Kentucky about six months ago there was
[2:06:30] a lady that had her little baby and she
[2:06:32] was uh in one of those five and 10 10-
[2:06:35] cent store in Louisville and they begin
[2:06:37] to notice this the little sister uh she
[2:06:40] was picking up little gadgets you know
[2:06:42] and say look honey look honey you know
[2:06:44] just trying to get his attention so then
[2:06:46] she'd get nervous and run to another
[2:06:48] counter and say look honey look honey
[2:06:51] and the little baby would just sit
[2:06:54] staring not doing anything just
[2:06:57] staring then she'd go to another counter
[2:06:59] and another counter getting more nervous
[2:07:01] all the time she was getting Fran can
[2:07:03] can you perceive that through reading
[2:07:05] this she's getting franic for her little
[2:07:06] child uh getting more nervous all the
[2:07:08] time finally she picked up a little
[2:07:10] jingle outfit and she shook it and she
[2:07:12] said look darling look at this you know
[2:07:14] with the Bell surely that would get the
[2:07:15] baby's attention anything that ought to
[2:07:18] ATT a little boy's attention like that
[2:07:20] but he just sat and looked and stared in
[2:07:22] space you know that that's how we get
[2:07:25] sometimes you know word gets word is
[2:07:28] being preached before us something that
[2:07:29] we have need of and we're just staring
[2:07:31] off thinking about something else yeah
[2:07:33] you know not even concentrating on
[2:07:34] what's being said where that very nugget
[2:07:37] to get you out of your situation to get
[2:07:39] you out of your tribulation to help you
[2:07:40] overcome is being preached right from
[2:07:42] the pulpit and sometimes we're just not
[2:07:44] paying attention to
[2:07:45] it uh we're just staring off somewhere
[2:07:48] else yeah no I lost my place
[2:07:53] sorry
[2:07:55] uh but he just
[2:07:58] said but he just sat and looked stared
[2:08:00] in space and she fell down at the C
[2:08:02] counter and began to scream she said oh
[2:08:04] no it just can't be and the people that
[2:08:06] was in the store they were uh they went
[2:08:08] to went to her to find out what was
[2:08:10] wrong and she said my little boy about a
[2:08:12] year ago said into just staring in
[2:08:15] space and said I have done everything
[2:08:18] I've had him to the doctor and the
[2:08:20] doctor said he thought he was better but
[2:08:22] he isn't and said I've just done
[2:08:24] everything I can to attract his
[2:08:26] attention with little gadgets that ought
[2:08:28] to attract a little boy's attention of
[2:08:29] his
[2:08:31] age and said this little thing little
[2:08:34] horse cart it's got a jingle bells on it
[2:08:37] uh like a little boy near Christmas time
[2:08:39] like this ought to be listening to this
[2:08:41] uh this little bells in the snow and so
[2:08:43] forth and said he just sits and stares
[2:08:46] in in space said he's no
[2:08:49] better and her little mother heart
[2:08:51] screamed out for her baby because she
[2:08:54] knew there was something mentally wrong
[2:08:55] with her
[2:08:57] baby how we doing
[2:08:59] Saints kind of thinking reflecting on
[2:09:01] things in your own life yeah you know
[2:09:03] people that have asked
[2:09:04] you well I've been there I know I know
[2:09:08] the anguish afterward you know don't
[2:09:10] wait until somebody passes away you or
[2:09:13] don't wait until it's too late you know
[2:09:16] they've asked you beforehand
[2:09:19] he says I think that's a great deal with
[2:09:21] the church today God has shook every
[2:09:23] kind of a gift and things that he could
[2:09:24] before the church and it just sets and
[2:09:26] stares in
[2:09:28] space well that was a very nice meeting
[2:09:30] brother Roberts had a fine meeting did
[2:09:32] you walk away from your meetings a that
[2:09:33] was such a great one I can't wait for
[2:09:35] another one you know or did you really
[2:09:37] take it to
[2:09:39] heart well that was a very nice meeting
[2:09:42] brother Roberts had a real fine meeting
[2:09:44] brother Billy Graham has uh has great
[2:09:46] speaking but they don't move they don't
[2:09:49] react to the
[2:09:52] word what we need today is a soul
[2:09:55] stirring Revival something that would go
[2:09:57] down uh to cause all night prayer
[2:10:00] meetings men and women getting right
[2:10:02] with God and cities turning to God great
[2:10:04] signs and wonders would just keep
[2:10:07] accumulating but we know that America's
[2:10:09] already turned their back on God so you
[2:10:11] won't see that Nation why but if we
[2:10:13] could at least see a church you know in
[2:10:15] our own
[2:10:17] churches
[2:10:19] God sends us gifts he shakes them before
[2:10:21] our eyes and if we turn them down then
[2:10:23] what God can do about it if that mother
[2:10:26] thought about uh thought that about her
[2:10:29] baby what does God think tonight about
[2:10:31] his church when we've had so much before
[2:10:33] us great men in the land Tommy Osborne
[2:10:36] uh and brother Allan and and we have
[2:10:38] good Brothers now you know your pastor
[2:10:40] is one of them brother cam you know and
[2:10:42] the different ones throughout you I'm
[2:10:45] not into politics so I'm not going to
[2:10:47] politics for individuals
[2:10:50] [Music]
[2:10:51] so oh how many great men has has crossed
[2:10:54] the nation from place to place all kinds
[2:10:56] of signs and wonders has showed up right
[2:10:58] at the end time and yet the church sets
[2:11:01] dazed it just sets dazed it just sits
[2:11:04] staring not doing anything about
[2:11:07] it they say oh it was pretty good I
[2:11:10] believe I may go to another uh to
[2:11:12] another night see what will take place
[2:11:15] at the next meeting you know even with
[2:11:17] brother Brandon with with his Healing
[2:11:19] Ministry you know people just went to
[2:11:20] see the miracles happen they weren't
[2:11:22] concerned about the word which that's
[2:11:24] the lifechanging uh substance is the
[2:11:28] word amen it isn't the healing it isn't
[2:11:31] the Miracles that's not yeah it's
[2:11:32] lifechanging in the natural to some
[2:11:34] people that the miracles happen to but
[2:11:37] that's not eternal life destination
[2:11:41] changing the word is that
[2:11:45] substance that's not the thing to do
[2:11:47] what we need when we see God moving in
[2:11:49] our midst is to get down to business
[2:11:52] with it pray and cry out and do all that
[2:11:54] we know how to do so you're expelling
[2:11:57] all of your tools everything that you
[2:11:58] know how to do you're putting your all
[2:12:00] into it everything that you know what to
[2:12:02] do that you could support your meetings
[2:12:06] uh the the future meetings that you're
[2:12:08] going to have even the weekly meetings
[2:12:10] that you
[2:12:11] have you put everything into it well I
[2:12:14] guess we got to go to service tonight
[2:12:15] you know I wonder what the brother's
[2:12:16] going to preach on you know wonder if
[2:12:18] he's going to step on my toes wonder if
[2:12:19] he's going to encourage me wonder if
[2:12:21] he's going to bless me
[2:12:22] tonight now we can't have that kind of a
[2:12:24] mindset amen
[2:12:31] right he says what we need when we see
[2:12:33] God moving in our midst is to get down
[2:12:35] to business with it pray and cry out and
[2:12:37] do all that we know how to do let the
[2:12:39] gospel in this day in this last days
[2:12:41] attract our attention the Bible promised
[2:12:43] that this gospel would just become so
[2:12:46] each day like in the days of of Luther
[2:12:48] he taught justification it come in the
[2:12:51] minority when he come into the Wesley
[2:12:53] Methodist age through sanctification
[2:12:55] then when they settled down to a church
[2:12:57] and that was all there was to it God
[2:13:00] raised up Pentecost and now it's got to
[2:13:02] the place that Pentecost is becoming
[2:13:04] formal and indifferent and I would even
[2:13:06] go so far as to say the message has
[2:13:08] become informal and indifferent you know
[2:13:11] it's become a playground or something or
[2:13:13] some kind of a a nursery a nursery
[2:13:16] school
[2:13:18] I say that because people aren't
[2:13:20] becoming
[2:13:22] mature well it's either the ministry or
[2:13:25] your
[2:13:26] attitude it's one or the other if the
[2:13:29] minister is preaching the word the whole
[2:13:31] un uh the whole pure word that is not
[2:13:34] the
[2:13:43] ministry they come in the minority when
[2:13:45] you come into Wesley Methodist stes
[2:13:48] through
[2:13:49] sanctification uh let's see and now it's
[2:13:52] got to a place that Pentecost is
[2:13:53] becoming formal and indifferent God
[2:13:55] moves right on he said he won't stop at
[2:13:58] all he goes right on even in the message
[2:14:01] pews or chairs however you want to put
[2:14:03] it however the setup is it doesn't it
[2:14:05] doesn't matter if we don't reach out and
[2:14:07] get it he's just going to pass right by
[2:14:09] if we don't take him at his word if we
[2:14:11] don't put our confidence in him if we
[2:14:13] don't trust in him they'll pass right on
[2:14:16] by pass me not oh gentle savior amen
[2:14:20] that's my
[2:14:21] cry
[2:14:24] amen the children of Israel followed a
[2:14:26] pillar of fire and every time that fire
[2:14:29] stopped they stopped with it and if they
[2:14:32] didn't move they was left in the
[2:14:34] wilderness they were going to get left
[2:14:37] behind they had to move where the fire
[2:14:39] moved that's the way God's Church always
[2:14:42] does it moves with the fire when Martin
[2:14:45] Luther saw the fire in the First
[2:14:46] Reformation he come out of the Catholic
[2:14:49] church and he built his denomination
[2:14:50] under the fire moved into sanctification
[2:14:53] he was already organized under that and
[2:14:55] couldn't do it go any F farther
[2:14:57] Methodist took it and they organized
[2:14:59] under that and they couldn't go no
[2:15:01] farther Pentecost come and took it from
[2:15:03] them now if we don't watch the fire will
[2:15:06] move right on
[2:15:08] again let's stay under the fire worship
[2:15:11] right under the fire Worship in the
[2:15:13] power and the spirit believing God's
[2:15:15] word laying aside every weight and every
[2:15:18] sin that does so easily beset us amen
[2:15:20] following that fire wherever the fire
[2:15:23] goes that's where we ought to go amen
[2:15:26] not getting the hose out and quenching
[2:15:27] the fire
[2:15:29] no
[2:15:31] amen you would stand to your feet with
[2:15:34] me I'm going to go ahead and
[2:15:42] close I told a sister I said when I was
[2:15:46] studying I I fell asleep sleep a couple
[2:15:48] times and she said well you might want
[2:15:49] to pick a different topic if it's making
[2:15:51] you fall asleep what's it going to do to
[2:15:52] the
[2:15:54] congregation I found it funny because I
[2:15:56] was going to be talking about
[2:16:02] sleeping but we let so many things pass
[2:16:05] by us this is the hour that we need to
[2:16:08] watch there is no time for
[2:16:10] sleeping this isn't the time for
[2:16:12] sleeping if we knew the hour the thief
[2:16:14] was going to
[2:16:15] come then we would wait for that exact
[2:16:18] hour for that Thief to come and we
[2:16:20] wouldn't be ready at any other
[2:16:24] time I don't know I I I think I've said
[2:16:27] this here before uh when I was in the
[2:16:31] military we had what was called a
[2:16:32] Mobility bag I don't know if anybody's
[2:16:35] been in the military here or not uh what
[2:16:37] a Mobility bag
[2:16:39] is uh you have your uniforms in there uh
[2:16:44] you have your soap deodorant all than
[2:16:47] Necessities in case if you were called
[2:16:49] to War uh
[2:16:51] which uh if if you were called to go
[2:16:54] somewhere you had to have that bag ready
[2:16:57] you had to have your stuff ready right
[2:16:58] now because you have no time to pack
[2:17:01] there's no time to pack stuff so when
[2:17:04] you were called uh when your name is
[2:17:06] called on that list you better get your
[2:17:07] stuff and get the next person and you
[2:17:09] better get going because you're you're
[2:17:11] deploying right now so the same thing is
[2:17:13] with the Rapture when the time comes you
[2:17:15] have no time to pack anything you have
[2:17:17] no time to become righteous at that time
[2:17:19] but when the Rapture Comes The Rapture
[2:17:21] is coming now taking whoever's ready to
[2:17:25] go so let's unpack stuff that doesn't
[2:17:28] need to be in our bag and pack the
[2:17:30] necessity the necessary things that
[2:17:32] belong in our mobility in our rapturing
[2:17:34] bag if you would amen we've got to be
[2:17:37] ready we cannot this is not the time to
[2:17:39] be sleeping this is the time to be alert
[2:17:42] it says watch and pray for that glorious
[2:17:44] appearing
[2:17:46] amen
[2:17:49] you know uh I I can't remember exactly
[2:17:52] how it said but we know that there was a
[2:17:53] man that that uh had such good crops
[2:17:56] that he he tore the one Barn down and he
[2:17:58] built another one and he pecked it so
[2:18:00] fully he says now so I can take my
[2:18:03] knees just because you got baptized you
[2:18:06] repented and you you received the gift
[2:18:08] of the Holy Ghost that doesn't mean that
[2:18:10] you sck back and and take your ease and
[2:18:12] just watch things happen that's right no
[2:18:14] we move with the fire right fire puts it
[2:18:16] in the action so you have the Holy Ghost
[2:18:18] of fire you're going to be full of
[2:18:20] action you're not going to sit idly by
[2:18:23] idleness is in a sin

[2:24:05] in as a city with no room for its king
[2:24:07] While You Were Sleeping a little town of
[2:24:10] Jerusalem looks like another silent
[2:24:12] night the father gave his only son the
[2:24:14] way the truth the life had come but
[2:24:17] there was no room for him in the world
[2:24:19] he came to save isn't that so
[2:24:23] sad they couldn't accept him because
[2:24:25] they were sleeping to what was going on
[2:24:26] they had they have eyes to see and ears
[2:24:28] to hear but they they can't see or hear
[2:24:32] of what's going on or what happened in
[2:24:33] their day and the same thing is
[2:24:35] happening in this day right you know
[2:24:36] people have eyes to see and ears to hear
[2:24:38] but they're not they choose not to

[2:24:55] your cross today Jerusalem you will go
[2:24:57] down in history as a city with no room
[2:25:00] for its king and then then they get
[2:25:02] right down into it as far as the United
[2:25:04] States of America looks like another
[2:25:06] silent night as we're sung to sleep by
[2:25:10] philosophies isn't that so true they're
[2:25:13] singing these people to sleep they're
[2:25:14] longing them to sleep by these different
[2:25:16] Phil philosophies that they
[2:25:18] have about LGBT about abortion about all
[2:25:21] these different things yes I know I'm on
[2:25:23] the
[2:25:24] internet that's one thing that makes me
[2:25:26] nervous coming here is because I know
[2:25:29] anybody can see it but I'm gonna say you
[2:25:33] know they're Ling people to sleep with
[2:25:35] their philosophies to try to get people
[2:25:37] to accept their way of
[2:25:40] life and they're bullying people with
[2:25:44] it that's as were're starting as sleep
[2:25:47] by philosophies that save the trees and
[2:25:50] kill the children isn't that so true the
[2:25:52] way they want to save gorillas but yet
[2:25:55] they kill children they want to save
[2:25:57] historical buildings but yet they want
[2:25:59] to kill children they want to save
[2:26:01] replica military uh memorabilia uh
[2:26:05] helicopters tanks or the whatnot they
[2:26:07] want to save those inanimate things but
[2:26:09] they want to kill the children they want
[2:26:10] to allow abortion to
[2:26:13] happen they want to save the
[2:26:15] pets but they allow killing of
[2:26:20] children this country is lulled to
[2:26:23] sleep by these
[2:26:25] philosophies by these immoral
[2:26:31] philosophies and while they while we're
[2:26:33] lying in the dark there's a shout heard
[2:26:35] across the Eastern sky for the
[2:26:37] bridegroom has returned and has carried
[2:26:39] his bride away in the night America what
[2:26:43] will we miss while we are sleeping will
[2:26:45] Jesus come again and leave us slumbering
[2:26:47] where we lay America will we go down in
[2:26:50] history as a nation with no room for its
[2:26:55] king you see how it is you can stand to
[2:26:58] your feet and I'm going to go ahead and
[2:27:01] close you see how it is is with men's
[2:27:05] philosophies they they try to criticize
[2:27:08] our way of life saying you have one
[2:27:10] track mind but they do the same if not
[2:27:12] worse as far as it's their way or no way
[2:27:15] they try to bully things
[2:27:17] they try to bully their way
[2:27:19] through forgive me of the rant but it's
[2:27:21] it's just what I see in this day and it
[2:27:24] upsets me especially when it gets into
[2:27:26] churches and churches accept the same
[2:27:29] thing when they know it's an Abomination
[2:27:31] against God they have no backbone to
[2:27:34] wake up and to stand for Christ they we
[2:27:37] need a lot more Peters that would stand
[2:27:39] up and and and be
[2:27:41] bold not that we not that we want to
[2:27:44] fight people that's that's not what I'm
[2:27:46] saying I'm not saying go and fight but
[2:27:47] stand up for what we believe we canot
[2:27:49] fall asleep in this day but we must have
[2:27:52] that urgency within our hearts to stay
[2:27:55] awake Jesus said can you not watch with
[2:27:58] me one
[2:27:59] hour can we not watch through the rest

[2:31:50] greater than the blood and how can you
[2:31:53] say what could be greater than the blood
[2:31:54] well you are because you were the
[2:31:56] purchase of that blood you know if you
