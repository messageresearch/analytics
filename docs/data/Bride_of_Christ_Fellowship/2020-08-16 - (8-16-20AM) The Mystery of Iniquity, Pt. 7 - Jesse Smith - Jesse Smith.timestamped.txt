[29:41] we're happy to be in your house today
[29:43] happy to sing your praises in jesus
[29:46] christ's name the church said
[29:48] amen praise god let's stand and take our
[29:49] bibles here today
[29:59] let's go to matthew chapter 24.
[30:08] 11 we'll read our text here
[30:10] um
[30:12] and then we'll do our memory verse as
[30:13] well by god's grace which wonderful
[30:15] songs brother this wonderful song thank
[30:16] god
[30:18] our god reigns praise god
[30:23] matthew 24 11-13
[30:26] then we'll do our memory verse
[30:43] i'll just read this myself here um
[30:46] 24 11 down actually down to 14.
[30:51] now listen to this iniquity we'll look
[30:52] at mystery of iniquity part 7 again this
[30:54] morning
[30:56] listen to jesus talk about iniquity now
[30:58] remember brother brahm said the six
[30:59] seals are in matthew 24. how many
[31:02] remember that
[31:03] the six seals are in here and of course
[31:05] then jesus drops in uh
[31:07] he hides it or at least you know
[31:10] either the author wrote it in a way to
[31:12] hide it from the eyes of the wise and
[31:14] prove it because there's no real order
[31:16] amongst all these verses but he drops in
[31:18] the revelations about the rapture praise
[31:20] god
[31:21] but look at verse 11 to 14. i'll read
[31:23] this and many false prophets shall rise
[31:26] and shall deceive many
[31:29] and because iniquity shall abound
[31:33] the love of many
[31:35] shall wax cold
[31:38] now let me just stop and say if you
[31:39] don't feel love in our church
[31:40] something's wrong with us
[31:43] right because we believe we're one of
[31:44] the few how many believe you're one of
[31:45] the few amen
[31:48] almost every church jesus said if you
[31:50] there be that find it almost every
[31:51] church is lacking love but if we're a
[31:53] real church we should feel the love of
[31:54] god in our in our in our fellowship amen
[31:57] because he said one way you'll know my
[31:58] disciples is their love one for another
[32:04] but it's going to be cold everybody else
[32:06] is going to be cold like ice but we're
[32:08] going to be hot with love praise god
[32:11] verse 13.
[32:13] but he that shall endure see you're hot
[32:16] you're hot but you got to endure all
[32:17] this coldness
[32:18] everyone else is cold but you're hot
[32:21] he that shall endure unto the end the
[32:24] same shall be saved
[32:26] verse 14 and this gospel the good news
[32:30] of the kingdom shall be preached in all
[32:32] the world that's gentile right this is a
[32:35] gentile ministry for a witness unto all
[32:38] nations or all gentiles
[32:41] and then
[32:42] shall the end come
[32:45] we'll have to make sure we pray that god
[32:47] opens up these countries again that we
[32:48] can go preach the gospel
[32:51] brother simon brother craig and
[32:52] different ones but adjacent to mars can
[32:54] go preach the gospel because after that
[32:57] then the end comes once it's preached to
[32:59] every nation praise god that'll be our
[33:01] text let's go to matthew 6 though for
[33:03] our memory verse
[33:07] it's good to see all the saints in the
[33:09] house of lord today i'll try to be
[33:11] careful uh on my time here
[33:15] looking forward to wendy's testimony
[33:16] this morning praise god
[33:18] and then uh karen's this evening so
[33:19] looking forward to those
[33:22] let's read matthew 6 30 down to 34.
[33:27] aren't you glad church that you can seek
[33:29] first the kingdom of god amen oh my we
[33:31] used to seek all these other things amen
[33:33] i wake up and i'd go right to chewing
[33:35] tobacco i'd wake up and go right to the
[33:37] movies and sports
[33:38] right now i can go right to jesus christ
[33:40] amen i seek the kingdom of god purify my
[33:43] heart rule my heart take authority over
[33:45] my life that's what we can do today by
[33:47] god's grace
[33:49] matthew 6 verse 30. let's read 30 down
[33:51] to 34. on 3 1 2 3
[33:54] wherefore if god so clothed the grass of
[33:57] the field which today is and tomorrow is
[34:01] cast into the oven shall not he not much
[34:05] more clothe you o ye of little faith
[34:09] therefore take no thought saying what
[34:12] shall we eat or what shall we drink or
[34:15] wherewithal shall we be clothed for
[34:18] after all these things do the gentiles
[34:21] seek for your heavenly father knoweth
[34:23] that ye have need of all these things
[34:26] but seek ye first the kingdom of god and
[34:29] his righteousness and all these things
[34:32] shall be added unto you take therefore
[34:35] no thought for the morrow for the morrow
[34:37] shall take thought for the things of
[34:39] itself sufficient unto the day is the
[34:42] evil thereof may god add his blessings
[34:44] to the ring of his word you may be
[34:46] seated praise god
[34:50] all right praise god i don't have any
[34:52] slides or anything right now so we'll
[34:54] just preach out of these notes
[34:56] by the grace of god i don't know if you
[34:57] saw it this week let me set my timer
[34:59] here
[35:00] um how there was a peace deal with
[35:03] israel i don't know if you saw that um i
[35:05] believe that's a uh a prefigure
[35:07] uh to
[35:09] the seven year uh covenant between the
[35:12] pope and israel
[35:14] i believe it's just a pre-figure just
[35:15] like covet is a pre-figure to all right
[35:18] it's the beginning of sorrows
[35:20] it's something that grips the whole
[35:21] world well the whole world had to
[35:23] witness this week that uh even israel's
[35:25] worst enemies can make a covenant with
[35:28] them now we don't know what's happening
[35:29] behind the scenes there might be money
[35:31] i imagine that's what it is because the
[35:32] love of money uh is the root of all evil
[35:36] not that that's evil that's peace but to
[35:38] get an evil country that worships allah
[35:40] to get them to go to peace i would think
[35:42] you'd have to pay him off or something
[35:44] but just interesting uh to note that
[35:47] and lord willing in the future when we
[35:49] get to uh these other series
[35:52] uh i'm gonna preach my uh different i
[35:54] have a different revelation or different
[35:56] understanding of daniel's 70 weeks i
[35:58] believe they will make a seven year
[36:00] covenant
[36:01] i used to think there was only three and
[36:02] a half years left i know there's quotes
[36:04] on that but there's also a quote that
[36:05] brother bam says there's seven years
[36:07] left so brother graham paul taught both
[36:10] i used to think there was only three and
[36:11] a half left i actually now believe
[36:13] there's seven weeks or seven years left
[36:15] i believe that now after studying it and
[36:17] examining the scripture and history
[36:21] um but either way remember church
[36:22] doesn't matter right because we'll be
[36:24] gone amen doesn't really matter amen now
[36:27] people want to fight and argue and name
[36:29] call and blaspheme each other that's
[36:31] evil
[36:32] so if you disagree just do it in love
[36:34] praise god that's the one thing because
[36:36] if you got really jesus christ then you
[36:37] will love your enemies
[36:39] you'll love people your friends that you
[36:40] disagree with if you really have the
[36:42] holy spirit praise god and just so you
[36:44] know i did email brother joseph branham
[36:46] yesterday so
[36:47] it took me four months to email him so i
[36:49] apologize to him over and over for that
[36:51] i finally got back to myself god's great
[36:54] worked on that yesterday
[36:56] for the debate in september so we're
[36:58] just trying to press on in the name of
[37:01] mr
[37:03] the bible says all nations shall come
[37:05] against israel
[37:07] uh when the covenant is broken remember
[37:09] that that's in zechariah 12 it's
[37:10] zechariah 13. it's also in daniel 11.
[37:13] all nations so they're going to begin
[37:15] after the rapture there's going to be
[37:17] with israel and the world they're going
[37:19] to say peace and safety and they're
[37:22] going to miss your agreement but in the
[37:24] midst of the year they're going to break
[37:25] the covenant
[37:27] right so they're all going to have peace
[37:29] israel is going to have peace with
[37:30] everybody for uh three and a half years
[37:32] and they'll be sacrificing animals
[37:34] they'll have their temple again by the
[37:35] rams said it's the lord revelation 11
[37:37] says thus saith the lord they're going
[37:38] to rebuild that temple so we're church
[37:41] we are seeing pre-figures
[37:43] of the end times all right we are
[37:44] singing seeing the the ending of song
[37:47] pre-figures to uh a
[37:50] covenant between israel and their
[37:52] enemies
[37:53] and so we are uh we're privileged to
[37:55] live at this time remember church you
[37:57] didn't decide to come at this time god
[37:59] sent you here at this time
[38:01] we might have picked other times to live
[38:03] i mean
[38:04] my daughter haven talks about all the
[38:06] time how she would like to sit on
[38:07] jesus's lap
[38:09] she wanted to be one of those children
[38:10] that would run up and i agree i would
[38:12] like to do that too you know
[38:14] uh but one thing we'll run into his arms
[38:17] and we cross over
[38:19] we know that he'll wipe away the bible
[38:20] said he'll wipe away all the tears from
[38:22] our eyes
[38:23] but you know god chose and god ordained
[38:25] we're alive in this hour so we can be
[38:27] overcomers in this hour but ram said we
[38:30] have nothing to fear in this hour
[38:33] if god protected the saints in every age
[38:35] heading down no matter what tribulation
[38:37] their face god will protect us by his
[38:39] grace
[38:40] so let's all let's cast out all fear
[38:43] by faith praise god
[38:45] amen
[38:46] now uh let's look here i think that's it
[38:48] as far as updates also uh saying wendy i
[38:51] have those packets here but i have stuff
[38:53] to type out all the directions
[38:55] i'm not quite sure so i had i have
[38:58] everybody anybody want to send out
[38:59] letters to the message churches and so i
[39:01] got two people that want to that's
[39:02] wonderful
[39:03] um but i don't know how to divide it up
[39:05] like i don't know if i'll have like you
[39:06] do a through m like all the states a
[39:08] through all and find all the message
[39:10] churches in alaska down to minnesota and
[39:13] then you'll do new mexico down to
[39:16] i don't know what the last state would
[39:17] be in the alphabet
[39:19] but uh i haven't decided that but i have
[39:21] all the stamps i have the letters i have
[39:23] the envelopes i have the return labels
[39:27] so i just need help with uh writing out
[39:29] the the addresses on the front of the
[39:32] envelope so i really feel burdened to do
[39:35] that
[39:36] uh to to share our youtube videos and to
[39:38] share our uh
[39:40] our book you know our modesty book by
[39:42] the grace of god uh because it's helped
[39:44] so many people i got another email this
[39:45] week i always help people i saw on uh
[39:49] i saw on amazon there's numerous more
[39:51] comments there are 16
[39:53] reviews in my book and they're all five
[39:55] stars so jesus is the five-star general
[39:57] so i thought
[39:59] take pride somebody to go put a one on
[40:01] one star on there today or tomorrow
[40:04] but that's okay i know in jesus's book i
[40:06] believe it's a five star because i
[40:08] believe he wrote it by god's grace
[40:10] he is an inspiration behind it well
[40:12] let's look today now i want to start
[40:14] here i got uh 34 more minutes so i'll
[40:16] lay this in here we had a great time on
[40:18] wednesday if you needed a chance to
[40:19] watch that that was a wonderful service
[40:20] in the lord uh
[40:22] just all the iniquity so on wednesday we
[40:24] saw all now there were 73 sins listed
[40:27] now some of them were overlapped some of
[40:29] them were mentioned
[40:30] as repeats there were 73 sins that would
[40:33] either keep people out of heaven or at
[40:35] least keep them out of the ruling class
[40:37] of the bride
[40:39] and we know that the bible says there
[40:40] were some that will will not enter the
[40:42] city there are some that will enter the
[40:44] city some that will live in the city
[40:46] some will bring their glory and honor to
[40:48] the city
[40:49] so not all people will live in that new
[40:51] jerusalem there is a special class of
[40:54] people and it's by grace praise god
[40:57] they let grace that class lets grace
[40:59] labor in them
[41:01] more abundantly than others others will
[41:03] serve more by grace than others it's
[41:05] just it's their choice it's up to them
[41:07] it's not that god favors them or loves
[41:09] them more
[41:10] god gives everybody the chance to labor
[41:13] but it's the individual's choice how
[41:15] much will they let grace labor in their
[41:17] lives
[41:18] amen praise god because paul said it was
[41:20] the grace that was with me help me labor
[41:23] more than peter more than james more
[41:25] than john uh more than thomas thomas was
[41:28] a great laborer he doubted at the
[41:29] beginning all of us would have doubted
[41:31] all right but thomas was a great labor
[41:34] he took the gospel to asia and did a
[41:37] tremendous ministry
[41:39] but paul labored more abundantly than
[41:41] them all praise god so if you didn't see
[41:43] that i think that'd be a blessing to you
[41:45] to see how the blood of christ washes
[41:47] all of those iniquities away from us
[41:50] now remember of iniquity abounds at the
[41:52] end time we saw it jesus christ
[41:55] says genuine love will be hard to find
[41:58] at the end time
[41:59] he also said genuine faith will be hard
[42:01] to find right because he talked about
[42:03] the widow woman that would knock so
[42:05] listen church see if we have real love
[42:07] it'll cause us to keep praying for our
[42:08] loved ones amen it'll cause us to keep
[42:11] praying that god will save souls and
[42:14] help us to love each other and help us
[42:16] to fulfill real christian lives praise
[42:18] god
[42:19] genuine love and genuine prayers are
[42:21] going to be hard to find they're going
[42:22] to be rare but by god's grace uh if we
[42:25] have zealous repentance the message to
[42:27] the laodicean church age is be zealous
[42:30] and repent he said as many as i love i
[42:33] rebuke and chasten amen so it is god's
[42:35] love that corrects us and causes us to
[42:38] do hot works for him and minister and
[42:42] serve in the age when iniquity is at its
[42:45] greatest amount there's never been an
[42:47] age of iniquity like this age uh paul
[42:50] says it in second timothy 3 13 evil men
[42:53] and seducers shall wax worse and worse
[42:56] deceiving and being deceived isn't that
[43:00] something those that are deceived are
[43:02] deceiving others
[43:04] by
[43:05] uh but see america's churches though
[43:07] work the worse iniquity because america
[43:11] is the beast out of the land and the and
[43:13] out of the beast out of the land flows
[43:15] the mark of the beast
[43:17] right so america's churches will be the
[43:20] most churches filled with iniquity uh
[43:23] hopefully i'm saying that right here now
[43:25] the future union of the government
[43:28] uh of and the americas churches in
[43:30] america's government will issue the
[43:32] official mark of the beast and that will
[43:34] be a leash upon the whole world right
[43:37] now let's go to ezekiel
[43:39] just if you got your bible just
[43:41] just flipping through your scriptures
[43:42] here
[43:51] now look here just
[43:53] look how ezekiel
[43:55] remember he was the prophet to israel
[43:58] while they were out of babylon
[44:00] remember church at the same time ezekiel
[44:03] and jeremiah were ministering at the
[44:05] same time
[44:06] i know that goes against where what you
[44:08] know brother brahm says there's never
[44:09] two prophets at the same time but
[44:11] sometimes there are
[44:12] remember moses and elijah in the
[44:14] tribulation there's going to be two
[44:15] prophets there at the same time
[44:16] sometimes there are okay but some people
[44:19] will take those quotes and they'll just
[44:20] they'll go they'll go to seed on them
[44:23] like they'll make those fighting words
[44:25] yet brother brahm teaches us he said
[44:26] take everything back to the word amen so
[44:29] we've got to be humble enough to accept
[44:30] the revelation of god's word
[44:32] so as ezekiel ministered to the the
[44:35] exiled in babylon he says this in verse
[44:38] 49 notice they have the same laodicean
[44:41] conditions
[44:42] that we have today look at verse 49
[44:44] behold this was the iniquity of thy
[44:47] sister
[44:48] sodom pride
[44:51] fullness of bread and abundance of
[44:53] idleness was in her
[44:56] and her daughters remember
[44:58] sodom was samaria right
[45:00] and then israel was the other was her
[45:02] sister i forget the name of the other
[45:04] one
[45:06] but look what what what's their sin
[45:08] their sin is they're so prideful they
[45:11] have all kinds of bread they have
[45:14] and they're idle their abundance in
[45:16] idleness they're not working the works
[45:18] of god
[45:19] was in her and her daughters neither did
[45:21] she strengthen the hand of the poor
[45:23] needy look at verse 250 and they're
[45:25] haughty and committed abominations
[45:27] therefore i took them away as i saw good
[45:30] so look at this israel was in the same
[45:32] conditions laodicea was
[45:35] rich increase with goods have need of
[45:37] nothing and lukewarm works
[45:41] see not working not letting their faith
[45:44] work by love amen i'll tell you right
[45:46] here this is a labor of love right here
[45:48] church
[45:49] you got to have love to reach out to
[45:50] people that you don't know and uh you
[45:52] don't
[45:53] maybe have turned you down before maybe
[45:56] write you off with just some renegade
[45:58] message church or something like that a
[46:00] renegade message preacher you got to
[46:02] have love right you you want to reach
[46:04] out praise god and i said that before
[46:06] too if you want to send letters i'll
[46:07] send letters to your family you just
[46:09] let me know how many i can print and how
[46:11] many books you want to send i'll send
[46:12] them to your family i sent them to my
[46:14] mother's side a few years ago
[46:16] see their works were were lukewarm
[46:21] and it was because they had so much
[46:22] money and they had so much bread
[46:26] they let
[46:27] pride and and and money take them away
[46:30] from god in other words they said we
[46:32] don't need god anymore i'll say like
[46:34] this
[46:35] god
[46:37] whatever god wants whatever is going to
[46:38] keep me close to god he i'll allow him
[46:40] to do it in my life
[46:42] if that means the finances are tight for
[46:44] a few months or years or if that means
[46:46] uh you know something
[46:48] awful might happen then so be it but
[46:50] lord keep me near the cross help me to
[46:53] trust in you and not in man
[46:56] amen help me to trust in god and not my
[47:00] bank account praise god
[47:02] and not the amount of food that i have
[47:04] in my refrigerator or freezer
[47:07] help me not to trust in that but help me
[47:09] to want more of god amen
[47:11] hallelujah i believe that's what you
[47:12] desire
[47:14] see that's exactly like
[47:16] uh the laodicean age
[47:19] now see they got now this in church
[47:21] israel got spewed out of the land
[47:23] the churches get spewed out of his mouth
[47:26] right the bible said he'll spew my land
[47:29] so jesus they
[47:30] make him sick to his stomach remember
[47:32] the bible said the tables are full of
[47:33] vomit
[47:34] they're communion tables when we have
[47:36] communion here
[47:37] ours are holy we believe
[47:39] but the denominations are full of vomit
[47:41] because it makes god disgusted
[47:44] that he gives them all these blessings
[47:46] but they don't do his works they forget
[47:48] about him oh god help us not to forget
[47:51] help us to remember the promises of god
[47:53] amen
[47:54] help us to remember to work for the lord
[47:56] hallelujah
[48:00] hungry and thirsty for more divine
[48:02] righteousness while we're busy working
[48:05] for the kingdom of god
[48:06] let that be my story let that be my song
[48:09] amen
[48:10] i'm always hungry for more of god and
[48:12] i'm busy working for him praise god amen
[48:21] now let's look at the trail of the
[48:22] serpent here
[48:23] because i i just put that section in
[48:25] there
[48:27] because in the in the book now i just go
[48:29] through the trail of the serpent i
[48:30] preach this
[48:31] back in i'll find the date i actually
[48:33] preached it
[48:35] i remember jose was here i remember that
[48:36] night we had a good time in the lord
[48:38] that was july 5th 2017. so i'm not going
[48:41] to preach the whole thing i'm just going
[48:42] to read some quotes now there are six
[48:44] quotes on the trail of the serpent so
[48:46] remember now through iniquity iniquity
[48:48] means transgression it's a purposeful
[48:50] transgression
[48:52] in other words you're going against
[48:54] you're breaking god's word on purpose
[48:56] okay you know better but you're breaking
[48:59] it on purpose
[49:01] and there are six quotes on uh the
[49:03] workers of iniquity so we showed you how
[49:06] nick when he started in heaven come down
[49:07] to earth we showed you how it filled uh
[49:10] uh you know the serpent you know with
[49:12] satan and then cane seedline
[49:14] and how it starts in people's minds
[49:17] and uh the specific worker the works of
[49:20] iniquity in the workers of iniquity and
[49:22] then in this case now i go i just i just
[49:25] go a brief uh search of the bible in
[49:27] history showing the trail of the serpent
[49:30] now this phrase is actually from
[49:31] clarence larkin how many knew that
[49:33] did we know that brother ram didn't
[49:35] originate that that's clarence larkin
[49:38] claire's larkin has a chart and he shows
[49:39] a trail of the serpent from heaven uh
[49:42] down to gaga magog
[49:44] right uh uh yeah mega mega that's where
[49:46] satan gets cast into the lake of some
[49:48] beautiful charts but that's where
[49:50] brother ram got the trail of the serpent
[49:51] from
[49:53] now here let's read the quotes the first
[49:54] quote is from october 31st halloween 65
[50:00] he said now don't forget this little
[50:01] flock the church in the last days is
[50:03] going to be twins so close it'll deceive
[50:06] the elected matthew 24 24 the church is
[50:09] going to it's a pentecostal move
[50:12] yeah look at that church
[50:15] so the true church and the false church
[50:17] are going to have the holy spirit
[50:18] anointing
[50:20] and it's going to look like a move
[50:23] it's so much like the real thing to
[50:25] deceive the very elect if it were
[50:26] possible i want to explain what how the
[50:28] election comes see it's going to deceive
[50:30] them because it's almost like the same
[50:32] thing see just two fathers that's all
[50:35] same mother same church same movement
[50:36] same thing the betting ground is the
[50:38] same where the word falls but one of
[50:40] them like here is perverted
[50:43] oh church that's why please let's come
[50:45] to church every service and let's ask
[50:46] god to help us examine our ground and
[50:48] make sure there's no weeds in our ground
[50:51] let's do everything we can because he
[50:54] said one ground is right and one is
[50:56] perverted oh but the thing to do the
[50:59] blessing that we have is while we're
[51:00] alive we can make sure our ground is
[51:03] true and our ground is pure soil praise
[51:05] god
[51:07] that's what every service is for amen
[51:09] that's what every day is for amen to
[51:11] examine ourselves to make sure we have
[51:13] really pure grounds
[51:15] pure hearts we'd say
[51:20] i said see one of them is perversion one
[51:21] of them is the wrong father which i'll
[51:23] someday prove if god will let me that
[51:25] denomination is the mark of the beast
[51:28] see it's the wrong father he served
[51:30] people to an organization instead of the
[51:32] word see it's the wrong father it's a
[51:34] cane move
[51:36] oh my this is still the first quote when
[51:38] i go home i'm preaching on the subject
[51:40] the trail of the serpent the beast the
[51:42] beginning and the beast at the end and
[51:44] trail him right through the bible and
[51:45] show how he heads up the bible is going
[51:47] to show the beast satan at the beginning
[51:49] and the beast at the end the antichrist
[51:52] right and then gog and magog now that
[51:54] ends at the armageddon right
[51:56] that ends antichrist dies at armageddon
[51:59] but then the beast continues in satan
[52:02] for a thousand years he's he's locked up
[52:04] by chains of circumstance and the
[52:06] bottomless pit but then that beast rises
[52:08] again i'm talking about satan the beast
[52:11] he says now just watch how cunning this
[52:13] fellow is
[52:15] how he's just exactly well they're just
[52:17] like judas and jesus here both brothers
[52:19] in their tribe like esau and jacob like
[52:22] the crow and the dove sitting on the
[52:23] same roost and everything is a twin it's
[52:25] this great warfare we're in ah
[52:29] mercy church we are we're in a warfare
[52:32] and we're fighting against our twin
[52:35] so there in other words there's churches
[52:37] that preach just like us
[52:39] almost
[52:41] there's preachers that
[52:42] churches that sing just like us
[52:45] there's churches that have testimonies
[52:47] very similar to ours and it's so close
[52:50] but yet we've got a battle off the
[52:52] perversion of the hearts
[52:55] and their works will work iniquity in
[52:58] other words they'll purposely keep the
[53:00] defying the word of god but our works
[53:03] will be righteousness and godliness in
[53:06] this present world
[53:09] they'll be so close
[53:14] he says the enemy uses deception like he
[53:16] did to eve oh as god said
[53:19] and that's the first quote second quote
[53:22] november 27 trying to got a service
[53:27] he said now i'm talking to smart men he
[53:29] said they might look at my illiteracy
[53:31] illiteracy but believe i'm telling you
[53:32] the truth it's god telling you the truth
[53:34] see he said now when i speak of
[53:36] denominations i'm not meaning you to be
[53:38] so cruel and i don't mean for you not to
[53:40] go to your church go to your church what
[53:42] you're supposed to do but just don't
[53:44] join up with them organizations because
[53:46] one day i'll be telling you and prove it
[53:48] to you by scripture it's the mark of the
[53:50] beast and just remember it's the mark
[53:53] i'm preaching he said i wouldn't preach
[53:54] in brother jack's church he had to tell
[53:56] me go ahead and do it but i'm going to
[53:57] the tabernacle it'd be about four it'll
[53:59] be about four hours long he says
[54:01] and my subject is the beast at the
[54:03] beginning and the beast at the end
[54:04] through the trail of the serpent see
[54:06] takes about four hours i got my
[54:08] scriptures all laying out the beast from
[54:10] the beginning he was the beast at the
[54:12] garden of eden he's the beast at the end
[54:14] and show that he's a religious person
[54:16] and the denomination that made the
[54:17] denomination and come right through the
[54:19] trail of it and prove it to you by the
[54:21] scriptures that it is i don't know that
[54:24] till the holy spirit give it to me the
[54:26] other day up there
[54:28] so he's studying somewhere up there
[54:29] probably on a mountain and god showed
[54:31] him the beast in the beginning is the
[54:33] same beast at the end
[54:35] third quote
[54:40] is the from the evening service that
[54:42] same day he said to you up in new york
[54:44] and you that are around in ohio
[54:45] different places soon i want to preach
[54:47] this message of the trail of the serpent
[54:49] the beast at the beginning and the beast
[54:51] at the end at the tabernacle they said
[54:53] it's going to be four hours long fourth
[54:55] quote is
[54:57] december 6 1965.
[55:01] he says now what somebody else says but
[55:03] what god has promised and what god does
[55:06] proves that it's god doing his own
[55:07] interpreting of his word
[55:10] he says you mothers fathers when they
[55:11] were genuine pentecostals come out of
[55:13] organization and curse the thing and
[55:15] walked out of it then like a dog to its
[55:18] vomit there's that vomit again
[55:20] went right back to it again done the
[55:22] same thing that killed that church you
[55:24] killed your own by the same thing
[55:26] nothing against the people in there
[55:27] nothing against it it's the systems of
[55:29] the thing that's doing it
[55:31] he said i don't preach this in another
[55:33] man's meeting i'm going to preach the
[55:34] trail of the serpent and listen to it if
[55:36] you take the tapes and notice they miss
[55:38] seeing the confirmation of the
[55:40] prophecies of god's word being fulfilled
[55:44] amen oh the denominations miss the
[55:48] prophecies that are going to be
[55:49] fulfilled in this day praise god they
[55:52] miss luke 17 30 where the son of man is
[55:56] revealed at the coming of the lord in
[55:58] the days of light and as the days of
[56:00] sodom so shall it be in the end times
[56:03] they miss that they miss a seventh angel
[56:06] receiving an open book from heaven and
[56:09] then finishing the mystery of god and
[56:11] then john taking it around the world
[56:14] they miss that they miss elijah coming
[56:17] to restore all things but we receive it
[56:20] amen
[56:20] hallelujah they miss it they reject it
[56:23] how can they deny it the bible says over
[56:25] and over again elijah prepares that's
[56:27] john the baptist elijah prepares in
[56:29] isaiah 40 and matthew 3 but then there's
[56:32] another elijah elijah restores amen
[56:35] hallelujah he restores he reinstates the
[56:39] kingdom of god that's been rejected by
[56:41] laodicea
[56:46] see church what is it what does it all
[56:48] come down to the word what did brother
[56:49] brown say the last showdown is between
[56:51] the denominations and the word
[56:54] hallelujah we got the word that's one
[56:56] thing we got praise god we might not own
[56:59] any property we might not have uh big
[57:01] events and things like that but one
[57:03] thing we got one thing i know we got is
[57:05] the word amen we are the saith the lord
[57:08] we have the word amen
[57:11] that's one thing i know i got praise god
[57:15] i don't have i can't i don't have i
[57:16] don't have a former relationship with
[57:17] william branham i don't have uh any ties
[57:20] to any organization all i got is the
[57:22] holy ghost praise god that's all i got
[57:24] and the holy ghost guides me into the
[57:27] truth of god's word amen
[57:29] and you can tell if it is if i live the
[57:31] right kind of life
[57:33] because paul said i was reading i was
[57:34] listening to philippians 3 we'll get to
[57:35] that maybe lord willing tonight or later
[57:37] but he says everything you see and hear
[57:39] me do you do it
[57:41] how can you tell paul of the holy ghost
[57:43] well because he lived it
[57:45] and then he said you follow me you do
[57:46] what i do
[57:48] amen my that's really something
[57:52] the fifth quote i'm going to just go
[57:54] through these quickly
[57:57] but ram said uh the methodist
[58:00] uh don't because it wasn't associated
[58:02] with her organization she didn't want to
[58:03] hear it speaking of his message
[58:05] if that ain't a pharisee i never seen
[58:07] one
[58:08] wait to hear the trail of the serpent
[58:09] see now think that the denomination is
[58:11] the only one that registers with god god
[58:13] won't hear you unless you're a methodist
[58:15] or a baptist or trinidaire and he said
[58:17] that's wrong
[58:19] he said that's my purpose
[58:20] he says
[58:23] a p a desire in people's minds and heart
[58:26] to be right so he was going to preach
[58:28] this to show that the desires in the
[58:31] people's hearts they wanted to be right
[58:33] so if he showed the devil at the
[58:35] beginning and all the way down the
[58:36] people could recognize the devil right
[58:38] and they could make their hearts right
[58:40] and they could be in the truth
[58:42] i know it's simple
[58:44] and last quote was uh leadership is
[58:47] no communion was the last one this is
[58:48] the second the last sermon he ever
[58:50] preached leadership 65 december 7th
[58:55] he says now the next thing
[58:59] he's talking about lazarus
[59:01] the beggar the next thing he goes on
[59:03] successful like the like the churches
[59:05] today are getting so lazarus and the
[59:07] rich young ruler
[59:09] uh growing up a businessman sitting here
[59:11] telling me right in california that the
[59:13] church has to tell the labor union what
[59:15] to do see it's coming church and state
[59:17] again it's right on you you see you're
[59:20] right in there and you take the mark of
[59:22] the beast
[59:23] not knowing it
[59:25] if you ever bought one of my tapes get
[59:27] this and when i get it when i get home
[59:29] the trail of the serpent and you'll see
[59:31] where it's at see where this ends up now
[59:36] okay so can everybody see it
[59:38] the church so the the the trail of the
[59:40] serpent is all about the church and
[59:42] state uniting
[59:43] right
[59:44] because that's the beast now with the
[59:47] same power to kill that he had under all
[59:49] those other uh gentile kingdoms right
[59:52] babylon
[59:53] medes of persians uh greece rome right
[59:56] ancient rome but now it's modern rome
[59:58] it's spiritual rome it's the unholy
[1:00:01] roman catholic church
[1:00:02] all right
[1:00:03] so that roman this roman system at the
[1:00:05] end time is going to get the same power
[1:00:08] right that they had in ancient rome
[1:00:11] and that's thus saith the lord
[1:00:13] you believe that
[1:00:14] now let's go through some examples here
[1:00:18] so satan closely observes
[1:00:22] and
[1:00:23] imitates the true believer's behavior in
[1:00:25] order to deceive the masses
[1:00:30] satan is producing a spiritual twin that
[1:00:32] is so much like you and i but yet so far
[1:00:35] away
[1:00:37] is that right
[1:00:38] it's so close
[1:00:40] but then it's so far away because they
[1:00:41] don't have the seal of god in their
[1:00:43] souls
[1:00:45] jesus gives two proofs on the battle of
[1:00:47] the twins this is a battle twins have
[1:00:49] been battling ever since the beginning
[1:00:52] we start with the wheat and tares in
[1:00:53] matthew 13. tares are poisonous to eat
[1:00:56] and they look like a wee except the only
[1:00:59] thing they don't do they do not bow at
[1:01:01] harvest time so will no tares because
[1:01:04] they defy and hate the word of god amen
[1:01:11] and they will the tares will be right
[1:01:13] along the wheat right they'll be right
[1:01:14] there by the wheat blowing in the wind
[1:01:17] right and they'll be hanging around
[1:01:19] until uh they're gathered together
[1:01:21] remember the tariffs have to be bumbled
[1:01:23] together right
[1:01:24] they got that's what they're doing now
[1:01:26] they're bundling in their groups
[1:01:27] together but the the wheat have to sit
[1:01:30] there and bow in the presence of the sun
[1:01:33] praise god
[1:01:34] but church they hate remember jesus said
[1:01:36] in matthew i'm sorry john chapter 3 for
[1:01:38] god so loved the world
[1:01:40] he said the reason people are condemned
[1:01:42] is because they loved darkness and hated
[1:01:45] the light praise god
[1:01:47] oh we
[1:01:48] we must rejoice in the light of god's
[1:01:51] word
[1:01:52] amen
[1:01:53] let's hate our sin amen let's not hate
[1:01:57] others let's hate our sin praise god
[1:02:00] a real christian should be very plain to
[1:02:02] see that they don't so much hate other
[1:02:04] people they hate the sin they hate their
[1:02:07] flesh desires that overcome them at
[1:02:09] times like paul said that what i hate
[1:02:12] that's what i do watch where people's
[1:02:14] hate is directed that tells which of the
[1:02:16] twins they are
[1:02:22] so they defy the word they fail to obey
[1:02:25] god's simple plain word
[1:02:27] because their hearts are perverted it's
[1:02:29] a different kind of ground
[1:02:31] it's not a true ground and then in
[1:02:34] matthew 24 24 we can almost say that by
[1:02:37] heart right for there shall rise false
[1:02:39] christs and false prophets and shall
[1:02:40] show great signs and wonders in so much
[1:02:42] that if it were possible they shall
[1:02:44] deceive the very elected the false
[1:02:46] christs are temporarily anointed with
[1:02:49] the holy spirit but then they teach
[1:02:51] heresy later on and they go into
[1:02:54] iniquity which is sin loving lives
[1:02:57] now paul says in first corinthians 11 19
[1:03:00] can you pull that up there kaisha first
[1:03:02] corinthians 11 19.
[1:03:05] you know some people get discouraged
[1:03:06] brother jesse you know or brother simon
[1:03:09] or brother brooks why there are so many
[1:03:10] uh why is there so much division in the
[1:03:12] message it has to be that way listen we
[1:03:16] should expect that
[1:03:18] praise god
[1:03:19] because there has to be twins there's
[1:03:22] always been twins so don't get
[1:03:24] discouraged if you hear about people
[1:03:25] falling away or heresy be concerned that
[1:03:28] we are keeping god's word
[1:03:31] praise god because first corinthians
[1:03:34] 11 19 said there there must also be
[1:03:38] heresies among you don't be discouraged
[1:03:41] when someone rises up like like happened
[1:03:43] last year where someone tries to bring a
[1:03:44] heresy in our church
[1:03:46] it's going to happen among you
[1:03:48] among you that they which are approved
[1:03:51] may be made manifest among you amen so
[1:03:55] doctrinal battles have to come so we
[1:03:58] know which side the twins are on amen
[1:04:00] and that we can get on the right side
[1:04:02] praise god
[1:04:04] it's going to be among you praise god
[1:04:06] it's going to be among us
[1:04:10] so what do we do just keep preaching the
[1:04:11] truth service after service just keep
[1:04:13] your shoulder to the wheel just keep
[1:04:16] that yoke of the holy spirit just keep
[1:04:18] pushing with the truth keep pushing the
[1:04:20] truth don't try to make it some
[1:04:21] sensational thing it is sensational to
[1:04:23] the soul praise god it is sensational to
[1:04:26] the real believer but don't get outside
[1:04:28] the word and don't teach a heresy just
[1:04:30] say right with a plain simple word it
[1:04:32] will keep revealing itself amen
[1:04:36] that's in the philippians 3 we'll get to
[1:04:37] that maybe tonight paul said even if you
[1:04:39] don't have it now god will reveal it to
[1:04:41] you amen
[1:04:42] paul said if you don't have whatever
[1:04:44] revelation you're going to need it's
[1:04:46] going to come amen
[1:04:48] it's going to come praise god like the
[1:04:50] former latter reign all these things
[1:04:52] we're looking for you know the daniel 70
[1:04:54] weeks all these things maybe we might
[1:04:55] may not understand right away but if we
[1:04:58] keep saying faithful god will reveal
[1:05:00] more truth and it'll be exactly what we
[1:05:02] need
[1:05:05] we just can't get laodicean right we
[1:05:07] can't be lukewarm
[1:05:09] because that's what that's what is real
[1:05:10] that's whatever that's what that's what
[1:05:12] they're doing
[1:05:13] that that's they're spew they don't
[1:05:14] speak for god anymore i'm glad i just
[1:05:16] had somebody email me another person
[1:05:17] this week two people saying oh i love
[1:05:19] your sermons i'm really growing can you
[1:05:21] send me scriptures and quotes just all
[1:05:23] around the world church
[1:05:24] see people and people said i needed that
[1:05:26] i've been hungry for that i just wanted
[1:05:28] to hear truth so see church we might be
[1:05:30] small but we're having a bigger impact
[1:05:32] than maybe we thought praise god
[1:05:34] people around the world want to hear
[1:05:36] truth so god made a way that they can
[1:05:38] hear it praise god
[1:05:40] amen
[1:05:41] it's a different age praise god it's
[1:05:43] knowledge is increased
[1:05:45] daniel 12 4 says
[1:05:48] see only the elect children of god will
[1:05:50] not be deceived about 10 minutes
[1:05:53] watch that serpent slither from heaven
[1:05:55] he slithered from heaven down to the
[1:05:57] garden
[1:05:58] the first set of twins were lucifer and
[1:06:01] michael
[1:06:02] both exalted both worshipped until satan
[1:06:04] split the church
[1:06:07] and then on earth the first set of twins
[1:06:09] was the tree of life
[1:06:11] and the tree of knowledge and good and
[1:06:12] evil
[1:06:14] both twins brother ram said christ was
[1:06:16] the tree of life so that means the tree
[1:06:17] of knowledge had to be satan
[1:06:20] who is the next set now this is my
[1:06:22] thought this could be wrong my the next
[1:06:24] set of twins was when those two
[1:06:27] moved to flesh adam and the serpent
[1:06:29] because eve had to choose which one is
[1:06:30] she gonna do which one is she gonna do
[1:06:32] there's twins there well my husband said
[1:06:34] this but the serpent said this remember
[1:06:36] god said later because you've done this
[1:06:38] now your desire will be for your husband
[1:06:41] so she had two choices there
[1:06:43] now that's my thought i could be wrong
[1:06:44] on that
[1:06:45] next we know the twins obviously cain
[1:06:47] and abel
[1:06:48] right
[1:06:50] both worshipping one got jealous and
[1:06:52] killed the other
[1:06:55] the next set of twins is ham and shem
[1:06:59] right
[1:07:00] because ham gets cursed something with
[1:07:03] his father's nakedness
[1:07:06] i don't know if he like laughed his dad
[1:07:07] naked after he got drunk or if he saw if
[1:07:09] his father's nakedness was his mother's
[1:07:11] nakedness i'm not sure what i'm not sure
[1:07:14] which one it is did he sleep with his
[1:07:15] mom i'm not sure because that's that
[1:07:17] that that phrase can mean sleeping with
[1:07:19] someone's
[1:07:20] uncovering their nakedness can be
[1:07:22] another word for adultery another phrase
[1:07:24] for adultery so i'm not sure exactly
[1:07:26] what ham did but whenever he did he was
[1:07:29] cursed with the nakedness
[1:07:33] but shem out of shem came the father of
[1:07:35] the faith abraham
[1:07:37] praise god amen out of the twins came
[1:07:40] forth both sets
[1:07:42] out out of abraham then came the twins
[1:07:45] again esau and jacob
[1:07:49] esau profanes god by not wanting the
[1:07:52] firstborn rights he didn't want to be a
[1:07:54] spiritual leader may god help our
[1:07:56] brothers to step up and be spiritual
[1:07:57] leaders if you haven't already may god
[1:07:59] help our brothers to be leaders amen and
[1:08:02] take responsibility not let somebody
[1:08:04] else do it but brothers do it praise god
[1:08:07] take because esau didn't want that he
[1:08:09] didn't want to be the head of the the
[1:08:11] religious aspect he just wanted to go
[1:08:13] off and hunt and marry a wife and of
[1:08:15] course he did
[1:08:17] but he the bible said he forsook he
[1:08:19] profaned god
[1:08:21] but jacob's like yeah i'll do anything
[1:08:22] to be in that in that messiah family
[1:08:25] that's what we should say i'll do
[1:08:26] anything to go in the rapture praise god
[1:08:29] now we don't want to sin of course and
[1:08:30] god won't lead us into sin but we should
[1:08:32] be willing to lay down any weight of sin
[1:08:35] that death but easily beset us and run
[1:08:37] the race for christ
[1:08:43] and then moses battled he had a bunch of
[1:08:45] twins things he had a bunch of twins
[1:08:49] he had janice
[1:08:51] is doing supernatural right balaam cora
[1:08:54] and jason brother bam says
[1:08:56] get a lot of twins to battle off there
[1:09:01] balaam proved he was a terror when he
[1:09:02] taught israel to commit fornication
[1:09:05] and he went against the perfect will of
[1:09:06] god god said don't go he said he said oh
[1:09:08] come on could i go god said go
[1:09:11] like brother man i said i he brother man
[1:09:13] doesn't doubt god told women to preach
[1:09:14] the gospel he said but that wasn't the
[1:09:16] first word that god told her
[1:09:19] if a woman says god called me to preach
[1:09:21] say okay amen but that wasn't the first
[1:09:23] thing god told you
[1:09:25] amen praise god amen
[1:09:28] brother said it's god will give you your
[1:09:30] heart's desire let's make sure our
[1:09:32] hearts are pure praise god
[1:09:35] he's going to give you hearts desire
[1:09:36] whatever you want let's make sure we
[1:09:39] what god wants amen
[1:09:40] let's make sure we're modern day david's
[1:09:43] the bride after the heart of our husband
[1:09:45] jesus
[1:09:48] i feel like preaching today praise god
[1:09:50] hallelujah
[1:09:52] he lured 24 000 into committing sexual
[1:09:55] sin proved he was a terror
[1:10:00] aiken he showed his tare nature by
[1:10:03] lustfully harboring forbidden treasures
[1:10:06] while trying to dwell amongst the
[1:10:07] victorious army see they were just happy
[1:10:10] getting the victory but he's like well i
[1:10:11] gotta physically gain more than them i
[1:10:13] deserve more than them i deserve nicer
[1:10:16] clothes now look at that church
[1:10:18] i deserve nicer clothes i deserve more
[1:10:20] gold and yeah we're all getting the
[1:10:21] victory you guys enjoy the victory i'm
[1:10:23] gonna enjoy the financial things
[1:10:25] that's a terror
[1:10:31] then the serpent slithered into
[1:10:35] my kaya's time 897 bc
[1:10:39] i couldn't find i was trying to think of
[1:10:41] who was you know david and
[1:10:42] solomon i couldn't really think of many
[1:10:44] but micaiah surely had twins he had 400
[1:10:47] twins
[1:10:48] the man said there were 400 hebrew
[1:10:50] prophets are you with me church
[1:10:53] anointed with the lying spirit
[1:10:58] and what he had to do what do you have
[1:11:00] to say he said all i can do is say what
[1:11:01] the previous prophet elijah said
[1:11:04] he had to stay with the word
[1:11:07] and look that foolish virgin
[1:11:09] there jehoshaphat what he felt something
[1:11:11] a little off thank god thank god church
[1:11:14] that even someone who won't go all the
[1:11:15] way they can still have a little bit of
[1:11:18] sensitive sensitivity to the holy spirit
[1:11:20] oh something just doesn't seem right
[1:11:21] here some this
[1:11:23] is there anybody else that would preach
[1:11:24] anybody else because these these 400
[1:11:26] preachers don't they just don't feel
[1:11:28] right they god amen
[1:11:31] now look at
[1:11:35] 400 years later around 598
[1:11:38] hananiah was the twin to jeremiah
[1:11:42] hannah and i was way more hollywood
[1:11:44] evangelism he remember he made that uh
[1:11:46] he made that wooden uh he made that
[1:11:48] wooden uh was it yoke right he made a
[1:11:51] wooden yoke he said thus saith the lord
[1:11:53] israel will come back out of babylon in
[1:11:55] two years and jeremiah took that thing
[1:11:57] and thrown it down he said it'll be 70.
[1:12:00] hallelujah
[1:12:02] glory twins both of them saying look
[1:12:05] look at me look at me
[1:12:07] and jeremiah said that's fine you can
[1:12:08] prophesy whatever you want he said but
[1:12:10] god will prove who was right
[1:12:13] and han and i had died that same year
[1:12:16] look at that twins both men prophesying
[1:12:18] both men but who was more dramatic and
[1:12:20] more hollywood
[1:12:22] it was that that was that tear seed
[1:12:26] right the tears more dramatic and more
[1:12:29] hollywood and
[1:12:30] prophesying but off the word
[1:12:38] so that was 400 years later that takes
[1:12:39] us about 600
[1:12:41] bc and then where was satan satan rose
[1:12:43] up against joshua the high priest when
[1:12:45] they were rebuilding the uh the wall in
[1:12:48] jerusalem
[1:12:50] with nehemiah remember zechariah 3 verse
[1:12:53] 1 joshua had a vision where zechariah
[1:12:55] had a vision he shared with joshua and
[1:12:56] joshua the high priest is standing there
[1:12:58] and satan rose up against him to fight
[1:13:00] him and the angel lord rebuke satan and
[1:13:04] god said i'm taking away your filthy
[1:13:06] garments i'm giving you clean garments
[1:13:09] praise god they were saying satan was
[1:13:11] trying
[1:13:12] to hinder nehemiah from building the
[1:13:15] wall they were such faithful workers
[1:13:17] working and battling at the same time
[1:13:19] building and fighting at the same time
[1:13:21] let's build the kingdom of god let's
[1:13:23] fight off the enemies at the same time
[1:13:26] praise god
[1:13:27] hallelujah
[1:13:29] that's what i'm doing to build the
[1:13:31] church of god i'm going to build the
[1:13:32] kingdom of god but i also want to fight
[1:13:34] off every mind battle that comes my way
[1:13:36] i can do it at the same time brother
[1:13:37] bang
[1:13:38] i can encourage but amen with this text
[1:13:41] and i can uh email that brother with the
[1:13:43] email with correcting him and fighting
[1:13:44] him off with his false doctrine like
[1:13:46] yesterday
[1:13:48] numerous people trying to tell me that
[1:13:49] the saturday's the sabbath day so i'm
[1:13:52] encouraging brother van over here
[1:13:54] encouraging
[1:13:55] uh
[1:13:56] sister so-and-so but then i'm fighting
[1:13:57] off the unbelievers over there that we
[1:13:59] will not compromise on one word we'll
[1:14:02] live by every word that proceeds out of
[1:14:04] the mouth of god
[1:14:09] that was 500 bc fast forward
[1:14:11] to john the baptist
[1:14:14] john rebukes the generation of vipers
[1:14:17] pharisees and sadducees who attend now
[1:14:20] listen they attended his services but
[1:14:22] they refused to be baptized
[1:14:25] now remember that was the light of the
[1:14:26] hour let me know that to be a real true
[1:14:29] believer in john's 8 you actually had to
[1:14:30] get baptized in water but the pharisees
[1:14:33] would come sit in the back everybody
[1:14:35] could tell they were the dress nicest
[1:14:37] they were the richest but yet they
[1:14:39] wouldn't go all the way and be baptized
[1:14:41] in water
[1:14:42] there's my 40 minutes let me give me
[1:14:44] five here
[1:14:46] and i went fast
[1:14:49] so satan slithered right into the true
[1:14:51] church but he wouldn't go all the way
[1:14:53] into john's baptism
[1:14:56] now we know judas did get baptized at
[1:14:57] first right
[1:14:58] he started with his sincere heart but
[1:15:00] then he backs it later and satan filled
[1:15:02] his heart
[1:15:03] so we couldn't say well judas wasn't
[1:15:05] baptized he was baptized the bible said
[1:15:07] jesus his disciples baptized everybody
[1:15:09] in john 4 1-3
[1:15:13] so in the same manner then in jesus
[1:15:16] ministry we have the same generation of
[1:15:18] vipers jesus says you're serpents you
[1:15:21] generation of vipers look at this trail
[1:15:23] of the serpents all the way down what
[1:15:25] are they against the manifested word of
[1:15:27] the hour amen
[1:15:29] they're always against god's word for
[1:15:31] the hour
[1:15:37] let me stop with this one go to john 5
[1:15:39] here we'll close with this one here
[1:15:46] so in dealing with the believe the sign
[1:15:48] folks which i want to show respect i
[1:15:50] appreciate their sincerity i appreciate
[1:15:52] uh
[1:15:54] yeah i just i say that i appreciate
[1:15:55] their sincerity
[1:15:58] um
[1:16:00] you come across the scriptures here
[1:16:06] look at verse 33 john 5 33
[1:16:09] so one thing they really don't like is
[1:16:10] uh first john 1 7 that says walk in the
[1:16:13] light as he is in the light and the
[1:16:14] blood of jesus christ cleanses you from
[1:16:16] all unrighteousness right brother and
[1:16:18] uses that to say you must walk in the
[1:16:19] light of your hour which we can see oh
[1:16:21] that's plain but they can't see that
[1:16:24] now here's where it's proven this is
[1:16:26] what i'm emailing the brother verse 33
[1:16:28] yes unto john and he bear witness unto
[1:16:30] the truth
[1:16:31] but i receive not testimony from man
[1:16:34] but those things i say that you might be
[1:16:37] saved
[1:16:38] look at john he was a burning
[1:16:41] and a shining what was he a light now
[1:16:44] how long did his light last church
[1:16:47] and ye were willing for a season
[1:16:50] to rejoice
[1:16:52] in his light and the church said amen
[1:16:56] john was a light his ministry was a
[1:16:59] light and they had the pharisees
[1:17:01] wouldn't walk in his life but thank god
[1:17:04] there was people that would walk in his
[1:17:05] light amen
[1:17:07] but it wasn't the light didn't last
[1:17:08] forever it was a light for a short
[1:17:11] season
[1:17:12] see that
[1:17:15] and you know just fast forward to
[1:17:16] pentecost no longer was it just water
[1:17:18] baptism now it's holy ghost fire
[1:17:22] johnson i'll baptize you with water but
[1:17:24] there's one coming after me mightier
[1:17:27] than me he'll baptize you with the holy
[1:17:29] ghost and with fire
[1:17:31] amen
[1:17:33] and then fast forward to ephesians the
[1:17:35] church in ephesus and acts 19 acts 19
[1:17:38] 1-7 paul says what were you he said do
[1:17:41] you have the holy ghost he said we
[1:17:42] didn't even know whether there was a
[1:17:43] holy ghost what baptism you have john's
[1:17:45] baptism see the light was already gone
[1:17:47] for that season they were living on a
[1:17:49] light that was a dimming out light
[1:17:53] paul said well there's a greater light
[1:17:54] sir
[1:17:56] he said you need to repent and be
[1:17:57] baptized in jesus christ's name they
[1:17:59] said praise the lord in other words they
[1:18:02] saw how dim their light was it was going
[1:18:04] out and then they saw how bright paul's
[1:18:06] light was
[1:18:07] oh church can you see how bright brother
[1:18:10] graham's light is for this day can you
[1:18:12] see the light that he held up and now
[1:18:14] he's off the scene but what the spirit
[1:18:16] and the bride the bride you and i are
[1:18:19] holding forth the light of the hour
[1:18:21] praise god
[1:18:22] amen brother graham's light was the
[1:18:24] former light glory the former rain the
[1:18:28] teaching raid which we're rejoicing in
[1:18:30] praise god but there's gonna come a
[1:18:32] final reign a final right rapturing
[1:18:35] faith amen
[1:18:36] that's the end of our feet praise god
[1:18:42] they could rejoice in his light for a
[1:18:45] season
[1:18:47] now if that don't prove it then church
[1:18:49] then we can't leave the sign people then
[1:18:51] we can't help jeffersonville if they
[1:18:53] can't see brother braham calling billy
[1:18:55] paul joseph in 1951 billy paul's my
[1:18:57] joseph if they can't see that that's not

[1:19:04] can do but church if we can't admit the
[1:19:07] simple truth of god's word then we've

[1:19:10] rejoice that we've tried
[1:19:13] we can rejoice that we've labored
[1:19:16] and we've done our part to try to help
