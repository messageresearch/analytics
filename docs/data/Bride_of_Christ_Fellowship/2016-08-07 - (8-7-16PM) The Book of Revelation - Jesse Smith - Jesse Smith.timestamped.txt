[26:11] I thought this quote about revelation
[26:14] will get to but really really jumped out
[26:16] at me and it's really quite striking so
[26:18] I want to start here and then start with
[26:22] some quotes and then some scriptures
[26:25] about just over overall like a review
[26:27] about the book of Revelation here as the
[26:30] prophet of God would teach us here I
[26:32] God's grace Oh revelation 13 while we
[26:35] read that together since we got on the
[26:36] screen there one two three blessed is he
[26:39] that readeth and they they hear the

[27:32] their sister to mull not let alone us up
[27:34] here yeah if you'd like to switch it
[27:36] over on as these phones are here I
[27:37] really want to show these quotes okay
[27:40] praise God and trustee of lessee is you
[27:48] know I run over the church age book I
[27:49] think a couple times that I never quite
[27:51] had seen these quotes like this here so
[27:56] I want to start with that move on here
[28:03] sorry not coming up okay let's try this
[28:08] let me try the other device here and see
[28:10] if that works so the book of Revelation
[28:12] a powerful powerful book and brother
[28:17] Gabe preach at last week I was so struck
[28:18] struck when he said that he's like you
[28:21] know I used to be scared of the book of
[28:22] Revelation so was I for a while but then
[28:25] you know as you grow in grace is now to
[28:26] the Lord and you hear the word of God
[28:27] know then God takes away all your fear
[28:30] you know the last few years you know
[28:32] God's really opened it up to me where I
[28:34] feel like I understand it of course
[28:35] through the prophets revelation and so
[28:37] forth okay praise God alright that
[28:40] worked out pretty good I found that nice
[28:42] little picture out of here that oaks
[28:43] like that that's you that's us we're
[28:46] behind Christ these people can catch a
[28:48] really good inspiration can take I think
[28:51] it's pretty tremendous other cuts his
[28:52] inspiration but the person at the Battle
[28:55] of Armageddon as you know so for like
[28:58] that but let's look at this here and
[28:59] brother branham says some tremendous
[29:01] things I just want to take this thought
[29:03] tonight overall thought about brother
[29:06] branham says the book of Revelation
[29:08] gives you authority over Satan just this
[29:12] simple little thought and I just had
[29:14] never read that in a few years it seems
[29:16] like and it just blew my blew my mind
[29:19] away and it really humbled me I thought
[29:22] thank God that we're returning to this
[29:24] praise God the Bible of course the whole
[29:27] books been open the mystery the seven
[29:28] seals have been loosed off the books
[29:30] spiritually and the revelation has been
[29:32] sent down but it's such a good reminder
[29:34] here tonight so let's look at this as
[29:36] we'll see it so let's look here I'm
[29:39] going to start with the quote so you
[29:40] might just want to watch the screen and
[29:43] be blessed by a lot of these quotations
[29:45] cover and start with this quote I was so
[29:46] blessed by it it kind of give me like a
[29:48] whole new vision a whole new way to look
[29:51] at the book of Revelation I love you now
[29:54] progress and I said that the book of
[29:56] Revelation is the revelation of Jesus
[29:58] and what he's doing in the churches for
[30:00] those seven ages it is a revelation
[30:03] because the disciples themselves didn't
[30:05] know these recorded troops right most of
[30:07] the ciples died before John wrote the
[30:09] book of Revelation 89 use the cycle that
[30:12] live the longest according to history
[30:13] right of course so Thomas went the
[30:15] furthest provide by a distance and so
[30:19] forth but John did the longest so this
[30:21] is a revelation that program tells us
[30:23] Jesus keeping kept from his disciples
[30:25] but Ramsey they had not been previously
[30:27] revealed to the hem you remember that
[30:28] they came to Jesus in the book of Acts
[30:30] NESN are you at this time to restore the
[30:32] king of Israel and he said it is not for
[30:34] you to know the times or seasons oh my
[30:37] those that were still thinking of Jesus
[30:40] having an earthly Kingdom wow so God
[30:42] that is bright of that name just
[30:44] continue thinking that's not for you to
[30:45] know you have to wait on that but he
[30:48] says it was a spiritual Kingdom he was
[30:50] going to build and even he could not
[30:51] tell them about his place in it for the
[30:54] father not reviewed it on the hitter but
[30:56] now after is that the resurrection on
[30:58] this particular time in his mediatorial
[31:01] ministry he's able to set forth herein
[31:03] this revelation of himself to chart this
[31:05] is when his glory and presence in the
[31:08] church would mean to the people and do
[31:11] praise God so how fast is that what is
[31:14] the friends of God being for us to
[31:16] tonight it means everything amen having
[31:19] his presence which is his power his
[31:20] spirit here means everything to us amen
[31:24] yeah and what would it do is glory let's
[31:29] see what his spirit would do in the
[31:30] churches all right that's what the book
[31:32] of Revelation is about now most of us
[31:33] know if you know the seven seals in the
[31:35] seven church ages
[31:36] most of us know what he did it through
[31:38] that okay but what I have to review it
[31:40] but I just want to us let's keep my own
[31:42] this stock here in this revelation he
[31:45] tells us what the end of the devil is
[31:48] one of the brothers and speakers tell me
[31:50] not that also one of the brothers tell
[31:52] me how he's so fearful to go to hell not
[31:54] I got a text in this brother but the
[31:56] thought came to me someone if seconds
[31:59] making you afraid to go to hell tell
[32:00] them I'm not going to take the fear that
[32:02] you live with right because say it has
[32:05] to live with that fear Satan lives with
[32:07] the fear to go to hell you can we can
[32:09] tell Satan Satan I'm not going to take
[32:10] your fear because God doesn't give me
[32:12] the spirit of fear God gives me the
[32:14] power of love and of a sound mind right
[32:16] just turn right right back about
[32:18] whatever Satan's tell you just sort of
[32:19] right back around and my headaches gone
[32:21] by God's grace oh thank you Jesus amen
[32:23] hallelujah he tells us how is he going
[32:26] to deal with the devil and passing lake
[32:28] of fire he reveals the end of the wicked
[32:30] ones who follow Satan and Satan hates
[32:33] that Satan hates took for the people to
[32:37] remind him about where he's going right
[32:40] he hates it so brother BAM tells of the
[32:42] chapter a lot about was Satan hates
[32:43] we're going to look at that because he
[32:45] hates revelation and he hates the
[32:47] revealing of God's Word all right have
[32:50] you ever noticed how Satan hates two
[32:52] books the Bible more than all the others
[32:54] through though I'm sorry through liberal
[32:57] theologians and pseudo-scientists he's
[32:59] always attacking the book of Genesis and
[33:01] the book of Revelation and both these
[33:04] books we find Satan's origin is awful
[33:06] wings and his destruction now what were
[33:10] concerned about right now is his offer
[33:12] ways are we not because we you know will
[33:17] be there when he has his destruction
[33:18] right after got a guy he's tossing
[33:20] laying the fire those thousand years
[33:22] he's released i found will see that but
[33:24] what were most concerned about is we can
[33:26] live about his awful reception right now
[33:28] the church said that's what we need to
[33:30] but we need to be concerned about we to
[33:32] understand i might have said I've if
[33:34] you're in a war you don't need to
[33:36] understand the tactics of war praise God
[33:38] and to understand i was saying he's
[33:39] going to value invite you so you can buy
[33:42] them back it's just like a book on us
[33:44] and put off we would study the team all
[33:46] week and if you study hard enough you
[33:48] can pick up their tendency
[33:50] and then make amazing place I never
[33:52] remember one of these about guys on my
[33:54] team studied the place all week he was
[33:55] like living in the end up in the room
[33:57] and we were playing some big team that
[34:00] was really good i think it was Wisconsin
[34:01] or Marshall or somebody that was
[34:02] nationally ranked and he noticed he
[34:05] studied his enemy so well and he noticed
[34:07] their formation and when as soon as the
[34:09] ball was out he stepped right out
[34:11] because it was like a quick pass he
[34:12] stepped out intercepted it was like the
[34:14] passwords to him it took it for a
[34:15] touchdown and the whole crowd goes wild
[34:17] you know but I some how did you know
[34:20] they're good at least I studied the
[34:21] tapes as though i wish i would have said
[34:22] any more i wasn't interested in studying
[34:25] those as much as I was the Word of God
[34:26] back in those days but what a good
[34:29] illustration is when you study the Word
[34:32] of God enough right and know the Word of
[34:34] God you can throw your entity so well
[34:36] that when he comes to trick yup you
[34:38] already got the answer for I program
[34:40] said Christ the mystery revealed we got
[34:43] the answer for the devil's that right
[34:45] yeah so that's right he has awful ways
[34:49] and we must be concerned about that now
[34:51] but the book of Revelation tells us how
[34:53] to overcome them so that is why I Satan
[34:56] attacks those two books who hates
[34:58] Genesis and revelation as his beginning
[35:00] as ending he hates to be exposed and in
[35:03] those books he's exposed for exactly
[35:05] what he is what does expose me exposed
[35:10] before the Webster's mean you're not
[35:12] covered or protected and it also means
[35:16] open to view Satan hates to the open to
[35:20] view he hates to be detected right
[35:24] praise the Lord he hates for people to
[35:27] know that he's around so those same
[35:29] horse was like we were talking about at
[35:31] the same Bible and that's not where
[35:34] Satan puts most of his energy he puts
[35:36] most of his energy trying to deceive
[35:38] God's people that right say it hates to
[35:43] be exposed so see that's why all that
[35:44] young let's take worst 40 certainly
[35:47] having power darkness was say he's
[35:48] really not trying there he's not putting
[35:50] his efforts there but Madison as soon as
[35:52] you say y'all he go she points all his
[35:54] guns right it does that right so he
[35:57] loves to be hidden and not appeal people
[36:00] not know he's there what a coward
[36:03] he's a squatter right brother sees a
[36:05] squatter what a collar he is he loves to
[36:09] be hidden and undetected he loves to the
[36:13] sea now I said it my prayer murder
[36:15] because I know where I was going with my
[36:16] notes God glories in hiding himself but
[36:19] only because he loves to reveal himself
[36:22] Olivia only because he loves the power
[36:25] of Revelation amen at the experience of
[36:28] Revelation Bible said he know it's an
[36:30] honor of King to search out the mystery
[36:32] of God God loves to be sought after
[36:34] right and he but he's the one trawling
[36:35] us right I won't deceive us in your
[36:38] drawers and the nachos God is drawing us
[36:41] so we'll know hit her love him an
[36:42] understanding but Satan hates to be a
[36:46] brought to view he hates to be uncovered
[36:49] he loves to be undetected so that's what
[36:53] we wrote sakes being exposed for exactly
[36:55] what is what exactly is safe is that
[36:58] thought Kaimuki to my mind and some
[37:00] scripture started floating to my mind
[37:02] like John 844 you have your father the
[37:04] devil and the lusts of your father you
[37:06] will do so the devil is a lustful fallen
[37:10] angel lustful that means pleasures right
[37:14] for lighting lustful is a forbidden
[37:15] craving so he has these cravings for
[37:18] things that are forbidden and he's
[37:20] constantly give himself over to those
[37:22] things he was a murderer from the
[37:25] beginning and abode not the truth
[37:27] because there's no truth in and when he
[37:29] speak of the lies because of his own for
[37:31] he is a liar and the father of it this
[37:35] is what my favorite i love the scripture
[37:37] this is after he says he rebukes Peter
[37:39] but he turned said to Peter get thee
[37:42] behind me Satan now we're going to fence
[37:45] unto me now that means that offense
[37:46] speeds of stumbling if you look up
[37:48] something stone so Peter was anointed of
[37:51] the devil to say Jesus do don't have to
[37:53] go to calorie surely you're not going to
[37:55] dial or surety and that was a stumbling
[37:57] block to Jesus right it was trying to
[38:00] discourage him from doing the will of
[38:01] God so Jesus looks at him as like this
[38:04] looks through him right not if he'd
[38:06] about the spirit anointed him right and
[38:08] he said Satan get thee behind me thou
[38:11] art offense you're trying to make me
[38:13] stumble to do the will of God for thou
[38:15] savers
[38:16] things that be of God but those that be
[38:19] a man now the word saver I just looked
[38:21] at this this was the one that made the
[38:22] most sense to me intensively to interest
[38:26] oneself in so he is not savoring the
[38:29] things of God say it doesn't get
[38:31] intensely interested in the plan of God
[38:33] ER in the ways of God he wants his ways
[38:36] and he does not set the infection on the
[38:41] things of God according to Jesus that's
[38:43] why we to make the Word of God and
[38:45] hearing servants and praying in church
[38:46] attendance and special meeting
[38:48] attendance right way to make that are
[38:50] our highest law or highest joy I'll say
[38:53] it like that let God be what you set
[38:56] your affection on a man like I said that
[38:58] sweats it make wednesday night the
[39:00] highlight of your week on make Sunday
[39:02] both services the highlight of your
[39:04] sunday yes it is amen because we are
[39:08] being filled with righteousness as we
[39:10] speak if we're receiving the words of
[39:12] God we've been training and receiving
[39:14] words of life and receiving seeds that
[39:17] water those they'll produce godly fruit
[39:19] in our lives amen so what exactly is say
[39:22] to me he's a disinterested in God in His
[39:25] Word Satan is love so for his own
[39:28] pleasures the man says is exposed for
[39:31] exactly what it is in the book of
[39:33] Revelation he's a murderer a hater of
[39:36] others lives he likes his life but I
[39:38] said he hates other people's lives he's
[39:41] a liar he hates truth he's one who will
[39:45] not speak God's Word or he'll give like
[39:48] ninety-nine percent of it right and then
[39:50] deceive you on the one percent but he
[39:52] won't tell the full truth that means the
[39:54] full truth one who cannot remain or live
[39:57] in the truth ordained for complete
[40:00] torment and annihilation in Jesus Christ
[40:02] exactly the opposite amen he is
[40:05] interested in God's Word where he is the
[40:07] Word made flesh he's only desiring the
[40:10] pleasures of the Lord he's a giver of
[40:12] life amen and he gave his life for
[40:15] others he's a teller of truth lover of
[40:17] truth he's one that only spoke the Word
[40:19] of God he's one that abode and truth the
[40:22] Bible said and he's ordained for eternal
[40:24] life andrew Lee program on the air amen
[40:27] nvidia
[40:29] it that beautiful now that he says in
[40:31] the church ebook I'm continue the same
[40:33] quote jesus said it out Satan this
[40:35] chapter one he has no part of me and I
[40:39] have no part in him a man i love that
[40:41] Olivia was let's take all of our parts
[40:45] Christ the word the devil would like to
[40:47] prove that everybody can not so he does
[40:49] all I can do to destroy the our
[40:51] confidence of the word of God praise God
[40:54] loves have confidence full assurance
[40:56] that God will keep his word but when the
[40:59] church disbelieves Satan and believes
[41:02] the spirits revelation of the word the
[41:04] gates of Hell cannot prevail against her
[41:06] don't you love that when your stopper
[41:08] Satan tries to tempt you and he cannot
[41:10] prevail against you don't you know that
[41:12] let's call it walk into the spirit and
[41:14] I'd Olivia because when you're walking
[41:17] the flesh you fall short you make
[41:19] mistakes but when you're walking the
[41:20] spirit he does not prevail against you
[41:23] you prevail against it hey man as long
[41:27] as we have our confidence in the Word of
[41:28] God we will prevail against it when we
[41:31] live by the revelation of the word amen
[41:36] now I cut this short Earl is called a
[41:39] little short he talks about his ministry
[41:41] up here but I just got a little short
[41:42] cuz most you remember that it is the
[41:44] sermon ministry okay your airline
[41:46] industry he said I wish you could stay
[41:47] with me and see the face of people and
[41:49] Satan knows he didn't be exposed now it
[41:51] isn't the people that i'm talking about
[41:53] it is that Satan has got a hold in their
[41:55] lives through said indifference and
[41:57] disease well you should see their faces
[42:00] Satan knows he's going to be exposed and
[42:02] the most peculiar changes come over
[42:04] people's countess's st. is a brain he
[42:07] knows that the Spirit of God is about to
[42:09] let the people know of his works and
[42:11] that is why he hates these meetings so
[42:14] much I trust he hates our meetings to
[42:16] that idea that his his waves are being
[42:20] to see his deceptions his traps in sin
[42:23] are being deceived by the preaching of
[42:25] the word a mint preaching the message of
[42:27] God's problem amen hallelujah so Satan
[42:33] hates for the people of God to know
[42:34] about his works but he continues when
[42:39] names are called and disease is revealed
[42:42] Satan hates it ever listen to a good
[42:45] prayer line lately a Satan cause all
[42:47] their disease estate hates that God
[42:49] loves it here on Olivia does of their
[42:52] problem why is there what they can do to
[42:54] make it right God loves to be to be
[42:58] known right and he loves were Satan to
[43:01] be exposed what Satan hates it because
[43:03] what happened this is remember the law
[43:05] office session once it's exposed that
[43:07] there's a demon in the house but all the
[43:09] person has to do is confess that there's
[43:11] a demon in there repent of it right and
[43:13] then a greater power of faith will come
[43:15] in and drive him out then you got to get
[43:17] your house cleaned out right they got to
[43:20] have it have a stronger man on the
[43:22] inside to keep those seven forget back
[43:23] in Satan's going to come back in like
[43:26] our brother testified about being
[43:27] delivered from tobacco so was that but
[43:29] guys what's safe trying to cut back in
[43:31] but I had to keep them out right because
[43:33] I had a stronger one on the inside of me
[43:35] than those Devils that were in the World
[43:37] Cup it's this holy sphere is the faith
[43:40] and gods were any men that will keep out
[43:43] Satan from getting back in now what is
[43:47] this it is not by reading it's not
[43:50] telepathy north of witchcraft it is a
[43:52] revelation by the Holy Ghost that is the
[43:54] only way I can know it okay so by the
[43:57] AUSA just so you know you probably seen
[43:58] our videos videos on our website brother

[44:38] old I think last year but this is a
[44:40] reality this was a gift that no creature
[44:43] has ever exercised and it is the last
[44:45] night of the Gentiles before the rapture
[44:47] amen its exact your I that's not save
[44:49] the lower from brother Brandon from the
[44:51] Bible too ok now let's keep going this
[44:55] is
[44:55] it's really really good here real good
[44:57] onions I'm going to try to buy half a
[45:00] half an hour more the Satan knows
[45:02] assuredly that the original church at
[45:05] Pentecost with the power of God mark 16
[45:08] in action is the true church that Jesus
[45:11] claims as his own all those is false it
[45:14] has to be now remember this Christ in
[45:17] the true church is a continuation of the
[45:19] book of Acts but the book of Revelation
[45:21] shows how that the Antichrist spirit
[45:24] would come into the church into violent
[45:26] making it lukewarm formal and powerless
[45:30] amen church sometimes we feel lukewarm
[45:33] don't worry we got to be like that ego
[45:35] program talk about when your eyes get
[45:36] filled over you got to find a landing
[45:38] place and gotta beat your head until all
[45:40] that film comes off your eyes we gotta
[45:43] do it how to do that at the author
[45:45] writer and prayer or confession we said
[45:48] confess our sins but this is Satan's job
[45:52] to make us lukewarm formal and powerless
[45:55] oh my gods can help us overcome
[45:58] hallelujah auto break-ins see they're
[46:01] all savings change me broken by the
[46:02] bride of Jesus Christ amen now look that
[46:06] next he said the book of Revelation it
[46:11] exposes Satan revealing his works which
[46:15] which he rehearses works attempted
[46:17] destruction of God's people and the
[46:19] discrediting of God's work right down to
[46:24] the time he's cashed in the lake of fire
[46:26] right he fights that he cannot stand it
[46:30] he knows that the people get the true
[46:32] revelation of the true church and what
[46:35] she is what she stands for and that she
[46:39] can do the greater works she will be an
[46:42] invincible army if they get a true
[46:44] revelation of the two spirits within the
[46:46] framework of the Christian Church and by
[46:48] God's Spirit discern and withstand the
[46:51] Antichrist spirit Satan will be
[46:54] powerless before amen beautiful other
[46:57] video that's what we're striving for
[47:00] that's what we're living for this is
[47:01] what we're preaching for so that the
[47:03] church will grow in Revelation
[47:05] understanding that Satan will be cast
[47:09] before part not sure what that was okay
[47:13] forgive me that's pretty I worldly their
[47:16] partner not sure what had happened
[47:18] kicked me off that's what's st. trying
[47:23] to distract everybody with right there
[47:25] okay sister can you try that again and
[47:27] go back just cycle through maybe go two
[47:31] three all the way i'm not sure why that
[47:33] keep me up that was rather strange go
[47:35] back to hdmi to impossible thank you
[47:37] let's see if it'll take me up again
[47:39] sorry about a dad to work great ok well
[47:45] can you turn it off oppressor what does
[47:48] turn it off I'm sorry that that I
[47:51] grieves my heart say like that that kind
[47:53] of stuff grieves my heart cuz people
[47:54] give themselves to that nonsense thank
[47:57] goodness ok so we must discern the
[48:02] Antichrist spirit and then we stand it
[48:06] by God's grace so let me say like this
[48:07] like we said this morning with critical
[48:09] spear it's not enough to be able to
[48:11] point out all the wrongs out in the
[48:12] world we must withstand them race God
[48:16] amen we're talking about conspiracy
[48:18] there is between services all those
[48:20] things are true but if we let the music
[48:22] or we let those celebrities to
[48:24] lifestyles and tendencies and they're
[48:26] like into our lives me we just recognize
[48:28] that we didn't withstand it and we have
[48:31] to withstand all that by the grace of
[48:32] God Amen Alleluia now program says save
[48:39] will be as definitely for to today as
[48:41] when Christ was stood as every effort to
[48:44] gain power over him in the desert so
[48:47] just like jesus said it's written is
[48:48] written it's written so we can do the
[48:50] same thing it's great that's right it's
[48:51] written on the video yeah Satan hate
[48:54] revelation but we love it don't you love
[48:57] it when God murders reveal to you a
[48:59] revelation is a must at the lower let me
[49:02] know that a revelation is a making note
[49:04] of God's perfect will for your life so
[49:06] water baptism is a revelation is thus
[49:09] saith the Lord you must be baptized
[49:11] fully immersive water and you must do it
[49:14] as soon as you believe with all your
[49:15] heart and right that's a revelation and
[49:17] then we move on to marriage and divorce
[49:19] let me move on to all these
[49:21] church age is all these seals up we move
[49:23] on by God's grace but we're desiring
[49:25] today every day to hear the voice of God
[49:28] to know revelation for example like last
[49:30] week let me tear that testimony real
[49:32] quick brother Benjamin was up here and
[49:34] people saw him crying right out some
[49:36] people saw Carla than a service brought
[49:37] up standing worshiping I saw him crying
[49:39] a little bit I thought I just keep
[49:40] seeing some more song in my heart I
[49:42] thought I don't think he had enough
[49:43] experience with God that's what i was
[49:45] saying so I'm going to keep singing then
[49:46] I was going to go down and pray for him
[49:47] well brother back Brian I we went out to
[49:50] eat after church test as they brought
[49:51] Brian Hawkins in his family last Sunday
[49:53] night and he talked a little bit more
[49:55] about it he said brother Jesse said when
[49:57] I was standing there I said I felt a
[49:59] cool spirit kind of pass over me and I
[50:02] felt the presence of the lord and I felt
[50:04] something they said go pray for him and
[50:07] he said just ignored it right brother
[50:11] ran hundred many times that was the
[50:12] voice of Lord right we're trying to
[50:14] learn to hear the voice of the lord god
[50:17] help us to hear amen at the same time
[50:20] Benjamin's praying Lord if it's my day
[50:22] to repent I ran from you for 26 years if
[50:25] it's my day to repent have somebody come
[50:27] lay their hand on my shoulder last
[50:30] Sunday morning and brother bryan said he
[50:33] felt that cool spirit pass over him
[50:36] again and he said I don't care anymore
[50:38] i'm going to pray for him and brother
[50:42] mentor said he's cried Ares and all of a
[50:44] sudden he felt a hand on his on his
[50:46] shoulder unless he would've been his
[50:47] left shoulder because I was on that site
[50:48] and he looked up and he said praise God
[50:50] it must be my day he said he got to pray
[50:52] a little harder he says then he felt
[50:54] another hand on the shoulder that was
[50:55] brother cabin he said that's a double
[50:57] confirmation today's my day to repent
[50:58] I'm not happy are they near done but
[51:01] look at that that's a true revelation
[51:05] what's while I'm saying is that brother
[51:07] Briah got a revelation to go pray for
[51:09] somebody everybody see that that's a
[51:12] real revelation that's the will of God
[51:14] for that service and what's important it
[51:17] was at really important because God has
[51:19] heard our brothers heart God knew he was
[51:22] praying send somebody to lay head so
[51:23] that's why we got to be careful and all
[51:24] the time during service if you feel left
[51:27] to go pray for somebody if you just love
[51:29] somebody or just you try to follow
[51:31] leading to the Lord I thought that was
[51:33] so people in that beautiful
[51:34] so brother bride you really really doing
[51:37] good like it you keep pressing into
[51:38] those things of God he's just real
[51:40] humble i'll try to encourage of us
[51:42] that's really beautiful to see how hard
[51:44] to CERN like that oh my that was
[51:46] wonderful so Satan hates revelation we
[51:50] love it here's the next quote with true
[51:53] revelation our lives the gates of Hell
[51:56] cannot prevail against us but we will
[51:58] prevail over there now I find this in my
[52:01] life right now the reason I'm still
[52:03] prevailing over the gates of hell is
[52:05] because I must have received true
[52:07] revelation I amen right that's why I say
[52:11] he's not prevailing over me i'm going
[52:13] out into sin a worldliness all kinds
[52:15] that you can nade all the city the Bible
[52:16] there but that's why I'm still convicted
[52:18] because I have a genuine revelation so
[52:20] if people follow the way and deny this
[52:22] word to get back into sin it shows they
[52:24] never added to revelation that's right
[52:26] he's a true revelation jesus said will
[52:29] overcome the gates of hell let's read
[52:31] that Matthew I know it's familiar church
[52:33] but just that's a part sometimes we just
[52:36] forget over your number yeah Peter you
[52:38] got a new name it has the keys the
[52:39] kingdom and so we're like that but let's
[52:42] look at the power of Revelation once
[52:44] again because this is what struck me so
[52:46] much yesterday I got him out okay joke
[52:48] it on do good first half 25 Matthew 16
[53:00] verse 17 and cheese answer is that had
[53:03] blessed art outside and bar Jonah for
[53:05] flesh and blood has not revealed
[53:06] underneath but my father which is in
[53:08] heaven revealed that he was the Christ
[53:10] and I also say anything that thou art
[53:12] Peter and upon this rock of Revelation I
[53:15] will build my church and the gates of
[53:17] Hell shall not prevail against it we
[53:21] have a province church if we get real
[53:23] revelation hell cannot prevail against
[53:25] us who's going to take us to help but we
[53:27] already prevailed over hell hey today I
[53:30] knew yeah geez already conquered the
[53:32] gates of hell how can I go to hell when
[53:34] Jesus covered the gates of hell and
[53:36] crisis-hit knitting that Tim possible
[53:39] because it gave me the revelation of his
[53:41] word we will prevail over the gates of
[53:44] gates means councils and we literally
[53:47] you think my literal gates will there
[53:48] our literal gates of course to help
[53:49] because you wrote I talk on geez
[53:51] knocking down doors & gates and things
[53:53] like that one was weighed out but the
[53:55] Greek word actually means councils the
[53:57] council's have Satan to deceive us and
[53:59] take us away from Christ will be
[54:01] thwarted will be prevail against for
[54:04] true revelation of the word of God Amen
[54:08] hallelujah okay now I want to get down
[54:13] to buy important quotes here all right
[54:19] mr. Wendy I'm going to try this on the
[54:21] other device here so I really want
[54:24] people to see this I'm just gonna say oh
[54:37] ok it's that going help us jesus i
[54:40] really wanted this to work i want to see
[54:41] them people to see the quote oh okay I'm
[54:48] sorry sister I can't turn it off sorry
[54:50] church already tried to unless you're
[54:52] right it's not working that's the first
[54:55] time we ever had trouble with it we're
[54:56] preaching on Satan Oh at devil okay
[55:00] anyway as I've already said this book of
[55:03] Revelation is the consummation of the
[55:05] scripts remembers the last book of the
[55:07] Bible now you can know why it says that
[55:10] anyone who reads or even here same is
[55:12] what blessed that's where we right here
[55:14] that's why I open over that tech anyone
[55:16] who reads this program said if you
[55:18] couldn't read those days you just had to
[55:19] hear it haha cinematic so education
[55:22] doesn't matter somebody's gotta have
[55:24] education didn't read it right but
[55:25] education for every person doesn't
[55:27] matter it's the hearing of faith how the
[55:30] new gun right now here's Ralph this way
[55:33] I want to get to it is the revelation of
[55:35] God that will give you a 40 over the
[55:39] devil so when you know the revelation or
[55:42] the Word of God when you know the save
[55:44] the Lord you have authority over the
[55:46] devil so why hide one so in your life
[55:49] wise you have authority over all these
[55:51] temptation because you got a revelation
[55:52] of God's will that's why sisters will go
[55:55] back to pants as well go back to make up
[55:57] and all this thing like that why don't I
[55:59] go back to tobacco or dirty movies
[56:01] like that because I gather revelation
[56:02] with God's words that that's wrong and
[56:04] it's a reality to me and so I got
[56:06] Authority with those things come I could
[56:08] turn my eyes or I can rebuke them and
[56:10] their yeah you can turn it down because
[56:13] you've got an authority when God reviews
[56:15] his word and it's us say the Lord for
[56:17] you is thus saith the Lord to me that to
[56:19] put anything wicked before my eyes it's
[56:21] a sin so that when I see I looked away
[56:24] by God's grace that's power that's
[56:26] authority over city two are gonna be
[56:28] church that's exactly right and that
[56:31] struck me very powerfully he's talking
[56:33] about this revelation gives you
[56:35] authority over the devil he says and now
[56:38] can you see why they who would add to or
[56:41] take away from the book of Revelation
[56:44] would be cursed can't you see that now
[56:45] because the book of Revelation reveals
[56:47] all Satan's plan is all God's victories
[56:49] and to add to that plan or take away
[56:52] from that plan God curses you that's
[56:55] striking tremely striking because
[56:57] revelation is the blueprint of course
[56:59] the whole bottom but he's speaking about
[57:00] revelation tells that anything saying
[57:02] it's so important because these the
[57:05] shows you are you going to operate in
[57:06] this day at the end times and we need
[57:09] those revelations to overcome the gates
[57:11] of hell let's say phrasal already raised
[57:13] on the line amen other than you okay I
[57:17] said for who can add or take away from
[57:19] the perfect revelation of God and
[57:21] overcome the enemy is that simple
[57:23] brother branham says there's nothing of
[57:26] such prevailing power as the revelation
[57:29] of the word Amen praise God hallelujah
[57:34] now this is the point I was once I got
[57:37] to that I really wanted to read preach
[57:38] this because I always spend a little bit
[57:39] of time limit brother have said no but
[57:42] messenger of Malachi for both men's
[57:44] ministry and revelation 10-7 is going to
[57:47] do two things number one he's going to
[57:50] he's going to turn the hearts of the
[57:52] children to their fathers I remember we
[57:55] looked at that a few weeks ago what has
[57:56] turned me turn means to repent because
[57:58] remember Israel has left Egypt and the
[58:01] Bible said in their hearts they turned
[58:02] back to Egypt so when your heart is
[58:05] turned toward something you fall in love
[58:06] with it amen ha ha ha so brother and his
[58:10] ministry turns our hearts back to the
[58:12] fathers that
[58:13] that means we fall in love with the
[58:15] early apostolic faith of the Christians
[58:17] praise God we fall in love with that
[58:19] that's exactly right now the second
[58:22] thing he would do he would reveal the
[58:25] mysteries of the seven thunders in
[58:28] Revelation 10 which are what they are
[58:32] the revelations contained in the seven
[58:36] seals okay alright so that's what the
[58:40] seventh age was supposed to do because
[58:43] that's what the Bible said he took the
[58:44] open book and he prophesied that book
[58:46] you refinish the mysteries that were in
[58:47] that open book and the book cannot be
[58:49] open until the skills were taking off
[58:51] right okay so this is completely
[58:54] scriptural this just is people making
[58:56] this up that's what the Bible said in
[58:58] chapters five six and seven right the
[59:00] seals Jesus looses the seals send comes
[59:03] down in that mighty angel gives them to
[59:05] a seventh angel and then John eats it up
[59:07] as we heard last Sunday and takes it to
[59:09] all nations kingdom to peoples and
[59:10] tongues hallelujah no this is powerful
[59:15] it will be these divinely revealed
[59:18] mystery truce that literally turn the
[59:22] hearts of the children to the
[59:23] Pentecostal fathers exactly so my so let
[59:30] me let me reword that another way our
[59:32] hearts can only be turned back to the
[59:35] apostolic faith through the book of
[59:38] Revelation praise God right because the
[59:43] seven dollars out of their voices when
[59:45] that open book come down to earth but
[59:47] God said john doe right it's for the end
[59:49] time when the mysteries finished with
[59:52] the seventh angel on Olivia amen if we
[59:56] don't understand the book of Revelation
[59:58] your heart cannot turn back but if your
[1:00:00] heart sugar back that God will help you
[1:00:02] understand the book of Revelation a then
[1:00:04] it's impossible because that's the
[1:00:06] Ministry of Revelation ten said you have
[1:00:09] to receive that in order to receive the
[1:00:12] Pentecostal faith of the fathers for the
[1:00:15] ramp steps oh my that's beautiful Oh
[1:00:17] hallelujah thank you Jesus now there's
[1:00:22] two quotes or mother has already set the
[1:00:24] thunders were already revealed people
[1:00:26] wonder the seven
[1:00:27] rather seven thunders weather have
[1:00:28] already said what they were in questions
[1:00:30] answers 1964 they said have the seven
[1:00:33] thunders which equals seven mysteries
[1:00:36] already been revealed where they
[1:00:37] revealed the seven seals but are not yet
[1:00:40] known to us as the thunders yet he said
[1:00:42] no they were revealed in the seven seals
[1:00:45] that's what the seventh butters were
[1:00:47] about the seven thunders were about the
[1:00:50] seven seals okay and then he says again
[1:00:55] the church age book I just read it yes
[1:00:58] he will reveal the mysteries of the
[1:01:00] seven thunders in Revelation tent which
[1:01:02] are the revelations contained in the
[1:01:05] seven seals praise God so let's go to
[1:01:07] Revelation chapter 10 please let's go
[1:01:10] there in your Bibles so just having the
[1:01:24] book of Revelation is so powerful did
[1:01:26] you brothers ever hear in your
[1:01:27] denomination I never did I never heard
[1:01:30] nothing about the book of everything
[1:01:31] today they say the real far away from
[1:01:33] them because people they know that
[1:01:35] that's controversial people got this
[1:01:37] idea that idea and everything like that
[1:01:38] and church and honestly those clouds
[1:01:41] features are awesome themselves they
[1:01:43] don't know because they're not profits
[1:01:45] if a prophet prophesize was only would
[1:01:48] have to interpret another prophet but we
[1:01:52] received a profit a man who's told us
[1:01:54] thus saith the Lord hallelujah and then
[1:01:57] were after each and every one of those
[1:01:58] seven seals he said that buff saith the
[1:02:01] Lord after each and every one ah I did
[1:02:05] he say God revealed this to me this is
[1:02:07] the perfect revelation the perfect
[1:02:09] interpretation of each seal hey man
[1:02:12] hallelujah and without that you cannot
[1:02:15] overcome the gates of hell with ram says
[1:02:17] you have to know the revelations of the
[1:02:20] book of Revelation is that the day an
[1:02:22] hour we're living it Oh beautiful
[1:02:25] beautiful okay so we're in Revelation
[1:02:28] chapter 10 right got through your box
[1:02:29] okay now brother amen King I'll shake
[1:02:34] your hand I just assumed you had okay
[1:02:36] yeah we got it looking I got
[1:02:40] sorry sometimes I I put you on the spot
[1:02:43] for guinea I just I just look up there I
[1:02:46] assume people got good eyesight they
[1:02:49] don't get the ohel people have their
[1:02:50] voices post my voice a little bit too
[1:02:52] sorry brother i do that that for the 7th

[1:02:57] i put it up there all the time just get
[1:02:59] used to me put it up there so forgive
[1:03:00] you verse 7 not when the days of the
[1:03:05] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[1:03:06] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[1:03:08] be finished if he had declared to his
[1:03:10] servants the prophets okay now I want to
[1:03:13] read this quote here brother Brandon
[1:03:15] gave this is from Paris what does he
[1:03:25] traction on the matter ok well the
[1:03:31] Bramson what's happened on not son said
[1:03:33] that's where brother branham met the
[1:03:35] angel the Lord and all those angels God
[1:03:37] confirming his word that's what all this
[1:03:39] noise is about all the noise that father
[1:03:41] on his ministry that's what it was about
[1:03:43] God fulfilling his word he said notice
[1:03:46] it's God fulfilling his promise word
[1:03:47] again of Revelation 10 12 7 and if you
[1:03:51] skipped down free pair could have some
[1:03:52] paragraph 1 52 but I said the God of
[1:03:55] heaven promised the evening time would
[1:03:57] have lights three years ago this mystery
[1:04:00] was a prophecy in what time is it sir
[1:04:02] but now its history it's past the
[1:04:06] promise is fulfilled what time is it
[1:04:09] CERN what's this attraction it's God
[1:04:12] fulfilling his word amen so revelation
[1:04:16] 10 when the seven is history it's
[1:04:19] already happened the church said so when
[1:04:22] we read this it already happened God
[1:04:24] always does this guy always revealed his
[1:04:26] word first of course he prophesized it
[1:04:28] but he doesn't really tell the
[1:04:29] interpretation of it till the RT
[1:04:31] interprets it himself amen hi the video
[1:04:34] so that's what he did in Revelation 1074
[1:04:36] told it but then it came to pass and he
[1:04:39] comes back later through a prophet and
[1:04:41] said I've already fulfilled this it's
[1:04:42] already done its history amen glory so
[1:04:47] verse 1 in Revelation 10 I saw another
[1:04:49] mighty angel come down from heaven
[1:04:51] clothed with the cloud
[1:04:53] that's the picture we have of the cloud
[1:04:55] looks just like the Hoffmans head of
[1:04:56] christ and the rainbow was on his head
[1:04:59] and his face was as to where the sun and
[1:05:01] his feet as pillars of fire and he had
[1:05:03] his head in a little book open and he
[1:05:05] said his right foot upon the scene his
[1:05:07] left foot upon the earth and cried with
[1:05:09] a loud voices with allied north and when
[1:05:11] he decried seven thunders uttered their
[1:05:14] voices praise God now remember when
[1:05:17] brother brahim said he went out come out
[1:05:19] sunset he said the Angels told him to go
[1:05:22] back east and opened the seven seals for
[1:05:25] God we know that so that age of coming
[1:05:28] down was versus one and two right but
[1:05:32] when brother Branham begins to preach
[1:05:34] the seven seals in March of 1963 first
[1:05:39] three starts being fulfilled amen not a
[1:05:42] video that's exactly right and cried
[1:05:46] with a loud voice as when a lion roar
[1:05:47] and when he cried seven thunders uttered
[1:05:50] his voice on what well the better say
[1:05:51] the seven thunders were they were the
[1:05:53] revelations contained in the seven seals
[1:05:56] praise God it's exactly right now the
[1:06:03] book this mysterious little book was
[1:06:06] open in chapter 5 i'm sorry i'm in
[1:06:09] chapter 5 it was put in the hands of
[1:06:11] Christ will go to chapter 6 verse 1
[1:06:13] chapter 5 Christ comes and takes the
[1:06:21] book right John screens everybody hears
[1:06:24] him in heaven earth under the seat
[1:06:25] everywhere God God less that phrase go
[1:06:28] throughout all times and spaces and
[1:06:30] dimensions through him so powerful my
[1:06:33] challenge on now verse 10 and I and I
[1:06:38] saw when the lamb opened one of the
[1:06:40] seals and I heard I said where the noise
[1:06:41] of thunder one of the four beasts saying
[1:06:44] come and see and I saw him behold a
[1:06:47] white horse and he that sat on him had a
[1:06:49] bow and a crown was given unto him and
[1:06:51] he went forth conquering and to conquer
[1:06:55] praise God so how many can see that how
[1:06:58] they can see that when the seal was
[1:07:00] loose a thunder roared everybody see
[1:07:02] that praise God
[1:07:04] now brother branham steady each seal had
[1:07:07] three forms a symbol for which is what
[1:07:10] John saw the symbol form and wrote in a
[1:07:12] book the reality Foreman X that writer
[1:07:15] actually goes riding upon the earth the
[1:07:17] Antichrist spirit and then the
[1:07:18] revelation form to tell you what the
[1:07:20] symbols mean that was brother branham's
[1:07:22] ministry I got all the boats are going
[1:07:25] to email I'm ready to email Indy the
[1:07:26] coach from this corner if anybody wants
[1:07:28] these quotes brother arms the same thing
[1:07:29] this isn't another seal but I said
[1:07:32] notice the first seal when it was open
[1:07:34] the civil forum at thunder now what
[1:07:36] about when its open in skree ality for
[1:07:38] more the brand of sense haha oh hi he
[1:07:42] says first is with God next it's an
[1:07:44] assemble that it's revealed these things
[1:07:46] it's coming forward from the throne amen
[1:07:50] first it can be seen heard nothing it's
[1:07:53] sealed up but lambs blood paid the price
[1:07:55] at Thunder when he spoke out and when he
[1:07:57] did a white horse rider started out and
[1:07:59] it still was a symbol I want to go back
[1:08:03] to this now I just want to go back to
[1:08:05] this on March eighteen nineteen
[1:08:07] sixty-three brother branham priest the
[1:08:09] first seal when he got down he said thus
[1:08:11] saith the Lord these are the revelations
[1:08:13] while he was preaching that was the
[1:08:16] voice of God as a thunder thundering out
[1:08:19] that was one of the seven thunders of
[1:08:20] Revelation tenth chapter 3 everyone
[1:08:22] think that was one of the Thunder
[1:08:24] because my dad said there were seven
[1:08:26] consecutive one two three four five six
[1:08:27] seven seven consecutive letters at roar
[1:08:29] right in a row praise God so all the
[1:08:32] mysteries of Whitehorse the mystery of
[1:08:34] all these things that the boat without
[1:08:35] an arrow all that was a mystery until
[1:08:38] the voice of God Thunder not the
[1:08:42] revelation and set down safe below
[1:08:43] that's exactly right on March 19th the
[1:08:48] second seal and the house and that's
[1:08:50] this is my favorite one for program says
[1:08:52] it I say the Lord he put on one of my
[1:08:55] videos I love it but he says do you love
[1:08:58] it do you believe it and everybody's
[1:09:00] clapping shot he goes that's the same
[1:09:02] for the hard and they just erupted to
[1:09:05] worse about the pie feel like I'm there
[1:09:06] right down Adrian might Olivia but
[1:09:09] Marcia I teeth was the second seal and
[1:09:11] the revelations was the Thunder the
[1:09:13] second Thunder boys where he's gone and
[1:09:15] so for bars 22 third
[1:09:18] the third seal mark 20 Birds the fourth
[1:09:21] seal the fourth under glory mar 22nd the
[1:09:25] fifth seal which was the fifth under all
[1:09:27] those revelations was God thundering for
[1:09:29] his word about what they were other news
[1:09:32] program said this is history this
[1:09:34] already happened amen re bark 23rd the
[1:09:39] sixth seal was the sixth under and Mark
[1:09:41] 24 the seventh seal member only one of
[1:09:44] this part was revealed like the
[1:09:46] revelation of it was revealed not the
[1:09:48] reality and there was no symbol for it
[1:09:51] but the revelation of the seven thunders
[1:09:53] or seven seal was revealed the seven
[1:09:55] thunders uttered it out what was it it
[1:09:57] was the day and hour when Christ would
[1:09:59] return brother branham said so is the
[1:10:00] date it's the moment of the rapture
[1:10:01] praise God that's the mystery behind the
[1:10:04] Seventh Seal that's what the set of
[1:10:06] mother said about it at the day or hour
[1:10:07] when Christ comes and there's no symbol
[1:10:10] of it so nobody knows anything about it
[1:10:12] saying can impersonate it but will be
[1:10:14] ready because the times and seasons will
[1:10:16] be prepared for because we get our meat
[1:10:18] a new season we get our spiritual word
[1:10:20] due season will be ready church because
[1:10:22] God has feed us is where they had I knew
[1:10:25] yeah amen it's exactly right hmm now I
[1:10:33] said all that to get to this we don't
[1:10:39] have to be
[1:10:40] garrett of the book of Revelation it is
[1:10:43] our key to the authority over Satan okay
[1:10:47] and I got five minutes okay so i'm
[1:10:50] really going to close already going to
[1:10:52] close it's our key all these revelations
[1:10:57] I'm just going to just mention this real
[1:10:59] quick back when I preach other seven
[1:11:02] seals a few months ago I showed how the
[1:11:04] four horse riders are Satan's Antichrist
[1:11:07] spirit and how they got into the church
[1:11:09] but I took it a step further and I
[1:11:11] believe if your spiritual you saw that
[1:11:13] we got to keep that rider for riding
[1:11:15] into our lives and he uses the same
[1:11:17] method he comes as a white horse real
[1:11:19] sweet and deceptive all my surely he
[1:11:22] won't die he told he wrote in the leaves
[1:11:24] he's mine surely God will not kill you
[1:11:26] look how he comes in all deceptive and
[1:11:28] the Bible said he didn't even know what
[1:11:30] she was doing she was so deceived praise
[1:11:32] God but there that that sin that was
[1:11:35] deceptive will become a murderous a red
[1:11:37] horse and you start killing people's
[1:11:41] testimonies right killing their
[1:11:43] character their their character and all
[1:11:45] these things like that to start
[1:11:46] bickering bad enough and back by and
[1:11:48] stabbing people in the back that's what
[1:11:49] sin does and then the the black horse
[1:11:53] you start trying to build your own
[1:11:54] Kingdom that's what about their their
[1:11:56] had all the control of the money right
[1:11:57] with the scale bounces and all these
[1:11:59] things and you're trying to get make
[1:12:00] your own build your own Kingdom build
[1:12:02] your own ministry yourself like that
[1:12:03] you'd understand i said and then the
[1:12:06] last one was dead and that's where
[1:12:07] you're spiritually separated from God
[1:12:09] you you can be alive with dead to bible
[1:12:11] said she that live with it pleasure is
[1:12:13] dead wash this when it's true for him
[1:12:16] that lives a pleasure to their den
[1:12:18] mother alive amen exactly right to walk
[1:12:21] through here to here to the revelation
[1:12:23] of God and then walked away live and
[1:12:25] said God have mercy because it's very
[1:12:26] possible they've crossed a line from
[1:12:28] death of the life and now they're in
[1:12:30] death I'll do because that's the final
[1:12:33] step the white the red the black and the
[1:12:36] pale now let me just go through this or
[1:12:41] whether the next time we'll go a little
[1:12:42] bit more deeper into this for church
[1:12:46] brother I have said this romancin the
[1:12:50] first three chapters the book of
[1:12:51] Revelation reveals all the happenings
[1:12:53] that
[1:12:53] search then from the third chapter of
[1:12:55] the 19th chapter of Revelation there's
[1:12:57] no more scene of the church the church
[1:12:59] goes up at the board chapter of
[1:13:01] Revelation and returns back at the 19
[1:13:03] chapter of Revelations the bride had
[1:13:06] grouped together coming to the earth he
[1:13:10] says during the form to the 19th chapter
[1:13:12] God is dealing with instra honey bleep
[1:13:13] net that's right now when I preach that
[1:13:17] I showed how though the bride was hiding
[1:13:19] in some of these chapters between
[1:13:22] chapter 4 19 the bride is hiding in a
[1:13:25] few those chapters at union if you know
[1:13:27] your Bible real well okay or gods
[1:13:29] revealed to you perhaps which would be a
[1:13:31] glorious thing so I'm going to go
[1:13:33] through all 22 chapters real quick in
[1:13:35] three minutes chapters 1 2 & 3 are the
[1:13:40] church agents there for the last 2,000
[1:13:43] years plus today until the rapture goes
[1:13:45] that it's over then that's all fulfilled
[1:13:48] chapter four and five now I believe
[1:13:50] chapter 4 and 5 and this I could be
[1:13:53] wrong with this everybody listen I could
[1:13:54] be wrong with this but i believe chapter
[1:13:56] 4 or 5 is already history too I believe
[1:13:59] Jesus already came in heaven took the
[1:14:01] book open it up and send it down himself
[1:14:04] as an angel I just believe that cuz
[1:14:07] honking the book how can we receive the
[1:14:09] whole book if it wasn't open in heaven
[1:14:10] yeah that's just my thought where I can
[1:14:13] be wrong on that brother Jose you got to
[1:14:15] heard that but I that I didn't get that
[1:14:17] from anybody that's what came to me as I
[1:14:19] studied the Word of God that's what I
[1:14:21] honestly believe I think that is look
[1:14:22] either that happened in 1963 to be
[1:14:24] honest I can be your own but that's what
[1:14:27] I believe because he first had to come
[1:14:29] take the book everybody rejoice that now
[1:14:31] the seals can be loose Redemption can be
[1:14:33] fully briefed they head and then it came
[1:14:36] down through an angel anuya took his
[1:14:39] picture right gave it to a profit and
[1:14:41] now it's going around around the world
[1:14:43] hallelujah hey so I just I could be
[1:14:46] wrong with that but i believe chapter 4
[1:14:47] and 5 is already fulfilled i believe its
[1:14:49] history chapter 6 is the first six
[1:14:53] steals so we're under the fourth seal
[1:14:57] right now right the pale horse rider
[1:14:58] that's we're on the right down so the
[1:15:00] first three been fulfilled before five
[1:15:01] six and seven are to come but you only
[1:15:04] see the first six there okay so
[1:15:07] tribulation is the sixth seal right so
[1:15:09] in chapter 6 we start getting into the
[1:15:12] Tribulation Period chapter 7 is the
[1:15:14] Tribulation Period this is 144 thousand
[1:15:16] Jews have to go through the tribulation
[1:15:18] their brother must suffer for a little
[1:15:20] season to receive the white robes okay
[1:15:23] chapter eight chapter eight god hi hit
[1:15:27] the rapture in their first one is the
[1:15:28] rapture he left the seven see the
[1:15:31] opening of seven sealed their silence in
[1:15:32] heaven because Christ come down to the
[1:15:33] sky to catch his bride away that's mine
[1:15:35] talk to you that's my thought too so and
[1:15:39] then the rest of chapter 8 is the first
[1:15:41] four trumpets and it mentions the first
[1:15:44] read all three woes so that's
[1:15:46] Tribulation Period chapter nine is the
[1:15:49] fifth and sixth trumpets and one was
[1:15:51] already passed backs Tribulation Period
[1:15:53] church they say ministry gotta make this
[1:15:55] as simple as ABC always believed Christ
[1:15:57] amen by the video revelation is simple
[1:16:01] when you sit down and pray and ask god
[1:16:03] and church I feel like people get or
[1:16:05] what are those books up there's like
[1:16:08] books that give like uh a short
[1:16:11] condensed that I would say that yeah
[1:16:13] what is it cliff notes a guy like that
[1:16:16] it's like we have a cliff notes of the
[1:16:17] whole Bible footnotes or shorter
[1:16:20] versions where you can look up and find
[1:16:21] with those stories really about another
[1:16:24] word find all the answers tell about the
[1:16:25] books actually about its kind of you
[1:16:27] have an answering book to all these
[1:16:29] things it's like we think there's a test
[1:16:31] out on the earth and God gave us the
[1:16:33] answer key to the test all you have to
[1:16:35] do is type in miles and go see what
[1:16:37] brother grant bond about it we got the
[1:16:38] answer book there's no excuse for us we
[1:16:41] can just type in first seal and see what
[1:16:43] the first feel is as though save the
[1:16:45] Lord glory oh yeah cuz that's all we
[1:16:49] have to do with all these trumpets and
[1:16:50] vials and things just type it in and go
[1:16:53] see what he said God he was the ants
[1:16:55] with there's no way we can there's no
[1:16:56] way we can fail the test for the bank
[1:16:58] but they then there's no way we could
[1:17:00] fail cuz we got the answer key Amen
[1:17:02] honey we won't fail holiday will
[1:17:04] overcome in Jesus Christ's name
[1:17:07] hallelujah just like the one behind the
[1:17:11] curtain in this great job we know the
[1:17:12] one he wrote to play and we know all the
[1:17:14] parts holiday via now chapter 10 chapter
[1:17:16] 10 I you just said verses 1 through San
[1:17:19] Lorenzo is history so that happen
[1:17:21] during the Gentile Church age they have
[1:17:24] been to 1963 its history that right amen
[1:17:28] chapter 11 is the two prophets of Israel
[1:17:31] the tribulation and the seventh trumpet
[1:17:33] and the second was passed that's the
[1:17:35] tribulation chapter 12 Israel and the
[1:17:38] woman and the third whoa that's
[1:17:40] Tribulation Period chapter 13 is the
[1:17:44] mark of the beast and the mark laid down
[1:17:46] now part of that is Gentile right
[1:17:48] because I just read it this morning by
[1:17:49] the radisson revelation 13 16 he says he
[1:17:52] was for the bride right they're going to
[1:17:55] try to persecute it's not the ride from
[1:17:56] pray she right that's what he said this
[1:17:59] morning was on that right he said the
[1:18:00] spirit of you side won't that swear to
[1:18:01] God wrote that praise God and revelation
[1:18:04] 13 is USA right so part of that deals
[1:18:07] with the church age and then part of
[1:18:08] that deals with the Tribulation Period
[1:18:10] when they actually set it down and kill
[1:18:11] anyone that would not take the mark so
[1:18:14] that's a little bit of mystery in there
[1:18:15] right there's hiding in there must a few
[1:18:17] scriptures about the bride how shall
[1:18:18] overcome the Beast by the new you now
[1:18:21] verse 14 chapter 14 has the lamb with
[1:18:25] 144,000 beautiful man of an angel with
[1:18:28] the everlasting gospel and the thrusting
[1:18:30] it of the sickle so there's part of the
[1:18:33] church age in there because they preach
[1:18:34] the everlasting gospel I think that's
[1:18:36] one more call they give before the
[1:18:39] tribulation but the thrusting of the
[1:18:42] signal that's Israel being harvested us
[1:18:44] that's the last time the sickles going
[1:18:45] horn to harvest hungerford 4,000 all the
[1:18:47] destruction comes for a chapter 15 the
[1:18:50] seven last plagues in seven vials that's
[1:18:53] tribulation chapter 16 the pouring out
[1:18:56] of the seven vials tribulation chapter
[1:18:59] 17 gives the description the Catholic
[1:19:01] Church and the mother heart I'm over my
[1:19:03] time I'm trying to finish sure some part
[1:19:05] of that a search eh but part of that is
[1:19:07] tribulation as well because it talks
[1:19:08] about the Kings all giving power to the
[1:19:10] woman during the Tribulation Period and
[1:19:12] all these all the wars they make it all
[1:19:14] these things like that chapter 18
[1:19:16] there's a short version at the beginning
[1:19:18] where there's a calling out of the
[1:19:19] brides that come out of her my people
[1:19:21] being out our takers of her sins and
[1:19:23] legs so part of chapter 18 there's still
[1:19:26] some of the bride calling the Rio
[1:19:28] denominationalism aren't you glad he
[1:19:30] called out amen but the rest of that
[1:19:33] deals the tribulation of the destruction
[1:19:35] the mother harder chapter 19 we finally
[1:19:38] get to the bride again in here the bride
[1:19:40] comes back with Christ and arm again ha
[1:19:43] ha ha chapter 20 shows the bride in the
[1:19:48] millennium we preach on that to Sunday's
[1:19:50] going two resurrections on Sunday night
[1:19:52] they are given judgment during the
[1:19:55] Millennium and they're giving judgment
[1:19:56] at the white throne judgment and the
[1:19:58] white throne judgment is taught in
[1:19:59] Revelation chapter 20 that's all after
[1:20:01] the rapture chapter 21 the holy city we
[1:20:04] saw this morning about Zion our showdown
[1:20:06] our location of our showdown tonight
[1:20:08] comes down and its description is given
[1:20:11] a revelation chapter 21 in chapter 22 to
[1:20:14] send our feet we have the description of
[1:20:16] the holy city and the invitation of the
[1:20:19] sphere and ride telling us to come and
[1:20:22] we have Jesus reassuring us he comes
[1:20:25] quickly now in that short little 10
[1:20:28] minutes I went how many would say the
[1:20:30] book of Revelation seems pretty simple
[1:20:32] now I would say is that I brother I'm
[1:20:36] gonna preach of aeschylus Lord really
[1:20:37] brother I were talking and he said
[1:20:39] there's all these you were talking on a
[1:20:40] bio setting there's all these symbols of
[1:20:42] the Bible and I said that's right but I
[1:20:44] said with it I said told the brother
[1:20:46] said the Bible interprets itself every
[1:20:49] symbol in the Bible that the Bible will
[1:20:51] tell what that symbol means everyone
[1:20:53] starting which are making a list I'm
[1:20:55] going to preach it for you brother so we
[1:20:57] can see it because guys give us an
[1:21:00] answer key he saw what the symbols mean
[1:21:02] we just gotta be patient enough and wait
[1:21:05] upon the Lord and he'll bring it to us
[1:21:16] you
[1:21:18] measures of barley for a penny see thou
[1:21:21] hurt not you own the wine praise god bro
[1:21:25] just watch your head with that scripture
[1:21:27] i am at that scripture because Satan
[1:21:31] cannot touch us when we go into God's
[1:21:34] presence with the oil the Holy Ghost and
[1:21:37] the wine vestibular Revelation Jesus
[1:21:39] told him you can't touch for the a men's
[1:21:42] prayer life haha hey man you can't touch
[1:21:46] brother bags revelations that right he
[1:21:48] said touch not sister Wendy's oil and
[1:21:50] wine he with me church boy so when we
[1:21:54] choose to get back in that presence that
[1:21:56] oil life saved and cannot do nothing to
[1:21:58] us will conquer every demon every day of
[1:22:01] hell is under our feet will prevail over
[1:22:04] the gates of hell hey man because jesus
[1:22:07] said you cannot touch that devil don't
[1:22:09] touch their revelation and don't touch
[1:22:11] their baptism of the Holy Ghost and he
[1:22:14] can't he get in my soul cuz he sealed
[1:22:16] out the Bible says I Olivia and to get
[1:22:19] into my soul forever got to be a brother
[1:22:22] and come in but he can't do that because
[1:22:23] he's a deceiver he's not a brother and
[1:22:25] he's ordained to destruction so you are
[1:22:27] safely protected by the oil and the wine
[1:22:30] let's give the Lord rattleballs get you
[1:22:38] the authority over Satan how do you
[1:22:41] believe that hallelujah praise now let's
[1:22:45] bow our heads here thank you Jesus
