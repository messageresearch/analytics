[0:00] uh hearty amen ready amen praise god
[0:03] let's take our bibles tonight praise god
[0:04] god bless you let's go to joshua chapter
[0:06] 15 i like to go to the joshua series
[0:08] tonight
[0:10] uh we just had such a wonderful joshua
[0:12] sermon on friday night so i just like to
[0:14] kind of just pick up where i left off
[0:16] here joshua 15
[0:18] and i think my text is verse 20 if i'm
[0:19] not mistaken here
[0:22] joshua 15 yeah 15 verse 20.
[0:37] hallelujah so i just like to speak on
[0:39] unique boundaries and ministries tonight
[0:42] related to joshua just a real simple
[0:45] thought but i think it'd be helpful and
[0:47] trust me a blessing to you
[0:50] [Music]
[0:55] brother amen you know come up after
[0:57] service on sunday and he's like brother
[0:59] diggs just
[1:00] he hit everything i was praying for you
[1:02] know so i was really thankful to hear
[1:03] the testimonies in church and if you
[1:05] heard a word from god on uh any time the
[1:08] weekend let's keep believing it praise
[1:09] god let's keep confessing it i'm going
[1:11] to keep confessing that that akron is
[1:13] going to know that jesus christ is the
[1:14] same yesterday today and forever praise
[1:16] god
[1:17] hallelujah
[1:19] that's why i still feel like there might
[1:20] be more time until the rapture because
[1:22] this city needs to know praise god and
[1:25] i'll say like this every city needs to
[1:27] know but the message people got to let
[1:28] them know
[1:30] if they got the truth if they got the
[1:31] the mystery of god finished it's their
[1:33] job to let them know
[1:34] so i'm just trusting god to give me time
[1:36] here
[1:36] of course i know the long suffering of
[1:38] lord is salvation the longer goes the
[1:40] more people being saved i know it's
[1:42] getting smaller too but there's still
[1:44] people being saved so we can rejoice in
[1:45] that praise god joshua 15 verse 20 and
[1:49] then we'll read verse 63
[1:52] 15
[1:53] 20 and 63.
[1:58] just give me a moment as i get there
[1:59] here joshua 15 verse 20.
[2:03] so we kind of ended with uh
[2:05] caleb last time and
[2:07] afternoon possessing all the gates of
[2:09] the enemies i believe there was 112
[2:11] cities mentioned in this chapter
[2:13] and every city had a gate
[2:16] and we saw how each one of us
[2:19] can
[2:21] gates in our lives we went through how
[2:22] paul possessed every gate
[2:26] regate every gate as well praise god
[2:30] and uh just like uh on sunday brother
[2:32] william and i were praying before we
[2:33] went to the both churches we prayed in
[2:35] and we said no man shall stand before us
[2:37] all the days of our life
[2:39] that's got to be our motto now amen
[2:41] whenever we face any obstacle just quote
[2:43] that amen there will shall no man or
[2:45] woman stand before us all the days of
[2:47] our life
[2:48] praise god and that's true no no one has
[2:50] amen
[2:51] so we thank the lord for his word it's
[2:53] his word that overcomes word in us
[2:55] because greater is his word in us than
[2:56] he that's in the world praise god joshua
[2:59] 15 verse 20
[3:00] and i do apologize stephen did give me a
[3:02] memory verse
[3:04] so i will turn to that
[3:06] briefly
[3:07] as you're at your spot there
[3:10] i've just got so many texts here kind of
[3:12] you know how they get buried
[3:13] and so this one got buried
[3:16] there it is okay
[3:20] okay so let's read joshua 15 verse 20.
[3:24] let's read this together just a very
[3:25] short verse let's read it one two three
[3:28] this is the inheritance of the tribe of
[3:31] the children of judah according to their
[3:34] families now go to verse 63 let's read
[3:36] that one too
[3:38] because i basically preached up to verse
[3:40] 62 is basically what i did i didn't
[3:42] really mention 63 and i realized i
[3:44] didn't mention that but i was listening
[3:46] to the chapter today while driving i'm
[3:48] like oh that's right i didn't preach
[3:49] verse 63 i got to preach that one it's
[3:51] an important chapter i'm sorry important
[3:53] verse rather
[3:55] all right so let's read verse 63 one two
[3:58] three as for the jebusites the
[4:00] inhabitants of jerusalem the children of
[4:03] judah could not drive them out but the
[4:06] jebusites dwell with the children of
[4:08] judah at jerusalem unto this day
[4:12] now we just saw a hundred and twelve
[4:15] gates
[4:17] were
[4:17] were possessed
[4:19] but not every one
[4:21] the majority judah captured the majority
[4:24] of the gates but they did not capture
[4:27] jerusalem if you know your bible if you
[4:29] studied it maybe you remember it maybe
[4:30] you forgot it i forgot it
[4:32] david was the one who actually overcame
[4:35] jerusalem that's why it's called the
[4:37] city of david
[4:39] joshua never conquered jerusalem because
[4:40] it wasn't given to him
[4:42] it was given to the tribe of judah but
[4:44] they never conquered it
[4:45] right until david came 400 years later
[4:49] so it's just amazing to see
[4:51] they possess
[4:52] much of the land but not all of it
[4:54] praise god and there's a purpose for
[4:56] that philippians two verses two and
[4:58] three i thought this was a good one
[5:00] uh this would be steven's memory verse
[5:02] and we'll probably run this for
[5:03] let's see it's already september 8th
[5:05] so probably run this for september maybe
[5:07] october too
[5:10] and then i believe we're at the blands
[5:11] but then the brands may i don't know
[5:13] when they're going back to pennsylvania
[5:14] so i'm not sure so i'll talk to brother
[5:16] johnny about that
[5:17] then for that we're going to our
[5:18] teenagers they're going to give us a
[5:20] memory verse praise god
[5:21] hallelujah
[5:25] if they're baptized filled with the holy
[5:26] ghost then they need to have a scripture
[5:28] on their heart praise god
[5:30] amen they ought to rejoice in that
[5:32] philippians 2 now what's interesting
[5:34] sister naomi is that that he he
[5:36] mentioned stephen mentioned the verses
[5:38] you did last year philippians 4 verses 6
[5:41] and 7. and he said if that one's already
[5:42] been done he said do this other one
[5:45] i said well yeah that was last year so
[5:46] let's just try a different one so
[5:48] philippians 2 verses 2 and 3. just some
[5:51] beautiful scriptures verse two and verse
[5:52] three
[5:55] let's read this on three what a nice
[5:56] nice portion of scripture here on three
[5:58] one two three fulfill ye my joy that ye
[6:02] be like-minded having the same love
[6:05] being of one accord of one mind let
[6:09] nothing be done through strife or vain
[6:12] glory but in lowliness of mind let each
[6:15] esteem other better than themselves
[6:18] let's have one more word of prayer if
[6:19] you have a need on your heart let's make
[6:20] another unto god
[6:21] let's pray to the god who hears
[6:24] hallelujah he is the god that hears our
[6:26] prayers tonight heavenly father we love
[6:27] you we've read your word lord this word
[6:30] is forever settled in heaven it's the
[6:31] same yesterday today and forever it's
[6:33] yea and amen hallelujah it's unchanging
[6:35] it's unmovable i pray lord god in jesus
[6:38] christ and anoint us tonight let these
[6:39] words be quickened as they were this
[6:41] past weekend bless brother diggs again
[6:43] renew his strength o god thank you lord
[6:45] for the sacrifice he could come surely
[6:47] we heard from heaven lord and we're
[6:48] grateful for the word of god that we
[6:50] heard now lord add to our faith add to
[6:52] our virtue lord whatever whatever lord
[6:55] anointing we're in need of give us
[6:57] further of that lord god
[6:59] in our minds lord for we know if our
[7:01] souls are sealed it's sealed to the day
[7:03] of our redemption but lord our minds
[7:05] need to renew day by day so lord uh
[7:08] inspire our thoughts lord god speak to
[7:10] us tonight and direct us by the holy
[7:12] ghost bless those all that have pressed
[7:13] their way out to the house of god made
[7:14] the sacrifices hallelujah bless them i
[7:17] pray abundantly bless those
[7:18] live-streaming as well lord and we give
[7:20] you all the thanks and praise in jesus
[7:22] christ's name and the saint said
[7:24] amen god bless you as you're being
[7:25] seated i'll try to go 45 minutes here
[7:27] see how that goes tonight
[7:33] so we're just inspired and
[7:36] for our live streamers i just want to
[7:38] encourage you you know
[7:39] as we had a prayer meeting before we
[7:41] went live and just showed how the
[7:42] supreme court did uphold texas is a
[7:45] anti-abortion law and so it's been over
[7:47] a week now so think about that over 700
[7:50] babies likely have been saved
[7:52] maybe eight days now maybe eight days
[7:55] so in the summer there's hundreds of
[7:57] babies now that have been saved because
[7:59] we're praying and not just us some
[8:01] people have been praying for decades
[8:02] church some of those evangelical
[8:04] christians have been praying since the
[8:05] 70s because it was in 1972
[8:08] when abortion became legal by a five to
[8:10] four vote brother fi it wasn't even
[8:12] unanimous five to four
[8:14] they paid these people off
[8:16] probably to to murder 62 million
[8:19] babies what a shame
[8:21] but the prayer of the saints availeth
[8:23] much praise god
[8:24] remember god can't force anybody to do
[8:26] anything right he can't force these
[8:28] people but when he hears when when our
[8:31] hearts all line up with the will of god
[8:33] god can move mountains praise god when
[8:35] we find ourselves in the will of god so
[8:37] let's keep praying let's keep believing
[8:39] uh uh it's our god wants to hear our
[8:42] voices as a witness against the
[8:43] wickedness praise god he wants to hear
[8:45] our voices and they'll be recorded on
[8:48] that day that we were the ones signing
[8:50] and crying how many know the scripture
[8:51] ezekiel 9 right first peter chapter 2
[8:54] judgment begins at the house of god amen
[8:57] he begins first here he wants to hear
[8:59] your voice he wants to hear my voice
[9:02] crying out against all the wickedness
[9:03] and god will use that on the day of
[9:05] judgment
[9:06] amen praise god they could switch over i
[9:08] got some slides not a whole lot didn't
[9:09] get a whole lot of uh well i guess i did
[9:11] get i have some leftover i guess from
[9:13] last time so
[9:14] uh so we'll look at this now
[9:18] so let's look at unique boundaries and
[9:20] ministries you know we uh
[9:23] we we didn't get quite to this two
[9:26] sundays ago when we were
[9:28] together here so i'd like to continue uh
[9:30] with some thoughts and i trust there'll
[9:32] be a blessing here to you so we read our
[9:34] text here and we're finishing chapter
[9:36] 15. now look at uh
[9:39] chapter
[9:40] 15 verse 63 again as for the jebusites
[9:43] the inhabitants of jerusalem the
[9:45] children of judah could not drive them
[9:47] out
[9:48] think about that
[9:50] the walls of jericho came down
[9:53] five years earlier right
[9:57] the five kings were defeated by joshua
[10:01] they had these amazing victories ai was
[10:03] defeated by the ambush the mighty ambush
[10:06] right
[10:07] all these mighty victories but for some
[10:09] reason
[10:10] judah could not drive out the jebusites
[10:15] praise god
[10:17] and the bible said that the jebusites
[10:19] then dwelled with them
[10:23] at with the children of jew to add
[10:24] jerusalem unto that day
[10:27] so we know that this falls in in line
[10:30] with three more agency right we let's go
[10:32] back and just rehearse a little bit
[10:34] remember god told joshua god the bible
[10:37] records that joshua did everything god
[10:38] told him to do
[10:40] right now we know that's uh
[10:43] that's not every single thing in
[10:45] joshua's life for example joshua still
[10:47] sinned every day just like you do
[10:49] right and fell short of the glory of god
[10:51] is that right
[10:52] so god kind of summarizes it like like
[10:55] abraham right he staggered not at the
[10:57] promise of god but did abraham stagger
[10:58] yes but the blood forgives him for the
[11:00] staggering amen praise god so we
[11:03] understand josh and remember josh had at
[11:05] least two mistakes
[11:07] right ai
[11:08] he didn't pray before going up
[11:10] and then gibeon he got deceived there
[11:12] so he at least two mistakes so god when
[11:15] he says joshua was obedient in all and
[11:18] drove out all we understand that's for
[11:20] through forgiveness right
[11:22] because not every uh every day did he
[11:25] live
[11:26] sinless wouldn't that be awesome to go a
[11:29] whole day without sinning
[11:31] oh what a what a peace we could have if
[11:33] we could lay down at the end of the day
[11:34] and say thank you lord i didn't think
[11:35] one evil thing all day
[11:37] i didn't say one evil thing i i didn't
[11:39] get i was patient all day
[11:41] oh my that'd be a that'd be a victory
[11:43] for me
[11:44] especially at school with all those a
[11:45] million questions every day
[11:48] and people spilling things all over me
[11:50] and hitting me and knocking things on me
[11:53] you know how silly things are
[11:55] but
[11:57] so we see that's you know kind of like
[11:58] through grace in other words joshua did
[12:01] everything through grace
[12:03] just like david kept all the commands
[12:05] except the one about bathsheba right and
[12:07] uriah of course we know he's sinned
[12:09] constantly right he was constantly
[12:11] sinning but constantly going for grace
[12:14] so did abraham constantly sin he was a
[12:17] man who who was under sin nature right
[12:20] so we see why god allowed this type to
[12:23] be this way
[12:25] israel was never going to drive out all
[12:27] the sin nature can i say like that
[12:30] amen you and i will never drive out all
[12:33] this to nature praise god
[12:35] but the majority of it should be driven
[12:38] out praise god amen it's impossible to
[12:41] drive out all of it
[12:43] right because that would have to be the
[12:45] lord's day then right
[12:47] you need a new land amen you need a new
[12:49] body amen right the lord's day is when
[12:52] man's day is over armageddon
[12:54] so there won't be the lord's day there
[12:56] won't be total dominion until the fire
[12:58] of god comes down amen
[13:01] the total uh fire of god
[13:03] volcanic ash or the atomic fire whatever
[13:06] god uses holy fire to burn all the uh
[13:10] the the outside of the earth right not
[13:13] destroy it but renovate it praise god
[13:15] amen and then we walk out on the ashes
[13:18] of the wicked praise god amen and think
[13:21] even after that there's going to be
[13:22] heathens that are left over there's
[13:23] gonna but they're not gonna sin because
[13:25] there's no tempter amen
[13:27] hallelujah praise god amen
[13:29] what a type so just like judah couldn't
[13:32] drive out everybody church
[13:34] so it is for you and i we can't quite
[13:37] drive out all of our enemies
[13:39] but we thank god for the great victories
[13:42] he's given us and we won't stop fighting
[13:45] until we drive out everything that's
[13:47] possible praise god
[13:49] so god can look at our lives and say
[13:51] williams stagger not at the promise of
[13:53] god amen
[13:54] so god can look at your life in my life
[13:57] in all of our lives and say they didn't
[13:58] stagger they had faith in god they never
[14:01] gave up they were under the blood they
[14:03] were children of faith amen hallelujah
[14:06] just like abraham amen
[14:08] i'll be honest i staggered at the
[14:10] promise of god about abortion right
[14:12] because i just thought well now this
[14:13] never happened well
[14:15] here i stand corrected amen right but by
[14:18] the blood the bible says i staggered
[14:19] none amen because now i'm rejoicing and
[14:22] praying more amen
[14:24] and even tonight we're sighing and
[14:26] crying i was maybe some of you or to
[14:28] praise the lord if not you will sometime
[14:30] right you're sighing and crying for the
[14:31] abominations on the city and that's the
[14:34] sign that the mark of god is on you
[14:37] oh my thank god amen
[14:40] it's so true
[14:42] so it's a beautiful type
[14:44] even judah even praise right judah
[14:46] represents praise
[14:48] right and judah was the ruler the bible
[14:51] remember they prophesied uh israel
[14:53] prophesied over his sons and judah would
[14:55] be the ruler he'd rule over the rest
[14:57] because of christ so judah represents
[14:59] the praise and represents ruling and
[15:02] ultimately the messiah to come so even
[15:06] even judah this great massive tribe with
[15:08] the lion they had the lion banner amen
[15:11] even the lion anointing saints right
[15:13] even them they even not even them
[15:15] couldn't get every single victory
[15:18] paul said i want to do good but evil is
[15:19] right there so and then i do what i hate
[15:22] right he said but thanks be to god who
[15:24] gives us the victory he said oh wretched
[15:26] man i am but thanks god thanks be to god
[15:28] who gives us the victory through our
[15:29] lord jesus christ amen he was looking
[15:31] for a new body he was looking for a more
[15:34] strength he was looking for him he was
[15:35] looking for eternal peace with god amen
[15:38] he's looking for the final victory amen
[15:40] and that victory was death amen
[15:42] hallelujah because death had no sting
[15:44] praise god amen jesus had taken the
[15:46] sting of death right and death was just
[15:49] a doorway to the total victory amen
[15:52] that's right church so we see here
[15:56] it's a beautiful type that many
[15:58] victories will be won in our lives but
[16:01] not all of them like brotherhood says
[16:02] satan will always have a punch on you
[16:05] right
[16:07] but it was even said brother william i'm
[16:08] sure you're aware of this that at 88
[16:10] years old john wesley said i suffered
[16:14] none of the effects of old age at 88
[16:17] years old and that reminded me of caleb
[16:19] at 85.
[16:21] church that there so that that proves
[16:23] and we proved that last year when we
[16:24] preached on blessings and cursings
[16:25] remember that all the blessings and
[16:27] curses of the old testament carry over
[16:29] to the new
[16:30] right if you let sin in your house evil
[16:33] is going to happen
[16:34] right if you murder evil things are
[16:36] going to be cursed right if you lie
[16:38] you're going to be cursed
[16:39] and the same thing was true look at that
[16:41] an old testament example caleb he
[16:44] followed god with all of his heart
[16:46] praise god
[16:47] and he was still strong in 85 and here
[16:49] we have john wesley he traveled over 40
[16:52] 000 miles by horse
[16:55] preached thousands and thousands of
[16:57] sermons and here he is with the baptism
[16:59] of the holy ghost
[17:00] at 88 he's just as strong as he was when
[17:03] he was 40 amen
[17:05] because the blessing of god rested on
[17:07] his life and you remember his last words
[17:10] he was dying and he was passing over in
[17:12] the net the next dimension and his last
[17:14] words he said it twice he said the best
[17:17] part of all
[17:18] is god is with us he said it one more
[17:20] time it was as he slipped into death the
[17:23] best part of all is that god is with us
[17:26] amen
[17:27] thank god we just visited the methodist
[17:29] church right and now we know god's with
[17:31] us amen
[17:32] the best part is god is with the
[17:34] revelation of the
[17:38] amen
[17:39] god left the methodist church shortly
[17:41] after that
[17:42] right because they denominated and died
[17:45] 150 years later azusa street revival
[17:47] they had god with them
[17:49] well then the two denominations rose up
[17:51] trinity and oneness right
[17:53] that rose up i'm sorry not trinity it
[17:55] was already there
[17:56] oneness and tongues as evidence rose up
[17:59] after that and then god moved on shortly
[18:01] after that to the ministry of brother
[18:02] branham
[18:04] 1906 and then 1933 both rams started
[18:06] pastoring and 46 he went in the
[18:07] worldwide revival so just look at that
[18:10] you know we'd say about 30 years after
[18:12] right 30 40 years after that initial
[18:15] revival god moved out of those
[18:16] denominations he gave them space to
[18:17] repent but they repented not and then
[18:20] god went into the prophetic ministry of
[18:22] brother branham and here we are today
[18:24] the life of god is with us we've seen it
[18:26] we're witnesses of it right we've seen
[18:28] seven churches the life of god is here
[18:30] as we saw on the weekend the word of god
[18:32] is preaching faith and power the people
[18:34] have genuine joy they have genuine
[18:37] excitement they have genuine trust and
[18:39] genuine faith in god almighty and we
[18:41] have the prince of god with us thank god
[18:43] the best part is christ is here amen
[18:46] hallelujah
[18:48] maybe next time i'll take a video
[18:50] because i can show you that christ is
[18:51] not in some of these denominations
[18:53] he's not in any of them amen
[18:55] uh but the best part is
[18:57] that if we're obedient the blessings of
[19:00] god will follow our lives naturally and
[19:03] spiritually amen
[19:05] that's what he was saying that's what
[19:06] brother dicks were saying on on the
[19:08] weekend god could bless you with a house
[19:10] or a car or something like that but even
[19:12] if he doesn't he'll bless you
[19:13] spiritually for sure
[19:15] because he said every spiritual blessing
[19:17] is given to you and i in christ jesus
[19:20] amen
[19:21] hallelujah
[19:22] and i'll be honest for me i'd rather
[19:25] have the abortion than a bigger house
[19:26] and a nice car right i give me that give
[19:29] me the victory of abortion any day i'll
[19:31] take that praise god
[19:33] but it just depends what you need right
[19:34] and what god has called you to have at
[19:35] that time
[19:36] right
[19:37] so we thank god for his word we thank
[19:39] god for the grace of god now
[19:42] i want you to see this here
[19:44] uh
[19:45] every person makes mistakes
[19:48] right paul
[19:50] we saw it we saw it from scripture paul
[19:52] said i finished my course i've
[19:54] accomplished everything god has asked me
[19:55] to do by grace
[19:58] right but we know he still made some
[20:00] mistakes i found a quote today from 1951
[20:02] brother and brother bran was giving his
[20:04] life story and he at the end he says oh
[20:07] how many
[20:08] souls did i miss because i didn't go out
[20:11] with the those original invitations from
[20:13] the pentecostals because of his
[20:14] mother-in-law
[20:16] right and remember i showed you as i was
[20:18] with moses in 1958 brotherhood said how
[20:21] many thousands of people did i not pray
[20:23] for because i was misusing my gift
[20:25] see no one's going to be perfect on that
[20:27] day you should say amen to that none of
[20:29] us are going to be able to say you know
[20:30] we did it perfectly or we drove out all
[20:32] the inhabitants but we can say i was
[20:35] more than a conqueror i overcame many
[20:38] obstacles and by the grace of god he
[20:40] helped me to do as much as i could do
[20:42] and i thank god for how he helped me and
[20:44] he gave me grace and i give back to
[20:46] jesus all the glory because of all the
[20:48] strength he gave me praise god
[20:51] amen
[20:54] i believe brother bran is a five-town
[20:55] preacher i believe he doubled his talent
[20:57] praise god
[20:58] because he's the star for the age but
[21:00] yet he looked at his own life and could
[21:02] say i failed and thousands were impacted
[21:07] but think of the millions that were
[21:08] blessed
[21:10] don't forget that they're still being
[21:11] blessed today
[21:12] hallelujah every time you put on a
[21:14] sermon from brother braham and get a
[21:15] blessing hallelujah look we're still
[21:17] getting blessed today amen the truth is
[21:20] still marching on amen
[21:22] hallelujah
[21:26] so see
[21:27] we have to understand that
[21:30] that we're all going to
[21:32] fall short of the glory of god
[21:35] and
[21:36] we're not going to drive out absolutely
[21:38] everything in our lives
[21:39] we're still going to have
[21:41] battles okay
[21:43] but i want to remind you too that there
[21:44] was three kinds of christians remember
[21:46] that chart i showed you there were some
[21:47] that were a 30-fold
[21:50] so they multiplied times 30. there were
[21:52] some that were 60 fold they multiplied
[21:54] times 60
[21:55] or there are some that were 100 fold
[21:57] they multiplied times a hundred
[21:59] we saw this year we planted some uh
[22:01] potatoes and man there was a major
[22:03] harvest we had 90 pounds of potatoes at
[22:05] our house
[22:06] talk about mashed potatoes coming up
[22:08] brother
[22:09] we're gonna have some mashed potatoes
[22:11] we invite you guys over
[22:13] i have to talk to my wife about that
[22:15] but last year we planted them we didn't
[22:17] get that kind of return
[22:19] see every siege is a little different
[22:20] praise god and also like the brother
[22:22] said it depends on what kind of
[22:24] conditions you put it in
[22:25] depends if it gets enough water right
[22:27] sometimes the season
[22:29] so that's how our lives are right
[22:31] if we invest in and we really treat that
[22:33] seed word of god if we really water that
[22:35] seed amen and keep it in the sunlight of
[22:38] god's knowledge it will produce
[22:40] graciously amen
[22:42] it'll multiply abundantly but part of
[22:44] the part of it is dna part of it is the
[22:47] c dna and then part of it is the
[22:49] conditions praise god that nature versus
[22:51] nurture argument
[22:53] right but it needs both in church the
[22:55] word of god needs both of ours the bible
[22:58] said we must mix the word with faith
[23:00] amen
[23:01] israel couldn't inherit many blessings
[23:03] because they didn't mix it with faith
[23:05] they didn't have the human element god
[23:07] help us to surrender the human element
[23:09] to be diligent with the word to water
[23:11] the word with praise and see a
[23:13] multiplication of blessings
[23:15] amen
[23:17] hallelujah
[23:20] thank the lord that's what i think we'll
[23:22] see through the book brother if we can
[23:24] get that book to enough people think
[23:25] about the multiplication of just solid
[23:28] rock foundation it would do to them
[23:30] right think about what to do it would it
[23:32] would uh get out all it would keep them
[23:34] from false doctrines like on the seals
[23:36] or on the return ministry or all kinds
[23:38] of things like that it would take him
[23:40] away from that and it will point them
[23:41] right to thus saith the lord praise god
[23:44] oh church remember brother said many
[23:45] times we don't know the impact of our
[23:47] testimony we may not know it till over
[23:50] there
[23:51] ah help us to labor for the master from
[23:54] the dawn till setting sun amen and talk
[23:57] of all his wondrous love and care amen
[24:00] and when the rose called up yonder we'll
[24:01] be there praise god amen
[24:04] so see we must labor
[24:06] but everyone's going to fall short
[24:09] no one's going to possess all the land
[24:13] but remember church like i want to
[24:14] mention this too
[24:16] can i say it like this but thank god
[24:18] we're in the land
[24:20] there was a there was two and a half
[24:22] tribes that purposely chose to stay out
[24:25] of the land
[24:26] because they like the land outside on
[24:28] the uh the the north the east of the
[24:32] river jordan they liked that land better
[24:35] than the promised land
[24:36] it was safer
[24:38] less battles
[24:40] oh but that wasn't the faith of caleb
[24:42] amen that wasn't the face of joshua
[24:44] praise god in fact church those two and
[24:46] a half tribes type out the foolish
[24:48] virgin
[24:49] don't they
[24:51] they went in the land they fought they
[24:52] helped out the bride but they chose to
[24:55] live outside on purpose
[24:57] hallelujah didn't remember when 12 spies
[25:00] went in the land they went in the land
[25:03] that's like what paul said but paul said
[25:05] they tasted of it but then they didn't
[25:07] stay in it amen oh but thank god church
[25:10] we may fail we may not drive out
[25:12] everybody but thank god we're living in
[25:14] the word of god amen
[25:16] the word for this day hallelujah
[25:19] that we have crossed over in to the
[25:22] baptism of the holy ghost we're not
[25:24] staying in sanctification we've got a
[25:26] place we've got a permanent residence in
[25:28] christ amen
[25:30] in christ the word praise god
[25:33] that's where we have a permanent
[25:35] residence
[25:36] and god always gives you your choice
[25:39] i've heard this said before that you can
[25:41] have anything in life you want but not
[25:43] everything
[25:45] that's true
[25:46] you can have anything in life but you
[25:49] can't have everything
[25:51] so what do we have to choose we've got
[25:52] to choose christ
[25:55] choose the thing in other words say the
[25:56] thing i want most is to know i'm born
[25:59] again and living in the land and
[26:01] overcoming and fighting this battle in
[26:03] the army of the lord that's what i want
[26:06] most in life so that's what i want to
[26:07] get
[26:08] amen if you miss everything else that's
[26:11] fine you got the most important thing
[26:13] amen
[26:15] you had your priorities first you sought
[26:17] first the kingdom of god and his
[26:19] righteousness and now everything else
[26:21] will be added unto you
[26:23] amen
[26:25] so we have to choose church to be in the
[26:27] promised land
[26:29] praise god it's a choice
[26:31] all those people that
[26:33] will come up as foolish version of the
[26:34] white or
[26:35] white throne judgment they're all going
[26:37] it's gonna be played before him on a
[26:38] screen how they had a chance to hear it
[26:41] those preachers we visited they're gonna
[26:43] have a chance
[26:44] they're gonna they're gonna show it if
[26:46] the brothers even opened it or just
[26:47] threw it away they're gonna show it
[26:49] we're gonna watch it brother
[26:50] they're going to show us right there
[26:52] singing and
[26:53] praising the lord and
[26:55] turning down their communion
[26:57] because they were you should have saw
[26:59] they had communion they're just they're
[27:00] just all laughing just like brother man
[27:02] talked about they were all laughing
[27:03] going up to take communion this should
[27:04] be the most sacred thing in the church
[27:07] and they're like you guys want to go i'm
[27:08] like no no thanks nothing and i
[27:10] whispered at brother william i said it's
[27:12] just not it's just not sincere
[27:14] i said it's just like brother branham
[27:15] said popping chewing gum going up to the
[27:17] altar laughing and joking that's what it
[27:19] was i saw them laughing going up to take
[27:21] communion church that's not how we take
[27:23] communion communion is fellowship
[27:25] communion is examining yourself and
[27:27] talking to god saying god have mercy on
[27:29] me and help me god to live the blessing
[27:31] of this help me to really represent a
[27:33] christian amen
[27:36] it's not a joke
[27:38] it's not a comedy club that's sometimes
[27:40] what churches feel like it's not a
[27:42] comedy club but it's a judgment seat
[27:45] it's a courtroom praise god amen where
[27:47] you get the right judgment you hear the
[27:49] the judgments of the king of kings amen
[27:53] you like brother dick said the advocate
[27:55] he reminded us of the advocate he's a
[27:56] helper she does something we can't do we
[27:59] get to hear the decisions of the
[28:01] advocate amen what jesus says about us
[28:04] what jesus promises to us amen how he
[28:07] fights for us and he's our high priest
[28:10] he's our mediator he's the one standing
[28:12] in the gap for us he will lead us all
[28:14] the way amen
[28:19] oh glory
[28:22] now i got numerous thoughts here
[28:25] she got about half hour
[28:28] let me uh let me start with this here
[28:31] and i don't think i have a slide on this
[28:33] no i don't think i do
[28:39] yeah i you know let me uh let's see
[28:41] maybe i'll just get into paul's life
[28:42] here let me see
[28:44] i had so many different thoughts i
[28:45] wasn't quite sure which direction i like
[28:46] to take it okay yeah let's go with
[28:48] paul's life here
[28:49] okay
[28:50] we'll just yeah we'll try to look at
[28:52] paul here tonight by god's grace okay
[28:54] chapter 16. now here's the outline the
[28:56] church we're not going to read most of
[28:58] this okay
[29:00] it's a very short chapter chapter 16 is
[29:02] a very short chapter verses one to four
[29:05] show the general borders of the sons of
[29:07] joseph ephraim and manasseh the ones
[29:10] that were inside the promised land not
[29:11] the the two and a half that were out
[29:13] right
[29:14] and then verses five to nine is the
[29:16] borders of the ephraimites
[29:18] now look at verse 10 go to 16 verse 10.
[29:20] this directly applies with what we were
[29:22] just preaching earlier that we're not
[29:25] going to be able to possess everything
[29:27] right we'll never we still have to live
[29:29] in this pest house brother branham says
[29:31] right uh joshua 16 10.
[29:39] do you see a pattern here church i hope
[29:40] you're seeing a pattern
[29:42] oh look look every tribe there's no
[29:44] tribe that possessed every part of the
[29:46] land
[29:47] there's no holy ghost christian who gets
[29:49] everything perfect in life
[29:52] let me say that again
[29:53] there's no message believer who gets
[29:55] everything perfect in life
[29:58] that ought to make somebody happy
[30:00] right joshua 16 verse 10
[30:02] and they drave not out ephraimites and
[30:05] they drained that out the canaanites
[30:07] that dwell in gazir
[30:10] but the canaanites dwell among the
[30:11] ephraimites unto this day and serve
[30:13] under
[30:13] tribute
[30:16] so sometimes brother william we allow
[30:18] sin in our lives to make because it
[30:20] gives us a little bit of monetary gain
[30:23] right sometimes holy ghost-filled people
[30:26] will make certain deals
[30:29] or live a little more comfortable than
[30:30] they should
[30:34] they should drive out that selfishness
[30:37] they should possess the gate of
[30:39] selfishness and give more alms
[30:41] and the church said
[30:44] but they let that little selfishness
[30:46] hang in there
[30:48] because it's a financial gain
[30:51] they hear about the brother who needs
[30:53] something but they just oh well god will
[30:54] provide somehow well that was you that
[30:56] was supposed to provide
[30:58] you should have drove out the canaanites
[31:01] praise god
[31:03] so see everyone it goes and now you'll
[31:05] see this pattern all through the rest of
[31:06] the book of joshua through chapter 24.
[31:09] it lists all the tribes but then it
[31:10] always says they failed to drive out
[31:12] this they failed to drive out that
[31:15] as much as you love our church and as
[31:17] much as my children i love our church
[31:19] we're not perfect
[31:21] i'm not perfect i'm going to fall short
[31:23] of the glory sometime i'm going to miss
[31:25] you every day i fall short of the glory
[31:28] you're going to look at me and say well
[31:29] he probably made the wrong decision
[31:30] there you're probably right i'm not
[31:32] going to be perfect i'm not going to
[31:33] drive everything out but i'm hoping at
[31:36] some point i can drive out the major
[31:38] things the most important things i can
[31:40] drive them out and be more than a
[31:41] conqueror and be a real victor a real
[31:44] warrior in the army of god amen
[31:46] i know already there's many things god
[31:48] has helped me to drive out
[31:50] of my life that i see other christians
[31:52] don't drive out
[31:56] i could name a few things here but
[31:58] like sports
[32:00] right or entertainment god has helped me
[32:02] drive out those temptations
[32:05] right
[32:08] money as well riches and things like
[32:10] that
[32:10] god has helped me to drive out
[32:12] selfishness amen
[32:15] and you know the ones that you've driven
[32:16] out that you can see message people
[32:18] maybe haven't driven that out
[32:20] so the thing is not to be critical but
[32:22] to realize
[32:23] lord i'm gonna need your help to drive
[32:24] out more out of my life i'll never have
[32:26] it totally gone until i get a new land
[32:28] hey
[32:29] hallelujah i get a new body praise god
[32:32] but help me to drive out help me to
[32:34] possess all the promises of god for they
[32:36] are yes and amen
[32:39] hallelujah
[32:40] now that's verse 10.
[32:43] so see church remember they had all this
[32:45] land but
[32:46] the the green was not yet possessed but
[32:49] this was all theirs this was all theirs
[32:52] but they didn't possess everything
[32:55] they had so much land there there was so
[32:57] much potential can i say this there's so
[32:59] much potential for you
[33:01] amen
[33:02] children there's so much potential in
[33:04] your lives amen
[33:06] if you really get a warrior's mindset
[33:08] amen if you really get dedicated to the
[33:10] lord god you'll drive out so much land
[33:13] or so many enemies out of your land
[33:15] you'll possess so many gates praise god
[33:17] you have such victory people want to be
[33:19] like you amen
[33:22] hallelujah thank god
[33:25] but it's
[33:27] it's all up to you
[33:28] we're going to see that later in chapter
[33:30] 18. there's a powerful story
[33:32] where the
[33:34] manasseh comes up one of joseph's sons
[33:38] and they're like
[33:39] give us more land
[33:40] and
[33:41] josh was like why don't wh what do you
[33:43] mean you already have all this land he
[33:45] said i know but he said a lot of them
[33:46] have iron chariots on it and joshua's
[33:49] like
[33:50] drive him out
[33:52] right so they're see they got
[33:55] comfortable they've been in the land
[33:56] five or seven years and they got
[33:58] comfortable and they didn't want to
[34:00] fight like they did at the beginning
[34:01] amen god help us to fight no like we did
[34:05] when we first got the holy ghost amen
[34:08] not not quit and not make excuses but if
[34:11] it's ours to possess let's do something
[34:13] about it let's be conquerors let's have
[34:15] some victories let's bring a testimony
[34:17] to church amen hallelujah
[34:21] and i shared with you my testimony
[34:22] tonight praise god amen
[34:24] god has to encourage me
[34:27] and god is faithful to hear our prayers
[34:28] amen
[34:32] remember you don't have to do whatever
[34:33] you say church
[34:35] that's what i was trying to balance out
[34:36] remember on sunday when i came up here
[34:38] you can speak whatever you want but you
[34:39] better make sure it's god's word first
[34:42] whether you're speaking a house or car
[34:43] children health whatever you're speaking
[34:45] make sure it's god's word first
[34:47] because if not it's just your hopes
[34:49] that's okay hope is good
[34:51] hope faith are good but charity is
[34:53] better
[34:55] love of god is better the love of god
[34:57] the will of god is best amen
[35:00] so make sure we're speaking by
[35:01] revelation amen
[35:04] all right
[35:05] so see we we see the unique borders in
[35:08] verses one through nine and in verse 10
[35:09] as i already said we see the type of
[35:11] enjoying financial gains of
[35:14] compromise you knew you should have
[35:17] given but i'll let that one stay so i
[35:19] can get some some financial blessing off
[35:21] that one
[35:24] most of all the thing i think it is is
[35:26] mostly offerings and alms most people
[35:28] pay their tithes in the message or else
[35:29] we wouldn't have churches
[35:31] right
[35:32] but the sin i see amongst people is they
[35:34] don't pay any offerings and they don't
[35:36] pay or they don't give alms to the poor
[35:39] they just say oh they're not believers
[35:41] i'm not going to worry about them no you
[35:42] should worry about them you should do
[35:44] anything you can to help out a poor
[35:45] person that's what the bible says if you
[35:48] see them and meet them and don't do
[35:49] anything for them your faith is really
[35:50] struggling james will he might even
[35:52] argue and say your faith is dead
[35:54] i think that's what he would say right
[35:56] because that's what the bible says
[35:58] so see i believe holy ghost filled
[36:00] message people can do that too
[36:02] they can compromise for financial gain
[36:04] because they're trusting in some money
[36:06] rather than the word of god
[36:09] i think we've all seen
[36:10] that i think if we're honest with
[36:12] ourselves
[36:15] now so verses 1 to 10
[36:18] are the unique borders and it's the
[36:19] borders of ephraim
[36:25] let's just look at verse six okay let's
[36:26] just for an example
[36:28] verse six sixteen verse six and the
[36:30] border went out toward the sea to
[36:33] mitch metha on the north side but and
[36:35] the border went out eastward unto
[36:38] tai nath shiloh and passed it on the
[36:40] east by
[36:41] uh jan ha genoha and it went down from
[36:44] genoha to atorath and to nara and come
[36:46] to jericho and out to jordan so see it
[36:48] chases it from the sea over to jericho
[36:52] so here if we can get there from the sea
[36:54] over to jericho ah where's jericho
[37:00] every map changes a little bit there's
[37:02] jericho okay he's giving us the the land
[37:04] here of the e for mines
[37:06] so it's
[37:07] showing their borders and notice
[37:09] everyone was a little different right
[37:12] every border was unique
[37:14] there was no cookie-cutter borders
[37:18] so you could have holy ghost-filled
[37:20] people in the land but everybody's
[37:22] ministry was a little unique
[37:25] none of the borders were exactly the
[37:27] same
[37:28] because god likes variety amen
[37:30] hallelujah praise god amen
[37:34] that's why aren't you glad there's
[37:35] different kinds of preachers aren't you
[37:36] glad they're not all like me
[37:38] oh man
[37:39] we'd be really sad
[37:41] thank god there's some like brother
[37:42] diggs and brother cam and brother brooks
[37:44] and all the brothers that brother randy
[37:46] each one has a different gift right
[37:48] each one has a unique kind of ministry
[37:51] but they're all needed they're all part
[37:53] of the land they're all victors they all
[37:55] give us strength they all feed our souls
[37:58] they all edify us strengthen us and they
[38:00] establish us in the faith
[38:03] that's what the bible said paul went
[38:05] around brother establishing them that
[38:07] means making them stronger amen i come
[38:10] here tonight to make you guys stronger
[38:12] amen i'm here tonight and you're going
[38:14] to make me stronger right because we we
[38:16] encourage each other in love so while i
[38:18] strengthen you you strengthen me we're
[38:20] here to get stronger not to die get
[38:22] weaker not to give up and compromise but
[38:25] to keep driving out the canaanites
[38:28] amen praise god that's what real
[38:30] soldiers of the cross do praise god
[38:32] they strengthen them so they can go back
[38:34] to the battle
[38:36] and say hey you know what i am i'm not
[38:38] done fighting that i'm going to go back
[38:40] to that
[38:41] i'm not going to quit amen i've got more
[38:43] strength i've got more encouragement
[38:45] praise god i'm going to go back and say
[38:47] i'm sorry amen
[38:49] and i'm going to drive out that guilt
[38:51] amen i'm going to drive out that
[38:53] unbelief or that fear that i had i'm
[38:55] going to go back and humble myself and
[38:57] that's really winning the victory praise
[39:00] god
[39:01] not letting that devil of guilt
[39:04] right and fear
[39:05] am i going to lose a reward or what's
[39:07] going to happen on judgment day oh no
[39:09] i'm going to take the sword of the word
[39:11] of god and cut through every enemy until
[39:13] i get back to my sincerity
[39:16] amen
[39:18] praise god
[39:19] i'm not going to retreat and sit at home
[39:21] and do nothing about it i'm going to
[39:22] fight the enemy off
[39:24] see church this is a great a great
[39:27] beautiful type that we have here in the
[39:28] scripture
[39:30] now
[39:32] so let's see these you know these unique
[39:34] rather unique borders type the unique
[39:36] ministries of the new testament saints
[39:39] and there's none better to start with
[39:41] than saint paul
[39:42] because if anybody had the holy ghost it
[39:44] was that guy
[39:45] he used to blaspheme jesus he used to
[39:48] put his word
[39:50] for people to be martyred uh for jesus
[39:53] he tried to get people to to lie and
[39:55] defy jesus but then he comes on the
[39:57] other side now he's begging them to
[39:59] accept jesus amen and then he gives his
[40:02] life for jesus amen hallelujah
[40:06] he said i'm willing to be bound think
[40:07] about that brother william he never even
[40:09] he never even fought against the chains
[40:11] i'm willing to go bound to jerusalem to
[40:14] die for i'm sorry to rome to die for the
[40:16] one who died for me amen hallelujah
[40:20] that's a real man of god right there
[40:22] saint paul everybody knew he was a
[40:24] a resurrected believer
[40:26] he was dead but now he's alive
[40:29] he did not fear death hallelujah
[40:31] now let's look at paul here tonight i
[40:33] think it'd be good just to look at
[40:36] paul now
[40:38] church paul
[40:40] had all preaching gifts i believe i can
[40:43] prove this by the bible
[40:44] and the message
[40:46] i believe i can
[40:47] i believe he had all five preaching
[40:49] gifts that wouldn't surprise anybody
[40:50] because brother branham said martin
[40:52] luther had all nine gifts of the spirit
[40:55] right so if you can have all nine gifts
[40:58] the gifts couldn't you have all five
[41:00] preaching gifts
[41:01] yes
[41:02] because there's a thing called times and
[41:05] seasons
[41:06] hallelujah there's this thing in
[41:08] scripture called a time a convenient
[41:10] season there's a time glory for
[41:13] everything under the sun amen
[41:15] for every need there's some time of your
[41:18] life for that need to be played out and
[41:21] for that need to be met praise god
[41:23] under the sun
[41:26] there's a time for everything there's a
[41:28] time to overcome
[41:29] there's a time to be humbled there's a
[41:30] time to be strengthened there's a time
[41:32] to be victorious right there's a time to
[41:34] fail
[41:35] there's a time to do all these there's
[41:36] time to do outreach there's time to
[41:38] raise the children
[41:40] amen
[41:41] there's a time for everything if you
[41:43] just place everything in those nail
[41:45] scarred hands he'll make sure he lines
[41:47] up everything to make sure you can do
[41:49] all or you've done all that god's called
[41:51] you to do
[41:52] amen
[41:56] remember there's people that lose their
[41:58] reward
[41:59] well that means there's people that
[42:00] don't lose their reward right jesus said
[42:03] to the church ages he said be careful
[42:05] that no man take your crime well that
[42:07] means somebody could take your crown if
[42:08] you don't take your responsibility
[42:10] somebody could take yours but it also
[42:11] means i can take mine
[42:14] and i can do what god's called me to do
[42:15] and i can rule as a kingdom priest when
[42:18] others don't i can be a king and priest
[42:20] praise god i can fulfill my role as as
[42:23] christ has called me to do and i can and
[42:26] i can win the crown when the battle is
[42:28] over we'll wear a crown in the new
[42:30] jerusalem praise god i didn't lose the
[42:32] crown but i gained it hallelujah by
[42:34] obeying what the holy spirit told me to
[42:36] do
[42:38] in church i'll say it like this i'll go
[42:39] to heaven like this i've never heard a
[42:40] voice of the holy spirit audible and i
[42:43] may have to go to heaven as that that
[42:44] type of witness but i heard the holy
[42:46] spirit in here
[42:48] like moses the bible said it came upon
[42:50] moses's heart he felt it upon his heart
[42:52] to visit the children of israel amen
[42:55] how did of course he saw visions and he
[42:57] saw he heard the voice of god he speak
[42:59] he spoke lift the ear with god but also
[43:02] that leaves room for you and i if we
[43:03] don't hear visions if we don't see these
[43:05] things that's fine as long as we hear
[43:07] the word in our souls amen
[43:09] that's the most important thing that
[43:11] still small voice amen surrendering to
[43:14] that leading of the holy spirit praise
[43:16] god
[43:17] amen i'll go to heaven as a witness to
[43:19] that
[43:20] i never had jesus visit me in a physical
[43:22] body although i love that i pray that
[43:24] many times
[43:26] this week i was looking out the windows
[43:27] looking i wonder i think i was on sunday
[43:29] night i was like lord i would love to
[43:30] see an angel tonight that was really
[43:32] sincere i was like lord i'm up washing
[43:34] dishes a little late you know
[43:36] i don't know that i'm saturday night
[43:38] that's certainly i said lord i'd love to
[43:39] see an angel
[43:41] so i'm just keeping out there i keep
[43:43] looking out there but maybe if i never
[43:44] see it that's fine because i've heard it
[43:46] in here
[43:48] i've heard the voice of god in here
[43:50] the pull i felt the pull praise god
[43:52] amen uh the bible said you got the
[43:55] unction from the holy one there it is
[43:56] amen how did you felt the unction you
[43:59] felt the leading you felt the
[44:00] inspiration to follow god's word amen
[44:05] and that makes all the difference for
[44:06] every time and every season of your life
[44:11] now
[44:12] let me try to prove this to you that
[44:13] paul had all five preaching gifts and
[44:16] you you can frequently rotate between
[44:18] them
[44:19] now this was true for brother branham
[44:20] brother brand thought he was the old
[44:21] testament prophet remember the holy
[44:22] spirit corrected him and said no you're
[44:23] an apostolic prophet
[44:25] and you have many gifts that angel told
[44:27] him
[44:28] and that's what you can see in brother
[44:30] adam's life he transitioned from pastor
[44:33] to evangelists but yet he was prophet
[44:36] all throughout that time too
[44:38] when he would speak thus saith the lord
[44:39] and prophesy now he step in the prophet
[44:41] roll
[44:42] and then he said now i'm going to teach
[44:43] on the church ages
[44:44] amen now i'm going to sit down and teach
[44:46] on the seven seals
[44:48] that's what he said praise god and then
[44:51] he was missionary going overseas to
[44:53] where there was no message churches
[44:55] right preaching the gospel showing the
[44:56] signs wonders and miracles
[44:58] so you can easily see it through brother
[45:01] branham's ministry if we just look and
[45:02] humble ourselves a little bit
[45:04] right
[45:05] and then look to the scripture
[45:07] to see how paul did it
[45:10] okay get your bibles here we'll probably
[45:11] just spend our time got about 10 minutes
[45:14] on this here
[45:15] let's see how many of these do i have
[45:17] one two
[45:21] three
[45:22] that first thessalonians four no
[45:26] okay we don't have to do that yeah
[45:28] well maybe we will okay lydia malcolm
[45:30] got your bible in case you can you read
[45:32] something
[45:35] okay
[45:36] paul was truly an apostle and the church
[45:38] said
[45:39] now he says both he says to this struck
[45:42] me years ago i'm like paul had to have
[45:44] more than one gift people people use the
[45:46] quotes from brother branham where they
[45:47] say oh you can only have one gift and
[45:49] don't don't leave your gift well they
[45:50] also forget the other quotes that
[45:52] brother brahm said
[45:53] he was constantly learning as well
[45:56] right where he said martin luther could
[45:57] have all nine gifts of the holy spirit
[45:59] abraham said women can have any of the
[46:01] nine gifts of the holy spirit
[46:03] any
[46:05] so this one verse has two of the five in
[46:08] it so you can't say you can only have
[46:09] one gift you can't say that
[46:12] whereunto i am ordained a preacher an
[46:14] apostle i speak the truth in christ and
[46:16] lie not a what a teacher of the gentiles
[46:20] so he's an apostle but once he got new
[46:22] converse what do you got to do to babies
[46:23] you got to teach him
[46:25] got to feed him right got to nurse him
[46:26] gotta give him food solids eventually
[46:28] once you get new converse now you're no
[46:30] longer apostle now you're the teacher
[46:32] amen praise god
[46:35] i teach the gentiles i instruct them in
[46:38] the truth of god
[46:42] now here's where paul is the uh the
[46:44] evangelist right here
[46:46] acts 15 36 do i have that up there yeah
[46:48] evangelist acts 15 36 uh lydia get first
[46:52] thessalonians 4
[46:54] 15 through 18. that's where he's prophet
[46:58] but let's read this one
[46:59] acts 15 36 and after some days paul said
[47:02] unto barnabas let us go again there it
[47:04] is again they're already believers and
[47:06] visit our brethren every city where we
[47:08] have preached the word of god and see
[47:10] how they do
[47:12] they weren't they weren't going to win
[47:14] new souls and now they might but that
[47:15] wasn't their goal their goal was to
[47:17] visit again the believers and stir them
[47:20] up the bible said in one verse he had
[47:22] actually established them in the faith
[47:25] paul went around establishing the
[47:27] churches that means strengthening let's
[47:29] look that up i got my uh concordance
[47:31] here real quick
[47:32] he and if you guys find it just shout it
[47:34] out here where's the scripture where in
[47:36] acts he established the saints
[47:41] i'll find it pretty soon here
[47:44] i just want you to see it so you got it
[47:48] yeah 16 verse 5 acts 16 verse 5.
[47:53] verse 4 says as they went through the
[47:54] cities they delivered the decrees for
[47:56] them to keep and were ordained that were
[47:58] ordained of the apostles and elders
[47:59] which were jerusalem and so the churches
[48:01] were established in the faith and
[48:03] increased in number daily amen
[48:07] how many believe apostle paul was an
[48:08] evangelist as well
[48:10] that's what the bible says
[48:12] he did the actual work of an evangelist
[48:14] he went back to establish churches and
[48:17] edified them or he
[48:19] established them in the truth all right
[48:21] now lydia do the a prophet one
[48:24] uh the rapture
[48:26] paul foretold the rapture not only here
[48:28] but also in first corinthians 15 right
[48:30] so lydia
[48:40] thursday
[48:57] amen remember verse 15 what does it say
[48:59] this we speak by the word of paul no
[49:02] this we speak by the word of the lord
[49:04] and this is it shall happen shout voice
[49:07] trump it shall this is foretelling the
[49:09] future this is prophecy this is thus
[49:12] saith the lord
[49:14] you'd be surprised
[49:16] some of the preachers that left the
[49:17] message they don't believe paul was a
[49:18] prophet like are you serious and they
[49:20] think they're so smart and they mock
[49:21] brother branham and you can't see a
[49:23] prophecy in the rapture then you're
[49:25] stone blind
[49:26] right then you now have received the
[49:28] reprobate mind because he foretold that
[49:31] event he foretold the falling away he
[49:33] throwed the deception he foretold the
[49:35] antichrist oh here comes amen this
[49:37] prophet just pouring out all these
[49:39] prophecy after prophecy because he was a
[49:41] prophet he foretold the future in the
[49:43] name of the lord
[49:46] so we know he's an apostle prophet
[49:48] teacher evangelist as well
[49:51] what's the last one
[49:53] well i'm sorry here's another one i'm
[49:54] sorry here's another one for evangelist
[49:56] and he went through the syrian sicilia
[49:58] confirming the churches that means to
[50:00] establish strengthen more to render more
[50:03] firms
[50:05] right making them stronger in the faith
[50:08] that's why he went to the church
[50:10] you ever seen a tree that's kind of like
[50:12] not strong
[50:13] it's getting blown over by the wind we
[50:14] see that at our house all the time
[50:16] what do you got to do you got to put a
[50:17] stake in the ground and then tie that
[50:19] tree up that's what paul was doing paul
[50:22] was going around putting stakes here
[50:24] promises in the word you just hang on to
[50:26] this promise amen
[50:28] hallelujah i'm gonna tie your soul to
[50:31] the promise of god amen
[50:33] and i'll make you stronger it'll
[50:35] strengthen you so you don't get blown
[50:37] over your life doesn't get you're not a
[50:39] castaway you're not left behind but you
[50:42] get stronger in the faith
[50:44] amen
[50:45] that was part of an evangelist ministry
[50:50] to make them more strong more firm in
[50:52] the faith
[50:55] praise god
[50:57] now here's the pastor scripture right
[50:59] yeah uh 20 acts 20 verse 31
[51:02] and i got a quote for this so people
[51:03] can't say that there's no quote
[51:05] so i've got scripture for the four and i
[51:08] got a quote for the fifth
[51:10] and i'll say like this i believe i have
[51:11] scripture for the fifth as well
[51:14] therefore watch and remember that by the
[51:16] space of three years i cease not to warn
[51:19] everyone night and day
[51:21] with tears
[51:23] now remember earlier in this chapter
[51:24] what was he saying he was saying feed
[51:26] the flock of god
[51:29] right because there's wolves going to
[51:31] come in that are not going to they're
[51:33] not going to
[51:34] they're not gonna care they're gonna
[51:36] scatter the flock
[51:38] and men of perverse minds will rise up
[51:40] among you
[51:41] right so what is he concerned he's
[51:43] concerned about the sheep the shepherd
[51:45] is concerned for the sheep amen
[51:48] for three years he fed their souls for
[51:50] 15 years god has had me feed the souls
[51:53] of these people it's been a blessing
[51:55] we've been feeding on sheep food amen
[51:57] growing stronger maturing drinking from
[52:00] still waters eating from green pastures
[52:02] amen hallelujah and we're not getting
[52:05] weaker compromising you know believing
[52:08] in return ministry or the joseph
[52:10] ministry or something like that or
[52:12] polygamy or something like that we're
[52:13] not compromising we're actually getting
[52:15] stronger
[52:18] in the word of god
[52:20] we're not compromising and if you think
[52:22] i'm compromising then come talk to me
[52:25] and tell me what you want to talk about
[52:26] so i can prepare my quotes and
[52:28] scriptures amen
[52:29] because we're going to have a scriptural
[52:30] debate hey man which is good it's a kind
[52:32] that's a kind thing to do you've seen me
[52:34] do it i can do it with a smile i can
[52:35] debate with a smile
[52:37] it's gotta fast and pray
[52:40] now that's already eight o'clock so let
[52:42] me try to finish here
[52:45] now here's where brother adam says an
[52:47] apostle is higher than a prophet
[52:50] now how many message believers believe
[52:51] this brother william
[52:53] very few
[52:54] because they say who's who's got more
[52:56] authority than brother branham
[52:58] right i understand what they're saying
[53:00] but they they don't understand the
[53:02] scripture there's no higher authority
[53:04] than thus saith the lord but in the
[53:06] makeup of the fivefold ministry the
[53:07] apostle has a higher calling than a
[53:10] prophet
[53:12] why can't they understand that because
[53:13] they're idol worshipers
[53:15] many of them
[53:16] brother ram's the highest nobody's
[53:18] higher than a prophet no well nobody's
[53:20] hiring the prophet for interpreting the
[53:21] word with thus saith the lord
[53:23] or prophesying with us saith the lord
[53:25] but in the apostolic church one person's
[53:27] higher the man who leaves everything
[53:29] behind and jesus said if you left family
[53:31] or mother or father or children or wife
[53:33] for my sake you have a hundred fold in
[53:35] this life and in the world to come amen
[53:38] amen
[53:39] and amen that apostle may never prophesy
[53:41] one thing but yet he's got a higher
[53:43] calling than the prophet
[53:46] but as far as thus saith the lord of
[53:48] course no one has a higher word than a
[53:49] prophet
[53:51] but in local order of the church
[53:54] nobody's higher than the apostle
[53:57] as the fightful ministry does everybody
[53:58] understand
[54:01] he's talking about judas right
[54:04] we ridicule judas we say he's filthy bad
[54:06] guy he's not fit for no place or no
[54:08] society isn't fit for heaven why he sold
[54:10] his lord after the opportunity to even
[54:12] be a disciple to be an apostle the
[54:14] highest calling in the bible higher than
[54:18] what
[54:21] higher than
[54:22] a they can't swallow that one
[54:27] they'll just say oh i just believe every
[54:28] words thus saith the lord
[54:32] because that's what they tell me
[54:34] they have no answer for that one
[54:36] but that's what the prophet said and
[54:38] that's how the prophet believed it
[54:40] the apostle has the highest calling in
[54:42] the bible
[54:44] and the prophet is shortly after that
[54:47] right
[54:48] that's the right
[55:00] could be yep that's what we're saying if
[55:02] there's a major prophet like the seven
[55:04] church age messengers
[55:05] that's so they have thus saith the lord
[55:08] for that generation that age right
[55:10] and that thus saith the lord is above
[55:13] all
[55:13] right that's right but the highest
[55:16] calling right
[55:17] in the local i'm sorry the fivefold
[55:19] ministry on earth would be the apostle
[55:21] now what's interesting is a lot of these
[55:23] guys were apostles
[55:25] right paul was an apostle
[55:27] and prophet
[55:28] brother branham was an apostle and
[55:30] prophet and prophet so you have to kind
[55:33] of look at each one that's a great
[55:34] statement you have to look at each
[55:36] situation
[55:37] right
[55:39] but see people can't ex people can't
[55:41] swallow this
[55:43] because they've got their own man-made
[55:44] con
[55:45] ideas and doctrines
[55:48] but you and i believe the word
[55:51] paul was a pastor in a season of his
[55:53] life
[55:54] remember apollos was also a pastor in
[55:56] ephesus and brother branham said timothy
[55:58] was pastor in ephesus after paul left
[56:00] that's what brother branham said
[56:03] the first church a started around 53 a.d
[56:06] when paul established the church in
[56:07] ephesus so he established that means
[56:08] he's the apostle
[56:10] on his missionary journey established
[56:11] church of ephesus the ephesian church
[56:14] and was the pastor of it until he was
[56:16] beheaded in 66
[56:18] making him about 22 years
[56:21] the pastor of the ephesian church well
[56:22] now the bible said he was there three
[56:24] years so
[56:26] i don't know
[56:28] i'm not sure but the bible says three
[56:29] years
[56:30] so see see how
[56:33] they'll fight the death he was there 22
[56:35] years because the prophet said it well
[56:38] the bible said he was only there three
[56:39] years
[56:41] so who are you going to believe well the
[56:42] bible because brother abraham said take
[56:44] everything i say back to the word
[56:46] he said prove all things by the word he
[56:48] said be very careful what you're
[56:49] listening at
[56:51] and if i get something wrong he said
[56:52] look in the bible
[56:55] amen oh yes yes yes that's it here it is
[56:57] brother so he says this in the series in
[57:00] december 60 but then the church age book
[57:02] he corrects it paul who found the true
[57:04] faith of the city pastored here only
[57:05] about
[57:06] three
[57:07] years
[57:09] oh no no it's 22. it's thus saith the
[57:12] lord you liar
[57:14] what's the bible say the bible says
[57:16] three years amen so there's a small
[57:18] season of life three years he could sit
[57:21] down and every sunday can you imagine
[57:22] brother sitting under the apostle paul
[57:25] every sunday for three years and say no
[57:27] thank god feed my soul pastor thank you
[57:30] that's grand and then sometimes he's
[57:32] slipping that profit roll
[57:34] and he said don't be discouraged let me
[57:36] comfort you there should come a day when
[57:38] the bible says there will become a shout
[57:40] voice and trump and the dead in christ
[57:42] shall rise first amen
[57:44] and sometimes he'd warn him about the
[57:46] antichrist he'd say thus saith the lord
[57:48] the antichrist will sit in the jewish
[57:49] temple of god claiming that he is god
[57:52] thus saith the lord
[57:54] and they slip back into pastor mode now
[57:56] little children be tender hearted
[57:59] grieve not the holy spirit of god
[58:01] whereby your seal to the day of your
[58:03] redemption
[58:05] he break down into each role praise and
[58:07] then after maybe maybe after three years
[58:09] he'd say well i'll go on a little
[58:10] evangelist trip now i'm gonna go back
[58:12] and see all the other churches that we
[58:13] were at i'll be right back praise god
[58:16] see he would rotate back and forth
[58:19] right between different ministries
[58:22] with different people
[58:26] now we'll get to this one next time
[58:27] we'll look at the sisters sisters have a
[58:28] very unique their borders are so unique
[58:32] most people just think they're cut and
[58:34] dry
[58:34] sister has to stay at home
[58:36] right sister can't say anything about
[58:39] the word to a man
[58:41] no that's only her husband when her
[58:42] husband has disobeyed the word
[58:45] right
[58:47] but then the bible says sarah
[58:49] told abraham what to do
[58:51] and abraham went back lord is that right
[58:53] yes hearken to sarah
[58:56] see
[58:58] oh such unique borders
[59:01] it's not all cut and dry like every like
[59:03] some people make it out to be
[59:05] we must diligently search the scriptures
[59:07] and we must really find the new
[59:09] testament borders that we're supposed to
[59:10] live under
[59:12] and make sure we drive out all the
[59:14] inhabitants of the land
[59:17] let me close with this
[59:20] see paul had all five preaching gifts
[59:22] each ministry was unique for a time and
[59:25] season of life
[59:28] see church pastors can evangelize for a
[59:31] season
[59:33] but they ought not to collect ties if
[59:36] they're going to be out for a long
[59:37] season
[59:38] because they're not feeding the local
[59:39] church anymore
[59:42] right
[59:44] that's exactly what the word of god says
[59:47] there's times and seasons for three
[59:49] years right pastor
[59:52] how long would it take paul to travel
[59:53] all the churches he visited maybe six
[59:55] months a year
[59:56] there's a season for that but you have
[59:58] to recognize when god is changing the
[1:00:00] season church i hope there's a season
[1:00:03] where i can go out and be a evangelist
[1:00:05] i hope there's a season but we need a
[1:00:07] pastor first
[1:00:08] and god will raise them up at the right
[1:00:09] time
[1:00:10] i trust i'm not saying there will be but
[1:00:12] i hope oh there's a season where i can
[1:00:13] be a missionary full-time
[1:00:16] that would be awesome
[1:00:18] my wife and i are traveling on planes
[1:00:20] together
[1:00:21] all the kids are growing up and
[1:00:24] malachi and eye hunter preaching or
[1:00:25] something like that
[1:00:27] i'm just joking but no pressure all the
[1:00:29] guys get the pressure for preaching
[1:00:30] anyway
[1:00:31] but i'm hoping by god's grace i can have
[1:00:34] seasons in my life because i desire to
[1:00:36] do something like that
[1:00:40] and church i want you to notice this too
[1:00:43] paul possessed all the spiritual land
[1:00:45] for his life
[1:00:47] he was faithful in his preaching
[1:00:51] he was faithful in his singleness his
[1:00:54] relationships he never married
[1:00:57] he said i have the gift not to burn can
[1:00:59] you imagine that
[1:01:00] the gift not to burn
[1:01:03] so he's faithful with the word faithful
[1:01:04] with relationships he was faithful with
[1:01:07] his occupation of making tents i imagine
[1:01:10] nobody made a tent like paul
[1:01:12] and i hope it's said about me there's
[1:01:14] nobody that teaches first grade like mr
[1:01:15] smith
[1:01:17] i hope it can be said like that
[1:01:21] nobody's quite like him he's got a
[1:01:22] unique ministry he really
[1:01:24] a unique gift oh i hope it can be said
[1:01:27] like that
[1:01:28] and i believe it could by god's grace
[1:01:30] not that i'm better than anybody but i
[1:01:31] just have a different way to do it
[1:01:33] that helps the kids
[1:01:35] and then what else would think all the
[1:01:37] other things he was faithful with so job
[1:01:39] relationship ministry
[1:01:42] in each area he was faithful with all of
[1:01:45] those
[1:01:46] so when he come to the end of this road
[1:01:47] he said i know there's a crown waiting
[1:01:49] for me
[1:01:50] i know he's going to say well done
[1:01:53] i finished my course
[1:01:55] and church look at that he finished
[1:01:57] remember in the last few years of his
[1:01:59] life
[1:02:00] remember from 64 to 66 he wrote
[1:02:03] philippians and then ii timothy
[1:02:06] isn't it amazing brother william in
[1:02:08] brother brahms last two years of his
[1:02:10] life
[1:02:12] glory in paul's last two years of his
[1:02:14] life he finished all the things that he
[1:02:17] had to do amen
[1:02:19] in brother branham's last two years of
[1:02:21] his life he preaches the seals marriage
[1:02:23] and divorce anoint the ones in the end
[1:02:25] times he nails down these major
[1:02:28] revelations and says thus saith the lord
[1:02:30] amen
[1:02:32] and he could go to heaven knowing he
[1:02:34] finished the mysteries of god
[1:02:37] amen in the last two years look at that
[1:02:40] isn't that beautiful
[1:02:43] the alpha and omega prophets in the last
[1:02:46] two years of their life finish
[1:02:47] everything and they can go to heaven
[1:02:49] saying i fought a good fight
[1:02:51] i finished the course let's stand to our
[1:02:53] feet
[1:02:57] hallelujah musicians can come here
[1:03:01] maybe lord willing on sunday i want to
[1:03:02] get into adoption
