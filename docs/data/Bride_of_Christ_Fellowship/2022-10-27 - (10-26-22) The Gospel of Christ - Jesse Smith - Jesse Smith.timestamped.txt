[18:44] listen to both sermons there from
[18:46] Brother cam so it was a wonderful
[18:47] wonderful weekend of services praise God
[18:49] and I was so blessed to hear that and my
[18:52] favorite thought of all the thoughts and
[18:54] the messages from the Holy Spirit was
[18:55] the one about uh John in the bosom of
[18:58] Jesus and how that was a fulfillment of
[19:00] the type of Solomon set me as a seal
[19:04] upon thine heart I thought wow that was
[19:05] so beautiful so I I told Brother cam
[19:07] that's a beautiful I wish I would have
[19:08] had that back in January and I was
[19:09] preaching on that
[19:11] that was a beautiful thought and I just
[19:13] thoroughly enjoyed it and uh just happy
[19:15] to see that
[19:17] man so blessed and we had a great time
[19:19] there in Pennsylvania you know we had a
[19:21] marriage banquet on Saturday night
[19:24] God was gracious to me that night I was
[19:26] in the shower and I fell and hit my head
[19:28] on the back of the
[19:30] shower and had this huge bump
[19:33] and I had a headache you know so I was I
[19:36] was a little nervous about Sunday you
[19:37] know but I just prayed over it went to
[19:39] bed and woke up better and now I don't
[19:42] even feel it now so I just healed pretty
[19:43] fast but
[19:45] I felt like the enemy was trying to
[19:46] discourage me you know I I think they I
[19:48] think they sprayed oil on the bathroom
[19:50] floor if I'm not mistaken I think I
[19:52] think the enemy anointed somebody to
[19:54] spray some oil on there maybe some
[19:56] banana peels maybe I didn't see it or
[19:57] something but
[19:59] we just had a wonderful time you know in
[20:00] the morning I preached on uh
[20:02] the doctrine of the Saints you know uh
[20:05] brother Ram said thus saith the Lord
[20:06] Elijah shall turn the hearts of the
[20:08] children back to the apostolic Doctrine
[20:10] so I looked at the basically that series
[20:11] on doctrine that I preached here we had
[20:13] a few people come up couple Brothers
[20:14] come up for deliverance and then the
[20:17] evening I preached on Mighty Men I kind
[20:18] of put all those sermons into one and
[20:19] just hit the highlights and we had a lot
[20:21] of people it was a four-hour service
[20:22] just one after another mostly sick
[20:24] people mostly sick people and some of it
[20:27] was pretty pretty humbling to see people
[20:30] come up for prayer
[20:32] um one in particular I prayed for an
[20:34] older sister
[20:36] she has Parkinson's she was
[20:39] she was shaking and you know they were
[20:40] asking for a miracle and we prayed and
[20:42] we just prayed for five or ten minutes
[20:43] and I looked at an idea and I'm crying
[20:45] and
[20:46] my sister will just see what God does
[20:47] and she said it's already done brother
[20:50] Jesse
[20:51] like I felt she was rebuking me you know
[20:53] because her such faith
[20:55] and so we'll see you know I've never
[20:57] seen a Parkinson heal but she said it's
[20:59] already done so in other words her her
[21:01] heart is in the right place
[21:03] and of course I preached there how you
[21:04] have to find the will of God first but
[21:06] you know we'll see what the Lord does
[21:07] we'll keep tabs on them but it was just
[21:10] a wonderful
[21:11] wonderful weekend so I'm glad you had a
[21:13] great weekend and we had a wonderful
[21:14] weekend as well so
[21:16] I just thought I'd give you a quick
[21:16] update on that

[40:11] here tonight uh
[40:13] called The Gospel of Jesus Christ praise
[40:15] God since we have Jordan and Sage at
[40:16] such a special occasion I just thought I
[40:18] would preach the introduction to the
[40:21] Gospel of Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[40:23] and uh
[40:25] try to present the gospel just as plain
[40:27] as I know how by the grace of God
[40:31] Hallelujah
[40:35] thank you Jesus
[40:41] Mark chapter 1 verses 14 and 15. we'll
[40:44] start here by the grace of God
[40:59] praise God
[41:02] so our context here is the Lord Jesus
[41:05] Christ begins preaching here after
[41:06] John's arrest
[41:09] and we just want to focus on what he
[41:11] says here
[41:13] I'll read verse 14 and then we all re
[41:15] all can read 15 together pardon me
[41:18] now after that John was put in prison
[41:20] Jesus came into Galilee preaching the
[41:23] gospel of the kingdom of God let's read
[41:25] 15 together one two three and saying the
[41:29] time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God
[41:32] is at hand repet ye and believe the
[41:36] gospel amen praise God let's have a word
[41:38] of prayer if you ever need on your heart
[41:39] here during The Sermon Just acknowledge
[41:41] it by the raising of a hand
[41:43] let's pray together father God we're

[41:57] we thank you God for that thank you for
[41:59] your word thank you for your Holy Spirit
[42:01] Lord thank you for the songs of Zion

[42:16] thank you for this opportunity to be
[42:17] here tonight Lord just help me Lord to
[42:19] present the Gospel of Jesus Christ and
[42:21] and just the most plain simple format we
[42:24] can Lord and may your spirit back it up
[42:26] we pray Lord Jesus that your spirit will
[42:27] speak to each and every heart and father
[42:30] Lord each person will know Lord God the
[42:32] Gospel of Jesus Christ the good news and
[42:35] so we give you all the glory in Jesus
[42:36] Christ's name and the saint said amen
[42:39] God bless you as you're being seated
[42:40] praise God
[42:43] so by God's grace we'll just do a little
[42:45] bible study here tonight on the Gospel
[42:47] of Jesus Christ
[42:52] just to update you know we put out a
[42:53] video today I put out the Nephilim video
[42:55] today so
[42:56] if you're interested in that topic I
[42:58] think I started a couple Sundays ago if
[43:00] I'm not mistaken but got that one out
[43:02] today by the grace of the Lord
[43:04] so hope that'd be a blessing here to the
[43:06] Saints
[43:10] so we want to look at this here this
[43:11] first verse I'm sorry this first verse I
[43:13] use here tonight Mark chapter 1 14 and
[43:15] 15. if you could pull it out there again
[43:17] thank you hon
[43:19] so John the Baptist was the Forerunner
[43:21] who introduced Jesus Christ and notice
[43:25] Jesus came preaching the gospel now the
[43:28] god word gospel means good news so he
[43:29] was preaching the Good News of the
[43:32] kingdom of God and the kingdom is a
[43:34] Dominion it's a government it's a
[43:36] rulership of God so he's preaching the
[43:38] Good News of God's government praise God
[43:41] and he says the time is fulfilled the
[43:44] kingdom of God is at hand and he says
[43:46] repent ye and believe the gospel
[43:48] Hallelujah so the first step in being a
[43:51] part of the Kingdom or the government of
[43:54] Jesus Christ is repenting of all of your
[43:56] sins
[43:58] Hallelujah and of course this is not a
[44:01] physical Kingdom yet and that's a big
[44:03] word yet hallelujah it's going to be a
[44:06] physical Kingdom eventually but it's not
[44:08] a physical Kingdom yet right now it's a
[44:11] spiritual Kingdom praise God where the
[44:13] the people of this government are ruled
[44:16] by the Holy Spirit praise God hallelujah
[44:19] and so Jesus comes and he says he starts
[44:21] preaching there's good news there's good
[44:24] news and he said the way to get into the
[44:26] kingdom of God is repent and believe the
[44:29] gospel praise God now I want you to go
[44:32] to Luke here let's this reminds me also
[44:34] of Luke chapter 4 18 the Lord Jesus also
[44:39] describes this Kingdom of Heaven in
[44:42] another way or the kingdom of God in
[44:44] another way Luke 4 18.
[44:49] Luke 4 18. well you're faster than I can
[44:52] turn there so
[44:54] you're going to get a raise like I told
[44:55] you I'm going to give you a raise
[44:57] Jesus is quoting Isaiah 61 verse 1 and
[45:00] he says the spirit Lord is upon me
[45:01] because he hath anointed me to preach
[45:03] the gospel to the poor most people that
[45:06] like real Christianity are not the rich
[45:07] people mostly it's the poor people
[45:11] and he has set me to heal the
[45:13] brokenhearted
[45:15] he hath sent me to preach Deliverance to
[45:17] the captives in other words you don't
[45:19] have to be a slave to sin
[45:21] you don't have to be captive to an
[45:23] addiction or a bad habit you don't have
[45:26] to be addicted you can be delivered and
[45:29] Jesus Christ came that's the good news
[45:31] he will deliver you from all addictions
[45:33] praise God
[45:34] and he recovers the sight to the blind
[45:36] now we can read in the Bible numerous
[45:38] blind people that receive their sight
[45:41] you know I prayed for a sister or sister
[45:43] uh
[45:44] a sister in Napoleon what's her name I
[45:47] prayed for her she couldn't see out of
[45:48] one eye and I prayed for her and she got
[45:49] the sight back right right when I prayed
[45:51] for her
[45:52] Megan there it is Megan she's the same
[45:54] one that got healed of cancer
[45:56] she had cancer on her leg and they just
[45:57] kept praying and it just shrunk away and
[45:59] then was gone
[46:01] so just a real woman of Faith there and
[46:03] she said I couldn't see out of my eye he
[46:04] said she said then when you pray for me
[46:06] the the sight came solely back I don't
[46:08] know what the condition was I don't know
[46:10] if it's a tumor I don't know what the
[46:11] issue was but the fact was we prayed and
[46:14] the Bible said or we prayed and she got
[46:16] her sight back Jesus says I come to give
[46:19] sight to the blind praise God now
[46:21] natural sight is beautiful but even more
[46:23] beautiful than that is spiritual sight
[46:25] so you can see the kingdom of God praise
[46:29] God the kingdom of God is not a physical
[46:31] building
[46:32] right it's not a physical building the
[46:34] kingdom of God is a spiritual building
[46:36] and the Bible says you are one of the
[46:38] stones in the building
[46:39] what a privilege praise God Amen that we
[46:42] are part of that building Hallelujah I'm
[46:45] just one of the stones you are just one
[46:47] of the stones in this beautiful building
[46:49] praise God hallelujah Maybe by God's
[46:52] grace we'd be a pillar Stone Hallelujah
[46:54] because he said you'll be a pillar in
[46:55] the house of my God hallelujah but you
[46:58] but really the the kingdom is a
[47:00] spiritual house it's a spiritual
[47:03] government
[47:04] like you know brother cam can come here
[47:06] and he can feel the prince of God here
[47:08] he can see the people all obeying the
[47:10] word of God I can go to Cam's church I
[47:12] can go to Albion two hours away I
[47:14] haven't seen these people for three or
[47:15] four years and they're still walking in
[47:17] Step Living the same life that I'm
[47:19] living praise God and we don't even talk
[47:21] why because we're all ruled by the
[47:23] spirit same spiritual King Jesus Christ
[47:25] the righteous one praise God oh it's
[47:28] beautiful
[47:29] and he Jesus said I come to set Liberty
[47:31] them that are bruised
[47:34] Hallelujah so Jesus heals uh from Jesus
[47:38] heals bruises praise God he sets the
[47:40] captives free Hallelujah this is what he
[47:43] come to do and only the spirit of God
[47:45] can do this
[47:47] Satan will want to keep people
[47:48] brokenhearted Satan would want to keep
[47:51] people uh chained up as captives Satan
[47:54] wants to keep people bruised but God's
[47:56] spirit is here to heal praise God
[47:58] hallelujah how many can say God's healed
[48:00] you some way or another praise God
[48:02] physically or spiritually Hallelujah and
[48:05] for me both Hallelujah I'm sure for you
[48:07] too
[48:07] both Hallelujah this is what the good
[48:10] news this is good news doesn't sound
[48:11] like bad news or good news
[48:13] sounds like good news but the first
[48:15] requirement is to repent praise God it's
[48:19] the very first requirement and to repent
[48:21] means to turn away from
[48:24] it means actually has a threefold
[48:25] definition it means to hate your sin
[48:29] uh it means to change your mind
[48:32] and it means to make amends for your
[48:34] sins that's all by the memory of the
[48:35] holy spirit because I didn't have that
[48:36] in my memory so I thank God the holy
[48:38] spirit will bring all things to your
[48:39] remembrance praise God that you have
[48:40] need of
[48:42] so when you really repent you say I hate
[48:45] this that I used to do
[48:47] I hate the sin
[48:49] and the second thing I'm going to change
[48:50] my mind about this sin I'm not going to
[48:52] keep doing this uh I got to now think
[48:54] it's wrong and I got to think of I got
[48:56] to think of a way by God's help to not
[48:58] do it anymore
[49:00] and then third if you've hurt anybody
[49:02] and you possibly can you go to them and
[49:04] make it right
[49:06] you say I'm sorry I sinned against you
[49:08] I'm sorry I was I said that I'm sorry I
[49:10] did that will you forgive me and they'll
[49:12] have to know wow something happened
[49:13] because they never apologized before it
[49:15] was never this sincere before why the
[49:17] spirit of the Lord is now upon you
[49:19] praise God hallelujah it's upon you to
[49:22] set you free from your guilt set you
[49:25] free from your shame hallelujah it's
[49:27] there to help your broken heart be
[49:29] healed praise God
[49:31] that's the gospel Hallelujah the good
[49:33] news of the Gospel
[49:35] but it comes by repentance Hallelujah
[49:39] now like if you go since we're in Luke
[49:42] right here I believe if I can find it
[49:44] real quick I believe it's chapter 15 if
[49:45] I'm not mistaken
[49:47] let's find that uh of Zacchaeus
[49:54] now somebody can find that real quick
[49:57] this was not my notes I just thought I'd
[49:58] go to it can somebody anybody seen that
[50:01] yet
[50:06] there it is it's Luke
[50:08] Luke 19. so I was going the wrong way I
[50:10] was going to less verses I knew it was
[50:12] right around here Luke 19.
[50:15] so Zacchaeus of course was a man uh not
[50:18] liked he was not well liked he was a tax
[50:21] collector and and perhaps he he took
[50:23] extra money from the people uh and he
[50:26] was not a well-liked person
[50:28] but Jesus sees him in verse 5 Luke 19
[50:31] verse 5 and Jesus came to a place he
[50:32] looked up and saw him and said to him
[50:34] Zacchaeus make haste come down for today
[50:36] I must abide at thy house now this was
[50:39] unheard of you know a holy person would
[50:41] never go into a tax collector's house
[50:43] because they were known to be Thieves
[50:44] they were known to be dishonest and and
[50:47] no one liked them they didn't have good
[50:48] reputations
[50:50] but
[50:51] you see earlier in verse 4 he ran before
[50:54] and he climbed up so we see he had a
[50:56] desire to see Jesus
[50:58] right so when you have a desire you make
[51:01] extra effort to see Jesus praise God
[51:03] hallelujah he ran ahead he climbed a
[51:05] tree when was the last time you climbed
[51:07] a tree some of you adults right it's
[51:08] been a long time since I climbed a tree
[51:09] and a good thing too because I might
[51:11] fall out and break a leg
[51:12] but he climbed a tree and all these it
[51:15] was I said he was a little man as a
[51:17] little man and he climbed up and he just
[51:18] wanted to see Jesus and Jesus stops and
[51:21] looks up and calls him out
[51:23] he said I'm coming to your house today
[51:25] so there must have been something in
[51:26] Zacchaeus you know because Jesus won't
[51:28] invite himself over
[51:30] Jesus is always knocking at the door
[51:32] Hallelujah right he want to bite himself
[51:34] over but if you open the door he'll come
[51:36] in praise God so he must have wanted to
[51:38] have this desire to see Jesus
[51:40] and so he does that
[51:42] in verse 6 and he said he made haste and
[51:44] came down and received him joyfully and
[51:46] when they saw it they all murmured
[51:47] saying that that he was gone to be the
[51:50] guest with a man that's a sinner so the
[51:52] religious people didn't like that he was
[51:53] going to a sinner's house
[51:55] and Zacchaeus stood and said in the Lord
[51:57] behold or behold Lord the half of my
[52:00] goods I give to the poor
[52:02] and if I have taken anything from any
[52:05] man by false accusation I restore him
[52:08] fourfold so if I saw a hundred dollars
[52:11] I'm giving him back 400. talk about
[52:13] interest this is the opposite kind of
[52:15] Interest right not charging it but
[52:17] giving it right my
[52:20] and Jesus said to him this day what day
[52:22] was it this day praise God look as soon
[52:25] as you make that decision I'm tired of
[52:27] sinning I'm tired of doing people wrong
[52:29] and I'm going to do something about it
[52:30] I'm going to make amends for my sin
[52:32] that's the day you're saved praise God
[52:34] Amen Hallelujah praise God because
[52:36] before you won't do it you'll just let
[52:38] your your mistakes you know live in the
[52:40] past you'll try to drown it out with uh
[52:42] you know food or or alcohol or something
[52:45] you'll try to drown that out with
[52:46] entertainment or something like that but
[52:48] as soon as you repent you'll do
[52:50] everything in your power to make it
[52:51] right because you're a part of a new
[52:53] government praise God your king told you
[52:55] to make it right and so you'll do it
[52:56] even four times the amount praise God
[52:59] that's a repentant heart right there
[53:02] if I did you wrong I'll restore you four
[53:04] times what I did to you
[53:06] Hallelujah Jesus said this day this
[53:09] person got saved
[53:11] this day Zacchaeus finally repented of
[53:14] his sins and he'll make it right
[53:16] Hallelujah
[53:19] I love this because this is so beautiful
[53:21] this day salvation come to this house
[53:22] for as much as he is also a son of
[53:25] Abraham so that proves you are a
[53:28] spiritual uh descendant of Abraham when
[53:32] you make your wrongs right ah it proves
[53:36] you're a part of that that historical
[53:38] family amen that family that's going to
[53:40] be blessed Hallelujah
[53:42] all the world will be blessed through
[53:44] Abraham praise God and when you repent
[53:45] and make things right and you make your
[53:48] wrongs right you make amends the Bible
[53:49] said that proves you are Abraham's seed
[53:52] praise God in other words you are a
[53:53] friend of God just like Abraham was
[53:55] praise God
[53:56] oh Hallelujah
[53:59] he is also a son of Abraham
[54:02] what a beautiful scripture verse 10 for
[54:04] the son of man has come to seek and save
[54:06] that which is lost it doesn't look like
[54:09] Zacchaeus is seeking Jesus right he's
[54:11] running ahead he's climbing the tree but
[54:13] really Jesus was seeking Zacchaeus
[54:16] Hallelujah
[54:18] that's how it is the Bible said God God
[54:20] reaches out to each person and draws
[54:22] them unto him
[54:23] so Jesus was drawing him unto him Jesus
[54:26] was actually seeking him out the Holy
[54:28] Spirit would go to Zacchaeus and so I
[54:30] want to I've heard the testimonies I
[54:31] want to hear about him I got to see him
[54:34] I know he's passing by today praise God
[54:35] oh that's how we should come to church I
[54:37] know the spirit of God will be there
[54:39] Lord Don't Pass Me By touch me today
[54:41] praise God
[54:42] Hallelujah that's exactly right
[54:44] so here's a beautiful example if you
[54:46] when you get saved you will make amends
[54:49] for your wrongs and that's operating
[54:52] according to the kingdom of God the
[54:54] spiritual kingdom of God and that starts
[54:57] with repentance praise God all right go
[55:00] to Acts 2 38 by the grace of God
[55:03] Hallelujah
[55:06] Acts 2 38 very familiar scripture this
[55:08] is the first one I memorized when I come
[55:09] in the message
[55:11] then Peter said to them repent and be
[55:13] baptized every one of you in the name of
[55:15] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[55:18] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[55:21] Holy Ghost amen so 50 days after Jesus
[55:25] went to heaven
[55:27] I'm sorry 50 days after the resurrection
[55:30] rather 10 days after Jesus went to
[55:32] heaven Peter preaches on the day of
[55:34] Pentecost and he says if you want to be
[55:36] a part of this Kingdom you must repent
[55:37] of your sins and you must be buried in
[55:40] water as the name of the Lord Jesus
[55:43] Christ is called Over You Hallelujah and
[55:46] then if you do that the Bible said he'll
[55:48] remit your sins he'll send your sins
[55:51] away
[55:52] what a beautiful promise praise God and
[55:54] brother Adam said this if there ever was
[55:55] a Creed to the apostles this was their
[55:58] Creed amen hallelujah this will always
[56:00] be up my Creed as well by God's grace
[56:02] Creed means I believe so I believe Acts
[56:04] 2 30. how many believe Acts 2 38.
[56:07] Hallelujah I believe this is My
[56:09] Confession
[56:11] so here we see this is the way into the
[56:13] kingdom repent of all your sins Jesus
[56:16] will send your sins away he'll remit
[56:18] your sins send them away and then he'll
[56:21] send you also the gift of the Holy Ghost
[56:24] praise God which is God's Spirit
[56:26] dwelling in your soul
[56:27] right we have three parts we have the
[56:29] body we have the mind and the Soul
[56:31] praise God and so God's spirit comes
[56:34] upon the Mind first to repent of all the
[56:36] sins and then the Holy Spirit keeps
[56:38] repenting after you're baptized you
[56:39] baptize in water the spirit of God keeps
[56:41] dealing with your mind giving you a new
[56:43] spirit the Bible said new heart new
[56:45] spirit praise God he cleans out your
[56:47] mind and then when your mind is clean
[56:49] and you have new habits and a new life
[56:51] then the Bible said he gives you my
[56:53] spirit praise God he puts the holy
[56:55] spirit in your soul and then it's
[56:57] constantly living abiding praise God and
[57:00] then you don't have to have anybody tell
[57:01] you about Jesus Jesus lives inside of
[57:03] you praise God hallelujah amen
[57:06] he's now living inside Paul would call
[57:09] it Christ in you the hope of glory Paul
[57:11] would say that Jesus Christ Works in me
[57:13] mightily praise God how many feel the
[57:16] mighty power of Christ work in your life
[57:17] amen
[57:18] it works mightily to save you Works
[57:21] mightily to sanctify you and works
[57:23] mightily to fill you with the Holy
[57:24] Spirit praise God and then Works
[57:26] mightily to help you humble yourself and
[57:28] make it through your trials praise God
[57:30] and give you a testimony teaching you to
[57:32] obey teaching you to suffer praise God
[57:35] because if you suffer with him you shall
[57:37] reign with him amen oh Hallelujah
[57:40] beautiful
[57:42] now this remission of sins reminds me of
[57:44] Isaiah 53. let's go to Isaiah 53
[57:59] . reminds me that song I love to tell
[58:01] the story to them who know it best
[58:03] Hallelujah
[58:07] Isaiah 53.
[58:10] of course is speaking of Jesus I'll
[58:12] start at verse 3. he is despised and
[58:14] rejected a man a man of Sorrows and
[58:16] acquainted with grief and we hid as it
[58:19] were our faces from him he was despise
[58:21] and we had esteemed him not speaking of
[58:24] every person basically was not worthy of
[58:27] Salvation even Jesus's own disciples ran
[58:30] from him when he was arrested except
[58:31] John came there at the cross right but
[58:34] the Bible said all the Sheep were
[58:35] scattered everybody said they'd stand up
[58:37] and I'll die for him I die from but when
[58:39] the soldiers came with swords they all
[58:41] scattered
[58:42] and so the Bible foretold this 800 years
[58:45] in advance that he would be rejected by
[58:47] all men
[58:49] verse four now here's verse 4 we're
[58:51] really getting the beautiful work that
[58:53] the cross accomplished surely he hath
[58:55] borne our griefs and carried our sorrow
[58:59] so Jesus took your griefs jesus carried
[59:04] your sorrow
[59:05] yet we did esteem him stricken smitten
[59:08] of God and afflicted
[59:10] but he was wounded for our
[59:12] transgressions he was bruised for our
[59:15] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[59:18] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[59:20] healed what a beautiful picture jesus
[59:23] takes all the punishment for all of our
[59:25] sins for every iniquity Every Lie we
[59:28] told every evil thing we did every Angry
[59:31] thing we did all the all the stealing
[59:34] all the blasphemies that we did all the
[59:36] Abominations that we did all the wicked
[59:38] things that we could name but we'd never
[59:40] want to name but all those things that
[59:42] shouldn't even be spoken Jesus Took the
[59:44] punishment for all those the Bible said
[59:46] he was wounded for you he stood in your
[59:48] place he got the whippings you should
[59:50] have got praise God he got the
[59:52] chastening and the and the the
[59:54] punishment that you should have got and
[59:56] but the Bible said with each whip that
[59:58] was bringing more and more healing
[1:00:00] praise God oh so all 39 Stripes praise
[1:00:03] God all 39 each time he was slapped each
[1:00:06] time he was spit on each time it was him
[1:00:08] bringing you more healing all the
[1:00:10] punishment of all mankind of all time
[1:00:13] was placed on this all-time great one
[1:00:15] praise God the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:17] hallelujah amen he was God's lamb
[1:00:20] Hallelujah God's lamb
[1:00:23] verse 6 all we like sheep have gone
[1:00:26] astray we have turned everyone to his
[1:00:28] own way and the Lord hath laid on him
[1:00:30] the iniquity of who of us oh
[1:00:33] every single person from the 4 000 years
[1:00:36] before Jesus and now the two thousand
[1:00:38] years after Jesus all the sins of six
[1:00:41] thousand years were poured out on Jesus
[1:00:43] on Mount Calvary that's why I was
[1:00:45] singing about it that's why we sing
[1:00:46] about The Old Rugged Cross amen because
[1:00:49] that's where he took all the punishment
[1:00:51] for all of our sins praise God and all
[1:00:53] we got to do to receive salvation is
[1:00:56] repent and say God I'm changing my mind
[1:00:58] I'm hating sin and I'll make amends for
[1:01:01] the wrong I've done praise God
[1:01:03] what a beautiful gift praise God it's a
[1:01:06] gift God put all the punishment on Jesus
[1:01:09] and then the Bible says all the
[1:01:11] righteousness of Jesus comes on you and
[1:01:13] I what a story praise God
[1:01:16] it was it was prefigured by the Jews on
[1:01:19] the day of atonement the priest would
[1:01:21] lay his hands on the head of the goat
[1:01:23] and all the sins of all Israel would go
[1:01:25] on the head of that goat and then that
[1:01:27] goat would die for all the sins of
[1:01:30] Israel and they'd send another goat away
[1:01:32] with all the sins on it and the Goat
[1:01:34] would just be lost in the wilderness
[1:01:35] probably ravished it represented
[1:01:37] something had to die for everyone's sins
[1:01:39] and then God in his grace would send our
[1:01:41] sins completely far away from us praise
[1:01:44] God we can't even see our sins anymore
[1:01:46] is that how you see yourself today you
[1:01:48] can't see your sins because of the blood
[1:01:50] of Jesus Christ praise God
[1:01:52] that's the power of the Gospel
[1:01:54] Hallelujah
[1:01:55] sending our sins so far away well so it
[1:01:58] was on the cross God put all the sins of
[1:02:01] Jesse Smith all the sins of Kristen
[1:02:04] Smith all the sins of Cam Smith
[1:02:06] all those sins of each one of us all of
[1:02:10] that was put on Jesus amen and he said
[1:02:12] father forgive them they don't know what
[1:02:14] they do praise God
[1:02:16] oh it's a beautiful testimony
[1:02:18] Hallelujah the testimony of the cross
[1:02:22] thank you Jesus
[1:02:23] the iniquity of all of us was laid upon
[1:02:26] him
[1:02:27] this is the cross this is the message
[1:02:29] this is the good news Hallelujah
[1:02:31] thank you Jesus
[1:02:33] sorry that's a little too close whenever
[1:02:35] I wear the sweater I got trouble with
[1:02:37] that verse five he was oppressed and he
[1:02:39] was afflicted yet he opened not his
[1:02:40] mouth he is brought as a lamb to the
[1:02:43] slaughter as a sheep before her shears
[1:02:45] is dumb so he opened not his mouth
[1:02:47] Hallelujah so he went to the Cross as a
[1:02:50] lamb praise God and he took all the sins
[1:02:53] upon him that he might forgive us praise
[1:02:55] God now I want to show you the church
[1:02:57] this is a free absolute free gift
[1:02:59] salvation is a free gift you don't have
[1:03:01] to earn it you just have to repent
[1:03:03] praise God so let's go to Romans 6 23
[1:03:06] Romans 6 23.

[1:04:14] that passes all understanding amen
[1:04:17] the wages the payment for your sin is
[1:04:20] death in other words we deserve a
[1:04:22] paycheck of death because of our sin
[1:04:25] that's the paycheck like you work you
[1:04:27] get a paycheck well we sin we deserve
[1:04:29] the payment of death
[1:04:30] that's the paycheck for sin
[1:04:33] but the gift of God okay so we in other
[1:04:35] words this is not a paycheck now this is
[1:04:37] a free gift
[1:04:38] there's not it's not the wages because
[1:04:40] you didn't work for it you couldn't earn
[1:04:42] it I couldn't earn it I don't deserve it
[1:04:44] still you gave your life away so I'm
[1:04:46] familiar the precious love of God
[1:04:48] but the gift of God is eternal life
[1:04:50] through Jesus Christ Our Lord and the
[1:04:53] church said
[1:04:54] the gift of God is eternal life we
[1:04:58] deserve death we deserve punishment but
[1:05:01] Jesus Christ paid the price for our sins
[1:05:03] and when we repent and trust in him for
[1:05:06] salvation and Believe on him by faith
[1:05:08] the Bible says we're given the gift of
[1:05:10] eternal life my life I have tonight this
[1:05:12] life will end but the life of my soul
[1:05:15] can never end praise God in other words
[1:05:17] you're looking at a soul that will never

[1:05:31] Eternity praise God
[1:05:34] Hallelujah
[1:05:37] you just see the outward shell but
[1:05:39] behind the shell is a soul
[1:05:41] and that Soul has eternal life praise
[1:05:43] God
[1:05:44] this shell is going to crack
[1:05:47] from dried from dry skin too right we're
[1:05:50] just going to crack and bleed and get
[1:05:51] broken and all these things but the soul
[1:05:54] can never be touched by the devil
[1:05:56] Hallelujah because Jesus said you have
[1:05:59] been passed from Death unto life praise
[1:06:02] God Jesus took our payment Jesus Took
[1:06:04] the punishment Jesus Paid the wages amen
[1:06:07] Jesus Took the wages praised God that we
[1:06:09] might have the gift of eternal life
[1:06:11] praise God
[1:06:12] oh that's how we get saved so everybody
[1:06:15] ought to know how to get saved repent of
[1:06:16] your sins trust in Jesus Christ
[1:06:19] hate sin make amends for your sin change
[1:06:22] your mind and the church said
[1:06:24] amen what a beautiful beautiful
[1:06:26] salvation plan praise God now the
[1:06:29] amazing part is very few people will
[1:06:31] even be saved
[1:06:32] Matthew 7 14 I believe if I'm not
[1:06:34] mistaken
[1:06:38] it seems like there's lots and lots of
[1:06:41] churches lots and lots of so-called
[1:06:42] Believers but no nobody really knows
[1:06:45] only God knows how many are saved out of
[1:06:47] those
[1:06:49] Romans 7 I'm sorry Matthew 7.
[1:06:53] let's read 13 as well Hans you since
[1:06:55] you're really good at that let's put up
[1:06:56] 13 up there
[1:06:57] even doing it with a toddler on your lap
[1:06:59] praise God I appreciate that
[1:07:01] entering in at the Straight Gate for
[1:07:03] wide as the gate and Broad is the way
[1:07:05] that lead it to destruction and many
[1:07:07] there be which go in there stay right
[1:07:09] there so back to 13 there on you so
[1:07:12] before you were a Christian it was very
[1:07:15] easy to be a sinner how many could say
[1:07:16] Amen to that
[1:07:17] it's easy to sin it's easy to cheer or
[1:07:20] cheat steal lie lust fornicate all these
[1:07:23] things it's easy to do that it's a broad
[1:07:25] Road everybody does it
[1:07:28] but then when the Holy Spirit comes he
[1:07:30] says you've got to get off this wide
[1:07:31] Road and you've got to walk a narrow
[1:07:33] road
[1:07:35] in other words not many people are
[1:07:37] walking on this road praise God next
[1:07:38] verse
[1:07:40] Jesus said go in the Straight Gate go in
[1:07:42] the narrow road don't take the way
[1:07:43] everybody goes you go the narrow way
[1:07:45] praise God where very few people will
[1:07:47] walk that road
[1:07:49] because straight is the gate and narrows
[1:07:51] the way which leadeth unto life and few
[1:07:54] ever say few
[1:07:56] few not a lot very few people find the
[1:07:59] way to eternal life but yet Jesus Paid
[1:08:02] the price for every every sin
[1:08:04] now why won't people do it because of
[1:08:07] John 3 19 Jesus tells us himself why
[1:08:10] won't people receive salvation it's
[1:08:12] because they love sin more than they
[1:08:14] love righteousness
[1:08:17] Jesus Christ said this this is the
[1:08:19] condemnation that light has come into
[1:08:21] the world in other words Holiness the
[1:08:23] gospel is coming to the world and Men
[1:08:26] love sin or Darkness more than they love
[1:08:28] the gospel
[1:08:31] right
[1:08:32] tonight we can get one two three four
[1:08:33] five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 34 56
[1:08:36] 70. about 20 people on a Wednesday night
[1:08:38] I'm preaching about eternal life which
[1:08:39] can never be taken away
[1:08:41] which you cannot put a price tag on
[1:08:44] and there's 20 people here
[1:08:46] right
[1:08:47] Sunday they had NFL game there in
[1:08:50] Cleveland or whatever and they had what
[1:08:51] 50 000 people there
[1:08:55] it's because it's easy to get them there
[1:08:57] because there's rock and roll there's
[1:08:58] drunkenness there's sexy dress
[1:09:00] cheerleaders and all these things it's
[1:09:02] easy to get people there that's the
[1:09:04] broad road but God is saying leave all
[1:09:07] that and come down to the narrow road
[1:09:09] but see they love that they love
[1:09:11] Darkness well the same is true about us
[1:09:13] and God we love God we love the narrow
[1:09:16] way we love the truth we love Holiness
[1:09:19] that's why we live it praise God but
[1:09:21] there'll be very few of us and we ought
[1:09:23] to be thankful to God that we're one of
[1:09:25] those few that will believe it praise
[1:09:26] God
[1:09:29] Hallelujah I'm one of the few I thought
[1:09:31] about singing that song Tonight by God's
[1:09:33] grace I'm one of the few praise God
[1:09:35] there's very few people that want to
[1:09:37] actually be saved
[1:09:39] that actually want to repent of their
[1:09:41] sins
[1:09:42] change their thinking hate sin and make
[1:09:46] amends for their sin
[1:09:48] very few
[1:09:51] my goodness
[1:09:53] uh let's go to Romans 1 here uh let's
[1:09:56] show how all men are without excuse
[1:09:57] there will be no excuses on the day of
[1:10:00] judgment
[1:10:05] yeah verse 20.
[1:10:07] Romans 1 20.
[1:10:11] no one would be able to say well I
[1:10:12] didn't know I didn't know God had a law
[1:10:14] I didn't know about Jesus Christ no one
[1:10:17] will be able to say that the Bible said
[1:10:19] all men are without excuse
[1:10:21] God preaches the gospel to them not just
[1:10:24] with preachers
[1:10:26] not only does are there men preachers
[1:10:28] but there's also the creationist
[1:10:30] preaching to them imagine that the son
[1:10:32] that they see every morning is preaching
[1:10:34] the gospel to them
[1:10:36] the seasons are preaching the gospel
[1:10:39] death and Resurrection amen it's just
[1:10:41] the gospel is everywhere praise God
[1:10:45] and also even in their even in their own
[1:10:47] being they can look at their own being
[1:10:48] in their own mind and realize there's
[1:10:51] someone that gave me this ability I was
[1:10:53] not just a an accident someone brought
[1:10:56] me here someone sent me here someone
[1:10:58] gave me all these blessings someone gave
[1:11:00] me all these organs at work somebody
[1:11:01] gave me this brain that worked praise
[1:11:03] God somebody's greater than me and so I
[1:11:05] must come from somewhere I need to find
[1:11:07] out where I come from God put that
[1:11:09] gospel right inside of them praise God
[1:11:12] for they are all without excuse
[1:11:17] actually let's read 19 too I keep and
[1:11:20] scripture hunt I'm sorry because that
[1:11:22] which
[1:11:23] may be known of God is Manifest in them
[1:11:25] for God has showed it unto them
[1:11:29] so in other words things that can be
[1:11:32] known about God is actually seen in your
[1:11:34] body right in your being
[1:11:37] right you know things you understand
[1:11:39] things you can grow you can learn so
[1:11:41] much
[1:11:43] you learn all this God put all this
[1:11:46] knowledge inside of you so you can learn
[1:11:48] all this and it helps you to understand
[1:11:49] God
[1:11:53] Hallelujah verse 20. for the invisible
[1:11:55] things of him from the creation of the
[1:11:57] world are clearly seen being understood
[1:12:00] by the things that are made even his
[1:12:03] eternal power in Godhead so that they
[1:12:06] are without excuse Hallelujah
[1:12:08] so there be no excuses on the day of
[1:12:11] judgment praise God and then the Bible
[1:12:13] now go to the next chapter Romans 2
[1:12:15] verse 16 and then this new testament
[1:12:17] Paul says
[1:12:19] actually I'll just use Paul's letters
[1:12:20] from Romans from Romans on
[1:12:26] the chapters in the book of Acts
[1:12:29] Paul says all these
[1:12:31] letters that the Holy Spirit gave to
[1:12:33] Paul
[1:12:34] all these think of this all the world
[1:12:36] will be judged by Paul's gospels look at
[1:12:39] that small little trip of paper
[1:12:40] God's going to judge every person by
[1:12:42] this much paper right here
[1:12:44] the contents on that paper
[1:12:46] how many one know it's on that paper
[1:12:48] I want to know that's my greatest desire
[1:12:50] what is on that paper what do I got to
[1:12:52] do
[1:12:53] what does God what does god require me
[1:12:55] in that day when God shall judge the
[1:12:57] secrets of men's hearts by Jesus Christ
[1:13:01] according to my gospel that's why we
[1:13:04] must know Romans and First Corinthians
[1:13:06] and second Corinthians and Galatians and
[1:13:09] Ephesians and Philippians and Colossians
[1:13:11] and the church said and Seth
[1:13:13] Thessalonians and Timothy and Philemon
[1:13:16] and Titus we must know these because
[1:13:19] that is the Judgment standard that's
[1:13:21] what God is going to say didn't she do
[1:13:22] this why didn't you do this it was
[1:13:24] placed right there in front of you but
[1:13:25] thank God we can say I did it by your
[1:13:27] grace amen I did it because the spirit
[1:13:30] of God was anointing me to do it praise
[1:13:32] God hallelujah
[1:13:35] oh it's beautiful what a beautiful story
[1:13:38] Hallelujah now there's a few more I want
[1:13:39] to get to here by the grace of the Lord
[1:13:43] Ephesians 2 verses 8 9 and 10 honey
[1:13:45] Ephesians 2 8 9 and 10.
[1:13:51] again we go to this idea of God's
[1:13:54] salvation is a gift to you
[1:13:56] for by grace are you saved through faith
[1:13:58] and that not of yourselves
[1:14:00] how are you saved by grace that's an
[1:14:03] unmerited gift God gives you a gift you
[1:14:06] don't deserve that saves you
[1:14:08] and that not of yourselves it wasn't
[1:14:10] because I'm good or because I did
[1:14:12] something it is the gift of God so again
[1:14:14] we see this idea of gift when you don't
[1:14:16] deserve it how many know you don't
[1:14:18] deserve it praise God
[1:14:20] not of Works us any man should boast
[1:14:22] every no woman bragging in heaven
[1:14:23] there'll be no man bragging in heaven
[1:14:25] there's only one to be one person we're
[1:14:27] all bragging on and that's Jesus Christ
[1:14:28] praise God for we are his workmanship we
[1:14:32] were created in Christ unto good works
[1:14:36] which God hath before ordained that we
[1:14:39] should walk in them
[1:14:40] so God Saves you by giving you a gift
[1:14:43] and then once you get saved you're so
[1:14:45] happy you think Lord you gave me this
[1:14:47] gift now what can I do for you what jobs
[1:14:49] do you want me to do in life what
[1:14:51] assignments do I have what's my destiny
[1:14:54] what do you want me to do in life and
[1:14:56] then the Bible said if you love God and
[1:14:57] you receive that gift you will go out
[1:14:59] and find God's Destiny for your life
[1:15:01] nothing will stop you because you know
[1:15:03] what God's done for you and you'll be
[1:15:05] happy to do a little work for God praise
[1:15:07] God because of all that he's done for
[1:15:09] you Hallelujah oh it's beautiful
[1:15:12] and not only that but God ordained you
[1:15:15] to do it in other words there's nobody
[1:15:16] else that can do it except you
[1:15:19] right there's like sister who can reach
[1:15:21] people that I can't reach
[1:15:24] I can reach people that she can't reach
[1:15:26] right
[1:15:27] God has specific jobs and assignments
[1:15:30] for you that only you can do and God
[1:15:33] actually created you specifically just
[1:15:36] to do it praise God oh my God
[1:15:39] Austin was built to do the works of God
[1:15:42] but only the works that he can do
[1:15:45] God had to all ordained all lined up all
[1:15:48] about growing up in Akron all about
[1:15:50] Arizona all about getting lean out there
[1:15:53] all about coming back God's got to all
[1:15:55] ordained being a light and a witness to
[1:15:57] Jeannie and all these all these
[1:15:59] different ones by God's grace God had it
[1:16:01] all lined up praise God
[1:16:03] and all we had to do is receive the gift
[1:16:05] and say Lord what do you want me to do
[1:16:06] and God will show us what to do
[1:16:09] hallelujah oh thank God
[1:16:13] what a beautiful what a beautiful
[1:16:15] salvation Hallelujah
[1:16:17] few though actually want this
[1:16:21] I'm sure if if you're like me you feel
[1:16:23] I'm Chomper at the bit Lord just show me
[1:16:25] what to do and I'll do it
[1:16:27] that's that's my desire I'm just so
[1:16:29] hungry I'm so I'm so longing Lord just
[1:16:32] show me what to do and I'll do it praise
[1:16:34] God
[1:16:35] Lead Me
[1:16:36] inspire me how many how many pray that
[1:16:38] Lord open the door if you want me to do
[1:16:40] something for you
[1:16:42] just show me just show me that's what I
[1:16:44] prayed on Sunday I was praying with
[1:16:45] those Brothers at the altar I said Lord
[1:16:47] I'm just such a uh uh an unintelligent
[1:16:51] person I said make it so plain I can't
[1:16:53] miss it because if I'm if I miss it if
[1:16:56] I'm smart or something I might miss it
[1:16:58] but if I if I say how hum if I'm humble
[1:17:01] and I just make myself little and if I
[1:17:03] just keep repenting and keep keep loving
[1:17:05] and serving you surely I won't miss what
[1:17:08] you're showing me praise God
[1:17:09] then the Bible say God will give you
[1:17:11] some ice out so you can see
[1:17:14] that's what the Bible says Jesus said
[1:17:16] come to me and buy of me I Sal that you
[1:17:19] can see now see before you couldn't see
[1:17:21] the kingdom but now when you get the eye
[1:17:22] Salve on you can see praise God
[1:17:25] I got these glasses last year
[1:17:27] and they had to give me one of those uh
[1:17:29] tests and they squirt that stuff in your
[1:17:31] eye
[1:17:31] you know you can't see I'm driving home
[1:17:34] I got those I got those sunglasses on I
[1:17:36] can hardly see I'm like I don't want to
[1:17:38] die in a car accident Lord please have
[1:17:39] mercy on me I'm just squinting and you
[1:17:41] know you're so sensitive to the light
[1:17:42] they put that iodine I don't know but I
[1:17:45] can't remember what it is
[1:17:46] but I would you know but you can't even
[1:17:48] see
[1:17:49] you're like how in the world am I going
[1:17:51] to get home how is this possible but
[1:17:52] then eventually it wears off you get
[1:17:54] your eyesight back and you can see it
[1:17:56] again you feel safe that's how it is
[1:17:58] with Jesus without Jesus you feel blind
[1:18:00] you're going to die there's it's all bad
[1:18:01] news but with the Holy Ghost you can see
[1:18:04] you know exactly what to do you know
[1:18:05] exactly where you're going and you know
[1:18:07] exactly what Christ did for you praise
[1:18:09] God oh Hallelujah
[1:18:12] what do we got to do church we just
[1:18:13] gotta walk
[1:18:15] in the works that God has ordained for
[1:18:18] you
[1:18:20] Hallelujah that makes each of us
[1:18:22] thankful it makes each of us excited
[1:18:26] well I wonder what God is going to do in
[1:18:27] this next phase of my life
[1:18:30] Hallelujah
[1:18:34] that's why I look at my life by God's
[1:18:35] grace I bought some big old paper the
[1:18:37] other day you know you ever seen those
[1:18:38] big Post-it notes they're like this tall
[1:18:39] you ever seen those postiness and you
[1:18:41] can hang them up on the wall do you ever
[1:18:42] see the
[1:18:43] you know the school we use them in
[1:18:45] school you know big huge papers and they
[1:18:47] got posted noted the sticky stuff I
[1:18:49] bought some of that and I've been
[1:18:50] writing out my goals because I like to
[1:18:51] look up there I like this I I I like I'm
[1:18:54] like a visual learner so I wrote up my
[1:18:56] goals now I got my soon goals my
[1:18:58] long-term goals my prayer requests I got
[1:19:00] it all up there and the next I'm gonna
[1:19:02] do I'm gonna do like a whole timeline of
[1:19:04] my life well this season in my life was
[1:19:06] you know for for pastor at the beginning
[1:19:07] and all these different things this is
[1:19:09] my season for being saved this was the
[1:19:11] season for you know writing books and
[1:19:12] YouTube videos and I just want to see so
[1:19:14] I can know what is God doing in my life
[1:19:16] right now I don't want to miss what he
[1:19:19] has done praise God I want to thank God
[1:19:20] for every season because the Bible says
[1:19:22] as long as I'm planted in Christ I'm
[1:19:24] like a tree and my leads won't wither
[1:19:26] praise God and in every season I'll
[1:19:28] bring forth fruit praise God
[1:19:30] so every season I wonder about when
[1:19:32] Austin got saved I want to put that
[1:19:33] because that was the season of My Life
[1:19:34] when brother amen got saved and sister
[1:19:36] that was a season of my life and God
[1:19:39] gave me fruit for each season I can't
[1:19:41] wait to get it done I can't wait
[1:19:42] actually to have time to start on it
[1:19:43] actually but October is the busiest year
[1:19:45] or month of the whole year for me so and
[1:19:47] we have a parent-teacher conferences I
[1:19:48] have all these meetings
[1:19:50] one of these days by God's grace I'm
[1:19:51] gonna get that but I got the first one
[1:19:52] done
[1:19:54] see I want to know the works that God
[1:19:56] has ordained me to walk in
[1:19:59] I want to know that and I want to do
[1:20:00] exactly what God's called me to do
[1:20:04] Hallelujah so all men are without excuse
[1:20:08] God Saves Us by grace
[1:20:10] Hallelujah and then he ordains God has
[1:20:13] something for you to do so don't let the
[1:20:14] devil tell you oh you're hopeless and
[1:20:16] there's really nothing for you no there
[1:20:18] is something specifically for you to do
[1:20:21] praise God
[1:20:23] like I'll use my mom as an example I
[1:20:24] don't know if Sage or Jordan or about my
[1:20:26] mom so my mom and dad had six kids right
[1:20:28] my dad divorced my mom when I was in the
[1:20:30] seventh grade
[1:20:32] and so she chose to stay at home and and
[1:20:34] just stay with us
[1:20:36] she says many days you don't even know
[1:20:38] how she made it through the day
[1:20:41] didn't even know but every morning she
[1:20:43] would pray with the kids before we go to
[1:20:44] school and every night she'd Corral all
[1:20:47] these crazy Broncos and bring them into
[1:20:49] the room for prayer about at night time
[1:20:52] and she didn't even know how she did it
[1:20:53] but see God had or Works ordained for
[1:20:56] her to do
[1:20:57] so all by herself with six kids she
[1:20:59] would drive all six kids to church every
[1:21:01] Wednesday night every Sunday every
[1:21:03] Sunday
[1:21:04] that was her work and she and she said
[1:21:07] all I did I hardly had any Energy
[1:21:09] washing dishes cooking for six kids
[1:21:10] imagine that cooking for sixes has
[1:21:12] anybody done that before that's a lot of
[1:21:14] every single day
[1:21:16] well my wife does it for for 10 you know
[1:21:19] that's why I think my mother-in-law
[1:21:21] respects my wife so much you know which
[1:21:23] is good God ordained that God ordained
[1:21:25] those good works
[1:21:27] but you know my mom told me she said uh
[1:21:30] she said I had so little energy I just
[1:21:33] just trying to get to the end of the day
[1:21:34] she said all I could do when I prayed at
[1:21:37] the end of the day was just say Lord
[1:21:38] save my children
[1:21:39] can you imagine having no energy but the
[1:21:41] last words before you collapsed on the
[1:21:43] bed
[1:21:44] Lord save my children
[1:21:47] and she did that for 20 years so all the
[1:21:49] kids were raised
[1:21:51] but that was her work to do she was
[1:21:54] ordained to that work and now all six
[1:21:57] have repented and been baptized
[1:22:00] how many moms can say that all six of
[1:22:01] your kids are actually serving Jesus
[1:22:03] Christ and she's got three preachers in
[1:22:05] there too
[1:22:06] not just love Jesus Christ but actually
[1:22:07] called into the service of Jesus Christ
[1:22:10] to be leaders in the in the government
[1:22:12] in the kingdom of God three so you think
[1:22:15] oh you know divorced woman she hardly
[1:22:17] asked what place does she have what good
[1:22:19] works does she have she can take them to
[1:22:21] church and tell them about Jesus that's
[1:22:23] a good word say like this it's better
[1:22:25] than the good work that's a great work
[1:22:27] amen hallelujah I praise God
[1:22:32] and God ordained that from before the
[1:22:35] foundation of the world that she would
[1:22:36] do that and she would do those good
[1:22:38] works
[1:22:41] Hallelujah so never think God doesn't
[1:22:43] care or God's not watching your life God
[1:22:45] watches every detail of your life
[1:22:48] he wants to bless every detail of your
[1:22:51] life
[1:22:52] I told his testimony in Albany they were
[1:22:53] really blessed so my mom you know my mom
[1:22:56] and dad divorce
[1:22:57] my dad eventually they get to the age
[1:22:59] where they get retirement my mom got no
[1:23:00] retirement because they divorced my dad
[1:23:02] get all the money of the Social Security
[1:23:04] and so my mom was that nothing
[1:23:06] but then she took care of a 90 year old
[1:23:08] guy and the 90 year old guy passed away
[1:23:11] and he he was going to donate all of his
[1:23:13] giving away to like Bob Jones University
[1:23:15] and the Republican Party
[1:23:18] but right before he died he said no give
[1:23:20] all the money to my mom
[1:23:22] and now my mom has way more money than
[1:23:25] Social Security could ever give her
[1:23:27] does God know you does God know your
[1:23:29] needs absolutely does God see you even
[1:23:31] when no it looks like nobody cares or
[1:23:34] nobody see you does God see you is God
[1:23:36] keeping track you better believe God is
[1:23:37] keeping track
[1:23:39] nobody can tell me God doesn't keep
[1:23:41] tracking God doesn't see the divorced
[1:23:43] woman God don't see the single mother
[1:23:44] God sees and he cares and he'll back up
[1:23:47] his word amen
[1:23:49] he has works for you to do praise God
[1:23:52] he's ordained ordained my mom to take us
[1:23:54] to church
[1:23:56] I hate church when I was little and now
[1:23:58] I love church there's nothing better to
[1:24:00] me than church amen
[1:24:01] who would have thought that I never
[1:24:02] thought to be a preacher never ever not
[1:24:04] one time in my whole life I hated
[1:24:05] singing I don't know I just but now I
[1:24:08] love it by God's grace
[1:24:09] it was some gift laying in there it's
[1:24:11] hard to see as a rough just a rough
[1:24:13] situation praise God but God had a
[1:24:15] pastor in there God had a preacher God
[1:24:17] had a teacher in there of all the things
[1:24:18] you know just
[1:24:20] see but God created now even a divorced
[1:24:23] woman
[1:24:24] even a low-income woman God's watching
[1:24:26] your Works God's ordained you to do
[1:24:28] something do it with all your heart keep
[1:24:30] all the word of God love Jesus Christ
[1:24:32] with all your heart amen
[1:24:35] Hallelujah
[1:24:39] I'm a witness I've seen it firsthand no
[1:24:41] I can't deny it I've seen it too many
[1:24:42] times
[1:24:44] Hallelujah
[1:24:47] I wish wrote down a few more things I'm
[1:24:48] going to try it's already eight o'clock
[1:24:49] here so I'm going to try to
[1:24:51] if I can
[1:24:54] try to bring this down here
[1:25:01] now
[1:25:03] let me go to Galatians 6 here
[1:25:05] so to summarize Galatians chapter 6
[1:25:08] let me just summarize I believe Paul
[1:25:10] does a beautiful job summarizing
[1:25:13] what what matters most in a Christian
[1:25:15] Life
[1:25:17] uh Galatians 6 14 and 15.
[1:25:21] what matters most in a Christian Life
[1:25:24] after you're saved you got the free gift
[1:25:26] of God you know you've received God's
[1:25:29] gift and now you want to you want to
[1:25:31] walk in God's ways for your life what
[1:25:33] matters most Paul tells us what matters
[1:25:35] most
[1:25:36] God forbid that I should Glory or boast
[1:25:39] save in the cross of our Lord Jesus
[1:25:41] Christ
[1:25:42] by whom the world is crucified unto me
[1:25:46] so for me the world the world was
[1:25:49] smoking cigarettes chewing tobacco
[1:25:51] drinking alcohol watching sports all day
[1:25:53] Sunday Thursday night football Monday
[1:25:55] Night Football
[1:25:56] dirty movies right bad magazines cussing
[1:26:01] all these wicked things that was the
[1:26:03] world to me but when I came to Christ I
[1:26:04] crucified every one of those
[1:26:06] I killed him in other words they don't
[1:26:08] influence my life anymore they have no
[1:26:10] control over me praise God
[1:26:12] because God came to heal my broken heart
[1:26:14] praise God Amen well the reason I was
[1:26:16] into those things because my heart was
[1:26:18] broken that my dad left me right
[1:26:21] that's the only reason
[1:26:23] but the Bible says in Christ
[1:26:25] we can boast in the cross of Jesus
[1:26:28] Christ and we crucify the things of the
[1:26:31] world
[1:26:34] I love this for in Christ Jesus neither
[1:26:37] circumcision a Jewish tradition avails
[1:26:39] anything nor uncircumcision but a new
[1:26:43] creature let's say new creature ready
[1:26:44] new creature
[1:26:46] avails or prevails or has power the only
[1:26:49] thing that has power
[1:26:51] is a new creature god making a new
[1:26:54] person out of Austin Laramie
[1:26:57] or Lena Goodwin or Malachi Smith
[1:27:01] the only thing that prevails the only
[1:27:03] thing that has any power is you letting
[1:27:06] God make you a new creature he builds
[1:27:09] you up this is what the Bible says he
[1:27:10] builds he gives you Faith then he gives
[1:27:12] you virtue These Are Spiritual Powers
[1:27:13] you get the power of Faith power virtue
[1:27:15] power more power of temperance more
[1:27:17] power more power more power and then he
[1:27:19] Seals All That Power into you praise God
[1:27:21] he locks it up and seals it in and all
[1:27:24] that power sealed in there by the love
[1:27:26] of God
[1:27:27] Hallelujah
[1:27:30] that's what counts
[1:27:32] now of course we all want to be saved
[1:27:33] but if God gives us time to be saved
[1:27:35] then he wants to fill us with power he
[1:27:38] wants to make us new creatures praise
[1:27:40] God this is what prevails in a
[1:27:43] Christian's life
[1:27:44] how many appreciate that by God's grace
[1:27:47] this is the only thing Paul says that
[1:27:49] that avails that prevails that has power
[1:27:53] or weight is the new creature God make
[1:27:56] me brand new make me say things that
[1:27:59] people thought they never hear come out
[1:28:01] of my mouth
[1:28:02] I used to cuss or blaspheme or or
[1:28:04] ridicule or tease or anything Lord just
[1:28:07] brings blessings out of my mouth
[1:28:10] make it brand new
[1:28:12] praise God Lord let me meditate uh let
[1:28:15] the meditation of my heart be acceptable
[1:28:17] in thy side oh God Amen Hallelujah
[1:28:21] Let The Works of my hands be honest
[1:28:24] before everybody
[1:28:25] everything I do let everything I do
[1:28:28] testify of Jesus Christ
[1:28:30] let me be a new creature
[1:28:33] let me sing the right songs instead of
[1:28:35] the wrong songs
[1:28:36] praise God let me read the right books
[1:28:38] let me go to the right websites instead
[1:28:40] of the wrong ones
[1:28:42] Hallelujah
[1:28:43] let me buy the right things and say the
[1:28:45] wrong things
[1:28:46] let me give away money instead of
[1:28:48] hoarding it all for myself
[1:28:50] because you can't take it with you
[1:28:51] anyway praise God
[1:28:53] Hallelujah
[1:28:54] thank you Jesus
[1:29:02] well there's so much that could be said
[1:29:05] has
[1:29:06] has it seemed like this a good
[1:29:08] presentation of the Gospel praise God
[1:29:10] this is the good news the good news is
[1:29:12] Jesus Christ came to die for our sins
[1:29:15] and then now that we're saved he's
[1:29:17] created us under good works his spirit
[1:29:19] is going to keep working with us and
[1:29:21] help us to become new creatures in
[1:29:24] Christ Jesus and the Bible said that
[1:29:25] newness can be every single day you can
[1:29:27] be a new person
[1:29:29] I can be actually more I can I can be
[1:29:32] better than yesterday thank God
[1:29:35] I can have a better day today than I had
[1:29:37] yesterday and the church said
[1:29:39] Hallelujah as a church we can actually
[1:29:41] grow closer to God this service than we
[1:29:44] did even last service
[1:29:46] we can keep growing closer to God
[1:29:48] because we come new creatures
[1:29:51] and we feel this presence
[1:29:53] and we know he's with us praise God and

[1:29:57] him guiding us we see him strengthening
