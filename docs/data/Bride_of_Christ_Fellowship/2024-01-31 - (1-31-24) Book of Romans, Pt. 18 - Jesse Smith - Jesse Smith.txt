[Music] Jesus he be the darkness he be [Music] Jesus Jesus Jesus One More [Applause] [Music] timeus [Applause] Jesus [Music] the Jesus [Music] [Applause] H let's take our Bibles here tonight by God's grace like I told you I just just like to teach on uh that video I put out yesterday that revelation God gave to Simon it's quite a revelation there then I'm going to give you a list of some of these wonderful Revelations God has revealed to us you know as we've gone along the journey you know serving the lord Jesus these uh now it's 23 years in the message by God's grace so very thankful I'll make a list of those by God's grace but I think we'll open up to let's go to Acts chapter 19 this is a very important uh section of scripture acts 191 to7 but for time sake I do got to watch the time here we just read some of those verses not all Acts 19 good to see brother B let's give brother B round Applause amen stand here bu oh just living okay is everybody else feeling okay or just tired or sick has a fever James okay remember to pray oh sorry about that yeah we've just been going through that so let's pray that it's short go and heals swiftly by the grace of God a lot of suffering in the church but by God's grace we're making it and God's healing our six so we're very thankful for that act chapter 19 I do have the live stream on but it's unlisted so I don't know if anybody texts you and needs a link I don't think anybody needs one but just just in case X9 1 to7 of course we're going to just focus on um the rebaptism element here um in the scripture because that's kind of the revelation God gave to brother Simon brother Simon shared it with brother Austin any any body else did Simon share with anybody else while he was here just just a real wonderful Revelation did anybody watch the video I put out yesterday with this on well good I almost preached it this morning so like I was wondering who watched it who would be bored if I preached it you know hoping nobody would be bor just be like another uh another review by God's grace Acts 19 and let's remember also uh before we get into the word of God we'll pray let's pray for those visitors you know U just interesting situation there um the one couple that came in first he said we'll see you again very soon we're going to come visit you so I don't know if they got a home church I'm just kind of you know interesting I want to watch that you know um and then the other group you know maybe they'll still yet come tonight the brother asked me do we do Sunday school and I said well no one feels led to teach Sunday school so I said I I just teach the little ones up here so he said he'd see us here tonight so we'll see if we get to see them and they moved from Texas to akan and they just got in school last week here in akan they're 12 minutes from the church so they're very close by I said you're closer to the church than I am I said shame on me I got to move closer I like but nice they're so close 12 minutes from the church so we'll see what the Lord does you know I was telling brother amen in there you know I said sometimes God wants to add to the group sometimes you got we got to be careful you know said God if if Satan can't disturb our church he'll inject somebody with poison and send them in so I'm just every time I try to tell you that you know we just got to watch and see and I always want to be more excited about the people who stay and be excited about visitors so I love all the saints Hallelujah that come the pillars all of you that come every week I want to remember that I want to be more excited because brother Des MC bride told me that he's coming next week uh and he's one of the most trusted ministers I know he's one of the most Godly ministers in fact when I talked to Mike MOSI last time he said bride fasted the whole week so I don't know if that means every meal or some meals but brother uh Mike said he said uh brother Dennis preach two sermons and those two sermons discern everything going on in the church so I just love I love that when a man or woman is uned to the gifts of God in their lives and then the brothers can we like we can all look around and say this is God's doing you know God did something here so it's another good example of drawing nigh to God God will draw nigh to you amen but anyways I do believe brother is one of the um most scriptural humble Christians I know and I mean that in all sincer like like brother Jim you know all the brothers that we know and love last time he was here I forget he was correcting somebody it wasn't any of you it was a visitor and I was like Wow how's he going to correct this because the person said something way outlandish like and brother Dennis could have rebuked him I can't remember I think we're out there fellowshipping with some visitors or something and brother Dennis I was like how is he going to re Reed I just think I think I actually adjusted my arms like how are you going to correct that one man and he goes and this was his reply he said well let me just show let me just share with you how I see it so instead of rebuking them like saying you're wrong that's a devilish thought that's a serpent seed thought he's just like real humble let me show you how I see things I thought what a humble way to disagree with somebody I like to catch I like to REM I like to remember that by God's grace so uh next time I you know I'm in a nervous situation I like to use that let let me see can I just share with you how I see it I just love the how the Holy Spirit Works in different Brothers like that okay Acts 19 I'm sorry I just like to talk to you and tell you my heart and everything I know and I want to share with you Acts 19 verse2 we'll just start there uh he said to them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and they said un him we have not so much much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost what's interesting is in the previous chapter they were baptized they knew the word of God they knew all the scriptures that spoke of Jesus from Apollos yet they didn't even know there was a holy ghost to receive right so they were believers they were Justified I believe Sanctified because look how quickly they got the Holy Ghost Paul just told them about it baptized them and they laid hands and they got the Holy Ghost so no doubt these people were Justified and Sanctified Believers the Bible said Apollos had a mighty gift to uh interpret the scriptures and preach I'm sorry preach the scriptures not interpret showing the scriptures and then verse three and he said to them unto what then were you baptized and they said un John's baptism and u i no I read verse two okay verse four then said Paul John barely baptized with the baptism of repentance saying to the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on Christ Jesus now let's read verse five together ready 1 2 3 when they heard this they are baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus so this text proves water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ should we do Lord Jesus Christ children or father son Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah God bless your your Revelation there but also then in verse six and when they laid their hands I'm sorry laid his hands on upon them the Holy Ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied so again this is also a text not just for water baptism it's a text for the three works of of Grace other words justification what's next what's after that bapm yes Hallelujah my little Scholars up here let's have a word of prayer let's pray for our visitors and also safe travel and also the sick here father God we thank you for today Lord God we love you Lord Jesus you've done it once you'll do it again Lord we're just saying Jesus did so Jesus can Lord we are so grateful for all you've done it's wonderful to shout your Holy Name Lord to worship you uh may we make make your name hollowed Among Us may it be a hollowed sacred name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ bless us here tonight Lord Let Your Presence fill this place God fill our hearts and our minds our thoughts Lord Jesus God especially help me to point the people to the word of God as a as a pastor would do Lord God and Father just bless this study and uh Lord also our travel protect us God on the roads it's very cold we don't want to get into any accidents or have a flat tire or anything so we just ask for your grace and your your leadership protect us Lord you know our desires it's not to be seen and heard it's just to fellowship with our with our body of Believers Lord God and hear the word of God uh nothing selfish Lord just to do thy will Lord and to spend time with your people especially our teens Lord God and Father just continue to heal Lord the sick and The Afflicted here God For Your Glory Jesus I pray for James right now in Jesus Christ's name God we ask the Holy Spirit would overshadow his body God do a great work God I ask it Lord hear my humble cry Lord God while on others thou are calling do not pass him by Lord remember little little James this precious little soul lord God please heal his body For Your Glory Jesus and Lord we just pray for our visitors God have your way Lord uh we just want to be happy but we want to be cautious Lord God and we just pray we could be a help we could be a blessing Lord God we know you'll protect us and keep us Lord God but we also know we have to be tested and tried and so father uh help us to enjoy what we have Lord our home church and those who are amongst us so often Lord our our our chur true family of God so bless us as we look to the word of God here in Jesus Christ's name everybody say amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God all right so who's going to keep me on the clock Don you going to watch okay all right she raise her hand all right you got it get your Bibles let's go um we will start at Genesis 50 um T might be able to read that want try I forgot to get BGA it's a real simple study again when Simon shared this with Austin and I are just you're so blessed and I think you'll be blessed too here by God's grace okay before I get to this this Le there lesson 31 but I know I've been way over 31 lessons but that's the general chart that I put on the video um so we'll get to that in a little bit so the whole point is to show that you know Joseph's two burials were a foreshadowing of the two new testament baptisms that's the whole study it was a beautiful like I always wondered you know why why why two burials and we knew about you know uh Jesus leading captivity captive and everything we knew about that but here's the missing piece here's the missing kind of like the element why why did John's baptism and then the Lord Jesus Christ why it just it does a wonderful job of filling in those empty spots and Simon said uh he said he was teaching their in Thailand answering a question and the thought came to him and the brother's like wow I never seen that before and Simon's like I've wondered about this for 20 what he he's been the message just as long as I have well he was a few months earlier anyways the last 23 years he said I've wondered about this for 23 years and God finally gave me the answer so let it be encouragement your questions put them on the Shelf let's be willing to wait 10 years or how about 23 months could we wait 23 months and then also be able to wait 23 years you know till God gives us uh Revelation and so forth now on the video though I put I'm going to actually exit out that one on the video I started off by showing uh this thought like brother brandom said um brother brand said the Holy Ghost will not give us a different Revelation the Holy Ghost will give us more Bible scriptures about the same revelation he calls it information the Holy Ghost will give us more Bible information about the same Revelation and the example is the birth of Jesus who knows the first prophecy of Jesus in the Bible anybody know the first prophecy in Genesis Genesis 3:15 right the seed of the woman would bruise the seed of the serpent right that's the first prophecy because that's what Jesus did on spiritually on the cross right he destroyed Satan's power to make us uh Servants of sin he destroyed that on the cross okay and then but there was other prophecies about Jesus uh later on Judah we know a governor would come out of Judah remember that verse in that's in Genesis also so we got there we got more information well now the Messiah is going to come out of Judah and then we get some other ones I think Micah said he'd be born in Bethlehem well now we know where he's going to be born and as time went on they got more Revelations Isaiah said he'll be born of a Virgin uh he he'll be called Messiah Prince of Peace Mighty he'll be the Mighty God it'll be God in the human body as time went on they got more and more Revelation uh so that that's what we're seeing even today as we've served God all these years we're seeing God give us more Bible scriptures about the same Revelations like I said I'm going to share a list with you in a moment here this just wonderful list of amazing Revelations and I'm sure I'll probably ask all of you to share some more if I've forgotten some here about God's gra but yeah I will take questions yes nature uh well this is not really related to that's okay preaching but would what name the top what name oh yeah the name of what I'm preaching it's rebaptism uh for shadowed in the Old Testament no I clicked the wrong one sorry here's I got the tile right here rebaptism foreshadowed in the Old Testament the video is called rebaptism foreshadowed or typed in the life of Joseph I had to shorten it you can only have 100 characters on YouTube on the title so it's rebaptism for shadowed in the old Testament okay good question that's the ti give it to your class good question all right so um let me go back to that thought here sorry so that's what I've seen you know as I've served God and you know I've also taken a little criticism for that if if if a preacher preaches a verse that brother Ram didn't use some people get upset about that well that's because they worship brother brah but I've always I've always known the liberty of the holy spirit that as as long as the scripture lines up with what brother random said and it doesn't take anything away then it's this it's just more information about the same Revelation I've always known that I've always believed that and I've always had the Liberty to do that I'm glad for a church that has allowed me to have that Liberty uh because brother R was never saying just PA at me just say what I say he he never said that you know brother ra didn't even preach the whole Bible like there are certain books he never even T talk talked about like habach and some of those other Minor Prophets he never even mentioned the book in all of his sermons well what do you do then you and you you can't preach the Bible you what if there's a scripture in there God wants to anoint to bless somebody with there's some beautiful scriptures in fact the just shall live by faith is in habach that was Martin Luther's verse that Paul wrote about in Romans uh chapter 4 and 5 the just shall live by faith I mean you got to have habach so uh I appreciate a church that loves the Bible and loves Jesus more than anything else right because we can have the balance as long as we follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit yes virie so this topic um this question is kind of up so when we get to have let's say like one of our loved ones aren't there are we going to be sad or what or what because there's no sorrow in heaven right uh that's a great question all I can say is I don't know so this is revelation 7 this is the uh I believe this is the bride brother Ram says in one place it's the foolish virgin in the seven seal he says foolish virgin but there's six other times he says the bride um and this is afterward I believe this is right at the uh marage supper the land because every nation there's they're waving palm branches honey um and the Bible says the lamb which is the midst of the throne shall feed them lead them in living Fountains of waters and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes so we're in heaven we're in glorified bodies and then Jesus is wiping all of our tears away it's like we're not going to think about it I'm just saying I don't know I said Al I would say it's a possibility we might think about them we might yeah good question you have two claps can we think of anything else um there will come a time though when we will remember sin no more I can find that verse here's another one this is the New Jerusalem the New Jerusalem comes down time ends and the Bible said God shall wipe wipe away so yeah that actually Revelation 7 might be at the beginning of the uh future home so I could I could be wrong on that because we see this we see the same language right God shall wipe away all the tears from their eyes we see the same language and there shall be no more death no sorrow No Cry neither shall be any more pain there it is and for the former things are passed away I think there's a verse about remember no more I preached on this I remember specifically uh no more is it no more remembrance new test or old okay so it must be an Old Testament verse the Bible says there uh there come a time when we will remember things no more so the ones that we loved like think about Jacob and Esau Jacob's twin brother is lost his twin brother the one he was best probably best friends with growing up Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated so that's very it's hard for us to understand right honey we also have to understand that God allows them to make their own choices and if they don't want to spend eternity with God then God's not going to force them to do that that that's the choice they made okay but it seem I I personally believe we will remember some of these things and then God will there come a time when Jesus will let us cry it out and then he'll he'll explain why like like we saw today all things work together for good he'll show us how it all work together for good and I know you know people being lost and annihilated that doesn't seem like good but God has to allow for them to have their free their free more agency and their their choices as well okay H does that help a little bit so you have two verses there in Revelation that says Jesus we're already in perfect bodies we already got white robes but he still has to wipe away tears from our eyes okay does that help okay you two classs anybody else have any other verses on that sometimes uh sometimes I can't remember all the verses I feel like Isaiah when it speaks of the Millennium I could be wrong remember there says the Holy Ghost okay so yeah that's a good question maybe it's remember appreciate your patience here there's the back yeah I must have had my verses mixed up but yeah that that's what I think honey I think we'll remember some of those things remember we'll be in a perfect body and we won't sin anymore we won't have any regrets because we we did all we could you all we can do we can't save other people all we can do is save ourselves Paul said save yourselves from this untour generation so that puts free moreal agency on each person I want to give you the scriptures I want to be more diligent with the scriptures this year um no I'm sorry that's Peter yeah Peter said with many other words that he testified and exort saying save yourselves so that's that puts it on the individual God knows what you're going to choose he has four knowledge right predestination election all those things but then when it comes down to it each person has in in this in this time and season in our current time we have the we have to make the choice okay give two class that's a good question I don't mean to go too long on that one but that's a good good question all right and then um and then on the video I put this idea about the message of the hour in the Bible so our trolls you know or uh uh the people that have left the message they attack everything we preach everything the one the one phrase they hate a lot is the message of the hour but I show but I showed on the video there was always a message of the hour there was always more revelation God was giving so if you Liv in the days of Adam and Eve there would be you know blood sacrifice right but when it came to time of Noah you had to receive the message of the hour right you had to receive it then Abraham now you got to be circumcised if you're a man you the Bible said if if you were not in that Covenant Abraham's if you were not circumcised Abraham would kick you out of the tribe I mean you you couldn't have fellowship with God you had to receive the message of the hour uh then 100 I'm sorry 1500 years later came Moses now you have more laws and now you have laws 613 laws um you had to receive the message of the hour after that you know the next change remember the covenants in my book I don't know if you remember that there's eight covenants then the next Covenant was the David Covenant and this is what this was so striking on the video I don't know if you saw it but uh how many know that David preach on David and Zion David established musicians Moses didn't have that but now David said every service we're going to have music we're have dancing hallelujah amen we're going to have singers shouters musicians and they're going to do their course they're going to they would devote a whole week or a whole month some of the priests would be there a whole month and they take a month off you know it was a real wonderful system uh so or yeah David established Solomon took it and ran with it even more because he had a more time of Peace than David did but you had to follow the message of yah like I put on the video some of those people could have stood and said Moses never told us to do instruments well what do you do you got to stay with you got to stay you got to see God is leading David he killed Goliath he's got the anointing he prayes a prophet he's led by the Holy Spirit there was a message of the hour they had to receive now that was a blessing to me another great blessing was in the time of zable God scattered Israel well they start coming back and who remembers they remember that small Temple I showed you they built a very small Temple and the young people like praise God we got a church and the old people are like oh this is so small compared to Solomon's day and the holy Spirit told uh Zechariah and hegi you tell those old people this is the day of small things stop weeping you're crying why you crying at least we got a temple so that's why I love having a small Church it it don't matter it could be a day of small things it's however God's leading in that hour so in that moment in Z's moment you had to receive the message of the hour that it's a day of small things it's not a and it was through the two prophets Zechariah and Hagi prophets with thus say the Lord that's what we got with brother Bron we got we got thus say the Lord and then what about John's day John says now you got to follow me and be baptized and water and I said show me where Moses ever told people to baptize Moses never told them to baptize look it up he said bring animals and you know you know the priest will wash with the labor and you can Waters a separation but there was no baptism in the Old Testament God was doing a new thing right and then once we get John's baptism established then Peter and Paul come around and say no now the Lord Jesus Christ right and then the church age all these Revelations were lost in the especially in the second third and fourth Church ages and then in the fifth Martin Luther gets the just shall live by faith but he has a lot of things that are similar with the Roman Catholic Church still God is bringing the church out so you had to follow Martin Luther you couldn't stay in the Catholic church right and so these people you know they just they just criticize no matter what you say so um again just it's so beautifully seen through the Bible and through uh the the scriptures yeah and brother's quotes here so let's let's get our Bibles ready here uh Victoria you got that so I think I'll get into this now where when do we want to stop about 3:45 yeah 40 minutes okay let me set time I said a 30 minute time some people didn't maybe didn't think I could do it some people just kidding maybe maybe a lot of people think I could do I don't know I could do it by God's grace um so Victoria Genesis 50 24 and 25 then virt do you want to get um Exodus 13:19 could you get that on then Caris can you get mark4 uh we already read Acts 19 so you'll get the next one nature you get uh Joshua 2432 okay 2432 I might as well on this one I said Exodus 13:19 see that right there you're right here Victoria y i called Victoria Genevie Caris just like my mom did uh 5024 okay that's the right chapter there's verse 17 19 right there 24 and 25 I might sit right by you here said his and surely surely Vis Jacob [Music] great reading here to class job Victoria I'm so proud of you I want to encourage the younger ones like Eden and Victoria keep reading you're only going to get better right keep reading all the time beautiful scripture you know uh Joseph makes them promise bring my bones out of Egypt you got to bury me now but bring me out and you're going to come out what a prophet right who knows how many years they waited over 400 I think 430 if I'm not somewh some around there there's some different thoughts on those scriptures so he's saying in 430 years carry my bones out of here I'm coming out of here what a promise my goodness that's a real prophet of God um okay so he says he makes him he makes him swear to carry his bones out okay now virtue Exodus 13:19 and Moses took the bones of he straightly straightly swor the children of Israel saying God will surely visit you and you shall carry upon my give it to class great job so 430 years later or so Moses actually fulfills that and carries out the prophet's desires so he's Buri that's his first barriel in Egypt okay um yeah right let's go now to n nature we'll come back to you K that's kind of what I want to do I want to show his two burials so Joshua 2432 nature and Bones of J children of Israel brought up and brought up out of of bir in in the of ground Jacob brought sons of H the father of Shem for aund pieces of became the inherit of all right give to Glass great job so 430 years later um Moses takes him out and then I think that to wait yeah 40 years after that maybe if I'm not mistaken right because they had to wander 40 years in the desert wow so it might have been 47 years later I could be wrong on that I could be wrong on the math there I'm not for certain about that um but then when Joshua comes in later then he brings the bones in and he puts them in chichim which is a city in manasse FYI if you're you know interested in you know bibl biblical Archaeology is 34 miles north of Jerusalem and two I'm sorry 7 miles southeast of Samaria so it's kind of like North was it North yeah southeast of Sam okay yeah so it's between Samaria and Jerusalem is she so he got buried there okay wonderful let's go back to that here all right so there's his two burials so he was buried in a worldly place right and then he was buried in the promised land that's the important word for the type I'm sorry for the antitype this is the type and then this is the anti-type or the real reality of what this was speaking of the type is the foreshadowing what is it speaking of it's speaking of these events okay so now Caris Mark 1 verse four John did baptize in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance for all the missions of all right give two class job so John baptized that uh John baptized that way for repentance to repent their sins and then remit their sins send their sins away um so I see like a Moses worshipper right in that day could have come up to John and said well no the day of atonement takes my sins away you see how that caus a problem Moses said the day of atonement the two scap or the Two Goats one goat who killed and the scapegoat that takes away my sins Moses said that's how my sins are taken away see how that cause a religious problem if someone couldn't recognize the spirit of God what but that's why I love it a real Christian will go up to the person like John the Baptist and say John who are you are you the Messiah what' John say no I'm a voice of the one in the wilderness crying prepare you the way of the Lord hallelujah amen I feel like preaching tonight amen uh better not preach I got to stop pretty short here um that's so beautiful my what what a beautiful thought there brother said there's only one Moses not everybody had to be Moses there's only one Moses right there's only one John the Baptist there's only one Prophet praise God but see God was moving on God was uh moving or brother said turning a corner that's how he likened unto a new ministry or message of an hour okay and Paul repeats that and of course uh the Ephesians the 12 Ephesians uh there in Acts 1918 they were taught of course by Apollos uh that John's baptism was for repentance and remission of sins but they didn't know about receiving the Holy Ghost okay now here's here's the the key word here when Simon CH us with me I was like oh like when he said Promised Land I'm like promise we have the spiritual Promised Land the Holy Ghost baptism in the soul is the promise of the father hey Haven you got your Bible so Haven get Luke 20 449 and then look at the back of Victoria Victoria do you want to get acts 14 virtue acts 233 can you get that then um Caris Matthew 11:29 and acts act 233 got then Matthew 11:29 got it all right perfect okay so Joseph's second burial is liken unto it was a was a type of our burial inside the promise the promise in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the promise of the Holy Ghost that's our promise praise God in other words we don't have a natural promis land sometimes I wish we did Brother Bank sometimes I wish I had some you know like 100 acres brother you know what's wrong with 100 acres sometimes I wish I had some problems but I'll take what I got God's been good to me um but we don't have a natural promised land it's a spiritual land of the baptism of the Holy Ghost so Luke 24:49 you help her with that okay yeah you're really close actually Luke 24 for Luke 2 oh I'm sorry here acts 14 you're right hun good job one I appreciate that okay so you'll be there in just a moment y sorry I forgot I had to do Haven in the row number two all right Haven read uh Luke 2449 and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but you T in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with the power from on high amen you to class right did you say promise in there did it say promise the promise of my father that's right okay there's promise so again Promised Land Joseph was in the promised land right and so when we get the Holy Ghost when we're seeking the Holy Ghost with the right baptism and the word of God the revelation of this hour We're in the promise we're part of the promise to Abraham right that God would bless all nations through the Messiah through Jesus Christ and that's another scripture let me see uh Galatians 4 let me look that up real quick I just want to fill everybody's hearts and Minds with the word of God yeah promise of the spirit yep so the promise of the Holy Spirit Galatians 3 14 that we might receive the promise of the spirit now to Abraham and a seed were these promises made how many children of the promise we got out there in this in the congregation today I'm living under a promise I'm not I I know go if I make a promise I'll fail I might fail but I know God will always keep his promise and I'm a child of promise I'm living by God's promise every day we got to remind ourselves of that God promised God's going to keep his promise God doesn't fail God doesn't lie God is not a man that he would lie right so we're Children of the promise Hallelujah he would do what he promised so he will fill you with the Holy Ghost right he'll uh for me I want to know other gifts and Ministries in my life I want to be faithful with the gifts he's given me that's why I keep drawing ey to God I don't want to miss God I definitely don't want to get complacent on God like Solomon because I've seen even I've seen a lot of message people as they get older they get complacent on God and I I can feel effects of that because I'm getting older but I don't want that to happen to me I want to keep I want to stir the gift of God up in my life praise God like Peter said stir up the gift of God in your lives don't becomes complacent and stale and church is no more wonder you don't have the Wonder of the Holy Ghost anymore you got to get yourself stirred up Hallelujah that's what I felt like this did for Simon it kind of stirred me up I don't know about you brother but this stirred me up like well I got to go study this out so I went my I new i b a new Bible and I wrote all this out on this the wide margin of my new Bible I put it on the video too so like I just s me up I'm like wow I want to remember this I don't want to forget this it's a beautiful type there okay acts 1:4 this is one one of my favorite scriptures regarding the Holy Ghost because Jesus said it's a baptism of the Holy Ghost okay so virtue or no is it yeah sorry vior sorry acts 1:4 please being together with command that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which he have heard of great give her two claps great job now the next verse was the one I really like if anyone tells you oh there's no such like denominational people say oh there's no such thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost where do you get that you're all about tongues and I'm like no I'm not all about tongues but I told them I said verse five for John truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence who's the one that created this language of baptism of the Holy Ghost it was Jesus amen and the church said amen red letters these are red letters this is Holy Ghost words God wants my soul baptized God wants my soul immersed with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah God wants each one of your souls like that thank you I appreciate that okay virtue um and then here Peter says this is what we receive we receive the promise of the father so uh acts 233 virtue therefore Beginning by the right hand of Cl exed in having re received the of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost shed for this which ye now seen and give class great there's the seen and heard thing or not thing but the seen seen and heard principle I found in the Bible even in the book of Acts Whenever there was signs wonders and miracles you could see it and hear it brother Bram said wherever Jesus is there was a lot of noise right in other words the Holy Ghost was moving in people's hearts and lives and Supernatural Miracles were done okay but again the promise see that Peter says this is the promise that God promised his people okay and who knows acts 238 what name are they baptized in the name of Jesus Jesus Christ right Jesus Christ all right girls great job there okay Matthew 11:29 this shows how the soulb to This Promise was for the soul it was more than just for the Flesh and the mind it was for the soul so Caris go ahead read that take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am me and and in heart and you shall find rest unto your souls great give it to you class great that's the same rest remember from Hebrews 4 Paul said labor to enter in that rest work to rest seems like oxymora right you need to work in order to rest in other words you got to crucify you got to mortify this flesh right work mortify thish flesh and you'll enter into the rest in your soul Okay now what's funny I'll tell you a funny funny story um this is this is actually a revelation I need to add to my list of Revelations I guess I'm using my my phone up there um but when brother Brooks I was listening at brother Brook's sermon that Zer was tell me about and reminded me about and in the sermon brother Brook says you can get the Holy Ghost in a mother's womb just like John the Baptist did right and I said amen right and John did get it but he didn't get it the soul he got it in the spirit well it just that was it was a reminder to me look how much I've grown since 2007 I'm glad I grew at least a little bit since 2007 hope I grew a lot I believe I grew a lot since 2007 but I used to believe yeah I used to believe you know 2007 I believe you could get the Holy Ghost in your soul like John the Baptist but I read later in John chapter 7 veres 37 38 39 the Holy Ghost was not given until Jesus was what glorified glorified good now that's the word glor he wasn't glorified until resurrected with a new body and then they had to wait 10 days uh sorry wait 40 days and then 10 more days 50 days to Pentecost then the Holy Ghost fell in the souls okay so that's one area where even brother Jesse I was ashamed that I said amen but at at the same time it's the best that I knew but I was still Amen in the word of God I had a pure heart brother bang he knows me he's known me since then I've had a pure heart by God's grace I didn't mean to amen the wrong thing you know but just it's an area where I've grown as well okay and then we know acts 191 to7 of course Paul baptizes them uh you know you've been baptized with John but now you got to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and you shall receive the Holy Ghost okay who who remembers how many people got the Holy Ghost in Acts 19 but remember might have mentioned it earlier this was a big huge Church wink wink I'm just winking big huge church it was BIG full of Faith anybody remember adults 12 people 12 people got the Holy Ghost it's acts 19:7 so they were they weren't big in number but they were big in faith okay so can we have a big church here yeah can God move amongst us here yeah we're we're a prime candidate for the Holy Ghost to move look at this we got a nice small church here God can move right amongst us through the through his holy spirit praise God but we got to be humble like brother said we got to keep the sin out we can't let religion become a a tradition there's nothing wrong with religion when it's pure religion okay there's nothing wrong with religion as long as it's pure religion because we have to bring our body into subjection if we're if we're real Christians should we have bad habits or good habits good we should have good habits we should have pure religion let me look up religion I think religion just means act let me get the actual definition so I can tell you some people say religion is not a good thing religion is just any uh ceremonies any ceremony like coming to church right song service prayer ceremony religious discipline see being disciplined right getting good habits keeping yourself free from the world that's it's like I Die daily it's that same idea Cru crucify the desires of the flesh mortify the Deeds of the flesh that's religion and the Bible said there's a pure form of that that's what we want we want pure religion praise God try not to get caught up in these Buzz words you know Buzz words these churches say uh I don't want a religion I want to Rel relationship well what about James 1: 126 I want religion and a relationship praise God in fact I'll have a better relationship if I got a good religion right right if I have impure religion I won't have a good relationship with the Savior the Lord Jesus but if I have pure religion I'll have a good relationship with Jesus so see how these churches they come up with these slogans and they just they don't go back to the word of God they're just it's just something like the Bible said they're ever learning there it is that's the truth right there I I really feel that from my heart my soul they're ever learning but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth they come up with fancy slogans cliches right like I was telling brother amen you know this U family member went they started a church in Columbus they moved up from Dayton to Columbus and they said we're in the city for the city now I love that saying but it's just become a cliche because now I think I think they support the LGB QT whatever agenda and they were Baptists at one time well now they've slid so far away but but see these cliches they just become a saying they don't really go back to the word of God but it should be that should be our slogan we're inacurate for the souls that AC praise God right so I I I love the word of God and we just got to be careful you know what we accept and believe of course I know you are I'm Just sh sh I over the years I picked these things up and like to point them out to you I think that'll be a help some time you know to you throughout your week and also you know in the years to come by God's grace so we'll go through these and then I want to share that list of of beautiful I I call them awesome Revelations the Lord has showed us over the years all right okay so here's the here's the uh what do they call it the kicker here's the climax of this thought it's such a beautiful thought right how many can see the the type and the anti-type so far promise Joseph had to be buried twice to have the promise so did the Ephesians they had to be buried in water twice to receive the promise well now here's the main thing we want out of this the main thing we want is the reward for being baptized right didn't didn't Jesus say you'll be rewarded he that overcomes will receive rewards yes right it's impossible to please God unless you have faith and God's a rewarder of those that love him Hebrews 11 he's a rewarder of those that diligently seek it there it is that's what I was looking for he's a rewarder he loves to reward his children just like I do who was it Cas did something right for me I Saida what do you need tell me anything you need if I'll buy it for you so I bought a little watch on Amazon then this morning she's you know wrapped around that blanket at our house I said honey you tell me I'll you tell me right now on Amazon I'm dramatizing at me I said tell me on Amazon if you want a robe I'll buy you a robe for the morning you know got to carry that uh that blanket around in the morning like that you tell me I'll reward you all the suppers she's cooked me you know all the all the breakfast she's Cooked our family she deserves a reward and if I if I think that way about my kids what does God think about you I'll tell you it's a million more than that but then sometimes we only learn through suffering so don't take that too far I'm not preaching Prosperity Gospel okay so the reward for J what was the reward for Joseph and I'm running out of time it's already almost 3:30 already my goodness that busy body um I'll just go through these okay the reward for Joseph getting his bones back in the promised land was a bodily Resurrection he was he was likely resurrected I believe with all my heart of course uh with job Abraham and Sarah David um all the Old Testament saints that were buried there new near Jerusalem the Bible said many not not few the Bible said many of the Saints Rose and were seen of many right so any saint that was Old Testament saint that was buried near Jerusalem got the bodily Resurrection praise God but you had to be buried there you had to be in the promise amen G that makes me happy because I'm in the promise of the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah I'm in the promise I'm not I'm not titles father son Holy Ghost I'm Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah I'm a part of that promise so Matthew 27:52 53 that's where we believe Joseph was resurrected and then he hasc it to Glory right 10 days later I don't know how long yeah they would have yeah they would have had been seen 10 days because they could have go to heaven without Jesus Jesus is the one who said open up the gates of Heaven remember that in Psalm I think it was Psalms uh 19 or 18 or something like that open up ye G he Gates of Heaven let the king of glory come in who is the king of glory the lord strong and mighty in battle amen hallelujah praise God and then job remember job saw job foresaw this he said for I know my redeemer liveth and I'll stand with him on the earth at the last in the last days and the Bible says they were in the last days in the days of Paul right because the last days are last 2,000 years so 2,000 years ago was the resurrection of Jesus that was the that was the beginning of the last days the last 2,000 years so job no doubt was there he saw that I will be in a brand new body and in my flesh I'll see God I'll see the Messiah I'll see Jesus right and then Ephesians 4:8 says uh Jesus led captivity captive those that were captive in Abraham's bosom he led them into a new captivity a Heavenly captivity Hallelujah the possession of the king of kings and Lord of Lord Lords the people of the promise amen hallelujah the people of the promise all right um okay so everybody see the reward if if he's Bap if he's reburied in the right place second time he gets a bodily Ascension to Glory Hallelujah and so church if we are uh buried or baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we also get a resurrection we get the first resurrection now when I left off here was uh Romans 6 Romans 6 says you're buried with him in baptism Romans 6:5 yes so that's why it was such a beautiful Revelation Simon's like Joseph Barry Joseph Barry he's like baptism is burial baptism okay so baptism represents a burial so that's why the the word is perfect there you're buried with him in baptism just like Joseph was buried naturally we're buried spiritually aren't you glad brother Vang the old Vang is gone he's buried Hallelujah the old Jesse the old Austin he's gone and buried Hallelujah never to be seen Again by God's grace buried and then there's also the Colossians verse that says you're buried I'm not mistaken yeah bury with him in baptism okay girls remember that when you got baptized you were buried that old life died remember he condem Jesus condemned all your sin he paid for all your sins and now you're forgiven right now you have a new life and you can serve God in the newness of the spirit all right remember that Hallelujah good good memory all right now I think that's what I left off that chart I kind of left that off that chart I didn't mean to do that okay so let's finish up here well yeah and I'll go to that list real quick it's almost 3:30 here okay so so what is our res what is our Resurrection so Joseph got a resurrection we get a resurrection it's called the first resurrection that's found in Revelation 21-5 right the Bible says all those who overcame the Beast and didn't receive his Mark right all those that that fought against the Beast and either were beheaded against the Beast or they they didn't receive the Beast system the Bible said all them get a first resurrection praise God yesen they had when you mentioned the last days how do we know we're in the last days yeah CU all the scriptures I have a video there's 14 proofs we're in the last days when uh the Bible says when Israel starts Gathering to her Homeland it's the last days it's uh summer draws nigh so what what happens at the end of summer all the fruits are what harvested harvested yeah so when we see Israel coming together like this and they're coming from all around the world uh coming back and they have their own they have their own Nation they have their own flag they've had now since 1948 when we see all that happen they had over 70 years when we see that happening we know summer's nine it's very close then we also see the other conditions uh there's 14 on there I can't remember them all now but remind me we'll watch that video that list all the verses on there 14 Bible verses the end time good question you ever seen class that's a great question now I don't I don't know if brother Works would mind me sharing this but uh in 2012 he also in 2013 he also said the Lord told me this is the last uh this is the last 13 in other words he was saying we will not have 2113 so brother Brooks told me that in the name of the Lord so that means the raptures within however many years that is that's quite a statement to make so he was right on the other ones you know oh yeah we had a friend too uh brother Brooks told me numerous message preachers would die in 2012 there was five prominent ones and then somebody come over from overseas I forget who it was we were just talking about it the other day can't remember who was and then they heard about brother Brooks's prophecy and in their country it was some overseas country they had numerous preachers die that year as well so it's quite a statement um so you just got to watch that now none of us will lived to 20 2113 but yes what you mean the last 13 like 20 so so 100 years from 2013 yes oh so that's what brother Brooks said that's what he said that's great yeah we're I mean trusting it is I told I don't know if I told the church this too but we were sitting out in our car a couple years ago when brother Brooks well four years ago when brother Brooks was here no it have been six years ago sorry and christien was pregnant with jev we didn't know if it was going to be a boy or a girl yet and brother books is like I almost want to prophesy this is going to be a boy but I feel like he's I'm not I'm not I'm not and then we found out it was a girl right but then he told me later he said I knew the next one was going to be a boy so I mean isn't that interesting like he foretold something and it came to pass and he's interpreted numerous dreams from Simon and different brother cam different ones like that we would call that like a minor prophecy gift you know minor Prophet I don't know what he said lately but I just remember that I'm like brother Brooks almost gave me a thus say Lord I'm going to have a son but he didn't say which one but I had a son another one by God's grace so just really interesting how the Holy Spirit works like that so so we Ascend into Glory because the Bible said we meet him in the air did you know what at some point in the future Girls by God's grace we're going to be able to stop in the middle of the air you're going to be able to stand on air everybody hear that you're going to meet Jesus in the air you're going to be able either float or fly or stand in the air it's not a meeting on the ground it's a meeting in the air and God's own son will be the leading one the meeting in the air uh the there the Bible calls it the first resurrection most church members don't know there's two resurrections there's the first resurrection that's the Rapture of the Gentile Church age and then there's the second Resurrection the white Throne judgment that's in later in the chapter that's verses 12 through 18 I think 12-5 12-8 I just put on the video yesterday and remember I read it this morning if you're baptized in water you are guaranteed to be resurrected with Jesus so see all this fits together if if if if if Joseph could be baptized or buried in the land he got Resurrection if we can be glory we can be buried in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we will have a resurrection hallelujah it's perfect it's beautiful it shows how we must have our rebaptism if we're just baptized unto repentance and then I put that chord on there brother Ram said I command you in the name of the Jesus Christ be baptized re-baptized in the name of Jesus Christ if you've been baptized in titles father Son and Holy Ghost all right now let me see here okay all right can anybody see this yeah that's really small I'm sorry that's really and I this app doesn't let me uh yeah you're going to strain your eyes and I'll pay for your next doctor appointment okay your eye doctor appointment just let me know I'll give you a stiping on that um but these are just some of the major awesome Revelations God has shown us over the years I personally think the four classes of Believers is probably the most powerful Revelation that I've seen because it fits so many the parable the four grounds Paul says there's four types of vessels uh revelation 22 says you're you'll be in one of four conditions I mean that ties the Bible together thus sayith the Lord to me it's so beautiful I you never learn that I mean you'll never learn that out in denominations it's it's unheard of they they don't have like brother said we have prophetic insight and I know I'm getting close to 340 my wife's about getting her arm ready to wave there she warming up her arm there okay so um that to me is probably the most beautiful Bible Revelation because brother he remember he said there wasn't three crosses there he said there was four trees because Judas hung himself so at the same time there wasn't three there was four no denomination is going to catch that you know had your wise virgin Jesus foolish save thief and you got your makeb believer Judas you got your unbeliever the thief on the cross I mean it it's beautiful it's it's so clear um I love it okay now this is the one I put up here this is the new one Simon had uh rebaptism is foreshadowed in the Old Testament everybody's tired of here I'm going to try to finish up I know it's been a long week of sickness so God bless you for and we came early too um I love this from a couple years ago cam showed he preached on the Mount Zion and he just preached it but then as I studied the Lord opened up that's why we have a Mount Zion Showdown and how Jerusalem was uh was uh uh it was in uh you couldn't defeat it what's the word for you can't defeat something what unbeatable yeah it's unbeatable in Invincible that's yeah apparently it was invincible but it was through the Waterway through the secret passage that they defeated that uh the Mount Zion Showdown right and David represented Christ and so what ram calls the Rapture of Mount Zion Showdown how do we get in the rapture we got to do this secret works of God we got to Humble ourselves right we got to do the secret the secret things belong to the Lord and to us that we might do all the words of this law it's beautiful I love it um the Joshua type Manassa one more land but Joshua said you got to possess your own land before you go get other land and that's a perfect type how can a man of God rule the church if he can't rule his own house beautiful type and I got that from a pen or a Calvary preacher online he not even message believer I'm like wow what a revelation now Church don't feel bad because brother got a lot of Revelation from Clarence Lin a Baptist preacher somebody tried to Corner me on that the other day they said what do you mean you can get you can't get Revelation from a denominational preacher I said didn't brother brandom get the uh get some nice thoughts from L he's like yeah I stand corrected thank you he actually received some correction probably praise the Lord um Simon's Revelation uh it almost seems like the church age book is in Joshua 18 there's seven tribes that don't have have any um any land yet and so uh they send spies out and they bring he said bring back a book with with seven uh with seven uh portions of land right before we can place them right before Joshua died and brother baham gave us a seven Church AE book right before he died so we could place the seven Church ages I mean it beautiful um this is one I haven't preached on too much but remember there was partial fear of the Lord I I remember Naomi and we were talking about that fear of the Lord sermon from almost a little over a year ago that really blessed me I preach the cams too they really there too but I also found there's a partial fear of the Lord that's kind of like a dangerous fear of the Lord where you don't have enough fear of the Lord and that was in um 2 Kings 17 these Babylonians that moved in after God dispersed Israel lions were killing all these Babylonians but then they realized if we just have a little bit of fear of the Lord the Lions won't kill us anymore and that's what the Bible said God didn't let the Lions kill them anymore because they had a little bit of fear of the Lord so that might be like a make believer type or a foolish virgin type but there's something powerful in there just a little bit of the fear of the Lord will keep a lot of evil away from you so I'm going to study I'm kind of put that that one on the Shelf can't preach this one the wise virgin Old Testament type you remember this this was December yeah 2020 that's right numbers 2633 zof I can never say his name zof Fahad I can never say I'm almost out of time he had five virgin daughters and remember they were the ones that wanted to possess the land they had their their dad had no Sons so they wanted to possess the land that's a good type of the five wise virgins they wanted to possess the promises it's a beautiful type there I keep using the word beautiful tremendous that's my favorite word there brother Ram said this thus say the Lord Genesis 18 God Discerning Sarah's heart behind him he said that's thus say the Lord that's the last he said that's a type of my ministry that's the last sign to Abraham sea before the Rapture talk about a type that is awesome brother opened up his finger he said Lord what am I doing am I doing something wrong am I doing something wrong on the job show me my Ministry he opened up his Bible and pointed Genesis 24:7 Eliezer brother said that's me I'm getting the bride ready for Jesus like eler got a bride ready for Isaac these beautiful Revelations remember this one Joseph's life has all eight steps on the Statue of a perfect man all eight it's pretty awesome by God's grace everybody's ready for me to close right sorry I'm kind of zealous for this one here um Zeal this is another one amen and I were just talking about this one look at the power there's a thought in here there's a powerful thought about Zeal Phineas was given the priesthood forever just because he was zealous to stop the plague but Saul lost the kingdom forever because he was a compromiser and didn't have Zeal to obey the word of God so one man is given the entire Kingdom forever because of his Zeal another man loses the kingdom forever because of a lack of zeal that's why I'm glad when like brother Samuel comes in and say you got a lot of energy you got a lot of zeal brother Jesse that's what I want to have by God's grace there's types in the Bible about that and I can't lose that I got to labor to keep that oh yeah Proverbs 8:30 the Loos dance before the Lord Jesus was the first dancer in the Bible every remember that one by God's grace the first person dancing was Jesus the L before the foundation of the world Jesus was dancing judges 14:17 Samson's mystery wasn't revealed on the first day or the sixth day Samson's Revelation was revealed on the seventh day Cam said he got that from a preacher overseas beautiful type of Revelation 10:7 the mystery of God is finished on the last day it was made known from the husband to the bride right Samson the husband he made known the Revelation on the seventh day to the bride and then Zechariah 101 and then Joel 223 through 26 ask of the Lord reain in the time of the latter rain so that's that's a revelation I think we're going to see that if we live to see the rure we'll have to pray for the latter rain we'll have to be in the channel of praying saying God Send the Rain God Send the Rain God Send the Rain weren't they praying before the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost weren't they praying 10 days and then Joel 223 brother says the fullness of Pentecost will be in the bride that's thus sayth the Lord all right let's stand to our feet God bless bless everybody I got uh oh I'm already am I passed my time yeah brother brother I could have predicted that no I'm sorry I I we'll finish up here um girls we'll do the songs next time unless wait no you got to go that's right we'll do the songs next time by God's grace musicians you can come we'll just do a real short prayer how many enjoy the word of God tonight good if you want to watch that video like I said we just put it out there yesterday try to give Simon some credit on there did a wonderful job by God's grace it's good to be in the house of the Lord today any other last last needs before we were dismissed here any other desires anyone need prayer or anything like that but aw yeah I'm getting a pretty aggressive pit night so it's pray well that's right yeah nothing happens yeah so aggressive pitball Pitbull he's going to train up the dog here so really need God to protect him why don't you come up here brother let's pray for you and then
