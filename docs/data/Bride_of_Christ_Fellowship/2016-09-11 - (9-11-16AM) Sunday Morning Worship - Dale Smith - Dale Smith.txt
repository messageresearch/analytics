unmar favor we're trusting in the blood of Jesus Hallelujah Lord that is able to cleanse every sinner they will call upon your name we're here this morning to hear the word of God Hallelujah Lord the highest form of spiritual will worship in the framework of the local assembly Hallelujah is the revealed word of the hour yes yes Lord we're just asking Lord as we could receive that word into our hearts Lord you said it would engraft it Lord it would make it a part of us Lord and Lord as we've been connected to the root Lord and as that branches reach up to heaven your Prophet said that every time that we speak the name of Jesus Lord that the faithful heart of God God will pulsate the blood of Christ down into the heart of every believer GL so we're speaking that name of Jesus Lord that we may receive the Life Source godes Lord From The Great Dynamo Power Station Lord God yes father that is in glory this morning Father and we're drawing on that eternal life oh God that that that never had a beginning and it never shall have an end Hallelujah so we pray father that as we call upon your name this morning Father that we will receive Lord all that you would have for us this morning feed us spiritual food in due season father let us recognize our day and its message may we see Lord the end time signs Lord that are being made clear by prophecy Lord that the types and shadows of the Bible the Old and the New Testament Lord that are being fulfilled in our very day Lord our very hour that we are the scripture being fulfilled this day this scripture is fulfilled in our lives God we pray help us oh God as we commit our souls Lord save the lost and heal the sick Lord revive the backslider and encourage the believer as we careful to praise you for it in Jesus lovely name we pray the church said am amen amen I don't know how y'all up here are but one from the south and we like we like interaction amen when you believe it know me if it hurts amen well just let me know that you're with me praise the Lord yes sir now if you have your Bibles very familiar scripture reading to us we want to uh read out of the Book of Joel and if you'll turn there with me this morning morning into the second chapter of Joel somehow another when I pray my eyes leak I don't know why that is Glory uh the old song of the church said that tears are language only God understands so I guess I was speaking in Tong while I was yes sir sir all right yes sir amen now in Joel's uh gospel we'll call it it's good news isn't it right yes sir and we want to be in chapter two and uh I want to start reading at Verse 18 just so it'll lead us into this uh Prophecy of the restoration amen and in verse 18 it says and then will the Lord be jealous over his land and pity his people that's and where we we we instantly begin to see the possessiveness of God that he's identifying the people and the land as his personal possessions right y the Lord will answer and say unto his people right behold I will send you corn and wine and oil yes so we realize that corn is word wine is stimulation a revelation and the oil is the spirit of God Amen all right so we see these types that we could not we could not declare these types to you emphatically as thus sayith the Lord had we not heard these things from a Vindicated Prophet amen I'm glad that I'm not standing here waiting on my theology to kick in praise God Amen but I know that my neology will work every timeall and I know that the word of God is true and he says here that and ye shall be satisfied therewi amen are we satisfied with the word of God are we satisfied with the revelation of that word are we satisfied with his life praise God he said I will no more make you a reproach among the Heathen but I will remove far off from you the northern Army and I will drive them into the land Barren and desolate with his face towards the east sea and his hinder part toward the uttermost sea and his stink shall come up and his ill uh Savor shall come up because he hath done great things fear not o land be glad and rejoice for the Lord will do great things Be not Afraid the beasts of the field for the pastures of the Wilderness do spring for the tree beareth her fruit the Fig Tree and the vine do yield their strength be glad then ye children of Zion so it's speaking of both Jew and Gentile he said and be glad ye uh children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath given you the former Reign moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former uh rain and the latter rain in the first month yes so we see now that the so so what's happening is the is the serwer and the and the reaper are overrunning each other amen what is that telling us amen that there's a that there's a reaping that's going to take place in Israel to those four those but there's a sewing of the word to Israel but there's also a reaping of the Gentile bride so one the former and the latter range speak of a sewing rain and a reaping rain all in the same season so we see what's happening friends it's a we're we're actually re we're actually uh uh preventing the word to go to Israel by our presence here that's right amen Oho something's got to be happening oh if we could see what was happening in the Supernatural realm and the floors shall be full of wheat speaking of the reaping time and the vat shall overflow with wine and oil so we're at the season of the spirit and the revelation of the world word that has come in its full harvest season amen and watch what he says here in verse 25 for our text and I will restore unto you the years that the locusts have eaten and the korm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which i s among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God you see what he's he's talking about here is a restored worship amen yes amen and you shall eat in PL and be satisfied and praise the name of your God that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed may the Lord bless the reading of the word yes you make yourselves comfortable this [Music] morning I would like to title the message this morning uh restoring get up here to my page the re uh the I change that the resurrection of true worship from Extinction amen and we like to sub title it the way of God here this morning we we're just such a tremendous text that we would read yes sir many areas of uh study that we could go into there this morning but I want to start with this one thought and we got a lot of as I said a lot on my Fork here but where where job is talking about that I will restore unto you all these years or all the damage brother B preached to us a couple of messages where he dealt with the Palmer worm and the canker worm yes and the brid tree and what more we had spent a lot of time on that but just in a nutshell he showed how each one of these insects was actually a different stage of the same bug yes and it started out in its infancy and then how that it matured into its final stage in the Palmer worm right and that each one of these bugs had a certain effect upon the tree that it had that it had infested yes and it had started off eating the fruit and then the leaves and down uh into the into the bark and into the very life of the tree it had it had reduced the tree to a stump that tree he tells us was the bride tree yeah and he brings it down in stages now brother Adam had a way of bringing these things of Realms ages dispensations all these different things and sometimes you can't really draw timeline and and put all these lines in there if you did you would have so much overlaid on each other you wouldn't be able to make any sense of it and so uh the best way that I can uh we we have what we have an icon on our computer and then under that icon there will be a window and then inside of that window there will be links that will take us to different windows and we can go deeper and deeper and deeper into the thought as we click on the link is that right yeah and so only in this age did God send us a prophet that would preach us a message that would actually have that kind of an effect right when the actual computer would actually be designed so that we could give that as an example the two run concurrent with each other tells us that we see modern achievements and as there's a modern achievement is uh uh comes to being he said then that's exactly what God is doing in the church amen and so as the church then has advanced in certain areas like you gave the example of the ox and coming up through the uh the the the car and then from the car to the airplane and the airplane to the astronaut you're showing us this advancement of technology and so we we confuse that pattern throughout the Bible and throughout the message it just you you just see how the advancement of of of of uh of of technology or uh photo uh photography or uh whatever it might be each one of these advancements will just show how that the church has actually advanced in in in in in in in in its uh uh understanding and revelation of the word so amen he gives us these insects and they as they destroyed so he starts back at Ephesus and brings it through what brother Ram called for four death Messengers right and these four death Messengers brought the church down to the time of Luther now that he says is four death Messengers brought the church down he said then so also it'll take four life Messengers to bring the church back to a restoration so and so we see that at the time of the uh uh Reformation of the church under Luther Wesley Pentecost there's your three first three stages but then the fourth stage of the life messenger then would would come as the prophet to the Gentiles and that he would actually restore the church back into its full uh manifestation it's full understanding of the word everything that was lost in Paul's day would be rest stored back in our day amen so we see this and so that's why we want to call it the resurrection of true worship from extinction because we realize that what it had what the church was in the day of Pentecost by the time we get to Luther's age it was a a dead church right it was completely it was dead to the point there was almost no life left in it enti time but then we find in Luther's age a little light be to Spring out in a restoration and then now it's being restored back in a process and now we're coming right to the end time where the scripture says that it would be so close that it would deceive the very elected if it was possible amen and so that now that we have a h a a church with character istics of the true church but yet inside of that individual that the life would be missing brother says I don't care how right you are in your Doctrine he said if you miss that life you miss it that's all so we want not just to be an outward appearance a form of godliness but we want to have the very power of the word in our hearts amen you love the Lord this morning Hallelujah yes so we want to use a Bible example here just because it it it fits so well we find that job the Bible says that job was a perfect man yes don't you wish you had that testimony yes sir and so here was job and and brother tells us all about job's life and how that he visited the Widow and the Bible tells us these things and we find that he visited the the the fatherless and the Widow and the and the and that he was sight to the Blind and he was all these things and he was a he was a generous man he was a wealthy man he was a upstanding man the Bible says that that he shoot evil amen you know that word to shoot means to turn it off amen amen just turned it off yes just hit the off button there and uh so when evil showed itself he just turned it off amen oh man we take a lesson from that praise God and so we we we we find that that job now that that his his worship was was so impeccable his integrity was so to the point that that that that that God actually used him as an example of every believer as to as to what God could do in that individual's life and he took job to the very extremes and we we would wonder why a man that was perfect a man that is shoot evil a man that was that was had integrity and these kind of things that God would allow Satan to attach himself to that man's life in such a way that it would destroy his children it would cause his wife to turn on him that it would cause his church board directors Amen to to stand and with and and not even speak to job for seven days while he sat there amen with ooing sores all over his body with infection running out of his his body fever running through his body no doubt the man was in absolute misery but yet nobody landed a hand to help it the Bible says that job said in an ash Heath amen with a broken piece of potard and he had take the he would scrape the heads off the boils and we know this by experience of what people used to do that he would they would actually have to squeeze the the puss and the and the infection out of those sores and then put the ashes on top of it to get some relief from the pain and the infection that was going through his body and I've seen a picture of a disease that looked very much like what job had and it was just a hideous thing job was very hideous to look at with the the sickness that was upon the man's life the Bible says that he was full of sores from the top of his head to the bottom of the seat yes sir and then here was a man that was in such pain and his wife you would have thought that she would have come and she would have she would have she would have brought a a cold cloth and laid it upon his head and then she would have said oh Joe this one in the middle of your back you can't reach it he said she would she said let me let me help you joob let me let me try to relieve some of your suffering right wowow but instead she just looked at him said you need to do call Dr Koran right brother right you call do death see if you you just need to curse God and die right what a what a pitiful thing to pull the plug on you Joe with you those keeping you around anymore I about what her thoughts was you're done you're finished there ain't no hope for you Joe spull the plug on you get the insurance right I mean what a heartless thought yes sir yes sir but yet he says woman you you speak like a foolish person the Lord gives the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord the Bible says that job never accused God foolishly yes so much that you say say why would God allow this man to go through all these things yes but we find that there was a point in job's life as he sat there and monst of suffering and no doubt he could look out into the burnt field where his crop used to be where the scripture says a fire came down from heaven right consumed his crops he can look out in the and The Paddock and the pastures where his his donkeys and his camels had once grazed you can see that they were all gone for this the the the the Sabian I think it was came and took all of his animals away and killed his servants he can see the little little Huts down there and the little Barracks is where where his servants used to live and he can see out behind him the Tombstones where he buried his Faithful Servants wow he can look up on the hill at where there was a pavilion where the where where his family had built a pavilion and and his eldest son had a place up there and he could see where the Pavilion had was laying in Ruins yes he could see amen seven little tombstones up there right where he buried his Darlings right no D that his heart was breaking you know when you look at that little one why is the baby of the family always a sport one it's a truth right right I married a baby spoil rotten I'm still spoiling her tomorrow's her birthday 51 still the baby mama's baby she can see anything she want I got a baby in my family my little my little baby bird they call her it's 22 years old got a beard and big old strapping boy stronger than I am he's still the py he gets anything he wants I have to suffer why he gets anything he want it's pitiful but no doubt old Joy looked up there and there was a baby's grave up there yes sir yes sir he could see that baby's grave no doubt of mother her father that's lost a child amen the Heartbreak but here job had lost all his children yes yes he lost everything he looking at himself sitting there and and he and the Bible saids that he said oh he said if it was possible he said I would I would go to the door of the Lord I would go and I would knock upon his door and I would I would ask him I would I would sit on the porch in The Rocker with him right I would ask him why why Lord he said but but who can touch a holy God right right he said I need a man a d that can in between in the G when could touch the hand of God and can reach down and could hold the hand of a sinner somebody I need a mediator Hallelujah he said but I would ask God he said I see the flower faded I see the grass that it then it turns brown in the winter he said I said but the tree and brother brand says the very stump that he had burned out out he said he looked from that Ash Heap was coming a sprig yeah that was coming up from the roots right the Bible says in job it says at the very scent of water the tree will find that water it'll spring up amen and job he he could look at the grass he could look at the flower he could see the trees said they come back he said but can a man live again right a man once he's extinct right once he's gone his breath is gone from him his his bone his worm and eaten his body his his bones have dried can a man right brother Raam said that God brought job to that place so that he would ask that place right amen because God had established in his word forever that a word had to be spoken right before it could be manifested amen amen and so now he wanted a man to speak the word so he knew what he had to do to job in order to he had to bring job and put him on the endangered species list yeah Jo was going to be an endangered species and he knew that that once he was gone he said he said we go we go by the way of the Grave are we're remembered for a season yes but then we're forgotten and they begin to think about our Prodigy afterwards but we're forgotten yes sir he said but can a man live again yes said when he asked that question ohow he said all of a sudden the spirit of God came down upon the prophet amen hallelujah yes he said he stood upon his feet and the lightning flashed and the Thunder Roll and was straighten his shoulders and he looked out and he saw himself in the resurrection Oh my he knew that God was going to raise him again that once he pass from the earth he knew that God was going to raise him up again and that he would see the Redeemer amen amen he would see his go he would see his Kinsman the one that had paid the priz the one that had stood in the Gap he would see the comforter amen he would see amen the the the the the the one that would there would mediator for him yes he prophesied he said I know in the latter day yes amen that that my redeemer liveth Hallelujah and that he'll stand upon the Earth and I Shall Behold Him with his eyes hallelujah what was it God was going to resurrect himen that perfect form of worship that job had he was going to bring it from Extinction and he was going to bring it back on the day of Pentecost because it was lost Through the Ages the church ages yes but it was restored under John right and it restored the perfect word yes oh I love this and when the perfect word came into the water that Prophet said Lord I have need to be baptized of thee yes am and Jesus says but it behooveth us to fulfill all righteousness yes and so now he enforced John to baptize Jesus right to the John the priest and Prophet to baptize amen the word Amen brother R said even when the word almighty God himself standing there he still gave all authority to John Hallelujah he said the two I love this quot he said the two rulers of the [Music] world standing there in the war oh hallelujah what was it he said it was that that that one that would introduce Christ was was the ruler of the world oh so what did we have in our day amen and they missed it the presence of God with unrecognized in our day right Hallelujah yes so now well we laid a do a little bit of found Foundation now we start getting into our notes Hallelujah so now then job when was buried there left a revelation of true worship that would now stay in the earth and when Abraham came on the scene Abraham when Sarah had died he went and bought a piece of land that's right and when he bought that piece of land and he buried his wife there he left instruction s that they would bury him there too amen now then we're just going to follow this thought in the message my redeemer living He said now job when he seen this so it's talking about seeing the Redeemer and Abraham saw it so how did he see it he saw it amen when he parted the animals right and the the smoking furnace went down between them consumed the animals but he didn't part the doves remember that he was showing that it was Christ the sin Bearer he was seeing Jehovah uh the the the quickener he was seeing the one Jehovah Gyra Jehovah shama he saw and he saw the vision and the type fulfilled in Isaac that job had saw when he saw the Redeemer amen I'll read it to you and Abraham saw it and he buried Sarah near job purchased the field bought it with money so that it would be assured and put a witness before it that he was assured he bought the field for a bearing place and then Abraham himself when he died he was buried with him also in the same field yes sir watch now uh I believe it's in another place and we'll get to it but brother Ram said uh I think it's right here yeah brother says Abraham job saw it in a vision and Abraham saw it by Isaac so he actually acted out what job saw in the Redeemer right amen when Jo saw the Redeemer standing upon the Earth and now where he said I know that I'm going to be in the resurrection because I saw myself there in a vision amen and Abraham knew that those Visions never failed and so he said now then because he gave me this son from the dead he said I know he'll bring him again from ashes a perfect time amen of restoring something that would gone into Extinction back into a living man estation job was going to be brought back from Extinction Abraham knew that if he was buried near uh uh job that because he could see the type that was in his own life through Isaac him being the the the H bringing forth the promised son Isaac being a type of Christ amen carrying the the the the the wood the cross upon his back amen and so he saw that in Isaac and so now then Abraham had the same same Revelation amen am Abraham be Isaac and when Isaac died he was buried with Abraham under the same vision the same thought the same deep calling to the Deep the same I know my redeemer Liv oh you see that under the same inspiration the same worship and every time they went down they went down under that same Revelation and so we understand that in this last days that there be two groups there will be the dead in Christ and then who went down with the Revelation and they will come back up with the same Revelation they went down with it was a la your Revelation to each age they will come up under that just like the those that are alive and remain Hallelujah because we know we have that Revelation yes sir my redeemer liveing Isaac Jacob and died way down in Egypt away from his land he was a crippled man he walked different what he used to walk because one night he come in contact with the angel of God the Lord touched him and made him walk different he had an evidence that he had been a h of God Amen I believe in evidence hallelujah amen he said and God had been a hold of him and that's the way when he got that evidence that old crippled hip that he walked there on making him walk straight when he was on this side of the on this side a deceiver a great healthy strong deceiver but on the other side a limping Prince that had been with God touched different had a blessed hope within him he walked different he acted different he lived different right when he was getting ready to die down in Egypt think of it now with that inspiration before the resurrection given to him in a measure before the resurrection he said I know something is going to happen up yonder in the promised land one of these days so upon the that very place that this inspiration he said come here my boy Joseph which was a prophet and he said come here and lay your hand on this this wrestled place that's place where he had been smitten in in the small of his leg there in his hip he said you come lay your hand right there Hallelujah because this is my evidence this is my proof this is my B of Amen that God's word is true I know I was once lost but now I'm found he said you lay your hand on The Old Rugged Cross you're laying your hand upon the promised word of the hour amen amen so it's when I got my name Chang right amen oh praise God he was holding on to something friends I'm lay your hand on this wrestled place where I've been swear to me by the god of Heaven that you'll not bury me down here for he know watch that it was essential that he was gathered with them people right oh friend don't you realize amen he said all these people may not learn it be you're boast of worldly Fame but they have all received their Pentecost bapti in Jesus and I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them I'm one of them people amen I'm going to be identified it's essential that I be gathered with that people Glory that's the reason today we want to sing and put our hand upon The Old Rugged Cross and take away what the Lord's despised you though it be criticized though it be made fun of though I may be uh h a great popular guy like uh up here like that one day I was a little boy run around town here kind of popular among the so forth the Young Folks but I seen something one day that come down in here and it took the place of the limping side on the other side yeah amen oh brother was a great strong he was a boxer and he was a a Woodsman and he was a hunter and he was all these things but one day he had to come over on to limping side amen oh I'm glad to be on the limping side tonight hallelu glory and I tell you brother when I feel that resurrecting transforming power of the Lord Jesus Christ circling through a human body yes that gives a perfect Assurance there's more joy in that in five minutes than there is in all the worldly pleasure that could be praise be to God we find people today that will trade the presence of God Amen all the all the glories of Heaven amen just for a moment of the pleasures of sin for a season right brother right Moses amen counted amen all of that is nothing all the pleasures of Egypt Amen to be in the presence of God for that one minute am watch it goes on Jacob to Joseph when Joseph died down there in Egypt he said now don't he said don't you bury me here because I know someday you're going to leave why because he had a prophecy that had been handed down from his father Abraham that said that they would sold Jour in a Strange Land for 400 years and they would be brought out with a mighty hand and he knew that and understood that to be the word of God Amen now he says uh I want to give you a test oh he says so you just leave my bones on the outside of the ground amen oh my I want to give a testimony every testimony I can that I that I believe it that's right and after I'm dead you just leave my bones for a testimony he said he could uh he he could said so much as job I know my redeemer living amen for he had seen the whole thing dramatized he had seen like like job and we read this a little bit ago but job saw it in a vision Abraham saw it by Isaac Jacob saw it by wrestling and now Joseph saw it now this is where I want to touch on for just a little bit Joseph saw it in his own life amen amen Joseph saw the Redeemer the prophecy that was given to job he saw it in his own life amen now watch boy this is good all right I can sit right here and cry I just have myself a good oldfashioned slobbering ball and snot and fit right here yes sir amen Joseph saw it by his own life he's seeing that he was a particular boy that he was a Seer there was something about him he could see Visions he couldn't understand it he even went and seen told his mother and father and they tried to correct him and he seen the sheaves all bowing to to bowing to his he couldn't understand it but then the next thing he found that he was betrayed by his Brethren and he said what am I portraying here right amen how many times friends yes yes sir have you looked in the face of Calamity in your own life look in the face of of failure look in the face of face of mishap look at the face of rejection yes by betrayal wonder what part of this I betray now yes you know because we're the body of Christ beautiful yes everything that was in him is in US sir so we're portraying that he he feels your suffering he feels your pain he feels the things that you feel he suffered in every way that you suffer right and so Joseph he was there betrayed of his brother in the bottom of a pit wondering why did they throw me down in here right why I didn't do anything to him and he says what am I portraying here yes sir beautiful beautiful he said what is this for knowledge that I'm receiving oh he watched his own life wow he was having a dejo or something he didn't even know what it was right yes yes because at this time in his life he knew that he was portraying something this is something but there was a vision that his brothers were going to bow down to him he knew he wasn't going to die in there he knew there was more to it Glory he knew there was a greater part but he didn't understand what part of amen beautiful when he see his life begin to move and deceived by his brothers supposing to have been killed thrown into a hole taken up again he didn't know what was happening right he had to go down in the pit yes the type of Christ the Redeemer but he didn't know it yes he just went in there wondering oh God my God my God why not forsaken amen yes taken up again saw his in prison in the dungeon went to hell preached to the souls in prison right hallelujah praise God he saw God was with him whatever he done he was the prince of prosperity the world prospered everywhere Joseph was there was prosperity for he was the prince of prosperity and him foreshadowing Christ wherever Christ there is prosperity yes now look at Joseph seeing it then when he know that he had that everything that he did he seen his brother betray him and finally come to him not knowing who he was and bow to him reverently so now was he see he said hey this is the vision yeah right this is a vision it's finally after all those years it it's coming to pass glor let's see finally come to him not knowing who he was bow before him reverently and those who had crucified him as it was throw him in the ground those who had sold him to the Egyptians all those that mistreated him speaking of the Jews speaking of Israel speaking of Christ showing all these things and him the great Prince every knee bowed every tongue confessed and they trembled because he said we have slain our brother and all about that how that it was to be a foreshadow Joseph he knew that he would be the conditions he knew that that would be the conditions of the world at the coming of the Lord Jesus so he made mention of his bones after all of these things after it all played out he didn't understand all the way back here right but by the time it had come to the end and he had seen his life fully type out the coming Redeemer he made mention of his bones he said I've got the same Revelation that job had that Isaac had that Jacob had that that Abraham had I've got the same Revelation and I know that my redeemer live it leave my B here take them down there to I know that's where the resurrection take place amen and I want to be a part of it hallelujah amen it's essential yeah that I be buried down there hallelujah oh Hallelujah brother said where is it today it's essential that we be buried in Christ yes Glory yes sir Joseph he said he knew by by by seeing his own life brother says and any man can watch your own life and tell about what you are if you just check up on yourself whether you're really a Christian or not watch the things that you do and what you say your associations and so forth amen you'll find out really whether you really got anything there Hallelujah yes sir can I go a little longer yes sir yes sir [Music] Amen brother tells us frequently that the world has its scientists said but God has his scientists too that's right that's right we find that it was in the early 60s late 50s early 60s were they actually began to understand genetics they be they understood genetics all the way back in the time of Darwin as far as natural selection and and you know uh you know one flower or bring forth another flower but it wasn't until the the time of the electron microscope being invented in the I think in the 50s somewhere along in there that they were able to look down and to see and actually break down the genetic codes as far as what what the gene actually was and what the man was actually made of DNA and be able to understand these things and then so it was actually uh they they understood the the the breeding processes and things like that they've been able to do it for several hundred years uh uh with just cattle and things like that all the way back into the time of the 1600s they were actually they were actually actually later than that even back in Mesopotamia they were cross treating animals different uh different breeds of dogs and things like that to produce these big mastiffs and different things like that and they and they they they bred all these different kind of hunting dogs and protection dogs and attack dogs and they they did the same thing in the horses and they did the same thing in cattle yes but they didn't understand what that what that DNA really was and how that it you know and they actually were able to now draw a picture like a ladder that's a twisted ladder and then on that ladder there's different markers and indicators and and there's certain genes that you have that are exactly the same genes as uh uh uh Botanicals we have certain certain genetics that are with within the animal kingdom that are cross that are in all eyeses but then there are certain genes that are specific to human beings yes and then they can't be crossed with anything else and so uh because and so they can take uh H HH stem cells from embryos and things like that and they can and they can take those stem cells and they can inject them into a healthy human being and those Ste those cells and this is on tape brother BR tells us about this he says and how that those cells actually from another human being or another embryo uh that they can actually uh find their way and kidney cells will go to your kidneys right eye cells will go to your eyes and so on and so on and so on and then they but he said there's an intelligence that guides it there right there's medications that you can put into your body and that medication somehow or another Finds Its way to the place that needs needs the medication amen by by you can have an infection in your foot and they can give you a shot in your arm and that antibiotic or whatever it might be will find its way to that infection yes sir yes sir and it won't affect any other part of your body on the way there it'll just find its way go to the bad spot and attack it right amen it's an amazing creature yes and so I was doing uh you know how this is a day of knowledge yes sir and if you want to know who the eighth president was anybody know who the eighth president was nobody knows who the eighth president was but we can all find it just a couple of seconds that's right we just call Uncle Google Bingo we got it and so it was one of those situations I was driving along and seeing some white cows out on the side of the road and well I was raised in cattle country and so typically that would have been a a charlet cow and that's the breed of the of the cow would be a charlet but these particular cows they didn't look just exactly like Charlie they were white but that was something different about them and I said I don't know I'm not sure so my son asked me well is there what other white cows are there I said we better call Uncle Google and so I I so we forgot about we was on our way to church and so after church I come back I see that same bunch of cows I said what cows are I can see them from my house standing out on the hill there good ways down there but in New Mexico there's no trees and I can see see about 50 60 miles in One Direction Just way off out there in distance and then cows is probably six seven miles away I can still see him sit on the hill and so I was I said I want to see what them cows are that's so I got on the internet and I and I found out there's several different breeds of white cows there's actually uh you know there's uh these what they call I think a British white and then there's a an American white and so I said wellow I wonder but these C they didn't look like either one of them and so I said well they're just probably you know I don't know they're probably charlet and I just didn't ain't seen a charlet in a long time or something but anyways I'm looking on there and then all of a sudden there was this little note down there a little link you know how it is on the computer it said the the uich U's cows were the original cows that all domestic cows come from that's and then there was was another link down there that there said that these cows were extinct but that they were going to back breed them and bring them back from Extinction W I thought imagine that I said they're actually going to bring something that's extinct there ain't no more and then I read there this article I just I just read it to you it says many extinct species might now be reclassified as bodily but not genetically extinct come on now boy there's in believers they done crossed over but they're not gone right right amen they're still here amen said God takes his man yes sir but he leaves his spirit amen so what was it it was that life that was in it that same Jesus that same spirit that rais Jesus from the dead if it dwells in you it will Quicken your mortal body amen so it'll bring it this mortality will come subject to the word amen so what it we cannot truly worship like the Pentecostal Church did at the Ephesus age unless we receive the same baptism that they received there amen if we receive the same baptism they received there we will act the same way they acted there amen but the prophet of God said that that message of Pentecost won't work for this day right so you're saying but what message will work you see they were under Joel's prophecy that I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh we were under Joel's prophecy that I will restore all the years that the Palmer W and so now but we're still under the inspiration of the word and because we're under the inspiration of the word he gave us the corn and the oil and the wine just like he did to them in their day they recognize their day and its message and they worship God and when we recognize our day in message we will worship the same way they worship yes amen hallelujah oh my it'll get the same results the same emotions the same signs and wonders if it does not it is a seed of dis yes sir that's right brother amen that's good that's true he said they're bodily but not genetically extinct they're dead but their DNA is recoverable yes yes amen from Museum specimens and fossils and thanks oh I love it when they say thanks thanks to new developments in genetic technology that DNA may eventually bring animals back to life amen remember what he said what you see in the scientific Community wow is what God praise God Amen they're walking all around res talking we're just gonna keep reading here oh my I feel I feel like oh man I believe in a sensational God let me tell yes sir he said but why bring back Bish creatures to life it'll be expensive oh let me tell you this cost yeah God everything yeah yes bankrupt heaven for thisen amen oh my oh my this pull pit ain't just near be enough this rope is just too short all right yes sir my language just ain't enough I'm telling thank you Lord it will take decades oh God and it won't always succeed so why even try right their Resurrection might not work yeah oh what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is I'm under the spell of Resurrection I'm under the Revelation that joob was under that Paul was under the polycarp was under the way was under the destroy My Flesh I shall see God Amen Glory Hallelujah he said this y was a massive creature stood more than six feet tall the shoulder that's a big old cow yeah he said and weighing more than a ton man talk about a cash crop man I like her of them buggers man you could make some money on that he said it had forward- facing horns a white stripe running down its spine and the uro were denominated I mean domesticated but some some URS also remained in the wild until the Middle Ages about that but there was these original Pentecostal ugs right and they remained AED they remained there was a certain Mark about them yeah oh I could I have get all Little Children Here we just changed the message yeah I preach to you little fellas about the little donkey and I can't maybe another time maybe tonight amen amen you have to bring all the children yes sir send send your children that's right right amen he said uh he said now now what they were uh they all got denominated and they remained in the wild until they couldn't be denominated some of that couldn't be denominated and remained in the wild until the Middle Ages when scientists believe they became extinct due to martyrdom and persecution over honey and the loss of habitat beautiful amen they closed the door yeah they did wow and it darkened the age he said but he said you take the Liv said but don't touch the old leave that all in line praise God Amen he said now what he said when scientist uh he said they believe they became extinct all right now I'm reading for this is Time Magazine February 2010 where I'm reading this from I did not make this up I did not put any words in here except for a few but I'm reading their words and I love it when science declares the glory of God he said the hope of its Resurrection yeah wow now lays in the tame descendants right the domesticated C brother Bram said we're all hybridized that's right in this to see age we've all become hybridized but the hope of the Resurrection is lay and a few selected thank you that have the characteristics amen of the original glory to God oh my beautiful he goes here's how the process is expected to work yes sir they're expecting this to [Music] work they said first the scientists will secure old Ur Pentecostal Ur Bowers right empty and fragments from M museums in order to glean oh my you see Ruth gleaning yes yes what they're doing they're gleaning they're bringing that word what is the Propet of this day he was a scientist a researcher a holy researcher from God he went out and began to get the loose out of the Methodist movement out of the Lutheran movement out of the calvinist movement out of the uh Armenian movement they begin to bring all the Lo and place of all and what they called a genetic Mosaic who putting all the pieces together tying all the loose hands not bringing new information but just bringing the information and putting it in his proper perspective oh because it was going to do something Glory sir in able to recreate its DNA right wow you got recreate this using they were going to with their ability to tie oh my you see got a whole message on this but they they they were able to go back with a computer age they were able to record and store the genetic information of all human genetic characteristics in this little room here we have uh uh Asian folk we have Caucasian folk right we have colored races we have uh uh just every Avenue of we we some of us probably got American Indian Spanish yes all these different races right right each one of those human characteristics are in our genetic code right us white folks have black jeans in us right yes just there but they're they're recessive they don't manifest right but and the same with black races have white genes in he said well but we've been in Africa for you know since the dawn time no we all have human genes that's why we all have human blood why we can all share body parts and blood and all these different things we can go to one another right but but there's parts of that that are recessive and so the scientists went back back and with the computer age they were able to uh uh uh uh record or list and they started a list called the human genome and the human genome was a record of all human genetic characteristics and they begin to record it they didn't figure that they would get this for years they figured it would take them centuries or at least decades but with the the advancement of the computer age and computer technology where at one time it took a computer that would fill this room to hold you know just a a a a you know 500 gigabytes we carry hard drives Yeah in our pocket this big that'll hold a terabyte right right you know the advancement of technology is is just rapidly increased until finally they thought it would be somewhere 2015 our time now 2016 before they would find the whole list of human genome but because of the advancement of Technology they completed the human genome they know every human genetic characteristic and there's millions of them maybe more wow and they completed it in 2000 in 20 they known for 16 years all human genetic characteristics and they put that in a genome that they called The Book of Life they called it that and so now if all human genes that are recorded in the Book of Life are known then what about the latin's book amen yes he's calling all those human te amen he's putting them in their place H glory and so what are they doing they're they're taking this H this this animal DNA to recreate this original Arc cow amen because they believe that they can actually resurrect a extinct species right amen Wonder so the researchers these researchers this is how it's expected to work these researchers will glean enough genetic material what do we have we had a prophet in this last day that has been glean he gleaned for his entire ministry right all the mysteries of God would be finished right he would glean all the material yeah and he would unveil what was in those seals which he said was names of the Lamb's Book of Life yes sir which were the characteristics the genes The Prodigy of the father identified who you were right amen called us from every land every Kindred Nation tongue and people right brought us together under the great bride body to resurrect us amen out of History Oh Glory to God Amen to resurrect us out of History to Place us amen off of the endangered species list amen humanity is on the endangered species they're the only ones in danger right right I'm not in danger oh gu where is your Victory oh great where great where's your Victory is your S I can't die I can no more die than God can die why because his seed remain his Gene Beau his genetics his DNA mine di mine's gone it's buried Amen in the sea amen of God's forgivness to be never remember no more sir D Smith is extinct yes sir and glad of Amen his old his old dead his old body tries to we had an old dog one time we had to kill and uh so we buried him out under a pile of rocks few years later we driving back here his old leg was coming out the pile of rocks I said look at luk he's trying to resurrect that's my old Dale every now and then I see see his little foot trying to come up out there kind to rise up give me all kind of trouble oh my just gotta kill him drive him back down throw some more rocks on him amen that dead thing down there prise God bless the name of the Lord don't you love him amen he said but when the researchers amen we then compare I like this this is this is important because now we're coming down to the testing time right the Judgment time which must begin at the house of the Lord he said the research will then compare the DNA of the modern Pentecostal cow to determine which breeds still carry these denominated cows you see he's denominated Pentecostal cows he's going to compare them to determine which ones carry the creature or the Creator the Creator's genes beautiful the creatures genes you see and then create a selective breeding program to reverse thousands of years of evolution we St say I'll find these je they're out here in these denominations and this one here has it and that but you said but I was a drunken dopac wher I was a evil Wicked person and but how did he choose such a thing as me right he wasn't looking at me right amen he was looking at the Jean God he was looking at something that was recessive it was down on the inside I could see he couldn't see it nobody could see it oh a researcher yeah he look at the blood Hallelujah when you look at the blood when you look at the Jean seed when you look at this book of predestination yes forign knowledge that's what Joseph could say what part of the forign knowledge am I manifesting right now yes because I know I'm in it right I know I was a part of it the found of the world yes Wonder this Jes he's going to create a selective breeding program yeah you thought you were here by a chance right God selectively read [Music] amen that legal yes sir is that okay oh yeah amen he pulled someone from this tribe right some from this tribe and brought them together from that tribe that tribe that group brought together down for 10 generations to get you here right that's right here that's right amen it kind of come down through and down through and you know everything was looking good for a while amen and then all of a sudden he had to let he had to let this man run over here and sleep with this other man's wife she got pregnant by had my great great grandpa yeah you think you made it oh you're perfect in all your Generations you can't track yourself back in no time you'll be some messed up thing right brother right amen oh and it went good for a little while down through here down through here and then all of a sudden this little teenage girl Runs Out amen she goes to college ain't no place for a woman I'll guarantee you right now she run off to college and she gets out there got out of her place got out of the kitchen got out there got to running around nightclubs down in the free love movement bunch of hippies got together got pregnant unmarried give that little baby away gave it over to her sister her sister rais to raise that little boy in honky tones amen beer joints amen laying around just open filth all the time yes sir yes sir selective right reading yes God didn't know about that God knew about it from the foundation of the world Amen he knew what it was going to take Amen to pick a preacher one day yes Hallelujah he knew what it was going to take to put little boy on the earth he could have been raised in all the fineries of Jewish hospitalities and fineries and money and Fine Wines and elegance I could have been raised in that that's right oh but my first brother didn't want me she gave me to her sister and her sister was a little broken illiterate waitress at a truck stop Liv around with several men never could have children my she gave me over to that little that little woman and Raised Me In A Honky Tong thank my earliest remembrances was rolling pool balls in a Hony talk on a pool table watching my mother fall up a bar St amen so drunk she couldn't walk we had to sleep in the car in front of the bear joint till we could get home oh let me tell you friends Heen God selectively BR me from the found the world I'm fearfully and wonderfully made the of God he raised me up out of the ashes I was extincted there was no hope for me I was rele like in life oh but God Raised Me Up the original progam of the original Church Glory Hallelujah Oh Glory to his name thank you Jes to reverse 2 years amen yes Glory 5,000 if you want to be Tech 6,000 yes sir human failure right yes he was going to reverse it and bring me back to the original worship and the original evened Glory my amen I I got to find a place to jump out here amen thank you Jesus thank you Lord thank you Lord watch this in the early 20th century why wouldn't the 18th century right but in the 20th century yes the Nazi government funded an attempt to breed them back is part of a propaganda a million more 44 they were trying to breed them back they were trying to burn them into the church yes yes the denomination are trying to add to their numbers because they needed a generational herd to reproduce and needed at least a hundred of these animals that had this perfect genetics in order to uh produce this herd right and it was to V indicate what Nazi Germany was trying to do with the Aryan Nation right he knew if it could do with cows he could do with humans right yes yes but it was a skewed mentality yes sir and the uh he says uh these were called heck cattle which may to some extent resemble I love these words the ancient U but but goat Doctrine M but bu something right but he said they're genetically quite different they had all the form right right see so they look like a Europe cow yeah they had all their human characteristics but they couldn't produce it genetically right for another generation it couldn't it couldn't reproduce itself right oh my now watch we want a breed that will resemble the eurox the original not only in phenotype but in genotype yes phenotype means comes from the French word finel the Greek word feno which means shining that's exactly what brother said right right the Pentecostal Church it shines it Glitters he said but the gospel oh they had the phenotype right but another genotype and a form of godliness right but they denied the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they denied the Oneness of God they denied the seventh Church age messenger they denied everything that the word declared them and therefore they were only able to act it out and show it in a form in the and their forms of godliness or Holiness standards and all these other things but yet the life inside of them it wasn't genetically which is genos or genotype which means Offspring right amen amen they were the daughters of the wh right right brother right but they weren't amen the sons of God Amen yes they were the daughters of a strange God right but they weren't amen of God Amen oh praise His name I'm going to close he said the only way that we can make the recombinations oh my my my is by having the animals produce a new generation right amen the only way brother R said if that tree that original tree amen if it ever puts forth another Branch amen not the grafted on stuff oh it looked like but it looked like it would produce but it always would produce the same Citrus but if that one tree that root ever put forth a new generation right it would be back to the original or yes amen hallelujah oh that's what's going to happen there's got to come there's rising up a new generation another church that will be exactly like the first church why because God has been selectively amen breeding and joining and and grafting and bringing us from this group and that group and putting us into the
