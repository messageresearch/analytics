that we know it's perfect peace praise God let's think about us tonight now the grace of Lord we like to just read a couple scriptures here let me turn this on I like to just read a familiar text the met the next main thought in Christ is the mystery brother Ram deals with his revelation so let's just go back to Matthew 16 a very familiar scripture on Revelation and that's where I want to end up I want to end this message with some thoughts on Revelation I appreciate the feedback from this morning I'm glad people were blessed by the Word of God it just you know just as I've been studying Christ as the mystery just it's meant more to me I've understood predestination election and foreknowledge better and like I said why why do we need to know better so it will encourage us to make the right choice because we know our choices have eternal consequences or rewards and we want the rewards praise God we don't want consequences and well we failed here we failed there we want rewards not to be selfish but to glorify Christ remember no matter what crown you get what are you gonna do with it what we're gonna throw down at his feet and then arm again he comes back and he's crowned with many crowns so any crown I get I already know it's going back to Jesus I don't want to keep her brother Bank I don't give my crown to Christ it's what good have I done nothing jesus said apart from me you can do nothing so so Christ gets all the glory praise God so let's look to the Word of God here Matthew 16 and I just want to read that I believe it 16 18 sorry I'm not there yet and I did post this on Facebook I've been trying to do one Facebook post a day the last three days I've been trying to get up early and do that and just try to get people to hear the word of God and hopefully catch some soul out there we're 17 and 18 Matthew 16 17 and 18 of course we were familiar with this brother man made some powerful statements in Christ the mystery and I want to get to those tonight by the end of the message verse 17 and jesus answered and said to him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and that's the point brother man's making Jesus did not give the revelation to Peter that's when brother Graham says when Jesus has flesh and blood but RAM said Jesus is saying I didn't give it to you my own human life my own human ability did not give you the revelation of Who I am it came from the Father that's quite a statement verse 18 and I say also unto thee thou that thou art Peter and upon this rock the revelation of who he was and is I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it Amen let's take that before the Lord how many thankful for this revelation let's pray that the gates of hell if there is coming against you now that they'll be cast down by the revelation that God has given to you Heavenly Father Lord we know Lord you promised to be with us you said you never leave us or forsake us and you said when the enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit of God will raise up a standard against him and all we're grateful for that and we know that standard Lord is the Holy Spirit's anointing Lord God through the revelation of who you are in other words because you've revealed to us who you are Lord in the midst of the trial you anoint us to break every yoke Lord you'll anoint us to overcome for that's why we have the anointing Lord God is to be like you dear God to overcome the enemy for Lord Satan savourest not the things of God but Lord we do we savour we love the things of God speak to us and our Lord God again in your divine presence Heavenly Father were fully trusting in you we want more of you Lord God Laodicea they say we have need of nothing but lower we come here as as as soldiers tired soldiers or wounded or weary war war experienced soldiers throughout the week and we say Lord we need more strength today encourage our strengthen us on this day of rest I mean we might be encouraged and edified and prepared for the battles ahead in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless you - bein seated praise God so this message of course you know Christ a mystery God revealed his meaning more to me all the time I hope I hope to you as well I want to focus on the revelation tonight but before we get there let me I want to just preach an hour by God's grace I preach the hour and a half this morning it felt like that but I want to just try to be at an hour tonight by God's grace and then we'll of course you know go our ways and so forth Lord willin I want to start with this thought brother Graham after he preaches on the thoughts from this morning like predestination we looked at he starts looking at Adam and Eve typing Christ and the church and he says this he says when Eve went away from the word she went away from her mate and when the church goes away from the word to a denomination she rejects and commits fornication with the world of man's wisdom rejecting the authority of God's Word and the Bible said committing spiritual fornications so any word in the Bible that's rejected or is any self interpretation put to it it's absolutely rejecting and committing adultery against the God that is your husband now that's a mouthful so that's what that's what denominations do sister Tonya they write up they write up as you know it probably sister Tonya they write up their beliefs and then they put a period and they say that's all God can do and that and that's what makes that denomination different from another denomination but the real church doesn't have a Creed book the Bible is their Creed book now we have a statement of faith on our website but I wrote it in a made sure that it says you know anything else reveal we're gonna believe that because we don't have a Creed we have life because the word is life the word is spirit and the word is life so when a denomination puts a period what they've done is they've limited what God can do they say this is all that God can do God can do nothing else but we're supposed to be a people of faith that said God will do all that's in this word and he can even do more outside this word but we know and we're safe because we know he's going to do things according to us we heard he could do things outside his word but we're just comfortable with what do you know what he's gonna do in the Word of God we know he'll always do something that lines up with the word so we don't want to be an adulterous Church we don't want to add to the Word of God or take away from the Word of God and that's what denominations do so that's what brother Barron likens Eve unto Eve of course believe Satan's lie and what did Satan do Satan took away from the word and said oh the word doesn't mean that it's okay you can eat of the tree of knowledge good evil it's not gonna hurt your walk with God because you'll be like God you'll be more spiritual actually if you break God's Word a little bit and compromise you're actually more spiritual you be more like God that's nonsense and look at the effects and all the effects we have today is sin death destruction pain suffering all because she believes Satan's lie and took the consequences away from God's Word now remember program said don't get down on the Adam and Eve he said you would have done the same thing I would have the same thing if we're in the Garden of Eden because we're human and God wanted Express in order God wanted to be a savior so in order for God to be a savior somebody had to be saved somebody had to be lost aren't you glad you're lost but now you're found amen I didn't like me lost like that sheep we saw this morning but thank God he found me amen and he found me in the nick of time praise God now Birmingham says this you see nice and now you see God's threefold purpose to express himself the world's lost now he has to express himself in a man to become a savior through the reconciliation of blood from the cross now he had to become that to die in to save and bring himself back into the church to have preeminence in his church amen hallelujah now remember it cannot will not and never will never has been a denomination he has to have the preeminence and he is the word and how can any be any Creed be injected in there it turns the church into a prostitute to take any man's word or any Creed or any denomination it can be quickly as marked in revelation 17 as a and harlots is that right now think about this I've been studying and I've been writing another book now my waiting the the the the one who's supposed to work on my book now her dad's passing away so it's getting my books getting delayed even further but that's okay cuz God is teaching me patience I've got 42,000 words I'm just waiting for her to fit you know get everything lined up but in the mid afternoon the twelve New Testament mysteries well in the fourth parable Jesus tells us in Matthew 13 he talks about a woman who hid leaven in three measures of barley measures of wheat right and bro Graham said that that is the the root that's the the Father Son Holy Ghost live the Trinity and notice when she when did she hide in there she hided that in there at the beginning before the bread was baked right she had to hide it in there before and that's what this Roman Catholic Church has done back there the word Trinity was turned in 180 oh yeah 180 ad let me know that so John John the Revelator was on the Isle of Patmos in 80 90 so 90 years later that Trinity doctrine was hatched and so see that that that leaven was hid by the woman which woman hid leaven in the meal the Roman Catholic Church and look today how all of her doctrine is leavened over and looked today at all the abuse claims on the Roman Catholic Church one thousand children that were reported in Pennsylvania were abused by Roman the priests in Pennsylvania alone 1,000 and there was abortions and deaths and suicides and all these kind of things that come about from this in church that's that that's the mother church and Christ does not have preeminence in that church in that denomination because they've said this is all that we have and then they add to the word they take the word away but see brother have said anything that joins itself with a Creed outside the Bible is a on the side of God and we've got to make sure we don't limit God either we've got to make sure we don't add to the word of God because it's easy to do pressure with brother Branham people can add all kinds of things like oh he's gonna resurrect and come back and he's gonna have to fly around the world you know I don't know plane or something like that or though we need to oh they'll say the name of God is William Branham or something some evil sins like that and we got to make sure we don't add even one word or take one word away I emailed those brothers back at voice of God this week and they said well Jesse we watched a little bit of your sermons we liked how you said you don't want to argue about it and they said and they said well we don't want to talk about every word brother Branham said thus saith the Lord because we don't want to argue and so I wrote back I said well brothers I don't want to argue either I said I just want to point out the fact that brother Branham said to make him infallible his tommyrot and it's awful and I said that's I said I just want to keep you from idolatry I can show you the email because look how easy it is you know we think all we got the message we're baptized in Jesus Christ's name well that's more because you got the truth that's more reason Satan wants to target us because we've got the truth brother Ram said all of Hell is against this revelation why do we have so many struggles right if so many people get battling and struggling because all of Hell is against the name of Jesus Christ oh but we don't but what we do is we don't add to the word we don't take from the word we run into the name of Lord it's our strong tower amen when there's a struggle when there's a dispute or there's a doctrinal problem we don't run away from the word we run to the word oh yes so of course that's what we're supposed to see around the message we're gonna see a lot of fanatics we're going to see a lot of people carrying around and things like that like I was talking with a pastor last night there's churches I've been to they let women they let women pray for the pray for the prayer requests they'll just call our women to pray for the prayer requests and that's giving a woman a place of authority that woman has the we'd say that woman has the floor oh my and there's other churches you know that that let women be deacons and sir in the message that serve Communion and see what are they doing they're making little compromises and then you watch and and I've start with the pastor and we watch their lives and people that we've known people that have come to this church and call me their pastor I've done these things I'm gonna get to that by the end of this message Lord willing allow their they allow these things or believe these things and then you watch their live search and their spiritual instability they can't stick they can't be faithful and stable and serve God with stability because they get off on little things and and they they make doctrinal excuses and they they preach false doctrine and and because of that they can't be stable and faithful and solid the Bible says when there's a false doctrine you're tossed like a wave to and fro back and forth in and out that's what they are in and out of churches in and out back and forth all over the place but you when you find out real solid Christian they're like a solid rock the Bible said they're like a pillar in the house of God amen hallelujah but who else do we think Satan's gonna attack he's going to attack this message but thank God God will raise up a standard against him haha hallelujah thank God that we have the revelation of Jesus Christ for the gates of hell can't prevail against this revelation and what is revelation again it's the will of God revelation is the faith in the will of God that's what it is revelation the will of God amen now I just want to say that that we are the programs preaching about denominations but we've got to make sure the word has preeminence and that we don't become a denomination and I'll get to some things at the end too now brother having said he fusions one which we read this morning Ephesians one about chosen and predestination proves the threefold manifestation of Jesus Christ remember what was the threefold manifestation for God to reveal himself and have preeminence in Jesus Christ second was for Jesus to have preeminence in the church by the Holy Ghost and the third full purpose of God was to take that Holy Ghost filled bride and take her back to Eden the future home the New Jerusalem hallelujah amen that's the three-fold purpose of God and brother have said so see were predestinated to the adoption in a Hobbesian chapter 1 now brother have says see what he's doing Jesus is restoring the fallen Eve so Eve fell in the beginning but God is bringing back a woman at the end because Eve a woman fell at the beginning God's bringing back the woman at the end which he calls the second Eve and that's who you are amen you're not the first thing you're not falling in to sin but you know it disgracefully but God is raising you up out of sin amen you're not falling to send in an organization and following the light and taking away from the scripture what you're actually doing is being raised up on the miry clay and being seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus where the second Eve he says now look what he says here notice as God opened up the side of Adam and took out Eve by his own flesh and blood and divided his spirit from masculine and feminine to feminine and put it in Eve he took the rib from under his side and made eat our Eve out of it huh me know that God put Adam to sleep and he opened him up and pulled out a rib and he not only the rib but he pulled out the spirit as the feminist spirit that was in him and then he took that ribbon that spirit and he formed a body of a woman and now Adam had a wife Eve out from his very being praise God his wife came out of him amen and brother may have said God did the same thing he said are in Christ when the blood and the water came out and he said Jesus Christ is the word and taking the word of making up his church Eve's he back to himself again redeemed by the blood that was come from his own body so I want to read this here the type was Adam was opened up to bring forth the bride and brother man said Jesus was pierced and opened up to bring forth the blood that would bring forth his bride amen huh thank you Lord you got yet just as Adam had to be opened up God had to open up Christ so his blood would come down and be poured out and that blood shed member without remission of sin I'm sorry without shedding of blood there's no remission of sin so Jesus by being opened up and pierced by that Roman soldier it let out the blood that redeemed us and brought us forth amen hallelujah that's a beautiful type there so butter him so said so see see the prefigure he opened up Adams side and took a part of his flesh to make Eve the bride now has to be the word for he is the word she cannot stand on Crete she cannot stand on denomination she kept not staying on good behavior she has to stand alone on the word because she's a part of it she was taken from Christ hey man now where were we taken from Christ from his mind remember that now some people make it sound like when Jesus was pierced we were that water in the blood now I can't see that by scripture my personally myself I can't see that because all that blood eventually dried up on the ground and then too make that you'd have to make that blood you know somehow get dirt and then all of our bodies come with a dead I don't see how that works myself what I see is that he's Pierce and that blood brought us forth because that blood allowed us to be forgiven by the Holy Spirit and then we can come forth by the baptism of the Holy Spirit and we can be sons and daughters unto God that's the way I can see it by the word of god so church we are standing on the word because we were taken out of the mind of Christ like we saw this morning we went from thought to flesh then theophany and then glorified body right now we're in the flesh we're in the second stage of manifestation hallelujah some of our friends that have passed on James browning in different ones they're in that third stage already in the theophany amen oh mercy thank you Jesus now I want to move on this down brother Branham said each Old Testament prophet expressed part of the word but Christ was the fullness of the word so program starts with Moses and then he goes to Joseph and David and he shows how all their types in their life were prefiguring Jesus Christ he said but all men typed out Christ but God was holding back the great revelation until the last days amen so I want to now move on to this thought now program cuts into the New Testament age and he said now the mystery is his coming so God brought forth Christ and that was the first fold of the mystery and now the rapture of course is the second fold of the mystery as well and he said he hid all these mysteries and saved them for the last days and now brother Branham says you know he speaks of his ministry in Revelation 10 7 with the cloud and I remember I preached that message and that was the message that took one person out of our church that was though that was the the one message that drove them away was when I preached clothed with the cloud and you know my wife and I were talking you know we were like well I wonder why I was led to preach that and then now I see why God was bringing forth the truth to drive out any unbelief like I said this morning it's hard when you're the reason people leave it's hard to deal with that but I can rest because I know I appreciate with a sincere heart and I preach what the Word of God says amen because we know the cloud has come in this hour we know that by God's grace but brother MCs he's saying how the Ministry of Revelation 10 1 to 7 has been revealing in this day this second full purpose because remember the mysteries of God must be finished how many understand that the mystery of God must be finished and bowed and said through the cloud God was showing he was going to bring together his body to reveal and tied together the loose ends and finish the mystery so brother have said Luther preached justification he just pounded justification he just pounded it week after week year after year you're justified by the blood you're justified by faith but that wasn't the end of it and then Wesley come and preach save the case you guys live a sanctified life you got in Rome and said he pounded that in and then the Xu's just rebounded there are gifts of the Holy Spirit we have faith for gifts to the Holy Spirit he said but the revelations had 1 to 7 is to reveal everything what it's all about and what was all this about what was justification sanctification restoration gifts Church what was it all about it was about finishing the mystery of God so that the bride will be complete she'll be finished should have the full life of Christ and Christ can rapture her off the earth hey man like I heard a brother dramatized he said can you imagine you were Martin Luther was your pastor and you say well I need to get some I need to get some counseling from Martin Luther you go over to his house you walk into Martin come on in you walk into his office how you ambassador and he's smoking a cigar and he's got a cement big beer can there because he drank beer right while he had justification something was still lacking he had he had a supernatural power to write letters and fight against the Roman Catholic Church II to protest the Roman Catholic Church in the Pope he had power do that but God couldn't rapture the church at that point because she wasn't sanctified amen hallelujah that's why God had a new justification st. vacation and John Wesley there was some some truth where he had some really close intimate friends that were women other than his wife and there was rumors you know for some reason now I don't think he did anything in it any any infidelity or anything like that but there was just whispers around and his wife even wrote about it about how he would maybe got too close to some women and so there was concerns there and then the sujin street was good the gifts was good but then a few years later they had denominated and said everybody's got to speak in tongues now not the true believers but so see God couldn't rapture that God one of the people who lived all over that were justified sanctified believed in the power of God and now know God and the mysteries of God are finished and they're conformed to the image of Christ they're just like that original church amen hallelujah that twenty years remember Church there was twenty years from the time the Holy Ghost fell in a t-33 to the Ephesians Age beginning in AD 53 how many remember that the church ages didn't begin to eighty fifty three so what was that twenty year period that was a church without spot wrinkle or blemish praise God there's a 20-year period in there because remember the ephesian church age it started in 1853 and pretty soon they have left their first love how many understand what I'm talking about that's why we got to make sure we keep our first love to Jesus all the time and that proved it there twenty year period from 33 to 53 it was the church was on fire and for the Amen they didn't have any Bibles did you know that they didn't have a New Testament during that time so what they leaned upon they leaned upon the Old Testament and the unction of the Holy Spirit just in their relate their prayer car you know that's what they lead upon and here we've got a Bible at church age milk we got all these message books all these things like that we're saying god help us because it's a darker hour but he's able to help us we just got to cry out to him amen so see he couldn't rapture a Luther Wesley or Azusa he had to get all this together and brother man who said it he says that Ezekiel dry bones there was four steps to that right getting the bones together and then I can forget the second one then this your sinews then the skin and on the four step life came in and that's what we have today the Holy Spirit gives us the full life if you come to my office you're not going to see cigarette butts in there you're not going to see beer cans in there you're gonna see a life I try to live honestly in godly and holy before Jesus Christ amen praise God does everybody understand that program said then comes the revelation after Sousa Street then comes the revelation to reveal what it's all about he said then he comes back in the last days and picks up all the mysteries and clearly explains it oh I'm so glad we clearly understand predestination I like this morning reveal it it's all the last days when this great mystery that God had in his heart is being revealed so this is God's heart brother beg God's heart is this message being revealed to me being revealed to you it's God's heart this is what he wants the church to be a church that believes the word and the word only program said remember he said do you get it if you fail come back to this tape again I don't know how much longer I'll be with you remember this is the truth of thus saith the Lord it's the truth it's the scripture so revelation 10 7 is thus saith the Lord God has finished the mystery of God and here we are we're waiting to the Great Commission is fulfilled were prophesying again to Nations we're sending missionaries to send every nation to so they can hear the word of God it's thus saith the Lord and now here's I want to get to this talk and oh my god playing I got 36 minutes okay praise the Lord let's all take a deep breath brother man can you hit that fan there I'm kind of getting hot in here can you hit that forgive me I was really hot this morning McGriff says now in the Webster's dictionary reveal its look at revelation now is to make known especially in divine truth he said that's what revelation is he says revelation is Christ's way of making himself known to his church mmmm said now notice he made himself known to Peter when he said well who does man think I am and program says today all Jesus was a philosopher a social religion he's a good man we believe his teachings okay it's a subject to live by I think it all make us better if we did well that's a Santa Claus story oh well you know Jesus makes everybody better that's Santa Claus story he says it's not the expressions of some church we should express something it's a life that you don't live yourself but he comes in and lives by himself and you become a prisoner to any human intellectual being at all you're led by the Spirit amen he says you have the mind of Christ Christ expresses himself through you shows you that it's him and not you how many can honestly look at your lives and see when you obey the Word of God it's not you it's him now because you you used to fall into these things used to fall into temptation but now you do because it's Christ in you now his spirit leading you his spirit guiding you that's what program says you don't live the life by yourself it's God's anointing in you now program says this he talks about how very very small the true revelation are the number of people who receive the revelation is it's so small and we read that this morning it's the narrow path Jesus said few there be that find it now he says men in the millions of the days of Noah he asked eight to be saved eight eight actually received the revelation to going to Noah's Ark eight in the millions and program says are the millions of Jesus day he asked twelve to be his disciples twelve out of millions twelve the boat man said I will say there'll be eight save now don't don't get that all wrong I never said that he says but it'll be a small group I tell you that first rate as the gay and narrows the way and few there be that find it and let me just say this church I wrote this down at my notes I want to make sure I say everyone that wants to be in the rapture will be in the rapture there will not be one foolish virgin who will be on the earth and say boy I really wanted to be in the rapture no everyone who wants to be in the rapture will be in the rapture because the Bible said God will give you the desires of your heart amen there's no doubt there'll be a lot of people that say oh that would have been nice not enough to go through the tribulation and give my life and be hunted down or whatever's going to happen the Tribulation Period but everyone that listen everybody the days of Noah that wanted to be in the ark was in the ark right everybody that one to follow Jesus in his day was following Jesus everybody that wanted to do it and remember God before knew who would want to be there so God ordained that all those who want to be saved God planned and elected and chose and predestinated the events so that all that really wanted to be there would be there that's right church I hope you catch that if you really want if you and I are really wanting to be in a rapture more than anything else we'll get it because what we'll do is we'll do what Jesus set we'll lay aside everything that does easily beset us and we'll run the race with perseverance [Music] our cross daily and we'll follow those bloody footprints wherever it leads us we'll just keep following those because we'll gladly lay aside anything that stumbles us we'll lay it aside and we'll say God give me my heart's desire my heart's desires be born again to go to the meeting in the air and God said I'll give it to you I'll give you a heart's desire that's right mine because if you really wanted to it then you say on the day of judgment you say God we know there's no lying here because zero how's your spirits holy I wanted to be in the rapture more than anything and you wouldn't let me and what would God say he's well you're right I'm wrong God wouldn't say that to see everybody that once wanted to be a Noah's Ark would be in Noah's Ark everybody that wanted to be out of Sodom would be that's why when when mrs. lot to hurt she really wanted to be there so God smote her right there with salt because her heart was she was someone was trying to convince her to be in the wreck I just say like that just has a type so they were trying to convince her to escape Sodom and to convince her to go in the rapture but it wasn't her own desire amen it's got to be your desire amen it can't be my desire you can't live off of my desire to serve God you've got to have that desire or else you'll turn around and say mine I really miss those days in the world I don't miss none of that amen I don't miss anything I'm looking forward they have an amen like I said I finally feel like I am Who I am I finally feel like I can really express Who I am a Christian a Christ lover a word lover a believer someone who loves Jesus Christ with all their hearts amen praise the Lord now I hope that's helpful by the grace of Lord God will give you your heart's desire he promised - he said whatever you ask in my name I'll give it to you he said ask seek and knock and God will open right he'll open he'll he'll answer he'll do everything he said just ask seek and knock but the ramps another church the whole thing is the revelation of God to take Eve 2nd Eve back to her rightful position again with her husband notice God is the husband of the church in Christ I'm sorry in church is his bride now I want to read this now it's breaking the Peter and and Jesus here I want to read this here let me tell me let me uh skip onto that here now Peter had seen Jesus in flesh brother Ram said but he didn't know him by flesh cuz Jesus said so flesh and blood didn't reveal it to you now listen what brother Ram says he said even my own life didn't reveal it to you and this proves in bro Graham says it later there's no preacher that can give you the revelation of Jesus Christ there's no dad there's no mom there's no spouse husband or wife there's no district presbyter there's no message preacher there's no message missionary there's no one that can give you a revelation of who Christ is other than the Holy Spirit program said Peter even my own life didn't reveal it to you can you imagine that church Peter had seen him walk on the water and look like a ghost Peter had seen him raised up his own wife his wife's dying words that had that temperature their fever he lays his hands she rises right up even that couldn't reveal that Jesus was the Messiah because the lot of people saw miracles and that didn't reveal it it had to be given from heaven amen hallelujah all right you see that proves no and this is where I struggle little bit sometimes I tell my wife like how come people can't get the revelation like you know people that leave the church and things like that like what am I doing wrong and I've got to remember I cannot give it no matter I mean it's this don't get me wrong it's the sphere like this morning it's a spirit teaching on predestination but even though the spirit leads me to present it the person still has to receive it from God Amen they got to be in the same spirit that I got that gave it to me and then if they get into that spirit that spirit will reveal it to the end praise God so even Jesus his holy life he never he never cussed like Peter Wright he never did even his own life couldn't reveal this to Peter it had to be given by the father liber have said Peter did not know him by the flesh the man walked handled him and everything else so I want to make sure you see that now this is most encouraging here so hope you're encouraged revelation does not come by physically being with that's why we've seen people walk away from every church you name it at mystical Church we've seen people walk away the man knew brother Branham Donny Reagan we've seen people walk away from his church evening like Tabernacle we've seen people leave this church Samuel Browning's church you name it I've seen people brother Brooks's church people walked away paula Fontaine's people walk away from his church it doesn't matter who your fleshly pastor is because that pastor cannot give you revelation it has to come from God Almighty amen now this is to home now see I want to bring it down to home now look what brother have says next Paul I know he's comparing Peter and Paul he says Paul had something greater than any of the Apostles did program says in present stage of my ministry 1962 brother Ram said Paul's ministry was greater than all the Apostles combined and that scriptural because Paul says I labored more abundantly than you all but see Church look how humble he was with it he says but because I persecuted the church he said I consider myself to be the least of the Saints and that's how you know somebody's really humble even though their works Paul's works out shined all of them he left his he left his hometown he left everything he traveled on three missionary trips was almost sunk in the ships five times I think it was her three times beaten four times 39 stripes and all these things he suffered more than all of them he worked more than all of them but when it was brought down to it he said I'm the least because I used to persecute Christians although his works were the greatest he considered himself the least brother Brahim said Paul had something greater than any of the Apostles did but man said the Apostle said well I've got more left revelation than you paw because you know I walked with him I went fishing with him one day I heard him talk he sat me in a boat and actually told me let's go here and fish in a place and we get more fish and we did see we seen him do things now isn't that familiar people that went fishing or hunting with brother branham claimed to have more revelation than you and I now church we're not in the revelation battle like I don't need I've got more revelation than you I gotta warn you that's not what we're trying to do but we're looking at whose life is manifesting Jesus Christ chabela have said the Apostles could have said well we went fishing with him we have more revelation we actually walk with him physically but brother bran catches the revelation said because Paul knew him by the Holy Spirit the pillar of fire amen the Holy Spirit met with him in Arabia and taught him the Word of God amen for all those years personal revelation because he learned it from the Holy Spirit Jesus Christ because he learned it from there he had a greater revelation than all of them put together amen so it didn't matter if he went fishing with Jesus and church let me say it like this humbly today it doesn't matter that we didn't see brother Branham preach because we know the God of William Branham amen you know there's one brother I really appreciate from Albion what's his name that 90 year old brother and the first time I appreciate I can't remember me he was in one of our arms meetings the first time I preached that he heard me preach at Albion he comes up crying after service and I'm like well praise the Lord you know and he said he shook my head he said brother Jesse I want to tell you something I said okay what what do you want to tell me and he said he said even though I saw brother Brandon preach even though I was in brother Anna's meetings he said you're greater than I am and I said no brother I said no he said he said you and your brother cam he said you guys are preaching the revelation the message he said in impurity it's so pure and he said you're better he said you're greater than I but I said no sir I said that's not right I said I said we're nobody and he said no I've got scripture to prove it because Jesus told Thomas and all the saints he said blessed are your eyes he said because you've seen he said Thomas blessed are your eyes because you've seen but greater is he who has believed and not seen Amen and I thought well I tried to downplay by Thayer I thought well that's right that's right now that was from his I didn't try to tell him to say that but he saw the message of the hour preached in his pure form and said you are greater because you believe the message without seeing the Prophet amen and that's in church that's the reality of what we have today we believe the message even though we haven't seen the Mahdi prophet of God and all of us gifts that we can hear it on tape we can watch it on the video but see what we need though is not to not to rest in that but it's the rest in the revelation the Holy Spirit is to say God reveal yourself to me become a reality to me amen and so that's why brother Ram can say this Paul was greater than all the eleven apostles and of course he was numbered with them we know later but man tells us that because of our have said here he is he manifests himself in the pillar of fire and he said he said now we have the same thing today the pillar fire expressing himself in vindicating himself revealing the mystery of God that's been hid since the foundation of the world he said Paul knew him by revelation and Peter noon by revelation so see it comes down to revelation it comes down to faith in the revealed will of God that's what it comes down to because you can sit in someone's under someone's ministry and that person in their own flesh they cannot give you a revelation they can preach it they can point to it they can pray for it it's until that heart opens up and receives the revelation because God wants to give it but the people have to receive it alright now let me close here I got fit what I got 15 minutes here yeah I got 19 minutes okay let me close I'm gonna try to bring it down I'm gonna close in 20 minutes okay I'm gonna try to bring it down because by God's grace now what I want to do is I want to just close with a few thoughts here I kind of want look at this Paul and Pete and Peter and the revelation here I want to remind our hearts of a few things let's take our Bibles let's read a few let's go to acts 22 here verse 4 now I mentioned this this morning church and I let me say it again tonight I'm gonna say it more clearly tonight we have to use our past failures as motivation to do more for the kingdom of God because that's what Paul did and pause the example right Paul says that in first Timothy chapter 1 he said God showed his grace and me he's a time the pattern God showed his grace in me first for all those that should follow so even in your Christian life you know what sister Naomi and I were talking about you know after service the grace of God but yet sometimes we still fail even in our failures this is what I need to do I need to look at my failures and use that as motivation to say although I failed there I'm not gonna fail again I'm gonna redeem the time that I'm gonna do better next time by the grace of God that's what Paul did look at John I'm sorry acts 24 for I'm sorry acts 22 for forgive me mercy now look he says and I persecuted this way into death binding and delivering into prisons both men and women look at that he persecuted them so much what do you mean you believe in Jesus the Messiah we're gonna kill you we're gonna put you in prison that was Paul Paul was persecuting unto death we want to kill you you deserve to die because you believe in Jesus and it wasn't just men Church it was your God the old mom or your golly old grandma can you imagine it and this is why God used him to do great things because he realized I'm nothing look what I used to be I used to consent unto your grandmas and grandpas being killed being put to death I used to think that was okay so Paul God never let Paul get exalted although he was used in such a tremendous way because Paul could never forget I used to persecute Christians go to acts 26 verse 11 you know I just typed in I persecuted and these these four scriptures came up Paul saying I persecuted he never forgot what he did he never forgot that past life and it served as motivation to keep him humble but also to do the will of God look he said verse 26 11 and I punished them off in every synagogue and compelled them to blaspheme and being exceedingly mad against them I persecuted them unto strange cities he would drive you sister Wendy from Brian to Toledo he would drive you out of Brian sister Naomi he would drive your family out of Akron to wherever Greene is that what the Bible said I did he would he would so bother them and get out of here you Christians he was just knocking on their doors and persecute them until they left and drive them to strange cities that's what this man did now Church before this we'd say oh I'm gonna be like Paul we'd all say yeah yeah let me be that great apostle who wrote two-thirds of the New Testament yeah no no we we don't we don't because this is what he did this is why God could use him this is why he was so surrendered to Christ because he was so disobedient to Christ at first imagine malachi lydia someone come into our door and just persecuting us until we have to move to Grandma's house he imagine that this is what he did and it wasn't once in awhile it was oft constant constant just the demon spirit driving him he just hated message believers he just hated it he just hated that and it drove him to persecute oh but look at the power of Revelation once it's five seconds - from the pillar of fire he was a changed man amen I didn't any huh all these years of persecuted all these months we'd say of persecuting Christians all the took was five seconds in the presence of the Holy Ghost and he said Lord what would you have me to do praise God it's hard for you to kick against those bricks what did it revelation of Jesus Christ praise God first Corinthians 15 9 Lydia Paul was used in the greatest way but in his mind he really believed he was the least of all the saints because of his past life for I am the least of the Apostles and that am NOT meet to be called an apostle because I persecuted the Church of God now he would write letters and say Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ but Church there was times he was so he felt so sorry for his past life he said I'm in a pot I'm right he has an apostle but I'm really not even worthy to be called one because he never forgot what he used to do he never forgot what his flesh used to do because he persecuted the Church of God that's why Cam's testimony because he persecuted us not with this but with arguments for a whole year and then the pillar of fire came to him God revealed to him that there's one name to the Father Son Holy Ghost the Lord Jesus Christ and now the gates of Hell cannot prevail against this revelation a mad glory Galatians 1:13 Galatians 1 13 for you have heard of my conversation times past in the Jews religion how that beyond measure I persecuted the Church of God and wasted it beyond measure so he was the most destructive force against Christianity and God took the most destructive force against Christianity and turned it around and put it on God's side and he started destroying the kingdoms of darkness it's just like David David killed Goliath Goliath own sword amen hallelujah that big force that God used to have God took that tool down that sword down and from putting David's hand and and killed Goliath with it and that's the same thing but Jesus that Jesus took Paul the one who's persecuting the church took him and slew Satan by their Amen hallelujah that's exactly right so see Church he persecuted the church now go back to 1st Corinthians 15:10 first gurney 18:10 I'll try to bring this down I got 11 minutes I just want to bring this thought out about the power of Revelation the gates of hell could not prevail against Paul after he got the revelation of who Jesus Christ was amen same thing for Peter of course he didn't have Holy Ghost but he almost fell away but it got God captain because he had a revelation of Jesus God kept him from backside and totally out into the world and he eventually repented three times you know Jesus then he got the Holy Ghost 10 days later he meant after Jesus left but by the grace of God I am what I am and His grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but I laboured more abundantly than they all yet not i but the grace of God which was given unto me now I preached on this last year at Thanksgiving I preached a thought called forsaken by man but not by God remember that I appreciate I think over in the other bill others so would have been what two years ago two years ago yeah 2016 and brother Branham in the sermon President stage of my ministry he showed how Paul was forsaken at the end of his ministry by Dimas I remember that Dimas forsook Paul because he loved the things of the world and brother BAM showed how Jesus was forsaken at the end of his ministry and brother BAM said Paul Jesus and brother Branham was forsaken than of his ministry he said Paul was misunderstood people accused him of being a wine-bibber he was telling Timothy Timothy to be a wine-bibber they misunderstood that then Paul himself was in prison and then Paul would not allow women preachers so demas forsook Paul the one who led him to the Lord because he only had one coat where's all the prosperity in this man's life but brother Jesus had no place to lay his head and then brother Aaron said Paul had a greater ministry than all the other apostles because money isn't God no matter how big your ministry it's not about money it's about the purity of the word in acts 19 a silversmith stopped what seemed to be a revival in Ephesus remember that and they had to take Paul out of the city and brother Branham said demas must have said something like this well Paul Paul made one man blind why didn't he make the silversmith blind how if Paul such a man of God why is he in prison and how come these Devils are stopping his revival and Ephesus and so Dimas said God must have taken his anointing from Paul but brother have said God is not an Indian giver Amen if God gave you a gift if God gave your ministry God will not take that away God's not an Indian giver the gifts and callings of God are without repentance that's exactly right Dimas said oh he's all washed up he's lost his lost his gift of smite people blind but brother ham said see Paul is and all men are just an agent of the will of God you only work as God leads you to work Jesus only did the works that God showed him and God's servants can only do the work that God calls them to do I wonder that too I'm sure sister Wendy and Naomi I'm sure we wondered how come I can go to other churches and cast out Devils and we don't see it here as much as we like to maybe maybe it's happened I can't remember I couldn't remember any but hot why is that or how come I look back and we had I remember John Graham and I used to count the the miracles you know we seem like a lot of miracles in 2010 11 12 13 but then it seemed like to be a dip or drop off what is it you enter in and out of seasons of God and you we are agents of God and we can only do the will of God let me say like this I would cast out more Devils that people really want to be free from the devils is that right we would baptize more people in Jesus Christ name if more people wanted to be baptized in Jesus Christ's name are you with me so it's seasons that we go through it's not what brother Jesse's lost his anointing or I've lost my anointing now you may have if you sin but I searched my life every day Church I know about you every morning I fasted Sunday morning as some pray I don't need anything I just drink water and coffee and pray and see God and try to preach God's Word I'm trying to say under the anointing of the Holy Ghost and I'm ready many times I'll announce it on a Sunday I'll say well I haven't I haven't eaten if you need to be prayed for I can pray for you because Jesus said these kind only go out by prayer and fasting so see we gotta use it and especially me and all of us we got to use the wisdom of God we can only work as God leads us to work brother have said see why is Paul they were they were criticizing Paul why is Paul warning Timothy of Alexander the coppersmith I thought Christians were feeling it fearless brother Graham said but at the end of his letter Paul's warning Timothy be careful with that cop Alexander the coppersmith well I thought Christians are fearless I thought Christian could just speak the word speak the word speak the word well apparently Church their seasons we do speak the word and their seasons we don't because you and I know this we cannot speak the word though if we try to speak the word it's not God's will nothing's gonna happen but when we speak the way is God's will something's going to happen hey hallelujah and we don't want to play Church and I gotta be I've always got to be careful that when people ask me to pray I got to search my heart and say Lord is this the anointing and you know and usually if I'm like like that it's probably not the anointing it's me trying to work myself up into it but I noticed when I've spoken the word like with Tom Atkins and these women they're babies when I've spoken like that it just came out I was just anointed and I just did it I didn't even think about it it was just a leadership of the Lord and that's what I like I like to be led of the Holy Spirit don't you acts 19 Lydia keep hold it up here verse 15 and 16 I got about five minutes the power of Revelation Paul never lost his revelation Church what God was God was making him be rejected at the end of his ministry for this sake I'm sorry I've said the wrong one that's not the right one it's acts 9 I'm sorry 9:15 my fault honey my fault acts 9:15 not 19 I'm sorry mercy in order for Paul to be like Christ the Lord sent him go that way he's a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before the Gentiles the king is Jordan Israel now that sounds good doesn't it Church but look at the next verse 16 for I will show him how great things he must suffer that's the part we don't like we want to see we want to see the miracles like Paul saw you wouldn't have somebody late you know a handkerchief and go lay it on while I'm preaching I'll wear a handkerchief I'll give it to you and see somebody heal we want to see that but we don't we don't often think about this the other side that comes with it there are times of glory and great anointing but in order to reign huh me know you have to suffer in order to reign to be like Christ you have to learn how to suffer as a Christian brother the scripture in Christ and Mister of God revealed God's that I've chosen him yeah and I'm going to show him what great things he'll suffer for my name's sake I'll send to the Gentiles and disgrace him in every way that he can be disgraced but yet he'll bear my name so long remember Church ha ha me know Paul had the greatest revelation of the New Testament he was caught up in the third heaven he said I saw things I'm not even allowed to utter he said because God showed me these great revelations he allowed a messenger to buff at me from Satan a thorn in my flesh he had the greatest revelation he worked harder than any other parcels but yet he suffered more than all the apostles so did you catch the understanding the more revelation you have the more suffering you have to balance that out because search we can't live on the mountaintop can we because then we get exalted we think we're better than everybody so God's got a humble us the more revelation we have the more suffering to keep us balanced in the Word of God so see we have a great revelation to today don't we this revelation goes beyond the CMA it goes beyond the Assemblies of God that I was right I've heard things of this message I never dreamed of right brother but to do that God in order to keep us humble he's got to raise the suffering a little bit too so we don't get exalted and yet in the midst of the suffering we never quit we never give up on God the gates of hell never overcome us hallelujah we never go back in the things of the world we don't go crawling back to our cigarettes and drugs and alcohol and sexual promiscuity and all these things like that we never go crawling back there we say faithful and loyal to God because we know God has called us to suffer for his name's sake let's stand to our feet here mat Lydia the livestream I want to say a few personal things here tonight
