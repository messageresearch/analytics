from heaven praise god he's good he's merciful his mercy and doeth forever amen amen hallelujah praise god so praise the lord [Laughter] his mercy is more stronger than darkness do every lord our sins

what patients would wait as we constantly vote what father so tender is calling us home he welcomes the weakest the vilest the poor our sins they are many his mercy is born [Music] [Laughter] his mercy is more it's all much more stronger than darkness my sins they are men in his mercies one rich is of kindness he lavished on us his blood was the pavement we stood by [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] amen i've absolutely been blessed uh with everything going on here amen uh the music is just phenomenal uh the lord is really blessing that and i'll tell you what lord if the lord does tarry a little bit these youngsters wow they're gonna be letting let something loose [Laughter] it's like we're hearing the choirs of heaven above and brother amen is just uh doing a phenomenal job there as well you know what i and i love what i about our brother is that you know it's he loves god and he loves to worship and that's obvious and god will anoint that god will inhabit that and i believe i'm watching that amen and uh so the lord's doing some wonderful things here uh we're glad uh that the lord has given us an opportunity to be a part of that amen um brother did you still want me to sing or not let's let's move on yeah let's move on because uh yeah you know how i am maybe you're until midnight we're we're like the apostle paul we wait till someone falls into the third row and we know it's time to go pray and go home bless the lord for his mercy to his his servant here let's open up our bibles we get to this i couldn't say more sure i love the hospitality i love the uh even the charity that's in the midst and uh i do know that god's gonna do some phenomenal things here and uh that's uh been evidence to me and uh yet uh i know for a fact that god is doing some amazing things our way i feel like i could tell you testimony after testimony just uh from last a few months of what god is doing and uh you know the lord just gave us grace and uh he sent another individual just happened to be in that area and and uh they were crying out for truth and and just felt like he told me he said he said the closest thing i could find was a oneness pentecost with the bible he said and then i just ran upon you guys website on the internet there and uh just happened to move right in town at the same time he said i'm i was looking for truth and this is where god told me to go so i've seen this now three times supernaturally vindicated we don't just go by like i said uh a sign isn't our proof but i'll tell you what you line up with the word uh you know you're on to something so i believe that uh we are not deceived and this word is perfect um so we'll move on with that tonight i'm gonna we're gonna try to do two things here if we can do i need to keep talking until you get that on there [Laughter] do you have a jump driver have i have something in my pocket i think somewhere in this pocket can you use this and then put a jump drive in there awesome i don't have a jump drive though so um i do spend quite a bit of time getting things on powerpoint i found that uh it makes it uh it makes it a little bit uh easier for me to go my own pace and i have everything up there so you can see it that uh you know we're just doing our best to uh to bring forth uh the full uh council of god that we can and uh that's what we're gonna continue to do amen um i ministered almost two years on the seven seals and tonight we're going to just bring a little aspect of that this evening if you have your bibles daniel 12 verse 1 i'm going to be once again running through the scriptures uh just laying in a little topic for you on trying to tie a few of those things in like i said this is a lot going on and that's been kind of my problem i come here and i preach these really long series and i like to get into the depths of every subject i can and uh i feel like that's uh what lord gives me and i just and i i like to jump in everything i hear i like to tie it in with the scriptures and uh people can interpret things the way they want and i feel the liberty to allow the holy ghost to uh to bring things to me likewise amen um i don't have any bitter spirits or feelings towards anybody no matter what they've done or where they've gone or or how it is um but this is uh this is a day and age where you know we're doing our best to make the rapture and i believe that this is going to produce it and i've seen plenty enough evidence to believe it so um we will continue on daniel 12 1. here it is quite a start here it says and at that time shall michael stand up the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered uh every one that shall be found written in the book all right and many of them should that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake and some to everlasting life some to shame and everlasting contempt and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever amen one more portion revelations 8 1 we're not going to fully deal with this unless the inspiration would lead me to go that way but just knowing that the end of all things is at hand uh we see that daniel 12 there it works with the great tribulation period moving in uh setting in and uh it looks like we are going to be that church that will rise above that in a rapture amen uh so we're looking for that we're believing that we're going to avoid those uh those trials that soon will come um if the blands are listening there on on live stream god bless you brother johnny i didn't get to say hi to you there i i thought you might be your second service and uh lord knows so god bless you uh sure love you in the lord as well as everyone else who wants to make it back amen that might be listening amen but it's good to see uh uh like i said everybody who's pressing the house of god tonight amen revelations 8 1 it says here it says and when he had opened the seventh seal uh there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour amen uh let's go ahead and bow our heads and we'll we'll say a word of prayer and we'll get we'll get rolling on this as quick as we can amen uh lord jesus here we come once again before you lord uh realizing that you are the author and the finisher of our faith and uh yet tonight uh once again coming lord thou know us so lord we we had uh a great time with you this morning and we're asking that you our great invited guest uh would be in the midst of your people god speak to them wholeheartedly and as i would desire lord and lord maybe we all get a side of ourselves and just let your holy spirit have preeminence in this place and uh surely oh god if there's a direction you'd like me to go please anoint me to do so and i will be quick to answer thee lord the best i can so uh in all this we know that we're all sinners saved by grace lord but we sure love you and appreciate you for all the mercy that you've given us so lord we just ask you to have your way now for the lord jesus christ's name we pray in the church says amen you may be seated okay a lot of scriptures to go through i'm going to try to paint a picture for you today through the scripture um perhaps maybe a little bit like this morning uh but i believe it will help you and uh it'll also show your expectation where it should be and i think a lot of times we're we're really expecting uh uh perhaps maybe even a life of ease going into these things uh but i want you to see where we're at of course you know we're living in the season uh of that seventh seal right and uh we're living right at the coming of the lord um which is it had to be a mystery right and uh when we began to go through and and look at the the seventh seal we've all done it uh when it really came to the opening of it it just brought us this one portion that uh when that seventh sealed was open there was silence in heaven for the space of a half hour that's really not a lot right and uh yet when we begin to look at it and look at what the prophet says we find that it really was only opened up to one fold he said in the seventh seal and that was up to the opening of the seven thunders right now i want to begin to work with this because all these things were left mysterious right because remember if satan ever got a hold of it it would do great damage right so remember that's one of the things you never do if you say it out loud or if lord reveals something to you sometimes he tells you to keep that quiet right and the reason why is that because satan gets a hold of it he'll do anything in his power to try to what to destroy what that will bring right so notice tonight we're going to deal with this idea safety in goshen all right and the uh and knoweth it not in 65 815 170 uh he's talking about these things and he said and he said there'll be hideous sights upon the earth locusts with hair like women long hair to haunt them women that cut their hair teeth like lion stingers in their tails like scorpions they would torment men months just wait till we get into opening them plagues and seals and then them seven thunders watch what takes place oh brother and this is where we're gonna focus tonight he says oh brother uh uh we're on slide four it says oh brother you better get to goshen while there's time to get to goshen don't pay any attention to this outside phenomenal quote but it's working with what moving into the tribulation period right and uh of course he talks about those plagues and the thunders and remember uh we find that evidence after the seals that it was his desire to get some time and to actually go and preach on the vials preach on the trumpets preach on the thunders and uh notice uh it never got to a place outside of the trumpets where he could actually do that but notice and this is where we want to focus because he actually begins to relate that tribulation period and he said you better get to goshen before that time all right all right because there's only going to be a certain amount of time to get there so that tells me right there when you look at the coming of the lord you can actually go back to the scripture and then going back to the scripture you can find that there should be a picture that plays with goshen all right now notice this let's take a look at goshen here in genesis 45 remember god had actually allowed joseph to perfectly type christ but in the end it was actually to save life wasn't it in genesis 45 7 it says and god sent me joseph speaking before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance oh my god so now it was not you that sent me hither but god isn't it something you don't have to blame your brother for anything you have to be bitter at people that disagree with you or do bad things to you right you don't have to get like that because why because if you can actually see that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered then you can still love them amen joseph was able to actually move into the mind of god and realize that those things were actually done he allowed them to betray him so that he could actually save them hallelujah it's okay if you disagree but i believe i trust that what the movement of the holy spirit on a true believer that no matter if they've gone or wherever they're at it will allow that true believer by faith to bring them back to a place they can get saved right amen as was evidenced by the prayers that we've seen here hallelujah now notice he says uh and he hath made me the eighth verse a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt hate she and go up to my father and say unto him thus saith thy son joseph god hath made me lord of all egypt come down unto me tarry not in the desert condition come down to joseph look and thou shalt dwell in the land of goshen and thou shalt be near unto me thou and thy children and thy children's children that flocks my herds and all that thou hast and there will i nourish thee for yet there are five years of famine lest thou in thy household and all that thou has come to poverty amen now let's look at this the original intent of god for goshen was actually so god would what he would give his church a place so joseph would nourish them goshen is a place of nourishment remember joseph was a type of christ now bringing the church back and while we find that he doesn't give them the worst of the land the desert land he gives them the ocean and there was a place to be nourished all right let's continue genesis 47 4. moving on he says they said moreover unto pharaoh for to so adjourn in the land are we come for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks for the famine is soar in the land of canaan now therefore we pray thee let thy servants dwell in the land of goshen right he's given us permission right he says in pharaoh speak unto joseph saying thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee the land of egypt is before thee in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell whether you see it or not if you're in goshen you are in the best place to dwell now i want you to see this because this is going to move into something all right it may not be what you think it is but at least show you where you're at so he says in the land of goshen let them dwell and if thou knowest any men of activity among them make them rulers over my cattle and joseph brought us in his jacob his father and set him before pharaoh and joseph blessed jacob blessed pharaoh all right so notice goshen was the best possible land that they could live in all right now let's continue so let's get to the definition what is goshen what does it mean all right next next slide here it says goshen actually has two meanings all right one is an approaching or a drawing near we are drawing near brother sister but notice the second definition is reign or the dew of heaven in blessings so it's a what an approaching or a drawing near to the rain amen or to the dew of blessings all right we're looking for a ladder right amen and what goshen is typing what moving or approaching near that that time when you'll be able to pull the blessings of the reign of god out in a time of trouble all right so in type it was given because of joseph right goshen is given to you and taught it's also set before he was sent before to deliver joseph norse them it was the most fertile land that they had now let's look at this in the token in 64. it says israel coming out of egypt as i said a few minutes ago is a type of the bride coming out of the church when moses began his ministry israel gathered together in one place in goshen begin to pray because they knowed that the hour was at hand because they knew something was there the delivery had already come god was working doing things showing what he was going to do they come from all parts of egypt just like they will at the day of his coming they'll take people out of the methodist baptist lutheran right remember in revelations 18 4 it's come out of her my people and be not partakers of her sins that the plagues come not upon thee all right he'll say what and all those who are identified in christ by the token god will take them with him when he comes amen so notice going into goshen is what a type of the bride coming out of what is coming out of the church and what into the fertile lands where they can be separated all right now we're going to begin to look at this all right i want you to see this in one sense we look at goshen and we say wow what a place of blessing and i'm gonna hit that tonight just a little bit and then we're gonna come back around because you hear it so many times but there's light in the ocean sister when there's light and goshen it ain't nothing but a blessing glory to god we're in goshen hallelujah and it's so easy for us to get caught in that type or that idea that goshen is nothing but a place of blessing and no challenge all right it sure sounds like it let's look as the plagues next slide are are coming down on the earth uh uh the ten plagues of course the plagues that fell from moses there it says exodus 8 20 says the lord said unto moses rise up early in the morning and stand before pharaoh he cometh forth to water and say unto him thus saith the lord let my people go that they may serve me else if thou wilt not let my people go behold i will send swarms of flies upon thee and upon thy servants upon thy people into the houses and the houses of the egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies and also the ground whereon they are all right so remember he gave the sign of of the rod get thrown on the ground it was a snake and what pharaoh had some magicians that could do the same thing amen although it was actually what moses stick that ain't theirs amen hallelujah that's quite the snake right but now look at this so now pharaoh refused him and said it was a cheap magician's trick and now god is sending a plague of flies upon pharaoh in his house now look at what this says in the 22nd verse it says and i will sever in that day the land of goshen in which my people dwell that no swarms of flies shall be there oh glory to god no plagues in goshen hallelujah to the end that thou mayest know that i am the lord in the midst of the earth amen so when these plagues were actually coming down remember which was a type of of the church or the the bride leaving the church god was actually severing goshen from the rest of the judgment we should look for that amen to not have the same judgment that's upon the earth right why because we're living in the ocean hallelujah the approaching near the rain the dew of blessings right now notice 8 23 and this is huge and i will put a division between my people and thy people tomorrow shall this sign be and the lord did so and there came a grievous swarm of flies in the house of pharaoh and into his servants houses and into all the land of egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies right the commandment was let my people go let my people out of egypt god is doing that right now he's trying to get us out of egypt amen now notice this but god has to want he has to show a difference between goshen and the rest of egypt all right and notice it's his desire to put division that is what viewable that there's a supernatural protection over the bride of jesus christ notice they couldn't kill moses they couldn't kill aaron his spokesman they couldn't touch them amen they were ordained for a job and until the job was finished they could not be touched why because they were what they were called in an hour to bring forth the church hallelujah so notice there had to be division now we want to hurry through this here uh looking in the lamb's book of lies he said then this wise virgin went away in translation and these others who came and knocked on the door what happened what taken place the bible said they were cast into outer darkness where there was weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth israel when the tribulation period hit egypt there wasn't one thing ever struck the israelites because they were in god's provided place goshen no tribulations at all see the rest of them was in the tribulation but not this one now all those things being shadows they've got to type something amen there was a type of judgment falling out right now remember the bride we're going to see the start because remember why were those 200 million demons released they were aimed at the bride but they will miss the bride because the bride goes into rapture and they will fully manifest on the church all right now let's look once again hell when hale came in in exodus 9 26 only in the land of goshen were the children of israel where the children of israel were was there no hail no plagues are there exodus 10 20 it says but the lord hardened pharaoh's heart so that he would not let the children of israel go and the lord said unto moses stretch out thine hand towards the heaven that there be there may be darkness over the land of egypt even darkness which may be felt and moses stretched forth his hand towards heaven and there is a thick darkness in all the land of egypt three days they saw not one another neither rose up any from his place for three days but all the children of israel had light in their dwellings so while the plagues were falling on the unbeliever the church was protected and taken care of amen sounds good all right so notice goshen was the place of separation your prophet said you better get to goshen while you can get there amen so goshen is a place where the blessings of god are it's the most fertile land all right next slide so i went through that pretty quick these i got two sermons in one here so i'm not able to fully do it as good as i'd like but i want you to see this it said we tend to think the life of israel was rejoicing in pleasure as their deliverance comes right that's what we focus on there's light in goshen all there is having a hallelujah a good time well i think the pledge that they were missing was probably a hallelujah good time but just because they were missing the brunt of those plagues don't think that there was not opposition and challenge to the movement that god was trying to do in them amen now next we'll work with exodus 3 9. now even before as these things are coming look at what god tells moses he says now therefore behold the cry of the children of israel has come up unto me and i've also seen the oppression where with the egyptians oppress them come now therefore and i will send thee unto pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of israel out of egypt they were already in slavery when the pledge began falling they did not lose the servitude of slavery although they missed the lot the plagues fallen they were still living under the toil of life all right let's go a little further when you see this exodus five we'll draw here a little bit one and afterwards moses and aaron went in and told pharaoh thus saith the lord god of israel let my people go that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness and pharaoh said who is the lord that i should obey his voice to let israel go i know not the lord neither will i let israel go supposed to go easy they said the god of the hebrews hath met with us let us go we pray thee three days journey into the desert and sacrifice unto the lord our god lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword and the king of egypt said unto them wherefore do ye moses and aaron let the people from their works get you unto your burdens and pharaoh said behold the people of the land now are many and you make them rest from their burdens so pharaoh didn't say you know what the plagues are coming uh those plagues are here and i don't know your god so you know what i'm going to let you guys rest and just enjoy life and take it ease and be laid to sin but we find out that he said your people are many i ain't gonna do that you get to your burden so notice notice even in the time of the deliverance of the church they still had to carry their burdens they had to have something to fight let's go next verse and he continues and pharaoh commanded the same day the task masters of the people and their officers saying ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick as heretofore let them go gather straw for themselves that's the easy life right there oh wait it's actually getting harder the closer they get to their deliverance well they we're crying out for a body change amen we're tired looking to be delivered from the slavery of this world amen being bound to system being bound to flesh being bound to anything but to the original garden of life that god called us to but look you think it'd be easy here it is it actually it says here you should no more give the people straw to make brick as heretofore let them go and gather straw from themselves and the tale of bricks which they didn't make to make you hear for it says ye shall lay upon them ye shall not diminish ought thereof for they be idol therefore their cry saying let us go and sacrifice to our god you see all they want to do was go serve their god all they originally were asking is what just let us go three days journey into sacrifice but pharaoh did not want the people to lose their slavery amen right we are a free people amen but what we constantly have to fight the slavery of this thing amen in in in the political life in in the social life in in physical flesh we have to fight right it's not giving us something easy but as the as the the uh the going away actually strikes and the exodus it actually gets harder and that should be the challenge is getting greater right i talked to i talked to older brothers at times and and they would say oh you know 30 years ago man the holy ghost would just come down and your service isn't phenomenal well why do all things get all quiet very simple because the challenge is getting harder right your prophet said this age would be many times harder than any other age so he said how can i overcome it's that fact that's a fact we're gonna have to battle to get out of here amen all right it says let there more work be laid upon the men that they may labor therein and let them not regard vain words and the task masters of the people went out and their officers and they spake the people saying thus say pharaoh i will not give you straw so everything's getting harder they're expected to do the same things but they got a greater burden than they had before well why are you saying this because this is what we're looking at it's harder to watch to get the spirit of god in the midst because why we got so many things to fight right even now we gotta fight we gotta fight cell phone addiction we gotta fight we gotta fight all these little areas of every portion of your life it's not easy it's getting more challenging yeah but one thing is factual when you look at the scenario judgment is falling all over the earth right now sometimes i thank god i said thank god for ohio because in a lot of these other places they they got their whole entire californians burning down to the ground everywhere can't even go to church oh thank god for the freedom we have amen honestly god has gave us some grace yes sir i hope i don't blow your mind to some of these things because this is this is this right scripture now notice even continuing you think you think israel is all really excited about this yes it's getting harder this is great the rapture's here hallelujah and they became more pentecostal all the time well i'll see what the scripture says next portion of scripture the officers of the children of israel move down to the 19th verse did see they were in evil case after was said ye shall not mish ought from your bricks of your daily task and they met moses and aaron who stood in the way as they came forth from pharaoh i bet they got a good report let's see what they say and they said unto them the lord look upon you and judge because you have made our savior to be abhorred in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants to put a sword in their hand to slay us and moses returned unto the lord and said lord wherefore as thou so evil and treated this people why is it that thou hast sent me for since i came to pharaoh to speak in thy name he hath done evil to this people neither hast thou delivered thy people at all so the leaders of israel actually stood against moses and aaron as the trial got harder oh my oh my there's doubting in the cab because oh it just became too hard to deal with things got a little bit too difficult yes so notice they turned on the messenger and yet they still we're in goshen yes sir yes sir good so i'm saying should we when you hear oh get the gosh and get there while there's still time we like to think oh it's nothing but daisies and roses out here but it's not that way the challenge is here amen the temptations are here but what the spirit of the lord remember the bible says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the lord raises a standard amen it's time to dig in deep amen realize that we're children of the king amen and we're going to act like children of the king amen we'll stay with the lord we'll keep moving forward and we'll believe every promise amen there's always going to be those that get a bad report but remember these same ones there's a mixed multitude coming out but this rapture is not that way it was a spiritual type amen hallelujah that goshen what it is the fertile nourishing land amen but it doesn't mean that you're free of the world he's right i'm looking forward to leaving it aren't you amen so even moses is asking god what's going on god these plagues all oh i mean you told me to tell him to let my people go let not my people let your people go let them go and it just kept on getting harder yes oh my let's continue exodus 6'5 next passage it says and i have also heard the groaning of the children of israel whom the egyptians keep in bondage and i've remembered my covenant wherefore say unto the children of israel i am the lord and i will bring you out from under the burdens of the egyptians so god god told me what they're still in burdens now it's double and why god brings the message to them that he's going to set them free now i want you to see this this is very powerful here and i'll bring you from the burns of the egyptians and will rid you out of their bondage and i will redeem you with a stretched out arm and with great judgments and i will take you to me for a people and i will be to you a god and ye shall know that i am the lord your god which bringeth you out from under the burdens of egypt of the egyptians and i will bring you in unto the land concerning the witch i did swear to give it to abraham isaac and jacob and i will give it you for in heritage i am the lord. now look at this the old underlying part exodus 6 9 and moses spake so unto the children of israel but they hearkened not unto moses for anguish of spirit and for cruel bondage that was a word of prophecy a word straight from god to encourage them in all their burdens even double foam get ready it's not going to last much longer i'm going to redeem you set you free but i want you to see this they were so much placed into a servitude so much into being worn out by all the surrounding conditions that were around them the bible says they weren't even able to hearken unto the voice of moses and he said it was because they had anguish of anguish of spirit and for cruel bondage the challenges of the world were just too much oh my let's look at anguish so they had what spiritual anguishment here extreme pain either a body or mind as bodily pain that may differ from agony which is such the stress of the whole body as to cause contortion whereas anguish may be a local pain as an author or gout but anguish and agony are nearly synonymous as pain of the mind it signifies any keen distress from sorrow remorse despair and kindred passions did get that they had their expectation of what deliverance would look like they thought deliverance was to have the biggest church they thought it was to have the biggest ministry maybe maybe they thought every all the unbelievers would convert over because oh we're in israel look at it look at how we we uh look at all the blessings that god has done to abraham isaac and jacob but it wasn't that way and you can see why your prophet typed this right in with the great tribulation period moving on in because that anguish of spirit says it's as pain of the mind and what it's distressed from sorrow remorse despair and kindred passions [Music] life was going the way that they didn't expect it to go they were expecting more they had expectations of what that would be they thought well when we came here it was nothing but blessings we had the newest land they still had it they were still in the best part of egypt they were still free of the plagues but they left the toil of slavery hallelujah right i mean we weren't free from this thing and you can't get away from it amen it wants to sin it wants to do everything contrary to the word it's something you must fight to keep under subjection amen right almost so many times like oh i can just get away from this thing and look the closer they got to the exodus you would have thought they would have got more excited because of all are the plagues falling in egypt but the scripture says they couldn't even receive the word of prosperity from the lord spurgeon talks through he says anguish of spirit whether it comes from god's hand in the form of personal affliction or from man's hand in the form of unjust oppression may become the occasion of neglecting the salvation of christ he's talking about anguish of spirit you just get so distressed oh i'm so stressed out i can't hardly handle this you think about this we're not we're not in these countries that have no food ethiopia some of these countries they only have any food locus ate their complete crop up we better get goshen because it might come our way next hallelujah he says beware of neglecting your spiritual state and interest while you are well in the expectation that distress when it comes will make you religious are you catching with ss right there's your desperations a lot of people wait for the emergency or wait for the challenge because they think that they'll just rise to the challenge even your prophecy he said don't wait for the emergency now is the time it's time to prepare now the freedom that we have it's time to watch to nourish the spirit of god in our midst amen and to get in operation get the gifts going get the holy ghost in our midst more than ever before and watch and get so spiritually on fire amen that when trouble comes we won't get anguished as spirit we won't get a burden from the trials we'll walk right through it with the shining of the token amen but notice because there's a really big truth to this we think that the stress is going to make us religious right right i've had people come come to church and they've got no money they ask for money for toilet paper because they don't have any toilet paper but they got a brand new phone they would rather pay their phone bill than buy toilet paper right they can't live without the phone but they can live without toilet paper everything is so set up that the people's minds have been so altered away from the things that matter that's right what matters right now is getting ready for the coming of the lord the people of needs have needs and what by god's grace we meet what we can but watch we find out that what it's so easy to misplace what the purpose of right now is we plant our potatoes absolutely but what we don't get so lukewarm that the lord would spew us from his mouth hallelujah we gotta stay at a condition that will what we see we see the judgments the judgments are sent so we can get ready for exodus amen that's one of the greatest challenges because people thought 60 years ago this thing was going to happen while while the seven things was here it didn't happen yes here we are 60 55 whatever 60 years it is later and you know what we've just dipped so far from what the expectation should be [Music] but what is it everything around you is trying to aid that it's trying to aid the transformation away from the true word and move it into what a lukewarm word a lukewarm state right right that accepts anything now notice there's no truth in nature more certain than this that the time of health and happiness is the best time for cleaning the christ and making our calling and election sure like that then it could be best done if men would then do it right beware unless you let you be letting the best time slip past and the worst time draw on while you are not saved it is true that god sovereign mercy often uses affliction to bring us to christ but he does so because we would not come to christ at all earlier and better time the mind maybe may be heavenly without sore bondage and earthly with it i love the man some phenomenal phenomenal thinkers and and spirit-led men but notice we find that what now is the day of salvation today it is amen today's the way the time to get ready when they tell you that there's a great reset and a new normal that should tell you that you need a reset and a new normal but those two are contrary same thing with their idea and what the bible's idea are two separate things amen we're looking for a great recess reset amen and that's that's that rain paulie pouring down on the week amen the bible says cry out unto the lord in the time of the latter rain amen they're talking about uh a one world order we're talking about getting the holy ghost in what in such a measure we can get out of this earth amen hallelujah let's look at let's look at moses again i get this right yep next next verse exodus 6 10 and the lord spake unto moses saying so there they were they couldn't even it was so hard to receive the word did it mean they weren't israel no no but it was the challenges that they had to face in the conditions of the exodus yes right it's what it is yes but you know what there's still a difference of being in goshen and being in egypt that's what you've got to see right don't get jealous of the sons of men when they're rich and they got all this stuff and don't go get jealous of that you look at your spiritual condition amen ephesians said you'd be blessed with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places amen now's not the time to to see how rich you can get it's time to see how spiritually rich you can get exodus 6 10 and lord speak unto moses saying go in speak unto the pharaoh king of egypt that he let the children of israel go out of his land and moses spake before lord saying behold the children of israel have not hearkened unto me how then shall pharaoh hear me who am of uncircumcised lips see this just wasn't hard for the the children of israel this season was so challenging now notice this is his thoughts he's expressing his thoughts to god he said not even i mean sometimes pastors can get like that right right oh the holy ghost told me to preach after the church and they and they just they didn't even receive it right how's the unbeliever gonna hear my church when you hear it you know not uh it's not us you know certain churches out there somewhere so notice he even got into a anguish of spirit himself and he's talking to god he's talking to god i was like oh i'm talking to god i would never have one problem in my life right it's so easy to think that way oh if i was tied in like a problem oh glory to god no you wouldn't right remember he even said it he said he said he said he said a lot of people envy this type of a position but you don't realize the challenges that go with it [Applause] can you imagine all these people need healing in you and god will tell you go here you feel like to go this way and that person dies and then these people blame you these people are calling you a false prophet these people are bringing false prophecies that your that your family is going to die and you're going to die and all these things like that every hindrance imaginable thrown right in his face what do you think he had yes sir pharaoh's laughing in his face pharaoh's saying okay i'll let the people go and so he stops the plague and next day again they won't let nobody go happen time and time again it was a wearing out type of season that's why the bible says in isaiah 40 30 they that way upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall rise up with the strength as eagles amen why did those eagles need to renew their strengths why is an eagle type of yes today it's speaking to the eagle age right now saying only it spoke to all the ages but this one particular because this is the eagle age oh i wish i had time to go there because you find out that this is the age because the the special thing about that eagle is is upon renewal it can soar back in the skies and fly above all the trials of the earth it can go so high that it can go above the storm yes hallelujah i'm telling you this this is a in in a very interesting time brother sister the eagle populations are really rising i just seen it the other day i seen an eagle on a dead carcass on the road and remember eagles are supposed to only eat living things that's right the fresh meat yes why is that going on i i told him i told the guy at work and he said oh you said i live up by oak harbor where there's a ton of eagles he said they do all there too everybody's looking for an easy what an easy meal can't we just have it the easy way it's too hard to hunt all these things [Music] it's too hard to hunt for a revelation it's too hard to hunt for the word of god amen it's too hard to hunt until god gives you the answer oh i'll just i'll just settle for this dead carrying over here true but the fact still remains eagles they that wait on the lord shall renew their strength but you see that is one of the greatest mistakes that we miss and you know your prophet said this he said we don't wait on god enough i am guilty to god help me because communion is not one-sided yes when we have set our prayers it doesn't matter how long that prayers you some of us you can talk god for five hours but you know if the pill is sitting there you could probably talk to the pillar for five hours right but what am i saying it's not prayer is not the expectation that you're just going to say something to somebody because prayer is communion you're praying to god you're bringing worthy and and glory unto his name unto unto him in an intimate way and then you expect just like you come to the house of god you're expecting the holy ghost to speak to you that's what we're missing yes sir and remember here's voice 58 what your prophet said i'm just going to inspiration now so this must be needed but he said many people will pray but they don't pray long enough to a place where they have what where all the voices have got aside and there's nothing but faith to hear from god let's paraphrase but that's what it says see what it is when you're actually praying you're praying until the voices in your head leave you know the issue with the neurotic time you know the real issue with a neurotic time is or if or if you're near a traumatic state right you've got you've got big problems in your life i find as a pastor even dealing with things it is harder i thought it'd be easier to pray when when when all hell is loosed on you it's not you'd think it'd be easy to pray when it's loosed on you like that it's not it's ten times harder because you start talking to god and the next thing oh i could do with it this way well i could do it this way i could do that way and i could do this and then think oh what if what if what if you got all these things going around your mind it gets that much harder to wait on god because then when you go to wait on god your mind's still trying to run right you see how we have to separate ourselves from that type of a mindset and move into the position that we can get a perfect faith that god wants to speak to us remember your prophet said he said he said he might not speak you today it'll speak to you tomorrow it may not be tomorrow it may be next week but you're at what constantly in the expectation that you move into that personal walk with god where he can lead you in a greater way in his perfect will amen we know his word is his will that's easy but what about finding the mystery of his will for you yes sir yes sir hallelujah that's for somebody praise god let's go to the next quote perseverance you fight every inch of the way god down in egypt give palestine to the jews but they fought every inch of the way god told joshua every everywhere the souls of your feet rest that have i given you footsteps mean victory possession just as far as you can climb into the kingdom of god if you just want to climb a little peace and say well i believe i may not have to go to hell but i believe that i'll be saved in the end if i join church you ain't got much ground yet but every promise in the bible is yours but you'll have to fight every devil guard away from it with a two-edged sword and claim it for yourself be persistent walking right into it what do you think goshen was sure they missed those plagues like that but they had to fight every inch of the way the spiritual oppression was so great that it seemed like what seemed like they'd never get out of it oh god when when are you going to do this for me oh god when are you going to get that right that's some of the greatest challenges right many of us here we've prayed and we've been prayed for several times for maybe even the same thing and after a while you just sit back and say well i just accept it and you start getting down about you say god why aren't you answering me i love because i searched that out years ago and i found the prophecy he said you might have been up here six six times or seven times something like that and he said he said but today's your day that's where we gotta be amen hallelujah you're crying out for a healing for the holy ghost you sit right there and say you know what i didn't get anything there but i'm right here and i still believe it amen hallelujah next just got a few more we're almost done honestly we're almost done this time 61 revelations chapter 5. he says now satan will constantly punch at you until you're finished here on earth just remember that you'll never have a time but what there's a punching going on all the time because you're in a battle did you ask to come to christ to go to a picnic see we want goshen why should be able to be rich and not be in debt and not have any problems i should have an easy life i'm in the bride what kind of bride is that the scripture says to him that overcometh will i give all and to inherit all things right good brother i've been on the field for 31 years and i fought every inch of the way that's right israel to fight every inch of the way palestine was given to them but they had to fight every inch of the way to get it are you an every inch fighter yes hey man but the thing to do is to recognize what state are you in see you have to remember that no matter what comes your way and what the toil is you're in goshen you're not in egypt yes right i think proverbs 3 talked about i talk about don't fear what happens to the sons of men don't even fear don't even worry about what comes to them right because you're different amen amen [Music] you're still gonna have challenges but you have what you have a predestinated life that god gave you amen next scripture so the good part to all this is all that anguish is spirit all those challenges that they have exodus 11 1 and the lord said unto moses yet will i bring one plague more upon pharaoh and upon egypt afterwards he will let you go hence when he shall let you go he shall surely thrust you out hence all together speak now in the ears of the people and let every man borrow of his neighbor and every woman of her neighbor jewels of silver and jewels of gold and the lord gave the people favor in the sight of the egyptians moreover the man moses was very great in the land of egypt in the sight of pharaoh's servants and in the sight of the people they might have been dealing with the toils they might have been suffering in that way but notice god came in the season of the final showdown now notice this did the people do it absolutely the scripture says they spoiled the egyptians [Laughter] hallelujah you couldn't get away from the blessing of god but god had to get them ready for the exodus so there was that trial period to say who's going to stay who's going to believe it has enough mental fortitude by the holy ghost to withstand the challenges of this hour hallelujah right that's what i'm saying that quote can overcome he said the demons in this hour are many times harder to fight they're hard to fight absolutely because they'll take you this way then they'll take you that way the best thing to do is just sit there right with the promise of god and saying god has already revealed it amen i believe that there's going to be a bride she's going to be pure and spotless amen god called me to it i'm staying in my post i'm going to stick with this rapture and i'm going to make it amen so it all comes to an end right it's the same way with the seven seal don't worry everything's going to happen just the way it's supposed to happen hey man remember that's why that's why your prop said numerous times he said don't fear or worry about it any of it he said you just go on and live a good christian life and the lord will take care of the rest because what is that that's living in goshen that's living where you're free amen that's living in a place that you don't have to worry about tomorrow she said take no thought for tomorrow if god cares for the sparrows how much more does he care about you amen all right almost done so what do we find come the less plague the death angel that says 12 11. and thus shall you eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet your staff in your hand and you shall eat it in haste it is the lord's passover for i'll pass the land of egypt this night and will smite all the firstborn in the land of egypt both man and beast and against all the gods of egypt i will execute judgment i am the lord and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are ye are and when i see the blood i will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when i smite the land of egypt see the place not for you it's not for you but what is it you have to put the blood on the doorpost and the lentils amen amen you have to apply the blood yes the token is the holy ghost and you have to get behind that that door with the blood on it right and this day shall be unto you for a memorial and you shall keep it a feast to the lord throughout your generations you shall keep it a feast by ordinance forever god did never want them to forget about it aren't you glad that they wrote about it because it tells you that you know what just get the token and be ready to go in the time of exodus amen now's the time for the token now's the time to believe it now's the time to what just like in a baby eel she's got to flutter her wings but she's going to stay right there and keep doing it until she can fly amen that's what we got to do so notice in closing token 63 i'm trying to press upon your minds friend that the hour has struck and something has got to be done by it we must do something it's either in or out that's all the hour has come where the token must be there if there's ever this church ever expects to remain alive until jesus christ comes the token will have to be there be here that's all if death don't it'll take the death mark and soon it's in congress right now the big machine set up to make all churches come into that federation of churches and you better really have the token shining but the hour is here for the exodus did you get that if you ever expect to make it to the coming of the lord you better have the token amen if you want to be those and first leslie phones before it says to them that are alive and remain we shall be caught up to meet him in the air notice you better really have the token shining see them see what i'm saying i just told this to the church the other day that when you look at the whole scenario of jesus christ the word and i said i preach this because this is also challenging for me but everything that's going on around you right now i told the church of course those things will make you nervous right yes right yeah but we have that we have that even the one fellow there he's he's talking he had all these dreams about things that were going to happen and by november and in november and all these things like that a lot of it didn't happen but they even even when they first showed it to me somebody showed it to me saying you got to check this out it's going to happen over here we're going to have you in and and i just listened and one thing he said he said he said why why listen to 40 news channels a day i look at 40 news channels a day or something like that and i'm like the alarm was going off because if we have scriptural understanding we know how dreams work dreams can come from god absolutely they're a gift of god but the bible also says that dreams come from a man of business if all you do is feed yourself with all the neurotic stuff that's going on how are you not going to be neurotic and also dream about neurotic things you see what i'm saying so we got to watch that i'm telling you i just had to back up who's gonna be president i don't know i don't know strive me nuts we're living in a uh not just an unprecedented time in american history we're living in an unprecedented time of corruption going un unprosecuted so what do we do about it you running for mayor next month is that how we're going to do it right talked to somebody's talking to us one time they said we know how we're gonna do it we're gonna get it one baby at a time we have big giant families well populate them huh so season of the exodus you see what i'm saying but but it's easy because your mind just runs to all these places right don't think things don't come to your mind right like i bet i can fix this i do this and i do that that net why don't you try this why don't we try just to get closer to jesus christ amen amen because he said these times would be here i hope this helps everyone i know i know the church i'm in i even know myself it can be so easy to get caught up in all this stuff but you see what you're doing trump says he's a christian biden says he's a christian but look at the fruit quite a starting point maybe it should be a stopping point that's why brother ramsay said i'm voting for jesus christ not saying that we i'm not saying that we don't want uh we don't want godly things to prosper in our country but if all these things are building up why is it happening it's happening to get us out of our normal condition and to get us to a place that we start what realizing that we need to make more sacrifice in order to get right with god because that's why these things come remember you still have your freedom right now don't wait till anguish anguish of spirit and the bondage of slavery comes in even harder if you see it it's obvious either way you go there's no place for you in there because you're either going to be part of the system or you're going to lose freedom or religion either way you're going to do it right so where's the place for you hey did you see that cloud up there all right the only thing you can look for is to look up for your jump to draw 9. you see it right let's stand little botched up sermon i pray that was all right but i wanted you to understand that that when you look at where we're at all these things type in just perfect they say it's so easy for for someone to look at someone going through a great trial and they say oh they're probably just backslid and wicked and blah blah blah blah blah ain't no blah blah with that right here if you're really serving god you're going to fight every inch amen i would be more worried if you have no challenges at all right right just because just because they say they believe and they gotta and they got a porsche that don't mean anything and they're best buddies with a big preacher or whoever it is that don't mean nothing the only thing that means something is if you know you have the baptism of the holy ghost that's right and you're watching the fruit of what you are being likened to mourn to christ that's right right i hope you love him it's a very simple sermon brother sister like i said i come here i try to get things right with the word i had a lot of things to preach i didn't know what to preach and uh this is where the lord kind of brought me but i want you to see so you could be happy where you're at you'll be absolutely happy with whatever challenge or trial you got in your life thank god for it be happy about it because this is all to test you it's seeing what you're going to do as we said before as for me in my house we shall follow the lord we're going to serve the lord that's right amen have you decided to follow jesus there's no turning back there's no turning back don't let the greatest battle ever fought overcome you it's not you you're looking what you're looking at your sacrifice let the nature of god bring basically the the emphasis of christ in you because that's what will come the more you look at your sacrifice the more you trust god the more you give up to god having faith in him it will bring change in your life that's right is there any witnesses that believe that i've seen that in your own life i've seen some of my greatest trials brother sister and and i feel so far away from god and it's some of the greatest character i've received yes sir some of that stuff could be 10 years old still hurts but you know i'm so glad i got it because it taught me love it taught me grace and one thing you know because you can always point and say well that person this and that person but you know what what if you look at the mirror of the word of who you are you see what i'm saying what if you look at yourself compared to what jesus christ did for you right you say beautiful you should always have compassion don't ever give up on anybody the holy spirit don't tell you then you have hope and you trust that god will help people went down the ark and i heard ken ham stated as on the whatever radio or something like that but but somebody said i'm praying for my relatives can you keep my relatives in prayer ken ham said he said this it got stuck out in my head he said he said well if you believe the bible he said everybody's your relative he said we all came from noah at this point in time now we know the two seed lines but understand what we're saying that's your fellow man they're made in the image and likeness of god let god do the separating and you you do your best to put them in there until god does otherwise amen you love lord amen let's bow our heads amen maybe tonight you're saying oh god this sermon was based just to give you a little relief of mind that if you're going through stresses if you're going through challenges that's all right because that's what living in goshen is it's not the easy life it's not the laodicean life but it's a time of self-sacrifice
