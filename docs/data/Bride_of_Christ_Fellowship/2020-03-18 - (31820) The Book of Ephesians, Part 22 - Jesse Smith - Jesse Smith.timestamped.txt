[28:50] can't hear me okay he's in Chapter five
[28:54] would like to continue on the book of a
[28:56] fusion series I believe this is part 22
[29:05] we ended last Wednesday's service with
[29:08] verse 21 in fusions 521 so let's read
[29:12] Ephesians 5 21 and 22 we also have our
[29:17] memory verse so we'll get to that as
[29:19] well by God's grace seasons 521 let's
[29:27] all read that one together on three one
[29:30] two three
[29:31] submitting yourselves one to another in
[29:34] the fear of God Bob you would let's go
[29:38] to Roman's 12:1 and 2 this is our memory
[29:41] verse 4 March
[29:54] let's read this together and as we read
[29:57] it we trust the Holy Spirit to write it
[29:58] upon our hearts that we can lay
[30:00] ourselves upon God's altar tonight
[30:03] tomorrow and every day on three let's
[30:07] read that together one two three I
[30:10] beseech you therefore brethren by the
[30:13] mercies of God that you present your
[30:16] bodies a living sacrifice holy
[30:19] acceptable unto God which is your
[30:22] reasonable service and need not
[30:26] conformed to this world but be
[30:28] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[30:31] that you may prove what is that good and
[30:34] acceptable and perfect will of God let's
[30:38] have a word of Prayer that we need on
[30:39] your heart let's just make it learner to
[30:41] God here surely God's Word will it'll
[30:45] cut it it'll slice it also feed
[30:47] it'll also quench the thirsty Heavenly
[30:51] Father we love you we thank you for your
[30:53] word they give her the Holy Spirit Lord
[30:55] who gets into the word quickens the word
[30:57] and makes it alive annoys me Lord to
[30:59] preach nor it's under different
[31:00] circumstances but Lord we know ever two
[31:03] or three are gathered you're there in
[31:04] the midst so Lord we just ask God that
[31:06] your Holy Spirit would speak to every
[31:08] heart cut off Lord any sins of the flesh
[31:12] Lord God circumcise our hearts Lord God
[31:15] it was quickening power Lord Jesus and
[31:17] father maybe their lives here on your
[31:19] your altar of sacrifice that we can be
[31:22] shining lights signing testimonies
[31:25] bright stars Lord God salty salt that we
[31:28] might be the kind of Christians Lord
[31:30] your Bible calls us to be a holy calling
[31:32] anoint us now here I pray in Jesus
[31:35] Christ's name
[31:36] every said Amen god bless you maybe see
[31:39] it there in your homes so now we're
[31:49] willing we'll look at Ephesians chapter
[31:51] five and we want to mainly look at the
[31:55] family here or the marriage rather
[31:56] tonight we'll look at that
[32:00] I just want to emphasize a little bit
[32:04] Ephesians five verse two so I'm going to
[32:09] pull that up real quick
[32:11] seasons 5 2 is just kind of as a little
[32:13] background to tonight's message visions
[32:20] 5 to 5 in 5 1 & 2 be therefore followers
[32:25] of God as dear children and walk in love
[32:29] as Christ hath also loved us and have
[32:34] given himself for us and offering and a
[32:38] sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling
[32:41] savour I just want to start with this
[32:44] verse here because in this verse it
[32:47] calls all Christians that word ye means
[32:52] everyone so everyone needs to follow God
[32:56] imitate God and when we imitate God we
[33:00] walk like Christ and the Bible said walk
[33:03] in love because later we'll be looking
[33:05] at how a husband is to love his wife and
[33:08] a wife is submit is to submit to her
[33:11] husband and so we know this is done
[33:13] through the man in love he loves through
[33:16] God's love but the woman submits through
[33:19] God's love and that's her expression of
[33:22] God's love
[33:23] but I just want to point out of course
[33:26] that you know chapter 4 begins the
[33:30] practical application of how we love
[33:33] people right chapter 4 verse 1 begins
[33:36] the walk and warfare theme of this book
[33:40] that Paul gives us the first thing was
[33:43] the believers exalted position in Christ
[33:46] chosen in Christ before the foundation
[33:47] of the world and then in chapter 2 you
[33:50] get into the truth concerning the body
[33:52] of Christ were all saved by grace God's
[33:54] broken down the middle wall of partition
[33:56] Jew and Gentile are almost saved by the
[33:59] same blood the same covenants and we're
[34:01] all part of one holy temple one
[34:04] tabernacle the body of Jesus Christ but
[34:07] in chapter 4 we begin the walk in
[34:09] warfare of the believer and of course
[34:11] chapter 4 begins with the unity of the
[34:13] Church one spirit one faith one Lord one
[34:16] baptism and then it gets into the
[34:18] fivefold ministry which is what we're
[34:19] earning contending for today we know
[34:23] there's a great attack on the fivefold
[34:24] ministry today to try to silence her in
[34:28] order to just exalt one man William
[34:30] Branham and of course we believe William
[34:32] Branham was God's prophet but we don't
[34:35] get rid of the fivefold ministry like
[34:37] many people do today and so the Prophet
[34:40] even taught that the voice is now in the
[34:43] bride the spirit and the bride and the
[34:45] Prophet will all be saying the same
[34:48] thing and that will have already been
[34:50] said in God's Word and so in chapter 4
[34:53] it builds up with the fivefold ministry
[34:57] uniting the body of Christ and then as
[35:00] Christians were to put off the old man
[35:02] and then put on the new man which speaks
[35:04] the truth in love and doesn't give place
[35:07] to the devil forgives doesn't steal that
[35:10] is generous and doesn't and strives not
[35:13] to grieve the Holy Spirit of course
[35:15] we'll all grieve the Holy Spirit
[35:17] throughout the day if we when we fall
[35:19] short of the glory of God but we got to
[35:21] repent quickly and invite the presence
[35:23] of the Holy Spirit back into our minds
[35:26] and linking our minds as the mind is the
[35:28] area of the greatest battle ever fought
[35:32] so and then immediately after chapter 4
[35:36] it gets into chapter 5 and says walk in
[35:38] love so it's emphasized here to walk in
[35:42] love now we've worked our way through
[35:44] chapter 5 with the fruits of the spirit
[35:47] and how the wise will redeem the time
[35:50] foolish people will waste time but the
[35:53] wise virgins the wise Christians redeem
[35:55] the time they make the boot the best and
[35:58] wisest use of time they use it for the
[36:00] kingdom of God they seek first the
[36:02] kingdom of God and Christ's
[36:04] righteousness in their own life and then
[36:07] everything in the natural is added unto
[36:10] them praise God and then we saw saw how
[36:14] Paul gives us a very easy formula to
[36:17] walk in the spirit
[36:18] he told us then don't be drunk with wine
[36:20] he told us to sing to each other so sing
[36:23] songs together and then he said sing
[36:25] songs in your
[36:26] hard to make melody into God and then he
[36:29] says give thanks in everything even in
[36:32] the a this time of coronavirus and
[36:34] pandemic we're supposed to give thanks
[36:37] for all things to God in the name of the
[36:41] Lord Jesus Christ and then he says
[36:43] submit yourselves one to another last
[36:45] Wednesday we looked at that we submit
[36:47] ourselves to the government as long as
[36:49] they line up with God's Word we submit
[36:51] ourselves to the elders in the church
[36:53] the older Christians we submit ourselves
[36:55] to church leadership pastors and deacons
[36:58] we submit ourselves to to anyone we
[37:02] submit ourselves to other believers man
[37:04] or woman and trying to help them out as
[37:06] we can as it's allowed in God's Word of
[37:09] course we'll never break God's Word
[37:11] trying to submit to someone else but we
[37:14] always obey God's Word in all things so
[37:18] in other words the way up and God is
[37:20] down submitting ourselves to others
[37:22] serving others seeing how we can help
[37:25] others in this hour and now we're
[37:27] getting to tonight Scripture we see
[37:30] verse 22 speaks of wives for three
[37:34] scriptures and 25 it gets in two
[37:36] husbands for numerous more scriptures
[37:39] and then Paul calls this a great mystery
[37:43] in verse 32 and then he gives a great
[37:46] summary in verse 33 well we want to just
[37:50] labor on that tonight even if you're not
[37:52] married remember this applies to
[37:54] everyone because Paul says marriage is
[37:57] only a symbol of how the church should
[38:00] submit and love Jesus Christ so please
[38:03] don't tune this out please don't jump on
[38:06] your smartphone look at other things
[38:08] please don't just stare off into the
[38:10] blue you know try and focus here we can
[38:13] see through this through the mystery of
[38:15] marriage God's got unfolds hid the
[38:18] relationship that we should have as the
[38:21] bride the earthly bride to the heavenly
[38:24] bridegroom now I want to start I
[38:26] promised you last week I want to start
[38:29] with some history about the Roman and
[38:33] Ephesian culture now of course Ephesian
[38:35] culture was greatly influenced by Rome
[38:37] of course in that time in Paul's day
[38:39] Rome was that
[38:40] major Kingdom upon the earth has even
[38:42] told by Daniel and it still remains not
[38:45] natural Rome but spiritual Rome as the
[38:48] the Beast of this hour
[38:50] but I want to read you some history
[38:52] about the Roman culture that would have
[38:55] been very prevalent and would have with
[38:57] Ephesus being the second largest city
[38:59] outside of Rome itself the culture would
[39:02] have spilled over into Ephesus so I want
[39:05] to read first maybe take 10 maybe 15
[39:08] minutes read over this history so you
[39:12] can have an idea of how Paul's words
[39:15] would have been so radical especially
[39:18] took young Ephesian Christians or even
[39:21] dissenters of Ephesians that were
[39:22] sinners that maybe came into the church
[39:24] while Timothy was reading this letter
[39:26] from the Prophet Paul it would have been
[39:28] so shocking it just would have been just
[39:31] unheard of to hear what Paul was telling
[39:34] in commanding men and women on how to
[39:39] how to guide their marriage how to
[39:41] develop their marriage according to
[39:44] God's calling for them so let me just
[39:47] give an introduction I'm just going to
[39:48] read a little bit here if you can part
[39:50] of that just please ask the Lord let's
[39:52] ask the Lord just near Jesus help us
[39:54] just to keep our attention on the things
[39:56] of God here for a moment it is through
[40:01] the example of Jesus Christ that women
[40:03] owe most of their freedoms to today the
[40:08] advent of Christianity raised the
[40:10] dignity freedom and rights of women to
[40:12] levels never before known in any other
[40:16] culture or religion
[40:18] indeed as one historian wrote the birth
[40:22] of Jesus was the turning point in the
[40:24] history of women praise God that's right
[40:27] because you know through Eve that women
[40:30] fell but is through Mary's faith Mary's
[40:32] belief and the birth of this we'd say
[40:35] the immaculate seed here the Immaculate
[40:38] Conception this is how God redeemed
[40:40] woman praise God and of course man Eden
[40:42] - but especially women because she's the
[40:46] weaker vessel and she's the one that
[40:48] fell first through deception so this is
[40:52] the turning point praise God
[40:54] the new you so as a result of Jesus
[40:58] Christ and his teaching women today in
[41:00] much of the world especially in Western
[41:02] civilization enjoy far more privileges
[41:05] and rights than at any other time in
[41:07] human history
[41:09] praise God let's look at some history on
[41:11] women in the Middle East even today
[41:15] women in the Middle East especially
[41:18] those in countries where Christianity is
[41:21] not very accepting like in Muslim
[41:24] countries on Christian women have been
[41:27] publicly abused and flogged in Sudan for
[41:31] failing to wear the Islamic garments
[41:35] that women are supposed to wear to cover
[41:37] their heads faces and entire bodies can
[41:40] you imagine that under the Taliban rule
[41:44] in Afghanistan women are forbidden to go
[41:48] to school forbidden to work outside the
[41:50] home or even walk without their whole
[41:53] face and had been covered under that a
[41:55] body I think it's gone it's also illegal
[42:00] in Saudi Arabia for women to drive a
[42:03] motor vehicle so think about that this
[42:05] is what other religions and this not
[42:07] just a few people this is millions if
[42:09] not billions of people also one thing
[42:15] that was commonly practiced in other
[42:16] religions was polygamy now polygamy is
[42:20] permitted in Christianity and we've
[42:23] taught on that extensively but if you
[42:25] have any questions on that please
[42:26] contact us Christianity has always
[42:30] rejected polygamy because it rejects
[42:35] devoted love and devote it rejects the
[42:38] singleness of love between one man and
[42:40] one woman as Jesus quoted in Matthew
[42:43] chapter 19 remember Jesus Christ took us
[42:46] back to the Garden of Eden God suffered
[42:49] the Old Testament Moses and Abraham and
[42:51] David and Salman God suffered them to
[42:54] have wives and concubines and then even
[42:56] divorces in the days of Moses but Jesus
[42:59] takes us back to the beginning he takes
[43:01] us back to the days of Adam and Eve and
[43:03] that's where Christianity goes back
[43:06] [Music]
[43:08] Christian's maintain love is between one
[43:10] man and one woman if not in other
[43:14] religions then love is just mere lust it
[43:18] is not love so in polygamy it's mostly
[43:20] lust but in Christianity is based upon
[43:23] love because no woman who really loves
[43:27] her husband can tolerate having another
[43:30] wife can't share him with another woman
[43:33] and the same thing with a man any man
[43:35] that really loves his wife can't share
[43:37] her with any other man so see monogamy
[43:42] gives recognition and status and value
[43:46] to a woman I looked it up on Google did
[43:50] you know the Prophet Muhammad he was the
[43:52] founder of Islam had at least 11 wives
[43:55] Google said he at 11 this article says
[43:57] 16 plus 2 concubines Muhammad's
[44:02] successor caliph Umar married 7 women
[44:06] and had to slave concubines the Caliph
[44:10] of man had married 8 women Muhammad's
[44:13] son-in-law had 11 wives and 19 slave
[44:15] concubines Muhammad's grandson Hasan
[44:19] married 70 women and had at least 31
[44:21] children Muhammad also authorized
[44:24] temporary marriages which would be for
[44:27] three nights or more but thereafter the
[44:30] man could leave the wife and then
[44:33] without any obligation so she had
[44:35] offspring he was we wasn't obligated to
[44:38] her that's the kind of leadership that's
[44:41] the kind of lust that is in that
[44:43] religion so it's not genuine love like
[44:46] Jesus Christ love like Christianity so
[44:50] like Jesus said by their fruits they're
[44:52] known so Muhammad is known by his
[44:55] corrupt fruits and so here we look and
[45:02] see Islam denies the value of a genuine
[45:07] Christian or godly marriage divine love
[45:11] they reject exclusive lifelong devoted
[45:14] love and polygamy erodes the concept of
[45:17] a Christian family
[45:22] so Christianity is the only real model
[45:26] of a marriage that God wants children to
[45:28] grow up under so thank God that our
[45:32] children thank God that many of us were
[45:33] raised under a godly example a true
[45:36] example of Christ and the church one man
[45:39] and one woman now let's look at some
[45:44] sins of Rome let's look at the depravity
[45:47] of Roman culture this as few people can
[45:53] understand how highly promiscuous and
[45:55] depraved cultures were before the advent
[45:59] of Christianity a British historian
[46:02] wrote that marital faithfulness in the
[46:05] Roman Empire was virtually unknown in
[46:08] other words there were hardly any Roman
[46:11] men that even considered being faithful
[46:13] to their wives so adultery and
[46:18] fornication were completely common in
[46:20] the Roman civilization all kinds of evil
[46:26] lewd practices of speaking of course
[46:30] intimately were prevalent it was
[46:33] everywhere these evil acts were
[46:37] illustrated even in the house on lamps
[46:40] bowls cups and bases so everywhere you
[46:42] looked in a Roman home there was evil
[46:45] acts we'd say with prostitution or
[46:48] fornication or bestiality or
[46:50] homosexuality or polygamy all these kind
[46:53] of evil acts romans and greeks of course
[46:57] also exercised and bathed publicly in
[47:01] the nude it was just an awful awful
[47:04] culture to grow up in there's such
[47:11] things that went on such evil things I
[47:15] can't even read these such as by the
[47:18] emperor Titus and emperor Domitian and
[47:21] Emperor Caligula just some of the most
[47:25] awful forms of sexual sin or intimate
[47:30] sin you would ever want to read about
[47:33] even with
[47:36] even with abuses with animals and young
[47:38] children it was just common and it was
[47:41] public and it was just so wicked and
[47:43] evil the earth needed good news praise
[47:47] God the world needed Jesus Christ
[47:51] desperately desperately and thank God
[47:54] that God sent His Son praise the Lord
[47:56] because he birthed out of Christ and
[47:59] Christianity birthed a finally a holy
[48:02] lifestyle a godly lifestyle no doubt
[48:04] Jews many Jews lived a godly lifestyle
[48:07] but we're speaking of a spirit-filled
[48:09] the Jews didn't have the spirit filled
[48:11] Holy Ghost filled life that Christians
[48:13] like Paul had right like Peter had they
[48:16] didn't have this extra power in the soul
[48:19] praise God the seal of God the baptism
[48:22] of the Holy Ghost and so this was a
[48:25] great change was to see Christians who
[48:29] were born again in the middle of Rome in
[48:32] the middle of Ephesus living as Jesus
[48:34] called them to live also here's
[48:39] something else about Rome in Rome
[48:41] adultery was only on the marital status
[48:45] of the woman in other words a man could
[48:48] not be taken to court for adultery men
[48:51] just had the freedom to to lie with as
[48:55] many women as they wanted to and the
[48:57] women could never the women did not have
[48:58] the right to come to court and accuse
[49:02] their husbands of committing adultery
[49:04] adultery was only convicted upon a wife
[49:12] it was perceived as a crime only a woman
[49:15] could commit and it was not an issue
[49:19] that pertained to the man how how wicked
[49:22] and evil is that women in ancient Rome
[49:26] let's look at some of their rights they
[49:28] really had very few rights and
[49:30] privileges compared to men women Roman
[49:34] wives were not allowed to be present
[49:35] with a husband's guest at a meal so
[49:39] think about that just made me think of
[49:40] Aquila and Priscilla they're in Ephesus
[49:43] how they spoke unto Apollo slightly
[49:48] spoken to Apollo's
[49:49] about the things of God well in really
[49:52] in those type of cultures priscilla's
[49:54] should not even have been there but see
[49:56] with Christianity they gave that woman a
[49:58] little bit of freedom gave her great
[50:00] freedom to testify to Apollo so of
[50:02] course she wasn't preaching she wasn't
[50:04] teaching but Priscilla would testify
[50:06] like the woman who at the well who went
[50:08] down there in Samaria the Samaritan who
[50:12] testified and told him the great things
[50:14] Christ had done so the same thing
[50:16] Priscilla would have done by the grace
[50:18] of God a Roman woman her wife was placed
[50:24] under the absolute control of her
[50:26] husband who could divorce her sell her
[50:29] into slavery or even have her life taken
[50:32] at his own will the Roman woman was
[50:36] prohibited from inheriting property
[50:39] remember even Judaism gave the widows
[50:42] and the daughters property the Roman
[50:48] women were prohibited prohibited from
[50:50] speaking in public and they were not
[50:52] allowed to speak in court they couldn't
[50:54] be a witness in court the Roman man had
[50:58] supreme absolute power over his children
[51:01] a man could even have hid his married
[51:06] daughter put to death so a father can
[51:10] even have his married daughter put to
[51:12] death how wicked how incredibly evil was
[51:15] this culture he had full authority to
[51:17] chastise even to beat them his wife and
[51:23] his children and grandchildren there was
[51:26] nothing there was no evil that was held
[51:28] back from Roman men or we'd say Ephesian
[51:31] men but then Jesus Christ came praise
[51:39] God
[51:39] and then the Holy Ghost fell on the day
[51:41] of Pentecost hallelujah and then it
[51:43] spread to Cornelius his house and the
[51:46] rest of the Gentiles then Paul took it
[51:48] on his three missionary trips thank God
[51:50] for Paul and Barnabus being separated by
[51:53] the Holy Ghost to take the hope for
[51:56] families the hope for children and
[51:58] fathers and parenting and mothers and
[52:00] there were
[52:01] all the hope for the Christian family
[52:03] came as Paul and Barnabus took the
[52:06] gospel and spread it and it signs
[52:08] wonders and miracles to show the world
[52:10] what real love looks like craze gotta
[52:12] thank God we get to experience it today
[52:15] amen praise God so into this wicked
[52:19] environment of Roman and Ephesian
[52:22] culture comes the Christian message and
[52:24] lifestyle this was a radical
[52:27] revolutionary an extremely offensive
[52:30] lifestyle to the Ephesians where Paul
[52:33] would preach you shall not commit
[52:34] adultery yet that was what they did all
[52:37] the time
[52:38] Paul would preach marriage is honored by
[52:41] all and the marriage bed should be kept
[52:44] pure and God will judge the adulterer
[52:46] and all the sexual immoral they didn't
[52:48] want to hear it they hated it in fact
[52:50] hid Roman history says that it was very
[52:54] common just for the word Christian to be
[52:56] a hated word it was like a cuss word
[52:58] because they the Romans felt such a
[53:01] fence they felt judged right they they
[53:04] felt condemned by Christians but see it
[53:06] wasn't the Christians condemning them it
[53:08] was God's Word condemning them which it
[53:10] was meant to jesus said the Holy Ghost
[53:12] when he comes he'll convict the world of
[53:14] sin praise God so the preaching will
[53:16] always convict the sinner and so the
[53:18] sinner must repent the sinner must come
[53:21] to God humble themselves admit they're
[53:23] wrong and ask God to pardon them forgive
[53:26] them and create in them a care creating
[53:29] them a desire to serve God Paul would
[53:34] preach as he did here in Ephesians 5:21
[53:36] submit to one another out of reverence
[53:38] for Christ Paul Peter would say be
[53:42] considerate and live with your wive's
[53:44] and treat them with respect in first
[53:46] Peter 3:7 and this was unheard of this
[53:49] was just it was so countercultural and
[53:54] no doubt it caused much persecution upon
[53:57] the Christians but as we know the more
[54:00] persecution came upon the Christians the
[54:02] more spread hallelujah thank God so
[54:09] Christian
[54:11] insisted that intimacy be confined to
[54:16] marriage and that made Ephesians of
[54:18] Senate Paul priests and have made the
[54:20] Ephesians very upset the sinners of
[54:22] course and they believe that the
[54:25] intimacy act made a man and woman one
[54:28] flesh and they were supposed to stay
[54:30] united together for life well that was
[54:32] unheard of as well but Paul used that
[54:34] same language from Genesis about how
[54:36] they should be one flesh they're not
[54:39] they're no longer two they should not be
[54:41] and I should not share intimacy with
[54:43] anyone else
[54:44] just that one individual the one spouse
[54:48] very radical concept so Christianity
[55:00] here's hit one is one historian said
[55:03] this the dignity of marriage was
[55:05] restored by the Christians oh thank God
[55:08] the dignity of Adam and Eve praise God
[55:10] the dignity of Isaac and Rebecca praise
[55:13] God of Jacob and Rachel Jacob Leah
[55:16] Abraham and Sarah the dignity of those
[55:18] marriages was brought back through the
[55:21] cross of Jesus Christ and the the
[55:23] filling of the baptism of the holy ghost
[55:25] praise God
[55:27] history even says this prior to
[55:32] Christianity the marriage ceremonies
[55:34] were anything but dignified so imagine
[55:37] going to a wedding now most of us we can
[55:39] sense how sacred and how special wedding
[55:42] is but it wasn't like that in Ephesus
[55:44] and Rome it was more of like a playful
[55:47] kind of like a bar event or like a a
[55:49] theatre event history says because of
[55:54] the low regard of women and marriage as
[55:57] a whole wedding ceremonies contained
[56:01] obscene songs they would have songs with
[56:03] cuss words and and mockery and open
[56:06] displays of extreme wickedness and they
[56:11] were all part of Roman weddings so it
[56:14] was just like a how like a stand-up
[56:17] comedian would be kinda be like a
[56:19] wedding ceremony can you imagine
[56:20] and the more lewd the more of the Roman
[56:23] men and a fee
[56:23] men liked it their wedding ceremony of
[56:27] course I doubt they had any vows at the
[56:29] ceremony because they obviously would
[56:31] never keep them so it was like an evil
[56:34] stand-up comedy like a late-night show
[56:37] or some evil thing like that mockery and
[56:41] and evil songs that was the wedding
[56:44] ceremony but when Paul started doing
[56:46] Christian weddings then Christianity the
[56:49] Christian wedding ceremony became to be
[56:52] a very dignified beautiful solemn holy
[56:56] sacred ceremony like it is today for
[56:59] Holy Ghost field Christians praise God
[57:01] and they had never seen this before
[57:03] can you imagine sinners you know being
[57:06] invited to a wedding Paul or Timothy
[57:08] would perform in Ephesus or Apollo's and
[57:10] would be so sacred and the man would
[57:13] look into his wife's eyes and she look
[57:15] into his and they'd hold hands and they
[57:17] would make promises and the sinners
[57:20] would hear these promise and said how
[57:21] could this what do you mean this man's
[57:23] gonna do this and what do you mean he's
[57:24] gonna love his wife and be faithful to
[57:26] her how is that possible are they joking
[57:30] what a fool think they'd say so they
[57:33] came to hate that the sinners came to
[57:36] hate the Christians now if you'd like a
[57:39] link on that I'd be happy to share that
[57:41] with you that kind of concludes the
[57:44] historical part now hopefully church
[57:47] hopefully that opens our eyes to the
[57:49] power of this passage because the way we
[57:52] raised we're raising them in a society
[57:54] where women already have a lot of
[57:56] freedom but that's not the society that
[57:59] Paul was writing here when he wrote this
[58:01] letter to the Ephesians he's writing to
[58:04] a society where women hardly had any
[58:06] dignity hardly had any rights and men
[58:09] were allowed to be brute beasts but
[58:12] today thank God we're not men aren't
[58:15] beasts men are examples of Christianity
[58:18] men put on the the Bible says on
[58:22] the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[58:23] men put on the Spirit of Christ and live
[58:26] like a man should live praise God
[58:28] [Music]
[58:32] now I preached you know
[58:35] I think I preached six or seven Mayor's
[58:36] banquet so I'm not going to get in the
[58:38] coats of brother branham on marriage
[58:40] most of you are familiar with them I
[58:41] preach them many times but if you'd like
[58:43] them I'm happy to give you them I could
[58:46] mail them to you or email them rather
[58:49] well brother I am one thing I just want
[58:51] to say brother am said always keep the
[58:53] honeymoon
[58:54] always make sure brothers your wife
[58:56] remains your sweetheart and sisters that
[59:00] your husband remains your gallant
[59:01] boyfriend your virtuous strong boyfriend
[59:05] right and of course this is easier said
[59:08] than done
[59:08] Satan's first attack on humanity was in
[59:12] their home the Garden of Eden against a
[59:15] family Adam and Eve and then of course
[59:18] we know akin sin in his home stop the
[59:21] invincible army of Joshua and so it is
[59:24] today the reason we don't see more
[59:26] miracles the reason we don't see people
[59:28] finding their gifts of the Spirit the
[59:30] reason we don't see more of that is
[59:32] because sin is committed in believers
[59:35] homes and they failed to get victory
[59:37] over that and they come to church under
[59:40] the wrong spirit and so the holy spirit
[59:42] can get a full preeminence over the
[59:44] entire flock of course there's times
[59:47] where the holy spirit can get victory in
[59:49] different areas and we'll see miracles
[59:51] and healings and we'll see discernment
[59:54] and we'll get words from the Lord thank
[59:55] God for those times but the Christian
[59:58] army really is the body of Christ really
[1:00:00] is invincible
[1:00:01] the only thing that can take her is God
[1:00:03] allowing her to die and then she goes
[1:00:05] home to get her reward praise God
[1:00:07] eternal life when the Christian army has
[1:00:10] always been invincible Paul would say Oh
[1:00:12] death where is your sting
[1:00:13] Oh fear where is it Oh grave where is
[1:00:16] your victory but thanks be to God who
[1:00:18] gives us our victory through the Lord
[1:00:19] Jesus Christ Paul knew he was invincible
[1:00:22] right as far as God was going to help
[1:00:25] him overcome he was an overcomer
[1:00:26] he said grace is what is causing me to
[1:00:30] labor more not i but the grace of god
[1:00:32] that's in me and that's with me and so
[1:00:37] you know we know the quotes our brother
[1:00:39] Graham said every morning his family
[1:00:41] prayed first before they had breakfast
[1:00:43] he said they would kneel down and pray
[1:00:45] but then brother Ram
[1:00:47] especially in 1964 questions and answers
[1:00:50] series brother branham gives us a real
[1:00:52] look into the into his house how he had
[1:00:55] numerous teenagers and I just saw him
[1:00:58] quote before service program said Nita
[1:01:00] and I constantly fuss at Rebecca and
[1:01:03] Sarah to wear modest clothes just to
[1:01:06] wear modest clothes he said they were
[1:01:07] constantly fussing so they must have
[1:01:09] been coming in through their friends not
[1:01:11] sure how they got in there but he said
[1:01:13] there was constant fusses and we
[1:01:15] remember how Rebecca slammed the door
[1:01:17] and program said that was the devil and
[1:01:20] so there's a lot of tests and trials in
[1:01:23] homes and so brother Graham's home
[1:01:26] wasn't immune from it he had to keep
[1:01:28] applying the token right had to keep
[1:01:29] praying for his wife and and praying for
[1:01:31] the the teenagers and praying for his
[1:01:34] entire family and so we know we can we
[1:01:37] can get the victory but just like any
[1:01:40] promise footsteps our possession we got
[1:01:42] to take one day at a time
[1:01:43] we gotta rip the lead especially our
[1:01:46] brothers we have to lead by example one
[1:01:48] day at a time and let the love of Christ
[1:01:51] flow through us into our family and
[1:01:53] invite the prends of Jesus Christ in
[1:01:55] order to cleanse us first and then
[1:01:58] cleanse everyone in our home and in our
[1:02:00] families now let's see if we can let's
[1:02:05] now get to the text here it's 8 o'clock
[1:02:08] ok I try to go about 1/2 hour more by
[1:02:11] God's grace I appreciate everybody's
[1:02:14] attention crazy so hopefully it's been a
[1:02:16] blessing so far to see the history and
[1:02:18] to see now what a radical
[1:02:20] dr. and Paul was preaching many times we
[1:02:23] take it for granted but we can't let
[1:02:25] these things be taken for granted and
[1:02:29] anyone that served the Lord long enough
[1:02:30] knows that in our flesh we're gonna fail
[1:02:33] we're gonna fall short that's why Paul
[1:02:35] said renew your mind daily every day you
[1:02:38] got have to have a transformed mind as
[1:02:40] we get older we oftentimes get weaker
[1:02:42] right the spirits willing but the flesh
[1:02:44] is weak we get weaker so anyone that's
[1:02:46] been serving the Lord a long time or any
[1:02:49] amount of time realizes they got to
[1:02:50] fight their flesh to get the revival
[1:02:53] back they have to die to their will
[1:02:55] daily that the will of God might be done
[1:03:01] now in verse 22 Ephesians 5:22 is where
[1:03:07] we want to start now it's interesting
[1:03:12] here
[1:03:13] he says wives submit yourselves unto
[1:03:15] your own husband's as unto the Lord now
[1:03:19] this would not have been asking a whole
[1:03:21] lot right because women couldn't say
[1:03:23] anything in public women could even meet
[1:03:25] with the guests at the dinner table so
[1:03:28] this was familiar to Middle Eastern
[1:03:31] women submission but Paul says in anyway
[1:03:34] it's interesting he starts with the
[1:03:36] woman I'm not sure why but it's brash
[1:03:39] because Eve was first deceived so maybe
[1:03:42] that's why Paul wrote about that in
[1:03:44] first Timothy 2 verses 12 to 14 he said
[1:03:47] Adam was first formed then Eve and Adam
[1:03:51] was not deceived but the woman being
[1:03:52] deceived was in the transgression so for
[1:03:56] some reason Paul is led by the Holy
[1:03:57] Spirit to write to the sisters first he
[1:04:00] tells them to submit to their own
[1:04:03] husband's as unto the Lord now again
[1:04:09] it's important to note he's saying
[1:04:11] married sisters submit to your own
[1:04:14] husband's right there's a great
[1:04:17] temptation for sisters and of course
[1:04:20] brothers too but in this case we'll look
[1:04:23] at the sisters because that's what the
[1:04:24] scripture says there's a temptation for
[1:04:27] sisters too long to be with someone else
[1:04:30] right Satan will inject those thoughts
[1:04:34] and it's not something we enjoy
[1:04:36] but Satan injects those thoughts the
[1:04:39] grass always looks greener on the other
[1:04:40] side and the natural Satan wants us to
[1:04:43] look at a better car better house and
[1:04:45] it's natural times where Satan will
[1:04:47] inject a thought well if you're only
[1:04:49] married to that person it'd be so much
[1:04:51] better
[1:04:52] but Paul tells us the Holy Spirit in our
[1:04:55] sisters lives will teach us to submit to
[1:04:58] our own husbands for the sisters now
[1:05:03] because the Bible said what God has
[1:05:06] joined together let not man put asunder
[1:05:08] sisters we must go back in our minds and
[1:05:11] remember the happy day we got married
[1:05:14] the happy day you got married you stared
[1:05:15] in that man's eyes and were so thankful
[1:05:17] remember that that special feeling you
[1:05:20] felt when he proposed to you and when
[1:05:22] you were married and how thankful you
[1:05:24] were for your wedding day
[1:05:26] I trust by God's grace that's how you
[1:05:28] felt because most sisters in America
[1:05:32] weren't forced to be married they had
[1:05:34] the choice right and so we must remember
[1:05:37] that you believed at one point and you
[1:05:39] should always believe that that God
[1:05:41] joined your marriage together and that
[1:05:45] God doesn't want it put asunder and so
[1:05:48] you must here by the Holy Spirit by the
[1:05:51] love of God learn to submit to your own
[1:05:54] husband's as unto the Lord so we know it
[1:05:57] flows through the Lord so if a sister is
[1:06:00] submitting to God she will also submit
[1:06:02] to her husband of course as long as the
[1:06:05] husband is asking her to do godly things
[1:06:07] she doesn't have to submit to a sin so
[1:06:11] see a a sister then she's committing to
[1:06:16] keeping her vow to God and all the
[1:06:19] wedding witnesses from her wedding day
[1:06:22] she's committed to that she submits as
[1:06:25] unto the Lord for submission to God's
[1:06:27] man her husband shows her submission to
[1:06:31] her Lord and Jesus Christ modeled the
[1:06:35] submission when Christ only did that
[1:06:39] which pleased the father so even Christ
[1:06:42] had said had headship as first from the
[1:06:45] ends 11 taught that God is the head over
[1:06:47] Christ right the invisible spirit is
[1:06:50] head over the body of Christ
[1:06:52] and then the man is the head over the
[1:06:54] woman as Christ is the head over the man
[1:06:57] well let's read of Philippians 2:5
[1:07:01] through 8 real quick we get a good
[1:07:03] picture of Jesus's submission let this
[1:07:09] mind be in you which was also in Christ
[1:07:12] Jesus who being in the form of God the
[1:07:15] amour faith God the image of God thought
[1:07:18] it not robbery to be equal with God now
[1:07:21] the part that was equal was the Holy
[1:07:23] Ghost inside of him but Jesus's flesh
[1:07:25] was not equal with God right
[1:07:27] because Jesus flesh could die but God
[1:07:29] the Father could never die so we have to
[1:07:32] be careful we apply the scripture you
[1:07:36] know I've sadly I've heard the false
[1:07:38] doctrine of people using the scripture
[1:07:40] to say that that we're so equal with God
[1:07:43] that we are the ones who wrote the book
[1:07:45] of life now I say that in respect and
[1:07:47] reverence but I just disagree the
[1:07:49] scripture that's not what the scripture
[1:07:50] is saying the scripture is saying we
[1:07:52] take the mind of Christ he knew he was
[1:07:56] the image of God and there was a part of
[1:07:58] him that was equal to God the Holy
[1:08:00] Spirit inside of him right just like we
[1:08:03] know when we speak God's Word it's the
[1:08:06] same as God speaking because it is God
[1:08:08] speaking that part of us when we speak
[1:08:11] God's Word
[1:08:11] now it doesn't happen very much right it
[1:08:13] doesn't happen all the time but the
[1:08:15] times that we speak supernatural things
[1:08:17] and it happens that part the spoke was
[1:08:20] equal with God because it was God it
[1:08:23] wasn't us because we have no power to
[1:08:24] bring anything to pass so let's balance
[1:08:27] that scripture Jesus the the Spirit of
[1:08:31] God in Jesus was equal with God remember
[1:08:34] even Jesus is human mind he didn't know
[1:08:36] the day in the hour when he'd return he
[1:08:38] didn't know that Jesus didn't know who
[1:08:40] would touch him or that woman that touch
[1:08:42] him with the blood issue he didn't know
[1:08:43] so see that part of Jesus wasn't equal
[1:08:46] with God it had a word nature sinless
[1:08:49] nature but it wasn't eternal the flesh
[1:08:52] was eternal but now the flesh is eternal
[1:08:54] so it's different now but when Jesus was
[1:08:58] on earth it was different the flesh
[1:09:00] wasn't eternal it was mortal flesh right
[1:09:03] it was in the likeness of sinful flesh
[1:09:06] right but it wasn't sinful all right
[1:09:09] verse 7 but he made himself of no
[1:09:12] reputation god help us to do this that
[1:09:16] we don't try to make our own reputation
[1:09:19] now here's here's how we make we make
[1:09:21] our reputation we let our actions speak
[1:09:24] louder than our words we don't have that
[1:09:26] we don't have to tell people right away
[1:09:28] that we're a Christian we don't have to
[1:09:30] tell people right away that we believe
[1:09:31] the message of the hour we don't have to
[1:09:33] tell people right away that we believe
[1:09:35] william branham was a prophet we want
[1:09:37] people to see that we know jesus christ
[1:09:39] that our soul
[1:09:41] our seal with Jesus Christ spirit just
[1:09:44] by our life that we live
[1:09:46] praise God and then you get a reputation
[1:09:50] that way people will know that Haven
[1:09:53] Smith loves the Lord people will know
[1:09:56] that Karras and Lydia and Malachi Smith
[1:09:58] love the Lord because they didn't make
[1:10:02] their own reputation but their actions
[1:10:04] and their words and their love and their
[1:10:07] submission to others and the power of
[1:10:10] God in their life made their own
[1:10:11] reputation praise God he made himself of
[1:10:16] no reputation remember jesus said I
[1:10:19] don't take the witness of man he said I
[1:10:20] let God witness for me amen and took
[1:10:24] upon in the form of a servant so he was
[1:10:27] in the form of God and when he's in the
[1:10:29] form of God he became a servant like we
[1:10:31] said last week and was made in the
[1:10:33] likeness of men so if we should be
[1:10:36] anything we should be servants so our
[1:10:38] sisters we need to serve our children
[1:10:40] sisters we need to serve our husbands
[1:10:42] right
[1:10:43] brothers we need to serve our wives
[1:10:45] we'll get to that Lord winning in a few
[1:10:46] minutes here that's very rare for a
[1:10:49] husband to serve his wife other than
[1:10:52] just going to work right and making a
[1:10:54] paycheck and maybe driving the family
[1:10:57] vehicle there's there's more to a man
[1:11:00] serving than just that mercy and being
[1:11:05] found in the fashion as a man he humbled
[1:11:08] himself and became obedient unto death
[1:11:11] even the death of his cross so Jesus's
[1:11:15] service made him a servant and he served
[1:11:20] God's purpose for his life not his own
[1:11:22] he had rights to do other things hid
[1:11:24] rights as a man but he he forsook those
[1:11:27] rights in order to save us in order to
[1:11:30] make our lives worth living and we'll
[1:11:33] get to that that's what a man should do
[1:11:34] he should serve his family to make his
[1:11:37] wife's life better and his children's
[1:11:40] life better and doing that then he
[1:11:42] accomplishes God's will for his life as
[1:11:45] a servant so that's a great example on
[1:11:52] Christ modeled submission he obeyed what
[1:11:56] the father said he served us and he met
[1:11:59] our needs before he met his own desires
[1:12:02] because he didn't want to die that way
[1:12:04] he didn't want to go to the cross you
[1:12:05] don't have to do that but he humbled
[1:12:06] himself and took the pain of the cross
[1:12:09] in order to lift us up praise God
[1:12:12] amen okay that's Ephesians 5:22 and 23
[1:12:22] for the husband is the head of the wife
[1:12:24] even as Christ is the head of the church
[1:12:27] he's the savior of the body so our
[1:12:31] sisters remember that God give you that
[1:12:33] man to lead you and your family verse 24
[1:12:38] therefore as Christ
[1:12:40] I'm sure therefore as the church is
[1:12:42] subject unto Christ so let the wives be
[1:12:46] to their own husband's in everything so
[1:12:49] as long as the husband's asking you do
[1:12:51] something within your power that's right
[1:12:53] in godly our sisters must obey that and
[1:12:57] I'll say like this as long as God's Word
[1:12:59] through the fivefold ministry ask every
[1:13:02] member of Bride of Christ fellowship to
[1:13:04] obey God's Word they should do it if not
[1:13:07] they're being dishonorable right they're
[1:13:10] being disobedient if the Word of God has
[1:13:13] preached to us we can't forget it like
[1:13:15] James 1 says we can't deceive our own
[1:13:17] selves and forget what the God the Word
[1:13:19] of God was preached and what was said
[1:13:21] through the preacher if we do that we're
[1:13:23] being we're being a disrespectful wife
[1:13:26] to Christ we must obey the word and
[1:13:29] everything and how do you do that
[1:13:31] through love love keeps all the
[1:13:33] commandments all God's lost within in
[1:13:36] one word love praise God and love of
[1:13:39] course flows from the soul right because
[1:13:41] you have the love of God shut in your
[1:13:43] hearts right by the Holy Ghost amen
[1:13:46] so when we live from our souls and we
[1:13:49] bring our minds as an subjection to our
[1:13:51] souls then we can love God God the right
[1:13:53] way then we can't obey the Word of God
[1:13:55] then we will keep God's commandments
[1:13:57] amen so just because we're not married
[1:14:01] or don't have children doesn't mean
[1:14:02] these things don't apply to us
[1:14:04] they certainly do apply to us in
[1:14:06] everything the Bible said be subject and
[1:14:09] obey in everything verse 25 now we get
[1:14:14] to our our men our leaders who should be
[1:14:16] godly leaders verse 25
[1:14:19] I remember the men in the Roman and
[1:14:24] Ephesians society they had little to no
[1:14:27] duties to their wives they didn't have
[1:14:31] to be true to them they didn't have to
[1:14:33] treat them nice they could disrespect
[1:14:34] them hit them speak any way they want
[1:14:37] but now Paul is anointed by the Holy
[1:14:40] Spirit to turn their society upside down
[1:14:43] and there's a very small flock that
[1:14:45] received a praise God remember within I
[1:14:47] think 160 years or 260 years the whole
[1:14:51] city was wiped out because they didn't
[1:14:53] the the whole city didn't repent so God
[1:14:56] took the can away from Ephesus and the
[1:14:58] city was destroyed but no doubt there
[1:15:00] was a few Holy Ghost filled curse in the
[1:15:02] least well praise God they had the
[1:15:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost that lived the
[1:15:07] right kind of life so verse 25 husbands
[1:15:13] love your wives even as Christ also
[1:15:15] loved the church and gave himself for
[1:15:19] saints this was earth-shattering kind of
[1:15:22] like today it's earth-shattering when a
[1:15:25] husband may be asked to maybe sweep
[1:15:31] sweep with the sweeper dear hubby could
[1:15:34] you sweep with the sweeper or as a
[1:15:37] pastor all brothers could you help out
[1:15:39] at home and help your help sweep the
[1:15:41] floor for your wives if you got a chance
[1:15:43] brothers could you help with some
[1:15:44] laundry brothers from the pastor could
[1:15:47] you help with the dishes at home could
[1:15:49] you help change the diaper brothers so
[1:15:53] for some brothers it's earth-shattering
[1:15:54] how do I know because I've talked to
[1:15:56] some about that they've never changed a
[1:15:58] diaper
[1:15:58] they've never helped with dishes they've
[1:16:00] never helped clean up and so some of
[1:16:03] these some of these ways to show love
[1:16:07] may be earth-shattering to some brothers
[1:16:12] remember Jesus Christ said this the
[1:16:14] greatest among you is the servant
[1:16:17] the one who can submit themselves am i
[1:16:20] submitting yourself you make others
[1:16:22] needs more important and you lift up
[1:16:24] others you help them and as we said not
[1:16:27] not just by going to to work and making
[1:16:30] a paycheck sinners can do that any
[1:16:33] sinner man can go I know lots of sinners
[1:16:36] from my childhood that men that went to
[1:16:38] work and paid bills or Catholic
[1:16:41] Methodist Presbyterian you have treat
[1:16:42] their wives awful any sinner can go to
[1:16:44] work and do that but brothers we got to
[1:16:47] find a greater way to love our wives we
[1:16:51] have to find more ways to do it so Paul
[1:16:58] says the way to do this is to give
[1:17:01] yourself for your wife so give your free
[1:17:05] time up to help out your wife to show
[1:17:08] love to your wife now church we're not
[1:17:13] in a competition to be the greatest
[1:17:15] Christian but I also want to say this we
[1:17:18] don't want to be the least I don't want
[1:17:21] to be the if I don't want to be the
[1:17:23] least I don't want there to be a
[1:17:25] question of people are questioning my
[1:17:26] devotion or questioning my love I don't
[1:17:28] want my wife to question my love for her
[1:17:30] I don't want my children to question my
[1:17:32] love for them I don't want to be the
[1:17:34] least father or the least faithful
[1:17:36] husband or the least loving husband I
[1:17:38] want to be the best I can be by God's
[1:17:40] grace so while we're not competing we
[1:17:44] also know Paul says lay aside sin and
[1:17:47] run the race the best you can praise God
[1:17:49] like you're the only one that could be a
[1:17:51] real loving husband like you'd be the
[1:17:53] only one that could be a real loving
[1:17:55] father love is the highest Act and Jesus
[1:18:01] of love of course is the highest
[1:18:02] greatest act of love love gives itself
[1:18:05] away love gives of its free time love
[1:18:08] gives up its energy when it feels like
[1:18:10] it doesn't have any we know first
[1:18:12] Corinthians 13 lists 16 attributes of
[1:18:14] love it suffers long thinks no evil and
[1:18:17] all the other attributes now why does
[1:18:22] Jesus love us like this verse 26 and he
[1:18:25] might sanctify and cleanse it with the
[1:18:27] washing of water by the word
[1:18:31] so see Christ help cleanse the church so
[1:18:34] the husband must help his wife live
[1:18:37] closer to God by loving her and not just
[1:18:41] physical love that won't that won't do
[1:18:43] it it takes more than that and he does
[1:18:47] it by sanctifying himself so the only
[1:18:50] way a husband is really going to love
[1:18:52] his wife is first get the Friends of
[1:18:54] Jesus Christ and gets sanctified because
[1:18:57] jesus said in john 17 19 he said he said
[1:19:01] the way I'm gonna sanctify my disciples
[1:19:03] is by sanctifying myself that's why that
[1:19:06] morning routine video I just put out was
[1:19:08] so important for all Christians I
[1:19:09] believe wise version Christians now
[1:19:12] because first you got to get yourself
[1:19:15] sanctified by Jesus Christ and then
[1:19:17] you'll be so full of love that you'll be
[1:19:20] able to help sanctify and cleanse your
[1:19:22] family and the way you do that is by
[1:19:24] loving them with the love of Christ let
[1:19:28] me just say a few things that I do
[1:19:30] brothers and I'm gonna challenge you to
[1:19:32] do it for my wife so for my wife I try
[1:19:35] to get up early in the morning so I get
[1:19:37] all my study time done in the morning
[1:19:39] and so that way when I get home from
[1:19:42] work I can help wash dishes I can take
[1:19:44] the baby I can somehow give my wife some
[1:19:47] help I'll fix the sweeper I was gonna
[1:19:49] you know we have such long hair again I
[1:19:52] gotta clean the sweeper roller out at
[1:19:54] least once a week
[1:19:55] so I do that job I'll take out the trash
[1:19:57] I'll do all kinds of different jobs to
[1:20:00] try to help out my wife also once a week
[1:20:02] I'll take her out on a two-hour date and
[1:20:05] our older children of course on the
[1:20:07] babysitter's I give her that time away
[1:20:09] with with her and I just the talk
[1:20:11] reconnect talk about things that we need
[1:20:13] to talk about and then every Saturday
[1:20:16] even during the school year when I'm
[1:20:17] working I trying to take my children on
[1:20:19] a daddy date for three sometimes four
[1:20:21] sometimes five or more hours just to
[1:20:25] give her peace and quiet where she can
[1:20:27] do what she needs to do and then that
[1:20:31] time she gets to of course hear sermons
[1:20:32] do her her work and do the things that
[1:20:35] she needs to do sometimes take a nap so
[1:20:38] of course there's other things that I do
[1:20:41] but these are just some simple examples
[1:20:44] of ways I can
[1:20:45] give myself so if I can sanctify myself
[1:20:49] and live close to God in the morning
[1:20:50] then I can devote the rest of the time
[1:20:52] in the evening to try to help my wife
[1:20:55] and my children get closer to God
[1:20:58] remember Jesus gave himself because he
[1:21:02] loved
[1:21:02] that's Galatians 2:20 I am crucified
[1:21:06] with Christ nevertheless I live not yet
[1:21:09] i but Christ liveth in me and the life
[1:21:11] which I now live in the flesh I live by
[1:21:14] the faith of the Son of God who loved me
[1:21:16] and gave himself for me praise God
[1:21:20] so brothers what I'm saying is that if
[1:21:22] we really love Christ will give our free
[1:21:26] time a way to help our lives to help our
[1:21:29] children so because Christ loved he gave
[1:21:34] and brothers because we love our wives
[1:21:36] will give of our time will give more of
[1:21:39] our energy to lift her up to raise her
[1:21:42] up to help show her love in ways she may
[1:21:45] have not felt it very much before seeing
[1:21:51] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[1:21:53] with the washing of water by the word so
[1:21:57] Christ washes his bride with his word so
[1:22:00] so does a man when he pours out real
[1:22:03] divine love upon his wife sacrificial
[1:22:05] love and he sacrifices his own self for
[1:22:09] his wife it's like pouring the waters of
[1:22:12] God's Word upon her and it washes her
[1:22:14] and it refreshes her when he serves his
[1:22:18] wife verse 27 that he might present it
[1:22:22] to himself a glorious church not having
[1:22:24] spot or wrinkle or any such thing that
[1:22:28] should be holy and without blemish verse
[1:22:33] 28 so ought men to love their wives as
[1:22:36] their own bodies he that loveth his wife
[1:22:39] loveth himself
[1:22:42] verse 29 for no man ever yet hated his
[1:22:46] own flesh but nourishes and cherishes it
[1:22:49] even as the Lord the church might a lot
[1:22:54] of brothers that you know they treat
[1:22:55] their flesh real good know they'll take
[1:22:58] their flesh out too
[1:22:59] every day that's spending a lot of extra
[1:23:02] money right they'll go out to eat every
[1:23:03] day just because this I work hard I'm
[1:23:07] gonna treat myself well but really it's
[1:23:10] healthier to you know pack a lunch right
[1:23:12] unless you unless you really choose to
[1:23:13] eat healthy foods are healthy
[1:23:15] restaurants but see men will buy
[1:23:17] themselves the best boots because
[1:23:19] they're standing on their feet all day
[1:23:20] by themselves the warmest jackets
[1:23:22] because they're out there working in the
[1:23:25] cold weather the best tools will spend
[1:23:28] all this money and do so though so sleep
[1:23:30] extra right well just like they treat
[1:23:34] themselves and take care of their own
[1:23:36] selves they should apply that same love
[1:23:38] to their wives and see how they could
[1:23:40] love their wives better to give her the
[1:23:43] best they can give her so the best of
[1:23:46] their attention the best of their their
[1:23:48] service and of course you have the best
[1:23:50] of the food and the best of the clothes
[1:23:52] and the best they can do any man that
[1:23:55] really loves God will try to do that for
[1:23:58] his wife and his children because he
[1:24:00] loves his wife and children as Christ
[1:24:03] loves the church
[1:24:07] verse 29 for no man ever yet hated his
[1:24:10] own flesh but nourishes it and cherishes
[1:24:13] it even as the Lord the church verse 30
[1:24:17] we were members of his body of his flesh
[1:24:19] and of his bones see Paul gives two
[1:24:24] symbols for how men should love their
[1:24:25] wives as Christ loved the church and as
[1:24:28] his own body so it's not very hard for a
[1:24:32] man to figure out how how should I love
[1:24:33] my wife look at how Christ loved his
[1:24:36] disciples loved the church and the Holy
[1:24:38] Ghost all these things but then also
[1:24:40] watch how a man treats his body really
[1:24:43] well so then he should know that because
[1:24:45] he knows how he treats his own body
[1:24:47] watch the receipts see how you spend
[1:24:49] your money on yourself right so a man
[1:24:52] has two very easy references to look at
[1:24:55] how I'm supposed to love my wife
[1:24:57] Christ loving the church and how I love
[1:25:00] my own body so how many husbands live in
[1:25:04] a way to make life better for their
[1:25:06] wives and I'm just not talking about not
[1:25:08] just financially but in helping with the
[1:25:12] children
[1:25:12] and helping take off the pressure right
[1:25:14] and helping with the home chores we all
[1:25:17] know the story brother branham putting
[1:25:19] on an apron to help out his wife when
[1:25:20] the children were crying not sure how
[1:25:22] many times he did that that's a great
[1:25:24] example of him submitting himself see he
[1:25:27] took on a role that didn't belong to him
[1:25:28] dishwashing wasn't under the man's job
[1:25:32] description right but yet brother
[1:25:34] branham humbled himself at least at one
[1:25:36] time and he put on the apron and he
[1:25:39] washed dishes and so that's where we'll
[1:25:41] see Christian men act today they'll take
[1:25:44] upon a role that nothing necessarily
[1:25:46] doesn't belong to them but they'll
[1:25:49] humble themselves in order to serve
[1:25:50] their wives and serve their children and
[1:25:53] that's loving their families as Christ
[1:25:57] loved the church why do we do this why
[1:26:02] brothers do you do this because your
[1:26:04] wife is part of you that's what verse 30
[1:26:06] says we're members of the christ body as
[1:26:09] flesh and bones right just as Eve was a
[1:26:11] part of Adam brothers we got a look at
[1:26:13] our wives that way she is a part of me
[1:26:16] how could I mistreat my own body how
[1:26:18] could I mistreat my own reign but it
[1:26:21] would be evil for me to do that
[1:26:22] and so we have to look in ourselves and
[1:26:24] our wives and our children in that very
[1:26:26] same way verse 31 Paul gives his
[1:26:31] authority for this teaching for this
[1:26:33] cause shall a man leave his wife and
[1:26:35] mother and shall be joined unto his wife
[1:26:37] and they too shall be one flesh
[1:26:40] now the word joined here is beautiful as
[1:26:42] the same meaning as the Hebrew word
[1:26:45] cleave in I believe us Genesis chapter 1
[1:26:50] joy means to glue upon it means to join
[1:26:55] oneself too closely to cleave to or to
[1:26:59] stick to so brothers that's how our
[1:27:03] that's how our lives are supposed to
[1:27:05] look we're supposed to be so attached to
[1:27:07] our wives that is we're like glued to
[1:27:09] them right we're so dedicated to our
[1:27:12] families that we're like glued to our
[1:27:14] families think about how powerful glue
[1:27:17] is I was telling my families I have a
[1:27:19] gold crown on my first molar on the
[1:27:23] bottom right-hand side I got this crowd
[1:27:26] it's a beautiful golden crown because I
[1:27:29] had such a awful cavity at a top almost
[1:27:33] half of my first molar and when they
[1:27:36] place this crown on there they put
[1:27:37] cement on there and that cement has held
[1:27:40] through 20 years of chewing I've chewed
[1:27:43] a lot of hard things right like almonds
[1:27:45] and all kinds of things all kinds of
[1:27:48] crazy candies well yet that cement that
[1:27:51] glue has held if the glues never let up
[1:27:55] and failed to attach to the bottom part
[1:27:59] of my tooth and brothers what a great
[1:28:03] lesson that is for us if natural cement
[1:28:05] can stay that attached to a molar to a
[1:28:09] gold crown what about the gold in your
[1:28:12] heart the time-tested faith right the
[1:28:15] gold a time-tested character praise God
[1:28:17] how much more should that faith be
[1:28:21] connect our our lives brothers our
[1:28:24] desires to serve our wives and how we
[1:28:26] should care and love for them we are our
[1:28:29] love should be glued upon them right it
[1:28:32] should be connected to them how can I
[1:28:34] help my wife how can I serve my wife a
[1:28:36] lot of people want to know how can I get
[1:28:38] closer to Christ what can I do for the
[1:28:40] Lord brothers serve your wives that's
[1:28:43] find a way to help her out praise God
[1:28:45] find a way to help your children that's
[1:28:48] a way you can serve Jesus Christ praise
[1:28:51] God by doing that you may find your gift
[1:28:53] of the spirit might be wisdom might be
[1:28:55] prayer might be healing right you might
[1:28:57] find it as you serve your family and I
[1:29:03] want mine just for the record I want my
[1:29:05] gold crown to stay there
[1:29:06] I want that glue to stick raise God and
[1:29:10] that's what God wants God wants our
[1:29:11] commitment brothers to stick to our
[1:29:14] wives not to somebody else's wife not to
[1:29:16] somebody else's children but to our
[1:29:18] wives and our children that's real love
[1:29:20] and then Paul says in verse 32 this is a
[1:29:23] great mystery but I speak concerning
[1:29:25] Christ and the church now this word
[1:29:28] mystery in the Greek means it's only to
[1:29:33] the initiated and not to ordinary
[1:29:39] mortals it says
[1:29:40] so this mystery of how a man should give
[1:29:44] himself to help out his wife it's not
[1:29:46] revealed to average mortals it's to a
[1:29:48] special class right like Jesus said
[1:29:50] these mysteries they're not given to
[1:29:52] them I said they're given unto you unto
[1:29:55] you the mysteries of God have been made
[1:29:57] known praise God so there are they're
[1:30:00] given to a special class of people
[1:30:02] the foreknown right the predestinated
[1:30:06] the elected and how do you know it
[1:30:08] Paul said make your calling election
[1:30:10] sure praise God if you're so elected if
[1:30:13] you're so predestinated then live it
[1:30:14] brothers serve your wives serve your
[1:30:17] children it's a great mystery it's not
[1:30:24] obvious to the understanding this was a
[1:30:26] huge mystery to the Ephesians right this
[1:30:29] was huge mystery to the Romans what do
[1:30:31] you mean they would say well I have a
[1:30:33] line I have an impulse for intimacy I'll
[1:30:34] just go to the prostitute I've got to
[1:30:36] satisfy that impulse and Paul saying no
[1:30:38] the power of the crowd the power of the
[1:30:40] Cross will make you die to that because
[1:30:43] that's that's that's lust that's a
[1:30:45] perversion but the Holy Spirit will give
[1:30:47] you real love to be devoted to your your
[1:30:50] wife and cast down that passion cast
[1:30:52] down that temptation because our weapons
[1:30:55] are mighty through the pulling down of
[1:30:56] those strongholds praise God amen thank
[1:31:00] the Lord so see it was a great thing it
[1:31:06] wasn't obvious to these Ephesians I'll
[1:31:07] say this it's not obvious to very many
[1:31:10] message men so-called message men it's
[1:31:13] not very obvious to them because they
[1:31:15] don't even know when they get home they
[1:31:16] don't even know how to serve their
[1:31:17] families they think it's all this is my
[1:31:19] time or this is my your time should be
[1:31:22] wrapped up and being glued to your wife
[1:31:24] being glued to your children helping
[1:31:26] them out the best you can by God's grace
[1:31:29] praise God it's a great mystery but it's
[1:31:32] concerning Christ in the church and let
[1:31:34] me go back to the singles that don't
[1:31:35] have children you should be so glued to
[1:31:38] Christ that whatever Christ says you do
[1:31:41] that in your home right so our signals
[1:31:45] in their homes
[1:31:46] then I'm going there to keep them
[1:31:47] accountable other than the Holy Spirit
[1:31:49] if they're born again they should be so
[1:31:52] in two with the voice of the Holy Spirit
[1:31:54] that they should be glued to the will of
[1:31:57] the Heavenly Father right there in their
[1:31:59] homes and then through that they'll find
[1:32:01] a ministry right to serve others to
[1:32:05] serve God to serve others God will lead
[1:32:08] and guide them on how to do that there's
[1:32:13] my hour so let me let me bring this on
[1:32:16] mobile yeah I'm almost done here so
[1:32:21] let's close with verse 33 verse 33 is
[1:32:24] this summary here nevertheless let every
[1:32:27] one of you in particular so love him
[1:32:30] love his wife even his isms as himself
[1:32:33] so Paul closes us and he says how can I
[1:32:35] finish this this passage on marriage he
[1:32:39] said men love your wives as yourself
[1:32:42] praise God this is an age where they
[1:32:47] didn't they the men didn't love their
[1:32:48] wives Ephesians were taught not to love
[1:32:50] I thought that was that was wimpy that
[1:32:52] wasn't very manly to be faithful to one
[1:32:55] woman I wasn't very manly
[1:32:58] we have Paul says this is what the
[1:33:00] Spirit of Christ is teaching this is
[1:33:02] real love this is real manhood praise
[1:33:04] God he said and let the wife see that
[1:33:08] she reverence her husband now love for
[1:33:11] the men is agapo love that's the greek
[1:33:14] word it means to love dearly to be fun
[1:33:17] brothers we should be fond of our wives
[1:33:19] we should think highly of them we should
[1:33:21] love them dearly we should be well
[1:33:22] pleased so that's what that gob a means
[1:33:24] well pleased contented with we should be
[1:33:28] very content thank God for my wife she's
[1:33:31] a jewel my crown right she's she's my
[1:33:33] crown amen she's very valuable as the
[1:33:38] scripture says her price is far above
[1:33:39] rubies of millions of dollars and
[1:33:44] brothers let me say this in closing if
[1:33:46] you're not sure how to love your wife
[1:33:48] better then just ask her in humility
[1:33:52] maybe just say honey wants three things
[1:33:54] or what's one or two things I can do
[1:33:56] because maybe she'll give you a list
[1:33:57] that's so long you won't be able to
[1:33:58] handle it
[1:33:59] write me maybe me too well let's just
[1:34:02] ask is there one or two things I can do
[1:34:04] to show more love that I could help you
[1:34:06] out and show more love
[1:34:08] to you and then sisters let the wife see
[1:34:13] that she reverence her husband this is
[1:34:15] the word from a hoe which is the word to
[1:34:21] be struck with fear to be seized with
[1:34:23] the Lord no of course we know that's not
[1:34:24] the right word right definition to use
[1:34:27] for the word it's in this word to
[1:34:29] reverence or venerate that means really
[1:34:32] look up to an admirer to treat with
[1:34:35] deference or reverential obedience so
[1:34:39] our sisters in love should look at their
[1:34:42] husbands and instantly be ready to
[1:34:46] receive orders right just like the man
[1:34:48] should be ready honey how can I help you
[1:34:50] how can i how can I love you I want to
[1:34:51] be glued to you how can I help you
[1:34:54] just as a love of God you make a man be
[1:34:57] quick to think how can I serve you the
[1:35:00] Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit should help
[1:35:02] our sisters think what can i what can I
[1:35:05] do to obey you husband that same type of
[1:35:09] attitude so sisters if you're not sure
[1:35:11] how you could respect your husband's
[1:35:12] more you're the same thing humble
[1:35:14] yourselves in humility
[1:35:15] ask and say what's one or two more ways
[1:35:17] I could make you feel more respected or
[1:35:21] I could obey you in certain areas let's
[1:35:25] have our musicians come I told you I was
[1:35:26] closing some phrasing are just some
[1:35:30] lesson order my soul O my soul worship
[1:35:32] his holy name saying such as bow our
[1:35:35] heads I hope that was a blessing to you
[1:35:37] I hope that you can see even if you're
[1:35:39] married or not this scripture passage is
[1:35:44] so important because all of us want to
[1:35:46] be a part of the spiritual marriage all
[1:35:48] of us want to be glued to Christ if
[1:35:52] we're truly honest with ourselves praise
[1:36:02] God in hallelujah so let's have a word
[1:36:05] of Prayer Saints Heavenly Father we love

[1:36:20] thing in the message today some of our
[1:36:24] dear brothers have been married and
[1:36:26] maybe they've never been taught Lord God
[1:36:29] what real love is
[1:36:30] but it's sacrificial real love wants to
[1:36:36] be a servant to help lift up the weaker
[1:36:41] help make the weak strong it wants to be
[1:36:48] glued wants to be close in connection to
[1:36:55] their life and their children of our
[1:36:58] brothers in Jesus Christ lovely name

[1:37:09] of God and they think fondling and
[1:37:13] highly and be contented with their lives
