whom he justified he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God us who can be against us he that Spar not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifieth who is he thatth it is Christ that died rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter n in all these things we are are more than conquerors through him that led us for I am persuaded that NE death nor life

have thought and chewed and chewed and thought it's still good amen coming from psalms 27 we're going to read two passages out of there uh we're going to read Psalm 277 through 8 first then we're going to jump back up to the fourth verse is that okay amen amen psalms 27 brother brandom used this particular passage of scripture as the Rapture message I love this uh uh uh Psalm 27 amen amen because it tells a story and it prophesies it tells us what's going to happen am how God is going to act amen doing what we call the squeeze amen hallelujah so we don't have worry about nothing amenallah than making our calling election sure it was brought out so beautifully last night about the grace of God I love that amen because often time we forget uh how we're saved amen sir yes sir yes sir is that all right I'm G tell a little story in just a moment but let me get right into the word of God Psalm 27 7-8 hear oh Lord when I cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me when thou say Seek Ye my face my heart said unto thee thy face Lord will I see amen let us go to fourth verse this is the sentiment of my heart every day amen one thing I have I desire of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple perhaps this uh subject tonight may look like it's not agreeable with what I just read but by God's grace we'll understand it by I like to entitle this message All of Me Take All of Me amen amen let us pray father we come before you Lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for your grace your mercy everything you have done for us Lord God we realize that we are nothing without your grace nothing without your mercy Lord and whatsoever you have determined by your full knowledge will come to pass we're trusting by the grace of God yes that by your and through your election Lord you have chosen us yes to be bride whatever your choices or your choice is we're going to praise you anyhow because you just you are righteous You Are Holy yes you the allseeing God and you know what's best for us we have been created for your own good pleasure so father whatever it is in our lives whatever you choose to do with our lives let it be for your pleasure then we will be pleased as long as you pleas Jus Christ we are looking at a lot of things and so many things are flooding my mind we realize we're living in the last day and I got to be careful that I justes don't cross tomorrow message up with tonight but we are in a place right now that I believe there is a revival going on yes sir a brother just the other day told me that uh I don't need or we shouldn't pray for Revival but we should pray for the last ones to come in but I believe that if I pray for Revival the last ones will come amen Lord you can't tell me by God's grace that we are where we should be that's right Amen brother brandom spoke a message and he called it the identifications of a true church that's right there's no way to get around it if you don't see it there amen where is it and I believe that God gave us an answer last night when he said that we've been trying to live by law right law have oppressed yeah the gifts of God that's within us amen cuz remember when God impact you with the Holy Ghost it is not just but it is the life of God Amen and everything that God is amen you are yes so you can't tell me that there is not a gift or gifts in you right if you have the Holy Ghost because God is full of gifts y'all hear what I'm saying but the question comes to mind who are they who are those ones that will make heaven in Psalms 24 the word of God says beginning at the first verse the Earth is the Lords and the fullness thereof the world and they that dwell therein amen for he has founded it upon the Seas and established it upon the flood here's the question who shall Ascend into the hill of the Lord or who shall stand in his holy place now you Mount Zion now in order to get there you got to us sin and then Jesus said the only people who can Ascend are those who descend amen that's true Amen in other words you have to come from God Amen in order to go back to God he that have clean hands and a pure heart who have not lifted up his soul to vanity nor sworn deceitfully he shall receive the Bess blessings from the Lord and righteousness from the god of his salvation listen this is the generation of them that seek him that seek thy face oh Jo Jacob now listen he said now these are the ones ain't that amazing yeah that will Ascend those who seek his face and this day the face of God has been seen no other generation outside of this age why do you think amen people are attacking the cloud yeah because the cloud amen reveals the face of God sir and here in the message when it comes to the rap brother amen TI in this portion of the scripture lift up your heads yes sir oh ye gates and be lifted up ye Everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in and he talks about those who were under the law who found the grace of God and when God resurrected when Jesus resurrected they resurrected too Hallelujah and what they didn't realize is that when he resurrected I did too amen yes sir who is this king of glory the lord strong and mighty the Lord Mighty in battle Hallelujah yes sir lift up your heads oh you Gates even lift them up the Everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in I love this brother because the king of glory was the only on that enter that Gat the host of the redeemed for that age right behind so the gates wasn't just open for Jesus but it was open for all who died in amen hallelujah who is this king of glory there it is the Lord of hosts see he couldn't just say the Lord because he had a host coming behind hear what I'm saying the Lord of host he is the king of glory and then David said that rest that to meditate on it think about it all of me I'm G say some things now inspired by what brother Cam said last night so if you get upset you know what I'm saying he's the blame we realize we're living in the last days it's so important that we understand yeah because I'm going tell you something people I said this the other day and I think it's in the message and I could be wrong but I know you'll be familiar with what I'm saying when brother Brandon when he had to there was a white stone and he cut the top of the stone and we find out that there was an Unwritten word there and he told those preachers that was with them stay right here and look upon the stone amen God will reveal to you the mystery of the stone but I need you to stay right here yeah brother bam said none of them did they all walked away Hallelujah by walking away they gave their own interpretation of the message and so what we have been dealing with Young Generation those who have come after the great leaders hello because remember now they did not understand it but you see we who have been ordained to understand it will see it amen see it is simple amen yes yes it is really simple because you must understand brother random called this message his holy ghost message now look at all of the Ministries almost all of them have shipwreck yeah and the Lord allowed people to be confused yeah y'all hear what I'm saying so much so people don't even know what the Holy Ghost is that's right this message that's right they don't know what it is or who he is that's right that's the trth yes sir yes Men Who Rose up and interpreted what the prophet said because you know that's what Dayan and corter did yeah yeah and for those who followed that leadership what happened to them they were swallowed up by the California earthquake [Laughter] amen coming from the message of Grace he said Paul said in 1 Corinthians 13 though I speak with tongues of men and angels though have have discernment though have gifts to feed I'll take all my goods to feed the poor though I can move mountains with I have knowledge to understand all things I am nothing till love comes in which is Grace amen God has to do it you can't do all these things excuse me you can do all these things and still be lost it's Grace that saved you God grace to the human race amen Lord hallelujah yeah so it's okay to look message but that's not it that's right that's the trth have you received the Holy [Applause] Ghost you better get it if you don't have it am you said well what do you mean I heard just the other day I deal with some people uh I better not say too much but I find out by God's grace that even in in in Africa they want to do away with the B they calling it a old book yeah and they're now saying that the only message of the real true revelation of the word must be preached out of the spoken word books oh my Hallelujah to Hallelujah how you going to get rid of the book that meant so much to the prophet amen that's right sir in that book listen it's almost like the the early church saying we don't need the Old Testament scroll Hallelujah but Paul took the Old Testament scroll and brought out the new test all the M does for us is take the new test that's right true take that's [Applause] right I know to be true let me move on here's another then Jesus came say I spoke in tongues that don't have nothing to do with it I shout don't have nothing to do with it Paul said I could speak in tongues with men and angels and still be lost now watch that old devil yeah he took away the tongue speaking in the bride Hallelujah don't you ever get the holy go speaking in Tong God choose to give a man or woman the Holy Ghost and they speak in [Applause] Tong he came see the Giants right amen David was a giant killer right no in the M [Applause] the we got get real let me say like this I do not want to die thinking I got the Holy Ghost and find out at the end of the road I don't have it but I've done everything required Hallelujah come on it Ain a we're not here to practice religion we're here to be born [Applause] again am making at this he says no say still that don't have nothing to do with Paul said I could speak in touch with like men and angels and still be lost I could have faith to move mountains and still be lost that's ain't it if the Divine love of God isn't in your heart to take everything everything in the world out you're lost that's right and the devil's only deceiving you amen oh y'all hear what I'm saying all of the world must be taken out now you getting the subject down yes all of me come on is the real one cuz you and I realize Amen in this age you and I not an option we must have a God love you know what a God love is a Godly love is God's love God love is unconditional Lord hallelujah you understand let me read it but a go love will make you get down and pray for that man's lost Soul AAP love that's the kind of love the church needs what we all need is that kind of love God give me that love I'd rather have experience of love than have all the gifts of God got in heaven but you can have every gift thought got and still be lost how many knows that that's exactly right it's love the love of God where there's tongue they shall see whether it's prophecy it shall fail whether there's knowledge it shall vanish but when that which is perfect shall come it endureth forever love love one another that's a great saying come on you and I must understand when talking about love you got the Holy Ghost say you got the holy ghost that is you've been baptized with the Holy Ghost in your soul but you must understand there is a matur amen when you baptized with the Holy Ghost you still it let me is that okay you don't ever see a baby say listen and I've got to do this I got to do this I got to do that I gotta do this Amen to be mature the life in it yes will mature the baby sir Hallelujah why do you think God takes a tree and plant it and CA it is the roots to growen yeah because he doesn't want that tree to move out of his way that tree is so planted if there come a thunderstorm yeah he can't move amen if there is a hilt he can't move it doesn't matter what God sends his way he's there to stay amen because of the change of the SE season that tree will grow hear what I'm saying even God knows how to Pro his what are you talking about I'm talking about surrendering I was telling the church at home you can't produce nothing amen I said but what we need to learn how to do is that right right the word of God said no man can add one Cub to a statue right but one thing we can do is he amen every tree is has the ability to yield Hallelujah today I believe that's why when Jesus there was no fig on it it wasn't that the Fig didn't tree didn't have the ability to produce it right somehow the tree didn't learn how to [Laughter] they fail toi is to yield something is to to the possession or power of another Hallelujah Lord that means you must take away all your control you don't control nothing yeah oh come on some the truth yes sir you know that's one of the things when you get married a woman you know she veils herself and that Veil against you signify she has no head she has no head of her own No Authority that she's giving all of authority to a husband amen y'all hear me amen Hallelujah somebody said well she's the neck at to church the other day I said well if she is your neck and she's turning your head you better somehow get a stiff [Laughter] neck Hallelujah because I've been dealing with the family out here that with the family but let me say it like this just to drop a little corn it doesn't matter if you got a mother and a father and children and you and it it's not in order you're not a family hello Jesus described the family of God yes Christ amen Christ the head of the church amen and who's the who's the church the head of she out woman I'm must be you out sometime we give her the headship when the children come ask your mama ask your mama then after a while they stop asking Dy they go ask your mama yes then mama get upet when they stop asking her and they ask [Laughter] you let's on I just thought that in because you and I must understand in the Lord it is so true once the house get in order amen the whole church get in order sir Hallelujah is that right let's move on see you and I must understand that we don't deserve nothing but death that's true God don't owe us nothing can I another quote here listen listen and all of us deserve death because we have rebellions against God yeah notice we we all deserve dying but God is so merciful he should have never thought of us oh my yeah God Is So merciful he should have never thought of us but he's so merciful till he took the sins of every one of us and struck upon his own beloved Son Christ that we might not perish but would have eternal life how could we drink from the Rock and then not be right in our heart amen but brother there is millions of them this morning are doing it that's exactly right they're trusting because they're Baptist Methodist or Pentecostal I'm G throw this in or message come on true that's right they're trusting because they have a little funny feeling yeah because they spoke with tongu because they shouted because they danced because they had a healing service and God healed the sick or something they're trusting upon because they had a revelation it was true because they did this them things are are all right yes nothing to say against him but that has nothing to do with your salvation not one thing you can pull all out of your hands till it went by the gallon or blood out of your face and still mean nothing that's that's right Paul said I could speak with tongues like men and angels and still still be lost though I could have wisdom and knowledge and understand and explain the Bible just to make it look right to tie it together that still has nothing to do with it brother they all drank from the same Rock that Rock was Christ the Jud the judgments was upon Christ right that you might be privileged to come and drink it's God's goodness to you wait a minute the Judgment was upon the [Laughter] rock it is God's goodness to you that you do eat from the word hallelujah you don't deserve don't you know the manner that we're eating of is but was behind the veil only the priest the high priest was able to go back there oh come onen but God goodness allowed you to eat of it let it collect dust amen God's goodness to you that he permitted you to be baptized oh I saw the light you saw the light because he opened your it wasn't your inct that caused you to see it that's right intellectuals are still looking at acts 238 and they can't even see it Hallelujah God's goodness to you to make you a citizen to give you heal to let to set you in church this morning it's God's goodness that's all God's goodness but what about the goodness back to God are you willing to submit everything every thought every action everything in the him that's what God has done for you what will you do for him yall hear what I'm saying you and I must understand you know just something I I I fear for the people who have denounce this message and turn their backs on Malachi what they don't realize is that they have a committed amen a sin that I don't believe is forgivable it was God's grace that supplied us if you realize and recognize what what time of the day we're in we're in a time when they're coming a m Zion Showdown but you and I would have never known about my Zion Showdown if there had not been an Elijah First Kings 18 is this okay you and I must understand this thing is not a part oh I give God some of my life God don't want some of your life he wants it all he wants all of it to your dead I taught my church I said this is what you got to do this is how you live sometimes amen there are things in your life you're going down the road and you come to a fork in the road per se and that fork is your thought versus God's thought decision making time how do you make the right decision by allowing yourself to yield to the thought of God you that Jesus had to come to a walk in the RO when he said Lord not my will but thine be done yall hear what I'm saying yeah oh my like brother Cam said he Sanctified himself that we might be sanctified he could have had a wife he could have had children but the word did not a life or children he humed himself to the [Applause] word hallelujah for did that for me yes Hallelujah First Kings 18:24 and call ye and call ye are now what was happening Elijah there was a a m c Showdown why do you think this message was brought out to us and I will call on the name of the Lord and the god that answered by fire let him be God I love [Laughter] that you see why because you and I are living in a time where the people around don't want to see fire no more I got the Holy Ghost but they don't want that fire because the fire makes you do things you wouldn't normally do yes sir y'all hear what I'm saying I want the god that answers my if that was the way he proved that he was God in Elijah's day that's the way he's going to prove himself today our God cannot ch he T Mo he T those those Moab people or whatever they he he Ted them like the denomination right they were to us seven seven they had so much like us but the only thing they didn't have and That Was Elijah and Elijah's God [Music] on they work themselves so that they would cut you all on self and blood would push you everywhere and Elijah said we don't have to do all that see our our our sh is not in what how we worship we love to worship our worship is built around the sacrifice C calary he set his blood on Calvary thank you Lord say and he said let him be God and all the people that answered and said it is well spoken yeah see everybody think they got the Holy Ghost am I trying to scare you no but I trying to you don't sit back and say well I believe God sent a prophet and all I got to do is follow him uhuh you don't follow him you follow him as he follow Christ that's what Paul said who did William Rand follow he followed the pillars High who did Moses follow he followed the pill of fire who do we follow we follow the pill of fire Christ himself that's not taking away I meant to pull that quote up but brother said you know Mount Transfiguration you had Moses you had Elijah and you had Jesus he said he said they didn't glorify Moses on the mountain theyy Elijah person they glorify was Jesus Hallelujah don't get mad with me when I know who my husband is we must keep things in his proper place oh there was a time brother R stood Jesus Christ there's a time that you stand in Jesus Christ Hall you can't do nothing on your own hey nobody against the prophet here where we be without Hallelujah I can't wait to hug his NE I'll be feeling pretty good brother because if I can hug his neck that mean I made it hallelujah amen oh brother said you insane maybe I am but I like it this way it goes on down in here in the 31st and Elijah said unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came near to him and he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down is that right did the CR of God repair the altar that was broken down come on somebody he gave us instructions on how to worship God he exed Jesus Christ no other in this day he never glorified himself Hallelujah he did something that Moses couldn't do Hallelujah right the Bible tells us Moses glorified himself and because of that he didn't cross over Hallelujah but not this amen right amen did y'all know amen he

talking about water that didn't kill you that was symbol hear I'm saying that water baptism didn't stify you amen so if you've been pling with him that means you had a [Applause] fire in the likeness of his resurrection and what we did not understand is that when Jesus Christ was dying he was taken in the fire of God Amen right y'all hear what I'm saying he was taking the fire of God he was that burnt offering amen he went down to Hell Hallelujah hallah he was totally consumed amen praise the Lord is that okay amen but we we shall be also Resurrection that's one thing I love about that

said no you didn't say no [Music] God is that right but he that is dead is free from sin for if we be dead with Christ we will believe that we also live with him knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth had normal dominion over him amen hallelujah is that the word the said you are born of Incorruptible seed that means you cannot die anymore Hallelujah that those old Saints said years ago done died already hallah I don't die no more I go to sleep Hallelujah but that old that that new man catches up with his theop upstair y'all hear what I'm I can't imagine what it's like in heaven

hallu right re likewise Reon you also yourself to be dead and to sin but allow to God through Jesus Lord let no sin therefore re in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lust thereof neither yield you your members as instruments of un righteousness unto sin but Yi yourself unto God did you hear the word give amen you have the ability because you the you at the of the road you going either y to God or yield to the flesh that's what he say don't yield to the man on the left yield to the man on the right amen come oning ain't always easy say that amen whether it be your best friend whether it be your husband whether it be your wife when y'all go through this little stressful times of course y'all don't go through you know what I'm saying the point the one that's wrong to be one

right way you go skipping down the street like thank you Jesus yes Lord help me Jesus to become a burn offering amen amen God is requiring you to become a burnt offering amen amen you know what that

part of us [Laughter] living that's right yall hear what I'm saying don't sound quite right but it's the truth sir on and what's going to what see this is where the enemy has caught us in this message because we have we made the people I don't even know what you want to call it lukew what theil he used that word Pentecostal that's right because when you get fired up that's true emotional yeah beyond that come on I know is one of the main people that I know of his name was David D and David Ted out when the word came back into Camp amen and when the word came back the Camp David got beside a real don't caring on too much hey if you you think this bad now wait till tomorrow but you know what happen we allow people why because we want to be accepted yeah we're not of an accepted seed amen SE we possess is always y'all hear what I'm saying we are of a rejected seed and if Christ is living in you expect to be rejected this you want people to accept you this is the time you want him to accept is that all right Hebrews 914 I don't want to go too longer but he said for Christ being come and high priest of a good thing to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hand that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of ghost and Cal but by his own blood he enter into once in the Holy Place having attain for us but if the blood of bulls and goats the ashes of and he sprinkled the unclean Sanctified to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit there it is the blood of Christ is the eternal spirit oh I got BL BL if the eternal spirit which is Jesus Christ himself is not involved in your life there is no applying of the come on somebody how you GNA get Sanctified without the Holy Ghost do you really think aen that you can clean up enough for God to come in it takes God who is the perfect one that can sanctify you well enough amen yes Lord GL you said oh brother what are you saying I'm saying be understood what what this word is saying the Bible say when you get the Holy Ghost God don't even see how unclean you are amen thank you Lord because he's not looking at your life he know you going to make mistakes but he's looking at the blood I see the blood hoost hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord that's what it is you know and and that's true brother they took the word brother preach the message token and they use the token word amen to distinguish themselves from the Pentecostals like the Pentecostals distinguish themselves from each other one assembly God says Holy Spirit and the other one says holy ghost yeah yes we don't want the ghost we take the spirit and then we in the message say we don't want the Holy Ghost we want the token what's the difference what is the difference the token is the Holy [Applause] Ghost put in your pocket God gives you the earnest of holy is the token such a sophisticated way when I'm apply the token to you haven't even applied it to yourself that's right right right yes it ain't got some blood in a bucket yall hear what I'm saying it's not some blood in a bucket is when your life devil is afraid to talking about the B said no

place where yeah brother bam you know you think about the maturity of of of the church he was trying to bring them to a maturity and you say well what brother let me ask you a question if they came to maturity like he was really trying to bring them to maturity what happened to random Tabernacle righten come on let's deal with reality that's right what was going on that you could have all these does raised up like that where is the Holy Ghost amen amen y'all hear what I'm saying somebody should have been able to catch it amen you know you got to be circumcised yeah you got to be circumcised and and and and and Paul said in all the rest of the circumcises you yall no good right that's right but you was just as nasty and dirty as you want to be that's right amen you became Hypocrites that's what happened right but now we need the circumcision of the heart amen us Lord help us Lord amen we need God the Holy Ghost in fire that's what I love about Elijah he said Let the Fire amen a right Hallelujah just one more thing down in there's a real move of God move among the Pentecost they're calling it the second ofus hello did you know brother said that was gonna happen he said the start with them is that right because you see the wheat grows faster amen and things happen with them faster you see what I'm saying so my point is if the Holy Ghost is falling upon them he said yes they'll think they're receiving a Revival but they the mark [Music] of you know why because they've made the evidence of the Holy Ghost speaking in time oh help us Lord thank God for Malachi to make us know that all these things you can do all he did was just take what Paul said and have not charity and propit you nothing so brother B did all he did was lift it from the scripture and he said with without Divine love amen didn't say nothing different than what he said right and people all I can say is like I told the church I said we've been such we've been so into these Mysteries oh my God know the mystery of everything true have you been been more converted by right oh come on somebody you can understand all Mysteries that's true see what I'm saying first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all of these things will be added to us that's right hallelujah it's like we around 40 years when it could have take seven days get where we need to go for you to get back on your knees I don't care what nobody says this is between you and God in a group effort right every individual you must be sealed by the Holy Ghost yourself it ain't a group effort all we can do is warn you all we can do is tell you there's a Rapture about ready to take place they say California is lock and Road loaded y'all hear what I'm saying it can happen anytime the squeeze and the pressure on that F so bad they said this thing can happen anytime hallelujah hallelujah y'all hear what I'm say tomorrow's message but let me let me I'm trying to just search search your hearts amen amen look into your life deeply now and says Lord do I really have what it takes have I allowed you to go to my soul have you still in the living room yes yes M have I told you everything have I laid all my life out before you and have I see it was it's only when the sacrifice is accepted it can't be no blemish you can't tell God a half truth that's right you got to [Music] confess Hallelujah hear what I'm saying you can't say Lord forgive me of my know know the Holy Ghost say you know is that the truth yes you know that's the hardest thing and I'm G tell you something folks when I go into prayer I try to make it as real as possible and sometimes when I recognize I got I almost choke trying to get it out anybody know what I'm talking about choke because I I don't want to say it yeah I don't want to acknowledge it but if you don't acknowledge it it gonna stay there you got to acknowledge that devil yes and say Lord this is the situation I don't want I want to be clean I want to be God you going to have to burn this demon away from me is that right say God sends the fire to burn all the demons amen hallelujah I want that kind of fire am that's what that's what we must understand if you go before God and lay on the word of sacrifice that Al and L tell him from A to Z amen call it like it is amen and let him know he's the burn it away you know he Sanctified you to the place where you can keep from doing things but you need all the desires amen am I making because that's what going to take that's the word love God amen amen you have that song more of you I don't know the words you love the Lord amen FKS we just trying to keep it real that's right I I I'm Psalm 27 amen yes I'm Psalm 27 sir that's all I can tell you with Psalm 24 25 in there too but it ain't if I'm going to make a Rapture I'm Rapture amen I'm now sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen you said well brother Brooks even if you come to that place are you going to make mistake Paul said the good that I would I don't do that that's right I find it difficult sometime to fulfill it but that's when Jesus comes in yes am y'all hear what I'm saying he's My Sacrifice [Applause] amen he died instead amen that you and I can go free so why not lay your hands on sacrifice that's what they did when they laid their hands on that bu or whatever go whatever it was they can feel the life leave out of that and they knew that was me yes they could feel the agony of of of death taking the last breath from that other animal they knew this animal was this happen because of yes I said you know God tried to teach Adam and Eve something God could have just brought them a little blood or or a little clean coat of SK he didn't have to put the blood on there he didn't have to have it fresh but SK on Adam and Eve that's right think about how nasty that felt compared to the glory of God that they used to wear Hallelujah and when they saw that skin they recognized and when they felt all that blood and never seen death hello never seen the workings of death and now they are clothed in something that had to die for them about this they had no idea that God the devil had a trick up the road was going to die from an animal to a real Lamb of God right because AEL was like a type of the Lamb of God it didn't stop there folks from there on it continue to continue to continue and now death is more expressed now than mankind has ever amen a witness in his life and it's something that you and I will stay far away from hallelujah amen Ain't No Way forgive me for saying like this there is no way I'm gonna live in hell and then go to Hell by God's grace I'm just going to take every good thing he says about me praise [Music] God everything he says about me I'm going I'm walk there by his [Music] Mercy oh more

the Lord again for his mercy and his grace you know if we could uh I just got to had something on my heart here you know the brother said a few times and I don't think it was his flesh I really think it was the Lord about how we need to cry out for the fire amen Amen brother gave an example the time of Moses when they had the Exodus the people started crying out and God sent a deliverer amen amen amen gave example of the vision brother Brandon had both wheat and tears were crying out for rain then you know last Saturday morning in Minnesota I preached on Gideon they were crying yes because of the G through and because they cried out that said God sent them a prophet amen and I just thought maybe we can brother could you just play that song pass gentle how many you like they need a little more fire in their life say that how about fire in your home I could would like more fire in my home more Holy Ghost Fire I like more on the J amen more in the church for sure we know first it's got to be in the home come in the church as we heard tonight I'd like to invite uh some wheat seeds to come up here and pray with me if you would by God's grace anybody that would like to come up and uh pray a little bit you know I was mowing grass and I bought a pair of headphones that are noise counseling head noise cancelling headphones and the reason I bought those is brother random preach so uh I was listening to him preach SE will not be air with the sh 1965 how many you know that real good message a wonderful message um brother R says you know the church has long lost the desire for prayer meeting amen and he said there's no more agonizing in prayer for God to fulfill his word and after hearing a message like you know this tonight we all know we're not where we're supposed to be so what should we do should say that was a good message and go home or should the week cry out for a little more rain yes sir we know there's a latter rain coming but until then does anyone else see any more rain yes Lord I really feel like I'd like to just spend a few minutes uh in prayer know one time a friend of mine said he was I'm not being critical he said but you know when we come to church he said so little time is spent praying I thought my that was such a sweet statement you know we preach and we sing and church that's all needed don't get me wrong but sometimes we don't spend enough time praying amen so I'd like to uh you know invite anyone up that would like to come pray together and just kind of cry out to God for him to fulfill his word tonight anybody got time for that tonight God I thought maybe I'd bu Cam and Simon up first you know to pray with me they're my brothers and I don't think they'll get upset with me if I ask them to come up I like them if they come up here to the altar I want to just all all of us kneel at the altar and pray a little bit God we don't want to send the children out there we want to keep the children in here so they can see what it's like to pray praise God but when was the last time some of us knelt down at the altar and cried out to God for God to fulfill his word when was the last time we did that church I'm not saying it has to happen but on a night like tonight where the word of God has come and said take all of me ask ourselves have we laid all of ourselves on the altar to the Lord so let's take a few moments as our brother prays this I'm going to come and join my brothers here and anyone else who like to just let just lay at the altar and as we seeds let's just cry out for the rain can we do that by God's grace and if you would you know I know the mothers have to watch the children please do that let's spend a few minutes in prayer Jesus said my house my father's house rather will be a House of Prayer so let's just take a few moments and pray if you just bow your head let's [Music] pray [Music] here like I'd like to start in prayer and that whoever feels led to pray for different Promises of God to be fulfilled just go ahead and lead us in prayer maybe lost loved ones may the Holy Ghost in our homes the Holy Ghost in our churches the weed have to cry out as well according to the vision so I'm just going to start a Heavenly Father we believe this message oh God we believe we're the wheat seed Lord we believe we're the wise virgin Lord oh God we thank you for your mercy Lord I feel broken after a message like that I want you to take all of me God but I'm not ashamed of it I'm a man I fail I make mistakes and I confess them Jesus forgive me of my sins Lord I don't have to tell everybody about it but I do got to tell you about it Lord father you know the sins I've done forgive me Jesus I'm not worthy of the least of thy mercies as Jacob said but Lord when I see your grace in my life when I see the spirit Lord correcting me Lord I just I just thank you for Mercy Lord today and Lord as the pastor of this little assembly I know it's got to start with me Lord take all of me tonight God there's
