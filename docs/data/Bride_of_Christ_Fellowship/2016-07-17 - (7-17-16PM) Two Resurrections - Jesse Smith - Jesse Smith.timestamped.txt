[40:51] little bit of time on this a few
[40:52] Wednesday's ago by like to spend more
[40:53] time on two resurrections like that I
[40:56] preset tonight by the grace of the Lord

[41:04] morning's message that's why i want to
[41:06] make sure i bring it out here by the
[41:09] grace of the Lord so Revelation chapter
[41:11] 20 and I think it's believe its first
[41:16] four so I got my Bible here yes
[41:29] revelation 20 verse 44 they're saying
[41:34] that I saw Thrones and they SAT upon
[41:37] them and judgment was given unto them
[41:38] and I saw the souls of them that were
[41:41] beheaded for the witness of Jesus and
[41:43] for the word of God which had not
[41:47] worshipped the Beast neither his image
[41:51] neither had received his mark upon their
[41:53] foreheads or in their hands and they
[41:58] live and reign with Christ thousand
[42:00] years but the rest of the Dead lived not
[42:03] again until the thousand years were
[42:04] finished this is the first resurrection
[42:07] blessed and holy is he that hath part in
[42:10] the first resurrection on such the
[42:12] second death hath no power but they
[42:15] shall be priests of God and of Christ
[42:17] and shall reign with him a thousand
[42:19] years a minutes how will the word of
[42:22] Prayer pivot on your heart just thinking
[42:23] on it to God as we pray I'm going to be
[42:26] a part of that first resurrection I like
[42:28] to be a part of that by God's grace
[42:29] living for that with all my heart let's

[43:50] resurrection the not sure why that's on
[43:51] there okay by God's grace we have two
[43:55] resurrections and we doing a lot of
[43:57] reading here from the scripture then I'm
[44:01] going to be what I plan to do because I

[44:06] this and then I want to take a look at
[44:09] the white throne judgment a few things
[44:11] by the Rams said about that now I want
[44:13] to go through the remaining quote that
[44:15] just have a few more quotes from this
[44:16] morning's message for you pre-shop three
[44:18] kinds of believers and four classes I
[44:20] want to kind of look at that little more
[44:22] my god Tracy for the hose I did you a
[44:23] chance to check your email did you get
[44:25] this power point that I sent to you okay

[44:36] let me know that sister this morning in
[44:38] a row Scott's wife there's Scott's mom
[44:41] was taking pictures of my slides all the
[44:43] way in the back there so hopefully it
[44:45] was a blessing she said it was a real
[44:46] blessing to hurt her brother Scott came
[44:48] up in naming afterwards he said I really
[44:50] enjoyed these last few messages well
[44:51] Jessie it's really showing us how
[44:53] Abraham she needs to live we don't want
[44:55] to be like locked would it be like
[44:57] Abraham got this no Scott that's the
[45:01] same thing I've been thinking you know
[45:02] the more we look at it I'm over them
[45:05] closer to the word and look at Abraham's
[45:06] life versus last night the more we see
[45:09] where Abraham's seed praise God the fray
[45:12] bruh have seen that we gotta hang on for
[45:13] all 25 years or however long it's going
[45:16] to be can we see the body change villari
[45:19] so not to be with us and help us now I
[45:22] just want to start with this here I want
[45:23] to start with this and show you the
[45:25] first resurrection on the second
[45:28] resurrection now as you know if you get
[45:32] and I'm going to step down here if you
[45:33] know if we are part of this first
[45:35] resurrection I actually in another slide
[45:37] i turn the arrow upside down because you
[45:39] actually go up first resurrection is up
[45:41] and then you live up here with Christ
[45:44] chill and glory in heaven through these
[45:46] and then we come back at the Battle of
[45:48] Armageddon walk upon and ashes the
[45:51] wicked and then we spend all this time
[45:52] Rach sheet in here too they surround us
[45:55] as we went through and reach on the
[45:56] Millennium all the unbelievers surround
[45:58] their Satan gets all the unbelievers
[46:01] from all there
[46:01] surround us as numbers of sand of the
[46:04] sea program said that was the people who
[46:06] never got to hear possibly the gospel
[46:09] during their lives on the earth but then
[46:12] we lived through here eternally but
[46:13] we'll be all alive this whole time but
[46:16] everybody that dies the tribulation
[46:18] they'll there will be in the graves this
[46:20] whole time then they get resurrected
[46:22] right here ok so just want to make sure
[46:25] i bring that out so buddy can see that
[46:26] that's the that's the two resurrections
[46:28] all the dead bodies here of you know
[46:30] Saint Paul or the Saints even brother
[46:32] branham all the same to be resurrected
[46:34] here we get a body change we meet the
[46:36] Lord there that's the first resurrection
[46:38] you live above the tribulation come down
[46:40] to Armageddon we're here on the earth
[46:42] we're all part of that and then we sit
[46:44] on the throne and judge in the second
[46:46] resurrection okay now I want to read the
[46:49] scriptures that most easily prove this
[46:51] so the next slide has those scriptures
[46:53] like I said you could write those down
[46:54] or I could email to you I want to start
[46:57] with the first resurrection scriptures
[46:58] and then we'll just hop like this will
[47:01] hop back and forth so they're more plain
[47:04] and this one we actually read this
[47:05] morning right we are in debt one this
[47:07] morning I want to bring that out here
[47:10] back at the grace of the Lord just so we
[47:12] have those scriptures the more we study
[47:15] the message over we know we've got thus
[47:17] saith the Lord praise God the more we
[47:19] know this is the absolute truth God is
[47:22] revealed it to a prophet brought it to
[47:23] us and church to me the more everything
[47:26] makes sense as you saw this morning you
[47:28] know when we see in the news and Russia
[47:30] the news and Hillary Clinton and
[47:31] possibly know the Pope when we see all
[47:33] this in the news we know exactly where
[47:34] we're standing amen we're spending with
[47:36] Christ Jesus amen it'll be a small group
[47:39] like Enoch was Enoch was one Noah's was
[47:42] eight it'll be a small group in every
[47:43] hour it gives us grace to know that
[47:45] we're in the right spot now John chapter
[47:48] 5 right where we need to be remember
[47:51] brother branham said Jesus won't be one
[47:52] second late for the rapture that we
[47:54] right on time we can rest and that we
[47:56] have a lot of confidence that John 524
[48:01] now I get all these quotes if you
[48:04] remember from the church age bokra
[48:05] brother Ram talks about the two
[48:06] resurrections it actually takes a break
[48:09] in the book of life section and he
[48:11] breaks into the two resurrections
[48:12] because you have a resurrection for the
[48:15] goes feel that you have a resurrection
[48:17] for all others so that's actually in the
[48:19] church each book and that's where I get
[48:20] on these scriptures from ok jaan bhai 24
[48:24] barely married I send you he they hear
[48:25] my word and believeth on him that sent
[48:27] me hath everlasting life it should not
[48:29] come into condemnation or judgment but
[48:31] is passed from death unto life butters
[48:35] this has to mean that baptism of the
[48:36] Holy Ghost it has to write because the
[48:39] foolish version comes into Condon they
[48:42] come into the judgment right to come
[48:44] into that so uh jesus said when you
[48:48] believe you have like you pass from
[48:50] death no more death or well what we saw
[48:53] a few Wednesday's ago the soul the scene
[48:55] in the soul is not normal anymore it's
[48:57] brought to life praise God it's brought
[49:00] to light because the foolish version
[49:01] they have a seat now they're part of the
[49:03] resident we'd say they have a seat but
[49:05] it's never quickened it's never brought
[49:07] up to the fullness because they never
[49:10] get bored again and so they can never
[49:12] pass into real life of the baptism of
[49:15] the Holy Ghost but the day before no we
[49:17] saw this morning they were for known
[49:18] before the foundation of the world jesus
[49:20] said so and he prepared part of the
[49:22] kingdom of the new heavens and new earth
[49:23] he prepared part of the kingdom or the
[49:26] foolish virgin that's exactly what Jesus
[49:28] said so they were foreign up before
[49:30] ordained and foreign or four known as
[49:32] well but verse 24 John 5 is the bride is
[49:37] those who receive the baptism of Holy
[49:40] Ghost they're passed from death unto
[49:41] life they met first 25 bear the bear not
[49:45] saying you the hours coming and now is
[49:46] when the dead you hear the voice of the
[49:48] Son of God and they that hear shall live
[49:50] now some people say that's compound that
[49:53] might have been when Jesus resurrected
[49:54] his first resurrection or might be the
[49:57] rat rapture as well so mighty compound
[49:59] in verse 25 like i said i'm not sure i'm
[50:02] not really sure it sounds like it would
[50:03] be verse 26 president bother at life in
[50:06] himself so had he given to the son have
[50:08] life in himself I've given him authority
[50:10] to execute judgment also because he's a
[50:12] son of man okay now we get to verse 28
[50:15] 29 this is the second resurrection in
[50:18] the first resurrection that's all those
[50:19] who already have like they're passed
[50:21] from death unto life no more
[50:22] condemnation because they're walking in
[50:24] the spirit not the flesh ties it with
[50:27] revelation I'm sorry Romans 8
[50:28] so let's read 28-29 al Qaeda you got
[50:32] your Bible buddy all right maybe you
[50:34] read that for Yuri 28 29 oh it's okay
[50:38] i'm sorry i thought your turn out it's
[50:39] okay buddy i read back i get the next
[50:41] one ready get can get this room ready
[50:42] here revelation 20 verse 4 i'm sorry i
[50:45] thought you had been my father here 28
[50:48] Marvel not this for the hour is coming
[50:50] in which all a double album random says
[50:53] all that are in the graves shall hear
[50:55] his voice not everybody hears his voice
[50:59] right here not everybody does okay but
[51:03] it's at this this is the all when all
[51:05] hear his voice everybody this is my
[51:08] brother em sell around the corner
[51:09] Lindsey but I said everyone's got to
[51:10] give god the glory some time either in
[51:13] your lifetime you'll bow your knees in
[51:14] your lifetime or your bow your knee at
[51:16] the white throne judgment every knee
[51:18] shall bow every tongue confess you're
[51:20] going to give God glory at some time
[51:22] let's give it to a matter net uh
[51:24] although the grace yours voice and shall
[51:28] come forth they that have done good unto
[51:31] the resurrection of life and they that
[51:33] have done evil to the resurrection of
[51:35] damnation okay now then that will stop
[51:41] right there because that's basically the
[51:42] end of it so Jesus caught and we'll get
[51:44] to this in a moment but Jesus calls the
[51:46] second resurrection the resurrection
[51:48] unto sorry life and condemnation or
[51:51] damnation this is called life and
[51:53] damnation and that's called the rapture
[51:56] or the catching away the first
[51:59] resurrection okay so Malik I can you
[52:02] read revelation twenty four and six yeah
[52:09] for five or six please thank you condom
[52:14] and judgmental spirit of confident and I
[52:17] saw the soul of the American headed to
[52:19] the fitness of Jesus and for the word of
[52:22] God and we tried not worship the Beast
[52:25] even his image either i received his
[52:27] mark upon their foreheads with their
[52:29] hands and they lived in very fresh two
[52:32] thousand years but the rest of the dads
[52:34] with monica and blue father years
[52:36] fulfill this is the first resurrection
[52:39] weston and blue easy part
[52:42] resurrection of such the second death
[52:44] with no power but they shall be priests
[52:47] of God and a price game with them amen
[52:51] now I'm just going to go through verse 4
[52:53] because first four makes it seem like
[52:55] you have to be a harder but the Bible
[52:57] uses the word and over and over again
[52:59] and and and right so those that will be
[53:02] bribed members may be beheaded right
[53:04] like Paul was like Peter while Peter was
[53:07] crucified upside am appalled was
[53:08] beheaded different ones were beheaded in
[53:10] the martyr martyrs age and they still
[53:12] are today it's her countries so those
[53:16] that are guys martyrs and now also for
[53:19] the word of God and which had not
[53:22] worshipped the Beast neither His image
[53:25] what's the image of a man tells the
[53:27] image of the Beast is the World Council
[53:29] churches okay so this this covers the
[53:32] whole church change from the time you're
[53:33] a martyr the early martyrs in the lion
[53:35] age and ox age of course ox age was more
[53:38] sacrificial a lot of people die
[53:40] throughout all the ages so this covers
[53:42] all those so those that don't bow to the
[53:45] economical movement and system neither
[53:48] had received his mark in their foreheads
[53:50] but if brother have said the mark of the
[53:52] forehead was the doctrine right or the
[53:55] will of of the ecumenical move that's
[53:58] the mark of the beast do what they want
[54:00] or we believe in three persons we
[54:02] believe it sprinkling or we believe in
[54:03] all this holy water and all kinds of
[54:05] stuff like that not that might not be
[54:08] scriptural a lot of that subscription
[54:11] also they had not received it in their
[54:14] hands in front end so that's do the will
[54:16] of the World Council system so tell you
[54:18] what they do I don't know if you saw but
[54:20] yesterday they had a major gathering
[54:21] washington DC at all all kinds of
[54:23] Christians did you see that then
[54:25] christian rappers there they had all
[54:27] kinds of christian speakers that women
[54:29] preachers men creatures they say there's
[54:31] all this violence go along let's just
[54:32] come together for Christ now that could
[54:33] be dangerous that's very dangerous
[54:36] because you have women preachers and you
[54:38] have all these had two guys and all
[54:39] kinds of worldly were Creek worldly
[54:42] Christian Christian music right and to
[54:45] me it was a free figure of what's coming
[54:47] right the whole economical system
[54:50] because they see all this you know
[54:51] homosexuality abominations and so more
[54:53] like that and my wife sent me hard
[54:55] one of the main speaker said hopefully
[54:57] in 10 years they'll have an openly gay
[54:59] preacher preaching this affects they
[55:01] plan to it every year that's their hope
[55:03] is that sad so that clearly shows us
[55:06] that is moving towards the mark of the
[55:08] beast amen although you know it's a good
[55:10] idea to be one the only way you can be
[55:12] one with God is go Bay all the work
[55:14] right that doesn't make us one with God
[55:16] when we disobey the word so we see what
[55:19] that is now let's go to Revelation 23rd
[55:22] 11 through 15 okay but I saw a great
[55:28] white throne and him that sat on it from
[55:30] whose face the earth and the heaven fled
[55:31] away and there was found no place for
[55:33] them right and I saw the dead small and
[55:37] great stand before God and the books
[55:39] were opened another book was opened
[55:41] which is the book of life and you
[55:43] imagine Elvis will be there imagine that
[55:44] a man said I hate to call ladies brought
[55:46] Elvis pappu Michael Jackson Prince all
[55:51] these men women have gone on before
[55:53] Marilyn Monroe everybody will be there
[55:55] and the home standing before the Lord
[55:57] Jesus and the dead were judged out of
[56:00] things which are in the books according
[56:01] to their works and the sea gave up the
[56:04] Dead which were in it and death and
[56:06] he'll delivered up the Dead which were
[56:08] in them and they were judged every man
[56:11] according to their works and death in
[56:13] hell were cast in lake a fire this is
[56:15] the second death and whosoever was not
[56:17] found written in the book of life was
[56:20] cast in the lake of fire now I forgot I
[56:23] one of the same verse 5 but the rest of
[56:26] the Dead those are some of the most
[56:27] keywords for this doctrine of two
[56:30] resurrections the rest that then lived
[56:32] not until the thousand years were
[56:33] expired okay so jesus said all that are
[56:37] the graves will hear his voice that has
[56:38] to be at the white throne judgment so
[56:40] the rest of the Dead don't live during
[56:42] the thousand year period they live
[56:44] afterwards those are the most important
[56:46] words when you're building this doctor
[56:48] the rest of the dead now first
[56:53] Thessalonians 4 16 and 17 I'm just going
[56:56] to read it because I'm really close to
[56:57] it get there pretty fast and then
[57:01] Matthew 25 you read that this morning
[57:06] all right
[57:15] hey for 1674 the Lord himself shall
[57:18] descend from heaven with a shout with
[57:20] the voice of the Archangel with the
[57:22] Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[57:24] shall rise first then we which are alive
[57:26] and remain shall be caught up together
[57:27] with them in the clouds to meet the Lord
[57:29] in the air so shall we ever be with the
[57:31] Lord and these words were to comfort
[57:33] those we lost loved ones verse 18
[57:36] wherefore comfort one another with these
[57:37] words on a concert that is we'll see our
[57:39] loved ones again and our friends again
[57:41] amen now Matthew 25 I'm not gonna read
[57:45] all that because we read a lot of that
[57:46] this morning but let's go to 25 and
[57:48] we'll probably start around 35 or
[57:50] something like that Matthew 25 this is
[57:59] probably to be one of my next videos I'm
[58:00] kind of praying about it and asking God
[58:03] to give me a script you know it most
[58:05] important things to say so I've kind of
[58:07] a really stayed on the subject here and
[58:09] also with this seriously savored and
[58:11] scarcely lost the car it all ties
[58:12] together ok now we did 31 this morning
[58:16] though so this morning we read about the
[58:18] righteous right so let's read about the
[58:20] goats okay numbers 41 then shall i say
[58:27] unto them on the left hand depart from
[58:28] me he cursed an everlasting fire
[58:30] prepared for the devil his angels I was
[58:32] hungered and you gave me no meat I was
[58:34] thirsty and you gave me no drink I was a
[58:36] stranger he took me not in naked and you
[58:38] code me not sick and in prison and you
[58:40] visited me not and shall they also
[58:42] answer him saying Lord wenzhou ed a
[58:45] hundred or thirsty or a stranger or
[58:47] naked or sick or in prison and did not
[58:49] minister unto thee then shy answer them
[58:52] saying marathon send you in as much have
[58:54] you done it not to one of the least of
[58:55] these you did it knocks to me and these
[58:59] should go away into everlasting
[58:59] punishment but the righteous into life
[59:01] eternal so jesus said this is the
[59:04] resurrection of life resurrection of
[59:06] damnation the white throne judgment all
[59:09] right now so these are things i think
[59:11] the next few slides have already covered
[59:12] so corn in Jesus Christ Himself there's
[59:14] two resurrections or two types of
[59:16] Christians and we read the we read that
[59:19] this morning we read this
[59:20] so sweet Ephesians 5 14 it shows the two
[59:23] types of Christians as well it's all
[59:24] over the scripture it seemed you're like
[59:26] Abraham lot like we said David and saw
[59:28] different ones like that but it's also
[59:31] seen here in Ephesians chapter 5 talks
[59:34] about the wise and the foolish that's
[59:37] really been a good screw sure that's
[59:39] opened up lately as well these wise and
[59:41] foolish scriptures Sophie's ins 5 14
[59:44] through 17 all right wherefore he saith
[59:50] awake now that sleep is does that sound
[59:52] like the parable of the virgins they're
[59:55] awake now the steepness right and arise
[59:58] from the dead in Christ shall give me
[1:00:00] light amen see then that he walk
[1:00:03] circumspectly or that means precisely we
[1:00:06] should walk precisely in the will of God
[1:00:09] not as fool's but as wise as beautiful
[1:00:14] redeeming the time because the days are
[1:00:17] evil understanding I'm sorry we're corby
[1:00:20] not unwise but understanding what the
[1:00:23] will the Lord is remember that what the
[1:00:25] will of God is her brother or st. Paul
[1:00:27] says the will of God is a mystery in
[1:00:29] Ephesians chapter 1 and brother Branham
[1:00:31] picks it up in the adoption series he
[1:00:33] says a mystery see every man or woman
[1:00:35] has to seek god for the will of God for
[1:00:37] their life he talks about Paul going off
[1:00:39] to Raven for three years so here again
[1:00:42] the only the lies version do the perfect
[1:00:44] will of God they're the ones who the
[1:00:46] mysteries been revealed to okay the
[1:00:48] foolish don't know they don't redeem the
[1:00:50] time they don't walk perfectly or
[1:00:52] circumspectly they just walk half has
[1:00:54] early in and out well I think I'm in the
[1:00:56] will of God maybe not but the true wise
[1:00:58] Christian is in the will of God they
[1:01:00] understand the will of God hallelujah so
[1:01:06] now next slide the two resurrections
[1:01:09] there's a person second now we read this
[1:01:11] the first resurrection we read that a
[1:01:13] reddit reddit those are the scriptures
[1:01:15] so the first resurrection those who live
[1:01:17] and reign with Christ for a thousand
[1:01:19] years that's the first resurrection and
[1:01:21] that's only who it is right plus 144,000
[1:01:25] unbored for thousands of broad members
[1:01:27] holy ghost filled members this includes
[1:01:29] oddly this includes all the Old
[1:01:31] Testament Saints that were resurrected
[1:01:33] Jesus that came up to the gates because
[1:01:35] the Bible said they had glorified bodies
[1:01:37] they had new bodies so they had Laura
[1:01:40] five bodies and once you're the
[1:01:41] glorified body on see how you can get
[1:01:43] out of them I don't see how God I would
[1:01:44] take that away from it but I believe the
[1:01:46] first resurrection will be all those
[1:01:47] Saints the old testament to a glorified
[1:01:50] bodies the bride members of the New
[1:01:51] Covenant and the 144,000 I believe that
[1:01:54] will be there and then the Bible said
[1:01:56] that there will be heathen nations the
[1:01:59] numbers of the sands of the sea in the
[1:02:01] Millennium that will roll over brother
[1:02:03] grams that that's what the bride will
[1:02:04] rule over those who didn't get a chance
[1:02:06] possibly to hear the word of God that's
[1:02:09] what he said it's possible okay the
[1:02:12] second resurrection is life or damnation
[1:02:15] at the light thrown so that's what that
[1:02:17] is so I had it just I had those
[1:02:19] descriptions on there so you can see
[1:02:21] that here yeah here's where I changed my
[1:02:23] arrow the first resurrection is actually
[1:02:25] going up those who live and reign with
[1:02:26] Christ a thousand Blenheim now the
[1:02:28] second resurrection is those who miss
[1:02:31] the thousand-year millennium and must be
[1:02:32] judged at the White throw praise god
[1:02:35] that's the second resurrection now
[1:02:38] that's probably review for most of us
[1:02:40] here but let's look at here Jesus called
[1:02:45] the second resurrection the resurrection
[1:02:46] of the life or denomination so like or
[1:02:49] damnation takes place at the white
[1:02:51] throne judgment so this is where this
[1:02:54] was another example I want to say for
[1:02:56] tonight this is the example of those who
[1:02:58] are scarcely stayed or scarcely lost
[1:03:01] right here they're scarcely saved or
[1:03:03] scarcely lost right at the white throne
[1:03:05] judgment okay because the second net is
[1:03:08] the damnation or the separation from
[1:03:10] Christ for all eternity we know they
[1:03:13] won't live for eternity whether they
[1:03:15] have to be separated for all your
[1:03:16] ternity until they are niall ated
[1:03:18] totally now here's the second death
[1:03:21] jesus warned us about the second death
[1:03:22] let's read it together never see that
[1:03:24] discreet if ready 123 he that hath an
[1:03:27] ear let him hear what the spirit saith
[1:03:30] unto the churches he the overcometh
[1:03:33] shall not be her of the second death
[1:03:35] amen sorry I all over covers will not be
[1:03:40] hurt of that second death so it kind of
[1:03:43] shows you as well the foolish heart
[1:03:44] included in here if they can overcome to
[1:03:47] their pride and they can overcome their
[1:03:49] hatred and they can overcome any evil
[1:03:51] that would make them feeble about
[1:03:53] Christians and actually be kind of the
[1:03:55] Christians and the Christians Jesus will
[1:03:57] call them an overcomer and they won't be
[1:03:59] heard of the second death amen that's
[1:04:01] grace right direction that's amazing
[1:04:04] grace a bit so see we about the bride is
[1:04:07] supposed to overcome everything but the
[1:04:09] fooj version will just overcome maybe
[1:04:11] hatred for Christians and other sins and
[1:04:14] other pride so we're like that some of
[1:04:16] them will be to merge into the word as
[1:04:18] far as they know but they'll be foolish
[1:04:20] to the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's
[1:04:22] right that's the word of the Lord now I
[1:04:27] want to go through a few things here
[1:04:29] let's look at those scarcely saying at
[1:04:31] the white throne judgment my brother has
[1:04:34] a few quotes here so i want to read
[1:04:35] these to you I don't have them on a
[1:04:36] slide that's why i said here i want to
[1:04:38] look at the white throne judgment
[1:04:39] scarcely stayed and those that are lost
[1:04:41] and i want to go through the last few
[1:04:43] quotes of three kinds of believers from
[1:04:46] that message honest and two and studied
[1:04:48] yesterday all right now in the white
[1:04:53] throne judgment here's her brother him
[1:04:55] says he's preaching the message
[1:04:57] conference of with God 1959 December
[1:05:00] twentieth Levin says he's talked about
[1:05:05] conferences he said for let me tell you
[1:05:08] I'm going to speak of the last
[1:05:09] conference that will ever be held oh my
[1:05:12] i'm going to go back on my slideshow go
[1:05:14] back to that one the last conference
[1:05:17] that I'll ever be held right here the
[1:05:19] last conference we're having a lot of
[1:05:20] great conferences in America right and
[1:05:22] all around the world message conferences
[1:05:24] we call them special meetings amen and
[1:05:27] they got for that anniversary meetings
[1:05:28] and like we do in all kinds of meetings
[1:05:30] family camps and youth camps and now
[1:05:32] that's wonderful but he said I'm going
[1:05:34] to speak of the last conference that
[1:05:37] will ever be held he said God be
[1:05:39] merciful only one thing will stand there
[1:05:41] reconciled that's the judgment and the
[1:05:45] only thing you will be reconciled by is
[1:05:47] when you accepted the blood of Jesus
[1:05:50] Christ and your pardon and then fill
[1:05:52] with his spirit he said there's a
[1:05:54] conference where every man will meet
[1:05:57] woman will be every childhood meet there
[1:05:59] is a place selected where that
[1:06:01] conference will be held and there will
[1:06:03] be a great white throne judgment set and
[1:06:06] the Bible said the books were open
[1:06:09] another book which is the book of life
[1:06:10] ten thousand nine ten thousand The
[1:06:13] ministers and angels ministered to him
[1:06:14] and there was written and the righteous
[1:06:16] be scarcely saying where will the sinner
[1:06:19] and the ungodly appear amen that's how
[1:06:21] we find these quotes when you look up
[1:06:22] those like that what will your stand be
[1:06:27] at that conference you might have bypass
[1:06:32] all the conference's down through your
[1:06:33] life you may walk out this door this
[1:06:35] morning to bypass this one but my friend
[1:06:37] you will never buy past that one you are
[1:06:40] going to be there for it is once a point
[1:06:44] up to beg to die but after that the
[1:06:46] judgment so we're looking at the white
[1:06:48] throne judgment everybody is going to be
[1:06:50] there by now let me go to a different
[1:06:53] quote if you got your Bibles it's going
[1:06:55] to Daniel chapter 7 he ever Bibles ready
[1:06:57] so at the end of chapter 7 where we have
[1:07:00] another scripture about the white throne
[1:07:01] judgment right after Ezekiel you have
[1:07:06] Daniel Daniel 7 verse 9 brother infosys
[1:07:18] in the Patmos vision 1960 no let's read
[1:07:23] verse 9 and 10 I be held to the thrones
[1:07:27] were cast out of the Ancient of Days
[1:07:28] thats it whose garment was white as snow
[1:07:30] in the hair of his head like the pure
[1:07:32] wool his throne was like a fiery flame
[1:07:35] and his wheels as a burning fire does
[1:07:37] that sound familiar like revelation what
[1:07:39] his throne is fire right fire he has
[1:07:44] fire on his throne this is the white
[1:07:46] throne judgment first ten a fiery stream
[1:07:49] issued in came for from before him
[1:07:52] thousand thousands ministered unto him
[1:07:55] and ten thousand times ten thousand
[1:07:57] stood before him the judgment was set
[1:08:01] and the books were open how many how
[1:08:04] many you read that before by God's grace
[1:08:05] so here's another picture of the white
[1:08:08] throne judgment you have thousand
[1:08:10] thousand
[1:08:11] administering or serving him which
[1:08:13] program says in some places it's the
[1:08:14] ride other places he says 144,000 okay
[1:08:18] it could be either one defensive cookie
[1:08:20] use but then the judgment is set and
[1:08:23] books are open and then the this ancient
[1:08:26] of day starts reading and judging out of
[1:08:28] the books now mother ever says is I want
[1:08:31] to ask you something I'm speaking to you
[1:08:33] lukewarm Church 10 versions went out to
[1:08:36] mean the Lord five of the Hawaiian spy
[1:08:37] foolish he said Daniel 79 said the books
[1:08:40] are open that's the book of the sinner
[1:08:41] and another book was opened who came
[1:08:45] within the church from the rapture tens
[1:08:48] of tens of thousands times thousands
[1:08:51] came with him and ministered unto him
[1:08:53] his wife the bride's this Casey said the
[1:08:55] bride o glory his wife came with him the
[1:08:58] church Johnson was set and the books
[1:09:00] were opened and another book was opened
[1:09:02] which was the sleeping virgin and every
[1:09:05] man was judged thus from the book now
[1:09:11] can I just stop for a moment here I just
[1:09:15] wanted to say this let's go back a
[1:09:18] little bit let's go back here to the
[1:09:21] rapture that's the first resurrection I
[1:09:24] really love the Lord tonight first
[1:09:27] resurrection this is what the scripture
[1:09:30] teaches the furnished resurrection the
[1:09:33] holy spirit goes up and Satan comes down
[1:09:36] safety and cast out of heaven for
[1:09:38] another time he's already cashed out
[1:09:40] when Michael kicked him out he's getting
[1:09:41] cat kicked out again now some point not
[1:09:46] long after the rapture maybe a writing
[1:09:48] suffer for three half years sometime in
[1:09:50] there the Bible said all must stand
[1:09:53] before the judgment seat of Christ let
[1:09:55] me know that that's when we all stand
[1:09:57] before the judgment seat of Christ so
[1:09:59] while the world is going through
[1:10:00] tribulation purging we are being given
[1:10:02] rewards and crowds okay that's what
[1:10:06] we're taught here from the scripture all
[1:10:08] of us and before the judgment seat of
[1:10:10] Christ so if we are all on the judgment
[1:10:13] seat here then we got to stand before
[1:10:16] the judgment seat at another time and
[1:10:18] that's the apt sometime after the
[1:10:20] marriage supper of the Lamb or sometime
[1:10:21] during that that great procession so
[1:10:24] when you and I stand before the judgment
[1:10:27] seat of Christ mother rabbit had a dream
[1:10:29] about it ever he saw brother Neville go
[1:10:31] up he was HOH so happy oh praise God
[1:10:32] brother Devils enter against it and all
[1:10:34] these things and then he said he never
[1:10:35] thought he'd be caught up he was caught
[1:10:37] up he felt a hand on this side it was
[1:10:39] his first wife hope and then he had on
[1:10:41] the side was beat up and he goes up to
[1:10:43] stand before the judgment seat of Christ
[1:10:45] had a dream about that so that's where
[1:10:47] we will stand before the judgment seat
[1:10:49] of Christ and we will we will look at
[1:10:54] our lives in the Bible set your works
[1:10:56] will be judged right you'll get a reward
[1:10:58] for your works all the works that remain
[1:11:00] you'll be given a reward for praise God
[1:11:02] and that's where that takes place so the
[1:11:05] the judgment seat of Christ for the
[1:11:08] believer is in heaven while the
[1:11:10] tribulations going on in earth yeah next
[1:11:16] we see at the Battle of Armageddon
[1:11:18] Christ comes back down right with his
[1:11:21] white horse praise God and then the Army
[1:11:24] of God comes with him riding on white
[1:11:26] horses and brother the Bible said the
[1:11:28] sort of the spirit goes out of his mouth
[1:11:30] destroys his enemies the files come down
[1:11:32] brother ramsden at some point about
[1:11:34] volcanoes have to erupt right he also
[1:11:37] said if idea so holy fire from heaven
[1:11:39] but god has to burn the earth over
[1:11:41] before Christ sets his foot upon the
[1:11:43] earth they met so he sets his foot upon
[1:11:46] the earth now once his burned-over
[1:11:47] Christ sets his foot upon the earth and
[1:11:49] the Bible said the next thing Jesus does
[1:11:51] is he anoint the most holy he annoys the
[1:11:54] Jewish temple in it sorry he sets up his
[1:11:58] temple upon the earth and then Christ
[1:12:00] and the ride are in the temple
[1:12:02] apparently that's we would look at it
[1:12:04] and banana the 144,000 are two
[1:12:07] resurrected there and they serve the
[1:12:09] bride amen so we had that going on now
[1:12:13] for a thousand years program said
[1:12:15] nations have to be rude over and the
[1:12:18] Bible said the believers israel will
[1:12:20] build houses and half of them and
[1:12:22] they'll be animals and a child will lead
[1:12:25] a lamb a child will need a lion and all
[1:12:28] these things that's all taking place
[1:12:30] through the thousand-year reign Satan is
[1:12:32] bound up and the bottomless pit with the
[1:12:34] seal on it for a thousand years and then
[1:12:37] as we saw at the
[1:12:38] gog and magog Satan is Lou so Satan is
[1:12:42] loose for a little while he comes up to
[1:12:44] the earth he deceives all the nations
[1:12:46] one more time he gathers them around
[1:12:48] Jerusalem and they're going to try to
[1:12:51] destroy the camp of God the Bible said
[1:12:53] but then God sends a fire from heaven a
[1:12:56] holy fire down and burns up Satan and
[1:12:58] all the all the unbelievers and throwing
[1:13:01] all the nations now you have just Christ
[1:13:05] left with his bride now is the time or
[1:13:08] the white throne judgment and here's
[1:13:11] what the scripture said Marvel not at
[1:13:15] this from the hours coming in which all
[1:13:17] that are the graves shall hear his voice
[1:13:20] and shall come forth so let me just stop
[1:13:24] here for a moment Jesus will step out I
[1:13:29] don't know how he's going to do it he
[1:13:30] might you know go outside of the court
[1:13:32] you just might stand on his throne but
[1:13:33] the cheese is going to call all the
[1:13:35] different generations of covenants so
[1:13:38] I'm just kind of in my mind I start
[1:13:39] thinking about things like this I'm just
[1:13:41] going to dramatize so perhaps he'll call
[1:13:43] forth the first covenant it was the
[1:13:45] Adamek covenant right to add in public
[1:13:48] so Jesus would call for the Bible said
[1:13:50] he'll say come for all those in the
[1:13:53] grades from the Covenant of Adam and all
[1:13:56] those bodies the Bible said whether they
[1:13:58] are the see whether they're in the earth
[1:14:00] no matter where they are all those
[1:14:02] bodies will be raised up and come for
[1:14:04] praise God they're right next Jesus was
[1:14:08] saying all those from the Abrahamic
[1:14:11] covenant remember that's what we come to
[1:14:13] change now us the Abraham and his seed
[1:14:15] can be saved right that's in Genesis 15
[1:14:19] 18 the i seed would be saved so all
[1:14:23] those are the circumcision all those of
[1:14:25] Abraham see during Abraham's day they
[1:14:28] must rise up and they'll rise up and
[1:14:30] they'll come forth next Jesus will say
[1:14:35] all those of the Mosaic Covenant all
[1:14:38] those that lived in times of Moses all
[1:14:40] the way up to the New Testament come for
[1:14:42] and all those bodies will raise up can
[1:14:44] you imagine all the bodies coming up all
[1:14:47] coming forth unto the white throne
[1:14:49] judgment right here and the last one
[1:14:52] born is the New Covenant all those who
[1:14:55] died under the New Covenant the New
[1:14:56] Testament all those who died all those
[1:14:59] bodies come for her judgment and all the
[1:15:02] bodies will come for right everybody who
[1:15:05] says this is the last conference to be
[1:15:07] held now back in Revelation 20 I wonder
[1:15:13] what a time is going to be I remember we
[1:15:17] already stood we already stood before
[1:15:19] the judgment seat of Christ during this
[1:15:20] time so now we're sitting with him
[1:15:23] praise God we're sitting with the Lord
[1:15:25] and not being judged by the Lord this
[1:15:28] will be the last conference we all ever
[1:15:30] attend the eve ahead will be this white
[1:15:33] throne judgment cording to brother
[1:15:34] Brandon what he said they're down the
[1:15:37] revelation 20 he takes the books and he
[1:15:40] opens the book the scripture says the
[1:15:46] small and great stand before God and the
[1:15:48] books were opened and another book was
[1:15:49] opened which is the book of life and the
[1:15:51] dead were judged out of those things
[1:15:53] which written the books according to
[1:15:55] their works yeah I imagine don't know
[1:16:00] where to start I don't know if we'll
[1:16:01] start with the first offenders I'm
[1:16:03] hoping to add an age or not to have
[1:16:05] covered or not but he'll start maybe
[1:16:07] there with a bow and well he able was
[1:16:09] resurrected we'll start with you okay
[1:16:10] two different ones like that and they'll
[1:16:12] begin being judged and brother Brandon
[1:16:14] said this I want to read this he said
[1:16:17] another book was opened which was a
[1:16:19] sleeping virgin and every man was judged
[1:16:21] us in the book he said you'll be asked
[1:16:24] and give a reason why you didn't believe
[1:16:27] and then what then you better know now
[1:16:30] he said you know better you might not
[1:16:34] I'm sorry you might not have noted
[1:16:36] before but you do now so brother houses
[1:16:39] Jesus going to ask you why didn't what's
[1:16:43] your reason for not being a part of the
[1:16:45] lines virgin he's going to ask you that
[1:16:46] he's going to ask all these because
[1:16:48] remember the bride is sitting with him
[1:16:50] here some type of a judgment seat and
[1:16:53] he's going to ask all those from the
[1:16:54] Attic age why didn't they believe the
[1:16:56] blood sacrifice did you believe it if
[1:16:59] not given or the course they didn't give
[1:17:01] me a reason and there they'll be judged
[1:17:04] and all those that are
[1:17:06] as the sheep will be separated to the
[1:17:07] right hand i'll say this side let me
[1:17:09] separate the right hand and all those
[1:17:10] that rejected it will be judged and then
[1:17:12] we separate to the left hand praise God
[1:17:15] fine and next all the Abraham page that
[1:17:21] weren't the wise version of Abraham's
[1:17:23] age they'll be brought form then their
[1:17:25] books to be read why didn't you believe
[1:17:27] this what was the reason you have for
[1:17:29] not believing it and then this one's
[1:17:31] that would be say to be saved and the
[1:17:33] ones that are lost to be lost then the
[1:17:35] mosaic age of those that are safe those
[1:17:37] are lost and then you have that last and
[1:17:40] final one which is the new now in the
[1:17:42] new we see when the scripture says Jesus
[1:17:46] will divide all those on the right and
[1:17:48] they'll say you on the right are the
[1:17:51] blessed of the lord because you've done
[1:17:53] good things unto me right you gave you a
[1:17:56] drink of water you visit me in prison
[1:17:58] you visited you gave me food gave it
[1:18:01] close it gave me shelter all these
[1:18:03] things like that and because of that
[1:18:05] you'll enter into eternal life hey
[1:18:08] mother knew you talk about scarcely
[1:18:11] saved amen scarcely the very last
[1:18:14] judgment they way they they didn't even
[1:18:16] receive it while they could have my life
[1:18:18] they waited to the last conference the
[1:18:20] white throne judgment they waited here
[1:18:23] to be given in journal I'd rather than
[1:18:25] receiving it right now when you man see
[1:18:27] how boring this have life now praise god
[1:18:29] church now but they're scarcely saved
[1:18:33] right before the final moments before he
[1:18:36] passed all these boats in the lake of
[1:18:38] fire they're scarcely saving their
[1:18:40] surprise Lord ha what do you mean when
[1:18:43] do we do this to you we never saw you on
[1:18:45] earth and he said when you've done the
[1:18:47] least of these my brethren you've done
[1:18:50] it unto me amen so we'll give up ask you
[1:18:55] to give a reason why if anyone's there
[1:18:57] at the light throne judgment they'll ask
[1:18:59] and be given the reason why didn't you
[1:19:00] receive the Holy Ghost why didn't you
[1:19:02] receive life why were you foolish for
[1:19:04] the time I gave you why aren't you wise
[1:19:06] in church let me say like this there
[1:19:08] won't be many good answers there let me
[1:19:09] know good answers there none right no
[1:19:12] good answers there hallelujah
[1:19:20] now at some point there let me go back
[1:19:23] to me back up a little bit to the days
[1:19:25] of two days of Jesus let's look back
[1:19:30] when the mosaic people were being judged
[1:19:32] in times of Moses remember what Jesus
[1:19:34] said who did Jesus say is going to rise
[1:19:37] up and condemn those Pharisees queen him
[1:19:40] south right the queen of the south so
[1:19:44] while Jesus judgment you know with those
[1:19:48] people of mosaic they said we trusted in
[1:19:51] Moses and Jesus said during that time
[1:19:54] the queen of the south will rise up in
[1:19:57] judgment and condemn this generation
[1:19:59] because she traveled three months across
[1:20:02] the desert right sorry just to hear the
[1:20:06] wisdom gift of salad adjusting hero
[1:20:08] wisdom of a man by the Holy Spirit she
[1:20:11] traveled three months to hear the wisdom
[1:20:12] of Solomon but behold of greater than
[1:20:15] Solomon is here amen so there will be
[1:20:18] examples of different people raised up
[1:20:21] now brother Brandon even said this I
[1:20:23] don't know if you know this or not but
[1:20:27] brother branham said that between the
[1:20:30] south will be rise up to condemn the
[1:20:32] United States I never heard that before
[1:20:35] sir mota who says between the South
[1:20:38] she'd be raised up to judge United
[1:20:40] States because they're greater than
[1:20:41] Solomon is here today because they
[1:20:45] didn't come to hear brother ran it right
[1:20:46] because they didn't come to hear the
[1:20:48] message to the hour they'll be judged
[1:20:50] the same because it was the son of man
[1:20:52] another thing a son of man on the little
[1:20:55] yacht they'll be judged mother have said
[1:20:57] the South be raised up in the generation
[1:20:59] the United States so she'll be raised up
[1:21:02] against the Pharisees under the mosaic
[1:21:03] as they believed in Moses before the
[1:21:05] boat Jesus Christ was a shed and
[1:21:07] everything like that but she'll also be
[1:21:09] raised up during the time the United
[1:21:11] States right and she will condemned
[1:21:14] United States because a greater than
[1:21:16] Solomon was sent to United States praise
[1:21:19] god I love that that's exactly right
[1:21:21] that's what Jesus said should be raised
[1:21:24] up to condemn this generation oh my let
[1:21:29] me see if I got everything here
[1:21:35] where he's got over so see that's what
[1:21:39] we look at this morning give all
[1:21:41] diligence to make your call election
[1:21:42] sure church any effort you can give to
[1:21:45] draw closer to God let's get it Carrie
[1:21:47] because they were condemned for not
[1:21:50] getting more effort not driving right
[1:21:51] this is that Nick is lucky but for us it
[1:21:54] would be driving so if we hear you know
[1:21:57] God's moving on us and do something or
[1:21:59] for us is mostly come to the church is
[1:22:02] be bigger than ever to go to church and
[1:22:04] being also God or if there's special
[1:22:06] meetings you feel drawn by the Holy
[1:22:07] Spirit and you feel God is really going
[1:22:09] to speak there you know let me know is
[1:22:11] if the pastor you know it but you need
[1:22:13] to follow the leadership of the Holy
[1:22:14] Spirit or he's God because the physical
[1:22:17] effort of the Pharisees will be
[1:22:19] condemned because they didn't go out to
[1:22:21] hear Jesus right because they didn't
[1:22:23] have diligence to go steer the man of
[1:22:26] God preachy hey man I'm so important
[1:22:29] about going to hear preaching that's
[1:22:31] where eternal life is that's where
[1:22:33] judgments are being issued praise God
[1:22:35] his judgment begins to the house of God
[1:22:37] and when we come house have got to be
[1:22:39] judged even though her judge were
[1:22:41] actually pardon in the same service
[1:22:42] because we repent of our sin come on but
[1:22:46] not there will be very few actually barn
[1:22:49] in there very few most will be under
[1:22:52] condemnation so that is the time so
[1:22:57] Jesus would call the atom covenant
[1:22:59] choose will call the Abraham Conan the
[1:23:00] mosaic come in and raise up witnesses
[1:23:02] I'll raise up this witness the race of
[1:23:04] that I magic Enoch could be raised up
[1:23:06] against his generation that's right each
[1:23:09] one all these different loads be raised
[1:23:11] up to condemn Theo's because they chose
[1:23:13] that to have life they chose not to
[1:23:17] receive life in their day oh my other
[1:23:21] new here what brother am say the wise
[1:23:23] going to say the foolish he's going to
[1:23:26] say you should have prayed up right
[1:23:29] Jesus will say okay wise merchant or are
[1:23:32] those that missed it Reverend you know
[1:23:34] they'll be there at the white throne
[1:23:35] judgment why did she receive the life
[1:23:37] God you should have prayed up and
[1:23:39] they'll be bribed numbers raised up and
[1:23:42] said we prayed up praise God we received
[1:23:44] life
[1:23:45] they'll condemn them because they did it
[1:23:47] do what God has told them to do jesus
[1:23:49] said knew two things right watch and
[1:23:51] pray that's that's what they're going to
[1:23:54] do and then pray open up as the bios
[1:23:56] said in Jude chapter one that if prayed
[1:23:58] the spirit enough to build up their most
[1:24:00] holy finish a man Olivia their faith
[1:24:03] wasn't raised high enough to really
[1:24:05] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost so
[1:24:08] there at the white throne judgment
[1:24:09] examples of race on broad numbers we
[1:24:11] raised up to condemn their testimonies
[1:24:13] their excuses well I didn't have time or
[1:24:15] all these things but these are those who
[1:24:17] prayed up they met that brings it down
[1:24:20] too hard a little bit by God's grace but
[1:24:25] can you imagine those that are scarcely
[1:24:26] saved why I went and visited this
[1:24:28] message believer when they were in
[1:24:30] prison and Jesus say because you did
[1:24:32] that enter into the joys of the Lord I
[1:24:37] fed this message believer they were sick
[1:24:39] or they were poor and I've met them food
[1:24:41] and because you were good to them jesus
[1:24:44] said you were good to me that's reality
[1:24:46] of it praise God didn't have any clues
[1:24:51] right like he said didn't have any food
[1:24:54] whatever you've got into the lease that
[1:24:56] he's my brother you've done it unto me
[1:24:58] glory then Jesus gives the rewards
[1:25:02] hallelujah nice that's right thanks dr.
[1:25:07] right amen ok now bow time says this is
[1:25:12] a revelation chapter 4 part 1 1960 he
[1:25:16] said tonight a blood lays on that throne
[1:25:18] it's a mercy seat for every sinner
[1:25:20] that's sinking mercy but on that day
[1:25:22] speak of the white throne judgment but
[1:25:24] on that day it won't be a mercy seat
[1:25:27] then it will be a judgment seat with the
[1:25:29] angry god setting there this isn't some
[1:25:33] nice calm god it's an angry god why
[1:25:36] didn't you do this why didn't you do
[1:25:37] that because we passed her mercy now his
[1:25:39] judgment right presents an angry god
[1:25:42] sitting there he said the righteous be
[1:25:45] scarcely say we're with a sitter ungodly
[1:25:47] appear you didn't redeem the time he's
[1:25:49] going to say right the wise redeem the
[1:25:51] time even when he comes to the cause of
[1:25:55] his Laura the balance will try to find a
[1:25:57] place to hide what are we
[1:25:59] the state or see what are we going to
[1:26:01] say that program what I didn't say then
[1:26:03] to Jesus when he's not happy he's not
[1:26:05] calling me that patient he's an angry
[1:26:07] god who's bringing judgment praise God
[1:26:09] what are we to say let's make our time
[1:26:12] right now by God's grace let's do what
[1:26:14] were called to do now by the grace of
[1:26:15] the Lord amen the last conference okay
[1:26:24] all right now let me close with this I'm
[1:26:26] not okay I'll write that about the time
[1:26:27] to post this is okay all right because
[1:26:29] this one we go through the last few
[1:26:30] quotes from the three kinds of believers
[1:26:32] I think me like I can move on now does
[1:26:36] anybody know x text for three kinds of
[1:26:38] leavers it was John chapter six when the
[1:26:42] many preachers left the message now
[1:26:47] brother Graham says this around the 22
[1:26:49] minute mark he said separation had to be
[1:26:53] done and brother brahim said two things
[1:26:55] brought separation from the real
[1:26:57] believer and the unbelievers and brother
[1:27:00] man said it was doctrine and prophecy so
[1:27:04] listen to that the afternoon Fox
[1:27:05] remember remember idyllic Scripture how
[1:27:08] do you preached Paul told Timothy if you
[1:27:09] preach the right doctor and you'll be
[1:27:11] saved doctors important Jesus are the
[1:27:14] preaching doctrine and saying that I am
[1:27:16] the bread of life you must eat my flesh
[1:27:17] and drink my blood right that's doctrine
[1:27:20] you must do this this is teaching you
[1:27:23] must do this you must a community he's
[1:27:25] preaching doctrine and doctrines
[1:27:27] separated but America this case
[1:27:29] separated the believer from the
[1:27:31] unbeliever he said but that make believe
[1:27:34] her hung around Judas I want you to see
[1:27:37] that doctrine is extremely important
[1:27:39] real natural brief supernatural power no
[1:27:41] doubt about that amen so i told people
[1:27:44] recently i've had people kind of attack
[1:27:46] need from that left the message to speak
[1:27:47] again i could get these emails cube and
[1:27:49] text people attacking me and I say you
[1:27:54] know I never could have deliverance from
[1:27:56] the evil things I used to do you know my
[1:27:59] drugs or whatever I did and the evil
[1:28:01] words and curses i used to do it all
[1:28:02] these things i never got deliverance in
[1:28:04] any other Church than a message church
[1:28:06] why because they're a murder can't
[1:28:09] deliver you it doesn't have the power to
[1:28:11] deliver
[1:28:12] you it's an old word right from an old
[1:28:14] generation it's not the fresh man of the
[1:28:17] word is that right hey did I suppose I
[1:28:21] said that's exactly right when I lived
[1:28:22] in the Presbyterian Church the main
[1:28:25] Church in Akron I never could get
[1:28:27] delivered from chewing tobacco never
[1:28:29] deliver from these things when I come to
[1:28:31] the message that's when the power was
[1:28:33] there he met a word came in power what
[1:28:36] was it different doctrine praise God as
[1:28:39] far as that the church as far as
[1:28:41] prophecy doctrine or proxy boat ramps
[1:28:42] that separate the bleep ruffed lemur the
[1:28:44] other church has no prophecy right we've
[1:28:47] got prophecy from a prophet of God who
[1:28:49] gave us the state the lower eyelid of
[1:28:51] you so I want to make sure i read that
[1:28:54] and you can look up at the quotes
[1:28:55] because three kinds of lemurs doctrine
[1:28:57] and prophecy separated all those seventy
[1:29:00] preachers from Jesus my brother ran to
[1:29:03] actually call those seventy creatures
[1:29:04] unbelievers I know if you do that
[1:29:06] actually call them unbelievers to they
[1:29:08] didn't hang around as long as you to sit
[1:29:09] he said the ones that hang around to the
[1:29:11] very end he said those are actually the
[1:29:13] make believers so that's all another
[1:29:15] okay i always all those pictures were
[1:29:18] make believers brother have dolls of
[1:29:20] unbelievers because as soon as doctrines
[1:29:22] hard to be a preacher that's what mother
[1:29:23] have said as soon as you freaks your
[1:29:25] doctor if somebody walks out the church
[1:29:26] he that's the unbeliever that's if it's
[1:29:28] the right doctor right oh man so I want
[1:29:32] to make sure i bring that with you oder
[1:29:34] einem said after a while you'll see
[1:29:36] which class your inner I want to bring
[1:29:37] that one up by the band then goes and he
[1:29:39] talks about real believers he talks
[1:29:41] about a job he said sometimes believers
[1:29:43] are put to the test not sometimes every
[1:29:46] time amen glory so Joe had to be tested
[1:29:49] and that's why you're being tested for
[1:29:51] the Jose that's why we're being tested
[1:29:53] we're being tested because we're true
[1:29:55] believers and brother man said God
[1:29:58] allowed it to temper joke right to give
[1:30:01] him a Mormon more he can handle more
[1:30:03] trials and brother and said this is so
[1:30:05] beautiful he allowed that to see where
[1:30:07] jobs treasures were amen story was job's
[1:30:12] treasures and his money or his family
[1:30:14] weatherman said no his treasure was in
[1:30:16] god that's why I never cursed God when
[1:30:18] he lost all the other blessings oh he
[1:30:20] said when you go through trials it shows
[1:30:23] where your treasures rats
[1:30:24] what do you treasure more you can SAT
[1:30:27] and give up because you treasure the
[1:30:28] earthly things you're lost or just keep
[1:30:30] your faith and gods that God I don't
[1:30:32] understand it but though you slay me
[1:30:33] that god I'll trust you then had so but
[1:30:36] I said every Christian goes through he
[1:30:38] tests every Christian every time in
[1:30:40] Scripture was Hebrews 12 every stuff
[1:30:43] that cometh to God must be tried amen
[1:30:48] glory he goes on to say this you must
[1:30:52] get in your place whether your mechanic
[1:30:54] or housewife he said no one can take
[1:30:56] your place don't you love that nobody
[1:30:58] can take your place this morning he said
[1:31:01] God has something for you to do you may
[1:31:03] have many heartaches and disappointments
[1:31:05] but we do not great to shun them but we
[1:31:09] pray for the lord to take us through
[1:31:11] that if they are set for me just give me
[1:31:14] grace to go through them praise God
[1:31:16] there's beautiful message my Olivia give
[1:31:20] me the grace to go through every trial
[1:31:21] the trials were so excited on the trials
[1:31:24] will show what I really believe the
[1:31:26] trials will show what I treasure the
[1:31:27] most treasured living a holy galley life
[1:31:30] you're serving God because I love them
[1:31:32] or die treasure the things I'm pleasures
[1:31:34] of this world and there's couple of time
[1:31:39] of molson but come to type of man said
[1:31:41] we're not going to spend much time on
[1:31:42] the other two classes he sent there
[1:31:43] because they're not important anyway
[1:31:47] they're not important anyway now that's
[1:31:50] been listen that's because God knows
[1:31:52] those but we don't know who's who so we
[1:31:55] must as our sister saying we must throw
[1:31:56] the highways and hedges praise God amen
[1:32:00] that's why I like the internet when I
[1:32:02] make those videos go to places where I
[1:32:04] can't go I can't travel never let nothin
[1:32:06] I got an email from a pass from the
[1:32:08] Netherlands saying oh it surely enjoyed
[1:32:10] your messages on the brother branham as
[1:32:13] a prophet he said they were like water
[1:32:15] to my thirsty so he said no he says I'm
[1:32:17] music to my ears as what he said he's
[1:32:19] there's so many people of all the way
[1:32:20] from the message criticize her brother
[1:32:22] branham he said it just really said it
[1:32:24] was such a wonderful thing to see how we
[1:32:27] stand with the word the messenger the
[1:32:28] hour I said praise God we're certainly
[1:32:30] staying with him because he stood for us
[1:32:34] now here's another one when the real
[1:32:37] truth Kane and the review came from
[1:32:41] Jesus to those 70 preachers he says the
[1:32:43] make believers or unbelievers always
[1:32:46] show their colors when the real preacher
[1:32:49] the doctor comes down the oxygen
[1:32:51] prophecy said separate twin a real truth
[1:32:54] or riverview comes to the people it
[1:32:55] always separated those that leave he
[1:32:57] said I make believers are unbelievers
[1:32:59] those instead of the real believers
[1:33:03] that's right and he talked about how
[1:33:08] Jesus preaching was too much for them he
[1:33:10] talked about how he was sent from heaven
[1:33:12] and he wasn't having a ball on the earth
[1:33:13] at the same time I go back to where I
[1:33:16] came from and how he was the bread of
[1:33:18] life you must eat eat my flesh and drink
[1:33:20] my blood and they couldn't have on that
[1:33:22] type of doctrine oh my and that brother
[1:33:29] adam says this I mean decision is he
[1:33:33] said the real believer does not question
[1:33:35] anything because it's written in the
[1:33:38] word and they just go on praise God so
[1:33:42] long as the real believer here's
[1:33:43] preaching and they know why don't know
[1:33:46] Jesse freaks out now for us now of
[1:33:48] course whether ramming listen program to
[1:33:49] any feature when you listen to them oh I
[1:33:51] know that's in the Word of God I might
[1:33:53] not understand it but I know it's God's
[1:33:56] promise I know it's in the Bible so I'm
[1:33:58] just going to go on believe it anyway I
[1:34:00] can't explain it i don't know all the
[1:34:02] details but because it's in the word a
[1:34:04] real believer believes it amen
[1:34:08] hallelujah the man said if it isn't
[1:34:13] written in the word just stay away from
[1:34:15] it no matter what happens how to do you
[1:34:19] amen no it is closed this is his altar
[1:34:23] call he said you cannot escape it you
[1:34:26] were I'm sure you are one of these
[1:34:29] classes he said you have to identify
[1:34:32] yourself with a Bible character that's
[1:34:34] why this morning went overlap and
[1:34:36] Abraham and the thief on the cross and
[1:34:39] Jesus and Judas we went over these so
[1:34:41] you can see which one you are praise God
[1:34:44] well there's that the word
[1:34:46] it always separates these three classes
[1:34:49] of people but we know later he taught
[1:34:50] for classes there are two classes of
[1:34:53] believers you can say it either way
[1:34:54] they're willing to work out he said look
[1:34:56] in the mirror or look at the Bible and
[1:34:58] see which one is you he says amen let's
[1:35:03] let us say to our feet by God's grace
[1:35:04] I'll stop right there how many can see
[1:35:09] two resurrections tonight everybody see
[1:35:11] that by God's grace we must we must
[1:35:14] strive as Paul said by any means we must
[1:35:16] not let anything hinder us we must
[1:35:18] strive to be a part of the first
[1:35:19] resurrection for Jesus will call for
[1:35:22] everyone who's not in the first
[1:35:24] resurrection and ask them why didn't
[1:35:26] they be prepared for the first
[1:35:28] resurrection why do they make it had the
[1:35:30] chance to do it amen now he says right
[1:35:39] here we are pictured here with one of
[1:35:41] these classes he said the only way to
[1:35:43] know it is test it with the word in
[1:35:46] brother grams altar call he said raise
[1:35:49] your hand if you want to believe all the
[1:35:52] words some do that tonight if you want
[1:35:54] to believe all the word tonight would

[1:36:05] message will sort of Judas but Judas
[1:36:07] didn't go all the way brother mam said

[1:36:15] further and brother evidence he said say
