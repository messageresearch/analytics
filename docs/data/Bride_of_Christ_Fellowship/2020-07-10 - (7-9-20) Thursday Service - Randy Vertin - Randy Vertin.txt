[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] see one more here we'll find our mother to come minister tomorrow you sing a song special but we're to sing a song he wrote what the Lord gave him the saying God's chosen seed brother remember brother any more first gave the song [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and try to run with it and make themselves something big but by the grace of the Lord we know it was His grace then lifted us up and put us in that place we didn't deserve it it's only it's only by his foreknowledge that by His grace he puts something in us he knew we would make the right choice and it's because he put a piece of himself in us a minute he can't do anything but make the right choice amen because it's him amen so brother Jesse asked you to sing this song so we'll see it by the grace of the Lord we're gonna sing unless your bride come for you all know that one do you have a specific key that you guys like to see you know all right then I'm just gonna start and I believe that the Lord has given you enough ability to keep on up because I usually don't know where I'm going with Tina so so it's just so good to be here and we'll just worship the Lord for just a minute and how many believe in getting in the spirit amen get in the spirit that's when we can receive something from God and then we can that's that's we have to get in that channel you know nowadays we get so many things maybe they go off too far on the carnal side of things or maybe go maybe even too far on the fanatical side of things but we want to take the Word of God understand that we want to give him real worship with worship with understanding we know where we stand we can worship in a way that the angels can't we've been worshiping the way that the rest of the world can't by the grace of God so let's just worship the Lord for a minute and we'll talk about Lord bringing his bride forth in this hour amen Jesus alone you always [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] lord thank you so much I'm just so blessed by the the gift that the Lord given in the instruments and everything like that you know I just you know I know brother Bram talked about you know maybe give somebody a rose now and instead of a bouquet when they're gone and I just I certainly appreciate brother Jesse you know he's always been such a humble individual and just genuine you can't mistake that and I believe his family exercises the same principles of humility and and all the wonderful things and just really seeking after the Lord and and you know I believe him being a pastor I believe the church will take on those same characteristics because those are the characteristics of Christ amen it's not because they're characteristics of brother Jesse per se but as Paul would say follow me as I follow Christ amen so that's what we want to do is regardless of what we do I find myself in a place that I have a zeal for the Jesus Christ I want to see him glorify you know in this world everything else is trying to be glorified everything however if everything you can think of is trying to exalt itself above the knowledge of God right and maybe just tonight I preached this message to the last couple of times I've ministered I've ministered this message but maybe if the Lord would allow I kind of had an inspiration in different direction but we'll see what Lord goes who want to be open to wherever the spirit would leave let's turn in our Bibles to Habakkuk chapter 2 if we'd all stand for the word and I've been ministering this a couple times and a couple different manners but we want to speak tonight on stepping into the vision and maybe just as a subtitle maybe to show where we're going and where if the Lord would leave that way we'll see I you pray for me I have I don't have a gift of studying per se if you see the way my notes look and the way inspiration comes it just seems so chaotic but you know I just trust the Lord we'll put it all together and you in your hearts and up here because it's not about me it's not about even the delivery we get so worried about delivery and the way it looks but if if the Lord could take an illiterate Kentuckian and break open and use him to break open the mysteries of the last day by the power of the Holy Ghost then certainly maybe he could the Lord would allow me to be a blessing to his people by His grace so let's see Habakkuk chapter 2 and then after this we're gonna go to 2nd Peter chapter 1 but the the maybe the the subtitle we want to speak on stepping into the vision and as a subtitle we want to maybe say a glimpse of the divine a glimpse of the divine we just want to keep that in our hearts and we've seen where the Lord would go I feel like that would be pleasing unto God that we would go in that direction and I will start at verse 1 in the book of Habakkuk if it's maybe hard to find but it's it's right near the end of the Old Testament maybe probably only about 15 to 20 pages before you get to Matthew it's right there and I'll just wait for everybody to get there maybe and and I know it's it's not always easy with the maybe the humidity pages sticking together and especially with me I start to sweat but you know what the Lord is gracious he's good you know and I I tell you what I I know you know just I'm so grateful to the Lord for His grace you know as I could go we could go along and long and I don't want to keep you long I know it's a Thursday night maybe an odd night to have service but I'm just so grateful to the Lord for the the people of God because in this hour that we're living in just to come to a service like this is a testimony and the devil off often will times make it seamless just a small thing but the scripture says who had despised the day of small things it may seem a small thing in the natural mind but to God it's a sacrifice it is it is it is worthy it's a it's a sacrifice it's your it's your it's your sacrifice of praise it's your sacrifice of your time and Lord knows as the day's grow evil it seems like our time seems less and less how much more of a sacrifice does it seem to maybe just give an hour or two on a Wednesday or today the Thursday or maybe four hours on a Sunday or something along those lines or a little bit of time every day to seek after God even just to think there meditate upon the Lord yes you know I think so many times we get caught up in the in the religiosity if I could say of certain things oh I have to be in this certain place at the certain time to pray no the scripture says pray without ceasing we can tell I can fellowship with the Lord on my job I can pray before the Lord as I as I exercise or I or I'm eating or I'm talking with someone else there's there's there's something in the Holy Ghost in inside of a believer that truly I believe it's just constantly crying out there's a constant poll you know and I believe tonight if you could just pull upon the word of God yes he can bring something down from the gates of heaven that would bless your soul give you exactly what you have Nina for the hour that you have needed yes and and maybe just a little taste of something here don't always get it in your mind of an expectation of how it should come right but just believe that it will yeah because he never promised you how necessarily things would come about but he promised that it would when he said when he said by his stripes you were healed it's already done now it could happen in an instant it could happen over years yes he didn't say how he said that it would Amen I just used as an example so let's read in Habakkuk chapter 2 verse 1 I will stand upon my watch and set me upon the tower and will watch to see what he will say unto me and what I shall answer when I am reproved and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak how many believed were at the end at the end it shall speak and not lie Amen the word can't lie amen though it Terry wait for it because it will surely come it will not tarry Amen and then we'll go to 1st Peter 2nd Peter chapter 1 we're in the end times I don't believe there could be any doubt about that oh you know I've heard so many disputations about what we like to call the message I just like to call it the Word of God revealed in our hour we like to give things titles that's ok no problem with that we got to you know but so many disputations about what we call the message and oh is he a true prophet and different ones rising up trying to dispute this and dispute that I could say just like brother Bram said you're a little too late for me I've seen too much I'm seeing too much of the word fulfilled before my eyes right now to doubt the Lord you know I just say thankful to the Lord Jesus I can't give him enough praise he deserves all of it he deserves everything that we have 2nd Peter chapter 1 familiar Scripture starting at verse 1 Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ now listen how he's even addressing this this isn't just anybody he says this is to them that it obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God in our Savior Jesus Christ how many of you have obtained to like precious faith amen I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them I've obtained like precious face so what does that mean that means these things right here apply to you they're not just for everybody out there but these apply to you so I like the first part grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according as his divine power had given us had given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these he might be partaker of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ they he that lacketh these things is blind that cannot see afar off and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things ye shall never fall Amen for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen let us bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord Lord is just truly every single time a humbling experience to be before your people your chosen Lord the ones that you've called and you've ordained in this hour predestinated to the adoption of sons and daughters by your holy blood Lord Jesus Christ that anointing Lord the Holy Ghost that sealed the believer into the kingdom Oh God Lord that comes and anoint your people for your purpose Lord and tonight we've come Lord we believe according to your purpose O God that you opened up a way to be here this evening Lord Lord not to speak anything of ourselves Lord but Lord we want to speak Lord maybe about the vision that you would have for your people in this hour of God the Word of God that's been given in this hour to your bride to bring us into a fellowship with you O God to make us partakers of that divine nature Lord Jesus Lawrence s we come this evening Lord Lord maybe just a small group at number Lord but spiritually speaking Lord how maybe tens of thousands of angels would be gathered here even now just because lord use lord wherever your people go Lord your presence goes with them Lord God and where two or three are gathered you're here in the midst Lord and Lord we're here for you we're here to glorify you though we're here to receive from you not from a man not from our thoughts not from our ideas Lord ideas or our ideas are useless but O God if you could just anoint us Lord if you could just take that Holy Ghost that dwells inside of us O God and anointed for your purpose Lord it would be beneficial to your people and it would prosper Lord we just prayer right now that you'd anoint your people anoint me Lord to get out of the way anoint your your children to get out of the way and receive what you would have for them this evening Lord and above all things let your perfect will be done tonight Lord Lord may we just see the mighty works of God done before us Lord Lord may you manifest yourself amongst your people Lord we love you and praise you and give glory to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated you know where I believe we all know we're living in the last days I don't think there could be any doubt about that you know and as we're talking about stepping into the vision as we read in Habakkuk there he said the vision is yet for an appointed time at the end it would speak and what it does speak it won't lie and we believe I believe as believers in this message in the revealed Word of the hour that we know we've received of there's a there's a vision that the people of God have been given to fulfill now the world has a vision for them we've heard it preached many times as it was in the days of Noah the earth was filled with violence through the the evil of the imaginations of man's heart continually and if we don't see that in this hour I don't know if there's ever been an hour there has been that way all they can think of is evil continually evil upon evil well while the people of God by the grace of God are building line upon line here a little there a little word upon word power upon power precept upon precept the world is building evil upon evil lust upon lust those worldly desires that they have why because they know nothing else but that nature they can't do anything else but that nature and if there's all easily swept up into that spirit why because there's there's a reason why it's because they have a vision that they have to fulfill in this hour they don't even know that they don't have a choice but to fulfill that vision why because they don't have they don't know the world they don't know that the truth of the scriptures they don't know the fact that God when he speaks he doesn't lie and he said it would be as it was in the days of lot that Sodom and Gomorrah conditions just wickedness just pure evil over and over again just worse and worse and worse evil seducers waxing worse and worse but see they don't even know but even then just almost like the dumb animals if I could say it that way like because anybody without the Holy Ghost is a brute beast and just like a dumb animal we've heard the press tell the story about the animals in India before the earthquake buy their stone walls and buy the different things that house even before the earthquake the Lord couldn't move upon just a dumb animal by instinct and have a move away why because he cares for his creation the Lord cares he jealous over his people he's jealous over his creation why that's why he's taking the time you wouldn't take the time six thousand plus years to come and cleanse the earth by water coming sanctify the earth by the blood of your only Son and then know that in a future you'll come in collects it with the only funny if you didn't care about it but God burners about his people he cares about this earth that we live but because he's going to bring it up fresh in a new born his people anyway he cares about it see God has got a vision for the earth and Satan has a vision for the earth we've got it eaten in his mind Satan right now making his eating come to pass before our very eyes and it's so easy to marvel because that group at the end time that bride that's as we just sing the song the bride that's coming forward is so small as it was in the days of Noah we're in eight souls were saved by water and we know by revelation that he was the type of the tribulation so even less than that with Enoch hey man but I think even said as Enoch prophesied the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his Saints amen I'm so glad I'm in that number hey maybe jehovah's witness has narrowed it down to get the 144,000 but i've got thousands and thousands and ten thousands of thousands so if i got no faith father guess I got to say I wanted to him amen yes sir but the world you know and I've been ministering this because it truly does smell me with a godly jealousy to see how easily the world can just slip right into that vision that the devil's got for them right they can go out to all their parties they can do all their drugs they can do all their immorality and different things and they don't even think twice because they've just given themselves over to a nature think about that they do it because they've given themselves over to a carnal nature what do we know God chose the man's heart Satan he went for the head right and worked and but what happened sin we know the scripture declares sin was condemned in the flesh and if you be filled with the Holy Ghost sealed away there's something as we like to say the inside of the inside something that you can't explain you know I've come to I've come to a realization in my life that I'm stop trying to explain God in any way because you cannot explain the supernatural you can't do it it was proven in the Garden of Eden you cannot force a revelation on someone by knowledge you can't do it the garden of eatin proved it evil brought forth the revelation a slain lamb Cain was jealous that the sacrifice was accepted but God not only being just and holy and in this day and age we like to use the word fair so fair not only gave Cain a second chance but gave him the blueprint without revelation he led him attempted enough carnivore and he proved what Feeny was because even when it was laid bare before couldn't do it and so is the world today and so many times we'll waste our breath trying to feed ourselves against the wall trying to reason somebody into the kingdom of God but really that battle comes out of your knees because it's a spiritual bed so long trying to fight toe-to-toe intellectually was Satan and you can't do it you can't even fight him intellectually with this Bible well because it takes the Holy Ghost to rightly divide the word because when Jesus was in the wilderness he said if thou be the Son of God command these stones to become bread if thou be cast thyself off and the angels will bear thee up lest at any time thou shalt cat dash thy foot against the stone repeating Scripture but yet the word itself could rightly divide the word amen because he wants to learn with you we've writers in the church age but kind of believe it was where he talks about you can taste the word and you can compare Scripture with Scripture and that is good there's nothing wrong with it we should starting to show ourselves approved as the scripture said here in Peter he said we should according as his divine power is given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him I believe that pertains to two intellectual as well as spiritual knowledge we ought to know these things the LORD commanded the children of Israel you know it's like brother Branham used to say like I'm not electing condoning ignorance not necessarily Oh we'll ever have to know my body no we may not be able to memorize it all but just like he said to the Israel find them before your eyes write them upon the post of your dog immerse yourself in the word these things are good but until the Holy Ghost rightly divides it your intellectual all well-meaning as it is your intellectual fighting will fall on deaf ears did not they do it to sting he could preach the word fully vindicated and what was it even intellectually they just stopped their ears and they killed the man that spirit is still alive and were beginning we're only beginning to see it manifested right now and you better believe it's only gonna get worse and if you think walk cry I'm not gonna have to suffer any of it you better think twice you better think twice because God has got to get us to a place where we look just like him and I don't know about you I can always speak for myself but I know on that there yet I can't speak for you that's between you and God but I know I'm not where I need to be yet but I know he's promised me why because he gave me a vision he gave when he gave me a revelation when they gave me the Holy Ghost in my life he gave me a vision of a rapture and I got to make it but because it wasn't me that look for it I wasn't looking for it but he gave it to me you can work yourself up into a vision all you want you can get yourself into your own carnal vision probably just the other leave you with one time at a carnal vision if I could say it this way you saw yourself as an NFL superstar I saw myself as the best fighter pilot that ever graced the skies you may see yourself and I'm especially speaking to young ones make sure you get a godly vision for your life because accepted be rooted in the Word of God and what he has for you now what someone else wants for you and it's got to line up with this but unless it be rooted in what he wants for you it'll come to naught and once you give receive that mission once you've received that I believe when you receive that Holy Ghost you've received it like whether some time you just got a glimpse of the divine you've just gotten a glimpse of it now the question is how do we go about it because I believe speaking positively and even if you don't I'm gonna speak it for you that we all got the Holy Ghost here amen I'm gonna speak it for you I'm gonna I'm gonna be positive right amen we got to be positive amen there's too much negativity in the world the world thrives on that now don't they they'd love to hear evil they love to hear bad reports they love to hear those things but we want to get a good we want to give a good report now but once you've received that vision now how do you go about it that's patience brothers and sisters patience so many times we get all revved up the Lord's given us a vision and then we run out presuming the Lord maybe gave you an idea of what Lord I want to do this you know brother and sister you're learning how to play music you've been just run out and try to play Beethoven's ninth right off the bat you might get discouraged you might give it up because you're upset because I couldn't do it right away but there's an order in a way if it's not wearing the natural and so in the spiritual that's why the scripture says lay on your ministry we got a lot of people I believe good hearts but there's a reason there's a saying that good intentions paved the way to hell because as good as your intentions are all the soup kitchens you can make all the Habitat for Humanity's you can build all the good works you can do like the kind old priest and it was at God's will for you to do it profits nothing not sure you may receive reward the Lord sent word brother Jason I were just talking about leaning a cup of cold water and his name won't be forgotten hey whatever you've done to the least of these you've done it to me I believe that what Jesus can say barely they have their reward but we've been called to something higher I believe that with all my heart we've been called to something higher we've been called to perfection we've been called to manifest Jesus Christ in his fullness as a bride maybe not just me not just you but the bride has been called to manifest the fullness of God in a multi majestic we've been called to manifest the fullness of God bodily it's just a multi-member body this time first time in Jesus Christ he was the fullness of the Godhead bodily but now in this day all that God was imparted to Christ all that Christ was reported to his church not just that's his people and he's looking he's got a vision and a purpose for your life that only you can fulfill and it has to be that way amen we know the story I kind of want to start here of how important this is we know the story maybe brother Branham told about the little baby that was sick and the Lord gave him a vision that the baby was going to be healed and it was in the house and this person was sitting over here and this other person over here and they brother Branham was going to come and pray for the baby who's going to healed it was thus saith the Lord because it was a vision and the visions don't lie so now he comes in he says brother I've seen a vision your baby's gonna be healed so it picks up the baby and prays for it the baby gets worse the mom starts crying I thought about it I mean could you imagine the stress that would have put him under he's got the vision he knows they never fail and then he realizes oh Lord I got ahead of it he forgot they were supposed to be this person here they're supposed to be other this person here and just to fast forward the story maybe a little bit we know how it ends the Lord gives him grace thank the Lord for a double portion of grace because even though many times we messed things up it's not God that ever messes it up it's us he's perfect we're the ones that messed it up too many times we're big it's easy to put blame everywhere else let's look in the mirror let's look in the mirror of God's Word where are we lining up where are we missing the mark if you can line up with this then we can get before the Lord maybe and say Lord let's find out where that ink it is or where this or that so get things right but let's look at ourselves we get out of that vision why because maybe we're moving too fast we didn't wait on God just like brother Branham in this case but he waited God had Grace and what was it what's every bit remember in the vision all things have to be in their place for the vision to come to pass that hat had to be move over here that lady with the glasses had to be sitting here brother Branham remember he got up because the one person had to be sitting in the chair he was in but what was it it was showing that God hasn't ordered two things he's got a place what is that you've got a place for you to be and the vision cannot proceed without you in that place that's how important you think about Moses he knew he was the deliverer he had a vision of what he was and said he was born a proper child he knew that he was a deliverer he looked upon the affliction of his brethren in Israel dump it in the mud pits and his heart yearns so much so that he did a great act if you look at in the natural he made a great sacrifice he esteemed the riches of Christ greater riches than those of Egypt he could have taken the easy way I'm here to tell you tonight that it's time we took the harder way it's time we took the harder way we've been coasting way too long it's we've got it too easy I'm not saying go out there break your armor you know burn your house down to make it difficult no but it's time we made the difficult choices if the things in my life that are borderline are there ideas that I have about myself if they're a vision that I've given myself for my life that maybe doesn't line up with what God's got for me we've got to get out of our mind and get his buzz it's the only way we can do this if Jesus Christ the Word made flesh had to die to his own desires you say oh he had another desired yeah the scripture study game he said eyes would that this cup pass from me he was literally and strike you understand how powerful that is he was literally expressing a natural desire that was contrary to what God he knew God wanted for him and yet the cemani the pressing the squeezing will it bring out in front of victory for you and me but we can conquer our own desires that we could be honest with ourselves place it before God and get victory have you ever really thought about that explaining new talk about someone who knew the vision what if I told you that in three days I'll race this temple back up after you tear it now and many things to the exhort about how Christ must suffer and rise again on the third day we know those scriptures he knew where he was going and yet it's the cemani the flesh remember brother Branham said the anointing left him he was left to be a man and yet the grace of God to show that he could get victory bruss by a lutea over our own desires well the brain can say we can all say our greatest enemy it's Randall Burton the greatest enemy is Jesse Smith Malachi Smith only it's ourselves why because the flesh worth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh sin I've always missed the island this is how I mentally think about Sid condemned in the flesh sin literally by the grace of God was trapped in this flesh it can't it can't do anything but try to get out express itself through the flesh it's trying to push itself out meanwhile the Holy Ghost in your heart it's trying to push itself out one the flesh trying to push itself into your heart the Holy Ghost trying to push yourself out of your heart into the world to express Christ where do they meet they meet up here the battlefield one trying to get in the other one trying to express out now the question is what do we have to do we have to die yes to our own ideas our own thoughts you have to die to every natural sense that you have that's not just sight taste feeling hearing and smelling it's not just those it's your memory it's the it's the spoon what we call the sensitive the spirit memory conscience affection reasoning imaginations those things but you happen to die to all of them because the only thing that pleases God is faith well faith is impossible to please him that's why it's the only sense that matters it doesn't matter and it makes no difference what you can see what you feel what's your memories are what your own affections are what's your reasoning zone those all have to die no exceptions because they will do nothing but exalt themselves above God if you give place to them now I've said it before many times if it lines up with the word well that's wonderful we can go with it yes it's my affections line up with the word I love the people of God I love his word I love to be in service yes I love to sing the songs of Zion yeah you know if my imaginations are imagining how much greater I could serve the Lord when I'm over on the other side if my imaginations are imagining how how great we'll be able to just praise God over there what it's going to be like when we're walking those those streams and walking the streets of gold those are the kind of imaginations we can get behind if you're if your reasonings are to come let us reason together the Word of God let us talk together and just marvel at the that the depth of the even the intellectual knowledge of the scriptures that's that's the kind of reasoning I can get behind but as soon as it makes a turn away from the word it must die no exceptions because there will be nothing but perfect love which is God over there there won't be anything that you could be tied to that's why I say to you right now get all your own ideas out of the way that doesn't even just have to do with with the word as far as as far as understanding we know that because we can't understand it all by ourselves but I'm even I want to bring it down to a real-life level your everyday life what we call our future if we have much of a future I don't think it seems like we go on much longer but I thought that 10 years ago and it gets worse and worse but the Lord's grace is so great Thank You first grace as long as much as I longed to get out of this world and this this garbage dump that people call amazing but it's horrible you know what if we're here it's for a purpose there's more grace to be given there's more seats to be reached let's thrust in the sickle for the harvest display yes oh man there may not be a lot of seats left we may be doing a lot of net casting and then a lot of casting back but we're gonna find the ones we need to a man I'm glad I'm one of Hamelin glad I kept the year 2000 didn't scare all the believers away cuz I didn't come too low Jew amen praise the Lord we've got to get our own ideas out of the way and this has to do with your very life what are your life's ambition what is your life goals well I want to learn this I want to go to school for that I just I rely mainly because brother just he got so many young ones but I such a pull on that the younger side especially you ones that are getting just a little bit older you certain understand I understand that maybe we had some receipt the Holy Ghost here recently and some meetings that you had praise the Lord for that that's the first step that's a great thing no let's take that and grow in Greece let's let's let's start those virtues those virtues start to be built in you and it's not going to be easy because everyone's a battle everyone to fight the Lord's good at lemmings come along in your life they are going to expose your weaknesses and it's gonna you know what's gonna bring up it's gonna be good prize cuz you don't want others to see that you've got this problem and that's one of the things that devil really fights the people of God because what does the scripture say confess your faults one to another and pray one for the other but we won't do that because we won't admit it but there's pride and a lot of it is fear that others will judge you why because maybe they don't have love that they ought to have and you you try to confide in a brother or sister and they say oh you should leave a brother Raymond told me that's wrong is that right that's not the Spirit of Christ charity covers the multitude of sins hey man a man if it's wrong to go dig up a faith seed when you planted it then it's wrong to dig up sins when they've been cast in the sea of forgetfulness you make out a liar will you do that Gutzon I don't remember they never did and you try to bring it back in so it's fresh shave idea what it would do that I don't know where that came from but that was I believe that wasn't gone we got it we have to have loved one for the other the devil tries to put so much pride in there and fear and but the Spirit of God cast love casts out fear would it have to be fearful of that you know why because we ought to have a humility we ought to have a humility of where we came from [Music] I remember I think there's brother Brooks who said this before or maybe someone else but I really like the saying and I've used it in my prayers so many times I say Lord they might have even been sister Karen Sanders I think it might have been may I heard it from someone though they said Lord let me humble myself before you because Lord I don't want you to anbu me that's powerful to me more make us humble full of humility meek and lowly put ourselves in the lowest place why because without him you're nothing without me you can do nothing you can do nothing except you abided by otherwise if we if we could let that thing grow what'd he say it'll put forth another book of Acts behind and that's what we're looking for we're not looking for excuses we got a vision before us brothers and sisters you have a God has a vision for your life God has a vision for each one in here for your life individually the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the Lord God has a vision for you and you need to find it you need to find what it is you need to make your calling and election sure you need to find your place in the body brother Jesse can't do it why because he is also searching for his perfect place he's been put as a pastor but every every little bit of our lives is part of that vision see the Lord doesn't do anything halfway it's not just well he's not a he's not a master builder or a carpenter that's a on quarter inch off is okay no the Lord expects perfection his people will be there in their spots in the post of duty remember the vision onward Christian soldiers marching as to war with the bride just in lockstep what was at the end it started drifting what do you scream get back in line I believe with all my heart that's where we're at right now I believe that there are people ministers that are going to be telling the bride to get back in line because whether we know it or not there's something wrong there Scott there's we've gotten out of a vision some way brothers and sisters because when I read the vision when I listen the vision it was made I had this little thing that the Lord kind of gave to me I thought it was kind of cute maybe if I could see it that way we all have but maybe the app on the phone book called the table and I read that scripture of Habakkuk is his make the vision plain and write it upon tables I said we all got tables the vision has been made plain upon the tables a prophet was said to make the vision plain and what are we gonna do he that readeth let him run but what is the vision tell us the vision tell us that don't care what anybody tells you if the vine puts forth another branch it'll write a book acts behind it the vision tells me that it will be Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the basic tells me that the works that I do shall he do also and greater let me show you you the vision tells me that we are to be partakers of the divine nature the vision tells me that I was predestinated before the foundation of the world to come to these things anything country to that vision is wrong why because it's it's been vindicated it's been revealed to us now the question is how do we make it work we get in our places he caught we caught we've called it the God's great timepiece God's great prophetic clock you try to put one gear or one spring out of place in your watch and see if it doesn't die instantly it won't work one person other place in this vision and it will not work as intended and we can't make it we can't get out of here until everyone's in their place we can't do it amen so what am I telling you that for he didn't say you know it sounds all brother it seems almost hopeless there's so much to it no but it's His grace that will do it and what if it's prayer it's getting on your knees before God it's going to agus ebbing for yourself it's going to a place where God can just press all of your own desires out of the way where God can just press all of your own attributes I don't want Randall Burton to exist anymore I want to be excel to express Jesus Christ that is what I want to see I want to be so yielded such a prisoner to God that is his very his very least designer is my greatest ambition hey then what he's worthy of it he's worthy of it he's given us everything it's what coin it's a reasonable sacrifice it's a reasonable service to give ourselves as living sacrifices unto God to obey is better than sacrifice yes but did you know obedience is a sacrifice obedience if sacrificing your own will for someone else's yes for the Jesse since brother Malachi I need you to help me out in the garden today the mouth kiss says no and I want to go eat that whole ball of mozzarella cheese I was watching how much you're enjoying that brother I said I can I could agree with that that's good let's hear there's nothing wrong with that well I wanna I gotta eat I gotta do this I gotta do that but the sacrifice of yes sir I'll go help you thank you that's my father's will it's to help him in this endeavor sacrificing your own desires upon the altar to fulfill the wishes of the Father that's what God wants for his people we can try all we want to to do things our way Moses tried to do it his way he just ended up with a stinking Egyptian in the sand and run it away from the presence of God one day he caught a glimpse of the divine one day he saw a bush that burns but wasn't consumed then all of a sudden things changed yes now he used to think I'm a great military man I could teach the Egyptians wisdom I was born to be a deliverer I will do this in the power of my own might - I can't even speak how would they even hear me why God had taken 40 years in the wilderness to squeeze to press to beat all of that Moses thought great about himself out of it until the only thing left was a shell to the point where Moses said I can't even speak I can't I can't do this and I can't do that and the Lord says if I could maybe paraphrase it this way the Lord says it doesn't matter because I've come down to deliver them I'm sending you but you're just a vehicle for me that's what we want for us so send are you that's the same way you say Lord I can't do it that's the point that's the point I'm jealous to give ploy to Jesus Christ because you're giving glory to everything else we've living glory to our sports we're giving glory to our politics we've given glory now to our economy and to our healthcare system to all these different things I dare say we've given glory to a prophet above God no wonder the Lord allows things you don't think the Lord allowed these believe the sign and nonsense to come up the Lord allows these things just to prove that he's in control that it doesn't matter how much you know it's by faith by grace not by knowledge net but power not by life but by my spirit and you won't stand if it's based on intellectual knowledge it can't happen God won't allow it to happen he proved in the garden as we said earlier that it can't happen it'll express itself but what it can't help but do that but I want you to know brothers and sisters it's gonna be a harder way yes it's not gonna be easy and it's time we got it out of our heads that it's going to be with it's time we separate it you know what I don't think we've completely separated from Leo to see a coin yet maybe we have spiritually in many ways but I feel like maybe mentally intellectually our own reasoning abilities we're still in Laodicea with the idea of oh you know and I praise the Lord the Lord you know the Lord went Lord allow me to write that song God's chosen seed he gave me the last few verses of that song in about 15 minutes when I was driving on the on the road to go to church in Iowa it was just the grace to go but if we're not careful we get so lifted up we're God's chosen seed we're God's chosen seed and these things are true but it on a humble us it sometimes so many times it has the reverse effect it on earth in order to humble Isidoro if we could really see the magnitude of it I believe we maybe aren't seeing the real magnitude of what we've received because knowledge puffeth up yes sir but revelry if you died believe if you have revelation brothers and sisters it'll-it'll humbly I'll bring you to a place where you see where you were well you see where you should have been no it's tough we got a lot of pop out chest anymore I've called it for a long time years now I've called it bride pride there's a lot of people with pride pride I'm bride I'm bride I'm bride you know talked with different ones that maybe back in their old days were a little more rough and tumble and would like get into fights and stuff and they said you know how you know the weakest one in the room so when that talks a lot and the one that's got to tell you about how great they are I think that might apply to a lot of Christians we got so-called bride well I'm the bride I'm the bride I don't know who you're trying to convince all right are you trying to convince yourself sure are you trying to convince me because it's between you and the Lord I'll believe Farida you but I believe I believe so much in humility humble ourselves let's get bringing ourselves logo before him amen there's the only one but it's gonna be hard it's not going to be easy Abraham and lot when they had a dispute ation between their their sheep herders and Abraham said let's go you go right I'll go left you go left I'll go right you choose your way locked he looked at the easy way he looked at the glimmering and the the shimmering of Sodom and Gomorrah the scripture said how it was well watered it was it was bountiful and and looked nice and easy now Abraham had been given a vision from God of what to expect of what he was to inherit but he didn't know he's know how it was gonna come he made his mistakes he tried to bring it himself through Hagar listening to his wife and say well let's try this maybe the Lord wants to do it this way wasn't being patient but in this case Abraham was very patient he says lied I'll let you choose you go this way I'll go that way yes and so lot pitched his tent towards Sodom and Abraham said okay I'll just go the other way not really thinking anything and what if the Lord do the Lord came right back in sinner you look north south east and west look at the stars of the sky that's your inheritance it may not have been easy for it happy easy life you know Sarah didn't get to have all the easy conveniences in Sodom and Gomorrah didn't have the fanciest clothes I guess a for you ones that are coming up a Vantage of schooling maybe didn't have the the most prestigious of careers because the devil really works on that nowadays I say especially to the sisters I feel like really gets that career-minded because we're in that feminist stage if I could say I mean that's just the way it is go through the scripture and it follows that feminist age you go read the book of Esther and look at vash tonight how pumped up she was King tried to call her into a banquet and she said I'm gonna take on my women I'm goin over here I'm taking all my churches I'm that's a feminist spirit yeah that's a puffed up spirit you better be careful about that then that goes that's for the church getting that puffed up spirit well I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna do that how about if the Lord will we shall do this or we shall do that amen amen that's the vision for the people of God is to walk in his ways walk according to his will sacrifice your will on the altar amen amen Moses he went the harder way he may have put a little more on himself that he needed to by trying to manifest it in his own way but he's still forsook all of Egypt stealing the riches of Christ greater riches you may have to forsake everything that you think it's gonna accomplish you something in this world it doesn't matter it's all gonna burn anyway we're seeing kovin 19 chucked on the economy for a month two months three months the stock market dumps down by thousands and yet we had 30 million people unemployed and the stock market went back up I'm not an economist but that seems a little fishy and if it was if our prophet told us that it was all on faceless ground back then where are we at now brother I believe we're just we're just waiting we're just waiting for that that little Catholic Church and this year just come sweep on in and come do whatever they're gonna do their work and even now don't you worry they're doing their thing they're doing what they're doing they have a vision they're gonna fulfill their vision God's got a vision for the people of God God's got a vision for that don't don't let these trials and tribulations you know we go through seasons we've all gone through seasons where we maybe lose that vision a little bit of brother branham called it the eagle eyes get filmed over here let's just stand I won't hold you any longer we're gonna close in this maybe just give you a just give you a little encouragement you know because the Lord the Lord is gonna perform it it's not gonna be by your power but the people of God have to determine in our hearts in our souls that we won't serve anything else it's only gonna be by His grace that we can do that yes but we have to come to that place we have to make voice there's got to be a choice made faith or unbelief those are the only two you've got two spirits the Spirit of God in the spirit see you choose you this day whom you will serve and it's not gonna be easy it can't be easy because Jesus didn't go the easy way he could have had the wife the house the picket fence we called nowadays all these luxuries that we could have had but no he said the son of man has no place to lay his head even Paul said having therefore food and raiment let us be contended and even say anything about having shelter we think we got a right to a house he said you got food and clothing you ought to be happy with that why because not even Jesus had a place to leave but thank the Lord we have those things we'll take it as long as we can by the grace of the Lord is long and then once the devil says we gotta line up with this thing to keep it well then that's alright I'll move on out the Lord will provide but don't feel discouraged brothers and sisters if if those eagle eyes maybe film over the Lord's given us a fishing I believe he's given it to you he's given it to you give it maybe we don't know everything of where we're supposed to be yet remember he gives you that land little by little little by little not all of the people not all the tribes were placed immediately in the land yes it was over a period of time yes what do we do in the meantime we fight for each other we'd fight for each other's ground we come together the more we fight harder for our brothers and sisters we we get on her knees that's where a battle has to take place as we get on our knees we die to ourselves what because Christ the Lord Jesus didn't live for himself he didn't live for himself he said he said I sanctify myself for theirs do you ever think about that that's eternal life we talk about all the eternal life is living for others you don't you say well I want to sanctify my life so I can get something from God well I want to say to find my life for that as well but I want to say to find my life so you can get something from the Lord it does God forbid that my life would hinder the work of God for you and we know that that will happen right but he's gonna do it for his people yes we got a week see the vision I didn't get a chance to look for the quote but I believe in brother Jesse Oh correct me if I'm wrong but I believe brother Branham talked about kind of giving like a metaphor for that healing of how you had that vision of that well person before you and what do you do you just walk one step at a time towards that well person it's the same way for your spiritual well person your spiritual well-being it may not happen overnight we've got expectations of how we think things ought to come let's make let's get our expectations out of the way and have just him as our expectations let's make him our expectation Lord I don't care how you do it but let it be just like Mary according to thy work why she didn't understand it she even kind of questioned how can these things be but in the end you know she said she cast reasoning aside said just let it be according unto me according to that word o God that's what we want yes that's what we want Lord let it be a court let the vision come in my life let me walk according to the vision you have for me let me find my place in this vision where I will be at my post of duty and then maybe the cogs of Bride of Christ fellowship start to churn a little harder they start to turn a little more with purpose maybe maybe you start to see one speaking in tongues maybe you start to see a miracle happening over here maybe you start to see a visitation of angels killing a father you say oh that's fanaticism well that's only because we haven't seen it like we ought to brothers and sister because my vision that I received for our day says that that is the inheritance that is the heritage of God's people and we can't stop until we reach that because that's ours I don't know how he's going to do it quite frankly I don't care if I could say it that bluntly because all i care is that he is glorified is that his word comes to pass in my life I want to see it come to pass in your life if and just this last little thing you know he's got he's got a vision for you each individually he's got the Lord Jesus as a vision for Bride of Christ fellowship in Akron Ohio as a body and then he's got a vision for his bride worldwide amen I may not know other details about it we don't need to know all the details about it you know we can get caught up in that it's so easy we want to know what everything's going on we like to be in the know we're in the information age right we like to know we like to know we like to see what's going on but what did the Lord say to Peter Peter said Lord what shall this man do I want to know inquiring minds want to know he said what is that to thee you follow me amen let's just purpose that in our hearts Lord let me not worry about what the rest of the world's got what the rest of the world's gonna do let me not even necessarily worry about what you're gonna do when and this person is gonna do the Lord let me find my place in this vision that you've got for me and then when I find it let me get there and stay there so that the the the purpose of the vision can come to pass amen I believe he's got it for his Saints I believe it with all my heart we're seeing that time approaching amen we're seeing that time approaching and you know I'm just grateful to the Lord and I apologize this maybe I was a little long or short I I never really know how these times go but I'm just grateful to the Lord Jesus for His grace I'm grateful then that cap stone came down crying grace grace because I am a witness that I need a double portion but he's got it for us all man let's just maybe bow our heads maybe you know out there you know in the look group that we have here tonight you know with with everybody with their heads bowed maybe you would say Lord Lord maybe I've had an idea of what your vision is for me Lord a heart efficient Lord you've given me a glimpse of divinity of the divine you've given me just a glimpse of the divine give me the Holy Ghost the revelation of this word experience with you to see where you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
