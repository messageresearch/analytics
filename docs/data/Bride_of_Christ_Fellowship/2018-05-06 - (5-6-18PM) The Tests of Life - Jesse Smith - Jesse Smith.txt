amen thank you Lord Jesus amen amen let's just open up our Bibles here let's just do the Bible study here tonight by God's grace I didn't have enough time to finish part two of the revelation 4 so I do have a Bible study ready for tonight by God's grace I think that's a three hour sermon so I got most of it done but I didn't get the last half hour so so let's just open up to job 23 tonight I mentioned this morning how God will leave believers and test them so I think I'll just do that Bible study tonight by God's grace kind of centers around Jobe and Hezekiah so no doubt some familiar things but I'd like to go through the scriptures there and teach this here tonight by God's grace I mean a feeling a lot stronger here physically and with brother Simon helping me out and then get a little weekend away I feel a lot better I feel my voices back and feel stronger by the grace of Lord so thank God for that job 23 that's got to make sure my wife's like you know she gives me some wisdom she's like Jessie just don't sing so hard at the end but you know I get so happy with the word I just want to bail it out and be like you got to take it easy on your voice it's so hard didn't it brother it's so hard I just forget about taking care of myself job 23 8 and I know brother branham he was song leader pastor treasurer deacon for 17 years I've done it for I've done it part of the time for 12 years so I'm catching up but there's got to be faithful and I gotta use wisdom by the grace of the Lord laughing and Happiness because I know God takes care of his children just joyful joyful tonight job 23 so I like to just call this the test of life and we'll probably you know go a little deeper later on like I said I like to preach a series on God's purpose for our lives but this is kind of like leading into that I imagine cuz I just like I said didn't have time to finish revelation 4 part 2 so we look at this here cuz I did have I think I had I think I studied on this for four hours on the plane out there to California to studied on this thought and so we had a lot of good scriptures we'll go through tonight and I'll try to finish in about 40 minutes or so okay so job 23 just a real striking scripture here verse 8 how many no job was perfect god looked down you see a perfect man there and that he says these words because we know he's in the midst of the test of life so let's look at that and like I said I kind of feel like I can relate to Joe but that right now and I'll talk a little bit more about that but I kind of feel similar of course not to the extent I was thinking the Lord this morning thank you that don't have boils and you know thank you that my children I was just weeping and you know before the Lord this morning thank you for my wonderful children my family and the job and you know because God took everything away from job except his health and I was just thanking the Lord I know I'm in a test right now but I'm thanking God it wasn't as extremists job because we all go through tasks and trials you know drove 23:8 look at these inspired words behold I go forward but he's not there Joe was trying to go forward in the Lord but you don't feel that you don't feel God there and backward but I cannot perceive him yet he was perfect according to God on the left hand where he doth work but I cannot hold him so he just couldn't have that that fellowship that anointing like he wanted to there's that striking he hided himself on the right hand but I cannot see him let me know sometimes God hides himself verse 10 but I love this but he knoweth the way that I take a man I can't seem to get a hold of him but I know he's watching over me I know he's watching the steps that I take this is just this is such a beautiful portion of Scripture and when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold job was mature enough to know this is just a test God has hidden himself from me for a little season but once this is all over I'll have more love for him our more confidence verse 11 my foot hath held his steps his way have I kept and not declined neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips I have esteem the words of his mouth more than my necessary food hmm I just have one more word of Prayer futures haven't eaten your heart just maybe lift your hand make it unto God Heavenly Father these hands have defied gravity Lord we need you spiritually we're reaching up to heaven Lord God speak to us today Lord God we're grateful for your mercy we're grateful for your grace Lord just speak to us through your word today encourage us Lord we know you're with us Lord watching our every steps you'd said you never leave us or forsake us Lord we just look to you Lord tonight - Lord minister to our hearts and needs in Jesus Christ's name the church said Amen god bless yous bein seated there praise God so let's look at this I just like to call it tests of life tonight and my actual inspiration I was so shocked to read this scripture but let's go to second chronicles 32 I don't have any slides sorry I just haven't had enough time and get slides with a real busy week at school and I just didn't have much time to get to the slides and yesterday we went to brother John's house to celebrate his graduate graduation with his master's degree so that kind of took a little more of my time but I knew I had the scripture I knew I studied real hard on this this lesson for hours so uh yeah second chronicles 32 31 and so this was one of those moments you know God knows my heart I read this scripture and it felt like the Holy Spirit just gave me such a fresh unction such a fresh anointing on my heart 32 31 this is speaking of Hezekiah how many know he was a godly King one of the few godly kings of Judah member there was no godly Kings in northern Israel not a one of them but there was a few in Judah because the kingdom divided after Solomon Judah of course means praise so the the part of the country that had praise had a few good Kings Amen so verse 31 howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon who sent unto him to inquire of the Wonder that was done in that land God left him to try him that he might know all that was in his heart and that something that just about made me cry when I read that I'm like is that in the Bible and look church I've had to underline and highlight it for like years I probably had this highlighted for like seven years and it's like it's like I never had read it before that God and no doubt he was a godly King he was one of the Kings that said Hezekiah was one like David and did all that God desired has a Kai's life he was the highest quality of believer for his day he was a man just like David the Bible said and yet towards the end of his life God left him in for it to try him to see what was in a heart and you probably member the story you know he opened up his storehouses in the treasure house of the Lord and he let these Babylonian UNIX or princes or forget whatever they're called come through and look and it was a moment of pride he got lifted up in Pride and and then God of course you know told him you know you're gonna pay for this not in your lifetime but the next generation will pay for that because we know we don't cast our pearls before the swine how many know that we don't let you know in this case in our case you know we wouldn't share our wonderful treasures of God with people that are just gonna trample upon it you know God knew those Babylonian princes would just go back and they would trample on it they weren't interested in serving God so seeing you know seeing all the furniture pieces the Ark of the Covenant whatever they had in those day the candles it wasn't gonna mean nothing to them and so has a kind his pride just let him see it and they were gonna stamp or stamp upon it and this that don't mean nothing to us and and the Bible said that Hezekiah was gonna pay for this and he did now remember he had made a false step a little earlier as well so if you go back up to verse 24 you'll see his this is really his first ball he had two false steps we'd say two times he missed the will of God a church of we can go through our lives and say we just missed the will of God twice in our lives we'd be pretty pretty pretty happy right did we know brother Branham missed it in South Africa you know the whole country would have been given to him and he lied to the IRS you know we all make mistakes but if they're going to be two times I missed God's will I'd say hallelujah but that's all the repr Bible records about Hezekiah but look up in verse 24 in those days Hezekiah was sick to the death and prayed unto the Lord and he spake unto him and he gave him a sign remember the Bible says here it was better got it was God's perfect will to take Hezekiah but he asked for more time and look what look what it says verse 25 but Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him so God gave him a benefit of extra time but he didn't do wisely with that benefit in other words God answered his prayer but Hezekiah really didn't keep his part of his promise to God he see and then therefore there was wrath upon him upon Judah and Jerusalem look at that he said God remember he has such a sincere prayer God give me 15 more years you know I've walked in the integrity of my heart but it was God's will to take him at that time but God looked down and isn't God so merciful church even we asked for the wrong thing sometimes right he'll even give it to us if we just ask sincerely if we're just sincere and so God gave him this extra time he told Isaiah go back and tell him thus saith the Lord you got 15 more years to set your house in order but he should have went at the time God called him huh me know God's first word is the right word to see look at verse 26 it goes on to tell us more about this notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart both he and the habitants of it Jerusalem so that the wrath of God came out up upon them in the days of Hezekiah so see he kind of chose this is a interesting case here where God prolongs somebody's life for the in the permissive will of God because it was God's perfect will to take him at that time and so he made a false step there he didn't give God the glory should have and he kind of wasted that extra time that he asked for oh god help us to redeem the time God help us to do what we promised God were gonna do as the Chi mihn stit the Bible said pride and then during that 15 years as we said he cast his pearl before the swine and these you know Babylonians come in and they walk out and and they had no business being around those holy things how many know that they weren't holy right they they're not supposed to touch those things those were all for the sons of Levi right the kohathites were to pack those things but here he does something he should not have done but I just you know that's that's a lot to say this but in verse 31 God left him to try him so God knew he asked for the wrong thing but God in His mercy gave it to him anyway because the Bible said he'll give us a desire of our heart we must make sure our heart though is lined up with God's desire and not just well I've always one of this you know brother so-and-so our sister so and so I've always wanted I trust God will give it to me well let's make sure that's what God wants you to have first because the heart is deceitful above all things who can know it we got to make sure we love God with all of our heart soul mind and strength amen so I thought that you know what would bless you I hope that's a blessing to you and it really blessed my heart God left him a godly man a faithful man God left this godly man to try him and that sound familiar like job that sounds just like job's let's go to job chapter one again we'll just go over that again real briefly job chapter one look at verse eight all these are beautiful words here my if only God could all could call all of us perfect how many would like that God calls Joe perfect it wasn't Jobe saying I'm perfect it's God saying he's perfect Oh that's the kind of company that's the kind of words I once said about me if it means but be God's will Oh hallelujah verse eight and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and upright man one that is fear the Lord fears God and ask you is evil amen what a great testimony Jobe had praise the Lord now I just had a thought that came to me hope maybe hold your spot there and let's go to a Zechariah chapter three I believe it is Zechariah right before Malachi throughout the end of the Old Testament not sure the last time I preached this maybe it was recently but I hope it's a blessing to you I just yeah Joe I'm sorry Zechariah chapter 3 verse 1 now this is speaking of Joshua the high priest in the days of Hezekiah a Haggai and Zechariah so in the days when the days when they were zoomable had come back you know from Babylon and they're real rebuilding the the house of God and all these things look at verse 1 he showed me josh with a high priest standing before the angel of the Lord and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him and the Lord said unto Satan the Lord rebuke thee O Satan so obviously Satan was blabbering off something you know trying to trying to accuse Joshua the high priest in the presence of the Lord then that striking I wonder if that was Joshua's theophany and I just never thought about that it's Satan the angel Lord and God and Joshua I wonder if that says theophany because the Bible said don't do anything wrong to those children because they always have an angel that be always be holds the face in heaven in that thing and the bottom Paul says if we leave this body he said we've got an eternal body made in the heavens amen that's your theophany hallelujah wow that's striking I never thought about that that must be that the Alpha T my verse to thank the Lord and the Lord said unto Satan the Lord rebuke thee O Satan even the Lord that have chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee is not this a brand plucked out of the fire so we see the same thing Satan must be accusing Joshua the high priest and huh me know if Israel's going to succeed in the days of Haggai and Zechariah huh me know they need a high priest because the high priest will go into the holiest of Holies and make atonement for all Israel hallelujah praise God amen so here Satan is trying to accuse the leader of the church and somehow he's got a body up in heaven must be half anybody Satan's round off all these offenses and the Lord says the Lord rebuke thee in other words stop talking I'm gonna make a declaration here amen and how many know the Bible says that Satan accuses us day and night before the the heaven in the heavenly places and the angels that's Revelation chapter 12 he accuses the brother in day and night oh I just want the Lord to rebuke Satan for me as well and say that he's a perfect man he's a forgiving man he's under the blood of my son amen look at verse oh look at that also he's a brand plucked out of the fire see he's he's been in the fires of God maybe that coal that was off the fire you know of the altar and that's what he's like he's a brand plucked out of the fire in other words he's hot he's ready to do something for the kingdom of God he's ready to set Satan's Kingdom afoot and make it move amen he's on fire and so God even recognized Joshua is a brand plucked out of the fire hallelujah oh my now look at verse 3 now Joshua's clothed with filthy garments and stood before the angel this is striking and he answered and spake unto those that stood before him saying take away the filthy garments from him and unto him he said behold I have caused on iniquity to pass from thee and I will clothe thee with change of raiment oh my see Jesus does he causes all your dirty parts to leave amen he causes all your sins all your iniquities he throws him in the sea of forgetfulness oh that's beautiful look at this verse five and I and I said let them set a fair mitre upon his head so they set a fair mitre upon his head and clothed him with garments and the angel of the Lord stood by now look and the next event verses now they interpret this for us so God is showing us what's happening in the heavenlies as Joshua the high priest is trying to get Israel back into fellowship with God amen look at verse 6 and the angel of the Lord protested unto Joshua saying thus saith the Lord of Hosts if thou will walk in my ways and if that will keep my charge then thou shalt also judge my house and shall also keep my courts and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by Amen my glory so God is giving Joshua a vision and encouragement through zechariah zechariah saying Joshua I saw this vision of you in heaven it must have been your theophany it must have been years representation you were filthy Satan was accusing you but God called you a non-fire Holy Ghost field st. amen and God took away all your all your iniquities all your sins and he put a miter on your head you're gonna rule over Satan in your ministry amen oh that's what we need today hallelujah and he can share this with Joshua can you imagine the encouragement Joshua must have felt God thinks I'm a brand plucked out of the fire all's I got to do I just got to keep the word of the Lord a man just like Joshua the original Joshua I just got to meditate be strong be of good courage write do those things and you'll be a success and no man will stand you before you all the days of your life oh my oh this is beautiful and then the next verse verse 8 he prophesies of Jesus Christ because remember this is just 500 years before Christ he talks about a branch is going to come out of Israel mercy here now Joshua the high priest thou and thy fellows that sit before thee for their men wonder that for behold I will bring forth my servant the branch a man he's encouraging him the Messiah is coming this branch is going to come out of out of David's house in other words stay true to God's Word God is gonna bring forth this Redeemer amen and you're a part of that church oh thank you Lord Jesus amen so see how see if we take if we take this scripture and put it together with Jobe we can see how God can call us perfect how can God cause perfect because he can silence Satan he can forgive our sins amen and then now let if we go back to Jobe then we know God still sees job as a perfect man but he lets him go through trials that's right and so we'd say like this it's like God left Joe because Joe kept crying out for answers crying out for answers crying out for answers he's got boils you know he's he's suffering he's going through hard times and then his three friends come and tried to try to correct him but God actually said that these three he he said you did not speak the right thing so they were lying so these friends were liars because Joe was saying the right thing and the three friends were lying to him so they were making up lies because they were trying to figure out his life and why you getting tested if he's getting tested you know they must had something against Jobe but then God says Jobe was right you three were liars he's gonna pray for you and then you'll be healed as well you'll be forgiven because God saw job as being perfect because he has a blood sacrifice and he was keeping all the Word of God amen now now I preached this in the wisdom series but let's go back to job 3:25 I just want to remind you of this because this is how it works in our lives - like I said you know I feel like I'm going through trials I know many times you do - drove 325 for the thing which I greatly fear come upon me and that which I was afraid of is come unto me and brother Brandon tells us you know plainly and that message perfect faith that if job would not have feared this would not have happened to him brother man tells that in perfect faith paragraph 102 he says what brought it his fear that's what made it happen his faith would have kept him from it but his fear brought it to him so this is striking so in heaven you can be perfect because you have a sacrifice but on earth God still lets you go through these trials you're wondering what's wrong boy I'm really scared or you know he'll let you go through trials and he'll let all things work together but yeah up here he still sees you as his true servant Oh God is rich in mercy to hurt amen so see he was perfect in the sight of God because of the blood and that's how we're perfect because the blood of Jesus Christ yet if we have fear it'll bring things upon us if we have pride it'll bring chastisement upon us if we have lusts whatever trouble we're fighting down here but yet we're still brands plucked out of the fire amen and we just must repent move on and ask God to guide us amen the test of life how many thankful for the test of life oh I'm so thankful for God's mercy now let's go through a few more scriptures and I said so Joe was perfect and our text was Joe 23 and he said I cannot if I go forward I don't feel him there if I go backward I cannot perceive him if he's on the left hand he's working but I can't behold him he on the right hand he's hiding from me so no matter if I try praying no matter if I try fasting no matter if I pray reading my Bible I just don't seem like I can get ahold of him see that but yet he was a perfect man now remember God promised he never what leave us or forsake us but we're talking about feeling the anointing right or feeling the blessings of God or hearing the voice of God like we said this morning now I want to ask you if you remember this you remember this in 1960 and 61 brother brother Ram starting off the new year and it's in these sermons I'm listening to right now chapter revelation chapter 4 chapter 5 if you hear talk brother Bram says I do not have a leading of the Lord for 1961 he said I have all these invitations and if you listen to it he said we have all these invitations all the brothers just gonna lay hands on these invitations and he says I do not have a word from the Lord on this I am just going to go with the best of our leading of the Lord to see there's times where it seems like we don't actually have like a full leading of the Lord or it's not like we have at us at the Lord and it's in this time where God allows us to be tested Oh even brother Branham admits that now remember he got a word two years later he said stay here and storm tapes amen hallelujah and it was a dream it was vision numerous dreams all said store up these tapes don't go overseas how many know that so see God let him wander there can I say like that wandering a wilderness can I say like that he let him wander for two years I'm sorry about 1 or 2 I'm sorry one or two years all 61 and maybe I think it was the spring of 62 okay so let me say about a year and a quarter okay God let him wonder for a year and a quarter what should I do where do I go we're just doing the best we can and that one sermon he says well just think I'll go to Beaumont and the reason he went to Beaumont Texas in 1961 because he said all the churches could gather he said 25 churches could gather in one convention meeting and he said it'd be better for all the churches he didn't have thus saith the Lord it's just what he felt would be best he said he learned it's better to do that to have combined meetings while everybody's working together so see we know a member when brother remember when brother branham's uh first wife died during the flood remember that he said he prayed and it felt like a black sheet had come down was he filled with the Holy Ghost or not yes he was but see there's times like Hezekiah it seems like God it seems like God's left us but did God ever leave brother Branham he never leaves us or forsakes us but he hides himself from us amen and now the reason not this it means so much to me is because I feel like you know in 2015 I felt like our church real a revival because we had numerous families move in this was mentioned earlier so brother William wasn't here but but our church brother was really small before that everything I mean if you think is small now is even smaller and you know we're just trying to preach the Word of God and and you know stay true the Word of God will seem like in 2015 God started sending a lot of families and it was really encouraging and but then in 2016 you know we had families start leaving for different and some of them were fine reasons you know most of them were really good reasons really really sweet people really wonderful people and but you know once they started leaving I just kind of felt like the zeal started going down a little bit and then I feel like that you know I don't know about you but how many want to see more of God in our myths like how many want to see miracles in our church how many want to see gifts operate I do I pray for that I live for that not not that I'm exalting gifts above but I just want to see more supernatural you know and so I feel like you know this last few months here and even now you know now in the last few months here too I just feel like going through like a battle where I felt like gods with me but I feel like the revivals kind of left and it's collect this like with a job I feel like if we're under the blood of Jesus Christ we're perfect but yet God is gonna sometimes hide himself that he might test us amen and help me know you know how many know the Bible says this the Lord gives and the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord and so my children and my family and I were talking at home you know and I was telling them how I was a little bit discouraged and feel like this is a test the Lord and that's exactly the scripture that came to me I wasn't even planning it but the Holy Spirit just gotta inspire me and that's what I said I said the Lord gives the Lord gives families here the Lord gives people to come the Lord gives people to be a blessing but then the Lord can also take away but either way we should bless the name of the Lord and that's what I feel like you know for that's the part I want to share just about my life I feel like I'm really being tested in that way where you know I pray and I fast and I seek God and I give everything I can to preach and be a faithful pastor I try to help every single person I possibly can and in my own human thinking I would think God would keep blessing us with more and more I'd have a bigger Church and some of the brother and want to build a church you know but then when people leave it seems like how is that gonna happen and not that we really care about a building but just I'm talking about our natural human mind battles if I'm being true to God shouldn't we just keep growing greater and greater right naturally we think that but I have to remember that my thoughts are not always his thoughts and we have to remember that even when we go through a trial he's still with us right he never leaves us or forsake us but what is he doing he's testing us and so that's what the scripture says job 23 read that for our text but he knoweth the way that I take I'm so glad God knows the way I'm taking I'm not taking the way of anger bitterness fear regret I'm not taking that way I'm taking the way of love God knows the way we're taking and when he has tried me I shall come forth as gold aren't you glad for that oh thank you Jesus now remember I'm gonna read that again with Hezekiah God left him to try him that he might know all that was in his heart amen so church I know and I hope you know too God will let us be tested and tried to show us what's in our heart we might have a financial trial to see if are we gonna trust God and keep paying tithes and offerings or we gonna rob the robbed the Lord a little bit right are you at the understand I got up just kind of a funny example you know God might give us a family trial well someone will get really sick and are we gonna keep trusting God and keep praying the prayer of faith for healing or we just gonna get mad at God or might lose a loved one a grandparent a husband wife or a child we might lose someone really close and it might be a test of God's love he wants to see how we gonna react when tragedy strikes our home do we really believe God's Word do we really feel like job though he gives and takes away will still bless his name that's what he wants to see because he needs a testimony on the day of judgment and we need to have the gold testimony and we've got to come forth as gold hallelujah now remember God did God with job didn't tell Satan once but he told him twice have you considered my servant job he can't he keeps recommending Satan to try this man because he knows what's inside of job all right now let's go to job 42 here I just want to remind us of this because just kind of tells the whole story we know because he feared his trials came upon him and God let that work out into the the perfect will of God now you know in chapter 40 and 41 God answers Joe but he never really asked us answers this question job said let God come and tell me why I'm going through this god never really answered that question God just told him I do this I control animals I control this have you considered the Leviathan look at all that I do you know when the goats bring forth children you know do you know what you can you capture the snow and bring it can you make snow and bring it here god never answered this question god just humbled him and told him how great he was praise the Lord and yet God the whole time instead I'm saying job's perfect job's perfect jobs perfect Joe's perfect and then job's like I want to know why God said just trust me I'm God does God Oh us anything no God doesn't owe us nothing brother Branham says he's he don't always nothing he already did everything for us he died for us praise God is that striking God would be bragging on job in heaven but then not give job the actual answer oh but can we trust him we can trust him with our lives absolutely look at Joel 42 verse 1 then job answered the Lord and said I know that thou canst do everything see so he learned a lesson from God God taught him look at all that I do what do you do joke what problems do you really have look at all I have to control and that no thought can be withholding from thee who is he the height of counsel without knowledge therefore have I uttered that I understood not yeah I did say some things I just didn't understand things too wonderful for me which I knew not here I beseech thee and I will speak I would demand of the ins speak down to me I have heard of thee by the hearing of the year but now mine I see if thee amen because remember God met him in a whirlwind right after all this trial where it felt like where's God I can't see God here I can't see God there I can't see God everywhere but then finally he sees God he sees him in a whirlwind just like the prophet of God did amen and look at verse 6 now see this is why trials happened to us wherefore I have myself and repent in dust and ashes if we have no other reason to understand trials they are to Humble us and make us respect God more and fear the Lord more remember Jesus learned obedience through the things he suffered will hear job he suffers and he learns to respect God more he said sometimes remember he was the wisest man number job he stood in the gates and he gave everybody counsel all the young men came to him but after the boils came nobody wanted here is what wisdom anymore he was so wise right but even now after these trials he steps back and said well I was saying some things I should not have said I'm humbled and Archie was grateful when God humbles you Church I want to be I want to be grateful when God humbles me then I can grow to love him more and I can trust him more in my life amen now let's go through some more examples of how God left individuals because it's all through it's all through the scripture I probably got twenty scriptures here I don't think I'll get through all of them tonight but I just want to do this Bible say like I said Adam time to finish the Revelation chapter 4 part 2 so let's go to 1st chronicles 10:13 this is about Saul 1st chronicles 10:13 let's remember these here by the grace of the Lord remember God has a purpose for everything many times we look at situations say I don't understand what God is doing here I don't understand what is God is doing but in everything God understands what he's doing and we need to wait and then we'll know understand it better by and by as the song says look at first chronicles 10:13 so saw died for what his transgression which he committed against the Lord God killed him allowed him to be killed even against the world Lord which he kept not and also for asking counsel one that had a familiar spirit to inquire of it and inquired not of the Lord therefore he slew him God had saw slain and turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse isn't that striking so saw God left saw because of his sin now that's not what it was for jobs I I hope we don't want to be saw but we want to be Joe we want to be perfect if we got to be tested we want to be perfect like Jobe I'm just showing saw because Saul was saved but here's another reason God will leave people because they won't repent of their sin memory had a hard heart he kept attacking David he kept attacking David he wasn't kind of David he tried to kill David he tried to say everything wrong against David he tried to do everything he could to ruin David's ministry right and God didn't like that he never really really repented so God slew him remember that's New Testament to remember 1st Corinthians 5 where Paul said take that fornicator who's sleeping with his stepmother he said kick him out of the church and give him up to the devil remember that that's New Testament - God does that absolutely now we'll try to go maybe we'll try to go an order here okay let's then I'm looking at the order scripts go to Deuteronomy 8 let's just go there by God's grace I'm gonna try to keep the order maybe we just go right through the scripture dude around me 8 verse 2 actually we'll just read one in two maybe I can have my children help me read would that be okay I got some Bibles ready Deuteronomy 8 okay Lydia can you read verses 1 & 2 please [Music] okay men look at that and that's striking two million people come out of Egypt they all got baptized unto Moses now you type that today how many got baptized through brother branham's baptism right brought out of the world and then God allows the church to go through a test and this test is gonna prove who really believes Moses who really believes brother Branham today right so these things these trials these dark deserts and trials were to humble the people and prove if they really believe it or not and you know Joshua and Caleb were only two that made it over right we know that so they must have not been grumbling when they didn't have water they must have not could be in complaining when they had all these things oh god help us like like I think the psalm writer said Lord set a guard in front of my lips that don't utter perverse things amen help me not to complain help me not to get bitter help me not to say anything evil guard said a guard about my lips so I don't say anything against the Lord or any of his people amen and so the trials were gonna show are we gonna live by every word or just some words of God and we've got to live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God look at verse 16 liddie can you read 16 as well amen see the latter end this was going to work together now most of them died right but the next generation they were gonna see the blessings of God on the latter end because they would believe the word they'd be circumcised and they'd follow Joshua according to all the word of god and we've got to know that - we've got to obey all the Word of God so our ladder and we come forth as gold amen just like jokes and I know if he tries me I'll come forth my ladder and will be greater amen hallelujah and I know you've heard you know brother Brooks and different other brothers that her older come through here brother Brooks said the last time about all the trials that he's gone through and it's all kind of molded him to help him to have the faith that he has right now and he knows that God has taken things out of his life and giving testimonies healed him of cancer all those different things God has done to bring him to the spot where is now so he's shining forth as gold the light of God is shining and reflecting off his life and so we've got he's what 60 60 - I think now so we've got a I've got a ways to go you know if God Terry's we've got to go through trials we got to go through these battles and but if God is gracious and if we keep God's word our latter end will be greater than the beginning amen and we're talking about Christian character not even a bigger Church or bigger people like I said we don't care about that we care about being more like Christ that's the real important thing okay now let's uh I'm sure like I said I'm trying to get these in order here so we preserve our time yeah 13 3 so Deuteronomy 13 3 that's the next one so again he's basically repeating the same thing aren't you glad God gives reminders has ever been something where you haven't got it right away but eventually you got it I didn't I didn't understand God's Word maybe at the beginning I shouldn't do this or shouldn't do that and then pretty soon you get it but it took another time to preach it or another time to read it or it took somebody else to bring it up to you and then you finally get it - amen oh that's God's grace right there now kaikki read 13-3 yes sir yeah thank you okay so if you know the context verses 1 & 2 it says if a prophet rises up and it actually comes to pass what he prophesized but yet he tells you to go outside the word he said don't follow that prophet because it must have been a lying signer wonder or maybe even it's like Balaam it could have been right but then he got off in false doctrine in fornication right and so why did God allow this God allowed a prophet to tell the truth it came to pass but then he taught false doctrine later he had that he's anointed one at the end time we'd say right to prove the people whether they love the Lord your God or not so no matter what signs miracles wonders take place are we gonna love God and the word the next day or we gonna push the word aside and say well we've gotta miracle you know we're so great we can do whatever we want the miracle should make us more humble amen but in this case God is proving them he's using it as a test oh my the tests of life and that's something maybe I'll go here about 15 more minutes let me set a timer here so wear myself out okay let's hit a few more now we know this one we don't have to go there but judges 1620 said the Lord was departed from him Sampson so Sampson is again like saw both had a powerful anointing at one time but then because of their transgressions the Lord left them now with Hezekiah God was left him to try him just like job God left that maybe feeling the presence of God maybe the joy you know the anointing God left that to try him and see how he'd respond all right let's go to Psalms David had a lot of this how many know David had a lot of this where it would seem like the anointing would leave but yet God was with him the whole time oh my mercy Lord let's go to Psalms 27 verse 9 seven verse nine oh don't you know - David was a man that loved the anointing he said my cup runs over a man he loved the anointing but yet there was times he's like where is the Lord okay 27 9 Malachi can you read that for me amen so see David knew God could remove his face God could remove his blessing a member this is the rapture chapter remember that look at verse 5 is the rapture verse brother branham use for the time of trouble he shall hide me his pavilion and the secret of his tabernacle Isha hide me and he shall set me up upon a rock and that's something that's really striking there's time so when God promises us in the day of the rapture the days of those days he'll hide us in him but before that we've got to go through trials and God will hide himself from us sometimes isn't that striking and it's all to test us to see what we're gonna do without that maybe feeling that outward anointing maybe on our flesh hide not your face for me that means God could have hid his face from David oh my now we know the next one we'd love to read that one Psalms 51 11 cast me not away from your presence O Lord take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore to me the joy of thy salvation so David knew I was like to lose the joy to feel like he was cast away from God's presence that felt like the Holy Spirit wasn't upon him anymore he knew what that was like now the real believer will pray this in Psalms 139 23 let's go there Psalms 139 23 and I think I've said this before too but I've had numerous people when I go other places and preach they come up and say can you pray for me I'll say yes what would you like prayer for pray that I can be closer to God and go through some trials they have actually asked me to pray for them to go through trials I'm like well if that's what you want to pray for I said you know what you're getting into because they want to be so pure but I think what they mean I think is what this is what they mean right here I don't know if they were right or wrong that just be between them and the Lord maybe they had a question their minds is this the right have I done the right thing and maybe they wanted God to show them if they're in the right or wrong but it was just an odd request when I don't hear very often look at verse 23 search me O God and know my heart try me and know my thoughts so see there is an aspect of the believer where Lord I want you to try them I want you to I want you to show me what's inside me am I really as pure and as humble as I need to be show me if I'm where I need to be in the right place so see there's a part of believer you need you want to be tried you want to pass the test amen huh me know if you study real hard you don't even fear the test I've had many tests like that I knew exactly what was gonna be on that test and I walked out of there with a hundred percent or ninety nine that's that's not maybe that's our David's feeling try me know my thoughts let's look at the next verse verse twenty for America and see if there be any wicked way in me and lead me in the way everlasting I don't want to step outside of your Perfect will test me let me go through tests try me so I know it's inside my heart that I can go the right way with the Lord amen so see sometimes a test of life sometimes we we need them we want them we always need them but sometimes we actually want them Lord just make sure before I make this huge decision before I make this decision try me test my heart make sure everything in my heart is the right thought I don't want to have any wrong thoughts and then lead me in the way everlasting amen I got a couple more here let's uh let's go to proverbs 17 this is this is very similar to job 23 robber 17 three proverbs 17 23 Lydia could you read that for us hon I'm sorry 17-3 I'm sorry mercy I was thinking of job 23 forgive me amen so basically proverbs are saying that I am a fight refining pot I'm the pot you got to put I'm in the pot and I'm gonna come forth as gold my life is gonna be like a bunch of hot trials right I'm gonna be tested and tried and again and again and hotter and hotter and hotter and harder and harder and harder but at the end I know I'm gonna be exactly what God wants me to be amen that's beautiful Zechariah this goes back to Zechariah chapter 13 we read chapter 3 but let's go to Zechariah 13 this is a scripture that jumped off the pages and really blessed my heart to Zechariah 13 9:00 right before me okay now let's look at now this is interesting I'm not sure how to place this scripture but this is in the chapter where Jesus shows himself to 144,000 because in verse 1 there's a fountain open in the house of David that's really striking but verse 8 and it should come to pass that in all the land saith the Lord two parts there and shall be cut off and die but the third part shall be left there in that's interesting that reminds me of Revelation and the vials and the trumpets but verse 9 and I will know here's what I want to go and I'll bring the third part through the fire and we'll refine them as silver is refined and we'll try them as gold is tried they shall call on my name and I will hear them I will say it is my people and they shall say the Lord is my god so what is this proving this scripture is proving that there is a calling on of God when we go through our fiery trials god knows when we go through the trial it is going to drive us to our knees have you ever been driven to your knees lately my hands up both my hands can be up different trials you go through different tests this is proving it in the scripture you are like weave gold silver being refined and then when you feel the hotness of this that's this test and trial you'll call upon me when you're suffering and it's hot and is difficult you'll call upon me and I'll answer you amen glory that's a beautiful scripture to prove that God uses the trials to drive us to our knees amen let's go to Malachi 3 now Kai 3 there we just got a couple more by the grace of the Lord now ky3 first to course chap I'm sorry burst one is John the Baptist verse two who may abide the day of his coming and who shall stand when he appears for he is like a refiners fire and like fuller slow soap rather sorry and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver and he shall purify the sons of Levi and purge them as gold and silver that they may offer unto the Lord and oblation in righteousness then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord has the days of old and as in the former years a church why do we read this let's take this for the spiritual in the natural God had to take Israel through trials so they would offer the right kind of sacrifice and how many know after you go through a trial your worship is more sincere at the other side it ought to be it ought to be because that's what God is doing here with Israel you're really not going to offer a real pure set that's what he's telling Israel you're pure of sacrifice isn't he going to be received or given until after you go through the test of faith and then when you come out you'll love God more on the other end amen because the Bible said then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord oh my that's beautiful the most pure offerings come from our hearts when we go through great trials of faith that's really striking oh my I think we all see at church sometimes we see we see ourselves falling away from our first love anybody ever felt like that you seem to fall away I felt I felt like that you seem like oh just not as sincere as I used to be well I think God's get ready to take us through a refiners fire then and then let us go through the fires that it might produce the right kind of offering a pure offering a pure heart before God amen praise the Lord let's go to John 15 here Saint John 15 Saint John 15 verse 1 I am The True Vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth NOT fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth root he purges it that it might bring forth more fruit I'm thankful the Lord cuts off all my bad branches aren't you that bad attitude that bad saying that bad thought I'm so glad he cuts off the bad ones now the hurtful part is when he cuts off the good thing you got a good faithful you have the good fruitful part of your life and God will cut you in that area and then it won't you won't see fruit in that area so see how it feels like the Lord it feels like the Lord has left you in that area I don't see fruit really coming out of this area of my life that's because God had to cut it to make it more fruitful right and I love this this reminds me of what we read it a josh with a high priest in verse 3 now are you clean through the word which I've spoken unto you amen and we could enjoy that every time we hear the word of God preached praise God we get clean if we receive it and if we take God's word and accept it in our lives we walk out of church clean by the grace of God amen abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me and this one my favorite scriptures lately I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing I shared that recently with a couple of people and they're like wow I never thought about like that because they were saying oh you and your wife do such a great job raising the children and I said I didn't do anything good I can't do anything good the only good that can come out of my life as if Jesus did it in me because right here it says apart from me him I can do nothing and they're like wow I never thought about like that I was just thankful that the Lord gives us these scriptures to remind us and to keep us humble to keep us little because without Christ I can't do anything was anybody blessed by the morning service was anybody blessed by tonight if it was if you were it wasn't me it was Christ because I can do nothing neither can you so we need Jesus all the time amen I just need Jesus all the time I always say this with with the parents when they come up and thank me for teaching their children all my child loves school or my child love your class and always tell them I can't do anything good I said it must have been Jesus you know because we have a really religious community in Copley they're very very religious at least denominational wise but they can respect that though they say okay yeah and I was telling that if if I did anything good for your child it wasn't me it was Christ in me because I am NOT gonna get any credit the Bible said no flesh shall glory in his presence or nobody say look at me oh I really did a good job for you Jesus look how great I am you know it can't be anybody kept me Perry green or Eddie Bisco or Donny Reagan or brother Branham nobody can take credit it's all the credits gonna go to Jesus Christ and for that we're grateful for it of course we honor God's servants and all of God's children you know but we realize all behind that it's all Jesus Christ let me just do two more here let's go to James James chapter 1 James chapter 1 just these are from familiar but I just want to read over again because they give us such strength in fact I sent that John 15:1 to a friend on Friday morning he said oh thank you so much I needed that one I said yes sir I needed it too I know we need them we need two reminders verse two James 1:2 my brother and counted all joy when you fall into divers temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith works or produces patience let patience have a perfect work that you may be entire I'm sorry that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing I like this if any of you lack wisdom let him ask God they give it to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that waver there's like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed hallelujah now I want to read 13 to go down 13 let no man say when he is tempted I am tempted of God so job was not tempted he was tested for God cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he's drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and when sin when it's finished bringeth forth death and this is why I even wrote my notes I want God to give me more understanding on this God tests but he does not tempt I want to have more understanding on that so it's like God allows Satan to tempt us but yet God allowed that temptation to come but it wasn't God that tempted us so it's a fine line and I just I'm asking God Lord just give me more understanding on that and to just another way in other words just raised my faith more and more in the midst of the trial let's end with this one let's stay on our feet let's go to first Peter chapter 1 it's right after James 1st Peter chapter 1 first Peter chapter 1 verse 6 let's read verse 2 real quick just you can see this I was saying this morning how God God foreknew us by knowing our choices and that's in verse 2 that's how God predestinated us God foreknew what we would choose okay cuz some people say well oh God just chosen chose me you're just ordained and had nothing to do with what you're gonna choose no verse 2 proves it elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father see that's why we're electing chosen because God foreknew God had foreknowledge that we would love him that God loves prior to Christ more than the Methodist Church down the street that's not how it is God just knew we would believe him and trust his word for this day because that would not be fair I wouldn't be just verse 6 where an you greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be you are in heaviness through manifold temptation so these Christians that Peter was writing to had many many temptations many trials persecution physically going through many trials can you relate to that anybody going through met lots of trials I am verse 7 listen that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be try with fire might be found unto the praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ whom having not seen you love in whom though now you see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory that's why we got to get happy sometimes at church if we're going in the midst of a trial we say even at home all the time wherever you can if your own to the midst of the trial say God help me to rejoice because the Bible said I should still have joy unspeakable and full of glory amen Lord just show me your love make me shout make me rejoice make me remember how good you've been to me praise God amen receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls amen I think I'll stop right there are you grateful for the test of life amen I am to see it in job real believers like job David the highest quality of believers for their day even the highest quality of believers we'd say the bride for their day even them there was times God left his anointing the anointing left them in order to try them hallelujah but how many are grateful that God knoweth the way that you're taking tonight and when he tries you you'll come forth as gold let's pray let's close with that by the grace of Lord Heavenly Father Lord were grateful for this word that we've heard tonight Lord father this all this is all pointing to Lord the purpose of our lives dear God many times Lord when trials coming it can be kind of foggy it can be kind of stormy it can be kind of hard to know which way you're taking us Lord may be like we're on a

leave us nor forsake us as you're constantly hovering around us watching our every step we may not feel you Lord and that's the hard part but Lord may these fiery trials guide us to cry out to you
