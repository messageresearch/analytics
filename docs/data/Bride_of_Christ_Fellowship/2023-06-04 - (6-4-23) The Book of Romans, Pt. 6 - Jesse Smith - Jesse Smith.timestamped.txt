[0:00] take me a number of sermons to get
[0:01] through but I just kind of felt led to
[0:03] go to that message
[0:06] so let's read this here Romans 5 verse
[0:08] 8.
[0:10] we'll have you be seated here by the
[0:12] grace of God
[0:18] Romans 5 verse 8.
[0:20] let's read that on three ready one two
[0:22] three but God commandeth his love toward
[0:25] us in that while we were yet sinners
[0:28] Christ died for us of course this means
[0:31] command means to prove God proved his
[0:33] love toward us
[0:35] in that while we were yet sinners Christ
[0:38] died for us he died
[0:40] he died for us before we even loved him
[0:42] before we express any love or any
[0:45] interest in God God had already prepared
[0:47] Christ to die for us what a great
[0:49] promise you may be seated here by God's
[0:51] grace may God has blessings the Ring of
[0:52] his word if you would here let's go back
[0:54] to Romans chapter 3 and I want to maybe
[0:56] I can build my way up to that I'm not
[0:57] sure how far I'll get
[0:59] I don't have any slides for this one I
[1:01] did all my slides for the souls that are
[1:02] in prison I'll look at that one tonight
[1:04] here by God's grace I want to go to
[1:07] Romans 3 25 we'll start there Romans 3
[1:10] 25 we kind of left off there on
[1:12] Wednesday night
[1:22] of course this has been a beautiful
[1:23] chapter here uh we're looking at Romans
[1:26] 3 about how the Jews had an advantage
[1:29] over everyone else because the word of
[1:32] God was given to them through Moses
[1:36] everyone else didn't have the words of
[1:39] God but the Jews of one small nation out
[1:42] of many nations had the word of God the
[1:44] law of God so there was an advantage of
[1:48] having the word of God but of course
[1:50] it's a disadvantage for all of us
[1:51] because we're all sinners right and so
[1:54] whether the the Jews had the law or
[1:55] whether the Gentiles didn't have the law
[1:57] they were all Sinners right and this is
[1:59] why God had to send Jesus Christ
[2:00] Hallelujah because we were all Sinners
[2:02] and we all needed saved by the grace of
[2:05] God but I started here Romans 3 25 here
[2:07] and we'll just work our way through here
[2:09] by God's grace
[2:12] let me set a timer here I'd like to uh
[2:15] watch my time here by God's grace here
[2:17] today so Romans 3 25.
[2:22] the Bible says whom God hath set forth
[2:24] to be a propitiation through faith in
[2:28] his blood
[2:29] to declare his righteousness so God
[2:32] declared Jesus's righteousness for the
[2:36] remission or the sending away of sins
[2:38] that are passed through the forbearance
[2:41] of God hallelujah now this word
[2:44] propitiation means a that's a propitiary
[2:47] sacrifice
[2:49] through faith in his blood it also means
[2:51] a place of propitiation
[2:54] Hallelujah it also means a mercy seat in
[2:58] the Old Testament The Mercy Seat was
[3:00] sprinkled with atoning blood on the day
[3:02] of atonement in token that the righteous
[3:05] sentence of the law had been carried out
[3:09] so that what must else have been a
[3:12] judgment seat could righteously be a
[3:14] mercy seat
[3:16] so there's a lot said in there right in
[3:18] the Old Testament uh
[3:21] a goat had to die on the day of
[3:23] atonement and they would take the blood
[3:24] of the goat and they'd sprinkle it on
[3:26] every piece of furniture in the in the
[3:28] Holy place they start in the outer Court
[3:30] work their way to the inner core and
[3:32] then in the holiest of holies who had
[3:33] the Ark of the Covenant
[3:35] and there was a a box which was called
[3:38] the voice of holies on top of that the
[3:40] lid was called The Mercy Seat and the
[3:42] Bible said God Jesus is a propitiation
[3:45] or Jesus is The Mercy Seat
[3:48] and remember God's presence dwelt above
[3:51] that box that mercy seat and God God was
[3:54] going to judge the people unless there
[3:56] was blood on The Mercy Seat
[3:58] right and so once the blood of the goat
[4:01] was on The Mercy Seat now the people
[4:03] could speak to God and God would speak
[4:05] forgiveness to them
[4:07] God would speak Mercy to them God would
[4:10] God would say that your sins are paid
[4:12] for now because something has paid for
[4:15] your sins and innocent sacrifice paid
[4:18] for your sins and now I can talk with
[4:21] you now I can commune with you praise
[4:23] God Amen Hallelujah and Jesus is The
[4:26] Mercy Seat Jesus is no doubt he's the
[4:29] mercy you see plus he's the goat that
[4:30] died right plus he's the high priest
[4:32] that brought his own blood in this case
[4:34] he brought his own blood into heaven and
[4:37] he brought his own blood before the
[4:39] almighty invisible spirit of God and God
[4:42] received his sacrifice and now God can
[4:44] look at us and say you're forgiven
[4:46] hallelujah amen now you're righteous now
[4:49] I can speak to you now I won't judge you
[4:51] because a sacrifice has taken your place
[4:54] amen oh what a blessing amen the the
[4:57] faith the blood of Jesus Christ
[4:59] is a propitiation it takes the Judgment
[5:02] that was against us and gives us the
[5:05] righteousness of Jesus Christ and now
[5:07] Jesus's righteousness is declared for us
[5:11] and our sins are remitted the Bible said
[5:13] remission there was two goats on that
[5:15] day one goat died and they took the
[5:17] blood into the holiest the other goat
[5:19] had all the sins confessed upon it and
[5:22] it was sent out in the wilderness never
[5:24] to be seen again that's called the
[5:26] scapegoat right the scapegoat that
[5:28] escaped but all the sin was placed upon
[5:31] that goat sent away and the Goat would
[5:34] never be seen hallelujah amen the goat
[5:36] would be taken off in the wilderness and
[5:37] never seen again and it represents how
[5:40] our sin was placed upon Jesus and Jesus
[5:43] took our sins and carried it so far away
[5:45] that our sins Will Never Be Remembered
[5:47] in heaven anymore praise God oh my oh
[5:50] it's a beautiful picture praise God
[5:51] Jesus both died for our sins and he
[5:54] carried our sins far away Hallelujah
[5:56] amen where did he carry our sins to he
[5:58] carried our sins down to Hell itself
[6:01] that's First Peter chapter three let's
[6:03] read that First Peter chapter 3 by God's
[6:05] grace
[6:06] that's where you look we'll look a bit
[6:08] further at that tonight we look at Souls
[6:10] that are in prison now
[6:12] I thought with our visitor Kyle we just
[6:14] kind of keep things straight right from
[6:15] the word of God there by God's grace so
[6:17] he can so it can be just as clear as
[6:19] possible here by God's grace first Peter
[6:21] 3.
[6:22] then we'll get into you know the
[6:23] ministry of God's Prophet this this
[6:25] evening by God's grace
[6:27] first Peter 3 18.
[6:30] so here's where Christ carried our sins
[6:33] uh
[6:35] the Bible said he carried him far away
[6:36] and here the Bible said he carried them
[6:38] down to Hell
[6:39] Verse 18 for Christ also also has once
[6:43] suffered for sins the just for the
[6:46] unjust that he might bring us to God
[6:48] being put to death in the flesh but
[6:51] quickened by the spirit
[6:52] by which also he went and preached unto
[6:55] the spirits in prison so we'll look at
[6:57] that later tonight
[6:59] verse 20 which sometime we're
[7:01] disobedient
[7:03] when Once the long-suffering of God wait
[7:05] in the days of Noah while the ark wasn't
[7:07] preparing wherein few that is eight
[7:10] Souls were saved by water
[7:13] so the Bible says in verse 19 he went
[7:15] and preached on the spirits in prison so
[7:18] this was Jesus going down into the
[7:20] depths of the regions of the Lost in the
[7:21] heart of the earth Jesus went into the
[7:23] heart of the Earth
[7:24] and the Bible said that he took the keys
[7:26] of death and Hell from Satan
[7:28] and because he took the keys of death
[7:30] and hell he could he could cause a
[7:31] resurrection praise God and then when
[7:34] Jesus raised he didn't he didn't raise
[7:36] alone praise God hallelujah he brought
[7:38] up many of the Old Testament Saints and
[7:40] they Rose praise God and they were seen
[7:42] in the city let's read out here Matthew
[7:43] I believe it's 27.
[7:46] Matthew 27 let's read that
[7:57] 27 51.
[8:02] so jesus carried our sins down to the
[8:05] heart of the Earth the regions of the
[8:07] lost and he condemned Satan down there
[8:10] but he took the keys of took his keys of
[8:12] death and hell and now Jesus has power
[8:14] over the grave Hallelujah he can conquer
[8:16] the grave he can bring out the Old
[8:18] Testament Saints out from the heart of
[8:20] the earth and he can resurrect them up
[8:22] to the Earth and eventually up to heaven
[8:24] praise God Amen verse 51 and behold the
[8:28] veil of the temple was written Twain
[8:29] From the top to the bottom and the Earth
[8:31] did quake and the Rocks rent
[8:33] verse 52 and the Grays were open and
[8:37] many bodies of the Saints which slept
[8:39] arose and came out of the graves after
[8:42] his resurrection and went to the holy
[8:44] city and appeared unto many so when
[8:47] Jesus raised from the dead he didn't
[8:50] raise alone he brought an army with him
[8:53] praise God how many believe that by
[8:55] God's grace and we know when Jesus comes
[8:57] the second time he's doing the same
[8:59] thing Hallelujah because the Bible says
[9:01] the dead in Christ will rise first
[9:03] Hallelujah he's bringing him an army
[9:05] with him robed in white hallelujah thank
[9:07] God Amen
[9:09] and church many of our loved ones or or
[9:11] if we would happen to die then we will
[9:13] raise first the Bible says because the
[9:15] dead in Christ rise first hallelujah
[9:17] what a promise so in both cases at both
[9:20] resurrections he brings uh the dead
[9:22] Saints with him because he has power
[9:25] over death hell and the grave Hallelujah
[9:28] and he proved it when he raised Lazarus
[9:29] from the grave amen he proved it every
[9:31] time he raised somebody from their dead
[9:33] that he had the power to conquer death
[9:36] itself amen
[9:37] hallelujah praise God now
[9:39] let's go back to Romans 3 26 here
[9:44] Romans 3 26 we'll go back here
[9:52] we're just preaching verse by verse here
[9:54] to declare I say at this time his
[9:57] righteousness so church is not your
[9:59] righteousness that's declared
[10:01] right you're you know God's not going to
[10:03] use your righteousness to to let you
[10:05] into heaven the Bible said God is
[10:07] preparing Jesus and declaring Jesus's
[10:10] righteousness for you and I hallelujah
[10:12] oh there should be no words brother gets
[10:14] in the spot in his in his ministry where
[10:16] he says the ultimate goal of the
[10:18] Christian is to rest in what Jesus has
[10:20] done
[10:22] like he brings it to that place and said
[10:24] we have to rest as Believers in other
[10:26] words that means a lot of people when we
[10:28] all do it we wrestle are we saved you
[10:30] know can God forgive me will God really
[10:31] forgive me and he says the ultimate
[10:33] place of a Believer is resting in the
[10:35] finished work of Jesus Christ sacrifice
[10:37] Hallelujah and here's a man who says
[10:40] after he served God for 30 or 40 years
[10:42] he's still learning how to rest in
[10:44] church I think as we go on we just need
[10:46] concert reminders to rest in the promise
[10:48] rest in the blood of Jesus rest in Jesus
[10:51] purchasing our Salvation we've got to
[10:53] trust in his righteousness it's the only
[10:55] righteousness there really is praise God
[10:58] our righteousness the Bible says it says
[11:00] filthy rags and yes God will use us at
[11:02] certain times to do good things and we
[11:04] can see God working our lives but it's
[11:06] not our works that allows us to get to
[11:09] heaven we didn't pay the price to get to
[11:11] heaven God paid the price Hallelujah
[11:13] with his own blood with his own son
[11:15] Hallelujah that's why we worship and
[11:17] love Jesus amen that's why he's the way
[11:19] the truth and the life Hallelujah
[11:22] he's the way the truth and the life
[11:24] hallelujah thank God
[11:26] Jesus's righteousness is what gets us
[11:28] there verse 26 that he might be just
[11:31] that God is fair and he's the justifier
[11:33] or the one who declares righteous of him
[11:36] that believes in Jesus so God declares
[11:38] us righteous because we believe in Jesus
[11:41] Christ amen
[11:43] verse 27 now where is boasting then
[11:45] who's going to brag why serve God for 40
[11:47] years I serve God for 50 years who's
[11:49] going to brag in heaven the Bible says
[11:52] it's excluded
[11:53] there's no there's no place for well the
[11:56] braggers or the holiest people will be
[11:58] over here bragging about how they got to
[12:00] heaven on their own there'll be no spots
[12:02] in heaven for that praise God Amen it's
[12:04] excluded by what law or what works nay
[12:07] no but by the law of Faith Hallelujah
[12:11] in other words God is going to save
[12:12] people just because they believe in
[12:15] Jesus Christ because they receive Jesus
[12:17] Christ now we're going to see the
[12:19] balance later in the chapters but you
[12:20] know the balance if you receive the
[12:23] faith uh to have faith in Jesus Christ
[12:25] well then then what you've received is
[12:27] forgiveness of sins and because you're
[12:29] so happy to be forgiven because you're
[12:31] so thankful to be forgiven then you want
[12:33] to do works for Jesus you don't want to
[12:36] work for Satan he was trying to kill you
[12:37] and destroy you murder you he was trying
[12:40] to get you a frame he was trying to
[12:41] betray you you know he was he was trying
[12:43] to make your life or make you lose your
[12:45] life he was trying to get rid of you but
[12:47] Jesus came and had mercy on you and so
[12:49] when you receive salvation you want to
[12:52] do something for Jesus Hallelujah
[12:54] anything Lord I'll do anything I don't
[12:56] care if I'm the I don't care if I have
[12:58] to open the door to the church if I
[12:59] never get to do a miracle I never get to
[13:01] do anything it doesn't matter I just
[13:03] want to do something for Jesus
[13:04] Hallelujah
[13:06] if I just get to wash the toilets at the
[13:08] church praise God hallelujah what
[13:10] whatever God's called me to do I want to
[13:12] do something anything to glorify Jesus
[13:15] Christ Hallelujah hey Master David said
[13:17] I'd rather be the doorkeeper at the
[13:20] temple of God than to dwell with the
[13:22] tents of the wicked
[13:24] I'd rather be I'd rather be the sweeper
[13:26] here today at the church I know I'm the
[13:27] preacher but if I wasn't the preacher
[13:28] I'd rather sweep these floors than be
[13:31] drunk with those bunch of Sinners that
[13:32] are lost out there my heart goes out to
[13:34] them we're sad for them I'd rather be
[13:36] here picking up crumbs off the floor
[13:38] then laying on the floor there with a
[13:40] hangover something like that I'd rather
[13:42] serve Jesus because he's the Savior
[13:44] praise God
[13:45] amen
[13:47] thank God but there would be no boasting
[13:49] in heaven like how great I was or how
[13:51] great you were
[13:52] there'll be no boasting
[13:55] now verse uh
[13:58] 28 therefore we conclude that a man is
[14:02] justified by faith
[14:04] without the Deeds of the law
[14:06] so no matter how much Moses could keep
[14:08] so many Commandments or Aaron or Miriam
[14:10] or any of the Saints they were not
[14:13] declared righteous because of all their
[14:15] deeds
[14:17] they were declared righteous because
[14:19] they had faith in God
[14:21] faith means confidence right it means
[14:23] trust in other words as long as a person
[14:25] I'm just as long as a person is just
[14:27] trusting in God they are saved
[14:30] that's what saves them they're trusting
[14:32] in the sacrifice of Jesus Christ how
[14:34] many trusting in Him Today
[14:35] oh thank God I am Hallelujah with all my
[14:38] heart praise God verse 29 is he god of
[14:41] the Jews only
[14:42] is he not also the Gentiles yes of the
[14:45] Gentiles also thank God because we're
[14:46] all Gentiles right if we're not Jews if
[14:49] we're not Israelites then we're all
[14:50] Gentiles thank God that he's the god of
[14:53] the Gentiles as well amen
[14:55] verse 30 seeing it is one God not three
[14:58] Gods one God which shall justify the
[15:01] circumcision by faith and uncircumcision
[15:04] through faith now we're going to get to
[15:07] this here in chapter four in just a
[15:08] moment but for the Jews it was so
[15:10] important all the males had to be
[15:12] circumcised and by the time Jesus came 1
[15:15] 500 years after Moses
[15:18] they were making that surgery the
[15:20] evidence that they were saved
[15:23] instead of trusting in God they were
[15:25] trusting that they had the surgery now
[15:27] God wanted them to have a surgery but
[15:29] they begin to trust in their fleshly
[15:31] Works does that sound familiar
[15:33] people today will say as long as I give
[15:34] money to church then I'm saved no that's
[15:37] actually not it
[15:38] as long as you know they're trusting in
[15:40] their own works as long as I I stopped
[15:42] doing this and start doing that then I'm
[15:43] then I'm saved by my works
[15:46] I'm a good person so God's going to save
[15:48] me that's not it at all
[15:50] it's trusting in the finished work of
[15:52] Jesus Christ he died for me so that I
[15:55] could be saved hallelujah it's that
[15:57] simple just trusting in that and then if
[15:59] you really believe that it will change
[16:01] your heart the Bible said God Will Take
[16:03] Your Heart of Stone and it'll make it a
[16:04] heart of Flesh Hallelujah he'll
[16:06] transform your heart where you're not
[16:08] Stony towards the word of God you're not
[16:09] hard and bitter against God's word but
[16:12] now it's a living your heart's alive to
[16:15] the things of God
[16:16] oh my you're sensitive in other words
[16:19] you're sensitive to the things of God
[16:20] the spirit of God moves you sometimes
[16:22] you're shouting sometimes you're dancing
[16:24] sometimes you're praising God I feel
[16:26] like dancing and you're you're just
[16:27] loving God sometimes you're weeping uh
[16:29] you want Sinners to be saved all these
[16:32] emotions come on you because now you've
[16:34] got a heart of Flesh you can feel God's
[16:36] heart praise God
[16:37] you feel what God feels God wants
[16:39] Sinners to be saved Hallelujah God for
[16:41] you God Jesus wept when Lazarus died
[16:44] you'll feel the emotions you're
[16:46] sensitive to the Holy Spirit Hallelujah
[16:48] and today we want to feel what the holy
[16:51] spirit is putting into our hearts amen
[16:53] in other words let's be sensitive today
[16:55] what is God trying to speak to our
[16:57] hearts today
[16:58] what does God want to accomplish today
[17:00] in our hearts and lives amen
[17:02] Glory
[17:04] so God justifies or declares righteous
[17:07] Jews if they're circumcised
[17:09] by faith and Gentiles if they're not
[17:12] circumcised by faith
[17:14] both groups he declares them righteous
[17:16] because of faith in the word of God Amen
[17:20] now here Romans 3 31 now we're finished
[17:23] in chapter 3 moving into chapter four
[17:25] here I think this is the last verse
[17:28] yes chapter 4.
[17:31] Romans 3 31 do we then make void the law
[17:35] through faith so Paul says so then
[17:38] should we just get rid of all those Old
[17:39] Testament books then
[17:41] God forbid no no don't get rid of him
[17:44] yay we establish the law in other words
[17:47] we make firm the law
[17:49] now this doesn't mean we go back to
[17:52] legalism as we're going to say it just
[17:54] means we make it firm in other words God
[17:56] was speaking so many truths in the law
[17:58] that we need it we don't want that we
[18:01] don't want that Foundation to fall
[18:03] we need that Foundation
[18:05] I'm going to show you another one here
[18:07] you probably remember this one but go to
[18:08] First Corinthians 15. I'll show you a
[18:09] reason why we need this
[18:12] I didn't get to this on Wednesday night
[18:13] but I wanted to
[18:15] I'll preach here today First Corinthians
[18:17] 15 51.
[18:22] First Corinthians 15 51. behold I shoe
[18:25] you a mystery we shall not all sleep but
[18:28] we shall all be changed in a moment in
[18:31] the twinkling of an eye at the last
[18:33] Trump so this is speaking of the rapture
[18:36] the second I'm sorry the first
[18:37] resurrection
[18:38] for the trumpet shall sound and the dead
[18:40] shall be raised incorruptible
[18:43] and we shall be changed for this
[18:45] corruption I'm sorry for this corrupt
[18:48] that we must put on encryption and this
[18:50] Mortal must put on immortality verse 54
[18:52] is where we want to go
[18:54] so when this corruptable shall have put
[18:56] on incorruption and this Mortal shall
[18:58] put on immortality then shall be brought
[19:01] to pass the saying that is written death
[19:04] is swallowed up in Victory amen
[19:07] hallelujah
[19:09] so at some point in the future Jesus is
[19:11] going to come down and he's going to
[19:12] Rapture he's going to snatch up all the
[19:14] Believers who are filled with the Holy
[19:15] Spirit and then he's going to pour out
[19:17] his wrath he's going to keep all those
[19:19] Saints in his heart up in heaven
[19:21] Hallelujah he's going to keep them close
[19:22] to his heart and they should have all
[19:24] the Angels pour out all the wrath upon
[19:26] the Earth he's going to rescue his wife
[19:28] Hallelujah his Believers off the Earth
[19:30] Hallelujah
[19:32] but when he does that the Bible said our
[19:34] bodies will be changed our bodies now
[19:36] are dying they're corruptable but in
[19:39] that moment when he snatches us up we're
[19:40] going to get transformed we're gonna get
[19:42] brand new bodies
[19:44] Hollywood can't touch you I don't care
[19:45] how many movies they make about
[19:47] superheroes and Star Trek and all that's
[19:50] all a perversion
[19:52] but what's good they're getting close to
[19:54] guessing it what is what might be like
[19:56] but it's a perversion God is the one
[19:59] who's going to change our bodies are
[20:00] somehow going to be swallowed up how do
[20:02] you know how do you swallow something up
[20:04] he's gonna the holy spirit's gonna come
[20:06] over and swallow us up we'll have brand
[20:08] new bodies and then we'll start rising
[20:10] up to meet him in the air amen oh what a
[20:13] transformation praise God hallelujah
[20:14] what a blessing now verse 55 oh death
[20:18] where's thy sting
[20:20] oh grave where's thy Victory The Sting
[20:23] of death is sin and the strength of sin
[20:25] is the law but thanks be to God which
[20:27] giveth us the victory through our Lord
[20:30] Jesus Christ amen so Paul before he was
[20:33] martyred before his head was cut off in
[20:35] Rome around 56 A.D or 65 A.D
[20:39] he was trusting that at some point he
[20:42] knew his dead his body will get
[20:44] swallowed up in life and he would get a
[20:46] resurrected body he was trusting in that
[20:48] 2000 years ago here we are today we're
[20:51] still trusting in the same promise but
[20:53] where does that promise come from it
[20:55] comes from the law and the prophets
[20:57] so go to Isaiah chapter 25 now this is
[21:00] why I love this scripture should we get
[21:02] rid of the law should we make void the
[21:04] law no because the law has promises the
[21:07] law and the prophets have promises of
[21:09] your Resurrection amen Isaiah 25 I
[21:13] believe it's verse 8.
[21:18] you know there's famous preachers that
[21:20] uh one's in Georgia
[21:22] and they're not message Believers but
[21:24] there's a famous preacher who says we
[21:26] need to unhook ourselves from the law
[21:29] in other words we don't need to know the
[21:30] law we don't need to read the law
[21:32] we don't need to obey anything in the
[21:34] law and that's a really immature
[21:35] statement
[21:36] and church to me what it's saying is
[21:38] almost uh
[21:40] it's almost like this like well then we
[21:42] don't need the rapture
[21:43] because the Rapture is in the Old
[21:45] Testament praise God
[21:47] Jesus Rapture was in the Old Testament
[21:49] praise God Isaiah 25 verse
[21:53] let's go to let's read verse six because
[21:55] this kind of ties in with the former
[21:57] latter rain
[21:58] and in this mountain shall the Lord of
[22:00] hosts make unto all people a feast of
[22:02] fat things a feast of wine there's the
[22:05] wine on the leaves of fat things full of
[22:07] marrow of wines on the leaves well
[22:09] refined and he will destroy in this
[22:12] mountain the face of the covering casts
[22:13] over all people and the veil that is
[22:16] spread over all nations he will swallow
[22:19] up death in Victory and the Lord God
[22:22] will wipe away tears from off all faces
[22:25] and the rebuke of his people shall he
[22:28] take away from off all the Earth for the
[22:30] Lord has spoken in amen church this was
[22:33] spoken 712 years before Christ
[22:37] so we're coming up on now it's been 2
[22:39] 000 years since Christ was here we're
[22:41] coming up on
[22:42] 2700 years
[22:44] this has been prophesied death is going
[22:47] to be swirled up death is going to be
[22:48] swirled up Paul was trusting in this
[22:50] Hallelujah every believer is trusting in
[22:53] this and now we're trusting in this
[22:55] praise God we will not make void the law
[22:57] will not get rid of the law we'll keep
[22:59] believing in the law praise God
[23:01] we won't now here's what the difference
[23:03] we're not going to find our
[23:04] righteousness in the law because we'll
[23:06] never be able to keep it our
[23:08] righteousness is in Christ but in the
[23:10] law or promises about you and I aren't
[23:13] you glad God wrote about you 2700 years
[23:16] ago he wrote about every Christian every
[23:19] Gentile believer that would be in the
[23:21] Rapture he wrote about you 2700 years
[23:24] ago and church God's promise cannot fail
[23:26] if you're a real saint of God if you're
[23:28] a real believer that your death will be
[23:30] swallowed up in Victory Hallelujah oh I
[23:33] ought to make somebody shout praise God
[23:35] glory I'm gonna Shout
[23:37] hallelujah thank you Jesus
[23:39] so see we don't want to make void the
[23:41] law as far as we don't want to get rid
[23:42] of the law we still need to reference it
[23:44] there's still prophecies in there that
[23:46] we're believing
[23:48] Hallelujah of course we we could go to
[23:50] all the prophecies about the Millennium
[23:52] right
[23:53] you're in there
[23:54] the Bible says
[23:56] uh children will lead lions and lambs
[23:59] and uh wolves children will lead them on
[24:03] a rope
[24:05] imagine a child leading one of those big
[24:07] lines on the Akron Zoo imagine them
[24:09] leaving oh hey come here little guy come
[24:10] on guy he just pulled him around that's
[24:13] what the Millennium is going to be like
[24:14] that's your promise amen okay say like
[24:16] this your children whoever's children
[24:18] are going to lead Lions around and then
[24:20] the lion and wolf will lay down right by
[24:22] the lamb and there'll be buddies
[24:23] cuddling on each other
[24:25] that's a promise I don't want to make
[24:27] that void that promise is true praise
[24:29] God
[24:30] and church while that's going on the
[24:32] Bible said we're going to rule the
[24:33] Nations because we were Believers in
[24:35] Jesus Christ will rule and reign with
[24:37] Christ not for five months or five years
[24:39] but for a thousand years Hallelujah
[24:42] if we can rule over sin Satan the Devil
[24:45] the world and hell and Temptation now he
[24:48] makes us rulers for a thousand years in
[24:51] the Millennium praise God oh what a
[24:53] promise amen
[24:55] so keep ruling over sin today praise God
[24:57] how many will do it
[24:59] we're all going to battle sin but keep
[25:01] crucifying sins and and The Temptations
[25:03] keep crucifying that and if you do rule
[25:06] over that then Jesus will make you a
[25:08] ruler in the millennium
[25:09] he promised it praise God
[25:11] amen what a blessing
[25:14] now don't forget this here I want to
[25:16] look at this also
[25:18] the law was so important now go to
[25:20] Romans 7 12. you got your Bibles Romans
[25:23] 7 12. I want to read this to you
[25:32] people that know the Bible know the law
[25:34] is so important
[25:37] but we do not get our justification from
[25:40] the law we get it through Jesus Christ
[25:43] we're not saved through the law we will
[25:45] never be able to keep I think somebody
[25:46] counted either 613 or 616 laws that they
[25:51] had to follow
[25:52] now if you subtract there's about 200
[25:54] that go to the uh uh the the priests
[25:58] so if you subtract that now you're only
[26:00] down to 400 if you're not a priest none
[26:01] of us are priests here right
[26:04] so then you don't have to keep about 400
[26:06] laws that sounds easier but it's still
[26:08] impossible right
[26:10] oh my
[26:11] God so see we we want to establish the
[26:14] law we want to make it firm because
[26:16] there's promises in there there's types
[26:18] and shadows of Jesus Christ in there
[26:20] there's there's uh our future spoken
[26:23] about in there praise God
[26:25] we establish the law he says in other
[26:27] words we make sure it's firm we don't
[26:29] forget about it but we remember it
[26:31] Romans 7 12 wherefore the law is what
[26:34] church it's holy and the Commandment
[26:37] holy and just and good
[26:42] see people today say God they say well
[26:44] God God gives us rules we're not a rule
[26:47] following Church the Bible says rules
[26:49] are good
[26:50] the Bible says Commandments Are Holy
[26:52] it's only rebellious sinner that doesn't
[26:55] want rules
[26:58] right oh you don't like rules okay well
[27:00] let's go to a property let's go to
[27:01] something you bought whether it's your
[27:03] car and whether it's your home and let's
[27:05] let uh let's let people just demolish it
[27:08] and then say okay that's okay there's no
[27:10] rules just let all these homeless people
[27:11] destroy and they can live in my house
[27:13] they can live in my car and I don't have
[27:14] any place to live would you uh do you
[27:16] still want rules now or not
[27:18] it's foolish to say people don't want
[27:20] rules until it affects them then they
[27:22] want rules
[27:23] like these people that said defund the
[27:25] police and yet they've got police
[27:26] escorts wherever they go
[27:28] bunch of hypocrites
[27:30] right it's a spirit it's a spirit of
[27:32] confusion
[27:34] the Bible says Commandments Are Holy
[27:36] rules are holy thank God for the rules
[27:39] of the Holy Spirit
[27:40] thank God for them they protect us rules
[27:43] protect us hallelujah
[27:44] like you have the right to care bear
[27:46] arms right you got that rule that's a
[27:49] good rule it protects you gives you a
[27:51] right to a sense of protection by God's
[27:53] grace
[27:55] these are all things that we must
[27:56] remember
[27:58] so the Bible says the Old Testament was
[28:01] good and holy
[28:02] and just it was fair now go to Galatians
[28:05] 3 24. this is what we're familiar with
[28:08] this one's a little bit dear to my heart
[28:09] since I'm a school teacher
[28:12] and should be dear to our homeschooling
[28:14] moms teachers Hearts as well
[28:17] I think Bang's going to homeschool so
[28:19] it's going to be dear to his heart
[28:22] Galatians 3 24 wherefore the law was our
[28:25] school Master to bring us unto Christ
[28:28] that we might be justified by faith
[28:32] right and what kind of teacher was the
[28:34] law was it a uh was it just like a
[28:36] laid-back loose kind of teacher no the
[28:38] law was a strict teacher you break one
[28:40] command you broke all of them
[28:43] so the Bible says the Old Testament law
[28:45] is so strict but it's pointing you so
[28:48] you'll get your justification not in the
[28:50] law but from Christ amen
[28:52] Hallelujah
[28:54] see that's how that's how people's
[28:55] attitude is towards uh the Bible as long
[28:58] as they're keeping the law it's like
[28:59] well I please the teacher I please the
[29:01] teacher but then they know as soon as
[29:03] they break one command the teacher is
[29:05] going to be upset that's how that's how
[29:07] it is when you're trusting in your own
[29:08] Works to be saved but when you're
[29:10] trusting in Grace Hallelujah and then
[29:12] then you have you have confidence when I
[29:14] go to Christ he's not going to get rid
[29:16] of me he's not going to wipe my name off
[29:17] the book he's going to forgive me the
[29:19] Bible said he's ready to Pardon Me
[29:21] praise God he wants to forgive me he
[29:23] wants to forgive us more than we want to
[29:24] go confess our sins
[29:26] right
[29:28] but here we see the laws good holy just
[29:30] and the law was a school Master it was
[29:33] pointing us it was trying to teach us
[29:34] something
[29:35] it was teaching us that salvation
[29:37] doesn't come by animal sacrifice
[29:39] salvation doesn't come by human efforts
[29:42] salvation comes by you receiving the
[29:45] gift of Jesus Christ
[29:47] amen
[29:49] Hallelujah
[29:51] I want to just show you go to Psalms 119
[29:53] it's the longest chapter in the Bible if
[29:55] you've got it Psalms 119 verse 97
[30:03] this is this is beautiful praise God the
[30:05] scriptures are so beautiful Psalms 119
[30:08] verse 97.
[30:13] now mem is the name of a Hebrew letter
[30:15] this chapter has a section that starts
[30:18] with every Hebrew letter in the Hebrew
[30:20] alphabet of course that speaks of how
[30:22] Jesus is the Alpha and Omega the
[30:23] beginning and the end the first and the
[30:24] last right Jesus the first letter the
[30:27] last letter he's everything in between
[30:28] he's our whole language we can't get any
[30:30] language without Jesus praise God he's
[30:32] our everything
[30:34] Psalms 119 verse 97 ma'am oh how I love
[30:38] thy law and preachers will say they
[30:40] despise the law
[30:42] how different are they from David
[30:45] right a man after God's Own Heart
[30:47] God's law it is my meditation all the
[30:50] day all the day I'm thinking about the
[30:51] scriptures
[30:52] what scriptures were you thinking about
[30:54] yesterday were you thinking about him
[30:56] if not let's get our minds back on the
[30:57] scriptures
[30:59] see when you meditate on God's word it
[31:01] makes you what sad or happy Church what
[31:03] does it make it makes you happy
[31:06] put a sermon on and find a scripture
[31:07] just meditate on that scripture all the
[31:10] day long praise God
[31:12] it's my meditation all day long verse 98
[31:15] thou through thy Commandments has made
[31:18] me wiser than mine enemies for they are
[31:20] ever with me so David was always around
[31:22] his enemies but he saw how the word of
[31:24] God made him wiser you ever seen that
[31:26] you know you maybe you told a friend not
[31:28] to do something you told your friend
[31:29] about the word of God they they went
[31:31] against your advice and then they ruined
[31:33] something in their life
[31:34] because they went against the word of
[31:36] God
[31:37] right we told people
[31:39] I've told people not to get married
[31:41] because they weren't Believers and they
[31:42] went ahead and got married and runes
[31:44] ruins their life they're now divorced
[31:46] or they're in worse condition they try
[31:49] to warn them and give them warnings and
[31:51] if they just would have obeyed the word
[31:52] of God it would have been all right
[31:54] the marriage might have worked out
[31:56] because they would not have married that
[31:57] one they would have waited till they got
[31:58] the one that God had for him
[32:00] right that's what that one brother years
[32:03] ago
[32:04] I shouldn't call the name but
[32:05] tried to warn the brother
[32:09] and see the word of God it's just
[32:11] humbling ourselves to trusting God's
[32:13] wisdom rather than our own wisdom
[32:15] right
[32:17] trust in the wisdom of God not in the
[32:19] wisdom of man
[32:20] verse 99 I have more understanding than
[32:23] all my teachers
[32:25] for thy testimonies are my meditation
[32:27] that means his teachers weren't
[32:28] meditating on God's word that'd be a
[32:31] pretty bad situation to be in
[32:33] right you got teachers but they don't
[32:34] know the word of God well I think all of
[32:36] us can probably say we went if we went
[32:37] to public schools that was the case
[32:38] right
[32:40] or even going to college now right
[32:43] or AP classes or whatever you're in
[32:45] not to be prideful but if you meditate
[32:48] on God's word you're actually wiser than
[32:50] your instructors
[32:52] right that's the word of God go to uh
[32:55] verse 103 of the same chapter Psalm 119
[32:58] 103.
[33:00] oh Church my what a promise how sweet
[33:04] are thy words unto my taste yay sweeter
[33:07] than honey to my mouth
[33:10] Hallelujah David would just he would
[33:13] just think about the word of God it was
[33:14] like he was eating honey
[33:16] yesterday I had syrups I didn't have
[33:17] honey but I had syrup on some pancakes
[33:19] boy were they sweet yesterday right
[33:21] that's some sweet syrup but David says
[33:23] the only thing I compare to meditating
[33:25] on God's word is honey
[33:28] anybody had any honey lately
[33:29] a couple people all right good well
[33:32] that's a good that's a good natural
[33:33] reminder of what God's word is like when
[33:36] you really put trust in it I'm not
[33:38] talking about just here and then forget
[33:39] about it I'm talking about meditating it
[33:41] all throughout the day
[33:43] Hallelujah and then it becomes sweet to
[33:46] you it becomes I mean that Isaiah
[33:48] scripture that all be sweet to us
[33:49] brother amen one day death will be
[33:52] swallowed up in life like in a brand new
[33:54] body and I got a body like Jesus's own
[33:57] body praise God
[33:58] that ought to be sweet to our taste one
[34:01] day Hallelujah death will be swallowed
[34:03] up in life there'll be no more aches no
[34:05] more pains no more worries no more
[34:07] Sorrows of a perfect body with a perfect
[34:09] mind I mean just like Jesus Hallelujah
[34:12] oh my thank God
[34:15] this made David say your words are
[34:17] sweeter than honey to my mouth
[34:20] oh Hallelujah that's why I was singing
[34:22] that song before or as we come up here
[34:24] uh
[34:25] you know his love I could sing him his
[34:27] love forever
[34:28] why because his love is so great because
[34:30] the promises of his love give us the
[34:33] promise of eternal life blessings in
[34:35] this life praise God
[34:37] we have so many great precious promises
[34:39] the Bible tells us
[34:41] go to verse uh
[34:43] 165 last one out of Psalm 119. Psalm 119
[34:47] verse 165.
[34:52] see people get stressed out they get
[34:54] anxious they get nervous because they
[34:56] don't meditate on God's word and we're
[34:58] all guilty but we all need reminders
[35:00] that's why we all come here praise God
[35:04] the Bible doesn't say a little bit of
[35:05] peace
[35:07] the Bible says great peace
[35:09] have they which love thy law
[35:13] and nothing shall offend them praise God
[35:16] hallelujah the enemy can't overcome them
[35:19] right
[35:20] uh their brother or sister mom or dad
[35:22] can't can't make them uh leave this
[35:25] atmosphere of love this atmosphere of
[35:27] Peace nobody can move them is that what
[35:29] the Bible says God will make us so
[35:31] strong that we shall not be moved amen
[35:34] hallelujah
[35:36] no one will be able to move us out of
[35:37] our state of peace out of our state of
[35:39] love because of God's law that we
[35:42] meditate on we think about God's
[35:44] promises we think about God's mercy oh
[35:46] and we are the benefactors we're the
[35:48] we're the objects of God's love
[35:50] Hallelujah
[35:52] oh what a blessing amen
[35:54] all right now go to Romans chapter 4
[35:55] verse 1.
[35:59] Romans 4 verse 1.
[36:08] all right so begin chapter four today by
[36:10] God's grace
[36:15] Romans 4 verse 1. now this section is in
[36:18] the same section
[36:20] about God solves the guilt problem
[36:23] through justifying Believers through
[36:26] faith in Christ
[36:27] so remember the first three chapters all
[36:29] about there's no hope for the sinner
[36:30] there's no hope for Jew or Gentile
[36:32] anyone there's no hope at all so the
[36:34] only hope is Faith in Jesus Christ
[36:37] oh hallelujah thank you Jesus Romans 4
[36:39] verse 1. what shall we say then that
[36:42] Abraham our father as pertaining to the
[36:44] flesh hath found
[36:47] for If Abraham were justified by works
[36:50] he hath whereof to Glory but not before
[36:53] God so think about this Abraham's called
[36:56] the friend of God he's called the father
[36:59] of our faith and yet he cannot even
[37:02] boast before God about his works
[37:06] the Father the the one who started the
[37:08] Jewish faith right the one who the
[37:10] Christian faith goes back to him as well
[37:12] the man that God chose to start a holy
[37:15] nation a holy group of spiritual group
[37:17] of believers
[37:19] the very man himself has nothing to brag
[37:22] about before God
[37:24] the church remember where did he start
[37:25] with who remembers where he started with
[37:26] he started near the Tower of Babel he
[37:29] was an idolater
[37:30] he was a maker of Idols he was
[37:33] worshiping dead things right with his
[37:34] dad
[37:35] he was worshiping Idols that couldn't
[37:37] talk back but then God started talking
[37:39] to him amen aren't you glad God talked
[37:41] to you as well praise God he called you
[37:43] out of your sinful lifestyle and now he
[37:45] talks to you yes sometimes through
[37:47] dreams or Vision sometimes like sister
[37:48] who you might hear the voice of God
[37:50] right under testimony there
[37:52] to speak to your heart you'll get a
[37:54] conviction on your heart you'll get a
[37:56] voice you'll get some some uh some
[37:58] Heavenly instruction come right to your
[38:00] mind God talks to us now and he talks
[38:03] words of Peace words of Victory great
[38:06] peace the Bible says amen great peace
[38:09] gives the Holy Spirit to all those who
[38:11] trust in him praise God
[38:13] oh my
[38:17] so Abraham will not be declared
[38:20] righteous by his Works God will not say
[38:23] look at Abraham look at all the works
[38:25] that he did now I'll save him because of
[38:26] what he did
[38:28] that's not how Abraham was going to be
[38:29] saved he's not saved by works
[38:32] verse 3. for what saith the scripture
[38:36] Abraham believeth God hallelujah amen
[38:41] and it was counted unto him for
[38:44] righteousness
[38:46] oh that's beautiful
[38:48] Glory
[38:50] see it takes a belief in God can I say
[38:53] it like this church for Sinners and if
[38:56] we remember when we got saved what was
[38:58] just the first thing we had to do we
[38:59] just had to believe God
[39:01] remember Hebrews 11 said God's rewarder
[39:04] of them that diligently seek him
[39:07] and like Jesus said all it takes to be
[39:10] become a fruitful Christian is Faith
[39:12] Like a mustard seed I wish I would have
[39:14] brought the Mustard Seed I probably lost
[39:15] it but you can buy a container or
[39:17] mustard see there's like a thousand
[39:18] mustard seeds in there it's so small
[39:21] in other words our faith is so small but
[39:24] if we keep adding God's word to it we
[39:26] keep worshiping God it'll grow into
[39:28] something great it'll grow into a
[39:29] testimony that glorifies God Almighty oh
[39:32] my praise God hallelujah
[39:36] so take that seat of faith and just keep
[39:38] believing God plant that faith in Jesus
[39:41] Christ water it every day with your
[39:43] prayers your Bible reading your worship
[39:45] your church attendance singing to God
[39:47] just keep watering it it's going to grow
[39:49] into something great and pretty soon
[39:51] you'll start seeing the fruits of the
[39:52] Holy Spirit
[39:54] amen
[39:56] what a promise ah
[40:01] so Abraham just believed I just believe
[40:04] God's word
[40:05] and now God counts it to him as being
[40:08] righteous righteousness right verse 4.
[40:12] now to him that worketh is the reward
[40:14] not reckoned of Grace
[40:17] but of debt
[40:20] right
[40:21] so when we just believed God it's a
[40:24] reward of Grace
[40:25] and it's not like well God owes me
[40:27] something church God doesn't owe us
[40:29] anything
[40:30] right
[40:32] the Bible said in Acts 17 that God
[40:33] doesn't really need anything
[40:35] right he can just exist he doesn't have
[40:37] to have anything to exist he self-exists
[40:39] amen that's what John Yahweh means a
[40:42] self-existent one
[40:44] Hallelujah the great one the
[40:45] self-existent one Jehovah
[40:48] he doesn't need anything to exist
[40:51] it's by his grace that we exist I'll say
[40:54] like this as far as pleasure that we
[40:56] exist the Bible says
[40:57] amen you were made for God's pleasure
[41:02] okay so see we get the reward of Grace
[41:04] if we believe in Jesus Christ
[41:07] it's not well I believe so I get the
[41:08] reward and of the debt and God owed me
[41:11] because I believed in him he owed me so
[41:13] now he's going to give me righteousness
[41:16] not of debt it's by grace
[41:21] so church I'll just say like this uh any
[41:24] brother even brings it down to Divine
[41:26] Healing right anything that we have need
[41:28] of whether it's Divine Healing today
[41:30] was our financial need
[41:32] we might need forgiveness today
[41:35] right whatever we need of maybe we need
[41:37] a Praying for a spouse
[41:39] for our young ladies and young men
[41:42] praying for children
[41:44] whatever you're praying for we should
[41:46] pray and ask God Lord by your grace I'm
[41:49] asking you give this to me as a gift of
[41:50] Grace
[41:52] it's never going to be a gift of works
[41:55] it's going to be a gift of Grace it's
[41:57] not God you owe me this and you owe me a
[41:59] spouse or you owe me this that's not it
[42:01] it's Lord I would like this as a gift of
[42:04] your grace but either way we should say
[42:06] let thy will be done hallelujah
[42:09] let's ask for God's will in our lives
[42:12] not our own will
[42:14] it's okay to express our desires to God
[42:16] but really the child of God is able to
[42:19] trust God with their entire life
[42:22] and we got to learn to do that
[42:24] right we're learning to Die daily as the
[42:27] Bible says submit submit yourselves
[42:29] therefore unto the mighty hand of God
[42:31] resist the devil and he will have to
[42:33] flee praise God
[42:34] amen
[42:37] so it's a it's and that's what brother
[42:39] Brandon said you know in works is Faith
[42:41] expressed with Divine Healing if you
[42:43] need healing just say Lord I'm going to
[42:45] keep believing until you give me this
[42:46] gift of Grace brother man said if you
[42:47] ever had Faith to be healed it was a
[42:49] gift of Grace
[42:50] oh my I always say think about the
[42:53] Miracles you've had in your life brother
[42:54] every single one of them was a gift of
[42:57] Grace praise God
[42:58] you didn't earn it I didn't earn it
[43:00] nobody earned it it was all gifts of
[43:03] Grace praise God
[43:05] it was God's unmerited favor
[43:08] you know tonight I'll go through the
[43:10] times you know the Lord has allowed me
[43:11] to speak to mountains right you have a
[43:13] sheriff numerous times
[43:16] uh we'll look at times brother random
[43:17] spoke to some mountains by faith
[43:19] and each time he said it was God leading
[43:23] me to do it
[43:24] it wasn't him like well I like to do a
[43:26] miracle today what Miracle could I do
[43:27] today because I'm so holy that's that's
[43:30] impossible right even Jesus said I the
[43:33] son can do nothing of himself but what
[43:35] he sees the father do the son doeth
[43:37] likewise praise God Amen oh my in other
[43:40] words we're distrusted we're waiting on
[43:41] God's timing we're waiting on God's
[43:43] grace amen for God to move and really
[43:46] finish his story that he's writing in
[43:49] our lives that he started praise God
[43:51] oh God started my testimony God saved me
[43:54] out of my sins and God's gonna bring me
[43:56] to heaven with him praise God
[43:58] he started my salvation he's going to
[44:01] finish it amen hallelujah praise God I'm
[44:05] happy today church are you happy today
[44:06] by God's grace
[44:09] well thank God thank God for Amazing
[44:12] Grace Hallelujah
[44:13] oh thank you Jesus
[44:17] it just makes me happy just to you know
[44:19] I battle you know you probably battle it
[44:21] too I battle feeling like I've earned it
[44:24] oh have been good enough today
[44:25] have I been have I studied enough now
[44:28] for where God can send his spirit it's
[44:30] never going to be enough
[44:31] right we'll never we'll never have
[44:33] enough so we have to just follow the
[44:35] word of God the best we can and then God
[44:37] in his moments of Grace will pour out
[44:39] his grace Upon Us praise God
[44:42] oh amen thank God be faithful right
[44:44] watch him pray Jesus says
[44:48] keep watching and praying
[44:49] God is perfecting the Bible said uh the
[44:53] Bible said I will praise the Lord for he
[44:55] will perfect that which concerneth me
[44:59] Hallelujah how do you believe that he's
[45:01] going to perfect your life
[45:04] it may not look like it's going to work
[45:05] out it may not look like it's going to
[45:08] be good or something but the bible
[45:10] promises if you trust in God
[45:12] he will perfect those things that
[45:14] concern you in other words he'll bring
[45:16] it to completion what he's trying to do
[45:18] in your life praise God
[45:20] Hallelujah no breeds of completion
[45:22] that's what he does amen
[45:24] Hallelujah
[45:26] he's got to do it praise God he's the
[45:28] all the Bible said he's the author and
[45:30] finisher of your life
[45:32] praise God
[45:35] amen I really I want to just maybe if I
[45:37] could I want to get down to verse 11
[45:39] where when I would close in about 15
[45:41] minutes here or so by God's grace that
[45:44] way I just preach you all or just preach
[45:45] an hour and five minutes at the Amish or
[45:47] at the Junction City Church so that was
[45:49] a real short sermon for me I really I
[45:51] really enjoyed that I hope you're
[45:52] enjoying the word of God today by God's
[45:54] grace
[45:55] now verse five Romans 4 verse five
[45:58] that's be I just love preaching through
[46:00] the books like this
[46:01] because you see the whole picture
[46:04] there's times that you know like tonight
[46:06] when we look at souls in prison now I'll
[46:07] just go scripture by scripture all
[46:08] around the Bible but it's so nice just
[46:10] to read through it and see God's truths
[46:12] in here and compare it with the rest of
[46:14] the scriptures
[46:15] because this is thus saith the Lord
[46:16] right this is thus saith God
[46:18] verse 5 Romans 4 verse 5. but to him
[46:21] that worketh not
[46:23] but believeth so see
[46:25] believe is opposite of human works
[46:30] so see when someone's trying to earn
[46:31] their salvation they really don't
[46:33] believe and they're not really putting
[46:34] any trust in God they're putting trust
[46:36] in themselves well if I work harder if I
[46:38] do more then God will forgive me no
[46:41] God wants you to just believe he
[46:43] forgives me amen just believe it because
[46:46] he said so Hallelujah
[46:48] he said so
[46:50] right the Bible said confess your sins
[46:52] and he will he will be faithful and just
[46:55] to cleanse you of all unrighteousness
[46:58] just confess them say God I'm sorry
[46:59] forgive me God help me to be stronger
[47:02] next time give me strength so I don't
[47:04] fall to that sin next time and the Bible
[47:05] said he gives you his righteousness amen
[47:09] oh
[47:10] what a blessing amen
[47:13] thank you Jesus
[47:15] verse five yeah we're trying to cool
[47:16] down here thank you
[47:18] there's my 45 minutes all right so
[47:20] verse 5 but to him that worketh not but
[47:23] believeth on him that justified the
[47:24] ungodly his faith is accounted for
[47:27] unrighteousness
[47:28] I'm sorry for righteousness
[47:31] so church if we believe on God that God
[47:36] justifies Sinners Like Us then the Bible
[47:39] said God counts that for your
[47:41] righteousness I believe God forgives you
[47:43] of all your sins
[47:45] now you're righteous you're righteous
[47:47] that's the Simplicity of the Gospel if
[47:51] you just believe God will forgive you
[47:52] then the Bible said he will
[47:56] that he just forgives You by Grace by
[47:59] faith
[48:00] Hallelujah
[48:02] oh what a what a blessing this is verse
[48:05] six
[48:06] even as David also who does he go back
[48:08] to the man after God's Own Heart
[48:11] Hallelujah even as David also described
[48:14] the blessedness of this man well here's
[48:16] a man that murdered and was an adulterer
[48:21] and he can describe the blessings of
[48:23] justification
[48:26] what a perfect example to use amen what
[48:29] a perfect example he doesn't deserve it
[48:31] but yet he still gets it Hallelujah we
[48:35] don't deserve justification but we still
[48:37] get it praise God Amen
[48:40] glory and church will have to take a
[48:42] whole another sermon and just go over
[48:43] Abraham's failures
[48:45] yes he was a man of Faith but it might
[48:48] help us to remember sometimes all of his
[48:50] failures
[48:51] and still he was declared righteous
[48:55] in the sight of God because he believed
[48:57] God
[48:59] he doesn't believe he wasn't trusting in
[49:01] his righteousness he was trusting in
[49:03] God's mercy
[49:07] Abraham in other words was a repeated
[49:09] liar
[49:10] now don't raise your hands but we've all
[49:12] lied
[49:13] I have to say who's lied I already know
[49:15] you've lied and if you don't I know
[49:16] you're lying you just started today
[49:18] right
[49:19] don't start lying in church either
[49:21] that's a bad bad thing to do
[49:24] right but look at this Abraham was a
[49:26] repeated liar he ran when things got
[49:28] tough in a drought he ran from the
[49:30] prince of God and went down to Egypt he
[49:33] went down to a place of sinners
[49:36] he was so brother random calls him
[49:38] cowardly now that's brother Adam's work
[49:40] he was such a coward he gave his wife
[49:42] over to two different Kings and didn't
[49:44] stand up for his wife
[49:45] now sisters how would that make you feel
[49:47] if your husband doesn't stand up for him
[49:50] and brothers we've all probably failed
[49:51] our wives at some point right we didn't
[49:53] pray enough
[49:55] intercede enough didn't care enough
[49:56] right
[49:58] right this is what Abraham did
[50:00] and then Abraham takes Hagar
[50:04] he takes a second wife he lets his wife
[50:06] talk him into having another wife which
[50:09] only caused trouble
[50:13] and then the wife gets mad at him
[50:16] she got mad at him
[50:19] you're the one who talked me into this
[50:22] in other words we we hear these names
[50:23] and we think instant Perfection and
[50:25] total righteousness they had no
[50:27] righteousness but God's righteousness
[50:30] and yes they learn to obey but they
[50:34] didn't earn salvation Glory
[50:37] Church you didn't earn salvation God say
[50:39] like this God chose you for salvation
[50:43] God chose you to be saved amen and you
[50:46] just responded Hallelujah and you
[50:48] received it by faith and now Christ
[50:50] gives you his righteousness and now
[50:53] you're forgiven and all your sins are
[50:54] remitted set far away and now you are
[50:57] the righteousness of Christ
[50:59] ah Hallelujah
[51:02] just wish there was a way I could say it
[51:03] where it was more impactful praise God
[51:05] if I just say holy spirit you know help
[51:07] let the people receive it despite my
[51:10] failures or my lack of words maybe but I
[51:13] trust you're receiving what God's word
[51:15] says about you praise God
[51:17] amen
[51:21] so David says you get the righteous of
[51:23] God without your works
[51:25] that's why I always go back to the thief
[51:27] on the cross he had no works
[51:29] he was a thief and he was being killed
[51:32] and it was just he was justly dying the
[51:34] true picture of us amen we deserve to be
[51:37] crucified
[51:39] but all he does is he stands up for
[51:40] Jesus and said Jesus did nothing wrong
[51:43] and he said remember me when you come
[51:45] into your kingdom
[51:47] and he doesn't say well maybe after 10
[51:49] years of purgatory I'll let you in
[51:52] he said today you'll be with me in
[51:55] Paradise amen hallelujah today
[51:58] Hallelujah today it was instant into the
[52:01] paradise of God and that beautiful
[52:03] praise God oh my God
[52:05] all he did was basically confess and say
[52:07] we're worthiness he's not worthy he said
[52:10] today you'll be with me in Paradise oh
[52:12] my church if if God if time goes on and
[52:14] one of us go to the Grave one by one we
[52:17] can be assured we'll be with Christ in
[52:19] Paradise amen
[52:20] but Paradise has a new location it's not
[52:22] in the heart of the earth anymore now
[52:24] it's up in the Heavenly Realm
[52:26] Hallelujah so we won't go down when we
[52:28] die we go up praise God
[52:30] Hallelujah
[52:34] ma what a promise
[52:36] so how does David describe this forgiven
[52:39] believer verse 7.
[52:40] how did he describe he said blessed are
[52:43] they whose iniquities
[52:45] are forgiven iniquity means lawlessness
[52:49] blessed are they whose Lawless sins
[52:53] are forgiven and whose sins are covered
[52:56] over
[52:58] Hallelujah they just cover God just
[53:00] covers over all your sins don't see him
[53:03] anymore
[53:04] praise God
[53:06] blessed is that man
[53:08] who God does not impute iniquity
[53:11] in other words I don't I don't pay you
[53:12] back for all the sins you did in fact I
[53:15] cover over all your iniquities
[53:19] you don't see any more
[53:21] praise God oh what a blessing
[53:25] verse 8. blessed is the man to whom the
[53:30] Lord will not impute sin
[53:33] see church people say oh man this person
[53:36] got a five million dollar contract he's
[53:38] blessed not exactly
[53:40] that contract might take him
[53:42] to places he never the Bible said riches
[53:45] many times are a snare
[53:48] that's what the Bible says because
[53:49] people start trusting in their riches
[53:52] like I talked to a guy uh
[53:55] I went to college with was it
[53:59] who was it I was talking with anyways
[54:02] oh yeah my former High School football
[54:03] coach he went to another school and
[54:06] taught and one of his football players
[54:07] played baseball and he just signed a 63
[54:09] million dollar contract to pitch I
[54:10] forget I think it's the Toronto or I
[54:12] member's name I have to text him and
[54:14] look it up but he was rejoicing in that
[54:16] and I'm thinking well yeah I mean I'm
[54:17] kind of jealous of that in my flesh but
[54:20] who's more Rich if you just have 63
[54:22] million dollars and don't have salvation
[54:24] or you have a few dollars like us
[54:27] and you have salvation amen who's more
[54:30] blessed and which one would be more uh
[54:33] which one should you get more happiness
[54:34] about
[54:35] the blood of Jesus Christ amen
[54:37] hallelujah the greatest reward the
[54:40] greatest Victory the greatest blessing
[54:41] you could have blessed is the man who
[54:43] God forgives all of his sins amen
[54:46] I'm happy for the guy I'm glad you got
[54:48] to reach that level of being a pro
[54:49] that's I didn't reach that level I only
[54:50] made it to college but I'm glad I got
[54:52] the police play in college but that
[54:54] doesn't bring me any spiritual blessings
[54:57] it's just a human a dream or human
[55:00] desire
[55:01] but the Bible said we must set our
[55:03] affections on things above Hallelujah
[55:06] where Jesus sits on the right hand of
[55:08] the throne on the majesty and high
[55:10] praise God
[55:11] amen
[55:14] blessed is the man verse 8 to whom the
[55:17] Lord will not impute the sin
[55:20] that means reckon he won't reckon that
[55:23] Austin sinned he won't reckon well Jose
[55:26] I'm Reckoning you you're sinning you
[55:28] know in other words there's a Day of
[55:29] Reckoning I'm paying you back for all
[55:30] those sins Jose the Bible said blessed
[55:33] is a man that God does not give him a
[55:34] Day of Reckoning
[55:36] in other words church we have nothing to
[55:38] fear on the damn judgment praise God
[55:40] Jesus already took our judgment for us
[55:43] praise God
[55:44] the Bible said he was made sin that we
[55:46] might become the righteousness of God
[55:48] hallelujah
[55:50] there's no Reckoning I'm not going to
[55:52] have to pay for the sins that I
[55:54] committed last week or last year
[55:56] there's no Reckoning because Jesus
[55:59] already took all the punishment on the
[56:00] cross for me now do I have to confess my
[56:03] sins yes I confess them every day yes I
[56:05] confess them this morning or whenever
[56:06] whenever I did him yesterday whatever I
[56:09] confess my sins but I know I'm blessed
[56:11] that Jesus already paid for all my sins
[56:14] because I just believe in him
[56:17] and then my life my Works my Works speak
[56:20] that I believe in him because I'm
[56:22] overcoming them I'm trying to I'm asking
[56:25] for God's help I'll say I'm not trying
[56:26] I'm receiving God's help amen trying
[56:29] works for a little while but at some
[56:30] point you want to start receiving God's
[56:31] strength praise God
[56:33] you might try for a few days or weeks or
[56:36] whatever months years whatever but at
[56:37] some point you got to get the victory
[56:39] you got to receive overcoming Grace
[56:40] Hallelujah
[56:42] because Jesus said to he who overcomes
[56:44] I'll let him sit on the throne right of
[56:47] my father as I am set on my father's
[56:49] Throne Overcomers
[56:52] praise God church I think you're I think
[56:54] you're we're honest right
[56:56] even since we struggle with that are
[56:58] really pleasurable after a while we all
[57:00] get tired of them
[57:02] and the church said
[57:04] so now that to me speaks of God's grace
[57:08] because at some point this used to be
[57:10] satisfying to our flesh but not anymore
[57:12] God let it get old
[57:14] ah thank God God and so it's like and
[57:18] then when it gets old and you don't even
[57:19] want to do it anymore that's God's mercy
[57:22] the Bible said sin is only pleasurable
[57:24] for a season thank God for New Seasons
[57:27] in our lives amen thank God for a new
[57:29] Victory and new Strength thank God that
[57:31] sin gets old and God's love never gets
[57:34] old praise God
[57:36] oh Hallelujah the love of God how rich
[57:39] and pure amen
[57:40] how marvelous and strong praise God it
[57:43] shall forevermore endure the Saints and
[57:46] Angels song praise God oh we got to sing
[57:48] that one here in a little bit by God's
[57:50] grace thank God for the love of God
[57:53] Hallelujah verse 9.
[57:57] cometh this blessedness then upon the
[58:00] circumcision or Jews only in other words
[58:03] do Jews are they the only ones that God
[58:05] covers over all their sins
[58:09] of course you know the answer
[58:10] or upon the Gentiles uncircumcision only
[58:14] for we say that Faith was reckoned to
[58:16] Abraham for righteousness how when that
[58:19] how then was it I'm sorry how was it
[58:21] then reckoned when he was in
[58:23] circumcision or in uncircumcision
[58:27] so for a lot of Abraham's life he wasn't
[58:30] yet circumcised
[58:32] so Paul asked this question was he
[58:34] forgiven before he was circumcised or
[58:37] did it have to be after
[58:39] now Church the same applies today what's
[58:42] the spiritual seal of the Holy Ghost
[58:44] today
[58:46] what is it is it circumcision what is it
[58:48] somebody say
[58:49] what is it
[58:51] the baptism Holy Ghost
[58:54] that's the spiritual seal today did I
[58:56] say that the wrong way
[58:59] okay
[59:00] I was trying to show how in the Old
[59:02] Testament the Seal of being in the
[59:04] Covenant was circumcision
[59:07] but there's a different circumcision
[59:09] today we just read it in chapter two
[59:12] it's the circumcision of the Soul
[59:15] there you go praise God
[59:18] now I'm saying that to get to the verse
[59:20] 11 is where I eventually you want to get
[59:21] I want to close it with verse 11.
[59:24] I'm trying to show you Paul's asking
[59:26] this question when was he forgiven
[59:28] when was he a real believer was it
[59:30] before he got the token you say like
[59:32] that
[59:33] or was it after he got the token
[59:36] I think you know the answer
[59:38] I hope you do by God's grace and I hope
[59:40] it makes you happy today hope it hope it
[59:42] renews your strength in the Lord today
[59:46] hope for you I'll help you see God's
[59:48] Grace afresh today
[59:51] verse 10 okay I already read verse 10.
[59:54] Oh no verse 10. how was it then reckoned
[59:56] when he was in circumcision or an
[59:57] uncircumcision look what he says not in
[1:00:01] circumcision
[1:00:03] so not in Genesis 17
[1:00:07] but in uncircumcision Genesis I'm sorry
[1:00:11] Genesis 12.
[1:00:13] Genesis 12.
[1:00:15] all right so hold your place here hold
[1:00:16] your place here because we're in and end
[1:00:18] with verse 11. go to Genesis 12 verse 1.
[1:00:21] this was spoken around
[1:00:23] 1920 BC
[1:00:29] Genesis 12 and now this is based upon uh
[1:00:32] the historian Usher I think that's how
[1:00:34] you say his name oh sure u-u-s-h-e-r
[1:00:37] -bouchure I'm not sure
[1:00:40] Genesis 12 verse 1.
[1:00:43] now this after the flood of course after
[1:00:44] Tower of Babel
[1:00:47] and then Genesis of Genesis 12 verse 1.
[1:00:49] now the Lord had sent unto Abram get
[1:00:51] thee out of thy country and from thy
[1:00:53] Kindred and from thy Father's House unto
[1:00:55] a land that I will shoe thee and I'll
[1:00:57] make of thee a great nation I'll bless
[1:00:59] thee and make thy name great and thou
[1:01:01] shalt be a blessing
[1:01:02] and I will bless them that bless thee
[1:01:05] and curse him that curseth thee in these
[1:01:09] shall all families of the earth be
[1:01:10] blessed now there's a lot in here
[1:01:12] but I'm going to share it for Kyle's
[1:01:14] sake
[1:01:15] in Galatians Church remember Paul
[1:01:18] applies this scripture to you your
[1:01:20] Abraham seed
[1:01:22] in other words Brother Kyle anyone who
[1:01:24] blesses you God will bless them
[1:01:26] anybody who curses you God will curse
[1:01:29] them
[1:01:30] because God is protecting his children
[1:01:32] praise God what would you do with your
[1:01:34] children would you bless the people you
[1:01:36] know that bless your children of course
[1:01:39] because many times in the natural it's a
[1:01:41] life and death battle especially look at
[1:01:42] the Jews today getting bombed across the
[1:01:44] borders of Israel and all the time God's
[1:01:47] going to bless those who bless Israel
[1:01:48] he's going to curse those who curse
[1:01:49] Israel because he's protected his
[1:01:51] children
[1:01:52] Hallelujah
[1:01:54] but this here is God's first word
[1:01:57] recorded to Abraham and what does he do
[1:01:59] in verse 4.
[1:02:00] now thankfully church he doesn't laugh
[1:02:02] this time but there are times he laughs
[1:02:03] at God's promise
[1:02:05] and that's another one of his human
[1:02:07] mistakes that God looks over
[1:02:10] aren't you glad God looks over your
[1:02:12] mistakes Church
[1:02:14] now we might not laugh at God's promise
[1:02:16] but we might be discouraged oh God we're
[1:02:18] never going to Rapture us or God when
[1:02:20] are you ever going to answer my prayer
[1:02:21] we might not laugh but we might sulk and
[1:02:22] complain
[1:02:24] right there's my hour
[1:02:26] we might get bitter with God
[1:02:28] or he might get angry with God
[1:02:31] but either way it's the same reaction
[1:02:32] it's unbelief
[1:02:34] but God will overcome your unbelief
[1:02:37] God will overcome my unbelief because
[1:02:40] God is going to finish what he started
[1:02:42] hallelujah amen God has a plan God has a
[1:02:46] purpose praise God hallelujah
[1:02:49] and he works everything out to his
[1:02:50] purpose verse four and so Abraham
[1:02:52] departed look he does exactly what God
[1:02:54] says at the beginning
[1:02:57] as the Lord has spoken unto him and lot
[1:02:59] went with him now go to Genesis 17.
[1:03:10] verse 9.
[1:03:13] this is in
[1:03:15] BC
[1:03:17] 1911.
[1:03:19] nine years later
[1:03:23] see at the beginning Abraham just had
[1:03:25] childlike faith God said leave your
[1:03:27] family
[1:03:28] oh and he left and what did that verse
[1:03:30] later say did he obey God all the way no
[1:03:32] my wife's got she's she's catching the
[1:03:35] thought here
[1:03:37] he took lot with him
[1:03:39] he disobeyed God he only partially
[1:03:42] obeyed God Amen
[1:03:44] now church then I'll encourage you when
[1:03:46] you got saved the Bible says repent and
[1:03:48] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:03:50] but sometimes we repent of all of our
[1:03:51] sins
[1:03:52] sometimes we didn't
[1:03:55] right that's why we didn't get the Holy
[1:03:56] Ghost right away and the church said
[1:03:59] that's why we didn't get the Holy Ghost
[1:04:01] right away we still struggle with things
[1:04:02] in our lives
[1:04:04] and yet God's grace was still for us
[1:04:06] amen God's mercy still applied to us God
[1:04:09] still called us his children praise God
[1:04:13] that'll make a Methodist y'all that'll
[1:04:15] make a Baptist shot that'll make a
[1:04:16] message believer shout praise God
[1:04:18] hallelujah thank God Amen
[1:04:21] for the mercy of Jesus Christ Upon Us
[1:04:24] upon us all
[1:04:26] thank God verse 9. and God said in
[1:04:29] Abraham Thou shalt keep my Covenant
[1:04:30] therefore thou and I see it after the in
[1:04:32] their generation this is my Covenant
[1:04:34] which ye shall keep between me and you
[1:04:36] and thy seed after the every man shout
[1:04:37] among you shall be circumcised
[1:04:41] now go down to verse 14. and the
[1:04:43] uncircumcised Man Child whose flesh of
[1:04:44] his foreskin is not circumcised that
[1:04:46] show that Soul rather shall be cut off
[1:04:48] from his people and he hath broken my
[1:04:50] Covenant so this was quite a statement
[1:04:52] if you don't circumcise them they have
[1:04:54] no part in our covenant that means no
[1:04:56] forgiveness that means no blessings that
[1:04:59] means all the curses come upon you
[1:05:01] so you can see why by the Pharisees kind
[1:05:03] of got into this legalism
[1:05:05] well as long as I do the circumcision
[1:05:07] I'm good with God
[1:05:09] but then it became the only one of the
[1:05:11] few things they obeyed
[1:05:12] right because Jesus said you do ties you
[1:05:15] do offerings you do circumcision but
[1:05:17] you've left out judgment Mercy
[1:05:19] and I think Grace was the other one
[1:05:22] or righteousness
[1:05:24] see in other words they were like at a
[1:05:25] spiritual Buffet I just want to do that
[1:05:27] in the Bible I just want to do that but
[1:05:28] I don't want to do all this
[1:05:30] but we should eat the whole book the
[1:05:32] Bible says
[1:05:33] in Revelation 10 John eat the whole book
[1:05:37] thank you for your patience I'm almost
[1:05:38] done okay now go back to Romans 4 11
[1:05:40] here
[1:05:43] when did God oh this is beautiful
[1:05:47] when did God declare Abraham was
[1:05:50] righteous
[1:05:51] was it when he finally got the
[1:05:53] circumcision
[1:05:55] when did it come verse 10 I'm finishing
[1:05:58] verse 10 at the very last sense not in
[1:06:00] circumcision but in uncircumcision
[1:06:04] in verse 11.
[1:06:05] and he received the sign of circumcision
[1:06:08] a seal of the righteousness of the faith
[1:06:12] which he had yet being uncircumcised
[1:06:16] so you see that Abraham started serving
[1:06:19] God
[1:06:21] at the at the beginning there in 1920 BC
[1:06:25] he was saved and forgiven right there
[1:06:28] but nine years later God gives him the
[1:06:31] seal now you're sealed in this Covenant
[1:06:33] but he was already righteous way back at
[1:06:36] the beginning
[1:06:37] church can I say like this you are
[1:06:39] already righteous when you first believe
[1:06:41] in Jesus Christ
[1:06:43] Amen brother Austin I love how he
[1:06:46] amended amen praise God Amen Hallelujah
[1:06:49] I was already righteous before I came in
[1:06:51] the message when I first got saved at
[1:06:53] the athletes in action Congress I was
[1:06:55] already righteous back there praise God
[1:06:57] but then all these years later God gives
[1:07:00] me the gift of the Seal of the baptism
[1:07:02] of the Holy Ghost but I was already
[1:07:03] forgiven back there I was already God's
[1:07:06] child but here he just gives a seal that
[1:07:08] you are my child praise God oh
[1:07:10] hallelujah thank God Amen in other words
[1:07:13] you already had the faith at the
[1:07:15] beginning that you need to take you all
[1:07:17] the way there and what God finished that
[1:07:19] same Faith he put at you in the
[1:07:21] beginning that same faith if you keep
[1:07:22] feeding it and growing in it will take
[1:07:24] you all the way home praise God let's
[1:07:26] stand to our feet by God's grace
[1:07:28] musicians can come
[1:07:30] Hallelujah
[1:07:33] oh my I'm gonna finish that verse that
[1:07:35] he might be the father of all them that
[1:07:37] believe
[1:07:38] though they be not circumcised
[1:07:41] that righteousness might be imputed unto
[1:07:44] them also see here Paul is saying you
[1:07:47] are righteous and saved even before you
[1:07:49] get the seal hmm hallelujah praise God
[1:07:52] how can people not see foolish virgins
[1:07:54] how can they not see it it's right here
[1:07:57] you're already forgiven before you get
[1:07:59] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:02] you're already forgiven you're already
[1:08:04] righteous in the sight of God
[1:08:08] how many are thankful for the
[1:08:09] righteousness of Christ today
[1:08:12] let's bow our heads here as we pray
[1:08:15] church I don't know what spoke to you
[1:08:17] today I trust something from the word of
[1:08:18] God spoke to today maybe it was just a
[1:08:20] word of encouragement
[1:08:22] maybe it was just a fresh reminder of
[1:08:24] how God is gracious to you
[1:08:28] Hallelujah
[1:08:30] I just want you to know churches like
[1:08:32] Abraham
[1:08:33] Abraham was righteous nine years before
[1:08:35] he got the Seal of the token
[1:08:38] he was already righteous God gave it to
[1:08:40] him without that still
[1:08:42] God gave him total forgiveness total
[1:08:45] remission of sins hallelujah thank God
[1:08:49] and so church that ought to encourage us
[1:08:51] no matter where we are on our our walk
[1:08:53] with the Lord
[1:08:54] as soon as we believed and obeyed even
[1:08:56] partially Hallelujah
[1:08:58] Jesus imputed his righteousness for us
[1:09:02] and then yes we must walk on and he'll
[1:09:04] give us signs and visions and Direction
[1:09:06] and understanding and and testimonies
[1:09:09] and healings and victories all these
[1:09:11] things and then he gives us the seal the
[1:09:14] token in our souls
[1:09:16] but we must remember
[1:09:19] Hallelujah that we are righteous when we
[1:09:22] first believed by the grace of God
[1:09:25] in church you all of you know Ephesians
[1:09:27] 1 verse 4.
[1:09:29] that even before we were saved we were
[1:09:32] chosen in the mind of Christ before the
[1:09:34] foundation of the world
[1:09:36] oh Hallelujah
[1:09:39] how many are thankful that you're in
[1:09:40] God's plan
[1:09:42] church we should be so grateful God is
[1:09:44] writing our story
[1:09:45] and he's going to finish it if he
[1:09:47] started it he's going to finish it just
[1:09:48] like he did Abraham's just like he did
