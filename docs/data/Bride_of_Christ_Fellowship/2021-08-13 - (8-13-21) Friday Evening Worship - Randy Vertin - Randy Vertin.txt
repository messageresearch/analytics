========================================

come out minister by god's grace and uh we're just very thankful to have him again he's made a great sacrifice to come so we thank the lord for that his wife was not able to make it so we're sad about that but look forward to future fellowship if the lord would allow it and we sure thank god for brother randy and sister lindsay you know the last time he was here i think was i out i think the last time i was out and so god really showed me what a servant i already knew brother randy was a servant but when i had coven and we were all out that weekend i think he preached four sermons uh and god really showed me what a tremendous servant's heart he had and i surely enjoyed the word i was at home saying amen you know trying to battle off that those aches and pains and uh but that was just a great time for them thank you for doing all the song services man you guys just worked as a great team together that was just such a just meant a lot to me and so i want to try to get brother randy back here as often as i can as his schedule allows because he's extremely gifted and we just want to see him continue to grow in grace and knowledge of the lord he's been uh we're kind of childhood friends we've kind of went to the same church growing up and then god both brought us into the message so just a beautiful thing and uh it's great to see all that god has done in his life here so just love brother randy and uh just ask the lord to lead him and guide him here and and uh and speak uh god's word to us i'm excited for god's word tonight amen praise god hallelujah let's just sing that little song here uh word of god ever true changing me changing you let's just see now of course there's called ancient words as our brother comes to minister god's word it's the first of three services and really looking forward to the word of god this weekend i'm just gonna sit back there and amen and feed feed my soul praise god if there's any needs you know let's bring them up at the end of the third second with oil if there's any other needs and repentance this is a great time to do it praise god it's uh revival he revived our minds though some of us might need to revive when our bodies praise god right you're not born again you need to revive on your soul praise god that your nature would be alive with jesus christ's nature praise god so we're just thankful for this opportunity [Music] foreign [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] me [Music] is [Music] me [Music] is [Music] is me [Music] amen we truly come with our hearts open this evening what could we do without him he said without me you can do nothing and to that i say amen amen i'm so grateful to be here by the grace of god you know appreciate brother jesse for inviting us out and good to see all the familiar faces and maybe some new ones that i hadn't seen before i don't know my memory is not always that good but uh we're grateful to be here by the grace of god i know last time it was we definitely fought a lot of battles when we were here last time but you know what we're still pressing the battle for overcoming you know we overcome by the testimony of jesus christ and by the blood of the lamb and we're still to see soldiers of christ still here standing and fighting and it's encouraging to me you know good to see sister christian again i'm going to get to see you last time and the the new addition to the family and i remember last time when i was here we were talking just about the he was the the the name that he was gonna have and good to see that the lord made good on his promises that he's here and looking strong and just good to see all those things i'm uh encouraged it encourages me and um i just want pray by his grace to be a blessing we'll just go right into the word if we can maybe we'll sing some songs after service or tomorrow or some of the other services but we'll just go right into the word this evening you just pray for me uh you know the more you serve the lord the more real the more you realize that you're nothing without him you know i think about how brother branham would be up on the up on the platform and they say what are you waiting for brother brandon saying i'm waiting for him because he can't do anything without him and that's who we're trusting this evening you know we can do nothing without him so if we could let's just turn in our bibles to philippians chapter 2 verse 5. and also we'll be going to isaiah chapter 55. we'll start in the book of philippians chapter 2 verse 5. familiar passage of scripture just want to share some things that have been on my heart you know if the lord would be gracious to us just to help express it the way he shows it to me in the way you know he's revealed it unto me and words can't you know it's amazing because the scripture says that he chose the foolishness of preaching and it truly is in a way foolish if you think about it because how could natural words really express the supernatural things of god but by he he does that you know to show that it's it's not by power it's not by might it's not by man's ability it's not by my ability as a speaker or your ability even as a hearer to understand but it's by his spirit saith the lord and so we're relying on that holy ghost that's among us right now you know we we know by his promises where two or three are gathered he would be there in the midst doesn't matter if you feel him it doesn't matter if you don't feel him doesn't matter if you feel good doesn't matter if you feel bad it doesn't matter what you can see with your eyes or what you can think with your mind or understand it's what he said and when we come to if we could boil it down to the simplicity of the word of god to just trust what he said that he will be here i could speak all i want to and no matter how much i would want you to understand the things that the lord has shown me i could never do it could how many of us maybe have loved ones that we would love i i expressed this at the church there how you've been preaching but this isn't maybe the direction i want to go but just uh before we even get into the word to understand how simple it is really how many loved ones we would have we would love to just grab them and shake them and just force the word into their hearts and say just take it because it's life but no matter how much that would be our desire a good desire it is to have we desire that it's only it's only god himself that can break it to that heart it's only god himself that could reveal it to an individual you know as much as our desires would be to that it's in his time and it's for his glory you know we want to give all glory to god you know i always appreciate brother jesse you know because his emphasis i have always seen has been upon jesus christ it's not upon any man it's not upon any movement it's not nothing no man but jesus christ no movement but the movement of the spirit of god is what we want to see why because if i could say anything i say lord if there's any mighty thing done while i'm here may it just be because lord you gave me grace just to be here while you did it that's all i want and if i'm not there when he did it i'll rejoice in the testimony of those that were able to be there when he did it that's all we want because whether it be you know done through us or through someone else or the lord whatever vessel he says it's god that gets the glory so that's who we're here to glorify i never want to glorify anything but the name of the lord jesus christ amen so in philippians chapter two verse five scripture we know this and we'll read a couple verses it says let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore god also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things and earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father amen and we'll turn to isaiah chapter 55. uh we'll start at verse 6 seek ye the lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the lord and he will have mercy upon him and to our god for he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but water at the earth and maketh that bring forth and bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto i sent it amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer heavenly father lord jesus lord we're but a humble simple people oh god lord you said even in your word that not many mighty not many rich of the world's goods or intelligent maybe in mind according to the flesh and all these mighty things were called according to the world but you chose the humble things yes lord you chose the the base things of this world lord lord because you get glory in those things oh god lord for you said in in our weakness your strength was made perfect lord lord we even your your servant paul said he said i came not in excellency of speech but in power and demonstration he said i didn't come in carnal strength but in fear and in much trembling and lord how i even feel that way this evening lord knowing that i'm nothing lord but it's fallen my lot lord to stand behind the sacred desk oh god knowing the responsibility that it is oh god to speak to your bride to speak to your people oh god and i would be lord i would be an arrogant individual to think that i could just take my own thoughts and pass them off as your own but lord i believe you've given me an unction lord a thought that's in your word oh god to bring forth to your people lord and far be it for me to express my own ideas or thoughts oh god but may we just take the words that have been spoken oh god and the unction of the spirit and go forth oh god to speak to your people may they receive with open hearts as we even sing the song lord may we have open hearts to receive your word oh god lord and if there be anything that would be spoken oh god that would be of my own mind lord will you forgive me lord may the the hearers spit out the seeds as we heard you're even your prophet say lord we don't want any of those things oh god but just the pure unadulterated word of god for this hour may we just lord just rejoice in that lord knowing that lord you do all things well lord and you said you would be with your people and we just committed now lord that lord we can read the words but only your spirit lord can reveal it to the heart of the believer we commit it right now into your hands we just ask that your perfect will be done in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen you may be seated i just you know i often maybe sometimes seem like i'm rambling at the beginning of a service but i just feel you know kind of almost in a way like the prophet i know i can't do anything until he would give the inspiration i certainly don't have that kind of gift but i i know that until until the lord really gives the utterance you know i'm not my wife would tell you i'm not uh i'm not very good at you know studying as much as others do i just kind of meditate upon the word of god and try to listen to the word of god listen you know to the messenger and try to understand and let the lord drop thoughts in there but then i always find when the lord will give me thoughts to put it down to paper to maybe have notes to have things organized that just fails me so i have to i just i i admit that fault before you because if it seems broken up it's because i i know i have to rely fully upon god to give the inspiration because he didn't give me that gift maybe to be very organized in my thoughts but you know i find you know it helps me to lean upon his arm lean upon his inspiration and you know i i find in our our the time just the thought and i had uh such a even this trip so far has been a blessing to me even though i just got in town yesterday i flew into detroit and and uh was a little far away but the flights were a little bit cheaper and the rental cars were a little bit cheaper and found out that rental cars are in short supply and and you just uh you know you forgive me i maybe if you saw that fancy sports car out there it's not because i wanted it i was supposed to drive a toyota corolla but when they when they when i got to there they said they didn't really have anything so they upgraded me to a fancy ford mustang so it's not that i'm getting puffed up in my flesh and wanting to drive a fancy sports car the lord saw fit to to give me uh you know i thought about it i said well isn't it fitting you know remember we understand a a beast is a power and it's like kind of like i you know and it say the the devil's like well it's just like a red horse you're just riding a red horse like a red horse rider i said you know i said this is a little bit different because i said this one's just covered in the blood of jesus christ and i said i said just like that brother's dream i think that brother brady said i'm riding on it i'm just gonna ride on that on that blood-covered that blood-covered horse all the way into in into eternity so i said you know what lord have your way i didn't i wasn't asking for it i feel a little bit almost ashamed to drive it but you know but the the lord you know the lord knows what he's doing he knows how to humble his people but i had a chance i had a chance to express it to brother jesse you know i had a chance to fellowship with my grandfather and the lord even blessed in that i i dropped by this little hamburger place that i really like to go to that's near where my relatives live up there and i always like to go there because they have really greasy delicious little hamburgers and it's just like a little hole in the wall you know place and i went and got some of those and my plan my initial plan was to go pick up these hamburgers and then go drop by my grandfather's house and surprise him and and so you know like oh let's have lunch together and and everything and i showed up and he wasn't there and i was like well i didn't want to call him because i really i i don't know just it's my heart i always like to show up and just be a surprise i i kind of like doing that i thought it was if i called him it kind of ruined the surprise so i called brother jesse i was like well i'm just going to eat these hamburgers i guess and wait i got the hamburgers i might as well eat them so i started eating the hamburgers and i was like well i i got halfway through it's like well i'll call brother jesse and just let them know i'll come out a little bit earlier than i thought and and weird's like well when we just have some fellowship afterwards i was like well hopefully be there around 6 30 and i hung up and i was eating the last hamburger and within probably not even with a minute of hanging up a brother jesse i was eating the last hamburger and my grandpa pulled up and so i quickly scrambled to call for brother jesse it's like change of plans again and uh but you know brother jesse's always gracious you know in those things and he just said well the lord you know fellowship with your grandfather had a chance to talk with him a few hours which is really nice to see him then i just test to find jesse you know he's he's going to be 84 years old in october and he is like a caleb i mean he lives by himself you know and he's just as sharp and is on the ball mentally as anybody you i mean you wouldn't be able to tell the difference of anybody else you'd meet i mean he can he can talk your ear off he's got you know it's just and he works on other people's houses he's got a truck and he goes and does handyman work for people he he was just telling me when he when he when he came back he said i was just over his neighbor's house they'd been running all these fans and the circuit breaker kept going off and so he went and put in a new circuit breaker for him and was running wire and i i pull up to his house and he's got he's got a two-story house and there's a ladder on the side of the house going all the way up to the roof he climbs he's 84 years old climbs up on the roof of his house and throws branches off when they fall off the trees and i just say i said praise the lord you know and and and uh you know and he serves the lord you know the the best that he can and and he and he was just kind of testifying to me about you know he about the coming of the lord and he said and he said his one he said my one prayer to god was that if i'm gonna see the coming of the lord or be around at the end time he said i just want to be healthy you know and he's healthy the lord has honored that because we know we're at the coming of the lord i believe with all my heart that we're we're on the precipice of of the catching of the catching away of the bride you know i believe it's just over that next bend i don't know how it's going to come or or the timing exactly but i really believe we're right there and uh and i was just encouraged to see that the lord even honored his prayer because he's you know i'm sure he has his aches and pains i mean as you get older that's just part of you know the the breaking down of this vessel of clay that we have but to see him i mean he i remember when i was a child probably at least 20 years ago he had major open heart surgery i think he had like a triple or quadruple bypass and i think they put a pacemaker in and that was when he was in his 50s and now he's 84 and still going i was like lord if you can do that for him and just to see to see that if you can do that for this old broken down flesh how much more can you do it for the spirit man for the for the spirit we don't we don't we rejoice over those things but we're looking for a a rejoicing of the inward man you know we're not looking to exalt the the flesh because that's gotta pass away we're gonna drop this away and pick up a a redeemed body but we're looking for something we're looking for a city whose builder and maker is god so you know i was just greatly grateful for that it encouraged me you know i really you know try to drop in a few things here and there as much as i can you know to maybe push like there's something a little bit more than you know with the message of the hour to try to push to that and we're just planting seeds and you know and trusting that the lord would bring that to fruitfulness and we left from there and i talked to my wife when i was driving i was planning on just coming right out here and getting to the hotel at about 10 30 or so and and then i just kind of thought well i was thinking because i know brother simon was initially going to come out with us and join us and he wasn't able to and uh and i was thinking about calling brother cam but i know he's kind of on his little kind of a mini vacation out there and i was like well i don't really want to bother him i was like i'll just call brother simon and say hello since we're not going to get a chance to see each other and uh wouldn't you know it you were eating they were eating dinner in uh in in toledo and it was maybe just 10 15 minutes off the path or so that i was driving and he's like we're at texas roadhouse he's like do you want something you know brother simon he's just like you want something i was like i was like you know what brother order me a steak so i had to order me a steak and and i just went off there and was able to fellowship with him we had a wonderful time and it's just the lord knows how to to just you know he he i even when we read the scripture he can you know in ephesians that says we'll read that scripture maybe later it says he'll do abundantly even about what you can ask or think you know and the lord knew the desire of my heart maybe that we didn't get to see each other but we just gave a little taste you know a fellowship that we might not have been able to have otherwise and and by the grace of god i got that bill from brother simon and he didn't even know it and if anybody you know brother simon he he you got to get up pretty early in the morning to get a bill on brother simon but uh i was so i was rejoicing in that so i was grateful i i told brother simon i i went in there and i was kind of surveying the land i felt like the spies and you know the spies going over the promised lane i went into the texas roadhouse and i was kind of looking around and i didn't see him in the front half of the the building and i was kind of scanning and i looked out and he was at a table like all the way at the other end straight through and i saw him and i kind of backed off a little bit and i found a waitress and flagged her down and i was like i was like do you see that guy over there in the glasses over there and and she's like i can't really see him because i don't have my glasses on and i kind of we leaned over there to kind of look and he looked right at me all the way across he looked right at me but he didn't recognize me for as i said his eyes were where his eyes didn't didn't behold me at the time the lord kind of laid it on there and we were able to track down the waitress and i gave her my credit card i said i don't care what this guy says i said you pay for the meal with this card and so we were able to do that and that was a blessing but to have the the fellowship and everything so i just i appreciate the little things that the lord does for us you know so many times we're looking for all these great major things and surely we get those too and sometimes we look we don't look enough to those things but i i certainly don't want to ever overlook you know the little things that who has despised the day of small things you know and he does because he's mindful if he's mindful the big things he's mindful of the little things you know i i i you think about the fact that the lord cared so much that he made food that you would like to eat that you would enjoy he made he made uh places that you would like to go and behold beauty and you could see that he thought about you when he made those things he wasn't just making it for himself he was designing it i believe even brother branham in some ways talked about you know for for a man getting married to a wife and how he would want to know all the things in the way she liked it in such a way to design it a certain way so that she could enjoy it and god has done that in this life for us you know he knew that i would like the color blue and and brother jesse just do because he's wearing a blue suit and we're all a lot of us wearing blue this evening and i'd say you know praise the lord for that because you know the lord doesn't he doesn't do anything without a purpose you know he doesn't he didn't make steak it's where i would love it the way i do if it wasn't for the fact that i believe he had me in mind when he made it you know i and that's maybe a little thing but i rejoice when i get to enjoy those things because you know god thought about me when he did that and he thought about you when he made the things that he allowed you to enjoy even though they may be little and and he thought about you when he brought the atmosphere of the holy ghost that we could enjoy and rejoice in his presence you know it's not we realize worship worship isn't even just about us but it's about him but it's not even just about him but it's about us to come into fellowship with him to because he knows that the only place we could be complete is in his presence because the only place he could be complete is when we're with him and so he designed these things in such a way so i just say all that is just a little testimony even since i've been here you know i i i've asked the lord many times like lord don't let me go over the top of these things and miss the little things that you're doing because i wanna those are testimonies to me maybe it seems little to you but i see something along the lines of you know within a minute or it might have even been less than a minute of hanging up with brother jesse the lord knew my heart's desire was to flush with my grandfather and he pulls up there right when you know he knew my heart's desire that's not a small god doesn't do anything by accident the world likes to pawn everything off of even very creation is just an accident of happenstance and things just happened and you're an accident and here you are because primordial goo mutated over the course of billions and billions of years you're not an accident god has you right here at bride of christ fellowship on this evening i don't know what the date is today on friday the 13th the world calls it a spooky thing you know it's a superstitious day but god has you here and it's not a superstition but it's the power of god to bring you here on this evening to hear the word of god god doesn't do anything by accident he doesn't make mistakes our god is perfect and holy we don't give him enough glory we don't rejoice in him enough many times because we think woe is me and and i'm not even going anywhere i was thinking in the in there but we'll get into the word here in a second but he'll often times what would be and why is this happening you're right where god needs to be even if you made a mistake yeah you may have made mistakes and put yourself in situations and in the improv in the permissive will of god but if but god our prophet told us god has a way to take that even and turn it to his perfect will you know to our brother austin that i heard brother jesse talking about god at this moment he he put it on your heart to come back to him for such a time as this it's not an accident yeah many times we suffer things we didn't need to suffer because we didn't listen to his voice because we didn't hearken into his words and we suffered things we didn't have to and we put ourselves in bad positions but that's why paul said forgetting those things that are behind i press towards the mark of the high calling i don't know whether or not it was god's perfect will that paul stood there at the stoning of stephen but i do know that our prophet said that god used that to drive paul to never make those mistakes again so even in that he could rejoice so don't let the devil make you think that any mistakes that happen or anything that god can't you yes we we ought to repent of those things we ought to actually have a godly sorrow i don't think we saw her enough sometimes because sometimes we get so predestinated we just relax the days ago we turned the grace of god to lasciviousness oh well god you must have predestinated that i was actually talking to to brother brooks uh brother isaiah brooks uh yesterday when i was flying and he kind of made that same statement that just stuck with that struck me he said so many times we get so predestinated to where we think oh god you must have seen that mistake that must have been your will no it wasn't god's will that it would happen but he knew that it would and he provided a sacrifice to cover that mistake we don't rejoice in the mistake but we rejoice in a god who can use us in spite of our mistakes who can cover up he said it's a it's a it's a it's a greater thing to cover a thing to cover a multitude of sins love covers a multitude of sins love hides the issue god's love his blood hides our iniquities and our sins that we go through every single day praise the lord for that because if it wasn't i wouldn't be here right now all the mistakes i've made in the last month in the last week and the last day and the hour man but praise god there is a blood praise god there is a holy ghost praise god there is a land that was slain before the foundation of the world for my iniquity for your iniquity and what i kind of want to talk about this evening that's just really been on my heart if i would give a title to the message this evening i would just say what are we expecting i find it kind of a it's kind of a i've really had another thing that's really been on my heart and i've listened to the message a couple of couple of them here recently of a paradox and brother bram talks about how a paradox is something that's incredible yet it's true another another uh another definition you could also give for a paradox is something that happens even though there's an apparent contradiction you know in the scientific realm they talk about paradoxes and different things you know they i always i've always been interested in science you know the world worships it now you know but god created science god created the atoms and the molecules and i believe that god can use science for his glory if you would if people would allow it but we see even our prophet seen years and years ago all those years ago he could see that seed of of a religious fervor that would be upon science and how they would man would worship it and become a worshiper of science and what do we see now everywhere science science science if you don't believe this you don't believe in science if you don't do this if you don't believe in god you don't believe in science science tries to disprove god but i'll tell you what god is the only one that can prove science because the things that are made are made of the things that do not appear god said let there be and those little atoms burst into existence you know the scripture says it would be in that day he said there'd be accusations of science falsely so-called they're calling it science and it's just nothing but their their feeble attempt to prove god wrong but that's all right we know where we stand but i thought about i thought about these things and you know a paradox seems to be an apparent contradiction of something that could happen and i i and i just talking about the scientific aspect of it you know i think about they uh i've always interested i know it maybe and lord forgive me if it's a foolish thing to think about i've always found time travel interesting like because it's such a it's kind of uh i guess the way they'd say now it's a mind bender like if you were to do certain things it could change things and and obviously we don't necessarily believe that in the sense and i don't know what the lord would do any other way but they they have this thing in science i just using this in this illustration they call it the grandfather paradox where if you were to go back in time and and maybe like kill your grandfather somehow well then how could that happen because if you did that then you would never be born to be able to go back to do it so it's called a paradox it's a contradiction and so i i i as i read in in the book of philippians here how god it's god works in paradoxes he works in ways that seem to contradict themselves and not in the way that we would think that he would say one thing and do another but i say in paradox if i can say it's a paradox to our natural mind because the scripture says that the carnal mind is enmity with god the carnal mind cannot understand the things of god and and i find the as i meditate upon the word of god and think about the the situations that we're in in life and even in our churches and the and as we're coming to the coming of the lord i feel as though we've just gotten maybe a little too arnold in our thought processes and we're looking at things because scripture says let this mind be in you that was also in christ jesus but then it also goes in in the book of isaiah and he says but my thoughts are above your thoughts and my ways are past your ways so how can this mind be in you see because in one place i believe the lord's talking about our carnal thoughts in our carnal minds his thoughts and his and his holiness and and his purity and his perfection is so far beyond what our carnal mind can comprehend that the only way to get to that is to is to be baptized into that body yourself it's like it's like uh he said he said we saw through a glass darkly but now we see face to face see there was a time in your life before you received this life before you received this host where you looked upon the things of god and it was as it was one of those foggy glasses that that you could see something on the other side but you couldn't make it out it was blurry it didn't make any sense and it doesn't matter how hard you looked at it it wouldn't matter how how much you you you studied that that image in that class you would never be able to make out what was on the other side you would never be able to do it because there's a there's a barrier that was there there there was a sin barrier that that blocked us from being able to truly see the nature of god himself and no matter how much you'd look at it the the prophets in the old testament would try to write it and they wrote as much as as the natural could write down and talked about beasts with their wings and and having seven eyes and and eyes full of eyes round about and things that aren't carnal mind but if we try to conceive it carnally it makes no sense and that's our problem so many times it's where even as believers we're approaching him in a carnal manner and we don't even know it why because the question i have for you this evening is what are you expecting because what you receive is going to be based upon your expectation [Music] we understand that through the message that our prophet preached to us you are going to get what you expect this is why in the world that we're living in now the world is expecting strife on every hand they're exp their expectation is fear their expectation is for destruction and for nothing because that's exactly the anointing that's on them and they will get what they expect but you will get what you expect and the problem i find that's just been impressed upon my heart here recently is brothers and sisters and i don't mean this in a condemnation way i hope we take nothing that said it's condemnation but but maybe as a challenge to get us into a place we need to get we've got to come up higher amen uh uh the hour is too late for us to be playing games with god and to be stuck in a carnal conception of this message that we've received we have received a message from god in our hour brought to us by a vindicated prophet and we've and what we've done i fear is so much of what we've done is try to dissect it with carnal minds we've tried to figure it out we've approached the message in a scientific manner we want to break it down to the atoms and the molecules and what did he say here what did the prophet mean here what did these things mean there and you cannot get it carnally it's got to take the holy ghost supernatural things cannot be understood by the natural did not paul say that he said comparing spiritual and spiritual he said because the the things of god are spiritually discerned but the carnal man is comparing trying to compare them carnally trying to figure out god how are you going to do this oh god what is this going to be exactly what is that going to be exactly and if you approach god that way you'll miss it a mile because instead see god requires simplicity he hid it in simplicity when all the world knew that there was a work of god to come god sent a man named john the baptist come out of the wilderness no education wrapped in skins look like a wild man eating a diet that didn't look normal locust and wild honey and he was born into a family that he should have been well educated but he looked like a black sheep because god had a greater calling for him than just a priesthood and what happened the whole world the world that claimed to be spiritual the church world they knew something was on the horizon to come why because the pharisees the sadducees they were looking for something but what had they done they had formed a carnal interpretation a carnal expectation of what this messiah was to be they had had decided it was going to be this way that god would come in a mighty fashion with the trumpets of heaven sounding right not with a twenty thousand angel salute right but what was it did you know he did that he did it why because they came to shepherds by night one time see the world misses because they're looking for it to come carnally they think they're going to come to the mighty man that they call mighty but what god calls mighty man calls mighty god calls foolish when man calls wise god calls foolish when man comes strong god comes weak i'm coming to a place brothers and sisters i can't we cannot have any pride about us we all want to look like we got it all together we all want to look like we got a we got a full grasp on all this stuff and we just got everything under our thumb i'm going to tell you right now brothers and sisters i am not that way i fight battles i have my ups and i have my downs i have my backwardses and my forwardses and my turnings around and i have my frustrations and my sorrows but i also have my my eyes and won't become human and the problem is just like the world had a conception of what a prophet would be in our day and when a simple man from kentucky who people couldn't see could speak right seemed to say certain things that didn't make sense and didn't match what their idea their cartel mind in person their interpretation of a prophet would be they missed it a million miles just like they always do and if we're not careful we'll get swept into the same thing and not even know it right why you say why do you say that brother i i'll say exactly why i say it because and i am speaking to myself so if this doesn't apply to you well praise be to god but i can tell you right now too many times my my mind gets caught up in trying to understand the how and what exactly it's going to look like instead of just trusting that god said it it will happen and because he's called me to receive it i will be a beneficiary of it because they're all trying to figure it out the pharisees no doubt had their conventions the you see no doubt had the big they're big torah gatherings let us dissect brothers the the writings of the prophet isaiah and let us go through line by line by line and try to figure it out but what were they doing they were for and there's not even necessarily anything wrong with those things to to read the word of god to even talk to each other about it and discuss we should fellowship around the world i don't think there's any problem with asking questions and and maybe even pondering upon lord because we understand remember when jesus came on the scene there were two instances where god came and said this is how it's going to be when my when i am when my son is born one was to marry and the other one i can't remember the name now what was to the to the man uh elizabeth's husband i believe and i my mind fails me for the name but what happened god comes and says this is going to happen and and the man who ought to have known better he served god in the temple and all these things had an attitude about it and he wondered how is this going to be there's no way and lord said because you don't believe it you're going to be dumb for a season why that was whatever angel says now you're going to conceive and have a son and you'll name his name jesus and they and what did she she asked the same question she said how is that gonna happen but see she had a different attitude why because she expressed he said be it so unto me lord according to thy word why she may not have understood it and no doubt she would have loved to understand and maybe really be able to break it down but what was the difference she chose to believe it she there was something in here that said lord i don't know what it looks like it doesn't matter i i just but i believe your word and that's all i can stand on so is it with the believers of this day brothers and sisters i don't know how the rapture is going to change us in the moment of a twinkling of an eye but i do know that i've been called to receive it amen i do know that i've received an earnest of that inheritance that burns within me that can't help but say amen to the word of god amen and lord help me but i don't want to get to a place where where i'm stuck trying to think about it and understand figure it out carnally because you won't do it you can't do it you will run yourself in circles you run yourself onto all kinds of doctrines you'll you'll be looking over here and god will be working over there why because they're people they're in expectation but what are you expecting have you formed in your mind without even knowing it is there and you formed in your mind like lord it's got to be this way i just don't i don't see how it could be any other way and many times without even knowing it we get caught into that because what just something as simple as healing how many times have you gone to the lord and said lord i believe you've healed me i i believe it because your word says by his stripes we were healed it's finished it's a finished work and then the lord may come along with the medicine but because you were expecting a miracle you didn't take the medicine why because you formed in your mind a carnal expectation and you boxed in deciding for god how he was going to perform his word god will perform his word the way he chooses to perform his word it's not subject to our whims and our wishes the lord doesn't come the way you watch him and always in the time you want him what does the song say he may not come when you want him but he'll be there right on time why because he's never out of cater he's never off time it's just that we don't get into his time we wonder lord why is this happening to me lord why is this situation the way it is lord why aren't why haven't i been healed of this yet or why isn't this deliverance specific there's nothing wrong with the word of god your deliverance is paid for your healing is paid for your salvation is paid for the baptism of the holy ghost is yours to receive he the prophet said god wants to heal you more than you want to be healed he wants to feel you more than you want to be filled so if you're not filled if you're not healed if you're not delivered who's whose fault is it it's not god's because when he was on the cross he said it is finished and he doesn't lie the words the scripture says the works were finished before the foundation of the world so it's about time we realize that the problem always lies here we've got to get out of our mind and get into his we have to there's no other way to do it that's why the pharisees missed it because they had a carnal conception of how the messiah was to come isn't that what the prophet said he said they said surely he'd have to come from our schools he'd have to come through our organization he'd have to come through our line of thinking and he came to a stable near a pile of manure no place to lay his head a bad name to the natural because they thought he was illegitimate that's the god of heaven revealed in flesh so as it was then so will it be now because god does not change his ways the rest of the world may look at you as illegitimate they may look at you like you're a dung pile they may look at you like you have nothing but if you got the seed of god in you if you've been baptized with the spirit of god and you've been received into that family remember that glass that you can't see through the only way to see what's on the other side is to come inside brothers and sisters is to be born into that spirit forward into that body have that life because the carnal mind cannot receive it it will not receive it we've got to get out of our ideas god doesn't want your ideas well what did brother branham say about he always talked about about god being god he said he said god has to do it right the first time or he wasn't god if he could change his mind because he said he had a better idea that means his first idea wasn't good enough that means he's not god so why do we always try to change god's mind about what he wants because of our carnal desires because we're like so many times when we are to be maturing when we are to be mature christians able to uh able to take no for an answer what's that uh sister kristen i'm sure can attest what's one of the first things when that child does not like to learn how to take response to no because when they're a baby they don't you the parent knows they don't know any better they have no other choice but to cry for what they desire and then what does mama do mama gives them what they need all the time that's why they call it babying you ever heard of i'm being babied that means you're getting whatever you want that means you throw a fit and you get a pacifier you get a bottle of milk you get a pat on the bum you know you get whatever you need you get pampered you get rocked to sleep and as as babes in christ that's how god does it so many times how many remember and this is just fresh to me and if it doesn't make sense i pray brother jesse forgive me and you don't have to have me back brother but i how many remember i i feel like because i feel like i always and maybe this is just the way the lord showed it to me right now but it seems like when you first come to christ there's so many miraculous things that'll happen it seems like in that first period it's fresh your faith is high what is it god's taking that newborn babe and he's babying you he's given you all the things that you need to grow strong he's giving you that sincere milk of the word he when you're crying he's right there to answer right away why because you're a babe because he knows he needs but what did brother braham say there's comes a point where we can't be hot house plants anymore it's time to mature when you pray and god says no like he did to paul you say you don't throw a fit and say lord you said i was healed paul knew that by his strengths he was healed did he try to throw the word back in god's face when god said my grace is sufficient for me for my strength is made perfect in weakness no he said rather i will rejoice in my infirmities that the power of god may rest upon me oh that's a mature christian brothers and sisters when your father can look at you after you begged him for something he says no and you say even so lord be it unto me according to thy word did not jesus do the same thing in the garden of gethsemane lord i would that this cup passed from me you know why we didn't have to hear his answer because jesus already knew the answer was no because he was the word so he didn't have to wait for god to come back and say no because he knew the answer was no so he says nevertheless nevertheless not my will but thine be done oh that's a mature christian that is what we're coming to brothers and sisters i don't care you may not think it right now that's coming paul said endure hardness that's hard living hard situations hard circumstances endure hardness as a good soldier those soldiers when they're out there fighting the battles eight eight it ain't beds of feather beds and comfy pillows and good meals no sir they're laying on the rocks just like just like i think it was uh jacob he had a stone for a pillow blankets maybe a sheepskin or something whenever you can find them but they're soldiers they're pressing on they're fighting battles we can't live in a carnal expectation why because that's a layout to see in spirit it's a layout to see in spirit our right to everything don't you see the spirit of laodicea now i don't know about you but i can see it creeping through the churches too message churches people get that spirit on them what did brother branham say that laocia stood for people's rights and what are we living in now well i have a right to this i have a right to that i have a right to this this is mine that's mine i don't own anything i don't have nothing why because i gave up my rights i gave everything that i was to him i want to give all that i am to him i don't want my own thoughts i don't want my own desires i lived for myself for 18 years before and i tried to serve the lord a little bit in denomination and the lord helped me at least to know a little bit about god i praise the lord that i grew up with that knowledge you know he saved me from a lot of things but it was 18 years plus living for myself i can tell you one thing it's true not one of my decisions benefited me in any eternal way all of my thinking that i had i could do this and i can do that and i want this and i want that did nothing but bring sorrow pain frustration and it'll do the same to you even now if we try to we think see we take things carnally because our prophet told us when you get saved god gives you a checkbook signed with jesus christ's name on it whatever you have need of but see people forget that brother branham also came back and said when you need something from god you got to have the right motive you got to have the right objective it's got to be the right place it's got to be the right time it's got to be the right move but we ignore that part of it and we say give it to me now i want this i want that spoiled children sounds more like grandchildren right because that's what they do what isn't that what when you're a child when i was a child that's what you go to your grandparents for your grandparents weren't there for discipline your grandparents weren't there for anything else but to give you candy and give your toys and your birthdays and stuff why because that's the grandparent mentality but god doesn't have grandchildren he's only got sons and daughters and unfortunately if you want to look at it like this the parents part of the responsibility is to chastise is to keep those children in line is to make sure they're on the right path it's to school them is to teach them now some of you children may not be like me and maybe you love school i didn't like school it wasn't pleasurable to me some people enjoy it praise the lord that's a gift that's a gift to enjoy it you know i believe that but just like the scripture says the the chastisement all these things are not pleasurable in the season but it bringeth forth fruits you train up a child and the way it should go and when they are old they won't depart from it it doesn't mean you're not going to have trials and tribulations it doesn't mean you're not going to have sorrows and troubles and and things you're going to go through but it does mean that if you follow that word god will be there at the end to greet you we've got to get out of our own carnal ideas of things we've got to come up higher into his mind how many times you know the pharisees were in that mode right we were just talking about that they had this idea of how god would come when he came on the scene and then they totally missed him by a million miles but there was a little woman at the well you see she wasn't educated she wasn't educated enough to have all of her own theories to have all of her own ideas to have all of her own assumptions of how the messiah would come so unlike the pharisee who was up there just completely sure of the way he thought because he was so educated he was so sure of himself well surely god would have to come this way because of this and this and he could just name it and name it a neighbor to name it but see that little woman at the well see she knew enough to know that she didn't know i i was like i was i always made a little saying to myself i said a smart person knows enough to know that they don't know enough yes and as christians i believe we ought to be we ought to be so humble we need to humble our we've been given such great revelation we've been given such great things in this hour but we've got to be careful even paul he said he said les by the abundance of revelations i'd be puffed up and then what happens that is where a denominational mindset starts to come in you start to think well except god come this way because this is the way i understand it then it can't be any other way than this that's where the pharisees and sadducees went off that's where the denominations went off and that's where a lot of people now are starting to drift off because they say well surely it's got to be this way surely this and this has got to happen because of this thing and this thing and they start trying to put it together brother i know enough to know that i don't know i don't know how it will happen but i want to be like that woman at the well the only thing she knew what did she tell what did she tell the lord jesus he said we know what was the thing that she knew she said when messiah cometh he'll be able to do these things that's all i know that's all i know is that when messiah cometh he'll do these things and you know what that was a heart that jesus could speak to not that pharisee he could perform the same miracles why because the scripture said he talked to those pharisees and he said he'd perceive their minds he could perceive the thoughts of their heart and he would speak right to the heart of the issue and it'd go right over them but to that little woman at the well who had a seat in there who had no expectation she didn't have a plan worked out in her mind of how the messiah was going to come she could only say what the word said she said i don't know i just know sir i perceive you're a prophet i i kind of know that because you're telling me things that you should know that you know he said well i do know that when the messiah comes he'll do these things too i don't know anything else i don't have the knowledge that these great men have i don't have the name that these great men have i have a bad name i look bad to the world but but there's something in here that was greater than all the educational pharisees then all their theories and theological ideas and discussions it was a simple she had an expectation too but she was just expecting god to move she didn't try to cage it up into her own carnal ideas she didn't try to cage it up and try to try to move put god almost like in a many times it's almost like mentally in our the way we are expecting we try to put god almost like in a rat maze all we care we we we we know the cheese is over here and so we're going to force god to get to the cheese in the way that we think he ought to go not so god god is sovereign the only thing he doesn't do is he doesn't work outside his word and if we'd stop trying to box them into our our solutions our ideas our mentalities because that just gets you into trouble it won't do anything it got even into trouble it got even in trouble brother branham said i believe it was in satan's eden he said he said what did eve do eve lusted for knowledge she wanted to know things i fear that in in our in many times because of the age we live in the scientific age that we're in many times we get we can get sucked into that lord i just want to know this and i want to know that and i want to and don't get me wrong god wants to give us understanding he wants us to to have knowledge of him and knowledge of his word but why are we seeking these things are we doing it just so we could know more than this other brother are we doing it just so we could prove a point to someone else to oh i got him there they thought it was this way but oh i got it because i showed him it was that way that's not the spirit of god that's the kind of thing that breaks up fellowship because people want to go you'd see the way brother branham would humble himself down when people would talk bad about him people would talk behind his back he knew what they were talking about him but what did he do he humbled himself jesus the very god of heaven let this mind be in you that was also in christ jesus he said who who being in the who being in the likeness he didn't think it even robber to be equal with god but what did he do he humbled himself he came in the form of a servant that's why they couldn't see it because god defied all their carnal expectations he's going to do it again he's doing it right now he's doing it right now and i'm not saying this just to puff up brother jesse or even the church in general here but he's doing it in this congregation now why because the rest of the world would look at a little congregation like this they'd say it's not much but to god it's the apple of his eye to god it's more precious than gold to god it is eternal life right here right now why because it's not about numbers it's not about how much people can shout at how much noise you can make by your song services god wants quality not quantity and what will anybody tell you about any process that distills something down to its purest form as it gets smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller as it goes so don't be discouraged when you say oh why aren't we growing why aren't there so many more people in here why do people seem to go away and not come in because the hour's late hour's late there's not much left there's nothing that brother branham back then called him cannon fodder how much more now but we're seeking out those seeds we get one here we get one there the lord encourages his people who has despised the day of small things who has despised that and again i don't even say this to to uplift just a church this is just for you in general too to you specifically you think you're small and insignificant you think that you don't mean anything because of this reason or that oh i'm not i'm not this i'm not a preacher i'm not a great teacher i can't sing or i can't speak really well or i'm not really the most personable person who could just go out there and talk to people that means nothing the the value that you hold is deeper than that brothers and sisters the value you hold is a seed that was planted in you before the foundation of the world that cries out i have a father to that word of god more valuable than ten thousand worlds and satan would try to try to make us the scripture said that they they would we would compare ourselves by ourselves but it's foolishness why because you can compare yourself brother amen would say maybe he's a song leader so he may go to another church and the devil would try to put something on him well you're not like that song leader yeah but that song leader wouldn't be able to exist here because that's not their position but a brother amen's position is to be here why and nobody else can fill that spot just like that temple they were hewn stones lively stones that are being carved and chiseled out and placed into their position and there's no other stone that could take that place so if you think the devil tries to make you feel insignificant make you feel not valuable there is nobody that can take your place there is nobody who possesses the value to the body of bride of christ fellowship or even to the bride as a whole there's nobody that possesses that besides you why because god paid the same price for you that he prayed for william branham he paid the same price for you that he prayed for brother jesse that he paid for martin luther and all these things that we would call great men and you know what they were they were tools in the hand of god to fit their position just like you are oh god i wish i could be this and i wish i could be that and i wish i could see this check your motives check your objectives and then check your mind and put it in line with the word of god because god doesn't want to work by your carnal expectations what are you expecting see are we and the thing that really if i could say i don't want to hold i don't even know what time it is i don't want to hold us too long but the thing that really if i could say this that got me really thinking along this line is i started thinking about this rapture and this rapture whether you realize it or not is happening right now your faith when you receive this word right now as it's being spoken has nothing to do with me why because i can't do anything for you i would love to do it for you but i can't it just happens to be that it's my lot to be by his grace if he would allow it a vessel that he could speak through if i could if i could find the grace in his sight to get myself out of the way because you don't want to hear me speak it would do you no good to hear me speak because i do not have the words of life he alone has the words of life if we can look beyond this veil look beyond brother randy whoever's up your brother jesse whoever it might be and realize that it's god if it be this word now yeah now it doesn't cope with the word then you better check it but if it be this word then it's god to you it's god speaking to you right and what is that that is nothing but the master's hammer right now you don't feel it because feelings don't matter you may not see it because sight doesn't matter i had this thought that really struck me i was watching a video uh my wife is really into plants right now she's just she wants to be the greenest thumb and our house is slowly turning into a jungle and i i saw but the thing that kind of got me is i saw this video and you know how they do the time lapses of a of a seed and then they'll grow up you realize that when you see that and it looks so fast it's like oh ah that's amazing that took six eight ten twelve months to happen if you sat there and stared at that you'd go dead with boredom to see it grow and that's the problem that satan gets us with is right now you are growing why because what did we do we came in we opened our hearts to the word when we even sing the song we open our hearts to him to the word and now the word of god the washing of the water of the word what is it it's just like the the you i had this now maybe you may have all had this this revelation before i did but i had a to me i was a mighty revelation i thought oh my goodness this is so good because we're typed as trees and plants in the garden of god right well there's a reason why that the man the one who tends the plants is called a husband men and he is our husband even according to the spiritual it never struck me before quite like that but i just i rejoiced in that i said my even the lord even uses language to glorify himself i love it like even in the language it's a revelation how he's a husband the husbandman broods over the the flowers in the garden and and grooms them and waters them and feeds so does our husband right now if you can accept it he's he's feeding you spiritual vitamins into your soil he's sprinkling you with with the water the washing of the water of the word to soak that soil so he could break up the fallow ground so you can grow yeah you may not see it right away just like the plant that plant may grow a tenth of a millimeter a day but who has despised the day of small things i'm really that scripture's just been speaking to me because it's it's the little things god will take care of the big things but it's the little foxes that spoil the vine it's the little omissions and commissions that we make every day it's the little things when god speaks to your heart say hey you know instead of going to this place today maybe you just take it take ten minutes and just get in prayer for five ten minutes and your carnal mind is well what's five minutes gonna do it's not even about the time it's about the obedience god is looking for for sons and daughters who at the very least of his will is their greatest desire to fulfill that's the character he's looking for because jesus came and what did he say he said i do nothing except the father shows me first that's the character he's looking for we look at it and say oh lord that couldn't have been you because it was so little it's because it was so little that it was him because what did brother branham say he said god's so great because he became so long but see what our current expectations we've almost turned in carnal minds we've almost come pharisees in some ways see brother i brother jesse i had this thought this is what just really kind of spurred on this whole this whole thought process here you think about this rapture and brother jesse you know you know we've all had fellowship around it and things we've talked about oh you know because brother branham said it and i believe it he said you know missing limbs would be restored creative power would happen and all these things and and you know what happens your carnal mind starts to get rolling and you've already created in your mind a a movie or if you could say a little a little mental film of what that what we call it a squeeze or what that time right before the rapture is going to be like we're going to be walking speaking things into existence and things are going to be poof in here and clouds of smoke over there god never said that you know what actually he said he said he said the tent vision he said this will be the third poll he said and no one will know anything about it brother branham said it would be so humble that it'll come and go and you didn't even know what happened just like john the baptist why said the scripture that elisha elijah would come he said he already came and he didn't even know him so humble so small so little the rapture brothers and sisters it's happening right now and i'm i'm i fear in some ways that so many of us maybe not even here but i feel all over and i say this just in general we're missing it because we fall into the trap brother branham warned us about he said you always remember what god did we rejoice in the things that god did through brother branham we're looking forward to what he will do all that latter rain oh those great and powerful manifestations that are going to happen and we're ignoring what he's doing right now god is revealing his word little by little every day he's he's perfecting you little by little every day if you really thought about it maybe sit before the lord and start to think and meditate and say lord reveal to me how you've changed me because those changes many times happen so little you know if we didn't have if we didn't have photographs when you were children you wouldn't even remember what you looked like when you were a child you wouldn't even remember it why because you don't have a reference and that's how that's one of the greatest tricks the devil does to us is because many our memories i preached on that last time i was here about those five inlets the memory and conscious affection reason and we talked about those and clearing those channels out right and what does it do satan will use those memories and all of a sudden the only things we see it's almost like a photograph right what are they having a photograph a negative we look back and all we see is the negative we don't see that developed picture we don't see what god was doing and how far we've come think about the things that you used to allow in your life that now all of a sudden you said lord i can't do that anymore maybe maybe you felt pretty confident in it at one time and for that season it was okay but now the lord said now it's time to come up a little higher there's a there's a little more holiness i've got for you there's a there's a little bit deeper of a walk that i want to have but i can't have it while you're down there you need to come up a little higher you have to remove this out of your life that you once allowed and you thought it was okay and may have been lawful but the lord says but it's not expedient it's not something you can keep doing and you say oh why why why do i feel that way that's god working on you and you don't even know it because god or the god is working so slowly he's taken that fine sandpaper and just rubbing off these little sharp edges that you used to have you know when you first become a christian god takes the hammer to you and he's knocking off you know sitting off sin after sin he's knocking off smoking he's knocking off drinking he's knocking off all these things that you used to enjoy and they're really big and it's easy to see but then the master starts to go in and fine-tune the details and you know what about it is it takes a long time it takes a lot of work it takes it takes a lot of rubbing on one another there's a lot of rubbing going on he's pulling out the sandpaper and what if you ever seen him do that there's a lot of water involved a lot of that word's got to come in there to provide that grit for that sandpaper to get in there to smooth it out but he's doing it little by little by little but the thing i i got off track again but i wanted to focus on this and when it will close the thing that really struck me on this was we start to think about this rapture and it's this great event and this great event in this great event but i've just it's been in my mind so much that god works in simplicity and it's always the opposite of what the carnal mind is expecting the scripture says and we don't we don't have to turn there but you can you can write it down and read it later isaiah chapter 40 talks about john the baptist and it says they said it the valleys would be exalted the mountains would be made low the the the rough places would become smooth and he'd the crooked places be made straight and that was john the baptist a man who didn't have nothing but a fuel handful of converts and then here we are and then jesus had to come and tell them about it why does the scripture say this and why do they say elijah has to come he already came and he didn't even know it see we're thinking then the carnal mind no doubt those pharisees and said she's read those scriptures all the time they said oh my this is going to be a great thing and it was a great thing it just wasn't a great thing in the way they thought it would be they said oh sure you know no doubt they had their theories just like we theorize you know we have our theories we see things happening in the world and we try to match it to the word and and i don't doubt that it's with good and i do it i no doubt brother amen you do it too i see i was just talking to brother simon last night and i and i'm just gonna say this is as an ex uh just in uh an admission of it even we all do it but we have to understand that god isn't obligated to work by our thoughts about it right we're obligated to submit to his thoughts about it but i we were even talking about these things with i don't know if you saw the thing about the cows with the sevens on them and all the things that were happening and different things and we were talking about this last night i'm like my goodness these things could be happening here and happening there and then the thing i was just kind of thinking they just had the olympics and then there was over in tokyo in japan and what is that remember the gospel moves east to west and this is i'm just i'm using this as an example to admit that this is how as humans we think but if we're not careful we'll cling to it so much that we can't see what god's doing so i want you to take what i'm saying now with what it's worth you know like they say my advice is worth what you're paying for which is nothing so you take it for what it is but this is just my example i'm using as an example so i and i started thinking i was like wow the gospel moves east to west and it started in the these olympics were in tokyo and then in 2024 they're going to be in paris france and then 2028 they're going to be in los angeles california you know what brother branham said about paris he said that used to be the headquarters of the devil he said then he moved to hollywood in los angeles he said he even found the quote he said he moved he moved his headquarters from paris to los angeles i thought my i said the just like that oh it's almost like the only who knows maybe 2028's got something you know but but i think you think those ways right and there i don't think there's necessarily a problem with that because it shows that your mind is on on him and we want our desire is to understand but if we're not careful you get into that pharisee mindset where it's got to be this way because i just understand so much i know so much and it's got to be this way but i started thinking if it was that way at the coming of christ where the scripture said these flowery words because god was using it this way the the high places would be made low and the low places would be exalted and the crooked made straight and the rough place is made plain a voice of one crying in the wilderness and then god comes through a simple man like john the baptist and then in our minds we've got all these ideas of what this rapture is going to be and and how we're going to just you know we talk about we're going to we we're leaping over a wall and we're running through a troop and these things are going to happen and i thought my lord have we become so carnal that we've fallen into that trap to not realize that he's doing it right now that it's a spiritual happening right now brother branham said i believe in the seals those two hundred thousand thousand demons released out of euphrates trained right brother's bride to like i think he called them anti-diluvian demons ancient devils and those are just fighting the people of god you don't even realize right now every day that you live for christ you're running through a troop brothers and sisters you don't see it you're leaping over walls that the devil's trying to set up for you every day you're fighting devil's left and right and you don't even know it why the grace of god is upon you amen that holy ghost is leading you he puts a he puts a shield between you and him you got the armor of god and you're pressing the battles and we don't even realize what's happening just like the disciples didn't realize what was happening but it was happening all around them nonetheless i say lord remove all of our carnal thinking all of our carnal expectations of how we think you're supposed to move and lord let us get into that channel where lord i don't know how you're going to do it but i'm looking for it and lord give me the grace that when it comes i can just jump right in with it and jump right in that channel and go right with it because i i that's it because it was that simple for a rapture for enoch he walked with god and he was not for god took him and we've complicated things we've made it we've made it so complicated you must understand this and you must know this and you've got to do this and this and this is going to happen and yes there are going to happen i don't know how though so lord let me be in your mind let me be one with you let me get rid of all my thoughts all of my ideas all of my desires your desires don't have any place in this you've got to get rid of your desires you've got to replace them with his desires you got to get rid of your wants and replace them with his wants you've got to get rid of your expectation and put his expectation there there cannot be one speck of you left if i'm gonna make a rapture and i will because he promised me there can't be one speck of randall verton left amen because randall verton won't go in the rapture but jesus christ is and he resides in randolph hurt and we're becoming one but he can't accept anything that's not him and we're trying we try to force god into to match our mold and that's nothing but a denominational spirit that's the evil of denomination is that where they would take god's word and try to mold it and twist it and contort it and pervert it to fit what their ideas are and it was it was funny because i happen to be just talking to my grandfather about that he talked about how he would listen to this guy that does bible studies and he and he believed in the whole doctrine once saved always saved the baptist mentality just it once you're done you're all done it's all good and in a way that is true but they pervert it because if you truly were saved then you always were that's true but then if you truly were then you can't not fall away i mean you can't fall away at that point but it'll manifest itself by the life that you live and the spirit that you have it's isn't it amazing how the devil would just take it and he'll take a truth and then pervert it to mean something totally different it's amazing how we'll do that but we're discussing this and and he said he said my and my grandpa doesn't believe in that he says once they don't light say i don't believe in that that's not he said but this this teacher i don't even know who it was but this teacher would never touch it because he said he just said well i can't reconcile it with the way i believe and even my grandfather who who who sits there and and my grandfather sat there and said well if you can't reconcile it with your beliefs then maybe your beliefs are wrong such a simple idea but that's what denomination does is they say well if i can't reconcile with the way i want to believe it then it must be something different no sir it's not god's word that's got to change it's us that has to change be not conformed to the image of this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind we've got we've done so much you know we because we've come so far in god he's revealed to us so much he's shown us so much and we've got to be careful we don't get puffed up in ourselves and we do it and we don't realize it because we start to think that god's got to work on our schedule that god's got to work in the way we anticipate he will do it no sir far be it from god to do that we've got to conform to his will we've got to conform to his desires oh my when when brother branham i think had prayed for that one and she died and god said you owe me an explanation he said god didn't talk to him for a long time i think it might have been a couple months he said god don't owe you nothing he owes you nothing he's already given you everything so how could he owe you anything he said yeah we we owe it to god to give ourselves a living sacrifice he said that is your reasonable service and what is the sacrifice the sacrifice is obedience why samuel said he said obedience is greater than sacrifice why obedience is a sacrifice it's when you sacrifice your will upon the altar you don't realize it people we make it out to be so difficult but god says it you do it god says it i will do it i don't understand it i don't always understand it but i and if i don't understand it i'm still going to believe it and i'm not going to try to figure it out until he shows it to me and he will reveal it at the time just like that he said unless you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you if i was there i would have been what i wouldn't have understood it right the disciples didn't understand it and so and and the lord knows how to do it because he said if this is going to stumble you then watch this what would you say if you see the son of man coming to where he came from and they said okay now we can't take it and they left and that's exactly what they do today when it doesn't cope with what they think they start to run away from it why because they become their own god they don't realize it but they that's that's the garden of eden that's exactly what it was because eve wanted that knowledge right what what did satan promise eve he said he said god doth know that in the day you eat thereof you shall be as gods knowing good and evil did you know if she could have stepped back for a second she would realize what we know now they already were his gods right they were the gods of the earth that's right not only that they already knew good from evil to do god's word was good and to not do it was evil see but she got away what did she get away with simplicity that's what we do right we we weasel our way around it mentally we do mental gymnastics tie ourselves and not to excuse ourselves doesn't the scripture say that they said they'll explain excuses themselves they come up with ideas i remember listening to a thing about about even the catholic church and the jesuits how they they train themselves to do that they train themselves in self-deception because their mentality and their teachings for the jesuits is that if you can believe it you can say whatever you want as long as you can get yourself to believe it that's exactly what they do and so many times we fall into that trap and don't even know it because you say oh it couldn't have been this way because of this and this and this and all of a sudden we're doing this big roundabout maze to get to the end of the truth was that you were wrong or i was wrong you know i i've done it i've tried to make excuses for my mistakes when god just wants you to say i was wrong i was wrong to go against your word lord and you know what he'll accept that a humble and contrite heart he won't despise that god resisted the problem but he gives grace to the humble and when we're not willing see because we've been told so much that we're the bride we're the bride we're spotless and sinless and we are because he made us so yes but we've got oh have we gotten away from confessing our faults one to another have we gotten away from realizing that we have struggles but we won't admit it we'll deceive ourselves and we call it faith but it's just whistling through the graveyard because we know god's word's true i don't i believe all of us here know god's word is true and we know that that's the amen that's the end-all be-all but then when we don't toe up to it and we see that we don't tow up to it we try to make excuses for it oh well if it wouldn't have been this way i might have done this or lord i was i guess i was just made that way yeah that's why you need the transforming power of the holy ghost to change you that's why you need to surrender that thing to him and admit to god that you've got a problem here or a problem there the devil doesn't like it when you speak that thing and say lord i have this problem i have struggled with this or lord i have seen this in my life and i don't like it and i don't want to be that way anymore and i'm being honest with you lord i don't i don't want to be this way anymore but forgive me and help me but i will say well i'm the bride i've been i've been cleansed and all that stuff yes we have but he also wants you to break up that fallow ground but eve didn't know she was already as a god she was or she already knew good from evil god's word is good and to not do it was evil and i brother i believe we're coming back to that hour now of that simplicity we're trying to dissect it we try to make laws for everything so that way we can needle it down to to make a man version of do this and don't do that and we've turned it into law again and god just wants to say my word is truth work that's that's all you have to do is the word but we've we've turned it into we've tried to make a formula out of it and i don't even know why i went this direction it just kind of i hope this is okay i don't again i don't i hope nobody takes this condemnation i want to me i'm telling myself all the time i said lord if i've had certain expectations about the way i think my life should be get those out of my mind you know i i if if i've had expectations of you know when i was younger i had i had expectations i thought i was going to be a fighter pilot and do this and do that and god had to come across and slam the whole thing down to the ground to show me that there was something greater he had in store at the time i didn't see it and many times even now i still don't see it you know because you look at yourself you're your own worst critic you know if you're really truly looking at the mirror of god's word then you'll see how short you fall of the of the thing if you find yourself thinking oh i'm doing pretty good then you might want to check what measuring stick you're using because if you find i'm doing all right then you're probably measuring yourself off of somebody else and you're not measuring yourself off of jesus christ who's the measuring stick i think i always i think about that the dream that that the the man had that he went up and he was going to that bright light he's going to he was going to the white throne judgment he's going to heaven or and all these things and all of a sudden he said he felt really good about it and as he got close to that light all the things that he thought were okay started to get darker and darker and he got close to that light he started thinking about the shady deals he had pulled that they were okay in the moment that he thought was okay but what is it when you realize the holiness of god that the angels are filthy in his sight oh my and we think we're just gonna get by with our own carnal conception to what god's going to do no sir or carnal minds it's enmity it can't do anything with the word of your carnal mind can't do anything right that's why god wants you to accept it by faith without faith it's impossible to please him you've got to accept this and realize lord i know i can't do it but i'm accepting your sacrifice i'm accepting your propitiation that you provided i'm accepting that all my ways are no good but your ways are perfect not my will but thine be done lord if my will is getting in the way if my will has exalted itself that's of the devil that's what the devil did he said i will i will i will i was expressing to the church there in texas that you know under armour that's their big push right now their big slogan you know nike has that slogan just do it under armoured slogan that they've had i think over the last couple years one of their big ones is i will i will and for them they're trying to express this thing i will i you know i'll press through and do an extra workout and i'll do this drill and get better at my sport whatever they're doing but all it is is expressing the the nature of this hour that satanic nature of i will do this and i will do that and i will do this and then then the lord say don't even say tomorrow i'll do this or tomorrow i'll do that he said but if the lord will what are we doing where what are we doing we're paying respects to god lord i have this desire maybe you have a desire lord i i want to maybe i wanted to go my desire was to have my wife come out here and visit with with us and her desire was to come out here but the lord had other plans and i was frustrated when it happened i can admit that i was frustrated when circumstances came about that she wasn't able to come but then the lord in my heart i could i could tell it was god i said but don't you see some of these other circumstances that came up you know brother simon wasn't able to be here and it might have been a little bit more now you have a little bit more of a of a burden not to say it's a burden brother jesse not to say it that way but maybe more labor to partake of that you need to have more focus on the word and maybe not as much on fellowship this time so if you bring your wife you're going to be pulled to do more fellowship and you want to really i want to give god first place so brother jesse forgive me if maybe i'm not fellowshipping so much until after the service on sunday but i just feel in my heart that if i'm going to do the word of god the will of god i've got to set that aside i've got to put him first because it wouldn't profit anything if i just come up and and and i haven't been in the atmosphere if i'm not in the right the the frame of mind and in the right spiritual condition to be able to come up and hopefully by his grace yield myself to him but it was my desire for that but the lord had other plans and i have to say lord not my will but the earth be done lord it's my desire that that you know even it would be my desire that this would happen or this would happen but lord not my will but yours be done lord my expectations are this maybe you have expectations in your life of the way you think things are going to go but say lord even though i expect it maybe this way lord if that's wrong change my expectations to yours change what i'm looking for to be let me not see with my own eyes but let me see what your eyes let me not see with my own desires but let me use your desires to be manifested so that way i can see what you see so that way when this word when this word comes when it's when this event comes and that changing of the body that rapture's happening the changing of the body is just a culmination of it but their rapture is happening right now and i say lord if i'm looking for the wrong things if i've had this expectation of my mind of the way it ought to be lord change my expectation lord if i've been looking at it a certain way change my perspective that's what he did with the what do you think with brother brandon with that cloud he said you said you have to change your perspective to see what that cloud was showing you had to change your perspective it's not it's not the it's not the photo that changed it's that you had to change it's not the word that has to change but our perspective on it has to change what our expectations are has to change uh when our when our love for him has to change and come up higher i want to see i want to see exactly what god wants me to see i want to see what he wants me to see i want to get my that's the crux of all of it and just i guess as we're opening up these services that we're kind of doing this weekend and having just a couple services i'm no great preacher i i i'm the least of all of them i promise you that i promise you that when it comes to that because i know i can't do anything i'm just uh i'm just a dumb person who who's you know by his grace i'm trying to do my best and i pray that all of my shortcomings i know i believe that the grace of god will be there to fill the gaps for all my shortcomings and he'll bridge those gaps and be able to speak to you what he needs to speak to you because i know i can't do it you know i i know i have no ability but i'm trusting him and so as we're that's i just wanted to i felt led to maybe start off on this foot with these little meetings that we're having i don't know don't come in here with your own expectation of i have this need and god's gonna answer it this way just say lord i have needs however you would speak to me i believe that you will how you do it i don't know how you'll manifest it i don't know but i have expectation that you will that's what god wants he doesn't know what he don't want you to expect it in a certain way he just wants you to expect it say lord i if you have need of healing say lord i know my healing's finished and i'm going to wait here at expectation how you choose to manifest it lord i don't care as long as you do because you promised you would lord if i if you need a deliverance you say lord i i'm expecting deliverance i don't know how it will come i don't know when it might come but i'm gonna wait here and expectation with a heart that's open to receive it and lord if i'm thinking in the wrong way put me in the channel so that when you do pass by i can see it and i can recognize it i can recognize my moment i can recognize the presence of god i can recognize that he's passing by you got to have the right approach you have to come the right way yes remember what he said blind bartimaeus thou son of david have mercy on me thou son of david have mercy on me and god could respect that but then with the other woman and said said oh son of david said that she wasn't son sending david to her why she maybe had her own approach that oh maybe maybe she even heard blind bartimaeus at one point i don't know i can't remember where it is chronologically maybe she heard that or heard a testimony and so she thought well maybe those are the magic words you know how we think that's the carnal mind i'm not too proud to admit that i've thought that before lord if i could just say it a certain way or you know maybe as a preacher maybe you think if i could just preach it this way it would be more effective no but it's got to be the way he decides he made me the way he made me he made brother jesse to preach the way he does he made brother amen to sing songs and you to you know no one can sit in a pew or a chair like you can because god made you that way nobody can pull on the word of god the way you can for your position because he made you unique yes and so she called out son of david said but she wasn't that to her but when she called out lord see there was a faith there she had the faith because god responded to it but her approach was wrong but when she could change her approach the faith manifested itself so maybe if we're seeing that we're not seeing manifestation the way we think we ought to and i believe we could all say that to an extent i don't see god manifested in my life the way i want to the way i know this word says it ought to be i fall short so lord made me change my approach change the way i'm looking at it change my perspective because i know the word's perfect yes i know this message we've received is perfect because we've received a word in our hour that's for us this book this bible has made a new book we're able to see things that the world knows nothing about but we still have to approach it the right way see isn't that funny that that woman knew that that was god and that she could be touched by it she had the faith for it yes but what was her only problem her approach was wrong so we know that this word is true we know we've received a message for our day we know we've received those things we've talked about it i say ad nauseum or without end and we can talk about it more and it's wonderful and we rejoice in it the fact that god chose you to hear it to accept it and believe it but now we say lord now we got to see it work we got to see it work we got to have the right approach lord if i'm approaching it from the wrong angle if i'm approaching it the wrong way lord i believe that you've instilled to put a faith in me to receive it i've seen it in my life i believe you've seen it in your life i i've been through the trials and tribulations and i've had my struggles and for whatever reason god holds on to me praise the lord praise the lord jesus for holding on to you for holding on to me but now it's time for us to come up higher it's time for us to adjust our expectations focus the looking glass and see with his eyes bring those two into perfect harmony to where we can see it clearly to where we can see the right approach and if i if we go with that right approach he responds because as soon as she cried out lord lord he responded lord help us to look the right way help us to respond with that that right attitude the right approach and and as we're just beginning these little meetings maybe we could go in with that that challenge you know maybe you had an expectation of oh brother preaches this way or we're maybe expecting it this certain way don't look at it like that but just say lord the only things that i know remember what the woman at the well oh i know i don't know anything else except when the messiah comes he'll do these things she didn't know much but what did she do she didn't cage god by what she thought she knew she just knew that it was truth and she didn't expect it to manifest in any particular way she said lord just i believe there was a cry in her heart said lord i believe your messiah is coming and if you would just show them to me i'll follow i don't know how he's going to come see how much greater is that than that pharisee who'd say lord we know your messiah comes true but he will come this way wrong see how that see how the attitude's different so let's have let's have that attitude of the woman at the well say lord i know i know that maybe brother randy preaches this way or maybe you don't even think i'm a good preacher and that's fine because i'm not that's fine i'm nobody i don't care about that because i'm not looking for a reputation maybe you've had all these ideas in your head of what the services would be or what's going to happen over the next couple days as a as a minister you even get trapped in those lord you've given me these a certain thought and this and this is just the way it's going to go brother how often does it actually happen the way you think it's going to go i would venture to say basically 0.00 it almost never seems to go the way you thought it was going to go why because our carnal expectations are are so far outside he said my thoughts are above your thoughts and my ways are above your ways the scripture says in ephesians he says to him who can do exceedingly and abundantly above what you can ask or think so think about that think about all the things that you can think and all the things that you can ask he's going to do above that it doesn't mean he's going to do above in the sense he's just going to do more he's going to give you other things that you thought and he's going to do more he's going to do it above that though he wants you to come up higher he wants you to come beyond we can't if i can say it this way without sounding like we're be you know because sometimes i feel like we almost come off elitist in a way you know what i mean oh we're the bride and this and that no by his grace he's allowed us to see oh my goodness he's given us something i didn't just i was not even looking for this message and he dropped it by my way oh praise be to god i still don't deserve it i fail him so much but he's faithful amen he made me a promise that's all i can hold i say lord i don't know how you're going to make it happen but i do know you promised me so let's come with that expectation that type of expectation lord i don't know how these will go i don't know how the meetings will go but i do know one thing your word promise where two or three are gathered you be in the midst lord you said you hear the cries of your people and i have a need and lord your your word says that you've already supplied that need lord i don't know how you'll do it but lord let my expectation match how you will deliver it if those two can match up that's when the miraculous are happening brothers and sisters it's when it's when you're over here thinking oh god surely got to come this way and he comes this way that's where we get in trouble but let's just be simple let's just be humble let's just go before the lord not with their own thoughts lord you owe me this and i'm the bride so we got to do it this way no without him or nothing yeah lord nothing nothing in my arms i bring only to your cross i claim amen what whom have i on earth beside thee whom in heaven but thee my thoughts won't do me any good they never did me any good before they certainly won't do any good now his thoughts are above our thoughts his ways are above our ways he can do exceedingly abundantly above all you can ask or think so let's have that mind of christ to and what is it what's the first part of the mind of christ he humbled himself humility you can't have humility without humiliation when you just let it all out let yourself be bare before him he sees it anyway amen you ain't hot you're not hiding anything from god so don't try to make it make yourself out to be something else or this or that or try to convince yourself be honest with god let's be honest with god and then say lord maybe i've had i've wanted it a certain way lord if if my motives were wrong if my objectives were wrong lord tune those to your word let my motives and objectives match your word let my expectation match your word let's all stand that's so i just that's i have it on my heart let's just approach god in this little week and i don't know what the word will do but i do know what he said in that word we just read he'll do a seatedly and abundantly above what you can ask or think so everything that you can think he can do above that so let's have expectation for that not that lord it has to come a certain way the only way i will say lord is it has to come by is it's got to come by his word because that's what he said but other than that i say lord you know just because i don't understand it doesn't mean it isn't so because there's a lot of things i don't understand but it doesn't mean it's not so so let's humble ourselves we ought to be of all people the most humble meek and lowly serving one another preferring our brothers and sisters preferring you know even the people you work with preferring them over yourself and and just love and humility and compassion and and just you know that's eternal life is living for others pouring yourself out for others preferring one another but you know before each other right before i think it was in i think it might have been in ephesians or i may be misremembering but he says looking not onto our own things but each one unto the things of others and what is that that doesn't mean oh well brother amen's got this so i'm going to look at his stuff because i really want it it's not a covetous looking but it's a it's a it's a protecting it's a it's a guarding it's a watching it's a it's a being a watchful person and hey brother you know being look at brother amen man maybe he looked a little down today so i'm going to go to prayer for him i'm going to look upon the things of others that's why brother branham would say so many times and i know i'm using that a lot about what brother branham said but see he was teaching us well a lot of times we're looking at these very specific things and trying to understand but he was trying to show us the nature of god the nature that's why he'd say don't pray for yourself but pray for one another and you'll see things happen in your own life why because that was what god did god didn't come to sadness jesus didn't come to satisfy himself but he came to save he came he came to redeem his bride back to himself he brother branham what did he say he said he could have had a wife could have had children could have had a life but he sacrificed it all he said he just despising you know he took the cross despising the shame you know he looked past those things for the glory that was waiting for him so let's have that same mind you know you say oh we don't you know many times where we don't think it but we want glory on this side we want to see these great miraculous things happen because we want vindication for ourselves as a minister many times you'd get trapped thinking well if we didn't have this certain response that i was expecting well certainly then god didn't work but then i have to be reminded again of what the prophet said the greatest anointing when he sat in the temple and he said this day this scripture is fulfilled there wasn't no screaming and shouting and jumping and hollering there but it just said precious words flowed from him and he and he talked to people and and that was one of the greatest anointing when he sat there and said this day this scripture is fulfilled see our expectations have to die lord let us have your expectations lord let us have your mind lord let us look for the things that you look for oh lord we i confess to you for my own self confess your false one to another i'll confess you right now i've been too carnal in my expectations i've looked for things in ways that i thought i expected them to come because i had it in my mind it would come that way and i say lord forgive me i let's just bow our heads and say maybe you could raise your hand too and think of places in your in your life where you say lord forgive me i've looked and i've had carnal expectations i've had thoughts in my own mind of it lord it's got to be this way because of this and because of that because i'm for approaching you in a carnal manner and thinking lord lord it's got to be this way or it's got to be that way lord lord because i'm even reminded now of abraham when he listened and hearkened to the voice of his wife she had a carnal reasoning she had a carnal expectation of how the word would be fulfilled in her and lord what did it produce but just a wild man and what have we done in our lives lord will produce wild men we produce wild doctrines we produce wild people who just go out after anything because they're not anchored in the word lord because we've we've tried to come up with a carnal explanation for why things have to be a certain way lord take all the carnality out of us help us to come up higher help us to be mature christians lord when we could go before you lord not with a a baby-like mentality of lord do this and lord do that because i want this and i want that but like a a mature adult could say lord if it would be your will could this be so and lord if you were to answer us like you answered paul and say no not this time my child but my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness lord we wouldn't rail like a little child would throw a fit and fuss and stew and and throw our hands up say oh god why did you do this and why did you have this happen lord you you promise that you're a healer but you won't do it for me right now and this and that but lord we could say like paul like a mature christian he was and say rather than i'll glorif glory in my infirmities that the power of god may rest upon me oh my lord that's a mature christian lord that's a that's a believer that doesn't have to be coddled that doesn't have to be babied and fed a bunch of cookies and and junk spiritual junk food where we just had to take all the sweet things lord but when when john ate that book it was sweet in his mouth but it made his belly bitter but it was still life to him lord if we have to take a bitter pill to swallow when you have to correct us lord and we can rejoice lord even to the bitter things but lord it would still rejoice in the sweet things when you provide lord i think of how you allowed me to fellowship with my grandfather and fellowship with brother simon lord you didn't have to do that but lord you allowed a little thing like that and i rejoice in that but lord i i just pray that even if you had said no just like you said no to bring my wife out here with me though it was my desire lord like a child i started to get frustrated but then i say lord not my will but yours be done lord because you do all things well you do all things well lord if i don't understand it you do all things well lord and maybe i don't understand well all the time lord maybe we don't accept your will right all the time but lord let us come up higher lord maybe we've been i think of how i've been looking at this rapture for so many years in a certain way but lord i can feel that just like the prophet took that picture and started to turn it lord i can feel my perspective beginning to turn lord who has despised the day of small things lord you're looking for truth in the inward parts lord you're looking for honest and see your hearts lord that could be honest with ourselves and say lord we haven't surrendered the way we ought to lord we haven't humbled ourselves the way we ought to lord we've been looking at things the way maybe we shouldn't have lord we haven't stepped back and really thought say lord how do you look at this help us to see with your eyes lord help us to hear with your ears lord help us to speak with your lips well help it to only be the word i'm reminded of even when we were here last time speaking on those different senses lord help us to to have memories of the memories you have of us help us to see each other with the eyes that you see i believe lord your prophet said you don't see that sinful nature anymore but you see a finished work lord you saw the end from the beginning that's why you could come back in the book of hebrews in chapter 11 and put we call it a hall of fame lord of all the great exploits that were done lord it is not a negative thing spoken why because you didn't see the negative because it was cast in the sea of forgetfulness but lord help us to see with your eyes here with your ears speak with your lips touch with your hands lord and lord we'll just give it all to you we want to surrender every fiber of our being we surrender our understanding to you we surrender our thoughts to you we surrender our emotions to you our wants and desires lord lord maybe things that we think that we have need of lord do we actually need it or we as i believe it was james you have not because you asked not and then you have not because you desire so you can consume it upon your lusts lord have we been lusting for things that we just want to have to make our lives easier or our lord are we looking for the things that would bring us into deeper fellowship with you lord it is not even lord that a a you know a delicious meal as we spoke of wouldn't be a bad thing in and of itself but lord is that our focus lord is our is or is our focus to serve you lord maybe it sounds fanatical lord but i want to be so sold out to you till every fiber of my being lord i could that my our hearts i believe all of our hearts would like to say as jesus said i do nothing except the father shows me oh lord in our in my carnal mind even now it seems like such a goal that would be impossible the devil would be right there to say oh you're not a prophet you don't see visions like they saw so how could you know the mind of god lord i don't understand how you're gonna do it lord but i believe that you will and lord i'm not gonna bind you up with my carnal expectations lord but i'm gonna believe your word because you said you would do it but we just commit these services as we're gathered here the next couple of days lord i want to be totally out of the way lord i want i i just want you to move lord i'm not sufficient to do it more but we place that on the altar now lord because we know that you're able we're not resting in our own strength anyhow lord but we're resting in you lord let us do as much as we can and then we've come when we've come to the end of what we can do lord let us step out by faith and trust in you lord we just place it into your hands lord you know the hearts and needs of your people though we know that you're going to do exceedingly and abundantly above what we ask or think lord why because it's what you promised and we're expectation for that lord we commit these services now we commit the rest of this evening into your hands lord may you just receive our praises lord may they be from honest sincere hearts lord from lips that have been touched by the colds from the altar lord we just give it all to you now in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen let's just keep that in our hearts i hope that's okay to say i just that was my my real sincere desire lord you know we have expectations we want expectations yes but let us not put a period at that expectation lord you'll do it this way but just say lord i know you'll do it but fulfill it however you will and for whatever i have need of lord however your desire is to fulfill that need i say you know if i can say it this way without sounding like i'm being in this i feel a moment of sincerity but i feel like this is a really good example you know i order something off of amazon we make these orders i don't care if it comes by ups i don't care if it comes by the usps or fedex the only thing that i care is that the package is delivered let us have that mindset with god lord lord as we've sent those messages to him he'll perform what he promised lord i don't care if it i don't care if it comes through this ministry of mine that he's given to me this little ministry that i have i don't care if it comes that way i don't care if it comes a year from now if we tarry that long and another minister comes by why because he said one plants one waters but god gives the increase and lord even if we don't see anything right now naturally may it be as that seed that's planted and it comes and grows and and brings forth a hundredfold not have carnal expectations for it but that farmer that that sower sows with an eager expectation of the law of god that what he plan will bring forth we're planting seeds right now god is planting seeds continually that preaching of the word is going forth he's planted in your heart i believe right now so not just continue to water it say lord i don't know what season it's going to bring its fruit i don't know when it's going to bring its fruit or even what that fruit exactly is going to look like when it manifests but lord let it be according to your word let it court according to your will can we all approach him in that way with that simplicity amen if anybody has a desire a prayer we'll be happy to pray for you but you know you can you can accept it right where you're at now but if you have a desire to do you laid out you know that's in the word that's what i love about the lord even in our our feebleness in many ways sometimes you say lord i don't think i can accept it just by faith right now he says well then call the elders of the church and have them lay their hands on you and the prayer of faith shall save the sick even he is so merciful and sometimes he'll give you multiple avenues to come by why because he's merciful to us but one thing that they all have in common is it'll come by the word so i appreciate that so if you have desire a prayer we'll pray for you why because that's the word of god but if you want to accept it right where he at you can do that too and you can go rejoicing why because he said he would fulfill it so however you decide and however the lord decides to fulfill it can we all agree on one thing let's all just accept it that we can agree on that no i don't know how and i don't know how it's going to happen but i accept it amen can we just let's just say that lord i accept it [Music] lord i accept what you have for me amen in whatever way you want to bring it amen to that i say amen to that that's the kind of thing that'll bring you a woman at the well experience she didn't know but she was willing to accept however it came and because of that she was able to save a whole city and said all they all came out and saw some some see a man who told me all the things i ever did amen so let's just we can go before the the lord and maybe sing a couple songs uh i guess brother i don't know brother jesse if you would like to come up you can i don't know how you like to do the service or uh we'll have brother jesse come up and and maybe just dismiss the service and then i know we'll have brother amen sing a few songs here in dismissal i know it's late i probably kept you way too long love the lord yeah you want to fatigue out too early [Music] but you know maybe maybe that's just the type we're passing from time to eternity but we don't want to do it all in one night so we'll have a brother jesse come brother jesse i just want to say again i just i i've expressed it before i want to express it again i'm just humbled by the opportunity to come out you know i i love the people of god amen you know that's why i said what i said and i and i know you weren't in the room at the time but i know you heard it's not about puffing anybody up because it's not about sizes of churches god is not a respecter of persons god can touch you just as much here as you could at a camp meeting or at a huge thousand-person assembly of believers he can touch you right here why because he's the same yesterday today and forever he's the same god let's just get our expectation in line with what he wants to do amen brother jesse comes god bless you god bless you love you guys yes sir yes sir [Music] [Music] so then the prayer of faith saves us sin praise god let's make sure there's nothing in our hearts [Music] that's my expectations [Music] [Music] very strongly very clearly lord we thank you for the clearness of your word tonight we've got to have the right approach which is through repentance confessing our faults hallelujah us of any uh cardinal trying to figure things out lord help us to just grab a heart of faith lord hallelujah in jesus name that you made the promise we trust you to answer however you need however you want to answer lord let your will be done not our will let's be that mature christian like paul even if you turn us down we still say praise the lord our glory the power of god because i trust you lord god forgive us forgive us of any carnal thinking lord god and right now we just accept your promises by faith lord we just want our our our requests to you that the peace of god that passes all your standing will keep our hearts and minds through christ jesus we thank you lord for forgiving us now lord god we just have your expectation that let your will be done [Music]
