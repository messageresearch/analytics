[0:05] 1 Corinthians 11 verse
[0:18] 1. Hallelujah. For there say amen. Let's
[0:22] read that together. Just the first
[0:23] verse. One, two, three. Be ye followers
[0:26] of me even as I am also of Christ. Let's
[0:30] have one more word of prayer. You have a
[0:31] need on your heart. Let's just make it
[0:33] known to God. Heavenly Father, we thank
[0:34] you for tonight. Lord, we stand in all
[0:36] of you. Lord God, you made us happy.
[0:38] You've been good to us. We've been
[0:39] blessed. You've been so good to us,
[0:41] Lord. Precious to us are your thoughts,
[0:44] Lord, of us. And of course, the the plan
[0:46] of salvation. What a beautiful plan you
[0:49] have by the blood of Jesus Christ to
[0:51] forgive our sins and then fill us with
[0:53] the Holy Ghost, Lord. What a tremendous
[0:55] blessing and what a beautiful plan
[0:57] you've laid out, Lord God. As we come
[0:58] upon, Lord, this weekend with Good
[1:00] Friday and Easter, Lord, make it new
[1:02] again to it to us, Lord. Make it fresh,
[1:04] Lord God. Hallelujah. And may the living
[1:06] God show up amongst us, Lord God. We see
[1:08] you working amongst us, Lord, moving
[1:10] amongst us, Lord. Drawing uh believers
[1:13] closer to you, Lord God. Continue the
[1:15] work that only you can do, Lord Jesus.
[1:17] Hallelujah. May you get all the glory,
[1:19] Father. May you be magnified, Almighty
[1:21] God. And we ask all these things in the
[1:23] name of Jesus Christ. And the saint
[1:25] said, "Amen." God bless you as you're
[1:27] being seated. Praise God. You can switch
[1:29] over in case you have few notes here by
[1:31] God's
[1:37] grace. So, we want to look at part 15
[1:40] here. We've been uh preaching through
[1:42] the book of Corinthians. It's been a
[1:44] blessing. Took a little break there on
[1:46] the spirit of burning uh series, but uh
[1:48] that was a real blessing. I hope
[1:49] everybody's enjoying that by the grace
[1:51] of the Lord. And we look, let's look uh
[1:54] we'll try to finish chapter 11 here. I
[1:56] never know, you know, if I'll get
[1:57] through the whole chapter, but we'll try
[1:58] to get through the chapter by God's
[2:00] grace. So, so far we're we made it up to
[2:02] where the blue is there. Uh we're
[2:04] section six here. We're beginning
[2:06] tonight on the headship and the Lord's
[2:08] supper. That's what we're looking at
[2:09] here tonight in chapter uh 11. Paul goes
[2:13] into headship uh which means who has the
[2:16] authority. Praise God. And so we know
[2:18] the Bible says in other books that uh in
[2:21] Christ there's neither there's neither
[2:22] male nor female, Greek nor Jew. And what
[2:25] he's talking about is of course the
[2:27] value of every believer. The value of
[2:29] every believer is the same. Uh men are
[2:31] just as valuable as women and children
[2:33] and they're just as valuable as adults,
[2:35] right? We're all valuable in Christ
[2:36] Jesus. But in this chapter, we see the
[2:38] headship. This is why God has uh men
[2:41] ruling over the church and so forth and
[2:44] not women. So Paul lays it out in this
[2:47] uh passage. Of course, we also know why
[2:49] men are called to preach and women are
[2:50] not called to preach. Paul Paul tells us
[2:53] that in 1 Timothy chapter 2 as well
[2:56] because Eve was the first one deceived,
[2:58] right? That's why uh women are not
[3:00] allowed to preach. And so uh we see the
[3:04] same thing here uh as far as men rule
[3:06] the church. Men rule the home. Now, of
[3:08] course, church, they only rule by the
[3:10] leadership of the Holy Spirit. Praise
[3:11] God. And every man, every leader will
[3:14] make a mistake. Uh there's no perfect
[3:15] leader except the Lord Jesus Christ.
[3:17] Hallelujah. But a humble man uh is in
[3:20] the Bible said the humble man who's led
[3:22] by the Holy Ghost is in the image of
[3:24] God. And uh then the woman is in the
[3:26] image of man. Praise God. So we'll look
[3:29] at this here tonight and I trust it be a
[3:31] blessing to you. It's been quite a great
[3:32] series for me. I just love going
[3:34] scripture by scripture. I just love
[3:36] feeding on the word of God. Hallelujah.
[3:38] So uh we we've we got through the
[3:40] Christian liberties. uh mostly and then
[3:43] the warnings amongst liberties and uh
[3:45] we'll look at headship here in the
[3:46] Lord's supper here tonight by God's
[3:48] grace. So uh CI Scoffield uh the
[3:50] preacher from the 1900s early 1900s he
[3:53] breaks this chapter up into three parts.
[3:55] First Christian
[3:57] order of authority right and uh the sign
[4:00] of that authority of course is the hair
[4:02] that's the sign of authority for
[4:04] Christians. It was the same sign for
[4:05] Jews as well right because the same
[4:07] order continues from the Old Testament
[4:09] into the New Testament. Praise God. Uh
[4:12] and then uh Paul rebuked some disorder
[4:14] that's been happening at the Lord's
[4:15] table. And again, this ought to be
[4:17] encouraging to us that we don't have
[4:18] this disorder at our church. Praise God.
[4:21] We just had church or we just had
[4:22] communion a few weeks ago. Nobody got
[4:24] drunk at communion. Praise God. I'm
[4:26] talking about natural wine. Hallelujah.
[4:27] If you got drunk on the Holy Ghost,
[4:29] that's a good thing. Hallelujah. That's
[4:30] what we want to be. We want to be drunk
[4:32] on the Holy Ghost. Brother Man said,
[4:33] "I've been uh Brother Man said, I've
[4:35] been a Christian for 30 years." He said,
[4:36] "I've been drunk on the Holy Ghost for
[4:37] 30 years." Hallelujah.
[4:40] So it just means you're full of God's
[4:41] love, full of God's power, full of the
[4:44] joy of the Lord. Hallelujah. We struggle
[4:45] with that, but God always renews our
[4:47] strength. Hallelujah. He always re
[4:48] renews our joy. Praise God. And then the
[4:51] chapter ends of course with the order of
[4:54] communion and the meaning of the Lord's
[4:56] table as we read a few weeks ago. We'll
[4:58] just uh you know briefly go through that
[5:00] one here by God's grace. So in chapter
[5:03] 11 verse one was our text here tonight.
[5:06] We read uh Paul. He says, "Be ye
[5:08] followers of me even as I also am of
[5:12] Christ." Now, what's happening is Paul's
[5:14] probably continuing his thought from the
[5:16] previous chapter about pleasing others
[5:19] with what they eat and where they eat.
[5:23] Hallelujah. And remember, we saw how
[5:25] some of the Christians in Paul's time,
[5:26] they would actually go into these
[5:28] idolatrous houses and they would
[5:31] actually eat leftover food from a
[5:33] sacrifice that was to pagan gods. Now,
[5:36] while they were in there, there probably
[5:38] wasn't prostitution going on. But any
[5:40] other time they weren't in there, there
[5:41] probably was prostitution going around.
[5:44] So, the the equivalent for us would be
[5:45] like going out to a bar and trying to
[5:47] eat at a bar, right? Or in a what they
[5:50] call adult filthy entertainment, what
[5:52] they call those
[5:53] nightclubs. Uh, a Christian should not
[5:55] go to those places. And Paul says, don't
[5:59] go there. Hallelujah. Uh, don't go
[6:02] there. Separate yourself. He says, "You
[6:04] cannot drink from the cup of the Lord
[6:05] and the cup of devils." Hallelujah. And
[6:09] so he's saying, see, in other words,
[6:10] he's saying, "Follow me. I don't do
[6:11] that. So follow me because I'm following
[6:14] Christ."
[6:15] Hallelujah. That's right. Uh but we see
[6:18] uh the truth, there's this forever truth
[6:20] or this uh faithful truth that God's
[6:23] servants that we're to follow the
[6:24] servants of God in scripture.
[6:27] Hallelujah. So as a pastor, you're
[6:29] supposed to follow my faith. When I was
[6:31] when I was under brother Brooks, I was
[6:32] following Brother Brooks's faith.
[6:34] Hallelujah. When he was my pastor, I
[6:36] would look at his faith and try to model
[6:38] my life after his faith. Praise God. And
[6:41] of course, uh, no human pastor will ever
[6:43] be perfect. But you look at their life,
[6:46] you look at their testimony and you see
[6:48] the fruit when when you see good fruit
[6:50] in their life, you follow that faith.
[6:52] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[6:55] So, uh, God bless you, brothers. Good to
[6:57] see you today. Hallelujah.
[6:59] So this is this chapter begins. Of
[7:01] course, remember there wasn't chapters
[7:02] until I think if I'm not mistaken, the
[7:04] 17 or 1800s. They didn't even put
[7:05] chapters in the Bible if I'm not
[7:07] mistaken. I forget the year. I I heard
[7:09] it a few weeks ago, but then I forgot
[7:10] it. But chapter 10 ended by saying,
[7:12] "Give none offense, neither to the Jews,
[7:15] nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church
[7:16] of God, even as I please all men in all
[7:19] things, not seeking my own profit, but
[7:21] the profit of many that they may be
[7:23] saved." So Paul said, "I'm going to go
[7:25] to any lengths just to try to save one
[7:27] soul." Hallelujah. In that case, he's
[7:30] talking, I won't go to those pagan, we
[7:32] say whouses or whatever they we won't go
[7:34] to those places in order that I might
[7:36] influence people to follow Christ.
[7:40] Hallelujah. So me, I won't go to the
[7:43] bars. I won't go to any place like that
[7:45] even to try to witness. I'll never go to
[7:47] those places because I want to I want to
[7:49] model to people that I'm a servant of
[7:51] Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[7:54] Glory. So again, we must live as Paul
[7:56] said, we must live our lives free from
[7:59] sinful offense to others. Try not to sin
[8:01] against others. Try to always live a
[8:03] life that's makes people want to serve
[8:05] Jesus as well. Hallelujah. Uh live. So
[8:09] we should focus on pleasing others that
[8:11] they should be saved. Hallelujah. Glory
[8:14] to God. Now getting back to chapter one.
[8:16] Now this is the second time. If you've
[8:18] been keeping track, the Holy Spirit kind
[8:19] of brought this to my remembrance. If
[8:20] you've been keeping track, this is the
[8:22] second time here that Paul says, "Follow
[8:24] me." Hallelujah. He said it earlier in
[8:27] chapter 4. Uh it was verse 15 and 16. Uh
[8:31] by God's
[8:32] grace. So I was kind of skipping a
[8:34] little to little ahead in my notes
[8:37] here. And so uh now he was talking about
[8:40] uh because he was the one that preached
[8:43] them Christ and they got saved under uh
[8:46] Paul's ministry. So Paul says, "Because
[8:48] you got saved through my preaching,
[8:50] follow my life." Now, I think the only
[8:53] ones here that maybe they got saved
[8:54] under my preaching was maybe my
[8:56] children. So, but uh if I'm your pastor,
[8:58] you're supposed to follow me, too.
[9:00] Follow my life. Hallelujah. And uh uh
[9:04] so, you know, we uh we look to that if
[9:07] if someone preached the gospel and you
[9:08] got saved uh under their ministry, then
[9:11] they begot you to Christ. Hallelujah.
[9:14] And then he says, "Be a follower." Which
[9:16] means an
[9:17] imitator. Right? Now, if it was my way,
[9:20] I would have everybody come to service
[9:21] when I come to service and pray at the
[9:23] altar when I pray to the altar. Pray at
[9:26] the altar. Right? Or if I pray, stop and
[9:28] pray after service, I would like you to
[9:30] pray after service, too. Right? Because
[9:32] we want to we all want to draw in and
[9:34] get a closer walk with God. Hallelujah.
[9:37] You know, you just look at someone's
[9:38] life and you look at the pastor's life
[9:40] or you look at the elders of the church,
[9:42] you look at their lives. You want to
[9:43] live a life uh that's pleasing unto God.
[9:45] You want to you want to imitate the
[9:47] servants of God who are serving God
[9:49] faithfully. Hallelujah. Amen. That's
[9:52] right. Now, this reminded me too. Paul
[9:55] also said, "Imitate
[9:57] God." Right? And that's and that's what
[10:00] the statute of perfect man is all about
[10:01] because brother Ram says and we added
[10:03] these words because brother Ram makes it
[10:04] he makes it known in the sermon in 1962.
[10:07] He said not just faith but it's his
[10:09] faith. So it's a faith of Jesus not just
[10:13] virtue but his virtue. Right? So when we
[10:16] have these anointings it's actually the
[10:18] spirit of Jesus Christ. It's Jesus
[10:21] Christ's own knowledge. It's Jesus
[10:23] Christ's own temperance. That's why we
[10:24] can have victory over our passions,
[10:27] right? Because we have his temperance.
[10:29] That's why we can be patient because we
[10:31] have the patience of Christ. And if we
[10:33] don't have it, say, "Jesus, I need your
[10:34] patience." Right? Jesus, I need your
[10:37] brotherly kindness. Jesus, I need your
[10:39] godliness because I can't do it with
[10:41] mine. I need yours. Praise God.
[10:46] And so, that's that's what this is
[10:47] essentially saying. Paul's saying,
[10:49] "Modle uh model your life after me
[10:51] because I've received his patience. I've
[10:54] received his charity. I've received the
[10:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost." That's
[10:58] right. Same Greek word here. Be then
[11:01] followers, be imitators of God. Live
[11:04] like God. That's quite that's quite a
[11:06] that's quite a standard to live up to.
[11:08] But Jesus said you could do it. Be
[11:10] therefore perfect even as your father
[11:12] which is in heaven is perfect. In other
[11:13] words, be mature. That the perfect word
[11:15] perfect there means mature. I preached
[11:17] on it last year. I looked it up. So, we
[11:19] must follow God and his prophets and of
[11:22] course and the local pastors and
[11:23] ministry that God puts in our lives. And
[11:26] I'd even say elders. Praise God. Because
[11:27] the Bible said the young the older women
[11:29] are to teach the younger women.
[11:31] Hallelujah. That's right. This is why
[11:34] it's acceptable to preach about Brother
[11:35] Brandham's life experiences, how they
[11:37] connect to the Bible. Just like Martin
[11:39] Luther, John Wesley, William Seymour, we
[11:42] preached on him last year. What a mighty
[11:44] man of God he was. Faithful to the Lord.
[11:47] And uh and that's why you can do it
[11:49] because we're to follow those who have
[11:51] real Christian faith. Hallelujah. That's
[11:54] right.
[11:55] Now Paul says uh here says uh no I
[11:59] praise you in verse two. I praise you.
[12:01] That doesn't mean you're he's worshiping
[12:02] them. Right? Praise can have different
[12:04] meanings. Right? Now people today they
[12:07] say if if I said oh I praise you Malachi
[12:10] for how you play. Oh he's a he's a
[12:12] heretic. He's he's he's a devil. You
[12:13] know you use a word like that. But
[12:16] that's that's so we know better. We
[12:18] wouldn't use a word like that. I commend
[12:20] you. I I really approve of what you're
[12:23] doing. Thank you for doing what you're
[12:24] doing. Right. Brother says it giving
[12:26] them a a a rose. Right. Giving giving
[12:28] them a little rose or a wreath.
[12:30] Hallelujah. So Paul says, "Now I praise
[12:33] you, brethren, that you remember me in
[12:35] all things and keep the ordinances as I
[12:38] deliver them to you."
[12:41] Now Paul, the the Bible says he was
[12:43] there for about a year and a half, 18
[12:46] months, and he taught them the word of
[12:48] the Lord. So this praise now, it must
[12:51] refer to what he's going to say next
[12:53] because he already baldled them out for
[12:55] a lot of things already earlier in the
[12:57] letter. He said, I just I'm going to you
[13:00] you remember me in all things. They
[13:01] weren't remembering him in all things.
[13:04] It was all things related to this next
[13:06] section on headship.
[13:09] He wasn't remember them about divisions.
[13:11] He wasn't remember them about
[13:12] fornication,
[13:14] right? Because the the the the man was
[13:16] sleeping with his stepmother and a lot
[13:18] of the church hadn't even repented of
[13:20] it. So he he's saying, I'm I'm letting
[13:23] you know, thank you for remembering me
[13:25] in all things regarding
[13:28] headship. So this was a pretty clean
[13:31] looking church. I might say they were
[13:33] pretty holy church as far as the hair
[13:36] that they wore. Hallelujah. The length
[13:38] of their hair was pretty
[13:40] good. And you keep the ordinances or the
[13:43] Greek as traditions as I deliver them
[13:46] unto you.
[13:48] Hallelujah. Now, uh later on the chapter
[13:51] we're going to see Paul says there's
[13:53] divisions and heresies. So that proves
[13:56] the church wasn't obedient in all
[13:58] things. He's talking about just about
[14:00] this subject of
[14:02] headship. Hallelujah. and church. That's
[14:04] how that that's how any Christian would
[14:07] be. You know, we we shouldn't pretend
[14:10] like people, you know, if if some of us
[14:12] aren't getting it right. Let's not
[14:14] pretend like you're we're getting it
[14:15] right in all things, but let's
[14:17] compliment each other on the things we
[14:19] are getting good.
[14:21] Say, "Thank you for doing this. Praise
[14:23] God." Hallelujah. And church, if the if
[14:25] they're honest, the Holy Ghost will
[14:27] begin working in their lives on
[14:28] everything else. Praise God. Remember
[14:31] the testimony when we recorded my wife's
[14:32] testimony? When we first come in the
[14:34] message, nobody walked up and said,
[14:35] "Take out that earring, Sister Christen,
[14:36] or take the You need to cut that hair,
[14:39] Brother Jesse." Nobody's had to do that.
[14:41] I had long hair. But nobody had to do
[14:44] that because we just come around, we
[14:46] love the word. And pretty soon, Kristen,
[14:48] I listened to her testimony a little
[14:49] while ago. She said, she looked around
[14:51] and one time during service, thought,
[14:52] "Oh, these women don't have uh earrings
[14:54] on. I have earrings on." What brought
[14:56] that thought? The Holy Ghost brought
[14:58] that thought. Hallelujah.
[15:01] Right. And I and I had the Bible study
[15:03] and my first question was, "Okay, so men
[15:04] are supposed to have short hair. So then
[15:06] should I cut my hair?" Brother Craig's
[15:08] like, "Yeah, you should cut your hair."
[15:10] Okay, I'll go do that. Sounds good. Who
[15:14] wants to cut it
[15:15] now? So, see, you know, uh they were a
[15:18] faithful church. They could obey their
[15:20] hair lengths, but they had a little
[15:22] trouble at the Lord's supper. They had a
[15:25] little trouble when it came to wine. Had
[15:27] a little trouble about eating meat and
[15:28] going to the right stores and
[15:30] restaurants. And the church said
[15:32] had a little trouble sexually.
[15:35] They had trouble with divisions. Well,
[15:36] well, we follow brother Jess. Oh, we
[15:38] follow brother so and so. We follow we
[15:40] just follow Jesus. We don't need any
[15:42] preachers.
[15:43] They had trouble with
[15:44] that. But what they got good Paul made
[15:48] sure, hey, you've you've obeyed me. I
[15:50] approve of what you've done. I praise
[15:51] you. You've done good with this
[15:54] topic. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen.
[15:58] Verse two. Let's continue here.
[16:01] But I would have you know that the head
[16:02] of every man is Christ. So they at least
[16:04] had headship good and hair lengths in
[16:07] the
[16:08] church. Paul I want you to know he says
[16:11] the head of every man is Christ.
[16:14] Glory and the head of the woman is the
[16:16] man and the head of Christ is
[16:19] God. So we have an order of
[16:23] authority. God is first invisible
[16:26] spirit. Christ, the body of the son of
[16:29] God is submissive to God. Right? All
[16:33] men, males are under Christ and all
[16:37] females are under males. That's the way
[16:40] God sets it up. Praise God. Now, church,
[16:42] let's remember that requires us men. If
[16:46] we're to be the leaders of the church
[16:47] and leaders of the home, we better make
[16:50] sure we're submitting to our head or
[16:53] else we mess up everybody else under us.
[16:55] Amen. If I don't submit to the Holy
[16:57] Ghost, I just don't mess up my wife and
[16:59] children. I mess up all the father the
[17:02] fathers here, husbands and their wives
[17:04] and their children.
[17:07] Glory. So that's why we got to pray.
[17:10] That's why we got to talk to the Lord.
[17:11] That's why we got to meditate on the
[17:13] things of God. Right? Spirit of burning
[17:15] will cause us to meditate
[17:18] on the things of God.
[17:21] Now, I just thought for a a nice review,
[17:24] I just quickly go over what four?
[17:26] Because there's four. There's woman,
[17:28] man, Christ, God.
[17:32] Four. Why four? Because four is an
[17:36] earthly number. And this is the earthly
[17:38] number regarded of headship. There's
[17:40] four levels of headship on earth and
[17:43] heaven.
[17:45] Hallelujah. How many remember this when
[17:47] I preached this years ago? Four has at
[17:49] least three meanings. Now, I wonder why
[17:51] it don't have four
[17:53] meanings, but I got quotes that say it
[17:56] has at least three meanings. Four means
[17:59] a double
[18:01] confirmation. It's an earthly number and
[18:04] it's deliverance. Brother
[18:07] Chris, I'm going to show you right now.
[18:09] Yeah, good question. Because there's a
[18:10] lot of fours in nature. There's a lot of
[18:12] fours in nature. Good, good, good
[18:13] question, brother. Yep. Uh I preached a
[18:15] long series on this. Jose loved it
[18:17] because I was using lots of quoting. He
[18:18] loves the quotes. I use lots of quotes
[18:20] on this one. So, here's where let's go
[18:22] over the double confirmation. Brother
[18:24] Ram says, "Yes, two is a confirmation
[18:25] because in the mouth of two or three
[18:27] witnesses, let every word be
[18:29] established." But brother said, "But if
[18:30] you get four, it'll be a double
[18:32] confirmation. Then we ought to believe
[18:34] it with all of our
[18:35] hearts." Okay? So, four is a double
[18:40] confirmation.
[18:43] Hallelujah. Now, there's four elements
[18:45] of God's love. What does that show? God
[18:48] gives you a double confirmation. He
[18:49] loves you.
[18:51] There's a breadth which is east and and
[18:54] width and east and west. There's length,
[18:57] number of days of life. There's depth of
[18:59] wisdom. There's height, faithfulness
[19:01] that reaches to the heavens. The Bible
[19:04] says, there's four elements of God's
[19:08] love. There's a double confirmation of
[19:11] reward. A two-talent man receives two
[19:13] more. So God gives him a double
[19:15] confirmation that he was faithful. He
[19:17] got four talents. Basheba had four sons.
[19:20] God gave her a double confirmation. God
[19:22] had forgiven her of her adultery. And
[19:24] the church said, "God forgives sexual
[19:27] sins." God forgives all sins when we
[19:30] truly repent.
[19:32] Glory. God gave her a double
[19:34] confirmation. And then God let her write
[19:35] that last chapter or let her have words
[19:37] in that last chapter of the Proverbs 31
[19:39] woman. Who's it written by? Who's this
[19:41] Proverbs 31 woman? Basheba.
[19:44] the woman that got caught up for
[19:46] whatever reason in adultery and uh
[19:48] agreed to the adultery. God lets her
[19:51] then write about what a true woman
[19:52] should be like. That's the power of
[19:54] forgiveness.
[19:56] God takes somebody that you wouldn't
[19:57] think maybe deserves it and God gives
[19:59] her grace and then God lets her
[20:01] understand what a real woman is.
[20:04] That's the love of God. The prodigal son
[20:07] received a double confirmation of his
[20:09] restoration. He got a robe, a ring,
[20:12] shoes, and a kiss from his father.
[20:16] Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost has a double
[20:19] confirmation of his witnesses on earth.
[20:21] God gives us signs, wonders, miracles,
[20:24] and gifts of the Holy Ghost as a double
[20:26] confirmation that he's that he's with
[20:28] us. Hallelujah.
[20:30] Four women are mentioned in Jesus
[20:32] genealogy. So this is encourage our
[20:34] sisters here tonight to show God's
[20:36] double confirmation for the equality of
[20:39] male and female. In other words, God
[20:40] loves male and female the
[20:43] same. Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, Basheba, two
[20:48] Jews, two Gentiles.
[20:51] Hallelujah. In Christ, there's neither
[20:54] male nor female. Hallelujah. Look who he
[20:56] places. And these women are even in his
[20:58] genealogy. In other words, Jesus said,
[21:00] "These women are worthy to be in my
[21:02] family tree." Hallelujah. And if they're
[21:04] worthy to be in his family tree, what
[21:06] about you and I? Praise God.
[21:09] Does that make you believe you're a part
[21:10] of Jesus family tree?
[21:16] Glory. Eve was mentioned four times by
[21:19] name in the Bible. Perhaps as a double
[21:21] confirmation, she's forgiven of her
[21:23] heirs in Eden.
[21:26] Genesis 3:20, uh, Genesis 4:1,
[21:32] uh, 2 Corinthians 11:3, and 1 Timothy
[21:36] 2. The rainbows mentioned four times.
[21:39] See, it's a double
[21:40] confirmation. God's never going to flood
[21:42] the earth
[21:43] again. Satan has four titles to double
[21:46] confirm his identity. He's Satan, the
[21:48] old dragon, the old serpent, the devil.
[21:51] That's why a lot of you hate snakes.
[21:53] Philip had four virgin daughters that
[21:56] prophesied. Look at that. A double
[21:57] confirmation to his
[21:59] ministry.
[22:03] Hallelujah. Now, here's where brother
[22:05] said four is a earthly number. He's
[22:08] talking about the four beasts up in
[22:09] heaven and uh three of them I'm sorry,
[22:12] no, all of them are found on earth,
[22:15] right? You got the uh the lion, the ox,
[22:18] the man, and the eagle. Where do you
[22:20] find all those? You find them on earth.
[22:22] But they represented it in heaven.
[22:24] Hallelujah. Let it be done on earth as
[22:27] it is in heaven. Four is the earthly
[22:31] number. There's four. On the fourth day
[22:33] of creation, the earthly and heavenly
[22:35] material was finished. The sun, moon,
[22:37] and stars on day four. There's four
[22:40] elements to the earth. I'm sorry, to the
[22:42] to the atmosphere. Earth, air, water,
[22:46] fire. There's four earth regions. North,
[22:48] south, east, west. There's four
[22:50] divisions of the day, cockcrowing,
[22:52] morning, evening, midnight. There's four
[22:54] night watches, Jesus tells us. There's
[22:57] four great lunar phases, cresant,
[22:59] gibious, waxing, and
[23:01] waning. There's four kinds of hearts
[23:04] that the word can fall on. Wayside,
[23:06] stony, thorny, good ground. There's four
[23:08] kinds of vessels on the earth. Good, I'm
[23:10] sorry, gold, silver, wood, earth.
[23:12] There's four crosses at Calvary. Uh
[23:15] Jesus's the saved thief, the lost thief,
[23:17] and Judas. There's four conditions
[23:19] you'll be in at the rapture. God, help
[23:21] us to be holy when the rapture comes.
[23:23] Hallelujah.
[23:24] You'll either be holy, righteous,
[23:26] filthy, or
[23:27] unjust. And there's four cherubams or
[23:30] throne guards in heaven that have
[23:32] earthly symbols or earthly likeness. The
[23:35] lion, ox, man,
[23:38] eagle. There's four ingredients to the
[23:41] uh prayer incense that goes up from
[23:43] earth to heaven. And I forgot to write
[23:45] the three down. I for some reason I
[23:47] didn't get to that one. There's the
[23:49] earthly symbol of headship. God, Christ,
[23:51] man, woman. The elect Jews are gathered
[23:54] from the four winds. Hallelujah. The
[23:57] four angels stand on the four corners of
[23:59] the earth. There was four Roman soldiers
[24:01] crucified Jesus, dividing his garments
[24:03] into four parts.
[24:06] Right? Mankind is divided into four
[24:09] groups. There's families, tongues,
[24:11] lands, nations. There's four gentile
[24:13] powers we went over two weeks ago,
[24:15] right? You have Babylon, Mes and
[24:17] Persians, Grecians, Rome. We're under
[24:19] the Roman rule now by spiritual Rome.
[24:22] Abraham battled four kings. After the
[24:24] victory, he had communion with
[24:26] Melzdc. There's four unclean animals.
[24:29] Camel, the hair, the conia, the hierax,
[24:31] and the
[24:32] swine. Now, that's just a picture of the
[24:34] hierarch. I'm not going to go through
[24:35] that tonight. There's four judgments
[24:37] upon Jerusalem in Ezekiel's day. The
[24:39] sword, the famine, the noisome beast,
[24:42] pestilence. So, earth suffered with a
[24:44] double confirmation. Uh, Jerusalem
[24:46] suffered because Israel turned their
[24:48] backs on God. A double confirmation that
[24:50] they disobeyed the word. There's four
[24:53] abominations. Simon preached it on when
[24:55] I was sick there a couple weeks ago.
[24:56] There's four abominations. The image of
[24:58] jealousy, the creeping things, the women
[25:00] weeping for tamuz, and uh the 25 men in
[25:04] the inner court. There's four kinds of
[25:06] flesh on the earth. The beast, the bird,
[25:08] fish, and
[25:10] man. There's four ways the body is sown
[25:12] and raised. It's swn in corruption,
[25:14] raised incorruptible. It's swn in
[25:16] dishonor, raised in glory. It's sown in
[25:19] weakness, it's raised in power. It's swn
[25:21] in natural body. And church, when we
[25:23] raise, we get a spiritual body.
[25:24] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Jesus had 70
[25:29] uh in a four-fold prohibition. You
[25:31] couldn't take a purse if you were an
[25:32] apostle. You couldn't take a script,
[25:34] shoes, no saluting anyone. It was a
[25:37] earthly mission. There's four little
[25:39] things on the earth with exceeding
[25:40] wisdom. The ants. And they're right.
[25:42] They're going right now through our
[25:44] house. It's their time to go through our
[25:45] house and search out for food sources.
[25:47] I've been killing some of them in my
[25:48] house. Conies, right? Feeble, uh, with
[25:51] houses in the rocks. The locust, they
[25:54] have no king, but they go forth in
[25:55] bands. Spiders even live in king's
[25:58] palaces, and I got to clean those out of
[25:59] my house all the time, too. Uh, there's
[26:02] uh some pieces in the tabernacle where
[26:05] four square. Notice four square. All
[26:07] these all these ways that we can be
[26:09] forgiven on earth were represented by
[26:12] four
[26:13] square. The brazen altar, the yurum
[26:15] thumbum, and the altar of
[26:17] incense. The new Jerusalem is four
[26:19] square. Equal length, breadth, and
[26:21] height. Earthly suffering is four-fold.
[26:24] Church, you're going to have four types
[26:25] of troubles on this earth, but God
[26:28] delivers them from all of us.
[26:30] Hallelujah. Or God delivers us from all
[26:32] of them. Praise God. We'll get to that
[26:34] in second Corinthians. The Bible said
[26:35] God delivers us from all of these.
[26:37] You'll get delivered from your trouble.
[26:38] And the church said, "You'll get
[26:40] delivered from being
[26:42] perplexed. You'll get delivered from
[26:44] being persecuted. And you'll be
[26:46] delivered from being cast down."
[26:50] That's right. Four is also a number of
[26:53] deliverance. So those are all the reason
[26:55] those are some of the reasons, brother,
[26:56] that four is a earthly number. All those
[26:58] connections to earth. All right. Four is
[27:00] also a number of deliverance. Lazarus
[27:02] was raised on the fourth day. The fourth
[27:05] man in the fire saved the three Hebrew
[27:07] children. There's four stages to
[27:09] adoption. Thought you could go from the
[27:11] thought of God to flesh to the theophony
[27:13] to glorified body. There's four stages
[27:16] to Jesus manifestation. He was thought,
[27:18] then he was logos, pillar of fire, then
[27:20] became flesh, then glorified body.
[27:23] There's four steps to true hope. First,
[27:25] you must go through tribulation. Then
[27:27] you get patience. Then you get
[27:28] experience which is character. Then you
[27:30] get hope. Think about that. Having hope
[27:33] in your life is the fourth step that God
[27:35] wants you to attain to. I I hope I have
[27:39] the hope. I'm going to the rapture. I
[27:41] have the hope. I'm going to heaven.
[27:43] Praise God.
[27:45] Because I've gone through the other four
[27:47] stages. I know I'll get the fourth
[27:49] stage. Hallelujah. That's right, church.
[27:55] Adinijah received mercy in the days of
[27:57] Solomon because he ran to the four horns
[28:00] at the golden altar before God. There's
[28:02] four horns.
[28:04] Deliverance. Job's deliverance came
[28:07] after the fourth messenger, right? The
[28:09] three miserable comforters and then
[28:12] Elahu. Glory to God. And then Satan
[28:16] always imitates the number four, right?
[28:17] Uh God has a good number. God has a good
[28:20] meaning for the numbers, but then Satan
[28:21] comes around and perverts it.
[28:23] Satan has four horse riders, the riders
[28:25] of death. Then he has four stages in sin
[28:28] and temptation, lust, entice, lust
[28:30] conceived, uh sin, and then death.
[28:33] There's four insects, palmer, locust,
[28:36] cankerworm, caterpillar. Four men had a
[28:38] vow to kill
[28:40] Paul. All right, back to chapter 11.
[28:42] Nice review there for you. That's one
[28:44] sermon in five minutes right there. How
[28:47] do you like
[28:48] that? Now, verse four. Every man praying
[28:51] or prophesying having his head covered
[28:53] dishonors
[28:55] Christ. So men with long hair, there's
[28:57] even preachers that have long hair like
[28:59] dreadlocks, white preachers and black
[29:01] preachers, any it can be anybody. Any
[29:04] man who preaches with long uncut hair
[29:07] dishonors Jesus Christ. It's a
[29:10] dishonor. And actually, one of them is
[29:12] getting exposed right now. What's his
[29:13] name? Todd White's getting exposed. He
[29:15] does these fake uh leg lengthening
[29:17] routines and does all these uh pleas to
[29:20] get money and try to get rich and he's
[29:22] being exposed right
[29:23] now. And the guys are like, "Sue us. We
[29:25] we got all the evidence." Like, "Sue us,
[29:28] brother,
[29:30] Chris." Yes. Yep. That's the big one.
[29:33] It's almost got uh 750,000 views now. I
[29:35] just I listened to it this week, too.
[29:37] Yeah. He's got long uncut hair. I always
[29:39] And you know, just looking at him always
[29:40] something's wrong with that guy. The
[29:43] hair gives him away.
[29:44] Right. And now it's all going to come
[29:46] out. Oh, yeah. He said he he said he's
[29:48] never sinned since he got saved. Never
[29:50] sinned or been depressed or anything
[29:53] like that.
[29:54] Yeah. What a Yep. Exactly. What a liar.
[29:57] See, the truth, I'm sorry, your sins,
[29:59] the Bible said, are going to find you
[30:00] out. They can only long They can only
[30:03] lie so much and Jesus will expose their
[30:06] lies. Church, always tell the truth.
[30:10] Don't make something Don't make yourself
[30:11] something that you're not. Yes, have
[30:14] boldness. Yeah, have the have have
[30:16] confidence in God's word. But also
[30:17] remember how weak and frail you are.
[30:20] David, right? David wrote about that in
[30:22] Psalm 39. We looked at it. Lord, show me
[30:25] how show me the end of my days. Show me
[30:26] how frail I am that I might seek after
[30:29] your will for my
[30:31] life. Every woman that prays or
[30:34] prophesies with her head uncovered or
[30:36] with cut hair dishonors her head, her
[30:40] husband. For that is all even all one as
[30:44] if she were shaven. So just to trim the
[30:47] hair a little is the same in God's eyes
[30:49] as cutting off all your hair. It's a
[30:54] dishonor. And remember we read two thus
[30:56] sayith the Lord statements two weeks ago
[30:58] when brother Rod was
[31:00] here. A woman uh with cut hair is not
[31:04] born again. She cannot be dis I'm sorry.
[31:06] She cannot be born again and dishonor
[31:08] her husband in such a public
[31:11] fashion. Right? But Abraham says, I'm
[31:14] just going to skip down. He talks about
[31:15] how the Nazarite vow in the Old
[31:16] Testament was a foreshadow of the New
[31:19] Testament, right? Because men mostly men
[31:22] had Nazarite vows, but now men have to
[31:24] cut their hair. Now, it also fits too
[31:27] because they the men always had to cut
[31:29] their hair at the end of the vow unless
[31:31] they were a lifelong Nazerite. Right?
[31:34] Brother Ram said, "The woman that's a
[31:35] child of God, lets her hair grow to show
[31:37] that she's consecrated to every word of
[31:40] God. If she cuts it off, I don't care
[31:42] how much she dances, sings in the choir,
[31:44] speaks in tongues, runs up and down, has
[31:46] all kind of aid societies, she's dead."
[31:48] The same is true for a man that grows
[31:50] out his hair. Right? I don't care how
[31:53] much he runs, shouts, if he grows out
[31:54] his hair, he's
[31:55] dead. Right? And I just got a haircut
[31:59] Saturday, so you don't have to worry
[32:00] about me. Hallelujah. I just like it a
[32:03] little longer before it all falls
[32:05] out. He said, "That's thus sayith the
[32:07] Lord, the word of God." Now it's 1
[32:09] Corinthians 11. Yeah. She has denied, we
[32:11] went through that, her Nazarite vow and
[32:13] sold out to the God of the modern age.
[32:14] She does it now. Shame on you, lady. You
[32:17] woman, goodness gracious. The word
[32:20] dishonor means to put to shame who
[32:22] suffers a repulse. And a repulse is
[32:25] intense distaste. So, a woman that cuts
[32:28] her hair causes her husband to have
[32:30] intense something intense distaste. Oh,
[32:32] that's disgusting. That's that's vile.
[32:34] It's wretched. A woman that cuts her
[32:37] hair or a man that grows out his hair,
[32:40] that's a distaste to
[32:42] Jesus,
[32:43] right? It's right there in the
[32:45] scripture. But, but people don't want
[32:47] they just say, "Oh, that's just for the
[32:48] Corinthian church." No, he says it. He
[32:50] says, "This is for all churches." In
[32:52] verse 16, this is for all churches. Now,
[32:55] I didn't set a timer, so you have to
[32:57] bear with me. I just have to use 8
[32:58] o'clock as my
[33:02] timer. Now, again, Brother Bam says,
[33:04] "Now, this was such an issue, and I have
[33:07] I have the articles. I put it in my 2019
[33:09] book. If you want a free copy, it's
[33:10] right out there." Um, the biggest
[33:13] decision in the 1920s, even up to the uh
[33:16] if I can't, if I remember right, up to
[33:18] the 50s, the biggest decision a woman
[33:20] had was is she going to cut her hair or
[33:22] not? That was the biggest decision
[33:25] because all he the history says her
[33:28] father, her husband, her brothers would
[33:30] all snicker and laugh or be disgusted
[33:33] with her. Now, of course, the sinners,
[33:35] they didn't care who what, you know,
[33:36] what would they care about? Uh, but
[33:38] remember even brother Rod, remember
[33:40] brother Rod's grandma kept her hair
[33:41] long, her whole
[33:43] life, but wrote uh I'm sorry, one of her
[33:46] f one of her friends wrote her a letter
[33:48] and said uh she had cut her hair and she
[33:51] felt wrong about it. That was in the
[33:55] 1920s. But it was such an issue. Brother
[33:58] said a woman that cuts her hair, a man
[34:00] has the right to divorce and leave his
[34:02] wife that'll cut her hair. That's the
[34:03] Bible. That's thus sayith the Lord. Too
[34:05] bad you got away from the oldfashioned
[34:07] trainings, isn't it? Okay. Now, he can
[34:12] leave her, but he can't marry anyone
[34:14] else. 1 Corinthians 7 says he's either
[34:17] got to remain separate or
[34:21] reconcile. Now, really, if the man loved
[34:23] her, he would stay with her because
[34:25] we've seen that amongst our ranks. We
[34:27] know numerous, my wife and I know
[34:28] numerous message men who married women
[34:31] uh and either they knew the message or
[34:33] didn't. They still cut their hair. their
[34:35] husbands stay with them. You know why?
[34:36] Because they love them. You know why?
[34:39] Because the man took a vow and said,
[34:40] "I'll love you and nobody else the rest
[34:42] of my life." And I'm making this vow not
[34:45] just before my family, but before
[34:46] Almighty God. Hallelujah.
[34:50] And so and and so let's go the other
[34:52] way. A woman who has long uncut hair
[34:54] would love her husband even if her
[34:56] husband grew his hair out and never cut
[34:58] it again. She'd pray, right, for him to
[35:00] get right with God if she really loved
[35:02] him.
[35:04] Hallelujah. Let's always make sure we
[35:06] balance that out.
[35:09] Hallelujah. Verse six, we don't have to
[35:11] spend much time on this. This is kind of
[35:13] like review up to this point. For if the
[35:15] woman be not covered, let her also be
[35:17] shorn. But if it be a shame for a woman
[35:19] to be shorn, which is cutting the hair
[35:21] short, cutting short hair or shaven, let
[35:23] her be covered. Okay? So, of course, she
[35:26] should be covered because it is a shame
[35:27] to cut hair. That's what he tells us.
[35:29] Verse seven, for a man indeed ought not
[35:32] to cover his head. He not ought not let
[35:34] it grow long. For as much he's the image
[35:36] and glory of who? God. The men represent
[35:40] God. All you brothers represent God. So
[35:43] we cut your hair because you're not
[35:45] under anybody's headship. You're the
[35:47] head, right,
[35:50] brothers? So because you're the head,
[35:52] you got to be the leader. You got to
[35:53] stand on God's word.
[35:56] Hallelujah. You're the image and the
[35:58] glory of God.
[36:01] But the woman is the glory of the
[36:04] man. For the man is not of the woman,
[36:07] but the woman came on man. Remember,
[36:09] where did Eve come from? She came from
[36:10] the rib of Adam, her husband. Where'd
[36:13] you come from? You come from the mind of
[36:15] Christ. Hallelujah.
[36:20] The man is not of the woman. The woman
[36:22] is of the man. Praise
[36:26] God. Neither was the man created for the
[36:28] woman. Hallelujah. So, see, I wasn't
[36:31] created for my wife in one sense. She
[36:33] was created for me. And I'm not trying
[36:36] to say that in a boastful way. I'm just
[36:37] saying like that's what the Bible says.
[36:39] Hallelujah. Now, do I believe I was
[36:41] created for her? Yes, I do believe that.
[36:42] Right? Because we're we're compliments.
[36:45] We're uh the Bible said Adam and Eve
[36:46] were really one spirit at the beginning.
[36:48] If we believe the Bible, your your true
[36:50] spouse, your spirit was one with them.
[36:53] Hallelujah. That's right.
[36:56] For this cause ought the woman to have
[36:59] power or that word means authority. Not
[37:02] that that doesn't mean dunamis like Holy
[37:04] Ghost power. No, it means authority.
[37:06] It's a different kind of a
[37:08] power. In other words, it means she has
[37:10] a a symbol of authority on her head
[37:14] because of the angels. Now, this has
[37:18] always been a striking statement, don't
[37:20] you think? Somebody asked me about this.
[37:22] was either Claude or Patrick asked me
[37:24] about it last summer. Which do you
[37:25] remember which one it was, brother? Is
[37:27] it Oh, it was you. Okay. Yeah. And so I
[37:30] looked up a quote from Brother Brand. I
[37:31] shared it with you. So, this might be a
[37:32] little refreshing for you here. Um
[37:34] there's actually really two strong uh
[37:36] applications that they actually both
[37:38] work. So, I'm going to say both are
[37:40] right. Both
[37:42] work. So, see uh the man was not created
[37:45] for the woman. This is the cause that
[37:47] woman has to have that long hair.
[37:50] Hallelujah. or uncut hair, she has to
[37:53] have it because she was made for the
[37:54] man. The man wasn't made for her.
[37:58] Hallelujah. And we go back to Adam and
[38:00] Eve. Okay, so that that's a good
[38:03] question. The brothers ask me, "What
[38:05] does this mean? Power on her head
[38:07] because of the angels." We got two good
[38:09] examples. Brother Bam gives us uh well,
[38:11] the first one is just the scripture and
[38:13] then the second one is Brother Bam's
[38:14] explanation. They're both excellent. Uh
[38:16] they they both these both work based
[38:19] upon Hebrews. Malachi, look up Hebrews
[38:20] 114. I'll have you read it. Thank you,
[38:22] sir. First, based upon Hebrews 1:14,
[38:24] some think holy angels would minister to
[38:28] the faithful woman who kept their
[38:30] headship symbol long uncut hair because
[38:33] the Bible said the angels uh minister to
[38:36] those who fear God. Well, a woman that
[38:38] cuts her hair, she don't fe fear God as
[38:40] much anymore.
[38:42] Okay. So, Malachi, read Hebrews
[38:46] 1:14. sent.
[38:50] Very
[38:51] good. So, angels are sent to the people
[38:54] that will inherit
[38:56] salvation. Now, how many of them women
[38:58] that cut their hair are going to go to
[38:59] heaven? Very few. There is a small group
[39:02] of foolish virgin. But remember, church,
[39:04] they're going to be under the altar.
[39:05] They're not going to be where the where
[39:06] the saints are. They're going to be
[39:07] under the altar until and I don't know
[39:09] what and they don't even get to live
[39:11] during the millennium on the earth. I'm
[39:13] talking about they won't be on the
[39:15] millennium on the earth for the
[39:17] millennium because they cut their hair.
[39:18] They dishonored. They were foolish. And
[39:20] the church said it's foolish to cut a
[39:23] hair.
[39:34] Foolish. She would never cut it. Yeah.
[39:37] She'd just have to wrap it up. Yeah.
[39:39] And that would be uh that would be a
[39:41] small reproach compared to what Christ
[39:43] suffered on the cross. So any suffering
[39:45] great question any suffering we have in
[39:47] this life it's tiny compared to what
[39:49] Jesus endured for us. Brother man does
[39:52] it like this. Brother said you women he
[39:53] said keep that long hair. He says wear
[39:56] he said wear your your hair like a
[39:59] crown. And it's a crown because Jesus
[40:02] wore a crown of thorns for
[40:05] you. Hallelujah. So look what Jesus put
[40:07] on his head. A crown of thorns. Now you
[40:09] sisters don't have to do that right now.
[40:11] It is a burden though to have long hair.
[40:13] I I know I know I know. I mean I I know
[40:17] I I don't know personally like by
[40:19] experience but I know by what my
[40:22] daughters and my wife tell me it's a lot
[40:23] of work. You got to keep up with it.
[40:26] It's a lot of work. But that all that
[40:29] work is tiny in comparison to what Jesus
[40:32] Christ suffered to save our
[40:36] souls. All right. So based upon that,
[40:39] how many angels are going to minister to
[40:41] these women that cut their hair? Few.
[40:43] Because few find the narrow road that
[40:45] leads to life. How can a woman be on the
[40:47] road to life if she's dishonoring
[40:50] Christ? Only way God would uh uh the God
[40:52] would wink at it is if she don't know.
[40:54] Like we saw, there's a time God will
[40:56] wink in ignorance. But once they know,
[40:59] then God requires them to repent.
[41:02] And if they get saved, the Bible said
[41:04] they'll be scarcely saved. They barely
[41:07] got saved. If they continue to cut their
[41:08] hair, yet they'll still pray. As long as
[41:10] they say that repentance at the end,
[41:12] they can be
[41:13] saved. But the Bible says it's a
[41:15] repulse. It's a disgusting thing for a
[41:18] woman to cut her hair or a man to have
[41:20] long uncut hair. And I mean the same for
[41:22] all the men that don't cut their hair. I
[41:24] mean the same harsh preaching on them,
[41:26] too. Hallelujah. You know me, right? By
[41:29] God's grace.
[41:30] Now, this seems reasonable because uh
[41:32] let's have uh Lydia, you got your Bible,
[41:34] get 1 Peter 3:17. This seems reasonable
[41:37] because uh so she ought to have power on
[41:39] her head because of the angels. In other
[41:41] words, uh she should have authority, she
[41:44] should keep the authority in her home so
[41:46] that angels can visit her
[41:49] home. So Lydia, first Peter 3:17, it's
[41:53] true if men don't respect their wives,
[41:55] angels won't hear their prayers. So,
[41:58] it's the same. If a woman don't respect
[41:59] her husband, the angels won't hear their
[42:01] prayers. Hallelujah. So, uh, Lydia, read
[42:06] that. Yeah. Should be
[42:14] 3:17. No, that's I got the wrong one. I
[42:17] got It's first Peter
[42:20] 3. Look, look uh look closer up in the
[42:23] chapter. I might It might be 3:7. might
[42:25] be through. Look, Peter talks about uh
[42:28] how women win their husbands without the
[42:31] word. Women don't preach at their
[42:32] husbands. Women live uh live the
[42:35] husbands a sermon. Did you see it,
[42:37] Lydia? By
[42:40] chance. I have a I must have a
[42:44] typo. It's seven. Yeah, I'm sorry. It's
[42:46] not 17. It's seven. Let me fix in the
[42:49] mercy. I can't fix that one. But yeah,
[42:52] read seven. Seven. It's seven.
[43:04] All right. How many can see that God
[43:07] won't hear a man's prayer if he
[43:08] mistreats his wife?
[43:11] Hallelujah. And so if a woman cuts her
[43:13] hair, you think God's going to hear her
[43:15] prayers?
[43:16] No. Right? Same thing with a man. He
[43:19] grows his hair out. God ain't going to
[43:20] hear his prayers. They're going to be
[43:22] hindered. Right? If it's true for men,
[43:24] it have to be true for women, right?
[43:28] Hallelujah. So, see, she has to have
[43:31] power on her head because of the angels.
[43:33] The angels will respect her prayers if
[43:36] she keeps her hair long.
[43:39] Hallelujah. All right. Glory. So, here's
[43:42] the quotes. Uh, Brother Patrick, these
[43:44] might look
[43:46] familiar. Brother Ram reads the verse
[43:48] and he says, "Any of you reading it?" 1
[43:50] Corinthians 11th chapter, 10th verse. If
[43:51] you notice power why of the angels 1
[43:54] Corinthians because the angels is the
[43:56] man the messenger look it's a little a
[43:59] again where angels are concerned of
[44:00] heavenly angels it's a big a capital A
[44:02] where it's a little a it's men angels
[44:05] and look what he goes on to say and look
[44:07] then the question came back somebody
[44:08] asked me some time ago I'll explain it
[44:10] when I'm at
[44:11] it he says uh I said what's an angel
[44:14] it's a messenger what's Paul saying now
[44:17] this is a different application brother
[44:19] says if a true messenger, an angel from
[44:22] God comes by, you better have long hair.
[44:25] He'll condemn the thing. So, Brother Ram
[44:27] says, basically, a preacher is going to
[44:28] come in and rebuke the women if they
[44:30] don't have long hair. So, that's Brother
[44:32] Ram's application. Now, do both work?
[44:34] Yes. Women ought to have long hair
[44:37] authority on their heads because the
[44:39] angels, the angels are going to rebuke
[44:40] him if they don't, just like they'd
[44:42] rebuke a man with long hair.
[44:45] Okay? So, both work. Okay? Now, I know
[44:49] it's a mysterious thing. Paul does.
[44:51] Didn't didn't Peter say Paul says some
[44:53] hard things to be understood. I can give
[44:56] a hearty amen to that. Some things are
[44:59] hard. He says it again in
[45:03] 1962. He says, "The woman wears long
[45:05] hair because of the angels." What is the
[45:06] angels? The messenger, a true messenger
[45:08] to the church. That's right. He'll
[45:10] always call it down, say, "It's wrong."
[45:12] See, and so forth. And the church to be
[45:14] so yielded to Jesus that it don't claim
[45:16] its own head, its own headship. All
[45:18] right. Nevertheless, neither is the man
[45:21] without the woman. Okay. So now Paul
[45:22] brings the balance. Like I said with my
[45:24] wife, I wasn't made for my wife in one
[45:26] sense, but yet neither uh is the man
[45:29] without the woman. I'm not here except
[45:31] for my mom. And I probably wouldn't be
[45:33] here if it wasn't for my wife either.
[45:36] She's saved my life a couple times from
[45:39] choking. And yeah, choking. Both
[45:41] choking. Choking on food and being
[45:43] choked by demons.
[45:46] Neither the woman without the man in the
[45:48] Lord. So see, we both we both need each
[45:51] other. For as the woman is of the man,
[45:53] even so the man also by the woman, but
[45:55] all things of God. Judge in yourselves,
[45:59] is it calmly or is it fit? Is it proper
[46:01] or seemly that a woman praying to God
[46:04] uncovered? You ever seen a woman pray
[46:06] with cut hair? Does that look like it's
[46:08] right?
[46:10] No. Does not even nature itself teach
[46:12] you that if a man have long hair, it's a
[46:14] shame unto him? Don't look shameful for
[46:16] a man walk around with long hair. But if
[46:18] a woman have long hair, it's a glory to
[46:21] her for her hair is given her for a
[46:23] covering. And Satan hates that verse.
[46:26] Satan hates that verse so much that when
[46:28] I shared it with the sisters and they
[46:30] got the victory, Satan tried to choke me
[46:32] that night and I couldn't breathe and
[46:35] God had to cast out the demons by my
[46:37] wife calling on Jesus. Satan hates that
[46:40] verse. It's the only verse in the Bible
[46:43] that says what a covering is for a
[46:45] woman. And it ain't a cap. It ain't a
[46:47] cloth. It ain't a doily. It's hair.
[46:50] Hallelujah.
[46:52] Glory. Now, nature teaches you because
[46:55] 40% of men lose their
[46:57] hair. We're doing pretty good in here
[46:59] actually with our men here by God's
[47:00] grace. We're in the 60% in here. Glory.
[47:04] Enjoy it, brothers. You never know. Now,
[47:07] notice also, let me go back there. The
[47:09] Bible says also nature also teaches the
[47:13] godhead. See that? Because the sun has
[47:17] gas, light, and heat, right? It has
[47:20] invisible gases, visible light, and
[47:24] heat, but it's still one
[47:27] sun. The water has three forms: solid,
[47:30] liquid, gas, but it's one
[47:32] substance. The human body is body, soul,
[47:35] spirit, and each of you are three
[47:36] persons. Wait, did I say that right? Oh,
[47:39] you're not. Oh, so God's not three
[47:41] persons. Oh, that's
[47:43] right. Eggs have shell, egg white, and
[47:47] yolk. And time has three parts: past,
[47:50] present, and future. It's all time. It's
[47:53] still time.
[47:55] Hallelujah. Well, let's review three for
[47:57] a little bit. How many like this review
[47:59] tonight here? It's been
[48:02] about seven years since I preached this,
[48:04] so it's been a while. Brother Ram said
[48:06] three is the number of
[48:08] life. The seeds rose up out of the earth
[48:12] symbolizing the resurrection on the
[48:13] third day just like Jesus rose on the
[48:16] third day. Hallelujah. The prodigal
[48:19] received three gifts upon his
[48:20] restoration. Robe, ring, and shoes as
[48:23] far as physical gifts. And then his dad
[48:25] said, "You're alive
[48:27] again." I'm talking about physical
[48:29] gifts. Hallelujah.
[48:32] Then he says three is God's perfect
[48:34] number. So we should see threes in
[48:37] divine perfection all over nature. We
[48:40] do. There's three kinds of glory. The
[48:42] Bible says sun, moon,
[48:46] stars. Three is a number of life again.
[48:49] Okay, I got to I got to repeat.
[48:52] Sorry. I got to repeat.
[48:56] Sorry. Okay.
[48:58] Nature. Solids have length, height, and
[49:01] width. Time, past, present, future.
[49:03] Relationships have three points of view.
[49:05] First person, second person, third
[49:06] person. Human capabilities are complete.
[49:09] You have thoughts, words, and deeds.
[49:11] That's all you got. But I'll say like
[49:13] this. That's all you need. The kingdoms
[49:16] of matter are mineral, animal, and
[49:18] vegetable. And there's three kinds of
[49:20] glory. As we already said, babies born
[49:22] in three steps: water, blood, spirit.
[49:25] The wheat plant has stock, tassel,
[49:27] grain, man's being, body, spirit, soul.
[49:29] The earth is purified by the flood,
[49:31] Jesus blood, and fire. There's three
[49:34] earthly witnesses: water, blood, and
[49:36] spirit. There's three races of men from
[49:39] Ham, Shem, and Japheth, the Jew,
[49:41] Gentile,
[49:43] Samaritan. Day three had all these had
[49:46] three things mentioned. Waters, land,
[49:49] and seeds. There's three bodies for
[49:52] believers. I ought to get an amen on
[49:53] this. terrestrial, celestial, and
[49:55] glorified. Hallelujah. Because I've got
[49:58] each one of them somewhere. Hallelujah.
[50:00] I believe it. The Bible said their their
[50:02] faces always behold my father which is
[50:05] in heaven. Hallelujah. And the Bible
[50:08] says if I drop this body here, I go to
[50:10] my eternal house made in the heavens.
[50:13] Hallelujah. Amen. We have an eternal
[50:15] home, church,
[50:17] a theophony body, and then we'll have a
[50:19] glorified body, Lord willing.
[50:22] Hallelujah. And what do I mean? Lord
[50:23] willing, we'll get the glorified if we
[50:25] pass on this veil. And and if our
[50:27] physical bodies dies, Lord willing,
[50:29] we'll come back and get the glorified.
[50:30] If we live to the rapture, we get the
[50:32] glorified before the theophony.
[50:34] Hallelujah.
[50:36] That's right. There's three heavens.
[50:39] There's earth's atmosphere or the
[50:40] clouds, brother says. Then there's a
[50:43] universe or solar system, and then there
[50:45] is God's
[50:49] throne. And then brother, yeah, there's
[50:51] three heavens. the Holy Spirit. Now,
[50:52] that's a different quote. I need to I
[50:54] haven't studied that one out. Brother
[50:55] Ram said there's three Bibles. Now, I
[50:56] just put the video out this week if you
[50:58] saw on Monday. Brother Ram said there's
[51:00] three Bibles, but he says he says this
[51:02] is just an illustration. It's not a
[51:05] doctrine. Let's say not ready. Brother
[51:08] Ram said this is not a doctrine. Brother
[51:10] Ram talks about the pyramid or the
[51:12] zodiac and he said the uh the
[51:14] astrologers have Virgo the virgin, Leo
[51:17] the lion. Brother said, "See, they're
[51:19] copying something from God.
[51:22] He said, 'But that's still not your
[51:24] Bible.' And the church said, I got the
[51:26] quote. It's Paradox 1964. Brother said,
[51:28] I'm not I'm not making a doctrine, but
[51:30] look, the enemy copies these things.
[51:33] Hallelujah. And church, God wrote
[51:36] Jesus's birth in the stars. So much so
[51:40] that the wise men, Hallelujah. So, we
[51:42] can say the gospel, the coming of Jesus
[51:44] Christ was written in the stars. Amen.
[51:48] But he said, don't look up there like
[51:49] you're trying to figure things out.
[51:50] You're going to get in the wrong camp.
[51:53] You're going to get in the camp of
[51:54] demons.
[51:55] Oh, what month is it? Let me check my
[51:57] horoscope. That's demonic.
[52:00] You need to check your future scope in
[52:03] here. Hallelujah. Don't There's no such
[52:06] thing as a horoscope. You check your
[52:07] future scope in here. This tells your
[52:09] future. Praise
[52:11] God. Hallelujah. Then, brother said,
[52:14] that pyramid of Giza, he said, there's
[52:16] seven steps to the king's chamber. Now,
[52:18] I haven't preached on that in years, so
[52:20] maybe I'll do that. It's been years. I
[52:23] don't remember. He said, "But there's a
[52:24] bride chamber and there's a king's
[52:26] chamber." What is all this speaking of?
[52:29] It's speaking of Jesus Christ is the
[52:31] king and the king has a bride. And the
[52:33] church said, "And then it's missing the
[52:37] headstone. It has everything except it's
[52:40] waiting for a headstone to come." And
[52:42] what does Zechariah say? The headstone
[52:44] is coming. It's going to be placed and
[52:46] it's going to be coming with shoutings
[52:48] of grace, grace, not law, law or not my
[52:52] ability or my my righteousness. None of
[52:54] that. It's all coming by grace. In other
[52:57] words, Jesus Christ is coming back for
[52:58] you to cap off the church. Not by your
[53:01] works, but by the grace of God.
[53:03] Hallelujah.
[53:05] And brother said, "Look, it's the
[53:07] zodiac." I'm sorry. He said, "Look, it's
[53:09] Enoch's pyramid." He said, "Still,
[53:11] that's not the Bible."
[53:13] He said, "Your Bible is the
[53:15] absolute." So, don't make the zodiac.
[53:18] And I'm looking at you guys, but I don't
[53:19] mean
[53:20] that. Don't make the zodiac your
[53:22] absolute. I know you never would. Okay?
[53:24] I'm just telling you for those haters
[53:26] that hate on me online. I'm just saying
[53:27] it for their sakes.
[53:29] Okay? Don't make En don't make uh the
[53:31] pyramid of Giza your absolute brother.
[53:33] Mercy, okay? I know you won't. I'm just
[53:36] saying it because of these heathens that
[53:37] always attack me. Now they stopped it
[53:39] because I stopped replying to them and
[53:41] I'm going to keep stopping replying to
[53:43] them. I'm done with
[53:45] them. Unless they repent, then I'll be
[53:48] happy. But see, don't make that your
[53:50] absolute. There's only one absolute.
[53:52] That's the word of God. Hallelujah. I'm
[53:55] trying to finish
[53:57] here. That's the quote. So, see, he
[53:59] talks about
[54:01] that. Now, in the Godhead, there's
[54:03] father, son, holy ghost. Uh the divine
[54:06] record in heaven is father, word, holy
[54:09] ghost. There's three attributes to God.
[54:10] He's all powerful, omnipotent. He's
[54:12] omnipresent everywhere by fornowledge.
[54:15] And he's omnisient, all
[54:17] knowing. There's perfect ceaseless
[54:20] worship in heaven. It goes like this.
[54:21] Holy, holy, holy. That's perfect
[54:26] worship.
[54:27] Hallelujah. All right, back to the
[54:29] chapter. I'm I don't think I'm going to
[54:31] finish the chapter tonight. Okay, I'll
[54:33] just give you a little heads up. Verse
[54:36] 16. But if any man seem to be
[54:38] contentious or argumentative about this,
[54:40] we have no such custom. What? Women
[54:43] cutting their hair or men letting their
[54:44] hair grow long. We have no such custom,
[54:47] neither the churches of God. Now, I'm
[54:50] not an advocate for the NIV or the ESV,
[54:53] but look them up. They say, "We have no
[54:55] other practice, neither do the churches
[54:57] of God." So, at least they I'll say it
[55:00] like this. At least they translated that
[55:01] verse, right? But you know what they do
[55:04] more? They more take away from the
[55:07] Bible. Right. That's what they're really
[55:09] guilty of, taking away from the Bible.
[55:12] So Paul's saying, "Hey, this is how it
[55:14] goes. Woman, man, Christ, God. If a
[55:18] woman cuts her hair a little bit, she
[55:19] might as well shave her head. She's
[55:20] dishonored her husband. If a man grows
[55:22] his hair, uh, he's dishonored Christ."
[55:25] And he said, "If anybody has arguments
[55:27] about it, this is the only practice we
[55:29] do. This is God's order. Praise God.
[55:33] The churches of God. This is our only
[55:36] order. And I'm still waiting for my
[55:38] accusers. And I'm still waiting for my
[55:40] critics. Show me one verse. God asked a
[55:42] woman to cut her hair. A godly woman.
[55:45] You'll never find it. And they say,
[55:47] "Well, we're we're we speak where the
[55:49] Bible speaks and we're silent where the
[55:50] Bible's silent." Bunch of
[55:52] liars. They don't. They say a woman can
[55:56] cut her hair, but the Bible says she's
[55:58] not to cut her hair.
[56:00] Hallelujah. Remember, the Bible will
[56:01] call them liars because if any man adds
[56:04] to the word of God, uh Proverbs 35 and 6
[56:07] says, "Any man that adds, the plagues
[56:08] will be added him." And then the Bible
[56:09] said in Proverbs 30, "Thou shalt call
[56:11] him a liar at the throne of judgment
[56:14] for adding to the word of God." So
[56:17] sisters, wear that crown with spiritual
[56:19] pride. Not not sinful pride, but godly
[56:21] pride. Hallelujah.
[56:24] verse
[56:26] 17 let me
[56:33] see let me just go a little bit further
[56:35] here by God's grace
[56:37] uh I can get a little bit further I
[56:39] think now verse 17 now in this that I
[56:41] declare unto you I praise you not that
[56:43] you come together not for the better but
[56:45] for the worse so look again he says I'm
[56:47] not praising you so this help this helps
[56:50] you understand he said you've honored me
[56:52] you remember me in all things. But then
[56:54] he says, but then he says this, I'm not
[56:56] going to praise you for this. So, see,
[56:58] he was they was he was praising them
[57:00] because they kept the headship in the
[57:01] church and they kept the hair lengths in
[57:03] the
[57:04] church, which I could compliment our
[57:06] church for that too. Wonderful job,
[57:09] church. Let me commend you. Wonderful
[57:11] job with headship in the
[57:16] church. First of all, when you come
[57:18] together in the church, I hear that
[57:20] there be divisions among you, and I
[57:22] partly believe it. Why? Because it was
[57:23] written about in chapter one and chapter
[57:25] two. They had divisions. Well, we like
[57:27] this preacher. Oh, and then the house of
[57:28] Clo reported that this person was
[57:30] against that person. Divisions in the
[57:32] church. It ought not to be so. And I we
[57:35] proved it this year. If people want to
[57:36] cause divisions, they're going to be
[57:38] escorted out.
[57:40] Let's be unified or go find some other
[57:42] place to worship because you're only
[57:44] going to hinder the Holy Ghost if you
[57:46] disagree with the spirit of God.
[57:49] Hallelujah. That's right. That's how we
[57:51] have to live. That's how every church
[57:52] should be. It's always been that way.
[57:55] Hallelujah. Verse 19. For there be also
[57:58] heresies among you. The heresies is a
[58:01] man-made tenant or a man-made doctrine
[58:05] that they which may which are approved
[58:07] may be made manifest among
[58:09] you. Okay? So God allows heresies to
[58:13] rise up in churches in order to prove
[58:16] who's the true believer, who's not a
[58:18] true believer.
[58:22] Hallelujah. And let let's just let's
[58:24] just review. I I got nine nine easy ones
[58:26] to see. Uh I'm sorry. I had eight, but I
[58:29] I meant to put nine. The Bible says
[58:32] there are doctrines of devils. In 1
[58:34] Timothy 4:1, the spirit speaks expressly
[58:37] or exactly that in the latter time some
[58:40] some shall depart from the faith, giving
[58:42] heed to seducing spirits and doctrines
[58:44] of devils.
[58:46] So when people make these doctrines like
[58:48] you got to believe this and this is how
[58:49] we do it, they've actually made a
[58:51] devilish doctrine. The first one is
[58:53] mandatory celibacy. Of course that's
[58:55] mostly the Roman Catholic
[58:57] Church. The second one is you have to be
[58:59] a vegetarian. You can't eat
[59:02] meat, but now it's eat anything and eat
[59:05] all kinds of food even if it ain't
[59:08] food,
[59:11] right? And food easily becomes an idol.
[59:14] And gluttony is of course uh rebuked all
[59:16] down through the Bible, right? Well, I'm
[59:18] sorry. I shouldn't say all down through,
[59:20] but it's rebuked especially in the Old
[59:21] Testament. All through the Old Testament
[59:24] was a better way to say that. I don't
[59:25] think it's mentioned too much in the New
[59:26] Testament as far as my memory. So, it's
[59:29] a devil thing to say you can only eat
[59:32] vegetarian. It's a devil thing to say
[59:34] preachers can't marry. It's a devil
[59:37] doctrine to say the rapture already
[59:39] happened. And did you know there's a
[59:42] false preacher that went into Junction
[59:44] City Church, our Junction City friends,
[59:46] recently and said, "We're living in the
[59:47] millennium and the brother said, "We're
[59:49] not having you back again."
[59:52] Good on Brother Irvin.
[59:54] He wouldn't let that devil come
[59:56] in. Neither will we. Praise God.
[1:00:00] Can you If this is the millennium, my
[1:00:05] goodness, I'm still waiting to do my
[1:00:07] building. If this is the millennium, I
[1:00:08] need to build some houses.
[1:00:11] Hallelujah. I'll wait till that I'll
[1:00:13] wait till that skill comes.
[1:00:16] Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Pretty
[1:00:20] well-known
[1:00:21] one. Yes, that's right. But yeah, it's
[1:00:24] it what is it? It's a seducing spirit.
[1:00:26] Somehow a seducing idea came in there to
[1:00:29] try. Now there usually is related to
[1:00:31] lust that that preacher has some now I
[1:00:34] believe I haven't searched it out but I
[1:00:35] I could search it out by listening to
[1:00:36] the sermons and figure out what they
[1:00:38] gave into. Usually it's money, women or
[1:00:41] popularity. Those are the three things
[1:00:42] that get preachers. Money, women,
[1:00:44] popularity or all three
[1:00:46] sometimes. Brother
[1:00:54] Chris. Wow. Right.
[1:00:58] Good. Yeah. You can go sit down. Good,
[1:01:00] brother. Yes. Good. Yes. That's the
[1:01:02] antichrist. Yes. Paul said, "No, John
[1:01:04] said there's many antichrist already
[1:01:07] going out into the world, and that was
[1:01:09] 2,000 years ago." Good, brother. So,
[1:01:12] anyone says we're in the millennium.
[1:01:13] Anyone the says the rapture already
[1:01:16] happened, that's the devil.
[1:01:19] You know it right away. That's the
[1:01:20] devil. Number
[1:01:23] four, when they say you don't have to
[1:01:25] fast,
[1:01:27] uh, that's of the devil. Hallelujah.
[1:01:31] Right? And that's that's one thing we
[1:01:32] had we had some really good church
[1:01:33] members for a while, but that's the one
[1:01:35] thing they never could get the victory
[1:01:36] of. And and they knew they were
[1:01:38] condemned on that. And that's why they
[1:01:39] that's one reason they stopped coming to
[1:01:42] church because they they wouldn't fast.
[1:01:45] And it and it and it I mean that was
[1:01:46] just that was just the fruit of all
[1:01:48] these other sins that was in their
[1:01:51] life. Bad parenting, uh worldliness,
[1:01:55] loving sports, loving the world,
[1:01:57] watching sports instead of coming to
[1:01:58] church, not coming to church uh because
[1:02:01] a family's in town. That's the time you
[1:02:03] need to come to church is when your
[1:02:04] family's in in town. You need to show
[1:02:07] them who's your God. Hallelujah. Jesus
[1:02:09] is your God. Hallelujah.
[1:02:16] Number five, turning grace into
[1:02:18] lasciviousness. Almost every mega
[1:02:20] preacher does this, right? Especially
[1:02:22] Joe Ostein. He don't even preach on
[1:02:24] homosexual. I don't preach. He never
[1:02:26] even mentions sins from the
[1:02:29] pulpit. Uh it's the same thing. Once
[1:02:31] saved, always save her. Everyone will go
[1:02:33] to heaven. Universalism. That's of the
[1:02:36] devil. God always wants you healthy and
[1:02:38] wealthy. That's from the devil. Now,
[1:02:41] does God want to heal the majority of
[1:02:42] time? It looks like it is for most
[1:02:45] people. But what about the people that
[1:02:46] don't get healed? Like people in
[1:02:48] wheelchairs, paralyzed people. What
[1:02:50] about them? See, God doesn't always want
[1:02:53] to heal the physical body, but he always
[1:02:55] wants to heal the soul if the person's
[1:02:57] willing.
[1:02:59] Yes.
[1:03:01] Yes. But it's a doctrine of a devil to
[1:03:03] say God always wants to heal. In every
[1:03:06] case, that's the devil.
[1:03:10] presuming, now this is mine because I
[1:03:12] got scripture for it. They're arguing
[1:03:13] who is the greatest. Presuming and
[1:03:15] exalting Brother Brandham and his
[1:03:17] followers and even message believers
[1:03:18] today are the greatest of all time. I
[1:03:21] believe that's a doctrine of a
[1:03:23] devil because people are exalting
[1:03:25] themselves. Don't ever talk about how
[1:03:27] good you are, church.
[1:03:30] And if you're honest, you wouldn't have
[1:03:31] much to say if you did start doing it.
[1:03:33] Amen. Where'd you get that power?
[1:03:35] Where'd you get that ability anyway? You
[1:03:37] just wake up with one someday said,
[1:03:39] "Well, I'm gonna I'm really going to do
[1:03:41] something good today. I think I think I
[1:03:42] think I I think I can do
[1:03:44] it." My goodness, church, we have
[1:03:47] nothing to brag on. The B I love it.
[1:03:48] Paul says, "I got one thing to boast on.
[1:03:50] I can boast on Jesus Christ."
[1:03:52] Hallelujah. Jesus came to save me and
[1:03:54] forgive me my sins. Jesus pulled me out
[1:03:57] of the miry clay. Hallelujah. He set my
[1:04:00] feet on the rock to stay. Hallelujah.
[1:04:05] And then when they say rapturing faith
[1:04:07] is literally on the tape. So that means
[1:04:10] rapturing faith is on my phone because I
[1:04:11] got all the tapes on my phone. My
[1:04:13] phone's going to be
[1:04:14] raptured. See? See what See what they
[1:04:16] lie. See what they lie. That's their
[1:04:18] lying. They still do it today. It's It
[1:04:19] just got worse. It's just got worse. I'm
[1:04:22] going to make a video on it pretty soon,
[1:04:23] Lord
[1:04:27] willing. I can't I can't sit still. I I
[1:04:29] can't stay quiet. I got to I got to
[1:04:31] rebuke it. If God gave me a platform to
[1:04:33] do it, I'm going to do it by God's
[1:04:34] grace. And the last thing, they make a
[1:04:36] tradition out of Brother Ram's life. In
[1:04:39] other words, Brother Ram watched, I
[1:04:40] think, two or three movies and so, oh, I
[1:04:42] can watch every movie I want. No, you
[1:04:44] can't. That's a devil telling you that.
[1:04:48] The Bible says, "I will set no wicked
[1:04:52] thing." And even if Brother Ram did
[1:04:54] watch it and there was some bad content,
[1:04:56] how do we know he didn't turn his head?
[1:04:58] How do we know he didn't repent if he
[1:05:00] did see it?
[1:05:01] We know he would have repented because
[1:05:03] he was a Holy Ghost filled
[1:05:05] Christian. Hallelujah. But you know
[1:05:07] what? They did the same thing to Moses,
[1:05:09] right? The Pharisees. Jesus said, "Don't
[1:05:12] think that I'm going to accuse you.
[1:05:13] There's one that accused you, even Moses
[1:05:15] in whom you trust." Think of that. Moses
[1:05:17] is going to come up and accuse all these
[1:05:19] Pharisees and Sadducees because they
[1:05:21] said they believe Moses, but Moses wrote
[1:05:23] to Jesus.
[1:05:25] That means brother Brandham is going to
[1:05:26] accuse a lot of people that said they
[1:05:28] believe he was a prophet of God because
[1:05:30] they disobeyed God's
[1:05:31] word. That's
[1:05:34] right. Had you believed Moses, you would
[1:05:36] have believed me for he wrote in
[1:05:38] me. But if you believe not his writings,
[1:05:41] how should you believe my words? And
[1:05:42] that's where brother said
[1:05:45] it. He said like the prophets prophets
[1:05:48] come. What do they do to the prophets?
[1:05:49] God sent the prophet and you kill him,
[1:05:50] put him in a tomb. Exactly. And then
[1:05:52] about another generation, you wake up
[1:05:53] and realize that was a prophet. And what
[1:05:55] do you do? You garnish his tomb. What do
[1:05:57] you do? Make a tradition out of his
[1:05:59] life. Now, I just said we follow we we
[1:06:01] use stories from Brother Am's life. We
[1:06:04] do. We use Paul's life. We use Peter's
[1:06:07] life. We use John's
[1:06:08] life. We can use all these men's life.
[1:06:11] But we don't make a tradition out of it
[1:06:13] where I have to do everything they did.
[1:06:16] Oh, because brother made a mistake to
[1:06:17] the IRS. Well, I can make a I can lie to
[1:06:19] the IRS because he did. That's making a
[1:06:21] tradition out of his life, right?
[1:06:23] Because brother Ram uh catered to his
[1:06:25] mother-in-law. Well, I can I can
[1:06:27] compromise to my mother-in-law because
[1:06:28] brother Ram did. Now you've just sinned
[1:06:30] and made a you made a tradition out of
[1:06:31] his life. We don't have any license to
[1:06:34] sin. That's one of the other doctrines
[1:06:35] of a devil's. You turn grace into a
[1:06:38] shibiousness. Praise God. Amen.
[1:06:45] Hallelujah. And I'm almost done here.
[1:06:47] Let let me finish this section.
[1:06:50] Yes, the heresies prove who is the true
[1:06:53] believer. That's why when these false
[1:06:55] doctrines rise up, it's actually we
[1:06:56] shouldn't get discouraged. We should
[1:06:57] actually say, "Well, praise the Lord.
[1:06:59] We're going to find out who's the
[1:07:01] bride." We're going to find out because
[1:07:04] that's what false doctrines do. They
[1:07:06] show who's a true believer, who's the
[1:07:07] who's a false
[1:07:09] believer. Hallelujah. And even as I was
[1:07:12] falsely accused this year of uh of uh I
[1:07:16] was accused of the scripture about
[1:07:18] Nathan and David has nothing to do with
[1:07:20] with anything that I was accused of.
[1:07:23] That's a false AC application of a
[1:07:26] scripture. That's a heresy to use that
[1:07:28] for song leading when it's not song
[1:07:30] leading. It's adultery.
[1:07:34] That's right. Hallelujah. And the church
[1:07:36] knows God gives us witnesses.
[1:07:39] Hallelujah. like through brother
[1:07:40] McBride. Hallelujah.
[1:07:43] See now we want everyone to repent. I
[1:07:45] would accept any repentance. I you would
[1:07:48] accept it. I we love we want everybody
[1:07:50] to repent. But we got to stand when the
[1:07:52] when the test comes. You got brother say
[1:07:54] you got to pass the word test.
[1:07:56] Hallelujah. Take everything back to the
[1:07:58] word. The true believers will stand upon
[1:08:00] the true revelation of God's true word.
[1:08:03] Hallelujah.
[1:08:05] That's right.
[1:08:07] See, heresies manifest who is who among
[1:08:10] us. When you come together therefore
[1:08:12] into this place, this is not to eat the
[1:08:15] Lord's supper. He says verse 20, for in
[1:08:18] eating everyone taketh before another
[1:08:20] his own supper, and one is hungry,
[1:08:22] another is drunken. Look how they come
[1:08:24] to communion. You got people that are so
[1:08:26] poor they're so hungry. You got other
[1:08:28] people that are drunk. So you got people
[1:08:30] that are like starving their stomachers.
[1:08:33] Yeah, I really want to take communion.
[1:08:34] You got people sloshing around because
[1:08:36] they're drunk. What a disgrace to the
[1:08:38] name of Jesus Christ. That's this kind
[1:08:40] of church. And yet they had their hair
[1:08:42] length right,
[1:08:43] church. What? What? Doesn't matter if
[1:08:46] your hair is right. If you get drunk, it
[1:08:48] don't matter. Hallelujah. The Bible said
[1:08:51] God wants us to live by every word that
[1:08:53] proceeds out of the mouth of God.
[1:08:55] Hallelujah.
[1:09:00] All right, we're going to last verse 22.
[1:09:02] What? Have you not houses to eat or
[1:09:04] drink in or despise you the church of
[1:09:06] God? Why would you come to church like
[1:09:07] that? He says, "You're bringing a
[1:09:10] reproach upon the church of the living
[1:09:13] God." And he says, "Why would you
[1:09:15] despise?" See, when people sin publicly
[1:09:17] like that, it shows they despise the
[1:09:20] word of God. It's just like the Bible
[1:09:21] said about David. When David committed
[1:09:22] adultery, the Bible said he, Nathan
[1:09:24] said, "Why did you despise the command
[1:09:26] of God?"
[1:09:27] See, in order to sin something like
[1:09:29] that, you have to despise the truth in
[1:09:31] order to do evil. Everybody with me now.
[1:09:35] Yes, it could be a complex. Yes. But
[1:09:37] it's definitely a devil oppressing
[1:09:40] someone's human spirit. And that
[1:09:42] person's human spirit is not right with
[1:09:45] God. It's oppressed by an evil spirit.
[1:09:47] They're caught in a snare. And the
[1:09:49] church
[1:09:50] said, "That's right. And it brings
[1:09:53] shame." He says, "And shame that have
[1:09:55] not." So why do these drunk people shame
[1:09:57] the poor
[1:09:58] people? What shall I say to you? Shall I
[1:10:01] praise you for this? I praise you
[1:10:04] not. So see there's a time you can
[1:10:07] praise people on this but then if they
[1:10:09] do public things you said I I no I don't
[1:10:11] praise you on this. I I shame you for
[1:10:13] this. And the church said well that's a
[1:10:16] nice way to end the sermon. Let's raise
[1:10:17] our hand. Let's stand here. Let's stand.
[1:10:20] Musicians can come.
[1:10:24] See, the thing is people people don't
[1:10:26] even really know what's in the Bible.
[1:10:27] Sometimes their sermons are so
[1:10:31] uh so missing the Bible, they don't even
[1:10:33] know what's written in here. Sometimes
[1:10:36] they just tell you Jesus loves you. God
[1:10:37] loves you. God wants to heal you. God
[1:10:38] wants to forgive. He's a supernatural
[1:10:40] God. Yes, he is. He can do miracles.
[1:10:42] Yes, he's a miracle worker, promise
[1:10:43] keeper, light in the darkness. He's all
[1:10:44] that. But once once once we have that,
[1:10:46] once we've been blessed, now what else
[1:10:48] does it say?
[1:10:50] Are we living our life in a way that
[1:10:52] honors the Lord Jesus Christ?
[1:10:54] Hallelujah.
[1:10:57] Let's bow our heads here tonight by the
[1:10:59] grace of the
[1:11:05] Lord. Praise God. I would like, you
[1:11:08] know, since we have uh this is one of
[1:11:09] those special nights. We have a lot of
[1:11:10] men here tonight by God's grace. I think
[1:11:12] last Sunday we or last Wednesday, we
[1:11:14] hardly had any brothers here, right?
[1:11:15] It's just a special night to have some
[1:11:17] brothers here. I want to have a special
[1:11:19] prayer for the brothers in a moment. I'm
[1:11:20] going to invite you all up and we'll
[1:11:21] pray for each other that God will make
[1:11:23] us real
[1:11:25] leaders. I need God's I need your
[1:11:27] prayers, church. I need the prayers of
[1:11:28] the brothers. I want to be a better
[1:11:31] leader. And then the sisters will come
[1:11:33] up and the sisters can pray for each
[1:11:35] other as well that they'll be
[1:11:39] submissive. Think about that, church. On
[1:11:42] the day of judgment, I have to answer,
[1:11:45] did I lead these brothers the right way?
[1:11:49] I have to I have to stand before the
[1:11:51] Lord Jesus. I Ben came in here and he
[1:11:53] stood right before it Lord and he had a
[1:11:54] talk with the Lord on Sunday. That was
[1:11:57] very symbolic. That's what we're all
[1:11:58] going to do. I'm going to stand here
[1:11:59] like this maybe with my head down and
[1:12:03] he's going to the Lord's going to ask me
[1:12:04] what did you do as a
[1:12:07] leader and I want to say I preached what
[1:12:10] Paul
[1:12:12] preached. I didn't compromise on the
[1:12:14] word of God.
[1:12:17] when heresies rose up, when thing when
[1:12:19] questions rode up, my my my desire was
[1:12:21] to point the people back to the word of
[1:12:23] God. And when I went home, I tried to
[1:12:26] love my wife and children like Christ
[1:12:29] loved the
[1:12:31] church. And I tried to give my
[1:12:34] life. I tried to sacrifice some of my
[1:12:37] time for my wife and my children to show
[1:12:39] them how much I love them. Praise God.
[1:12:42] No, I'm not perfect, but I need your
[1:12:44] prayers.
[1:12:45] Hallelujah. And I want to pray for my
[1:12:47] brethren, too. Let's have a word of
[1:12:50] prayer here before we invite the
[1:12:51] brothers up. Father God, we thank you
[1:12:53] for tonight,
[1:12:57] [Music]
[1:13:00] Lord. Lord, I'm so thankful to see these
[1:13:02] brethren here tonight,
[1:13:04] Lord. And I understand they work a lot,
[1:13:06] Lord. I understand
[1:13:09] it. All of us have schedules, Lord
[1:13:13] God. But I thought, how fitting, Lord,
[1:13:16] now as the Holy Spirit
[1:13:17] hears bringing this down to a close, how
[1:13:20] fitting we can have all these brethren
[1:13:22] here, Lord God. Lord, if you Terry,
[1:13:24] these young men are going to raise up
[1:13:26] and be husbands and
[1:13:28] fathers and they will lead a
[1:13:35] home and then they will answer because
[1:13:38] they're in the image of God. Hallelujah.
[1:13:42] Lord
[1:13:44] God, help me to be like Christ to my
[1:13:49] wife. Help me to be like God to my
[1:13:52] children.
[1:13:53] Lord, help me to be like you, Lord
[1:13:55] Jesus. I'm not all the time. I know
[1:13:58] that I need your grace, Lord
[1:14:03] God. How I need it, Lord Jesus. Every
[1:14:08] day, every
[1:14:11] [Music]
[1:14:14] hour, Lord. And I recognize I have to
[1:14:17] stand before the Lord Jesus. Lord, I
[1:14:20] have to stand before you and
[1:14:23] answer. How did I lead the the church?
[1:14:27] How did I lead my family, my
[1:14:33] sons? Oh
[1:14:35] God, may I honor you above all things,
[1:14:38] Lord
[1:14:41] God. Lord, before we pray, forgive us of
[1:14:44] any sins, Lord God. forgive us of any
[1:14:47] unrighteousness, any iniquity. Thank you
[1:14:50] that you forgive all of our
[1:14:55] iniquity, Lord
[1:14:57] Jesus.
[1:15:01] Hallelujah. Forgive us of our sins, Lord
[1:15:04] God, especially our brethren. Make us
[1:15:06] real leaders, Lord God.
[1:15:08] Give us a backbone for the word of
[1:15:12] God, Lord. When heresies rise up, give
[1:15:15] us strength to stand upon the word. As I
[1:15:18] was telling brother Austin, I think last
[1:15:21] week, the Lord anointed him so much to
[1:15:24] discern a situation
[1:15:27] perfectly. And I I recognized I said
[1:15:29] that's the Holy
[1:15:33] Ghost able to discern between good and
[1:15:36] evil.
[1:15:40] [Music]
[1:15:42] Thank you Lord Jesus for your mercy and
[1:15:45] [Music]
[1:15:49] grace. Lord we want to lead like you
[1:15:51] because we are in your image Lord
[1:15:54] God. Oh God we need your help. Our
[1:15:58] sisters need help. Lord, we first want
[1:15:59] to pray for the
