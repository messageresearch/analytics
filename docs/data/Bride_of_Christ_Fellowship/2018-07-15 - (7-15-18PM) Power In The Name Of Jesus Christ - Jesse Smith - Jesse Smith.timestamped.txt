[25:39] amen let's take our Bibles tonight by
[25:41] God's Grace's were standard Matthew
[25:43] 28:19 then we'll read acts 2:38 well
[25:54] there's nothing like fall more in love
[25:55] with Jesus is there well go to Matthew
[26:01] 28:19 and then we'll go to acts 2:38 so
[26:05] we read two scriptures tonight by the
[26:07] grace of the Lord like I said like last
[26:09] week I'll try to preach just 45 minutes
[26:11] the first week I preached an hour and 15
[26:12] I preached 45 minutes last week I try to
[26:15] preach 45 tonight by God's grace so
[26:20] praise the Lord God is so good to us
[26:24] according to our schedule appreciate our
[26:27] visitors coming but our schedule says
[26:28] we're gonna preach on the power of Jesus
[26:31] Christ's name tonight so we're gonna
[26:33] preach on that but I want to ask
[26:34] everybody even our visitors there come a
[26:37] time where I'll stop the service I'll
[26:39] stop preaching a little bit and I'll let
[26:41] everybody testify of the times that
[26:42] you've spoken in the name of Jesus
[26:45] Christ and God has done something
[26:46] because I think that would raise all of
[26:47] our faith I mean we think that raise
[26:49] your faith I want to do that too and
[26:51] especially for our visitors that maybe
[26:53] they don't know us but if they can feel
[26:56] the power of our testimonies you know I
[26:58] thought that might be a blessing to them
[26:59] where you've just spoken the name of
[27:01] Jesus and something happened we just
[27:04] love the name of Jesus amen
[27:06] Matthew 28:19 let's read that together
[27:15] on three one two three go ye therefore
[27:18] and teach all nations baptizing them in
[27:23] the name of the Father and of the Son
[27:25] and of the Holy Ghost now let's turn to
[27:27] acts 2:38 know the acts 2:38 is 10 days
[27:31] after Matthew 28:19 and I want to just
[27:39] read the scripture because it's so
[27:41] important to understanding the power in
[27:43] the literal name of Jesus Christ
[27:46] that's you 28:19 so jesus said baptize
[27:53] in the name there's one name to the
[27:55] Father Son Holy Ghost Peter gets filled
[27:57] with the Holy Ghost and a few moments
[27:59] later he says baptize in the name of
[28:01] Jesus Christ so that tells us the name
[28:05] of the Father Son Holy Ghost is Jesus
[28:08] Christ how many understand that that
[28:10] might be new to course to our visitors
[28:12] or maybe new to somebody livestream they
[28:13] also have visitors on the livestream as
[28:15] well by God's grace so that's new to you
[28:18] that that'd be a powerful revelation in
[28:20] your life to know that there's one name
[28:22] to God and that name is Jesus Christ
[28:25] acts 2:38 let's read that on three one
[28:28] two three then Peter said unto them
[28:32] repent and be baptized every one of you
[28:35] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[28:38] remission of sins and ye shall receive
[28:40] the gift of the Holy Ghost amen let's
[28:44] bow our heads for one more word of
[28:45] Prayer you know in your heart just
[28:46] making on to God you could raise your
[28:48] hand or you can just talk to God in your
[28:50] heart Father in Heaven we love you
[28:51] tonight
[28:52] we love your name we love your glory
[28:55] your spirit we love your word we love
[28:57] everything about you Lord as we look at
[28:59] the power
[29:00] your name tonight I just pray God you'd
[29:01] let it be a blessing to your people here
[29:03] God just guide me by your spirit I'm I'm
[29:06] just trying to follow Lord your bloody
[29:09] footprints dear God I'm just trying to
[29:10] follow you tonight oh god I prepared
[29:12] notes but father just take control here
[29:15] tonight and that your spirit have
[29:16] complete preeminence bless Carol
[29:18] Lord bless Alice bless those
[29:21] livestreaming bless our regular saints
[29:23] that come and fellowship with us and
[29:25] father may your spirit direct this word
[29:28] to every heart for your glory in Jesus
[29:31] Christ's name
[29:31] nobody said amen god bless you zoom in
[29:34] and see the praise God
[29:39] okay so Malachi you can switch over when
[29:41] you're ready buddy thank you sir well
[29:47] you know I was uh I was at lunch there
[29:49] today and one of the workers came over
[29:50] and was having a baby shower or
[29:52] something like that like a birthday
[29:54] party and so she took me in there and
[29:58] there's all these people that want to
[30:00] know about what I believe and what I
[30:01] preach I got to testify the whole time
[30:04] and they're like do you have any cards
[30:06] and the last two Sundays because we've
[30:08] kept all these cards in my pocket
[30:09] today's the only day I didn't bring them
[30:11] but I had one card left so I said here
[30:13] take a picture of it so they all took a
[30:15] picture of it on their phone but
[30:16] hopefully they'll get to me but you know
[30:18] but God has a sense of humor I had these
[30:19] in my pockets last Sunday I'm like
[30:21] itching to pass them out today I forget
[30:23] to take them that's the day I need cards
[30:25] so God has a sense of humor that's all I
[30:28] can say God knows I want to pass them
[30:31] out desperately I got one of people to
[30:33] hear the word of God but I got to
[30:35] testify and they said it's so great to
[30:37] see and then the woman started
[30:38] testifying about all of you she said you
[30:40] should see this church when they come in
[30:41] and the children how they're so well
[30:43] behaved and how they talk to each other
[30:45] and she was just bragging on Jesus and I
[30:48] said well if there's any credit to our
[30:49] family it's nothing we did it's all
[30:51] Jesus you know so it was just really
[30:54] encouraging that had a little time to
[30:55] witness between service so that's why I
[30:57] disappeared I was making new friends as
[30:59] my wife said well let me set a time here
[31:01] so I don't wear wear you out and wear
[31:03] myself out here so we like to look at
[31:08] the scripture of this thought tonight
[31:10] the power in Jesus Christ's name and we
[31:13] sent out to
[31:13] thousand five hundred of these and they
[31:16] said usually you get one percent of
[31:18] people that will come to your church so
[31:20] that would be twenty five people will
[31:21] come to our church but we don't know 25
[31:23] yet but we had to come so let's give our
[31:25] to around the flaws they've had so a
[31:27] very your special group your select
[31:31] group you know so we're just grateful
[31:37] that you could come and God bless you
[31:38] both for coming you know it's just been
[31:41] wonderful to have people here that
[31:43] perhaps are hearing it for the first
[31:43] time that's all we want we just want
[31:45] people to hear these things that are in
[31:47] God's Word perhaps for the first time or
[31:49] maybe renew them maybe they haven't
[31:51] heard them for a while and come to know
[31:53] Jesus Christ better by God's grace we
[31:56] just wanted to everybody how much we
[31:57] love the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[31:59] and we love his word we can't you can't
[32:00] love Jesus without loving his word and
[32:03] we love his word so let's look tonight
[32:04] at this little thought on the power in
[32:07] Jesus name so if you have a in a minute
[32:10] here as I get started if you have a
[32:12] little testimony about a time you've
[32:13] spoken the name of Jesus
[32:15] and God has it God has done something we
[32:18] like to hear that in just a few minutes
[32:19] I'll try to I said it for half an hour's
[32:21] that would remind me to ask everybody to
[32:22] share their their testimonies so welcome
[32:25] you're welcome to be here thank you so
[32:27] much for coming by the grace of God
[32:29] Carol did you get a chance to watch last
[32:32] week's perhaps on our website or
[32:34] anything okay
[32:35] so just as a if you're wondering about
[32:37] this picture do you know who that man is
[32:39] okay he lived from 1909 to 1965 his name
[32:45] was William Branham and he was a prophet
[32:46] from America and he traveled all around
[32:49] the world seven times and his gift was
[32:51] so amazing that he would go in prayer
[32:54] lines and he would tell people their
[32:56] names their addresses and people get
[32:58] healed and I'd met a couple I've met a
[33:00] couple that were actually in his prayer
[33:01] line and got healed and so it was a
[33:03] reality and it was it was God showing a
[33:06] sign before Jesus returns because jesus
[33:10] said that jesus said he was going to
[33:11] send another prophetic sign before the
[33:14] end time so he died in 1965 but his
[33:17] message lives on and his message was
[33:19] basically restoring the same truce that
[33:22] the Apostles taught in the Bible so it's
[33:25] glorious you know it is in other words
[33:27] the
[33:27] becomes a new Bible and our faith gets
[33:31] transformed into the original faith of
[33:34] the Apostolic fathers and so one example
[33:37] was a share last week when I went to
[33:38] Guyana in South America I asked a demon
[33:42] out of a woman and the same thing that
[33:45] happened to her was what the same thing
[33:47] that Jesus did in the Bible when he
[33:48] casted out demons the person screamed
[33:51] like they were gonna die you know they
[33:53] fell down like they were sleeping and
[33:55] then they woke up and they were fine
[33:56] after that and so the the message that
[34:00] he preached was pointing here and then
[34:02] when I preached this I saw the same
[34:04] things happen in the Bible so it's just
[34:06] it's vindication that this is a Bible
[34:09] message we're just trying to fall more
[34:11] in love with Jesus and his Bible so I
[34:14] hope that helps you just so yeah glory
[34:18] be to you that's all were here for
[34:19] that's beautiful
[34:21] we're just here to fall more in love
[34:22] with Christ and you know I was raised in
[34:24] a good church a good Pentecostal church
[34:26] but I ran from God for all those years
[34:29] till I was 19 I finally surrendered I
[34:31] started preaching when I was would have
[34:34] been 23 started pastoring at 25 and I've
[34:39] been pastoring ever since I'm 37 now so
[34:40] been pastoring twelve years by God's
[34:42] grace so we're very thankful for God's
[34:45] love and His mercy you know if there's
[34:46] anything good about us it's all Jesus so
[34:49] that's where that picture comes from by
[34:50] the way and and God took a picture
[34:52] that's the pillar of fire there and I
[34:54] that's actually a picture of the pillar
[34:56] of fire the the people and brother man's
[34:59] ministry sent that picture to an
[35:00] examiner of photographs and he examined
[35:03] - his name was George J Lacey and he
[35:05] sent back a certified document saying it
[35:07] was actually a picture of God light
[35:10] struck the lens and that was in 1950
[35:13] yeah so God is in other words God has
[35:15] given him lots of indication but the
[35:18] main vindication is God's pure Word of
[35:20] God yeah so just if you're wondering
[35:23] what was on that postcard that was on
[35:25] the postcard there they got that ugly
[35:27] guy on the back with that with that big
[35:29] smile that kool-aid smile on the back so
[35:32] that's our topic for tonight the power
[35:34] in the name of Jesus Christ so we'll
[35:38] look at a few thoughts here on the power
[35:40] in the name of Jesus cry
[35:41] first of all Jesus Christ is the
[35:44] greatest name in the universe there
[35:47] there's no greater name in the universe
[35:49] than Jesus and sadly that's why people
[35:52] use it as a curse word because there's
[35:54] actually power and they're they're
[35:56] bringing they're trying to curse other
[35:57] people it's because there's power and
[36:00] authority in that name but they don't
[36:01] have the authority to curse in that in
[36:03] that name they shouldn't do that but the
[36:06] Bible says God hath given Jesus or have
[36:10] highly exalted him and given him a name
[36:12] which is above every name that at the
[36:15] name of Jesus every knee should bow of
[36:17] things in heaven and things in earth and
[36:19] things under the earth which would be of
[36:22] course hell right under the earth so the
[36:26] name of Jesus Christ is the greatest
[36:29] name there could ever be according to
[36:30] the scripture and Jesus Christ is the
[36:34] only name you can be saved in because
[36:38] the Bible says this Peter said be it
[36:40] known unto you all and to all the people
[36:41] of Israel that by the name of Jesus
[36:44] Christ of Nazareth whom you crucified
[36:46] God hath raised from the dead even by
[36:49] him doth this man stand before you hole
[36:50] neither is there salvation in any other
[36:53] for there's none other name under heaven
[36:56] given among men whereby we must be saved
[36:58] it is the only name that people can be
[37:01] saved in now people ask me all the time
[37:03] can Muslims be saved or Buddhists be
[37:05] saved the only way they can be saved is
[37:07] if they're kind to a Christian because
[37:09] jesus said in Matthew 25 he's gonna save
[37:13] some people and they're gonna say when
[37:14] did we when did we feed you Jesus when
[37:16] did we visit you in prison and Jesus
[37:18] gonna say when you did it to the least
[37:20] of these my brethren you've did it unto
[37:22] me
[37:23] that's the only way a Muslim or Buddhist
[37:26] or anyone outside of the faith that's
[37:28] the only way they can be saved as
[37:29] they're kind to a Christian but doesn't
[37:32] that show how merciful God is that God
[37:35] will save someone just for being kind to
[37:36] one of his brothers one of his sisters
[37:38] oh that's that's the grace of God amen
[37:41] so it's true they're only saved through
[37:44] Jesus Christ
[37:46] there's only salvation through Jesus
[37:48] Christ because Jesus said I am the way I
[37:53] am the truth of life no
[37:55] man comes to the Father but by me that's
[37:58] the only way they'll come to God is
[38:00] through Jesus Christ also some people
[38:04] might not be aware of this but the whole
[38:05] family in heaven and earth is named the
[38:09] Lord Jesus Christ that's our family name
[38:12] in the name of Jesus Christ the Bible
[38:15] says this for this cause I bow my knees
[38:17] under the father of our Lord Jesus
[38:18] Christ of whom the whole family in
[38:21] heaven and earth is named amen there's
[38:24] no other height you know my last name is
[38:26] Smith but eventually I want to put away
[38:28] that name and in heaven I just want to
[38:30] be known by mrs. Jesus Christ just let
[38:33] me be called his part of his family amen
[38:36] that's all I want that's really all that
[38:38] matters is that we're a child of God and
[38:40] we course we love our natural family but
[38:43] that's the name we want to be a part of
[38:45] that's the family we want to be a part
[38:46] of is Jesus Christ family and the name
[38:49] is Jesus next then and just so you have
[38:55] if you have a testimony a minute I'd
[38:56] like you to share here I will probably
[38:57] too a lot sooner than I thought here the
[38:59] name of Jesus Christ has power over
[39:02] every evil every single evil you can
[39:05] think of because jesus said he told his
[39:08] disciples before he left before he went
[39:10] ascended to heaven he said in these
[39:12] signs shall follow them that believe in
[39:14] my name shall they cast out devils and
[39:17] I've done that by God's grace I've seen
[39:19] that about six times six or seven times
[39:21] they shall speak with new tongues raise
[39:23] your hands anyone spoken in tongues in
[39:24] here before Oh wonderful wonderful
[39:26] numerous people praise the Lord I never
[39:28] have but I know a lot of people who have
[39:32] they shall take up serpents and if they
[39:35] drink any deadly it shall not hurt them
[39:37] as anyone notice anyone know anybody
[39:40] that's been bitten by a snake and then
[39:41] they spoke the name of Jesus and got
[39:43] healed
[39:43] I don't know anybody personally I've
[39:45] heard stories about it in missionary
[39:47] books that children have read about it
[39:48] but I've never personally met anybody
[39:51] and they shall lay hands on the sick and
[39:53] they shall recover who's never laid
[39:55] their hands on the sick and they got
[39:56] better by God's grace than that amen
[39:58] praise God
[39:59] so that's glorious laying hands on the
[40:01] sick in the name of Jesus praise God so
[40:05] all things are overcome by the name
[40:09] of the Lord Jesus Christ in the book of
[40:14] Acts a demon was cast out and Paul
[40:17] Paul's the one who cast her out or hit
[40:19] the the demon out of her rather Paul was
[40:21] being grieved he turned and said to that
[40:23] spirit I command thee in the name of
[40:25] Jesus Christ to come out of her and he
[40:27] came out the same hour so this is what
[40:30] we want to preach on that's we want
[40:31] everyone to know who's listening or hear
[40:33] there's power in speaking the literal
[40:36] name of Jesus Christ there's power in
[40:39] that name so much so that Devils will
[40:42] leave if you have enough faith now of
[40:45] course we know there's conditions to
[40:46] like the person has to have sincere
[40:49] repent and heart if they're being
[40:51] possessed by demon they've got to want
[40:53] to be delivered right because you can't
[40:55] force anybody to be free they've got to
[40:57] want to be free so there are conditions
[41:00] that have to be met but if that person
[41:02] wants to be delivered confess their sins
[41:04] and they call upon the name of Jesus
[41:07] Christ Jesus Christ said he would
[41:09] deliver them amen
[41:10] because every every demon must bow at
[41:13] the name of Jesus Christ as well
[41:15] hallelujah
[41:16] now also miracles are done in the name
[41:21] of Jesus Christ this is an axe chapter 3
[41:24] when Peter saw a crippled man and Peter
[41:28] said silver and gold have I none but
[41:29] such as I have I give IV in the name of
[41:32] Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and
[41:34] walk now Carol my brother's right there
[41:37] Simon you raise your hand he preached
[41:39] this morning he did a wonderful job this
[41:40] morning he preached this morning at his
[41:42] church there was a man who came up and I
[41:44] was there there's a man who came up to
[41:46] the the altar and he was in a cane
[41:48] brother Philip he's a veteran and he
[41:51] could even walk upstairs we prayed for
[41:53] him in the name of Jesus Christ the
[41:55] brothers prayed for him the name of
[41:56] Jesus Christ the next week he came back
[41:58] to church he didn't have a cane he was
[42:01] walking upstairs he was carrying couches
[42:02] helping people move upstairs he doesn't
[42:05] have a cane to this day so that's the
[42:09] power of our Lord Jesus Christ
[42:11] he hardly walk and then God takes away
[42:14] the cane God restores him so we know
[42:17] Jesus is alive and well he's the same
[42:19] yesterday today and forever amen
[42:21] that's right
[42:25] now before this one let's take a moment
[42:28] and testify here if you'd like to you
[42:31] don't have to I'll share a couple of
[42:33] ones that I've seen about the name of
[42:36] Jesus Christ just so scarole and you
[42:39] know Alice I don't know how much they
[42:40] you know they've experienced but one
[42:44] time I was praying for a woman who
[42:46] couldn't have children and it was three
[42:48] years they were praying for kids and you
[42:51] know she had given up and I was just out
[42:54] and I was just at my house away from her
[42:56] praying in my closet and something came
[42:58] over me and it was the Holy Spirit and I
[43:01] just was praying on my knees I started
[43:04] weeping and praising and I said it name
[43:06] of Jesus Christ this mountain is going
[43:09] to move and this woman's gonna have her
[43:11] baby I just said it in the name of Jesus
[43:13] Christ I was so shook up I told my wife
[43:15] I'd words I think I just spoke the word
[43:17] of the Lord but I'm not gonna go too far
[43:19] because I'm not real good at this you
[43:20] know I'm not a leper I'm not a prophet
[43:22] in other words and they've been trying
[43:24] for three years and almost given up and
[43:25] a few weeks later I got a text saying
[43:27] they're pregnant then they had a baby
[43:29] nine months later and they sent me a
[43:31] picture of little her name's little Mary
[43:33] Mary Ellen that's one time where they
[43:36] given up hope but we spoke the name of
[43:38] Jesus Christ God gives him a child and
[43:41] now they got a little baby by you know
[43:42] she's a little older now by God's grace
[43:43] but that's one time where we spoke in
[43:45] the name of Jesus Christ each time when
[43:47] we would cast out the Devils there when
[43:49] there's times we cast out the Devils as
[43:52] we pray as I would speak the name of
[43:55] Jesus Christ and tell the devil that the
[43:58] blood of Jesus Christ and the name of
[44:00] Jesus Christ was against the devil
[44:02] that's when the devils would start
[44:03] fighting they start you know flicking
[44:05] their arms and they they start foaming
[44:07] at the mouth but if I just when we just
[44:09] keep praying and just keep believing and
[44:10] just call on the name of Jesus
[44:12] eventually the demon would leave and
[44:14] then the people would come back to the
[44:15] regular senses they'd smile again they'd
[44:17] be happy but it was when it was and I
[44:20] noticed it was right when we said the
[44:22] literal name of Jesus Christ and come
[44:25] against the devil with the blood of
[44:27] Jesus Christ so that's a few examples of
[44:30] my life one time I was this is just a
[44:33] small example one time there's a
[44:35] critical spirit in a church
[44:36] that and after the service I later on I
[44:40] went and prayed right in that person's
[44:41] spot and I said in the name of Jesus
[44:43] Christ I come against this critical
[44:44] spear in the name of Jesus Christ and
[44:46] may it not come back and the next
[44:48] service it wasn't back but they've been
[44:51] there every time before but I was just
[44:54] one small example of any little thing if
[44:57] you speak it in my name and believe
[44:59] he'll do it and that was for God's glory
[45:01] because critical spirits kind of hinder
[45:03] the move of the Holy Spirit and so I
[45:05] wasn't I was we're not wrestling against
[45:07] flesh and blood like we're not trying to
[45:09] have a wrestling match and fight against
[45:10] people you know that don't have the
[45:12] right attitude but we're asking the Holy
[45:14] Spirit to deliver people who are
[45:17] enslaved by sin or take them out because
[45:20] we want God's love to flow through this
[45:22] place like a fountain we want the love
[45:25] of God to flow through like like a
[45:27] fountain overflowing where people feel
[45:29] the love of God their lives are changed
[45:30] their hearts are restored and they just
[45:33] fall more in love with Jesus all the
[45:34] time amen
[45:35] that's all we want now anyone like to
[45:37] raise your hand and let me know if you
[45:39] like to share a testimonial time you

[50:33] even power and dreams in the name of
[50:36] Jesus absolutely yes server Hosea stand
[50:38] up sir amen
[51:03] a man David grades the Lord God is good
[51:13] beautiful yeah in Guyana - I we prayed
[51:17] for a woman who had a kidney stone and
[51:19] she was holding a baby and after a
[51:21] service she came up all excited she's
[51:23] like brother Jesse you know she said
[51:25] well after you prayed I went back to my
[51:26] seat and I was raising my hand you know
[51:27] holding my baby and I felt a hot
[51:29] sensation come upon that kidney stone
[51:31] and then it shot out through my foot
[51:32] she said jesus healed me of a kidney
[51:34] stone so that was beautiful by God's
[51:36] grace very thankful for that and then a
[51:38] sister over a sister Marie who used to
[51:41] come here she was experiencing bleeding
[51:44] and two years ago she came up to the
[51:46] altar and prayed and she said she felt
[51:48] the touch of the Holy Spirit when we
[51:49] prayed for in the name of Jesus Christ
[51:51] and the bleeding stopped so she and her
[51:53] husband called me the next day and told
[51:55] me the testimony so very thankful let's
[51:57] get a little round of applause for that
[51:58] evening so we're thankful for the name
[52:04] of Jesus Christ it gives us power and
[52:05] authority over all unclean spirits now I
[52:09] just put this in here just as a teaching
[52:11] we need faith in the name of Jesus
[52:13] Christ in order to see the power because
[52:15] the Bible said his name through faith in
[52:18] his name hath made this man strong so
[52:22] it's more than as we know it's more than
[52:24] just saying it we've got to have faith
[52:26] in it but even if even if we feel like
[52:29] our faith isn't where it needs to be we
[52:31] should say it anyway and then say Lord I
[52:33] believe but help my unbelief raise my
[52:36] faith so that when I speak it you'll
[52:39] answer if it's your time and season
[52:41] right we know everything is governed by
[52:42] times and seasons so it's his name
[52:46] through faith in his name now here's
[52:49] just the story remember acts 19 there's
[52:51] a certain vagabond of the Jews Exorcist
[52:53] took upon them to call over them which
[52:56] had evil spirits the name of the Lord
[52:58] Jesus saying we adjure you by Jesus whom
[53:01] Paul preached so in other words they're
[53:03] trying to cast out demons but they're
[53:04] Jews they don't believe Jesus is the
[53:06] Messiah but yet they're trying to use
[53:08] his name to cast out demons and there
[53:12] were seven sons of one Skiba a Jew and
[53:14] of the chief priests which did so
[53:17] and the evil spirit answered and said
[53:19] Jesus I know Paul I know but who are you
[53:22] and the man in whom the evil spirit was
[53:25] leaped on them and overcame them and
[53:27] prevailed against them so that they fled
[53:30] out of that house naked and wounded so
[53:32] that's just a good scripture to keep in
[53:33] mind that we have to have faith in the
[53:36] name that we're using and how many would
[53:38] say Lord raise my faith tonight Oh
[53:39] hallelujah for the for the battles of
[53:42] this week the battles of next week or
[53:44] next year if God should tarry give us a
[53:47] faith increased so that we can have
[53:49] faith for the hour of temptation or the
[53:52] hour of trial we want to have real faith
[53:55] we want to have faced with that if a
[53:57] devil would talk to us they'd say I know
[53:58] who you are you're a child of the king
[54:01] amen you're a son or daughter of God
[54:04] Almighty that's the kind of faith we
[54:06] want to have by God's grace and after
[54:10] this was done after these people saw a
[54:12] demon leap on Jews who were just trying
[54:15] to use the name of Jesus without having
[54:16] faith the Bible said fear fell on them
[54:19] all and the name of the Lord Jesus was
[54:22] magnified so when the name of Jesus has
[54:25] really used the right way Jesus will be
[54:28] magnified and he'll be respected he'll
[54:32] be he'll be reverenced you know he'll be
[54:34] honored and that's why in our church we
[54:35] always want to honnor the name of Jesus
[54:37] we don't want to tell jokes about the
[54:39] name of Jesus we don't want to say evil
[54:40] things about we just want to say all
[54:43] reverential holy worshipful things about
[54:46] our name of our Savior Jesus Christ
[54:48] so that's what happens the name of Jesus
[54:51] gets magnified when you use it with
[54:54] reverence and respect amen because
[54:57] remember Jesus said this is how we pray
[54:59] our Father which art in heaven hallowed
[55:02] be your name your name has to be hallow
[55:04] it or sacred or set apart or something
[55:07] special something reverent that you
[55:09] treat very special Paolo would be the
[55:12] name of Jesus tonight amen now here's
[55:17] all I want to bring this thought here
[55:19] and this is going to be this may be new
[55:21] to our visitors I'm not sure but why
[55:24] don't more or most people see the power
[55:27] of Jesus Christ's name today
[55:29] why don't they well there's there's a
[55:32] couple reasons but the first reason is
[55:36] because the Bible says now I'm not
[55:39] making this up I'll show it to you the
[55:40] Bible says the name of Jesus Christ has
[55:43] been blasphemes by the Antichrist spirit
[55:47] that's why people don't see more of the
[55:50] power of God like they come to church
[55:51] and it's boring and God doesn't move you
[55:53] know one reason that that's happening is
[55:57] because the devil has worked in churches
[55:59] and he's actually blasting the name of
[56:02] Jesus and he's changed the name of Jesus
[56:05] to something else and this is scriptural
[56:08] I'm not making this up I'll show ray
[56:10] it's revelation 13:6 and he the beast
[56:14] this is speaking out in the Beast is the
[56:15] Antichrist spirit and the Beast
[56:18] opens his mouth and blasphemy against
[56:20] God and he blasphemes his name and his
[56:24] tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven
[56:27] so this has been a reality to me since
[56:30] I've been serving the Lord is that a lot
[56:33] a lot of people that go to church don't
[56:35] see the power of God and a lot of times
[56:37] it's because they don't reverence the
[56:39] name of Jesus they don't respect the
[56:40] name of Jesus and then they don't use
[56:43] the name of Jesus the name of Jesus
[56:45] should be used in doing the good works
[56:49] of God that's right because remember we
[56:52] know the Bible says God sent Jesus
[56:55] Christ to destroy the works of the devil
[56:58] amen
[57:00] Jesus came as a deliverer he also came
[57:02] as a destroyer he's going to destroy
[57:04] Satan's Kingdom a hallelujah even the
[57:07] mighty Conqueror amen hallelujah that's
[57:10] what the Bible literally says he came to
[57:12] destroy the works of saying let's read
[57:14] it since we got time yeah I'll pull it
[57:16] up here Malachi I'd leave its first John
[57:19] if I'm not mistaken so if you got your
[57:21] Bibles first John I'll have it in just a
[57:23] minute and so we know Jesus said yeah
[57:34] here's let me make it larger of course
[57:46] here it is yep
[57:48] Jesus said the works that I do will you
[57:51] do also either committeth sin is of the
[57:54] devil for the devil sinneth from the
[57:56] beginning for this purpose the Son of
[57:58] God was manifested that he might destroy
[58:00] the works of the devil so when you see
[58:04] when your heart goes out to people and
[58:06] their looks like their lives been
[58:07] destroyed by Satan we should pray and
[58:09] say God give me use them to help come in
[58:11] there and drive out Satan and destroy
[58:13] the works that he's done in their lives
[58:15] aren't you glad someone prayed for you
[58:17] so that the works of the devil would be
[58:19] destroyed in your life and that God
[58:21] could rebuild your life start afresh all
[58:23] over but the the clay back on the
[58:25] potter's wheel and start all fresh all
[58:27] over again amen
[58:29] that's why Jesus came to destroy the
[58:31] works of the devil and show us how to do
[58:34] the same thing but this is why more
[58:37] people are you know tired and bored with
[58:38] Church because most of the churches are
[58:41] deceived and they don't use the name of
[58:43] Jesus Christ because the Antichrist
[58:45] spirit has deceived them and they've
[58:48] changed the name of Jesus to something
[58:51] else now let's look at it now
[58:52] so most churches they do not use the
[58:56] name of Jesus at baptism instead they
[58:59] use father son Holy Ghost which we know
[59:02] Jesus said but remember we read that ten
[59:04] days later Peter baptized in the name of
[59:08] Jesus Christ and we'll look more about
[59:10] that in just a minute but when they when
[59:12] they bless marriages they don't use the
[59:14] name of Jesus anymore they use father
[59:16] son Holy Ghost have you noticed that
[59:18] they don't even name the name at there
[59:20] in a Christian Church but they never
[59:21] name the name of Jesus
[59:23] remember the whole family in heaven and
[59:25] earth is named the Lord Jesus Christ and
[59:29] they don't name his name at preaching
[59:32] they say may the father be with you may
[59:33] the son be with you may the Holy Ghost
[59:34] be with it but what's his name his name
[59:36] is Jesus Christ and then they don't use
[59:39] his name in prayers they use again the
[59:41] titles father son Holy Ghost so it's
[59:45] it's sad but they've rejected the
[59:46] all-powerful name of Jesus Christ
[59:49] so if without the the power of the name
[59:52] they just have
[59:53] they just have a form of religion
[59:55] instead of having the life and the power
[59:58] of Jesus Christ amen now let me show you
[1:00:00] some examples what I mean cuz I'm not
[1:00:02] trying to be critical of other churches
[1:00:04] I'm not trying to be critical of anybody
[1:00:05] but like we said we believe God has sent
[1:00:08] us a messenger to restore our faith back
[1:00:11] to the original Bible faith all right so
[1:00:14] let me show you this here I got this I
[1:00:15] want to just show it to you real quick
[1:00:18] there are five times
[1:00:20] okay so Jesus Jesus said baptized the
[1:00:24] name of Father Son Holy Ghost in Matthew
[1:00:27] 20 19 10 days later after this Peter got
[1:00:31] full the whole he goes and he said
[1:00:33] baptize in the name of Jesus Christ a
[1:00:36] few weeks or months later Philip
[1:00:39] baptized in Samaria and he baptized the
[1:00:42] name of the Lord Jesus Peter then a
[1:00:45] little while later the Bible said he
[1:00:47] baptized in the name of the Lord in 59
[1:00:52] ad st. Paul baptized in Ephesus in the
[1:00:56] name of the Lord Jesus and then when
[1:00:58] Paul gave his testimony in acts 22:16 he
[1:01:01] told Agrippa he said then I went I was
[1:01:03] baptized in the name of the Lord so if
[1:01:06] you put all the baptisms together what
[1:01:08] name do you get when you when you put
[1:01:10] them all together you get the name of
[1:01:11] the Lord Jesus Christ and so that's what
[1:01:14] we baptize when we when we bury someone
[1:01:16] in water fully immerse them there's my
[1:01:19] half hour we bury them and we say in the
[1:01:22] name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[1:01:24] remission of sins and you shall receive
[1:01:26] to give to the Holy Ghost
[1:01:27] how many raishin have you been baptized
[1:01:29] that way who's been baptized amen praise
[1:01:31] the Lord wonderful that is and that's
[1:01:34] the only true Bible baptism because no
[1:01:37] one if you read and these are all the
[1:01:38] baptism in the book of Acts
[1:01:40] no one said father son Holy Ghost and
[1:01:42] that's because Jesus was letting them
[1:01:45] know that the Father Son Holy Ghost was
[1:01:48] him he was the image of God and I'm
[1:01:51] gonna prove that to you right now
[1:01:52] hopefully with this this visual right
[1:01:55] here okay so I changed colors so how
[1:01:57] many know there's a father son Holy
[1:01:59] Ghost in the Godhead I me know that okay
[1:02:03] well we know the Bible says the son
[1:02:05] became flesh
[1:02:07] and dwelt among us right because the
[1:02:11] Bible said no it's really small but
[1:02:12] Colossians 1:19 it pleased the father
[1:02:14] that in him should all the fullness of
[1:02:18] God dwell so all of God was going to
[1:02:20] dwell in Jesus and then Colossians 2:9
[1:02:24] said for in him dwells all the fullness
[1:02:28] of the Godhead bodily
[1:02:30] so all God's power all that God was was
[1:02:33] in Christ now watch this watch the
[1:02:37] scripture so the father was actually
[1:02:40] dwelling in Jesus how many know that
[1:02:42] John 1410 says the father that dwells in
[1:02:45] me the father that dwells in me he does
[1:02:47] the works so the father came and lived
[1:02:52] in the son there's another screen now
[1:02:56] the Holy Ghost the Bible says the Holy
[1:02:57] Ghost is it was inside Jesus in John
[1:03:02] 1:32 it said the spirit abode on him and
[1:03:05] the spirit remained on to him and then
[1:03:08] John 3:34 said God gives the spirit
[1:03:11] without measure unto Jesus and then
[1:03:15] lastly these are going real fast I don't
[1:03:16] mean it's go so fast
[1:03:17] acts 10:38 God anointed Jesus Christ
[1:03:20] with the Holy Ghost and with power now
[1:03:25] if you put all these scriptures together
[1:03:26] what are you gonna find out you're gonna
[1:03:28] find out that in Jesus in his body
[1:03:32] himself he was father son Holy Ghost all
[1:03:36] in one person not three people one
[1:03:39] person can everybody see that all right
[1:03:42] so the Godhead there's one name to the
[1:03:44] Godhead and that name is the Lord Jesus
[1:03:47] Christ so now you can understand why did
[1:03:51] Jesus say go baptize them in the name of
[1:03:52] the Father Son Holy Ghost and then the
[1:03:54] disciples use the Lord Jesus Christ why
[1:03:56] did they do that because they knew in
[1:03:59] Jesus Jesus was all of it all the
[1:04:01] Godhead was in him all that God was he
[1:04:05] poured into Christ and there's one name
[1:04:07] to the Father Son Holy Ghost and that
[1:04:08] name is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:10] how many kids say amen to that amen so
[1:04:14] hope that helps does that help by God's
[1:04:15] grace amen
[1:04:16] if you just put the Scriptures together
[1:04:18] like that they'll never contradict each
[1:04:20] other
[1:04:20] they'll all point to the the same
[1:04:22] eternal truths that there's one God and
[1:04:24] his name is Jesus Christ amen
[1:04:27] all right so hope that was helpful by
[1:04:32] God's grace and I want to show let's see
[1:04:34] you I want to show that one too I guess
[1:04:37] we can show that one too
[1:04:39] so Bible support for the three main
[1:04:41] baptisms so most people baptize father
[1:04:43] son Holy Ghost but there's only one
[1:04:45] scripture for that there's no examples
[1:04:48] in the book of Acts of anyone baptizing
[1:04:50] in Father Son Holy Ghost
[1:04:52] now there's churches that are called to
[1:04:54] someoneís churches and they just use
[1:04:56] Jesus only they don't say Lord they
[1:04:58] don't say Christ well there's no
[1:05:00] scriptures that use just the name Jesus
[1:05:01] only but if you look for Lord Jesus
[1:05:04] Christ there's five scriptures that use
[1:05:07] the Lord Jesus Christ in the Bible so
[1:05:10] the Bible has all truth right and so
[1:05:13] when we look at the Bible we say well
[1:05:15] which one should we be baptized
[1:05:16] how many would say we baptized father
[1:05:18] son Holy Ghost no Jesus only I'm gonna
[1:05:21] say we should if we have the faith and
[1:05:23] apostles will baptize the name of Lord
[1:05:25] Jesus Christ somebody to say that
[1:05:27] because they they were filled with
[1:05:29] Jesus's spirit they got the Holy Ghost
[1:05:32] and ten days later they baptize in the
[1:05:34] name of Jesus Christ amen hope that's a
[1:05:37] blessing now let me show what happened
[1:05:40] here
[1:05:40] I think I'll just use this one there's a
[1:05:44] lot of words on here but let me just go
[1:05:46] slowly here's the baptism timeline from
[1:05:48] 33 ad that's when the Holy Ghost fell to
[1:05:51] 180 there's really two kinds of baptisms
[1:05:54] in the first hundred years of church
[1:05:57] history first one is the Apostolic
[1:06:00] baptism called the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:06:02] it's the true baptism formula and that
[1:06:05] was carried out by st. Peter in acts
[1:06:07] 2:38
[1:06:08] and that was around 33 ad now st. Paul
[1:06:13] 20 about 26 years later according to one
[1:06:17] timeline st. Paul baptized in the name
[1:06:20] of the Lord Jesus in acts 19:5
[1:06:23] now the first history item weakened or
[1:06:27] the first historical reference we can
[1:06:29] find where anyone ever baptized him
[1:06:31] father son Holy Ghost was about 40 years
[1:06:34] after Paul around as right around 100 AD
[1:06:38] and this is called the liturgy baptism
[1:06:41] which is a false baptism formula and
[1:06:44] that's Holy Ghost okay
[1:06:48] so when Jesus first filled that with the
[1:06:50] Holy Ghost they knew the right baptism
[1:06:52] they did it right they did it right but
[1:06:54] then somehow after all this time it got
[1:06:55] lost some people started you know get
[1:06:58] deceived and they changed the name of
[1:07:00] God instead of the Lord Jesus now
[1:07:02] they're just using we what we would call
[1:07:04] titles instead of the actual name of
[1:07:07] Jesus Christ does that help by God's
[1:07:09] grace and now this is not my idea
[1:07:12] because look I got 14 historical
[1:07:16] references that all say the same thing
[1:07:17] they all say that all the early apostles
[1:07:21] and Christians only baptized using the
[1:07:24] name of Jesus Christ and then about a
[1:07:27] hundred year or about that would have
[1:07:29] been about seventy years after Jesus
[1:07:31] left people started
[1:07:33] misunderstanding baptism and they
[1:07:35] started using the titles Father Son Holy
[1:07:37] Ghost instead of understanding there's
[1:07:39] one name to the Father Son Holy Ghost
[1:07:40] that's Jesus Christ amen
[1:07:43] so if you want copies to those I can
[1:07:45] make copies of those for you house if
[1:07:47] you like copies those let me know after
[1:07:48] service I'll be happy to get you copies
[1:07:51] of those Simon Simon and I and my wife
[1:07:53] and I were digging in libraries at the
[1:07:55] University of Akron in Kent State trying
[1:07:57] to find those and make copies and so if
[1:08:00] you want copies we'll be happy to share
[1:08:01] those with you by the grace of God
[1:08:04] praise the Lord okay so I think those
[1:08:07] are the ones I want to show on that one
[1:08:09] I hope that's a blessing by the grace of
[1:08:13] the Lord let's get back to where we were
[1:08:14] so again that's why that's why people
[1:08:17] don't where's the power of Jesus how
[1:08:19] come people aren't speaking the name of
[1:08:20] Jesus it's because this the Antichrist
[1:08:23] spirit has taken the name of Jesus
[1:08:25] Christ away and given them God's titles
[1:08:28] instead of having God's name that has
[1:08:31] power in it amen because you could read
[1:08:34] the whole Bible and no one ever said I
[1:08:37] cast out this demon then the titles
[1:08:38] father son Holy Ghost you know you'll
[1:08:40] never see that every miracle that was
[1:08:43] ever done was done by speaking the name
[1:08:45] of Jesus Christ that's right
[1:08:48] amen and look what the Bible says Paul
[1:08:51] tells the calash in church whatsoever
[1:08:53] you do in word or deed do all in the
[1:08:58] name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to
[1:09:00] God and the Father by him so whatever we
[1:09:03] do whether we go to work tomorrow
[1:09:04] whether we baptize somebody tonight you
[1:09:06] know whatever we do whether we cast out
[1:09:09] a demon or pray for a sick person
[1:09:10] whatever we do it should be done in the
[1:09:12] name of Jesus Christ and if we can't do
[1:09:15] the name of Jesus Christ we should
[1:09:16] probably shouldn't do it all right we're
[1:09:20] getting close here today and I didn't
[1:09:21] have a whole lot now the name of Jesus
[1:09:26] Christ as we said has been rejected
[1:09:28] revelation 13:8 said it but we are
[1:09:32] living in the age of the open door and
[1:09:34] this is in the Bible as well these are
[1:09:36] all great mysteries that people don't
[1:09:37] know about the Bible said that they the
[1:09:40] Beast would blast me in the name of
[1:09:42] Jesus but then Jesus was going to open
[1:09:45] the door to salvation using his name
[1:09:48] would be the way into this door of
[1:09:50] salvation and it was prophesied in the
[1:09:53] Bible so let's show you that in the
[1:09:54] scripture here okay so I believe it's
[1:09:57] Revelation chapter 3 let's go to
[1:10:00] Revelation chapter 3 here's an open door
[1:10:02] and these are the seven churches in
[1:10:05] Revelation chapters two three so let's
[1:10:08] go to Revelation chapter three you got
[1:10:10] your Bible there
[1:10:25] amen thank
[1:10:27] for the name of Jesus praise the Lord
[1:10:39] okay alright verse 7 revelation 3 7 and
[1:10:48] to the angel the church in Philadelphia
[1:10:50] write these things saith he that is holy
[1:10:52] he that is true he that hath the key of
[1:10:54] David he the openeth and no man shutteth
[1:10:58] and shutteth and no man openeth I know
[1:11:03] thy works behold I have set before thee
[1:11:05] an open door there's the open door and
[1:11:08] no man can shut it for thou hast a
[1:11:11] little strength and has kept my word and
[1:11:14] has not denied my name
[1:11:17] these are red-letter words and jesus
[1:11:19] saying Jesus saying I'm opening the door
[1:11:21] you've kept my faith and you've not
[1:11:24] denied my name
[1:11:25] amen so let's look at this here so
[1:11:29] there's an open door according to this
[1:11:31] later seen letter there's an oh I'm
[1:11:33] sorry this Philadelphia letter rather
[1:11:35] this is the age of the Philadelphians
[1:11:36] there's an open door and it continues
[1:11:39] until the last age or the end of time
[1:11:42] until Jesus returns praise God but we
[1:11:46] know these earlier these earlier ages or
[1:11:50] generations it was actually the open
[1:11:53] door for the false vine so that this was
[1:11:55] the age actually this Pergamos age this
[1:11:58] was the age when Satan started changing
[1:12:00] that name even more so he took away the
[1:12:03] name of Jesus and instituted Father Son
[1:12:05] Holy Ghost and the people didn't know
[1:12:08] the name really until they didn't get
[1:12:10] the real revelation name until around
[1:12:12] 750 ad is when this name of Jesus moves
[1:12:17] started coming back using the literal
[1:12:19] name of Jesus
[1:12:20] so this Philadelphia church age we know
[1:12:23] began number around 1750 - and it goes
[1:12:26] till today and it's the glory that we
[1:12:29] see in Revelation 3:8 then I've set
[1:12:32] before you an open door and you've not
[1:12:35] denied my name Amen
[1:12:37] does that help by God's grace this this
[1:12:39] shows us where we are
[1:12:40] geez
[1:12:41] has opened the door and Jesus said I am
[1:12:43] the door right Jesus said I am the door
[1:12:46] to the sheepfold
[1:12:47] he's the door and here we also know that
[1:12:50] we have to go through his name in order
[1:12:52] to go through that door we have to use
[1:12:54] the name of Jesus Christ praise God so I
[1:12:57] just thought to give you a little visual
[1:12:58] there that that's the door to get into
[1:13:01] God's kingdom is through Jesus Christ
[1:13:03] the name of Jesus Christ
[1:13:05] how many walk through that door amen
[1:13:08] that's the door we want to walk through
[1:13:09] Jesus Christ now this is a quote on it
[1:13:13] just for times sake I'm not going to
[1:13:16] read all that but it's the age of the
[1:13:18] door opening and the door opening is the
[1:13:20] revelation of him and he's bringing us
[1:13:23] his strength his word the glorify his
[1:13:26] name so jesus said you have a little
[1:13:28] strength this strength comes from the
[1:13:30] revelation of the deity of Jesus Christ
[1:13:32] that Jesus Christ is God we'll have the
[1:13:35] word Jesus is the word and we've kept
[1:13:37] this we've not denied his name so we're
[1:13:39] baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:13:42] Christ and we know Jesus is the door
[1:13:45] praise God amen like I said I got a lot
[1:13:48] up there I'm gonna skip past that joke
[1:13:50] so just for times sake alright now just
[1:13:55] to give you another visual this was
[1:13:57] about the time that the Trinity doctrine
[1:14:00] really took off was around 300 ad
[1:14:03] remember these were the three Church
[1:14:05] ages that had an open door I'm sorry
[1:14:08] Justin's evil works there's a lot of you
[1:14:12] know the Crusades all these things that
[1:14:15] were done that should not have been done
[1:14:17] they did it because they didn't have the
[1:14:20] power in the name of Jesus Christ but
[1:14:23] this is really when it started taking
[1:14:25] off where God was no longer no longer
[1:14:28] identified as being Jesus Christ now
[1:14:31] they cut him up into three persons which
[1:14:33] is basically a idolatry right polytheism
[1:14:37] so Jesus had to open back the door up
[1:14:40] and it's only through his name amen
[1:14:43] his name through faith in his name we
[1:14:45] walked through the door to salvation so
[1:14:47] that's a part of me that's a little
[1:14:48] history lesson there by God's grace
[1:14:50] hopefully that helps you out by the
[1:14:51] grace of God
[1:14:53] okay so let's bring this down to close
[1:14:55] I'm almost done here
[1:14:57] now I already show this video though or
[1:14:59] I'm sorry more like an animation the
[1:15:01] Father Son and Holy Ghost all appear in
[1:15:03] one body we saw that how the Father Son
[1:15:05] Holy Ghost and they're all identified in
[1:15:07] one body and that's the body of Jesus
[1:15:10] Christ all right next one
[1:15:14] Jesus Christ is the one name of God this
[1:15:18] is God's name that he wants us to know
[1:15:20] is the name of Jesus Christ because the
[1:15:22] Bible prophesized of this in zechariah
[1:15:24] 14:9 and the lord shall be king over all
[1:15:27] the earth
[1:15:28] in that day shall there be one Lord and
[1:15:32] his name's to be one he's gonna have one
[1:15:35] name not three not four not five he's
[1:15:37] gonna have one name and the name above
[1:15:40] all names is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:15:42] one name above all names praise God so
[1:15:48] as we said earlier we must use the power
[1:15:50] in the name of Jesus Christ let me see
[1:15:56] what I got that is at the end there I'm
[1:15:58] thinking I'm coming down yeah I'm coming
[1:15:59] down then okay got last few scriptures
[1:16:00] all right almost done by God's grace all
[1:16:03] right so we must use the power aren't
[1:16:05] you glad to hear about the power that
[1:16:06] we've heard here this is this evening by
[1:16:08] God's grace the power in the name of
[1:16:10] Jesus now is stirred up recently because
[1:16:12] my wife's friend when we prayed for with
[1:16:15] the court situation she was testifying
[1:16:18] to my wife how she's walking around the
[1:16:19] house rebuking spirits in the house in
[1:16:22] the name of Jesus and then God not
[1:16:25] honors it and people with evil spirits
[1:16:27] don't come around anymore in other words
[1:16:30] we speak that name and when we speak
[1:16:32] that name it creates like a holy
[1:16:34] atmosphere around us and the demons do
[1:16:36] not want to come in that atmosphere so
[1:16:38] if you're having trouble at your house
[1:16:39] speak the name of Jesus Christ in your
[1:16:41] home watch it take effect watch the
[1:16:44] power of God come in your life if you're
[1:16:46] having trouble on the job you get there
[1:16:48] at a few minutes early pray in the name
[1:16:50] of Jesus you having trouble in your car
[1:16:52] or whatever you getting there and you
[1:16:54] pray in the name of Jesus Christ I come
[1:16:57] against these spirits I come against
[1:16:58] these spirits of unbelief for these
[1:17:01] spirits these depression spirits or
[1:17:04] spirits of disease
[1:17:06] anything you come against them in the
[1:17:08] name of Jesus Christ and watch God show
[1:17:10] up amen
[1:17:10] may not be immediate but give him some
[1:17:12] time to work praise God he's probably
[1:17:14] working something behind the scenes to
[1:17:16] raise your faith amen
[1:17:17] you must use that name jesus said verily
[1:17:21] verily I say unto you he that believeth
[1:17:23] on me the works that I do shall he do
[1:17:26] also and greater works or more works
[1:17:28] than these shall he do because I go to
[1:17:31] my father and whatsoever you ask in my
[1:17:34] name that will I do that the father may
