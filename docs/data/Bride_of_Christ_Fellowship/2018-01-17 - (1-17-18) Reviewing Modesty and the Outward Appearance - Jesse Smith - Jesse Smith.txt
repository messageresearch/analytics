to continue this little thought on modesty I've been reviewing this reviewing modesty and I'll probably look at makeup tonight as well by God's grace my own okay so the mic on I think the batteries run out maokai can you get some batteries for me please thank you buddy and you have to get them they're on the floor they're on the greens on the green mat and they're Duracell I think anyways let's take a few scriptures let's read first Timothy 2 again by God's grace I had a couple witnesses that I should be teaching on this that were I just thought were strange you know you as a minister you know you look for you look to God and then you say Lord you know just show me some witnesses and yeah thank you sir yeah I'll take all three about to thank you but I had extra witnesses this week it was interesting you know Sunday Sunday night we preached on modest clothing and swimwear and then my children had swim lessons the very next day and it forgot all about that so I went there and was reminded how important modesty is our children our girls did swim lessons with long skirts on and long shirts on and they tights underneath you know of the skirts but they were they were the most modest - dressed children there so we're very thankful about that and then Tuesday I was at my workout last night at Taekwondo and the master starts talking about how modesty has changed he's never talked about modesty malachi as a witness there and all of a sudden he talks about how in the 1950s he used to be a shame for a man to have just a t-shirt all on TV he talked about mash does anyone ever growing up seen - I saw reruns growing up a mash my dad loved mash anyways I guess they wouldn't let the man so that was a second witness and then today at school these kids come up one of the boy comes up and said mr. Smith I got a cross earring in and my heart just sank you know I'm like oh mercy but and what do I say to this kid he's like he's eight years old and he just got it he's got an earring Pierce I said I said buddy I didn't plan it the Holy Spirit just brought I said does that remind you of Jesus and he said yes I said okay I'd say you know I didn't say nothing like yeah you know nice yeah my heart's broken yo and then a girl just a few seconds later said mr. Smith I'm going to get my nails done and get crosses on them I just like there wasn't the same thing I said those crosses remind you Jesus so I've had three reminders for reminders this week about the importance of a holy life and a holy outward appearance so I just felt led to keep studying on this so let's go to 1st Timothy 2:9 Oh have you be seated by God's grace I think it's a good review for us all and like I said I've had 4 witnesses you know um so I just feel like it's the right thing to do at this point we finished Philadelphia Church age on Sunday morning and so we looking at the labor to see uh probably soon by God's grace probably review some of those first Timothy 2:9 appreciate everybody be in the house of Lord tonight amen god bless you for your sacrifice coming out to the house of the Lord okay good mics on all right praise good that's it look at verse 8 well start at 8 I will therefore that men pray everywhere brothers are you praying everywhere but Adam but Paul or maokai he praying everywhere men are supposed to pray everywhere lifting up holy hands without wrath and outings nothing doubting just pray don't doubt God verse 9 in like manner also that women adorn themselves in modest apparel with shamefacedness and sobriety not with broided hair of gold I'm sorry or gold or pearls costly array but which becometh women professing godliness with good works that the woman learn in silence with all subjection Amen let's just have word prayer here I will just take that as our scripture here and we'll be probably looking at other scriptures as I said let's just have a word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord we love you tonight Lord we're thinking about the glory land dear God we're thinking what wouldn't it be when we get over yonder Lord God hallelujah we long to see your face Lord if we know God Lord you're invisible but you became visible in your son image of your spirit your invisible spirit so father we look forward to that day Lord and as we said on Sunday night Lord we're dressing now like they dress in heaven dear God and father we know that's important Lord God for if not we'll be found naked Lord we don't want to be found naked in sin we want to be clothed naturally and spiritually so father I pray take this time tonight Lord speak through me Lord that the Holy Spirit touch every heart Lord God as we know your spirit can pull us in the direction you'd have for us here tonight bless your people those livestreaming those present those that are listened to it on archived Lord God I pray may the Spirit of God speak to us in Jesus Christ's name nobody said Amen god bless she's been seated praise the Lord okay so I'll probably show some of the other scripture or some of the other quotes we have in pictures by God's grace I think we'll go back and okay we want to want to review this real quick we started with this on Sunday we showed again out Jesus in Revelation 1:13 Jesus has a rope down to the feet then of course women you know cover shoulder all the way down in skirts of course and men wear pants we talked about that now I'm going to skip ahead a little bit go to Daniel chapter 2 let's just start there and here's the visual for that Daniel 2 breaks up the image of Daniel in five parts so I I think it'd be kind of easy you know to show these five parts in Daniel chapter two and I got that was all fixed over here there's five divisions now the scripture I don't I'm I'm Daniel three over there but not Daniel - I didn't have time to get Daniel to up there but I thought I thought that was a little inspired I thought inspired by the Holy Spirit that if the Holy Spirit broke up an image of a man in five parts then that's perhaps how God breaks up our bodies in those five parts by the grace of the Lord a Daniel chapter 2 I'm sorry I'm having trouble finding Daniel here Daniel Hosea Thank You Daniel chapter 2 there we go Harvey now I think I'll start okay you got a service 31 the IO King sauce and behold a great image this great image whose brightness was excellent stood before thee and the form thereof was terrible the images head was of the gold case there's the First Division the head the second his breasts and arms of silver that's the second division now here's where I got a little bit confused on Sunday because I forgot Anna read it for a few hours and it said his belly and thighs of brass so belly loins and thighs all go together and that's the major part of the body that we'd say the largest part of the body so head breast belly arms loins I'm sorry belly loin thighs and then legs and feet we'll see in the next verse verse 33 his legs of iron his feet part of iron and part of clay does that help by God's grace that's the picture I didn't have on Sunday night by the grace of Lord so which parts did was Jesus covered in in heaven Church he was covered all the way from the breasts all the way down to the feet amen hallelujah he was covered all the way down there so we believe it's best to cover as we said on Sunday I'm sorry that should have been a little lower it should have been past the knees there as we said on Sunday we believe we should cover from the shoulders at least down past the knees and our sisters got to be careful you know if they wear a skirt right past and he's got to be careful not to expose thighs because thighs our nakedness in the scripture okay so we want to make sure now you see it sometimes sisters you know in the message or whatever they'll have a little slits in the back and then if they bend down or to pick something up people can see their their thighs and they shouldn't do that you know that's wrong that's showing nakedness so we want to have it long enough where we don't cause anybody to stumble we don't want to be guilty of causing anyone to stumble okay so I thought this would be helpful here by the grace of Lord now I want to show a little more history now Sunday we showed this in 1922 this is out of Chicago City or I'm sorry in Chicago I'm not sure where but these two women were getting arrested for showing off their thighs and that's history now we're gonna find out just ten or fifteen years later it was okay but in 1922 they could be arrested for showing off your thighs which was shocking and then a few years later this must be the 30s or 40s they would measure the women's dresses their swim dresses they had to be a less than six inches from the knee so if it was more than six inches from the knee that the skirt they they got kicked out they couldn't swim at the beach and that's sad I just think it's the it's just mind-boggling to think of this now let's review a little bit of history here so this is part two on the modest clothing like I said I had actually four witnesses I just thought of the other ones there but my Taekwondo instructor talked about how truth is pliable but I told Malachi's that truth is not pliable so my instructor was basically saying that you know in the mass days in the 1950s a man at Essure it was in modest but he said today he said boys can go down the streets and they're you know they're pants hanging down in the city imagine that happens you know they show their undergarments he said that's he said that's okay for people today he said but for both generations today in 1950 being totally naked on the street was sin or was wrong so he said see see how truth is bendable and in my mind no it's not bendable truth is not bendable God always wanted that apart from the shoulders all the way down clothes they meant God's Word has never changed hey men God started that in Genesis 3:21 when he put coats of skins on Adam and Eve he wanted it there and it continued all the rest of the Bible even into the book of Revelation into the future so truth is not pliable truth is truth truth is unchanging amen and that's all the students today at a school with earrings and fingernail pain and I'm just like oh my but here's the history the public undressing of the 1900s and like I said if you want to copy the book buy you one if you can't afford it throw a nice book had a lot of great history I'm gonna alright what I'm gonna do is I write my book I'm going to contact the library and use a lot of the books he used and then and be able to read them myself so here from 1900 1910 this book shows the woman's arms were exposed remember this time they were separate parts of the beach there was total segregation at the beach there was men on one side women on their side well in the 1900s and 1910s it went from long-sleeve up to no sleeve in the 1920s their legs started being shown and their back started appearing I remember recalled in the rest of 1922 fourth eye exposure they arrested in 1922 for exposing their thigh but there was no arrest in the 30s and 1930s they women started showing cleavage and technology advanced which led to new fabrics and fibers for tight swimwear so before you couldn't see the form of the body they were just so baggy but then inks are getting tighter 1935 is actually 1935 the two-piece suit was invented but was not popular to the 1940s it shocked people for almost 10 years 5 10 years people were shocked like wow they're showing off the midsection I think it's called the midriff I think if I'm not mistaken ok and it was so shocking it didn't even come publicly didn't happen publicly for a number of years because here's what it said in 1933 this is from Harper's Bazaar magazine it said no other human device can even approximate the utter freedom that perfection of fit at least or in motion I'm sorry I arrest our motion that airy but strictly legal sense of wearing nothing at all so this is a magazine promoting women to wear really tight swimwear and they're saying it gives us the freedom to feel like we're in wearing nothing at all I mean spiritually warning signs should have been going off in people's minds right but this is in 1933 so see that's why today women have that same type of we'd say adulterous or kind of harlot kind of spirit when they wear clothes that are super tight you know especially to work out you know like you see CrossFit people or something like that they feel like they're wearing nothing at all that's because they are in one way they they are they're wearing it so tight it gives the form in their body causing men to lust so skin tight clothing was devised to offer nudity and covering at the same time so see it's a mixture right it's I was covering but also nudity because it gives the the full form of the body right it gives the whole form of the body but it's a mixture of we'd say nudity and covering it's a perversion amen now the 1940s and 50s was when the two-piece suits revealed the midriff which is the place between the chest and the waist so revealed this area here strapless suits and bared shoulders were now seen advertisers began using these immodest women to sell their products and they still do it today of course 1960s and 70s the navel was exposed the belly button so they never saw that belly button to the 1960s or 70s and yet the one-piece conservative suits right that's what the that's what the religious people would say well I'm not wearing a two-piece suit I just got a one-piece suit but that one-piece suit kept coming up higher and higher and reveal more of the thigh all the way up to the waist right and so now the one-piece suits are more erotic than they'd ever been the conservative suits because they show the thigh all the way up to the waist and now the 1980s 1990s everything's been revealed since then I don't even write the words on there because they're just so awful okay now does that help you a little bit this is all historical fact like nobody can argue with this and the whole time God's people are standing there saying onward Christian soldiers marching as to war with the cross of Jesus going on before and there's a Christian marching on and brother Brandon saw the vision of the Church of America member he said she just had some covering on the bottom she was totally naked up top right dancing a rock-and-roll smoke and cutting her hair that's what the vision showed and brother Graham said that vision is thus saith the Lord amen so see how we're obviously we've gone towards that the the world now but the bride she's all dressed in her wedding garments amen she's all ready to take a flight to the sky Haven just got to stay in line Church amen we just got to stay in line stay with the word now what I'd like to do is take a few moments we did the Daniel 5 I just want to have some other notes I didn't have time to put up on here but we'll just go to some other notes but before I forget let me honey remember Mary Mary Tyler Moore's anyone remember Mary time oh okay last year she passed away and I had it on here that's not it here it is did you know she was the first woman to ever wear pants on a sitcom in the 1950s how many member Mary Tyler Moore she was on the life or Time magazine I think Life magazine when she passed away last year and it says the reason this article was written was because Hillary Clinton was running for president last year and she kept wearing pantsuits and the pantsuits caused such a revival amongst the worldly women to wear pant suits they become popular again because Hillary Clinton was wearing well led this article to be written that in fact Mary Tyler Moore was the first woman ever on a sitcom to wear pants I don't remember what year it was but interesting is it clearly leaps and bounds have been made since Mary Tyler Moore first began wearing pants on air but it's important to remember the woman who started it all in that sad there was a time when people were shocked like they're showing a woman in pants on TV they were shocked what you probably member to when they first put a husband and wife in the same bed on a sitcom that what you used to have separate beds on the early shows the first time there was a cuss word on TV all these firsts but we get so but the world has gotten so desensitized in church we're at a spot now where the generation raised up and they've never even heard what we believe they don't even know that there was a time when women never wore pants they don't even know that they don't even know there was a time women used to never wear makeup so we've got to be the generation we've got to share with them amen all right now this is my thought I had I had some different thoughts written down I wanted to cover some of these things now who's never seen the scriptures on makeup has anyone ever seen the scriptures our makeup here has everybody seen it already seen off all three of them or is it see all three have you sister Connie seen all three scriptures on makeup face painting in the Bible but Adam have you seen him okay let children have you seen them okay let's go over them just so you're aware of them okay I thought we'd cover that let's go to 2nd Kings 9 this is the first one 10 kings 9 this week I finish another chapter so now I have almost 20,000 words done in the book so I'm excited about that by God's grace the next chapter those gonna take the longest because I'm doing nose-rings everything else makeup high heels and I need a lot of research on that I can get the scripture on that but I'm adding actually need a lot of research on that so I think the process I think it's gonna slow down here as far as getting chapters done real fast so for second Kings 9 please send Kings 9 and this is the part this is one of the parts I love about the message because people say oh you worship brother branham or you follow a man or you follow man but everything I can say is right back to the Bible and I love that's what I love these studies that's why I made those videos in the first place because we are not following a man we're following Christ amen now a man a prophet point us to the word and we follow his teachings as they go back to the word but this is what I love about the message because it takes us back to Scripture now second Kings 9 now hum you know the story that Jay who was anointed to finish the work of Elijah I remember that he was anointed by I believe Elijah I'm sorry No Deal I show he was anointed by Lisha because he lied jaw anointed Elijah okay and then a son of a prophet anointed the next king I forget which one it was but Jay who was anointed to do this and in verse 22 go to verse 22 Jay who has to avenge all the sins of Jezebel and Ahab he has to avenge and he does it with thus saith the Lord God was going to judge Jezebel Abe and their sons he's got to pour out the judgment upon them because of the wickedness that they did remember I remember that Jezebel killed hundreds of Hebrew prophets kill them genuine we'd say holy spirit now they weren't filled in the soul where they were filled in the spirit genuine holy spirit filled Hebrew prophets she had him killed and then she killed neighbor now the Bible said they Jehu I'm sure that Jezebel committed whoredoms now I don't know if that's just spiritual whoredoms or natural whoredoms I don't know but we'll see it right here in verse 22 so along with all the murders and a certain authority over her husband because remember she killed Namath without asking her husband she basically was becoming King she took over the rulership of her husband so that's verse 22 and it came to pass when Joe ran now that's the son of Ahab and Jezebel saw Jehu that he said is it peace Jacob can you imagine what kind of fool would this man be he thinks he's gonna have peace with a man of God who's anointed by the Holy Spirit and he answered what peace so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her rich witchcrafts are so many a church that's how we should feel how can we have peace with sinners when they keep sitting around us pray how can we we cannot have peace any Christian can't stand to have sin around their lives that's what I want to get to our homes if we really say we have the Holy Ghost how can we let sin in our homes whether it's on our phone or TV or anything like that we can't if we're truly born again amen if we can allow sin to keep happening and happening something's wrong we better see if what we're born again amen now look at this verse so see whoredoms and witchcraft now see I don't know if these are spiritual whoredoms which of course any sin any flirting with the devil is a whoredom because it's a spiritual intercourse with Satan but I don't know if she was also committing natural whoredoms which would be adultery I don't know if she committed adultery against Ahab or not I don't know but Jay who says you have whoredoms and witchcraft now I don't know if you know the story but in verse 24 Jay who draws a bow with his full strength and smoke jo Ram between his arms and it says and the arrow went out of his heart and he sunk down in this chariot this is the this is the facts of the Bible remember the Jehovah the Old Testament is who Jesus of the new but see God is gracious in the New Testament we know that God's more long-suffering in the New Testament so the so a lot of the sinners today like Jo Ram he was judged right there on earth now will God judge people today sure he'll judge people day but we see many sinners and whoredoms and women and you know movie stars and we see them and it seems like they aren't judged for entire lives and maybe that happens sometimes but we must always look at the end of their life right like the Bible said look at the end of a thing look at Elvis he's the easiest example look at Michael Jackson when Elvis died he was on drugs he was running around with women separated from his wife he was so unfaithful to his marriage vows he died according to his his bodyguards he died reading a book about Satanism on his toilet he died right there on the toilet passed out he was just an awful condition Michael Jackson he died because he couldn't sleep he was so tormented by demons remember that and you see that last year where they went and researched his computer and found child pornography all over the whole thing this I mean these this and this a man he looked so nice and he was full of demons I hope he repented but it didn't look like it because he was not ready to do another concert series remember when he died look at the end of a person right hallelujah look at the end of brother Branham amen look at the end of st. Paul I fought a good fight I finished the course I'm ready to be offered a man go ahead cut off my head death where is your sting grave where is your victory amen look at the end of a person Amen not at the beginning or middle look at the end of them look at all these how many remember all these people last year all these musicians that committed suicide remember that all these lead singers of all these bands committing suicide you know just blowing I like to say but blowing their brains out because they have no peace because there's no peace in drugs there's no peace in rock and roll there's no peace and riches there's only peace in Christ look at the end of a thing well here we have God laying a judgment upon Jay I'm sorry Jay Joe now he's not done he killed somebody else with Joe Ranft and then they buried the man and then he goes after Jo Jo I'm sorry jo ramse mama Jezebel see that one of these days shirts the Lord is gonna be come knocking for people that disobey the word of Lord whether RAM said that Jezebel had a pastor she just didn't obey the pastor Elijah right he's gonna come knocking some day it's time to time to meet your maker all right so Jay who comes knocking on the door verse 27 I'm sorry that's where they smite has ayah he comes knocking in verse 30 and when Jay who has come to Jezreel Jezebel heard of it and she painted her face and tired her head and looked out the window okay so why did she paint her face because she knew now according to history it seems like since they had time to bury the bodies of those other guys that Jay who slayed it seems as if she knew she was next so what does she do in the day of her destruction what does she do she paints her face to try to intimidate God's man in utter defiance against the man look it's the spirit of Satan against the holy spirit and was that what does the spear Satan do it tries to intimidate it tries to be aggressive right in defiance oh look who I am I'm the queen she paints her face up to defy the spirit the holy spirit and the entire head just means to make her hair look really really calmly a really beautiful so she dresses all of herself up to try to somehow maybe seduce or defy the man of God my look who she said in verse 31 and as Jay who entered in at the gate she said had Zimri peace who slew his master and he lifted up his face to the window and said who is on my side who and there looked out to him two or three eunuchs he said throw her down so they threw her down and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the horses and heat rode her under foot what an end look at the end of a person can everybody see that by God's grace look at she tries to paint herself up whether through seduction or intimidation let me say like this some pain up face won't fool a real man of God amen hallelujah even though late in these message churches they try to let them paint their faces that won't fool man of God hallelujah good because you can't fool God amen it's exactly right now look what happened this is the word of the Lord in verse 34 she's called a cursed woman go see this cursed woman she's a king's daughter barrier she's a king's daughter verse 35 they go to find her body there's not much left verse 36 wherefore they came again and told her told him and he said this is the word of the Lord which he spake by the servant Elijah the Tishbite saying in the portion of Jezreel shout dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel and the carcass of Jezebel shall be has done upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel so that they shall not say this is Jezebel and now I'm gonna be able to find her because of what an awful influence she had upon God God's Word and killing all those godly servants a church that's what God did to the Jezebel person right how many were what God does to the Jezebel Church how many know what he does let's go to Revelation 19 God does the same thing Revelation 19 and brother Brandon brought this out in the fifth seal if you remember this this thought was brought out in the fifth seal revelation 19 verse 17 on angel standing in the Sun and he cried with a loud voice saying to all the fowls of fly in the midst of heaven come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the Great God that he may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of captains and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of them that sit on them and the flesh of all men both free and bond both small and great and I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse and against his army now go down to verse 21 and the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse which sword proceeded out of his mouth and all the fowls were filled with their flesh and the church said but RAM said see look at the end of the Jezebel spirit once it gets in the church what happens both of them are eaten by dogs I'm sorry burnt my animals Jezebel eaten by dogs and the church is eaten my Birds see what the end is see what God thinks of a rebellious idolatrous group of people that transgressed the Word of God God doesn't like it right he doesn't like it and he brings forth judgment against it amen now we know there's not one scripture in the entire Bible where God ever asked anyone male or female to paint their face right you know you never asked anybody to do that so we must not now give me just a moment here I got a look to my scriptures real quick and let's go there I know the next one is in Jeremiah so let's go to Jeremiah I'm sorry I don't have the scripture I'll have it just a minute here I got to pull it up Jeremiah for third yes Jeremiah 430 this is the second one on painting the face Jeremiah 430 alright who'd like to read that for me cuz I'm gonna read that okay okay thank you sir all right now this is an allegory I don't know what allegory is just like a story that represents something okay so it's like a it's a it's not a literal woman but this is a spiritual woman like it's a type it's a story of a type God is talking about Israel and Israel would go and make love or have whoredoms with the other nations and so God gives an allegory like a story in other words you're like a prostitute woman or a harlot woman or idolatrous woman that when she wants to find lover she goes and paints her face okay that's what the scripture said in verse 30 you deck yourself with ornaments of gold see decking yourself up dressing yourself up though you're though you rent you I face with painting in vain show the make thyself fair that lovers will despise thee they will seek thy life now you'd have to look up here but it's really small but I wrote this is God issuing a sentence against Israel because of what verse 12 says even a full wind from those places shall come unto me now also will I give a sentence against them this is God issuing a sentence he's judging them now notice with Jezebel and Israel they both paint their faces in the day of their judgement and that's striking and that's writing to see you know the judgments of God are on somebody when they're painting their face when they're presenting their face away God is not pleased you know the judgments of God can be against them could be upon them it's very possible in fact all three there's another example in Ezekiel get to in just a minute but you know some somehow now unless they're totally ignorant of it but the judgments of God are against them because this is what the Bible tells us happens when they paint their face now they're gonna get destroyed by I horsemen and bowmen in verse 29 because of all their bitter wickedness and verse 18 their rebellion in verse 17 and their foolishness in verse 22 this is why I God's judging them and God is God is saying how can I compare a nation and try to explain what they're doing and he said the best way to do it is a prostitute woman someone who's unfaithful to their husband who decks herself dresses all herself up and is unfaithful to her husband alright does that help by God's grace hope so boy it's quiet out there all right a man I know it's a tough tough topic Ezekiel 23 40 Seco 23:40 Seco 23 40 is the next text now again this is an allegory it's a type of Israel as another woman here and this is a chapter where she's lusting after the gods of other nations namely Egypt in Assyria now this is even more descriptive of a prostitute woman this is even more descriptive so let's go to verse 14 2340 and furthermore that ye have sent four men to come from far unto whom a messenger was sent and lo they came for whom now it is wash thy self paint that I paint a thine eyes and deck thyself with ornaments so see their lovers were far away so they they took such thought there they were so into idolatry and fornication and uh or whatever more that they said they sent from afar away and they were willing to wait for the sin to come in striking it's kind of like how people day will order things online and they'll wait for them to come in they'll order sin and we're actually waiting for two days with prime you know having Sun prime till it comes and in that sad that's how that's they have it shows they have no more conviction no more if they can order and then they can wait for sin they can wait all this time it shows they've so grieve the Holy Spirit they can't even hear the voice of the shepherd anymore amen the voice the shepherd saying return come back return but they can order things from far away and wait till it comes in because they're so Baxton alright verse 41 and sat us upon a stately bed and the table prepared before it whereupon thou sent nine incense and my Nowell so look she's now that's that's actually wrong did you know that's that's punishable by death for anyone to copy the oil and incense of the tabernacle was punishable by death so see how it's a religious well it's a religious thing here she mixes religion with lusting she makes his religion with seduction and where did all the painted face women go they went to the churches right they become preachers women preachers see they're mixing religious things with spiritual fornication right or in many cases physical fornication because a lot of these women are married twice that a preaching you know they got all these awful relationships they can't handle relationships because they're not based upon the Word of God they write books about relationships and can't even keep their relationships intact right they do conferences these million-dollar women conferences on how to keep a marriage and they're in their second or third marriage that's a pocker see if I ever saw it that's wrong but look can you see it's the same spirit it's mixing truth with lust now look what she does in verse 43 and I said into her that was old in adultery this woman's been doing this over and over and over and is that with the Catholic Church denominations they've been a committed adultery over and over and over was Satan but not us we're virgin to Christ amen how do we were virgin to the word because we're washed in the word amen we don't commit adultery with denominational spirits and compromising with demons no sir look at verse 43 old adulteries will they now commit Horner's with her and she would them yet they went in unto her as they go into a woman that played the harlot so went they in under aloha and to a holy bar I'm sorry Ola and ahold of ah the lewd women that was Jerusalem and Samaria I believe if I'm not mistaken all right now those are the three on makeup does that help by God's grace is that new to anybody okay maybe a few my children I think it's new to you right children I don't think now we've read through that but I'm looking we've never pointed out to you like that okay now go back to revelation 2:20 let me just read this again here now this is one of the most striking things when you talk about makeup revelation 2:20 revelation 2:20 who'd like to read that one for me Lydia okay thank you sweetie amen my this is 1896 let me go back to second kings real quick and see what year that was this is striking because the same spirit that was in Jezebel is now in the Christian Church and now it's battling Jesus Christ why because Jesus Christ was God of the Old Testament same to same two opposite spirits now Jezebel's this said she died in 884 ad so 9 this is almost a thousand years later that same spirit is still fighting the Holy Spirit amen and so you see that and now what do we have today we have women in the churches they've done the same thing Jezebel did they have Serpa thority over men they silenced the true preachers right they threatened the real preachers they wear makeup they emphasize money and prosperity just like Jezebel emphasized money prosperity land remember she took name boss land emphasize money and prosperity and they participate in idolatrous indulgences like the fancy cars and the planes like we talked about a few weeks ago and see how that Jezebel spirit likes to attack the true preachers so what did Elijah do Elijah ran from her and then what did God do God fed him and then made him aware that he wasn't the only one not bowing down to Jezebel's religion hey man hallelujah I like that and that's what we can do you know we can rest in God and we'll Sep we have to separate ourselves from that Jezebel group and God will feed us and let us know we're not the only ones not bowing down he saw I've got a bride all the way around the world amen who will not bow down to the Jezebel system praise God amen now I just want to say this too I'm not saying that every woman where's make up is gonna be judged because I don't know that but I'll tell you they're on the road to it right they're on the road because the only thing that God wants on our faces is his glory that's his glory that's the only thing in the Bible like Stephen had the face of a angel he didn't paint it up to look like a angel you know eating it out the paint and the mirror and everything like that he had the Holy Ghost praise God and that made him have the face like an angel praise the Lord and that's what we need today by the grace of God yeah that's second Corinthians 3:18 we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord so we look in when we look into the Word of God it's like looking the presence of God with the open face and we're changing the same image the face of God right because we're with open face looking the word of God the face of God and change the same image from glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord so as we look into the word of God we're changed are our faces change into the very image of God we'd say in other words the image of joy the image of the fruits of the sphere how do they know yeah the anointing of God when we look into the things of God we're changing the very image of Christ as far as the spiritual image amen okay now I got a few more make sure I cover oh yeah its go to revelation three yeah since we're there let's go to Revelation Lee this is next one I want to cover about the nakedness here you're very familiar with it though I think revelation three I want to read the scripture about the latest in church age about the nakedness here now isn't a striking Church and everything I showed you in history about women undressing themselves isn't it striking it all happened in the Laodicean church teacher in that striking it didn't happen other church ages on this level this scale but at the end of the world and the church age was 1906 to current day and the 1900s the first decade was when the sleeves started coming up and God Artie then Jesus said naked in that's striking now we know it's course naturally naked and spiritually naked we know it's both because it's natural riches right and lacking spiritual riches okay now let's let's read their verse 17 because thou says I'm rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing knowest on that wretched and miserable poor blind and there it is naked now they're spiritually naked and naturally naked and so what does Jesus say I counsel thee so I want to sit down and have a counseling meeting with you and advise you to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that the may s be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou mayest see see there's the facial cosmetics God wants you to have I Sal glory what's the ice what's eyeliner or eyeshadow is that what people put on see they got an all confuse that's just the perversion God wants you to have on ice al amen ice a health and fully clothed amen with the right robes of the righteousness of Jesus Christ in the strikin Satan such a pervert but he's such a pervert of God's Word he's not a creator he's a pervert or of God's Oh God so I'm giving you a better eyes and Saint said I'll give you prettier eyes you know it's just so sad these women that will email me and and and text me and make all these comments like oh we just need a little make-up to enhance our beauty how can you enhance any beauty that God made how can you as a dying human being of failing miserable human as we are we're all miserable dying you know that our flesh is abilities miserable right how can we as failures as human being ever make anything that God did any better the fact is we can't the fact is all humans do is copy God's design amen we uh we bought a book where they showed last year where man finally made a wave like an ocean wave and they were shouting and rejoicing and I think they estimate I think it was remember that book maokai yeah he remembers that book they were rejoicing all we made our first man-made wave and it looked like a real wave like a surfer could surf on and gods like I've been doing that for 6,000 years hey they they put it in a book that they pat him on the back that give them a warrant oh you made a wave and gods like I've already been doing this all this time see they worship the creature more than the Creator amen and they're spending their time trying to try and trying to do a god it why don't we just do what God tells us to do amen now there's nothing wrong with making a wave you know people like parks as long as they dress holy you know water parks what's wrong when there's nothing wrong with that the point I'm trying to make is that Satan's always perverting God's Word and God's creation with the high south and the nakedness and everything like that but let me show you did you know your souls naked until you're born again do you know do you know that the scripture says that it has no covering all all souls of Christians need a covering and it's called a spiritual white robe in other words it's the seal of the Holy Ghost so let's go to 2nd Corinthians 5 we read this a little bit on well we read it on the screen but we didn't read it in our Bibles how many don't I'm ok I'll probably let me give me about 50 more minutes here hope it's been a blessing here so far by God's grace singer in these five verse one for we know that if our earthly house this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands eternal in the heavens that means Church there's already a theophany there waiting for you but the man said there are the theophanies and glorified bodies are there waiting for you now there's already a glorified body up there waiting for us verse 2 for in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon our house which is from all how I want to have a seat being Maya theophany oh how I want to be in my glorified body verse 3 if so that be being clothed we shall not be found see look at this naked without a theophany or without a glorified body spiritually a soul is naked the soul the soul has no covering it has no life right because the Holy Ghost is life in other words buh-bam said what represents life in heaven is a white robe so this is a soul that has no white robe now I don't know what that looks like I don't know if they have tattered garments on or if they're just I don't know I don't know all's I know is that eternal life is white robes and you're clothed you are born when you're born again you've already got your white robe amen well hallelujah that's exactly right see this is a scriptural verse for for we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burden not that we would be unclothed see but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up in life so our clothing is life eternal life praise God so a soul without eternal life is unclothed is unmake 'add so it's important for us to know that by God's grace and that ties in again it ties it with litleo see in church age they're rich increased with goods but are blind make miserable and naked these churches like this lukewarm churches or coached culture lukewarm sources they do not have the Holy Ghost they're not born again every see that and so their souls are naked according to the Word of God amen hope you like that that's one thing I just pulled out there I thought I'd make sure I told that by God's grace now I had a few more notes here Parman let me just look at them real quick I don't have time I had that extra mean I don't have time to get were they on here I wanted to do there's a naked soul okay oh yeah the fifth seal let's go to Revelation chapter 6 this is another example of not having a eternal life the Jews in this day if they die today they're faithful Jews if they're faithful they'll go to the martyrs altar in heaven and their souls will wait under the altar not yet clothed with white robes the white robes will come at the white throne judgment revelation 6 now verse 9 tells us they were slain for the word of God not for the testimony of Jesus Christ the Word of God which means they're Jews and verse 10 shows they can't be Christians because they're asking for revenge and neither should you and I asked for revenge you should say Lord take vengeance upon mine enemies I'm not gonna take vengeance Lord you take vengeance now verse 11 and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was setting them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow-servants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be killed so see they don't get white robes until after they die but a Christian has it now while they're alive amen that's right we have it now according the Word of God our souls are not naked our souls are sealed our souls are marked and we have the clothing I remember jesus said in Luke 24:49 he said when the Holy Ghost comes you'll be endued with power from on high and the word endued means clothed upon your souls clothed with power from on high amen oh they do yeah praise God that's exactly right now let me find a place to close I can either do an abomination let me just do the home life yeah let's go Deuteronomy chapter 6 let me just close I want to close with this thought about the home life I'll preach on the tents a few sundays ago two sundays ago let's just close that Deuteronomy chapter 6 because here's the burden that I saw when I was preaching a brother Brooks's church and by the Tim Hume search the burden I saw is that all the pastors wanted to see a revival in the home the people knew the message but their home life wasn't holy like it should have been in other words they let they made compromises and let's ending it in the homes so to make sure I go over this by the grace of the Lord go to verse 6 here and these words which I command you this day shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in that house when thou walkest by the way when thou liest down when thou risest up now let's be honest with ourselves even live streamers and even everybody here let's be honest with ourselves are we sitting down and talking about the Lord all the time in our houses we should be if we're spending more time talking about worldly things and and what we need what we got to do if we're spending more time talking about that than the Word of God then we've broken the Word of God right we've broken it because this is what we should do we should surround ourselves fill our our mouths full our minds fill our lips fill everything with the Word of God amen it's a command this was a command in the Old Testament we're to teach them diligently to the children and when you're lying down when you're laid down you should pray before you go to bed right when you rise up you should start talk about Jesus right away when you rise up another lujah verse look at verse 8 now this is I love this and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand and they should be as frontlets between thy eyes they literally you know the about the Pharisees they literally put them on their hands and between their on their foreheads there's little boxes of Scripture they're called phylacteries they literally would wear these phylacteries that had scriptures written on a little paper and they would bind them literally because they took this literally now we should say God helped the Word of God to be constantly in my mind help you know like the Bible said marked in the forehead and all my thoughts be on the Word of God that all my works in my hands be to help out other people to be a real Christian that's right verse 9 and thou shalt write them upon the post of thy house and upon thy gates everywhere you look every door there's Jesus outside of that I say at the gate at the fence you see Jesus you want to see Jesus everywhere in your home praise God this is beautiful see a whole life is our life you and I are only as strong Christians as we live in our houses remember we looked at I'm sorry Joshua a few weeks ago for success was that last week but if this success Joshua said you're only gonna have success when you meditate on the word when you speak the word and when you obey the word you're only gonna have success in life when you do that it has to be a high tradition to be everything your life has to be about Jesus Jesus all the time you know my dad one time had a and often never forget this I'll just share this quick story my dad one time had a experience with God he was praying in his closet you know something said pick up he said what did Jesus say he went bought a Bible he started reading only led red letter words and he saw where Jesus said go in the closet you know my dad was a you know kind of verbally abused growing up because his name was Snooki and he was always made fun of and he still is made fun of by different people many ways he's like Wow jesus said go pray the closet so he did that he did it for like I think it was a couple months and he finally got the spot he got in there and he didn't feel nothing he said God where are you I've done this and I haven't heard your voice the next night he went in there this was Tori tells all my family all my brothers sisters he said when the moment he dropped to his knees he felt the holy presence of Jesus and it so scared him he ran out of the closet jumped on the bed tried to wake up my mom and wouldn't wake up he said when he laid there on the bed he said the Holy Spirit hid his feet and came through his feet all the way up through like a hot sensation and then hit went to the top of his head and then went all the way down and my dad showed me his Bibles afterwards almost every word was highlighting the Bible and circled he just had an insatiable appetite for the Word of God after that and he said he felt like you know he had smoked for years this was when he was in his 30s he said I'd smoked for years and after that went through me said I felt like I never smoked a cigarette in my life and he said he said Jesse he said he said when that Holy Ghost hit you at the bottom of your feet he said all she want to think about is Jesus all she want to talk about is Jesus and my dad for a while you know after I gave my life to Lord on a pastor he tried to make me feel like I wasn't born again because I never had that happen to me and I was little discouraged a little bit not for long but I said dad I said that's just your experience not everybody has to have that experience and I said here's how I know dad because I said dad the very next day you said you went out into the fewer farmer you went out into the field and when your farmer friends offered you cigarette and he you knew you shouldn't have did it but you had it anyway you went back to smoking and yet my dad would still read the Bible he said he knew it was wrong and he's like he's like yeah you're right Jesse I shouldn't have done that I said my dad I've never had the experience you had but I said I've shake I've got on my knees and I've shaken till I couldn't even hardly move because the Friends of God in my closet I've shaken at church services praying afterwards where I felt like my ribs were gonna just break because and it came on me three times one time my brother cams Church it felt like oh it felt like just a presence coming on me and then it would leave and then it came back and church when it came the third time I said God don't do it again I feel like I'm gonna die the presence of God come back so strong three times on me I never forget that you know why because I drove through the snow it was level three snow I think I drove through the snow from my house at cams Church going like 20 miles per hour fasting and praying all day and we preached it had some tremendous services that's how I remember and I said dad here's a difference you had that and you said all you can think about is Jesus I said but you went back to smoking I said I didn't have that but now all I can do is think about Jesus and I've got the same result except I got more results because he never he stopped going to church he never went to church he never got same device a dead I'm not only justified I'm sanctified I'm filled with the Holy Ghost I see miracles I'm preaching out every three times a week I said I've got just as much I've got more than you had amen see he just had an experience he just had an anointing where God was trying to clean him out but the point is when Christ comes in you all you want to hear about is Jesus all the time amen your home Jesus your cause Jesus your phone Jesus everything you think about is Jesus amen that's all it is and my dad can relate to that to a degree because he's had an experience with God and I had a simmer experience of course I'd never I never had to go through me like he did but I felt where I couldn't like I was gonna die because there was such a holy presence there three times one after another so you see this is what we have to have we have to have a life at home that matches our life at church so how many like to come to church you know Frasier I don't like to come to church and raise your hands and pray I do I love to do that but guess what if I do in a church and don't do it at home that's hypocrisy can you say Amen George see that's right and that's why we know too when people come to church and don't enjoy the preaching don't enjoy the prayers and the songs it's because they're in sin something has compromised in their home because the church will only be as strong as our whole lives are because where did where did God tell Moses where you got to have God at just at the tabernacle he said put it in your home that's right and any death in a home made everything unclean from the waters of separation sermon we preached on recently this is why it's so important our homes have to stay a sanctified holy place for Christ now go to Matthew 23 I'm going to end with this well I'm going along and I thought Matthew 23 verse 25 and I felt that wonderful services Sunday my prayers life has been renewed at home maybe I don't know how to explain to you but I've just been eager to pray and that's how we we should we should have that more and more all the time all these things that really helped me by God's grace Matthew 23 25 and you know how it is sure Tommy Noah as Christians we go through battles which means we go up and down up and down up and down but I'm just saying if we're seeing long stretches of time where people are we're living in sin we're not having eagerness to pray we're not enjoying reading our Bibles it's time to check up and make sure we're clothed with the Holy Ghost we don't want to be naked wretched miserable blind we don't want to be like that we want the Holy Ghost I south we want the Holy Ghost gold amen we with the Holy Ghost white raiment amen our lives must match what we do at church that's right Matthew 25 I was re 23 25 army look what he says here what when you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for you make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are full of extortion and excess now does that remind us of churches today could be message church any church people come to church and every single hair is in place and they can and the Pharisees dress holy we can dress perfectly holy come to church looking holy you can be totally clean on the outside and be dead on the inside because you're just people are just putting on a show it's true that's the latest in lukewarm spirit they're blind miserable naked and don't even know they think that because they come to church and have a nice outward appearance that God accepts them well that's part of it but what's more important is our inward condition see the Pharisees had it down and that's why we got a lot of modern day Pharisees they come to church you shake their hand they look like they're happy but the main thing is that they get happy with the word if they get happy with the word there must be happy in Christ because Christ is the word amen some people can't even say men or can't even raise their hands or never come up for prayer or never spend time praying or sir loving the loving God or enjoying the services something's wrong if you don't love this like you did when you were first save you've got to get back to the first love amen you have to because you're a church experience is just a reflection of your home experience it is because the church is a home as well the church is a spiritual home your home is your natural home look at this here so beautiful on the outside but full of uncleanness look in verse 26 now blind Pharisee cleanse first that which is within the cup and the plan that the outside then may also be clean won't you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye are like unto whited Sepulcher --zz which appear indeed appear beautiful outward but are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness now what was the scribe Church a scribe with somebody who copied the Bible these people would copy the Bible all day and Jesus says you're full of deadness and that's the point we're making where people say well I listen the message but yet they worship brother Branham all I do is listen to the message that's fine but see people can do that too they can copy the Bible they can be fully it seems like in the word all the way but are they living the word of the hour see the Pharisees weren't living the word of the hour so the question is are we living the word of the hour amen are we actually living what brother Branham said are we living what Jesus taught us in the scripture that's the real test verse 28 for even ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within you're full of hypocrisy and iniquity alright so see that they had excess so when they when they go home they have extortion which is kind of like stealing like money laundering excess is having excess enjoyment for sin right so a church they don't sin but when they get home they sin never be with me when they come to church they're clean clear the West well look at that sister ma she got a brand new skirt off good for her what her hair is so clean well brother you've got a brand new tie on and some money you bought this for me so thank you I having a new tie out but some of you bought it for me what do you want maybe I don't know they're here tonight but see that's all they see but that's not the real person the real person is what you are at home it's a real person and that's why these things even on modesty you know it's important but the real modesty is we sell in Sunday night the real modesty is your submission to Christ your modest opinion of herself I'm really not that great I'm really not that great of a person I have to rely upon Jesus I've got to submit myself to every word of God I've got to constantly die daily and just cling to the word that's exactly right church they're full of uncleanness hypocrisy and iniquity so when they go home that's where they sin when they're a church they look nice too they look nice to everybody it's nice I don't want to be one of those type of people Matthew six lamb with that Matthew six that's why the Bible says examine yourselves before communion examine yourselves and see if you're in the faith do I do it i do excess and sins at home do I do the things at home I wouldn't do a church it shouldn't be that way we should live at home the same way we live at church the same way we act in the fellowship room owner that's the same way we should act at home right the same way we act when we're singing here is the same way we should act at home it has to be the same it can't be a different life this is what the Pharisees had mastered they could live and sin at home but then a church they look like they're just so righteous and holy and clean no they weren't Matthew 6:5 and this is for me but I'm gonna have time but member and verse to Hippocrates love to go out in the streets and get praise and give things to people out in public where the real Christian does it in secret see it's all this public its outward they can put on a real nice outward public show now verse five when thou praise be not as the hypocrites are they love to pray standing in the synagogues in the corners of the streets that they may be seen a men verily send to you they have their reward if your favorite pray place to pray is only at church when sister Cody's watching or Lydia's watching something's wrong with our walk with God we are total hypocrites right now my favorite place to pray is right here but it's when nobody's here I'd love to look up at Jesus and pray I turn the lights off it made me music I just love to talk to him and I just all by myself that's my favorite place so I could say I like to pray a church but it's what no one else is here just Jesus and I but what did Jesus say hypocrites only want to pray when brother Adam is watching right they just want to when somebody's around that they know that's when they love to pray the most and I told you before I've got a bow that I'm constantly praying before people constantly every service I'm praying three or five times a service I've got to constantly make sure that I love my prayers at home just as much as the prayers here because I don't want to be a hypocrite I don't wanna be a Pharisee I don't put on an outward appearance but my inward part is full of excess and iniquity now let's enter our feet this thought I heard a brother say this recently Judas had such a Judas hid his sin so well memory had a thief sorry I don't remember that he was such a thief and he never repented of his love for stealing and money but he hid it so well right he hid it so well that when Jesus said one of you betrayed me at the at the Last Supper he said one of you will betray me he hid it so well that all the other guys look at themselves nor does it me they didn't all say always Judas I saw him last week stealing from the treasurer finally that serpent seed is caught get him out of here Jesus no he hit it so well for two how many years he was there two and three he did it so well that they didn't even know it when he left they didn't even know he was going to betray Christ so see how the Bible see why it's important the Bible says make sure you talk about Jesus when you go to bed when you rise up at the dinner table let's not make Donald Trump the main discussion at the dinner table or a late-night talk show or whatever let's not make that that that can maybe just be talked about in passing what you see Trump do this or see the news there our main topic of discussion should be Jesus what does Jesus done first lately is it on our door frames is Jesus on our gates the main thing is Jesus is Jesus on our hearts is Jesus on our minds or - carried away in too many things it's okay to think about the future and and business and and money and for me you know education and teaching it's okay to think about those things but the whole motivation behind it is how can I do this to glorify Christ how can I do this into honest the most honest way and the most diligent way how can I work for my lord if Jesus was my principal how would I teach then Oh glory see that it had our home life has to be our life and has to be the right life and then we know that we're right with the Lord remember pure religion is visiting the widows and fatherless in their afflictions and keeping yourself unspotted from Laodicea praise God let's bow our heads in word of Prayer here I'll stop right there I went a lot longer than I thought I was going to go parmie I hope it was a blessing tonight by the grace of God like I said I want to keep looking at this modesty and things and then I wanted to bring that little thought there kind of a chopped-up message but like I said I've had four witnesses this week about modesty and holiness and everything like that let's just take a moment let's think about our lives for a moment Heavenly Father all we bow our heads Lord God Lord as we said help us to be modest in our hearts help us to be modest in our estimation of our own abilities dear God help us to remember we have no ability we have no strength of ourselves we need you Lord God even these topics today Lord most of us dress modestly Lord my girls swam very modestly this weekend my son had long pants on and not a shirt [Music] or none of us probably here wear makeup or paying our face and loan that qualifies us as having a beautiful outward appearance but tonight as we close or we want again remember these things that Judas and the Pharisees seem to have in beautiful outward appearance [Music] they were able to hide their iniquity hide their excess or they're able to hide that Lord from everyone except Jesus and when I say like this Lord I hope our sins are hidden so well that you're the only one who can make us aware of them Lord God but we won't Lord keep them hid we will confess them and expose any wrongs in our lives we don't want to be hypocrites we don't want to be full of dead men's bones we want to be filled with life we want to have the white robe of eternal life a man we want to be clothed upon with eternal life Jesus Lord let us take it take examination Lord if if in our homes if we're not talking about Jesus more if we're not Lord reading and enjoying the prayer life if we only love to pray at church lord help us to make that right lord help us to have the right attitude lord help us to look forward to going into the closet tonight or tomorrow and just having time alone with you Lord God you commanded Moses and said talk about it all the time think about it all the time meditate upon these things put it at your gate put it on your forehead put it on your hand everywhere meditate upon my word help us Lord God as my dad taught me long ago when you get the anointing of the Holy Ghost and all you want to do is love Jesus I know your prophet said the same exact thing oh god help us to Love You Lord God help us to
