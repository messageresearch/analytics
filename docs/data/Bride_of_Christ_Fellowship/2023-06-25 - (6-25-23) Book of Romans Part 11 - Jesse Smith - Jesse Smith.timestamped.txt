[1:38] [Music]
[1:39] I was here today
[1:41] it's chapter five I'd like to continue
[1:42] on this book of Romans series here I
[1:45] think this is part 11 if I'm not
[1:46] mistaken
[1:49] Romans 5 verse 3 you know we ended
[1:51] Wednesday night Wednesday was a really
[1:53] wonderful service boy we've had some
[1:54] really wonderful
[1:56] anointings and
[1:59] just really you know that was one of
[2:01] those Services where maybe it was hard
[2:03] getting started but by the end we knew
[2:04] God was here amen
[2:07] well we already know God's here today
[2:08] praise God I feel the presence of the
[2:11] Lord hear it
[2:13] brother man says when he comes you're
[2:14] always humbled
[2:16] you always feel humble in God's sacred
[2:18] presence so we're we're humbled in the
[2:20] presence of the Lord today
[2:22] so we know the Lord is here so let's
[2:24] look to Romans 5 verse 3 and 4 we'd like
[2:27] to look there
[2:29] that will have you be seated here by
[2:31] God's grace so Wednesday we ended with
[2:33] this thought about hope hope for the
[2:35] future
[2:37] just living a life of Hope
[2:39] this is one
[2:42] visible I'm sorry visualization I can't
[2:45] say
[2:47] visualization there you go visualization
[2:50] let me work on my English today
[2:52] this is one visualization of your walk
[2:56] with God that's what I want to kind of
[2:57] look at that today it also be a help to
[3:00] you
[3:01] in other words you visualize wow I'm
[3:03] this I'm on this path and my whole goal
[3:06] is to get to a life of Hope
[3:09] this is one way to visualize your life
[3:11] with God it might be you know we all go
[3:12] through moments where we struggle being
[3:14] hopeful
[3:16] but
[3:17] as God matures us his end game his end
[3:20] goal
[3:21] his end goal is to get us to live a life
[3:23] of Hope
[3:24] of course that's just in another
[3:26] expression of the Holy Spirit
[3:27] living a life yielded to the Holy Spirit
[3:30] so Romans 5 verses 3 and 4.
[3:34] let's we could probably all read this
[3:35] this is uh
[3:37] a nice little section A short section
[3:39] let's begin on three one two three and
[3:42] not only so but we glory in tribulations
[3:45] also knowing that tribulation worketh
[3:49] patience and patience experience and
[3:52] experience hope may God add His
[3:55] blessings to the Ring of his word you
[3:56] may be seated praise God
[3:59] I have some slides we'd like to show
[4:01] here have your Bibles handy I think you
[4:04] know we'll read through some numerous
[4:06] verses here today and if you've got your
[4:08] Bible handy maybe I'll call on you to
[4:09] read or something like that
[4:11] if we feel led here
[4:15] by the grace of the Lord
[4:17] so many thoughts for today you know I
[4:18] kind of got today's thought from listen
[4:20] to brother Cam's sermon from Wednesday
[4:22] it was a wonderful were you there I
[4:23] thought I saw your hair in the picture
[4:25] there I thought that looks like Emma's
[4:27] hair
[4:27] kind of like you have it today
[4:29] that looks like sister Emma but he said
[4:33] something uh and it just kind of
[4:34] triggers something I'm like that's right
[4:36] he was talking about the four grounds
[4:38] parable
[4:40] which is in my you know 2021 book I have
[4:42] a whole section on that
[4:44] um but it just kind of triggered this
[4:46] thought about visualizing your walk with
[4:48] God there are so many ways
[4:51] to visualize your walk with God
[4:53] and I think God did it all like that on
[4:56] purpose so it ministers to many people
[4:59] many different people from many
[5:01] different walks of life
[5:03] but then it also would encourage us in
[5:06] many different ways
[5:08] so I want to look at that today as we
[5:10] you know try to make our way through
[5:11] Romans 5 and
[5:13] um
[5:14] brother cam asked me he's like does the
[5:16] people like when you preach verse by
[5:18] verse I'm like yeah they seem to like it
[5:19] okay so what do you do you like it do
[5:22] you like my preaching I've only been
[5:25] Pastor in 17 years you all like me
[5:28] I just I feel out of the Holy Spirit to
[5:30] do this and I think there's a lot of
[5:32] power there's you know that's why
[5:33] there's five Gifts of in the fivefold
[5:35] ministry there's power in all five gifts
[5:37] in all five uh
[5:39] preaching gifts there's kind of five
[5:41] different approaches brother Ram talks
[5:43] about it as well in fact I found one
[5:45] quote that yesterday where brother
[5:46] random says you know God brings the word
[5:48] through pastors and teachers
[5:51] but he brings discernment through the
[5:53] prophet you know and if it was just neat
[5:54] to see him say a few words like that and
[5:56] I thought well praise God I like I like
[5:58] all the ways God allows us to think
[6:00] about our lives
[6:03] so as far as we're making our way
[6:04] through the book of Romans you know
[6:05] we're in this third or the second
[6:06] section it's kind of like our third part
[6:08] though uh this this section where we're
[6:10] on justification by faith is the
[6:13] solution for our guilt chapters one and
[6:15] two and three hammered all of us right
[6:17] we're all guilty the Bible said all of
[6:20] our mouths are like an open grave before
[6:23] we get saved
[6:25] right the Bible says we've all fallen
[6:27] short of God's glory
[6:29] we're all worthy of hell right but then
[6:31] Paul breaks in this but we can all be
[6:34] justified by faith like Abraham
[6:37] and he was righteous before he got
[6:40] circumcised
[6:41] before any Works in other words before
[6:43] any works or Obedience of your flesh
[6:45] you're already righteous When You
[6:47] Believe
[6:49] and so we're breaking in this thought
[6:51] path remember this was Paul's way how
[6:53] can I bring heathens Gentiles and
[6:55] legalistic Jews how can I unite them in
[6:58] Christ and this is the leadership of the
[6:59] Holy Spirit
[7:00] this ought to unite all of us whether we
[7:02] come from the message background or no
[7:04] message background
[7:05] denominational background or no
[7:07] denomination background this all unites
[7:09] us here
[7:11] because we're all saved by grace
[7:13] through faith like Abraham we all walk
[7:16] in the past that Abraham walked in
[7:18] praise God as we saw I think that's what
[7:20] I'm going to preach Lord willing I got
[7:21] an invitation to preach out in Iowa I
[7:23] kind of feel led to preach on that
[7:24] Abraham thought
[7:25] maybe on dancing too you know we'll see
[7:28] if
[7:29] I kind of maybe I'll appreciate everyone
[7:30] maybe I'll preach out in Pennsylvania
[7:31] we'll see
[7:33] first time you hear a preacher he
[7:35] preaches on Dancing he dances all around
[7:36] the church who is this guy who led him
[7:38] in
[7:40] he won't be coming back or maybe we want
[7:42] him back
[7:43] so we're looking at this section of
[7:46] justified by faith that's the solution
[7:48] for all of our sin and shame and our
[7:50] guilt
[7:51] so I want to continue to focus on this
[7:53] idea on hope I you know it was so
[7:55] strange on Wednesday I never quite know
[7:58] how the holy spirit is going to guide
[7:59] the sermon I know like sometimes I think
[8:01] I know brother Austin like I think I
[8:02] think God wants him it'll go completely
[8:04] contrary to what I thought or sometimes
[8:06] I'll have all these thoughts and I'm
[8:07] like okay and I preach you all and
[8:09] sometimes I'll have no thoughts and I'll
[8:11] get a thought right before I get to
[8:12] church and I'm scrambling okay what
[8:14] verse what verse what coach
[8:17] but it just you know it's it's it's it's
[8:18] me learning how to walk and continue to
[8:20] learn how to walk in my gift trust the
[8:22] Lord and my gift just like you uh learn
[8:25] to trust God in your gifts and your walk
[8:27] with the Lord like our sister Naomi's
[8:28] testimony just learning to trust God in
[8:29] every situation
[8:31] that's what we're all trying to do
[8:32] praise God throughout every trial like
[8:35] austinina getting married trusting God
[8:37] in this wedding preparations right I
[8:39] mean you can apply it Emma you know
[8:41] Lydia graduation now she got to trust
[8:42] God you could buy to every one of our
[8:44] Lives learning to trust God in whatever
[8:46] situation that we walk in
[8:49] but remember the Bible says this is the
[8:51] four-step divine order
[8:53] for the purpose of your suffering so the
[8:55] whole purpose of suffering is so that
[8:57] you can have hope
[8:59] uh towards the end of your life right or
[9:01] hopefully earlier right we don't want to
[9:04] I mean we want to we want to develop we
[9:05] want to in other words we want to be
[9:06] mature well before the end of our life
[9:09] but this is God's purpose for trials
[9:11] trials will produce patience
[9:14] patience will produce experience which
[9:16] means approved character in other words
[9:19] God looks at your character and said
[9:20] they're a faithful believer
[9:22] and then a faithful believer that will
[9:24] produce hope
[9:28] so here's character means approved I'm
[9:31] sorry here's uh experience means so
[9:34] here's an experience it's the word uh
[9:36] document in Greek it means uh tried
[9:39] character so patience produces
[9:41] experience which is tried character
[9:44] and then the Greek word for Hope is
[9:46] expectation of good
[9:48] in the Christian sense you're joyful and
[9:51] you have a confident ex confident
[9:53] expectation of Eternal salvation
[9:56] that's what I was saying on Wednesday I
[9:57] like to meet message people that are so
[9:59] happy that they're going to heaven
[10:02] it's sad to me message people that have
[10:05] been the message a long time and they
[10:06] have no hope of salvation
[10:08] like I shared that testimony where I you
[10:10] meet people that are raising the message
[10:11] or been the message 40 years and they
[10:13] don't even know if they're saved that's
[10:15] a sad thing to be
[10:16] thank God for the hope of the Holy
[10:19] Spirit praise God
[10:21] now remember you got to have if you have
[10:23] all these if you obey all these steps
[10:24] you'll have hope at the end of your
[10:26] Christian Journey
[10:27] you'll be a mature hopeful Christian
[10:31] you'll be joyful when it's time to go
[10:33] home to be with the Lord you'll be
[10:35] confident I know I'm going to see Jesus
[10:37] I've given my whole life to Jesus where
[10:39] else could I go but to the Lord amen
[10:41] that kind of that kind of confidence
[10:43] even where else could I go praise God
[10:45] I'm on my last breaths here I'm on my
[10:48] deathbed where else could I go accepted
[10:49] Jesus I give my whole life to Jesus amen
[10:52] that's hope
[10:53] right you have a you have a hope an
[10:56] expectation I'm going to see Jesus
[10:58] Hallelujah
[10:59] that's what God wants to mature in our
[11:01] lives
[11:02] and of course you know this is what
[11:04] Jeremiah 29 11 almost everybody's
[11:06] favorite verse uh
[11:09] he said I have plans for you not of evil
[11:13] but to give you an expected end or a
[11:15] hopeful end but how do you get to this
[11:17] end you've got to seek God with all your
[11:19] heart that's why you're here today
[11:20] you're seeking God with all your heart
[11:22] praise God
[11:24] so we so we see hope is also connected
[11:26] to seeking God the more you seek God in
[11:29] church I think we know this to be true
[11:30] the more we prayer the more we read our
[11:32] Bible the more we listen to sermons The
[11:34] more hope we have in God
[11:36] the more assured we are of where we're
[11:38] headed to
[11:40] right the more time we spend with God
[11:41] everybody wants hope everybody wants God
[11:44] to take care of their end but who wants
[11:45] to seek God now
[11:47] hallelujah praise God who wants to put
[11:50] the time in now and and sacrifice and
[11:52] seek God now oh my God
[11:56] Hallelujah so we want to seek God all
[11:58] the way to be born again and stay
[12:00] faithful to God
[12:03] and so we looked at you know how the
[12:04] number four symbolizes Deliverance it
[12:06] also symbolizes a double confirmation
[12:09] also symbolizes an Earthly number as we
[12:11] looked at that on Wednesday night but
[12:13] here's the two thoughts I had after
[12:15] after Wednesday Service as I was praying
[12:17] Wednesday in tears I was closing in I
[12:19] was just thinking about God's grace and
[12:22] how I should not be disappointed with
[12:25] anything in my life
[12:27] I mean yes I can be disappointed in my
[12:29] mistakes but I didn't have my mistakes I
[12:31] couldn't learn
[12:33] I couldn't become a better Christian
[12:36] like if you had no mistakes you'd be pat
[12:38] yourself on the back boy I really did it
[12:40] this week
[12:42] bless you brother Jesse bless you who
[12:44] you you had such a good year this year
[12:46] you know if we had no mistakes we'd be
[12:48] we'd be patting ourselves on the back
[12:50] right
[12:52] so we've got to experience our own
[12:54] disappointments we got to fail in order
[12:56] to appreciate God's grace
[12:59] remember Jesus learned obedience through
[13:02] the things he suffered
[13:04] so we've got to make mistakes so we
[13:06] suffer so we can learn
[13:08] I want to preach you all sermon on that
[13:10] learning learning has become a negative
[13:11] word in the message but the Bible uses
[13:13] it quite
[13:14] positively Jesus learned obedience
[13:19] now I I I agree church I agree there's
[13:21] two kinds of learning there's one
[13:23] learning that's education
[13:24] just sit there okay okay I believe it
[13:27] but there's another kind of learning you
[13:29] learn from experience
[13:31] can I just say like this there's a kind
[13:33] of learning that's human and there's a
[13:35] kind of learning that's revelation
[13:37] Glory
