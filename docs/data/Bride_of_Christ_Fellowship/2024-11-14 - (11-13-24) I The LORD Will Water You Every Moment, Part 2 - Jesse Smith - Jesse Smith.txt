TRANSCRIPT
========================================
finish that here tonight it went so well with brother Cam's message there by God's grace so I the Lord will water you every moment to preach on this here trust it's a blessing to the Saints here Isaiah 27 we'll just read verse three uh together by God's grace 273 me how many believe that God's watering you every moment praise God you're fully in the hand of God hallelujah I believe it with all my heart Hallelujah let's read that together verse three on on three one two three I the Lord do keep it I will water it every moment lest any heard it I will keep it night and day amen may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated by God's grace so I'm going to briefly review here we looked at the context of Isaiah 27 last week and saw it was Israel in the Millennium especially according to the last verse uh of the chapter verse 13 it ends with uh a great trumpet being blown and then all that was uh all that were going to perish are all brought uh from Assyria uh Egypt they're brought to worship at the holy Mount so what time would a great trumpet be blown and heathens would all gather to Jerusalem to worship It could only be the Millennium there's no other time where it would happen right cuz remember we know from Zechariah all the nations are going to come against Israel uh during the tribulation period Every Nation will be gathered against Israel uh but Jesus Christ will deliver Israel Hallelujah so we saw the context of it we saw how God cannot forget Israel just like a uh the Bible said we're ingrained in the palm of his hands uh a woman may forget her suckling child the Bible said but God will never forget Israel and then we saw that God was and is Gathering Israel back to the Homeland uh over 3.5 million have come back uh scattered from different uh Nations and then we saw how the serpent or the leviathon in Isaiah 27 that's to be defeated is Satan that's to be defeated in Revelation 12 during the Great Tribulation period so we see a very striking parallel there to Satan being defeated Leviathan being defeated and then Israel has a time where she's watered day and night Hallelujah uh John 10 then we saw how brother mam combined that brother mam combined John 10 with Isaiah 27 uh and no one will be able to pluck Israel out of God's hand that's how we are right now nobody can pluck us out of the hand of God hallelujah hallelujah especially when we have a high priest who ever lives to make intercession for us glory and then we saw Matthew 20 the 11th Hour workers that's us we saw that we're in the vineyard and that ties in with uh Isaiah 27 because God calls Israel Vineyard that will bring forth red wine Hallelujah that's during the Millennium but we're in the vineyard now because uh Matthew 21 says God took the vineyard away from Hebrews or Jews and gave it to the Gentiles because they rejected uh the Messiah Jesus Christ They Crucified the the owner of the vineyard's son which was the Lord Jesus and then we saw how preachers are workers in the vineyard Paul said 1 Corinthians 3 and then we looked at Proverbs 24 there's a warning against laziness in the vineyard we don't want to be lazy we want to be about the father's business and then we brother we read a quote from Brother BR we have the same Holy Ghost so we have the same power the same uh anointing that was on the early church is on us hallelujah we just have to be yielded and then God does things like he takes away our M our our our Nightmares by God's grace I almost said migraines but yeah he takes that away too hallelujah it's going in Jesus name Hallelujah that's right and so uh then I ended with just a few things uh kind of did really fast quotes at the end I'm going to go a little longer on this now uh if you got your Bible let's go to Isaiah 25 I want you to see the Striking order now to me it's striking just how uh God places things uh in these successive chapters or cons consecutive chapters I was telling sister Zur about this briefly uh I just thought it would be interesting to show you uh so Isaiah 25:8 now after I read this I want you to say it out loud what event is this Isaiah 25:8 he will swallow up death in Victory and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the Earth the Lord has spoken it Rapture very good that's because uh 1 Corinthians 15:54 says death will be swallowed up in Victory right so now look at the consecutive order now this doesn't happen very much right especially with Isaiah Isaiah is all over the place right got a virgin shall conceive in chapter 7 and nine uh you got John the Baptist in Isaiah 35 uh but here look at 25 26 27 28 uh Isaiah CH 26: 20 and 21 now you can take a guess but you don't have to but take a guess read let's read Isaiah 26:20 and 21 now the previous 19 verses aren't about this but I think we can read this and understand what this is about come my people enter thou into my thy Chambers and shut thy doors about thee hide thyself as it were for a little moment sounds like a little season or like a time times and half a time right until the ignation be overpassed not so God's going to hide Israel until the Wrath is passed for behold the Lord cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the Earth for their iniquity the Earth also shall disclose her blood and shall no more cover her slain what event do you think this is tribulation very good so look we got so far we got the right order we got the Rapture in 25 we got the tribulation in 26 27 we already know what that is that's the millennium so so far we got three in a row now that that's the end of it now because chapter 28 verse 11 and 12 after I read this say say this event if you know this event Isaiah 28 11- 12 for with stammering lips in another tongue will he speak to this people to whom he said this is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear what event was that day of Pentecost very good everybody give yourself too there we got some good Bible uh Bible scholars right you because we know the order so it's just interesting to me 25 26 27 we're in the right order 28 this is the day of Pentecost according to 1 Corinthians 1421 with stammering lips Paul said Paul quotes Isaiah 2811 and then this is the rest the rest was spoken of at Hebrews 4 1-11 Paul said ENT he said labor to enter into this rest because he said he said Israel already has a rest it's not the natural rest it's a spiritual rest Hallelujah and then this is the refreshing that's acts 3:19 Peter said this is the times of refreshing that will come from the Lord hallelujah the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah so what again what do we see God hides these things from the eyes of the wise and prudent God can put these verses in any order and that's what God does he puts them in any order right it's like the puzzle pieces it's like the box of puzzle pieces right that's like the Bible Hallelujah right and you just got to it takes the Holy Spirit to take the verses put them in the right order now you can see the picture of of Prophecy Hallelujah so I thought you like that everybody like that by God's grace neat it's very interesting to see how God places these events in here now I want to uh let's go to John 4 I just want to this help brother Irvin last year actually that was the the the day that I got attacked by the demon power but uh thank God for a faithful wife who will pray for you uh John 4 of course is the Samaritan woman um verse uh 22 says ye worship you know not what Jesus talking to the woman for we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews she was a Samaritan right half Jew half Gentile really half Babylonian right or half Assyrian because that the Bible said we we showed that they brought Babylonians uh for salvation is of the Jews uh but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and Truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him I'm sorry I got a little dry throat verse 24 God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth okay now uh go in verse 25 the woman sayith to him I know that Messiah cometh which is called Christ and when he has come he will tell us all things verse 26 Jesus said to her I that speak unto thee am he Hallelujah so I I just love this uh uh you know brother Bram told us all the things we need to have the Holy Ghost right and so Jesus tells the woman here all she needs to have the Living Water right and so I love it uh brother Ram finished the mysteries of God he turned our hearts back to the apostolic fathers thank you dear wife I appreciate that gonna ask somebody thank you awesome were you going to get that thank thank you thank you it's always during this fall time yes thanks good race kind of surprised she won though brother so just just kidding just kidding brother thank you for thinking about me brother I appreciate that now I wanted to go back to verse 14 though but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst right and I was I preach that I preached that thought when brother irin was here the thought was you'll never thirst for the things of the world talking about your soul your flesh constantly wants the things of the world your mind gets tempted to think about oh I need this things of the world but Jesus said when you get this water you'll never thirst again it's speaking of you'll never thirst to live like you used to live hallelujah praise God right you'll you'll only thirst in the soul you'll only thirst to be like Christ Hallelujah so again remember God is watering he's constantly watering and so see we have we have a thirst for the water but it's got to be the The Thirst from the soul and we want to beat this flesh and and and train this mind to so all three parts of us thirst for the water of God hallelujah all right so that helped brother Irvin to see that that's the part we'll never thirst like we used to as Sinners and Jesus gave the woman the water right it was you're the Messiah right and and that's what I love about this you know I'll just say I think you don't know I think you know what I'm talking about once I heard this message I never thirsted to go back to denomination only to witness to them right and try to convince them that there's more you know right so that that's what happening here Jesus gives her the present truth the message of the hour and she doesn't thirst for those things anymore now she's satisfied because she knows she's got thus sayi the Lord hallelujah because Jesus was the Lord amen and that's what brother randam gave to us right brother Ram gave us thus sayi the Lord on all these topics on all the truth and it gives us overcoming power in fact I was listening to brother cam last Wednesday when he preached he was preaching on the godhead and brother brah said the godhead gives you so much strength because you know who God is amen right we just we just met another person recently who said I know who the father is a son is but I have no idea who the Holy Ghost is and they've been going to church for years I worked with a person her name was Sandy she told me that and then we recently I forget who it was somebody else told me that too it's the same idea that most churches don't know about the Holy Ghost but when you're talking to God the Father when you're talking to Jesus you're talking to the Holy Ghost because that's the spirit of God hallelujah there's only one Spirit hallelujah it's three manifestations but the same spirit that gives us strength to know who we serve gives us strength to know that when we talk to Jesus is actually giving us intercession to the Father the Holy Spirit praise God so it takes away all the questions Hallelujah it gives us strength to know who he who God Is Now John 7:37 here's the one here's the one you'll never thirst again because God puts this Fountain inside you I just want to just State this again in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried If any man thirst let him come unto me and drink so I love that the invitations to anybody uh I invited brother Chris back to church he said I'll try to come on Wednesday so thanks for telling me about that I'm trying to get him to come back to church all right just like you buddy Hallelujah trying to get him that soul back in here hallelujah but but see he's invited back everybody's invited to drink Hallelujah Jesus didn't say well just these certain race or that that age or that gender you know uh but everybody's invited he that believeth on me as the scripture said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water I love those moments don't you don't you love those moments when you know God has heard your prayer or God has heard your praise God has accepted your worship or God has given you a testimony to witness to somebody or to sing a song for God and you know God was in that it's like it was just flowing out of you that's that's God taking over that's God's word that that's God's promise to you Hallelujah that God's going to water you day and night hallelujah amen because it's inside of you the water is actually inside in your soul but this fake key of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jes Jesus was not glorified Hallelujah glory to God now church so we we need to reme we just need to remember this the water that I have need of is inside of me and I got to let it uh flow out of me Hallelujah just like that song that gratitude come up my soul don't you get shy on me right and really it's never the soul shy it's the mind that shy what are people going to think if I shout or scream or praise the Lord or if I if I give God Glory uh it's your mind that gets shy so we got to forget about our feelings and we got to remember we're in the presence of the king we're entertaining the king tonight Hallelujah we only care what the king thinks about us hallelujah right when it all comes down to it Hallelujah so we must remember that and the Bible says stir up your Most Holy Faith through prayer right Peter says stir up the gift of God stir up your pure Minds by way of remembrance so see that's how we get ourselves sred up remember what you used to be remember how you used to serve God uh but then also pray right prayer stirs up uh stirs up your your mind so you can receive what God has from the soul hallelujah oh I love it Hallelujah when God gives you something on your heart and God gives you like when God put this on my heart even as I was studying I just felt it flowing out it's kind of one of those things if you're a musician you know about it you know it just kind it just kind of flows right oh this here and then that it's all it's just all time together it's all flowing together it's flowing out Hallelujah now that's right now so when your Soul's thirsty you got to cry out to God and he gives us a drink so we see in Psalms 42:1 if you have your Bibles we're going to be reading in three portions of the Psalms and brother cam sent me a nice message on Monday just to say how much he enjoyed fellowship with everybody so thank you for your support and he said you just have a real sweet church so I said that's right we do got a real sweet Church let's keep it that way right by God's grace Psalm 42:1 to the chief musician maskill for the sons of Kora as the heart panteth after the water Brooks so panteth my soul after thee oh God now the word Pat means to long for like a you know like an animal longing for water right and so uh even David in the Old Testament had these times when when his his soul was longing for more of God and that's what we need we need to long for more of God right and we can do it every day the Bible said we should be hungering and thirsting after righteousness verse two my soul thir for God see for the Living God When shall I come and appear before God so we need to stop and feel the panting of the Soul because the world has filled our minds with so many distractions and we got to quiet ourselves down just to feel the thirst of the soul my uh I'd like a real fresh drink out of the Bible I'd like to read a few chapters this morning I've been reading through Ezekiel it's been powerful I'm gonna Lord willing maybe I'll preach on Ezekiel pretty soon too it's been powerful just to see again wow all these things out of the scripture and the the creatures did you know where stomping preaching comes from it comes from Ezekiel God told Ezekiel stand there and stomp and cry out thus sayith the Lord where did The Stomping preachers come from Ezekiel it was really good I i' never seen that before just like uh where did the pulpit come from Ezra remember Ezra built a Pulpit and he stood up there all day when they finally got the walls built around in there rebuilt in Jerusalem was zable and he read the word of God all day and all the kids women and children everybody had to hear him read from the PO amen I like it I like to know where I originated from Hallelujah where did this Holy Ghost religion originate from right in the scripture hallelujah amen where the shout religion originate when the angels of God shouted for Joy when God founded the Earth Hallelujah we got the oldest shout religion is the oldest religion there is Glory see the soul thirsts and is Satisfied by coming to appear before God if you want to see me happy talk to me right after church right because that's what the Bible says my soul thirst for God When shall I appear before God verse three three my tears have been my meat day and night while they continue to say to me where is thy God when I remember these things I pour out my soul unto him so when I'm wondering Where's God and I need to I need to come and appear before God when we do that we come before God and we pour out our soul and our desire before God for I had gone with a multitude I went with them to the house of God with a voice of joy and praise with a multitude kept the holy day so remember three times a year the males were required to come to the the Tabernacle or the temple only three times a year see we got it good we get to come every week twice a week three times a week the Old Testament they didn't come that much What a Sad life that was amen but see we get to come before the house of God and so uh the writer would say my when we start traveling and we knew it was going to be the Sabbath we maybe on a Friday we start traveling we we we' meet more and more people going up to the house of God that's how we should feel when we come in here and shake hands like when I saw Austin I said Hey brother God bless you quick update you know God heard your prayers this week yes God heard your prayers I said glory to God right it makes you happy right this is what they experience in the physical so if you see somebody out in the parking lot makes you happy ah they made it back to the house of God hallelujah right that was just it was just a natural thing these things stir us up it makes us happy if they had in the Old Testament we should have much more in the New Testament praise God because better promises verse five why art thou cast down on my soul why as thou quieted me hope thou in God for yet I shall praise him for the help of his countenance see so why you cast down you know God's going to help you right and you know you'll yet praise God you know eventually this will pass and then I'll praise God again Hallelujah see but see the we got to slow down so our souls pants pants after God Longs for God and then we have to remember we'll be satisfied when we come to appear before God and we have joy with all of God's people people all right go to Psalm uh sorry Psalm 36 I'm sorry sorry Psalm 631 forgive me I'm trying to go too fast Psalm 631 I got slow down a Psalm of David when he was in the word of Judah oh God Thou Art my God early will I seek thee my soul thirst is for thee my flesh longth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is so he's in desperation so when we get in desperation that's when God's really going to show up right brother man preached a sermon 1963 desperation listen to it if you haven't done it you know brother goes through like all these Old Testament Bible characters every time they got desperate God showed up right uh Moses you know at the Red Sea they were desperate God showed up Israel needs to be changed he wrestled with God God showed up Hallelujah Noah got desperate God showed up and he finally sent the rain amen you know he goes through all the desperations that's what David says when I'm desperate I he said I'll seek you verse two to see thy power and their Glory as I've seen in My Sanctuary because now remember he would he saw it because he was a he was a writer so brother Austin while he was writing songs it would be in the church and he would prophesy when he got the song and that was power God stepped down and used my gift how many times are you Sayang brother the Holy Ghost fell right a couple times now it's been really wonderful right same thing with Malachi sing a song everybody I can hear your voices I'm like okay oh this is another level now worship you know right is it's it's God comes down we see his power like I like I knew when we prayed for Haven I knew God did something right there right I really felt that I remember I told her I said God heard your prayer I remember I told you that that's awesome to see that and I I don't I don't feel that all the time but there's times where you know God steps down I've seen his power Hallelujah I've seen him come down in the sanctuary Hallelujah right David longed for that because thy loving kindness is better than life my lip shall praise thee now remember he's out in the wilderness but he's remembering oh God I'm longing to feel you come down like you did in the sanctuary and I know you're full of love I know your love is greater than my life what I'm going through thus will I bless bless thee while I live I'll lift up my hands in thy name see we must thirst for his power and His glory and his past love motivates us to praise him now because we know he'll do it again amen he'll do it again Hallelujah now Psalm 84 is where I really want to get to Jesus speaks here I'm sorry yeah Jesus speaks also of sparrows but uh Psalm 84:1 to the chief musician upon GTH a psalm for the sons of Kora how amiable that means beautiful are thy Tabernacles oh lord of hosts now our church we got a pretty nice building here I don't know if we'd call it beautiful it's a nice brick building but it all depends how you look at it if you look at it as a House of healing or a house of power a house of God's glory then this is a beautiful place Hallelujah not so much the building but it's what God does there in the building he said my soul Longs yes even faints for the courts of the Lord my heart my flesh crith out for the Living God oh God you're alive oh God do something God we're here to worship you speak to us hallelujah yay the sparrow hath found in house and the swallow a nest for herself where she may lay her young even thine altars oh lord of hosts my king and my God so David would even see and these these workers they would see even birds make their nest in the literal the physical House of God and he remembers wow God and and he they let the birds stay there they didn't push the birds away from God's house they even let the birds hang around God's house they wanted the birds to be blessed Hallelujah right he said even the sparrow no so David was longing for the house of God he says yes even the sparrow has a house and and even they can kind of Roost around the altars of God blessed are they that dwell in thine house so he's not even you know God even lets The Sparrows come to the house of God how I'm longing to get back to the house of God he said they will be still praising thee now that means say loud that means continually so in other words they're so blessed those birds are so blessed to be there at the house of God and they sing right and their song glorifies God hallelujah they they're there at the house of God they're continually praising thee we should be the happiest people brother says because we get to continually praise God we get to worship God we get to love God in fact a woman this week come by my children saw she dumped all this food in back of my uh my car I mean it was like five or six maybe seven bags all this pounds of food and I said what are you doing this for she said every time I see you you just encourage me I was like okay and I said well that's the Lord amen but you know it's it's because we're constantly praising the Lord amen people see a difference in your life Hallelujah there anybody that needs some yogurt after church you see me okay she gave me some yogurt cheese I think I left the cheese at home there uh it's just interesting just why why why would somebody do that but see if we're blessed if we go to God's house and we continually praise God if the devil's bad and you're about come to church press through that and praise God and when you get here don't let the devil take away your praise give God some praise Hallelujah you'll feel better everybody will feel better Hallelujah right it's the happiest place you want be blessed is the man whose strength is in thee and whose heart are the ways of them who passing through the valley of baka now there's a certain Valley called Baka and as they'd pass they remember they'd walk to Jerusalem or they they'd walk to the temple or the Tabernacle and uh God as they're passing as they're walking God would send the rains and fill the pool so their animals had water so even they they would notice wow even as we're going to church we're getting Showers of Blessings There It Is God watering them day and night Hallelujah amen amen at a time when my animals are travel with me let's say we got to travel three three days or whatever to get to the house of God while we would go God would send rain to water our our our animals and make the way easier he'd refresh us as we go to the house of God and then we get refreshed at the house of God hallelujah there's all these blessings to the house of God you can see it plainly church has God ever filled you with love on the way to church there's been many times listen to brother Bram are listen to a song I'm ready to go I'm driving down it's a Sunday morning I'm driving down I'm singing Glory to God people driving by looking at me like why you got your hand up in the car I'm like praise the Lord hallelujah right you get it's it's a it's a spiritual thing God's blessing you God's filling you up so when you get there you're ready to worship praise God glory they go from what strength to strength we should get stronger as we serve God every one of them in Zion appear before God right Zion yeah oh Lord God of hosts hear my prayer give ear oh god of Jacob say la behold oh God our shield and look upon the face of thine anointed so see I'm Anointed with praise I'm anointed God's made me happy I'm coming to the house of God the spirit of God is upon me Hallelujah behold oh God our shield and look upon the face of th anointed verse 10 for in for a day in thy course is a better than a thousand I'd rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of the wicked so it's if someone tried to offer to to take you out to some drug house tonight or even a bar tonight and they gave you the choice of that watching the big game or whatever or or just opening the door right that was your only job just to open the door it'd be better just to open the door so the Saints can come in and they can be continually praising God hallelujah that one day the one day of just opening the door I remember when I first became a deacon at brother brother Brooks's church I was so happy it was like the happiest thing my life just to open the door for all these saints come on into the church I I took such joy in it it was such a privilege because before when I was younger I never wanted to go to church but now I get to open the doors and let the moms and the dads the children come on in and praise the Lord I must have been the happiest Deacon there was there it was such a joy because I used to not want to go into the church but now it's my duty open the doors for the house of God it was a joy it still is a joy amen it's better to be in the house of God one day than a thousand and elsewhere right so one day is better than three years out in the Wicked with the wicked right one day is so much greater this day today is a great day Hallelujah you should feel happy about today Hallelujah almost every morning Zion comes in sits on my lap he said Daddy is this a church day is this a is this a morning church or night church day I said it's a night church day today buddy because that's kind of how they or think of their lives right all their lives revolve around coming to church that's rightly so Hallelujah but notice uh he speaks of the sparrow I want to just look at the Sparrow real quick the in the Bible the sparrow symbolizes God's care and attention to even the smallest seemingly insignificant Creature if God will let a little Sparrow dwell in his house and be blessed and not push him away how much more does God care about you and I Hallelujah Jesus talks about this uh in Matthew 10 he says are not too sparrows sold for a penny yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside of your father's care so you know if God sees a little Sparrow a little tiny Bird fall down God sees when you fall down and if God no notices that bird God notices all your moves as well Hallelujah this is God trying to remind us of how important and Jesus even says you are more valuable than a sparrow right what an encouragement to remember how valuable you are in the sight of God hallelujah he Jesus even said in Luke 12 yet not one of them is forgotten by God God remembers and feeds that little Sparrow or those those barn swallows you see in the barns right God feeds them how much more is he going to feed us I'm talking about spiritual and natural right we need natural no doubt but spiritual as well so see sparrows remind us that God's care is always on the little things and also on us even in our moments of struggle when they when we might feel unnoticed like we might see we might seem so little in the mind of God well how could God care about me I'm a little or nothing I'm this or that but yet Jesus says God does notice you and God knows the hairs on your head Hallelujah so the sparrow represents God's detailed knowledge and his loving provision and uh conveys us message of comfort and reassurance about his unwavering presence and the value of your life am Hallelujah God lets the sparrow like we heard that beautiful song on Sunday I I've been singing that song all day yesterday and that Sparrow song Hallelujah such a such a wonderful song The Sparrow found a house I found a house I found the house of God hallelujah and I will dwell in the house of God all the days of my life Hallelujah that's one thing I've desired Hallelujah to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life look at uh Psalm 8411 for the Lord th God is a sun and shield you all know without the sun there's no life so God's saying I'm your life and and see connects it to going to worship uh hungering and thirsting after God longing for God so see God's going to water us if we go get the water right Hallelujah we see we see it God's a son and he's a shield so God is shining his power upon us but God's also a shield right against all the darts of the enemy praise God he's my son he's my light he's my heat he's my strength he's my health but he's also my shield to stop Every Lie of Satan the Lord will give Grace and Glory now look at this church no good thing everybody say no good thing ready no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly so whatever you have have it's a good thing Austin got a good thing when you got married brother so did I we all did that right when we got married God gave us good things Hallelujah and even our jobs and you know uh our children and our family and and our influence you know all these things God give to us they're all good things so if we don't have something yet God's either planning to give it to us or we got to change our desire for the will of God right because he said he will not withhold it in other words he'll give you everything that's good he said he'll work everything for good Hallelujah he's talking about going to church right he's going about worshiping he's talking about worshiping God going getting stronger and stronger Glory going up to the house of God getting stronger stronger uh being blessed continually praising God God promises I'll give you everything that's good for you verse 12 oh lord of hosts blessed is a man that trusts in thee like that song uh brother Nia requested that song on Sunday night I trust in God my savior Hallelujah I like that said brother Nia what song do you want to sing brother he said trust in God I said amen hallelujah I like that so see we get this uh look at this encouragement from the scripture here about how God sees us see he if he if he takes care of the sparrow the littlest tiniest little bird then surely he'll take care of us you know Sparrow I was looking at a few scientific facts that they don't have a a big chance to live that's why there's so many they have so many little babies uh I think only like four out of 10 survive you know within a few years they're just so small and they they're easy prey you know for Predators but yet God knows about each and every one of them God knows about what we need God knows what we're going to go through God's already provided in advance he knows what we need and he said just ask me for it I'll go I'll do it for you I'll give it to you Hallelujah just ask cuz I'm not going to withhold anything that's good from your life Hallelujah well I need more miracles God's got it for you amen if if it's God's will right I need more power I need more witnesses or I need more testimony whatever God will God will give it to you if you uh draw nigh to God God will draw nigh to you Hallelujah he takes care of the sparrow he takes care of you and I we're more valuable Church than sparrows Hallelujah I want to read a few quotes about where brother Ram cites Isaiah 27 I read a few last week brother ramam says he says uh God interprets his own word he said I am the Lord I planted it I water it day and night lest some should pluck it from my hand he said another scripture he watched over his word to perform it now this is what I liked perform it reveal it to his elected to those that it sent to see that sent to see it rather he performs it to those who are sent to see it he watches over it keeps it away from all the foolish carnal interpretations he says that's right he said that's right that's right God God is right God's identified person all them Pharisees could have stood up and said we're of God we have the laws we have this and there stood the word itself said away with it crucify it it don't identify itself with what we believe but Jesus identified himself with the word and those who had eyes to see saw it those who were blind mind did not see it okay so what I want to draw to here is that God keeps his word away from the fools in other words God's not going to water them because they don't want the water right and God identifies his person and in this day God didn't identify or Roberts or Kenneth copen as a genuine prophet of God God identified William brandom Hallelujah right William brandham was the one that said uh thus sayith the Lord this nation is going to go completely insane brother brandom said that and look what look what happened to him I mean that was a prophet of God none of these other guys said anything like that they don't even get close to saying anything like that and God will perform his word you and I just must put our faith in the word of God because God will back it up all right let's read them uh Jeremiah 1 11 and 12 moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying Jeremiah what seest thou and I said I see a rod of an almond tree then said the Lord unto me thou Hast seen well for I will hasten my word to perform it okay so when God was dealing with the prophet God said here's a symbol of an almond tree I'm going to perform this so I just want you to see this there's times there's times God lets promises linger but then God says but now there's a time I'm going to perform that word right he promised to wat us day and night but brother brings us out he all he takes a time where he performs the word of God hallelujah Ezekiel 25 I'm sorry Ezekiel 12:25 he says almost the same thing to Ezekiel for I am the Lord I will speak and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass it shall be no more prolonged for in your days o rebellious house will I say the word and will perform it saith the Lord God hallelujah so that's what God did in brother Ram's ministry right God performed Luke 17:30 in brother Ram's Ministry a son of man a prophet Ministry God performed uh revelation 10:7 God finished the mysteries of God hallelujah amen God performed it now what are we looking for what what performance are we looking for well we're looking for the finishing of the Great Commission right we're looking for the message through the internet unless we become missionaries we're looking for the internet or to send missionaries to take the gospel to people that have never heard it like Junction City Saints Hallelujah right or God to send us out like God sent Austin out to get the elect seed sister Lena Hallelujah right God had to send him out there to bring the elect seed to him because God knows where his children are Hallelujah see that's what we're seeing we're seeing God finishing the Great Commission that's what we're seeing now the main thing we're looking for is rapturing Faith right okay but we know God has to finish all he he he will perform his word hallelujah now one more First Kings 611 First Kings 611 you're really fast there Cas good job and the word Lord came to Solomon saying concerning this house which Thou Art building if thou will walk in my statutes and execute my judgments and keep all of my Commandments to walk in them then will I perform my word with thee which I spake unto David thy father and I will dwell among the children of Israel and will not forsake My People Israel so see this is when God performs his word when we obey the word of God if we can just obey the word of God then God will perform it but remember first of all it's got to be a revelation that's a verse for you right my we were listening to a sermon last night and the preacher said A good sermon until he just said a few things he said uh he said any positive mental attitude toward any promise of God will bring it to pass and Haven said no it's got to be the will of God and I said amen sister Haven right because remember think about think about Paul you know he had that eye trouble and the demons were buffeting a a positive mental attitude wasn't going to wasn't going to take that away Jesus allowed that to Humble him right now eventually God probably did but we're talking about God's perfect will we have to know the will of God hallelujah so if God reveals something to us it's his will then we know we just got to wait on it and then God will perform it hallelujah it's like I told you that brother who prayed 10 years to have a church in akan God finally performed it and look where we was stand in 18 years we been standing on the word of God now that's that's that's awesome to me Hallelujah I mean wouldn't Lena like a a message church right in there in Lake havu wouldn't she like that it' take a real work of God wouldn't it it'd have to be the will of God because you got to find labors who are willing to labor right so see see how Supernatural it is just to have a church in acan It's Supernatural and this whole time he's sitting right there at Kenmore walking up and down the streets of Kenmore why am I in akan or you know I'm going to the SAR someday right you are brother Hallelujah see God God has to perform his word hallelujah and I want to just encourage the church with this brother R says in uh spiritual food and du season 1965 brother's talking about he's closing the sermon and he's talking about when he first established the brandham Tabernacle and they said when it came up the people of the city said within the space of six months this will be a garage he said we had $180 to build a tabernacle a lot of the garbage people done decided it was going to be I'm sorry a lot of the garage people decided it was going to be their garage but it's still a sheep pen for God's sheep he says now I the Lord have planted it I will water it day and night L some lest some should pluck it up from my hand look at the criticism no denomination to back up as church and who do we got to back us up nobody we got a denomination backing us up no sir right we got heaven backing us up he says there's no churches like ours around the country here no Pentecost in the country nothing else will sustain it everybody against the water baptism everybody against all these things even to my own family my own daddy turned me away from the door Hallelujah I I got my clothes in a little paper sack and went and lived in New Albany right but through many dangersous toils and snares I have already come it's grace that brought me this far and it's Grace he he said I'm 56 years old I'm soon got the cross over the river and Grace will lead me home he says he's talking about God taking the Tabernacle when everybody was against it and they were still against it and yet God promised he uses Isaiah 27 to show God's going to water us day and night if we just drink the water God will sustain us hallelujah has haven't we seen that my wife have we seen that for 18 years God has sustained us for 18 years never once I've ever been disappointed coming to church right because each time I leave here happy joyful like I said talk to me if you want to see me happy talk to me after church Hallelujah that's what the Bible said you'll be continually pray you'll be blessed right we can all look at our lives we're more blessed to serve God we're so blessed to come to God's house if we miss it's like we're cursed right if we if we if we just you know not not us necessarily but people that won't come to church they they have to feel cursed right they feel far away from God that's what yeah brother Austin told me that remember on your testimony you said you knew as soon as you left church it would never be the same till you got back right you wouldn't be real really blessed till you got back and wasn't that the truth brother that was a thought that was a good thought right there that's a really good thought because that's what the Bible says they that dwell in the courts of God will be blessed brother ra said look we can apply we can apply Isaiah 27 to our own little church God will keep feeding us he won't abandon us he won't leave us alone he'll always water us he'll always keep us he'll protect us nobody can hurt the Gospel of Jesus Christ he says it again the next month and knowth it not 1965 he's praying dear Jesus actually this is the beginning of the sermon we're grateful for the privilege that we have of assembling together here how many grateful especially after covid right really grateful and oh as I looked upon the Tabernacle early this morning after midnight I passed by I thought of how you have stood by it so every time I come to this church I thank God lord how you how have you stood by our little church he said I think of the Old Pond that was here so Bram Tabernacle we were there this summer there used to be a pond right there girls there was a pond he said there was a pond there big old weed standing up right about where this pulpits at as the little boy I stood here Mr Ingram said we could have the lot for just a little money and pay something down and no money no collateral no nothing to offer but to try it so see we know God if God wants us to have a building God will open up the same thing like them they had no money they they were a very poor Church they had $180 brother Austin but see God put it on their the man's heart I'll give you this no interest you can just buy it see that's when I know God won want us to build a church or buy a church when it's supernatural right when it's just a right deal like remember cam remember cam story about getting that car what my wife was just talking about remember cam cam drove that was it explore okay so he was he prayed beforehand Lord give me give me favor if if you want if you want me to have this vehicle for my grown family when he got there the guy I think what was it like 10,000 okay it's like 10,000 Cam's like okay praise the Lord cam didn't even ask him to take it down he's like you know what let's I'll sell it for nine cam keeps talking to him by the time they're done talking the guy's like I'll give it to you for five and cam didn't have to ask or beg right God just that is Supernatural like if God wants you to have something he'll withhold no good thing from you and I hallelujah amen see we don't want to push and try to be selfish and try to do things our way we got to let God open things up Hallelujah we got to let God bless us but then we got to be patient at the same time because it can't come in my time and season it's got to come in God's time and season he says he says and then as a fullface value was a little over $2,000 boy I wish I could buy a property for $2,000 with 20 years to pay it out what a loan 20 years no interest that's how you know it was God he said and now Lord he's praying now Lord look at it now and while it was in its infancy still sitting in a hole here water pouring into it how that you promise US by the word so brother had some Vision on the night of the the on on the day they laid the the the the Cornerstone he quotes Isaiah 27 I the Lord have planted it I'll Water it day and night lest some pluck it up out of my hands the same time the people said within 6 months it'll be turned into a garage but literally thousands of souls have have found Christ at this altar we've had a few by God's grace I'll take whatever God sends us hallelujah and the Tabernacle the baptistry has constantly had people been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Calling upon his name washing away their sins hundreds of crippled Afflicted blind Hal lame cancere eaten have walked away from this platform come and dying men and women boys and girls and gone out to live a new life with a new flesh on their bodies walking again leave the wheelchairs crutches and so forth oh God this 30 years of service Father I remember the morning we laid the Cornerstone and you gave me the vision over there showing the place packed and jammed a beautiful corner I knew that that could not fail so I thank you for all these things Hallelujah see the thing to do is remember if God's called you to something God will give you a vision for it and God won't withhold anything good from you and you just have to take you have to take confidence that Isaiah 27 is the vision for your life too God's going to water me God's going to protect me God's going to keep me and he's going to do it every moment hallelujah amen I didn't set the timer but I know it's almost 8 o'clock all right Hallelujah now I want to uh go a few more thoughts here now uh last week I mentioned the former lad of rain but I just want to go a little bit deeper on this here I believe we're still getting watered by the former rain now that might seem shange to people uh strange but brother ad's Ministry he calls it the former Reign the latter Reign is rapturing Faith okay now people will definitely totally disagree I know preachers I've heard them already preach I know they'll disagree with me that's fine they can believe whatever they want I'm going to believe whatever I want because I see it in the word of God this this makes more sense than anything else because we're still learning the message somebody raise up on the internet and tell me you understand all the message that's the only way that the for that the former Reign would be over you've learned everything who's learned everything in the message if you are now you learned you learned the wrong thing you learned Pride you see what I mean like it's a teaching the the the the Greek I'm sorry the Hebrew word in Joel 2 is Mora which means teaching Reign right and then comes the Harvest rign which brother calls rapturing Faith so see God is still watering us teaching us to believe the word of God remind aren't you glad he reminds us that Jesus is still on the throne like on Sunday and aren't you glad he reminded you faith is your Victory how many get victory over that Temptation how many going to get victory over this situation faith will give you the victory and it's not your faith it's the gift of God of faith that Christ gave you it's the faith of the Son of God see that's why brother Ram called his ministry the teaching Reign we're still learning to walk under the anointing of the Holy Ghost we're still learning the message and I'll say like this no one is Anointed with rapturing faith right now because no one's being raptured now church I know this I know remember I read Romans 8 a few weeks ago if you're already Justified then you're already glorified I know the Rapture is already in you right I know the Rapture is already in me but there's a special anointing that falls for rapturing Faith everybody knows that if that wasn't the case if we already had rapturing faith in us who wouldn't speak themselves into a Rapture already if you had that ability right the potentials are in you the promises in you the the seed the seeg gene of God to that will produce it is in you but you need a special Reign that's why the Bible said former and latter reain and message royalty I'll say like Billy Paul these are men are dying but more people are dying no one's being raptured so how can rapturing Faith be here if everybody's dying right and other message royalty families like big names big names around the message all their family members are dying no one's being raptured so how can rapturing Faith be here the rapturing faith is the anointing for the body change and I'll say like this false doctrines among message Believers prove they still need the former rain and I know I kind of get less amens on that because it's I'm more dealing with the needs out there and you everybody gets loudest when I'm dealing with the needs in here so I'm I'm just making a point okay so you understand for example The Junction City saying sa need the former Reign because they just came in the message that's why I tried to lay in there on 17 trips right laying there just the foundation don't don't the last one I I said the Bible's the absolute not brother Bram brother bram's poin to the absolute the absolute means all powerful that's Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is the absolute see they need that they need that teaching they need the anointing so they don't get a a seducing Spirit to pull them away from the church truth the the former rain is still falling in my humble opinion Hallelujah I see it falling amen I and if church and if time goes on we'll continue to see it fall on them so they don't fall into these false doctrines like Prosperity stuff and worship in the tapes and Joseph bram's a prophet all these false doctrines they won't fall into that because they're getting the reign of the holy spirit for teaching Hallelujah just like I needed the former Reign back in 200 1 in 2002 my wife knows boy did I need the teaching rain I need somebody to teach me to cut my hair I need somebody teach me to stop being addicted to chewing tobacco and dirty movies and all these kind of things and sports don't worship Sports as Idols I need a lot of teaching rain thank God it fell Hallelujah so remember church this rain is still falling God promised to teach you if you just have a learner's Heart Right Jesus said come and learn of me he said but I'm meek and lowly of heart he's real humble right he'll he'll teach you if you're willing to humble yourself hallelujah oh it's so true so true now I'm going to the thought where in uh Isaiah 27:2 he said it'll be like red wine so Israel when it's water day and night it's going to produce wine we are water day and night we have the wine of stimulation of Revelation Hallelujah so in other words if something can preach made you joyful that was stimulation you had some wine on Sunday is anybody guilty of drinking spiritual wine on Sunday I hope so I saw some people crying that was good I saw some people shouting I was shouting I shout so much my throat really hurt on Monday amen shouting too much I felt like I told the family I felt like I preached on Sunday night I was like oh my goodness I said so many amens I felt good and that that's what God promised to do to give you wine to give you revelation right so you can understand the things of God uh our uh our wine is the Holy Ghost acts 213 said others said these men are full of new wine but Peter stood up and said uh verse 15 but these are not drunken as you suppose seeing it's a third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel Glory I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh Hallelujah now brother Ram says in the third seal brother Ram's preaching on the oil and wine now Revelation 66 is the third seal and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four Beast say a measure of wheat for a penny remember the Catholic church was going to capture the wealth of the world and three measures of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine okay so brother Ram reads his scripture and he says he says you hear me say I feel religious that's what's the matter the simulation is so bad just about ready to go cutting up you know simul ation from Revelation did you know whenever you feel like dancing or shouting or something brother ram calls that cutting up I'm just going to cut up a little bit and praise God I just feel so joyful about the word of God hallelujah sorry L if I'm clapping too loud that that's better but when when you just feel so joyful you got to like let out a shout Or Glory or Hallelujah butam said you're feeling religious you're stimulated by the wine Hallelujah he said they on the day of Pentecost they became so stimulated by Revelation that they Vindicated the promise of Joel and that's what we need we need to get so simulated so we vindicate some promise of God in here like lay hands on the sick they shall recover cast out Devils if someone comes in here demon possessed Hallelujah get so stimulated to you're you're revelated to vindicate the word of of God that's what say oh I love this this is so beautiful he said oh my they broke out the joy of simulation till the people said they're drunk on new wine when God revealed his promise to them and not only did he reveal it but he proved it Hallelujah now brother gets into the third seal and he says he says in other words like this Jesus is saying if you catch some of my little flock that's filled with oil wine of the oil of the pure word and you're going to kill them now remember he's talking to the the Dark Ages because it was the it was the Black Horse and you're going to kill them you're doing that that's what you're doing don't you force them to say any hail mares or anything like that or some of your Creeds you keep your hands off them they know where they're going for they're Anointed with my oil and by being Anointed with my oil they have the wine of Joy because they know the word of my promise I'm going to raise them up again am brother R said Jesus said don't hurt that don't try to go messing with them just keep away from them Hallelujah so there's that same idea of hurting Isaiah 273 said nothing will hurt them and here in the New Testament Jesus says nothing will hurt your oil and wine remember it's like that it's that scripture says whatever you receive whatever you whatever you get in church it'll never be taken from you amen that ought to make it so wonderful to come to church that we know if God speaks something to my heart it'll never be taken from me praise God hallelujah that's the it can't be hurt it can't be taken away nobody can take your joy away nobody can take your Victory away because it's god-given and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against the wine of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah Simon preached on this years ago right here at this Pulpit he called it the the healing prescription out of Luke chap 10: 33 but a certain Samaritan as he journeyed come from where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him and he went to him and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him and on the marrow when he departed he took out two pence and gave that to the host and said him take care of him and whatso thou spendest more when I come again I'll repay thee so the the the illustration is Jesus finds US half dead out in the world isn't that where he found us I've been listening to your testimony that's like a lot like mine Jesus found me at a low spot I was half dead and he pours in oil he pours in the Holy Spirit he pours in wine simulation he puts you on his own power he puts you on the Beast right he puts you on his power he carries you to an end and brother Ram says the end is your pastor and the home church so Jesus didn't just pour an oil wine and say okay now offend for yourself you don't have to go to church now just press play and Obey no he said he took him to an end and then Jesus gave the pastor two pence how many know what brother Braham said that was brother ra said that was spirit and truth of ma of John chapter 4:24 Hallelujah brother ramam said he says you Shepherds God give you the spirit and the word to take care of those wounded ones that's been brought in if you need if you need any more he'll take care of that when he comes so just feed those sheep church that's all I'm trying to do every time I come here just feed you the word of God I know the word has life I know if you worship you'll be blessed Hallelujah I know if you continually praise God God will anoint you Hallelujah this word is spirit and it's life hallelujah amen brother BR says again you that raise your hand and want to be further LED towards the Lord I ask you to go down he said to the Revival tonight and I'm sure the pastor there would take you from here to the end he has a six pence brother man says in that case this Good Samaritan was the pastor he said he has a six pence or whatever was given to take care oil and wine to pour in he can finish the job so in other words brother R had confidence in the five-fold ministry the five-fold ministry will give you the spirit and the word and that will finish the job Hallelujah God will provide God's going to water you day and night God's going to give you the sermons that you need God's going to strengthen you he's going to watch over you he's going to protect you God is faithful to his people hallelujah let's stand to our feet Hallelujah musicians can come thank you sir amen hallelujah let's bow our hearts here let's have a real sincere talk with the Lord here tonight by God's grace I would you play he's uh able more than able to accomplish what concerns me today Heavenly Father we thank you for these uh precious promises Lord God lord even in the Old Testament they would come to church and even on the way to church they'd be filled with joy and happiness God is that how we feel tonight I hope every person can feel that way tonight Lord if not Lord I pray someone will find an altar in their heart at their chair or the altar up here Lord you promise to water it day and night every single moment you gave us example after example of the oil and wine thank you Lord for the oil of the Holy Ghost thank you God for stimulation how brother cam can come in and be anointed to stir up our faith but I even heard last Wednesday's message was a great blessing to an individual just needed to hear that that they said that's exactly what I needed to hear here Lord because you want to water us day and night every moment you want to water your people keep us strong you want us to be healed you gave the inkeeper two pence the spirit and the word so we would receive the word and we' worship in the spirit hallelujah oh God you're more than able to accomplish what concerns us today and we know you'll give us every good thing that we need for this journey Lord we thank you for amazing Grace Lord God we thank you for your faithful promises Lord [Music] God Lord help us to remember if you take care of that little sparrow that little barn swallow surely you'll take care of us we're more valuable than [Music] that we thank you for these scriptures Lord God giving us the truth hallelujah [Music] Lord you make all things new Lord God we thank you for
