[22:33] just open up our Bibles here let's just
[22:34] do the Bible study here tonight by God's
[22:36] grace I didn't have enough time to
[22:39] finish part two of the revelation 4 so I
[22:42] do have a Bible study ready for tonight
[22:43] by God's grace I think that's a three
[22:48] hour sermon so I got most of it done but
[22:50] I didn't get the last half hour so so
[22:52] let's just open up to job 23 tonight I
[22:54] mentioned this morning how God will
[22:56] leave believers and test them so I think
[22:59] I'll just do that Bible study tonight by
[23:01] God's grace kind of centers around Jobe
[23:04] and Hezekiah so no doubt some familiar
[23:07] things but I'd like to go through the
[23:08] scriptures there and teach this here
[23:10] tonight by God's grace I mean a feeling
[23:13] a lot stronger here physically and with
[23:16] brother Simon helping me out and then
[23:17] get a little weekend away I feel a lot
[23:19] better I feel my voices back and feel
[23:22] stronger by the grace of Lord so thank
[23:24] God for that job 23 that's got to make
[23:30] sure my wife's like you know she gives
[23:32] me some
[23:32] wisdom she's like Jessie just don't sing
[23:34] so hard at the end but you know I get so
[23:35] happy with the word I just want to bail
[23:39] it out and be like you got to take it
[23:41] easy on your voice it's so hard didn't
[23:44] it brother it's so hard I just forget
[23:48] about taking care of myself
[23:50] job 23 8 and I know brother branham he
[23:55] was song leader pastor treasurer deacon
[23:58] for 17 years
[24:00] I've done it for I've done it part of
[24:02] the time for 12 years so I'm catching up
[24:04] but there's got to be faithful and I
[24:08] gotta use wisdom by the grace of the
[24:09] Lord laughing and Happiness because I
[24:13] know God takes care of his children just
[24:16] joyful joyful tonight job 23 so I like
[24:19] to just call this the test of life and
[24:21] we'll probably you know go a little
[24:23] deeper later on like I said I like to
[24:25] preach a series on God's purpose for our
[24:27] lives but this is kind of like leading
[24:30] into that I imagine cuz I just like I
[24:32] said didn't have time to finish
[24:33] revelation 4 part 2 so we look at this
[24:37] here cuz I did have I think I had I
[24:39] think I studied on this for four hours
[24:40] on the plane out there to California to
[24:42] studied on this thought and so we had a
[24:44] lot of good scriptures we'll go through
[24:45] tonight and I'll try to finish in about
[24:47] 40 minutes or so okay so job 23 just a
[24:52] real striking scripture here verse 8 how
[24:57] many no job was perfect god looked down
[25:00] you see a perfect man there and that he
[25:03] says these words because we know he's in
[25:05] the midst of the test of life so let's
[25:08] look at that and like I said I kind of
[25:09] feel like I can relate to Joe but that
[25:10] right now and I'll talk a little bit
[25:11] more about that but I kind of feel
[25:13] similar of course not to the extent I
[25:15] was thinking the Lord this morning thank
[25:16] you that don't have boils and you know
[25:18] thank you that my children I was just
[25:19] weeping and you know before the Lord
[25:21] this morning thank you for my wonderful
[25:22] children my family and the job and you
[25:25] know because God took everything away
[25:26] from job except his health and I was
[25:30] just thanking the Lord I know I'm in a
[25:31] test right now but I'm thanking God it
[25:33] wasn't as extremists job because we all
[25:35] go through tasks and trials you know
[25:37] drove 23:8 look at these inspired words
[25:41] behold I go forward but he's not there
[25:46] Joe was trying to go forward in the Lord
[25:48] but you don't feel that you don't feel
[25:50] God there and backward but I cannot
[25:55] perceive him yet he was perfect
[25:58] according to God on the left hand where
[26:03] he doth work but I cannot hold him so he
[26:06] just couldn't have that that fellowship
[26:08] that anointing like he wanted to there's
[26:11] that striking he hided himself on the
[26:14] right hand but I cannot see him let me
[26:18] know sometimes God hides himself verse
[26:21] 10 but I love this but he knoweth the
[26:26] way that I take a man I can't seem to
[26:29] get a hold of him but I know he's
[26:32] watching over me
[26:33] I know he's watching the steps that I
[26:35] take this is just this is such a
[26:37] beautiful portion of Scripture and when
[26:40] he hath tried me I shall come forth as
[26:43] gold job was mature enough to know this
[26:46] is just a test God has hidden himself
[26:48] from me for a little season but once
[26:51] this is all over I'll have more love for
[26:53] him our more confidence verse 11 my foot
[26:58] hath held his steps his way have I kept
[27:02] and not declined
[27:04] neither have I gone back from the
[27:07] commandment of his lips
[27:08] I have esteem the words of his mouth
[27:11] more than my necessary food hmm I just
[27:16] have one more word of Prayer futures
[27:18] haven't eaten your heart just maybe lift
[27:19] your hand make it unto God Heavenly
[27:21] Father these hands have defied gravity
[27:23] Lord we need you spiritually we're
[27:25] reaching up to heaven Lord God speak to
[27:27] us today Lord God we're grateful for
[27:30] your mercy we're grateful for your grace
[27:32] Lord just speak to us through your word
[27:33] today encourage us Lord we know you're
[27:36] with us Lord watching our every steps
[27:38] you'd said you never leave us or forsake
[27:39] us Lord we just look to you Lord tonight
[27:43] - Lord minister to our hearts and needs
[27:45] in Jesus Christ's name the church said
[27:47] Amen god bless yous bein seated there
[27:49] praise God
[27:55] so let's look at this I just like to
[27:57] call it tests of life tonight
[27:59] and my actual inspiration I was so
[28:03] shocked to read this scripture but let's
[28:05] go to second chronicles 32 I don't have
[28:07] any slides sorry I just haven't had
[28:09] enough time and get slides with a real
[28:10] busy week at school and I just didn't
[28:13] have much time to get to the slides and
[28:15] yesterday we went to brother John's
[28:17] house to celebrate his graduate
[28:20] graduation with his master's degree so
[28:22] that kind of took a little more of my
[28:23] time but I knew I had the scripture I
[28:26] knew I studied real hard on this this
[28:27] lesson for hours so uh yeah
[28:32] second chronicles 32 31 and so this was
[28:40] one of those moments you know God knows
[28:42] my heart I read this scripture and it
[28:44] felt like the Holy Spirit just gave me
[28:46] such a fresh unction such a fresh
[28:48] anointing on my heart 32 31 this is
[28:53] speaking of Hezekiah how many know he
[28:55] was a godly King one of the few godly
[28:57] kings of Judah member there was no godly
[29:00] Kings in northern Israel not a one of
[29:02] them but there was a few in Judah
[29:05] because the kingdom divided after
[29:07] Solomon Judah
[29:08] of course means praise so the the part
[29:11] of the country that had praise had a few
[29:13] good Kings Amen so verse 31 howbeit in
[29:17] the business of the ambassadors of the
[29:19] princes of Babylon who sent unto him to
[29:23] inquire of the Wonder that was done in
[29:24] that land God left him to try him that
[29:31] he might know all that was in his heart
[29:34] and that something that just about made
[29:37] me cry when I read that I'm like is that
[29:38] in the Bible and look church I've had to
[29:40] underline and highlight it for like
[29:41] years I probably had this highlighted
[29:42] for like seven years and it's like it's
[29:45] like I never had read it before that God
[29:48] and no doubt he was a godly King he was
[29:50] one of the Kings that said Hezekiah was
[29:53] one like David and did all that God
[29:55] desired has a Kai's life he was the
[29:56] highest quality of believer for his day
[29:59] he was a man just like David the Bible
[30:01] said and yet towards the end of his life
[30:05] God left him in for it to try him to see
[30:09] what was in a
[30:09] heart and you probably member the story
[30:13] you know he opened up his storehouses in
[30:16] the treasure house of the Lord and he
[30:18] let these Babylonian UNIX or princes or
[30:21] forget whatever they're called come
[30:23] through and look and it was a moment of
[30:24] pride he got lifted up in Pride and and
[30:29] then God of course you know told him you
[30:31] know you're gonna pay for this not in
[30:32] your lifetime but the next generation
[30:34] will pay for that because we know we
[30:38] don't cast our pearls before the swine
[30:39] how many know that we don't let you know
[30:42] in this case in our case you know we
[30:44] wouldn't share our wonderful treasures
[30:46] of God with people that are just gonna
[30:47] trample upon it you know God knew those
[30:49] Babylonian princes would just go back
[30:51] and they would trample on it they
[30:53] weren't interested in serving God so
[30:55] seeing you know seeing all the furniture
[30:57] pieces the Ark of the Covenant whatever
[30:59] they had in those day the candles it
[31:00] wasn't gonna mean nothing to them and so
[31:02] has a kind his pride just let him see it
[31:04] and they were gonna stamp or stamp upon
[31:07] it and this that don't mean nothing to
[31:08] us and and the Bible said that Hezekiah
[31:11] was gonna pay for this and he did now
[31:14] remember he had made a false step a
[31:16] little earlier as well so if you go back
[31:18] up to verse 24 you'll see his this is
[31:21] really his first ball he had two false
[31:23] steps we'd say two times he missed the
[31:25] will of God a church of we can go
[31:27] through our lives and say we just missed
[31:28] the will of God twice in our lives we'd
[31:30] be pretty pretty pretty happy right did
[31:33] we know brother Branham missed it in
[31:34] South Africa you know the whole country
[31:35] would have been given to him and he lied
[31:37] to the IRS you know we all make mistakes
[31:39] but if they're going to be two times I
[31:41] missed God's will I'd say hallelujah but
[31:45] that's all the repr Bible records about
[31:46] Hezekiah but look up in verse 24 in
[31:48] those days Hezekiah was sick to the
[31:50] death and prayed unto the Lord and he
[31:52] spake unto him and he gave him a sign
[31:54] remember the Bible says here it was
[31:57] better got it was God's perfect will to
[32:01] take Hezekiah but he asked for more time
[32:03] and look what look what it says verse 25
[32:07] but Hezekiah rendered not again
[32:08] according to the benefit done unto him
[32:10] so God gave him a benefit of extra time
[32:12] but he didn't do wisely with that
[32:15] benefit in other words God answered his
[32:17] prayer but Hezekiah really didn't keep
[32:19] his part of his promise to God he
[32:23] see and then therefore there was wrath
[32:25] upon him upon Judah and Jerusalem look
[32:27] at that
[32:27] he said God remember he has such a
[32:29] sincere prayer God give me 15 more years
[32:32] you know I've walked in the integrity of
[32:34] my heart but it was God's will to take
[32:38] him at that time
[32:39] but God looked down and isn't God so
[32:41] merciful church even we asked for the
[32:43] wrong thing sometimes right he'll even
[32:46] give it to us if we just ask sincerely
[32:48] if we're just sincere and so God gave
[32:52] him this extra time he told Isaiah go
[32:54] back and tell him thus saith the Lord
[32:55] you got 15 more years to set your house
[32:57] in order but he should have went at the
[33:00] time God called him huh me know God's
[33:02] first word is the right word to see look
[33:05] at verse 26 it goes on to tell us more
[33:09] about this notwithstanding Hezekiah
[33:11] humbled himself for the pride of his
[33:13] heart both he and the habitants of it
[33:15] Jerusalem so that the wrath of God came
[33:17] out up upon them in the days of Hezekiah
[33:19] so see he kind of chose this is a
[33:21] interesting case here where God prolongs
[33:24] somebody's life for the in the
[33:26] permissive will of God because it was
[33:28] God's perfect will to take him at that
[33:30] time and so he made a false step there
[33:33] he didn't give God the glory should have
[33:35] and he kind of wasted that extra time
[33:38] that he asked for oh god help us to
[33:40] redeem the time God help us to do what
[33:43] we promised God were gonna do as the Chi
[33:46] mihn stit the Bible said pride and then
[33:48] during that 15 years as we said he cast
[33:51] his pearl before the swine and these you
[33:55] know Babylonians come in and they walk
[33:57] out and and they had no business being
[33:59] around those holy things how many know
[34:00] that they weren't holy right they
[34:03] they're not supposed to touch those
[34:05] things those were all for the sons of
[34:06] Levi right the kohathites were to pack
[34:09] those things but here he does something
[34:11] he should not have done but I just you
[34:14] know that's that's a lot to say this but
[34:16] in verse 31 God left him to try him
[34:21] so God knew he asked for the wrong thing
[34:24] but God in His mercy gave it to him
[34:25] anyway because the Bible said he'll give
[34:27] us a desire of our heart we must make
[34:29] sure our heart though is lined up with
[34:31] God's desire and not just well I've
[34:33] always one of this you know brother
[34:35] so-and-so our sister so and so I've
[34:36] always wanted
[34:37] I trust God will give it to me well
[34:38] let's make sure that's what God wants
[34:40] you to have first because the heart is
[34:42] deceitful above all things who can know
[34:44] it we got to make sure we love God with
[34:47] all of our heart soul mind and strength
[34:49] amen
[34:51] so I thought that you know what would
[34:53] bless you I hope that's a blessing to
[34:55] you and it really blessed my heart God
[34:57] left him a godly man a faithful man God
[35:01] left this godly man to try him and that
[35:05] sound familiar like job that sounds just
[35:07] like job's let's go to job chapter one
[35:09] again we'll just go over that again real
[35:11] briefly job chapter one
[35:37] look at verse eight all these are
[35:40] beautiful words here my if only God
[35:44] could all could call all of us perfect
[35:45] how many would like that God calls Joe
[35:48] perfect it wasn't Jobe saying I'm
[35:50] perfect
[35:51] it's God saying he's perfect Oh that's
[35:53] the kind of company that's the kind of
[35:55] words I once said about me if it means
[35:56] but be God's will Oh hallelujah verse
[35:59] eight and the Lord said unto Satan hast
[36:01] thou considered my servant job that
[36:04] there is none like him in the earth a
[36:07] perfect and upright man one that is fear
[36:10] the Lord fears God and ask you is evil
[36:13] amen
[36:15] what a great testimony Jobe had praise
[36:18] the Lord now I just had a thought that
[36:20] came to me hope maybe hold your spot
[36:22] there and let's go to a Zechariah
[36:23] chapter three I believe it is Zechariah
[36:25] right before Malachi throughout the end
[36:27] of the Old Testament not sure the last
[36:31] time I preached this maybe it was
[36:33] recently but I hope it's a blessing to
[36:35] you I just
[36:43] yeah Joe I'm sorry Zechariah chapter 3
[36:45] verse 1 now this is speaking of Joshua
[36:49] the high priest in the days of Hezekiah
[36:50] a Haggai and Zechariah so in the days
[36:54] when the days when they were zoomable
[36:57] had come back you know from Babylon and
[36:59] they're real rebuilding the the house of
[37:01] God and all these things look at verse 1
[37:05] he showed me josh with a high priest
[37:07] standing before the angel of the Lord
[37:08] and Satan standing at his right hand to
[37:12] resist him and the Lord said unto Satan
[37:14] the Lord rebuke thee O Satan
[37:17] so obviously Satan was blabbering off
[37:20] something you know trying to trying to
[37:22] accuse Joshua the high priest in the
[37:24] presence of the Lord then that striking
[37:28] I wonder if that was Joshua's theophany
[37:30] and I just never thought about that
[37:34] it's Satan the angel Lord and God and
[37:37] Joshua I wonder if that says theophany
[37:41] because the Bible said don't do anything
[37:43] wrong to those children because they
[37:45] always have an angel that be always be
[37:47] holds the face in heaven in that
[37:50] thing and the bottom Paul says if we
[37:52] leave this body he said we've got an
[37:54] eternal body made in the heavens amen
[37:56] that's your theophany hallelujah wow
[37:58] that's striking I never thought about
[38:00] that that must be that the Alpha T my
[38:02] verse to thank the Lord and the Lord
[38:04] said unto Satan the Lord rebuke thee O
[38:06] Satan even the Lord that have chosen
[38:10] Jerusalem rebuke thee is not this a
[38:13] brand plucked out of the fire so we see
[38:15] the same thing Satan must be accusing
[38:18] Joshua the high priest and huh me know
[38:21] if Israel's going to succeed in the days
[38:23] of Haggai and Zechariah huh me know they
[38:25] need a high priest because the high
[38:28] priest will go into the holiest of
[38:29] Holies and make atonement for all Israel
[38:32] hallelujah praise God amen so here Satan
[38:36] is trying to accuse the leader of the
[38:38] church and somehow he's got a body up in
[38:41] heaven must be half anybody
[38:43] Satan's round off all these offenses and
[38:45] the Lord says the Lord rebuke thee in
[38:48] other words stop talking I'm gonna make
[38:50] a declaration here amen and how many
[38:53] know the Bible says that Satan accuses
[38:54] us day and night before the the heaven
[38:57] in the heavenly places and the angels
[38:59] that's Revelation chapter 12 he accuses
[39:02] the brother in day and night oh I just
[39:05] want the Lord to rebuke Satan for me as
[39:08] well and say that he's a perfect man
[39:11] he's a forgiving man he's under the
[39:13] blood of my son amen look at verse oh
[39:16] look at that also he's a brand plucked
[39:18] out of the fire see he's he's been in
[39:20] the fires of God
[39:21] maybe that coal that was off the fire
[39:23] you know of the altar and that's what
[39:26] he's like he's a brand plucked out of
[39:28] the fire in other words he's hot he's
[39:30] ready to do something for the kingdom of
[39:31] God he's ready to set Satan's Kingdom
[39:33] afoot and make it move amen he's on fire
[39:36] and so God even recognized Joshua is a
[39:39] brand plucked out of the fire hallelujah
[39:42] oh my now look at verse 3 now Joshua's
[39:47] clothed with filthy garments and stood
[39:48] before the angel this is striking and he
[39:51] answered and spake unto those that stood
[39:53] before him saying take away the filthy
[39:54] garments from him and unto him he said
[39:56] behold I have caused on iniquity to pass
[39:58] from thee and I will clothe thee with
[40:01] change of raiment
[40:02] oh my see
[40:04] Jesus does he causes all your dirty
[40:06] parts to leave amen
[40:07] he causes all your sins all your
[40:10] iniquities he throws him in the sea of
[40:12] forgetfulness oh that's beautiful look
[40:15] at this verse five and I and I said let
[40:20] them set a fair mitre upon his head
[40:22] so they set a fair mitre upon his head
[40:24] and clothed him with garments and the
[40:27] angel of the Lord stood by now look and
[40:30] the next event verses now they interpret
[40:32] this for us so God is showing us what's
[40:35] happening in the heavenlies as Joshua
[40:38] the high priest is trying to get Israel
[40:40] back into fellowship with God amen look
[40:44] at verse 6 and the angel of the Lord
[40:47] protested unto Joshua saying thus saith
[40:50] the Lord of Hosts if thou will walk in
[40:53] my ways and if that will keep my charge
[40:56] then thou shalt also judge my house and
[40:58] shall also keep my courts and I will
[41:01] give thee places to walk among these
[41:04] that stand by Amen my glory so God is
[41:08] giving Joshua a vision and encouragement
[41:12] through zechariah zechariah saying
[41:14] Joshua I saw this vision of you in
[41:17] heaven it must have been your theophany
[41:19] it must have been years representation
[41:21] you were filthy
[41:22] Satan was accusing you but God called
[41:25] you a non-fire Holy Ghost field st. amen
[41:28] and God took away all your all your
[41:31] iniquities all your sins and he put a
[41:33] miter on your head
[41:34] you're gonna rule over Satan in your
[41:36] ministry amen oh that's what we need
[41:39] today hallelujah and he can share this
[41:42] with Joshua can you imagine the
[41:43] encouragement Joshua must have felt God
[41:46] thinks I'm a brand plucked out of the
[41:48] fire all's I got to do I just got to
[41:51] keep the word of the Lord a man just
[41:54] like Joshua the original Joshua I just
[41:56] got to meditate be strong be of good
[41:59] courage write do those things and you'll
[42:01] be a success and no man will stand you
[42:04] before you all the days of your life oh
[42:06] my oh this is beautiful
[42:08] and then the next verse verse 8 he
[42:11] prophesies of Jesus Christ because
[42:13] remember this is just 500 years before
[42:15] Christ he talks about a branch
[42:17] is going to come out of Israel mercy
[42:19] here now Joshua the high priest thou and
[42:21] thy fellows that sit before thee for
[42:23] their men wonder that for behold I will
[42:25] bring forth my servant the branch a man
[42:28] he's encouraging him the Messiah is
[42:31] coming this branch is going to come out
[42:34] of out of David's house in other words
[42:36] stay true to God's Word God is gonna
[42:39] bring forth this Redeemer amen and
[42:41] you're a part of that church oh thank
[42:45] you Lord Jesus amen so see how see if we
[42:49] take if we take this scripture and put
[42:52] it together with Jobe we can see how God
[42:54] can call us perfect how can God cause
[42:57] perfect because he can silence Satan he
[43:00] can forgive our sins amen
[43:03] and then now let if we go back to Jobe
[43:07] then we know God still sees job as a
[43:09] perfect man but he lets him go through
[43:12] trials that's right and so we'd say like
[43:16] this it's like God left Joe because Joe
[43:19] kept crying out for answers crying out
[43:21] for answers crying out for answers
[43:24] he's got boils you know he's he's
[43:26] suffering he's going through hard times
[43:28] and then his three friends come and
[43:31] tried to try to correct him but God
[43:34] actually said that these three he he
[43:36] said you did not speak the right thing
[43:38] so they were lying
[43:39] so these friends were liars because Joe
[43:43] was saying the right thing and the three
[43:44] friends were lying to him so they were
[43:47] making up lies because they were trying
[43:49] to figure out his life and why you
[43:50] getting tested if he's getting tested
[43:52] you know they must had something against
[43:54] Jobe but then God says Jobe was right
[43:58] you three were liars he's gonna pray for
[44:00] you and then you'll be healed as well
[44:02] you'll be forgiven because God saw job
[44:04] as being perfect because he has a blood
[44:07] sacrifice and he was keeping all the
[44:09] Word of God amen now now I preached this
[44:13] in the wisdom series but let's go back
[44:14] to job 3:25 I just want to remind you of
[44:16] this because this is how it works in our
[44:22] lives - like I said you know I feel like
[44:23] I'm going through trials I know many
[44:25] times you do - drove 325 for the thing
[44:30] which I greatly fear
[44:31] come upon me and that which I was afraid
[44:33] of is come unto me and brother Brandon
[44:36] tells us you know plainly and that
[44:37] message perfect faith that if job would
[44:40] not have feared this would not have
[44:42] happened to him brother man tells that
[44:45] in perfect faith paragraph 102 he says
[44:48] what brought it his fear that's what
[44:51] made it happen his faith would have kept
[44:53] him from it but his fear brought it to
[44:56] him so this is striking so in heaven you
[45:00] can be perfect because you have a
[45:02] sacrifice but on earth God still lets
[45:05] you go through these trials you're
[45:06] wondering what's wrong boy I'm really
[45:08] scared or you know he'll let you go
[45:10] through trials and he'll let all things
[45:12] work together but yeah up here he still
[45:14] sees you as his true servant Oh
[45:17] God is rich in mercy to hurt amen so see
[45:20] he was perfect in the sight of God
[45:22] because of the blood and that's how
[45:24] we're perfect because the blood of Jesus
[45:25] Christ
[45:26] yet if we have fear it'll bring things
[45:29] upon us if we have pride it'll bring
[45:32] chastisement upon us if we have lusts
[45:34] whatever trouble we're fighting down
[45:35] here but yet we're still brands plucked
[45:38] out of the fire amen
[45:39] and we just must repent move on and ask
[45:41] God to guide us amen the test of life
[45:44] how many thankful for the test of life
[45:46] oh I'm so thankful for God's mercy now
[45:49] let's go through a few more scriptures
[45:51] and I said so Joe was perfect and our
[45:54] text was Joe 23 and he said I cannot if
[45:58] I go forward I don't feel him there if I
[46:01] go backward I cannot perceive him if
[46:03] he's on the left hand he's working but I
[46:05] can't behold him he on the right hand
[46:07] he's hiding from me so no matter if I
[46:10] try praying no matter if I try fasting
[46:12] no matter if I pray reading my Bible I
[46:14] just don't seem like I can get ahold of
[46:15] him see that but yet he was a perfect
[46:18] man
[46:19] now remember God promised he never what
[46:20] leave us or forsake us but we're talking
[46:23] about feeling the anointing right or
[46:26] feeling the blessings of God or hearing
[46:29] the voice of God like we said this
[46:31] morning now I want to ask you if you
[46:34] remember this you remember this in 1960
[46:37] and 61 brother brother Ram starting off
[46:39] the new year and it's in these sermons
[46:41] I'm listening to right now chapter
[46:42] revelation chapter 4 chapter 5 if you
[46:44] hear
[46:45] talk brother Bram says I do not have a
[46:47] leading of the Lord for 1961 he said I
[46:50] have all these invitations and if you
[46:52] listen to it
[46:53] he said we have all these invitations
[46:54] all the brothers just gonna lay hands on
[46:56] these invitations and he says I do not
[46:58] have a word from the Lord on this I am
[47:01] just going to go with the best of our
[47:02] leading of the Lord to see there's times
[47:06] where it seems like we don't actually
[47:08] have like a full leading of the Lord or
[47:10] it's not like we have at us at the Lord
[47:12] and it's in this time where God allows
[47:14] us to be tested Oh even brother Branham
[47:18] admits that now remember he got a word
[47:20] two years later he said stay here and
[47:23] storm tapes amen
[47:25] hallelujah and it was a dream it was
[47:27] vision numerous dreams all said store up
[47:30] these tapes don't go overseas how many
[47:32] know that so see God let him wander
[47:34] there can I say like that wandering a
[47:36] wilderness can I say like that he let
[47:39] him wander for two years I'm sorry about
[47:42] 1 or 2 I'm sorry one or two years all 61
[47:44] and maybe I think it was the spring of
[47:46] 62 okay so let me say about a year and a
[47:48] quarter okay God let him wonder for a
[47:51] year and a quarter what should I do
[47:53] where do I go we're just doing the best
[47:55] we can and that one sermon he says well
[47:57] just think I'll go to Beaumont and the
[47:59] reason he went to Beaumont Texas in 1961
[48:01] because he said all the churches could
[48:04] gather he said 25 churches could gather
[48:06] in one convention meeting and he said
[48:08] it'd be better for all the churches he
[48:10] didn't have thus saith the Lord it's
[48:12] just what he felt would be best he said
[48:14] he learned it's better to do that to
[48:16] have combined meetings while everybody's
[48:18] working together so see we know a member
[48:22] when brother remember when brother
[48:25] branham's uh first wife died during the
[48:27] flood remember that he said he prayed
[48:29] and it felt like a black sheet had come
[48:31] down was he filled with the Holy Ghost
[48:33] or not yes he was but see there's times
[48:37] like Hezekiah it seems like God it seems
[48:41] like God's left us but did God ever
[48:43] leave brother Branham he never leaves us
[48:46] or forsakes us but he hides himself from
[48:49] us
[48:50] amen and now the reason not this it
[48:55] means so much to me is because I feel
[48:56] like you know in 2015 I felt like our
[48:58] church real
[48:59] a revival because we had numerous
[49:01] families move in this was mentioned
[49:03] earlier so brother William wasn't here
[49:05] but but our church brother was really
[49:06] small before that everything I mean if
[49:09] you think is small now is even smaller
[49:10] and you know we're just trying to preach
[49:12] the Word of God and and you know stay
[49:14] true the Word of God will seem like in
[49:15] 2015
[49:16] God started sending a lot of families
[49:18] and it was really encouraging and but
[49:21] then in 2016 you know we had families
[49:23] start leaving for different and some of
[49:24] them were fine reasons you know most of
[49:26] them were really good reasons really
[49:27] really sweet people really wonderful
[49:29] people and but you know once they
[49:32] started leaving I just kind of felt like
[49:33] the zeal started going down a little bit
[49:36] and then I feel like that you know I
[49:40] don't know about you but how many want
[49:41] to see more of God in our myths like how
[49:43] many want to see miracles in our church
[49:44] how many want to see gifts operate I do
[49:47] I pray for that I live for that not not
[49:50] that I'm exalting gifts above but I just
[49:51] want to see more supernatural you know
[49:54] and so I feel like you know this last
[49:57] few months here and even now you know
[49:59] now in the last few months here too I
[50:01] just feel like going through like a
[50:04] battle where I felt like gods with me
[50:07] but I feel like the revivals kind of
[50:09] left and it's collect this like with a
[50:12] job I feel like if we're under the blood
[50:14] of Jesus Christ we're perfect but yet
[50:16] God is gonna sometimes hide himself that
[50:18] he might test us amen and help me know
[50:22] you know how many know the Bible says
[50:24] this the Lord gives and the Lord takes
[50:26] away blessed be the name of the Lord and
[50:28] so my children and my family and I were
[50:31] talking at home you know and I was
[50:32] telling them how I was a little bit
[50:33] discouraged and feel like this is a test
[50:36] the Lord and that's exactly the
[50:37] scripture that came to me I wasn't even
[50:38] planning it but the Holy Spirit just
[50:40] gotta inspire me and that's what I said
[50:42] I said the Lord gives the Lord gives
[50:45] families here the Lord gives people to
[50:47] come the Lord gives people to be a
[50:48] blessing but then the Lord can also take
[50:51] away but either way we should bless the
[50:54] name of the Lord and that's what I feel
[50:56] like you know for that's the part I want
[50:58] to share just about my life I feel like
[51:00] I'm really being tested in that way
[51:02] where you know I pray and I fast and I
[51:04] seek God and I give everything I can to
[51:06] preach and be a faithful pastor I try to
[51:08] help every single person I possibly can
[51:10] and in my own human thinking I would
[51:12] think God would
[51:13] keep blessing us with more and more I'd
[51:14] have a bigger Church and some of the
[51:16] brother and want to build a church you
[51:17] know but then when people leave it seems
[51:19] like how is that gonna happen and not
[51:22] that we really care about a building but
[51:24] just I'm talking about our natural human
[51:26] mind battles if I'm being true to God
[51:29] shouldn't we just keep growing greater
[51:30] and greater right naturally we think
[51:33] that but I have to remember that my
[51:36] thoughts are not always his thoughts and
[51:38] we have to remember that even when we go
[51:41] through a trial he's still with us right
[51:44] he never leaves us or forsake us but
[51:46] what is he doing he's testing us and so
[51:50] that's what the scripture says job 23
[51:53] read that for our text but he knoweth
[51:56] the way that I take I'm so glad God
[51:58] knows the way I'm taking I'm not taking
[52:00] the way of anger bitterness fear regret
[52:03] I'm not taking that way I'm taking the
[52:06] way of love God knows the way we're
[52:10] taking and when he has tried me I shall
[52:12] come forth as gold aren't you glad for
[52:16] that oh thank you Jesus now remember I'm
[52:20] gonna read that again with Hezekiah God
[52:23] left him to try him that he might know
[52:27] all that was in his heart amen
[52:32] so church I know and I hope you know too
[52:35] God will let us be tested and tried to
[52:39] show us what's in our heart we might
[52:41] have a financial trial to see if are we
[52:44] gonna trust God and keep paying tithes
[52:45] and offerings or we gonna rob the robbed
[52:47] the Lord a little bit right are you at
[52:50] the understand I got up just kind of a
[52:52] funny example you know God might give us
[52:55] a family trial well someone will get
[52:56] really sick and are we gonna keep
[52:59] trusting God and keep praying the prayer
[53:01] of faith for healing or we just gonna
[53:03] get mad at God or might lose a loved one
[53:06] a grandparent a husband wife or a child
[53:08] we might lose someone really close and
[53:10] it might be a test of God's love he
[53:13] wants to see how we gonna react when
[53:15] tragedy strikes our home do we really
[53:18] believe God's Word
[53:19] do we really feel like job though he
[53:21] gives and takes away will still bless
[53:23] his name that's what he wants to see
[53:25] because he
[53:26] needs a testimony on the day of judgment
[53:28] and we need to have the gold testimony
[53:31] and we've got to come forth as gold
[53:35] hallelujah
[53:37] now remember God did God with job didn't
[53:41] tell Satan once but he told him twice
[53:43] have you considered my servant job he
[53:46] can't he keeps recommending Satan to try
[53:49] this man because he knows what's inside
[53:51] of job all right now let's go to job 42
[53:54] here I just want to remind us of this
[53:56] because just kind of tells the whole
[53:59] story we know because he feared his
[54:01] trials came upon him and God let that
[54:04] work out into the the perfect will of
[54:07] God now you know in chapter 40 and 41
[54:12] God answers Joe but he never really
[54:15] asked us answers this question job said
[54:18] let God come and tell me why I'm going
[54:21] through this god never really answered
[54:22] that question God just told him I do
[54:24] this I control animals I control this
[54:26] have you considered the Leviathan look
[54:28] at all that I do you know when the goats
[54:31] bring forth children you know do you
[54:33] know what you can you capture the snow
[54:34] and bring it can you make snow and bring
[54:36] it here god never answered this question
[54:38] god just humbled him and told him how
[54:40] great he was
[54:41] praise the Lord and yet God the whole
[54:44] time instead I'm saying job's perfect
[54:46] job's perfect jobs perfect Joe's perfect
[54:48] and then job's like I want to know why
[54:50] God said just trust me I'm God does God
[54:56] Oh us anything no God doesn't owe us
[54:59] nothing brother Branham says he's he
[55:02] don't always nothing he already did
[55:03] everything for us he died for us praise
[55:06] God is that striking God would be
[55:09] bragging on job in heaven but then not
[55:10] give job the actual answer oh but can we
[55:14] trust him we can trust him with our
[55:15] lives
[55:16] absolutely look at Joel 42 verse 1 then
[55:20] job answered the Lord and said I know
[55:21] that thou canst do everything see so he
[55:23] learned a lesson from God God taught him
[55:25] look at all that I do what do you do
[55:26] joke what problems do you really have
[55:30] look at all I have to control and that
[55:33] no thought can be withholding from thee
[55:34] who is he the height of counsel without
[55:36] knowledge therefore have I uttered that
[55:38] I understood not
[55:40] yeah I did say some things I just didn't
[55:42] understand things too wonderful for me
[55:46] which I knew not here I beseech thee and
[55:50] I will speak I would demand of the ins
[55:51] speak down to me I have heard of thee by
[55:54] the hearing of the year but now mine I
[55:57] see if thee amen
[55:59] because remember God met him in a
[56:00] whirlwind right after all this trial
[56:03] where it felt like where's God I can't
[56:05] see God here I can't see God there I
[56:07] can't see God everywhere but then
[56:08] finally he sees God he sees him in a
[56:11] whirlwind just like the prophet of God
[56:13] did amen and look at verse 6 now see
[56:16] this is why trials happened to us
[56:18] wherefore I have myself and repent
[56:21] in dust and ashes if we have no other
[56:23] reason to understand trials they are to
[56:25] Humble us and make us respect God more
[56:28] and fear the Lord more remember Jesus
[56:31] learned obedience through the things he
[56:32] suffered will hear job he suffers and he
[56:35] learns to respect God more he said
[56:38] sometimes remember he was the wisest man
[56:40] number job he stood in the gates and he
[56:42] gave everybody counsel all the young men
[56:44] came to him but after the boils came
[56:45] nobody wanted here is what wisdom
[56:47] anymore he was so wise right but even
[56:50] now after these trials he steps back and
[56:52] said well I was saying some things I
[56:54] should not have said I'm humbled and
[56:56] Archie was grateful when God humbles you
[56:58] Church I want to be I want to be
[57:00] grateful when God humbles me then I can
[57:02] grow to love him more and I can trust
[57:04] him more in my life amen
[57:06] now let's go through some more examples
[57:08] of how God left individuals because it's
[57:11] all through it's all through the
[57:12] scripture I probably got twenty
[57:13] scriptures here I don't think I'll get
[57:15] through all of them tonight but I just
[57:18] want to do this Bible say like I said
[57:20] Adam time to finish the Revelation
[57:21] chapter 4 part 2 so let's go to 1st
[57:24] chronicles 10:13 this is about Saul
[57:31] 1st chronicles 10:13 let's remember
[57:38] these here by the grace of the Lord
[57:41] remember God has a purpose for
[57:43] everything many times we look at
[57:44] situations say I don't understand what
[57:45] God is doing here I don't understand
[57:47] what is God is doing but in everything
[57:49] God understands what he's doing and we
[57:52] need to wait and then we'll know
[57:54] understand it better by and by as the
[57:55] song says look at first chronicles 10:13
[58:00] so saw died for what his transgression
[58:04] which he committed against the Lord God
[58:07] killed him allowed him to be killed even
[58:10] against the world Lord which he kept not
[58:12] and also for asking counsel one that had
[58:13] a familiar spirit to inquire of it and
[58:15] inquired not of the Lord therefore he
[58:18] slew him
[58:19] God had saw slain and turned the kingdom
[58:23] unto David the son of Jesse isn't that
[58:28] striking so saw God left saw because of
[58:31] his sin now that's not what it was for
[58:33] jobs I I hope we don't want to be saw
[58:36] but we want to be Joe we want to be
[58:38] perfect if we got to be tested we want
[58:40] to be perfect like Jobe
[58:42] I'm just showing saw because Saul was
[58:44] saved but here's another reason God will
[58:47] leave people because they won't repent
[58:48] of their sin memory had a hard heart he
[58:51] kept attacking David he kept attacking
[58:52] David he wasn't kind of David he tried
[58:54] to kill David he tried to say everything
[58:56] wrong against David he tried to do
[58:58] everything he could to ruin David's
[58:59] ministry right and God didn't like that
[59:03] he never really really repented so God
[59:04] slew him
[59:06] remember that's New Testament to
[59:08] remember 1st Corinthians 5 where Paul
[59:11] said take that fornicator who's sleeping
[59:13] with his stepmother
[59:14] he said kick him out of the church and
[59:16] give him up to the devil remember that
[59:18] that's New Testament - God does that
[59:22] absolutely
[59:24] now we'll try to go maybe we'll try to
[59:26] go an order here okay let's then I'm
[59:32] looking at the order scripts go to
[59:33] Deuteronomy 8 let's just go there by
[59:35] God's grace I'm gonna try to keep the
[59:37] order maybe we just go right through the
[59:38] scripture dude around me 8 verse 2
[59:44] actually we'll just read one in two
[59:46] maybe I can have my children help me
[59:47] read would that be okay I got some
[59:49] Bibles ready Deuteronomy 8 okay Lydia
[59:58] can you read verses 1 & 2 please
[1:00:14] [Music]
[1:00:22] okay men look at that and that's
[1:00:42] striking two million people come out of
[1:00:45] Egypt they all got baptized unto Moses
[1:00:47] now you type that today how many got
[1:00:49] baptized through brother branham's
[1:00:50] baptism right brought out of the world
[1:00:52] and then God allows the church to go
[1:00:55] through a test and this test is gonna
[1:00:57] prove who really believes Moses who
[1:01:00] really believes brother Branham today
[1:01:02] right so these things these trials these
[1:01:05] dark deserts and trials were to humble
[1:01:07] the people and prove if they really
[1:01:10] believe it or not and you know Joshua
[1:01:13] and Caleb were only two that made it
[1:01:14] over right we know that so they must
[1:01:17] have not been grumbling when they didn't
[1:01:18] have water they must have not could be
[1:01:20] in complaining when they had all these
[1:01:21] things oh god help us like like I think
[1:01:24] the psalm writer said Lord set a guard
[1:01:26] in front of my lips that don't utter
[1:01:28] perverse things amen help me not to
[1:01:31] complain help me not to get bitter help
[1:01:33] me not to say anything evil guard said a
[1:01:37] guard about my lips so I don't say
[1:01:38] anything against the Lord or any of his
[1:01:40] people amen
[1:01:41] and so the trials were gonna show are we
[1:01:45] gonna live by every word or just some
[1:01:47] words of God and we've got to live by
[1:01:50] every word that proceeds out of the
[1:01:51] mouth of God look at verse 16
[1:01:53] liddie can you read 16 as well amen see
[1:02:05] the latter end this was going to work
[1:02:07] together now most of them died right but
[1:02:09] the next generation they were gonna see
[1:02:11] the blessings of God on the latter end
[1:02:14] because they would believe the word
[1:02:15] they'd be circumcised and they'd follow
[1:02:18] Joshua according to all the
[1:02:20] word of god and we've got to know that -
[1:02:22] we've got to obey all the Word of God
[1:02:23] so our ladder and we come forth as gold
[1:02:26] amen
[1:02:27] just like jokes and I know if he tries
[1:02:28] me I'll come forth my ladder and will be
[1:02:31] greater amen
[1:02:32] hallelujah and I know you've heard you
[1:02:34] know brother Brooks and different other
[1:02:36] brothers that her older come through
[1:02:37] here brother Brooks said the last time
[1:02:38] about all the trials that he's gone
[1:02:40] through and it's all kind of molded him
[1:02:42] to help him to have the faith that he
[1:02:44] has right now and he knows that God has
[1:02:47] taken things out of his life and giving
[1:02:49] testimonies healed him of cancer all
[1:02:50] those different things God has done to
[1:02:52] bring him to the spot where is now so
[1:02:54] he's shining forth as gold the light of
[1:02:57] God is shining and reflecting off his
[1:02:58] life and so we've got he's what 60 60 -
[1:03:02] I think now so we've got a I've got a
[1:03:04] ways to go you know if God Terry's we've
[1:03:06] got to go through trials we got to go
[1:03:08] through these battles and but if God is
[1:03:10] gracious and if we keep God's word our
[1:03:12] latter end will be greater than the
[1:03:14] beginning amen and we're talking about
[1:03:17] Christian character not even a bigger
[1:03:19] Church or bigger people like I said we
[1:03:20] don't care about that we care about
[1:03:22] being more like Christ that's the real
[1:03:24] important thing
[1:03:25] okay now let's uh I'm sure like I said
[1:03:31] I'm trying to get these in order here so
[1:03:32] we preserve our time yeah 13 3 so
[1:03:36] Deuteronomy 13 3 that's the next one so
[1:03:39] again he's basically repeating the same
[1:03:40] thing aren't you glad God gives
[1:03:42] reminders has ever been something where
[1:03:44] you haven't got it right away but
[1:03:46] eventually you got it I didn't I didn't
[1:03:48] understand God's Word maybe at the
[1:03:50] beginning I shouldn't do this or
[1:03:51] shouldn't do that and then pretty soon
[1:03:52] you get it but it took another time to
[1:03:55] preach it or another time to read it or
[1:03:57] it took somebody else to bring it up to
[1:03:59] you and then you finally get it - amen
[1:04:01] oh that's God's grace right there
[1:04:04] now kaikki read 13-3 yes sir yeah thank
[1:04:10] you okay so if you know the context
[1:04:26] verses 1 & 2 it says if a prophet rises
[1:04:28] up and it actually comes to pass what he
[1:04:30] prophesized but yet he tells you to go
[1:04:32] outside the word he said don't follow
[1:04:34] that prophet because it must have been a
[1:04:36] lying signer wonder or maybe even it's
[1:04:38] like Balaam it could have been right but
[1:04:39] then he got off in false doctrine in
[1:04:41] fornication right and so why did God
[1:04:44] allow this God allowed a prophet to tell
[1:04:46] the truth it came to pass
[1:04:48] but then he taught false doctrine later
[1:04:50] he had that he's anointed one at the end
[1:04:51] time we'd say right to prove the people
[1:04:55] whether they love the Lord your God or
[1:04:58] not so no matter what signs miracles
[1:05:01] wonders take place are we gonna love God
[1:05:03] and the word the next day or we gonna
[1:05:05] push the word aside and say well we've
[1:05:07] gotta miracle you know we're so great we
[1:05:09] can do whatever we want the miracle
[1:05:10] should make us more humble amen but in
[1:05:14] this case God is proving them he's using
[1:05:16] it as a test oh my the tests of life and
[1:05:20] that's something maybe I'll go here
[1:05:23] about 15 more minutes let me set a timer
[1:05:24] here so wear myself out okay let's hit a
[1:05:28] few more now we know this one we don't
[1:05:31] have to go there but judges 1620 said
[1:05:32] the Lord was departed from him Sampson
[1:05:36] so Sampson is again like saw both had a
[1:05:39] powerful anointing at one time but then
[1:05:42] because of their transgressions the Lord
[1:05:44] left them now with Hezekiah God was left
[1:05:47] him to try him just like job God left
[1:05:50] that maybe feeling the presence of God
[1:05:52] maybe the joy you know the anointing God
[1:05:54] left that to try him and see how he'd
[1:05:57] respond all right let's go to Psalms
[1:06:02] David had a lot of this how many know
[1:06:03] David had a lot of this where it would
[1:06:05] seem like the anointing would leave but
[1:06:07] yet God was with him the whole time
[1:06:09] oh my mercy Lord let's go to Psalms 27
[1:06:18] verse 9
[1:06:20] seven verse nine oh don't you know -
[1:06:27] David was a man that loved the anointing
[1:06:29] he said my cup runs over a man he loved
[1:06:33] the anointing but yet there was times
[1:06:36] he's like where is the Lord
[1:06:38] okay 27 9 Malachi can you read that for
[1:06:40] me amen so see David knew God could
[1:06:51] remove his face God could remove his
[1:06:54] blessing a member this is the rapture
[1:06:55] chapter remember that look at verse 5 is
[1:06:59] the rapture verse brother branham use
[1:07:00] for the time of trouble he shall hide me
[1:07:02] his pavilion and the secret of his
[1:07:03] tabernacle Isha hide me and he shall set
[1:07:06] me up upon a rock and that's something
[1:07:08] that's really striking there's time so
[1:07:10] when God promises us in the day of the
[1:07:12] rapture the days of those days he'll
[1:07:14] hide us in him but before that we've got
[1:07:16] to go through trials and God will hide
[1:07:18] himself from us sometimes isn't that
[1:07:20] striking and it's all to test us to see
[1:07:24] what we're gonna do without that maybe
[1:07:27] feeling that outward anointing maybe on
[1:07:29] our flesh hide not your face for me that
[1:07:32] means God could have hid his face from
[1:07:33] David oh my now we know the next one
[1:07:37] we'd love to read that one Psalms 51 11
[1:07:39] cast me not away from your presence O
[1:07:41] Lord take not thy Holy Spirit from me
[1:07:44] restore to me the joy of thy salvation
[1:07:47] so David knew I was like to lose the joy
[1:07:51] to feel like he was cast away from God's
[1:07:55] presence that felt like the Holy Spirit
[1:07:57] wasn't upon him anymore he knew what
[1:07:59] that was like now the real believer will
[1:08:07] pray this in Psalms 139 23 let's go
[1:08:09] there Psalms 139 23 and I think I've
[1:08:16] said this before too but I've had
[1:08:17] numerous people when I go other places
[1:08:18] and preach they come up and say can you
[1:08:22] pray for me I'll say yes what would you
[1:08:24] like prayer for pray that I can be
[1:08:26] closer to God and go through some trials
[1:08:29] they have actually asked me to pray for
[1:08:31] them to go through trials I'm like well
[1:08:34] if that's what you want to pray for I
[1:08:35] said you know what you're getting into
[1:08:38] because they want to be so pure but I
[1:08:40] think what they mean I think is what
[1:08:41] this is what they mean right here I
[1:08:43] don't know if they were right or wrong
[1:08:44] that just be between them and the Lord
[1:08:47] maybe they had a question their minds is
[1:08:49] this the right have I done the right
[1:08:50] thing and maybe they wanted God to show
[1:08:52] them if they're in the right or wrong
[1:08:53] but it was just an odd request when I
[1:08:55] don't hear very often look at verse 23
[1:08:57] search me O God and know my heart try me
[1:09:01] and know my thoughts so see there is an
[1:09:04] aspect of the believer where Lord I want
[1:09:07] you to try them I want you to I want you
[1:09:09] to show me what's inside me am I really
[1:09:11] as pure and as humble as I need to be
[1:09:13] show me if I'm where I need to be in the
[1:09:15] right place so see there's a part of
[1:09:18] believer you need you want to be tried
[1:09:20] you want to pass the test amen huh me
[1:09:24] know if you study real hard you don't
[1:09:25] even fear the test
[1:09:26] I've had many tests like that I knew
[1:09:29] exactly what was gonna be on that test
[1:09:31] and I walked out of there with a hundred
[1:09:32] percent or ninety nine that's that's not
[1:09:35] maybe that's our David's feeling try me
[1:09:37] know my thoughts let's look at the next
[1:09:39] verse verse twenty for America and see
[1:09:44] if there be any wicked way in me and
[1:09:45] lead me in the way everlasting I don't
[1:09:48] want to step outside of your Perfect
[1:09:51] will test me let me go through tests try
[1:09:53] me so I know it's inside my heart that I
[1:09:56] can go the right way with the Lord amen
[1:10:00] so see sometimes a test of life
[1:10:03] sometimes we we need them we want them
[1:10:05] we always need them but sometimes we
[1:10:07] actually want them Lord just make sure
[1:10:09] before I make this huge decision before
[1:10:11] I make this decision try me test my
[1:10:13] heart make sure everything in my heart
[1:10:15] is the right thought I don't want to
[1:10:17] have any wrong thoughts and then lead me
[1:10:19] in the way everlasting amen I got a
[1:10:23] couple more here let's uh let's go
[1:10:26] to proverbs 17 this is this is very
[1:10:29] similar to job 23 robber 17 three
[1:10:41] proverbs 17
[1:10:42] 23 Lydia could you read that for us hon
[1:10:52] I'm sorry 17-3 I'm sorry mercy I was
[1:10:55] thinking of job 23 forgive me amen
[1:11:04] so basically proverbs are saying that I
[1:11:07] am a fight refining pot I'm the pot you
[1:11:11] got to put I'm in the pot and I'm gonna
[1:11:13] come forth as gold my life is gonna be
[1:11:16] like a bunch of hot trials right I'm
[1:11:19] gonna be tested and tried and again and
[1:11:21] again and hotter and hotter and hotter
[1:11:23] and harder and harder and harder but at
[1:11:26] the end I know I'm gonna be exactly what
[1:11:27] God wants me to be amen
[1:11:29] that's beautiful Zechariah this goes
[1:11:35] back to Zechariah chapter 13 we read
[1:11:37] chapter 3 but let's go to Zechariah 13
[1:11:38] this is a scripture that jumped off the
[1:11:40] pages and really blessed my heart to
[1:11:46] Zechariah 13 9:00 right before me okay
[1:12:00] now let's look at now this is
[1:12:02] interesting I'm not sure how to place
[1:12:03] this scripture but this is in the
[1:12:05] chapter where Jesus shows himself to
[1:12:07] 144,000 because in verse 1 there's a
[1:12:09] fountain open in the house of David
[1:12:11] that's really striking but verse 8 and
[1:12:15] it should come to pass that in all the
[1:12:17] land saith the Lord two parts there and
[1:12:19] shall be cut off and die but the third
[1:12:23] part shall be left there in that's
[1:12:26] interesting that reminds me of
[1:12:27] Revelation and the vials and the
[1:12:29] trumpets but verse 9 and I will know
[1:12:32] here's what I want to go and I'll bring
[1:12:33] the third part through the fire and
[1:12:35] we'll refine them as silver is refined
[1:12:38] and we'll try them as gold is tried they
[1:12:43] shall call on my name and I will hear
[1:12:45] them I will say it is my people and they
[1:12:48] shall say the Lord is my god so what is
[1:12:52] this proving this scripture is proving
[1:12:55] that there is a calling on of God when
[1:12:59] we go through our fiery trials god knows
[1:13:02] when we go through the trial it is going
[1:13:04] to drive us to our knees have you ever
[1:13:06] been driven to your knees lately my
[1:13:07] hands up both my hands can be up
[1:13:09] different trials you go through
[1:13:11] different tests this is proving it in
[1:13:13] the scripture you are like weave gold
[1:13:16] silver being refined and then when you
[1:13:18] feel the hotness of this that's this
[1:13:20] test and trial you'll call upon me when
[1:13:23] you're suffering and it's hot and is
[1:13:25] difficult you'll call upon me and I'll
[1:13:27] answer you amen glory
[1:13:30] that's a beautiful scripture to prove
[1:13:33] that God uses the trials to drive us to
[1:13:36] our knees amen
[1:13:39] let's go to Malachi 3 now Kai 3 there we
[1:13:42] just got a couple more by the grace of
[1:13:44] the Lord
[1:13:54] now ky3 first to course chap I'm sorry
[1:14:00] burst one is John the Baptist verse two
[1:14:06] who may abide the day of his coming and
[1:14:08] who shall stand when he appears for he
[1:14:11] is like a refiners fire and like fuller
[1:14:15] slow soap rather sorry and he shall sit
[1:14:18] as a refiner and purifier of silver and
[1:14:21] he shall purify the sons of Levi and
[1:14:24] purge them as gold and silver that they
[1:14:28] may offer unto the Lord and oblation in
[1:14:31] righteousness then shall the offering of
[1:14:34] Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the
[1:14:36] Lord has the days of old and as in the
[1:14:38] former years a church why do we read
[1:14:40] this let's take this for the spiritual
[1:14:42] in the natural God had to take Israel
[1:14:46] through trials so they would offer the
[1:14:48] right kind of sacrifice and how many
[1:14:50] know after you go through a trial your
[1:14:52] worship is more sincere at the other
[1:14:54] side it ought to be it ought to be
[1:14:58] because that's what God is doing here
[1:14:59] with Israel you're really not going to
[1:15:01] offer a real pure set that's what he's
[1:15:03] telling Israel you're pure of sacrifice
[1:15:05] isn't he going to be received or given
[1:15:07] until after you go through the test of
[1:15:09] faith and then when you come out you'll
[1:15:11] love God more on the other end amen
[1:15:13] because the Bible said then shall the
[1:15:16] offering of Judah and Jerusalem be
[1:15:19] pleasant unto the Lord oh my that's
[1:15:23] beautiful the most pure offerings come
[1:15:28] from our hearts when we go through great
[1:15:31] trials of faith that's really striking
[1:15:34] oh my I think we all see at church
[1:15:38] sometimes we see we see ourselves
[1:15:39] falling away from our first love anybody
[1:15:41] ever felt like that you seem to fall
[1:15:44] away I felt I felt like that you seem
[1:15:47] like oh just not as sincere as I used to
[1:15:50] be well I think God's get ready to take
[1:15:53] us through a refiners fire then and then
[1:15:56] let us go through the fires that it
[1:15:58] might produce the right kind of offering
[1:16:00] a pure offering a pure heart before God
[1:16:04] amen
[1:16:07] praise the Lord let's go to John 15 here
[1:16:12] Saint John 15 Saint John 15 verse 1 I am
[1:16:29] The True Vine and my father is the
[1:16:30] husbandman every branch in me that
[1:16:32] beareth NOT fruit he taketh away and
[1:16:35] every branch that beareth root he purges
[1:16:38] it that it might bring forth more fruit
[1:16:41] I'm thankful the Lord cuts off all my
[1:16:43] bad branches aren't you that bad
[1:16:46] attitude that bad saying that bad
[1:16:49] thought I'm so glad he cuts off the bad
[1:16:51] ones now the hurtful part is when he
[1:16:53] cuts off the good thing you got a good
[1:16:56] faithful you have the good fruitful part
[1:16:57] of your life and God will cut you in
[1:16:59] that area and then it won't you won't
[1:17:02] see fruit in that area so see how it
[1:17:04] feels like the Lord it feels like the
[1:17:05] Lord has left you in that area I don't
[1:17:07] see fruit really coming out of this area
[1:17:09] of my life that's because God had to cut
[1:17:11] it to make it more fruitful right and I
[1:17:16] love this this reminds me of what we
[1:17:17] read it a josh with a high priest in
[1:17:18] verse 3 now are you clean through the
[1:17:22] word which I've spoken unto you amen
[1:17:25] and we could enjoy that every time we
[1:17:27] hear the word of God preached praise God
[1:17:29] we get clean if we receive it and if we
[1:17:32] take God's word and accept it in our
[1:17:34] lives we walk out of church clean by the
[1:17:36] grace of God amen
[1:17:38] abide in me and I in you as the branch
[1:17:40] cannot bear fruit of itself except it
[1:17:43] abide in the vine no more can ye except
[1:17:45] ye abide in me and this one my favorite
[1:17:48] scriptures lately I am the vine ye are
[1:17:51] the branches he that abideth in me and I
[1:17:53] in him the same bringeth forth much
[1:17:54] fruit for without me you can do nothing
[1:17:57] I shared that recently with a couple of
[1:18:01] people and they're like wow I never
[1:18:02] thought about like that because they
[1:18:04] were saying oh you and your wife do such
[1:18:05] a great job raising the children and I
[1:18:07] said I didn't do anything good I can't
[1:18:09] do anything good the only good that can
[1:18:11] come out of my life as if Jesus did it
[1:18:13] in me because right here it says apart
[1:18:15] from me him I can do nothing
[1:18:19] and they're like wow I never thought
[1:18:20] about like that I was just thankful that
[1:18:22] the Lord gives us these scriptures to
[1:18:23] remind us and to keep us humble to keep
[1:18:26] us little because without Christ I can't
[1:18:29] do anything
[1:18:30] was anybody blessed by the morning
[1:18:31] service was anybody blessed by tonight
[1:18:33] if it was if you were it wasn't me it
[1:18:36] was Christ because I can do nothing
[1:18:39] neither can you so we need Jesus all the
[1:18:42] time
[1:18:43] amen I just need Jesus all the time I
[1:18:46] always say this with with the parents
[1:18:48] when they come up and thank me for
[1:18:49] teaching their children all my child
[1:18:50] loves school or my child love your class
[1:18:53] and always tell them I can't do anything
[1:18:54] good I said it must have been Jesus you
[1:18:57] know because we have a really religious
[1:18:58] community in Copley they're very very
[1:19:00] religious
[1:19:01] at least denominational wise but they
[1:19:04] can respect that though they say
[1:19:05] okay yeah and I was telling that if if I
[1:19:08] did anything good for your child it
[1:19:10] wasn't me it was Christ in me because I
[1:19:13] am NOT gonna get any credit the Bible
[1:19:15] said no flesh shall glory in his
[1:19:17] presence or nobody say look at me oh I
[1:19:20] really did a good job for you Jesus look
[1:19:22] how great I am you know it can't be
[1:19:24] anybody kept me Perry green or Eddie
[1:19:26] Bisco or Donny Reagan or brother Branham
[1:19:29] nobody can take credit it's all the
[1:19:30] credits gonna go to Jesus Christ and for
[1:19:34] that we're grateful for it of course we
[1:19:36] honor God's servants and all of God's
[1:19:38] children you know but we realize all
[1:19:40] behind that it's all Jesus Christ let me
[1:19:43] just do two more here let's go to James
[1:19:46] James chapter 1 James chapter 1 just
[1:19:57] these are
[1:19:57] from familiar but I just want to read
[1:19:58] over again because they give us such
[1:20:00] strength in fact I sent that John 15:1
[1:20:08] to a friend on Friday morning he said oh
[1:20:10] thank you so much I needed that one I
[1:20:12] said yes sir I needed it too I know we
[1:20:17] need them we need two reminders verse
[1:20:19] two James 1:2 my brother and counted all
[1:20:21] joy when you fall into divers
[1:20:23] temptations knowing this that the trying
[1:20:26] of your faith works or produces patience
[1:20:30] let patience have a perfect work that
[1:20:33] you may be entire I'm sorry that you may
[1:20:36] be perfect and entire wanting nothing I
[1:20:39] like this if any of you lack wisdom let
[1:20:41] him ask God they give it to all men
[1:20:43] liberally and upbraideth not and it
[1:20:45] shall be given him let him ask in faith
[1:20:48] nothing wavering for he that waver
[1:20:50] there's like a wave of the sea driven
[1:20:51] with the wind and tossed hallelujah now
[1:20:56] I want to read 13 to go down 13 let no
[1:20:58] man say when he is tempted I am tempted
[1:21:00] of God so job was not tempted he was
[1:21:03] tested for God cannot be tempted with
[1:21:07] evil neither tempteth he any man but
[1:21:11] every man is tempted when he's drawn
[1:21:12] away of his own lust and enticed then
[1:21:14] when lust hath conceived it bringeth
[1:21:16] forth sin and when sin when it's
[1:21:17] finished bringeth forth death
[1:21:19] and this is why I even wrote my notes I
[1:21:21] want God to give me more understanding
[1:21:22] on this God tests but he does not tempt
[1:21:26] I want to have more understanding on
[1:21:27] that so it's like God allows Satan to
[1:21:30] tempt us but yet God allowed that
[1:21:33] temptation to come but it wasn't God
[1:21:35] that tempted us so it's a fine line and
[1:21:38] I just I'm asking God Lord just give me
[1:21:40] more understanding on that and to just
[1:21:43] another way in other words just raised
[1:21:46] my faith more and more in the midst of
[1:21:48] the trial let's end with this one let's
[1:21:50] stay on our feet let's go to first Peter
[1:21:51] chapter 1 it's right after James 1st
[1:21:54] Peter chapter 1
[1:22:05] first Peter chapter 1 verse 6 let's read
[1:22:13] verse 2 real quick just you can see this
[1:22:15] I was saying this morning how God God
[1:22:17] foreknew us by knowing our choices and
[1:22:19] that's in verse 2 that's how God
[1:22:21] predestinated us God foreknew what we
[1:22:24] would choose okay cuz some people say
[1:22:27] well oh God just chosen chose me you're
[1:22:30] just ordained and had nothing to do with
[1:22:31] what you're gonna choose no verse 2
[1:22:33] proves it elect according to the
[1:22:35] foreknowledge of God the Father see
[1:22:38] that's why we're electing chosen because
[1:22:40] God foreknew God had foreknowledge that
[1:22:42] we would love him that God loves prior
[1:22:46] to Christ more than the Methodist Church
[1:22:47] down the street that's not how it is God
[1:22:49] just knew we would believe him and trust
[1:22:51] his word for this day because that would
[1:22:54] not be fair I wouldn't be just verse 6
[1:22:57] where an you greatly rejoice though now
[1:23:00] for a season if need be you are in
[1:23:02] heaviness through manifold temptation so
[1:23:04] these Christians that Peter was writing
[1:23:06] to had many many temptations many trials
[1:23:09] persecution physically going through
[1:23:12] many trials can you relate to that
[1:23:14] anybody going through met lots of trials
[1:23:15] I am verse 7 listen that the trial of
[1:23:19] your faith being much more precious than
[1:23:22] of gold that perisheth though it be try
[1:23:24] with fire might be found unto the praise
[1:23:27] and honor and glory at the appearing of
[1:23:29] Jesus Christ whom having not seen you
[1:23:33] love in whom though now you see him not
[1:23:37] yet believing you rejoice with joy
[1:23:39] unspeakable and full of glory that's why
[1:23:42] we got to get happy sometimes at church
[1:23:44] if we're going in the midst of a trial
[1:23:45] we say even at home all the time
[1:23:47] wherever you can if your own to the
[1:23:48] midst of the trial say God help me to
[1:23:50] rejoice because the Bible said I should
[1:23:52] still have joy unspeakable and full of
[1:23:54] glory amen
[1:23:55] Lord just show me your love make me
[1:23:57] shout make me rejoice make me remember
[1:23:59] how good you've been to me praise God
[1:24:01] amen
[1:24:02] receiving the end of your faith even the
[1:24:05] salvation of your souls amen I think
[1:24:08] I'll stop right there are you grateful
[1:24:10] for the test of life amen
[1:24:14] I am
[1:24:15] to see it in job real believers like job
[1:24:17] David the highest quality of believers
[1:24:19] for their day even the highest quality
[1:24:21] of believers we'd say the bride for
[1:24:24] their day even them there was times God
[1:24:26] left his anointing the anointing left
[1:24:29] them in order to try them hallelujah but
[1:24:36] how many are grateful that God knoweth
[1:24:37] the way that you're taking tonight and
[1:24:40] when he tries you you'll come forth as
[1:24:42] gold let's pray let's close with that by
[1:24:44] the grace of Lord Heavenly Father Lord

[1:25:01] trials coming it can be kind of foggy it

[1:25:06] hard to know which way you're taking us
[1:25:09] Lord may be like we're on a ship it's
[1:25:14] very foggy or we're in a plane and we're
[1:25:17] flying the middle of clouds and not sure

[1:26:05] Lord as I go through these trials lord I
[1:26:09] know you do Lord God and I know Lord if
