[52:30] you'd be blessed by
[52:32] it praise
[52:35] God here in job
[52:41] 8 bildad I believe it was in job
[52:46] 81 he says something powerful to me
[52:49] there in verse 9 he says but we are yet
[52:50] he says but we are but of
[52:53] yesterday he's showing he said he said
[52:55] he I deare right now he says we're
[52:57] already passed he said this guy right
[53:00] here says already
[53:02] passed he says and we know nothing what
[53:06] no understanding of the word of God
[53:09] their lives were what he says he says
[53:12] and he says he says because our days
[53:15] upon this Earth are a
[53:18] shadow here the oldest book in the Old
[53:21] Testament Scholars say uh The Book of
[53:23] Job he says he says our lives he says
[53:26] right here he says they're already
[53:27] passed he
[53:28] says Shadows
[53:33] absolutely it was early in the message
[53:35] coming into this message and uh the
[53:38] message coming to
[53:39] me and To Us by the grace of God Amen or
[53:43] your pastor we always uh triy to write
[53:46] Bible studies up and witness and
[53:47] everything and one time brother Jesse
[53:49] brought this uh study and he shared it
[53:51] with me and I was able to copy it all
[53:52] down it was dealing with shadows and
[53:54] types in the Old Testament and in the
[53:57] news showing how the first prophet the
[54:00] first messenger of the church age book
[54:03] or sorry the church Ages was St Paul and
[54:06] how God used him he was a typologist yes
[54:10] he had no Bible he had the uh maybe the
[54:12] gospels rented down at that time I'm not
[54:14] sure maybe the the the the time of his
[54:17] ministry but he could he had the the
[54:19] Torah he could look in the Old Testament
[54:21] Scrolls and by prophetic vision and
[54:24] Revelation so much revelation that the
[54:26] devil had to uh God allowed Satan to put
[54:29] a a physical infirmity in him absolutely
[54:32] he he cried a couple times there for
[54:35] deliverance and God says he say my grace
[54:37] is sufficient amen but because of the
[54:40] amount of Revelation he was looking at
[54:41] the Old Testament and he pulled out all
[54:43] these shadows and types he called them
[54:46] shadows and types and I'd like to go
[54:48] through a couple of those uh by the
[54:49] grace of
[54:51] God but here let's turn first to Psalms
[54:55] 102
[54:58] verse
[54:59] 11 notice how a lot of these Old
[55:01] Testaments are calling their lives he
[55:03] say he wor about just
[55:06] Shadows Psalms 10211 he says my days are
[55:09] like a shadow that declined he says and
[55:12] I weth like glass grass he says am I
[55:14] dying out absolutely he but his days are
[55:16] like a shadow absolutely and that's the
[55:18] same thing St Paul could look and say he
[55:21] says those are shadows of what we are
[55:24] absolutely amen and Psalms
[55:27] 144:3 he says the Lord what is man that
[55:30] thou takest knowledge of him or the son
[55:32] of man that thou makest an account of
[55:34] him he says man is like to vanity he
[55:37] says his days are as a shadow that
[55:39] passes by absolutely yes they're they're
[55:42] just a shadow absolutely just look and
[55:45] examine their lives he says he says and
[55:48] and and we know from the New Testament
[55:49] teachings that today he said should be
[55:52] just like those
[55:54] days now continue on
[55:57] here
[56:00] Hebrews
[56:03] 8 1 through five it's it's uh Paul
[56:06] diving into the the high priest the
[56:08] priesthood in the Old Testament and he
[56:10] goes through and shows Christ on how he
[56:12] was the high priest absolutely there was
[56:14] a high priest in the old there's a high
[56:16] priest in the new absolutely there was
[56:18] Priest in the old he says there's what
[56:19] the fivefold and the new
[56:22] absolutely absolutely but now in verse
[56:24] five he says talking about Christ he
[56:26] who serve unto the example and the
[56:29] shadow of the Heavenly things absolutely
[56:32] as Moses was admonished of God when he
[56:34] was about to make the Tabernacle for see
[56:35] he saith thou make all things according
[56:37] to the pattern shown to thee in the
[56:40] mount absolutely what so all the old
[56:42] test everything he just shadows and
[56:44] types of what's already up
[56:46] there right sure right now in Colossians
[56:49] 216 he says let no man therefore judge
[56:52] you in meat or a drink or respect in
[56:54] holy day or of the new new moon or the
[56:57] Sabbath things he says which are a
[56:58] shadow of things to come he says but the
[57:01] body is of Christ absolutely amen all
[57:04] those things all those laws and Remnant
[57:07] things that are are trapped in those
[57:10] uh
[57:11] uh I cannot remember what anyhow all
[57:14] those the laws that were come
[57:18] up anyhow they come up he says but these
[57:21] are shadows and what types amen amen
[57:25] sure
[57:27] Hebrews uh 101 he says for the law
[57:31] having a shadow he says of good things
[57:34] to come he says and not the very image
[57:36] of things can never be with those
[57:38] sacrifices which are offered year by
[57:40] year contining to make the new com there
[57:43] uh make the comers there unto perfect he
[57:45] says he goes back he says there a shadow
[57:48] again everything that was done from
[57:50] Genesis to Malachi was shadows in tops
[57:53] amen
[57:55] absolutely now in looking at Jesus 64
[57:58] the prophet said he says the the sick
[58:00] Look to Him talking about Jesus what
[58:02] they find he says they found a Healer he
[58:04] says the sick tonight can still look at
[58:07] him and find a Healer they found him and
[58:09] what was represented he says as the
[58:11] brass
[58:12] serpent he says it was that type he says
[58:16] this was the anti-type he said the grass
[58:19] serpent he says was the typ he says but
[58:21] Christ today the Healer 2,000 years ago
[58:24] he says he was the type then absolutely
[58:28] he says the blind could look and uh the
[58:31] blind looked and could see he says he is
[58:32] the same yesterday today and forever
[58:35] absolutely now what the the first church
[58:38] age messenger he was a a typologist and
[58:41] what the prophet say he says he I can
[58:43] only teach by shadows and types
[58:45] absolutely he was uneducated he did not
[58:47] he did not have a Pharisee a
[58:50] theologian upbring like Paul did Paul
[58:53] had to lay all his down and the prophet
[58:55] just come out of the work right in a in
[58:57] a little cabin with the the wind and the
[58:59] snow blow in it didn't know wasn't even
[59:01] raised as a Christian but a heathen
[59:03] absolutely to find out he was a Son of
[59:05] God he a a son of
[59:08] man absolutely
[59:11] right glory and St Paul was his shadow
[59:14] and
[59:16] TP right right absolutely
[59:20] now he says now here he says and today
[59:22] every church every individual that isn't
[59:25] he says that cannot display that token
[59:27] of the Holy Ghost is spiritually dying
[59:29] and will die he says wowow he says no
[59:34] matter how much you believe in the death
[59:35] burial and Resurrection look see that's
[59:37] as far as denominations will take you
[59:40] right he says no matter how much you can
[59:41] repeat the across Creed repeat it
[59:43] whatever you might do no matter how well
[59:45] you're educated what theological
[59:46] experience you've had he say you might
[59:48] have a doctor's degree a Bachelor of
[59:49] Arts whatever more he goes on to them
[59:51] letters ddld d Dr Latin whatever he says
[59:55] might be your literature he says that
[59:56] won't do it he says there must be a
[59:58] token display now look what he says he
[1:00:00] says it was only a shadow for the real
[1:00:03] thing for this day he says the anti-type
[1:00:06] right he says the token must be on
[1:00:08] display he says a Jew could
[1:00:11] furnish he was in the Covenant right he
[1:00:14] says but the token wasn't there he says
[1:00:16] the Covenant was of an any effect he
[1:00:18] says so is it today my brother and my
[1:00:20] sister showing what the importance what
[1:00:23] of having the Holy Ghost on you
[1:00:24] absolutely which is accept the blood
[1:00:26] sacrifice of the Old Testament Into The
[1:00:29] New Abs which is Jesus Christ dying on
[1:00:31] the cross the blood was released but
[1:00:33] within the blood was the secret which
[1:00:36] was what the life of the blood the Holy
[1:00:38] Ghost absolutely and that's what we're
[1:00:41] depending on is that power right that
[1:00:43] lied right in that blood absolutely any
[1:00:45] other man's blood would have done it
[1:00:47] AB that
[1:00:50] lie sure no one else P out that's right
[1:00:54] but Jesus Christ that out amen amen
[1:00:56] that's
[1:00:58] right now one of my favorite types I'll
[1:01:02] say like this of uh when I come to the
[1:01:04] message you know and through brother
[1:01:05] Craig and we did Bible studies and bible
[1:01:07] studies and and even now when I
[1:01:09] witnessed to I like this
[1:01:11] uh uh fellow brothers and sisters of
[1:01:14] Christ in denomination and i' like to
[1:01:17] just poke at their minds and hey man
[1:01:19] what's your favorite nugget in the
[1:01:21] scripture you know well you know and I
[1:01:23] I'd ask him what theirs is and I always
[1:01:26] got to share this one every time I
[1:01:28] witness to somebody I always got to tell
[1:01:29] them about this and I tell them about
[1:01:31] how I said I know what and i' asked the
[1:01:33] question I said why did Jesus have to be
[1:01:38] baptized by John the
[1:01:40] Baptist they're like maybe sit like this
[1:01:43] you we have our work clothes on they be
[1:01:44] thinking maybe put his hand up to his
[1:01:46] chin like this rub his little whiskers
[1:01:48] uh kind of look this way maybe that
[1:01:50] way and I said I'll tell you right
[1:01:53] now I said it goes back to the Old
[1:01:55] Testament and now they usually get all
[1:01:57] intent and listening and
[1:01:59] looking and I say in the Old Testament
[1:02:02] what the priest what he says from what
[1:02:05] the levitical line had to take the lamb
[1:02:08] the sacrificial lamb he say and had had
[1:02:10] to wash it he said to inspect it he and
[1:02:13] made sure it was clean and fit for
[1:02:15] sacrifice I said and that's what John
[1:02:17] the Baptist what had to had to baptized
[1:02:20] Jesus Christ absolutely because remember
[1:02:21] before he baptized he says he says
[1:02:23] behold there's the Lamb of God he invit
[1:02:26] he identified the lamb absolutely he
[1:02:28] says and he knew he was pure because
[1:02:30] when he came before him he said what he
[1:02:31] says I need to be baptized by
[1:02:34] you then he finally Jesus said talked it
[1:02:37] out with him a little bit and said you
[1:02:38] know what he says he says he says just
[1:02:40] suffer these things to be so he says he
[1:02:42] says just wash me for the
[1:02:44] sacrifice get on
[1:02:48] that absolutely and just like half a
[1:02:51] time like wow that was pretty good I
[1:02:52] said that's my f one of my favorite
[1:02:54] nuggets but that's sometime about as far
[1:02:56] as we go you nomination which is all
[1:02:59] right it's
[1:03:03] okay amen so now I want to go into a
[1:03:07] little type
[1:03:08] here my
[1:03:10] pastor um brother cam there has been
[1:03:13] dealing with the uh deal with the seals
[1:03:17] he went into the breach he's been
[1:03:19] dealing with the seals uh touched a
[1:03:21] little bit on the
[1:03:22] Thunders
[1:03:24] and you know little debate or however
[1:03:26] you want everybody's got their idea of
[1:03:28] the seven Thunders and going into those
[1:03:32] things but I I I don't want to probe at
[1:03:35] what there seven Mysteries revealed in
[1:03:38] the Seven Seals absolutely it's all
[1:03:39] revealed there but in the days of the
[1:03:41] voice of the seventh angel AB he said
[1:03:43] those seven Thunders were in there sure
[1:03:46] right right but I want to look at the
[1:03:47] type of it let's just look at the type
[1:03:50] and see exactly what what the what what
[1:03:52] a thunder is absolutely am I putting
[1:03:54] this my finger on and saying this is it
[1:03:56] I don't know but I want to at least look
[1:03:59] at the type of the Thunder amen sure now
[1:04:04] here in Matthew
[1:04:07] 179 this is the Mount Transfiguration
[1:04:10] Mountain they just went up and and and
[1:04:12] and and about the Eighth Day and and and
[1:04:15] after the sixth day they went up onto
[1:04:16] this mountain
[1:04:17] Shore they saw visions and uh things
[1:04:20] were revealed and uh the the coming of
[1:04:22] the Lord Jesus Christ was open right
[1:04:24] there actually you got the chance study
[1:04:27] study that had brother Jess go through
[1:04:28] it our pastor there but here in verse 9
[1:04:31] of Matthew 17 he says and when they come
[1:04:34] down from the mountain Jesus Jesus
[1:04:36] charged them saying tell the vision to
[1:04:38] no man until the son of man be risen
[1:04:41] again from the dead right he says and
[1:04:43] the disciples asked him saying why then
[1:04:45] say the scribes he says that Elias must
[1:04:48] first
[1:04:50] come and Jesus notice the answer how
[1:04:52] Jesus brings this he says and Jesus
[1:04:55] answered and said to him he says Elias
[1:04:57] truly shall come first shall is a future
[1:05:01] tense he's pointing to the Future right
[1:05:03] he says and restore all things
[1:05:05] absolutely that's and now in our day
[1:05:07] it's already passed but in Jesus's day
[1:05:09] right then he says it's coming sure he
[1:05:12] says he says but I sayto you that Elias
[1:05:14] is already come he's looking back now
[1:05:17] right sure so he punch forward and then
[1:05:19] he points back right
[1:05:24] right he does that again in scripture
[1:05:26] one other time he does that uh as far as
[1:05:29] I
[1:05:31] know John
[1:05:35] 12 John
[1:05:38] 12 verse
[1:05:41] 23 and Jesus answered them saying the
[1:05:45] hour is come he said the son of man
[1:05:47] should be
[1:05:50] glorified he says verily verily I say
[1:05:53] unto you except the corn of wheat fall
[1:05:54] into the ground and die he says it
[1:05:56] abideth alone he says but if it die he
[1:05:58] says it bringeth forth much fruit amen
[1:06:00] showing what death is got is imminent
[1:06:03] it's got to happen absolutely so he can
[1:06:05] bring forth many Believers many sons and
[1:06:07] children of God
[1:06:09] absolutely he says he that loveth his
[1:06:11] life shall lose it and he that hates
[1:06:13] life in this world shall keep it unto
[1:06:14] eternal life he says if any man serve me
[1:06:17] he says let me follow let him follow me
[1:06:19] he says where I am there shall also my
[1:06:21] servant be if any man serve me he says
[1:06:23] him my father will honor now look right
[1:06:25] here he says ow is my soul troubled he
[1:06:28] says and what shall I say father save me
[1:06:31] from this hour he says but for this hour
[1:06:34] I came unto he says but for but for this
[1:06:37] cause came I unto this hour and look he
[1:06:40] says this father
[1:06:43] glorify thy name amen he says glorify
[1:06:47] thy name now when Ty look he says he
[1:06:51] says then there came a voice from Heaven
[1:06:53] saying I have both glorified it he says
[1:06:57] he he points to God points to the back
[1:06:59] he says I've already glorified it and he
[1:07:02] says he says and I again he points this
[1:07:05] way and then he points that way right
[1:07:07] good amen
[1:07:08] sure he says you didn't know it I've
[1:07:10] already done it he's I'm gonna do it
[1:07:12] again right amen sure he says and the
[1:07:16] people therefore stood by and said that
[1:07:18] it
[1:07:20] thunder see a type A type Thunder type
[1:07:25] other said and an angel spake unto him
[1:07:28] he says Jesus answered he said this
[1:07:29] voice came not because of me he says but
[1:07:32] for your sakes absolutely so the voice
[1:07:35] came he says I've he says I've already
[1:07:37] glorified it he says I'm gonna glorify
[1:07:39] it again amen right sure now where did
[1:07:43] the first glorification take place in
[1:07:47] scripture he says he it's already been
[1:07:49] done that' be John
[1:07:54] 11
[1:07:57] John 11:1 he's now a certain man was
[1:08:00] sick named Lazarus of Bethany the town
[1:08:02] of Mary he says and her sister Martha he
[1:08:04] says it was that Mary was which anointed
[1:08:07] Jesus with O and wiped his feet unto his
[1:08:10] hair with her hair whose brother Lazarus
[1:08:13] was sick therefore her sisters said unto
[1:08:15] him saying Lord behold he whom thou
[1:08:18] lovest is sick and when Jesus heard that
[1:08:20] he says the sickness is not unto death
[1:08:23] now remember think tight
[1:08:26] think tight right here he says this
[1:08:28] sickness is not unto death he says but
[1:08:29] for the glory of God he says that the
[1:08:32] Son of God might be glorified thereby
[1:08:35] this right here portion of scripture
[1:08:36] right here the Thunder revealed he says
[1:08:38] I've already done amen amen absolutely
[1:08:44] and in verse 11 he says these things
[1:08:45] sayith he after he said unto him our
[1:08:47] friend Lazarus sleepeth he says but I go
[1:08:49] that I may awake him out of his out of
[1:08:53] sleep amen all right absolutely tight
[1:08:56] sure he are ti
[1:08:58] now and you'll see why way we go this
[1:09:06] way of course we always go to that quote
[1:09:10] go away Jesus
[1:09:12] 63 sickest body that I know of tonight
[1:09:15] is the so-called body of Jesus
[1:09:18] Christ Lazarus caught
[1:09:20] sick something infected his body and it
[1:09:24] started sucking the very life out of him
[1:09:26] and over a matter of days he was
[1:09:29] gone he perished and he was in his grave
[1:09:33] four
[1:09:35] days corruption had set in after 72
[1:09:39] hours he says the prophet said in that
[1:09:41] kind of a heat that desert heat he says
[1:09:43] his nose is probably already sunken his
[1:09:46] face stting to
[1:09:48] worms he says it needs spiritual healing
[1:09:51] there's only one bomb off that we need
[1:09:53] that will heal he says and that's the
[1:09:54] work
[1:09:57] when Jesus came up to Lazarus did he
[1:10:00] preach just the most finest sermon he
[1:10:02] could
[1:10:03] preach saints of God what he did was
[1:10:07] bring thus sayith the Lord amen he was
[1:10:10] totally LED of the father a yielded body
[1:10:13] right there a yielded body to every what
[1:10:15] whim of the Holy Ghost to every whim of
[1:10:18] the father sure and at that time what he
[1:10:20] just had to speak the word absolutely
[1:10:23] cast out what that devil
[1:10:27] right because remember what actually
[1:10:28] inflicted at first it was the devil
[1:10:31] right right right absolutely he had what
[1:10:34] Jesus Christ had what he was he had
[1:10:36] power with God because he was God in
[1:10:38] flesh amen amen
[1:10:45] absolutely when I first come into this
[1:10:47] message I was so excited because What
[1:10:50] doctrine because of Revelation because
[1:10:52] of understanding the Bible in a way that
[1:10:54] I know 99% of the people in the world
[1:10:57] would never ever see it right I was so
[1:11:00] stirred up and uh uh we come out of
[1:11:02] Pentecost SE sign wonders and miracles
[1:11:04] and I was working in Butler Indiana one
[1:11:06] day and uh Came Upon A man he was a
[1:11:09] welder just like me just a different
[1:11:11] form of welding and I started witnessing
[1:11:13] to him and I told him about service he I
[1:11:15] told him about godhead told him about
[1:11:16] baptism this and that and he was a
[1:11:18] little
[1:11:19] impressed but then he started telling me
[1:11:21] about his his missionary friends in
[1:11:23] Africa he says he says they raised the
[1:11:26] Dead all the
[1:11:27] time he says he says it's common place
[1:11:30] over there he said they have they're
[1:11:32] packing the Holy Ghost J says he says
[1:11:34] and they raised the dead they healed the
[1:11:35] sick Everything Jesus did they do as
[1:11:39] well right but here is me all I have is
[1:11:42] what the all I have is the revealed word
[1:11:45] of
[1:11:46] God right but he was blinded because of
[1:11:48] what signs wonders and miracles anointed
[1:11:51] ones at the end times we're doing the
[1:11:54] exact same works of Christ he said but
[1:11:56] within they're sick absolutely sick with
[1:11:58] that what that's what that what which is
[1:12:00] what man-made
[1:12:01] Creed right absolutely spiritual death
[1:12:05] false word yes sure
[1:12:08] right a man right now
[1:12:10] uh working with a precious brother
[1:12:16] there year and a half ago he told me
[1:12:19] about his his wife's having some issues
[1:12:21] physical issues I said I said brother
[1:12:24] he's I'm going to pray on this it wasn't
[1:12:26] even a couple days later his wife got a
[1:12:29] clean bill of health it stirred him up
[1:12:32] so much he told our
[1:12:35] boss and I was on the phone talking to
[1:12:38] another brother and he was saying
[1:12:40] Brother s we don't need all this and we
[1:12:42] don't need all that and then my boss
[1:12:44] phone call comes through I said hold on
[1:12:47] a second I held my personal phone right
[1:12:49] here and I picked up my work phone right
[1:12:50] here so he could hear you know just I
[1:12:53] said what's up boss he's like hey I
[1:12:56] heard about your
[1:12:59] prayer oh you did he goes yeah he goes
[1:13:02] good job good
[1:13:04] job I said God answers prayer doesn't he
[1:13:07] he goes yes he does yes he does he said
[1:13:09] all right I'll let you go
[1:13:11] bye I said did you hear that went back
[1:13:14] to my other phone I said did you hear
[1:13:15] that he said I said that's why this
[1:13:17] stuff is so important because we have to
[1:13:20] express Jesus Christ right now amen amen
[1:13:25] amen and then he didn't give me a
[1:13:26] problem after that now just recently a
[1:13:29] month later that same man's wife had the
[1:13:31] same
[1:13:32] issues you know what he did you know you
[1:13:35] know what he told me nothing this man
[1:13:39] still kind of lives like the world he
[1:13:41] took up Faith by
[1:13:43] himself and said Simon I prayed over
[1:13:48] my he said I took her back to the doctor
[1:13:51] he says and those little tumors he said
[1:13:52] they're shrinking he says and they don't
[1:13:54] know why they're doing it
[1:13:58] still talks like the world Saints but he
[1:14:01] understands the power of God absolutely
[1:14:03] he understands what the power of prayer
[1:14:06] he had a dream one time and the God
[1:14:07] showed him how to pray he said Simon he
[1:14:11] says God show me he said to get on his
[1:14:12] my knees he said and hold my hands
[1:14:15] like I said brother did you hold your
[1:14:17] hands he go
[1:14:21] absolutely absolutely praise God
[1:14:26] the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:28] absolutely denomination still packing
[1:14:30] power but it's power in the name of
[1:14:33] Jesus Christ right now here in the third
[1:14:35] seal he says now that's what the reason
[1:14:37] today that the revivals that we're
[1:14:38] supposed to have he says we have
[1:14:40] denominated we have have we have
[1:14:42] denominational revivals we haven't had a
[1:14:44] real stirring no no no sir he says don't
[1:14:47] think we got revivals we haven't even
[1:14:49] down south there
[1:14:50] denomination he says he says oh they got
[1:14:53] millions and millions in church members
[1:14:55] J say but no Revival nowhere not true
[1:14:57] word Revival he says the bride hasn't
[1:14:59] had the Revival yet he says there's no
[1:15:01] Revival there no manifestation of God to
[1:15:03] stir the bride yes see we're looking for
[1:15:06] he says he'll take those seven unknown
[1:15:07] Thunders there to wake her up again he
[1:15:10] will send it he promised now watch he
[1:15:12] says she was
[1:15:14] dead talking of what he's looking back
[1:15:16] at the types he said the bride was
[1:15:21] dead church was dead he says now the
[1:15:24] church now if the churches would forget
[1:15:26] their Creeds he says forget their dogmas
[1:15:29] and just take the
[1:15:31] Bible not a message book The Bible he
[1:15:34] says plead the promise that it would
[1:15:36] come to effect to them but see Jesus
[1:15:38] said with your Traditions make the word
[1:15:40] of God not affect to you he says well
[1:15:43] that's the same thing today with
[1:15:46] spiritually he says see the spiritual
[1:15:48] bride of today the so-called Church she
[1:15:50] takes the word of God he says and she
[1:15:52] won't accept it she accepts Creed and
[1:15:54] dogas instead he says therefore the
[1:15:55] world he said the words not effective to
[1:15:58] her he he says because she tries to
[1:16:00] inject her Creed with the word and it
[1:16:02] won't work now he's dealing with this
[1:16:06] bride of this day now he was dealing
[1:16:08] with the denominations of there there
[1:16:09] wasn't too many come out at that time
[1:16:11] but at As Time moved
[1:16:15] on Revelations 18 is taking place come
[1:16:18] out of my people be not partakers of our
[1:16:20] sins correct
[1:16:22] amen now here's what I want to talk to
[1:16:24] right here
[1:16:25] here same sermon third seal yes he says
[1:16:31] they don't want it they don't want God's
[1:16:34] word how many battles have we've been
[1:16:36] into they don't want God's word they
[1:16:38] don't want the correct Doctrine laid
[1:16:40] forth they don't want Elijah to come and
[1:16:41] put that set put that wood back in order
[1:16:44] absolutely on the altar absolutely what
[1:16:45] so the fire of God can come down and
[1:16:47] seal them with the Holy Ghost right
[1:16:49] right amen that's what I had to do he
[1:16:52] said because she held her Traditions she
[1:16:55] kept the word of God from being she kept
[1:16:56] the word of God from being not effect he
[1:16:58] says now the same on spiritual Eve she
[1:17:00] don't want she wants to keep her to
[1:17:03] traditions and get away from the word of
[1:17:05] God she holds against to the
[1:17:06] denominations and their Creeds and
[1:17:08] traditions the traditions of her Elders
[1:17:11] instead of taking the word of God I'm
[1:17:13] there there's one quote in here so
[1:17:16] powerful he says that when the promise
[1:17:18] of the word in the last days is brought
[1:17:20] to her she will not receive it because
[1:17:22] with her Traditions he says like the
[1:17:24] Hebrew bride did he says the real word
[1:17:27] through manifested proven Vindicated she
[1:17:30] won't have it why won't she have
[1:17:35] it you know people don't
[1:17:38] want uh the gifts the N the nine
[1:17:40] spiritual gifts in the
[1:17:42] church why won't they want it right
[1:17:45] they're what to keep the church clean
[1:17:49] correct everything God's got for us we
[1:17:51] want it yes absolutely I want it
[1:17:53] whatever God's got for me we got to have
[1:17:56] it he says why won't she want these
[1:17:59] things because that's her
[1:18:02] type she can't do it that's right and he
[1:18:05] says he says she can't beat her type
[1:18:09] wowow and neither can
[1:18:11] [Laughter]

[1:18:33] Revelations 18 they come out from among
[1:18:35] them where what church what was Judas
[1:18:37] the Pharisees sades scribes I don't know
[1:18:40] but he came and followed Jesus Christ
[1:18:42] right right modern day Judas and what
[1:18:45] they can't beat their Ty that's right
[1:18:48] amen right can't beat
[1:18:52] it see it it's predict she would do it
[1:18:56] how you going to keep from anything
[1:18:58] that's why we can look back to the Old
[1:18:59] Testament look to the New Testament and
[1:19:01] if you read the scripture and identify
[1:19:03] yourself there he says that's your time
[1:19:06] every time you see Jesus Christ do
[1:19:07] something that's me every time a gentile
[1:19:11] Rises up Old Testament New Testament
[1:19:14] that's me because what that should be
[1:19:16] your type and you cannot be your
[1:19:21] type Hallelujah absolutely what is the
[1:19:25] power you say how could it be all things
[1:19:27] in the Old Testament took place in the

[1:20:31] for it all right God promised in the
[1:20:33] last days that he would manifest he says
[1:20:36] and would vindicate his word to her and
[1:20:38] still she wouldn't do
[1:20:40] it ah the power of a
[1:20:44] type yes
[1:20:48] absolutely now
[1:20:50] notice back to that first
[1:20:52] glorification Lazarus uh laying in the
[1:20:56] grave and Jesus comes up to Mary and
[1:20:59] Martha says he says he I am the
[1:21:01] resurrection and the life actually to
[1:21:02] Martha I believe at that time and then

[1:21:07] Martha never lost faith at all I even
[1:21:09] now or whatever you say sure

[1:21:15] there he says with Mary and Martha he

[1:24:13] play We No
[1:24:16] Tuesday oh I'm so excited we're right at
[1:24:19] the end SS of God something's in me just
[1:24:22] uh uh it's kind of depressing but it's
[1:24:25] kind of it's a mixture of emotion
[1:24:27] absolutely I can imagine when a a woman
[1:24:29] goes into labor she's kind of ready for
[1:24:31] her to be over but she's scared about
[1:24:32] what's
[1:24:34] ahead right oh yeah absolutely that's
[1:24:36] what the the travailing in labor yes
[1:24:40] that's right
[1:24:43] now the second
[1:24:48] Glory John 13:31 he says therefore when
[1:24:52] he was gone out Jesus said now is the
[1:24:53] son of man glorified and God is
[1:24:56] glorified in him if God be glorified in
[1:25:00] him God shall also glorify him in
[1:25:02] himself and shall straight wi glorify
[1:25:04] him John
[1:25:06] 171 these words spake Jesus lifted his
[1:25:08] eyes to Heaven said father The Hours
[1:25:10] come glorify thy son and thy son shall
[1:25:13] also glorify
[1:25:15] thee so the voice thundered said I have
[1:25:18] glorified it and I'll glorify it again
[1:25:21] what was it both were what death
[1:25:26] burial
[1:25:28] Resurrection living again being seized
[1:25:31] by the devil life taking out dying then
[1:25:37] God giving the life back in rising up
[1:25:41] amen that's what that type Thunder type
[1:25:44] revealed both of them death
[1:25:47] burial Resurrection
[1:25:51] amen one thing I really like I was
[1:25:56] when I come on the message and sints of
[1:25:58] God you get such a real understanding of
[1:26:00] the things of God in this
[1:26:02] message you come down with a
[1:26:05] sickness it
[1:26:08] is one of the things revealed in this
[1:26:10] message every sickness every time Jesus
[1:26:13] healed somebody you cast out a devil
[1:26:16] right it's a spirit it's an evil spirit
[1:26:19] you come down with a little cold you get
[1:26:20] a little wooy whatever this and that an
[1:26:22] evil spirit is trying to enter to season
[1:26:25] 20 your organs to a ba cell and
[1:26:27] everything right and in demonology what
[1:26:30] the prophet comes and breaks it
[1:26:33] down amen a lot of my co-workers I
[1:26:36] explain this to them so they can
[1:26:37] understand it it doesn't it's very very
[1:26:40] simple if you have a mask if you have a
[1:26:43] a cancer a MK or a tumor whatever come
[1:26:45] up to that person I say like this he
[1:26:47] said anyone sick now what is that mass
[1:26:50] it's just a multiplication of dead cells
[1:26:53] correct just one cell just takes starts
[1:26:57] multiplying the wrong way and somehow a
[1:26:59] demon comes in there and is able to
[1:27:01] attach itself right to that cell and
[1:27:03] then it starts multiplying it exactly a
[1:27:06] back something that's not
[1:27:09] original and then what because what it's
[1:27:11] a life in there it has it's growing
[1:27:14] because it has a life right so I tell
[1:27:17] the people you come up with sick or your
[1:27:19] someone's got cancer whatever you go up
[1:27:21] and you lay your hands on them by the
[1:27:23] grace of God and all you have to do I
[1:27:25] say is cast the life or the demon out of
[1:27:29] cancer or tumor that demon right there
[1:27:32] is commanded to go it's got to go and
[1:27:35] now all this left is that mass right
[1:27:37] there of living tissue of of
[1:27:40] cells and just how the prophet explained
[1:27:42] it he says he always told people said
[1:27:44] now you may get sick before you get
[1:27:46] better because what the life is gone now
[1:27:48] that body's there and it's going to blow
[1:27:50] because it's dying but then it'll start
[1:27:53] the blood will start and through and
[1:27:54] it's heal itself and now you'll be
[1:27:57] healed absolutely right amen it's a
[1:27:59] healing it's a casting out of a spirit
[1:28:02] right that's how that's how simple the
[1:28:04] healing is yes you just have to cast The
[1:28:08] Demon out right remember that's
[1:28:11] natural yes sure now when the prophet
[1:28:14] first met that me that angel there he
[1:28:17] says I knew that same voice that spoke
[1:28:19] to me all along he say that the first
[1:28:21] time I've ever seen it like that he says
[1:28:23] but I know that voice voice he said fear
[1:28:25] not I am set from the presence of the
[1:28:27] almighty God to tell you that peculiar
[1:28:29] birth and peculiar life been always
[1:28:32] misunderstood with men said your
[1:28:34] peculiar life he say your peculiar Birth
[1:28:36] has been indicated that you you uh
[1:28:37] you're to take a gift of Divine Healing
[1:28:39] to the peop of the world and what he say
[1:28:41] he says sir I'm I'm uneducated he says I
[1:28:44] cannot go he says I'll be with you he
[1:28:48] say sir I'm uneducated he say like can I
[1:28:51] go he said the people wouldn't believe
[1:28:52] me he said as the prophet Moses was
[1:28:54] given two signs he says you'll be given
[1:28:56] two signs said first that you'll be able
[1:28:58] to detect diseases by your hands taking
[1:29:01] the patient by the right hand and if
[1:29:03] you'll be sincere and pray get them to
[1:29:05] believe and be sincere when you pray
[1:29:07] nothing shall be stand before your
[1:29:09] prayer not even cancer amen right that
[1:29:13] was the word of the Lord to a prophet
[1:29:16] and he took that promise and he ran with
[1:29:18] it amen amen I thank God he did so I
[1:29:22] started thinking about cancer
[1:29:25] I typed in little Google how many stages
[1:29:27] are there in
[1:29:31] cancer four stages in cancer wow four
[1:29:35] not three not two not 10 four four and
[1:29:39] it said this now get look at look at the
[1:29:42] Spirit behind everything he says
[1:29:44] numbering stages use the tnm I'm not
[1:29:46] sure system to divide cancers into
[1:29:49] stages now look most types of cancers
[1:29:52] have four stages numbered from 1 to 4
[1:29:55] often doctors will write down the stage
[1:29:57] in Roman
[1:29:59] [Laughter]
[1:30:02] numerals is that Roman influence
[1:30:05] absolutely Roman system abolutely
[1:30:08] start with Roan
[1:30:11] Ro he was bad but he was
[1:30:15] heal amazing how majority of doctors
[1:30:18] write cancer stages in
[1:30:22] Roman
[1:30:26] lower he says usually means that the
[1:30:29] cancer he say number one stage number
[1:30:31] one or Roman whatever he says usually
[1:30:34] means that a cancer is relatively small
[1:30:37] he says and contained within organ it
[1:30:39] started with starts with one person one
[1:30:43] part of the body one tiny little part of
[1:30:45] the body stage two usually means the
[1:30:48] cancer has not started to spread in the
[1:30:50] surrounding tissue he said but the tumor
[1:30:52] is larger than stage one
[1:30:55] the problem in the church somebody
[1:30:57] somebody the devil anoints one person in
[1:30:58] the church and now death what in the
[1:31:01] church has hit the Bible says a little
[1:31:05] leav leth the whole room right right a
[1:31:09] little Strife or contention or a root of
[1:31:12] bitterness
[1:31:13] however but stage two it's still just
[1:31:16] with that one
[1:31:18] person cool stage three usually means
[1:31:21] the cancer is larger it may have started
[1:31:24] to Sur to spread into surrounding
[1:31:27] tissues and there are cancer cells in
[1:31:29] the lymph nodes in that area so now it's
[1:31:33] move from one person to the next right
[1:31:37] right number
[1:31:39] four means the cancer is spread from
[1:31:41] where it started to another a body organ
[1:31:44] this is also secondary secondary or
[1:31:46] whatever cancer sure but a lot of times
[1:31:50] the cancer goes from organ to organ but
[1:31:52] especially to the Lim noes now why the
[1:31:55] limp
[1:31:56] nodes the primary function of all limp
[1:31:59] nodes is the production of lympocytes
[1:32:01] which help defend the body against
[1:32:04] microorganisms and against harmful
[1:32:06] foreign particles and de breeze to the
[1:32:09] bloodstream sounds like the nine
[1:32:11] spiritual
[1:32:13] gifts because let's say a cancer comes
[1:32:15] into this church oh my speaking in
[1:32:17] tongues interpretation should call it
[1:32:19] out absolutely the prophet was waiting
[1:32:21] for the day he says where the sins to be
[1:32:24] called out by the gifts of the Spirit
[1:32:25] amen an the fire right there see the lyp
[1:32:29] Noid the lipoid right there in Peter
[1:32:31] kept that church clean picked up the L
[1:32:34] just like that absolutely amen right
[1:32:38] sure here the prophet Awakening Jesus 63
[1:32:42] he says talking in a group of doctors
[1:32:44] the other day he said he says I read
[1:32:45] your book on Divine Healing I said I
[1:32:48] guess you criticize he says no sir I
[1:32:49] admit that you're right he says he said
[1:32:53] thank you brother show and he said
[1:32:54] brother Brandon we have a record that
[1:32:56] when we tell a person that's got a
[1:32:58] malignancy or something going to kill
[1:33:01] him or an AER already ready to burst or
[1:33:04] Tu
[1:33:06] tuberculosis it depends on what attitude
[1:33:08] they take right amen if they get all
[1:33:12] tore up oh my goodness stage
[1:33:16] three he says they die right
[1:33:19] away it's all on your attitude right he
[1:33:23] says but if they take the attitude well
[1:33:25] dying is just part of
[1:33:28] living that's spiritual too he says it's
[1:33:31] all right he says when I die he says you
[1:33:34] know it almost retards the case it
[1:33:36] almost sends that cancer right
[1:33:38] in submission or whatever call it
[1:33:42] remission absolutely so it depends on
[1:33:44] the attitude absolutely somebody in the
[1:33:46] church Rises up has a bad attitude just
[1:33:48] love on them a little bit it might just
[1:33:50] it might just win them right back to
[1:33:52] Christ and get the church all me
[1:33:54] everybody
[1:33:55] happying I love brother amen and brother
[1:33:57] Benjamin and our sister over here and
[1:33:59] our sister over there and praise be to
[1:34:01] God you could be the limp the sights in
[1:34:03] this
[1:34:04] church keeping everything clean just
[1:34:06] full of joy and and happiness absolutely
[1:34:09] just giving you Revelations out as God
[1:34:10] giv them to you abely just singing songs
[1:34:13] of hymns and whatever just being Joy all
[1:34:15] about
[1:34:16] you keeping it clean absolutely prise
[1:34:19] God they'll be able to identify who's
[1:34:21] got it because they won't want to be
[1:34:22] around you
[1:34:24] right right on sure he says the metal
[1:34:27] attitude you take towards it will bring
[1:34:29] he says now the mind won't do it but if
[1:34:32] you get that attitude together with
[1:34:33] something got life in it like the Holy
[1:34:38] Ghost remember the four stages of
[1:34:42] cancer what was Joel one the Palmer worm
[1:34:46] the Locust the cany worm the caterpillar
[1:34:50] yes sir four stages of spiritual cancer
[1:34:55] MH Revelation
[1:35:00] 61 he says and I saw when the lamb
[1:35:02] opened one of the
[1:35:03] seals and I heard as it were the noise
[1:35:06] of what he says a
[1:35:08] thunder one of the four Beast saying
[1:35:11] come and see and what they see a white
[1:35:14] horse rider another one opens up a red
[1:35:18] horse rider a black horse rider and a
[1:35:21] pale horse rider yes sir stages of
[1:35:25] spiritual
[1:35:27] cancer what Satan had moved into it into
[1:35:30] the original true church and started
[1:35:33] indoctrinating them and getting a hold
[1:35:35] of the the like the the the the fivefold
[1:35:39] right there and using them to corrupt
[1:35:41] the entire system exactly yes sir
[1:35:44] absolutely remember the first first th
[1:35:47] that revealed
[1:35:49] what death burial Resurrection second
[1:35:52] death burial Resurrection
[1:35:55] why is this so important to the church
[1:35:57] ages the seals it's going to bring what
[1:36:00] a death burial Resurrection right
[1:36:07] absolutely but what we have four beasts
[1:36:09] to fight them for what living creatures
[1:36:13] are zooms absolutely Matthew Mark Luke
[1:36:15] and John what can defeat all these
[1:36:17] absolutely you know
[1:36:20] pinpoint of the Holy Ghost absolutely
[1:36:22] ser he says' but the Book of Revelation
[1:36:25] shows that the Antichrist Spirit would
[1:36:27] come into the church and defile it
[1:36:28] making it lukewarm formal and Powerless
[1:36:30] oh my it exposes sating revealing his
[1:36:33] Works attempting destruction of God's
[1:36:35] people and discrediting of God's word
[1:36:38] sure spiritual cancer entered in the
[1:36:40] church right there right and that Pale
[1:36:43] Horse Ral will continue on to ride out
[1:36:47] now the last type I want to deal with
[1:36:49] here just moving over to the side maybe
[1:36:51] a little parallel right here ending
[1:36:54] the end here mat I'm sorry Mark
[1:36:57] 4
[1:37:03] yes in the same day when even was come
[1:37:06] he said unto them let us pass over unto
[1:37:08] the other
[1:37:10] side and they when they had sent away
[1:37:12] the multitude they took him even as he
[1:37:14] was in the ship he says and they were
[1:37:16] also with him other little ships and
[1:37:18] there arose a great storm of wind and
[1:37:20] the waves beat upon the ship so it was
[1:37:22] now full
[1:37:24] and he who Christ was in the hinder part
[1:37:27] of the ship asleep on a
[1:37:29] pillow and they wake him and said to
[1:37:31] master care us not that we
[1:37:34] perish and he arose and rebuked the wind
[1:37:38] and said un the sea peace be still and
[1:37:41] the wind ceased there was a great
[1:37:46] call the prophet preaches on this on
[1:37:49] awakening Jesus in
[1:37:52] 63 he
[1:37:54] says now brother gromer and brother here
[1:37:57] and many other he says about 15 years
[1:37:59] ago we come through this country he says
[1:38:01] and there was a Revival prophet's
[1:38:02] Ministry he said there was a Revival
[1:38:05] moment people wanted God people wanted
[1:38:08] to see Power of the Holy Ghost yes you
[1:38:11] listen to the prophets ear early sermons
[1:38:15] Faith he just gave his testimony in a
[1:38:17] couple other testimonies pull from a
[1:38:19] maybe a little passage here and that was
[1:38:21] it but what they wanted to see a real
[1:38:23] living God absolutely amen the angel was
[1:38:25] standing right here next to him and he
[1:38:27] and by the grace of God patient patient
[1:38:30] would be
[1:38:31] healed and made well amen that was a
[1:38:35] Revival he said for 15 years he says in
[1:38:38] my he says you know what we're doing
[1:38:39] today just talking about it he says the
[1:38:42] Revival is over it's been over a long
[1:38:45] time we're just living on the results of
[1:38:47] it waiting
[1:38:50] waiting because he's talking about as he
[1:38:53] lay in the ship there and the disciples
[1:38:55] were up rowing before the storm and they
[1:38:58] just had a mighty move of God the day
[1:39:00] before and he goes into how Peter was uh
[1:39:04] uh how he met Christ the first time and
[1:39:07] how he called him son of arjah and said
[1:39:09] I knew I knew it was in there then the
[1:39:12] little John says well when he did this
[1:39:15] and he did that he said I knew he was
[1:39:16] gone absolutely and all the disciples
[1:39:19] would take turns and giving their little
[1:39:20] testimonies and then the storm come they
[1:39:24] were what talking about the Revival that
[1:39:26] had already taken place and as they were
[1:39:29] talking about and focusing
[1:39:31] back a storm come up wind it's going to
[1:39:37] destroy the children of God
[1:39:41] right he says and now maybe he says
[1:39:47] uh he says all the disciples were doing
[1:39:50] the same thing rejoicing living on what
[1:39:52] he had they had seen done probably the
[1:39:54] day before he say the week before he say
[1:39:56] a year before they were testifying about
[1:39:58] it giving oh great testimony of it how
[1:40:01] about that as Jesus in their day was
[1:40:04] resting between
[1:40:05] revivals how do we know maybe he's
[1:40:07] resting now between revivals
[1:40:11] yeah right he puts that little question
[1:40:14] he maybe there's one up the road
[1:40:15] according to this
[1:40:16] type
[1:40:18] right absolutely and the prophet type
[1:40:21] this what his 15 the Rev have taken
[1:40:23] place was 15 years and he said maybe
[1:40:25] there's another one up the road he said
[1:40:27] if this is the type of that he says we
[1:40:28] got another one coming amen glory yeah
[1:40:32] he says yeah I said yeah absolutely he
[1:40:36] says all you say he now wait a minute
[1:40:39] brother Brandon getting a little over
[1:40:40] the line now Jesus don't have to rest he
[1:40:43] said yes he did he said God made the
[1:40:45] heavens and the Earth in six days and
[1:40:46] the seventh he rested see he needed that
[1:40:49] absolutely but remember after the
[1:40:51] seventh day he began working again
[1:40:54] certainly he did he rested Jesus was
[1:40:56] tired laying on the boat he was asleep
[1:40:58] and resting and maybe after the toil of
[1:41:00] the Revival that's just passed maybe
[1:41:02] he's resting like like he was then he
[1:41:04] says I hope that's it right and so do I
[1:41:07] I believe we got something coming amen
[1:41:13] amen now he says this real powerful
[1:41:16] thing I'm I I really believe God's going
[1:41:20] to move he has been moving tremendously
[1:41:23] in my life this year absolutely amen
[1:41:26] I've got so many
[1:41:28] testimonies not saying anything but I'm
[1:41:30] giving God the glory I know he can do
[1:41:32] more absolutely amen but for a couple
[1:41:35] years before that was a little drier
[1:41:37] didn't see as much Supernatural didn't
[1:41:39] see this and that but remember when a
[1:41:42] storm hits when I drilled my own
[1:41:44] eye when that man was down in the
[1:41:47] concrete dying we prayed over them sure
[1:41:50] I hit myself right in the forehead with
[1:41:51] a gas regulator
[1:41:54] God kept me of all
[1:41:57] that he says oh Lord the simple little
[1:42:01] thought he says awaken Jesus
[1:42:03] Lord we have not so used his spirit and
[1:42:07] his faith so long till it merely goes to
[1:42:13] sleep talking about everything this and
[1:42:15] this and this if we can if we focus on
[1:42:17] the past if we focus on the Miracles or
[1:42:20] the things that were done in the past
[1:42:23] what about today right what have you
[1:42:26] done today who have you prayed over
[1:42:27] today who have you witnessed today and
[1:42:29] if you continue to look at your paast
[1:42:31] and not dwell with the spirit be love
[1:42:32] the spirit he
[1:42:34] says he merely goes to sleep on you
[1:42:38] right he merely goes to sleep on you
[1:42:41] when you get into any situation no
[1:42:43] matter how tough call him on the scene
[1:42:45] and wake him up he will show up amen he
[1:42:51] will
[1:42:52] deliver you're witness God we all got
[1:42:55] testimonies and he can do it again and
[1:42:57] he'll do it again
[1:42:59] absolutely sure it
[1:43:02] was he says as it was in our souls he
[1:43:05] says let us Shake ourselves tonight let
[1:43:07] us arouse ourselves and get our own
[1:43:09] sleepiness away from us so we can see
[1:43:11] that he's still in the
[1:43:17] boat now saints of God were seeing all
[1:43:20] these
[1:43:21] prophecies this nation is in such a
[1:43:24] turmo right now it's
[1:43:27] unparalleled probably since what the
[1:43:29] Civil War Revolutionary
[1:43:31] War we're at that time
[1:43:35] again a storm is coming Saints right
[1:43:39] because what the type says there
[1:43:42] is nazarus had to face death at on Jesus
[1:43:46] Christ when his storm came he had to
[1:43:48] stand before councel after counsel after
[1:43:51] counsel then he had to face
[1:43:53] himself
[1:43:55] right that's our
[1:43:58] types and if we're the final
[1:44:03] anti-type what do we
[1:44:06] do we can't beat our
[1:44:08] types right right that's right so look
[1:44:11] so what we we are promised in this day
[1:44:14] of body change amen we are promising
[1:44:17] this day a Deliverance Christ said if we
[1:44:20] stick with his word of God he said will
[1:44:22] not even taste
[1:44:24] that right because what our type is what
[1:44:28] Enoch our type are the three Hebrew boys
[1:44:31] in the fire absolutely no three
[1:44:36] absolutely right those three and the
[1:44:38] fourth one was what like unto the son of
[1:44:40] man that's right the fourth horse rider
[1:44:43] was like unto death sure right there
[1:44:45] bringing death but the son of man was
[1:44:47] right amongst us amen Enoch called a
[1:44:50] body change Elijah C what a char change
[1:44:53] absolutely call a chariot Rose it up
[1:44:56] these are our types they cannot fail
[1:44:58] when you see things in t turmoil the
[1:45:01] world is what gonna fall apart
[1:45:03] politically financially everything's
[1:45:04] going to fall apart that's types you
[1:45:07] cannot you can't beat it right remember
[1:45:10] in this day there is no military to rise
[1:45:13] up and fight on this Earth there is
[1:45:16] nothing the type for this day is total
[1:45:19] annihilation of the believer right but
[1:45:22] we we have the Rapture type and it
[1:45:26] cannot be beaten amen amen because
[1:45:29] Christ is is in you living in you he
[1:45:32] promised it and he will fulfill that
[1:45:35] type absolutely no one else was given it
[1:45:38] like this stage absolutely we have a
[1:45:40] we're in the most wickedest age and God
[1:45:42] delivers it on of us Glory Glory
[1:45:44] absolutely that is the power of our time
[1:45:48] am amen amen she cannot be
[1:45:51] beaten she can't beat her type see it's
[1:45:53] predicted she would do it so how are you
[1:45:56] going to keep keep from anything he says
[1:45:58] now the only thing to do is be happy
[1:46:00] that you are in now just the next chap
[1:46:03] or the next paragraph he says
[1:46:05] this now if you want to write them down
[1:46:07] of course you know them all Jesus John
[1:46:10] he's he's going to our types Jesus John
[1:46:13] he says Joel
[1:46:14] to Paul he says 2 Timothy 3 Malachi 4th
[1:46:18] chapter he says John the Revelator
[1:46:20] Revelations 10 he says going to our
[1:46:21] types he's pointing to our types
[1:46:23] he says see exactly what would take
[1:46:26] place now he says to the church what is
[1:46:29] it what is our type he says the
[1:46:31] Incarnate Word made flesh among his
[1:46:34] among his people again see he says they
[1:46:37] just won't believe so in this day our
[1:46:40] promise our type is What What In This
[1:46:43] flesh and in those flesh is the
[1:46:44] Incarnate Jesus Christ amen Christ
[1:46:47] Living what through his
[1:46:49] bride that cannot be beaten yes
[1:46:54] final scripture here Colossians 1 127 to

[1:46:58] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:47:00] among the Gentiles which is Christ in
