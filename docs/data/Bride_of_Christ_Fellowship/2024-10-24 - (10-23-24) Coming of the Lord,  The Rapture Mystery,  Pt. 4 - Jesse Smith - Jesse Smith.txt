========================================

1958 the sudden secret going away of the church hallelujah oh yes I did want to say uh we have a a carrying Sunday um I'll be getting pizza by God's grace so um if you can bring aside we'd appreciate that I think my wife's going to do uh meatballs is that right H so my wife's going to bring meatballs as a side a pizza there so maybe somebody can bring a salad or you know fruit or vegetable or whatever you feel led to bring by God's grace brother William don't have to bring anything he just has to bring himself Hallelujah has to come and eat and brother I wore my uh Ghana shirt I forgot I forgot to tell that to Sister Naomi we have a Ghana a girl from Ghana in our class I'll show it with to real quick here we wore their Ghana shirts on yesterday oh beautiful beautiful now she changed at at she changed at uh recess time she don't want to wear that out for recess I don't blame her you don't want to get that you don't want to get that dress dirty there so but I was so thankful and uh God is good so I was thinking about uh her mom said you need to go Ghan today I said okay I'm going ghanan by God's grace so thank you for those clothes and everybody I walk by in the hallway they're like whoa what a shirt brother Jess or not brother Jess Mr Smith um and I told each one of them you know we have this Godly Gan family in our church and the family showed love and made and they're like wow they gave you the clothes and so uh the love of God is surely being shared by God's grace so thank you it's a joy I try to wear it once a year that that's to school so we want to look here to the word of God and uh the coming of the lord The Rapture mystery part four kind of felt led to come back to this here I felt like if I get away from it too long I might not get back to it so I want to get to it uh that song says recognizing your day serpent seed perfect Faith the breach and the message of Grace I preached through all five of those and now we're on the coming of the lord The Rapture mystery the next will be God in Simplicity the spoken words Original Seed and then I feel like I'll have this series done brother William it's been a great series started in 2024 it's been refreshing I have loved just going slowly through brother Ram's sermons and seeing the thoughts that he preaches and uh seeing the battles we'll see here tonight another battle he's he fought here but uh just knowing that if he made it through by God's grace and everything was all right we'll make it through by the grace of God as well have to trust in the Lord with all of our hearts and lean not to our own understanding Hallelujah Psalm 27 now brother R reads this uh for his text from the Rapture December 4th 1965 now that's where I'm hoping to get to I can't promise that um I can hardly promise when I say 15 more minutes you know I can hardly get to that so I'm not going to promise anything but um so I was listening to that been listening to it off and on over the last few weeks and uh try to get to that I like to preach through that whole sermon as well it's I think it's only an hour and 40 um he was getting rushed out Remember by there they were in a hotel room and he was getting rushed out by the woman and uh he said well I finished you know he finished and then he's like I got 10 pages left of notes on the Rapture boy I would like to get those notes wouldn't you brother I do about anything to get those notes see what the prophet had in his heart that he could he said he couldn't get to 10 pages of notes on the Rapture but God is good God's faithful and the Holy Ghost will guide us into all truth praise God no matter what we have as long as we're born again uh we have the Holy Ghost uh to give us all have need of so Psalm 271 um I'll read 1 through 4 it's a long longer text there and then we'll all read 5 five of course is speaking of the Rapture according to brother brandom he saw a type in here so one through four I'll read that the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid reminds us of Jesus who said Don't Fear those who can destroy the body right fear Him who can destroy both the body and soul in hell verse two when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though in host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though War should rise against me in this will I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple this is a man after God's Own Heart what's his greatest desire to be in the house house of the Lord hallelujah let's read verse 5 1 2 3 for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated God bless you okay so I'm going to try to watch time as well here by the grace of the Lord Hallelujah now we want to just briefly review this is part four we looked at part one now part one we looked at uh the first part of this sermon 1958 the sudden secret going away the church in Parts two and three we kind of looked at uh the attack against the Scofield bible and the uh uh the pre-tribulation Rapture and then we looked at you know Matthew 24 and then we looked at second Thessalonians chapter 2 looking at the scriptures about the Antichrist and whether the church would see the Antichrist I don't think there's any uh proof in the uh Bible that the church sees the Antichrist um there may be hints of course and you know we don't know all the details um but there will be a little bit of a a squeeze time where we'll hear about the mark of the beast but Jesus said in Revelation 3:10 we will not go through that Temptation with the rest of the world he promised because we kept the word of his patience that hour will not come upon us hallelujah and I had a great you know I had I felt like it was a great understanding to me that actual Mark can't even be laid down while the 144,000 are on the Earth right because then they'd be killed right or they if they took the mark they' take the mark of the beast right so that Mark actually has to be laid down I believe during the second half of the seven-year Great Tribulation period to me that just seems logical um so that's just a interesting thought they're thinking about the timing I'm going to make a video on that pretty soon I had a request to make a video on the order of the events of the tribulation period uh but uh then now here's part four I'm just going to briefly finish uh this the highlights from this sermon 1958 the sudden secret going away the church uh last time of course we looked at remember the the attack on Pearl Harbor right and how brother man was bringing out this idea of a sudden secret destruction right um uh and then he uh he told us the scriptures that prepared him so we'll get to that here now we left off with brother Ram uh getting into this tax case so he was right in the mix of his uh in the middle of his tax case where he had been uh sued here he was sued for uh past taxes owed on money that he'd signed over people would write out donation checks to his campaign and they just write out William brandom he'd sign it over and give it right over to the church but the IRS came on and they uh said you owe taxes on all that because it was in your name they didn't write out the brandom Tabernacle and so brother random fought it as hard as he could uh and it became a very hard thing for for him but he says this I've been in trials for the last 3 or 4 months under heavy fire so not physical fire with guns or anything like that but spiritual fire right criticizing right uh uh attacks on him on his character he's going to tell us about it here under heavy fire trying to accuse me of doing something that was wrong by passing the money through this Tabernacle here for the meetings which our trustee board here has signed the Declaration and there's not a person that's ever attended in my meetings but what I publicly announced that this money was taken up directed through the church and now they say because I place it through the church I was trying to defraud the government and want to give me 20 years in Fort lenworth Kansas for it so he was threatened with 20 years in prison because of all this money that flowed through there now at some point I forgot to do this we need to do a inflation calculator on 1958 on 40,000 he only had to pay 40,000 so I wonder the inflation might be probably around 300,000 or something like that maybe maybe more um and then remember God had a millionaire in his church brother da who he baptized when he was in his 90s and uh the millionaire just loved brother brandom as a brother and his ministry and that brother paid off his debt right and then he could go and he could say uh my debts been paid I've been cleared he said I'm free Hallelujah his debts been paid he said pardon that was the pardon sermon if you listen to the pardoned I think it's 1965 either 63 or 65 and so he ex he enjoyed the freedom of being pardoned and he says I said what is the word wrote over our courthouses Justice it means no more than it wasn't even wrote there said when everything that your own people told me to do I've done it and now you say that they're not with the government anymore how can you you'll settle one and prove it out then they'll dig something else up so brother Braham said there was numerous people working at the beginning of the case he did everything they said those people left they brought in new people to bring bringing new charges against him talk about discouragement that'd be a hard three or four months and the church said get new accusations new new things and they're just digging up trash against you sounds like a presidential campaign doesn't it accusing him and just trying to find all the dirt in their history right we've seen all the dirt in both of their histories the candidates well I guess all three right because it switched at the end and now we got a a different candidate here for the Democrats right he says uh not only that but they wishy-washy so brother BR says they're wishy-washy and remember we went through how uh these other preachers went through a lot of persecution John Wesley they threw stones at him uh they yelled till he left their churches he had to go preach out in the fields uh Martin Luther was arrested but then he was rescued from the arrest and had to dress up like a soldier uh in order to uh uh translate the Bible into his German language Hallelujah but man said the prophets of God were always attacked by the government this proves brother was another proof brother R was a true prophet of God the government went after him to try to stop him discourage him keep him off the field remember Rome went after John the Baptist Jesus Paul and they kept digging up accusations after brother Bram had already met their request and threatened with 20 years in prison brother Ram says so I have one hand to hold on to that's God's unchanging hand and I didn't even plan to sing that song so that was a nice little confirmation there knowing that he will respect truth and honor that's what God respects it'll have to come forth in justice but to let you know there's in not hopes nowhere only in the coming of the Lord he said such a day we're living in such an awful time he says when even the church itself the church peoples the denominations those they're so concerned about their little differences till they won't even fellowship with one another and not taking warning that the coming of the Lord is at hand men such as Billy Graham Jack Schuler or Roberts and many of the Great evangelists Charles Fuller who has an Outreach to the whole world now radio Outreach that's that's what he's talking about a radio Outreach right so what's wrong with a radio Outreach nothing what's wrong with the YouTube Ministry nothing right it's an Outreach it's trying to help people he said they do everything they can to warn the coming of the Lord and those own men those men who try to do right is the men that our government tries to tear to pieces I said to someone Mister 28 years of my life I've laid on the altar of God to try to do right and I want someone to look me in the eye and tell me if I ever beat anyone out of anything ever stole anything in my life by the grace of God I'm clear that's what he would told he would tell the lawyers in those meetings look me in the eye and tell me what did I ever steal from anybody and and then they said well brother baham did you go to your church board and tell them you were doing such oh no I'm sorry I i' I've Mis I misplaced my yeah I misplaced my call I jumped ahead sorry he says uh that means no more to that than the snap of your finger he said they said you're guilty anyhow brother Brandon and you're a dictator in your church you snap your finger and your church does what you tell them to do he said oh I said how unjust can men be that's actually a sign that the church is a good church if they listen to their Pastor yeah amen hallelujah now as long as they're telling you to do the word of God hallelujah that's right he said uh he said you gave people the gifts when their homes burnt so they were digging into brother braham's records of his giving with the money brother baham gave money to people when their homes burnt down we've sent a little bit but since I don't know the people I didn't send a whole lot but we've done the same thing here's your checks where you gave widows hundreds of dollars and paid their rent for them our church has done some of that over the years right and done things like that did you ever go to your church board and tell them what you're doing I said ' no sir and they said 'why didn't you do it' he said the Lord told me in his word I like that that's what we need to say when the L we say the Lord told me say the Lord told me it was in the Bible amen hallelujah right I like that shirt a guy had on he said want to hear from God open your Bible that's right oh I want to hear the voice of God I want to hear yeah open your Bible Hal then you'll hear it I got a I got a prophecy for 2025 uh to hear the voice of God open your Bible and read Hallelujah he says um why didn't you do it he said the Lord told me in his word don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing hallelujah praise God he says well then you're trying to plead Your Case by the Bible but we're judging you by a law I said which is the high highest law man's or Gods he said I'll take gods and look because he say with God's God's people got him out of trouble Hallelujah now of course that didn't happen to everybody right didn't happen to John Baptist didn't happen to Paul didn't happen to Jesus right but God delivered his prophet in this in this generation hallelujah hallelujah now brother R I'm just going to paraphrase or I'm sorry hit the highlights of the last few parts of this sermon because I want to move on uh I've listened to of course numerous times uh he ends this sermon with a story about the armor company uh Rancher who had a son that was to be married how many remember the story okay so uh there there's a rich man I think he he said he lived in uh uh I don't know Iowa or some can some some Colorado some some Midwest Western State and uh he said he owned a ranch though far away and and he he wanted his son to get a a wife right and so he sent his son away and and and uh uh to his Ranch and and the the people knew that the son was coming to look for a wife and he said all the women dressed up in their paint he said they're Flappers they cut their hair and and their high heels on and they had a big uh how many remember the story now that I'm get to okay Mercy heard it many times I never heard it but what I loved it Hallelujah and he said the the the the son's I'm sorry the Rancher son walked in there he see all these girls dancing he's like I've seen this before this is and he was he said I'm just disgusted with the way they act they're they're all you know rubbing up to him uh do you want to marry me and they're they're just trying to impress him with their looks and their their Frills and their outward appearance and this the Rancher son he's tired of this he's seen this before and he said all of a sudden he Le Peak back in the back room of the dance hall and there's a girl washing dishes and he saw she was going outside to to dump out the water and he said excuse me I'm going to go talk to her and he goes out there while she's dumping the dishes and and he says I now it's a long it's I'm shortening a long story right he just didn't you know see her one time and want to marry her you know he knew she had character he said I've seen your character because he was there a few days and they had all these parties and everything like that he said I've seen your character he said I like your character you're not painting yourself up you're not trying to be something that you're not I like how you work I like how you you're focus and you've got the character that I want to marry this is the kind of character I want to marry and she's like oh you would never want to marry me he said and then she he got on his knee and said will you marry me she said me what what what okay right and he and he uh he didn't slip the the ring on her finger he said in one year I'll be back he said save up your money get your wedding dress in one year I'll be back a year from today I'm coming back now this a doesn't it's not a perfect type because we don't know the day or the hour he said but in one year I'll be back make yourself ready well the the son left and all the girls were disappointed but pretty soon they saw her you know over the course of 12 months they saw her buy a dress and all these things and and they'd walk into the room and she'd have a dress on what do you got a dress on for who you who you marrying she tried to keep it a secret as long as she could but as that year came down to close uh she told him I'm I'm I'm giving you my two weeks notice you have to find somebody else to wash the dishes amen hallelujah and then the the the cousins found out and they started joking and and teasing her oh you think this Rich guy's going to marry a dishwasher a little nobody like you and uh she just she just brother man said she just stuck her chin up in the air and said he promised Hallelujah and brother said that's what we've got we've got a son who's promised us he'll marry us hallelujah we're not as pretty as other churches not as fancy as other churches but God's not looking for outward he's looking for inward character Hallelujah glory to God I like that story amen I wash dishes a lot well not a lot Mal I washes them now but I used to thanks for washing dishes buddy he's helped me out a lot by God's grace but you know uh it came down to those Final hours and it was coming it was exactly a year from from the time and brother said she stood out there all day in her wedding dress and the whole time the cousins are walking around mocking her maybe kicking dust on her brother R said she just stood there he promised he's coming oh he's not coming for you he gave me his word he's coming for me yes and brother said the the the sun was going down and brother is using this to show the Rapture hallelujah praise God and the sun's going down and the the pretty soon the cousins are just tired of teasing her but she stands out there anyway and pretty soon he starts hearing the horse Hooves Hallelujah and pretty soon breaking through uh uh the the the sunset I'm sorry the sun yeah the sunset there is a carriage and there's a handsome man on there and he pulls up really fast and all the cousins are waking up and he jumps off there brother said he grabbed her gave her a big kiss and he said come with me it's time to go home and he said he he she put he put her in there and they and she waved goodbye I'm going to my future home hallelujah praise God brother said it's a type of Jesus Christ rapturing us away at a time when we don't know the day or the hour but we got to get ready Hallelujah so brother ends with that story to say the wife has made herself ready Hallelujah I'll say like this church it don't it don't always look pretty the Christian life isn't always flashy and signs wonders and miracles sometimes there's dishwashing got to get your hands uh all well you know got to get your hands dirty Hallelujah so he ends with that and then he ends with this verse Matthew 24 where the Bible said Jesus said there will be one left and one taken that's the story of the woman the the young woman the dishwasher was taken the others were left hallelujah amen so this is the scripture brother r ends with he said uh it's he said that we have to have preparation and we've got to have our meat in due season Hallelujah and that's what we need today we need the word of God In Due season to keep us ready for the Rapture hallelujah amen now I'm going to move on now so that's about the end of that sermon it was a beautiful message if you haven't listened to it I'd encourage you to do it praise God now I want to uh before I get to the Rapture 65 I I want to rehearse the six reasons the Rapture is pre-tribulation because remember these famous guys Tucker and U John rich and of course uh other people they always attack the pre-tribulation Rapture because they can't see it in the scripture but I just heard brother maram say it today the reason they can't they can't see it is because they're not ordained to see it and I'm talking about from God's perspective now from God's perspective God knows who's going to receive it and who's not going to right and from God's perspective it doesn't matter who Wills or runs it's God who shows Mercy hallelujah amen but from man's perspective the elect say I'm going to choose to follow Christ with my free more agency Hallelujah so brother says and a brother sent me the quote wonderful brother who supports this church he sent me a quote this weekend he said help me understand that brother Ram says if you're not saved today he said God has made a way for you to be saved today he said it's called free moral agency Hallelujah he said God gave you something you can do about it Hallelujah and he said help me understand this I saides I said you can understand it because there's two perspectives from God's perspective all that the father has given him will come but from man's perspective the Bible says choose you this day whom you will serve Hallelujah am amen so that that that quote fits perfectly there's something we can do about it we got to bring our free moreal agency into subjection to the word of God hallelujah everybody understand so anytime you talk about free war agency you're talking about from man's persp itive not God's it's just like Works versus uh you know the works debate are we saved by works works or or faith right it's just like that all right uh works is what man sees faith is what God sees hallelujah we're not saved by works we're saved by grace but if you have Grace if you receive Grace then you got peace Hallelujah and then if you got the love of God love motivates your faith faith causes you to work hallelujah oh that's right amen now I'm not going to ask this but can anybody name the six reasons the raptures pre-tribulation anybody got it memorized I didn't think so that's why I thought I'd go over it hallelujah hallelujah just a little joke there I sometimes forget all of them too the first reason is the Great Tribulation period is described as trouble for Israel in Daniel 12 vers1 but it's uh and also Jeremiah 30:7 it's called the time of trouble it's called Jacob's trouble and it's trouble for the foolish virgins we can see that in The Parables right we can see in the the parable of the the 10 virgins and it's trouble for Sinners of course right because they get sudden destruction but not for Holy Ghost filled Saints Hallelujah there's nothing in the Bible that says the bride will go through the tribulation period the bride now the church will but not the bride Hallelujah the second reason there's no mention of Christ's bride or church in the tribulation text in the Book of Revelation the word church appears 19 times and I'm reading course out of my book that I wrote that's why I wrote it so I can reference it hallelujah it's been a great reference too uh the church appears 19 times in Revelation but the word is absent from Revelation 3:22 to 22:16 you don't see in any of those chapters 4 5 6 7 all the way up to 22 you don't see it so if the Bible's silent on the church the church must be off the Earth Hallelujah the church must be gone to be with Jesus Hallelujah that's right amen hallelujah clear it's it's plain to see that Hallelujah now there are a few times of course in Romans I'm sorry in Revelation 14 and 16 where uh the Bible talks about the church or the bride and it's just it's placed there so because Jesus knew we'd have we'd have the Book of Revelation for 2,000 years and we would read over these texts and the Bible re uh Records that we should be encouraged as we read the book of Revelation Hallelujah and then the Bible also said come out of her my people in Revelation 18:4 right so the only people that could come out would be the bride Hallelujah right so we can see that now reason three I'm going to go quickly like I said I'm going to try to get quickly through you the bride or true church is specifically promised a pardon from God's Divine wrath okay that's in 1 Thessalonians 5:4 you are not in darkness that the day should overtake you as a thief and then 1 Thessalonians 5:9 I love this remember I told you there's one preacher he goes to bed every night I forget his name he goes to bed every night saying this verse for God hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain Sal by our Lord Jesus Christ what a good way to close your eyes and rest Hallelujah God's not appointed me to wrath he's appointed me to Salvation Hallelujah 1 Thessalonians 1 ver10 and to wait for his son Jesus from Heaven whom he raised from the dead even Jesus which delivered us from the Wrath to come Romans 5:9 much now more being justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him him remember that good old verse I didn't not on here I could have put on here that good old verse uh Genesis 19 God will not suffer the righteous to be punished with the wicked Hallelujah he thank God he's the same yesterday today and forever if God saved a righteous foolish virgin like lot if God saved him from the wrath of God God Will Save anybody from the wrath of God who believes God's word amen even just a small portion of it Hallelujah that's right a man I you know I didn't get the lot on my double-minded series I didn't get the lot lot was so double-minded he's like uh homosexuality is awful take my daughters what the church said he was so double mind no one no wonder the Bible said he was scarcely saved he barely was saved see double-minded oh he recognize oh Abomination wouldn't it be Abomination to give your daughters a bunch of sodomites Hallelujah right so that that's that serious going on Hallelujah probably will one day I'll probably get back to it by God's grace uh Revelation 3:10 because thou has kept the word of my patience I will also keep thee from the hour everybody say the hour of Temptation which will come upon the whole world what's that the mark of the beast to I'm sorry to try them that dwell upon the Earth see all these tests we go through church they're just trials God's trying us he's refining us like gold refined in fire hallelujah amen amen it's just making us love God more it's making going to serve God better it's going to make us more thankful later on down the line why is this guy and his wife so happy over here because they've seen 40 Years of God bringing them through every trial amen and see God protected the next two generations amen hallelujah he's seen it he has enough experience to know that God backs up his word hallelujah some of us younger ones we don't have that much confidence yet you know we're just still going through the trials and learning the hard way sometimes but God promised these things Luke 21:36 watch ye therefore pray always right like the Bible said pray without ceasing don't get a break on that when we are supposed to pray all the time I also will keep thee from the hour Temptation NOP I'm I'm off nope I said wrong watch ye therefore pray ours that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all things that shall come upon I'm sorry that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man how uh how many like the word Escape that's that's a that's a beautiful word right there you'll Escape all things and stand before the son of man the body of Jesus Christ the glorified body hallelujah amen you'll Escape it if you watch and pray always keep watching keep praying we should sing that song in South America just keep on praying for the Lord is not just keep on praying sing it with me if you know he hear your cry for for the Lord has promised and his word is true just keep on pray he'll answer you how many remember that now nobody well it's been too long brother now we know what we got to do today Hallelujah before we leave this place we got to sing that you remind me if I forget and then our our verse for tonight Psalm 275 for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall hide me he shall set me up upon a rock so look at this look at this picture you're in a tabernacle and you're up on a rock how does that work I don't know but it's glorious amen I know it's inspired Hallelujah there must be some rock sitting in some Tabernacle somewhere Christ is the rock hallelujah amen he's the water he's the Rock Amen he's the line he's the lamb amen he's the door he's all things through the believer Hallelujah now darn could you while you got your Bible there darn could you look up that Genesis verse about the dove because my wife found a real good type of the Rapture a couple well it's been a while now I want brother Mercy I think I'm preach a whole sermon on it by God's grace if I want to give credit where credit's due this wasn't my thought my wife had a good thought uh reason number four the the raptures pre-tribulation the bride or true church is foreshadowed to receive a part pardon from God's Divine wrath so there's five examples I put in the book three are Old Testament events and two are Jesus's Parables that foreshadow the bride's pardon from Divine wrath everybody say Enoch ready Enoch missed the flood right he was pardoned he didn't have to do that he have to go through that uh now Noah was pardoned uh from the destruction right so that's another partial type and third lot now we know those two are foolish versin right but you have en O then you have two foolish virgin types uh lot was pardoned okay uh and then the Jesus parable on the King's son the true marriage uh Remember The Man Without the Garment he's cast out where there's weeping and nashing of teeth right that's got to be the tribulation period because he misses the wedding he misses the marriage supper of the Lamb Hallelujah right and then uh the the the the parable of the wise and foolish virgins right the the foolish virgins are are are kept out the door shut and they can't get in right so they can't get into the marriage so what's left for them the tribulation period right so there's five uh five types all right now let me see look at my next one okay that that one let me look at six okay yeah so darl what's that verse could you Genesis 89 now I'm gonna preach a whole sermon on this hopefully by God's grace put that up there hone would you put it up therea I been going kind of fast FAS here I'm just trying to hit the highlights now let me know if you see the Rapture in here but the dove found no rest for the soul of her foot and she returned unto him in into the ark for the waters were on the face of the whole earth then he put forth his hand took her and pulled her in unto him into the ark you see it brother he to he puts out his hand and he snatches her up and the church said remember that whole sermon I preach on herazo anybody remember that coming okay jogging the memory okay he said I'll bring all things to your remembrance harpazo means to snatch out of the way what does what does Noah do and what does the Bible say uh Solon said my love my Dove is my one defiled ah Hallelujah can God show sisters Revelation for sure Hallelujah see he snatches out and brings her into the Tabernacle The Pavilion the place of safety hallelujah oh my it's beautiful praise God so thank you hun for yielding to the Holy Spirit she stepped out so God bless you hone Hallelujah so now that's another one I could put in the book If I ever do a review probably won't but if I ever do a revision reason five Paul and Jesus taught the Rapture was imminent at an unknown day and hour like an approaching Thief while all the other views can be numbered right all the other all the other views if Jesus comes in the middle of tribulation you can count the days he'll be there on that day if he comes at the end you can count the days he'll be on the days he'll be right there on the day right the the pre-tribulation Rapture is the only one that has an imminent or unknown day and hour of the Rapture Hallelujah that's right everything else you can calculate by days right Daniel's got then Daniel's got like 35 days after the three and I'm sorry after the seven years right that's in Daniel chapter 12 I mean there's all these numbers of possible times right you would just have to know all you'd have to do is just watch you know I'm talking about foolish virgin foolish virgin we just have to watch on CNN or whatever it is uh when two prophets come out and they start tormenting uh that area they're going to make it not rain right and then they're going to uh turn the water to blood wait till that happens right from that day because remember they have three and a half years right three and a half years then they'll die three days they'll be raised up and raptured that's the middle of the tribulation period but after that then you have the vials and the trumpets and all the last things uh Battle of armagon at there that you have all those things going on and they're all numbered by days because it's part of Daniel's 70 weeks Hallelujah but the bride is unknown time he could come at any hour but his wife has made herself ready Hallelujah she's ready any time amen why CU she sealed in the Soul by the Holy Ghost Hallelujah she's sealed into the Rapture Hallelujah that's right that's what the Holy Ghost is for it's sealed until the day of your Redemption it's a seal it's a permanent Mark right it's like a bre on a cattle but it's on the soul Hallelujah that's what the Bible says the seal the brand the imprint it's eternal life Hallelujah now the sixth and final reason the Rapture is the removal of the grace of God for the Gentiles in preparation for the Antichrist public Revelation and God's return to the Jewish people hallelujah so that's the six reasons because it's because this is more dispensational right uh Jesus calls it the times of the Gentiles another word you could call the church ages amen when the church ages run out uh Jesus has to come down and whoever is Holy let him be holy still whoever is righteous let him be righteous still he's only going to Rapture the holy ones hallelujah praise God then whatever you are whether you're filthy or unjust whatever you are he's going to leave them here but he's taking the holy group no matter whatever you were at that moment he's taking the holy group and then he's done with the Gentiles he said he's cutting off the Gentile uh Branch he's grafting in the Holy Branch back into the holy tree Israel back with the Holy Ghost my if they did that with David and Gideon and all these men and Solomon uh and Joshua and Moses if they did that uh with the Old Testament what are they going to do in the New Testament hallelujah amen I'll tell you what they're going to do they're going to get the Holy Ghost Hallelujah then they're going to stand on Mount Zion when Jesus comes back to them Hallelujah and they're going to sing the songs of uh of Heaven Hallelujah that's what they're going to S the song of Moses and the lamb the the Bible says oh my glory all right now now that was a good review there how going do on time okay about 30 minutes left okay I I'm planning to stop at 8 o'cl I told Lydia Mali I'm planning that but I can't I can't I can't promise now let's look at the Rapture 1965 I'm trying to preach this uh through now brother Ram starts off and he he says this great quote now I want you to see here in this sermon brother Ram was at a Full Gospel businessman's fellow ship it wasn't a church building it was a hotel in fact the brothers uh brother Loris has been there he's actually been there um to that that specific place in I think it's Arizona and brother Brooks has been there because he they had Harmony in the desert there they have this uh concert message concert where all the message people sing their song it's been a beautiful concert they've had lots of concerts uh it's still there I think it's the Rada I can't remember which one it is but brother braham's there and and and and he's there preaching to a lot of different denominations and brother R brings up the book I think it's the seven Church age book if I'm not mistaken he says there's too much Supernatural Vindication of God's written word of this hour for something not to be approaching us now it's too real it would be astonishing to you just to let you know what is really taking place many of you strangers perhaps hear these men get up and make these remarks about a message of this hour and so forth what what they're getting at is God's promise for this hour what he promised he would do and we see him scripturally vindicating just exactly what he said he would do he said it's foretold hits just exactly perfectly each time because it's God saying it so brother's in front of a group of a bunch of different denominations businessmen rich men I say middle class men a lot of different men there because they could afford to run out the hotel and have a service and he's he's slowly or he's just given a little little bit about his ministry right he doesn't come out and say I am Malachi 45 and6 he doesn't say that he doesn't say I am Revelation 10:7 but he says he says it later Revelation 10 has been fulfilled in our day he said the seals have been opened in our day so he's just laying a little bit he's just putting the just putting the bait on the hook there I I put some worms on a hook this summer trust me it it was hard of course I didn't catch many fish brother just he's just kind of putting the bait out there seeing who's interested seeing who wants to really get into the depths of the word of God but he said these men around me are talking about a message of the hour it's the scriptures that's already foretold glory amen hallelujah that God's vindicating right now Hallelujah Luke 17:30 Malachi 45 and 6 right Matthew 17:11 Amos 37 all these verses we know and love uh Revelation 3:14 the seventh Church age messenger he said said they're being fulfilled right now and it's available for those who want to hear it Hallelujah I'm glad brother William I had no chance to hear this unless God brought it to me I was in a Pentecostal church that was not Holiness there was no way I was going to hear brother brandom because I never heard of him when I was growing up I was you know there's no way for me to hear this except God came looking for me he left the 99 to go get the one Hallelujah that's the only way the message came to me Hallelujah is if Christ the shepherd came and found his sheep Hallelujah am there's no way because because I can look at the denomination my mother's in now I can see where it is it's a million miles from brother Brandon a million miles my mom had never heard of brother brandom that tells you enough right there and she was in the Assemblies of God and brother BR said remember this in 64 he said I've sent a million of my children to the Assemblies of God remember that yeah he said why would I say why would I send my uh children to a a a death trap he says because brother Braham knew there's wise and there's foolish Hallelujah and he knew the elect would catch the real baptism of the Holy Ghost and come out of her my people hallelujah hallelujah listen to that he said I sent a million of my souls to the Assemblies of God churches but now the Assembly of God brother Mercy won't even talk about them their own Papa they won't talk about their own Daddy I'm talking about spiritually now Hallelujah call no man father now Church you not don't have many fathers right lots of instructors thousands of instructors not many fathers so here brother Ram is doing a very good uh job of just humbly trying to let the people know about his ministry Hallelujah and again that is my definition somebody asked me go go listen to our first podcast that we did the title is what is the message anyone who asked me what the message is I'm pointing to that quote it's the scriptures God's fulfilling not all the tapes and the church said amen it takes a mature person to understand that Hallelujah it takes a very mature person a humble person to admit that it's the but yes the tapes point us to the Bible they make us go read the Bible we can listen to the sermons something different about that man first time I heard his voice I wept and cried while chewing tobacco and playing video games right Z and I just turn off the I I turn off the video game and just listen to brother Brandon I just I cried I I never heard a man preach like that he says he says if a man I don't care who he is would try to make such a prediction of the scriptures about him he said there's one chance of about 10 million that those could come to pass if a man told you a certain thing would happen it would happen a certain time one out of 10 million and then the place where it would happen would be about one chance out about a 100 million and the time it would happen again goes on and on the way it would happen what it will be happening and so forth it's just beyond a guess when we see it so perfectly each time every time then it's God Amen all these people around brother Ram said every time he did discernment he was never wrong now there's a few times on tapes he says like a last name uh he says like the last few letters of a name wrong like stout or strong like he just mixes up but he's coming out of the vision back into the back into the realm right when was the last time any of us tried to see a vision and then read everything in the vision and then say it out in the real real world why should it say real world this is the shadow lands this ain't the real world man said Heaven's way more real than this Hallelujah but see that that's that's just a small mistake he still got all the other discernment right he said it's God saying it like I told you I went through over 1,200 some quotes about thus sayith the Lord every time I heard brother say thus said the lord it's never failed people don't understand it but that's CU they don't want to understand it Hallelujah they don't understand uh humility they don't understand praying about something or waiting on the Lord they don't understand even Isaiah's prophecy is still not fulfilled today Isaiah said death will be swallowed up in Victory Hallelujah that's the one we're waiting for hallelujah it's almost 3,000 years old we're still waiting on it praise God that doesn't mean we throw out Isaiah that means we bring in the Holy Ghost and Give Me Faith to believe it Hallelujah give me patience to wait Hallelujah till it's fulfilled Hallelujah give me patience Hallelujah he says and then we turn right back in the Scriptures it may seem foreign to us but we turn right back in the scriptures without even knowing where to look and the Holy Spirit brings out and just puts the whole word together what's this emphasis whole time the word the scriptures the word vindicating the word scriptures prophecy foretold the word of God hallelujah without even knowing where to look he says it puts the whole word together makes the picture there to show us just the hour that we're living in he says we're changing dispensations Hallelujah of course the Rapture but said we're at a corner it's easy no I'm sorry he says it it's easy uh to build a wall he says he said but a brick mason has to turn a corner when building a wall he says everybody just lays their bricks right down the same row like a certain denom ation start starts rolling down the road it's all right but when you get to them turns where you have to turn back the other way and brother R said God isn't building a wall so God started here I'll just say it like this God started here with Martin Luther he starts building a wall actually set that poting right there that was Martin Luther boom now just imagine him up there bang bang bang dig the hole there's Martin Luther they build this wall a Luther Revival pretty good Revival I'm walk around the church here not Saints but pretty much here God's going to change a corner what does he send he sends another prophet of God he says he sends John Wesley Hallelujah John Wesley's message is planted on then there and they start building the Bricks now there's not bricks in here right but you just give the picture he's got to turn a corner he's got to turn a corner with a messenger amen someone who's anointed Hal someone who's got the word of God hallelujah and so he builds and they build after uh John Wesley and brother said they got to this corner I can't get back there casea can I but then God laid down a William Seymour hallelujah praise God and then they just after him they just build on build on build on and brother said but now Hallelujah brother but now they get he said we're at a corner we're changing dispensations Hallelujah and he plants in Malachi 45 and 6 Hallelujah and it changes a corner and now oh it takes a prophet of God to change a corner you can't just go along with isza now you need a prophet of God and church where are we on this wall Hallelujah where are we I hope by God's grace we're close right here hallelujah anybody can put up a straight wall brother said it takes a brick mason it takes a prophet it takes a church age Messenger to turn a corner hallelujah amen he said now God isn't building a wall he's building a house see there's many cuts and turns he's predicted here in the Bible oh I'm glad I know it brother William I'm glad I know about the cuts and the turns he said and the turns anybody could try to make a turn but it must be according to the blueprint if it isn't it's got to be torn down again Hallelujah brother bam said uh that's what it had to be uh there had to be like four little revivals because God is building a building the seed fell into the ground the church looked like it died but God said I'll restore sayith the Lord hallelujah praise God Amen that's right it's got to be according to the blueprint so the blueprint was Luther uh Wesley Aza or William Seymour and then brother brandham Hallelujah that's right four walls to restore the body of Christ brother man said four corners hallelujah how many believe we're turning a corner amen we're almost we're about to go up to heaven in this corner hallelujah praise God I got 15 minutes okay now right after this brother man he still not read his text in this sermon he says this Christian businessman he says and the open doors the Lord has given us and through the businessmen he said I praise God for his goodness and the fellowship of your people what do you mean brother Braham you're you're fellowshipping with a bunch of denominational Devils that's not how brother Braham s it now I know I've said recently the last few weeks most people aren't saved in there that's true but there are some good people in there but church can you can can can everybody understand this there was a lot more saved people in the denomination back in 1965 because there's fewer and fewer saved all the time there's more and more deception all the time everybody see that and Jesus said I have to shorten the time just to make sure somebody gets saved hallelujah oh I would have fellowship with them them Devils brother Jesse how would you preach for them Baptists because there's got some they got to have some seed in there praise God didn't Abraham preached with the Baptist lot Hallelujah didn't he didn't he show love to the Baptist the foolish virgin absolutely and now notice he just you know brother ad just gave him a little bit right when I went to the Baptist Church last year brother um I gave him uh I gave him the revelation of the baptism of the Holy Ghost I think I had Malachi or somebody I said I had three little fires I think I I lost one fire right I had two fires but I showed them the Revelation and the P afterward was he said he said I was walking on clouds after that service what is it like to walk on clouds I don't know I'd like to know I've DC I like to dance maybe it's like that but he says I I think I called Malachi up I said I I said we want the filling of the Holy Ghost to this Baptist congregation there's women with cut hair saying yeah I want the filling do you I hope so would you like toh fill your head up with hair maybe by God's grace no I put a fire I I put that just stuck that fire like on my arm I said that's the outer Court the three the three parts of man I said that's when you feel it you get goosebumps and you maybe you fall on your knees you're just you're you're uh you're just overcome by the presence of God I said but then Mali give me that other fire I put that fire on my human Spirit up here this is where people can speak in tongues and prophesy and all these things they can see Visions but then that will leave and I showed this can leave this can leave I said but there's one more part to a Believer ah Hallelujah I said Mali give me that fire I said but God wants to go deeper than this deeper than this God wants to go down to the soul of man Hallelujah and that's where you're SE Jesus said I come to give you rest to your soul not your flesh not your human mind but the soul of man Hallelujah and then the pastor come up he said he said brother Jesse he said you don't know what you did he said my dad's a pastor too and he said we he's been uh kind of fussing with me the last few months about how the tongues are the evidence of the Holy Ghost and you straightened out tongues to I Just Want to Thank You for preaching what God told you to preach he said it solve the problem in the church amen hallelujah praise God I didn't even plan on preaching on tongues I just and just come up during there that's because God he's a discerner of the thoughts and Tents of the heart praise God and I said like this before people will pull on the preaching they'll get something Hallelujah that Pastor got something he got an answer to his problem because he pulled on the word hallelujah you got to support the word hallelujah but man say saying amen is sick at devil sick of devil right get that devil get that devil out of the church amen get that devil out of my life amen I don't want the I don't want this devil here Amen to the word hallelujah that's how you do it you say Amen brother said to put some pep in your step Hallelujah yeah I'm walking out of here with all this energy tonight Hallelujah because I've heard the word of God Amen that's what it's supposed to do praise God glory to God that's right church he said this open door has been he caused it an oasis what there's water around foolish virgins huh I just preached it not long ago Church everybody forget El Rio somebody found a Oasis Glory I even was expecting that Hagar Hagar a type of the Bond woman she found in Oasis oh my Hallelujah but what did a what did Abraham and Isaac have they actually had whales they dug whales and they dug deep enough to the water sprung up they had artisian whales amen they had lifegiving whales but brother ad even said a Hagar we see it from the Bible even that is an oasis even she had an oasis brother Ram says I have an oasis when I come to these non- denominational Gatherings he said where he said he he'll say it later where there's Methodist there's Presbyterian there's Baptist he said it's a little Oasis for me he says I believe now listen this is in 1965 three weeks before he died I believe in in the people in denominations what what what brother but I don't have much time to exhort denominations because each one builds a fence around himself so brother Brandon what' he do he didn't look at the fence he looked at the people behind the fence amen hallelujah that's right that's how we have to see it they're fenced in have compassion try to have Fellowship try to show some love that's how brother brandom saw these denominational Gatherings brother Jesse what are you doing preaching denomination I'm trying to get the brother M says the Ducks over the fence I'm trying to get them the D I'll read the story so you know what I'm talking about he said just like Brother David was telling me a little saying about he was Raising some ducks and he said the river come up and each duck you know they wanted fellowship with one another and they couldn't do it because they was all fenced up but when the water got so high just floated the Ducks out of the pen so I think that's the way to do it is just the waters coming up see and we can get out of the pen and fellowship with one another you know have the Real Love Of Christ in our hearts and the church said Hallelujah that's what we need brother Mercy some flood in here some floods of the Waters of the Holy Ghost amen they give us some love for people that some ducks that are stuck in their fences God give us a spirit spiritual flood Hallelujah where it moves people out of their denominations right or offence walls uh brother Ram said even in a church you can have uh divisions in a church where some people won't fellowship with some other people even in our church or other churches right there's my it's almost 8 o00 okay there's my little warning B uh what's it called brother calls them clicks you can have Clicks in churches right where some people won't talk to other people things like that what we needed some water Hallelujah that's what we need amen he says the real love of Jesus Christ hallelujah oh I love it amen I'm almost done and this Full Gospel businessman has been an oasis for me because I have I have Fine Brothers I guess in every denomination I've ever met he didn't say find demons he said find brothers and look here's the list Presbyterians Lutheran christen's grandmother the pastor way we had good Fellowship didn't we hun I called her I called her Grandpa this week we talked we had good Fellowship about the Lord hallelujah he still he still says this but we were so richly blessed that's his that's his uh three favorite words so richly blessed would you say Amen to that brother Hallelujah Baptist Pentecostals all different types of the Pentecostals right because you got different versions different flavors of Pentecost Church of God Nazarene Pilgrim Holiness fine Brethren everywhere but many times they cannot have me in their Community because not that they don't believe it but see it would cut them off from their denomination when you do that course then that does it Hallelujah ever had that moment where you you you maybe you somebody sees you do something they don't like well that does it no more fellowship with you now there are certain things we need to disfellowship over I preached remember we preached on doctrines of devils two years ago there are certain things you cannot Fellowship on right people even people in ual sin don't even eat with them there's certain things uh the Bible said if someone tries to come into your house remember in uh first or second John and doesn't preach the true Doctrine he said don't even let him in your house and don't B him God speed don't say God bless you Hallelujah there's certain things that we need the wisdom of God on but I'm just talking about just people that love the Lord maybe they're ignorant they don't understand the message think about what you were like when you were in denominations Hallelujah I reach out to a brother this week uh I don't know if you saw that video I made about Kenneth Hagen um anyways it was a couple months ago but I reached out to a brother he was in his he foued his ministry for 20 years and I said brother can you tell me did they have women preachers in there did they just speak in uncontrollable tongues all the time without interpretations did they have laughing fits have you ever seen those laughing fits everybody's rolling on there I mean they're just going crazy laughing I said do they preached the uh pres uh Prosperity Gospel sorry I mean I listen to all these things and I was you I was I was really kind of zealous you know I wanted to show how Kenneth Hagen was just a false teacher and he was church but he responded back and he said brother God was so gracious to me I did all those things that I didn't know better and the reason I did it because I I never heard brother brother man's message he said so I have a lot of compassion on them and he said and yes they did all that but a lot of them don't know better I tell you I got real humbled after that I lost all my Zeal my my my balloon deflated all my all my effort you know I was gon to make another video on Kenneth Hagen all I was like oh that's a good way remember where you come from brother Jesse Hallelujah you were just a sitting in a Pentecostal Church too you were sitting over there in the chapel and God had mercy on you amen hallelujah God didn't judge you and throw you in with a bunch of the devil God didn't judge you like that he had mercy he had longsuffering and he had a perfect time to call you out of Darkness Into The Marvelous Light hallelujah hallelujah remember where you come from so Malai remember where you come from in the message Church Hallelujah you come from a good place Hallelujah like I told he's like William you know maai and the young I told these children a long time ago I said if you guys ever want to go out to these groups I'll go with you I I'll go show you what it's like I'll go sit with you on the SAT they have Saturday night meetings I'll go sit with there you better take some earplugs though some of those churches are loud tell brother he brother amen and I and I can say Amen to that I think I I think our ears were ringing when we come out of that service there like can you turn down the volume a little bit I can't even think about God because I got a headache but they like it loud he said find Brethren everywhere he said but a Methodist brother I won't call his name a fine man he come up and wrote me letter he said he's writing a letter on Divine Healing and he come up to me and talked about I said the only thing we got against you brother Braham you're hanging around them Pentecostals all the time I said well then let the Methodist Church sponsor it I'll come oh you don't want me to hang around with him that's fine well open your doors preacher I can only go in the doors that God opens for me and the church said he said oh that was different he said yeah well of course um uh he said I'm not the Methodist Church I just belong with them I said see that's it see they're the ones the Pentecostals is the ones that open their doors see that's the reason I can get to as many as them that will open why we're ready to come in any door got open now C corers listen you got to pray before you go in the door you better pray before you go in there we see how brother R approaches no doubt there was devils in those churches no doubt there was immoral women and uh uh you know Leo Deans to see lazy boys and all these things he said but there's if there's a door open and God sends me in there there's got to be some seed in there as well Hallelujah you you'd be surprised how many message churches today are there because their original fign founding Pastor was in brother bram's meetings or just got a tape or just had the voice of healing magazine and something drew them to brother Brandon something drew them to his meetings and forever changed not even trying Hallelujah not even trying really to to to seek after that but just led by the Holy Spirit you're magnetized you're just drawn because it's God drawing you to the truth hallelujah you can't get away from it because it's God you'd be surprised Church how many people just were drawn to this message that's what I was I was just drawn to it Hallelujah as many as opened the door were ready to come in he said just like Revelation I love how brother always takes it back to the Bible he said the third chapter I stand at the door and knock If any man will open the door I'll come in and sub that was Jesus and all of us knows that was Christ and he is the word that's right he is the word I'm almost done I got three minutes left clock is ticking and so he says it again for for a second time and so the Full Gospel businessman has been an oasis for me I hope tonight has been an oasis for somebody you've had a rough Monday Tuesday maybe Wednesday is rough but you come to God's house and you feel refreshed in the house of the Lord singing saying Amen to the word sick in the devil Hallelujah putting the devil up in a tree right like that putting a in the tree treeing him trapping him Hallelujah he says it's a Oasis where we can all come together together no churches is sponsoring it they all together the men out of the churches we come together in Fellowship cross the world around everywhere now look what he says and I've helped establish many many many chapters and I'm quoting quote by quote I'm not adding any many's there I've helped establish many many many chapters throughout the entire world of the Full Gospel businessmen brother said that organizations brother Braham started many many many non- denominational organizations Hallelujah was he against organization yes if it was of the devil but was he for it if it was non- denominational yes that's why brother BR would be for our church right because we're not a denomination Hallelujah that's right that's why anything you do for god brother R even complimented uh uh what's that one uh where you support the or orphans orphanages yeah brother B even comped a man who would uh who would start orphanages and said what a great work he was doing he started an organization and get he get chartered in and or organized with the government to be recognized as a 503 and taxfree brother said what a great work the brothers doing I'll try I'll try to find the quote maybe bring it Sunday see anybody that was trying to do something to win souls brother brandham was for it but he was trying to get them out of denominations right and try to get them into the TRU truth of God's word amen hallelujah this is again three weeks well I actually count the days uh he died on uh this is 20 days before he died because he died uh Christmas Eve 1965 this was December 4th 20 days before he died three weeks he's still talking about just just get people saved just get them saved he says and I'm thankful for that opportunity that was given me you're the prophet of God what other jobs do you have well one of them is start many many Full Gospel fellowships start many many fellowships where there's no Creed but Christ no book but the Bible Hallelujah what's the other one no no no law of love thank you sir forgot one thing I forget many things no law but love Hallelujah I'm thankful right before the Lord takes me off the scene I was was able to start many non- denominational fellowships h a lot different than what we hear today from message people right I'm thankful in there the businessmen will sponsor it so see they've got the money they got businesses all the churches they want to come anyhow so see he knows there's all these denominational people their denominations won't invite the message in so you got to start something to invite the denominations in you that's what brother R had a strategy and because of that because of his name because of his reputation because of the people saw the gift in his life he could start many many chapters where people could come in and hear the word of God hallelujah and brother B said in these he didn't preach the Deep things of God remember he shared that for or I'm sorry he saved that for his home Church remember that he even made a promise he said as I travel so much I won't preach any major Doctrine unless I first preach it at BR t but then when Perry green raised up the church he said now this is my church he said now I don't have to go across the country now why isn't Joseph saying Amen to that one right that's right he said I don't have to go back to Jeffersonville because this is my church now as it was going to be his home church he said it's his home Church there in twon Tabernacle in Arizona that was uh more a little that was in November of 65 Hallelujah so see wherever his home Church would be and the the Pastor believed in the message of the hour he could preach anything from there he could teach the Deep things of God church people don't have to receive serpent seed to be saved how many remember the quote brother Bram said that's the killer you want to kill some friendship should show them serpent seed well I've had trouble with that person anyway let me just show them serpent seed then they'll leave for sure right no I'm just kidding but that's the killer brother Braham said see it doesn't pertain to Salvation he said it just shows more light on the truth that we're all trying to see hallelujah we're all trying to see the truth of God I love I love how brother says it oh my last quote I'm past 8 o'clock I said I'd stop around 8 that's Co he says this he says but then I don't want to never try to pull somebody from their church I've never tried to pull anybody this church you they want to go somewhere else let them go I want God to pull people here Hallelujah because it's God that pulled me here I didn't I didn't come to akaran looking to be a pastor I came here to try to go to the NFL and build my mama house well that surely failed but at least I tried at least I gave my best shot I can at least say I tried I gave my best shot Hallelujah he says don't I never want to try to pull somebody from their church just stay right in your church he tells him stay in those fences look what he's saying he's saying stay in those fences and Scatter out the light see be a real Christian your pastor will appreciate you I do I do appreciate real Christians Hallelujah that's why I'm going to do congregation Appreciation Day on Sunday and get your pizza I am okay I am if I forget forgive me I'll ride for church I'll drive and get pizza and bring it here okay I promise you by God's gra unless I'm sick or dying or something like that hopefully I'm still alive by God's gra he said your pastor will appreciate you a real loyal genuine Saint any man that believes
