praise god just a reminder next week we have brother cam will be here with his family uh just two services on sunday my brother cam's working still a lot so i don't want to i don't want to drain his health too much remember this is the rescheduling from that weekend where we where my family was sick uh and his family was sick and so we're happy to uh very happy he can come again and everybody's well by god's grace and we found out that julia is expecting number five so i don't know if everybody knew that we just found out yesterday so uh they're they're very happy uh so i think she's 15 weeks along if i'm not mistaken so god bless brother cam and sister julia looking forward to see them next weekend uh by the grace of the lord romans 11 25 romans 11 25 would like to continue on these uh mysteries here and we know the mysteries of the children's bread how many believe that by god's grace we're such a privileged people that god serves us the bread of god the bread on his own table and it goes to the children we don't get the crumbs that fall right that was the old testament now we are seated we have a place at the lord's table and the bread is the mysteries of god we were told from the scripture what a blessing romans 11 25 let's read that together uh on three one two three for i would not brethren that ye should be ignorant of this mystery lest ye should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part is happened to israel until the fullness of the gentiles be coming let's have a word of prayer if you have a need on your heart just make it known unto god if it's unspoken heavenly father god we love you we bless you father such a privilege to be in your house oh we're looking forward to that one day to fly away until then lord we're making ready today we're watching praying by the holy spirit lord just continually cleanse our lives with your holy spirit god we want to be right we want to be true we want to be faithful lord god we want to be one of those few at the meeting in the air lord god so we're living like it and father we're pressing into the things of god as lord the scripture said we must take the kingdom of god and the violent take it by force the violent take it by possession and claiming the word of god and so father we're claiming the word of god this morning we pray you bless each and every heart this morning especially our visitor sister mary lord speak to every single heart and soul we pray in jesus christ's name the saint said amen praise god god bless you as being seated there malachi can you do me a favor where is he leave okay lydia can do me a favor i left my ipad in there it's got my notes on it uh i forgot to get it out it's in my gray bag if you could just unzip it there so i'd like to start here with a few scriptures let's remind ourselves about uh the importance of the mysteries of god how many know they're really important praise god let's start in revelation 10. we'll go there and just good uh reminder for the children and for uh for us adults as well the importance of the mysteries of god revelation 10 7 when the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets so god likens all the mysteries as just one one container or one one mystery uh but it's that we know it's a 12-fold revelation he said it's one mystery and it should be completed praise god and so we know and we know according to scripture then it has to be eaten and then it has to be taken around the world because in verse 8 the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i went up under the angel and said unto him give me the little book oh i'm sorry thank you my bag's back there thank you and he said to me take it up and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i just want to stop on there there's a little thought i had on that i looked up the word bitter you ever think about that how do the mysteries how are they sweet in your mouth but they're bitter in your tongue in your stomach right thank you well we know speaking the mysteries is uh is a is a beautiful thing right being able to share about the mysteries and talk about the mysteries you know we think about how uh we can talk about uh god is one person right and it just it's so wonderful to talk about right and so it's so great to talk about the raptures of revelation right shout voice trump and it is so great to talk about but some of these mysteries uh the bible says when you eat them the bible says that's bitter in your belly and i looked at the word bitter it means grieved and that should remind us of grieve not the holy spirit right whereby you're sealed to the day of your redemption but also should remind us of how the word of god if we don't accept it it grieves us right and if others don't accept it if others turn it down it grieves us so it's wonderful to talk about it's wonderful to share it but when it comes down uh and becomes a part of us right and we realize uh the brevity or the seriousness of god's word it can be a bitter thing because we think my people don't receive this if people don't see this they're turning down god right they're turning down what god has done in this hour god has sent his angel praise god uh the holy spirit right he's brought the word to a seventh angel the seventh angel on the earth has the mystery of god it sounds out and it's taken around the world but john says when i eat it i like to talk about it and testify about it but inside it can be a grieving thing i can be grieved by it how many know the bible says we groan waiting to be clothed with that new body praise god amen why do we groan because the mystery of god is within us but we don't always see ourselves living up to it praise god we see ourselves fall short of the glory of god sometimes we grieve the holy spirit how many can say amen to that sometimes we grieve the holy spirit because we know we've done contrary we've broken the commands of god to some degree so they're they're they're lovely to talk about they're so sweet to discuss but bringing them down and making them a part of you and and becoming one with them can be a difficult process right yeah and how many know sometimes you get roots of bitterness right and you got that that's the bitterness right and there's times we got to uproot those roots of bitterness brother branham calls them complexes right like standing in the gap brother bam says if they don't want to hear it they don't have to he said i'll just leave the field i'll just go uh i'll just go live up in the mountains right but he said he had to overcome that the holy spirit had to correct him from getting a hard heart from getting bitter right because we it's wonderful to talk about but when we see others rejecting it it makes us bitter right it makes it hard it's hard to be rejected but all who live godly in christ jesus will suffer persecution amen there'll be a small group a small number of believers all those who really accept it it'll be bitter in their in their beings because sometimes they transgress it but other times uh you know they're groaning for victory they're groaning for a different body and then they're also grieved by those who don't receive it how many remember paul says in romans 11 let me know paul says i wish i was cursed for my brethren that they could see the gospel how many remember that he was so burdened that he would take upon a curse on him to see others would be saved how many grown for your your lost loved ones to be saved and you can relate to that to some degree my i wish i just do anything i would do anything to see my loved ones accept this message praise god and that's the reality of the love of god that paul had in his heart he wanted to see the uh the blinded ones receive the gospel praise god now let's look at another one go to uh deuteronomy 29 29. i wrote down numerous ones here i think it'll be a help to all of us here let's just review the value of mysteries we know uh that god can't finish the great commission until the mysteries have been taken around the world as revelation 10 shared and actually i didn't even read that part but go ahead and read go ahead and go to deuteronomy 29 11 and i'll read revelation 10 11. and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings so this is a the open book goes to the gentile people every nation every people gets to hear the message before jesus returns praise god amen i'm glad to hear it by god's grace now deuteronomy 29 29 why are these mysteries so great why would i spend time preaching on them and writing upon them writing on them and meditating upon them because the bible says the secret things belong unto the lord our god but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever that we may do all the words of this law see remember god chose israel of all the nations god chose one and he said i'm going to share my law i'm going to share my covenant with you and because you have the covenant you're blessed praise god amen you receive my secret you receive didn't moses receive the secrets from heaven praise god he saw he saw the altar of incest as he said on wednesday right he saw the holiest of holies he saw all these heavenly things and he saw the revelation and he and he created it down here on earth through the the wisdom and skill of the builders the carpenters praise god so these things were revealed from heaven that god's people might receive it that god's people might enjoy the secrets of god amen hallelujah praise god thank the lord that we can know his secrets amen go to uh psalm here uh psalms 25 please psalm 25 verse 14. psalm 25 14. i'm trusting that we will be thankful this morning for the mysteries of god psalms 25 14 and we'll appreciate them for what the bible says they are psalms 25 14 the secret of the lord is with them that fear him and he will show them his covenant amen praise god amen who gets the covenant who gets the promise who gets the oath it's them that fear god that receive the covenant that keep his commands those are the ones who get the revelation of the mysteries amen those that really fear god and know there's a creator right and worship the creator and honor the creator they build their lives upon the creator's word hallelujah thank the lord see that church you have the secret of god with you and so much and not just with you like a like a message book of brother branham or a bible but actually in your soul praise god hallelujah the mystery of god is in you praise god the secret of god is in your soul praise god amen thank the lord uh go to uh proverbs now proverbs 3 32 saints proverbs 3 32. just a reminder about the importance remember any every other nation outside of israel didn't have the secrets of god they could guess they could try to worship they knew they were supposed to worship the bible says but they couldn't have the secrets of god because they didn't fear god they didn't love god but only those who feared god and kept his commands those are the ones who got his secrets and brother madam said it's like a man who's engaged to his wife and he whispers all the secrets and tells her all of her his secrets and his future plans hallelujah thank the lord proverbs 3 32 for the fro word is abomination to the lord that's a perverse that means perverseness but his secret is with the righteous praise god so those who live a perverted life and and they they take chances with god and just guess and try to guess it god's will their abomination to god but god reveals his secrets to those who do what's right who are men and women of integrity praise god men and women of honesty men and women who have the character of jesus christ amen thank the lord now to top it all off now there's many more i could do but to top it off let's go to ephesians 3. and this kind of deals with the quote brother branham says about the husband whispering love secrets to his engaged wife or bride ephesians three let's read eight and nine actually let's do ephesians 3 4 ephesians 3 let's start in verse 4. whereby when we read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit that the gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel amen church every promise you have need of whether it's healing right whether it's salvation whether it's more wisdom praise god whatever promise we have need of we have it through the gospel of jesus christ amen whatever you need of we are fellow heirs we inherit that it's part of our inheritance because we're children of god amen we and god uh god is his testament has been confirmed with the blood of jesus christ right the bible says the testament is confirmed after the death of the testator and jesus die he's the one that made the testament he died so his will is in effect his inheritance is in effect whatever we have need of it's available for us right now amen let's not make it just a future let's make it right now we can possess our inheritance thank the lord verse 7 wherefore i was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of god given unto me by the effectual working of his power so god's power is so great it made paul a minister of this grace before he was a minister of law but it made him fall in love with grace god's grace made him fall in love with grace verse 8 unto me who am less than the least of all saints remember church look remember he said in other places remember he said i labored more than all the apostles but here he says i'm less than the least is his grace given that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ so i guess there's times as a christian you can recognize the amount of labor you give to god but when it when it boils down to it and you look at god's grace for your life you'll always place yourself as lower than the least praise god amen that's why i know i'm the lowest of all the preachers right that's why i believe that amen because paul says i'm least i'm less than the least amen i'm lower than the low amen but yet he was saved by grace he was trusting in grace he was preaching by grace amen and so we do the same today we preach by grace we live by grace we consider ourselves the lowest of the low but we're still in that body we're still christians we're still filled with the holy ghost we still inherit every promise of our father i thank the lord for that praise god hallelujah and this is what i'm trying to get to right here oh it's unsearchable too you just you can never get to the bottom of it praise god year after year decade after decade you just can't you can't get all the way to the bottom of all the riches of jesus christ hallelujah now here it is that verse 9. this is the whole point of where i was going so this is the whole point of this quick review here and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in god who created all things by jesus christ so what is the what's the point of the mystery it's the fellowship that's in christ and what's fellowship intimacy so you got to go back to the picture of husband and wife this is a marriage so the blessing of the the revelation of the mysteries is it shows you have intimacy with your husband with jesus christ with god almighty god only reveals those mysteries to a an intimate person his wife the lord praise god hallelujah praise god thank you jesus amen this is the point of the mysteries to give us intimacy with jesus why do you respect god so much and your friends don't because you've got intimacy with christ how can they go to church but then when they leave they talk about all kinds of evil things they don't have intimacy like jesus said he never knew them right but you know him praise god amen all right amen like my man said if someone mistreat your husband or someone mistreat your wife you want to stand up for him you want to pray you pray for that person that mistreated him why because you know your husband you know your wife you know them there's intimacy there there's fellowship there and that's the evidence uh the evidence of having fellowship with christ is he reveals his secrets to you he reveals his will to you and you know what god likes and so you live the way to please god almighty all right that's a quick review by god's grace oh thank god jesus will say i knew you praise god i knew you were my child i knew you you knew me we knew each other we had intimacy we had fellowship we had a close relation while you were on earth so i came to rescue you off the earth in the rapture hallelujah thank the lord now let's just review real quick there's six reasons with israel now that god can save israel despite her being spiritually blinded okay so the first one is jesus's prayer for forgiveness he prayed father forgive them they don't know what they do i remember wednesday that struck me how jesus said i know that thou hearst me always father so jesus knew whenever he prayed god heard him so if jesus prayed father forgive that blinded group that's crucifying me we know god would have forgave them because jesus prayed for it and the father heard it praise god and jesus don't pray in vain you don't waste his time remember jesus said pray not for the world remember jesus said that right he said i i'm sorry jesus said i pray not for the world that's right i'm sorry jesus did jesus didn't pray for the world because he knew who was saved and who wasn't he said i pray not for the world i pray you keep those that have received my word amen now we are to pray the bible says god's long-suffering that all men might be saved so you and i don't know who's going to be saved so we pray for the lost we pray that god will send for laborers into the harvest we pray that god will send somebody to our families that god will send somebody to the overseas missions right we pray god sends somebody to save the lost because we don't know but jesus prayed only for the believers amen hallelujah so jesus prayed to forgive those who didn't know they were crucifying christ and so they would have been forgiven because they didn't know better right the second reason is paul's teaching in romans 11 he says they're not all he said they're not forsaken for all time god's saving the gentiles while israel is blinded it's a temporary blindness and then he says all israel shall be saved amen hallelujah oh israel all the true faithful diligent is israelis will be saved amen the third is the foreshadowing in the life of joseph joseph was good to the his brothers that were blinded to his identity he didn't starve them out he didn't rebuke them he was good to them praise god and he saved them and gave them a place in dostum praise god he didn't turn them down the very ones who sold him out he was good to them and he said don't hold it against you i don't hold it against you god sent me here praise god in other words when you were blinded and you threw me in the pit and you saw me when you were blinded god was behind it praise god amen god was behind it and god will be merciful praise god to those blinded jews that's the third reason the fourth is the fifth seal brother ram said thus saith the lord about the fist seal he said that the souls under the altar were the blinded jews right and they said how long lord they're crying out for revenge you know we know many of them six million of them were killed in the holocaust right but they say how long lord he said i'll avenge your blood he said but i'm going to give you a white robe as well praise god and they didn't have the testimony of jesus christ they just had the testimony of the word amen that's what we looked at on wednesday if you didn't hear that we looked at the heavenly altar of incense their souls under the altar right and then their souls above the altar right that's us the believers above the altar and nearly near the throne of god right the holies of holies but there's jewish souls under the altar crying how long so we know heaven has an altar of incense in other words heaven is hearing our prayers amen there's prayers at the that are going up before god almighty the high priest says we're hearing our prayers he's answering our prayers i'm glad he hears our prayers amen hallelujah so that's thus saith the lord so nobody can get beyond that and say well well i don't think god can save blinded people well he's blind he's blind to the jews and saves them praise god he promises them white robes all right now the sixth and final reason here is the one we'll look at today again uh by the grace of the lord okay so the sixth reason is god i'm sorry it's the fifth reason i'm sorry yeah we're on the fifth reason i'm sorry yeah fifth reason i jumped out of myself this is the fifth reason maybe we'll look at the fifth and sixth today if we have time the fifth reason is god judges every person based upon what they know so if they're blinded god takes into consideration they're blinded to this so i'll judge them by what they know that's scriptural so let's look at those scriptures here uh we'll go through them uh quickly by god's grace so see the fiscal jews are saved because god uh god help them have an overcoming testimony even believing uh the covenant of moses because they were blinded to the new testament so because they believed the old one god still saved them okay so let's but just briefly let's look at revelation 12 11. can you pull it up there revelation 12 11. now church this is the picture though of the 144 thousand but i just want to see i want you to see how they overcome okay we know this is this has to be the 144 000 because brother madam says revelation 12 doesn't deal with the gentiles he said it's all jew okay so verse 11 and they the 144 000 overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto death now church think about this if the blind if the holocaust jews are saved they didn't overcome by the blood of jesus did they and church let me let me remind you this they didn't even overcome by the blood of a natural lamb because they don't have a nat they're not killing animals right now that's why they go to the western wall and they got those hats on i don't even know what they're gone but they go there and they have their prayers and they push their prayers in between the rocks and they pray because they know they can't sacrifice until the temple set up they know that so that means all those six million holocaust jews and all the blinded jews before that as they overcame not by the blood of the lamb because they didn't have a lamb nor the blood of jesus but they overcome by the word of their testimony praise god their testimony was we believe moses amen we believe god's going to send a messiah praise god and they overcame just by their testimony to the word of god and god said i'll still honor that even though the lamb of god was in heaven god says i know you're blind of that he said but i'll still help you to overcome by the word that's the power of the word amen think about that the power of you and i speaking god's word i'll not be afraid i'm not going to be sick praise god i'm not going to be tempted by that in the name of jesus just speaking the word of god that's overcoming power amen hallelujah it's overcoming power because the blind and jews don't even have blood to intercede for them all they've got is word promises and god still saves god's still saved based upon the old covenant and their testimony on overcoming the devil church that's powerful to me just like we've heard it before you want to get upset if a blind man's up here and he he steps on your toes right you want to get up if a blind man hit you with this cane because he didn't know what he was doing and god is the same gracious way with the jews they don't know what they're doing but he still saves them by amazing grace and as long as they receive faith in their heart and they overcome by that faith that's planted in their heart god said i'll save you and i'll give you a white robe i'll give you a theophany body praise god i know an eternal house in the heavens amen god gives them eternal house just because they kept the written word without the blood because they kept the word and they they spoke the word they overcame by the word they overcame by moses said just like we're saying brother branham said right joel said we're saying jesus said paul said peter said we're overcoming by the word so are they overcoming by the word but we've got blood to forgive all of our sins so we can have his righteousness right now praise god and we don't cry out for revenge upon our enemies we cry out for blessings upon our enemies we bless them and not curse them because we've got christ's righteousness right now amen glory that's beautiful ah thank you jesus and so are saved by grace through faith right ephesians 2 5 or 2 8 you are saved by grace through faith their faith in moses their faith in joshua their faith in that word saves them that old covenant praise god because god saves you by your personal choice he does not force anyone to accept grace or faith i know a lot of people say i'm predestinated to it so i have to do it that's not true if you're if you're i'm going to preach on that again tonight i was listening to soul thirst again uh thirst my brother branham brother graham lays it out plainly god cannot force someone to go to heaven because he said judas will rise up on that day and say well you didn't pick me to go to heaven and god would be guilty of having favorites but man teaches that plainly so it's not it's not god forcing us it's god uh predestinating and by foreign he knows we will receive it he knows we will want it then he predestinates the events of our lives that we can uh hear him and hear his word and be near to the word and love him and receive him and serve him all the days of our life that's right so each person brother man said free more agency is in the soul so each person's free more agency either accepts faith or rejects faith they're either saved or lost now in the case of the blind of jews church all they could do is understand the old testament and god will judge them accordingly if they accept faith in the covenant they'll be saved just like noah was just like abraham just like moses joshua zachariah right john the baptist they'll all be saved by their faith in the written word of god is everybody with me today okay now here's what i want to say too so that's just the jews now now if we go to all humanity so we are just focusing on israel now let's go to the rest of the world the bible says god judges all those uh and uh and they're all without excuse that's romans one we read it we've read it numerous times we're not going to read all that but let's go uh let's go to a scripture here i'd like to go to first timothy 4 14. let's look at this sin of neglect this is why people will be lost because they neglected to respond to god's word and god will judge each person based upon the inherent knowledge of god already in their soul already in their human spirit so let's go to first timothy 4 14. this is why people will be lost because they neglect they ignore the gift of god that he's placed in their life okay so this is with the preacher neglect not the gift that is in thee which was given thee by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery so leave that up there so if a preacher doesn't invest in his gifts he can be guilty of neglecting the the gift of god now let's tie this in with the parable of the talents what did that one talent preacher do he went and buried his gift in the ground and what jesus said thou wicked and slothful servant right he said take him into outer darkness where there's weeping and gnashing of teeth church we must not neglect the gift of god that's in us amen our sisters our brothers our children our adults we must not neglect the gift of god we must respect it we must focus on it and we must use it for the kingdom of god in other words each day say god use me lord whenever if you can use me to pray for the sick if he didn't use me to win souls amen if you can give me a word of knowledge for somebody if you can give me a gift of faith if you can give me the the gift of miracles lord if you can use me for anything god use me let me be set aside so you can use me but there's a great sin it's a great sin to neglect the gift of god in our lives all right next one hebrews 2 3. can you pull that up hebrews 2 3 so see all humanity will be judged by what they knew about god and how they reacted to it they'll also be judged by what they didn't know if they failed to seek god for it i know that's a that's a mouthful right there they'll be judged by what they didn't know if they failed to seek god for it we'll get to that in just a moment but look at this how shall we and paul's not writing to heathens here paul's writing to we us how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation oh may god may god anoint us to believe for deliverance for the lost right may god anoint us to believe that all things are possible there's miracles in the making amen this is a great salvation god did a great thing when he saved me and god can do it in other people which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard them see what what great what great sin is on those who neglect the gospel of jesus christ us amongst believers right now go to luke 12 47. let's go there luke 12 47. now this is quite a scripture here jesus said they're go there be people who get punished because they didn't know god's will now how can god punish somebody who doesn't know his will and that sermon which knew not his lord's will and prepared not himself neither did according to his will shall be beaten with many stripes right how is it possible that someone who doesn't know the will of god gets beaten with many it's because they had the opportunity to know but never ask god to know his progressive will in other words they knew there was the knowledge out there but they didn't seek god for it oh aren't you glad you can seek god today to know more of his will aren't you glad you didn't stay at home or aren't you glad you didn't go and neglect the word of god aren't you glad you're seeking god to know more of his will that you might do more of his will praise god so see that's it just lines up with everything taught in the scripture see he's not going to punish i'm sorry he's going to punish those who didn't know his will because they cared so little they heard the invitation to the wedding supper right they heard the invitation of the supper they knew about the white robes being given out right they knew about the wedding garments being given out but they failed to look into it they failed to seek god they failed to consecrate and spend time with jesus christ that's right remember this is upon every continent church and every nation uh pull up luke 11 10. luke 11 10. all right for everyone that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be open see so jesus guarantees anybody who knocks anybody who seeks anybody that asked he said you will receive amen that's what brother said the first thing with patience is not having patience with others it's having patience with god that if you have prayed if you've asked god you'll be patient for the time he wants to answer your request glory go to romans 2 romans 2 verse 14. so this is the fifth reason the fifth reason is god he'll give righteous judgment based upon the knowledge that's already in the person right they know there's a god they they know there's right and wrong and they've got to make the free moral agency choice to act upon that and seek after god i like how those children are writing down notes there i like that praise god they're seeking god hopefully they go home and study those and look those over sometimes i took a picture of mine last sunday when brother uh big bride was here and i emailed it as myself so i didn't lose it and i was studying that looking okay that's right i gotta get that that thought that there you gotta you gotta review them we're just not gonna write them down and be scribed we gotta we gotta we gotta eat the book praise god we gotta eat them later on amen romans 2 14 for the gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law these having not the law are a law unto themselves so leave that up there so any aborigine who doesn't know jesus christ the bible said they still have god's law in them right now preaches over the years here but i want to go over it again verse 15 which show the work of the law written in their hearts see god has already written the word in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing or else excusing one another okay so god sees the leaders in all in any nation they know they know there's the right and wrong and god sees if they uh if they accept it or reject it or if they let this person slide or they do justice here god is gonna hold everybody accountable for their actions amen let me say like this god is gonna hold our church accountable for our actions so we want to do what's right praise god and if we see our brother doing wrong we're to go to them with what the spirit of meekness right and correct them because we're all going to be held accountable praise god now in chapter one i'm sorry wait let's read 16. sorry this is one of the most beautiful scriptures in the day when god shall judge the secrets of men all men all their secrets will be judged by jesus christ according to this word amen this message that's what you understand this revelation this message will judge everyone on the day of judgment praise god the godhead right the rapture the blindness of the jews right the one church composed of jew and gentile praise god all these mysteries all this word it will judge them all because they all had knowledge of god and they all could have heard it and got more of it if they just would have asked for it amen see god can save a jew who's faithful then even though they're blinded to they're blind to the new testament god will save the old one because they they they were obedient to the law of god that was in their heart that's why peter said god saves all men and any nation who fears god amen praise god that's acts chapter 10. peter said god is respects any man who fears the lord in any nation praise god hallelujah so it's jesus's unfailing promise romans 1 i just want to read it this one quickly romans 1 and this one i don't have yeah verse 19 and 20. i just want to nail this down here by god's grace so god's god's law is manifest in every person's being and the witness of creation is a witness against the person if they won't accept god verse 19 because that which may be known of god is manifest in them for god has shown it unto them you see so god is manifest inside every person's being and god showed them his power so you see the power of god when you wake up in the morning you see the power of god when you work with your hands right maokai and i cut some boards the other day we're not really big carpenters but we can see the power of god you know just giving us the ability to cut a boar with a scroll saw the power of god right the power it's just it's in us we got control and we can we can cut things and sand them down and nail things together you know the power of god the ability the understanding of god we see it in our bodies verse 20 for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even as a eternal power in godhead so that they are without excuse no excuses on the day of judgment because god showed his word it was in you and he showed you his word in all of nature oh my thank god that's why i'm glad i see god in the sunrise in the sunset and when we see the sun rise we can look out the window and say praise the lord his mercies to me are new this morning praise god because i see the sun because i see the sun rise and the warmth of it that tells me his mercies he's giving me a fresh start today he's going to be a fresh wine he's going to give me new line today praise god that's right hallelujah because it's understood by the creation of the world new heat a new season amen all these new things in nature they're pointing us to the reality of christ in our lives glory and each soul is without excuse so see blinded jews will be fairly judged by the law of moses they heard not by jesus's teaching because they were blinded to it they'll be judged by the law of moses because they were ignorant of the new testament and then each one will get a fair trial from the righteous one jesus christ hallelujah they'll be judged by their knowledge that god placed inside of them and did they choose to neglect that or did they choose to accept that praise god all right now the sixth reason i'm gonna finish up here give me a moment here give me ten more minutes let me try to finish up here by god's grace now the sixth reason the last reason so six is the number of anointed man right adam was anointed on the sixth day he was anointed with no sin he had a holy veil of power on him praise he could speak to trees right he could speak to everything number six is the number of anointed man but also a fallen man number of man bill braham said that he said when he spoke his sixth squirrel in existence he said look that's the number of man six anointed but god gave him one more seven completion but on the sixth one he said look it's the number of anointed men that wasn't spoken word i think his original seed now the sixth and final reason is god's covenant with israel through abraham i've been mentioning this over and over but let's just look at it by god's grace now genesis 12 1-9 we don't have time to read it all uh we're not going to read it all but you you're familiar this is where god calls abram and he says to separate yourself from your family and i'm taking you to a land you don't know and he says the blessings will be on every nation well let's just go ahead and turn there genesis 12. this is god's covenant to abraham genesis 12 verse one verse 1 genesis 12 1 now the lord had said unto abram get me out of that country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that i will show thee and i'll make of thee a great nation i'll bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and i will bless them that bless thee and curse them that curse thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed amen hallelujah every gentile nation was going to be blessed through abraham praise god right through abraham everyone was going to be blessed so it was a worldwide blessing the covenant of abraham was going to impact the entire world but remember this was based upon conditions if the people followed the lord so go to genesis 18 19. it was offered to everybody but every covenant is based upon conditions genesis 18 19. so that's why brother brahm says if you want to possess a promise he said act upon the promise obey the word right do something show god you're obeying the word of god because all conditions have to be met if something's lacking do something obey the word of god show god you're trying to keep the commandments praise god genesis 18 19 for i know him this is god speaking of abraham that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgment that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he hath spoken of him praise god amen see that see abraham's children after him must keep the way of the lord in order for god to bring abraham's blessings upon them you and i must keep the word of the lord if we want to see it upon our children we've got to keep the word lord it's accountable to us it's conditional to us and we must meet god's conditions right and he'll give us the strength to do it praise god amen jesus said come unto me all ye that we're in a heaven laden he said i'll give you rest for your souls but you've got to come if you want rest if you want freedom if you want victory you've got to come to jesus amen you've got to come to him it's conditional you got to come you've got to leave behind and lay aside every weight and sin that be every besetting sin that hinders you and you've got to come to jesus and run the race with grace genesis 18 19 as you saw abraham's children must keep the way of the lord go to deuteronomy 11 26. deuteronomy 11 26 behold i set before you this day a blessing and a curse 27 a blessing if if you obey the commandments of the lord your god which i command you this day and a curse if you will not obey the commandments of the lord your god but turn aside out of the way which i command you this day to go after other gods which ye have not known praise god now go to isaiah 49 13 isaiah 49 13. i'm almost done here now here's here's i'll say like this uh here's the sinful attitude of many people today that say god is forsaking me or god doesn't care that's impossible that's impossible god would never do that god would as long as you have a desire to know god god wants to know you praise god now a thousand years after abraham israel had possessed the promised land but yet they corrupted themselves through idolatry and look what isaiah records israel sang he said sing o heavens and be joyful o earth and break forth and to sing you know mountains for the lord hath comforted his people and will have mercy upon his afflicted now let's just pause right there why should we break forth why should the earth sing because god is going to have mercy on you and i praise god i know and israel now we know this is the israel but which of you how many of you are trusting in god's mercy today you should rejoice then praise god that's what the bible says let all the heavens let all nature rejoice because god is going to be merciful to israel mercy rewrote my life i should have vanished my soul crashed down but mercy rewrote my life see next verse but zion said the lord has forsaken me and the lord hath forgotten me so see god is saying you must trust in mercy but god's people got so sinful and so defeated they'd say god doesn't love me anymore god doesn't care about me god god's not going to keep his promise can i say like that that's the loser's toolbox can i just say it like that and we had in football we had a winner's toolbox and we had a loser so much you can't use the tools that are losers tools right in other words that's a that's a bad confession can i say like that that's a box of rattlesnakes right oh nothing good nothing good will ever happen to me i'll never get well god will never answer his prayers god don't care about me stop confessing the devil's lies and accept the word of god amen hallelujah don't take a a negative confession speak the word be positive trust god's command because god is faithful now the next next verse explains why were they saying such foolish things look at verse 15. can a woman forget her suckling child that she should not have compassion on the son of a womb yay they may forget yet i will not forget thee keep that up there god was saying israel's like a little baby that thinks it's forsaken and is crying and complaining god doesn't care about me god doesn't love me and the whole time god's like you're like a crying little baby right how could god how could god a loving parent how could a loving parent ever forsake a suckling child a little baby child god said i won't forsake you praise god see god is so much higher he's so much greater he's a heavenly eternal parent he cares about his children praise god and when we feel like he doesn't care god just wants to sometimes promise that god just wants you to cry it out so he likes to hear your cries amen he likes to hear that you need him and you love him and he wants fellowship he wants intimacy with you praise god next verse he said i will not forget you behold i have graven thee upon the palms of my hands thy walls are continually before me praise god so jesus mother god says father mother jesus god almighty heavenly father papa god is holding israel and he's got nail scars behind there hallelujah jesus is holding israel said i won't forget you baby right i won't forget you little child because i've already purchased you with the scars in my hands praise god i love you so much i went to the cross and died for you praise god i'll never forsake you i'll never leave you i purchase you with my own blood amen hallelujah i'm faithful hallelujah i'm a caring god my mercy's new you are held in my hands amen i've directed every step of your life and right now i'm holding you in my nail scarred hands i purchase you you're mine i will take care of you let's stand to our feet praise god hallelujah see when we say where's god and oh woe is me and my life is awful god don't care about me god says i do care i'm holding you in my hands child stop saying you're forsaken and look to me and cry out to me and you can nurse praise god and you can feed upon the living word of god you can drink the sincere milk of the word can i say like that but you've got to have the overcoming testimony church you've got to overcome but thank god not just by the testimony you have the blood of christ as well amen to forgive us brother bang we have the blood of christ to forgive us praise god and then we know we're forgiven and we can speak god's word with confidence and have the testimony of a real believer musicians if you'll come play that song there's a fountain filled with blood there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from emmanuel's veins can you see a church all these covenants are based upon conditions and we and i said israel or even us we get discouraged sometimes and feel like where's god and the whole time god's like i've got you i'm holding you right um you're mine i purchased you i've got the proof the proof is in my hands that are holding you praise god that are keeping you from me i care about you i'm gonna have mercy on you i'm with you i'm for you praise god [Music] i love you i cannot forget about you hallelujah jesus doesn't forget about you you might feel that way but just tell devil take those evil rattlesnakes back take your lies back with you to hell the word of god is true how many the word of god is true he cares about me he has not forgot about me [Music] he will have mercy on me let's bow our heads for a moment here by god's grace thank you lord hallelujah thank you jesus hallelujah churches let's take a moment if you've felt forsaken if you felt like god hasn't heard you god doesn't care let's say uh uh let's say a prayer of repentance today can we heavenly father i just say a general prayer for the church lord for those who felt forsaken lord for those who've complained for those who felt like you're far away god i just pray you forgive us all lord jesus we all do it lord at times we all complain we feel like heavens against us where there's a big black cloud or sheep between us and heaven don't feel like our prayers are being heard god forgive us lord when we doubt how faithful you are how could you forget a sword god we're like a baby and you're like a caring loving parent who will feed the child who'll take care of the child who will hold the child in his nail scarred hands proving the very head's touching us holding us the fact we're being held proves the power of the cross the cross the power of the cross is holding me today amen thank you jesus you've washed my sins away the cross has paid the price for my sins wash my sins away and that power of forgiveness is holding me now amen hallelujah you cannot forget about me and my needs you don't forget about me you don't forget about us because we're your children forgive us lord for feeling that way forgive us lord for taking the wrong thoughts and letting those birds roost up in our minds we just cast them aside we knock them away in jesus christ's name hallelujah by the grace of god help us to confess the word confess the truth today lord god and may your comfort hallelujah may your love may your peace come upon each and every soul here today to know that they're held in your hands lord i believe we can go as far as saying we're more than a child we're a grown mature woman we're
