[4:21] merciful
[4:21] God is faithful okay I have one
[4:27] testimony I want to share a brother from
[4:30] Illinois sent me sent us a prayer
[4:32] request last week he said I've been
[4:34] having bathroom problems for some time
[4:37] noticing blood when he used the restroom
[4:40] he's the doctor wanted me to get a
[4:41] colonoscopy
[4:42] be so I did today I was very worried
[4:45] because of cancer and polyps
[4:47] it's interesting how Satan can try to
[4:49] steal our faith and talk negative to us
[4:52] he was working me over pretty good he
[4:55] said but you and your family prayed for
[4:57] me and a couple others and Jesus had
[4:59] time and his busy schedule and reached
[5:01] down from heaven and touched me I have a
[5:03] total clean bill of health thank you for
[5:06] all the prayers what would we do without
[5:08] him and each other he said god bless you
[5:11] also praise the Lord thank the Lord for
[5:14] that and I remember praying for that
[5:17] brother by the grace of Lord so we're
[5:19] very thankful I just thought I encourage
[5:21] you with that clean bill of health
[5:23] praise the Lord so thank God for His
[5:26] mercy and his love also as one announced
[5:32] to will have no Friday service in the
[5:35] years past we've done Good Friday
[5:37] services but I think with my wife being
[5:39] sick and then me being sick I'm just
[5:41] kind of worn out so I just want to take
[5:42] this year off for Good Friday service
[5:44] but I had the day off so I'll just be
[5:46] you know studying and praying probably
[5:47] here but if you ever need any prayer
[5:50] requests Friday let me know by God's
[5:52] grace will you happy to pray for you by
[5:55] the grace of Lord and then just one
[5:56] Sunday service on Sunday of course if
[5:59] you want to fellowship afterwards you
[6:00] can I know a lot of people go see their
[6:02] family so but my family's available we
[6:04] don't have any family around here so
[6:05] when I fellowship with my family we'd be
[6:07] happy to do that probably a giant eagle
[6:09] or somewhere like that we could even eat
[6:11] here too but right now no specific plans
[6:15] of anything also just remember we're
[6:20] brother Troy sueda coming April 14 to 15
[6:23] it's a Saturday night at 5 o'clock we'll
[6:24] do a Saturday night at 5 o'clock on
[6:26] April 14th and then April 15th one
[6:29] service with brother Troy then he's
[6:30] going to fly out immediately after the
[6:33] first service whether Joe Adams will be
[6:35] here May 27th to services on Sunday May

[6:47] time with brother Brooks I hope that was
[6:48] a blessing I was really blessed and
[6:50] encouraged and really strengthened I
[6:53] really enjoyed it as the service both
[6:54] services I think I felt the second sir
[6:56] really spoke to me the most I was really
[6:58] happy that as a day went on I felt more
[7:00] like the Lord was speaking to me praise
[7:02] the Lord so very thankful for that and

[37:28] Spirit would still emphasize the Old
[37:30] Testament how many believe that amen
[37:32] it's a lot of wisdom the Old Testament

[39:14] glory in Jesus Christ name and the
[39:16] Saints that amen god bless you as you're
[39:19] being seated there praise God
[39:23] okay so Malachi can switch over Lydia
[39:26] can switch over I want to go through
[39:27] these quotes here tonight by the grace
[39:29] of Lord
[39:37] how many had ever had a real sit-down
[39:40] heart-to-heart with your mother father
[39:42] anyone ever had that before
[39:43] I maybe had a couple not too many and
[39:48] when I talk about it what I mean is you
[39:51] know when when I meet a heart-to-heart
[39:52] where you're your father or your mother
[39:54] just sits down with you only and gives
[39:57] you some real words of wisdom you know I
[40:00] don't know I didn't have too many you
[40:03] know my mom you know growing up when my
[40:05] dad divorced her she just kind of shot
[40:06] at us and tell us what to do you know
[40:08] she was so overwhelmed and with just
[40:12] life in general she would just kind of
[40:14] say Jessie do this or she called me like
[40:16] Simon then she called me cam then she
[40:18] called me Sam that she called me Paul
[40:20] then she called me Betsy then she
[40:21] finally called me Jessie my mom you know
[40:24] she's so overwhelmed she'd called me all
[40:25] the names and finally get to my name but
[40:28] of course she was a wonderful mother but
[40:30] this message tonight is kind of like
[40:32] that I'm kind of looking at this thought
[40:34] as I've read through I think I'm in
[40:36] chapter 24 now I've read chapters 1 to
[40:39] 24 and 31 and and I think one of the
[40:45] main thoughts from the first seven
[40:48] chapters is this idea of Solomon sitting
[40:53] down and talking to his son I don't know
[40:56] if it's as imagine it's his oldest son
[40:58] and then there's of course a couple of
[41:01] times you'll see tonight there's four
[41:03] times in the book of Proverbs where he
[41:05] says children so he's directing the
[41:07] children and so I wanted to just have
[41:10] this I want to start with that thought
[41:12] like tonight we just want to look at and
[41:15] see what would Solomon if you could sit
[41:19] down and listen to the wisest man on
[41:21] earth talk to his oldest son what would
[41:26] he say quite a quite a thought the
[41:31] wisest man outside of Christ if you
[41:33] could just sit there as a fly on the
[41:34] wall
[41:35] what would the wisest man on earth say
[41:37] to his son well we're gonna see it
[41:38] tonight by the grace of the Lord because
[41:41] he says over and over again my son my
[41:43] son my son and I
[41:46] think you'll be blessed by some of these
[41:48] thoughts and so as I as we read them
[41:51] let's think about you know let's think
[41:54] about conversations you can have with
[41:56] your children going forward for those of
[41:58] us who younger parents even older
[42:00] parents you know if you have a chance to
[42:01] sit down with your older children again
[42:03] the Lord would give you an opportunity I
[42:05] just want you to see what the Holy
[42:07] Spirit gave Solomon to say to his sons
[42:11] and then his children there's like I
[42:13] said there's four times or sama just
[42:15] dresses you children he's just speaking
[42:17] broadly to the children and so I'm happy
[42:20] tonight you know I can I can have my
[42:22] children I can tell them children I'm
[42:23] telling you what Solomon told his sons I
[42:27] feel very privileged to be able to do
[42:29] that I can say Malik I could say Lydia
[42:31] acacia all my children this is what God
[42:35] would have Solomon tell his sons and
[42:37] this is what I want to tell you as well
[42:38] now we do it on a daily basis right when
[42:41] we instruct him do this
[42:42] Malachi do this Lydia do this acacia you
[42:44] know do this we go through and tell him
[42:46] these things but I want you to see what
[42:48] the Holy Spirit would have Solomon to
[42:51] tell his son so let's look at this here
[42:53] tonight by the grace of the Lord and you
[42:57] can't you can't read this book without
[42:58] coming across this again and again he
[43:01] says my son my son my son my son ye
[43:03] children you children you can't read the
[43:05] book without seeing this emphasis and of
[43:07] course the Holy Spirit did that on
[43:09] purpose so that we would see what do we
[43:12] need to teach our children what do we
[43:14] need to tell them and I think you'll be
[43:16] blessed tonight by the grace of the Lord
[43:18] now remember in the message and purpose
[43:20] this book the youth are repeatedly
[43:23] admonished to pursue wisdom rather than
[43:26] foolishness and the you should seek to
[43:30] become teachable rather than mockers and
[43:33] I hope that's hope that's how you feel
[43:36] when you look at my children I hope
[43:38] every parent you know feels that way
[43:39] about their children that my children
[43:42] can be teachable how many want their
[43:44] children to be teachable I know what my
[43:46] children to be spoiled rotten
[43:47] know-it-alls I want them to look at the
[43:51] the Saints that are older than them and
[43:52] I want to look up I want them to respect
[43:54] you so I hope that's how my children
[43:56] look if not I got to go home and I got
[43:59] to correct myself first
[44:00] but I believe that you can you can talk
[44:03] to my children and they'll listen to you
[44:05] and they won't disrespect you Adam have
[44:08] they ever distant disrespected you my
[44:09] children I hope not because he's deacon
[44:12] he's he's got to have respect he's got
[44:14] to have that respect
[44:15] well Ram said the children have to
[44:17] respect the deacon if not well Ram said
[44:19] tell me about it and I'll talk to the
[44:20] children about it my children about it
[44:23] the youth have to have a sense of
[44:25] respect for the elderly this is one of
[44:29] the great important aspects of being
[44:32] wise and growing up to be a wise person
[44:34] I notice there's 23 times Salman says my
[44:38] son now of course this applies to all
[44:41] the daughters too but it gives us a nice
[44:44] insight and and here's Solomon he's like
[44:47] the President of Israel he's like the
[44:49] king of Israel we know there's no higher
[44:52] man than Solomon and this is what he
[44:54] would say to his son or sons at the very
[44:57] height of his wisdom
[44:59] remember Ecclesiastes was what he wrote
[45:01] at the end of his life when he's back
[45:04] slid in and he's kind of is he the joy
[45:07] of life has left him you know he's he's
[45:09] not very wise anymore he's dishonored
[45:11] God but the proverbs was written in the
[45:14] very height of his wisdom and so this is
[45:17] what he would write to his son and then
[45:20] this this this phrase here he children
[45:23] has spoken four times so you kind of get
[45:25] an idea what he'd say to to all the
[45:28] children okay so have your Bibles ready
[45:31] let's just let's just be ready to read a
[45:33] lot here about the grace of the Lord I
[45:35] think we'll just go right from chapter
[45:37] one on and at the end of this I kind of
[45:41] want to bring it down to the adults and
[45:43] I want to look at how the adults can be
[45:45] mentors to young believers the but we'll
[45:51] get to that how the Bible says the older
[45:53] women ought to be willing to teach the
[45:54] younger women at the same time you know
[45:57] the younger women got to be willing to
[45:58] be taught right and the younger men got
[46:02] to be willing to be taught to by the
[46:03] older men as long as they're qualified
[46:06] to teach you know they must have a godly
[46:08] testimony you will see and the Bible
[46:10] lays out what your requirements are to
[46:12] be to be a godly teacher
[46:14] whether a woman teaching other women or
[46:16] man teaching other men so that's why I
[46:21] kind of want to go with this direction I
[46:23] want to look at this okay so let's go to
[46:24] chapter one now if you look up here
[46:27] there's 23 times he says my sons my
[46:30] number of these and we'll get through
[46:31] maybe half of them tonight by the grace
[46:33] of Lord just depending on how fast we
[46:35] read let's go to chapter 1 verses 8 and
[46:38] 9 let's go to proverbs chapter 1 verse 8
[46:40] 9 8 was our text so Malachi can you
[46:48] start can you read verses 8 9 please sir
[47:01] amen
[47:02] now the word here means to obey it's not
[47:04] just listen it's not just you know look
[47:07] at me and and your eyes are on me and
[47:09] you know you're actually hearing with
[47:10] your eardrum it actually means to obey
[47:13] so Solomon say my son obey me obey your
[47:18] father and obey your mother this is his
[47:22] first time he addresses of course the
[47:25] the reader how many glad you obeyed your
[47:29] parents when you were younger I was very
[47:32] grateful
[47:33] how many wished you would obeyed your
[47:34] parents better no you'd have to raise
[47:36] your hand but I can say truly my
[47:39] children have truly obeyed my wife and I
[47:41] they've been such faithful children I'm
[47:43] very grateful for how they've obeyed me
[47:47] now look at verse 9 for if children if
[47:52] you obey your father's instruction and
[47:55] mother's instruction the Bible said the
[47:58] grace of God is like an ornament or
[48:00] chain around your neck and now the word
[48:08] grace means favor
[48:10] so children you want favor when you get
[48:13] older doing people to favor you and like
[48:15] you more than maybe sinners or they can
[48:18] help you more when you're older you have
[48:21] to start at the beginning by honoring
[48:23] your mother and father and if you do
[48:26] that you'll find favor
[48:28] later on in life you know I think of how
[48:31] I just share a few things from my heart
[48:34] here you know I take we take our
[48:37] children to horse lessons well the
[48:39] leaders of the horse lessons have told
[48:41] me numerous times like the man's almost
[48:43] crying he said you got the most
[48:44] beautiful family brother Jesse he's
[48:46] almost crying and it's because the girls
[48:49] fear the Lord and the boys numb and then
[48:54] a Taekwon no I've had numerous people
[48:57] tell me give Malachi great compliments
[48:59] and things like that and why is that
[49:01] it's because they're being taught the
[49:03] Word of God the Word of God is a seed
[49:07] and it's planted in their hearts and if
[49:09] you plant it in their hearts
[49:11] it will bring forth a new season and so
[49:15] Malachi is favorite Taekwondo when they
[49:19] need somebody to do a help that adult
[49:20] can do like the other day I we were just
[49:22] exercising I didn't know how to hold the
[49:24] bag I kept messing up the bag well the
[49:26] first one they chose to take my place
[49:27] was my own son because he has favor and
[49:31] he does a good job you know I've never
[49:33] held the bag before so I don't know how
[49:34] to hold it that's kind of funny cuz he
[49:37] started before me and he just he pays
[49:39] better attention I guess than me but the
[49:43] first person they chooses not other
[49:44] adults it was Malachi because he's got
[49:46] favor he's earned favor with them it's
[49:50] because he listens he works hard he
[49:52] doesn't talk back he sweats every time
[49:55] you know he takes it seriously and just
[49:57] like that at the horse lessons that the
[50:00] girls have the favor of the head man and
[50:03] the head woman like I just they put it
[50:05] on Facebook the other day they can't
[50:06] wait to get back and see the girls again
[50:09] and I just thought I'd just share I'm
[50:11] not bragging on my children I'm just
[50:13] saying like that's what the Word of God
[50:15] should produce the Word of God has to
[50:17] have an effect if you're putting the
[50:19] word in the children's lives it has to
[50:21] have an effect and it'll work for
[50:23] anybody because the it's universal it's
[50:26] a seed and it's play if it's placed in
[50:28] the heart the right way it'll bring
[50:29] forth of its own kind so I want to say
[50:33] that you know our children should have
[50:34] favor as a good older if we're teaching
[50:36] them the Word of God and making them you
[50:39] know making them obey sometimes bamboo
[50:41] sticks if you need
[50:42] bamboo sticks I use bamboo sticks to
[50:44] smack my children on the back of their
[50:45] legs you know for I haven't had to do it
[50:47] for a while they've been pretty well
[50:48] behaved but that's how we trained our
[50:51] children you know just with bamboo
[50:52] sticks in order to produce grace in
[50:56] their lives that they'll have favor as
[50:58] they get older and so we've seen that by
[51:01] the grace of the Lord this was Solomon
[51:03] says them the wisest man outside of
[51:06] Christ says children listen to your
[51:09] mother listen to their father it'll give
[51:11] you favor around your neck now let's go
[51:14] to verses 10 through 14 Lydia can you
[51:17] read 10 through 14 in chapter 1 I'm
[51:24] sorry you're fine yeah take your time no
[51:25] problem
[51:26] proverbs 1 10 through 14 all right so
[51:53] what's what Solomon's first warning to
[51:57] his son I'm him or he's King his first
[52:00] warning his son do not take company with
[52:03] with a bunch of violent young men that's
[52:06] his first warning now you're gonna see
[52:08] the main thing he warns him about is
[52:10] violence
[52:10] searching for riches and women those are
[52:13] the main three if you read the first
[52:14] eight or nine chapters Solomon's first
[52:18] warning of course his son would have
[52:20] riches all around him he'd be living in
[52:22] the nicest rooms in all of Israel he'd
[52:26] probably have gold you know a gold
[52:28] bedpost you know he does the softest
[52:31] feathers and all of Israel would be
[52:32] under his pillow you know he'd have and
[52:35] so his his main direction to his son
[52:37] don't hang around violent young men
[52:40] don't try to get rich quick just do
[52:44] what's right listen to your mother
[52:45] listen to your father
[52:47] in other words hang around the right
[52:50] people right birds of a feather flock
[52:53] together right so that's
[52:55] first warning to his son be careful who
[52:59] you hang around and I'm very careful who
[53:01] my children hang around like I said we
[53:03] don't do sleepovers because I'm very
[53:05] careful who they hang around with and if
[53:08] I see them hanging around with someone
[53:11] who's not good character we're done
[53:12] hanging around with that mouth for a
[53:14] while we'll be done with that well will
[53:17] break off Taekwondo if Malachi can't
[53:19] behave we'll break it off if they can't
[53:21] behave at the horse lessons and there
[53:22] are somebody's infiltrating my
[53:24] daughter's we're gonna break it off
[53:25] we're gonna make sure they're around
[53:27] godly people that's why I love bringing
[53:29] them to church because they're around
[53:30] you all godly people that love the Lord
[53:33] I love how they run over to sister
[53:35] Connie when Connie gets here and they're
[53:37] gonna give her hugs and hug all of you
[53:39] you know and they talk so highly of Adam
[53:41] in BO and Naomi they talk so highly of
[53:43] all of you at home you know they do it's
[53:46] because we want them around the godliest
[53:48] people we know and give them warnings we
[53:53] don't hang around any fools we don't
[53:55] hang around any child that's gonna
[53:56] corrupt your behavior you will not hang
[53:59] around them very long we'll take you out
[54:01] of their out of their presence that's
[54:04] the first warning company be around the
[54:07] right people have the right company all
[54:09] right let's go to the third time he says
[54:12] my sons go to verse 15 now hi can you
[54:16] read 15 through 19 please sir all right
[54:44] so again he just takes some more time
[54:45] more admonition to stay away from the
[54:49] greedy violent young men right because
[54:52] don't young men like to feel strong and
[54:55] I'm crying knows that we like to feel
[54:57] strong we like to feel invincible I like
[54:58] to feel that we can conquer you know we
[55:01] like to feel like we're important or
[55:02] powerful or strong we want to be leaders
[55:04] you know with Solomon's warning his son
[55:07] don't go with the men that are doing it
[55:09] for greed don't hang around them keep
[55:12] the right company don't try to get rich
[55:14] fast and don't try to fight and prove
[55:17] how strong you are you know it takes
[55:18] more of a man not to fight somebody
[55:20] right takes more of a man or woman a
[55:24] godly woman to step back and not fight
[55:26] because jesus said if somebody slaps you
[55:27] on the cheek he said turn the other
[55:29] cheek right anybody can fight back but
[55:34] it's the person who can control
[55:36] themselves and be a Christian testimony
[55:38] that's the person who's really got
[55:39] christ-like character and so that's what
[55:42] Solomon says here now let's go to
[55:44] chapter 2 verse 1 like I said I'm just
[55:48] gonna hit this to the fourth time
[55:50] Solomon says my son and then I just hit
[55:53] you know the highlights I just want to
[55:55] make make sure I emphasize here in the
[55:57] text how do you feel like you feel like
[56:01] it's pretty good advice so far from a
[56:03] king a rich king a wise king pretty good
[56:06] vice listen to your mother and father
[56:09] and then don't hang around young men
[56:12] that will corrupt your character violent
[56:14] young men men that are trying to get
[56:16] greedy quickly hang around the right
[56:18] company this is the wisdom of God
[56:24] chapter 2 verse 1 I'll read this 1
[56:27] through 9 my son if thou won't receive
[56:30] my words and hide my Commandments with
[56:33] thee so that thou incline thine ear unto
[56:35] wisdom and apply thine heart to
[56:38] understanding now like verses 3 to 6 now
[56:42] on the Bible study I did last Wednesday
[56:45] night I really emphasized verses 3 to 6
[56:48] if you want to grow in the fear of the
[56:51] Lord this is how you grow in the fear of
[56:53] the Lord brother brand I've always said
[56:55] you know pray and read your Bible it's
[56:57] so true and this is this is the kind of
[56:59] prayers we need in verse 3 yeah if I cry
[57:03] after knowledge and lift us up thy voice
[57:04] for understanding if thou seekest her as
[57:07] silver and searches for her as for hid
[57:09] treasures then thou shalt understand the
[57:12] fear of the Lord and find the knowledge
[57:14] of God for the Lord giveth wisdom out of
[57:17] his mouth
[57:17] cometh knowledge and understanding all
[57:21] right
[57:22] so when was the last time you search the
[57:24] internet for something you really needed
[57:26] what was the last time you searched
[57:28] YouTube to try to fix your bathroom sink
[57:31] I did a few weeks ago I watched video
[57:34] after video how do I fix this it's not
[57:35] draining how do I fix with the stopper
[57:37] and so I crawled under there I watch a
[57:39] few videos and I took about an hour to
[57:42] fix the sink and I had to really had to
[57:46] really search I need to know how do I do
[57:49] this I don't want to mess up the
[57:49] plumbing you have to call the plumber
[57:51] it's gonna be a hundred dollars just for
[57:52] a service call now I didn't cry out for
[57:56] knowledge but I had to kind of set
[57:57] everything aside I wanted to do and I
[57:59] had to go spend some time watching
[58:00] YouTube on how to fix the bathroom sink
[58:02] well that's what God said here if you
[58:05] want knowledge you've got it invest time
[58:07] in it if you want to fear god if you
[58:10] were to love God more you've got to cry
[58:12] out for that amen
[58:13] none of us can you can't go about it any
[58:16] other way you've got to get alone with
[58:18] God and say God give me wisdom God give
[58:20] me understanding God help me to love the
[58:23] word more amen there's no other way to
[58:25] get it than to get alone with God and
[58:28] cry out for wisdom this is what Solomon
[58:30] is telling his son do you want to be
[58:33] wise you got to cry out for it
[58:36] that's verses 1 to 6 remember verse 5
[58:39] again shows how to understand the fear
[58:41] of the Lord or grow in the fear of the
[58:43] Lord
[58:44] a member the fear of the Lord is the
[58:46] whole driving force behind getting
[58:48] wisdom we'll never get to whistle
[58:51] remember the fear the Lord is like our
[58:52] fuel you're not going to get your
[58:54] destination wisdom you're not going to
[58:57] get to wisdom without having the fuel of
[58:59] the fear of the Lord fear the Lord is
[59:02] the most important thing it's the
[59:04] beginning of wisdom so we must fear God
[59:07] we must respect God we must keep his
[59:10] word we must honor God's word that will
[59:13] drive us to a wise life amen
[59:15] we'll be wise virgins hallelujah amen
[59:19] that's right and that's what the Bible
[59:22] said he was last Wednesday night was on
[59:24] the fear of the Lord now look at verse
[59:28] a set I'm sorry you verse seven yeah he
[59:33] layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous
[59:34] so God has that wisdom laid up if we'll
[59:36] just go get it
[59:37] he's a buckler to them that walk
[59:40] uprightly he's a shield in other words
[59:42] God will protect you if you're walking
[59:44] in the truth he keepeth the pass of
[59:48] judgment and preserveth the way of his
[59:50] Saints verse nine then shalt thou
[59:54] understand righteousness and judgment
[59:56] and equity and every good path Amen
[1:00:00] that's that's my burden church oh that's
[1:00:03] your burden I want to walk a perfect
[1:00:06] life before Christ I want every path I
[1:00:10] make as a pastor every path I choose as
[1:00:12] a pastor every path I choose as a father
[1:00:15] as a schoolteacher I want every path I
[1:00:18] choose to walk on to be the right path I
[1:00:21] don't want to walk in a wrong path I
[1:00:23] want to know I don't want to get off the
[1:00:25] beaten path I want to stay true to God's
[1:00:27] Word this is what wisdom does it will
[1:00:29] help you choose every right decision now
[1:00:35] I must hit the highlights of verse
[1:00:36] twelve to deliver thee from the way of
[1:00:39] the evil man
[1:00:39] from the man that speaketh froward
[1:00:42] things so again he's telling his son
[1:00:45] wisdom will deliver you from the evil
[1:00:48] man
[1:00:49] so because remember wisdom won't let you
[1:00:51] walk with the evil man and if it won't
[1:00:54] let you walk away or hang out with the
[1:00:55] evil man it's gonna deliver you from the
[1:00:57] evil man praise the Lord and now Solomon
[1:01:02] gets into the second thing that I'm
[1:01:05] sorry the third thing that his son
[1:01:06] really has to avoid the strange woman
[1:01:09] remember violence quick money hanging
[1:01:14] out with the evil men and then now the
[1:01:17] strange woman so go to verse 16 now can
[1:01:21] you read verse 16 please sir so wisdom
[1:01:30] will deliver you from evil men it'll
[1:01:32] deliver you from evil woman how many
[1:01:34] seen it work before Amen wisdom will do
[1:01:38] that it will protect you as a shield
[1:01:42] it will make sure you walk in the right
[1:01:43] paths now here's what the Bible said the
[1:01:46] evil woman does verse 17
[1:01:47] she forsaketh the guide of her youth so
[1:01:49] she either left her leadership of her
[1:01:53] father or she left her husband or maybe
[1:01:55] first husband second husband who knows
[1:01:57] she left the guide of her youth and
[1:02:00] forgets the Covenant of her God so
[1:02:03] that's a strange woman a woman who
[1:02:05] doesn't honor the Covenant of God's Word
[1:02:08] look at verse 18 for a house and cliath
[1:02:11] unto death and her pass unto the dead
[1:02:16] none that go unto her return again
[1:02:19] neither take they hold of the pass of
[1:02:22] life so in other words most men who get
[1:02:26] involved in adultery go to hell
[1:02:29] most men right because we know the few
[1:02:32] few there are that be saved jesus said
[1:02:34] and here the Bible says when a woman
[1:02:37] gets him ensnared he goes to the way of
[1:02:40] Hell now that's chapter 2 that's his
[1:02:49] fourth warning to his son he starts
[1:02:51] talking about the evil men and stay away
[1:02:54] from evil women alright chapter three
[1:02:58] let's go to verse 1 chapter 3 verse 1
[1:02:59] like I said we'll try to get through as
[1:03:01] many of these as we can
[1:03:02] I think there's 23 where he says my son
[1:03:05] yeah alright chapter 3 verses 1 to 10
[1:03:09] now let's look at the benefits here
[1:03:11] you're gonna see all these probabilities
[1:03:14] remember of Proverbs has promises and
[1:03:16] also probabilities probabilities of
[1:03:19] longer days long life peace health and
[1:03:23] Phil Barnes these are all things Solomon
[1:03:27] as a king wants his sons to remember
[1:03:30] about wisdom all right my son forgetting
[1:03:34] out my law but let thine heart keep my
[1:03:37] Commandments Oh
[1:03:43] Samson remember Samson gave God his
[1:03:46] strength but not his heart
[1:03:48] in other words Samson kept the Word of
[1:03:50] God because he should have you know his
[1:03:52] parents told him to when it came down to
[1:03:54] who do you love more Delilah or the Lord
[1:03:56] he loved the the filthy woman more than
[1:03:59] love God's Word see we want to love
[1:04:02] God's Word more than anything else we
[1:04:05] want to obey that doctrine from the
[1:04:07] heart Paul said if you can't obey it
[1:04:10] from the heart yet just keep obeying it
[1:04:12] and say God helped me to love to obey
[1:04:14] this helped me to love your word more
[1:04:18] than anything else but see that's what
[1:04:21] Solomon I'm sorry Samson didn't have of
[1:04:23] course Solomon lost it at end of his
[1:04:24] life too
[1:04:25] he loved his wives more than he loved
[1:04:26] the Lord at the end of his life my what
[1:04:29] a sad story we don't want that testimony
[1:04:31] verse 2 for length of days and long life
[1:04:36] and peace shall they add to thee sounds
[1:04:39] like the statue of pervert man if you
[1:04:41] keep the wisdom of God God will add all
[1:04:43] these things to you add your faith and
[1:04:46] virtue then now it kind of sounds like
[1:04:47] that doesn't it's kind of an Old
[1:04:48] Testament statute of a perfect man if
[1:04:51] you keep your father's commands and your
[1:04:54] mother's law I'm gonna give you long
[1:04:57] life first length of day second piece
[1:05:00] those three look at verse 3 let not
[1:05:04] mercy and truth forsake thee bind them
[1:05:07] about thy neck write them upon the table
[1:05:10] of thine heart beautiful mercy and truth
[1:05:15] so thou shalt find favor
[1:05:18] that's Grace and good understanding in
[1:05:20] the sight of God and man how many
[1:05:22] remember when Jesus the Bible said when
[1:05:23] he was raising up the Bible said Jesus
[1:05:26] grew in favor with man and with God
[1:05:28] praise the Lord I remember that from the
[1:05:30] Luke chapter 1 he grew in favor with man
[1:05:33] and God Solomon says the same thing if
[1:05:36] you give heed to wisdom you'll you'll
[1:05:40] have favor with men and you have favor
[1:05:42] with God as well
[1:05:43] amen what a promise ah we need we need
[1:05:46] to take advantage of that promise amen
[1:05:48] we want people to favor us oh if I could
[1:05:51] choose any of the teachers I choose mr.
[1:05:53] Smith right we
[1:05:55] we want a favor I could choose anybody
[1:05:57] on the factory I choose brother Adam
[1:05:58] right
[1:06:00] I could choose anybody here to church I
[1:06:01] to sister so-and-so you want favor with
[1:06:04] God and with man verse five oh this is
[1:06:11] the most when the most memorized verses
[1:06:13] in all Holy Writ let's read it let's
[1:06:16] read it together one two three
[1:06:17] trust in the Lord with all thine heart
[1:06:20] and lean not unto thine own
[1:06:22] understanding and all thy ways
[1:06:25] acknowledge him and he shall direct thy
[1:06:28] paths amen that's so worth memorizing
[1:06:31] amen
[1:06:33] trust in God with all your heart that's
[1:06:38] why people break commands of God like
[1:06:42] that's why people you know leave a
[1:06:44] marriage they don't trust God well God
[1:06:45] can't help my spouse or God can't help
[1:06:47] my wife err and so they don't trust in
[1:06:50] God with all their heart or let's say
[1:06:52] they stop paying their tithes and
[1:06:53] offerings well I don't I just don't
[1:06:55] think God can provide you know I can't
[1:06:57] see anything getting better at work you
[1:06:59] know they don't trust in God with all
[1:07:02] their heart if God gave a promise God's
[1:07:04] gonna move all heaven to back up that
[1:07:07] promise amen
[1:07:09] not to wait and be tested a little
[1:07:10] longer than what you want to wait but
[1:07:12] you just hang around God's Word heaven
[1:07:14] earth shall pass away but God's Word
[1:07:16] will never pass away it's exactly right
[1:07:20] see they don't trust God we need to
[1:07:24] trust God with all of our heart now look
[1:07:28] at verse 7 that's where we got to be
[1:07:29] careful for especially the message be
[1:07:31] not wise in thine own eyes fear the Lord
[1:07:34] and depart from evil
[1:07:35] that's that's why I said earlier we got
[1:07:37] to be careful with that with well I
[1:07:39] think I can get away with this I'll just
[1:07:40] break the word a little bit here maybe
[1:07:42] maybe the word doesn't apply in every
[1:07:44] situation I'll just break it here a
[1:07:47] little bit I'll compromise a little bit
[1:07:48] that's us being wise in our own eyes
[1:07:51] we must not be wise in our eyes but in
[1:07:54] the eyes of God because look what
[1:07:58] happens if you do that verse 8 more
[1:07:59] promises verse 8 it shall be health to
[1:08:03] thy navel
[1:08:04] that's your stomach
[1:08:07] mero to thy bones now look he gets into
[1:08:11] tithing here so he's telling you son son
[1:08:13] you better pay your tithe verse 9 honor
[1:08:18] the Lord with thy substance and with the
[1:08:20] firstfruits of all that increase so
[1:08:24] shall thy barns be filled with plenty
[1:08:26] and thy presses shall burst out with new
[1:08:29] wine which farmer wouldn't want that
[1:08:35] barns that were full which Christian
[1:08:38] doesn't want a bank account that you
[1:08:40] know you've got enough in the bank
[1:08:42] account to pay all the bills that month
[1:08:43] or that season of your life what
[1:08:46] Christian doesn't want that blessing
[1:08:48] well if you want that blessing Solomon
[1:08:50] says you've got to trust in the Lord
[1:08:52] with all your heart you've got to give
[1:08:56] God the first increase right the
[1:08:58] firstfruits and he says if you do that
[1:09:02] your barns will be full and you'll have
[1:09:04] whatever you need what a promise now
[1:09:10] that's verses 1 to 10 now in verses 11
[1:09:12] to 20 he gives a next admonition I'm
[1:09:18] gonna do it on time okay do it okay all
[1:09:21] right Malachi can you read 11 11 to 15
[1:09:26] let's see 11 to 15 hey man we'll stop
[1:09:57] right there the next thing the fifth I'm
[1:10:00] sorry the sixth thing he says to his son
[1:10:02] my son don't get tired of God correcting
[1:10:06] you right don't get tired
[1:10:10] of God's Word constantly correcting you
[1:10:13] showing you where you're wrong don't get
[1:10:15] tired of that be happy when God corrects
[1:10:18] you and then he gets into next the
[1:10:23] promise of happiness you will be happy
[1:10:25] the Bible says happy is the man that
[1:10:28] finds wisdom amen
[1:10:32] what a promise I love verse 15 she is
[1:10:39] more precious than rubies and all the
[1:10:42] things that thou canst desire are not to
[1:10:45] be compared unto her what a statement my
[1:10:49] goodness oh my think of LeBrons LeBron
[1:10:55] James is home over there in Bath
[1:10:56] Township it's been compared to a hotel
[1:11:00] his house is so big it's like a hotel
[1:11:01] and then he's got houses in Florida and
[1:11:04] then houses in California all these
[1:11:09] things you could want are nothing to be
[1:11:12] compared to the wisdom of God you can't
[1:11:15] even compare them well he just signed a
[1:11:18] contract for 33 million dollars for one
[1:11:20] year that's nothing compared to the
[1:11:23] wisdom that God is trying to give us is
[1:11:26] that right that's kinda it's got a silly
[1:11:28] but that's true the wisdom that we're
[1:11:32] supposed to live daily with is more
[1:11:35] valuable than any riches we can put on
[1:11:38] any scale 100 million two hundred
[1:11:40] million three hundred million 1 billion
[1:11:42] 10 billion any valuable merchandise and
[1:11:48] the amount of money the Bible says is
[1:11:51] nothing compared to being wise amen so
[1:11:56] let's just remember let's try to shake
[1:11:57] off our the dust off our minds and just
[1:11:59] remember how valuable it is to be a
[1:12:02] Christian in this hour so valuable and I
[1:12:06] was thinking of you know some examples
[1:12:08] of wisdom you know on the way to church
[1:12:10] I didn't have a chance to ride all them
[1:12:12] down but I was thinking about how we
[1:12:17] must choose to do wise things the Bible
[1:12:19] said the wise Christian redeems the time
[1:12:24] so we need to make wise decisions about
[1:12:28] how we handle our time in other words we
[1:12:31] need to give more of our time to helping
[1:12:33] others we need to get more of our time
[1:12:36] to giving to others more of our time to
[1:12:39] getting alone with God and praying and
[1:12:41] seeking the Lord giving to the Lord
[1:12:46] anything and I'm gonna think of some
[1:12:48] examples in the scripture
[1:12:50] I think of Cornelius you know how he
[1:12:53] devoted time after time you know he was
[1:12:56] a soldiers right so he would leave he
[1:12:59] would leave a Rome right his post of
[1:13:01] duty Rome and he would go home and he
[1:13:03] would spend his time praying and fasting
[1:13:04] and giving alms to the poor right he
[1:13:08] left the army right he let me leave the
[1:13:10] reserves let's just call it the reserves
[1:13:11] okay corniest would leave the reserves
[1:13:14] he'd come home and he'd spend time
[1:13:16] praying he'd spend time going to give
[1:13:20] alms to the poor maybe on the way to
[1:13:22] work he'd slip out a few $5 bill give it
[1:13:24] to the poor guy that you know he know
[1:13:26] he's not a crack addict you know he he
[1:13:28] wouldn't waste his money he'd be wise
[1:13:30] even with his money so he was so wise he
[1:13:34] spent his time praying in secret fasting
[1:13:37] giving to the poor and then God sends an
[1:13:41] angel at the very moment he is praying
[1:13:44] and fasting and said I'm gonna send you
[1:13:46] Peter get ready to receive a man who
[1:13:48] preach the gospel amen
[1:13:51] in the very moment of praying and
[1:13:54] fasting God sends an answer so think
[1:14:00] about how wise it is that that's so
[1:14:01] applicable for you and I and the example
[1:14:04] I'll get for the women I've said it
[1:14:07] again and again I'll say it again sister
[1:14:08] Dorcas after she died they came around
[1:14:11] and showed Peter all the clothes that
[1:14:13] she knit together for the children her
[1:14:17] ministry after she would do her work her
[1:14:19] ministry was to go knit together make
[1:14:21] clothes and give him out to the poor
[1:14:23] children and God's thought so much that
[1:14:26] he raised Dorcas from the dead what a
[1:14:28] great ministry we should be doing things
[1:14:31] that are helping other people yeah as we
[1:14:36] get that we'll get to the proverbs 31
[1:14:37] woman a week from Sunday I'll preach on
[1:14:39] that I'll preach a Easter message Sunday
[1:14:41] but then the following Sunday remember
[1:14:43] she did all these things she had her
[1:14:44] children clothed
[1:14:46] she had a business in the field she was
[1:14:48] planting food in the field she was
[1:14:50] providing she was making money she's
[1:14:53] bringing in food from the ships you know
[1:14:55] this was a real godly businesswoman you
[1:14:58] know she was very wise with her time and
[1:15:02] so we've got to make sure we're wise
[1:15:04] with our time and not wasting our time I
[1:15:07] don't get me wrong church I get tired
[1:15:09] like you there's times I just need to
[1:15:11] sit on the couch and relax that's okay
[1:15:14] if not I'm gonna get sick again if I
[1:15:17] don't do that
[1:15:18] but there's times we need to look at our
[1:15:21] time and the wisest people will redeem
[1:15:24] the time they'll make the most of their
[1:15:26] time living for other people but of
[1:15:30] course rest yourself to don't wear
[1:15:31] yourself out so you're no good to
[1:15:33] anybody so wisdom has no comparison you
[1:15:38] can't put a price tag on it 20 million
[1:15:40] 30 million 40 million you can't put a
[1:15:45] price tag on the the knowledge that God
[1:15:49] wants or has already given you or is
[1:15:51] going to continue give you to give you
[1:15:53] the help you live the right kind of life
[1:15:55] you can't put a price tag on it
[1:15:57] in other words it's so valuable to come
[1:15:59] to church when we're preaching on wisdom
[1:16:01] amen
[1:16:01] it is more valuable than if you are
[1:16:04] working tonight at JC Penney or
[1:16:06] something like that well I need an extra
[1:16:08] job no you just need more wisdom praise
[1:16:10] the Lord now if you're gonna get an
[1:16:13] extra job and not miss church praise the
[1:16:15] Lord that's great or like brother I'd
[1:16:19] have said a woman that wants to help her
[1:16:20] husband pay off the debts he said that's
[1:16:21] fine that's wonderful that's wisdom
[1:16:24] usually a woman's place is in the
[1:16:27] kitchen but we know there's times where
[1:16:29] the RAM said it's okay if she needs it
[1:16:30] if she can do it and not neglect her
[1:16:32] children and she can work a little job
[1:16:34] and help out the family praise the Lord
[1:16:38] but wisdom will never lead us to break
[1:16:41] God's word that's exactly right and
[1:16:44] there's no value we can place on how to
[1:16:47] make wise choices in your life
[1:16:49] I love I'll say like this I love when
[1:16:53] people come to church and I'm the same
[1:16:56] way and you come to church and say God I
[1:16:59] need wisdom for my life I've got an
[1:17:02] unspoken request I need to know what to
[1:17:05] make on the next decision
[1:17:06] don't you love coming to church like
[1:17:08] that God loves when you come to church
[1:17:11] like that I love when people say brother
[1:17:14] Jesse pray for me for wisdom I love that
[1:17:16] they're actually asking for the most
[1:17:18] valuable thing they could ask for right
[1:17:24] if they came up and said I need a
[1:17:26] million dollars that's I would actually
[1:17:28] say well let me pray for you to get
[1:17:30] wisdom first because if you have that
[1:17:32] attitude of what a greedy attitude of
[1:17:34] what money if you get it you're gonna
[1:17:36] waste it anyway
[1:17:39] the most valuable thing you could ask
[1:17:41] for is God's wisdom so don't don't no
[1:17:45] let's not skip past verse 15 so so
[1:17:47] quickly.i
[1:17:48] I just felt led to kind of stay a little
[1:17:49] longer on that you cannot desire
[1:17:53] anything more important than what
[1:17:55] decision to make next in your life
[1:17:57] should I travel there should I live
[1:17:59] there should I move there should I leave
[1:18:01] the job should I do this should I leave
[1:18:03] move to the church or do a different
[1:18:05] Church or what whatever a decision
[1:18:07] you're gonna make it is the most
[1:18:10] valuable thing to find the wisdom of God
[1:18:12] for that situation I cannot you cannot
[1:18:16] and I cannot place a high price on it
[1:18:18] it's invaluable it's exactly right now
[1:18:25] let's finish verse 16 length of days is
[1:18:28] in her right hand and in her left hand
[1:18:30] riches and honor so look wisdom is
[1:18:32] sitting there it's got long days and
[1:18:34] it's got riches and honor on the other
[1:18:35] hand wisdom saying come get wisdom for
[1:18:38] me I'll give you wisdom and it's got
[1:18:40] riches and honor and it's got a length
[1:18:44] of days now who does it what who wants
[1:18:47] them who wants a shorter life here does
[1:18:49] anybody want a shorter life anybody want
[1:18:51] to go to the grave any time soon I don't
[1:18:54] think so
[1:18:55] anybody want to struggle financially
[1:18:58] here nobody ends up the way to avoid
[1:19:04] those in most cases like I said most
[1:19:06] cases there's job cases and there's
[1:19:07] other cases right there's the the beggar
[1:19:10] Lazarus the beggar there's that case
[1:19:11] there are certain cases where God allows
[1:19:13] people to be tested but in most cases
[1:19:15] you want to live longer and you wouldn't
[1:19:17] have enough money to live a good life
[1:19:19] that's you know that's my main reason
[1:19:21] for what for wanting more money if I
[1:19:24] would want war more money is to be able
[1:19:26] to give more is to be able to help more
[1:19:29] people the Bible said when you help
[1:19:31] people poor people it's like helping
[1:19:34] it's like lending to God and the Bible
[1:19:38] said if you neglect the poor the Bible
[1:19:40] will read it later in Proverbs the Bible
[1:19:43] said you're gonna have curses come upon
[1:19:44] you if you neglect the poor but if you
[1:19:48] give to the poor great is your treasure
[1:19:50] in heaven amen hallelujah that's why I
[1:19:54] think we would like if you'd like to see
[1:19:56] more money that's why you want to see
[1:19:58] more money so your barns are full you
[1:20:00] can be giving more to other people
[1:20:03] giving more to God and you don't know
[1:20:05] you don't worry about those things you
[1:20:07] can just focus more of your time on God
[1:20:09] amen that's right
[1:20:13] look at verse 17 her ways are ways of
[1:20:16] pleasantness and all her paths are peace
[1:20:19] so when you come to wisdom she's got
[1:20:21] long life she's got riches and honor all
[1:20:24] her ways are pleasantness and all her
[1:20:27] paths are peace our lives should be
[1:20:31] pleasant even lair to see it we should
[1:20:33] look at our lives and say I've got a
[1:20:34] pretty pleasant life God has God has so
[1:20:37] blessed my life my life is very pleasant
[1:20:39] it's not it's not it's not awful and you
[1:20:43] could also should look at your life and
[1:20:44] say I've got a very peaceful life
[1:20:46] that's what wisdom is supposed to
[1:20:49] produce peace look at verse 18
[1:20:55] she wisdom is a tree of life amen Oh
[1:20:59] glory to them that lay a hold on her and
[1:21:02] happy as everyone that retains her the
[1:21:08] Lord by wisdom hath found the earth by
[1:21:10] understanding he established the heavens
[1:21:11] by his knowledge the depths are broken
[1:21:13] up in the clouds drop down the dew
[1:21:17] do you feel like that you feel like when
[1:21:20] you read your Bible and pray do you feel
[1:21:21] like you're picking apples off the Tree
[1:21:23] of Life pears oranges you name it
[1:21:28] cherries that's what God's holy spirit
[1:21:32] is it's a tree of life and we're
[1:21:34] supposed to go find the wisdom and pick
[1:21:36] it off and say I've got wisdom for today
[1:21:38] I've got a real important meeting I
[1:21:41] prayed I've got a real I got a conflict
[1:21:43] here at work I've got a conflict in the
[1:21:45] church er I need wisdom before you go to
[1:21:48] that meeting that's the time to go to
[1:21:49] the tree of life and pluck off some
[1:21:51] wisdom amen yeah that's right there
[1:21:55] happy is everyone that finds the tree of
[1:21:58] wisdom I don't know how to handle this
[1:22:01] brother Jesse I don't know how to handle
[1:22:03] this go to God go to the tree of wisdom
[1:22:06] and say God I need some wisdom and God
[1:22:09] said I'll give it to you and then once
[1:22:13] you see God's Word overcome or you see
[1:22:14] it overcome again you'll be rejoicing
[1:22:16] saying oh this is so valuable this is so
[1:22:19] much better than just natural riches
[1:22:21] it was the wisdom of God for the
[1:22:23] situation amen
[1:22:30] you know recently I didn't I don't tell
[1:22:33] anybody about this you know but recently
[1:22:35] I had somebody kind of approach me and
[1:22:37] try to correct me on numerous things and
[1:22:39] I just went to the meeting praying and
[1:22:42] fasting and I let the person talk they
[1:22:45] must have talked for the first 15
[1:22:46] minutes and and just send all these
[1:22:49] things I was wrong on which I appreciate
[1:22:52] and you know what church is like brother
[1:22:53] BAM said I have more respect for that
[1:22:55] person now that at least they came to me
[1:22:57] to talk about it
[1:22:59] program said when you love somebody even
[1:23:02] disagree with them if you can love them
[1:23:05] at the end he said you'll think more of
[1:23:06] them than you did before if you keep the
[1:23:08] right spirit but I'll say like this in
[1:23:12] this meeting now that's just my opinion
[1:23:14] the other person probably disagrees but
[1:23:16] I - my observation
[1:23:18] I saw the wisdom of God just flow out
[1:23:20] for every question and I was accused of
[1:23:25] worse things this wrong that wrong never
[1:23:27] I think that's wrong I think that's
[1:23:28] wrong
[1:23:29] and I didn't get nervous you know why
[1:23:31] because I was praying I was in the
[1:23:33] spirit
[1:23:34] I'd ask God to guide me and I felt like
[1:23:38] God gave me wisdom to answer every one
[1:23:41] of the objections and I left there just
[1:23:44] as happy and we hugged and we were both
[1:23:46] crying at the end you know who's just a
[1:23:47] great good old meeting like I said I
[1:23:50] think more of this individual than I
[1:23:51] ever have in my life and though we
[1:23:53] differ on things I felt like God gave me
[1:23:56] the wisdom to say and I walked out there
[1:23:58] as happy I rather I would rather walk
[1:24:01] out of there feeling like the wisdom of
[1:24:03] God spoke than have a million dollars in
[1:24:05] my pocket and no I compromise God's Word
[1:24:08] amen
[1:24:09] I'd rather have that because it's more
[1:24:11] valuable the Bible tells me that you
[1:24:14] might say I'm foolish but I'll tell you
[1:24:15] you're foolish if you don't believe
[1:24:17] God's Word being wise and making the
[1:24:21] wise decisions is more valuable than
[1:24:24] just being rich more valuable all these
[1:24:30] things are promised to those who walk in
[1:24:32] wisdom length of days pleasantness peace
[1:24:35] it's a tree of life if you like if you
[1:24:38] don't feel like you're living it's time
[1:24:39] to get it's time to get this time to get
[1:24:41] God's wisdom and say because when you've
[1:24:43] got God's wisdom you know you've done
[1:24:44] what's right you know you have obeyed
[1:24:46] the Word of God now you can be happy now
[1:24:48] I can feel like I'm living I'm doing
[1:24:51] what God called me to do that's why
[1:24:53] people can't many times feel like
[1:24:55] they're happy because they feel like
[1:24:57] they're torn I'm breaking the Word of
[1:24:59] God or I've done something wrong we've
[1:25:01] got to confess our wrongs and then do
[1:25:03] the right wise decision walk in a wise
[1:25:05] path and then the Bible said we'll be
[1:25:07] happy we'll have life well have peace we
[1:25:11] should walk through this life as a walk
[1:25:14] of peace we should live the bottom ember
[1:25:17] the Bible said live peaceably with all
[1:25:18] men we should have peace even if people
[1:25:21] disagree with us or don't like us or
[1:25:23] speak evil of us we should have to be
[1:25:26] able to walk in such wisdom that we at
[1:25:28] least we have peace with them that's
[1:25:30] what the Bible says all right go to
[1:25:36] verse 21 this is the seventh time he
[1:25:39] says my son chapter 3 verse 21 Lydia are
[1:25:52] you able to read hon no okay sorry about
[1:25:55] that thanks for watching her Malachi
[1:25:57] read 21 to 26 please amen let's stop
[1:26:36] right there
[1:26:36] now the first thing I want to say is he
[1:26:38] tells his son set wise words before your
[1:26:42] eyes let me ask you and I gotta ask
[1:26:44] myself - what do we place him before our
[1:26:46] eyes are we constantly looking at wise
[1:26:48] things or foolish things he tells his
[1:26:52] son if the wisest man could tell us son
[1:26:54] he said he said look at wise things keep
[1:26:58] the wise words of God before your eyes
[1:27:01] we have to physically look at the wisdom
[1:27:05] of God and the Bible says
[1:27:09] discretion is purpose the Bible said
[1:27:12] keep sound wisdom and discretion or keep
[1:27:15] a sound purpose in your life now
[1:27:17] discretion in the modern means good
[1:27:19] judgment but in the Hebrew it means
[1:27:23] purpose have a sound of purpose for your
[1:27:26] life who knows what they were put on
[1:27:31] earth here to do does everyone know what
[1:27:32] they're put on earth to do I know what I
[1:27:34] was put on earth to do be a father a
[1:27:37] husband and preach the gospel that's how
[1:27:39] I was put on earth to do
[1:27:41] I've already wrestled that out with God
[1:27:43] I've already prayed and hung it up I've
[1:27:45] saw it God long enough to know that's
[1:27:47] what I'm supposed to do on this earth
[1:27:48] and the Bible said that we all should
[1:27:52] have a discretion we all should have a
[1:27:54] purpose that's why that book sewed sold
[1:27:57] so well it's called The Purpose Driven
[1:27:58] Life
[1:27:59] remember back in 2002 I think it was I
[1:28:02] think it sold 60 million copies you
[1:28:05] imagine it people want to know what's my
[1:28:08] purpose
[1:28:09] what am I on earth to do I'll give you a
[1:28:12] clue whatever you're called to do is
[1:28:14] going to be a walk of wisdom amen
[1:28:17] your calling is going to be something
[1:28:19] that involves the wisdom of God not
[1:28:22] foolishness of God who's just a man but
[1:28:25] the wisdom of God so the writer tells us
[1:28:30] wisdom is life to the soul and grace to
[1:28:34] the neck so it protects you it gives you
[1:28:37] life how many want to walk a walk for
[1:28:41] Christ and never stumble that's what the
[1:28:44] Bible promises there's that probability
[1:28:45] again if you walk and choose the right
[1:28:48] path the Bible said you won't stumble
[1:28:51] how many want to sleep good at night I
[1:28:53] want to sleep good at night I hate in
[1:28:56] the nights where I can't sleep good the
[1:28:58] Bible said have you walk in wise paths
[1:29:00] you sleep where your sleep will be sweet
[1:29:04] and you will live a life without fear
[1:29:07] amen
[1:29:12] this is what we
[1:29:13] does you know you've done the will of
[1:29:16] God you know you've done what's right so
[1:29:18] you can sleep good at night and you're
[1:29:19] not afraid of what's gonna happen next
[1:29:22] that's the wisdom of God can anybody
[1:29:26] think of any better benefits that God
[1:29:28] has left out for wisdom anybody ever
[1:29:32] looked at your benefits package for work
[1:29:34] it's pretty nice package you gotta get a
[1:29:36] nice package can any way think of any
[1:29:37] better package blessings that God has
[1:29:41] kept out from us if we walk in wisdom I
[1:29:44] can't think of anything you sleep good
[1:29:46] there's no fear you got longer life got
[1:29:49] prosperity got health you got eternal
[1:29:52] life
[1:29:52] you've got the Tree of Life amen it's
[1:29:55] more valuable than anything in a natural
[1:29:58] package a company could offer you will
[1:30:01] come work for me I promise you I'll give
[1:30:03] you a I'll cover a hundred percent of
[1:30:04] your insurance well God's got a better
[1:30:06] coverage than that it's called the
[1:30:08] wisdom of God amen hallelujah look at
[1:30:13] the benefits of just waiting on the Lord
[1:30:16] remember because before you get the
[1:30:18] wisdom you got to have fear of the Lord
[1:30:19] and fear the Lord hates evil look at the
[1:30:23] benefits of just waiting on God not
[1:30:25] breaking the word and God says I have
[1:30:28] this tremendous package for you to work
[1:30:32] in my kingdom I want you to work about
[1:30:35] my father's business I've got a special
[1:30:37] position for you sister for you brother
[1:30:40] for the children I've got a special
[1:30:42] position in the father's business and
[1:30:44] I've got all these benefits I don't want
[1:30:46] you to forget your benefits package
[1:30:48] hahaha oh yeah and there's nothing you
[1:30:51] can bear there's nothing Satan can offer
[1:30:53] that's better than this oh my god is so
[1:30:57] good to us
[1:30:57] what a blessing let's just maybe go one
[1:31:04] more chapter here by the grace of the
[1:31:05] Lord I don't go too long let's go to
[1:31:11] chapter 4 verses 1 to 9 are you enjoying
[1:31:16] this I hope you're enjoying it by God's
[1:31:19] grace what would the wisest man say to
[1:31:22] his sons
[1:31:24] remember he's rich he's got everything
[1:31:25] he's got all kinds of wives
[1:31:27] he owns the kingdom anything Solomon
[1:31:29] could ask for anything he could give his
[1:31:33] children he said what's more valuable
[1:31:35] than that is to hate evil is to walk
[1:31:38] away from evil and find the fear of the
[1:31:41] Lord and the wisdom of God this is
[1:31:46] beautiful this is a really good insight
[1:31:50] here look at verse 1 chapter 4 verse 1
[1:31:52] here you children the instruction of a
[1:31:54] father and intend to no understanding so
[1:31:57] now he starts talking to the holeshot
[1:31:58] whole children that's the first time out
[1:32:01] of 4 times he he starts addressing all
[1:32:03] the children before I give you good
[1:32:06] doctrine forsake not I'm sorry forsake
[1:32:10] he not my law look at this is beautiful
[1:32:13] look at verse 3 for I was my father's
[1:32:15] son tender and only beloved in the sight
[1:32:19] of my mother and that's beautiful now we
[1:32:23] get a look who taught Solomon how to be
[1:32:26] wise his daddy
[1:32:28] David where do you think David got his
[1:32:32] wisdom from his father
[1:32:35] where did Solomon get his wisdom from he
[1:32:38] said I was taught it by my father look
[1:32:40] at verse 4 he taught me also and said
[1:32:43] unto me let thine heart retain my words
[1:32:47] keep my commands and live that's
[1:32:54] beautiful so now we know where saman got
[1:32:58] a lot of his wisdom
[1:33:01] now look Church if David had time to sit
[1:33:06] down and talk to his sons shouldn't we
[1:33:09] have time to David wrote songs David had
[1:33:14] to rule the kingdom right David had to
[1:33:18] fight wars but according to Solomon
[1:33:20] David had time to sit down and say come
[1:33:22] here Solomon remember my words don't
[1:33:26] forget my commands there's something
[1:33:29] special if you haven't sat down with
[1:33:31] your children and give them a nice
[1:33:33] heart-to-heart talk it's you say say God
[1:33:36] give me wisdom when to do that
[1:33:39] because that's what David did to Solomon
[1:33:42] and Solomon is now doing it for his
[1:33:45] children
[1:33:49] someone needs to sit down with those
[1:33:51] children and tell them keep my commands
[1:33:54] right
[1:33:56] yeah look my turn in the eye I can do
[1:33:58] that when I get home too but we do it
[1:34:00] all the time
[1:34:01] about telling them what to do and what
[1:34:03] to say how to treat people keep my
[1:34:07] commands that's what David looked in
[1:34:09] Solomon's I'd said you keep my laws
[1:34:13] listen to your father and this is the
[1:34:18] wisdom of the Holy Spirit
[1:34:22] look at verse five get wisdom get
[1:34:25] understanding forget it not neither
[1:34:28] decline from the words of my mouth
[1:34:30] forsake her not and she shall preserve
[1:34:33] thee love her and she shall keep thee
[1:34:37] how many love the wisdom of God love it
[1:34:40] oh I just love to come to church er I
[1:34:42] just love to read my Bible and hear
[1:34:45] God's wisdom that directs me on the
[1:34:47] right path amen I love that the Bible
[1:34:50] said if you love wisdom she'll take care
[1:34:52] of you Oh hallelujah verse seven wisdom
[1:34:59] is the principal thing therefore get
[1:35:03] wisdom and with all thy getting get
[1:35:08] understanding this is absolutely
[1:35:10] beautiful portions of Scripture exalt
[1:35:12] her so lift up wisdom make it the most
[1:35:16] important thing in your life the Bible
[1:35:21] said
[1:35:22] on her and she will promote you amen
[1:35:26] don't you like that
[1:35:27] if you lift her up she'll lift you up
[1:35:29] amen
[1:35:30] what a blessing hallelujah promise
[1:35:38] that's a promise she shall bring thee to
[1:35:41] honor
[1:35:41] when thou does embrace her when you can
[1:35:45] really love the wisdom of God it will
[1:35:47] make others honor you that's the promise
[1:35:51] of scripture verse 9 he repeats it again
[1:35:55] she shall give to thine head an ornament
[1:35:58] of grace people will just see grace
[1:36:00] God's favor all over your face
[1:36:02] if you choose the wisdom of god it's
[1:36:08] beautiful
[1:36:08] remember what remember what did what did
[1:36:10] stephen have whenever he looked at him
[1:36:12] they're gonna get ready to kill what he
[1:36:13] have he had the face of an angel the
[1:36:16] wisdom of god hallelujah
[1:36:19] a crowd of glory shall she deliver thee
[1:36:25] reminds me reminds us the st. Paul
[1:36:27] doesn't it he said I've got a crown of
[1:36:28] glory just waiting for me because I
[1:36:32] fought a good fight I've won the race so
[1:36:40] I hope you can see this there's nothing
[1:36:41] more important in life than growing in
[1:36:43] the wisdom of God your daily decisions
[1:36:46] like I said I gave those examples well
[1:36:50] maybe I'll just leave my marriage
[1:36:53] maybe I'll just stop paying ties maybe
[1:36:55] I'll just stop going to church maybe
[1:36:58] I'll just stop and people make all these
[1:37:00] rash dishes decisions without really
[1:37:03] looking to the Word of God for the
[1:37:05] answer right well I think I'll go into
[1:37:10] this new business or I think I'll go
[1:37:11] into this new decision here I think I'll
[1:37:14] go in this path here I think I'll just
[1:37:16] form this disagreement here or this
[1:37:18] covenant or I'll make a league with this
[1:37:20] person or that person but the most
[1:37:25] important thing to do is have the wisdom
[1:37:28] of God that's exactly right
[1:37:32] it's the most important thing what
[1:37:35] should I do with the next decision in my
[1:37:37] life nothing can be more important than
[1:37:39] that and that's why I think God you know
[1:37:45] so answered my prayer when I was going
[1:37:46] to quit pastoring a few years ago into
[1:37:47] 2014 I said God if you don't save a soul
[1:37:50] and help me to bring someone in the
[1:37:53] message I'm an equip pastor and I'm
[1:37:55] gonna be an evangelist and so God said
[1:37:57] brother hey men to us I thought that was
[1:38:00] really striking because I was gonna
[1:38:02] leave what was the purpose for my life
[1:38:04] right and I put it I put it in God's
[1:38:07] hands this is so important god I don't
[1:38:09] know what to do should I keep pastoring
[1:38:11] or should I just be an evangelist I know
[1:38:13] I'm called to preach I know that I know
[1:38:14] that's been vindicated to me
[1:38:15] and so God swiftly answered because God
[1:38:19] knew I wanted to walk in the right path
[1:38:21] I don't want to take a step out and then
[1:38:25] oh he stopped passed or numbers oh
[1:38:26] brother Jesse stop pastoring her oh but
[1:38:28] now he's gonna go back into it he
[1:38:30] stepped out of the will of God I don't
[1:38:32] want anybody to say I stepped out of the
[1:38:33] will of God I want to stay in the will
[1:38:35] of God now we all make mistakes but RAM
[1:38:38] said by the will of God we know we all
[1:38:40] make mistakes from time to time but our
[1:38:42] desire should be to always walk in the
[1:38:45] path of wisdom that's right let's let's
[1:38:51] do this
[1:38:52] one more here and then I want to bring
[1:38:54] it closer this thought of mentoring at
[1:38:56] the end here
[1:38:58] alright proverbs chapter 4 verse 10
[1:39:01] through 19 I love this that's let's read
[1:39:04] this here here all my son and receive my
[1:39:08] sayings and the years of thy life shall
[1:39:11] be many I have taught thee in the way of
[1:39:15] wisdom I have led thee and right paths
[1:39:17] when thou goest I step shall not be
[1:39:20] straightened and when thou run us now
[1:39:23] shalt not stumble take fast hold of
[1:39:27] instruction let her not go keep her for
[1:39:31] she is thy life now let me just stop
[1:39:35] right there
[1:39:35] most people don't want to be told what
[1:39:37] to do most people don't want to be
[1:39:40] instructed and told what to do but a
[1:39:43] Christian can recognize when it's God's
[1:39:45] wisdom telling them what to do it's not
[1:39:48] brother Jesse trying to rule your life
[1:39:50] I'm not trying to do that what I'm
[1:39:52] trying to do is point everybody to the
[1:39:54] Word of God I'm trying to let my life be
[1:39:56] pointed to the Word of God and then make
[1:39:59] the decision that keeps the Word of God
[1:40:03] but see most people say oh you can't
[1:40:05] tell me nothing I mean not most people
[1:40:07] but some people you know you who are you
[1:40:09] to tell me what to do
[1:40:10] it really isn't me trying to tell you
[1:40:12] what to do or any preacher or brother
[1:40:14] Brooks or anybody it's us trying to
[1:40:16] point us to the Holy Spirit and to hear
[1:40:19] the voice of the Holy Spirit and turn
[1:40:22] away and hate evil and love
[1:40:24] righteousness it always boils down to
[1:40:26] that but most people don't want to be
[1:40:32] instructed verse 14 enter not to the
[1:40:35] path of the wicked and go not in the way
[1:40:37] of evil men avoid it passed not by it
[1:40:41] turn from it and pass away for they
[1:40:44] sleep not except they have done mischief
[1:40:46] so there so they so love evil they can't
[1:40:48] even go to sleep until they've done some
[1:40:49] evil or and looked at some evil thoughts
[1:40:51] of evil and their sleep is taken away
[1:40:55] unless they cause some to fall verse 17
[1:40:59] for they eat the bread of wickedness and
[1:41:00] the drink and drink the wine of violence
[1:41:03] I like this here it is right here but
[1:41:05] the path of the just is as the shining
[1:41:08] light that shine ahthe more and more
[1:41:11] unto the perfect day amen hallelujah
[1:41:14] praise the Lord would you like that if
[1:41:17] we are walking in the wisdom of God our
[1:41:20] lives should be more bright in Christ
[1:41:22] all the time as we go along serving God
[1:41:26] it shouldn't be more dark well I wonder
[1:41:28] from it should get more light it should
[1:41:31] just take more questions out the more I
[1:41:33] serve God the more clearer it becomes oh
[1:41:35] this is so clear the day is shining
[1:41:39] brighter and brighter unto the bright
[1:41:41] day the Bible said my life should get
[1:41:45] more clear should be more clear all the
[1:41:47] time this is what God wants me to do if
[1:41:51] it's getting more dark we need to get in
[1:41:55] the dark closet and pray more right are
[1:41:58] the Bible says in the Old Testament that
[1:42:02] the light shines brighter and brighter
[1:42:04] unto a perfect day it's like the story
[1:42:09] brother Graham told about your life but
[1:42:11] the man said your life is like a day
[1:42:13] right he said you said like the the
[1:42:16] morning sunrise is like your little baby
[1:42:17] you go to school and then he said about
[1:42:20] noon days and you're getting out of
[1:42:21] school and now you got to get married
[1:42:23] that's your noon day so some of us have
[1:42:25] already past noon but he said that
[1:42:27] evening time you're a grandfather
[1:42:29] grandmother the sun's going down on your
[1:42:31] life right that's kind of like the day
[1:42:35] your day is symbolized your life is
[1:42:37] symbolizes the day rather but
[1:42:39] spiritually the day should get brighter
[1:42:42] and brighter the Bible said we go from
[1:42:46] faith to faith the Bible say we go from
[1:42:48] glory to glory amen we should see our
[1:42:51] lives getting more clear with the will
[1:42:55] of God for our lives that's what the
[1:42:59] Bible says if we walk and wisdom our
[1:43:01] life gets brighter and brighter all the
[1:43:03] time we know what God's called us here
[1:43:05] for I know what I'm supposed to do and
[1:43:07] I'm happy to do what God's called me to
[1:43:08] do hey glory I'm not walking around the
[1:43:12] darkness and this where I'm supposed to
[1:43:14] go where where am I supposed to go
[1:43:16] what's the next step of my life
[1:43:18] it's more clear all the time because I'm
[1:43:22] walking in the wisdom of God not just
[1:43:25] you know just what guess and I wonder if
[1:43:27] I should do this we don't walk around
[1:43:29] with blindfolds trying to which way do
[1:43:32] we go next
[1:43:33] we have a guy Jesus Christ as our guide
[1:43:36] amen he's our guy like mother brand when
[1:43:39] he got lost he looked up for that
[1:43:40] electric line that's that was his guide
[1:43:43] home right and so is our guide home is
[1:43:46] holding God's unchanging hand amen
[1:43:48] the nail-scarred hand which is the Word
[1:43:51] of God
[1:43:52] our wise life should shine brighter and
[1:43:56] brighter unto a perfect day huh me know
[1:44:02] the Holy Spirit is the dissolver of all
[1:44:04] doubts how we know that remember as you
[1:44:07] grow growing God you should sleep better
[1:44:10] less fear longer life increase the money
[1:44:13] most the time you should see this with
[1:44:17] the blessing of God on your life but
[1:44:20] you've got to choose fear of the Lord
[1:44:21] first
[1:44:22] I'll always Reverend Scott I'll always
[1:44:24] hey evil I always choose the right path
[1:44:26] and God will direct your paths to wisdom
[1:44:29] to the tree of life let me close to this
[1:44:32] I got numerous more slides but I didn't
[1:44:33] get two of them let me close with this I
[1:44:35] got quite a few out skip pass okay since
[1:44:45] we're here in Proverbs go to proverbs
[1:44:46] 27:17 let's go to that one proverbs
[1:44:49] 27:17 Malachi can you read that proverbs
[1:44:59] 27:17
[1:45:06] the Bible said iron sharpens iron and
[1:45:09] your godly countenance or your Gauley
[1:45:12] spirit will sharpen other people's
[1:45:14] spirit so how many know it's important
[1:45:17] to have the right spirit the right
[1:45:19] attitude if we have the right attitude
[1:45:22] and we're walking the wisdom of God when
[1:45:25] we interact with others we're only gonna
[1:45:27] help them serve God
[1:45:29] oh brother Adam how you doing her
[1:45:31] brother sister so it's how you do how's
[1:45:34] things at work how's things at school
[1:45:35] the way you talk about your life should
[1:45:38] sharpen their lives right because you
[1:45:41] start talking about oh would you do it
[1:45:42] worker how'd you do this or what'd you
[1:45:44] do with your finances when you talk
[1:45:46] about life with other people it should
[1:45:48] naturally sharpen them you should really
[1:45:50] enjoy fellowship when you get to talk to
[1:45:52] people because your spirit should
[1:45:54] sharpen their spirit and that's one way
[1:45:57] wisdom wisdom is passed on the Christian
[1:46:01] Church we sharpen each other I can't
[1:46:04] talk to brother Adam except I want to be
[1:46:05] a better man when I talk to him at the
[1:46:07] end cuz I hear what he's doing her I
[1:46:09] hear what he's studying the Word of God
[1:46:10] his spirit should sharpen my spirit my
[1:46:13] spirit should sharpen his spirit because
[1:46:16] we should talk about the Lord right we
[1:46:20] should talk about wise things not
[1:46:22] foolishness or did you see that video on
[1:46:25] YouTube out I was hilarious that's all
[1:46:27] you do the whole time you're gonna be a
[1:46:28] fool pretty soon right it's okay to
[1:46:31] laugh every now and then but if that's
[1:46:32] all you talk about you're gonna become a
[1:46:34] you're gonna become a fool they're gonna
[1:46:36] be a laughing jester
[1:46:37] a court jester you're gonna become a
[1:46:40] laughing fool you your spirit what you
[1:46:45] talk about should make other people more
[1:46:47] wise now this other idea of mentoring if
[1:46:54] you need a mentor the church let let the
[1:46:57] person know you can't mentor everybody
[1:46:59] so Jesus chose 12 people he could mentor
[1:47:02] because you can't mentor the whole world
[1:47:05] you don't have enough time to do that
[1:47:08] even God himself in flesh that I can I
[1:47:10] can help about 12 guys at a time I'll
[1:47:13] live with these 12 guys I'll travel with
[1:47:14] them for three and a half years that's
[1:47:16] about all I can handle our church is
[1:47:18] really small so you have to worry about
[1:47:19] mentoring that many
[1:47:20] people but I want you to if you feel
[1:47:25] like you need wisdom pray about
[1:47:28] approaching somebody older in the church
[1:47:30] or somebody that maybe is older than the
[1:47:32] Lord maybe they've served God longer
[1:47:34] than you like if your sister and you
[1:47:37] need help from an older sister look at
[1:47:39] their life make sure they are a
[1:47:40] qualified sister make sure they're a
[1:47:42] godly sister and pray about approaching
[1:47:44] them because their countenance can
[1:47:46] sharpen you how many can say amen to
[1:47:48] that and if you're a brother you need
[1:47:50] help or need some type of wisdom or need
[1:47:52] some type of counsel pray about it find
[1:47:55] a brother who you feel like is really
[1:47:57] god-fearing and real reverent walks in
[1:47:59] the fear of the Lord and approach them
[1:48:01] and ask say can we sit down and have a
[1:48:03] little fellowship I've got some
[1:48:04] questions I've got to ask you there's
[1:48:06] nothing wrong with that now go to Titus
[1:48:09] chapter 2 we'll kind of finish her there
[1:48:13] we are here to help each other on the
[1:48:17] way on our journey for wisdom Titus
[1:48:27] chapter 2 verse 1
[1:48:40] but speak the things which become sound
[1:48:42] doctrine that the aged men be sober
[1:48:45] grave temperate sound in faith and
[1:48:48] charity in patience so when I need
[1:48:51] advice
[1:48:52] I don't go to younger men usually I go
[1:48:56] to men that I've watched serve god for
[1:48:59] years and years and they have to they
[1:49:01] have to act like this they have to be
[1:49:03] sober they're not joking all the time
[1:49:07] they have to be sound in faith that to
[1:49:09] live a life of self control their net
[1:49:11] you don't overeat they don't self
[1:49:13] indulge and do all kinds of things
[1:49:15] they're they they brought their body
[1:49:18] under subjection to the Word of God I'm
[1:49:20] just using that as one example
[1:49:21] overeating you know they got to be
[1:49:24] temper they don't smoke they don't drink
[1:49:26] you don't I mean they're they have
[1:49:27] self-control they don't joke around too
[1:49:30] much you know they're they're very
[1:49:31] seriously they love the Lord and I see
[1:49:35] them give it charity there they're kind
[1:49:38] they're loving and they're patient they
[1:49:40] can wait for God to fulfill his word so
[1:49:47] that's where our
[1:49:48] our brothers want to get sharpened by
[1:49:50] somebody they've got to find someone
[1:49:51] who's more experienced in the Lord and
[1:49:54] think about they've got to live the
[1:49:56] right kind of life verse 3 now here's
[1:50:02] for our sisters the aged women likewise
[1:50:04] that they be in behavior as becometh
[1:50:06] holiness not false accusers not given to
[1:50:10] much wine teachers of good things so
[1:50:14] there's the qualifications verse 4 that
[1:50:17] they may teach the younger women to be
[1:50:19] sober to love their husbands so if our
[1:50:23] younger sisters say I'm having trouble
[1:50:25] loving my husband I'm having trouble
[1:50:27] being sober and serious I'm having
[1:50:29] trouble next is loving my children if
[1:50:33] sisters need any mentoring with that
[1:50:35] they should pray and find an older
[1:50:37] sister on who to approach about that
[1:50:39] that's what the real Church of God has
[1:50:42] to be discreet chaste keepers at the
[1:50:46] home good obedient to their own
[1:50:51] husband's I'm having trouble guiding my
[1:50:53] home I'm having trouble obeying my
[1:50:54] husband can I talk to your sister that
[1:50:59] the Word of God be not blasphemed
[1:51:02] look at young men verse 6 young men
[1:51:05] likewise exhort to be sober-minded you
[1:51:10] ever see that young men have a trouble
[1:51:12] being serious you ever seen that young
[1:51:16] men there they're just so carefree and
[1:51:18] they just they live they might have been
[1:51:19] baptized in Jesus name but they just
[1:51:21] live anyway they don't take care of
[1:51:24] their money they're not even looking for
[1:51:25] a wife they're not saving to get a house
[1:51:27] someday they're just so carefree and the
[1:51:29] Bible said they need to talk to a godly
[1:51:31] man they need to be sober they need mean
[1:51:33] more serious and walking the fear of God
[1:51:36] don't waste your time redeem the time
[1:51:39] that right let's say our feet by God's
[1:51:42] grace so that's why Whitter should have
[1:51:46] mentoring
[1:51:47] now you know I know you can't force
[1:51:51] anybody to learn you can't force the
[1:51:54] horse to drink if you take it to the
[1:51:56] water but you can take it to the water
[1:52:00] and I'll say like this it's getting more
[1:52:02] and more rare to find young men or young
[1:52:05] women that really want to learn the
[1:52:06] things of God it just just rare more
[1:52:09] rare all the time you don't find a lot
[1:52:13] of people that want to be instructed
[1:52:14] well this is how you need to live your
[1:52:16] life according the Word of God they
[1:52:17] think they can just figure it out
[1:52:18] because they're so wise
[1:52:20] which is probably worldly wisdom but
[1:52:24] this is the design God has in his church
[1:52:26] and it's the same design that God had
[1:52:29] for Solomon Solomon had to sit down with
[1:52:31] his son say son this is how my father
[1:52:35] David taught me this is how you need to
[1:52:38] live your life and that's what the
[1:52:42] Church of the Living God needs to do how
[1:52:49] many know the Bible says when you hide
[1:52:54] when you correct someone it's hiding a
[1:52:57] multitude of sin how many want to be
[1:53:00] used of God to do that I do I want God
[1:53:04] to use me to come along and send me a
[1:53:05] younger brother or send me a young young
[1:53:08] sister someone that that will receive
[1:53:10] the instruction of God maybe in a godly
[1:53:12] meeting or something and I want to tell
[1:53:15] them what to do in order so they can
[1:53:18] avoid the pitfalls of Satan I want to
[1:53:22] direct men away from violent boys from
[1:53:25] gangs right I've tried to do that the
[1:53:27] last few years I've tried to direct
[1:53:28] people away from gangs right away from
[1:53:31] drugs some of them still go back and do
[1:53:33] the drugs but I try to direct them away
[1:53:36] from that and give them the wisdom of
[1:53:39] God to live the right life how many want
[1:53:45] to have a wise countenance that they can
[1:53:47] sharpen somebody else's countenance amen
[1:53:50] and we know that countenance comes
[1:53:52] through prayer through seeking God
[1:53:55] obtaining the wisdom of God yourself and
[1:53:57] then you can sharpen somebody else let's
[1:54:00] just pray for that tonight let's pray
[1:54:01] that God will help us to have sharpen
[1:54:04] countenances right here that we can be a
[1:54:06] blessing to somebody else remember you
[1:54:08] can't force somebody to be a mentor you
[1:54:10] can't force somebody to try to force
[1:54:13] them to do what's right but you
[1:54:14] can sharpen them you can sharpen them
[1:54:17] just through your countenance praise the
[1:54:21] Lord
[1:54:23] let's just bow our heads here for word
[1:54:25] of Prayer let's pray that God will give
[1:54:28] us a countenance of happiness a
[1:54:30] countenance of peace a countenance of
[1:54:33] wisdom not a countenance of depression
[1:54:36] or sadness or defeated nakhon tynin s'
[1:54:42] that's wise it's shining brighter all
[1:54:45] the time that we can sharpen the
[1:54:47] countenance of others let's pray for
[1:54:53] that pray with me if you would by the
[1:54:55] grace of Lord Heavenly Father Lord we
[1:54:57] love you tonight we're grateful for your

[1:55:09] getting with all of our efforts we
[1:55:12] should lay a hold on wisdom and not a
[1:55:17] million dollars or early retirement or a
[1:55:20] mansion with all of our efforts we
[1:55:26] should lay a hold on the perfect will of
[1:55:29] God for our lives the wisdom of God
