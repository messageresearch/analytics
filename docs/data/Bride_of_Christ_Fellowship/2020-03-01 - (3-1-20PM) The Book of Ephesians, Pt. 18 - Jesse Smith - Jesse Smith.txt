kind of Livie a wonderful job beautiful I just feel free as a bird here freeze it up tonight praise God let's take our Bibles I'd like to go to T's in chapter 4 let's continue looking at this I want to get a few thoughts out I still have you know the soul series I want to continue it I still got that purpose series I want to mention get back to that the kind of feeling led of the Lord to go this direction here with the Ephesians series sophie's ins for let's go to verse kind of ended right there at verse 29 beatings 429 you know how sometimes you guys sing after service I was gonna say well we have everybody come up we have enough mics for everybody have their own mic I know we don't it's kind of joking there let's say hey we should start like that next week you know get everybody up here just give everybody mic is let's glorify the Lord you know I love that I think you guys I think everybody does a wonderful job and just want to just so sweet to worship the Lord together you know I just you just can't beat the presence of the Lord praise God and he's great and greatly to be praised amen I always want to wear out my voice I'm sure Amen does - we just want to wear out our voice that's our that's our sacrifice let's do that by God's grace visions for verse 29 we'll try to continue this chapter Lord willing I kind of would look at the grieving of the Holy Spirit tonight and of course the the pleasing of the Holy Spirit and then Lord willing we want to get to chapter 5 verse 1 and look at that thought about the Veil the veil over the heart so by God's grace let's read verse 29 together Ephesians 4:29 let's begin on three one two three let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister grace unto the ears so how many you look at your life as say I'm a minister do we look at that our lives that way we minister we serve other people by our words that we say how many ministers we got here phrase God everybody's handed me up James hands up right there right James look at that now we're not all preachers but we all preach by our lives right like my mentor says preach me a sermon live me a sermon rather than preach one right so that's my heads forward of prayer here as we approach the throne of God here and let's ask God to minister to us Heavenly Father we love you we asking you Lord to minister to us that we might minister to others we want to minister edification we want to minister hope and grace and peace and love dear God I pray Lord take your word now bless it to our hearts as we go scripture by scripture and pull out these nuggets Lord God and these these truths that we love and father just quicken them to our hearts let's walk in victory we've seen these songs we will see miracles we will see Giants fall thank God hallelujah we'll see strongholds fallen Lord God is so true we see it in our lives now we thank you for it this is the revival of this entire world this message is the revival because we're revived to the true Word of God so thank you Lord God and our God is greater and stronger so we're so thankful Lord God that your presence be felt here tonight minister now to us in Jesus Christ's name the church said Amen god bless you didn't see that I'll try to just watch my time here so don't where everybody out nor myself so you can switch over I just want to put that visual up there again and I just want to kind of go to script these scripture by scripture now let's look here we'll go right to this scripture here so no corrupt communication the Bible says but that which is good to the use of edifying now edify means to build up the act of one who promotes another's growth in Christian wisdom and piety or happiness so our words are to build each other up to make us more wise right to make us more wise more pious more respectful for God not to corrupt or tear people down but to build up praise God and then we Minister grace which grace is unmerited favor so we're supposed to minister grace to other people through our words praise God that's why I don't feel bad you know saying god bless you to people that probably maybe they're not blessed by God I don't know but I want administer grace with my words praise God I want to administer I want to be some form of hope because most people Church are just being torn down you imagine that most people are being torn down by their friends their family their children their their co-workers I want to be a person that's remembered as building people up because I extend grace to them praise God extend love and so this is the scripture where it says edify the Bible says in with grace unto the hearers praise God so that's the first one I will look at verse 29 now verse 30 I want to spend a few minutes here and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you're sealed unto the day of your Redemption now just reminder you're sealed by him for the day of redemption that's why he seals you for that day praise God so you won't fall away before that day that you'll be preserved for that day amen that's why were sealed for that day praise God so there's where we're guaranteed to be there praise God we're sealed to that day but yet we still grieve him where we grieve alone in our minds when we put on the old man that's where we grieve him I don't know if you knew this church but grieve this word means to make God sorrowful and this one would look at for a few moments to affect with sadness it also means to cause grief to throw into sorrow to offend to make one one easy to cause him a scruple so how many know that the Holy Spirit gets sad you read that he gets grieved he gets sorrowful it's it's there's numerous places in the scripture where it talks about that I just want to tell a quick story you know Bob Arum always compares it to a dove right he compares the Holy Spirit to a dove and if you offended of or you growl at a dove were they gonna do they're gonna fly away right and so what I was saying he's not saying you can lose your seal but you lose your anointing in your mind your human spirit so the Dove can fly away from your thinking and here let me give you a concrete example where brother man uses that he says I wonder tonight if there would be someone here who'd be convinced in their own heart that you grieve the spirit away from you the Dove is gone now some people might say the Dove the seal how can I use my seal that's not what he's saying this the anointing is gone you don't have it sweet peace no more you don't go to the sink to wash your dishes and look out the window to see if you can see him coming so that's the sweetness of the Holy Spirit when you're going about your daily job washing dishes and I do a little bit of that just a little bit when you're on the job you should be able to look out on your break right and you should look I wonder if he's come in the sky today that's what real ramjets that's the sweetness of the Holy Spirit I've done that before I've been driving down the road just singing and look up at the sky eastern sky and just imagine him trying to break through the clouds there oh so wonder if this will be the day you ever feel like that that's what he says it's like you don't drive your car down the road going to work brother when you get a chance to look out the window to look into the skies and feel that sweet deep peace in your heart like you used to something happened the Dove took its flight so it's right here when we lie well we're angry with too much wrath right passionate wrath steal gossip the Holy Spirit takes his flight its offended I've never seen a cockatiel bird before anyone see you have a cockatiel bird what bird do you have okay I thought was a yeah but you have a bird so growing up I had a bird we had a cockatiel bird you ever seen they're white and they got these big yellow cheeks now my mom I'm not gonna say much but my mom wasn't a very sanitary person so she let the bird fly all around you can imagine the mess that made okay that's as far as I'm gonna go but at first the bird was so scared wouldn't even fly towards any of us and then pretty soon we would just be sitting there watching TV like couch potatoes you know and all of a sudden the cockatiel would land on your shoulder nose like whoa you know I still remember that it would land and then like you know you if you kind of moved it would fly away but the more got used to us it would sit there and then it would it would let us pet the bird like we could pet under it would put his head down and we would pet that bird and you could pull back the feathers and see it's pink skin but if somebody opened the door real quick it would fly away or if you move real quick it would fly away and I thought that's a perfect illustration of the Holy Spirit it was like my sister could talk to that bird I don't know if you how crazy people are here or not maybe I'm crazy but honestly it felt like my sister could talk to that bird and understand it and it would make noises and COO back my sister had a real intimate relationship with that bird because like there's some type of kinship and I never had that much kinship with the bird but she was so close to that bird that it was like this experience almost like the Dove of the Holy Spirit she was the favorite and the Dove would the cockatoo would fly in and always go right to her if she was there and she'd feed it you know and get the the birdseed out there and COO and just like brother have said just COO and share it's love you know and that's exactly like the Holy Spirit is for us but they it would get offended if you slam the door or if you yell it would get offended or if you move really quick it get offended and fly away you have to wait till it come back it didn't come back when you wanted to it came back on its own terms so is the Holy Spirit the Bible said grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you're sealed offend him now now let's go through a few I'm not going to read them all but did you know Genesis 6:3 the Bible said God's Spirit is he said will not always strive with man that means contend God's Spirit will not always wrestle with a man and try to get him to repent Genesis 6 6 it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him the Bible said at his heart so the same idea of God being sorrowful sad in the days of Noah and here we are in the days of no right as it was the days of Noah so shall be in the coming of the Son of man and the Bible says grieve not offend not don't make the Holy Spirit said now here's a good one to the the Bible said when Jesus looked around on them with anger speaking of the Pharisees being grieved for the hardness of their hearts he said to the man stretch forth thine hand and Mark 3:5 and he stretched it out and his hand was restored whole as the other so whenever the Holy Spirit comes into a service and hearts are grieved and they don't want to believe and they don't want to move on with God and they don't want to worship God gets grieved God gets sorrowful in this case Jesus got angry Jesus got upset that they wouldn't believe in the miracles and Jesus of course is God in flesh right the Word made flesh so we can see Jesus acting the same way as the Holy Spirit did in the days of Noah right and so we know that Jesus worked the same way his Spirit worked the same way today in the last days of Noah right so we see the same idea we don't want to make God angry doing we don't want to make God upset with us praise God so we must be careful how we respond to the Word of God remember Stephen prays and you stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears you do always resist the Holy Ghost he said as your fathers do so do you the Bible says quench not the Holy Spirit and that word is like a fire extinguish your brother and sister the Holy Spirit's like a fire it wants to move to every heart he said don't quench it don't got your fire extinguisher and try to cool in other words don't try to cool somebody off Amen if somebody's having a good time don't try to cool him off you just be happy for praise God you keep that fire going if you stir that verse enough praise keep praying keep singing keep worshiping like you do keep amen in the word like you do just stay on fire don't clench that Holy Spirit hey man try to keep that fire burning praise the Lord thank the Lord so you got to keep it burning keep it BIRT moving keep it growing in the things of God now hebrews 3:10 says God was grieved with that generation of Israel in the wilderness and said they do always err in their heart they have not known my ways remember this is the this is the generation that saw the Exodus they saw the Red Sea miracles they saw manna right they saw water out of a rock they saw all these things that they kept complaining may God help us not to complain when we complain we surely grieve the Holy Spirit right wherefore I was grieved with that generation because they always do err their heart honey thankful for your good health today how many thank mover the food on your table aim ahead let's be thankful praise God how many thankful for your home church amen how the area we're thankful we don't want to grieve and offend and upset that sweet Holy Spirit we wanted to stay right here with us praise God amen I mean I'm over the year search I've had numerous people come into our church and they'll email me later but Amen they'll be like there's such a sweet atmosphere in your church that I get emails from that debt from numerous people over I'll just like specially preachers it's so easy to preach there's a sweet atmosphere now church what atmosphere is that is that a human atmosphere or is that the Holy Spirit it's got to be the Holy Spirit and I've been to churches where it's hard to preach to certain churches because the people are so rough against it they don't want it their hearts are hardened but we never want that to be our the condition of our church where we grieve the Holy Spirit and we can't feel God's presence anymore we always want to keep an atmosphere where God's presence can sweep down the church and we can feel fresh and we can feel new and we can feel in love with the Lord and we can feel his presence praise God he repeats the same thing in Hebrews 3:17 but with whom was he grieved 40 years was it not them that had sinned whose carcasses fell in the wilderness now this is an interesting thought I want to just briefly share with you I heard a preacher say this I really liked it the Holy Spirit is a very straightforward spirit like when brother Ram lied to the IRS the Holy Spirit didn't say well you might want to consider repenting what the Holy Spirit say what do you say about his hands he said take your take your lying dirty hands off the baby right did Jesus look at the Pharisees and say you might want to consider repenting you kind of got some hard hearts is that exactly that I did address them now don't get me wrong God's a gentleman but many times we we need a reminder that the Lord is very straightforward praise God very straightforward in other words like the Holy Spirit won't beat around the bush right when he's grieved he's sad and the Bible said sorrowful he's offended to make sure how do we get back with his good graces again by repenting saying we're sorry changing our actions our behaviors and the Bible says you can see it and even how you treat your brothers Romans 1415 but if thy brother be grieved with thy meat now walkest thou not charitably destroy not him with thy meat for whom Christ died you ever seen you ever grieve somebody in our church never grieved anybody in your family I've done it before I've hurt people's feelings that you just see their faces kind of go like you maybe you don't mean to grieve them but you just grieve them you know you just hurt people's feelings and we all fall short of God's glory but we should be able to if we can sense when other people are grieved usually like with us maybe we won't talk anymore or you won't want to talk to her very long anymore you won't look you won't look somebody in the eye anymore you know one to be around him anymore they don't shake your hand for a little bit you know grieving you've offended people we've made people sad we've been sorrowful I just want to dwell on this for a moment longer the Holy Spirit can be grieved and it's done when we take off the new man and we get that we let the enemy come in and anoint and take a place in our minds and we say the wrong thing the Dove takes its flight and we got to invite that Dove to come back praise God through repentance amen so let's not forget those thoughts there I just want to share a few of those stories there and a few of those thoughts like with that bird in our house that's a great illustration and we must not offend the Holy Spirit because the Bible says don't grieve him because you're sealed by him unto the day of your redemption what a what a what a paradox I can upset him but yet I'm still sealed by him can anybody explain that I know we can by this than three parts of man what a paradox I can offend his anointing in one area but another area I've got eternal life that's quite the right quite the thing quite the thought he can he can quicken me and my soul I can have his nature in my soul but yet in my mind I've offended him now we're getting down to the mysteries of God right the great mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost Christ in you the hope of glory it's quite a quite a paradox there now let's move on now verse 31 let all bitterness wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice let's go through these definitions here bitterness is extreme wickedness producing a bitter fruit so like the Bible talks about roots of bitterness you are extremely wicked you have extremely wicked thoughts and attitudes toward people that's bitterness wrath means passion anger heat boiling up and soon subsiding again anger is the temper agitation of the desire impulse violent emotion high clamour is an outcry so there's this must be some type of sinful clamor or outcry a crying against someone in a sinful way I don't know much about that word evil speaking is slander right injure someone's good name so that all that be put away that's why I didn't put those brother's names by Rams sons I didn't put their names on the video because I'm not trying to hurt their name but I thought what well with millions of people being influenced by them I've got to get this out people need to hear this because it's the I believe it's the spirit of idolatry evil speaking yes that's right now malice is ill will or desire to injure someone and it says wickedness that's not ashamed to break God's laws Wow put all that away any bitter feelings any wrath and the outcry anger evil speaking put it away from you put all malice or ill will toward I'm sorry towards others put it away Church we should want the best for our enemies that's that's tough that's tough think about the purse that's asked you last time I know amen got it at the work of I'll go I've got a couple of times to think about I only want the best for that person that's putting all mouths away the Bible said put that all away verse 32 and be kind one to another tender-hearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you in the head praise God why are we willing to forgive them because God has forgiven me for Christ's sake amen I can forgive others because Christ forgave me that's our whole motivation behind this behind being someone who doesn't grieve the Holy Spirit so so someone who pleases the Holy Spirit will put all the ill feelings away all that revenge all the bitterness all the evil words and they'll please the Holy Spirit and they'll be tender-hearted with compassion for sinners amen my passion for sinners now I want to get to the main thought here yeah leave this main thought here maybe got 20 more minutes here I want to just oh maybe I'll just close with this thought here next 20 minutes or so yeah Lord willing let's look at this thought here now let's move on now to chapter 5 we're still in the walk of the believer isn't it amazing you can be dwelt you can be I'm sorry give me indwelt by the Holy Spirit in your soul but in your mind you got to constantly flip-flop from old to new old to new stay new stay new keep it true keep it peaceful keep it generous it's a constant battle to not be taken captive by the enemy's lies my god help us now I just had this thought come to me in chapter 5 this morning and as I was preparing here visions 5 verse 1 be therefore followers of God as dear children praise God now dear means beloved so if you are one of God's precious children he said make sure you're following the father if you are one of the God's precious little ones make sure your father you're following your heavenly father now the word follower means imitator glory he said it walk in love and verse two walk in love as Christ also hath loved us and given us gift given himself for us and offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour I'm not gonna look at the sweet-smelling savour that kind of deals with the Old Testament sacrifices which that's a beautiful thought I preached in a little bit but I just wanna look at the imitators for a moment so children of God beloved children of God imitate their father now how do you imitate the father the Bible says you look into the word that's how you imitate the father that's how you do it praise God so let's go over that scripture here let's look at the scriptures and confirm that to you by the grace Lord go to James chapter 1 I just preached this at Bible Club a few weeks ago James chapter 1 verse 22 I like to start there James 1:22 now if a little bit a little bit of history on James James was the half-brother of Jesus and he was one of the early pillars remember Paul went to Jerusalem when he found James and Peter and they were pillars in the church and he was the first martyr after Stephen or says I guess I say the second martyr after Stephen record in the book of Acts there Hebrews and James sorry I'm going the wrong way and this was a mighty man of Valor was James great mighty man man who loved the Lord and this man didn't mince any words when he wrote this letter back I tell people that numerous times when I fight tell anyone that got saved I said go read James you just got saved go read James live like that because this is real faith faith doesn't just talk about it faith acts upon it faith is an action word praise God you see someone sick help them out see someone cold get them warm see somebody hungry feed them that's faith that's faith in action now James 1:22 actually let's go up and read verse 21 wherefore lay apart all filthiness Paul just told us that right that right glory lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls my sometimes I gotta shake myself be a man the word I'm preaching today save souls amen I'm the word if you but see there's got to be it's got to be grafted in a man it's got to be received a man with meekness and this word is able to save souls praise God this engrafted word so see it's gotta there's that same illustration of getting it attached to you it's got to be connected to you praise God which is able to save your souls be doers of the word I think church since we are in the message of the hour we're in the revival of the hour do you believe that I believe we are in the root of the current revival it used to be a zoo zoo Street in 1906 but now it's the bride Street I don't know if you're what to say it's the bride street race god this is the bride Street revival praising hard as far as I know brother bank every Church I look around I don't see revival because the revivals here because I see them compromising with the word especially with homosexuality and riches and prosperity my so my closest friends preach and prosperity you know like that's not always gonna be the case I know God's a God of multiplication and gods a God of duplicating and God's got a fruitfulness he is but not in every case and so the Bible said we must not deceive ourselves and this is what I just want to labor on a little bit you know like even last week with brother brother Brian's messages and why brother Simon a few weeks Lord willing if we don't take that word and apply it to our lives we're just deceiving ourselves it is so important search each each Monday each Tuesday to make sure we're reminding ourselves what we heard right I could show you on my tablet right here brother amen I'll show it to you buddy cuz you're right here tomorrow watch for the chains of events after crying out for prayer for 20-30 minutes if it be his will and I made this reminder when brother Troy is here doing what he said that yeah he said cry out and then he said there'll be a change of events so I just didn't let Troy's message go in this ear and out the other because he said cry out to God and he said then watch the chain of events afterwards so every Monday I follow up and see if any of those chains events are happening here's what they are prayed here at the altar for 30 minutes or 20 minutes afterwards I prayed for the Holy Ghost for my children revival in our church members all of our church members to find their gifts for abortion to end salvation of parents and my siblings and of being a full-time pastor I cry out to God for all those things and there's probably more - and I applied that scripture to my life because if it's not happening yet then I got to wait on God's time for it praise God and I put those reminders on there so I'll remember that I was praying I don't want to forget the word that I've heard now I can't remember every sermon everybody preaches right we can't remember everything but we also can't forget everything right I'm not asking you and I'm not asking remember every sermon I ever preached but I am asking to remember some of it praise God because if we read it and then forget it we're just tricking ourselves oh I'm a Christian yeah I'm okay I'm all right with God are we the Bible says only doers of the word are justified see we had there has to be some some specific messages that speak to our hearts and we remember for a long time or else were just tricking ourselves doers of the word not here's verse 23 for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he's like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass for he beholdeth himself and for goeth his way and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was and this is what I used at the Bible Club I kind of went like this I kind of use this as a mirror and I got real funny with the kids and I looked in the mirror said ah look how ugly I am you know that's kind of Western because it's a mirror right it's a mirror you see that it's a mirror so it's like looking into the it's foolish to look in the mirror and then forget what's in the mirror oh brother bang I don't have glasses anymore brother amen I've got blue eyes rejoice with me that'd be foolish I don't what does the mirror say the mirror says I got brown eyes and James says it's foolish to look into God's Word and see what a Christian should be and then forget it the rest of the time it's foolish like I was telling the kids you look in the Bible and the Bible says to love each other and not tease it's foolish to look in the Bible say I'm a Christian and then go out and tease people because kids do that all the time at school the Bible says love your enemies don't tease your enemies and the foolish to look and say oh I've got purple skin I studied the mirror yep purple skin pink skin foolish and the Bible says don't deceive yourself and listen that's why I believe this would be the difference between the wise and the foolish the wise will remember what the word says about them amen where the foodists will look in the word but then they'll forget what the Word of God says about a Christian that's the difference I believe because the Bible said verse 25 whoso looketh in the perfect law of Liberty and continueth therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed amen praise God so every time we come to church it's like looking in the mirror of God's Word this is what a Christian is I'm not gonna forget this week I'm gonna remember to do this I had a deacon sister went a couple months ago from another church walk up to me sister namely she was he was crying and he was saying I just want to do something for the Lord and then he stepped down for me in a deacon you know cos of certain situations and I looked at him I said sir I said if you want to do something the Lord help out the poor it's that simple jesus said give to the poor and he said like that idea I said just go make a reminder I had a reminder on my phone to give us a pour once a month if I haven't done it already I can at least set up a man-made system to remind me so I can do what jesus said do he's like I don't know my gifts what are my gifts I said well I don't know God will tell your gifts I said one thing you can do is help the poor right you can pray in your closet that's one thing you can do see sometimes we just forget what's in the book praise God God just ask him for a simple humble Christian life amen and we just can't forget what's written in here I feel like if we do the little things and God will take care of the big things don't you I'd be like if I help the poor brother amen and I pray my closet and I fast and I do these little things I do these little things in secret God will take care of the big things that's what I believe and then brother Bailey Karen you were born too fast not so she could cast out Devils so that other people could cast out Devils see see how just like God's purpose is found in humility just remember and what the Bible says praise God integrate like we don't have to memorize another book like we just got new this book praise God we just got to remember what the preacher says what you we just gotta remember what the Bible says we deceive ourselves right this reminds this should remind us of Laodicea they're rich increased with Goods having enough and they don't and they'd have need of nothing they don't have need of anything else they deceive them own their own selves they think they're all right with God they think there's a mouthpiece that mouthpiece of God and Jesus said I've spewed them out of my mouth because they're lukewarm right they're not the mouthpiece of God anymore because they don't recognize their need to become more like Christ by looking into the mirror of God's Word that's one thing I like about this mirror praise God that mirror it always reflects and it never changed his brother Amen I'm just gonna get more white hairs on that mirror but when I look in this mirror I see Jesus and then I see changes I see me becoming more like to learn hey I live by their brother brother bang there'll be no changes on that mirror it's just gonna it's always gonna be the same thing but the beauty of it is when I come back to this mirror I can see myself getting more like Christ praise God that's the difference this is an eternal mere praise God this makes us younger again right in the Word of God it makes us more like Christ and the Bible said it changes us from glory to glory I'm gonna close with that one that's the beauty of this mere please God that's why we are not I bet I say that glory now a couple more scriptures here let me pull this up by God's grace I'm trying to think what I had okay yeah heard us let us do Church let us do what we can to imitate the help that the Holy Spirit right imitate the father how do we do that by looking into the word very simply he said just look at the word hear the word of God and remember what you've heard and and make a change in your life based upon what you've heard and now you're a doer of the word don't be a hero only that's one of the biggest problems with a message it's always been the problem with no any preacher down through the age now it just us Noah's day right if they just heard it and then act on it woe to them they grieve the Holy Spirit if we hear it we have to do it because it's God's will for our lives does everyone understand we got to do it if we hear it okay my last thoughts why do we do it because Christ why do we give ourselves to the mirror why we put ourselves on the altar because Christ gave himself for us Christ put himself on a cross for us praise God and you and I imitate God by looking into the mirror of the word and then we become the word we are changed from glory to glory now let's close with that we're gonna close with that text here tonight yes we deceive ourselves if we leave church and do not act upon the word that we heard second Corinthians let's go let's close to the center in thien's three you've been a good audience I know you're tired I get tired to God give us strength for these last few minutes praise God take a deep breath breathe the Holy Spirit in yes refresh my heart I know it's like I was falling asleep when brother Brian was preaching last week but I knew it was right the whole time I was falling asleep I was battling it when I got up here Maya the Holy Spirit came on me brother Matt a matter brother man I believe with everything I believe everything he said but then I saw the effects in my life that week God God literally strike I just felt a strength you know waking up Monday morning and then the battles I got victory in the mind battles it was a real blessed week so I know it's like to fall asleep something that I'll not hold anything against anybody I'm guilty to you I I get tired I appreciate your efforts but let's go to this synchronous 3:12 let's close to this and we'll be done now this is a picture this is Moses he come down from the Mount he spent all that time in God's glory amen his face was shining with it god help us to shine like that Amen 40 days and God's presence never had to eat or drink and the whole time God was telling him this is the law this is the word I'm not glory he's just hearing God's work he saw God ride it with his finger on the tables and he comes down here it's so bright he's got to put a veil over his face and this is the illustration Paul uses to talk about the New Covenant this is the Old Covenant and Paul uses the same thing to apply it to the New Covenant but you'll see there's changes there's new changes now in the New Testament now second granese 3:12 seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech like James James was very plain if you hear it and you don't live it you're deceiving yourself verse 13 and not as Moses who put a veil over his face that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded for until this day remains the same bale untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament which Bale has done away with in Christ amen now here Paul tells us now the veil is different now the veil for Israel now is on their hearts right because Moses is dead right but he said that veil left Moses and now it's upon their hearts they got a veil covering their hearts so that that they can't their hearts can't sense the glory of God because it's veiled the light can't get in their hearts right because the Bible says the light has shined in your hearts let me know that the Bible says the light of Christ is shined in your hearts so now the veils move it's not on Moses anymore it's on their hearts now verse 13 but even under this day when Moses is read the veils upon what their heart so they read it they read the Old Testament law they read Isaiah oh right they read Exodus to deuteronomy genesis and their hearts are veiled they just can't see jesus christ in it but that's beautiful that's all we see Jesus guys amen he said that he said I'll he cursed the serpent he said he said the woman si will bruise your head and your bruises heal I read that and I see Christ amen Christ bruising the head of the serpent amen Bob said he triumph over them publicly praise God amen but they can't see Christ in that but we do verse 16 nevertheless when it shall turn the Lord the veil shall be taken away see when Israel really turns to the Lord that they'll be taken off their heart and they'll see Christ his light will shine in their heart verse 17 and 18s where I want to go as I close here just give me a few more minutes I got five more minutes on my watch that's 45 minutes sermon right there glory now the Lord is that spirit that's a good that's a good one this scripture right there the Lord is not a second person the Lord is that spirit yeah right and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty here's what Liberty is it's a license the Liberty to do as you please hey where the Holy Spirit is you can do as you please why because when you're born again you only want to do what pleases God that's the Liberty of a Christian I only want to do what God wants me to do amen that's what it means true Liberty is living as we ought to and as we ought to and not as we please so when you say I'm under the law of Liberty that means I'm only doing what God wants me to do praise God I'm not gonna be tempted to let the devil into my life not gonna I'm not gonna let him in I'm just gonna do what God wants me to do I'm under such Liberty my man says like when you get the Holy Ghost it's like you get a you get into a room and you he can use your tongues here he can use you for divine healing up here you know he can use that's on he can use it for divine healing he can use your for wisdom here you have access and you go you have Liberty for God to take you anywhere in his room praise God see but they don't have that they got a veil over their hearts and they don't have the Liberty that desire to do anything God pleases they don't have that but that's what the word Liberty means I just I'll do anything what God tells me to do and I'll only hear what God wants me to do hey hey how dare you that's the law of Liberty I'm only doing what God wants me to do it says to omit things that have no relationship to salvation amen anything that's not related to be in saved I'm leaving it out praise God that's my Liberty I don't have to do anything that doesn't deal with the message of the hour it doesn't deal with the Bible I don't know anything I don't have anything to do with that I'm free I'm in Christ it's all about the word brace God amen glory take the Lord Jesus praise God yeah I always Drive you know mother BAM explains it he that he describes the law of Liberty is driving down the road and there's a cop sitting there and you didn't know it but you're driving exactly the speed limit but Ramson you can look at that cough and say I'm under the law Liberty that's my wife laughs at me I guess I make a fool myself but I always look at the cop and say I'm under law Liberty cop five most sixty Wendy would know because she follows me sometimes I try to just be five over and every time it's a London law deliberate it's not gonna rush you four five over by God's grace because you're under the law Liberty and you can relax you can see the cop and your heart doesn't jump out to be like it's gonna jump out of your shirt huh because you know I'm under the law I'm doing what the law says I'm not transgressing the law that way I'm free ain't nothing to worry about I'm under Liberty praise God that's the illustration program gives don't worry about being arrested because I kept the law thank the Lord amen that's what it says right there I have a license to do the will of God no one can arrest me because I got license to do God's will praise God now the last scripture let's close here verse 18 except me that's the end of the chapter let me I'm just I got it on my iPad not on my Bible let me get my Bible in Gridley ins 3 yeah it must be the last one yep thank you sinker in the ends 3:18 so he's he was talking about how Jews have bail on their hearts but now he says in verse 18 but we all that's you and I all Christians we are with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord in that beautiful we get to look into the mirror of God's glory we look in this mirror and it's a glorious thing they're veiled to it they to them it's like this what's so great about that I don't know that's not very great it's veiled but we actually know the life of the word praise God the glory of the Lord is revealed to us amen we get to look at it and it's not veiled anymore by the Amen it's not very used to be veiled in denomination can you be saved can you leave what is the hope when you get the Holy Ghost is the tons of evidence yeah there's all those veils but now the Bible said we behold the glory of the Lord as in a glass and were changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord let's say into our feet but we all with open face open face means unveiled face that's that's how we used to be right but now the Bible says our face is unveiled it's like we had a veil upon her face but now the veil has been taken off we are with open face and unveiled face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord the spirit of Lord we are chained in the same image from glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord now that word change means to transform to transfigure the same word for Mount Transfiguration amen let's close with that praise God I want to leave you with those thoughts there you and I should have the veil off our faces we should be able to look into God's Word look what we should see what it says and then let it change us to be more like Christ let's bow your heads here for a moment musicians yes if you'll come thank you so much moment church that just meditate on that thought what a beautiful thought this is from st. Paul as we've looked at the word this Sunday March 1st 2020 we've seen the glory of God's Word putting off the old man the evil thoughts the evil words and putting on the new man the new creature in Christ Jesus the question is what scripture we want to see applied to our life what change do you want to see in your life tomorrow can we meditate on that just for a second praise God you know spiritually I just picture each one of you right now you got your head bowed but in spirit see I feel like when you're staring into the Bible God's glory amen because that's what the Bible says you're beholding in a mirror the glory of God and are changed how many would raise your hand say Lord changed me tonight even it's just just a fraction of the image how many want to be changed to be more like Christ praise God let's pray Heavenly Father let something that was said today not from my word but from your word dear God there's something shine upon the hearts of your children dear God let the glory of God radiates upon their countenance Lord God and let us stick with them let it stick with me Lord God that I'll be changed from glory to a greater glory lord please don't let us stay the same if we are we're deceiving ourselves if we hear and walk away and forget it we've deceived ourselves your puppet said we can't go into service and leave the same way it's so true Lord if the veils on our heart take the veil maybe we take the veil away from our hearts so you can shine into our heart your God lord I just pray reveal to each and every person you're going on some way they need to change reveal to me some way I can change are they doing to manifest more of your glory Lord in the old testament they wanted to hide that glory because it was too bright but Lord now you want us to be cities on a hill Amen that cannot be hidden with the glory of God that will shine your light in this hour dear God let us be cities on a hill that cannot be that people will see our good works and glorify the Father in heaven for ye are the light of the world that the glory of God be the light that the world needs to see in our humble little lives we're not sure what we're called to do let us start with the things we know all Christians are called to do like helping the poor praying fasting giving alms dear God I don't know you Jesus Lourdes we're faithful with the little things they'll give us responsibility over more gifts and callings and ministries dear God Marinette Lord [Music] for Lord it's in your precious name the name of Jesus we take something with us that will change us tomorrow we will not be deceived we'll know the truth you're done and at Lord bless your people with that change today a spiritual change to look like your mirror your word Christ's name we ask [Music]
