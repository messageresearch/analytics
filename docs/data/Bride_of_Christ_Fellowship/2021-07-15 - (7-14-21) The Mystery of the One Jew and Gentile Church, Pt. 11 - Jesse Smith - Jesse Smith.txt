========================================

lord for that it's a great revelation for us in this hour and i ordered the book uh i should get it tomorrow my first copy of the bookstore uh i probably hugged that book for a little while and i said thank you jesus it's only been two and a half years and then i got proofread it one more time and then then i can start freaking out i'm excited about that by the way now i turned this on earlier so it shut off and i discharged the batteries leviticus 16 29 though sister who is memory verse from jeremiah 29 so 16 29 i'd like to look again here we'll be looking at the day of atonement here today we finished with the 1629 i think this is nice to see the same thing happen there you know revelation 10 7 finished the missions of god so the seven seals were loose by the lamb right in heaven brought down the earth brought us the real atonement praise god the full understanding of the atonement by god's grace it ain't just speaking in tongues your tone it's the baptism of the holy ghost in your soul now you have the atonement so there's a great connection there the reality of that was restored through the ministry of brother branham praise god it was given on the day of pentecost but lost a lot of the reality of it uh until all mysteries are finished at the end time leviticus 16 29 let's read that together ready one two three and this shall be a statue forever unto you that in the seventh month on the tenth day of the month you shall afflict your souls and do no work at all whether it is we of one your own country or a stranger that's so determinative um praise god we'll come back and read some more that later let's go to the sister who has no reverse it's a little bit longer versus jeremiah 29 11 12 and 13. 11 12 13. don't you turn there we're going to receive saints in the house of god tonight remember we have brother simon coming on sunday he'll be reaching both services i'm just trying to stay right at it seeing the you know three one two three for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord fought for peace and not of evil to give you an expected end and shall you call upon me and he shall go and pray unto thee and i will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and find me when you okay so i have an announcement i'm not gonna share it now it's kind of just a fun announcement i'd like to share nonsense live stream i'm trying to make a reminder okay okay so let's look at the word of the lord here for tonight we ended with a feast of trumpets and i'm sorry i went back to listen to it today and for some reason the audio just stopped like midway through the sermon i was still up there preaching watching everybody moving around you know some reason all the audio caught off last week but we recorded it here didn't we if anybody would need it did we record last week i have a i just want to show that picture again uh it gives us the schedule or the rather the prophetic calendar of god's timeline natural to spiritual and you know we're right here right now we're finishing up the last few souls to be saved it's perfect isn't it church you know there was great revivals you know just not even 100 years ago major revivals but here we are where the bible said there's a famine right at the end time jesus said if you there be that find it uh paul said evil seducers will wax worse and worse and the bible says it'll be a gleaning time here we are right at the end and it just matches the state that we're in right now so it's hard to open the wheel i know it's hard hard for you not to see more soul save you know all the effort we put in it's hard not to see more souls say but we got to realize that's the season that we're in and we're never going to quit we're never going to work we're never going to give up we're going to work till jesus comes amen so we just can't quit because we know it prophetically that's where we are and so we just got to keep laboring until jesus comes now uh we looked at the feast of weeks and then we we did the trumpets last week of course trumpets were gathering together they were blown saying come to the day of atonement prepare yourself in nine more days we'll have the day of atonement now we read there in leviticus that this was a day to afflict your souls okay it was a day of affliction it wasn't a day of rejoicing this whole season was rejoicing my we're bringing the wheat we have all this we got all this bread for the winter time we're set thank god for the week right they were all rejoicing for all this time that's why we're rejoicing now thank god uh for all these souls saved we're gonna have a great time at the marriage supper we have a glorious time in the millennium it's rejoicing now praise god but once it switches over it becomes a very serious condition right just like when it switches over to the gentile church age the last they will see the age uh to the tribulation it becomes real serious life and death serious right it becomes a time of torment the sixth seal uh causes the the nature to to start being interrupted right nature gets interrupted by the true prophet that we know their ministry is real serious because bride is god mercy on uh right from gentiles there's only mercy from the jews and so it comes down to this day of atone nine days later now this was a day it was the most holy day of the year now what's your most holy day maybe easter i know a lot of people look to that day some people might look to christmas it don't matter what day it is uh some some sometimes the bible says some people esteem some days others you know some days more holy than others the bible said other men esteem every day alike right so every day is a holy day but here in israel this was the most holy day of autumn called yom kippur okay it was a day to come and the bible said mourning and humiliation that's what the word afflict means to mourn and afflict yourself and humiliate yourself imagine you come to church and you bring your goat you bring whatever your offering is and you're just humiliated you're ashamed that all this year you just you've fallen short of jehovah's glory you've disappointed yahweh right you've disappointed jehovah so much but but that's how you come to the house of god on this day of atonement and the bible said though you come afflicted but you're gonna leave happy praise god you come afflicted but you knew god was gonna send all your sins away because there was two goats offered on this day praise god and this was the one day of the year the high priest could enter into the holiest beyond the veil praise god and he had the bells and the pomegranates all his garments and everybody knew as long as he was moving and they could hear the sound that our intercessor is still alive thank god god has not cast us off but god is going to forgive us and we're going to have grace for another year praise god and but that hype he's had to sprinkle the outer corpse you know with one of the one of the goats and you have to sprinkle all the way in and you have to take the blood into the presence of god hallelujah in other words god always has to see blood thank god that the blood of jesus christ is sprinkled on our lives amen but we say forgive me jesus i'm trusting in you you're sprinkled with the blood of jesus christ amen hallelujah and so he'd sprinkle it as he went in all the way this was the great day of atonement praise god and all the iniquity all the transgressions for the whole year imagine church imagine all the sins you've done this year but imagine what it would be like to go to church one time during the year and say my slate is clean just imagine the weight you would feel just you feel like the weight would just drop off your shoulders and i got a new starter i got a fresh start to to the year but thank god that we don't have to do it like that we can go to church and leave that that way every time there's turns and you can feel that way on thursday even when we don't have church you can feel that way on monday you can feel it any time because the blood of jesus speaks greater things than the blood of the evil or the blood of bulls who knows the blood of jesus christ god through the blood of the goat praise god and this is of course called all the way in leviticus 16 the whole chapters will go to that and then a short snippet and leviticus 23 and then also numbers 29 7 through 11. so this that's just a very short brief summary of the day of atonement but you came there in humiliation you came there uh mourning over your sin all it was a awful year remember a church the bible said they would make a sacrifice and they would leave with the remembrance of their sin they would they would and leave and they would still feel bad uh and but this day was a day where they knew it was all done away with as long as that man came out alive as long as that high priest came out alive they were good for another year aren't you glad that jesus christ came out of heaven amen he came out of heaven he came up from the grave alive amen and then he ascended to the father and came back down our high priest is still alive amen he's not dead he's alive thank god what a blessing that we have to know that we have uh we have uh representation in heaven amen you have a high free speak in his blood and speaking about his blood and speaking about forgiveness uh having mercy upon us interceding for us today amen in the presence of god it's a tremendous blessing now prophetically church this day of atonement is fulfilled after the three and a half year ministry of the two prophets the two witnesses uh because because the they they don't have uh the they don't have the baptism of the holy ghost remember the bible said they they sacrifice animals we looked at those three scriptures in daniel last week and they're sacrificing animals if they had already accepted jesus christ they wouldn't be sacrificing animals so he has to break covenant in the middle of the week and cause the sacrifice to cease so they have they might know about jesus because brad said the two prophets will preach about jesus but they certainly haven't accepted him yet uh they certainly don't have a revelation yet they don't have a revelation the nail prints because pretty soon on this day of atonement when they get them back from the holy ghost they're going to ask where did you get those imprints they're not sure where they come from right so they see the two prophets and they know something's going on it's a tribulation and they're dedicated to god they're offering their sacrifices they have peace with rome right they have a little bit of peace here for three and a half years uh but yet they're seeing some things in nature happen they wouldn't rain in certain places right water turned to blood they're having all of these they're seeing all these things still sacrificing animals and then the two prophets die right uh everybody celebrates except for the jew but then they they're in there in the street and they see them rise up can you imagine those dead bodies rise up they're going to see rise over that and the resident is going to rejoice all the sinners are going to be mad and screaming and going crazy uh to prepare them to see those big huge demons they're going to torment them for months five months those scorpion horse-like demons they're just getting ready for that they're they're gonna lose their minds uh it's just it's god's gonna torment them because of their unbelief and their failure to repent even after seeing the rapture can you imagine seeing a resurrection seeing someone raised from the dead after three to half days but they'll do it and the bible said they'll ascend and the remnant will glorify god and realize whatever these guys were talking about it's right amen and of course they must have been talking about jesus so sometimes shortly after that jesus physically comes to the 144 000 and he and they asked him what are the wounds in thy hands now he must look like a regular man because he doesn't look like an angel they're like they're not like oh you're an angel he must look like a regular man so he's like what a five foot two man they wrote you know five foot two two or whatever walking up there and they're just gonna meet jesus somehow i think it's on mount zion uh well they're going to meet him before that because they got to go mourn for a while then come back and be born again but somehow jesus comes there and his glorified body looks just like our bodies right now it's just a regular body and they're going to walk up and see where did you get those scars and he said i got them in the house of my friends not enemies but friends the ones who crucified him he still called them friends let's look all our enemies stand they've hated hallelujah yeah we know they're lower than a snake's valley we know they might have blasting the holy ghost or they might have done some evil things or but let's consider them friends you know if god hasn't told us not to pray for them let's pray for them if they're not out from the under the blood let's pray for them let's be friendly let's let the love of god rub off on them amen let's be a city on the hill that cannot be healed let us shine in the light of jesus christ or they can say there's something different about that brother or sister they have the real light of god amen jesus said i got him in the house of my friends he didn't call him murderers he could have that's what many of them were but he said the house of my friends and instantly guilt and shame take over them because that's what the day of atonement's all about the bible said that weep and mourn from house to house they start realizing they their fatal move of their ancestors of crucifying their own messiah zechariah 12 10 through 14 catches this the bible said i'll pour on the house of david the spirit of grace and supplication and they shall look upon me whom they pierce and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his first born and there and that day there should be a great morning in jerusalem as the morning of hadarim in the valley of megadon and the land shall mourn every family apart he mentions that the family the house of david apart and their wives apart and the family of the house of nathan apart and their wives apart so they break up into individual mourning prayer meetings right the women go here the house of david house of manasseh house of esther the women go here the men go over there they separate men and women in order to weep and cry how could we have missed him how can we have missed our messiah how can we have crucified isaiah 53 how could we have crucified isaiah 9 6 how could we have crucified the everlasting father amen oh my the son of righteousness how could we have done it and then we the bible said every family apart and their wives apart their souls are afflicted because it's the day of atonement amen thank god and then god opens a fountain of forgiveness zechariah 31 says in that day there shall be a fountain open to the house of david to the habits of jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness when was the last time you were really thirsty i mean really thirsty and how did you feel when you finally got to some liquid water praise god that's what's going to happen they're going to be so thirsty for righteousness they're going to feel guilt and shame and mourning but all of a sudden god is going to open a fountain a fountain is going to break forth and all the forgiveness is just going to wash over them and they're going to feel clean and washed and they're going to feel oh now we can accept it we're sorry we did that but we accept him now we receive our messiah we thank god for the messiah we accept jesus christ and the bible said they get washed and clean the bible says they are forgiven on the day of atonement i didn't hear you praise god the bible said they get the seal on the forehead hallelujah and that my friends was on mount zion that's where they get born again i was in there on mount sinai singing the song the way they do after they weep and cry they start singing the song of moses they start singing the song of zion amen they start praising god so see it's just like you when you got the baptism you weep you cried but then you started shouting and screaming and praising the lord singing the songs of god see every child of god is born the same way this is a regular old pentecostal server saying ahead amen oh that's beautiful isaiah 66 verse 8 said who has heard of such a thing who has seen such a thing shall the earth i'm sorry shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day or shall nation be born at once as soon as zion travailed she brought forth her children see it was a birth it was a travail oh my uh we saw the problems go up and and now rome and the pope might be after us and who knows there's just gonna be a lot of pressure right there's gonna be a lot of burp pains i'm not sure on the order of all these things but there's gonna be a lot of pain oh look what we've done look for 2000 years we've rejected him oh but then all of a sudden forgiveness jesus will speak mercy to them he said god did it for a purpose just like joe joseph oh don't don't be upset against yourselves you're forgiven god invited you to get a gentile bride and she's in heaven right now waiting for me oh my church when they receive christ in their seat with the holy ghost and they sing and rejoice three of gabriel's six uh items have been fulfilled they finished the transgression there's no more transgression against israel they made an end of sin there are no more sins because they're under the blood of jesus and they've made reconciliation for all of that iniquity think about that 2 000 years of iniquity member iniquities going right and then still doing this lawlessness right uh having no fear of god finally there's a no more transgression there's the end of sins and there's a reconciliation for iniquity finally israel has received a new covenant amen ezekiel said you're going to write it on the fleshy tables their heart they turned it down all these years but finally israel accepts her new covenant praise god what a blessing it's her spiritual birthday 144 000 born in one my day that's what i call blessing praise god mercy now church for us our day of atonement came uh when we were born again of the holy ghost right the bible says repent be baptized in 238 now the word repent means the absorber that's why so many people fall away from the message they never really hate their old sin they just leave it for a little while they just do it a little bit and then pretty soon they can't overcome it then they go back to it right they never really repented he said if you really repented it'd be like the circumcision it'd be cut off right you wouldn't wouldn't go back to it anymore i'm not talking about minor sins both have some fighters since i'm talking about the major sins right and so see repent if when we really get the holy ghost we repent and uh it's like our souls are afflicted right we hate our sin like zacchaeus hated his sin he'll make up for it and so see when we get born again the bible said in acts 5 32 the holy ghost whom god has given to them that obey him praise god so see when we mourn for our sin and we're humiliated and we confess our sins and we're done we pronounce we're done with sin because of how much we love jesus we've obeyed him and he seals us and we have our spiritual day of atonement all the sins are washed away not for a year but for all eternity amen amen just for one year it's for all eternity yes you have to keep doing it you know in this present but god's not looking at so much depression he's looking at a finished word he said you already are sitting in heaven replacement he already said that you are a king and i pray son to god he said that your soul cannot sin because the seed remains that's what he said amen that's not what i said that's what he said praise god so the soul has the day of atonement amen that's glorious that's why we don't go through the tribulation church romans 5 11 says we joy in god through our lord jesus christ by whom we have now everybody say now now receive the atonement we got the day we have the atonement now in other words we are one with god because of the blood of jesus christ i've already had my day of atonement praise god christ has gone into the present the holy or the friends of god and the holy spirit and he sent us a life back upon me praise god i've had my atonement right i'm sorry romans 5 11 says not future now we got the atonement now we are one with god now we're seated in heavenly places now we have every spiritual blessing in christ jesus thank god what happened if that is grace god to know that we now receive the atonement we're not waiting for it israel's waiting for we've received it praise god now this day of atonement actually started on the day of pentecost remember jesus raised from the dead and he said mary magdalene touched me not for i not yet ascended to my father so jesus could not be touched because his sacrifice had to be accepted by the father and this is the type of the red heifer anyone who touched the red heifer would be unclean right because all the sin was placed upon it right but here jesus is our red heifer praise god he could not be touched he said touch me not and so we know that jesus ascended now hebrews 9 11 and 12 tell us what he did i'm going to skip ahead a little bit in this reading he said neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us he already obtained it praise god the atonement has already been received it's been accepted we are redeemed praise god so once the heavenly father accepted him he accepted the sacrifice of jesus christ he secured our redemption the sacrifice has been received god god and the invisible looked at the son somehow and said we accept the blood of we accept your blood heaven accepted the payment for your sins i don't make somebody shout or say amen yeah heaven already accepted for the blood and forgiveness for our sins heaven already did it in fact jesus don't touch me i gotta first be accepted and then hebrews 9 said he was accepted he obtained it so that means he had something so when he come down back down and he showed himself to his disciples he had something he had forgiveness he had atonement he said don't feel bad about yourself he said but go away until you're endued with power from on high amen he didn't say well i'm getting rid of these 11 other disciples because they're not worthy to be atoned for no that's what the blood was for the blood was to atone for sinners the blood was to atone for disciples that made mistakes right that's what the blood was for praise god but the blood here make sure you're still one even though peter denied him three times he had that heaven oh thank god don't know about your mistake i mean you're gonna be worse than peter there i mean mercy for god loves to show mercy he delights in mercy praise god the thing to do is say thank you lord receive the atonement amen said you could have a gallon of oil poured on you he said you can have people speak in tongues and pray over you but if you never accept the atonement you'll never be forgiven you've got to accept it and say thank you jesus i am now oh thank god praise god amen that's when our young people need to have a day of atonement where they know all their sins are washed away that's the baptism of the holy ghost praise god the sacrifice the sacrifice work of jesus is already done he's in a new body and then he can be touched right this is exactly what he did to atone for sins praise god hallelujah now the bible says there's no condemnation to them that are in christ see people misunderstand brother rams quotes he said uh and he was talking about how how if people don't do missionary work they might be judged or if they don't do enough work or it might be someone's fault you know that that somebody wouldn't hear possible if you are a holy ghost will say there is no condemnation against you now you might not if you didn't do all your part you might not get the reward you were hoping for but you're still caught by the blood of jesus christ holy holy satan's bad rewards please god it depends how much you invested in those rewards or those gifts rather but there's no condemnation we'll have no condemnation on that day because the bible says that's what the spirit of god does it takes away all guilt because that was all placed on christ amen amen church i know i fall short i know i make mistakes but i am trusting in the blood of jesus christ that has now i've now got the atonement and now there's no condemnation in me as long as i repent as long as i come back to the cross as long as i come back to kill god as long as i come back to kill god where i remember where god circumcised me he brought me in the promised land that for sure god will say well done with our hearts i will say that believes on me have already passed from death unto life our lives should be speaking a totally different testimony than before we say we got the holy ghost right it should be a brand new life brand new testimony praise god that's what the word of god does the soul is sealed to the day of redemption but yet you've got redemption i don't know your soul's got redemption but the rest of your body your spirit and your body must be redeemed in a glorified body and a theophany and physical all together in one praise god hallelujah well there we go now one more thing i'm sure make sure we get this when those 144 000 get the holy ghost the bible said their first fruits unto god and to the land that's in uh revelation 14 verse 4. this is the son of man reefing the harvest of the earth amen we already got the wheat harvest at the rapture but here he comes down from heaven to that's why he's descending one more time he's got to get the fruit harvest and come down and seal the 144 000 they're called the first fruits unto god amen hallelujah revelation 14 the bible said the gathering of the vine is done by the son of man jesus christ he gathers the vine the holy vine that's been grafted back into the holy tree right and it's destruction and then the or the world rather is destruct destroyed through the wrath of god all because they took the mark of the beast now church let me say something i don't know if you saw this did you see yesterday with these uh there's some uh government workers in texas they're democrats this is all leading to the mark of the beast from what we can see there's some democrats that left the capital they were called there to vote but they left and they they they went on a plane drinking beer to uh to the capital washington dc and according to texas law they can be arrested because they left at a time where they need to be in session voting on a loss and then texas government voted all the senators everybody voted to have their arrests for their arrest now look at that that's look they're threatening arrests you got this our country's being so divided politically and now they're threatening to rest on a big scale and that's why that's why these sinners hate donald trump because he said he was going to lock up hillary clinton you remember that lock her up i don't know if you remember that he never did but that was the big threat that's why they hate him because they of course he's not a good he's not even a christian but they hate him because he's threatening to lock up these sinners that have the mark of the beast because you can have the mark now right you can have the mark of god now you have a mark of the beast now but there's coming one final mark right but brother said you can have the mark of the beast now just like you can have the seal of god now so see i'm just catching these things in the news so the conservatives are threatening jail but those those evil demon-possessed leftists you and you know how they're all liars most of them are liars well we don't know what's going to happen with this situation with these texas house of representative people that left but i'll tell you this it looks like what it looks like from the scripture the left ones are actually going to turn around eventually and threaten the conservatives with jail they're going to return it and that's what's that's what's going to be very similar to the mark of the beast we don't know when we don't know how close we are but i just noticed that i thought wow look at that now we have threats about jail over just dereliction of duty and you know whenever you go against satan satan's gonna bring it right back against them right so just watch that watch that i've never seen this this divided or serious now they're threatening lawmakers to jail just because they won't vote because they know that they'll lose the election because the laws will put into good voting uh standards but brother that's what probably says but says the churches and the government must unite to bring down the squeeze right and bring down this mark of the beast on everybody so it's really interesting that's starting to go to arrests and threats of arrest and taking your freedoms and your liberty i don't know if you saw it yesterday too but uh the the doctors who promote the covenant vaccines they're threatening now to read everybody's text messages and there's so they're gonna they're basically taking away uh freedom of speech and they're they're threatening to do that and to read everybody's text messages in case you say anything about the vaccine they can report to you that's that's they were talking about that right in the united states you see slowly but surely this beast this this catholic united states beast is eroding the rights of free speech away but they'll get we'll get so bad we'll be crying peace and safety peace and safety right that's what they'll be saying right about the time of the rapture peace and safety they got to have a reason to arrest and kill people who will take the mark and see how serious it's getting i've never seen this serious before like you never remember you know republicans saying uh put barack obama in jail that i mean that was just a few years ago you don't remember that it's getting starting to get more serious here we just gotta watch remember that god is with us we've got the atonement we've already been atoned for all of our sins are paid for we don't have to go through wrath because jesus already took the wrath of god for us amen now we might be going through a little bit of pressure but that's par for the course every christian every jew that's a real man of god a woman of god had to deal with pressure but you watch that i'm watching that closely are they really going to arrest these democrats that left texas or not because you know they're going to turn around and try to arrest somebody else you already know the church you know some of those people that stormed the capitol on january 6 are still in prison today and some of them didn't even do anything other than just come on the capitol that's awful see this government here you can start to see how they're infringing about people rights they don't care anybody says they got controlled in judges they paid off the judges they paid off politicians they paid off everybody so they have full control that's what they want they have power but they'll never have power over the bride of christ thank god if they shut our shut our doors if they shut our doors we'll still have church we'll stop church in our house or somehow you can have church at your house praise god or we can gather together somehow we'll find a way to get together praise god go find a way where god's people will be gathered together watching and waiting for the coming amen we're just privileged where we get to know a little bit about it before it comes see watch that church watch it not a threatening jail you know they're going to turn it around wait till biden and kamala or whoever it is the next ones wait till they start threatening people in jail about to get serious but that's okay george it's got to come down to this it's got to come down to where they're you know hunting and hunting and so close so close and so close to see the very left it's squeezing time it's almost down it's almost to the squeezing point right it's got to be real serious life and death and in jail and freedom it's got to come down to that so we're watching that and we're just prepared i'm saying jesus i'm watching for your coming and i sure am praying praise god now the last one we've gone to the trumpets the day of atonement they left forgiven all the sins were given the last feast of the year was tabernacles this was a day of celebration after the final harvest of the year began on the fifth day right so this was five days after the day of atonement they finished all their fruit gathering they gathered in all the fruits and then god said build temporary booths made of tree branches and remember how god made israel to dwell in boots after their exodus from egypt each day had its own burnt meat and drink offerings beside all the daily offerings on the eighth day they had a special sabbath it was a final offering made by fire as a solemn assembly and holy convocation on that last day they finally had permission to go back to their permanent homes [Music] so seven days in temporary boots and on the eighth day they got to go back one major sacrifice one sacrifice they go back to their permanent homes for church this is prophetically fulfilled in the millennium thousand-year millennium according isaiah 65 15 through 22 and revel 20 verses 1-6 the sun will have a peaceful reign this is a peaceful time this is a time of celebration seven days right seven days temporary homes praise god and so we see here that this is after the battle of armageddon right and it's now the harvest is totally complete there's no more harvest this is just rejoicing and what it's been harvesting amen oh god thank god the with the barley's been brought in christ has been harvested amen the wheat the gentile bride has been brought in and now the fruit the jewish president has been brought in and now we're just rejoicing all the harvests are complete let's rejoice in what we've harvested amen a thousand years of rejoicing over the harvest thank god now church to me i could be wrong in this i think the seven days of rejoicing represents god getting his seventh day of rest i could be wrong with this i've debated back and forth with my family in a loving way we kind of see this differently right but it don't matter because it don't apply to us really like they don't apply to us getting ready for the rapture so i believe in genesis one and two the six days i think the six days were actually six thousand years of creation i could be wrong that's what i believe because on the seventh day it was interrupted and so god needs to get another thousand-year day of rest because god never got it peter said one day with the lord is as a thousand years so see satan possessed the serpent begotten eve into eating the fruit shared it with adam it plunged mankind into sin bondage but now the bondage is broken praise god there's no more bondage to say something the conditions of eden are almost restored i'll say like that almost three stones almost because we know the future holds the ultimate restoration right and so the bible is out for a thousand years church we're gonna build houses and inhabit them according to isaiah 65 we will plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them we got a bunch of those caterpillars that eat up all of our kale every year brother right don't think so we plant my wife plants all these seeds for kale we never get to eat the kale because those bugs we don't believe in spraying them except their pants are causing agents so we you know we got to have our own little garden and we plant sometimes but we don't get to eat from it but god said you'll build a house and you inhabit it praise god you will plant a vineyard and you'll eat of it no one else will live in your house or in habit but you will praise god and do the days are today my people shall all enjoy the works of their hands amen oh church more than a lifetime a lifetime is what we're blessed we get more than a lifetime we get to long enjoy the works of our hands imagine that a house that lasts a thousand years what kind of place would that be praise god and we get to enjoy it for a thousand years since that means brother we get to build houses go in and sleep in it well i don't know i'm sure we're going to sleep in the morning i have to check that i can't remember and then go out and rule the bible said rule and reign and then go back into the houses so we got time we got time to wake up you know we'll make some proclamations to the the servants right and then we got time to go out there to our vineyard check out our vineyard uh servants how the other vineyard do it how the grapes do it oh they're real big master they're like this just like in the promised land right let me know what the promise that except they'll probably be bigger than that but they'll be massive huge right huge we have time to instruct our our cities that we rule over our nations check up on our vineyards and go back in the house into our families don't have to go out we get to go out to our uh our zoos and check out how's the lion the lamb doing out here huh how you doing fellas ah come on here rub rub my leg you know i like how my cat my cat runs up and he just rubs against my leg you know a lion will rub up against the leg for a thousand years amen nothing we do will be in vain praise god hallelujah there'll be no evil thought come to our mind because the giver of those evil thoughts is chained up in the bottom of this pit praise god hallelujah there'll be no evil thoughts on how i can steal that i got to worry about being killed oh there's nothing like that it's just 1000 years one day a saturday night the beast the tabernacles these hockeys are great but they're just temporary temporary for a thousand years oh man no temper what kind of life could you live if you never got time what kind of and you'll do you won't you'll do that not just for one day but for a thousand years 365 000 days to be exact imagine our what is our calendar and all that brother should be like this thank you i gotta run about one page at about one month at a time give me the thickest calendar ever a thousand years of peace oh what a birthday party is going to be like over there bye all the joy all the all the fruitfulness my our vineyards are gonna bring forth the cows and the sheep and everything like what kind of time are we gonna have it's gonna be such a joy and we're gonna remember how god brought us out through an exodus through a rapture praise god amen thank god that we'll have an exodus so remember oh god brought us out here we are we're in a holy place for a thousand years total joy total victory a church we we we're allowed to enjoy our lives over here go to first timothy 6 17. i just want to make sure i rehearse this first timothy 6 17. sometimes i get tempted to feel bad if i'm enjoying my life because i know people are suffering but the bible says god does give us gifts to enjoy in the new testament we just have to recognize that there's times and seasons to be happy and there's times and seasons to mourn right blessed are the pure in heart right blessed are those who mourn they should be covered we mourn a lot on sunday we pray for eight sisters remember they say rich in this world that they be not minded don't trust the uncertain riches but in the living god who giveth us richly all things to church enjoy the cards he got enjoy the house you got enjoy the food you gotta enjoy your job but don't trust in it send god amen there's nothing wrong with enjoying what we've got but then when we have a need come up when you feel the holy spirit is bringing up somebody from haiti or bringing up somebody from cuba that you can help out or somebody from overseas trying to help them out by the grace of god if you can if nothing else just pray for it i started doing something last month i just started doing this by the way somebody from haiti contacted me something from uh zimbabwe whatever they asked me for all kinds of money and all in the past always i just said i can't do anything but now i'm just sending them one time love off because if i can't give them the whole thing if one guy went in one thousand eight hundred dollars like you don't even own a church another guy asked me can you give me all this money to finish our church i'm like we don't even have our own church i mean i'd like to help you but and another guy was like uh yeah can you send me money so i can get the windows for my house i'm like brother i said i can't do that i said we don't even own church we rent at church and he emailed me back a couple months later he's like oh don't worry the lord provided the funds we got the window and i said well take the phone but just a woman in haiti i'm like well i can't give you all that you want but i can give you a little offer dude it's our time it's your time i use maybe a little over a tithe of the time just to pay for what my kids need you know as they get older they get more expensive right brother you know the older they get the more things they need that's fine but i've got the money right to enjoy it but i just made this recent change if they're hearing me on the livestream i'll probably get a lot more requests in the next few weeks but then i can only get what i got you know i can't give them what they want i can only give them what i got i just been more convicted about that recently just to give a little bit so i got my i got my western union account now i got go funding account i got all these accounts just to give a little bit like give a little bit so that's that's your ties and your offerings going to help out people too but the bible says church god gives us these things to enjoy but we must not forget first corinthians 12 that the bible says when one part of the body suffers all the body should suffer right that's why we're praying you know we pray so hard for different needs that we hear our first seed either the body of christ while we pray for the sister that was sister but we're trying to enter into our suffering right during that moment brains i feel like we're suffering with her i really felt like i'm great as sincere as i could for that woman that were burning so it's like constantly back and forth right the kingdom of god you know we got joy righteousness and holy ghost right we got all these joy righteousness peace and the holy ghost you know when there's times when we're rejoining our lives and then there's times we're mourning for people that's the life of a christian and when that in that time there'll be no more the millennium there'll be no morning there a thousand years to rule and reign with christ imagine a thousand years of anything you want just before right now of course god wouldn't give us that unless he could trust us with it see he knows we wouldn't be like satan satan said well i'm going to speak a throne above the throne of god that's what satan would do but we would never want that we would just when lord help me to be faithful with what you give me let me just so see he knows we would never ask for anything selfishly it just we have something to glorify god now church finishing off this the eighth day symbolize the beginning of the eternal covenant because a is the number of a new beginning the boy was circumcised on the eighth day because he's in a new beginning a new covenant the coming of abraham right there's all these eights in the bible represent eternity or i don't i can't i don't have the number eyes i wrote in the book everyone i don't have them memorized see this eighth day speaks that time is over we've broken into the cycle of seven seven days in a week when you go to the eighth day the cycle repeated we we're we're in the repeating unending cycles of eternity amen and it's no longer permanent holmes on the eighth day i'm sorry in separate on the eighth day you went from temporary to permanent so the eighth day represents the future home coming down from heaven that's our mother we finally get reunited with mama new jerusalem praise god in other words our motherland that's what it is our motherland we get united with the motherland heaven that's where we came from the mind of christ amen amen not like a mother like a nursing mother it's a mother like that's my brother land that's where i came that's where i came right now going back to that race thank god no more temporary homes so one day after those 365 000 days are up brother william we'll close that door for the final time and say i don't know what we're doing we'll say somebody can have this home i'm going to my real home i'm taking a step higher i'm going up further up and further in praise god i'm going up further in i'm going to find a mansion with my name on it praise god he said cause i go to prepare a mansion for you praise god if it was not so i would have told you but i go to prepare a place that where i am there ye may be also amen [Music] living next and close to jesus christ amen what a privilege let me know there'll be a seat right let me see 24 that's it something else let my son sit he said well they got to be baptized with the baptism i'm not god they said the father is the only one who knows who those things come to you but then you see in heaven 24 seats so it's probably those 12 apostles there's 12 sons of jacob please god see no more temporary homes at that point we can finally say i am at rest i've made it home everything done on earth will now be done like it was always done heaven will have come down to earth what a blessing let me close with this thought i'm going to close with what in revelation 7. and i got some quotes for this one the revelation seven nine revelation 79. i don't got work tomorrow i end the chapter in the book well not the very last thing but one of the last things i end with is on the mystery of the jew gentile church god was showing i'm going to make one people make one man one temple but here in revelation 7 we actually get to see that one body together we get to see that one temple together revelation 7 9. a lot of people say it's the foolish version church there's only one quote the brother man says in the foolish version there are six quotes where brother if you look at all the evidences it's gotta be the pride verse nine after this i beheld a law of great multitude which no man can number of all nations and kids and people and tongues stood before the throne of the four of the lamb clothed with white robes and palms in their hands yeah they got they already got it right the jews didn't get himself after the white durian judgment he's already died right verse 10 and cried with a loud voice saying salvation to our god would sit upon the throne and unto the lamb and all the angels stood round about look they're sitting on the throne right that's got to be the heavenly throne and about the elders and the four reasons it's the heavenly throne sometime after the rapture and fell before the throne in their faces and worshipped god amen hallelujah thank god this has got to be the bride saying amen blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be our god forever amen and one of the elders answered them to me what are these which are raining white rose and what's came day and i said sir thou knowest and he said to me these are they which came out of great tribulation deep regulation without a great tribulation and have washed the robes and make them white in the blood of that these are people that know about the blood amen there they've been washed brother praise god they've received their atonement amen remember church the bush virgin they're not really a full partaker of the atonement are they that's what they have said anointed one to the end time they haven't fully got the atonement because they're not born again by the baptism of the holy ghost praise god but these have the atonement they got white robes on and they thank god for the blood see these are blood box saints ah verse 15 therefore are they before the throne of god and servant dave right and his temple and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them they shall hunger no more neither shall they thirst anymore neither shall the sun light on them nor any heat for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall leave them we're just going to see a sea of white there's going to be little heads and heads of all different colors you're going to have black hair out there red hair you have blonde hair out there brown hair you're just going a sea of all these beautiful colors all the white robes but the hair colors are all going to be different it's going to be like a beautiful a wildflower feel all the different colors the oh thank you jesus hallelujah it's a great multitude no man could number this multitude jesus said his word he said go preach to all nations and that word did not return void if it purchased a bride from every nation tongue kindred in people praise god his word did not return voice they're safe from every nation they are all gathered together every nation has somebody that can represent it and say i stood for christ i believe in jesus christ i washed my garbage in the blood of the land remember jesus ain't coming back to everybody every nation hears the gospel we're doing our part tonight we're letting ohio we're letting america hear the gospel praise god everybody had a chance and now look look church we're crying we're crying because maybe tears of joy but if jesus is wiping away five because we still remember some people that didn't make right you still got memory of what happened remember the jews that remembered under the fifth seal the jews remember they were martyred now they said avenge us they they can remember how they died and so we'll remember some people that didn't make it but jesus come by and said well i offered it to him i gave him every chance i said whosoever will say i said if any man is hungry if any man searches them come under me and i'll turn none i'll turn away no i wouldn't turn any way they'll say don't cry anymore just don't cry anymore you tried you labored you came out through persecution you come out through trouble but here we are now you've got white robes gone now it's time he's going to come out wipe away all the kids we're waving palms church we're loudly worshiping praising god saying hallelujah honor and glory and blessing we're worshiping jesus christ with our loud voices every skin color every hair color imaginable is there at this beautiful gathering you know my wife uh when we got married we did a you know bride has a bouquet in america they do bouquets of flowers but we we made ours with plastic flowers but it was cheaper we were really bored there's all the different colors in there and i always thought it was really interesting it's just a reminder of that great wedding day by the day where two became one here that's what jesus got that's what they're they're looking out here and it's as if god has kept his flower bouquet from the wedding day way back there on the day of pentecost amen i knew that was the day the church was born amen it's like god has kept all the bouquet of his bride of he's kept all those different uh saints from every color every nation every kinder every tongue he just looks out there on his beautiful bouquet i haven't lost the one i lost one of them praise god here they are my home my home is decorated with this bouquet sorry my wife is so inspired to keep that because god is great amen thank you jesus hallelujah jesus is one two gentile church his bride is now gathered in heaven and every seat is full remember he said make sure my house is full it's a full house it's a house full of saints from every nation every church age it wasn't easy the bible said that to make it through great tribulation remember church our persecution is more spiritual at least right now but saints under the age leading up right up to the philadelphian church that kind of changed everything it was mass murders up until about then then the bible said i'm opening a door they just started opening them but church remember all that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution and what did brother ever say what was his worst hardest times in life was being rejected at the end of his ministry by preachers out in arizona he says in what house will you build me 1965. the man said i've suffered here like i've never suffered in my life so what was the hardest time of berlin's life the very end when he had all this revelation all this truth all thus saith the lord and yet rejected nobody calling nobody knocking on his door hardly anybody wanting to hear him preach just a few isolated churches around the country so we can see church our persecution may look different but we're still being persecuted by being rejected and that way we'll know christ in the fellowship of his son i'll say it like that just as jesus was abandoned he's got to be abandoned just like jesus had to be rejected praise god in church because this here that we'll close this because this church is from every nation there's got to be some jews in there if it's every nation proving there had to be a remnant it was blind right also i wish i could be paul wasn't blinded his eyes were open and here god's permanent nation is represented and now those words are fulfilled we can see it god so loved the world he so loved the world that he sent his message around the world to get a bride out of every nation anyone that wanted to be saved could be saved and was saved six quotes 1954. though there in quotes revelation 70 says that's the bride where does mrs brown serve me at in the house that's the god quote number two 19 uh this is 1954 again a few months later program reads revelation 7 great tribulation see made fun of persecuted watch they're before the throne of god where does the queen say that's the bride and gentile bride they serve day and night my wife shows me how that's the pride of jesus that's the gentile bride 1960 the philadelphia church age he reads revelation 7 17 there there's the bride oh my how beautiful the bride number four the ten virgin there's your under now if you want to see the bride come up he says the seventh chapter he says here comes the bride what's your wife you serves you the house of god sit down and give you your food fixes it and this one all these nations the gentiles which is the bride before the throne of god number five 1964 after the seal remember in the seals he said the bullish version but before and after the seals he says bride so i'm going to get right revelation 7 after that we saw coming up coming that great number was no american number which was the the number five the church of god configuration uh either they're the gentiles they'll be only sent to the jews and the last one god is talking about the bride here this is church book you want to see it want to see another picture of the bride revelation 7 4-17 and heard the number of them read to israel then he goes to the bride the one quote from foolish virginia's in the seventh field this scene was done in the tribulation period you see they wind up over there in revelation 7 between the 6th and the 10th that she had done first she's been given the one time brother said the school's closer six times give something
