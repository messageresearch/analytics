you text austin the link i forgot to send him a link he wanted to listen into the service well you know actually i got it right here here let me yeah i'll do it i'm sorry here just forgive me saints i gotta send this link real quick all right thank you for your patience praise god hopefully our brother's able okay said he's watching okay you got it he sent me some laughing emojis so he's he's seeing me stop and text him but he's already got the link so yeah i guess that happens too so all right you can switch over i have just a few slides i want to i kind of like to update on some current events you know this week has been quite a this month rather has been quite a eventful month um i was just made known to it you know a few days ago and brother brown always told us you know uh watch that purple curtain and uh so we've been watching a few things and just to kind of uh bring us up to speed bang shared a really good one with me i'm going to share that brother van that was a really good one he saw uh in united arab emirates hopefully i'm saying that right i'm not a world traveler and my geography that i teach in first grade doesn't go to world world history or world geography so forgive me if i can't pronounce it right but uh the first one was quite shocking i don't know if you saw this on december 11th of this year the united nations unveiled this beast in new york city and this i like what this gentleman said they said the guardian for international peace and security is what the united nations is calling this monstrosity put up in front of their headquarters in new york also on their twitter account and i went on their twitter account this morning and yes they were gladly posting this beast did you see this brother bang okay i just saw ray comfort i subscribed to ray comfort you know and uh i saw it i'm like oh my goodness that looks familiar um so i have a few slides you know i mean that's uh it's actually a pretty good picture you know for what i thought i had um but one of the i like this pastor i don't know this pastor but he had a good text or a good tweet rather he said the statue resembles the beast from revelation 13. these things are done on purpose satan's behind it the u.n is finally erecting an image of defiance i just surprised it's not wearing a mask i thought that's a pretty good sense of humor don't you uh now brother brahm taught us revelation 13 2 was pagan rome i'm sorry there's always a always got to be careful there pagan and papua it's pagan rome okay because later in that chapter it morphs into papal rome remember it got a deadly wound and then it was healed the deadly wound was when pagan rome ceased and papal rome took control right through constantine and through i believe through the popes that they set up through uh it was through the uh the fourth and fifth century a.d so that's clearly laid out in the church age book it's a really uh wonderful study uh but as i've as i looked at it you know i realized it was actually a combination of two beasts it was a combination of the beast out of the the sea in revelation 13 and it's also a combination uh with the roman beast or the first beast that daniel saw in daniel chapter 7. okay so here's what i mean in in revelation 13 2 it talks about a beast he's like a leopard does that look like a leopard pretty similar right his feet were as a feet of a bear he does he did have big feet that's pretty big feet um mouth as the mouth of a lion we saw that got a big lion's mouth there um and then it ends so revelation 13 2 doesn't speak of the wings right but to find the wings you got to go back to you know daniel chapter 7. so i just thought i'd share that with you um daniel sees four beasts right and they're the four gentile kingdoms that will rule the world until the time of gentiles is over right the first the bible said was like a lion and had eagle's wings so this uh this of course was babylon this was nebuchadnezzar's rule okay and then of course the second beast come up in chapter seven i preached on them before uh bless you and so i just thought it was interesting they're combining the first roman symbols with the beasts out of the land i'm sorry the beast out of the sea rather so just interesting i thought you would uh appreciate seeing that to me it's just really striking i mean they are just getting so bold satan is getting so bold right but that makes sense as harvest time nears everyone has to show their true seed praise god how many want to show the seed of god amen that's that incorruptible seed that eternal seed of god that cannot sin praise god the baptism of the holy ghost in your soul hallelujah but they're getting so bold so that shows us if they're getting more bold than then obviously we are too like like people have been texting me all week this month or all month your videos are getting so bold your sermons are getting so bold i said well that makes sense we're supposed to come to seed praise god we're supposed to come to maturity we're supposed to come to the spot where we're bowing to the sun in everything amen we're obedient to the sun in all things praise god so it just it fits and of course this is just a uh this is a just a larger picture you can kind of see you know how it's a combination of those beasts and they say that's a symbol of unity that's a symbol of war right and they're going to have their war right they're going to try to they're going to try to kill the bride but jesus is going to rescue the bride amen and then they're going to take they're going to defeat anyone who won't take the mark of the beast and then that will turn against the jews as well they will try to destroy all the jews but thank god jesus comes to rescue them as well thank god for his mercy praise god so that was the first one and and just noticed too with the coronavirus you know jesus said men's hearts will be failing them for fear so just getting back to the omicron or delta variant whatever the variants are jesus said pestilences are going to come they've we've had the potato famines remember the potato famines in england they had them hundreds of years ago i mean jesus christ prophesied all these things and through coronavirus now we can see how this was going to be a major part of the end time events right we're still going to have more earthquakes and diverse places that's been going on for hundreds of years of course we know they're increased you know as as the the rapture is approaching but we just must remember that church never let our hearts be overcharged with fear god does not give the spirit of fear but of the power of love and a sound mind praise god uh so let's just you know let's just always aim to play or to place our hearts on the love of god that god loves me and god is for me and god is not against me and anything that happens in my life he allowed it to come to pass and i can trust him with my life and all the good things uh that he that he started in my life he will bring to a fruition uh like brother man said in the church age book he might allow me to have great blessings all my life or you or someone else but he might allow others to suffer more he like he allowed brother ram to suffer in a car accident at the end of his life or suffer with that stomach condition every seven years and how paul suffered with blindness you know uh off and on sight trouble you know god is going to allow he may commit some of us to the grave he may commit some of us you know to uh to three weeks in the hospital with covent brother you know just awful things that we would not want anyone to experience difficult times losing loved ones you know uh unexpectedly unexpected deaths you know all things that are are just are just so so awful to us but we must must remember that god has a great plan for our lives and if anyone is fair in this universe it is god almighty if anyone is just if anyone is righteous if anyone knows what they're doing in this universe it's jesus christ and he is our god amen and he has made us kings and priests unto god so we learn church as time goes on we learn to trust in the living god who the bible says he's without variableness he doesn't favor one nation above the other uh he doesn't favor one family because your last name over another family like the branham family or any other family you can name after that god doesn't favor any families amen god is faithful and he's righteous and he's just and our desire is to serve god and to give god thanks in the midst of all that he and his wisdom has allowed to come to pass amen hallelujah remember church suffering produces obedience suffering produces obedience last time i was sick i would just i couldn't do hardly do anything so i just said lord if you heal me i'm going to come out there and i'm going to preach harder than i ever have i'm going to make more videos than i ever have and i have so that taught me to redeem the time amen because look at this you know look at this we don't we don't want to we don't want to forget we don't want to waste our time now we want to make the most of our time now that we see these things happening right they're getting so bold to make uh their uh their powers known right and you know even the article said that they got this from uh the aztecs the united nations got this from the aztecs who were murderers and they had a they had a shrine as big as a football field a field filled with human skulls and that's their inspiration for unity and protection yeah they're going to guard they're going to guard satan's kingdom is what they're going to guard right they're not guarding god's kingdom so you always look at the inspiration behind something okay so now this is one i found yesterday uh pope francis christmas mass come god comes into the world in littleness now he's got that right but there he is kissing a statue so just another reminder about the idolatry he's kissing a baby porcelain or whatever clay statue they worship those things uh and he's right in one aspect but then he's a million miles wrong on the other so we just watch these people watch them now here's the one vang shared with me now van there there may be two i may have missed one of yours but this one there's an abrahamic family house in abu i'm no i know i'm saying this wrong abu dhabi okay i'm trying to pronounce that right and it's going to go up in 2022 so there it is united arab emirates okay just cause i i don't i could not have found it unless i looked on google maps because i'm not really good with my geography okay so there's israel and location to it you know you can see where so they have three buildings and then what it's going to be is this and it's supposed to open next year if you have a house for muslims you have a house for christians and a house for jews all together in one location there so we can obviously see the one world government clearly issuing in and letting us know which spirit is behind them it's the roman spirit and if you go back to that article it says the pope was he was one of the main contributors to make this a reality well that sounds right doesn't it he's going to sit in the temple of god saying that he is god now which of these temples i don't know it might be the jewish temple too right might be the third temple when they rebuild that so we're watching and praying how many watching and praying for the coming of the lord you know every year we hear a preacher say oh he's gonna god's gonna come back this year right and every year it's the next year and every year is the next year we've learned not to do that we've learned to just watch and pray and be stable and be solid like a rock and not make foolish predictions for no man knows the day or the hour but as we see these things we're aware of them and we we just we let it cause us to be more watchful and prayerful in our daily lives uh so the last one was this i saw that one yesterday i just i was i was scrolling looking for a video i was looking for one and but this one came out i thought oh my i even subscribed to them of course i subscribe to them because i'm keeping my eye on the purple curtain the catholic news service mary this woman says marrying is a mary is appearing to her in italy it's about 30 miles from rome and every every week hundreds of people flock to this shrine of mary and this woman sees apparently sees mary writes down what she's saying and then tells the people about it and her message from mary was there's now let's listen her message from mary was there's a great tribulation coming and please pray to me so people can be saved from it now isn't that look how close that is we know the tribulation's coming but we know we're not supposed to pray to mary because that's spiritualism that's interacting with devils so see how close it would be it seems like it's so nice pray pray for souls to be saved but yet it has idolatry completely woven into it and the whole time she's there she's praying the prayer beads you know you can watch it's a three minute video i mean i watch it this morning uh but just again you know and people are flocking there and the uh the priests are investigating it saying here's another apparition and this this possibly could be god visiting us and we know it's not god visiting us that's why you got to watch that jesus calling book too right and all those uh any of those people that say they hear from god kenneth copeland we i mean we preached it last year remember all these people that say they hear from god a tree is known by its fruit any fruit that says pray to mary or pray to the dead is a fruit of satan it's a corrupt fruit so just you know i just thought i'd share those four or five things there was that was that helpful by god's grace and i like when vayne i like when you share those with i like when everybody shares those with me let's keep our eyes open praise god let's not fall asleep at this hour it's kind of it's slowly bringing to head and we know the coronavirus and the vaccine vaccine mandates it's just a prefigure to the mark of the beast right mandates it's just a prefigure where they're going to mandate worship with us or you cannot buy or sell but brother man tells us christ will rescue the bride right before the mark is laid down so we're trusting in that by god's grace so let's look here uh i would like to get to this here and i'll just let me set my timer for just 45 more minutes i probably went 15 minutes on there i'll try to preach an hour uh lord willing uh so well let's uh we've enjoyed this uh joshua series i was telling brother amen that this has really been a huge blessing to me it's been a help to me to it really showed me that i was possessing god's promises and that god was with me for no man or woman has been able to cause me to stumble all the days of my life in other words every battle we face church every battle you face i face we will be victorious somehow or another we may stumble we may you know we may sin and fall short of the glory of god but if we humble ourselves and get back up and fight god is going to fight for us remember just like jericho some battles god fights all by himself you just got to praise god you just got to shout amen other battles like when they defeated all those kings the five kings that were attacking the gimme knights god let them have a part in the ambush amen god let them hold the sword of the word of god and fight off the enemies amen so there's different kinds of battles but god is going to be with us all throughout 2022 as well should he tarry praise god for god cannot fail amen and he loves his children now we're going to finish up this book hopefully in the next month or so this is part 35. we're going to look at chapter 21 and we may get to chapter 22 today uh chapter 21 we looked at the levites a few weeks ago and brother brooks was here last sunday um and we're look we're finishing up with god's faithfulness to israel and how the levites got their own cities of refuge next chapter is joshua's words to the tribes on the east of jordan the two and half tribes and then the confusion when they built an altar to the lord so praise god all right so let's finish joshua chapter 21. let's look again a little bit at god's faithfulness praise god how many glad he's faithful amen now remember church that joshua he writes this in joshua 21 and god has already been faithful to him around 110 years imagine that living over a hundred years and you can look back at the entire span of your life and say god you were faithful to me when i was in egypt amen hallelujah god you were faithful to me when i was a sinner god you were faithful to me when i got justified and come out of egypt amen you were faithful to me as i wandered around in sanctification praise god and you were faithful to me when you took me into the promised land with a mighty hand and once i got in the holy ghost that's when the battle started amen amen and since i've been in the holy ghost jesus you've been faithful to me all 31 kings all the enemies have fallen before you because you're the conqueror you're the mighty warrior amen hallelujah so he looks back after 31 years in the baptism of the holy ghost and he says these beautiful words he says lord he said you've given me rest round about and no man should before me remember chapter 1 god tells joshua no man will stand before you all the days of your life the only time they fail was when they didn't pray they tried to go up to ai and not pray about it and joshua learned the lesson you got to pray before every battle you got to pray every morning you got to pray for every service you got to pray every day of your life amen especially when you're going into a battle praise god and god delivered all their enemies into their hand god's word never failed think of that god's word never failed now if god didn't fail them under the old testament of blood of bulls and goats what about you and i under the blood of christ god will not fail us either so if we seem disappointed the thing to do is let the word of god wash away our disappointment or maybe clean off our little lenses praise god and just help us to see more clearly or maybe look the other way look to jesus amen change our perspective and realize god allowed it and god's with me he's helping me he's making me a stronger christian he's making me more than a conqueror and i needed this trial so i could be a better christian hallelujah amen that's right like i think all of us got covered so we could tell austin it's going to be okay so he's probably streaming right now because he he admitted he told me that was one of his major battles and i agree i was when i got first got i was afraid too but after three days i was good thank you thanks to my wife for thanks to my wife nursing me back to health and jesus healed my body praise god and so see you know we think why would we go through these things well it's part of prophecy the pestilences have to come but also god has to manifest he's a healer amen and then also so you can testify that i've gone through this and i've overcome it and god was with me and god healed me and now i can testify because i overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of my testimony amen that's how i overcome the devil amen you got to testify about it we got to testify about the grace of god amen that's how we overcome i mean it'd be a great test it wouldn't be great if you say well i never got covered all those years of covert that'd be a nice testimony that'd be wonderful but then what about all the other spiritual people are you saying you're more spiritual that could lead to pride amen so see we've got to be thankful that if god's allowed it god's going to bring us through we can still say god's word never fail me god is the author and finisher of our faith he started us he saved us he the bible said he led us to repentance through the goodness of god amen the goodness of god leads us to repentance and it'll be his goodness that leads us all the way home that's right now i just had a few thoughts up here um and there you know i didn't have a whole lot of time to organize yesterday was more when i studied it was more of like a bible research day i didn't have time to like present it real nice format so you just kind of have to live with my notes or i can just go back so you don't have to look at it how about that we'll just go back and i'll just have it on here uh you know in philippians 1 verse 6 that says whatever god started in your life he's gonna finish as long as you let him praise god god will not override your free more agency but as long as you when you fail you say jesus forgive me try me again let me be stronger this time i don't want to fail again then god is going to finish what he started amen he's faithful but as i said as i ended the service the last time i just said it briefly we have to be careful that every promise of god uh that that we're claiming is a divine promise to us and it's gonna be fulfilled in its time in season so i put some examples on here you know when we first come in the message there's numerous people they don't go to this church you know but they said i claim that person as my husband or i claim that person as my wife right and they and then they could have said well we sing that song every promise in the book is mine right they could have said they could have said that now we love those people i would never name them or anything like that but it's an idea where we think when we want something we think god wants wants it for us as well and we think just because we're serving god we deserve this but god is greater than our thinking god god's ways are higher than our ways so in both cases the lord allowed those other people to not be interested in them and married other people i believe and and then they married people now they're very happy both people are very very happy and we're still in good fellowship and you know both of them amen uh and i'm not saying i've never done that i'm sure i've claimed something before or maybe it didn't come to pass right we've all been guilty of that but we've got to be careful even when we read that joshua scripture see some people might be tempted by the devil to say well god failed me god no when the god didn't fail you god was trying to correct you amen right if you wanted something and god didn't give it to you god was trying to correct you and give you something better praise god because his ways are always better than our ways amen like riches well i don't even i wanted to be more rich well how do you know it's god's promise to make you rich you don't know that i've had brothers you know when we first come in the message say i'm going to live to be in the rapture and they passed away they were claiming that promise was there think about that they said god gave me a revelation i remember that brother told me that well actually this brother's still alive he's been married twice and all these things you know uh with living spouses so he's an adulterer in the eyes of god but yeah he told me he's got the revelation he's going to not die to see the rapture i said well i said time's going to show it brother and he was a church splitter and all these things i mean just the fruits of his life were not there but he says he has a revelation we must be careful what we say is a revelation praise god how about the number of children rachel only had two right and they all were weren't they no that was rebecca they're all blessing her like you're gonna have to be a mother of millions and millions and they say that of course they met you know uh natural beyond generations right generations and generations uh but rachel had two yet she was with leah in the word of god that said those two built the house of israel praise god amen some people guarantee their healing but what about paul's thorn so we know it's not always god's promise to heal you when you want to be healed amen right even all children being saved what about esau see we have to be careful to apply the promise of god in other words let's not say god said something unless he said it to us now what does that require a lot of humility right but most times people boasting and saying well god told me and i'm they're exalting themselves trying to make themselves more spiritual right but real spirituality is honesty humility that's real spirituality praise god not boasting and bragging right so we must see god's will for every situation and remember church god though there is a couple promises god desires for everybody and that's to be saved and that's to be filled with the holy ghost amen praise god amen i'm just going to read it i don't have it up here let's go to john 7 if you got your bibles john 7 37. jesus christ in red letter words i'm sorry these aren't red letter uh it was john's words no i'm sorry yeah they were red letter words yeah john 7 37 sorry i was looking at the wrong piece of the page in the last day that great day of the feast jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirsts let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water amen that ought to be exciting for all the young people because when you're young sin only comes out of our bellies right a child's full of days or a young child is born and full of days he's full of trouble hallelujah oh that ought to be exciting for the young people say lord jesus forgive me of my sins let living water flow out of my belly amen amen let me say good things let me say blessings and not curses amen i was thinking about that this morning for some reason the thought about teasing came to me i was walking in my bathroom and coming out and studying and all of a sudden that this thought just came to me about teasing you know when people tease when people tease it actually means they're the ones that are weak right because they try to make others feel bad because they feel bad right so they're the ones when they attack others they're the ones that are being attacked praise god they're the ones that are in bondage to a spirit my children how many times you heard me tease you about something lydia how many zero good amen hallelujah sir god's helping me by his grace and you're the oldest tube so but that just thought came to me this morning i said i need to someone said like tell that to the young people this morning young people should always build up each other not tear down but build up praise god amen remember when nehemiah was building the wall what those tobias come around to come around to tease them oh if a fox jumped on your wall it'll fall down friends let's not tease one another let's build one another up praise god amen hallelujah let's strengthen one another let's let's make a let's make the battle easier for them to fight amen let's come around and fight for them not against them amen amen hallelujah that just struck me there verse 39 but this fake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the holy ghost was not yet given because that jesus was not yet glorified all those beautiful words if any man thirsts if any man wants water flowing out of his belly amen if any man wants eternal life come and drink any man hallelujah so see there are some promises this will not fail anyone that wants the holy ghost can get the holy ghost the thing is with serpent seed god knows by four knowledge they just don't want it right but they have the opportunity and they have the invitation judas just missed it by what was it 50 days i mean he barely missed it he missed it by less than two months if he would have just kept pressing on and believing the promise of god but we know he desired money and transgression more than obedience god help us to love obedience the good solid the simple word of god that will obey every command of god amen go to revelation 22. i'm not going to give you one witness i'm going to give you two witnesses because in the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established revelation 22. it's verse yup verse 17. sorry it took me a little while to find that and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take of the water of life freely see god's word for this day is come to the fountain come to the waters come and drink they're delicious come and drink their living waters the invitation is any man who wants to drink come and drink of the water of life freely we will not keep you away from those waters we'll encourage you we'll push you to those waters amen hallelujah like brother nessa they used to pat you on the back till you got bored again they're like pushing them to the water you don't have to do that praise god but you could do that amen but the thing to do is encourage them invite them come to the water come and repent come and be filled with the holy ghost there's eternal life that will flow outside of you amen you'll see it flow out of you praise god like did i tell you when austin came the first sunday three sundays ago i picked him up and he got in the car with lena he said brother he said can you show us how to pray i looked over and i smiled at him because right before i left i felt let the lord i said i felt just about the holy spirit say teach austin how to pray so i typed out how to pray i gave the scripture and i had the two papers sitting up there on my on my dash i said hey brother how you doing he said hey can you teach us how to pray i said yeah i'm gonna teach you how to pray i slipped over he said whoa dude he's like yeah austin's probably laughing now that was a discernment he said because they spent the whole morning talking about how to pray and he come to church that day everybody almost everybody's out with kovad and he said when i prayed for him he felt the fire of god the sanctifying fire of god start at his waist and come up through his body and then the next week when he was tested by anger he said he didn't even give in to anger he overcame anger by the sanctifying powers of the holy spirit amen hallelujah praise god amen see that's the whole that's gifts working among us amen discernment's working among us healing's working among us praise god all these things are among us if we just get into with the spirit amen so what was it life was flown out of me glory just like it flows out of you praise god when you speak the word and you help somebody or god uses you it's living water flowing out and it brings refreshment amen hallelujah praise god say church we gotta we just gotta just continue on with the grace of god we're gonna get the victory praise god hallelujah so there's scriptural proof any person in here today can be baptized with the holy ghost for because it's for any man amen any woman any man the invitation is to all that's a promise you can take to the bank even if you live 60 years you can or at your 70 years you can say if you don't have the holy ghost you can say lord you said any man i know if i die tomorrow i'm going to get it today amen you can because it's any any person praise god and god will not fail his word nothing no devil can stand before a believer all the days of his life amen glory just like i promised both of you you get the holy ghost right i said if you if you obey you'll get the holy ghost and they got the holy ghost hallelujah is that right praise god it's a promise if you want it you can have the gift how many christmas gifts did people get yesterday they just probably they're going to re-gift that one well if you don't want the gift you're not going to get it right you're not going to keep it but if you want the gift of the holy ghost god's going to let you keep it amen amen just don't despise it just don't throw it away keep it hang on to it with all your heart amen don't let any devil take your fingers off that gift just say thank you for that gift lord i know it's my it's gonna produce in my life amen i'll be forever grateful for this gift amen hallelujah glory we want to be like those kids we gave them the gift on friday night for christmas service and they instantly started playing with them as soon as they got out there that's what we got to get that gift i'm instantly i know i got it praise god i'm going to worship god i'm going to declare the wonderful works of god amen i'm going to see what's inside this gift right here praise god i'm going to enjoy everything in this gift this gift is glorious i'm going to put this to you say man hallelujah praise god put the gift to use amen i was getting nervous because i always get so many gift cards at christmas time so i'm like nervous i got to go spend them i don't want to lose them that's how you should be with the holy ghost i don't know how many days i'm going to be here so i'm going to use it while i got it praise god i don't know how many years so i'd be here i don't know how long i lived but one thing's for sure i'm going to appreciate god's gift and i'm going to let people know he gave me a gift amen hallelujah praise god that's why we say when you're sick come on up here let's use some of these gifts let's enjoy this gift that we're given praise god hallelujah now i want to finish this thought here in chapter 21. the levites remember were not given a portion like the other tribes so let me say like this all the other tribes had rivers remember uh caleb's daughter had those springs remember that she said daddy give me some springs and you know dads you're gonna give your daughter whatever she wants within reason she had springs she had fountains of water all the other tribes had mountains a seaside fishing industry oil under their feet they could get the oils they could get the oil from the olive trees everybody had great agricultural blessings except the levites all they had was a house and land for their cattle everybody else would come to church talking like oh my we drank from the spring this was a beautiful spring we put up all these new houses we went hiking up there on our hills i got 300 acres it was glorious brother jesse everybody else would come but the levites they didn't have all that they had one focus and their focus was on the house of the lord now i see a beautiful type in here because levites had very little of the world while all the other christians in the promised land holy ghostfield christians now they had lots of external blessings but the levites had very little and god ordained that praise god god ordained them to be more poor and not as rich and wealthy as the other so they could minister before the lord and minister for others amen how many can understand that by god's grace i'm going to skip ahead now to this what does the bible say the most spiritual people are usually the poorest people i can only think of a handful of rich people that were spiritual abraham solomon but solomon it ruined him abraham it didn't and the bible said most rich people can't be saved jesus said a rich man can hardly pass through i have a needle right and get to heaven but look what the bible says you have now the bible james said they were respecting people that wear expensive clothing and they would give them the better seats in the church he says are you not then partial in yourselves and become judges of evil thoughts so it's an evil thought to say i'm going to treat the rich person better than the poor person and naomi and beatrice know exactly what we're talking about right because they used to go to churches that the rich people would not talk to the poor i'm so glad church that it don't matter how much you make here you're just a child of god and you're loved and we want a fellowship with you and we want to help you out by god's grace we should have all things in common right but the bible says you you obtain evil thoughts when you start treating others better because they're more rich and he uh james says in verse 5 hath not god who did god choose the poor or the rich poor brother vang hallelujah has he chosen the poor of this world who are rich in faith now how come you don't hear that across pulpits because they want the people and the rich people in their church they can have bigger buildings and bigger ministries and bigger everything and bigger incomes is what they wanted how come you don't hear that preach because they're not led of the holy spirit on those topics and they got to humble themselves and be led by the holy spirit on the word of god amen so the poor of this world so don't feel bad if you're poor don't feel bad actually be encouraged because you know you're richer in faith and god has made you an heir of the kingdom which he promised because he loves you amen hallelujah jesus said foxes have holes birds have a nest but the son of man doesn't even have a place to lay his head amen so don't feel bad if you don't have a mortgage you probably you maybe don't want one let me just i can advise you on that maybe you don't want one i rushed into one that was the biggest mistake when i bought that house in chicago falls that's the biggest mistake i ever made rushed into it rush i had to get a new car you know i had to get a new i had to get a house those are some of the biggest mistakes ever made now god is merciful he works with us in our mistakes but god says the poor of this world are generally richer in faith but see even christians in the early church were despising the poor and he said well who's the one that mistreats you the rich people because they know they got lawyers that can they can sue you right they know they can call their lawyer and they'll sue you or they'll they'll do whatever they can they'll take from you whatever they can and the the bible says god chooses the poor of this world that's god's choice let's all say god's choice can we god's choice that's god's choice so see these levites were not rich by standards of the other tribes but they were rich in faith they were rich in ministry praise god some of them brother amen could walk around and they weren't saying wow look i have a new fountain they say wow the priest could say i was in the presence of the shekinah glory today amen if it's a day of atonement today i saw the savior amen i saw the holy ghost he spoke to me from off the mercy seat praise god what a blessing nobody else can say that how rich they were it was only a chosen people that could experience the presence of god amen amen so if you have little this world don't worry you have great things in the kingdom of god as long as you're rich in faith because remember brother man said penny heirs can go to hell too millionaires can go to hell penny heirs can go to hell it's all about your attitude towards it so don't feel bad if other people get riches get more possessions let's be like john wesley let's see how much you can save let's see how much you can give let's see how much what do you say save give what's the other one remember lydia okay well if you don't remember i know i'm not gonna remember like we looked at last week remember we looked at oral roberts last week look at the look at the legacy of william branham versus oral roberts now i know everybody talks about other brands that's because they don't study his messages they don't even they just say a few oh there's a few strange doctrines he must be a fault that's ridiculous they've never listened to it they've never studied it but look at the legacy brother i'm a humble uh minister has started a worldwide healing revival that's still going on today i got the book in there i got the encyclopedia it says that any any church that's basically preaching divine healing is a result of god's prophet amen hallelujah and look at oral roberts remember brother i was there looking at oral roberts building he said i must not be very good i must not handle money and the voice said don't feel sad i'm your portion hallelujah don't feel bad about that eight million dollar building that's not your inheritance i'm your inheritance amen and remember the brother uh got the the tongues interpretation a great portion of heaven not of earth amen not a great portion of a university amen or a great portion of a board of trustees or something like that but a great portion of heaven divine heaven blessings amen memorials in heaven awaits for a real sermon of god amen and look what happened to him now he's known for being the preacher who said god's going to kill me if you don't give me 8 million and he's a preacher that raised millions of dollars to build a hospital he said god was going to use and it only lasted a few years that's what his legacy is and look church look how money so often corrupts and the church said watch out corrupts that's why i'm glad brother ray hernandez told us that word of the lord a couple years ago i was so discouraged why are we so small and he said brother on a wednesday night he said brother jesse i've got a word of the lord from you and i was like what are you sure i love you brother ray but what are you talking about here he said god told me to tell you i'm keeping you small to protect you and your family and he said as a vindication he said go talk to lydia i'm like whoa but and uh tell her or ask her if she's always wanted a youth group so i said okay brother ray you always got to be cautious with the word of the lord you know i was okay and i went and talked to him right out there and i talked to lydia in here and lydia was sitting right there and started crying brother ray said don't feel bad he said i know many young people even close to me that they're in bigger youth groups and they get mistreated by other kids in the youth group and he gave me some personal testimonies from his own experience where young people young brothers in the message were mistreating sisters and it made their lives torment in other words these these men that were in the message these young teenagers they weren't really in the message because the message wasn't in them any young man that would mistreat a young lady he's got devils he's given a place to the devil the bible said because fear had torment praise god and these brothers are causing torment in teenage girls or young ladies what is that that's a devil that's got on that man to mistreat us if we can keep getting back to that teasing thing right to mistreat them so i said i said oh thank you lord after that i said so thank you god protect me do whatever you can protect my children amen protect me and i can serve you keep my eyes focused on you and that's your mercy your hedge will be around about me praise god and that don't make me disappointed that makes me love god more praise god because god's a god of variety we can't all be the same we don't all look the same right you got different hair than i got we all got different smiles we all got different statures right some are whiter some are thinner some are taller god loves variety praise god so i want to be what god made me to be so the levites could only be what god made them to be they wouldn't they might have looked out there and say my really like one day to have some fountains oh that'd be awesome dad dad wouldn't you son darling that just wasn't it wasn't our portion anything we forsake here god will make to us over there god will make up anything that we felt like we uh we should have had god will make it up to us and don't forget son god is our portion amen god's our inheritance amen hallelujah i just think that's beautiful now this is a lot i'm not going to read all this but paul says godliness with contentment's great gain because we didn't bring anything into the world you didn't bring those mountains and those 300 acres into the world so you ain't taking it with you praise god right be content with closing food because the rich are often in temptations and snares very rarely do you find a rich man who can really handle the temptations of money very rarely the bible says so the bible said flee all these things and fight glory amen that's what we need today we need some joshua fighters amen that will fight off temptations and snares from the enemy are trying to steal their faith or make them depart from the faith we need fighters who handle the sword of the word we need we need runners amen who run to the cities of refuge amen when they hear satan's after them and trying to get them with temptation we need runners spiritual runners that will run to jesus christ brother and said the cities of refuge are jesus christ amen paul is saying timothy run run to the city of refuge run to your refuge run to your portion jesus christ amen amen hallelujah don't worry about tomorrow tomorrow worry about itself worry about today not worry but put god first today and watch god take care of tomorrow like i told you that testimony how that company gave us a brand new kitchen last year right i talked to that the same man this week and he said since that moment where he helped us out he saved us i'm not gonna say the number of thousand dollars he saved us but it's pretty high he said since that time their business has boomed 500 percent hallelujah god knows how to do it church right five can you imagine i see some of your minds blowing right now what if your income went up 500 percent and i love it this man is so humble he didn't go to church but he's a humble man and he he heard the voice of god to bless our family because he know god knows i'm not a not a construction man i'm a preacher amen i i'm building a spiritual thing going on amen i'm building a spiritual house amen i could do some of that i did a little bit with my brothers and but god has a different calling for me but imagine 500 percent god blesses your business all because you honored his voice and he said he tithed on all the money god gave his company and now he's at 500 percent he said i just need people to hire because we're just bursting at the seams with all these jobs that sounds like a and god did that after three years of make that three years they made no money the fourth year they helped us there's four's deliverance there it is amen hallelujah now they're going to their fifth with 500 percent bigger than they were church god knows how to bless you amen those goodness those those blessings are running after me church they're running after you just always put god first amen make god your portion seek god and everything else will be added unto you praise god don't worry if you're just rich or poor in this world you'll be rich in faith hallelujah amen don't let riches fool you they almost always fool all these message believers thinking money is the answer money is not he says it right there anyone that says gain is godliness just because you get more money or a bigger church or something the bi that doesn't mean you're more godly what's more godly is running from temptation amen now some can handle it right some can handle like abraham he can handle the money that's because he was a friend of god amen see rich people usually make money their friend or the lawyers their friends right more than god being their friend i'll move on now let's uh look at a little bit of chapter 22. get your bibles here let's do a few uh verses in here i still got about i still got a few minutes there joshua 22. let's go to verse 4. the beginning of this chapter churches is joshua uh encouraging the two and a half tribes on the east of jordan and i just want to pull out a few scriptures just to encourage you remember this is after 31 years can you imagine that 31 years of being a holy ghost-filled saint fighting every battle brother bang all the battles that come the financial ones the pride ones the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh all these 31 years of battling and you get to the end and here's what joshua tells them praise god verse 4 and now the lord your god hath given rest unto your brethren as he has promised them therefore now return ye and get you unto your tents and unto the land of your possession which moses the servant of the lord gave you on the other side of jordan so god gave them rest they had to fight and labor for 31 years at least joshua did and after 31 years they can calm down and say thank you lord for the rest that i'm enjoying let's not be discouraged if we feel like we're in battles let's not be discouraged some battles last longer than others some battles will last years some will last decades but the thing to do is keep fighting keep battling keep taking possession don't give up don't quit because god is with you and god wants you to possess something maybe it's your bad habits or maybe it's your maybe maybe it's a temper right maybe it's a lust of the flesh lust of the eyes god wants you to possess that channel amen amen i want you to possess that gate so the devil can't get in and the devil's kept out praise god god's anointing is kept in and satan's kept out hallelujah now remember church the bible said god gave the saints rest in acts 9 31 after paul got converted see god has a way to do it some of those people that are against you let them get converted amen hallelujah then you're going to rest that's what happened with cam right cam tormented us well i shouldn't say torment we came he's talked about himself here you know he was just against us argue with us for a whole year and then god brought him in and then we had rest for a while hallelujah and that's a beautiful testimony that god brought him in it's beautiful because i can say it like this i thought in other words i fought holiness for all those years of my life too i was fighting i remember i used to make fun of christians in high school shame on me for that and i went back and apologized after i got saved and now one of them is a homosexual i'm encouraging i totally get out of that we still text from time to time i made fun of him but i apologize i said now i'm on jesus side amen god had mercy on me even down in egypt god had mercy on me praise god but see god has seasons for our rest and remember the main rest is in your soul jesus said come unto me all ye that labor and are weary heavy laden i'll give you rest unto your soul but the bible says in hebrews 4 10 11 labor to enter into that labor rest other words give all your diligence give all your strength give all your attention amen put away any distraction that's not the word of god and focus on the word of god amen i encourage all of our young people to do that praise god as they get closer to the baptism holy ghost they're going to see more and more fall away because the bible said god gives the holy ghost to them that obey him in acts 5 32. that's not old testament that's new testament god wants a person cleaned out so he can fill them and use them praise god amen look at verse 5 okay he says but take diligent heed to do the commandment of the law which moses is serving the lord your god uh to to love the lord your god to walk in all of his ways and to keep his commandments and cleave unto him and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul there are one two three four five six seven times paul and peter tell us to be diligent christians and that's a message a lot of message churches don't like because a lot of them are lazy a lot of them don't pray a lot of them are overweight a lot of them are disinterested in praying for the government or disinterested in anything anything that caused them to do something other than go to church they're against it that's because they're lazy that's because they're lukewarm praise god you have to tell me you have to say man because i've seen it i've talked to them where they say i won't fast i couldn't fast and then they got diabetes later well what happened they weren't diligent with the word of god they made food they made their belly their god instead of god amen i know i remember i preached a few weeks ago the bible said their god was their belly you know we could use some rebukes and criticism in the word of god can we god said the bible said in hebrews 12 every son that comes to god must be chastened amen and the reason i'm preaching is because god had the chase of me on it i'm not free from chastisement none of us are free from chastisement we've all got to be chastened if we're sons and daughters god brings us all the same way amen amen he says in romans 12 8 2 corinthians 8 7 2 timothy 4 9 2 timothy 4 21 hebrews 6 11 2 peter 1 5 and 2 peter 1 10. giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge amen can i say it like this give all diligence church and add the anointing of god to 2022 amen glory you might have been anointed for 2021 but let me tell you you can't live off of that you need more anointing amen in other words what i mean is you need a renewed mind every single day because the end the trials get harder the enemy keeps coming in and you need to raise a standard and say i'm not going to bow to this i'm going to fight this let's go fight in the name of jesus amen hallelujah add to it be diligent pray read your bible give alms amen be a real sincere christian and god will bless you what's his word to these guys diligence diligence and love there it is right there amen paul said faith works by so now the faith works debate is now solved church it's all by one scripture galatians 5 6. in that austin we could solve that that whole debate to this morning isn't that great we could solve that faith works by love in other words the order is love faith works if we take that approach to god we're going to do god's works because they're all based upon love you've got to start with love and joshua the holy ghost amen the holy ghost said be diligent and love god with all you have amen oh glory i know usually i get louder as i preach and everybody else gets quieter you know because i start off real quite humble then i get really and you guys start real loud and we get quiet we're kind of opposites that completes us right there as a body of believers hallelujah so i'm trying to bring this down here give me about 15 minutes here let me set timer now beginning in verse actually yeah well i'm sorry in verse 8 joshua says god has blessed you with money and clothes and houses and lands so he said be diligent and love god with all your hearts how many can say lord i love you thank you for blessing me with the job i have the cars the land the the home how many could say amen to that amen that's what i want to say so i feel like joshua the holy ghost is talking me today jesse be thankful but be diligent to always love the lord your god with all your heart soul mind and strength for by this love you'll overcome hallelujah now the rest of the chapter verse 10 all the way down to the end deals with this strange situation where these two and a half tribes go back to their land and the first thing they do is build up an altar the bible said it's a massive altar and word gets back to the other tribes and the nine and a half tribes on the other side these guys have built an altar look at verse 11. joshua 22 11. and the children of israel heard say behold the children of reuben and children of god and the half tribe of manasseh have built an altar over against the land of canaan and their borders of jordan at the passage of the children of israel and when the children of israel heard it the whole congregation of children of israel gathered themselves together at shiloh to go up to war against them now some people might criticize this but i like this i don't know about you i like this idea how you hear about your brethren building an altar and they didn't tell you about it and they weren't commissioned by god to do it and so they said if my brother is in idolatry let's go fight that devil and notice i didn't say fight that brother and the church said amen i'd say fight the brother i said let's go try to correct that brother they built this altar in their life i like that when they see sin they want to take care of it praise god god help us amen to take care of sins we see amongst one another to pray for them right and go to them if you have questions or concerns about our lives it'd be better than gossiping right it'd be better than ignoring it right church the best thing to do is pray about it and then go to the person like brother man i said the pastor doesn't always have to do those kind of things the bible says spiritual people can go to someone who sinned and tried to bring correction to them but they got to remain humble they got to be meek so the bible says the spirit that's on the center or the backside or won't come on the person who's going to do the correction so they come in verse 16 we don't have time to read at all but they say what is this rebellion and can you imagine there they got all these armies behind them but they got all the armies of the nine half tribes ready to fight what is this rebellion why are you building altars that was not sanctioned by god they said what trash is this in verse 16 what rebellion is this and in verse 19 they say if if that side is so unclean and you're already into idolatry why don't you come over the jordan that's what i say praise god why aren't those foolish virgins that set up idols why don't they come over and get the baptism of the holy ghost amen once they leave their denomination brother bang we beg them for years once they leave their denomination and come to the real baptism of the holy ghost that gives you a love for holiness gives you a holy man's taste glory well all you do is keep begging and praise god all you do is keep asking all we can do is keep offering it praise god in verse 20 they say don't you remember aiken did this aiken didn't build an altar church how did achan build this well aiken did a similar sin ache and looked and saw the wedge the gold and the garments and he said i'm going to take that into my house i'm going to bury that in my house so we get this truth that no matter whether you build a big public altar of defiance or if you bury sin in your life and it's secret sin god still sees it i said god still sees it amen god still sees it whether it's some big public shame on facebook or instagram or whatever you're on or some private sin god sees it and it will hinder the church of the living god that's right so the suggestion is don't let sin in your life don't do secret sin and don't do public sin amen hallelujah praise god aiken is the example don't be like aiken how could you be like aiken we're going to be destro you're going to be destroyed well i'm not sure if you know this part of the story but in verse 24 the other side that built the altar starts explaining why they built it and the purpose was not to get into idolatry the purpose was to have a witness that they had a part with god because they said in the years to come when all this generation dies away the children on the west of jordan will say well you're not a part of us because jordan is the boundary and so we want to witness on our side that shows that we have a portion with god almighty and you know the story you know if you're not i'll tell you they said in verse 27 this altar is a witness that we have a part or a portion of the lord and then verse 29 they say god forbid that we should rebel against the lord god of our fathers who brought us out of egypt look at their honest words this is so different from achan akin said i saw them and i wanted them so now we see this altar wasn't an evil thing although it looked like one right really looked like one and their testimony was different than against testimony aiken admitted i love sin i hid it in my house but their testimony was we just want a witness that shows we're a part of you when generations come we want to stay a part of you but we want to witness that even on this side we have a part with god amen that just reminds me of the foolish virgin they they will have a part with god amen they won't live in the city but they'll live outside the city praise god they have a part with god and god's not going to forget about them praise god but look they had honest words now look at church this is what we find when we feel like someone's in the wrong we need to approach them with love the bible says those that are spiritual in james chapter 3 i believe it is correct those who are in mistake or those are in heir but you got to go into it ready to fight i'll never forget when that man uh he lived around here he called me up and said can i meet you at subway on saturday i said yes sir and i knew it was going to be war brother brother amen i just knew it was going to be war so i went there praying and fasting he started off and saying well all this and then pretty soon his voice got louder right in the middle of subway and people looking over at us like what's going on and he's crying and he's saying how could you have a youtube ministry don't you know all the evil on the internet and i just let him go for like five minutes all these people are crying i just felt the holy spirit and just me say wait wait i knew it was war now church i could have lashed out at him really good but the holy spirit gave me the spirit of humility and i said brother these videos i made this youtube ministry i've made is winning souls i had a woman email me a few years ago said you've saved my soul through that water baptism video we just got that video from the guy who was about the minister's marriage requirements that minister he said when i listened to your video it brought me out of bondage he said now i'm set free praise god amen and i said i did it so my family members if they wouldn't come to our church would listen to it and i've had that i've had family members text me and tell me that we did we listened to your videos and they were a blessing i don't know where they're going to end up with god but i said it's the same thing brother branham did it's the same thing brother neville did right and by the end he was all sobered up and i think his main concern was on youtube they put evil videos on the side but that's only if you're looking at him if you only click on good things church god is my witness i only click on good things on youtube those evil things don't come up on my feed i don't know what kind of algorithm you got going on but that tells me either you or your children are looking at the wrong things is that right and by the end i was war brother amen but by the end i come out of victor praise god i said show me where i'm wrong he said no he said okay i can see i respect that yeah i came to fight praise god but you got to fight with love amen fight with love so see the words the honest words will always say which side they're on in this case these men were set free because they're honest words we're not here to make an idol but church look how close right from wrong sometimes is look how close they build an altar and these men were ready to destroy them because there's only one altar there's only one savior that's jesus christ but god allowed it and god had mercy because there was going to be a need for it in future generations well we know they talk about it in verse 31 unity is restored but some things can be so close to evil and it all depends on your attitude right in romans 14 16 the bible said let not your good be evil spoken of so in context that's about meat paul was telling them some christians can eat meat and some can't because of their association with idols paul said if you're stumbling somebody don't eat meat but he also said let not your good be evil spoken of in other words stand up for your meat and say this ain't this ain't a struggle for me this ain't a battle for me praise god what about christmas oh that's some that's a good debate right there it can be so close right but it can be so far away right if brother braham said merry christmas what's wrong with saying merry christmas he was a holy ghost-filled man praise god if he put up a tree for joseph why can't somebody else put up a tree now me i just can't do it because of how i was raised right i just can't do that but if somebody can do that and still love jesus christ well then they're just like brother branham and the church said you think god will let brother brown do that all those years and let him do that sin i doubt it i highly doubt it and the scripture is in colossians 2 the bible said one man concerns one holy day above another and the bible said let him let him be holy to him it's holy to other people it ain't but the bible said let them do it he said be fully persuaded in your own mind church see that's the thing just make it a holy day if they're going to put up a tree though and watch the football game on christmas then they're in sin because they just gave three hours to the world and didn't even pray take two minutes see it's it's worldiness that's sin addiction they're you can't say their minds are transformed by the word of god when they just get programmed by nbc or whatever it is a fox news or fox sports for three hours and you say your mind's transformed impossible impossible what about hoffman's head i get comments on this all the time well i liked your sermon except the idolatry you have in your church my brother enough of that now i just delete them because i'm tired it's the same guy over and over i said the same guy that said no idols is the one he said put up those two cherubims right by my presence i said it's just a reminder it's just a reminder about jesus christ and how humble he was it's simply a reminder what's wrong with that and you know they can bring those scriptures for it but see then we see other people on facebook that worship brother brown's picture they actually bow down and worship brother graham's pillar of fire picture now that's idolatry so see it can be so close just like this altar can be so close using wine costly jewelry the bible said you can't have costly jewelry but how much does that mean well you need the wisdom of god to know right that's what we need we need uh humility if we're concerned about someone like this book of joshua we need to go to them with humility and then be able to receive it if they have the right testimony because a tree will always be known by its fruit eventually each person is going to end up at their uh their destination the bible calls it their perfection either going to be perfected by the five full ministry or can be perfected by the devil right tossed about with every wind of doctrine either one of the other right you're going to come to your fruition or your protection or i'm sorry perfection rather completion let me close with this i'm closing give me five minutes here i'm set a timer five give me give me five minutes my next video out is about how brother brand was so open to correction how many know he was open to correction i've had so many people tell me who are you to correct god's prophet and i said i'm saying this on the video since i can't talk to them all i said who are you to exalt every opinion of his to infallible and unquestionable because now you've just made him equal to jesus christ i said who are you to be so lazy not to search out the bible and see what the bible says about it because the bible says you're supposed to labor in the word of god they always say that these preachers say that who are you to correct god's prophet when they're trying to bring more authority to their preaching but they don't having studied it out haven't looked in the bible they've just listened to a sermon listening to a quote and they're trying to get authority to it but they haven't looked in the bible and they're wrong amen praise god hallelujah so brother baby said the holy ghost corrected him on the first seal brother braham said my wife she's my correction and the church said oh i'm sorry and the brother said amen amen amen amen now she's not to do it with the word she's to do it by her chase conversation first peter three verse one the woman doesn't go preach at the man but she lives such a godly life and she can even be like sister meda where midas said was that exactly right brother bill when you lied to the irs she wasn't preaching at him she was asking him a humble question and he had to come back and apologize say i'm sorry i called you to lie brother branham was corrected by a man named brother sherrod the man said i hate to correct you on anything brother brandon but you're mistaken he said you've caused those people by not receiving their presence you caused them to lose their reward and brother bam said he corrected me oh i thought you can't correct god's prophet on anything you just can't correct him that's a lie that's a lie that's a that's a spirit of idolatry so church remember anytime somebody somebody gives you a gift as long as it's from god you accept it now if it's the devil if it's a box of rattlesnakes you cast it down don't take that that's a false gift amen don't take a sickness or disease but you take a gift god's gonna bless them amen brother brahm let him uh brother brahm let a brother correct him in questions and answers 1961 in a bunch of ministers brother abraham said now the star does not reflect its own light the star reflects the light of the sun is that right this is what he said he said a star reflects the sun's light and the brother said no brother i said huh he said in a sense the moon reflects the light the stars shine their own light and brother branham said yeah yeah yeah he said that's right brother brown let a preacher correct him right in the middle of a sermon that's how humble brother adam was praise god oh but you you can't disagree with anything the prophet said he's infallible it's a lie he accepted all kinds of correction brother brahm said if any time you see me get away from the scripture he said if i'm wrong i don't care if you're one of the trustees like vang or if you're the janitor whoever you are your duty bound to me as a brother in christ to tell me where i'm wrong scripturally he said let's sit down and solve it out together and the church said i don't care who you are in the church if i'm wrong and i need corrected bring it to me with the right spirit and we'll sit down and talk to that brother the rams said a baptist minister came to correct him he said i like to straighten you out on the godhead sometime when you got time he said i got time right now he said because i want to be straight we lay aside everything else to be right a lutheran dean tried to correct brother branham but he was wrong but brother brahm even said i said i love you because you're interested enough in our lord jesus to try to correct me what is it about people that don't like to be corrected it's pride because brother madam said the love of god moved a lutheran dean to try to bring correction to him god loves correction amen god don't want us to continue in our false ideas and our opinions that are wrong god wants to correct us how else can he guide us into all truth if we don't accept correction see it's love when you go to correct someone that's how brother branham saw it the bible says in proverbs 9 verse 8 remember wednesday i preached on that brother who had i sent him a letter i called him on the phone i said you preached 24 false doctrines and i wrote in the letter i said i'm correcting you because i love you proverbs 9 verse 8 says reprove not a scorner lest he hate thee rebuke a wise man and he will love thee brother branham was corrected by a woman in a prayer line when he misspoke her last name he says uh would it make you believe me more it would mrs strong and the sister says mrs stout he said would you believe go and believe it's all over amen let's stand to our feet brother branham said i want trustees in my church who are not puppets now think of how many puppets we got in the message the irs told brother brandon you got a bunch of puppets in your church and look what he said to the irs he said why your trustees are nothing but puppets i said if i had a trustee on the board that had a different idea and wouldn't stand up for it i don't care who is speaking about it would express his own views on it i'd throw him off the board and look at that brother said if i knew i had a man who was a yes man on the board i'd throw him off because then he can't help me all he does is say just okay brother okay brother bram okay brother bam and he has no differing opinions of his own he says though is contrary to my belief i want him to express what he thinks is right that's what i got him there for see what he says about it but we have that i could go on and on and on but musicians that's close church this was a little different message how many appreciate the message today you see in joshua where brethren are going to come to spots of dif differing opinions and the way to approach is by the holy spirit you go there knowing war is going to take place but you go in the spirit of humility you give the person a chance to say their side and you see if the holy spirit will give you a witness on your side in this case the holy spirit gave the nine and a half tribes a witness this is okay and we're going to leave here we're going to be happy rejoicing and church did you catch that these are battles within the baptism of the holy ghost hello these are battles in message churches where it looks so close someone looks like they're so close to wrong but in humility you got to go to them and say is this is it why are you doing this can you can you i like those words brother samuel taught me can you help me understand those before beautiful words can you i'm sorry five words can you help me understand i gotta learn how to count again can you help me understand and this is what mature christians do they rightly divide the word of truth they seek god for discernment about disagreements because they want to diligently love god and they don't want any false doctrine they don't want any sin any sin addiction creeping into the church how many went to church with unleavened let's pray heavenly father we see such wisdom in the books of the bible lord you know my heart i'm just overwhelmed every time i read this this is so beautiful i can clearly see how this applies to the new testament the saint who's born again who's crossed over jordan and has possessed the promises of god lord and i see amongst ministers that's why i'm trying to correct different ones from jeffersonville from other states and i accept correction on myself i accept it because i need it and i know you love me lord enough to correct me if you didn't correct me i wouldn't be your son but because you correct me i can be a son of god hallelujah lord as i think about the statements that i felt you preached down through this sermon i pray the young people would not tease one another but they would build each other up and lord let me just say to the adults too they wouldn't tease one another for lord it could have been for the adults as well but you know i felt that burden as i was preparing this morning not even i wasn't even thinking about it just come to my heart lord let us have a humble attitude like your prophet like peter who could be corrected by paul a man who could walk on water a man whose shadow would heal the sick mercy but yet he was humble enough to receive correction help us lord to receive your correction and if we would be the ones to go out to a spiritual war may we do it in love and meekness the bible said and may we have a listening ear may we be slow to speak and quick to listen [Music] to me lord every sermon is almost like a shouting sermon i shout i thank you lord for your word for your truth o god now help me to live it lord in jesus name help our church deliver in jesus christ holy name amen [Music] [Music]

[Music] amen hallelujah god bless you church that's our heads for word of prayers we're dismissed here right about two hours praise god how do you enjoy the service today praise god was it like a four hour service five hour service last saturday night and go so fast doesn't it when you're in god's presence four hours yeah it's like you're sitting in heavenly places praise god we only need half of

just remember john and liam prayer as well and uh what a blessing to be in the house of lord today let's bow our heads heavenly father we thank you again for your mercy and grace it's such a joy to be in your army dear god hallelujah we remember what egypt was like lord god i remember what egypt was like but you brought me out on eagle's wings the old testament in the new testament lord buried me lord in the waters of baptism lord god through the red sea through the wilderness and into the promised land and lord these 18 years have been the land lord it's been a blessing many hard battles many victories and lord we will keep battling we'll keep fighting because lord you've given us love and our love will keep us diligent for the things of god granted lord grant this blessing to each and every person that they can live inside your promised land each person can drink of the living waters and they'll flow out of their mouths dear god hallelujah and they'll possess every promise though may be poor in this world encourage them that they'll be rich in the world to come dear god greatly be rewarded amen for your service here help us learn to be rich in faith that's our prayer today let us be as we fight these battles in this land and lord again we just ask again we keep pleading again for a swift healing for brother john and leah and lean up over there on highland square lord jesus
